My alterations make this a five star recipe, in my opinion, but as written, it needs work to suit my family.  I like my lemon bars tart, not sickening sweet.  Here's what I do:  Decrease temp to 350 degrees.  Leave crust the same, put in 9 x 13 enameled metal pan.  Bake 15 min.  For filling, double flour and eggs, use 1 C lemon juice and 1 3/4 C sugar.  Add 3 drops yellow food coloring.  Bake 20 min.

These are easy and delicious.  I hate when people review recipes and then say "Don't make the original recipe, use my changes".  I like to follow the original recipe and then rate it for what it's worth.  I liked this and thought they were tasty!

DOUBLE the ingredients for the crust. And for the rest of the recipe, DO what GOURMETMOMMY does-decrease temp to 350 degrees.  Put in 9 x 13 enameled metal pan. Bake 15 min. For filling, double flour and eggs, use 1 C lemon juice and 1 3/4 C sugar. Add 3 drops yellow food coloring. Bake 20 min. With these changes to the recipe, you will get  delicious lemon bars!   Do NOT use the original recipe!

I made these a few minutes ago and followed Gourmet Mommy's advice and will put it here so no one else has to scroll back 4 years!!---->(From Gourmet Mommy: My alterations make this a five star recipe, in my opinion. I like my lemon bars tart, not sickening sweet. Here's what I do: Decrease temp to 350 degrees. Leave crust the same, put in 9 x 13 enameled metal pan. Bake 15 min. For filling, double flour and eggs, use 1 C lemon juice and 1 3/4 C sugar. Add 3 drops yellow food coloring. Bake 20 min.)  

** Now I did not use the food coloring and added 1/2 tsp lemon extract.  I also used 2/3 cup butter on accident, but the bars did not turn out too buttery or greasy.  Delicious and I will be using this recipe during the holidays.

I've made these a bunch of times and they've always turned out great. Here's a piece of advice for the people who are having problems with the recipe. 1) Pay attention to your crust. Everyone's oven is different, and what works in one may not work in another. 2) TASTE the filling part!Not a spoonful, just a fingerfull before you pour it in. If it's too sweet, you'll know before you waste an entire batch. My roots are in the south, so I like them sweet :o) If you don't, though, try this and you may save yourself some heartache!

I've made this several times now and several ways.  I am rating it 5 stars for the original recipe and had no trouble at all covering the 9x 13 pan with the crust.  I think the secret is to spread it with an angled cake frosting knife.  I've also made this with GourmetMommy's suggestions (most helpful ratings) and really hated it (sorry) - WAY too sour - guess I'm a Southerner at heart and like the sweeter version?  Last night for our potluck I made it as directed, except used the Shortbread Crust recipe (on this site submitted by Angela) someone had suggested and doubled the original filling (had to cook a bit longer).  It was yummy but very gooey and I like them a bit crunchier for lack of a better word.  Totally LOVED the shortbread crust (you must try it this way) and the bars were gone within the first five minutes.  For anyone out there - turn your oven down to 350 as all have said and watch it!  My crust baked perfectly but some ovens are hotter.  Just keep an eye on it until it's golden brown - about every 7-8 minutes.

I don't understand why this is a 5 star recipe if everyone who liked it altered it in one way or another.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the result was a burnt, rubbery, flavorless bar cookie.  I would recommend finding another lemon bar recipe.

My husband loved these. I made them twice, the first time as described by the recipe. The second time I reduced the pan size in half and lowered the temperature to 300 and cooked each phase untill goloden brown on top. They came out thicker and better!

These lemon bars were VERY good.  I had some trouble with them though.  I have NO idea how you all spread this dough to fit a 13x9 pan.  It was too sticky so I put it in an 8x8 and cooked it for the same amount of time and it came out fine.  I also had trouble cutting the bars.  The bottom was very hard.  I wanted to add more lemon juice since other reviewers suggested this but I didn't have more than 1/4 c. so I put in 1/2 tsp. lemon oil.  That did the trick.  I'll definitely make these again.

These were good, however, next time I make them, I will only bake for 20 minutes-after 25, they were a little crunchy (but still really tasty!)

I added just one cup of sugar and a few more capfuls of lemon juice. I wanted thicker bars so I put mine in a 9x9 pan and lowered the heat to 350 but kept the same baking time and they turned out great! (On a side note, I too can't stand when people alter the recipe so much that their explanation is longer than the original recipe. Why don't they just submit their own?) I do appreciate reading TIPS and others experiences, though!

I've made these a few times as they're so easy and delicious.  I used the original recipe as well as the changes suggested by GourmetMommy, and I have to say we all liked the original recipe better.  I have to admit that I'm usually quick to make all of the changes as suggested by other reviewers, but sometimes, they're just wrong.  Stick with the recipe on this one.

This is an excellent recipe as written. No need to modify. For the crust, mix ingredients until it has consistency of coarse corn meal. DO NOT let it turn to a dough as it is almost impossible to work with at that point. Only problem is that recipe says it makes 36 servings and, but mine only made one serving.

These bars are VERY simple and so tasty. I do have one small suggestion you just might wanna try. 
I saw this on a cooking show: Lemon juice, when used in a recipe, partly cooks off when being baked. To keep a lot of that fresh lemon flavor, Add 1 tablespoon of fresh gated lemon rind! Amazing!

I've made this a few times now. Twice according to the recipe, and a few times with some alterations (include Gourmet Mommy). I actually find many aspects of this recipe fine as is but: 1) Definitely decrease the temperature of the oven to 350 and remove your crust at 10 minutes, remove the filling at 15-17.   2) I find the filling ratios (sugar to lemon) fine as is. I do think that the technique needs to be modified though because the bars are a little thin. Make sure to use room temperature eggs. Separate them and keep the yolks to the side. Whip the whites until they form soft peaks. Then cream together the flour, sugar, lemon juice and yolks. Fold the yolk mixture into the whites. This will help give some volume to the lemon part.

Made as is and they're tasty but 1) a little thin for my liking and 2) I would like them a bit more "lemony". Next time I'll use some alterations from other reviewers. The crust is fantastic though!!

Good! I made the mistake of doubling up on the crust but NOT the lemon part. Double BOTH for thicker bars. My lemon topping was fully done and browning after only 10 minutes. If you DO double it, it may take longer. I'm going to try to make this a little more tart and lemon-y next time. It tasted good, but there was no prominent lemon flavor. Texture for both parts was delicious, though. Thanks. :)

DO NOT READ THE REVIEWS!!! I tried to do all of the different things that everyone was saying and it turned out with too thick of a crust, not enough lemon, and way too sweet. Next time I will try the original recipe first!

I have made these 3 times now - and now I'm known as the Lemon Bar Lady!  Everybody loves them.  After reading through the reviews I've also cut down on the time of the baking the crust, about 12 minutes and the completed bars for about 20 minutes with the oven at 350.  (You just really have to check for the golden brown.)I also make 1/3 more filling to pour over (that was the easiest with 1 extra egg)and they are absolutely perfect.  I have given the recipe out 3 times now also, and everyone is waiting for the next batch.

This recipe has made me the subject of family jokes-no one wants me to bring dessert anymore. I tried to adjust my recipe to a median of different suggestions: smaller pan, more filling, more lemon juice, less time cooking, lower oven temp. It came out terrible. The dough was raw and burnt at the same time. How does that happen. I couldn't cut through it at all and people were marveling that I had just invented a new polymer, because water just slicked off of it in the sink. Why isn't this recipe being adjusted formally?? Thumbs down, way down.

I followed the original recipe, the only thing I did different was set my oven for 350. IMO, they came out dangerously delicious. Light, buttery crust, and  just the right amount of sweet and tart. Just how I imagined a lemon bar should taste.

Perfect recipe for a crisp, sweet & lemony bar. I prefer a thicker bar, so I made in a 7 x 11 instead of a 9 x 13. Cooking time still was spot on... even though I thought they smelled overcooked & kind-of "eggy" cooking til (lightly)brown on top. I lined the baking dish with parchment paper for easier removal. After cooling ( preferred to do in the fridge) they cut nicely and tasted lemony but not 'too' tart. and not eggy at all. I think I would prefer next time to not use quite as much sugar in the crust part. But that is not fault of the recipe... I just don't eat real sweet things often, and I love a shortbread type crust. So, if i make for a gift i will use the sugar as stated. If I make for a family treat, I will lessen the sugar by hmm... prob. half.

I adore this recipe!  It's quick, easy and great! I shorten the baking time 5 minutes and spray the top with Pam before sprinkling the powdered sugar to keep the top soft.  This is awesome when made with lime juice.  I am always asked for the recipe when I take this to a gathering.

I have the Allrecipes Cookies cookbook and that's where I originally got this recipe. There are no reviews in the book, so I had to try it as written. I have been making these for a few years as written and my family gobbles them up. If you're going to try a recipe, at least give the original a shot first. This makes easy lime bars as well with bottled lime juice and a drop of green food coloring.

Using the suggested adaptations provided by GourmetMommy, I add my rating :oP
I found these to be of a good thickness, not too sweet; the base crust is very pleasant indeed! They are a pleasant & mild lemon taste, in my opinion, however Hubby (who feared the recipe with "lemon" in it) said they were very enjoyable. Yea... he ate half of the batch in two days. I rate these a FOUR on the basis that I found them to not *quite* meet my tart desires... I will definitely add some lemon zest as well next time!
**PS** Here are those adaptations, sincethey are buried many pages back now:

Decrease temp to 350 degrees. Leave crust the same, put in 9 x 13 enameled metal pan. Bake 15 min. For filling, double flour and eggs, use 1 C lemon juice and 1 3/4 C sugar. Add 3 drops yellow food coloring. Bake 20 min.

After following GOURMETMOMMY'S suggestions, the filling was delicious.  The crust, however, was just ok.  I prefer the shortbread crust recipe submitted by Angela on this site, it has a much better flavor and texture.

I like the recipe just the way it is. I think the problem GOURMETMOMMY and beebeebaker were having is that they were using metal pans, and it worked just fine the way it was when I used my glass pan. I didn't double the crust either, and it worked great. I suggest trying it the way it is before making more crust or adjusting temps, though if you know for a fact you like more tart bars, then go ahead and lessen the sugar and try it that way.

It is rather misleading to try a highly rated recipe when there have been so many changes.  I followed the changes that apparently everyone said makes it a 5 star recipe.  Way too much flour in the filling, and maybe even too many eggs.  It was rubbery and pasty.  I've had WAY better lemon bar recipes.  And I'm not even sure whether to rate the original recipe poorly or the modifications.  I figure if the modifications were supposed to make it better (and the modifications were not good), the original was worse?  Again, just misleading.

This is a great lemon bar! After reading the reviews I decided to 1 1/2 the crust ingredients. Also upped the fresh lemon juice to 1/3 cup and added 1 teaspoon lemon zest. Perfect! Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe. Modifications...350..20 minutes for the crust works great. Increased back to 375 for baking filling. Increased amount of lemon juice til I found that taste I liked. Overall..very satisfied with this recipe.

I work in a high school cafeteria. I am not only the assistant cook, but since I once worked in a bakery, I am the baker for the regional school district. I must tell you that this ORIGINAL recipe has been requested over and over again for years. I have been required to bake it for all activities. Bake it as is and you will disappoint NO ONE. I have to quadruple the recipe and make it in full sheet pans. Don't worry if the cake layer seems unusual at first. Just press it in there and make sure that the bottom of the pan is covered. It will be PERFECTION! Enjoy this. It is simple and delicious. Got to run. It is just coming out of the oven for Mother's Day 2008!

The taste of the bars themselves were delicious, but only after I made some adjustments, therefore I give it 4 stars. The recipe directions and amounts have flaws. Firstly, I do not recommend making this recipe with a 9x13" pan because there is not nearly enough lemon filling or crust batter unless you want 0.25" tall squares. For the amount of ingredients listed, I found using a 9x9" pan perfect. Also, I used 350degrees throughout the whole baking process because I found that a lot of people said 375deg was too high. I baked the crust for around 18min. Many previous reviewers said it was too sweet, so for the filling, I used 1/2 cup lemon juice for more tartness instead of 1/4 as recipe states, and so I also added an extra 1tbsp of flour so the bars won't be any runnier. I baked for 24 minutes at 350 Degrees, and it was ready, with the edges almost burnt, but middle being perfect. Next time I might adjust the oven to 325deg during the last 10minutes of baking so the edges won't bake faster than the center and so the bar will be more evenly baked. With these adjustments you will make absolutely delectable, perfect sized lemon bars!!

The BEST lemon squares!!!  My whole family loves them.  Chewy texture with a great lemon flavour. I decreased the crust cooking time to 15 minutes and the lemon layer for 17-19 minutes to ensure that they didn't brown around the edges!  Definely a keeper!!!!!

Pretty good flavor...I wouldn't bake them on 375 degrees no matter what.  I should have went with my gutt on it....I had a feeling 350 would have been better.  Watch closely no matter what temp. you use.  I just thought I'd follow the recipe to a T and see what happened.  They were pretty well done, not burned but more well done that I would like for a lemon bar, but the flavor was pretty good.  Not very lemony/tart, so if that's what you like, then you'll like these.  Very thin bar...would like more filling, like double there is on these.  Not my favorite recipe for lemon bars, sorry.

There are other lemon bar recipes on this site but.... this one requires no sifter, doesn't need a mixer, fewer ingredients, fewer reviewers' changes. My only adjustment was putting it in a 9x9 pan at 350 - TRUST ME, SMALLER PAN IS NEEDED. I can't imagine making it any thinner if it was in a 9x13. No need to double ingredients like reviews suggested if you just put it in a smaller pan. It took about 5 minutes to make the crust. While that was baking, about 15 minutes to whisk other ingredients. Then 15-20 minutes in oven.....so within 45 minutes you have very tasty lemon bars = 5 stars!!!

I had a major problem with these bars and I'm still upset that I wasted all those ingredients. I'm not sure what happened, but mine never set completely...? I had to give them 3 stars because I tried them, gooey and liquidy as they were, and they were delicious! I'll try these again soon.

I will not make this recipe again. I consider myself a very good cook or baker, and I am also very capable of following a recipe. There was not enough to the crust to cover the entire 9x13 pan.  I had to press it extremely thin and still had about 3-1/2 inches at the end of the pan that did not get covered. Due to the thin crust, I only baked for 1/2 the time and it came out browned to a crisp.  The filling did not have any taste of lemon, and the edges were black by the time I took this out of the over the second time.

I found these to be very good.  Made as is the first time.  Wanted a bit more filling, so next time I added an extra 1/3 recipe of filling, baking it just a bit longer.  Try the original recipe first THEN give it a 1 star or thumbs down if that is how you feel.

I thought these bars were wonderful for what they were....Super Easy. I put these bars together in about 5 min.  These were baked, cooled, cut, and on the tray in a hour. I found that they cut nicely when still warm and just put them on the cooling rack to finish cooling.  I did not alter the ingredients at all but I did decrease the oven temp to 325 and baked in a greased, glass 9x13, and increased the cooking time 8-10 minutes. Adjust to your oven..shorter if your oven runs hot..longer if it runs cool. It will look like you do not have enough crust..I stated to get upset but I pressed it out and it did cover the whole pan. DO Not run up the side of the pan. I can see why people said the edges burnt, just pat even into bottom. If your pan is greased well enough the filling will not stick to the sides of the pan but will develop a very thin, very light brown, wonderfully chewy edge. I felt the powered sugar sprinkle was not needed and can be messy. Crust was perfect and filling was great. They cut like a dream. For those who prefer more crust or filling then experiment and double what you want. I might try next time adding some lemon zest for more lemon flavor. BUT for how easy they were and the fact that most people have these simple ingredients on hand they were great. The original recipe was published in my taste of home magazine and the original temp was 350 not 375.

My family and I think these turned out great. I have a theory on the burning issue: dont try to make the crust come up the sides to hold the filling - just make it flat on the bottom and cover completely with the filling. I think it will burn if it isn't covered with the filling. I also cooked both a wee bit shorter as my oven is quite hot. 
Turns out delicious for our tastes. Thank you Elaine.

I ended up baking these on my Weber grill because I was waiting for my oven to be fixed and they were AMAZING.  My husband took them to work to share with his staff.  I'm now baking another batch just for myself!  I didn't change a single thing and they came out Perfect.

I baked these in a 9x9 inch pan lined with parchment, but otherwise followed the recipe with one exception:  I added 1 T cointreau to the filling mix.  They came out really well!  Very, very easy to make.  Thank you for the recipe!

Doubling crust was too much! i think that mine need three times the amount of filling.  overall favor was okay.  Too much wheat flour i'm sure also was to blame. When doubling crust i used 1 cup wheat flour, 1 cup white, and 1 cup soy. Mine just was not right.

These bars had just the right amount of sweetness and there was plenty of dough for the bottom.  My boyfriend ate 7 of these without even blinking!  I will definitely be making these again.

Disappointed... lemony topping waaaay too thin.  I wish I would have read the reviews BEFORE making this. A plea to other AllRecipes.com cooks - please rate recipes based upon how they are originally posted as a 4.5 star recipe should be a 4.5 star recipe. Thanks.

Unfortunately I took heed of all the reviews the first time I made this and used a smaller pan and ended up with an almost inedibly thick base and bars that were just too much.  The second time I made these, I made them as written and they came out perfectly.  My lemons were not very tart, so I doubled the lemon juice, on checking the batter.

These are great.  Very easy to make.  I have also made them with Key lime juice, since I live in florida and everyone here loves key lime.  These are a home made staple for me.  I have people at my job request these...:)

For the life of me I can't imagine why you would bother rating a recipe badly if you made all sorts of changes to it.    I and everyone who had one of these absolutely loved them.  They had just the right amount of tartness and sweetness to them.  I followed the directions and baked the crust until it was golden brown, cook times do vary so it took all of five extra minutes.  The only thing I would suggest is using fresh squeezed lemon versus the bottled stuff, one lemon juiced and zested is what I ended up using.  Thanks fdor sharing a great recipe.

I made this with the recommendations from GourmetMommy & they were 5 star! Definitely double the filling to match crust!!!And when patting the crust into pan push it up the sides just 1/4" or so. The only addition I had was to add a tbsp. of lemon zest to filling and they were perfect! Crust was like shortbread, buttery, yummm & filling was lemony with just the right amount of tartness. They were even better the second day. If they last that long!!!

great tasting lemon bars, but I would cut the baking time down a little, for both times where baking is needed because the edges of the pan were WAY too brown, even hard and it was very hard to cut them. Next time I am going to do 15 minutes for each time.

This is a great recipe!  My husband loves it!!  Tip:  If you buy lemons at your local farmers market or pick them off your tree, this recipe tastes super fresh!!  The quality of the lemons will make a difference!!  I typically double the lemon juice and halve the sugar amount to have extra lemony bars.

Delicious! I took previous advice and reduced the cooking temperature to 325 degrees with the original cooking time.  Worked out great. Next time I will try adding a touch more lemon flavor.  The chewy edges are the best part!

These alterations make this a five star recipe, in my opinion. I like my lemon bars tart, not sickeningly sweet. Here's what I do: Decrease temp to 350 degrees. Leave crust the same, put in 9 x 13 enameled metal pan. Bake 15 min. For filling, double flour and eggs, use 1 C lemon juice and 1 3/4 C sugar. Add 3 drops yellow food coloring. Bake 20 min.

I made this exactly as GOURMETMOMMY said, and it was good. One cup of lemons came out to be nine whole fresh medium-sized lemons (FYI). The filling was tart, not sweet. But the crust...I can't pin down what I don't like. I think it's "too much butter." If I make this again, I'd perhaps decrease the butter, or maybe use part butter, part margarine; or maybe add more confectioner's sugar or regular sugar. If you like lemon bars, I'd say, "Make these," and use GOURMETMOMMY's changes.

This recipe is pretty good, but there two things it lacked. One is the temp is just too high. My bottom layer was very brown around the edges after about 12 minutes. I reduced the temp to 350 and put it on the top rack after that. I think next time I am going to bake at 325 or 350 and try again. Secondly, the recipe doesn't say whether to use a glass or metal baking pan. For the record, I used dark metal. (This may be why I had to adjust temp.). Overall I thought these were pretty good. A food processor mixes the dough very well. One of those little pampered chef rollers would have come in handy too make sure it was even in the pan. I also increased the lemon to 1/2 cup. Make sure to loosen the edges from pan before it cools and make your life a lot easier. Overall, just start out with a lower temp and keep an eye on it, better safe than sorry. But they're pretty good.

This recipe is as my girls would call it, "the bomb" (which is a great thing).  We made these for a family reunion and I received many compliments.  I have made many different lemon bar recipes, but this is by far the most easiest, most excellent one I have ever tried.  I used 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice and it was absolutely awesome!

Where's the lemon? Should be called "sweet bars" not lemon bars. No one even knew they were lemon bars. SKIP this if you are looking for lemon flavor.

I made these using the directions of GOURMETMOMMY and I think that the tartness is great, but too sweet.  Will cut back to only 3/4c sugar next time.  They look great and taste good, but too sweet for me.

In the middle because I used GourmetMommy's suggestion. Extremely tart on the day you cook it (and I LOVE tart), but put it in the fridge overnight and the tartness mellows out. THEN the taste is FANTASTIC!!!!

Great lemon bar! I lowered the temp to 350 and baked the crust for 10 minutes. I did add some lemon zest to the crust.  Added in an extra quarter cup of real lemon juice plus a nice heaping tablespoon of lemon zest to the lemon mixture. Baked the whole thing for 20 minutes. Came out great!

I followed GOURMETMOMMY's recipe instructions (reviewed Oct. 14, 2009), rather than what's called for. However, what I did make turned out well, and wasn't too sweet for our tastes. I think they could have been even tarter, but that's likely because I used meyer lemons (sweeter, less tart) from my tree instead of normal supermarket variety ones. Next time I'll use supermarket ones.

Double the lemon juice. Egg wash (or egg white wash) the dough before baking it so to create a protective film. Otherwise you won't have a crispy dough that contrast well with the chewy cream lemony top. I tried it with Key lime juice and it was great!

I have been making this recipe for years (this is the same one that is in my grandmas old cookbook) and have had no issues...I don't know what everyone else is doing wrong, but they turn out fine for every time. The only thing I change is the temperature to 350 (that's the temperature in the cookbook). My friends tell me of all the things I make, these are some of their favorites. I encourage you to give the recipe a try just as written.

This was my first attempt at lemon bars.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they are very tasty. Well, I shouldn't say "exactly." My oven bakes hot, so I always reduce the temp by 25 degrees anytime I bake. Also, my butter was frozen, so I melted it before mixing it with the flour and powdered sugar, and the crust turned out beautifully.  I would not want to double the crust for this recipe.  They were not too sweet.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because they were not as gooey as I expected a lemon bar to be.

I followed gourmetmommy's suggestions.  The only exception I had, was I did not have enough lemon juice so I used about 1/2-3/4 cup lemon juice and the remainder up to 1 cup was lime juice.  I also used 3 drops of yellow and 1 drop of green food coloring.  Yummy recipe!!

Silly me, I didn't bother to read the reviews before baking. I had the oven at 375 - big mistake! I put the crust in for 15 minutes and the rest in for 17, and the edges were very burnt. I cut a big square in the middle and used that as the finished product. They taste fantastic, in my opinion - even the burnt parts. However they could probably use a little more lemon juice.

I didn't use any yellow food coloring, and I wish I had, because mine look quite boring and home-made.

We backed it for 20 minutes, as said at 375 degrees,but when it came out it was all burnt! The Bars were for a party too! I was very disappointed.

These didn't look like lemon squares when I made them.  There was a crust on top of the that almost made them look like they were an apple square or something. 

They were very good but I would double the lemon filling next time.  Some of the edge pieces didn't have much lemon

I used GourmetMommy's modifications and made my own (that's why it gets only a 3/5)

1. Use a graham-cracker crust (there's a good recipe if you search for it).  The dough one got too soggy and nasty after a few days.  

2.  I followed GourmetMommy's changes exactly:  use 6 eggs and 6 tablespoons of flour and DEFINITELY bake at 350 deg.  Otherwise, it gets too "done" and tastes REALLY eggy.  I've made this 3 times and have it down PERFECT :-)

These were good. For the crust and the final baking time I found that 5 minutes less on both would have been good, so 15 minutes each. The only change I made was I used limes instead of lemons. I felt that the filling could have more lime flavor and not sure how much I like the "sticky" custard. I do like themthough. I didn't sprinkle the top with more sugar since it already had plenty of sugar.

I followed GOURMETMOMMY'S recommendations on the first page. I will probably try more lemon bar recipes but these are the best I've made yet. I hate lemon bars that are more shortbread cookie than filling, but when made according to the modifications it's the perfect proportion. The crust melts in your mouth, but it's still all about the tart lemon flavor. Firm but not rubbery. My guests raved about them, even the ones who are not typically into the "sweeter" desserts. Very good!

I am rating this based on the ORIGINAL recipe.  The crust was perfectly fine, no complaints there, but the cooking time is too high and, like others, even though I left them in for the minimum amount of time, the edges burned and the top was too browned.  When I cut in to them the filling was the same height as the crust (not a very good ratio) and had virtually no lemon flavor.  I had made these for my home-baking business as part of an order for a graduation party today.  I am glad I had bought a lot of lemons to make lemonade, because I ended up doing the entire recipe over again, using the suggestions of others.  I really wish I could rate that recipe because it is a winner!  I followed what others said and backed down the oven to 350, doubled the sugar and eggs, added WAY more juice, a tad more sugar, and it was DELICIOUS!  I don't think you could add powdered sugar to the tops, though as these are so moist it would be absorbed.  (Not a problem on the original recipe as they are so dry the powdered sugar goes nowhere.)  If you're looking for something just sticky sweet with no lemon flavor and a little crunchy then the original recipe may work for you.  But we prefer a lot of lemon flavor and a lot of filling/topping for the crust.

WOWZA! These were terrific! I made them for Easter dinner and everyone loved them! I did make some changes based on previous recommendations...doubled the crust and used 3/4 cup lemon juice with 1 3/4 cup sugar. I did bake them in a 350 degree oven. I grew up with  frosting on lemon bars and found this one: 2 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 c. butter, 1 tsp. vanilla & 1 1/2 Tb milk. Whipped together and frosted the bars after they were chilled. Did I mention that I wanted to eat every last one?! Thank you for a great recipe!

I took the suggestions from GourmetMommy (actually, I used 3/4 cup lemon juice) and found these too tart for my taste once they had baked up. Not the perfect blend of sweet and tart I was hoping for.  It's tough to rate the original recipe with modifications and I agree it's somewhat arrogant to modify the heck out of a recipe and then rate/review it, but I'm giving this 3 stars. I likely wont make again, unless requested.

I followed the listed directions and there was very little lemon topping. The crust is fine but there is very little lemon flavor, I love lemon and lemon bars and ended up not eating these. Trying again using gourmetmommy's directions. I don't know how recipes get rated so highley when 500+ people prefer the altered version of it, isn't that just preferring a different recipe?

With corrections, this recipe is fantastic. Definitely the best lemon bars I've ever tasted, and my entire family agrees. I didn't have time to cool them all the way before serving, and they were even more amazing served a little warm!  FYI: I doubled the crust, and used 1 cup lemon juice and 2 cups white sugar in the filling.

I really liked this recipe! I did make some changes though. If I hadn't done it in a 9 x 9 square pan, I think they would have been much too thin. I made the crust, baked for 15 minutes only, I upped the filling flour to 4 tbsp and the lemon juice to 1/3 cup, added 3 drops of pink food colouring (they looked really cute); and then baked for about 20 more minutes. My co-workers really enjoyed them and a few asked for the recipe :)

I LOVE THESE. They are the greatest things in the world. They remind me when i was little and my older sister use to make them for me. I used a little less lemon juice since i didn't want it to be too tart. They are so good! They are creamy, ooey and gooey! LOVE THEM!

I almost followed the original recipe. Wished I'd have followed it completely. The bars were very good except I made them in a 11x7 pan instead of the 13x9 pan. They were too thick and gooey. Next time I will follow directions...my bad. Excellent flavor but I didn't like the texture. I'll give it another shot, the right way.

I only used 1 cup of sugar in the filling, and the bars turned out quite tasty.  1.5 cups would have been too much.  I also added the zest of one lemon to the filling.  Baked at 325.  Other reviewers have said that there isn't enough of both the crust and the filling, and I half agree.  Next time I will double the filling, but I liked the thin crust that the original recipe yielded.  The only other thing to note: GREASE YOUR PAN GENEROUSLY.  OVERDO IT IF YOU MUST.  While my bars came out tasting good, it was disastrous trying to get it out of the pan (I had greased minimally to reduce what little fat content I could)!  So go ahead and slather on the butter or spray before baking!!

These turned out very well. I did use the recommendations and doubled the eggs and flour for the filling. Increased the white sugar to 2 cups (I like them sweet) and used 3/4 cup or so of lemon juice. No need to double the crust- there was plenty. Once the filling was in, I did need it to bake at least 25 min to get a little golden on the outside. Turned out great! Will make again- except I might try using some lemon zest next time in addition to the lemon juice.

If I had the option to do so, I would have given it NO stars! I am considered a "master baker" so, oven temperature and technique can not be blamed here. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the crust and adjusted the filling/topping.

These were really good (with Gourmetmommy's recommendations). Nice and tart. I was a little worried at first because the crust didn't hold together that well in the bowl but I just patted it into place in the pan and it turned out fine.  Also, if you're going to dust with powdered sugar, do that shortly before serving, otherwise it kind of gets absorbed into the top of the bars.

I think I'd have to try these again. I didn't want to bake too many, since it is just me and my husband, so I tried to scale the recipe down. That might have affected the taste of these. They were kind of doughy tasting, and weren't very lemony! Even after adding a bit extra lemon juice. I will most definitely try it again not scaling it down and rewrite a review.

Very good, made all of the changes that "Gourmet Mommy" suggested, but also doubled the crust ingredients and used 4 eggs. Oh, and I added 3 drops of yellow food coloring...very lemony!!! (1 cup lemon juice). Oh yeah, and remember to dust the tops of the lemon bars practically minutes before serving - or the powdered sugar will 'melt' into the bars.

This was very, very good lemon bar recipe. I did not double the crust like other said, but instead, I used a 8x8 pan and they can out perfect. There was a good amount of crust to it( which was the best part to me) without  being too much. My fiance had me make them 3 days in a row and he is not a big sweet eater. definitely worth all 5 stars.

I followed the recipe exactly and used a 9 x 13 pan and they turned out wonderfully. The crust seemed like more than enough to fill the pan. Anyway, they are absolutely delicious and because they were so easy, I will definitely be making them again.

A good basic recipe--I did use a 9x13 pan, though I thought it was smaller! LOL!!!  I used juice & zest from 2 lemons, approx. 1/2 cup juice, and only a cup of sugar.  Also added a bit of salt to each part to bring out the flavors.  Melted the butter for the crust portion for ease, worked great!

The temperature was too high. Next time I would only put it on 350' and decrease the baking time, both the crust and the filling. I used only 1/3C of the lemon juice and both me and hubby agreed that it can go up to 1/2C or so then it'll be perfect. Although, this recipe itself is still very easy and taste good.

These were good lemon bars, but not quite what I am used to.  The crust was EXCELLENT, and the curd was good, though a bit sweeter than I prefer. The cook time on the crust is WAY to long...I baked it for 12 min and it still was almost too brown when all was said and done.  Also, when I made the curd and poured it over the crust, there was not NEARLY the amount that I expected, so I ended up making another batch.  With 2x the filling it was about right. Fed these to the DH and coworkers, and all the truck drivers loved them!  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, because it was in the Allrecipes cookbook I purchased. It was just OK, but I sure wish I had read the reviews before I made it. The crust was way too overdone and crispy (and I even took it out about 7-8 minutes before it was supposed to be done). The filling was too thin too. Definitely needs some changes--I will look elsewhere for another recipe.

This recipe was good, but I would make these changes next time I make them as they were way too brown and hard:  Lower the oven temperature to about 325 and the time for baking to 13-15 minutes the first time and 18-20 minutes the second time. (either do that or put it in a 11x7 brownie pan and follow the original directions....just be sure to watch for the crust to become slightly brown rather than actual time for baking. I really think using a 11x7 would be better anyway....they wouldn't be quite so thin)  I would also add either some lemon zest or lemon extract for a stronger lemon flavor.

We didn't like these at all.  The texture of the filling was okay, but the flavor was bland.  The crust was like cardboard.  I will not try these again.  For those making these bars for the first time, I suggest reducing the oven temperature to 350 degrees.

Definately yummy!  However, crust got a little too dark; will shorten pre-bake time next time.  Otherwise - a keeper!  Venturing with lime juice next go round.

These were good but I found them to be too thin. They seemed more like cookies then bars. I think next time I would make them in an 8 x 8 pan, split the crust part of the recipe in half, and keep the measurements for the lemon filling the same. I think I would also add more lemon juice as well because it wasn't lemon tasting enough.

They are tasty.  I also used 1/3 cup of lemon juice, but I'm going to try 1/4 cup next time.  I lined it with foil, and greased the foil.  I lifted it out of the pan while they were still warm.  The foil easily peeled away from the bars.  I had no trouble with the bars sticking.  Thanks Elaine, and thanks to everyone for all the tips.

Don't listen to the reviewers who say to cut the bake time down- I did so and ended up with raw dough on the bottom. Ick. When I followed the recipe exactly, though, WOW! I made these for my family and my fiancee's over the holidays and Im *still* getting compliments.  You must try these! I up the lemon juice to 1/3 cup to make it a little more lemony...mmmmm!

I've already made these twice this week since running across this recipe. It's awesome! I made it in a 9x13 pan per the instructions the first time, but was not pleased with the visual results. Taste-wise it was fine, though. So I put it in my Pampered Chef 8 or 9-in. (can't remember) square baker (stoneware) and it turned out much better. I also added some lemon flavor just because I really wanted it to be extra *lemony*. A suggestion I'd make is to blend the crust ingredients in a food processor rather than doing the blending by hand. THOROUGHLY blend the crust ingreds.! It should look like cookie dough. If you taste it, it IS like cookie dough. Yum! Then press it into the pan. I'd also recommend greasing the sides of the pan REALLY well, as that yummy, gooey lemon stuff sticks to the sides terribly. Oh the misery of scraping off the goo and being forced to eat it! LOL!

I have gotten SO many compliments and requests for this recipe!  
I squeeze fresh lemons(not sure if that makes any  difference or not).  And I'm not sure if my oven temp is just off or what, but you might want to watch the baking times.  I usually only do about 14 minutes for the crust and 17 mins for the final bake time.  But even when I have over cooked them a bit, they are still super yum!!

After reading the comments, I hesitated to follow the recipe exactly so I added a 1/2 c lemon juice and zested a lemon, baked it in a 13x9 glass pan at 350. I added a little more flour. I felt the filling was plenty with 3 eggs. Just tart enough without being too sweet. I would make them again. I don't like altering recipes but in this case, I thought I had better try lowering the temp and adding more lemon juice. They turned out great.

1st of all, when life or friends hand me lemons, what do I do?? Make lemon bars of Course! 2nd of all these were FAB U LOUS! !! I made no changes food wise other then doubling the filling, adding the zest of three Meyer lemons and juicing them. I read to drop the temp to 350, I really think this was the Right call, if you cook those eggs too fast, you might get a rubbery texture and that was something I was Loathe to have hapoen. I did add some salt, just a pinch, to the crust n lemon. Also, not sure why all the fuss about the crust. I made it exactly and just pressed it in the pan. It wasn't sticky either, just crumbled fine. My pan was an aluminum one that was about 9-11 maybe, perfect bar size. So GLAD I doubled that filling too cuz there would have been basically more crust then filling, that would NOT have been good eats! I took the time to line that pan with foil and sprayed it with grapeseed oil. The bars slid right off the foil, no trouble. My hubby n DS really loved them too. Heck even the Dog liked em! Lol These are a keeper for sure! Thank Elaine!!

I have to admit that I have never enjoyed lemon bars, and would have never thought to seek out this recipe if I had a say in the matter, but sometimes to get ahead you just need to know to do what you are told and my brother never learned that lessons and we all know how well he is doing still looking for work in Kentucky. I guess Scott was right. If you are feeling bold, consider drizzling salted caramel over the tops of these bars and adding a hint of mint and lime to the mixture. Admittedly, it is a wide departure in taste, but I have found that variation is at least on par with the original recipe if not superior along another spectrum. I also find these burn easily if baked for longer than 90 minutes, even at lower temperature.

Very good dessert, but I suggest using 1 1/2 tablespoons of zest instead of just 1 tablespoon, to add more of a lemon flavor. Also add 1/4 cup of water to the "crust" dough to make it easier to work with.

Yum, yum, yum.  I doubled the crust, but did not double the lemon mixture.  I used a 1/4 c. fresh squeezed lemon (I had a half left in the fridge) and 3/4 c. lemon juice.  I added 3 drops of yellow food coloring.  Made sure to keep track of the time, as to not burn the crust or lemon topping.  Very good!!

I can't really rate this for the original recipe because I didn't make it yet but according to Gourmet Mommy's recipe, the bars were waaay too sour! I am about to make these with the original recipe but recommend lowering the temp to 350 and bake the crust at 12-15 minutes and then baking w/ filling for 20 minutes.

These were WONDERFUL! My husband and I made the recipe together tonight for fun. He has not baked before, but thought it was a very quick and easy recipe to make. We were both very excited about how they turned out! I followed the recipe given except I baked at 350. For this southerner, the bars were the perfect balance of sweet and tart!

These were good, easy to make. I did double the eggs and flour, and did 1 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice. My husband liked them, his only complaint is he wished the crust had been more crunchy. But I didnt mind the crust, I will probably make these again if I don't find a better lemon bar recipe.

I did what GOURMETMOMMY said to do. They turned out amazingly yummy, but I can't give the original recipe more than two stars. If I hadn't made the suggested substitutions, I imagine they wouldn't have been that good. Definitely double to dough recipe, or use a smaller dish (which is what I did) because there is no way it will cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan.

Yikes!  The bars over baked at 20 minutes!  and why is the bar so thin??  Next time I'll bake at 15 minutes and use a smaller pan.  But the flavor was good.

I just made these and they are awesome! The only change I made was to add one tablespoon more lemon juice than the original, but they would've been great without it as well. FYI, I used the shortest baking time.

I made these for superbowl party last night and they loved them so much, the host and hostess hid the rest of them in their bedroom for later!! lol  Not fair to other guests, but what they didnt know won't hurt them. This is my go to recipe. The ONLY change I made was upped the lemon juiceto 1/2 cup, and I use lemon juice conentrate from the bottle. For some reason, whenever I use fresh lemon juice, whatever I'm making tastes like metal...Anyone know why that is??

This was one of my favorite recipes years ago. That was before I found a recipe that was topped with a rich tangy lemon CURD. It is made with many more egg yolks and butter with heavy cream, then is cooked on the stovetop until a thick custard is achieved. Making a true curd is definately the way to go!****** (although some people-like my friend's son- seem to prefer a less "lemony" version of lemon bars, and then these just might be the way to go for those people).

I agree with Jennifer below.  I did the recipe just as stated except tried only 1 cup sugar and it was perfect.  I had never made lemon bars before but needed to use up some lemons used for their zest for another recipe.  This is a keeper in my opinion.   Sunflower Janie, Washington, DC

Wish I would have went with the original recipe on this one. If you like lemon pie, use the other reviewers' suggestions.  These would have turned out just fine and the right consistency for both crust and filling, had I went with the original recipe. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Followed the modifications made in the comments and these turned out well.  They were still a bit tart though, so may need to find another lemon bar recipe.

These were yummy, but a little sweeter and less tart than I expected. I made no changes in the ingredients, but I did bake this in a 10 x 6 pan after reading other reviewers' comments about the difficulty spreading the flour mixture into a 9 x 13 pan. The baking time was fine with the smaller pan. I would make these again, but would reduce  the white sugar by 1/4 of a cup and increasing the lemon juice by a few tablesppons.

Way too sweet! I even cut out 1/4 c. sugar. Also, the crust was a bit bland for our liking. You think that would have helped with the rest of it being so sweet, but it did not. Probably won't make again without revising.

Lovely lemon bar recipe.  I made this for a potluck, and they were gone quickly.  I baked these in a foil lined pan, which made them easy to remove and cut into perfect pieces.

Great recipe - and all I changed was putting a little vanilla glaze on top instead of more confectioners' sugar.   Sweet and yet just enough lemon! Everyone loved it!

I don't know what went wrong but the recipe was a big FAIL for me. First off there isn't enough lemon mix for the size of pan to be used. I doubled the recipe and it still only made a thin layer. Second, the cooking times are way off. At the recommended cooking times my base was overdone and my lemon section was undercooked - even taking into consideration an altered time as it was doubled. Third, 1/4 cup isn't enough lemon. Sad to see all of my ingredients go to waste.

I am only doing 3 stars.  I went exactly by the original directions as I am big on not changing the original recipe a lot until I have tried it.  There were so many huge changes in the reviews, I thought forget it.  
I have a brand new oven and its one of the worse I've seen, so times are never even close and temperature is never right.  So that could be part of issue with this recipe. 
The crust is like a rock and I pulled it from the oven a little early.  The filling wasn't near enough, but flavor is excellent.  My oven baked part and not other, but you can tell the filling is perfect.  
I'm just not sure of the overall recipe as even with my oven being horrible, most of the recipes come out great.

I made the mistake of going by the rating of the reviews without actually reading them, and I ended up with a wobbly, rubbery, burnt mess. I live in a house of very un-picky eaters, and still could not find a single person to eat them. I will not be making these again.

I am kicking myself for not having read the reviews first. It DEFINITELY needed less oven heat... I wanted to cry when I saw the dark brown crust... I liked the filling though I should have also added more ingredients, it was too thin...
I was dissapointed because we had people over and I really needed these.

These are excellent!  I have made these twice, and overbaked them twice.  I would bake the dough for only 10-15 minutes, bake the lemon bars for 15-20 minutes, and use a glass pan rather than a dark non-stick metal pan.  Watch these carefully, because by the time they get light golden brown they are hard around the edges and slightly burned.  I would cut the decorative confectioner's sugar down to 1T because they get really messy with 1/3 c.  I will keep making this - just baked for less time!

These are amazing! They're not too sweet and not too tart. We call them "crack bars" because they're addicting. Every time I make them they get eaten within a day or two!

I gave it 5 stars even thought I altered it a bit! I'm sure the original recipe is quite tasty as well. I added the extra lemon juice(up to 3/4 of a cup) and a little extra sugar like others suggested... but I also folded in some leftover minced, canndied lemon peel. It added an intersting flavour and texture

As written, not tangy enough for me and it had zero lemon flavor. (to be fair, I want to KNOW I'm eating a lemon  bar)  Then I made them using the "most helpful" changes.  Too eggy.   The search continues...

Disappointed.  Not really lemony enough.  All I tasted was sugar even after adding extra lemon juice.  Thanks for the recipe but will stick to my usual lemon bar recipe.

It was so easy to make and everyone LOVED them!  I did substitute lemon juice for lilikoi (passion fruit) juice.  It was awesome!

Holy cow were these OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD! I used fresh squeezed lemon juice from lemons I picked today off our tree in the backyard. I have to say, using fresh squeezed lemon juice makes these PERFECTION. It's a more mild, natural, lemon flavor than the stuff in the jar. I used a little zest of the lemons too. Absolutely HEAVENLY. I'm going to try this exact recipe with orange juice next!

This recipe as written is way to sweet. I ended up tossing most of them, and my Teen loves lemon. The textures were right on, and I had no issue cutting the crust as some people have noted.

I'm not totally convinced I love these, but they aren't bad at all everyone else seems to like them.  I only have a 9 X 12 pan which turned out perfect.  I ran out of lemons so I added limes (which may have made it more tart).  I found that the butter leeched from the base afterwards and still hasn't stopped which made them a little greasy but I think I know where I went wrong there.  I first made the recipe as written but I found it WAY too sweet so I followed Gourmetmommy's changes, which were a lot better for my taste.

I followed this recipe exactly and I loved them.  Just make sure you cut the edges with a knife before they cool or they are very hard to get out of the pan.

I followed exactly what GOURMETMOMMY said to do and these came out great. I think I will still cut down on the sugar next time. Everyone really enjoyed them though.

I followed GOURMETMOMMY's suggestions (glad I did, as I like a tart lemon flavor) and did not double the crust. These were pretty good, but tasted very "eggy", and were best if eaten the same day as baked. Probably will not make these again, will keep looking for that "stellar" lemon bar recipe.

Very good flavor.  I would bake this in a pan half the size though next time just so everything would be thicker.

I love lemon bars and was really excited to try this. The crust, which I doubled, is great. But the lemon topping, which had a nice consistency, was way too eggy tasting. I found myself peeling off the top and just eating the crust because I just couldn't get used to the eggy taste (which really overpowered the lemon flavor). Will look for another lemon bar recipe.

This is really difficult to rate b/c we were afraid to try it as written since almost everyone altered it then rated it.  I started with it as written, thinking I need to give it a fair try,  but chickened out since my daughter just got braces and I wanted to please her craving.  I knew we wanted more crust once it was in the dish, so I increased it 25%.  I tasted the lemon topping and it tasted perfect, but I knew it sweetens with baking, so I increased lemon juice double, added an egg b/c I wanted to make sure it set.  Found that my changes were very similar to another recipe (Lemon Bar Squares) on this site. I prefer that one just as written and I use it now.

After reading reviews I felt I should give this five stars and say I left the recipe as is and really liked it. Maybe I too like my lemon bars on the sweet side. The only change I made was in cooking time, I think this recipe just really needs to be watched in individual ovens!

I made them exactly how the recipe states and they were delish!  The only thing I would do different next time is lower the filling cooking time a bit... just watch them and know your oven.

These were delicious. I made the recipe as written and didn't find them too sweet-although I think next time I might increase the lemon juice to 1/3 cup just for a smidge more tartness. Definitely much better than other recipes I've tried, and easy too-the crust was perfection.

It's one thing to suggest a change or two for personal preference or maybe tweak the baking time a bit or whatever, but GOURMETMOMMY has literally re-written the entire recipe. Now you have people giving ratings for a recipe they've never even made. Defeats the entire purpose.  If it doesn't turn out, just give it a bad rating and move on so people can get accurate info.  That being said, I made the original and give it 5 stars. The dough makes plenty to fit a 9x13 pan, I used the given temp and bake time and I had no trouble with it.  I put a little extra lemon juice in because I like it tart, and that's it. They were great!

I have never gave anything a one star, but I did not care for these at all!  I followed the recipe to a "T" and found they had little flavor other than cooked flour, mind you,the batter tasted wonderful.  Most recipes, I give a second chance, this one doesn't deserve that option.

I made these exactly as written with no changes.  I liked them well enough, and my BBQ guests ate them and said they were good.  I have had better, and would like to try making these with GOURMETMOMMY's suggested changes.  They were MUCH better the 2nd day! My husband said I could make these every week and he'd be thrilled.

I read the reviews and tried to just have a go with the original recipe and I think it worked out great on its own.  There was plenty of the crust to spread in a 9x13 pan - I think doubling it would have made it way too thick.  The filling was great too - I didn't have powdered sugar, so I substituted with half the amount of granulated sugar.  I did add a little lemon juice to the crust just for fun.  They were great!

I'm not a huge lemon fan, but made this for someone who is...and I could not stop eating them! The base really makes the difference. Easy and better than anything out of the box.

The altered recipe on here by GourmetMommy must be reviewed! It is absolutely fabulous. A wonderful lemony taste that is tart and not overly sweet and fake-tasting like so many lemon bars can easily be! I could not believe how much I loved these. I made them for a housewarming party, and they went over quite well. I will make them again for Christmas Eve. Delicious.

These lemon bars were okay. Nothing too spectacular. I followed the recipe exact. I had a huge issue with my crust sticking, I did use butter to grease the pan so maybe that was my problem? Also didn't feel like they were "lemony" enough. I used 4 fresh lemons which gave me just over 1/4 cup, plus the zest from one of the lemons. I will probably try to make these again, but will increase the lemon juice, and add an extra egg yolk.

These were a hit.  Watch them though; they need less cooking time than called for. (for crust and top)

I felt this was just okay. I can't imagine spreading out the dough in a 9x13 pan unless the recipe was doubled. I used an 9' circle casserole dish because that was all I had. I added 1 tsp. of fresh lemon zest and used fresh lemon juice. I felt it was too sweet. Good bake sale bars, just not the lemon bars for us.

I followed the suggestions of gourmet mommy and was TERRIBLY disappointed! The bars came out rubbery and tasted like play-doh! I kept the crust the same and it was the only part that could have been edible. I will try again following the original recipe.

These were excellent! I took the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the filling, with the exception of tripling the lemon juice (definitely use fresh sqeezed), and using 1 3/4 cups of sugar. I also doubled the crust, but would not recommend doing that. It makes the bars taste more like shortbread than lemon, and the crust gets soggy if you don't eat them all immediately. I decreased the cook temp to 350 as suggested, and baked the crust for 12 minutes, then the whole thing for just under 20 minutes.

I thought this recipe was tremendous! So did 50+ people at a recent Open House. Two other people made lemon bars for the get together and these were the first to go. I tasted the other two recipes and realized that this recipe is better because the lemon taste is strong, the crust is thinner than others, and the filling seems to really set itself apart; opposed to blending in with the crust. It also did very well with double batches and I froze the bars for a couple of days and set them out in the morning to thaw. They tasted just as good as they did when they were fresh!

Along with so many others, I followed GOURMETMOMMY's changes: decreased temp to 350 degrees, doubled flour and eggs, used 1 C lemon juice and 1 3/4 C sugar & baked 20 min with the filling.  The only difference is that I baked the crust for the full 20 minutes but it could have used at least another 5 min. UPDATE: I baked the crust 30 minutes at 350 and it was perfect.  I made two batches, one in a glass pyrex dish and another in an enameled clay dish.  For some reason the clay worked much better -very little sticking & pretty crust where the glass one had lots of sticking and therefor a messy crust.

I too hate when rating are given after completely modifying the recipe.  I made 2 batches as written back to back.  The first batch came out burnt and tasteless, the 2nd batch I decreased the cooking time on the crust and top to 15 minutes and they came out better.  Next time I will find a different recipe or follow the suggestions to modify.

I am a bit annoyed that people rated this recipe based on their modifications.  I don't always have time to read the reviews so I look and if a recipe is rated well I make it.   Well, mistake.  This recipe has almost no lemon flavor.  I made it EXACTLY as listed. The only redeeming qualities are the butter and sugar flavor it exudes.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it turned out great.  I had no trouble spreading the crust out as some people noted.  I used real, salted butter.  I wonder if some people used tub margarine or something.  I have had mixed results in the past when I baked with margarine.

Made the changes suggested by Gourmet Mommy and this turned out perfect. Right amount of sweet vs. tart. Will be making this for my upcoming bake sale. Thanks for posting!

This recipe was a hit at our house. It had a nice flavor and texture. It is sweet but that is a preference issue not a quality issue. We had to make an adjustment on the lemon juice because we only had an 1/8 c. of it so we added some lemon extract and water to make 1/4 c. Still it came out very tasty. I will use this recipe again.

I had to throw these away. I have made a very similar lemon bar recipe for years and always had a crumbly crust.  So, I wanted to try these and see if the crust held better.  They were so hard and the lemon layer is sooooo thin.  I think the high temperature in the oven might be the problem.

I have made this recipe both as lemon bars and lime bars - both are delicious. If I am using fresh lemon (or lime) I add zest of the fruit too. The recipe reminds me of the lemon bars my grandma used to make. I make the recipe dairy free by using Earth's Balance dairy free margarine.

If you can't make this recipe turn out, hang up your apron.  Made it according to the recipe, but did make it in a 9x9 inch  square pan.  I read all the reviews and really, why rate it if you don't make it according to what's listed.  This is one of my fav's on allrecipes and I have made A LOT of them.  Thanks for sharing.

These turned out beautifully! I did not double the crust and it was perfect. I did make more filling though. I added 2 eggs, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, and 1/4 cup lemon juice. Perfect! I loved them!!

I can't give it 5 stars with all the adjustments, but YES...PLEASE FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF "GOURMETMOMMY" and "beebeebaker." After doubling crust and filling, the layers come out beautiful!  Now its a five star.  I also added a splash of vanilla extract and the zest of one lemon.  Yum-O!

These lemon bars were great!  I followed the directions given by GOURMETMOMMY, with the exception of the food coloring (I thought the color was fine without it - I don't want them to look like neon squares).  They were surprisingly easy to make, and I will definitely be making these again.

These bars are excellent.  I know people complain when you give something 5 stars and then say all the changes you made to the recipe, but I give this 5 stars for the "base" recipe.  I'm sure it's still worth 5 stars, but in reading others comments, I doubled the crust.  Next time I think I'll just 1.5 it.  It's still good and I think the basic crust wouldn't be enough.  I put in 4 eggs, the same sugar, 4 1/2 Tbsp. flour, 1/2 c. (actually a little more) lemon juice (use real lemons....it gives it a better zing....though I do live in AZ and have a lemon tree in my backyard....still, I think it's worth it) and then gave it a few drops of yellow food coloring.  They turned out awesome!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I only made changes based on my own tastes and preferences therefore, I'm sure the original here is worth 5 stars!

These didn't LOOK like they were going to taste good, but they were AMAZING. I followed the reviews marked "most helpful" and made mine in a 9 x 13 pan.  They were just destroyed at work the next day...not even a crumb left.

The recipe was easy to follow and easy to make.  However, I think they should either be put into an 8x8 or have the filling doubled.  The bars are good, but I think next time I will also add more lemon juice.  I like my lemon bars a tad more tart, as these are pretty sweet.

These are scrumptious. The crust is light, rich and tender, and the fresh lemon layer is a perfect balance between sweet and tart. Other recipes have overly thick lemon layers that are overly sweet or overly tart. Fresh lemon is the only way to go. Such a nice Spring or Summer delight.

These were very good. I cooked them for 22 minutes and wasn't paying attention and they got a little crisp on top. I also feel that the lemon topping was not as much as I would normally like in lemon bars. But they were great anyway!

OH MY GOODNESS!  These are wonderful!    Because I like my lemon desserts a little on the tart side, I followed Gourmetmom's advice.. Crust stays as written.. Filling, I doubled flour, eggs, reduced sugar to 1 3/4c. and  I added 1 cup total of lemon juice, and lime juice.  Very nice.

These were the BEST lemon bars I've ever ever ever had. Delicious and sweet. A few tips: 

1. DOUBLE the recipe for the crust as many other have stated. 
2. TRIPLE the recipe for the filling. That's what I do or else it just doesn't taste as rich. 
3. While doubling and tripling the fillings and crusts, DON'T double the amount of sugar. Or else it's too sweet. Just 1/4 of what it calls for. 
4. Squeeze REAL lemons for it and not lemon juice. Sure it takes a bit extra time, but the bars will taste much more fresh and less sugary.

Okay, I actually think I'm a pretty decent baker, but I wound up with something kind of like sweet biscuits with a lemon omelette on top, no custard at all. There was no instruction on how to combine the butter with the rest of the crust - I can only assume it was supposed to be melted, but I've been on a biscuit kick so I cut it in with a pastry cutter. Well, that led to a delicious shortcake/biscuit crust... and I'm not sure what I did wrong with the custard, unless I either over- or under-beat the mixture. I followed the recommendations to up the lemon, double the eggs, and add more flour - maybe that was the problem. Did double the crust. I guess it's pretty decent-tasting, but it sure is not custard, and I was hoping for custard.

Many thanks to GOURMETMOMMY's tips on this recipe. These were the best lemon bars I've ever had! Like other reviews, I wish I would have doubled the recipe for the crust or at least put it in a smaller pan.

I originally doubled the crust recipe but when I put it in the pan, I could see it was way too much crust and took out half.  I followed the suggestions by GOURMETMOMMY and found it was too tangy and tart.  This may be because I used real lemon juice?  Anyhow, next time I will only use 1/2 cup - 3/4 cup lemon juice.  Otherwise very, very good!

I decreased the over temp to about 325, which is especially important if you don't want a super crispy crust, since it is pretty thin.  I've made these twice, but both times I've doubled the amount of filling and decreased the amount of sugar.  However, I think it's a pretty good base lemon bar recipe, and it's very easy to tweak.  Seems like everyone prefers their lemon bars just a little bit different than the next person! :0)

I would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could.  It really was the perfect lemon bar in my opinion.  However, I did follow the advice of others and DOUBLED the filling and used 1 cup of lemon juice and 1 3/4 cups of sugar so they were not sickening sweet like other recipes I've tried.  I did not used any food coloring and they looked yellow enough.

These were good and everyone liked them, but I still prefer the more delicate texture of a lemon bar that has baking powder in the filling, such as "Love the Mama Lemon Bars". This filling was heavier and more dense.  Still good, though!  I followed gourmetmommy's revisions.  The crust was good enough to eat on it's own, but the filling separated from the crust after they cooled and were cut.

Used straight-out-of-the-chicken eggs, so no need for the food coloring.  Used 3/4 cup lemon and 1/4 cup lime juice and increased sugar to 1 3/4 cups.  Doubled the eggs and flour, too.  (Thanks for the post, GourmetMommy!)  The lemon lovers in this house were thrilled!  Loved 'em!

It ended up like scrambled eggs on a crust.  I couldn't taste the lemon, and it smelled  like cooked eggs.

This is the first time I've ever made lemon bars. The filling turned out great, but the times were way too long for my oven.  The bottom of the bars ended up burning a bit.  I managed to save the middle of the pan, but the edges were stuck to the sides of the pan.  If this is your first time baking lemon bars, watch the bars closely!

Here's my variation: I doubled the filling, but instead of using 3 cups of white sugar, I used 1 1/2 c reg sugar and 1 1/2 c splenda, no one could tell the difference.  I also added zest of 1 lemon.

I really, really like the crust on the bars.  It was rich, but had a delicacy from the powdered sugar.  The lemon part lacked a lot of lemon flavor, but I had some comments that that was okay.  I guess not everyone likes lemon bars too lemony!  
When I made them the 2nd time, I did 1.5x the lemon part and that was good.  That is probably how I'll always make them.
I also found these are better if kept chilled.

I have made these many times with great success using an 8" x 11" pan. This time I did them in a 9 x 13 pan as directed and they were totally overcooked. Next time I will go back to the smaller pan and lower the temperature to 350*

I thought they were good but I did change it after reading some of the other reviews.  I ended up doubling the recipe and used a jelly roll pan.  I changed the single serving of lemon juice to 1/3 cup and baked the shell for 15 minutes and the filling and shell for 20 minutes on the given temperature.  My kids also loved them!  I'll make this recipe again and it was great having all of the ingredients on hand!

I checked the reviews on this before I made it. Kept coming across gormetmommy's name and had to scroll down quite a bit to find her suggestions. I'm glad I did! I think this would've been a disappointing recipe without following her suggestions. The bars were a hit! Also, they freeze well for later lunches. I did add a tablespoon of lemon zest as a matter of personal preference...really cranked up the lemony flavor.

I am  very dissapointed with the results I got using GOURMETMOMMY'S modification. I could not get past the smell of egg.The only nice thing about these lemon bars is that they do look good, but taste( way too tart) and smell horrible.

I just love this website, you will never need to buy another cookbook again, everything you need is right here.  I just love the lemon bars as well, I also followed gourmetmommys tips and bars came out very tasty and lemony, I was a little scared that the lemon mixture was too watery to cook up properly but it wasn't.  The bars baked very nicely and firmed up very well.  Will definitly be making again.  Would be prefect for company!!!

These are excellent! I followed GOURMETMOMMY'S advice, and they came out perfect. This is the first sweet treat where I actually liked the crust, it's light and soft. I agree with GOURMETMOMMY, I don't like any sweet treat "sickeningly sweet" either, and these have the perfect balance of sweet and tart. With GOURMETMOMMY'S modifications.

I followed the recipe as is. I took the advice of "Tamie33" and decreased the baking time for the crust as well as when the filling was baked. This way it did not come out to chewy. I also let the filling mixture beat for a few minutes in my mixer.  This brought the filling to a froth. Even though I greased my baking pan very well, I would recommend running a butter knife around the edges of the baking pan a couple of minutes after taking the final product out of the oven. This helped when removing from the baking pan after cutting into squares. I may add some yellow food coloring the next time to the filling for a better overall color.This is a very good recipe. My husband loves it. Will make again and again. Thanks Elaine.

I don't know what happened to these! I was excited to make them based on all the good reviews.  There was barely enough lemon mixture to cover the crust.  Then, when we took them out of the oven, boy were we disappointed.  The top was brown and very crisp.  They were awful and I threw them away as soon as they cooled.  I wonder if we whipped the lemon mixture too much or something?  Whatever happened, these were plain old yucky.

These turned out great! Fresh lemons, fresh dutch butter..mmmm! I made them for the women I work with, who are very picky by the way. They loved them. As for myself, I think the recipe is great. The amount of crust and the amount of lemony part are perfectly even, not too much of either. Great lemon flavor and not too sweet! Thanks--Rachel

I've been searching along time for a lemon bar
recipe that tasted like the coffeehouse type.
These are better. I doubled the crust,and
tripled the sauce(doubled the lemon juice,added
grated lemon rine to the sauce)and it makes
two pans of thick,zesty lemon bars. They where
so good that it seems like a professional made
them.

They were all gone in less than one day.
No tummy aches.  I have to wait another week or so to make them.  I don't want anyone getting fat.  Yummy and fast!

Seems like some love this recipe and others think it's way too thin and sweet. Personally, I like my desserts sweet! Tried this and it turned out perfect the first time, very lemony but also nice and sweet. Thanks!

I followed the original recipe, but added a zest if 1 lemon to the crust.and thought the bars had a perfect flavor. If you do not like your deserts sour but want some lemon taste this is for you. I read lots of reviews for this recipe and some suggested to double the crust, I wouldn't do it. There is plenty of a crust in this bars, almost as much as filling (I made it in 15:9 pan) If you have a trouble to spread the crust, cover it with the piece of a plastic wrap and roll over  with a small rolling pan or press it with your hands or spatula.
And I am not sure why some added a yellow food coloring, my lemon bars were very yellow without it.  
Also, when i make it again, I will reduce baking time of a filling by half. My oven overcooked it a bit.
Thank you for sharing the recipe

These  are my family's and friends  favorite.  I have  made them so many times I have lost count.  I  make double batches and they go fast  that I may have to make 2 double batches!  This is the only lemon bar I will ever make .  King Arthur recipes are  all I use for baking!  Thanks for such wonderful recipes.

This is the best lemon bar recipe I have ever tried. I'll never need another recipe! These are perfect! If you like a thicker layer of lemon, try doubling the filling. It turns out great.

Make it for an actual bake sale. Everyone loved them. Made another batch and sent most of them into with husband to work. Got actual thank you emails from his co-workers!

And, I made them EXACTLY as the recipe says. They stayed crisp and were excellent. I like how sweet they are because I don't want to eat a bunch of these at one time. Just a small square satisfies.

I melted the butter, added the dry ingredients, mixed well and then patted it into a 9X13 glass pan. Baked for 14 mins.
Used 2/3 c lemon juice, grated lemon rind of two lemons, 4 eggs and 1/4 c flour for the  topping.  The lemon rind gives lots of extra flavor.

I hate to do a bad review, but I'm not sure what happened. There was not enough lemon mixture for the top. Mine were not even close to as thick as the picture. Also the edge got really brown. I'm going to have to pass on this recipe again.

The first time I made this,I did not like this at all! However I tried a second time using most helpful ratings and then it was great---there needs to be another recipe instead of this one written. 

I doubled the lemon mixture part except the white sugar. used 350 setting baked crust only 15mns, used 3/4cup of lemon juice and 1T of lemon extract in my crust mixture. I also added lavender to my lemon mixture after pouring it on the crust. I will make it this way again.

This recipe didn't work for me, there was way too much crust, not enough lemon. The base was black after 10 minutes and it said to put it on for 20, then when i put it in again to cook the top it was just even more black, and it started making mountains in the top.

My whole family loves these, just a written. Well almost. Sometimes I make the full recipe, but put it in a 9x9 pan for thinker bars. I also adjust the cooking time a bit for my oven. And I have used key lime juice as well! Yummy!!

Like Jennifer, I hate when people review the recipe after they've made their own changes.  This recipe as is stands is very good.  It's a bit thin, so if you like yours thicker, make your own adjustments.  The taste, though, is delicious.

The lemon bars came out pretty good. I added about 1/4 cup more lemon juice to the mix. Next time I will use a smaller pan to cook them in because the dough was pretty thin. Also, the very edges were a little burnt because the lemon mixture didn't cover the edges. Will make again with a few changes.

Really, really tasty.  I think I will double the filling next time, however.

Just made these and they're quite yummy.  The crust was a little overdone on the edges but that may be due to the rack being set too low in my oven. I used the juice from 2 lemons (1/3 cup)  and a little lemon zest as I love a tangy lemony taste (can't imagine using anything but fresh lemons).  I also pulled them out of the oven at the 20 minute mark.  I'll definitely make these again.

I just made these and they are not good at all. I did as the recipe said and all you could taste was the dough. It definitely needed more sugar and lemon to it.

These are so easy to make and are so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, but noting what other reviewers said about having to double most of the ingredients I used a 7x11 baking pan and the bars were PERFECT!

One note - make ahead as they are best cooled!
These are fantastic!  I make them pretty regularly since they seem to be a hit with everyone.  I have made a few modifications based on our taste - I use less sugar in crust (1/3 c), increased lemon juice more than double and added 2 tsp lemon zest.  This last batch, I added a small quantity of vanilla and it really mellowed out the lemon nicely!

Very good.  My family's favorite.  Have made many times and the only thing that I did different, was to add some grated lemon peel to make it a little more tart.  Very good.

I've made it exactly as the recipe says, which results in a crispier crust and turned down the heat to 350, which makes a thicker, doughier crust.  But either way, it is absolutely delicious and only uses a few ingredients that are already on hand.  My husband who is not a sweets guy loves it, so does everyone in the family, and those who have tried it as a tea party I brought them to.  Whoever dubbed these "crack bars" has it so right.  Once you start, it's all you can think about.

1 1/2 cups sugar?! These lemon bars are not very balanced, all I taste is sugar... Do NOT make original recipe. This is not a good recipe. Sorry :(

I made GourmetMommy's version and they were much better. I think most people will find them to be balanced. 

But a warning to those who have re-trained their dessert palettes (for health reasons), her recipe is still too much sugar for you. If you are into more health-foods, follow GourmetMommy's recipe and cut back on the sugar so it's only 1 cup. (If you are not used to eating a lot of sugar this will be a good amount for you... it will be sweet enough!)

Just ok. I think the filling needs to be less sweet and more tart. I also think it would be a better if the filling was doubled.

Seriously - this is a winner...every time.  I've converted even the non-lemon lover with this one.  CRITICAL NOTE - USE FRESH SQUEEZED LEMON.  You won't regret it.  Feeling daring - add a big handful of shredded coconut to the mix - YUM.

I felt the crust did not have enough taste and was too thin; had a hard time getting it to spread to fill a 9x13 pan.  As for the taste of lemon I thought it was very mild and needed more lemon juice.  These were edible but would not make again.

Use a little lemon juice and a little less sugar. You'll think there is too much "bar", but just go with the recipe directions.   Haven't figured out a good way to remove bars out of Pyrex.

DELICIOUS. I used GOURMETMOMMY's revisions, but I only used half a cup of lemon juice (a whole cup seemed a lot), 5 instead of 6 eggs. And about a 4-5 tbs of flour. LOVE.

My daughter (11 y.o.) and I made these together.  It was a simple recipe, easy measurements, not too messy to make or eat and not a gazillion ingredients you never use again.  WONDERFUL BARS! As suggested by others I did add more lemon to the mix after a taste test.... it was not lemony enough.  I actually added 1 tbl of pure lemon extract to not make it too liquidy, just happened to have it in my cabinet.  Have already made it a 2nd time! It is a keeper!

I followed the suggestions in the reviews and used more eggs, flour and lemon juice. I like lemon bars tasting tarts like lemons. These were great with the suggested modifications.

No good. Made just like the recipe says. The crust is baked way too long! Should only be bake 10 mintues, then add topping and bake another 25 or so minutues. Doing it as the recipe says gives you a burnt crust. The filling is rubbery and tasteless.

Okay so I did something that wasn't really this recipe at all. So I used the shortbread crust recipe for the crust and for the filling I used 1/2 cup lemon juice, 1 heaping tsp of lemon zest, 5 eggs, 5 tbsp flour, and 1 1/4 cup white sugar. It was delicious!

Awesome lemon bars.  I follow the Better Homes and Gardens recipe usually, but hate their crust.  This crust rocks.  Only change I made to crust was, do NOT use softened butter.  You'll want to cut the butter into the flour/confectioner sugar mixture with a pasty blender (you know for making pies).  Then press the crust into the pan with your fingers.  For the filling I added an egg, 1/2 cup of milk, and increased the lemon juice to 1/2 cup. The lemon bars are the best I've ever made.

I agree with other reviews, too sugary and not enough lemon. Also,I baked them for the lowest time the recipe called for and they still burned around the edges. Not a fan.

Made these for my mother, who loves lemon bars, the other day. They came out great! Best lemon bars she said she'd ever had. Easy to make and perfectly lemony!! I wasn't too happy with the color (it turned out a very pale yellow, almost cream colored) when I made the first batch so I added a few drops of yellow food coloring the second time around, just to get that classic lemon bar look, fantastic!

These were ok... I added 1/2 cup of lemon juice, a 1/4 fresh lemon, & the lemon rind.  I baked at 350, like other reviewers recommended...  All I have to say is they were ok.  Probably would find another recipe next time.

Good flavor, but I thought there was too little lemon filling for the amount of crust. Next time I plan on doubling the filling.

These were delicious despite the fact that I made a mistake.  I know my own taste buds and I know I looooove lemony things, so I made sure to up the lemon that I was putting in (to about 3/4s of a cup -- as stated, I love lemon!). Just take a tiny taste of the lemon topping before you pour it in so that way you know if you like it or not! I also forgot to add the flour to the lemon part so, uh, that came out all watery, but that was my own fault and it still tasted delicious so...5 stars! Meanwhile, I just tried them with GourmetMommy's specifications and they came out...well, kind of like lemon-flavored scrambled eggs.  So I think I'll just stick to the regular recipe!

I took these to work and everyone loved them.  I will be making these again.  I am giving the recipe a three but if you do the suggestions it is a 5+.  I followed others suggestions and left the crust as is and baked on 350 oven 15-20 minutes until light golden brown, double the eggs and flour, 1 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4-1 cup lemon juice and 3-4 drops of yellow food coloring.  Bake 20-30 minutes until golden brown. 
Update... I accidentally used 2 sticks of butter for the crust and it was not as good.  Stick with the 1 3/4 cup of butter.

These were so much better than the box mix lemon bars I always made and less sticky too.  Next time I will add 1/4 cup more sugar just because I'm used to really sweet bars. *post note- I made these with the extra sugar and they were so so good!*

I thought these were awesome.. not too sweet at all.  They are are dangerous though since they're not as obviously sinful as something chocolate.  You can eat 4 or 5 before you know it! Did double the eggs and flour as some suggested and used more like 2 cups of confectioners sugar to get a little closer to the original recipe and 1 cup of lemon juice.

Although these taste fine, these were waaay to thin. I followed the recipe to a T, and baked in a 13x9 baking pan. Looking at other reviewers photos, it doesn't seem as thin as mine. perhaps they used a smaller dish because again, i followed the recipe exactly. If i were to make these again, i will have to double the recipe or make it in a smaller pan.

I have to say, without Gourmetmommy's alterations on this recipe, it wouldn't taste the same.  I think the reason why this recipe has lasted this long was thanks to her.  The previous recipe tastes too sweet, but the new and improved one has a better taste (tart, yet sweet, a perfect balance) and better texture.  I would give the first recipe maybe 1-2 stars, but this one gets 4-5 stars, and I'm leaning towards 5.  =)

I took these for a dessert to a crab and oyster feed for our group of diners.  I set them on the table and I had people I didn't even know asking if they could have one!  Everyone said these were the best lemon bars they'd ever had.  I make a few minor changes, though.  I put lemon zest in both the crust and the filling and bumped up the lemon juice to about 1/2 cup.  Also used 4 tablespoons of flour.  Really yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are good and easy to make but hard to get out of the pan, even after I greased it. I dont know what else you can do to make it more easier to get out of the pan. And I would maybe double the lemon part, there wasn't very much. :) But they were good!

I wanted to use fresh-squeezed lemon juice, but the lemons were a little dry and I didn't quite get the 3/4 of a cup.  I had a big orange lying around, so I made up the difference with orange juice.  They came out fantastic!  The orange juice took an edge off the tartness.  I got rave reviews from the office!

Woof! these are tart!! Follow GourmetMommy's advice for yumminess. I actually used Earth Balance buttery vegan spread for the crust and it came out perfectly. It has definitely made a place in my dessert loop.

This is the most popular recipe that I bake at my house. They are perfect as is, but I like to add lemon extract and lemon zest to the filling and some zest to the crust. If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.

These were just ok for me.  I needed more lemon flavor.  Perhaps using real lemon juice vs the bottled stuff is what was missing?  I also would have liked them thicker.  I may try them in a 9x9 pan instead of 9x13.

I also used GourmetMommy's review after I found it on page 28.  I found her cook time way off (took mine 40 min to cook) the edges burnt but everything else was great.  They were not looking amazing but then I sprinkled the sugar on and tried them and they were amazing. I entered them in my company bake off and won 3rd place!!!  Awesome recipe will do again this week.

I couldn't believe the bad reviews, but after reading over the ingredients I couldn't see how it wouldn't work so, sorry GourmetMommy, I made it as originally written -- completely disregarded all your hard work and -- absolutely loved it.  Hubby and I finished the pan all in one sitting!  The only difference was ... I don't have a 9x13 pan and it won't fit in my little convection oven, so I put in a 9" pie plate. and had enough crust to line the sides -- crust was golden after 12 minutes, but that's not the recipes fault.   My grandmother always said that recipes were a guide -- especially when it comes to cooking times.  Crust might be a little thick for some tastes in the 9" pie pan, but the sweetness and everything is JUST PERFECT!  Thanks, Elaine!  Quick and easy and right up our alley! :)

Followed the recipe and crust was a little done, did not think there was enough lemon, maybe next time add a little zest to the egg mixture. Other then that I think it was great.

Excellent!  I baked at 350F and they turned out well.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla to crust and zested the lemons before juicing for the filling.

Too sweet for 5 stars, reduce sugar in egg mixture to no more than 1 cup. I add a little more lemon too. Very good crust.

These are really good. I did add the zest of the lemon I juiced since I didn't see any reason why it should go to waste. I followed the recipe to a T they are a thin bar but pack a lot of flavor with the added zest. I didn't have a hard time cutting them at all they sliced nice and pretty =))

I thought the taste of these bars were perfect and that they are extremely easy to prepare. One problem; I couldn't cut them into neat bars. The lemon filling is too liquidy and they were quite messy. Doubling the flour and eggs as gourmetmom suggests seems like it wouldn't help with this issue. Unless I cut down on the eggs and left the rest of the recipe in tact...not sure what to do.

20 minutes in my oven burned the crust...and continuing with the recipe just turned the whole crust black.  The lemon topping was also terrible looking - I would NOT recommend making this recipe the same as listed!!!  It's a waste of your time and ingredients.  The recommendations many refer to where you double the topping is a great one - that worked perfect the 2nd time around!  Thanks to that reviewer!!!

Excellent!! Have made this recipe many times because it's so easy and exceptionally satisfying. I made 1.5 parts recipe of the lemon which worked well. I might double all the lemon next time. Before making this recipe I didn't know how good Lemon Bars were.

I think this recipe is great just as written.  I do 1 1/2x all the ingredients and bake in a 10x15" insulated pan.  A no fail recipe and they always disappear fast.

I did exactly as GOURMETMOMMY suggested as most other people have seemed to do.  I had right under a cup of fresh lemon juice, so to up the flavor a little I put in some lemon zest too.  It was great.

I have made these several times and they are delicious.  They have been a hit at several backyard BBQ's.  The only change I made was to add the zest of 1 lemon to the lemon topping. They are very to make as well.

Try following the recipe!  I made it just as written in a glass 9x13 and they turned out perfect!  I mixed the shortbread crust with my hands and pressed it into the bottom of the pan.

I was in a hurry to prepare a Memorial Day desert and didn't follow my routine of reading reviews. That was a mistake. Though the flavor of this recipe is four-star, I had a few issues, so overall, I rated it three stars: 1) the crust became too brown around the edges, and one end started to creep up the side of the pan; I cut that part out, and 2) the lemon mixture was too thin, I thought; just not enough volume, and 3) the lemon mixture turned out quite uneven. It's been years since I prepared a lemon bar recipe and the last one was superior to this one, but the bars are nearly gone in just a couple of hours, so the taste must not have been too bad. And once covered with powdered sugar, the somewhat bumpy texture was easily disguised.

This is exactly what I was looking for in a lemon bar. Not too lemony, not to sweet. Tasty! I'm thinking the next time I make them to add a smidge of blueberries, just to give it a little extra zing.

all those who have changed the recipe i can appreciate ur preferences but honestly other than the cook times are about 5 minutes each longer than needed this recipe is great as is & i never have a problem of any sort as written!!amazingly easy & delish!! baked as a thank u gift for my niece and she just went nuts!! i found the bake time is off and my oven is perfect temperature wise so i have to assume that maybe u should watch carefully when baking as i found that both times (lowest) listed are about 5 min. too long!! these will be in my repetore for years to come!!!

These turned out really good. Very zippy but not too sour or sweet. The crust was a little hard to get out. I think it was the pan I baked it in. I used a 9X13 pan and I used 2/3 cup lemon juice plus some lemon zest.

These are fabulous. I've never made lemon bars so have no point of reference against the myriad of other recipes for lemon bars - but I'll definitely make these again. The shortbread crust to lemon topping ratio was perfect in my opinion. These result in thin bars (3/4 inch) but in a 9x13 pan I think saying you get 36 is stretching it a bit. I discarded (ie ate) the 1/2 inch edge around the pan because these bits tended to be over over cooked and got about 18 nice size bars.

Really really good... I followed advice and doubled everything for my large pan (10x14), downed the sugar and upped the lemon juice. The crust was a little thick but a great compliment to the tart lemon. I got lots of compliments and recipe requests!

These were ok, not very lemony though, and I could taste the eggs and flour more than the lemon! Plus, I don't understand how people can "rate/review" a recipe that they didn't even follow, my pet peave on this webiste!!! Doing so leaves people with the wrong impression of a recipe, thinking it's better than it actually is (as written). If you alter a recipe, it's no longer the same recipe... therefore making your review irrelevant. So annoying.

Perfect lemon bars.  I made modifications because I love them tart and not very sweet.  No change to crust except that I used an 8 x 8 pan, and baked it for 15 minutes at 350.  Do not overbake!  It will not be browned and it should not be.  I was going to follow Gourmet Mommy's modifications but I only had 3/4 cup lemon juice, so I used 5 eggs, 5 TBS flour and 1 1/2 cups sugar and they turned out PERFECTLY!  Tart, thick and very yummy!!!

DELICIOUS!!!!  My husband was crazy over them...  I doubled the crust and followed GOURMETMOMMY's suggestions but did make a few alterations.  I did not use food coloring and they were still pretty.  I am sure they could have been yellower but it worked.  After juicing three lemons, I only had 3/4 C of lemon juice so I topped the juice off with Countrytime Lemonade.  I was nervous, but it worked!!!  And lastly, I baked them in the metal pan but lined it with parchment paper and they came out beautifully!!!!  This recipe is deninitely a keeper!!!  ***Note:  With the alterations from GourmetMommy, I think the bars were tart (which I like) but if you are looking for a sweeter bar, the alterations may not be for you!!****

These were okay, but I will not make them again.  I did made them exactly by the recipe.  I do agree that 375 is too high to cook these.  The crust was okay but a little chewy around the edges, and the filling was fine, but browned very quickly.  I sat the timer for 20 minutes and they were very brown on top when I took them out.  As far as flavor, I did not think that they were too sweet, but would have liked them a little more tart, maybe they just needed more lemon juice.  They are good, just not one of my favorite recipes.

I used the recipe as stated, except I doubled the lemon filling ingredients!  I overcooked mine by about 3 minutes, and the edges got too chewy and caramelized.  So if you double the filling using the original recipe, watch it closely.  I baked it at 350 (for the filling) and 375 (for the crust).  Other than the chewy edges, these were really good!

I made these almost the same way except I wanted thick ones so I just doubled the filling and I didnt make the crust listed I just made some graham cracker crust and then after pressing it into a 8x11 pan I poured the doubled filling over it then sprinkled graham cracker crust on top but not entire covering it. After it back I dusted with powdered sugar-Yummo~!

Maybe it's just me since I have an extremely picky palate, but I followed this recipe exactly using the lower of the time ranges, and my lemon bars came out burned and flavorless. My classmates all loved it though.

I had trouble with this recipe, I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I followed the original recipe and first found the crust difficult, it wasn't forming into dough like consistency, I had to add more butter to make the crust.  Then, I made the filling as directed and baked it.  I baked for 20 min and the top was burnt, it was hard and brittle like thin crust.  It looked nothing like what they should have.  Not sure what went wrong.

I usually try following the recipe exactly when I first make it unless almost all reviewers agreed on something else.  For the crust, I followed almost exactly except I added 1 tbsp lemon zest and baked in a 350 degrees oven.  It was very easy and tasted awesome, I've been making this crust for other recipes so many times since then.  For the lemon bar itself, I followed reviewers recommendations based on many agreements among them.  I used 6 eggs, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 6 tbsp flour and 1 cup lemon juice.  I think I love "very lemony" flavor than others but this came out just too much and too rich, so I cut them into small pieces.  Still I thought they were very good lemon bars and I will try making them again with the right amount of sugar and 1/2 cup of lemon juice (I still think I need more than 1/4 cup).  It didn't become frothy and I didn't really mind but I'll try whipping egg white first next time.  I wrapped each piece with plastic and froze them.  I defrosted it a night before in a fridge or an hour or so on a counter top (make sure you eat it before it gets bad) and it tasted exactly the same.

Delish! I made them for a party and I couldn't wait until the day of the party. They smelled wonderful.

I halved the recipe because I didn't need that much. So 36 divided by two is 18, but I only got 12 good-portioned bars from this.

Turned out excellent, but I did make a couple of adjustments. I baked the crust @350 for 20 minutes - (barely brown around the edges) and halved the recipe for an 8x8" glass dish. I kept the 1/4 C lemon juice the same though. I tried the adjustments where the flour and lemon juice and sugar were all increased and I didn't like the way that turned out @ all!

I made these exactly as the recipe instructs and my family thought they were perfect.  I read the other reviews that suggested some pretty significant changes, but ultimately decided to give the original recipe a try.  I'm glad I did. These are not too tart or too sweet.

I should have given this two stars. I didn't care for these. I love lemon bars, but these just didn't make the cut. I really enjoy "The Best Lemon Bars" from this site. These bars were just "ok" and I certainly won't be making them again.

These are absolutely the best.  You definitely need to use fresh lemon juice.  I could gooble up the whole pan myself.

I did them the first time with the original recipe, you really have to thinly spread the dough but they were great,all the other ways don't seem too work as well doubling up the dough was wayyyy too much crust, but for a cute touch add pink food coloring and  subsitute lime for lemon and you got pink lemonaide bars(:

Very tasty, but the cooking time was too long for my oven.  Very easy to make and make a nice presentation!

Made these for my boyfriend. My daughter ended up eating most of the pan so when he finally got to them, I had to promise to make another batch just for him. He loved them!

I have been looking for a lemon bar recipe similar to that of Starbucks - one that has just enough lemon so you know it's a lemon bar, but not enough to make you pucker up.  This recipe hit the nail on the head!  It turned out great and people raved about it!  I'll definitely make this one again!

This recipe is a little too sweet for my liking. My family agreed. They were, however, very easy to make. I see a few people's came out a little overcooked. Mine did too! :( Maybe 20 minutes at 350 next time!

I agree w/prior reviews about the crust being a gooey mess. I thought it was odd that the recipe said to use softened butter. The butter should be cold and cut in and then pressed to avoid the stickiness. Another thing I found odd was that it didn't call for lemon rind. What is a lemon bar w/o the lemony flavor of the rind. I added that. 20 minutes was way too long for the crust especially at 375. I baked it at 350 and it still only needed about 12 minutes before it started to brown. I would have preferred more filling as well.
Most lemon bar recipes only call for the yolks so I will see how it turns out when it comes out of the oven. I am adding a special tough of sugared lemon rinds a top of the powered sugar for elegance.

Fabulous!  BUT needs some changes--more tartness needed to even out the excessive sweetness.  So, made 2 batches to pick the best and had taste testings. One batch used the changes recommended by GourmetMommy--these came out too "eggy" tasting." However, the second batch was fabulous and everyone raved...These are the simple changes to make this recipe perfect--- 1 cup lemon juice, 1 cup sugar, 3 eggs, 4T flour.  Do the rest as usual.
Crust can also work w/one stick butter if you prefer, but the original recipe for the crust is good too (it does make more than enough though).

This is a good lemon bar recipe. Not amazing, but not bad either. I think that many of the alterations suggested by other users are a matter of personal taste, and not necessary to the success of the recipe "as written". My husband took them to work with him and everyone enjoyed them! I'll probably make this one again.

i made these as written, however, i will now use others recommendations for doubling the filling and not putting the topping to the edge of the pan.  mine turned very brown and hard around the edges.  i simply cut out the middle and at the "bones" later on.

I've made this recipe a few times and, while good, I've always had a bit of trouble with it. The crust is difficult to cut through and the topping never sets very well. These bars taste great, but end up being very messy and not visually appealing, though it could very well have something to do with my oven or the pan I'm using. I think I'll try a new recipe the next time I'm making lemon bars, though.

Update: this were alot better after they stayed in the frig overnight. Made for a Cake Walk today in our school carnival. Original review: Good taste--- but as for presentation, they look "fluffier" in everyone else's pic, mine stayed very flat, almost more crust than lemon filling. Also, the end directions are somewhat confusing---how can you let cool on a wire rack before cutting into squares? I let cool in the pan, then stuck in the frig.

Pretty good. I made these in a slightly larger pan so I doubled both the crust and the lemon filling. The crust definitely needs to be baked at 350 for only 15-20 minutes. It was browning slightly at the edges after 18 minutes! I could have added more lemon juice to increase tartness; I only used 3/4 c. because I was nervous about them being too tart. Next time will use full 1 c. if I double recipe again. Otherwise, a good first attempt at lemon bars!

I think these were a bit to floury for my taste. Maybe would have liked the filling better if it was made with cornstarch. I barely had enough dough for the base but it just made it. Really should have more filling too - made as the recipe states it isn't enough. Also, I dusted with powdered sugar, didn't refridgerate and it turned into a syrupy mess. I think putting in the fridge might have prevented it? The taste was OK but could have been a bit tarter.

Hmm I don't know why I'm the only one that didn't like these. I followed the recipe to a T w/ Gourmetmommy's alterations. I know it's not right to make a low review based on someone else's alterations, but I don't have a sweet tooth so I know it would of been too much sugar anyways. I think the texture was off, it wasn't tart enough, and the crust was just blah. I'll keep searching for the perfect lemon bar recipe.

These were very good.  I did double the crust recipe as GOURTMETMOMMY suggested.  However, I only added 1/2 cup of lemon juice to the fiiling because I thought a cup might make the bars too tart.  They were perfect, not too sweet and not too sour.  I also added the food coloring and 1 3/4 cups of sugar.  Will definitely make these again!

I used beebeebaker's suggestions and except for a REALLY thick crust these were outstanding.  The crust is yummy though but it's just aLOT of crust.  Will probably make again, just decreasing the crust ingredients a bit.

This was a decent lemon bar recipe. I have no desire to pucker up over my lemon bars, so after reading the reviews I made a few modifications (but not as many as some people).
FILLING: I added the 1/4 cup lemon juice PLUS the pulp and the rind (used one of those citrus zesters with the little holes in it that makes curly strips)of one lemon. Added one extra egg, 1 extra TBS flour and left the sugar and everything else the same. 
CRUST: Added a pinch of salt. **Noticed some people complained about the crust not filling the pan. DO NOT MELT the butter. If you do, you will end up with a wet dough ball that won't fill the pan. Cut the soft butter into the dry ingredients with two forks or a pastry blender. You should end up with a pile of crumbs that you can then pat into a nice crust that is perfect for a 9X13 pan. My 4 yr old helped with that part.  The results were tasty, not too tangy, looked pretty and only used 2 lemons! Yum!

These were tasty, but the picture is a little deceiving. The bake time is much too long at 375. I pulled my crust out after only 15 minutes and the whole thing out after only about 15 as well. The edges were a little crispy, but the rest came out fine. If you make the recipe as it states the filling is a little skimpy. Unfortunately I didn't see the other suggestions to use GOURMETMOMMY's review points. I would make this again, but I'd do what she suggests....double the filling and lower the temp to at least 350.  I did add the zest of 2 lemons to the batter to make it more lemony, and put some lemon zest on top once they were cooled. Tasty treat, just needs some tweaking.

I made this recipe, and it was just fantastic! Everyone loves them. I expanded this by trying lime bars. They are also terrific.

I wanted to use up the lemons that have been sitting in my fridge, so I tried out this recipe.  I worried that the bars will out too sour, but they are in perfect balance of sour and sweet after I cut 1/8 cup of white sugar. I also cut back 1/4 cup (half stick) of butter for the crust. They are just awesome!  My family and I really enjoyed them.  This is definitely a keeper! Thank you.

I also followed GOURMETMOMMY's suggestions about doubling the filling and adding more lemon juice as well as her baking temperature and times.

The crust was excellent. The filling was good and set well.

I guess I am not a huge fan of lemon bars. i had never had one before this. They are like an awesome meringue pie without the merengue (and better crust)... I dunno.. maybe because they seemed like Lemon Meringue Pie and it wasn't it seemed off to me.. something was missing but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.

I'll keep the recipe on hand but it wont be made too often.

It's rich and has good flavor, but not quite what I was looking for.

Not much lemon taste. The crust was enough to cover the bottom of the 9x13 dish, but next time I think I am going to double the topping and add more lemon to it. As is, it is more of a "sweet bar" not lemon bar. The consistency was great, but the crust could probably go for 15 min. at 350 rather than 20 at 375. It was burnt on the edges and was hard to get out of the pan.

Too sweet for me!!  Did need more of a lemony taste.  Also, I think the filling needs to be thicker.  Pretty good overall, but not really my style.

These were very, very sweet! Over-the-top sweet! And this is coming from someone who LOVES sweets! However, the crust was very good. Be sure to use butter and not margarine, because it really adds to the flavor of the crust.

Been making this recipe for many years - always a family favorite at events.  I up the lemon juice to 1/3 cup instead of 1/4, but otherwise leave the same.  Awesome!

I used the modified version reviewed by the majority as being most helpful.  It was pretty good, but not the best lemon bar I've had.  Also, I noticed that the modified recipe mirrors 'The Best Lemon Bars' recipe so you may want to try that recipe. Update: I made the lemon bars again in a 9 by 9 in. pan, halved the crust recipe and used the modifications from the top reviewer (and halved those modifications).  I watched the time a lot more carefully and ended up with a 15 minute bake for the crust (probably should have been more like 17) and then about 20 minutes after the lemon mix was added.  Excellent!

like others, i was tempted to rate this with less stars simply because the recipe as-is is not what we're all making. but with suggestions, these are wonderful. PLEASE follow the suggestions of both gourmetmommy AND beebeebaker. the crust is very good, but there should be more of it. the taste of the filling, after following advice, is wonderful. i used all the juice from one lemon and the rest of my bottled lemon juice, which left me just shy of a cup, so i also added the zest of the lemon. it was really perfect. i think i whipped the filling too long, though (i was on the phone :) )so it looked very foamy when finished. but who cares! they were great. even my ultra-picky husband loved them. once upon a time, we both worked at starbucks and loved to have a cup of coffee with a lemon bar. nice to know i don't have to pay so much to have the same treat at home.

I LOVE lemon bars, and I so wanted to love these.  However, although I am a pretty skilled baker, these came out badly.  I did not alter the ingredients and followed the directions exactly.  The crust was dense and crunchy, and they were extremely chewy, especially around the edges.  As far as the flavor, it was merely okay.  Not lemony enough for my tastes.  The search for the perfect lemon bar continues.

I used GourmetMommy's changes, and I doubled the recipe for the crust, but I still don't know if I like it.  Mine turned out pretty dense and not very lemony despite the fact that I doubled the juice.  I have a better recipe that uses cream cheese in the batter, I'll stick to that.

These were just okay for me. 
The only change I made was doubling the lemon juice. I was using bottled and tasted the filling (i know raw eggs but they've never killed me yet) and decided to add  more lemon juice. I put almost 3/4 cup in. But I like my old recipe which has more filling.

I thought these were going to turn out awful based on how they looked, but I was wrong. I had to cut both baking times almost in half, however. When I pulled them out the second time the edges were too brown and I thought they were going to be too thin. They were delicious, however. And they taste great right out of the freezer!

Delicious!  I baked mine in a 8.5 x 11 glass dish and was satisfied with the thickness of the bars.  I did't change anything in the crust although baked it in a convection oven at 325 deg for 20 minutes.  I kept an eye on it since other reviews said 20min was too long. I followed some other suggestions and added 4 tbsp flour, 1/2 cup lemon juice, some lemon zest.  Baked it for 25 min and it came out really great.  I personally found it a bit too sweet so will try to lessen sugar next time. My kids just loved it. Next time I will try to use a bigger pan and make thinner bars. I kinda liked the chewy browned sides.

This requires too much fussing. Even with the smaller amount of time baking, there were still burnt spots. Had another recipe before where it was fool proof.

This is my favorite thing to make for work for special occasions. Everyone loves them. Once, I didn't have enough lemon juice so I used some pulp-free orange juice to make up for it, and it was still a hit! I usually double the filling to make a thicker bar. Highly recommended!

Good taste, though I did double the filling. Two problems, though: even though I used a nonstick pan in addition to greasing the heck out of said pan, the crust still stuck to the bottom pretty badly, and the filling is goopy and even after several hours in the fridge.

I used 1/2 the dough and put it in an 8x8 inch pan.  It only took about 12 minutes to bake, which makes sense because it is similar to short bread dough.  If you are trying to find a middle ground for the "lemony" taste, the amount of lemon in it is good.  Some coconut in the crust would be nice.  For Christmas, add some drained and cut up green and red cherries to the lemon mixture. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I rate this four stars because I have changed it a little.  Definitely add lemon zest to the lemon mixture - it adds nice favor and great yellow color.  Also, i usually up the lemon juice to 1/3 cup.  Also, the best shortbread recipe is Tina's Chocolate Chip Shortbread...use this as the base (without the chocolate) and you can't go wrong!  Soooo good!

I actually mis-read this recipe and put the 1 1/2 cups of white sugar in the crust instead of the lemon curd. It STILL worked though. I realized the mistake before I made the curd, so since I read the previous reviews I added 1 extra egg, 3 more TBS. of flour and a full cup of fresh-squeezed lemon juice. Since I goofed and put all that sugar in the crust, I put about 3/4 cup. confectioners sugar in the curd, just enough to balance the tart. All in all, they are delicious, despite my error. VERY RICH, so I cut them into small, two-bite pieces. I baked the crust 20 mins. at 350 and it was JUST getting brown around the edges. Put it back in the oven with the curd for only 15, and the crust was perfectly golden, firm, but not hard. I think I'm glad I made the mistake! Be SURE to grease the pan, I can see how they would be difficult to remove if you don't.

Good but WAY OVER DONE. I only had the shortbread crust in for 15 minutes.. and it was golden brown and then baked it another 18 minutes and top was done.. but the shortbread part was burnt and a little gross.

I made this in an 8x8 dish, and the shortbread and curd layers were nice and thick. The curd, however, was WAY too sweet for my taste. I added more juice and the zest from 2 lemons, but it was still much too sweet. I only really made this because I had a couple of lemons that needed using up, so I doubt I'll be making it again. Thanks anyway.

I used this recipe, as written, but I doubled the lemon curd. A decent recipe but not one I will make again, They turned out perfectly however they are entirely too sweet, wow, a person could have their weekly allotment of sugar in just one bar, I will keep looking for a recipe that suits my family's tastes better

These were good but tasted off somehow.  I think the lemon flavor was too artificial.  For the first time on this site, I followed some suggestions of other reviews and they did not work!  First, I baked this on 325 and it took forever!  I also used 1/2 cup of lemon juice and I think it was too much.  I am going to try these again, but next time I make these I'm going to follow the recipe to a tee and see if I like them better!

These turned out great! However, I recommend you put in 1/2 cup lemon juice as opposed to 1/4 cup. There also wasn't enough dough for the crust with the ingredients listed. I used a 9x13 pan and yet it wasn't enough. I had to make more. A bit of a hassle.

I am not big on lemon bars but my sister-in-law loves them and she isn't the best cook:)  I have made this recipe for her many times and she loves them.  I think that the crust is to crunchy (overdone) and the lemon curd isn't think enough.

I loved this recipe.  The shortbread type cookie base was great and the filling was tart and chewey.  I would double the recipe for future use or use an 8x8 square pan because I like my lemon bars thicker.  I will definately make this recipe again.

make sure you bake the crust long enough or it will invert on you when you pour in the lemon/egg mixture.

I didn't follow the recipe after reading all the complaints, so I used gourmetmommys directions.  I've never had lemon bars, so I have no idea how the texture is supposed to turn out, but if it's supposed to be somewhat gooey and not entirely solid, then that's how mine turned out.  I also read complaints about not enough crust, so I made a 1/3 more and it was just right.  Overall, it was definitely easy, tasted alright, but I'm not going to make it again.

Nice and lemony, not too sweet.  I made a few changes per some other reviews. I halved the crust amounts, used the filling as written except used 1/2 c. lemon juice and put in a greased 9x9 glass dish.  Might use this one again, am trying to find the perfect recipe for a graduation reception for the spring!

I also followed GORMETMOMMYS suggestions.  But instead of using lemon juice, I used LIME!  They were AWESOME!  It took 8 limes to get 1 cup of juice and I also added the zest of 4 limes and 3 drops of blue food coloring to the filling mixture.  I had to bake the filling much longer (about45 minutes) but the end result was great tasting and very nice looking.

I used GOURMETMOMMY's suggestions, too. I loved this recipe. I used a 13x9 cake pan and had no trouble spreading the crust or it beind too done. They tend to get a little stick after a couple of days, but I'm okay with that! Next time I make these, I tihink I'm going to try and increase the crust by half. This was very good.

These were good and reminded me of my favourite: lemon meringue pie!  I followed Gourmetmommy's suggestions but I think next time I'll bake the base at 375 F for the fifteen minutes instead of 350 F and then reduce it to 350 as suggested for the rest of it :)

These are great...I followed the crust as written, doubled the eggs and flour per another suggestion and increased the lemon juice to 3/4 cup. Next time I would go to 1 cup as it could be even a little more tart. Pretty good and fits well in 9 x 13 pan.

Excellent recipe, followed GOURMETMOMMY'S suggestion, I don't think I would have liked it the other way.I did alter the crust though: I used 1 box of lemon cake mix, 1/3 cup of butter, and 1 egg, pressed all except for 1 cup of the mixture into the bottom of the pan, and sprinkled the last cup in the lemon mixture before putting it back into the oven. Everyone loved it!

Great recipe with a few little tweaks.  I took GOURMETMOMMY's advice and followed her suggesttions, which I'm glad I did.  HOWEVER, I think a whole cup of lemon juice was too much.  They were really tart and left a taste in my mouth.  Next time I will only use 1/2 to 3/4 cup.  THEN, I think it will be perfect!

This was good, only the crust was a little too crumbly.

Excellent! By far the best lemon bar recipe I have made. I added these to my yearly Christmas goodie baskets that I make each year and I received rave reviews from everyone!
The adjustment that I had to do was reduce the baking temperature by 25* as I found that the edges browned too much.
I just loved how the centre of each square had a soft filling.

Very good.  I also adjusted the recipe some.  I cut the cooking time by about five minutes, I increased the lemon juice to 1/2 cup and I used an 8 1/2 x 11 in. pan.  The bars came out perfect.  Not too tart.  Just the right amount of lemon flavor.  Be sure to grease the pan really, really good.  I had a little trouble getting them out.

Easy and tasty!! I increased the lemon juice to 1/2 cup, used a baking dish 7x11, reduced baking the crust to 15 minutes and baked the lemon filling for 17 minutes.  Turned out great!  No left over...disappears in minutes.

after reading reviews I used 1 and 1/2 recipe for the 9X13 pan. I increased the lemon juice to 1/3 cup per recipe. The bottom crust ingredients did not mix that well so I added a little milk to make it more workable. I also added a few drops of yellow food coloring to the lemon mixture and dusted with confectioners sugar. The taste was fabulous!!! very easy . will make again and again. Family members that usually don't like lemon loved these!!

Great recipe!  I also made a few alterations....1st baking time I decreased to 15 minutes.  2nd baking time decreased to 17 minutes.  Also, increased the amt. of lemon juice to just under 1/2 cup, to increase the tartness.  They turned out great!  Hubby even loved them, and he doesn't care for lemons!

INCREDIBLY awesome bars.  At first I thought I did something wrong, because they were so flat and plain looking.  But then I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and served them to my bible study and they disappeared.  Every one wanted the recipie.  This is a sure hit!  Not your typical lemon bars.  These are really good.

This is a great recipe, BUT... no way can you get 36 decent sized servings of ANYTHING out of a 9x13 pan! This recipe makes 24 servings, max. Great recipe, though, I will use it again. Beckyaunt

These were super easy to make, and taste delicious.  The top is just lightly crispy, the center moist, and the bottom cookie-like.  My tip - be sure to grease the pan well, otherwise the first bars are hard to get out.  At work, these were gone in seconds!

followed the recipe but used lemon confectioners sugar and used 8 x 8 pan.  Baked both layers until golden.  Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!

If anything, my old gas oven is cooler than the knob indicates. But it baked these bars faster than the recipe called for and I got some "carmelized" edges (i.e. black goop!). So, I'd recommend a lower temperature. 

Otherwise, this recipe is very good. I loved the flaky crust, and I am very happy to find another use for the limes that our lime tree is producing like mad! 

Be aware that lemon bars do go bad in a couple of days due to the lemon juice. (To the person who noted that they tasted strange after a couple of days.)

These are good, however, I have been making the bisquick recipe (on the box-it is an old recipe so maybe not any more!) for lemon bars which I think are a tad bit better.

Very yummy, deadly, and addictive.  Bake time took about 5 minutes longer than specified.  I was initially confused about what quantity of flour to use when (crust or topping) but luckily it turned out okay.  After a couple of days, they started to taste strange.

The top is like fruit leather, far too chewy.  The bottom tastes like flour paste.  I would be dissapointed if I bought these at a bake sale.

Easy and delicious!  I used more lemon juice than the recipe called for and I used fresh squeezed.  I have a lemon tree and I'm always looking for good recipes for fresh lemons.  These were great.  Everyone loved them and devoured them at work.  I will definately make these again.  Thanks!

Did someone say these are better the next day?  I don't know, they didn't last that long!  And I've made them twice!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and the second time I followed the advice of most of the other raters and decreased the sugar.  Both batches were great, although I liked it better with less sugar.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These were really good, baked them for a family get-together and everyone enjoyed them.  However: the 1/3 cup instead of 1/4 cup lemon juice is very important, so the bars don't come out too sweet.  And watch the baking time when baking the crust by itself.  20 minutes is probably a bit too long, as mine came out burnt on one side.  Or maybe I put too much PAM on the foil.

How can I ever make those boxed lemon bars again?  I wanted to try something relatively easy to christen my new pampered chef bar pan.  Sooooo good!  I had to do 1 1/2 times the crust recipe, and I doubled the filling.  Also, I took the suggestion of more lemon juice, some zest, and a little less sugar.  They were excellent and I will never make those out of a box again (even though it may be faster...).  Thank you for the great recipe!

These have become a favorite!  I have used the 1/3 cup lemon juice as others have and added zest of one lemon too!  These are easy and quick to make. The crust is one that I would like to combine with other recipe bars.  Taste wonderful!

Absolutely delicious!  I took others' advice and used 1/3 cup lemon juice and they turned out perfectly!  A wonderful balance between filling and crust.  I made this for Boss' Day at my office and they were gone in a flash!!!

This recipe is the closest to the lemon bars my mom used to make, which our family called "Lemon Love Notes".  My husband and I are huge fans of lemon bars, and this is a really great, fast, and easy recipe!  We baked ours a little longer just because we like our lemon filling to be a bit more cooked.  Good recipe, thank you! :)

These lemon bars are exceptional.  The crust was very tasty, but thin enough that it did not overwhelm the lemon layer.  Like others, I increased the lemon juice to 1/3 cup--that gave the perfect amount of tartness (lemony without being sour).

Not only did I increase the lemon juice to 1/3 cup(per suggestion of other ratings), but I also used 3 medium eggs (the only ones on hand at the time) plus one additional egg yolk.  The lemon layer resembled a lemon curd by doing this.  Yummy recipe.  Thanks!

I agree with all the reviews, these are great! I used a 9x9 pan and 1/3 cup lemon juice. I will be making these again and again. My family had these gone in no time. Thanks for the recipe.

I really thought something must be missing from the pastry ingredients, because the mixture was so powdery. It worked though, and was all gone within 30 minutes from the time the pan was removed from the oven. Great dessert for unexpected dinner guests.

These were great! After reading the reviews, I decided to use the 8x8 pan and increase
the lemon juice to 1/3 cup, but for those of you who REALLY like your lemon flavor, you
may want to try more than a 1/3 cup. I also cooked these just a bit longer (maybe 5 min) due to 
the thickness of using a smaller pan. Also, be sure to use a little extra non stick coating spray.

Really really good. Made from the stuff you always have around. I added a little more lemon juice though, I used about 1/3 to 1/2 cup.

perfect just as they are. I brought these to a cookie exchange so i made them a mini muffin pan for less mess. you’ll need to make a bit more crust but there was plenty of filling. The crust is sooo simple yummy and flaky. i do enjoy sour and sweet so i might add a bit of rind next go around. lots of people trying to complicate this recipe in an effort to make it better but really its perfect as is.

Didn't come out well at all. The lemon curd just didn't bake and as the dough it just wasn't turning into a dough so i had to cook it on low heat for a while. And it was too sweet. This was total fail for me.

I over baked it a little but I enjoyed it. The minimum time was too much but then again I have a very weird cooking oven so it might not have been the recipe's error but mine.

My household absolutely loved these bars. I used lemon juice from a lemon and added 1 tablespoon of grated lemon rind as suggested. I also put crust ingredients into pan while still crumbly not letting it get to a dough consistency. This makes it easier to spread. I used a metal spoon for that as the heat from my hand was melting the buttery crumbs. I will be making this for Christmas gathering. It is delicious!

The crust burned the first time.  Threw it out and tried again decreasing the time.   Baked the squares and they burnt and stuck to the pan.  Checked other recipes on this site and no one bakes these at 375 degrees.  Could that be my problem?  Won't try a third time.

We have two shifts of full time care givers for my elderly mother.  I like to make them special threats to show how much we appreciate everything they do for us. They both love lemon, and they really LOVE these lemon bars!. I read some of the "changes" to this recipe  that are posted, but I don't think this recipes needs any changes  The changes makes it very similar to a recipe that I saw posted by the Barefoot Contessa. I tried that recipe, too, but we like this one best.

accidentally cooked on 350 (times worked well, i think it may have burned had i been on 375).   the crust has way too much butter in it.    was not lemony enough for me but it tasted good.   
not sure if i would make it again... would probably try to find a different recipe with more lemon in it

These were easy and quick to make. I love stuff that's easy and tastes good. I baked for 25 mins, which was too long for my oven. They got quite brown on the bottom and edges. Next time I'll lessen cooking time.

Absolutely wonderful, but the crust seemed to take a lot longer than 20 mins to firm up and become golden brown.
I will definitely be making this again.

I've been making these for years and I should've reviewed it sooner.  I usually add a smidge more lemon juice.  But, other than that,  I keep it as it is. I am asked for these CONSTANTLY.  When I make them for a party I often make a X6 batch and I never have leftovers.  People will always pick up and extra few as they're leaving and even ask if they can take some for someone who's not there.  Women I work with have asked me to make them for their parties and even asked for batches of them so that they could give them as gifts.  They're delicious and people go crazy over them to an almost odd extent.

I think I found a new favorite dessert. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. They didn't need any changes. Since I'm a lover of key limes I think I may make them later and substitute key lime juice for lemon juice

These taste delicious, but I'm only giving 4 stars because it would be even better if the lemon curd was doubled.

Oven @ 350.  Bake crust 14 min.  If you should wish to increase the volume of filling:  6 room temp eggs, separate yolks kept to the side. Whip whites to soft peaks, set aside. Double the flour to 6 Tbsp, cream together with 1 & 3/4 c sugar,  1 full c of lemon juice (at least 4 very large lemons) and the 6 yolks. Add tsp lemon zest. Fold the whites into yolk mixture. Pour over warm crust. Bake 19 min. til set and just barely  golden brown. Okay. But the original is better.

This recipe is very easy and the lemon bar came out beautifully! I received so many compliments for these - one person even said it's been 25 years since she's had a lemon square this good. 
I followed the original recipe - the only negative thing about the bars is they burned a bit on the top edge against the pan. When I make them again I may reduce the temp like some of the other reviews suggest.

Delicious as is.  Cooking times may vary depending on your oven though.  My daughter made these for a bake sale on her college campus and the requests keep coming even after 3 years.  They're fabulous!

So my sister and I decided to make this due to our extensive collection of lemons. We started off strong, but we messed up badly when we forgot to add the flour in the first part of the recipe. Then, we re-did it and then we burnt it. But the next step of the recipe went well until we put it in the oven for twenty minutes. It was puzzled us that it was still gooey after all that time, but it turns out that the oven was never on. I imagine, with the proper skills required in baking, this would a great treat to sell or serve. However, this disappointed our mother.

DOUBLE the ingredients for the crust. And for the rest of the recipe, DO what GOURMETMOMMY does-decrease temp to 350 degrees. Put in 9 x 13 enameled metal pan. Bake 15 min. For filling, double flour and eggs, use 1 C lemon juice and 1 3/4 C sugar. Bake 20 min. With these changes to the recipe, you will get delicious lemon bars! Do NOT use the original recipe!

Omit Food DYE!!!

This is four stars for the changes GOURMETMOMMY mentioned, since most reviewers tended to go with her suggestions. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as amazing as I hoped they would be. Maybe it's because I only have whole wheat flour and I only used 1.5 cups of lemon juice (I ran out), and I didn't douse the top with tons of confectioners' sugar--I added a thin layer to it, which was absorbed by the filling part and did not end up looking like the picture; I'm just not sure.  I think if I make it again, I shall use some actual lemons to get some pulp in there, and maybe not use whole wheat flour. Still good, just not perfect.

I have no idea what the rave is about but I think the crust was overdone and I even took it out early.  second of all, aren't the bars supposed to be gooey?  The recipe timing and temp is way off and they aren't even yellow.  Sorry - this is a no go for me.

Good, easy recipe.  HOWEVER--I think the oven temp is off.  My oven cooks hot, so I always decrease time, but this time even cutting off my usual amount, the crust was slightly burned after only about 14 min. and the topping (which says 20-25 min) was done after 13 min.

These are excellent lemon bars. I made mine in an 8x8 inch dish for thicker bars, but next time will try them in a 9x13 and double the lemon mixture because I prefer a thinner crust and more lemon. I did add about a tablespoon of lemon zest to the topping and mixed it with a hand blender for extra flavor- delicious!

I really wanted this recipe to turn out great.  A co-worker brought lemon bars and those were so delicious.  The crust did not turn out that great, a little doughy, I made this crust exactly as directed in the recipe.  I might need to break down & ask her for the recipe.

I made this according to the recipe.  It is a good "jumping off point."  I LOVE lemon desserts, and let me tell you - this does NOT have enough lemon flavor.  It's just a hint.  The crust is good- but 20 minutes was a little too long in the oven for me - it got a little brown on the bottom- I'd probably try a different dish next time.  There was PLENTY of crust - and a little less lemon topping.  It was OK - but next time, I'd cook the crust less, maybe 15 mins, and probably double the lemon or use lemon zest.

I might have cooked it too long for the lemon was rubbery.  I think I would have liked it a bit tarter.

Supreme!  Put original recipe crust in a 7x11 metal pan.  Filling: 3 egg, 3/4 c sugar, 3 T flour, 1/2 c lemon juice.  Bake at 350: crust 15 min, add filling, bake another 20. Nice, thick lemon bars!!!  Not too tart, not too sweet!

2nd time I made these:
Love the thick crust, but needs more filling.  Filling falls away from crust. :(

These were fantastic, and very easy to make.  We are not huge fans of lemon bars in my house, but I had a craving and tried this recipe.  They were perfect!  Hubby wanted to take some to work and I had to tell him, no- I don't think we have enough :)  Mine were a tiny bit on the soft side though, I would bake them a little bit longer next time.  Great recipe!

I thought the taste of these bars were great, not too sweet like some other rreviewers have stated.  The only difference I made was that I baked them in an 8x8 pan, because I like my lemon bars on the thicker side.  I will definitely make them again.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  It was easy to make but I thought that it lacked lemon flavor. It was okay, but I probably won't make this recipe again.

Soooo tasty and fairly easy to make. I have gotten many compliments when I make these. What's nice about this recipe, is that it's really hard to mess up. I even had my 2-year-old son help me make them one time. I found this recipe a few weeks ago and have made it 3 times. Don't cook as long as it says or it will burn. I doubled the recipe once, but I didn't have a bigger pan and they still turned out really good. I just had to cook them a little longer than normal.

I give it two stars when made as this recipes directs- HOWEVER, after reading the reviews and altering the recipe accordingly, it was pretty good. DEFINITELY decrease the temp to 350 degrees. For the filling, double flour and eggs (or it will be a thin rubbery mess), use 1 C lemon juice and 1 3/4 C sugar. This makes for a good lemon bar recipe.

in order to make these more lemoney but not more tart (as adding juice will do) a tablespoon of lemon rind should be added.  note: when grating rind off of the lemon do NOT include the white only grate the yellow and you will have a deep lemon flavor without addeding tartness..

Why does the powdered sugar dissolve/melt after a couple of hours? I cool the bars completely then sprinkle with the sugar. Obviously, I am doing something wrong b/c the sugar is "gone" after a few hours.  3 for this recipe and 5 with some changes which include 1 cup of lemon juice!

Good bars, but not fantastic. I made as written other than adding a little extra lemon juice. If I make again, I'll follow some of the other reviewers suggestions to improve them.

I made these for a bake sale - absolutely wonderful!  Had to make a second batch for husband & kids.  Crust is solid and bars hold their shape so they were easy to cut & package.  I lined my glass dish w/ parchment paper as someone else had suggested.  SUPER EASY and ingredients are cheap and on hand!

The base is fine - the lemon filling is rubbery and definitely lacking any lemon taste.  Sorry, but needs more filling and more lemon flavor!

Thought these were really goo. Enjoyed the texture of them. I actually substituted grapefruit juice for the lemon juice, which gave them a different flavor, but yummy nonetheless. Thanks!

These were hands down the best lemon bars that I have made.  The only change that I made was to double the lemon part.  I also used fresh lemon juice (recipe doesn't specify fresh or bottled).  Easy and delicious!  I used a 9x9 pan for a thicker bar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were really good!  I did what the other reviewers said like adding more lemon juice.  I left them out on my counter in a covered pan and they stayed nice and moist for over week.

This was my first time baking a lemon bar.  After reading the reviews I followed what GOURMETOMMY suggested.  I don't know why but my bars stayed VERY gooey.  It was very frustrating b/c the decorative pwd sugar would become runny and I would have to blot the top dry and re-dust w/ the sugar.  Next time I think I will follow the recipe as written and see if there is an improvement.  I was very satisfied w/ them otherwise.

I have always loved these lemon bars. They are sweet and that's the way most of us Southern Belles make them. I think up North they like more of a sour/tart taste. They are a bit thin so if you want thicker bars you should double your recipe for a 13x9 pan or reduce the pan size for the original recipe. Thanks for posting an old time favorite!

These were super easy to make and very good.  I personally like stronger flavors so I think I would include some lemon zest next time to kick up the flavor... that being said, everyone really loved the subtleness of the lemon and they were all snatched up right away!!

Thanks for this recipe. I followed some of the reviews and lowered the heat to 300 F and it worked out pretty well for me. Also I used whole wheat and raw sugar in the recipe and didn't sprinkle confectioners' sugar on top and I was pretty pleased with this healthy snack :-) Thanks for posting it.

There was too much sugar and read some of the reviews about using a smaller baking dish (8x8) because it was hard to spread crust thin - do not do this!  Crust will end up being too thick, try your best to spread w/ spatula on a 9x13 pan.  I will try next time with more juice (but use lime), and less sugar

These lemon bars tasted so yummy, not too sweet, nice lemony flavor however, had a lot of trouble getting them out of the pan!  The top layer was too gooey to cut through cleanly, I put them in the refrigerator for a few hours after they had cooled and that did the trick.  Will try this again to see if it was me or the recipe.

I was short on time, and I had a store bought pie crust leftover from cooking for an event in the fridge, so I pressed it into a metal pan that was just barely smaller than 9x13 (I am studying in the UK, so it is hard to give exact measurements). I also took GOURMETMOMMY's Advice on the filling but I only increased the lemon juice to 3/4 of a cup, the flour to 5T and the eggs to 4.  I also used a lot less than 1/3 confectioners' sugar as the topping.  This was so easy, and it turned out perfectly!

I'm rating it before I even make it! Yikes..let's just say I'm banking on these turning out great...making them tonite to ship out to family in OH. Hope they hold up well for travel (riding with someone..so they will be refrigerated).  I'm assuming that gourmetmommy's changes still have it ok to bake in same size pan?  And with other reviews, sounds like that is best since it was too thin a crust w/o the addition.  I also like the lemon zest idea & will do that.  Wish me luck!

I followed the recipe exactly. There was enough crust to cover the bottom of my pan, and enough lemon filling to cover the top of it nicely. The crust baked up well and the filling set.. BUT- it tastes like a slightly lemony quiche over a shortbread crust. Not a horrible taste (though the eggy texture is a bit unsettling), but this can't seriously be a recipe for lemon bars. There's no way.

My family and I think these bars are super yummy! They are not too lemony so they are liked by all... even those that claim not to like lemon bars! These bars melt in your mouth! I brought them to my hubby's work and now every time I stop in his coworkers ask me when I will be bringing more lemon bars!

These were fantastic.  Definately double the crust recipe; perfectly tangy and sweet, soft, delicious!  Don't dust with confectioners sugar until just before serving, it gets absorbed into the bars otherwise.  People were begging for the recipe!

They tasted delicious, but every time I make them, there never seams to be enough lemon filling on top. And a little hard to cut into squares.

pretty good!  Even worked with 2 eggs since I didn't have 3 on hand!  Also turned the temp down to 350 and you definitely need to watch the crust!  I will make these again!!

For some reason these didn't really turn our for me.  They were VERY tart and the top ended up having a very odd texture.  The crust was good though.  I'll def. use it for the bottom of other things, like fruit pizza!

These were pretty easy to make, but I thought it lacked a good lemon flavor. I think if you would add some lemon zest too it would help bring out the flavor more. I think I overcooked the crust a bit so it was kind of hard.

The lemon bars tasted good, but I wouldn't say they were jaw-dropping amazing. Somehow, the bars turned out to be very thin, even though we followed the recipe exactly and spread the mixture into a 9x13 pan as directed. Definitely do not put back in the oven for more than 20 minutes as ours came out with VERY crisp bottoms. Maybe I'll try again someday - I do love lemon bars.

My family loves this! I would have liked it to be more tart. The sweetness really overpowered the lemon flavor. But good recipe for the most part! My filling was done after just 10 min...don't overcook it!

Like so many others, I followed GOURMETMOMMY's changes + Missy's changes: decreased temp to 350 degrees, doubled flour and eggs, used 1 C lemon juice and 1 3/4 C sugar & baked 20 min with the filling. Baked the crust 30 minutes at 350 and it was perfect. Will try an enameled clay dish next time, as Missy suggests.

Hi All! I just made these with no modifications, and they are perfect just the way they are; not too tart and not too sweet, and I had plenty of crust for the bottom. I have to say I do not use butter due to diet restrictions, but every recipe I make I use country crock light instead, and everything still comes out great with no melting or softening required. GREAT RECIPE! :)

I made this recipe exactly as written for a party I hosted and wasn't very pleased with the results. They weren't inedible but they weren't that great either and I am not sure what I did wrong. Perhaps I should've followed the suggestions from other reviewers and they would've turned out better.

Absolutely AMAZING! I  whipped these up in no time at all, and had time to visit with our guests as I made them too!  They're delicious, super super easy to make and loved by everyone! I had to give the recipe away, and I will DEFINITELY be making these again :)

I made this recipe as-is and could barely keep my hands off them!  I love my deserts SWEET, so this was perfect.  My boyfriend really liked them too and I managed to make them with what I had on-hand :)

These were great. I made them for our church bake sale and they were gone soooo fast! Mostly by the people selling them...they said they had to fight over the last one...LOL! Lots of compliments! Also a very EASY recipe and simple ingredients. I followed the original recipe but I might double the crust next time.

This recipe is a basic lemon bar recipe. It is too sweet! minus the white sugar down to 1cup, and add a squirt more lemon juice.

Pretty good.  Added extra lemon because our household likes a lot of lemon but otherwise followed the recipe and it came out fine. My co-workers LOVED them.

My friends thought this was very tasty. It needed more filling since the finished product was very thin, and a stronger lemon flavor. Next time I will adjust the recipe to reflect those needs

I received so many compliments on this dessert.  I followed the advice of the reviewers and doubled the filling, which put the lemon bar more in proportion. The cookie crust was my favorite part.  I'll definitely be making this again.

These came out excellent!  Next time I'm going to use fresh squeezed lemon juice (instead of out of a bottle) and add some yellow food coloring.

I played around with the proportions of lemon juice and sugar to my liking (1/2 c lemon juice to 3/4 cup sugar) and i doubled the recipe. For my crust i did my regular shortbread type crust, which is very similar to this and i prebake in a deep 10 x 10 stoneware pan for about 10 minutes and pour on filling immediately. Bake till filling is set. Good basic recipe, it made it easy for me to achieve the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Thanks!

I have made this recipe many many times over the years and have had to edit it, still not happy with the turn-out. My main problem is it doesn't have enough lemon filling on top, nor is it tart enough. My secondary problem- which I find equally annoying, is the lemon top always disconnects from the crust when I cut them.  So I will try Gourmet Mommy's suggestions and poke holes in the crust before pouring the lemon on top, so maybe it'll seep in and hold on.

I followed the recipe exactly and the bars were delicious. Very sweet and rich - you can only eat just one or two - with a refreshing lemon flavour. Tasty. My entire family loved them.  The only thing that I might change is the crust. It seemed to be half crust, half lemon filling. I prefer more lemon filling, so next time I might double it or reduce the crust.

I did not care for the crust - for fear of getting it to done, I don't think I got it done enough.  Guess you should watch until it is golden brown (mine was a little pale).  The crust will not get any browner when baking the filling I discovered.  I did double the filling BUT with about 3/4 c. lemon juice and 1 3/4 c. sugar - I would suggest tasting till you get it to the correct tart/sweetness.  It just is to much sugar for me with the sugar in the crust and the sugar in the filling.

I agree with others - the original recipe isn't that good, but with a few alterations, it's great.  I followed the recipe and the base AND topping would have burnt to a crisp if I left them in as long as requested.  I took the crust out after 15 minutes (it was already somewhat overdone) and the topping out after another 15.  The finished product looked absolutely unappetizing and I thought I'd have to throw it out; however, it actually tasted pretty good.  It needs more lemon flavor and MUCH better presentation, so as others have suggested, when I make this again, I'll add lemon extract and yellow food dye.  I DO NOT agree with others who have suggested the crust or topping be doubled - there was a perfect ratio of crust to topping.

I made this recipe as written except for using more lemon juice. The baking time is off. The crust was burned before I added the filling- I can't imagine it would take 20 minutes in any oven. By the time the filling was set (~15 minutes), the entire edge was black and stuck to the pan. After 1/4 cup of lemon juice, we decided there wasn't enough lemon flavor, so I ended up using about 3/4 cup. Also, these are VERY thin. Not the thick bars I was looking for.

Mmmm, mmm, super yummy!   I doubled the base and used the suggestions from the first review and I think it turned out wonderfully!  Tart and sweet and definitely something great to look at.  I shared a batch for Easter brunch and it was a hit!

Followed the recipe exactly except I only had whole wheat flour and it turned out pretty "eh". The edges came out a little burned and hard so I had to trim it off. The lemon filling was really sweet, I tend to like a little more tartness. I will try another recipe before I come back to this one.

I followed the doubling suggestion and really enjoyed the lemon bars.  They would have been way too thin if you don't do that.

I made this recipe tonight and it turned out great!  I did change a couple of things, I added the juice of one whole lemon and did not add as much sugar as asked for in the lemony part, I prefer less sweet and more tart!  Yummy!

This is a great lemon bar recipe!  I love the crust.  I used one large lemon for the 1/4 cup lemon juice.  It was very easy to preare and to cut.  Everyone enjoyed them.  I will use this recipe again and I may try to use some fresh lime juice as well for a twist!

Excellent recipe and very easy, I doubled the filing ingredients but realised I only had 4 eggs.  It still worked out great.  I wasn't able to cut them into nice neat little blocks.

Yes, PLEASE do double the topping recipe as GourmetMommy recommends. These are AMAZING!!! Below is her recommendation:  "My alterations make this a five star recipe, in my opinion. I like my lemon bars tart, not sickening sweet. Here's what I do: Decrease temp to 350 degrees. Leave crust the same, put in 9 x 13 enameled metal pan. Bake 15 min. For filling, double flour and eggs, use 1 C lemon juice and 1 3/4 C sugar. Add 3 drops yellow food coloring. Bake 20 min."

I gave it 4 stars because I followed GourmetMommy's suggestions on the filling and also doubled the ingredients for the crust. I don't care for sweet lemon bars and these changes made the perfect tart bar.

these are fantastic.  I followed GOURMETMOMMY recommendation to double the eggs, lemon juice, and flour, and they turned out great.  I have been wanting lemon bars for a few days now, and these hit the spot.

Wow so many conflicting reviews! So I made the recipe as is except for increasing the lemon filling by 50% because it just didn't look like enough. It probably would have been but I like the semi gooey middle so I think I'll stick with it. Only one of my kids liked it but I think lemon is subjective and both us adults thought it was fantastic. We are southerners at heart and so prefer the sweeter version like the original recipe.

Followed recipe as is...turned out way too thin. Not like any bars pictured. I, too, reduced oven to 350 for crust and baked for 15 minutes. Then added filling, baked for 20 minutes and got really brown and dried out. Will try again, but with other reccomendations. Sorry, but this recipe needs some work.

This recipe only gets 4 stars from me because I also followed GOURMETMOMMY & beebeebaker's advice and made the same changes to the ingredients.  However, my oven cooks cooler so I did adjust the temp up to 375.  Yummy!  If you like your lemon bars tart like I do, don't make this recipe exactly like it says, go to beebeebaker's review for instructions.

These were delicious - the perfect lemon bars. Watch your oven closely though, mine tends to run hot and the sides were browned a bit much for my taste.

I think these came out all right. I follow other viewers suggestion and doubled the dough and filling. I think doubling the dough was just too much. It came out good but theres so but dough on the bottom it takes away the flavor of the lemon. I like lemon desserts tart and this didnt cut it. Maybe I will make these again with normal dough recipe but double the filling.

These were ok per the recipe but I put the crust in the oven at 375 and set the timer for 20 min.  My oven is usually right on for most recipes but these were very brown.  I also had to take them out early after baking the topping.  They just browned to quickly.  The edges were very brown and hard.  I would make again but reduce the oven temp to 350 and reduce baking time.

I'm giving gourmetmommy's edition a 5 as I prefer more tart (and this is definitely the tartiest of the tart) than sweet in my lemon bars. This was a great recipe!

So great! Tart was what I was going for so I did take the famous GourmetMommy's tips and quadruple the lemon, double eggs & flour and slightly up the sugar. Quite satisfying, indeed! Thanks Elaine for the original recipe and GourmetMommy for kickin' it up a notch!

Yummy!  I used the shortbread crust recipe suggested by another reviewer.  It had good flavor to it.  I also used extra large eggs, 1T extra flour, and used 1/2c of lemon because many reviewers said it was too sweet but also wanted to avoid a sour lemon taste.  I set my oven to 350.  The crust and the lemon layer took longer to bake than directed at this temp.  I have been craving lemon and this hit the spot.  Thanks.

Loved them!  These are beautiful lemon bars and I'm hard to please.  I did add the zest of 2 lemons to the filling.  It really helps them taste more lemon-y without messing up the ratio of ingredients.  The filling had just the right texture.  Thank you!

This recipe is out of control with how many people have doctored it up.  I love allrecipes and I find the suggestions generally very helpful.  However, those that made significant changes should just find a different lemon bar recipe out there to work on.  Surely, there are thousands to choose from.  I made this one with only one change - did almost 1/2 c. lemon juice.  Other than that, I stuck with the original and found it to be just fine.  If you know, you like a tarter, more lemony bar - just try a different recipe!

I made this the exact way it was said to be made, and I thought they were very good. I had no problems at all with the recipe. The crust sort of tasted like animal crackers and the filling was lemony and not too sweet. Good recipe!

Very good lemon bar recipe. I didn't make any modifications other than I accidently put it in an 8"x11" pan. Sweet and gooey with a hint of lemon-y tartness.

My rating is for a recipe adjusted by suggestions of GourmetMommy.
The Lemon Bars were out of this world!  I used True Lemon instead of real lemon juice.  16 packs = 1 cup.  Phenomenal. There's no difference between a freshly squeezed lemon and True Lemon diluted in 1 cup of water.
The second time I prepared these Lemon Bars, I didn't have neither lemons nor True Lemon packets.  So I used bottled lemon juice.  Don't ever do that!  The Lemon bars tasted acidic and fake.. Big mistake on my part.  So I'll stick with real lemons and True Lemon packets going forward!

These are excellent. Remind me of the kind of pastry you would get at a fancy cafe. I followed GourmetMommy's modifications and they were wonderful. Made them for a potluck and came home with just the baking dish.

Have to say these are my fav! The only thing I changed was 6 eggs, 1 3/4 cups of white sugar 6 tbls of flour and 1 cup of lemon juice, really only doubling the filling but decreasing the sugar some. Perfect! Will make again!

For the filling, I followed the advice of Gourmetmommy. However, I used 1.5 c. of Egg Beaters instead of 6 eggs. For the crust, mine was quite dry, so instead of adding a bit of water, I added about 1 to 2 tsp. of lemon extract. That pulled it together and I was able to pat it into the pan. All I heard from my family was 'mmmmmmmmmmm' and "Don't change a thing!" So, I'll be making this a lot. It really is good and lemony.

Used suggestions from GOURMETMOMMY (Thanks!)to make an easy, lemony, and tasty dessert. A little bar goes a long way, with the intense lemon flavour. I think I would serve them in future as part of a dessert table, rather than as the only dessert, for those who are not lemon lovers. Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe, didn't change a thing.  But, I would turn the oven to 350 degrees next time as the edges got more brown and hard.  Also, I would add more lemon, they didn't taste "lemony" as I would have liked them.

I followed gormet mommy's advice but added 2 1/4 c of sugar instead of 1 3/4c.  I thought the result was great.  I also did the crust with whole wheat flower and 10T of butter (rather than 12) and it turned out great as well.

ok, I did what Gourmet mommy said but I also doubled the crust as another reviewer recommended, I guess I like my lemon bars sweeter and the crust is a little tougher when it is so thick. I will probably do what the recipe tells me to do next time. My husband would only eat the edges.

Very good lemon bars.  I followed the other reviewers instructions.  I decreased the temp to 350 degrees.  For the filling I doubled the flour and eggs, used 1 cup of lemon juice, and 1-3/4 cups of sugar.

I made the crust as the directions stated but it was way too greasy! Either it needs to cook longer at a higher temp, or have less butter. Soggy. Then I made the mistake of listening to the reviews to double the lemon portion. The whole thing was soggy, gelatinous. Teach ME to listen to the reviews instead of the instructions! If anything, don't double the recipe and make it in a 9x9 pan instead.

My husband loves lemon bars so I thought I'd surprise him on his birthday. I doubled the lemon filling per other suggestions. I had to use a longer baking dish so the crust wasn't as thick as we liked. Overall, a good recipe with great taste. Thanks!

I can't stop eating these!  They were very simple and extremely good.  I'll add another 2 tablespoons of lemon juice when making them again for more of a lemony taste, but these are incredible the way they are.

These lemon bars are very good.  I used 1/3 cup Key lemon juice and they were quite tart and lemony.  Very yummy!

Someone else mentioned that the crust becomes very sticky and hard to spread in a 9X13.  A way to avoid this is to prepare the crust like a pie pastry, which will resemble pea size crumbles.  You can then easily press it into the 13X9.

Double the filling.  In fact follow gourmetmommy, I just add the zest of all of the lemons that I juice.  I like it very tangy!  These are good.

These are the best tasting lemon bars I have ever made. Single the recipe on the crust and double the recipe on the filling. For a little more boost of lemon flavor I added one teaspoon of lemon flavoring. I only used lemon juice from a bottle.

I made these for a little get together...and while they were good and some were eating them, they were a little small, and a little overdone. the overdoneness probably came from my oven however...it runs a bit hot. and i didn't get the 36 yield either....making me have to cut them smaller to get more. i am not sure why i didn't get more out of the recipe though. they were good and i love lemon. i might make them again and just adjust temp for my oven.

These were only OK in my opinion.  I prefer a more tart lemon bar, and found these much too sweet.  I think the proportion of crust to filling is off too.  While the crust is delicious, there needs to be more filling.  I will look for another recipe that has a tart filling, but may use the crust from this one.

taste is great, but the didn't care for the form! this thing completely fell apart and cracked, and it's just a gooey mess. maybe it's because i used one of those silicone pans. it probably would have stayed together more in a metal or glass pan? i was making this for a potluck, but i've got to pick up something else to bring. i cannot serve this. i give it two stars since it tastes good, but i will be searching for another recipe.

A good recipe.  I used the original recipe.  It turned out great.  I did use a smaller tin, only because that is all I had.

Super good, super easy.  I followed BEEBEEBAKER 1/9/07 recommendations with increasing amounts and the taste was fantastic - perfect levels of sweetness and tartness with a delicious shortbread crust.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really good base recipe.  I followed the advice given by Gourmetmommy because my husband and I both like our lemon bars more tart.  I doubled the crust recipe but didn't use the whole portion.  We like more "filling" than crust.  I also used fresh squeezed lemons.  They came out perfect!  I didn't use the food coloring as I thought they looked yellow enough from the eggs.  Definately will make again.

I followed the directions dilligently and these were not very good. I was baking for a bakesale and after several batches they were either too hard or too soft. The lemony taste was good but with it's inability to produce consistant results I'm afraid I wont be making it again....

These are delicious, although I did modify them to suit my palate. I prefer tart to sweet.  I don't think I modified them as much as others did, though.  I didn't change the crust at all and did use a 9 x 13 pan.  It was a thin crust, but it seemed fine and baked within the 20 min.  I doubled the filling and used 2 C of lemon juice instead of a half cup.  Bc I doubled the filling, had to bake an extra 15 min.  Came out gooey, tart, and delicious.  Thank you!

This recipe was REALLY thin, less than 1/2 inch thick. If following the original recipe I would make it in an 8x8 pan instead. The only changes I made was I doubled the lemon juice (used 1/2 c) and used a little less sugar (used 1 c) as I like mine a little more tart. The sweet crust compliments a more tart filling rather well. It had GREAT flavor but if you use a 9x13 pan, double the ingredients. I also baked it for 20 minutes per previous reviews.

There has to be a better lemon bar recipe out there! I've never made lemon bars before but I made these (original recipe) for a potluck because my husband requested them and they had a bunch of issues. The crust was flaky and did not hold well. The sides were gooey and had a tough consistency. The middle of the lemon bars, when the crust would hold tasted ok - but it wasn't worth it.

Made these for a baby shower but didn't double the crust as I was low on powdered sugar. Will definately do that next time as there was only a thin layer of crust. I also softened the butter a little too much and the crust turned to mush, which caused it to stick to the pan when I cut the bars.

Tasted great, husband said he could 'eat a whole mess of these'.  Only concern was whisking didn't make it frothy.  Not too tart, not too sweet, easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!

I used other reviewers sugestions and everybody loved them except me. I am a chocolate lover and they were waaaay too sour for me. I would give it 3/4 stars, but everybody else seemed to like them so I take their advice.

I should have followed the other suggestions of adding more lemon juice.  I baked these bars just as the recipe stated and I couldn't taste any lemon.  Neither could my son.  Very bland and the color was blah as well.  If you try this, add more lemon juice and maybe a little yellow food coloring.

I had never had a lemon bar before and these were a pleasant surprise. I used fresh squeezed lemon juice. It worked perfectly. I would not use bottled lemon juice. My suggestion is not to store these overnight because the lemon flavor blends into the crust and it doesn't taste as wonderful. The crust is yummy. I suggest to make and serve on the same day.

I followed the directions with the variation that the one person had, only I ended up only having 1/2c lemon juice, so I added a 1/2 lime juice. I am going to have lemony-lime bars.

I can't really fault the recipe since I did follow the substitutions listed.  I liked the bars but they seemed just a bit too lemony or sour.  Also a bit eggy.  Other than that I do like them.  I don't have any experience with lemon bars so do not know how they should taste.  So it could be that I am not partial to lemon bars.  I will make these again and put in less lemon juice.

This was very good. However I'm not sure what I did wrong so this is probably user error on my part but they looked nothing like the picture. They did not raise at all and were very thin & kind of crispy & chewy. But they smelled very good while baking so I had to try them. We ate them all. Maybe next time double the filling part?

I gave five stars because i think if i were still in america it would have been perfect. I live in europe now and there is something different about the butter here. I followed the recipe directions exactly except for adding a tad bit more lemon juice. Only because i squeezed a bit more than i needed. The lemon part was just  fabulous . The shotbread type crust tastes like a giant chunk of butter. But as i said the butter here is just different..I cant bake cookies at all because they have the same effect. (ive tried all the tricks to fix it too) Next time i will conjur up a graham cracker/cookie type pie crust. That will make the awesome lemon part edible with the bottom

I was looking for a more dense, almost cream cheese-like consistency for the filling. Regardless, these turned out quite nicely. I followed the original recipe, but used an 8X8 pan and almost doubled the amount of fresh lemon juice. These went pretty fast and were a more than welcome addition to the sweets table on Memorial Day. Everything else brought contained chocolate. Having something a little tart really rounded out the selection of sweets offered.

To make these to my taste, I used GourmetMommy's tips and reduced heat to 350, and doubled the filling with the exception of using 5 large eggs, 3/4 cup lemon juice and 1 1/2 cup of sugar. Removed from the oven when the filling was just set (not browned). Dusted conf. sugar over cooled bars.  Perfection!!!

I was hoping for better with such a good overall rating. They were a little too sugary for our liking, and not lemony enough. Next time I'll try cutting back on sugar and upping the lemon. The crust was very good.

these bars are delicious!! I did drop the temp as suggested and put a bit more lemon in and they were gone in seconds! My one tip is to make sure you line the tin deeply with greaseproof as when you pour the filling on it can leak under the base and wheld it to the tin!! Happy baking!

Really pretty good and very easy to make - I made the bars the same way the recipie suggested, if I make them again I might add a little more lemon.  Took them to work, they went fast.

I did not like this recipe, I made the changes that were suggested and I still think something was missing. I will use the basic outlines to this recipe and tweak it until I get what I'm looking for. I really want them to be more chewy and have more lemon taste.

I made these today with the changes recommended and they are lovely, waiting for OH to get home to give his opinion now.  I'm going to do them next time with more lemon juice as I'd like a really sharp topping.  They are fab though.  Thanks for submitting.

Using the recipe suggestions by beebeebaker, it turned out delicious! Several people asked for the recipe... It was a bit more tart than I was used to but the sugar dusting helped!

I thought the crust was delicious and buttery.  The sugar could be reduced to produce a tarter bar if desired, but overall, everyone loved them!

I left the crust as is, doubled the eggs and flour for the filling, put in 1 cup of lemon juice and 2 cups of sugar and baked on 350 - the bars turned out very well! The crust is a bit buttery for me, so next time I may tweak it and use less butter, though.

These have potential but it just seems that the crust to lemon ratio was off.  Mine were super tart.  They made everybody pucker.  I will read back through some of the other reviews and make some changes and try again.

This isnt my regular recipe but I only had 3 eggs so I decide to try this one. There could've been a bit more filling it was thin in spots(so obviously my oven isnt level) anyway they were great. I took them to a party and the whole batch was eaten. I topped each one with a tiny flower and leaf made out of royal icing.

These were very good!! My husband even liked them - holy shock batman!!! I followed the advice of GORMETMOMMY and beebeebaker. The tartness was a bit much for my 2 yr old (lots of funny, sour faces tho!) so next time will a little less lemon juice.

Wow...thats all I can say. My husband said he thought they were from the local bakery. I followed the GOURMETMOMMYs suggesstions b/c it seemed to work out better. I would bake it for about 23 minutes though.

these are awesome!
I doubled the bottom and did what was recommended for the top (1cup of lemon juice and double eggs and flour and 1 3/4 sugar)  and they turned out perfect!  I havn't served them yet, I could wait to try them so I already took a bar and can't wait to eat more after the guests arrive!

I doubled the filling and the crust.  The filling was still very runny even after baking 20 minutes at 350.  I want to make perfect lemon bars.  Will try again.

These bars are good however the crust was more of a cookie which to me is not quite a lemon bar should be like.  the top is fine but i would double the recipe for the top so that there is more filling.

I planned on making this recipe using all the helpful tips from other reviewers, but I didn't have enough lemon juice so I ended up following the original recipe. I thought they turned out really well. They had a nice balance of tart and sweet. The edges turned out browner than I'd like, but otherwise, they were very good.

I bought the ingredients for this recipe before reading the reviews...mistake.  By the time I figured out I didn't have enough lemon to make the suggested changes, so I made the filling as the recipe directs.  I did lower the oven temp to 350 and bake the crust for 15 minutes--that was perfect.  The original recipe is okay...but there isn't much filling and it is very, very sweet, especially when the bars are dusted with confectioners sugar.  They taste good, look beautiful dusted with sugar (also added 3 drops yellow food dye), and they definitely won't go to waste, but I'm going to try the suggestions that GOURMETMOMMY and many other suggested to get that tart lemon flavor and more filling.

I just whipped up a batch of these and they turned out pretty tasty! Very rich. Since our household of two couldn't eat too many of these at once, I froze the leftovers and found that they tasted even better cold! Next time I will try using limes...

Update: I just made another batch tonight due to pleading from my boyfriend. Mmm...just as good as the first time! He's already eaten three squares and I can hear him in the kitchen cutting up more slices. Please do yourself a favor and bake these!!!

10.3

I had a bottle of key lime juice languishing in the fridge so I decided to use it up for this recipe. And they turned out perfectly. Like many other reviewers, I kept the crust the same and increased the eggs, flour and juice. I ran out of white sugar though and subbed turbinado sugar. Worked out fine. I sprayed the pan with the flour oil spray and stuck the whole thing in the freezer for an hour. In order to get clean sharp edges, I used a paring knife and after each cut, rinsed it in hot water. Perfect squares! I prefer these frozen. The boyfriend (now fiance) still loves them as much as ever.

This recipe is a disaster. I followed it exactly as posted and it turned out bland and chewy. The crust burnt and the filling was cruncy. Not a lemon bar at all. The ratings this recipe got are very misleading. Eveyone significantly changed this recipe then rated it with 5 stars and raved about it. Gourmet Mommy should post her own Lemon Bar recipe so we can put 5 stars next to that one this one doesn't deserve the one I gave it!

I think the person meant to use a 9x9 pan and not 9x13.  The 9x13 pan is not going to work. The filling will be thin and the crust will burn.

I used this recipe exactly with a 11x7 brownie type pan and it came out perfect.

Loved this recipe. I followed the advice of others and increased the crust ingredients. I didn't double them....instead I 1.5X them. If I doubled I think the crust would have been too thick. I followed beebeebaker's advice in regards to the lemon topping. Next time I will add use more sugar on the lemon top (about 2 1/4 cups granulated sugar). It was not sweet enough for my taste, but otherwise it would have been perfect.

These were a big hit in my house.  Now, not surprisingly, if you hate lemons, this is not the cookie for you.  I hated this cookie.  But the kids and husband LOVED it, and what was supposed to be a weeks worth of snacks lasted until Wednesday.  Next time I'll make a double batch!

ok, not very lemony, i was hoping for a more tart taste.  I couldn;t get the lemon topping to get frothy so mine came out a little heavy.

I was in the mood for something citrusy so much this last week that I didn't even mind heating up my house with the oven. I was sorely dissapoointed in this recipe. I made it per the instructions. I added a touch of vanilla to the crust and filling and also some lemon zest to the filling. The crust had the most awful bitter and chalky aftertaste. The filling was too sweet. I used a little more than 1/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice and I guess that wasn't enough. I will keep looking for another recipe to curb my craving. This one wasn't it at all.

These lemon bars were OH SO delicious.  I just added a bit more lemon juice because we like them pretty tart--but I don't even think I needed to add extra.  They were yummy and tart!  I think I liked them even better the next day when they came out of the refrigerator, ice cold!  This is definitely a keeper!  I also only baked the crust for 12 minutes instead of 20.

This recipe had too much sugar and not enough lemon. Anybody who uses this recipe should add a lot more lemon. They are LEMON bars not sugar crispies. I call them that because they were too sweet and those directions make you bake those lemon bars until you can't bite into one without losing a tooth.My advice don't bake  them. Cook the crust but then let the filling cool on top. Then dust with confectioners sugar but not too much.

GourmetMommy's recipe is a lot better than the original. Her version is sweet enough compared to the original which is too sweet. I added lemon zest to the crust and only two drops of yellow food coloring instead of three because I didn't want it to look fake. It looked and tasted fabulous. This is a great summertime treat!

I changed the recipe as per beebeebaker and found the crust too thick and with a greasy appearance/taste.  The lemon filling changes were perfect with a rich lemon flavor and texture were just right.  All in all, I will keep looking for a better recipe.

Followed Gourmet Mommy's changes. Made 2 batches back to back. I did not double the dough part as some recommend and it filled (thinly) a 9 x 13 glass pan lined with parchment paper. Forgot to add flour to the lemon-egg part in the first batch. Thought that turned out much better than the lemon part in the second batch with the flour. In  the second batch, I substituted canola oil for margarine/butter (more healthy). Ended up adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour to compensate.    Preferred that crust to the first batch I made.  All in all I LOVED these bars. Pretty fattening, but a great, refreshing summer treat. Oh, also, I froze these immediately after I made them (after I tasted them). It had no impact on the taste.  I added the powdered sugar after they'd properly defrosted and prior to serving.

I thought these were excellent, but I did change the recipe as per beebeebaker. I basically doubled the crust and filling but did 1 cup of lemon juice. These were for a baby shower I hosted and I got many compliments on them with a request to bring them to another shower I am attending this month!

These were my first lemon bars ever and they turned out fantastic.  I used 1 cup of flour, 1/2 cup margarine and 6 TBS of confectioner's sugar to make the crust for an 8x8 baking pan but left the filling quantity as is.  Did use 1/2 cup of lemon juice and baked at 350 all the way.  Left everything else the same.  Loved them!  Thanks for a great easy recipe.

I made them in a 9x13 as the directions called for and the crust was the right thickness.  I did 1.5x the filling though.  Even though I used more lemon juice than the recipe called for plus about a tsp of grated rind, I still thought they weren't lemony/tart enough.  They were good, but I will try another recipe next time.

Pretty good lemon bars.  I did have to make a few minor adjustments.  I definitely did not bake as long as the recipe called for at either times (crust and filling).  I just watched and took it out the first time when the edges started browning.  I also watched and took it out when the filling top started turning slightly golden.  Definitely taste the lemon filling to adjust to your liking before baking.  I added a bit more lemon juice and would probably cut back on the sugar next time.  VERY easy to make.  Would definitely make it again.

I have made this recipe many times, and found that using a smaller pan- 7" x 11" is the best size. I also use somewhere between 2/3 - 3/4c of lemon juice and 1-2tsp. lemon extract and 1/2c sugar (that's the balance we like). Rating stars is so subjective... but I think that 4.5 is fair.

Based on some other user recommendations, I used a 9x9 in pan.  The bars came out too thick and the lemon filling was too gooey.  I'd stick to the original recipe.  Taste was pretty good, not my favorite.

Double the filling, and these really are the best lemon bars ever!  Also, I didn't have to bake the crust as long.

Absolutely perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. I added an extra Tbsp of lemon juice to the mix and 'lightly' dusted the top. Will definately make again!

YUMMY!!  As per other reviews, I doubled the filling, and they are fantastic.  Hubby made sure that I left some at home for him, and the guys at work loved them.

This is a very simple recipe to make, but like other reviewers we have made some easy modifications to suit our tastes.  The lemon top is not enough for a 9x13 pan, so we doubled it and increased the amount of lemon juice to 1 cup (total).  Oh, and did we forget to mention, this is absolutely delicious!

I did as others suggested and made in a smaller pan, but than there was to much crust and not enough lemon custard. It was still good but the crust was a little overpowering so next time I will throw away some of the crust mixture. If you made it in a 9X13 pan you would have a very thin layer of lemon. We prefer more lemon than crust.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. Those of you who had trouble with burning or undercooking - - you have to know your oven. Adjust the temp., babysit, keep an eye on the dough, etc. I have a celcius oven and put it to the suggested celcius degree and it came out fabulously. Delicious and highly recommended!

This is an excellent lemon bar recipe. I did cut down the baking time for the crust to ~12 minutes. I also add coconut to the lemon curd.
The bars disappear quickly whenever I make them.

I made these using the quantities in the recipe apart from using slightly more lemon juice. After reading the reviews I kept a close eye on the cooking time and ended up giving the bottom about 15 minutes and the top 20 minutes on the temperature given. They turned out just right but you definitely need to watch them carefully. The girls loved them and I will make again.

So easy and yummy.  Everyone I have made these for *LOVES* them.  I follow the directions exactly and have not had any problem w/ burnt crust or the lemon curd being runny.  The edges do get a little more baked (curd gets very brown and carmelized), but that is actually the tastiest part.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was really tasty. I followed as others said to lower the temperature to 325 and to cook for a shorter amount of time (15 min for the crust, 18 for the rest). I also ran out of white sugar and used part confectioner's sugar for the custard part and it still turned out very well. I also added lemon zest for a stronger flavor.

This tasted just like the lemon bars my mom used to make. It did not look the same though, the filling was lighter and more cake looking, but it tasted great. I had the opposite problem as everyone else, I had too much crust, but it still turned out amazingly.

these were awesome. i did make some changes though, i halved the recipe this time but the next time i will be making the full thing. i added about 1/3c of lemon juice instead of 2tbsp, and i had to add a little more to the dough because it wasnt enough to cover the bottom of the pan, but other than that i left everything else the same. it was awesome, my husband loved them and he's not a big lemon fan. this kind of reminded me of a pie that my mom makes, it's definently a keeper and will be a regular on my menu. Thanks alot!

Thanks for a terrific recipe!  I followed the recipe with no substitutions--not too sweet, not too tart.  As we all should know, oven temperatures vary, so I watched the cooking time closely.  I only baked the crust for 15 minutes, and the final bars for about 20 minutes, and they came out perfectly.

The only thing I changed in this recipe was that I added the zest of half of a lemon.  The bars tasted great even though the crust turned out a little dark.  Next time I will lower the oven temp to 350 and use a little less sugar because the bars were a tad too sweet (even though I love sweet!), plus I didn't even sprinkle the confectioners' sugar on top.  They would have been way too sweet then.  And yes, they are thin.

I wasn't a big fan of these. The first couple of bites were ok, but after that it was just too tangy for me to eat. It did come out nicely though. If you really like lemon, these are for you!

I just took these out of the oven about 15 minutes ago.  They got just cool enough to cut without making a mess and my husband has eaten about half the pan.  I took other reviewer's advice and doubled the lemon juice.  Wonderful!!!

This is a delicious recipe and it turned out right the first time.  The only disappointing point was the edges burned slightly.  (That could possibly be the fault of the baker and not the bakie...)

These are okay, but the presentation was not quite what I wanted it to be. There were bubbles in the lemon parts, and the crust isn't as tasty as my grandmother's bars were. I will keep looking for other versions of this until I find perfection! I will say, however, that my husband and my co-workers had no problem polishing them off!

My first time making homemade lemon bars and they were to die for! Like most of the reviewers...I followed GORMETMOMMY'S suggestions. So glad that I did. They were fabulous and so lemony. I did add the zest of 1 lemon for that extra zing. They were tart, sweet, and the shortbread crust was awesome. I did spray and line a 9X13 pan with parchment paper which made for easy to cut and neat looking squares. This recipe is a permanent keeper! The suggestion of using lime juice also sounds fabulous!

These have a good flavor but the are too thin for my liking.  I would try doubling the filling or using a smaller pan.  The total height was about 1/2 inch and I am used to the 1" ones my mom used to make.  They taste just like hers though!!  (I can't wait to try the lime!  What an awesome idea!)  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Follow Gourmetmommy's additions to make very lemon-y squares. I know, doubling the eggs sounds extreme for one pan of bars, but it works out yummily. I added a teaspoon of lemon zest because I really love lemon.

YOU MUST USE A SMALLER PAN - i have made this 3x, used margarine instead of butter for less fat, tasted GREAT. the only problem is that the PAN IS TOO BIG. the bars end up thin and overcooked. use a pan one size smaller.

I also followed GOURMETMOMMY'S suggestions and they came out great!  I don't think I would have liked them if I did not make the changes to the recipe - doesn't seem like there would be enough lemon mixture.  1 cup of lemon juice was perfect - but I like tart things.  I would definitely make these again.

These are the only lemon bars that have turned out to perfection for me.  We have a lemon tree in our backyard... the best and tartest lemon bars those with real lemon juice instead of bottled!  It gives the bars a real zing!  Everyone absolutely loves them!!!!

i thought these tasted mostly like the crust, but they were a big hit at the office so if you're looking for something to bake with lemons, try these out.

Very tasty!!  They seem to be very flat due to the size of the baking pan but if you want them thicker, use a smaller pan.  Everyone raved about these and they were easy to make!!

The bars were good, but too sweet, and I only used one cup of sugar.  I also added more lemon juice to the filling.  Mine didn't stick too much because I used a glass pan and sprayed it with cooking spray.

Excellent! I actually made these for a bake sale and was worried because I had previously tried a "box mix" which was horrible. But these were just what I wanted, tasty, moist, attractive and pretty easy! I took the advice of others and increased the lemon juice while decreasing the sugar. Once the workers at our bake sale tasted them, they were sold out in minutes! I'm making more today.

I added a bit more lemon juice, and have also substitued lime juice instead.  Both make a great treat.  I have lime and lemon trees and this is a wonderful way to use the juices!

I don't think that I will try these again.  If I do, I will double the filling AND use a smaller pan.  These also didn't seem to turn out quite right (filling wise).  They didn't even taste like lemon.  Summing up, if I want lemon bars again, I will simply buy them in the box and make them--they are quicker and taste much better.

This is a very good treat. I thought they had just the right amount of lemon in them. not to sweet not to bland. I lowered the sugar, and raised the lemon juice. i raised the lemon juice to 1/3 of a cup from 1/4. and lowered the sugar from 1 1/2 to 1 cup. theses were very delightful. The filling is super smoothe. my bars came out on one side but got really hard on the other. I didnt think they were very balanced. But my grandma and aunt loved them. *Thanx for the recipe, it is a keeper. ( much better than out of the box)

~~Well... 2 words- SUPER SWEET -but good. My mom really liked them! I did increase the lemon juice to 1/3 c. and that was good, but next time I will probably halve the sugar. It was so sweet you had to eat it extra slow, and had to take long breaks in between bites. It lasted a day or so since it took so long to eat... but, hey, it was pretty darn good!~~

I love the lemon filling, it's very smooth.  These bars are better, I feel, made the day before.  Since some lemons are sweeter than others, adjust sugar accordingly.  For those who likes nuts, finely chopped almonds add a nice crunch to the crust.

These are delicious, and so incredibly easy to make. I will be making these again soon. I added the zest of one lemon. Next time I won't add as much sugar, as I would prefer these to be more tart than sweet. Excellent recipe.

This was a good recipe, although we just moved into a new apartment and the oven overcooks everything, so needless to say I overcooked them. They were good at first, but because they were overcooked, after an hour or so they were a little hard and too chewy! But I will definately make them again (as soon as I get my oven figured out!)

These were quite a hit!  I served them to the contractors working on my house and even the ones who don't like lemon liked them.  They were all gone in one serving.  Easy to make with stuff you always have around the house.

I cooked dinner for a blind date last night and made these bars to seal the deal.  I added some coconut because i am a coconut nut.  They were scrumpdillyumptious.  She dug'em too.  I know it was risky making my own addition being the inexperienced cook that i am...but...what can i say...I live on the edge.

Chewwwy and sweet.  Might cut back on the sugar or add a little more lemon juice next time.  Great recipe though.

I also used 1/3 cup lemon juice.  My family loves them!  These bars are best if eaten the day after they're made (if you have enough willpower!).

Followed advice and tried 1/3 cup lemon juice -- rave reviews at my house!  Every bit as easy as it says.  Try running the tip of a sharp knife around edges immediately after it comes out of the oven.  Makes it much easier to serve when cool.  This one will be a family favorite from now on!

There wasn't much filling, and it was too sweet.  The next time I made it, I doubled the lemon juice, and it was just right.  I would double or triple the filling if I made it again.

Great easy recipe, I added an additional 1/4 cup lemon juice and zest of one lemon for more lemon flavor.  I baked in a stone pan, convection oven.  I refrigerated the pan, sprinked with powdered sugar and then cut.  Thanks!

Too sweet, and not enough of the custard lemon filling. Even followed the suggestion of adding more lemon juice, but that didn't really cut the sweetness much. Very rich and buttery shortbread style crust. Not for my family, sorry.

I increased the lemon juice to 1/3 cup.  I also used a 9x13 pan, as directed, and they came out great.  They disappeared fast!! The only problem I had was that the filling did stick badly to the sides of the pan, even though I greased the pan very well.

These were really excellent.  I added about a tablespoon of grated lemon peel to increase the lemony flavor.  I think when I make them again, I will build up the cookie crust around the edges.  It tended to get a little too brown.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This is the best lemon bar I've ever tried - and
I've been searching for 2 years. The crust is nice and thin so it doesn't overpower the lemon like other recipes. I made 1 1/2 times the lemon batter and it was great.
