This was a good recipe, but definitely missing a very important ingredient...creamed coconut or coconut milk!!!  I made it the first time without it and knew that it didn't taste quite right.  Then, I added the creamed coconut and it made all the difference.  Also, if you don't think it is spicy enough, all you have to do is add more chili powder and that will do the trick...trust me, mine was flaming! This recipe is quick, simple and tasty as long as you add the coconut!

This is my second time making this dish and with my modifications, it is absolutely delicious! I used bone-in, skin-on chicken legs separated at the joint, and removed excess fat. I doubled the recipe, but maybe tripled the spices, this is a must! I also added coconut milk and creamed coconut, because korma is supposed to have coconut something in it! This may seem like alot of coconut flavour, but they're both necessary to make this dish very creamy. I added cumin to take away the overwhelming coconut taste. I also add spinach. It's way creamier than the base recipe, and I love the way it tastes, my way. Thanks for the base recipe, Steve! I never buy the jarred korma anymore!

This was excellent. I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream, adding flavor and saving some calories. I prefer a thicker sauce, so I thickened it with corn starch. Next time, I'll omit the ground almonds because I don't think they added anything to the final result. I forgot to buy Basmati rice and had to use converted white rice; just not as good. Next time, I'll bump the seasoning up a little. My wife's first experience with Indian food was just recently having Chicken Korma in a restaurant. She loved it, and proclaimed this a "keeper" recipe.

This isn't a bad recipe. I had to replace the yogurt and cream by coconut milk. Where this recipe loses points is with the tomatoes. Tomatoes have no business in a chicken korma. I made it without tomatoes and it was much better. I also tried throwing a couple of cardamon pods and it added  so depth to the flavors. This recipe is a good base to build on.

I just made this for an Indian pot-luck dinner party.  The only addition I made was a 1/2 tsp. of salt, but otherwise made it exactly as shown.  I served it over basmati rice.  Turned out great, everyone loved it, and it made great leftovers the next day.

Very good dish.  My only modification was to add more ground almonds.  Also, if you like spicy dishes, I'd throw in a few chili pepppers as the dish was not spicy in any way.  Definitely a keeper!  And, extremely quick to make.  Thanks, Steve!

I cooked this per recipe directions except I eliminated the tomatoes as someone suggested and substituted coconut milk for the heavy cream and yogurt. Also instead of ground almonds, I used chopped. It's absolutely awesome! I paired it with rice pilau and mango chutney, and the marriage of the three is purely divine! A feast for the tongue and belly, an aroma parade and a taste carnival. The flavors are out of this world. This is my first time cooking and eating Indian curry and I will definitely do it again.

My first attempt at making Indian food; served with cinnamon sprinkled white rice (that I had on hand).  Used low fat yogurt and roasted almonds chopped in a mini food processor; also added one sliced zucchini as suggested to "up the veggie factor."  Looked great, tasted interesting.. the cinnamon was quite noticeable, and it was not spicy at all despite the chili powder.  I'm not sure if I liked it enough to make again,   as my taste buds aren't used to eating much cinnamon for dinner.  Thanks for the easy recipe, though!

Great Recipe! I punched it up by adding curry powder. I also doubled all the ingredients to make more sauce. 

It turned out great! :)

This was so good! I added some sliced zuchhini and squash to up the veggie factor, but all else according to recipe. The flavors were so subtle, perfectly blended. Yum.

surprisingly tasty, and versatile in structure. It comes together very fluidly and the rhythm feels good interweaving of cooking and prep. Luckily there is a small store close by because i had to run back and forth a couple times lol. No white pepper, and 3/4 too much chicken broth on accident becomes a triple recipe and some experimentation.... alot of red pepper, and some green chillies,a dash of cornstarch, a tiny bit of water, more spices and a healthy squirt of lemon juice- brought a wonderful balance into play... i actually considered trying a dash of cardamom and clove, but thought it may influence the recipe too much. next will be with coconut milk instead... all in all, very tasty result!!

This was delicious.  I used 1% milk instead of cream and didn't have any almonds but it was still very good.  I used a 500ml jar of homemade stewed tomatos with garlic and oregano.  I threw all of the ingredients in the crockpot and had a wonderful dinner hours later.  Thanks for sharing.

I was looking for a recipe for Coconut Chicken Korma, and when I couldn't find one, I decided to adapt a regular Korma recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, only I added one can of coconut milk. It was delicious! Everyone in my family loved it and I would definitely make it again!

Just cooked 1 big pot! As I am cooking 5lbs of chicken thigh, I used 3 teaspoon of chili powder, cinnamon, turmeric, white pepper. I do not have grounded ginger therefore I added in sliced ginger.  The rest of the ingredient basically I tripled the portion.  Suggest to add in chili for those who like it spicy.  I've also used coconut milk but found out I do not have enough.. therefore, I used starch to thicken the sauce.  Good and easy recipe for all!

I've only had Korma in an Indian restaurant once, and it didn't taste like this.  This dish tasted very similar to chicken curry without any bite.

This dish was absolutely delicious! However, I did a LOT of improvisation to get the flavor and consistency that I wanted. I took other reviewers suggestions on using coconut milk, and doubled the helping. Actually, I doubled just about all the spices, as well as the yogurt. I probably tripled the chili, but I still didn't obtain the heat I wanted. On my next batch, I'm thinking of slowly mixing in some spicy green chiles to add that extra kick and give a little color. My only warning for this recipe is to be careful with adding extra cinnamon! It tastes great with spicy foods, but if you aren't careful it can dominate the dish. Southwestern cooking often utilizes this same trick, and I've ruined a dish before by adding too much cinnamon.

I followed the recipe exactly. Surprisingly, not much flavor. Recipe is not bad but not great either. I probably won't make this dish again.

i must have done something wrong, because this was really lackluster.  every indian dish ive tried to make at home has always been so-so.  i think i need an indian person to teach me!  hopefully others have better luck than i did.  i was so disappointed, particularly because i was so excited to eat it.

It was easy to make and it had good flavor and nice consistency but it could have been spicier.  I didn't have cinnamon. I added by accident some smoked paprika - didn't hurt it. I doubled the sauce so I would have more for the rice and added a touch of cornstarch.  Next time I will not add as much cream so it has more flavor.

Really, really delish!  Perfect blend of spices (I didn't have tumeric, so I substituted curry powder & it was fine), & creaminess.  Excellent.

Really good! This is a great korma recipe for anyone who doesn't like coconut. I happen to love it, so I added a wee bit of coconut cream to this. Loved it with Indian Style Basmati Rice and Indian Peas and Cauliflower from this site. Thanks for the recipe, Stephen!

Very good, but not the Chicken Korma I'm used to. Maybe if I'd used the coconut milk as others have suggested. I did add a little curry, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I mainly used this version because it was the only one not requiring garam masala, which I think I will make next time and keep around the house.

Quite delicious with a few changes...
For more flavor, I bumped up all the spices to 1 teaspoon, added lots of curry powder, and, as suggested by others, used 2 cloves of garlic. To be even healthier and for convenience, I avoided the heavy cream (plus didn't have it on hand anyway) and added some flour to thicken. Fresh tomatoes and slivered almonds are the way to go for the perfect texture and taste. To add to this, I also added about 15 oz of garbanzo beans or chickpeas . Great, I got lots of compliments!

It isn't a pretty dish, but this stuff smells and tastes amazing.  It has good flavor without being spicy. I made it once with canned tomatoes and once with fresh. Both were good but I definitely prefer fresh, and I added an extra 1/2 cup tomato both times.  The only other change was that I used partialy crushed slivered almonds rather than ground, because I thought it helped the texture.  The leftovers are great in a wrap.

Fantastic!  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe--the flavor is amazingly complex for such a quick and easy dish. It tastes like something you would spend hours making.

This is a very nice basic chicken korma recipe.  After reading some reviews I decided to make several modifications: Doubled the amount of all spices, except for the white pepper which I added less.  Added 1 tbsp of Maharajah Curry powder from Penzeys. Used a small white chopped onion.   Added 2 tbsps of tomato paste (I froze the remaining paste in a bag for future use).  Instead of ground almonds I used 3.5 Oz of almond paste dissolved in 6 tbsps of warm water. 
Added 1 can (13.5 Oz of Choakoh Coconut Milk). Used 1/2 cup of plain yogurt which was mixed at the very end. My Korma sauce didn't take long to thicken. I served it over Basmati rice with fennel seeds. Everyone at home loved it including my picky husband. I will definitely add this recipe to my cookbook and make it again! Thank you for sharing the recipe and for all the good reviews.

I'm so sad this wasn't great :( chicken korma is one of my VERY favorites usually! I took everyone's notes of doubling the sauce and using coconut milk. It still wasn't like the stuff I crave. So sad.

I added curry powder instead of the chili powder and it was delicious! I will try the coconut milk next time though as it's not as sweet as the kormas I ate in England nevertheless a great recipe.

I have made this quite a few times and have never made it the exact same way twice. Every time I change up something and every time it is just as good...

This is in my regular rotation now. Easy to make over and over again after the first time. For a little bit of fusion, I'll put it over Persian rice. Yum yum!

Not as spicy as I thought it would be. Actually, not spicy at all to me! I would add some more chili or heat in another way. I used coconut milk in place of the cream and yogurt due to dietary restrictions and other reviews. Pretty good!

Not very exciting. Needed a stronger curry flavor -- more depth.

This recipe was good reccomend adding a dash of cayenne to kick up the heat.  The ginger flavor was weak....next time I will substitue 1/2 tsp ginger for a tablespoon of ginger paste...Good base spice combo

This was an absolutely delicious, easy, and affordable dish to make. I read the reviews prior to making this meal, and changed the following: I switched the turmeric for cumin (partially because turmeric alone has too much of an earthy smell), added 1/2 tsp. of salt along with 2 tbsp of cornstarch (to thicken the sauce), and substituted between 1/4-1/2 cup of regular whipping cream for the heavy. I also added curry powder, but I don't know how much; I basically layered the area of the pan with a sprinkling and mixed it in.

I added in fresh spinach and a drained can of baby dark chickpeas before adding the chicken.  It was a big hit with our family, although the chicken came out a bit dry and it could have had a bit more flavor.  Next time I will up the spices a bit and add the chicken closer to the end or cook it on medium-low.  
ETA: tried again and the chicken still doesn't have any flavor.  the sauce and veggies were great though.

This turned out perfect and tasted delicious. I used fresh ginger and put it in with the garlic and onion. I also salted it little to bring out of the flavor. My roommate doesn't like the texture of onions or tomatoes, so I also took out as much of the tomatoes, onions and liquid as I could and blended it then added it back to the pan with the chicken.It made a smoother sauce and I almost like it better than the original.

I used a whole fresh tomato, chopped, instead of the canned, and added one and a half blocks of frozen spinach (pre-thawed in the microwave) with the tomatoes & chicken for a kind of chicken saag.  4 stars, because it turned out kind of underseasoned, and adding salt after it was done just made it taste salty.  If you add salt with the chicken, it should turn out perfect!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have any turmeric so I had to leave it out.  Instead of tomatoes, I used the Safeway Italian Diced tomatoes which gave it a nice flavor.  Also, for the heavy cream I substituted sour cream.  Left out almonds and yogure and still had a wonderful taste. Very delicious!
