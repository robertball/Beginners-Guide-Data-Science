This recipe was very cheap, quick, and easy. You do not have to use the name brand ingredients.I mostly used the store brands and it turned out fine. Just be sure not to overload on the cheese or it will stick to the paper towell. :P The hotdog was WONDERFUL!!

These were very easy to make and my family loved them. I added chili to these hot dogs too. I was surprised how good the bacon tasted with the hot dog.

I'm unable to get the ingredients listed in Australia so cooked up my own bacon, pan-fried the onions and grilled cheese on the buns in the oven. Very tasty!

My husband loved this. Grilled a beef hotdog on the grill and then put the rest of the ingredients on the dog and then microwaved. Used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. Left out the onion and used regular shredded cheddar cheese. He said it was a gourmet dog.

Well, it really doesn't get any easier than this! A tasty and super-quick snack. I used our regular bbq sauce, and grated some extra-sharp Cheddar. Great!

QUICK, EASY AND TASTY...YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT. TO MAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT LOWER IN FAT I USED TURKEY HOT DOGS AND LIGHT BUNS. USED MY FAVORITE BBQ SAUCE(SWEET BABY RAY'S). GREAT MEAL IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY.
