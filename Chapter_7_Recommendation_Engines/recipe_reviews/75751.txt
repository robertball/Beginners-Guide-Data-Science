Classic cinnamon toast turned into croutons - genious!  These are slightly sweet, crunchy, and absolutely addictive! I made some cinnamon sugar (1/4 cup of white sugar with 1 tsp. of cinnamon) and put that into a ziploc bag. I cut a loaf of Italian bread (cinnamon raisin bagels would be great with this too) into nice sized cubes and tossed them with melted butter. I tossed the butter coated bread in the ziploc bag and shook them until they were evenly coated. They baked up nicely and smelled great in the oven.  I can see a lot of uses for these if I can manage to put them in a recipe before they're all gone.....

I changed this into a literal 2 minute recipe when I toasted a wheat bagel in the toaster, melted 2 tbsp butter in microwave, mixed it with cinnamon sugar, and then cut up the bagel and lightly mixed it all together.  It was a delicious addition to our apple, cheddar and walnut salad with a dressing comprised of equal parts of  maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil.

I also cubed the bread, melted the butter, mixed in the sugar and cinnamon, drizzled the mixture over the cubes, and tossed it all together.  Worked great!  I imagine all sorts of possibilities for these sweet, crunchy little treats - as a topping for vanilla custard, over ice cream with caramel sauce, or over warm homemade applesauce.  They could be layered into banana pudding with sliced bananas and left in the fridge overnight like you do with 'nilla wafers.  Crunch them up into crumbs and sprinkle on top of your yogurt in the morning.  The sky's the limit!  Think of all the ways that you could use savory croutons, and then apply it to a sweet situation.  Great recipe!

Such an explosion of surprise in your mouth when expecting another old boring crouton.  Absolutely ingenious idea to add to salads with fruit.  I served these with Super Seven Spinach Salad, also from AR, for a dinner party of 8 and all requested the recipe which is a nod to the submitter of the sheer goodness of these croutons!  Thank you jenrogers03.

So simple and tastes so good.  I made them as stated, spreading the butter on the bread and then tossed them in a bowl with the cinnaman sugar.  I used a dark pan so brought oven down to 350--took exactly 20 min.  I was afraid they might not stay crisp for the next day, but they were perfect on a romaine lettuce salad with strawberries and blueberries.

I didn't read the recipe through & cubed the bread before I realized that I was supposed to spread it w/ softened butter. So I melted some butter & tossed the bread cubes, then added the cinnamon sugar & tossed it. This was a very nice addition to a salad w/ pears but my 18 mo old granddaughter loves to eat them as a snack. Great idea....thanks!

These are really good and easy!  I only made a half batch since I'm using up some old applesauce bread.  Be careful and watch the oven times--it's possible bc my bread was already stale that this happened, but a few croutons burned so I'll try a few minutes less next time.  thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I melted the butter, tossed with the bread cubes then shook it in a bag with the cinnamon sugar. Served this atop "Strawberry Romaine Salad II".

Easy, simple, very tasty. They did remind me of the taste of cinnamon toast a bit though. I used whole wheat bread, and threw them in a salad with strawberries, arugula, walnuts and almonds.   I used about half of the butter, and they still came out fine.

So easy and good! I just used non-stick cooking spray and sprayed them and sprinkled with a cinnamon/sugar mixture and baked till crispy.  Nice little snack.  I was trying to find a way to use up my homemade french bread and I made half of these and garlic croutons.  So quick and easy!

I like this.  I use it for bread Pudding.  I store it in an air tight container and measure it out for bread pudding for one. I used prun bread and was it ever good.

I wanted a quick recipe for savory croutons made with white bread. I used this recipe as a basis for garlic white bread croutons. I buttered the bread on one side and cut into 16 pieces. I then tossed the buttered pieces in a ziplock bag with garlic salt. I spread the croutons on a baking sheet. They seemed dry so I sprayed them with vegetable oil (Pam). I baked the croutons for about 8 minutes, tossed slightly and then baked for about another 8 minutes. Turned them out onto a bed of romaine and sliced chicken. Great stuff! No need for ciabatta or French bread - these were perfect.

I LOVE these things!  I have made them several times with white sandwich bread and french bread.  I find it easier to melt the butter and brush onto each slice front and back.  If you want to stack your slices to cut this works best.  When I smeared the butter on and tried to stack the bread slices in order to cut several pieces at one time, the pieces got stuck together and I had to separate each one of them.  That's not a big deal, but brushing the melted butter on them keeps the pieces from sticking to one another. Also, don't skimp on the cinnamon sugar, generously apply.  I like to just sit and eat them out of a plastic baggy.  YUM! They would probably be good on top of oatmeal.

Super easy!  I had a few leftover mini croissant from a baby shower, so I cubed those and tossed with melted butter and then the cinnamon sugar. Only needed about 5 minutes or so of bake time since they are so light.  Delicious!

Delicious and so addicting! I added these to pumpkin soup. Five minutes in the oven is fine, 10 minutes would have burned the croutons.  A perfect ratio for cinnamon sugar is: 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon.
