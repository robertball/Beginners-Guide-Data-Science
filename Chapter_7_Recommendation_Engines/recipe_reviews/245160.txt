Super easy recipe. I added 1/2 cup currents and subbed 1/2 cup each of almonds, walnuts and sunflower seed for the one cup of pecans.  Also used 1/2 cup flax flour for the almond flour. Came out crunchy and delicious.

This granola is good because it is so low in sugar! I use it as a starter recipe. I add cinnamon, unsweetened coconut, chia seeds or whatever else I may have on hand. I stick to low sugar by not adding the dry fruit. This is simple healthy! My grandkids love it in their yogurt.

Sorry, this was unbelievably bland, even with the addition of dried cranberries, vanilla, and cinnamon. I'll use a different granola recipe next time.
