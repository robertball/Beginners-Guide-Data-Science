I have baked all kinds of goodies over the years but never made chocolate chip cookies.  Found this recipe to be easy to make and the cookies are delicious.  I made two batches, one with the shortening and without.  The cookies without the shortening tasted much better. Enjoy!!

An absolutely marvelous recipe as is, though I did make some changes that worked better for me.
I used salted butter rather than unsalted and omitted the 1/2 tsp of salt called for in the recipe.   I upped the baking time to 14 minutes to bake completely, but that may just be the fault of my oven temperature control.

I made them, they were fabulous. The only change I made was half cup butter and half cup shortening. I knew the trick about cinnamon along time ago, I like the texture of these cookies, they were chewy and didn't flatten out.

I didn't have enough flour for what this recipe called for. I ended up using 1 &1/4 Cup of flour. It turned out fine. However, I'm not big on the cinnamon. I think I'd leave it out if I make these again.

It was very good and there were lots of chocolate chips in the recipe for those chip lovers.  Would definitely make it again.

Delicious! I added only 2 cups of chocolate chips and that was more than enough. Didn't bother with the drizzle as the shortening-mix wasn't appealing. The cinnamon and vanilla were delicious accents! A keeper added to my recipe box!
