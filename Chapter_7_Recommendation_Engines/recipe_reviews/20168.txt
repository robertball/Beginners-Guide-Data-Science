I think this recipe needs more flour. I would also omit the pinch of salt. The rolls are salty enough with the cheese and self-rising flour in them. They are light and fluffy and packed with parmesan/dill flavor! I think the baking time can also be cut back to 12 - 15 minutes.

HELP! This is a great recipe but the measurements must be wrong because there is too much liquid. They flatten out like cookies. Even though they don't work they still taste great. Would love to have the correct recipe. I have tried this three times with all same results. Help!

These did not look like rolls - they looked more like cookies.  I did not care for the flavor either.  I love dill & parmesan - but the flavor was a bit over-powering

Great taste but no substance.  I had the same result as the previous reviewer.

This also produced flat rolls for me too -- they looked like fluffy cookies!  The second time, I left out all of the salt (I used all purpose flour and added 1tsp of baking powder, no salt)and put the batter in my mini-muffin tins to bake.  It came out perfectly.  These are actually better the next day because the dill flavor has more time to develop.  Very good with soup.  I did think that maybe the "flat rolls would make good sandwiches to use one for the top and one for the bottom. . .

Darned tasty scones, with a few tweaks.  I doubled the recipe (instructions below are for the doubled quantities).  I omitted the salt, used regular flour + 1.5 Tbsp baking powder, halved the parm cheese.  Just used about 1/4 cup water and used salted butter.  Added about 1/4 cup extra flour.    Poured onto baking tray and scored into triangles.  Baked about 10 minutes at 350, then another 5 at 400.  Came out awesome, very crisp & dilly, with the right amount of salt.  Next time I would probably increase the milk slightly and decrease the butter to make it healthier.   Maybe add more baking powder, too (they came out light, but not super-light).

I followed advice from the other reviewers and went easy on the liquids while using more flour. However, I had another problem, which was that my rolls started out smelling wonderful but were very burnt on the outside by the time they were done. I may try this again at a lower temperature and possibly longer cook time.

These were not very good.  First batch came out like flat cookies, just like others mentioned.  Second batch I used the suggestion for no salt and baking powder instead. Save your time and move on to another recipe.  Sorry:(

These sounded so good, I just had to try them despite some of the reviews. You definitely need to add more flour whether you double the recipe or not. I doubled the recipe then added another 2/3 cup flour and baked them in a muffin tin. They came out wonderful!

This was pretty good.  There was definetly a lot of cheese in it and it tasted pretty cheesy.  They were small, but kind of like scones.  It tasted pretty good though.

Very tasty!  I agree with the other reviewers.  I had to take away some liquid.  Also, I signficantly reduced the Parmesan.  I would probably reduce it further next time I make it.  It was a nice taste for a change!

They were not my favorite.  We found them somewhat tasteless and definitely missing something.  Taking the other reviews into consideration I started with 1 C of flour and 1.5t of baking powder but the rest of the recipe remained the same. They held a nice dropped shape, were not flat and baked at 375 for 20 minutes they were golden brown and gorgeous.  For us it needed more salt, maybe some onion, garlic, or herbs to round them out.

Good bones to this recipe. I made it according to instructions but used fresh dill so I doubled that one thing (dried herbs are usually stronger than fresh) I also used a muffin tin as the original photo that attracted me to this recipe appeared to use one. The husband is requesting I add this to my recipe book as he wants more!

The recipe as written would have been a disaster. It is as thin as a pancake batter. I added 1/3 cup more flour, cut back on cheese and cooked this in muffin tin. They came out great.. when tweaked
