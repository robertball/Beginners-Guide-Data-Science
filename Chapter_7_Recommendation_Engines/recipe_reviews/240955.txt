This recipe is very plain. There isn't any seasoning at all. I added extra garlic, fresh basil, salt and pepper to boost the flavor. I also added about 8 ounces of quartered mushrooms along with some tomato sauce. Next time I make this dish I think I'll try roasting the veggies for an even bigger boost of flavor.

I received several small eggplants from my daughter's garden, but what to do with them?   Allrecipes to the rescue!  This sounded the easiest, so I made it!  Absolutely a winner!  I used whole grain pasta, added a half onion in the sauté of garlic. I could only find Hunts Italian diced tomatoes so I used that. Let me tell you, this was superb. Very light tasting!  Not heavy like some pasta dishes can get. My father-in-law and husband had second and third helpings!  I gave a container to my vegetarian granddaughter and she loved it too!  I will definitely make this again.

Quick, easy and tasty! I added a bit of fresh basil and used penne pasta instead of rigatoni.

I really liked this recipe.  After reading the reviews, I decided to use it as a “base” recipe.  I added fresh basil and oregano from my garden, salt and pepper to the sauce,  and used only one garlic clove.  Next time, I will add onion with the garlic.  Grated Parmesan was good over the top.  This is a keeper!

I'm not sure why this recipe is getting less than 5 stars, all recipes are a canvas for folks to add to. It's a basic description with thorough instructions on how to prepare and cook a simple, easy dish. This can obviously be changed to an individual's liking... Anyways, I added multi-peppers, sesame seeds, portabella mushroom pasta sauce, lots of herbs/seasonings & udon pasta. I left out the garlic, not my preference. It's delicious!!!

 Great recipe for someone looking for a lower sodium, super easy meal.... Just add whatever else you want..

I'm giving this 3 starts because as others mentioned it has little taste. I cook a lot (vegetarian/vegan) so many of these recipes tend to be dull unless you are experienced with cooking vegetarian/vegan, i.e., you need to add a lot of spices for flavor otherwise it is BORING.
I DOUBLED the amount of garlic, added 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes & 1 tsp. of Italian flavor seasoning powder which improved the taste of this otherwise lackluster recipe.

I salted slices of peeled eggplant and let it sit for 30 minutes. I washed off the salt and then cut the slices into cubes.  I put the eggplant on a baking sheet with 1/2 of the tomatoes, mixed in some  Italian seasonings and roasted the vegetables for 20 minutes at 375 degrees.  The eggplant stays firm cooking it in this manner.   In the meantime I cooked some sweet Italian chicken sausage, and then mixed in the remaining 1/2 of the tomatoes, and allowed it to cook on low.  I mixed in the roasted vegetables and served it over noodles.  The dish was quite good.

Fast and easy, but needed some herbs (and salt) to make it less boring.

Very good! I used the Italian canned tomatoes to add extra flavor. And sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top. Easy to make.

Too much garlic for me! I added extra red & green pepper plant with mushrooms and cinamon.
