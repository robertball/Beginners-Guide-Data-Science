Solid recipe (I have used several) with clear instructions for those who are new to the method. I substitute Ricotta (my Italian heritage!) for the cottage cheese, and it seems to blend in more smoothly. I always do a few without extras, then diversify with various dairy, meat and/or veggie add-ins for the rest depending on what I have in the fridge.. As an ICU nurse working 12+ hour shifts, this works nicely for me to make ahead and enjoy throughout the week;  I always double the batch.

Thank you for a great recipe!  I make ours in the small jelly jars.  Several times I taken a few out early while they are still slightly runny so when they are reheated they donâ€™t over cook.
