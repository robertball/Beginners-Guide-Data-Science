I don't miss regular potatoes when I get to eat these fries! I love them! For a crispier version, toss the sweet potato sticks in a beaten egg white instead of olive oil, then season and bake. YUM!

These were good but I added rosemary, thyme, garlic and season salt.  I think that the temperature is way too high at 450, I roasted mine at 350 and then increased it to 400 the last 10 min and they were great. I also flipped them and added more olive oil half way thru.

I am not on the South Beach Diet, and tend to fry everything rather than baking, because my husband and I love crunchy food, so I was hesitant about trying this recipe.  However, when they came out of the oven, smelling great, I was quite impressed!  The potatoes came out great, and did not lack any of the crunch that I love in my fries. My husband thought they were out of this world and could not tell that they had not been fried.  This makes me want to consider baking more often.

Great taste but you have to babysit them in the oven. Looking back, I definitely think that 450 is way to high. I'll try them again with a lower degrees.

Mine also came out burnt and mushy... The tips were burnt but the center didn't have time to crisp up at all yet. Next time I'll try reducing the heat and baking for MUCH longer, or even use egg whites as suggested. A lot of fries also stuck to the pan, so make sure to turn them very frequently. The taste was really good though, so I'll definitely try again.

I followed the recipe, but mine never crisped... just got mushy in the center and burnt on the edges.

Fantastic! My parents both hate sweet potatoes, but I didn't tell them I used them, they just assumed I had a different type of seasoning. They loved it! I used the Safeway Garlic and Red Pepper seasoning with olive oil, and tey came out beautifully. Thank you for the inspiration!

So good and naturally sweet - they don't even need syrup or sugar!  Sweet potatoes are so much healthier than white potatoes - give them a try!

Spray the pan and then the top of the potates when doing baked sweet potatoe fries,..  it helps them crisp up without the additional fat of the olive oil. They are also really good when tossed with garlic salt for a twist. We have these at least twice a month. =)

For quite awhile now I've been doing something like this for a quick lunch side dish.  I slice the potatoes very thinly and lay them out on a sprayed cookie sheet.  I drizzle olive oil and then sprinkle creole seasoning on them and  bake them at about 375-400 until they are done.  (If the thicknesses of the sweet potatoes are at all different, some will burn to a crisp while others will still be soft, so you really have to watch the time.)  This is a very kid-friendly vegetable.  My son thinks they are a TREAT!  We love them with ketchup.

This was delicious.  My kids even loved it.  I used spray Pam olive oil cooking spray instead of olive oil.  They turned out great, browned, and we saved on fat and calories!!

These are pretty easy and tasty. I turned the temp down to 375 but still had a hard time getting them crispy and keeping them from burning. Overall I liked the taste just need to work on temp and time for cooking. My kids liked them with butter and cinnamon sugar sprinkled on them.

I love the flavor of these sweet potatoes. I also turned the heat down a bit, and have to work on getting the crispyness.  But they were very flavorful. Will make this one again.

These were very good, not as crisp as I would have liked, but very good tasting.  I used cajun seasoning on them instead of salt and pepper, and next time I'll try an egg-white wash to see if that crisps them up.

Nice and simple recipe.. These weren't that crispy, so I'd try and toss them in egg white like KAITCH said (review below) to make them crispier.  But they were good with our Thanksgiving meal.  They do need to be turned quite a bit in the oven- I turned them 3 or 4 times, but probably could have turned them more!

This did not turn out at all. I think either I sliced the sweet potatoes too thin, or 450 degrees is just WAY too hot. They were mushy after 25 minutes, but never got crisp... except the ones that were burnt, I guess.

We also add cajun spices instead of the salt and pepper.  They go great with fish.

Delicious!  Everyone in my family LOVED this recipe!  I took previous advice and baked them around 375, but then decided to broil them on low for a few minutes to add some crisp to them.

Great texture.  I add cinnamon and sugar to the salt and pepper, and they turn out great.
