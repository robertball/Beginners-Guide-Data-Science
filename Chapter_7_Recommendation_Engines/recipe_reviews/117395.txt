I added a teaspoon of garlic powder, mixed in some chopped green onions, a pinch of dried red peppers (the ones that usually come with pizza, haha) drizzle in some balsamic vinegar (red, white, doesn't matter) and then topped it off with some extra left over chopped green onion.

The green onion and balsamic vinegar gave the bruschetta mixing a little more 'zing!'. So if you're looking for that, this is it.

Very delicious. :]

YUM! These went super fast at the table. I' m glad I doubled the recipe or I would have had to look at a few grumpy faces during dinner! I love using cherry tomatoes for this - diced up about as small as possible and it really compliments the flavor and consistency.  This is by far one of the family favorites and its in the top 10 of my all time favorite recipes. A beautiful food!

tried this last I toasted both sides of the french bread with a coating of olive oil and used the recipe and they were delicious so this is another recipe that will get filed away and used again.

I've never had bruschetta so I can't make a comparison to a "true" one.  I made this as is, except that I added the tomatoes on top after baking because I can't handle fresh tomatoes cooked.  Had a good flavor but noticed I couldn't eat very much at once.  I also think everything needs about doubled for that amount of bread - just didn't seem like there was much on the bread.

Great recipe!  Delicious and easy to prepare.  I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder for a little more flavor.  A definite crowd pleaser.

I made these for my sister's going away party and everyone loved them! At the start of the night, when they were still warm and later after they had cooled off. People were munching on them all night.

YUM, YUM, YUM! I made this to go alongside our pasta dinner tonight and it was greatly enjoyed. I have to say that I more or less eye-balled the ingredients and also added in some garlic powder. I also chose to toast the bread under the broiler, and after putting on the topping, I threw it under the broiler again to get all brown and bubbly (this mixture was enough to cover 12 regular sized slices of italian bread). I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The mayo was an overpowering flavor; I think that I prefer more traditional bruschetta recipes.

first, i love seeing a bruschetta recipe that starts with the bread.  "real" bruschetta is just toast with stuff on it.  and this had plenty of "stuff".  i'm not sure about the mayo, though.  i'll try using less next time.

We enjoyed this.  I wouldn't call it love at first bite, but it was a nice light dinner for us.  I too, like someone else suggested, was a little overwhelmed by the mayo here.  It tasted good, it was just a bit much.  I might cut the mayo in half next time.  I pre-toasted my bread in a skillet with a little salted butter, then baked it with the topping.  I think this really added something to the "bruschetta-ness" of it, although I am by no means a bruschetta expert.  Also, I thought the tomato mix could use a little salt and perhaps a few other spices so next time I will add a few more.  All in all, a solid, satisfying evening snack, and I will definitely make it again!

I have never commented on anything, but this is SO worth it.  I made this for 4 people and it was gone in a matter of minutes.  i did add a little garlic powder to the mix and oiled both sides of bread (as previously mentioned) i also put some extra Parmesan cheese on both sides as I toasted it and it just gave it some extra flavor.  This recipe is saved in my favorites forever! I posted my picture on Facebook and had multiple people ask when they were coming over for some!!  DEFINITELY TRY THIS RECIPE!

This recipe reminds me of Paula Deens Tomato pie!  Excellent! I skipped the Basil as I am not a big fan, but otherwise followed this exactly, thanks for sharing!

Fabulous!!! I have made this twice, and I think this recipe is hard to mess up! You can use any cheese you like and it is still good. The second time I made it with swiss, muenster, and parmesan cheese, because it was what we had on hand. My husband and I liked it even more! Both times I replaced the mayo with light miracle whip and used grape tomatoes instead of regular and I added some green onion and red wine vinegar: works out great! Love love love it!

Wonderful! I love bruschetta - and this is one of my fav's.  for those who find mayo taste a bit strong- I suggest this slight change, brush the bread with your fav extra virgin olive oil  - you can be a bit generous here and halve or quarter the amount of mayo per your generosity with the oil.  Mayo is a very basic condiment - and at its most basic form, its oil, pasteurized egg and a splash of vinegar for that mayo bite (I personally dont add the vinegar :)) - if you make your own and there are great recipes on allrecipes for the mayo, the difference will amaze you. the evoo and half store bought mayo will do the trick otherwise.  I do love your recipe Vicki :) very quick and easy - and above all, delicious! :)

This was a nice change from regular bruschetta and very colorful.  I used grape tomatoes because that’s all I had.  I diced them up and didn’t worry about seeding them, but a lot of the seeds got left behind on the cutting board anyway.  I made half of the recipe and just eyeballed the amount of grape tomatoes.  I also added a clove of garlic and some chopped green onions.  I deviated from the recipe by lightly toasting my bread slices on both sides under the broiler.  Added the cheddar spread and broiled again.  Here’s a little tip:  whenever I make a bread recipe like this I make sure to spread the topping all the way to the edges of the bread.  This helps keep the edges from burning.

WOW!  Another reviewer mentioned her guests enjoyed these cold.  How many did she have to make for them to last that long????  I used 2% cheese and lite mayo and added 1 tsp of garlic powder to a double batch. They were gone in 5 min.  Next time I will quadruple the recipe.

Husband loves it. He's not a huge fan of traditional bruschetta, so adding the cheese and making it creamier with the mayo made it much better for him. Personally, I found it a bit rich, but I'll make it again. Definitely recommend adding some garlic and brushing some olive oil on both sides of the bread before toasting it.

I would usually only use oil and vinegar with tomato and onion, but wanted to try something new. I didn't have most of the original ingredients, so I can't give a 5 rating. I used the cheddar cheese, oregano, and mayo... but added a baby cucumber skinned and sliced, a few sprigs of dill, about a half tsp of garlic powder, and half tsp of mustard powder. was excellent! No doubt would be even better with Parmesan too, next time. The best tips from this recipe is to seed the tomatoes, toast the bread before, and add mayo! thanks

absolutely delicious although i used fresh basil with mine by chopping it up finely and adding it to tomatoes, i took out the mayo because it didn't sound appetizing and ended up drizzling balsamic over the top of it once cooked... times and temps greatly appreciated though.

I tried this recipe the other night for an Italian night with friends and it worked great!  I substituted Alfredo sauce for the mayo and used a white cheese blend, several asked for the recipe.

This recipe is excellent!!!!  A must try for sure.  Great for serving to your guest as an appetizer with a glass of wine before sitting at the table.  I did put about 1 Tbsp less of the mayo.  I will be doing this one again for sure.

Was out of oregano but still good. I only had  store bought rosemary & sage bruschettes, they added more flavor.  Very good quick little snack/appetizer. Next time will use less mayo.

Did as another reviewer suggested: added a tsp. of garlic powder and some chopped green onions. Really delicious.  Also, if you can get it, try using Duke's mayo. It adds a unique and great flavor to anything with mayo in it.

I have now made this for SEVERAL parties. It is a huge hit. Rave reviews by everyone and the plus side to this is it takes 5 minutes to make. I have even taken this to a outdoor picnic without the option to bake so I pre-toasted the bread and home and served the topping cold and it was still a hit. I will continue to add this in my bring a dish to pass list!

In a word, delicious! A simple recipe with a great result... but it really does make A LOT of bruschetta! However its the perfect amount to serve at a party and I would highly recommend this tasty recipe!

I have made these twice in one week! I was alittle apprehensive with trying this recipe knowing the "normal" recipe would not call for cheddar cheese, but I was plesently pleased! Everyone at the dinner parties praised this bruschetta recipe!

We love bruschetta and have tried many versions, at home and at restaurants. This version was fine, but not as good as traditional bruschetta. With "cheddar" in the title, I expected a stronger cheddar flavor, but I could barely detect any cheddar at all. My wife did not have any comments about it at all, which is usually not a good sign.

This was nothing special to me & was one of the last things to go at my New year's party.  It just seemed to be missing something (and I even subbed garlic salt for regular salt) & I made it as written (aside from the garlic sub obviously).  Also, I would suggest doubling the ingredients for 24 baguette slices because there was for sure not enough per slice....

I've used Allrecipes for lots of new ideas, but this is the first recipe that I'm actually going to rate. THIS WAS AMAZING!!! So yummy! The mayo in it, doesn't mask the flavor of the ingrediants at all. I did use grape tomatoes and chopped them up really finely, just so that it was sweeter. Also I mixed in some fresh cut cilantro. AMAZING! Had it last night, and today I'm suffering from the amount of carbs I ate! haha.

this was a very tangy, tasty spread.  i'm taking off a star though because it is nothing like actual bruschetta and should rather be called a spread.  it definitely got good reviews for my ladies night out!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I used one full cup of cheddar cheese instead of a 2/3 cup, cherry tomatoes for extra flavor and baked the bruschetta for around 20 minutes instead of 10.  It was excellent.

I made this recipe for a party and it was a big hit.  I was in a hurry and actually had all the ingredients need including fresh tomatoes from my garden and was able to make this recipe from start to finish in about 25 minutes.  Thanks for a fast, delicious recipe.
