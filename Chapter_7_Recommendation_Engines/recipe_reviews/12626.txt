this pie turned out great, although I made several changes (kind of combining it with another recipe on this site).  First, I made a Vanilla Wafer cookie crust rather than graham crackers, and doubled the chocolate layer.  Then, after making the filling I mixed in flaked coconut, using vanilla instead of whiskey.  I then made a top layer using Cool Whip, and sprinkled with toasted coconut.  Before serving, I decorated each serving with chocolate sauce.  YUM!!!

Excellent flavor!  However, the crust fell apart, so I used another recipe for a graham cracker crust (1-1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs + 6 Tbsp. butter + 1/2 cup granulated sugar).  The bittersweet chocolate/heavy cream mixture was not enough, so I had to double it.  I used Irish cream liqueur instead of Irish whiskey, and instead of topping the pie with 1 cup heavy whipping cream (whipped), I used lite whipped topping (like Cool Whip).

I really liked this pie.  It was very easy to make.  I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it.  I made some small changes.  I added vanilla to the filling along with the whiskey.  I also whipped up some extra cream and folded about a third of it into the filling to make the filling a little lighter tasting.  The bittersweet chocolate was an awesome flavor addition.  I had to add a little extra cream when I was melting the chocolate so that the chocolate wouldn't seize.  The pie was definitely better after chilling for a day.  The flavors were much more intense.

I love this recipe,LOVE how the cream is not banana flavored. However I have made changes that have for me enhanced it.  I use Irish Cream instead of Irish whisky and I also do a different crust (I'm not a grahm cracker crust fan) I make a vanilla wafer crust (3 cups crushed vanilla wafers, 1/2 cup chopped toasted almonds and 2/3 cup butter, it makes way more than what a pie pan needs but I have yet to modify it and write it down). So yummy.

This was amazing! I used amaretto instead of whiskey and added coconut to the whipped cream.
My date for the evening was extremely impressed and insisted on taking a couple slices to work the next day.  ;-)

This one was okay. I think I should have let the filling boil a little longer because it seemed a little watery. (could also be the rainy weather). My husband and kids liked it, to me it was a little bland. I will use the whiskey next time instead of the vanilla.

The bittersweet chocolate lining was the only thing that let this recipe down. It was too bitter, I should have used ordinary chocolate or eliminated it altogether. 
For the base I used dark chocolate digestive biscuits and butter (no sugar) as I don't have Graham Crackers where I live. 
The custard was yummy but I was worried about it tasting of flour so added extra whisky. Next time I will add a split vanilla bean along with the whiskey. 
Overall this is a great recipe, just amend it to suit your taste.

Sorry, maybe it was just a matter of personal taste, but I was not impressed with the flavor of this recipe. Texture was good, just wasn't what I thought it would be. I thought the filling was a bit on the bland side.

Perhaps it is just me, since the other raters seemed to enjoy it, but I defintely was not a fan of the "filling." To me this tasted like raw dough. Also the bittersweet chocolate was too bitter and the graham cracker crust crumbled easily.

Made as directed. It is the best pie I have ever eaten. I've tweaked the recipe based on what I had on hand & it was still excellent. You can't miss with this recipe.

This had such a weird bland taste of the whipping cream maybe?...and ther wasn't enough chocolate to make it even close to decadent.  Also didn't care for the bland taste mixed with whiskey taste...nobody liked this in our house...they all said the same thing.

Have made this MANY times, even my 5 yr old helped. Did not change a thing, definitely use whiskey, gives it such a different flavor mixed with all the sweet chocolate and banana!

This pie was creamy and delicious. I left out the whiskey ingredient and used good vanilla. The chocolate lining gave it extra depth. It helped to keep the graham crust from getting soggy. I used half milk chocolate and half semi sweet chocolate for the lining. YUM!

This is good. I doubled the chocolate and cream (used non-dairy cream and it worked fine). I used Amaretto liquor because i didn't have Irish whiskey but it was a bit overpowering and I think I'd leave it out next time.

It was a really good recipe, the filling didn't look all too appetising so i just used extra banana and maybe a half of the filling. I also didn't use whiskey only because I didn't take my I.D with me to the shop XD! It was nice, couldn't find anywhere that sells grahm crackers so I used digestives instead, it was nice. And the shop close to my house didn't carry bittersweet chocolate so I used cooking milk chocolate which proved to be super nice! The only reason this recipe only got three stars is because I grew up loving banana cream pie that my grandpa made and this..even though it was nice, didn't compare very well. Sorry. Might make again.

this was a good recipe, but the flavor was lacking something. The addition of the Irish Whiskey is a GREAT subtle flavor that was a real treat for both the filling and the topping. Additional constructive criticism would be appreciated. Thanx.

I used more whiskey than called for, and the flavor was still really subtle.  I also doubled the chocolate layer, since I was baking for another chocolate lover like myself.  Silky, not too sweet, and delicious flavor.

This is the best pie!!!!!  The chocolate lining adds just the right amount of bitterness to counteract the sweet filling.  Watch the amoung of the bittersweet chocolate though because too much can wreck the flavor.
I don't think the whiskey is completely nessecery if you don't like it, but it does add a tiny bit of flavor.

I followed the directions exactly, except for making traditional whipped cream instead of whiskey whipped cream, as I was afraid my kids wouldn't like the whiskey flavor.  The pie turned out absolutely perfect, and was a huge hit with everyone.

I have been making this recipe for years. Everyone loves it & some don't believe it's homemade. By far the best Banana Cream pie. Sometimes I  swap the Graham cracker crust for my pastry crust & leave out the chocolate lining.

Five stars! I made two the night before our Easter dinner. The chocolate lining on the crust keeps the crust firm, and the pudding and bananas actually taste better the next day. Perfect make ahead dessert. I changed a few things, but a good make ahead dessert is worth five stars. I used quality dark chocolate and didn’t dilute with cream and I substitute vanilla for whiskey. Wonderful

A family tradition.  I love this pie I’m the spring, and make usually at Easter time.  Instead of Irish whiskey, I normally have Jim Beam on hand, so I use that.  I cut the whiskey/Jean beam out of the whipped cream for the kids.

Had been looking for a good recipe for a version of this dessert (banana/chocolate/pudding/cream) based on similarly themed desserts from Max and Irma's and Coastal Flats, both of which are no longer available.  This is close in satisfaction level, but not quite.  Increased the crust amount.  Not nearly attractive as the picture.  Did not even come close with the cream topping consistency, so left it off.  Need more practice making to get the look and textures better but the taste is good!

The texture of this pie was just not for me.  It was a lot of trouble, too.   My husband and I each ate one piece but my adult children wouldn't even try it.  I won't make this one again.

I gave this pie two tries.  The second time when I made sure I followed the directions meticulously and was disappointmented.  Unappetizing color, and the custard tasted too floury. So, sorry --

Awesome pie! I made it vegan, using a walnut crust, mixed the chocolate with 2 Tbs. almond milk and 1 tsp. tapioca starch (perfect!), and used a coconut whipped cream. I added about 1/4 tsp. SALT to the custard, which I think helped the blandness (although I might up it to 1/2 tsp.), and I don't do alcohol, so I used 1 Tbs. vanilla instead (might try 2 Tbs. next time, but only had 1). I also added 1 cup unsweetened coconut to the custard after it thickened, which complimented the coconut whipped cream nicely. My first cream pie without pudding mix and it was super easy and delicious! The chocolate is a must!
