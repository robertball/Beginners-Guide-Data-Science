A winner at our house. No mozzarella but used provolone, no problem. Subbed ricotta for mayo (used about a tablespoon of mayo to keep consistency smoother) Stuck with the garlic, spread about a tablespoon of parmesan over the reviewers' suggested mayo on crust. Also, from another recipe, dipped the tomatoes in flour before putting them down on crust. I was determined not to have a soggy crust, and I succeeded! 
The cheese mixture was still a little thick and hard to spread evenly. But it was creamy good once cooked.

My grandmother made this same recipe as did my Aunt Nina and several ladies in our community when I was growing up, although some did substitute green onion or minced onion for the garlic because at the time garlic powder wasn't readily available and fresh garlic wasn't always something they had in their gardens.  Some used dill instead of basil because that is what they grew to make their dill pickles. There is a reason to salt the tomatoes, to draw out the moisture so the pie is not soggy.  If you slice them thinly there is no need to skin them.  Many southern recipes are handed around from person to person with no one knowing who came up with the original.  This one is good but if you want one that is truly EXCELLENT  try the one on Sweet Tea and Cornbread's blog, it is even richer and creamier than this one -- and I loved my GRANNY's tomato pie, but ST&C just takes it over the top.

I decreased the amount of garlic and put in half an onion, as that's the way my family always made it. I also used dried basil, as I didn't have any fresh and it was just as good. Tomato pie has been around down here as long as anyone can remember; it's a staple at southern luncheons and family gatherings. It's a staple dish in old family cookbooks, and it's a dish that many young women learn to make when helping their mothers in the kitchen. The recipe changes from person to person and region to region, but underneath it's the same delicious tomato pie that all of us know and love. Paula Dean deserves credit for introducing it to a wider audience, but I'll bet you anything this was a dish she learned from her momma. So while some people may have learned this recipe from watching cooking shows, many of us learned to cook this from our mothers, aunts, and grandmothers, in a kitchen full of love and laughter and the warm aroma of southern cooking.

Absolutely delicious and easy. I only made one change. I coated the prepared, cooled,crust with mayo. I have had other Tomato pies get a soggy crust. This might have helped, but, the pie didn't last long enought to find out. A real keeper for fresh tomatoes and basil.

I hate to give something 5 stars when I've altered the recipe, but I didn't change it much.  I omitted the garlic and added thinly sliced onions instead.  It was unbelievably delicious.  Will be making this again and again and again!

Have cooked this twice.  Both times came out excellent.  Spreading the mayo at the end can be a little hard but I found a butter knife works better than a spoon.

I used frozen crusts and pre-baked crust, added all ingredients, and then put in the fridge for cooking near the time of the pot luck I was going to.

When it came time to cook several hours later I had no problems with sogginess, it came out great!  Wouldn't change a thing.

I subbed the mayo for ricotta and used a parm/swiss cheese mixutre (inspired by the submitter's suggestion).  The girls and I enjoyed this as a main dish.  After the pie set it was easy to cut into bite size pieces for my one year old and the three year old liked the idea of eating pie for dinner.  I'm excited to try this again with some garden fresh tomatoes.

This was really delicious Elizabeth and such a great way to use up our bumper crop of tomatoes! My only addition was adding seasonings to the mayo along with some parm. Hubby LOVED this and thank you!

This is great as is. If you wanted to make it into a heartier main dish, add crumbled bacon and top with buttered bread crumbs!

The only thing I changed was I left out the garlic and used some chopped green onions, instead.  I also added just a bit of fresh mozzarella underneath the cheddar, mozz, and mayo mixture on top (just needed to use it.)  I also skipped the step of salting the tomatoes simply because I didn't see it!  I made my own pie crust from a recipe on this site and it was stupendous! The one piece that was leftover (it was just my husband and me eating it) was delicious the next day for lunch, also.

My family absolutely loves this savory pie! They ask frequently when I'll be making this again. Made it as directed and came out beautifully, but certainly lends itself to variations on the recipe.

Made this last night as is except I put about 1/8 cup mayo instead of 1/4 cup - wonderful!  Very similar to Paula Deen's recipe.  After my first slice, all sort of thoughts going through my head of other things to add/try next time.  Artichokes?  Spinach?  And feta cheese would be wonderful, too!  will make again for certain.  Bruschetta in a crust!!

This was an excellent recipe!  I also spread the prepared crust with mayo as well as topping the tomatoes with mayo.  What really made this dish special (aside from my fresh heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil) was making my own fresh mayo!  It is very simple to do and really mad a difference!

I needed to add online notes after not being able to locate the recipe after a move. I sprinkle Italian grated cheese and herbs d'provence on the crust before pre baking crust. Then I mix an egg with a large container of ricotta cheese and a tube of French goat cheese, garlic and more herbs. I sliced 7 East Texas tomatoes and placed in a collendar lined with paper towels and sprinkled with salt and sliced a red onion fairly thin. When the crusts cooled I spread some of the ricotta on each crust, topped with tomatoes and onions and spread a little more of the ricotta mixture and bake for 30 min at 350*

Instead of a prepared crust, I made a cornmeal crust incorporated blue cheese and drizzled with a balsamic glaze. When served chilled, I find diced cucumber and red onion slivers make a nice accompaniment.

Great dish. Easy to improvise new variations. Made 2 pies for an appetizer and everyone loved them. Added a dash of pepper and oregano. Didn't have the ambition for a scratch crust, so  used a frozen Marie C. crust. They could also be made as small tarts for finger food.

I had never made a tomato pie and stumbled upon this recipe.  It was so easy.  I have to admit that I added sausage slices for a heartier recipe.  My family wasn't sure about it but once it was had by all, they insisted it MUST go into my recipe box to be made in the future.  I shared it with my co-worker who could not get over how wonderful it tasted!  Best and easy recipe I've made in a long time!

I made a mistake and made this in a deep dish frozen pie crust.  As a result, the filling did not reach the top of the crust.  UGH!  Changes:  I used 1 tsp. of salt and thought it was a little too salty.  Next time, I will use 1/2 tsp. and peel the tomatoes.  I used 1 garlic clove split between the 2 layers, that was just right.  I layered as instructed and added a couple shakes of oregano and couple shakes of crushed red pepper on each layer.  My husband didn't like the cheddar cheese.  I thought it was very good.  It tasted like a pizza in a pie form.  I will definitely make this again in a regular size pie crust.

This was SO delicious and flavorful! I just made a few small changes: Italian 5 cheese blend instead of just parmesan, I added 1/3 c. of chopped scallions, and reduced the garlic by one clove. Next time I will try spreading 2 T. of dijon mustard on the crust at the bottom.

I put a layer of fresh spinach on the crust before adding the other toppings. I’ve never had a soggy crust. Also, add a touch of thyme.

great base recipe.. I added sauteed red onions and fresh baby spinach to my layers. I was also overly generous with my cheese (used 4 different cheddar cheeses) that I sprinkled on top to cover the whole thing. Hubby took one bite and looked at me like he fell in love all over again.

I haven't made this pie yet this summer, but for last 4th of July cookout I made this pie. But my trick to making sure that the tomatoes were not soggy was that I put them on my food dehydrator first. I did not completely dry them out, just only to the point where they were not drippy. I layered the tomatoes, fresh garlic, spinach leaves, mayonnaise mixed with Gouda cheese, and some fresh dill on a pre-baked crust that I had brushed with egg whites just to be more on the safe side. It worked infamously! No sogginess, and the flavors were pretty darn good... At least my family said so and others at The Barbeque scarfed it down as well. Make me wish I had made two pies, and I think this time around I will make it a sheet pie but do the same process. I grow my own basil, thyme, mint, coriander, green onions, chives, and sweet peppers. It's nice to just go out and cut something if I need it. I am thinking of just growing large Planters of basil and putting it throughout my house because it just smells so good! But I do also have lavender growing in the house, so I probably do not need the basil. Haha.

Very good. Everyone liked it a lot and I'll make it again.  My tomatoes didn't give off much liquid after being salted and after sitting for 15 minutes.  So  that the tomatoes would not be too salty, I gave them a  very short rinse with water, patted them dry with paper towels, and then dredged them lightly in flour (like one other poster suggested). I didn't use fresh garlic. Instead, I sprinkled 1/8 tsp of granulated garlic on each of the two layers of tomatoes. I sprinkled the top of the pie with fresh chives. Lastly, I cooked a strip of thick bacon until crisp, chopped it finely,  and sprinkled it on top of the pie for the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking time. Yummy.

I used this recipe sort of as a base. I have a ton of tomatoes coming from the garden so I added an extra layer. On the bottom of the pie crust I added mozzarella and cheddar and some chopped, thick-cut bacon, as well as some grated Asiago and basil. I added the bacon, cheeses and basil between all layers. When it came time for the mayo I mixed in mozzarella, cheddar and Asiago and some coarse ground pepper.  Then I topped with more bacon (we really like bacon) and some fresh basil.  I used about 3 slices of the thick cut bacon total. The whole thing disappeared in about 12 minutes. Now I make two pies because I know they won't last long.

This was fantastic!   I didn't  change a thing. Allowing the tomatoes to sit and patting the excess moisture off I think is key. Next time I'm going to add some oregano though just to give it a little more dimension.

Way too much mayo, and I even cut back on it. It would have been nice with just the cheese and herbs, but the overwhelming amount of mayo killed it for me. Sorry!

I made this for supper tonight and my husband and I loved it.  I made it according to the recipe in the magazine which called for 1/2cup mayo which I think was a bit too much, I'm going to stick with 1/4 cup of mayo.  I also will use chopped onions next time, that sounds good.  Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper

Loved this! Did change it up a bit (sorry)! Added a layer of zucchini between top and bottom tomato layers. Had tons to use up. Put mayo on bottom of crust as others suggested. Also added vidalia onion slices between layers. Top layer was a mixture of mayo, mozzarella, parm, and Italian seasoning, spread over the top. Delicious!

It's just as easy to do 1 layer of all the ingredients instead of 2 layers as the recipe indicates.  Also, I mix the mayo and cheeses -- it's easier to spread on top.  Finally, I add fresh grated parmesan cheese which adds a wonderful flavor.  I add meat when I want to make this side dish a wonderful main course.

Just fixed this as part of Christmas Day luncheon and it was wonderful! It is extremely important that the tomatoes (I used four medium) be ripe and very thinly sliced. Peel them if the skins seem tough. Mine were the vine-ripened type so the skins were tender enough to leave on. 

Also, make sure the tomatoes are VERY dry before assembling the pie or you will be left with a soggy crust.

I did find it most difficult to spread the mayo over the top cheese layer. Next time, I will blend the cheese with the mayo beforehand. 
I did omit the garlic in favor of scallions which my family prefers and added a little fresh-ground pepper. Very tasty take on a time-honored dish.

We love this recipe once tomato season is in full swing. I use heirloom tomatoes & remove the seeds to prevent the dish from being soggy. I'll dice up my ingredients, instead of layering, bc i think the flavors mix better. Fresh basil is a must and any combination of cheeses works great. My fiancee who doesn't really like mayo still loves this dish.

This was wonderful! I made my own crust using the Pie Crust IV, I also used low fat mayo cause thats all I had. This reminded me of eating margarita pizza. My husband and I loved it, we will be making this again. This recipe is a real keeper.

Absolutely delicious!! My father brought home a bunch of tomatoes we had no idea to do with, so I decided to make this pie despite mother's objections.

It didn't turn out bad at all! On my first time doing this, I screwed up a bit on the salting and drying. Instead of shredded cheese, I had slices of chedder and fresh mozzarella. I used this recipe as a loose guide, but had to obviously use more than 1/2 cups worth of mozzarella because it was fresh and wet. I also did not have basil, so I used cilantro instead. I did not use the full 1/4 cup of dried cilantro and just sprinkled it over the tomato layers. Ended up using only about half the 1/4 cup's worth. To combat the issue of non-shredded mozzarella, simply break it into pieces on top of chedder cheese slices with a bit of space (they will spread out when melting!).

Over fears of the pie being runny, I cooked it 15 minutes longer on 275 degrees. Not sure if that made the pie a bit harder or if it's just part of the cooling.

Next time, I'll probably roast my tomatoes first to remove some moisture. The crust seemed a bit affected by my inexperienced drying of the fresh tomatoes.

Made by the recipe except I didn’t have mayonnaise. Used cottage cheese and lined the bottom of the cooled crust instead of putting on top as some suggested. It was delicious!  My husband ate three pieces!  Will make again soon to use summer fresh tomatoes.

I’ve made this numerous times, and its delicious!  In addition to the mozzarella and (sharp) cheddar, I added about 1/4 cup grated fresh Parmesan to the top layer.  In the winter months when I don’t have fresh basil, dried does just fine.

This pie reminds me of Margarita pizza without the tomato sauce. I served it for dinner with a salad. I will be making this again. It will also make a nice side dish.

It was delicious .  I did tweak recipe slightly ( skinned the tomatoes, used oregano instead of basil). And I didn't measure the cheese and mayo. I just didn't what i thought looked like enough.  I find the best way to keep the crust from getting soggy is to put the salted tomatoes on some paper towels for a few hours. It turned out great. I will definitely make again.

I wanted to like it but it was SO salty. I didn't add any additional salt....I believe it was from putting the salt on the tomatoes in an effort to bring the
moisture out of them.

Will make again, a tiny bit putzy (I always say that when I need to mince garlic) but realy easy and delicious. I might add onions as another flavor and I used Pepper Jack instead of cheddar for abit more flavor - adds a pop. Excellent for this time of year when the tomatoes are harvested. (end of Aug.)

Printed this recipe a few years ago and forgot it until I came across it a couple of days ago looking something else. So glad I found it and made it.  It is so very good especially with great summer tomatoes. Will be making again/several more times!

This dish is best served cold but it is delicious!  I used a combination of red and yellow heirloom tomatoes, and scalded them before slicing to make the dish easier to eat . Instead of garlic and basil I used Parsley Patch herb and spice blend, and an Italian-style grated cheese blend, simply because those two items were on hand.  Hubby and I both enjoyed it, but I think it would have been more filling if I had used a recipe and a half in the pie shell. This will definitely become a summer staple!

Made exactly as recipe stated. Used a store bought pie crust and this was unbelievable! My boyfriend and mom kept going back for more! I doubled and made 2 pies and they were outstanding. I really cannot say enough about how wonderful this was.

This was fantastic.  Only problem was too much liquid from tomatoes even though left on paper towels for about 1/2 hour.
Used frozen pie crust instead of making from scratch.  Didn't change anything.  Just delicious, gone is a flash!

Whoa!!  Ease up on the salt you sprinkle on the tomatoes!  I blotted with paper towels but it was WAY too salty.  Ok otherwise, nothing special.

My husband and daughter both asked me to save this one!  A simple dish, fairly low-calorie, with flavors that perfectly complement each other.  I added a bit more fresh basil (maybe just under 1/2 a cup instead of the 1/4 cup called for), but that was the only deviation from the recipe.  This is a delicious main dish for our vegetarian family.

Oh my GOODNESS! Literally! Haha! This was DELICIOUS!! Even though I thought the crust was a little overpowering. I'll be trying filo next time to see if that's more of a balance. I used pre-minced jarred garlic, so I think I added more than the recipe's creator intended, but I definitely wouldn't change that; the extra garlic flavor suits the dish well. I think I also used a little bit less fresh basil because that's all I had on hand, which is another thing I wouldn't do differently. It's a little hard to spread the mayonnaise on the cheese. I kind of globbed it on, then spread it as much as I could, but the wonderful thing is that the mayo seems to spread out as the pie bakes. I would definitely make this dish again, for dinner, brunch, or an appetizer. Tasty, fast, and uses up summer tomatoes!

Delicious!  The only changes I made was I used about 1 Tablespoon dried basil, since I had already cut my fresh for drying, and I pre-mixed the cheeses, basil and garlic for simplicity in add them to the pie.  We will definitely be making this recipe again!

Made this pie twice in the past week.  The first time I followed directions exactly and it was good.  Crust remained crisp and filling tasty, I served it at room temperature.  The second time I made it I used homemade pesto in place of basil leaves and added a layer of thinly sliced onions on top of each tomato layer. So for me it was tomato, pesto, onion, cheese .  After I spread the top with mayo I sprinkled with fried crumbled bacon.  This recipe is a perfect recipe to tweak to your own tastes or to use when you want to use up some leftovers.

I've made this twice now.  I have fresh tomatoes from my garden so this is a keeper.  It is very tasty and just the perfect consistency.    I did as others and spread a thin bit of mayo right on the cooled crust to keep from being soggy.   I probably used more like 4 big tomatoes.  Loved it!

I will make this again.I dipped drained and salted tomatoes in flour as one reviewer suggested.   I blended 1/2 cup basil, garlic and 2 heaving Tbs of mayo, 1/4-1/2 cup ricotta, 4 slices of cooked bacon in food processor and made this my pesto layer. Then I eyeballed the Monterey Jack and cheddar cheese using less than 1/2 cup. My top had more tomato showing  than the pic above. Super yummy. 4 stars only because instruction did not sat to process garlic and I think it was important that it be grated very fine. 5 stars the way I made it. Also I did not bother to peel tomatoes. Used philsbury crust and it came out perfect- not soggy at all.

Next time add 4 tomatoes, 3 was not enough. The basic recipe is good, I would just add more cheese and mayo to fill the pie shell.

We grow our own tomatoes so this was perfect for us. Heirloom tomatoes are extra delicious. This was the greatest savory pie I have ever made

This was easy and quick to make.  I did only use 5 strips of bacon cause that's all I had there was definitely plenty of bacon flavor.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this recipe! I made it with the "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" recipe from the magazine issue this pie was featured in, alongside the grilled corn recipe also featured. The duo was perfect together---

This is YUMMY!    I was little worried about it being soggy after reading all the reviews, so after salting my tomatoes and squeezing out the excess... I dipped them in an egg/water mixture and then panko crumbs.  DELICIOUS!  Great for breakfast!!

I could have used at least 4 tomatoes instead of 3. It left too much crust exposed. I'd only use 2 garlic the next time too. I also think I'll sauté some onions and put that on when layering the ingredients. I did not use any mayo. I drizzled a little EVOO between layers where the mayo would have been spread.  It tasted really good but a bit too garlicky for me.

This recipe is very,very good,tasty, and quick. I had to use a pre maid pie crust.Next time I will definitely make mine. Unfortunately, I had to double the amount of cheddar as my mozzarella was not good anymore. I recommend it and make is as is.

I tried the recipe as written, only adding a bit of chopped onion and it was very good. Even my husband who was skeptical at first, loved it, but joked that it would be even better with meat in it!!

I put goat cheese instead of cheddar and cilantro instead of basil. I love recipes that are amazing on their own but you can also add your own touch to.

Honestly, this recipe was alright. Nothing to write home about. I felt as though it was a little bland and a waste of a pie crust. This would need a few more veggies to compliment the dish and make it less boring. My husband and I could tolerate it, but I will probably not make this again.

Pretty tasty, although I think I used too much garlic, and I probably doubled the cheese. I probably would have rated this a 3, but my husband rated it a 4, and he's normally tougher than I.

I made this pie and fell in love with it, very easy to make and extremely flavorful. I think this is the first time I have made a recipe without altering it at all. I did however make it again and added green onions. I found the tomatoes I got from the farmers market and neighbors homegrown made a much better pie than ones from the grocery store. This has become a once a week meat free meal. All family loves it...

This pie is wonderful! I have made it and given it to the neighbors, and brought it as a side dish for pot lucks. There is never any left and everyone always asks for the recipe. I have even tried it with different cheese combinations. It's great every time. We had so many tomatoes this year I made pies and froze them to have this winter. Not sure how they'll be but hoping for the best! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I follwed the recipe precisely with phenomenal results. Its delicious, but mainly because of the sweet, ripe, end of summer home grown Iowa tomatoes my mom had. If you don't have access to great tomatoes, i wouldn't recommend making this.
