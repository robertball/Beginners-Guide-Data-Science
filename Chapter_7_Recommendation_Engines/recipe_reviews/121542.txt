With my alterations, these were the best savory muffins I have EVER tasted. I used 1  tablespoon of sugar, instead of 1/4 cup. I used 1 teaspoon of paprika instead of cayenne pepper, and I used a lot of grated cheddar , it would have been about 350 grams. I also added an extra 1 teaspoon of baking powder, because I know having a lot of bacon and cheese in them, they would struggle to rise... and the final touch - half a teaspoon of crushed garlic. This made them absolutely divine. I will be suprized if I ever try another savory muffin recipe again!

Great recipe - very versatile.  I increased the baking powder to 1 tablespoon and decreased the sugar to 1 teaspoon.  I made mine into 36 mini muffins and they baked in about 15 min.

I used the basic template of this recipe but i added more cheese plus a 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, extra bacon, garlic, extra cayenne pepper, spring onions (scallions), chopped deseeded tomatoes and a tsp of mixed dried herbs and these tasted amazing. I also added an extra egg and it made the muffins really moist. This is 1 recipe i will keep with me

I followed the suggestion of many and cut the sugar to 1Tb and doubled the baking powder.  I didn't have any sharp Cheddar so I used a mix of Gouda and normal cheddar and up'ed the quantity to 100g.  I omitted the bacon as I just wanted to get some super cheesy muffins.   These turned out great, but next time I will use sharp Cheddar and add some garlic and a few dashs of Tabasco to give them a bit of zing.

These muffins came out wonderfully with the help of alterations from other reviewers.  I cut the sugar to 1 tbsp, increased the baking powder and substituted the cayenne for paprika.  Serving it Christmas morning as a fun side for brunch.  My husband loooves them!  Thanks for the great recipe!

What a great alternative to the sweet muffins I usually make! I sort of cut corners and used some leftover All-Purpose Muffin mix I had left :S They turned out a bit on the sweet side (despite the garlic and onion powders I used), plus I used a Maple bacon...Next time, I will definitely use this recipe :) PS Technically, I SHOULDN'T be rating this recipe as I used a short cut muffin mix, but I'm rating based on the general IDEA of it ^_^

These were pretty good..a little bland, so I ended up drizzling some pure maple syrup on top when they were still warm from the oven.  Nice way to say good morning to the kids...thanks.

Yum yum yum! The only change I made was to add 1/8 tsp onion powder. My bacon was honey maple flavor and these muffins tasted awesome! First time using my brand new oven, took exactly 20 minutes for me. So light and fluffy and delicious, thanks for this recipe!

These weren't terrible but I wouldn't quite call them good.  They didn't have much flavor but were not a bad switch from a sweeter muffin.

These are very good! The only thing I did different was use one more egg because I wanted a more egg-y flavor. It helped them rise as well. Oh, and I used turkey bacon.

Used tips from prior reviews--extra cheese, 1 Tbsp sugar, 1 extra tsp baking powder.  I also used a hand full of real bacon bits instead of chopped bacon strips.  It made 30 mini muffins and they took 20 minutes to bake.  I was surprised at how stiff the batter was, but they rose well.  Will be making this one frequently!

I like the texture, they were more like bacon biscuits vs. muffins.  I added more bacon and reduced the sugar to about 1/8 cup.

I'm not sure what other people look for in a muffin, but this just didn't cut it for me.  These were quite bland and extremely dry.  I was hoping for a moister, more savory texture.  Not even sure how to fix these.

Good but it's missing something. They came out dry and flaky, definitely biscuit texture, not a muffin. Will try adding onions next time. I followed others suggestions and lowered the sugar amt... won't do that next time. They really lack flavor. Also, cooked at 180C, it only took 15 min and nearly burned. The cooking time was way off, at least using my oven.

I made these muffins exactly as the recipe, and they were good but not excellent.  The batter was super thick and the results were fluffy but definitely a biscuit and not a muffin.

Great flavour (I followed Isis's idea of reducing the sugar, swapping cayenne for paprika and increasing the cheese).  Baked in 24 mini-muffin cases for 15 mins, but with several mid-tin casualties!  The unburnt ones around the edges were lovely - and scoffed in minutes with vegetable soup.

I made these a while ago and forgot to rate.  They were delicious.  If you are not watching your calories, they are super good with a smear of cream cheese on them.  They also freeze really well.  I used store bought real bacon bits because my daughter had just gotten braces and couldn't chew meat very well.  Yum!

These hit the spot. I used about 3 tablespoons of syrup in place of the sugar, and got 12 muffins out of the batter. They smelled so good cooking up. Thanks!

I made these muffins for my son's class for the week I had snack duty. It was Monday's snack and the mom's are asking me for the recipe for their picky eaters. Even the teachers wanted the recipe. I'd say it was a hit! =)  I changed it up a bit with the cheese and when I make it again for my family I'll make it spicier.
