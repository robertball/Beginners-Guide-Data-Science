Amazing! These muffins are perfect just the way the are! Moist, fluffy, super yummy; I have also topped them with icing and called them  cupcakes.  

Funny story: I forgot the milk and doubled the cocoa  in one batch (yes, the consistancy was different.....but that is usually the last thing on my radar whilst baking with toddlers....) and they were super delicious and even more fudgy. So now I choose between super yummy muffin, super sinful fudgy dessert, or beautiful chocolate cupcakes.   Thank-you!! :)

This is a good base recipe, though I did need to make some  changes to make it work:

I cut the brown sugar in half, as well as the chocolate chips.  I also needed to use mini chocolate chips, because the full-sized chips sank to the bottom and made quite a mess when eating.

The batter as written is extremely thin, so I upped the WW flour to 1-1/4 cups.  It may benefit from even a bit more dry ingredient, so 1/4 cup of ground flax seed would be a nice idea.  With this increased dry amount, the muffins were still very moist.  I used cow's milk, which worked nicely.

This recipe for chocolate muffins is absolutely wonderful.  It's become our family favorite and I love that it's nutritious.  These taste exactly like cupcakes, so that's often what I call them and the kids eat them as fast as I can make them.  I add 1/4 c. oat bran to the dry ingredients because I find the batter to be very thin and the oat bran makes it a little easier to measure out.  I also cut the sugar down as we try to reduce our sugar intake.  Sometimes I use buttermilk instead of milk and it makes them taste a little richer, but otherwise there's no difference.

These were very good and the kids claimed "tastes just like cupcakes".  I used all purpose flour only because I was out of whole wheat.  I had to add an extra 1/4 cup of mixed almond flour and flax seed and APF to make the batter less runny.  As someone else suggested I swapped out the soy milk for lactose free milk and added vinegar to make a buttermilk.  These were sweet and fluffy.  Great recipe.

This was a great recipe!  I just made a few tweaks: Didn’t want to overmix the muffins, so waited until the end to add the chocolate chips.  I also saw the sugar content was 20 g, so I cut the brown sugar and chocolate chips in half.  My glasses were dirty after I spilled flour on them, so I couldn’t read the measure and put in 1/3 cup cocoa powder instead of ¼ cup.   I didn’t have soy milk, so I used skim cow’s milk.  The only applesauce I could find had high fructose corn syrup so I put that aside and substituted nonfat unsweetened yogurt instead.  After adding the first egg, I realized I had to break it first, so fished it out and tried again.  I think I got the leavening and salt right. Added ½ cup walnuts at the end to make it a little healthier.  Added the oil after they started going into the muffin cups because I forgot it with the wet ingredients (canola oil, didn’t have grapeseed oil).   I got a full dozen + 6 mini muffins out of this recipe.  I noticed that they came out nice on top but a little gooey on the bottom, so I swapped the oven off  the broil setting and put them on bake, on the bottom shelf, for a few more minutes.  With the changes, the muffins came down to 12 g of sugar and 158 calories each (13 muffins assumed), making them just healthy enough to eat when no one is looking.  Meanwhile my family gobbled up the muffins and took away my car keys.

It's actually kind of hilarious how poorly these turned out. Due to my younger sister having a gluten allergy, I made this with almond flour...bad idea. The centers of the muffins completely sunk and it looked like I had baked potholes. Also, use mini chocolate chips. Normal ones sink to the bottom and it's a mess to try to eat.

I made mini muffins for my two girls- they loved them! I cut the recipe in half and used milk instead of soy but they turned out great. Almost feel guilty they are breakfast- almost. Thanks!

Delicious! I’m not sure if I would consider them healthy with a whole cup of sugar. Substituted vegetable oil and cows milk and added a small amount of extra flour. Batter is thin but makes it easier to measure out evenly. Made 18 muffins. Definitely make again.

Amazing! I had to fill the muffin tins all the way up to the top, but it worked out just fine.

The kids loved these but as others stated the batter is very thin.  The chips inevitably fall to the bottom.  I added a little extra flour in an attempt to make it thicker.  I will make these again.

These are excellent! They are great as written, but I thought I'd share a few changes that can also be done:

Coconut milk instead of soy milk, coconut oil instead of grapeseed oil, coconut sugar with a small amount of brown sugar, add chia seeds (about 1/4 cup) and a little extra oil (1/8 of a cup).

Mm mm melting chocolate inside.  Definitely will make these again for my kids.  I did try to make some into mini muffins but they're a little too moist and didn't hold together so well ... But they didn't seem to mind!
