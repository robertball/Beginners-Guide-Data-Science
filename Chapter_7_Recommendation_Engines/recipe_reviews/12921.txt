I made this exactly as stated the first time and found it a bit bland. The second time I added two cloves of garlic, used 28 oz. diced tomatoes and 14 oz. tomato sauce, 4 c. beef broth, 1 c. mushrooms and 1 c. peas and it made a huge difference - everything else was the same. I have also tried this once with ground bison and it was fantastic!!!

This is an excellent basic soup. After reading the reviews I decided to make it heartier with a little more flavor. I left out the celery, added 14 ounce can of kidney beans, instead of bouillon cubes use 5T beef bouillon granules, 2 - 14ounce cans of Italian style stewed tomatoes, 1t black pepper, 1 1/2t Italian seasoning, and 1/4c ketchup. Wonderful flavor...a very hearty meal when combined with Parmesan Herb bread from this site!

YUM! This was so good and I'm not a huge soup fan. I replaced the bouillon and water with three cans of low sodium beef broth and added a cup of ditalini pasta towards the end. Great change of pace from boring vegetable soup!

This is a great basic recipe that lets you play around with the ingredients a bit. I made some adjustments that my family absolutely loved - even my very fussy 3 yr old. I omitted the ketchup and basil, as I'm not really fond of basil combined with beef. I instead added a dash of worchestershire sauce, 1 bay leaf, 1 tbsp dried oregano, plus some about 2 tbsps chopped fresh parsely. Additionally, for flavor, I included 2 finely diced garlic cloves and a 1/2 cup of barley. I think the barley really makes this soup really hearty and tasty, not to mention nutritious! You just add the barley in at the beginning with all the other ingredients and you're ready for a great, cozy winter meal!

What's really nice about Hamburger Soup is that you can subtract or add any ingredient that you wish. I use cubed potato, and add the liquid from the canned veggies, use low-salt beef broth, make a bouquet garnii with bay leaf, oregano, rosemary, dill weed(use in place of salt), and whatever else you desire. Add heat, or not, and it still will come out delicious and satisfying.  Make the soup your own.

This is really great, but I was out of basil and subbed marjoram and I actually think it may be better this way. 1 tsp of salt is too much though, once you figure in the salt from the broth and the tomato sauce. I did 1/2  tsp and it was fine. I also added 1 tsp of black pepper and three small cloves of garlic. I was out of celery, so a tbsp. of celery flakes was fine. To make up for the lack of veggie chunks, I did a full 16 oz of shoepeg corn. I will definitely make this again.

Oh, my!  This is so good!  Quite possibly the BEST vegatable soup I've ever had.  All did different was add some ground pepper.  Served this with French Bread Rolls To Die For from this site.

I was looking for my Grandma's traditional soup, and this is it!  It's so easy and you can let it go in a crockpot all day if you feel like it. Highly recommended.

Most Excellent recipe. I've made this a few times and always always make it to a T, but this last time. I did one change not meaning to all by accident. Hubby brought home tomato sauce and diced tomatoes that were seasoned with garlic, oregano and basil. And was worried that I'd over power it with the added dried basil in the recipe, but as a result...it didn't. Hubby said it was by far the best batch of Hamburger Soup yet. So I'm shining my apple on my shoulder so to speak and going to keep doing it with the seasoned tomatoes and sauce....yumm-O. Thanks very much!

This soup is excellent. I've been making this for years, with a different recipe that I got years ago. Mine calls for the hamburger, but I also put potatoes, corn, green beans, peas, and cabbage, along with the onion, carrots, and diced tomatoes. I did not use basil, either, as someone else suggested, but use garlic, marjoram, and thyme instead. You can also throw a bay leaf in if you want, and of course a little salt and pepper. It comes out as a very hearty veggie soup with hamburger in it! It's been made in our family for years, and everyone loves it! (:

I made this three times, everytime it seems to get better. I added more veggies such as corn,green beans and peas. The second batch I added a variety of beans for added protein. My family and neighbors loved it. Saved to my box!

Delicious and hardy. I omitted the diced tomatoes (my son hates tomatoes) and ketchup (didn't see a purpose for this). I also used a beef stock since I try and cut down on sodium whenever possible and I think it just tastes better that way. I never would have thought to put ground beef (my least favourite meat) in a soup, but I was pleasantly surprised. Thanks for sharing.

I made 2 pots of this at once, and made a couple of changes.  I did not have any frozen corn or ketchup, so had to omit those, but added a few potatoes in place of the corn.  I used only 3 boullion cubes and 1 can of beef boullion in place of some of the water.  After adding the tomato sauce, I was afraid the soup would be too tomatoey, so didn't put the sauce in the 2nd pot.  They both turned out equally good.  We enjoyed this immensely and I plan to make it again and again.  I thought the celery added a lot to the taste, and am surprised that so many left it out.  I served this with toasted French bread.  The flavor only improves the next day and the soup thickens a bit more.   Yummy, yummy, yummy !

Excellent tasting!  I did add more veggies, parsnips, turnips, and some cabbage.  I usually just add a bag of frozen veggies also.  Then I add some chopped potato the last 45 minutes, just like a little potato in my soup.  I also add a little chopped garlic.  Very good.

This is comfort food!!!  I cooked mine in the crock pot on low for 6 hours.  The smells were wonderful. I was concerned about 1 C. of celery but it tuned out well.

I don't know how I can make my lean ground beef not dry when I cook this. Why is it dry anyway? It's surrounding by broth?

I had leftover pot roast that needed to be used so I made this recipe subbing my pot roast for the ground beef.  Worked out great!  I used beef broth rather than the bouillon and water, and I used diced tomatoes that were flavored with basil, oregano and onion. Instead of frozen corn, I used a full 15 oz. can of corn, drained.  I simmered this for about 30 minutes and then added my shredded pot roast and corn.  I didn’t think it needed to simmer another hour as my veggies were already tender.  This is very good and I would make it again.  I meant to add a bay leaf while simmering, but forgot.  I'll do that next time.

I absolutely LOVED this soup! The name does not do it justice. It should be named, something with a ridiculous French/Spanish/Italian accent! The first time I followed the recipe, of course, I followed it to the T and I! Then...the second time, I added more water (as I wanted to make a larger batch), used half beef and half vegetable broth (as I was out of beef broth!), and tossed in a cup of frozen broccoli florets and it was still incredible! 

I enjoyed this hamburger/vegetable soup so much that I feel confident to make it and take some over for my friends!!!

Very good!  I made the following changes so it is more like the soup my mom made when I was growing up: added 1 tbsp oregano, a bay leaf, and 1/4 tsp pepper.  Added chopped potatoes and green beans.  My husband loved it!

MMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!  Like so many others, I changed it in order to use what I had on hand.  I started by browning a lb. of ground beef, drained that, then added 2 cubed potatoes (peeled russetts), one onion (yellow) and a couple of carrots that I peeled and thinly sliced.  Threw those veggies in there and cooked them till they were beginning to become soft.  Then I added the kernels from 4 cobs of corn (fresh).  I added water until it about covered all the veggies and meat and then added about 3 TB ketchup and 2 tsp basil along with half a small container (6 oz.?) tomato paste, 1 TB kosher salt, 1 and 1/2 tsp. celery seed and probably like 8 beef bouillon cubes.  As this was coming to a boil, I added about 4 cloves of garlic thinly sliced and probably like 12 fresh roma tomatoes diced (not peeled or seeded).  I let it cook till the flavors married and now I am going to go eat my second bowl.

I used this as a base recipe and rate it a 5 because I do not believe in poorly rating a recipe you change.  I used 2 cans beef broth and 1 vegetable broth instead of water. I used a bag of frozen soup veggies and a bag of frozen okra, one can of diced tomatoes, 4 carrots, 5 potatoes and 1 onion.  Instead of buillion I used a packet of brown gravy mix. I did not use basil, but a tiny, tiny amount of thyme with a healthy dose of garlic.  Next time I will add extra corn and peas.

I was craving home made soup, and had the ingredients so decided to give this a try. It turned out great, but I think it would have been a bit bland without the help of others' suggestions. I combined many of them, which were key to success! Here's my combo of tweaks- Substitutions: Stewed tomatoes instead of chopped, Italian seasoning instead of basil. Additions: 1 clove crushed garlic, 1 tsp. Worcestershire, 1 bay leaf.

whole family loved it. I used Beef broth due to no chicken broth in the house and it was awesome.. I did add in 3/4 cup elbow macaroni and 1 drained can of kidney beans for more protein..

A wonderful soup that reminds me of one my Nana used to cook for me as a kid. I doubled the recipe, and added 8 cloves minced garlic, a 2 inch piece of minced ginger, 3 finely chopped jalapenos, a bunch of cilantro stalks minced, 1 cup of barley, 4 bay leaves, and a few extra herbs. Also I used beef broth instead of water and fried the onion, garlic, celery, cilantro stalks, and jalapeno first. Then I used the slow cooker, on high until it boiled, then turned to low. Near the end I thought it looked watery so I thickened it with cornstarch and some of the liquid from the soup. Rave reviews from everyone that came to feast! Will make this again and again. Also, it was really inexpensive for the result!

I browned the ground beef with onion and minced garlic.  Drained any grease.  Added water, carrots, celery, a handful of cubed butternut squash, 4tsp. powdered beef bouillon, tomato sauce, 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes w/basil, garlic & oregano, frozen corn and ketchup.  Add extra basil to your own taste.  Did not add any salt.  Topped with shredded mozzarella cheese.  Covered and simmered until the veggies were tender.  This recipe can be adjusted for whatever ingredients you have on hand.

I was craving a good hamburger soup and made this with a couple adjustments. I used tomato soup instead of sauce, a can of chunky tomatos with basil, garlic and oregano, one diced potato, tsp of worcestorshire and garlic powder, thyme,black pepper and no corn. Cook macoroni in separate pot and added in our own bowls so i could freeze any leftovers since pasta doesnt freeze very well. It was sooo good!!

This is such an easy throw together soup with whatever you have in the pantry! I made mine Fiesta-style. I used a 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes and green chilies (liquid and all), a 6 oz. can tomatoe paste, 1/2 a green pepper and 1/2 a yellow pepper in exchange of the celery. (I still used the corn and carrots for which the recipe called.) Once the majority of the fat cooked off the meat, I browned up the onions with it for more flavor.  If you really like spice you could throw taco seasoning in as well. I simmered it all with the top on and it had enough liquid even though I used less tomatoes.

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  This is like chili without the taste.  Really really bland.  Which might be OK for kids, except that even my kids didn't like it.  I won't make this again.

The broth, with veggie/corn combination, was tasty. Used 5 cups beef broth rather than water & beef bouillon, and we think that is a difference maker. Our disappointment was the ground beef had little chewiness after being browned and simmered for 1-1/2 hours. Doing this again, we would go with a cubed cut of beef sirloin or round to get a more meaty texture or less simmering time for the hamburger. We see more potential for this soup but think it needs work.

Best soup ever for my opinion. I give it a 5. My kids -probably since this was healthy- would say 2 or 3. but I had 2 big bowls and that is not my usual. I did add 2 teaspoons garlic powder for flavor per reviews I read. So good.

Very good. Added a can of corn and peas. Also, increased tomato sauce to 14 oz can and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Added garlic and 1 TB total of basil + italian seasoning. Omitted the celery. Served over brown rice.

Soup was really easy and flavorful.  I sent my husband to the store for ingredients and he bought regular boulion instead of the lower sodium that I would have purchased, making the soup a little salty for my taste even though I didn't add any salt.  Otherwise, loved it!

This is pretty darn good! I added in two russet potatoes after reading the recipe. Will definitely make this again (with potatoes)!  I didn't have plain diced tomatoes on hand, so used diced tomatoes with green chiles... was a little worried about the profile, but the chiles gave it a nice subtle kick. Also added some frozen peas.   Thanks for sharing the recipe AKHowell!

This soup is an amazing.  The whole family loves it and can’t get enough of it.  If I don’t have a lot of time I will use a bag of frozen mixed vegetables (24 - 32oz.) instead of fresh vegetables (although I prefer the fresh).  I also add a little salt/pepper to the meat with a pinch of garlic powder.  It is so easy to make and the smell is remarkable.

Oh my goodness..this soup is so good!  I used beef broth instead of bouillon, and didn't add the ketchup either. I added some broccoli, potato, and parsley..I think it would be good if you added just about any kind of veggie that you wanted. And super easy to make!

The only things that I did different was to add lima beans since I did not have any corn and I always use crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  I gave it five stars since it was mainly so inexpensive to make. It tasted wonderful and had a nice rich broth.  The best thing is how versatile it is. I can't wait to try other vegetables and meats.  Two grown men consumed almost the whole batch.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly with a few minor adjustments: added some minced garlic, some dried parsley, and substituted stewed tomatoes for diced (didn't have them).  This recipe is a keeper!

Not that impressed. I added potatoes and more basil for more flavor. Next time I'll use half the beef boullion cause it was overpowering. I added garlic when I was cooking the meat for more flavor, the sauce just wasn't that good. Next time if I make this again I'll add seasoning salt, a tsp of oregano and maybe 1/4 cup brown sugar.

Wonderful recipe that is easily modified by your personal tastes and what you have on hand. Used broth instead of bouillon and tomato juice instead of sauce. I added black pepper, peas, green beans, a cubed large potato and some dried green/red bell pepper flakes. Served with fresh bread, it is a complete meal.

this is exactly the consistency of broth i was looking for. i cut some leftover meatballs in half instead of the plain ground beef. to make a more flavorful broth i used 2 tsp ital seasoning instead of the basil, 3 cloves minced garlic, 1/4 tsp pepper, a bay leaf, and a few dashes of worcestershire. i like pasta in my hamburger soup so towards the end i added some orzo. i served these with some homemade parmesan biscuits. i would make this again exactly the same way but next i time i will use macaroni instead of orzo.

This was excellent as is.  There was a slight sweetness to it (probably from the corn and carrots) that we really liked.  Will keep as a regular recipe.  Thanks for sharing

First of all this recipe is very versatile!  Canned or frozen veggies work well and it is a great way to use leftover veggies.  Some changes I made included increasing the ground beef to 2 pounds, one additional cup of water, one small can of V8 juice, shitake mushrooms, one cup of yukon gold potatoes, and 1 cup of sweet potatoes.  Also a great soup to freeze to pull out later on a cold day.

My kids LOVE this recipe! It is so easy and versatile. I used frozen beans, corn, carrots, potatoes and sometimes celery. Using beef broth, with a can of tomato sauce, is perfect, which makes it very rich and flavorful. I make a whole pot of it and we usually have leftovers for a few days or more.

This was great! I added three teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, elbow macaroni, and instead of using the beef cubes and water I used three cans beef broth - I should have bough five because as it boiled down the veggies ate up the liquid so mine came out more like a stew and was thick and hearty - my family still liked it and said that they were sure it would be good either way. My grandmother suggested serving it with Italian bread. Will make this again and will be sure to add more broth so that it actually turns out like a soup. Still good either way though! And it makes your house smell wonderful!

This soup was pretty tasty.  I added a can of Kidney Bean's, and kicked up the heat with some red pepper chili flakes.  I also cooked up about a 1/2 cup dried elbow noodles, and added those to the soup when the soup completed cooking.  My husband added a bit of chedder to the top of his soup, and we served it with corn bread.

This was really good (I used diced tomato with onion and green peppers).  My hubby's not much of a soup eater as a meal, but he liked this...he thinks I should add more meat the next time. :-)  Thanks for a great recipe.

This soup was very hearty & tasty!  Had the family over for the game & everyone raved.  Only thing I did different from the recipe is skipped the bouillon cubes and did 1/2 water 1/2 low sodium beef broth.  Thanks for the recipe!

We did not add the salt per several reviews, I used a dab of leftover spaghetti sauce in lieu of the tomato sauce per another review.  We doubled the carrots.  We added 1/3 c. barley and 1/3 c. brown rice.  (I added pepper per another review and suteed the meat with the onions and some garlic per another review.  It was really great!!!!!

We thought it was good, but I made a couple changes based on other reviews. I used 2/3 beef broth to 1/3 chicken broth, used an entire 15 oz tomato sauce and skipped the ketchup, reduced the salt in half, used only 1 cup frozen corn and 1/2 cup long grain rice, added about 2 or 3 cloves of garlic and 1t pepper, and added both a can of green beans and one of red beans to give some fiber, I also through in some shredded cabbage so it cooked up well, then left the rest of the recipe alone.  With my extra canned beans, i wish I would have used even less salt, but it was easy and adaptable..  I have made this again  using tomato paste and worcestershire instead of ketchup and that was a win.

This soup was awesome.  Instead of ground beef, I used ground venison.  I waited to add the corn until 1/2 hour before serving and added about 1/2 box of curly pasta along with it.  Very good, I'll definitely make this again.

I am a vegetarian but I made this for a friend of mine that was sick and a few friends and everyone loved ii! I sauteed the onion and a couple of cloves of garlic before adding the beef to it and then added a splash of lemon juice to the mixture. I also used low sodium low fat beef broth and added green beans, about two potatoes and a cup of pasta. I will definitely be making it for friends again! Thanks!

Excellent! The only changes I made were frozen peas for the corn and since I didn't have tomato sauce I used pizza sauce. At the end I added star-shaped pasta. You just can't go wrong with this recipe!

I took the advice of some previous reviewers and added some garlic to the meat while cooking, 28 oz. can of tomatoes, substituted mushrooms for the corn and threw in a handful of barley. I cooked mine in the crockpot all day, even my 8 year old liked it!

This is a sure winner!  I took it to work in my crockpot to share with everyone -- they all raved about the delicious taste.  The only change I made was adding two cans of italian style diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  Next time I might add a couple of handfuls of macaroni for a change.  This one is a keeper for sure.  Thanks Amanda for sharing it with us all.

Great recipe. I left out the celery and added peas and green beans instead and it turned out great.  Another addition is to add garlic to the meat while it browns.  This adds a good taste to it.

I had to alter this recipe a bit to make it lower in carbs for my hubby, but it was fantastic.  I omitted the carrots and corn and used zucchini, a can of mushrooms, and green bell pepper instead.  I also added minced garlic, salt, and pepper to the meat while it was cooking.  I used two cans of tomato sauce and no ketchup.  I think the ultimate result could use some more zest, so I will try adding a chopped, fresh jalapeno to the pot next time.  Either way, this is wonderful.

This soup was very tasty.  I did make a few changes though.  I omitted the celery and added a package of frozen peas instead.  The diced tomatoes and tomato sauce I used were preflavored with basil and onion.  I also added 2 teaspoons of Paul Prudhomme's Meat Seasoning.  I let it simer for 2 and a half hours so it was nice and thick when I served it.  My husband loved this soup.  I will be making this on a regular basis this winter!

My 2 children love this soup. When the weather starts to cool down my 7-year old "begs" me to make it. And now that is old enough she helps me measure all the ingrediants for the soup. My whole family loves it for gatherings. I made a huge hit with it Thanks!!

I made this tonight for dinner as a last minute kind of a thing and wasn't disappointed with how it turned out. I did make a few changes though: sauteed a tsp of minced garlic with the onions and celery in a tsp of olive oil then added the rest of the ingredients. I also added a tsp of thyme and 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper along with the basil. I didn't have tomato sauce so I left that out and added more water. I also threw in a can of dark kidney beans and used a can of corn (both undrained) and used probably twice as much ketchup to add a little more tomato taste. During the last 20 min of cooking I added 3/4 cup of macaroni and served each the soup in bowls topped with shredded parmesan. It had a little bit of everything, but I like soup like that and it still went over well with my kids. I didn't have time for homemade bread so instead made homemade pumpkin apple muffins from this site and there were no complaints!

This is a really good soup.  Hearty flavor and filling.  I sometimes add peas or bean in addition to or instead of the corn.  Worth the cooking time!

Took others' advice and used seasoned diced tomatoes--green pepper with onion.  Used a frozen onion/celery/red & green pepper/parsley mix and a frozen corn/green bean/carrot mix. Easy! Used low sodium beef broth (omitted the water, of course).  Seasoned with a pepper blend I love from Penzey's called Forward.  Forgot to add the ketchup, using only tomato sauce, but it had a wonderful flavor.  It was a hit at a potluck.  Thanks!

This was excellent. This is a fantastic base recipe to play around with. After reading some of the reviews, I added 2 garlic cloves (minced) when cooking the ground beef and onion. I also added a can of kidney beans, and upped the tomato sauce and tomatoes. I also added some Italian seasoning and a bay leaf. I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies instead of just corn, and I added 2 diced potatoes and some diced zucchini from my garden. I added ciabatta bread cubes ( toasted with some olive oil) to the bowl and ladled the soup over it. The soup bowls were licked clean and everyone went back for seconds. Will absolutely make this again. Simple and delicious.

I used too much  marjoram at first (flowery). So I added some A-1 sauce and the vinegar softened it. Add any and ALL the vegetables you want to the soup. Can't go wrong! But add no salt. Americans don't need it.

I didn’t have any carrots. I added oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, great northern beans, green beans, and more water. Next time I will carmelize the onions so the beef will be more flavorful.

Thank  you for the recipe.  My husband and I enjoyed it and we will for sure make this  again. I needed to make some changes , only because I did not have on hand all items needed. I substituted one box of beef stock for the bullion cubes/water part of the recipe, and used 32 oz cans of tomato sauce and diced tomato's.  I added 1tsp garlic powder. I cooked this in my crock pot for 6 hours.

This was the perfect recipe to clean out the fridge and freezer. I used frozen mixed vegetables, a can of sweet corn and some small potatoes that I quartered. I also had some Andouille sausage that I added which gave it a little bit of heat, but not too much. I used petite diced tomatoes because I'm not a fan of big tomato chunks. I also put in some Jasmine rice. I thought it needed a little more flavor so I added some rosemary, thyme, garlic powder and dried celery leaves. I followed the recipe with these additions and it is delicious. I was working on my truck in the snow and cold today and this was a welcomed warm-up.

The only thing I did different is cut the cook time down to thirty minutes. Used a can of Veg-All thick cut. Sautéed the onions and celery too. Very good.

This is an outstanding basic soup - served just as is if you'd like, or add/subtract to customize to your liking. For me, the addition of garlic, hot sauce, and ditalini pasta completed our taste. I will make this often as a low calorie meal that is filled with flavor!

This is my favorite basic soup recipe.  I add 2 TBS garlic, 1 TBS oregano, 1 can tomato soup, and use beef bone broth mix instead of boullion cubes.  Amazing soup!

Soup was FANTASTIC! I added a little bit of garlic and a little more tomato sauce and diced tomatoes as our can sizes are a bit different in Canada. Hubby loved it and told me to make sure I save this recipe.

Hamburger soup is a comfort food for me.  My mom made it when I was growing up.  This is the closest to hers that I've tried.  My kids loved it as well and Hamburger Soup has been a hard sell.  I'll definately  make this again.

Easy to make, delicious and love that it was full of veggies. I browned the beef with two spoonfuls of minced garlic. Also, I seasoned the soup with garlic salt in addition to the salt and pepper. I will put in pasta next time I make this.

This is a great basis for soup. I made it the first time following the instructions exactly. I found it a good base but not really my taste, the subsequent times I deleted the basil, added 1 bay leaf, some marjoram and a bit of oregano and now it is a full bodied soup.

I made this soup last night and it was absolutely DELISH! I added potatoes, omitted celery, and used ground turkey although beef would've given it a better texture. Even my picky 14 yr old ate an entire bowl. I had 3! But hey this soup is full of veggies and I don't feel guilty at all!

I added garlic, cabbage, green beans, kidney beans, garbanzo beans and potatoes. I also use seasoned stewed tomatoes. Delicious! 
This is my second time making this soup and my family of 6 loves it. Also, if you double your recipe the extra freezes well. I divide it up in Tupperware, shove in the freezer and bam, individual lunches for my husband at work.

I read tons of reviews and made these adjustments and it was excellent. I chose this recipe because it did not have potatoes in it. 

* I used two cans of tomato sauce and about two cups of chopped fresh garden tomatoes
* a box of Kitchen basic beef stock, a big spoon of better than beef broth, 2 cups of water
* 1 t of oregano along with the basil, added to the beef before rest of the ingredients and a shake of worcestershire sauce 
* two cups of fresh green beans, cut in half or thirds depending on length of bean 
* two large cloves of garlic crushed 
* two T of fresh chopped parsley 
*no ketchup-Who wants sweet soup?

The cooking time 1 1/2 hours is spot on

Made as written the first time I made it and I liked it then, but the next time I only had tomatoes with oregano and basil already added and so used that, and it did add some flavor that was missing in the original version.  I also added some green beans to make it a more rounded meal.  Also used ground turkey because that's what I had and it worked just fine.   I am on a sodium restricted diet, so used sodium free broth, veggies, and tomatoes and still pretty flavorful.  Did add a tad of low sodium salt though.  I also sprinkle some grated parmesan over it and that adds a nice flavor too.  This is a good go to soup, you can add whatever veggies you want.  A very good base soup recipe.

This soup is delicious.   I did add garlic and oregano as some suggested. I did not add salt  until it was done so I could adjust to my own taste. I made this on New Years day so added 1 cup of  black eyed peas to keep with tradition.

This is very good when you let it simmer all day. I used cabbage instead of celery and added potatoes. I did not have basil, so substituted marjoram and it turned out great. I also added garlic powder. I tasted it after about an hour of simmering and it still had an overwhelming taste of canned tomatoes, I was a bit worried. This isn't a soup I would make in a hurry. It's fantastic after the flavours have time to come together. I will make again, a good slow cooker meal!

I did what most recommended and added two cans of diced tomatoes, bay leaf, minced garlic, green beans, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. I didnt have any frozen vegetables so I only cooked my soup for 45 minutes. The best soup I have had in a very long time!

The only change I made was to use 2 teaspoons of Ketchup and 1 teaspoon of Sriracha. It had a wonderful flavor, but was too salty. I used an Iodized sea salt and I think it is saltier than regular salt so next time I will omit the salt as it can be added to taste afterwards anyway.

This was yummy, but I tweaked the recipe a little. First off, I made 7 cups of beef broth. I used Italian Stewed tomatoes instead of regular. Then I added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. I also added 1 tsp of ground black pepper and 1 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning. Then I added a can of drained red beans. I allowed it to cook, then at the end, I added a package of bow tie pasta and allowed it to cook until tender. Yummy!

Followed directions, but used low sodium beef broth rather than cubes, so I needed to add a little extra salt, to compensate for bouillon cubes.  About an hour into cooking, it was a little bland, so I added garlic powder and cheyenne. Also added a tbsp of tomato bouillon.

This is wonderful! I made it as the recipe called, but added 1 potato and a tablespoon of soy sauce which enhances tomato flavor. This is a fantastic soup, I will make this again and again. I did not add basil, I don't like it. Did I miss it? No.

I enjoy playing around with this simple, yet satisfying, recipe. I like to sweat my onions and I also add about a tablespoon of minced garlic to the end of the sweat. Instead of bouillon cubes, I use a quart of unsalted beef stock and add an additional can of tomato sauce. I like to add more veggies than it calls for; I've also added a small handful of barley as well. Everyone is happy when I make this soup!

Very easy and delicious soup, some changes I made:
Added bay leaves, green beans celery salt.

Next time: low sodium everything, this soup recipe as written is a bit salty

With the rising cost of beef this is just what I was looking for... A cheaper way to make vegetable beef soup. The only change I made was to use mixed veggie instead of just corn and I didn't add the ketchup. Thanks for sharing.

Simple & yummy!  I had made a beef soup previously that my husband loves but can't find the recipe so looked for a similar one to try.  This one was pretty close.  I did make some changes, added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, a bay leaf, macaroni noodles & extra water & boullion (organic "Better than Boullion").  We are trying to eat mostly organic and/or non-gmo, this recipe was pretty easy to sub organic ingredients.

I liked that it only took a few minutes to prepare, and cooks up in a reasonably short amount of time. The whole family really enjoyed it, picky eaters and all....very flavorful and almost borders on being a "comfort food" but can't quite put my finger on why! Rather than beef broth, I used some homemade chicken broth from the freezer that I had on hand. Because it was lacking salt, I added a tablespoon or so of  "Better than Bullion" - Beef. Fantastic!

Brought back memories of when Mom used to make hamburger soup.  I tweaked it a bit and added a tomato-basil bisque soup, and a can of creamed corn because I didn't have frozen corn.  I didn't add as much water to make a thicker soup.  I added no ketchup and no salt. YUM!

It was good.  Makes a lot.  I won't add the salt next time - there was plenty of salt in the broth already.  Also, I added some left over cabbage but otherwise followed the recipe.

This is pretty good! I needed a soup for a church potluck and wanted to use some of the ground meat in my freezer. I followed the recipe almost exactly. My changes: as another reviewer did, I substituted the basil for marjoram, though I'm sure the basil would be just as delicious. I also used ground elk instead of the beef (I often substitute venison of some variety for beef in recipes; my family and I love it) and Organic Low Sodium Better Than Bouillon Beef Base for the beef bouillon cubes. My children were asking what smelled so good while it simmered. Yum!

I added a teaspoon of Penzy's dried garlic and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice which I think really changed the soup into a masterpiece. It added a subtle clean flavor that I think was unexpected but somehow lightened and complimented the other flavors. Three thumbs up from teenage boys and hungry husband.

This was close to the soup my mom would make as we grew up.  I'm in my 50's now.  The only thing different is that she would brown the hamburger with the onions in a skillet and start the veggies that needed cooking in the water/beef bouillion in the stock pot.  When the meat/onions were cooked, she would drain the meat and add it to the stock pot.  Then season the pot of soup.  She also would look into the fridge for any "left over" veggies that could go into the pot.  I could honestly eat this everyday with a few crackers.  Hearty and delicious and inexpensive.

My mother made this soup, we simply called it "vegetable soup". We started chopped onions, diced potatoes, mixed vegetables in bag or can and then added whatever vegetables we liked, green beans, lima beans, a little frozen spinach crumbled in is nice as well. The ketchup adds a little sweetness to the pot but canned tomatoes work just as well. I instead use a can of crushed tomato with puree and a little bit of sugar to bring out the tomato flavor. My mother would hand squeeze whole tomatoes into the pot but I never liked the hulls or big bits of tomato. Butter bread is a must to go with it.

Thanks for posting this, we love it! I made a few changes to it though, just out of personal preference- I omitted the can of tomoatoes, added some fresh mushrooms, & only added 4 cubes of bouillon rather than all 6. 
Also tried something another reviewer had mentioned- I just added about a half teaspoon of majoram instead of the basil- good suggestion! I love how you can really customize this recipe to make it however you like- I will definitely be making this again & again.

I used frozen peas and carrots as well as corn. This is a very good soup but needed some additional flavor. I added one tablespoon of worchestshire (at my husband's request) and two teaspoons of cayenne. My youngest raved about how good it was so I'm really glad that I tried it.

I made this recipe almost exactly the way is it written. The only thing I need different was doubled the basil and added some oregano. The whole family loved it. Will be making it again but with a bit more vegetables. I also wasn't sure about adding the ketchup but was very nice.

This is simple and easy.  Made it 2x now.  Each time with different things.  Made a few changes (lack of certain ingredients).  Have to add garlic (2 cloves) no matter what.  Have tried it with italian seasoning instead of basil, and flavored tomatoes and plain ones.  Each way is great.  Also, I add a cup each of beans, corn, peas (all frozen).  no canned veg.  Cringed about the ketchup but it really makes all the flavours pop!

I really liked this soup! Based on the reviews, I decided to make it a bit heartier and flavorful by adding a can of kidney beans,  more vegetables and a couple of bay leaves. It still needed a bit more kick so I added some hot sauce.  Next time I make it, I'll add a can of green chiles. This is definitely a go-to soup during the winter months.

This was a thumbs up from my teenage son. So, that makes it a quick winner right there. I followed the recipe exactly until I realized I had a 16 oz can of tomato sauce not an 8 oz. I also was out of basil so I used Italian seasoning instead. I agree that it was a little band so I added garlic salt. It was really food. We ate half and then froze the other half!

ok, so I didnt have everything on hand to make this, but what I was able to put in it was great.  So, regardless, I'm rating this as 5 stars - it was good, and easy to adapt if you need to.  I didnt have tomato sauce, so I just used more ketchup.  I also used all frozen vegetables.  I left out the basil just for preference and added garlic and onion powder.  I also added elbow macaroni.  So easy and so quick to throw together while the baby napped.  Will certainly make this again.  Tastes like homemade but no one would guess it took less than five minutes to put together then just let simmer til you want to eat it.

A great base. I did tweek it a bit because it seemed bland. I had some V8 juice in the fridge and added that instead of the tomato sauce and also threw in some pasta. The possibilities are endless! I will make this again

This is so easy to make.  My husband & I loved it.  I had some extra ground beef at home.  I found this recipe and made it. This was perfect.  I used green beans instead of carrots.  I used low-fat beef broth instead of bouillons and water. I will make this again!

This recipe is something that you can play on and learn for making some soups. I changed a few things I don't like big chunks like in the picture of my veggies and i make them smaller. I used beef broth and bullion cubes and I didn't put corn in it . I put fresh parsley and basil in it. Along with a cream of potato soup. Added little more hamburger to it and it was DELICIOUS!

I love this soup!  It is easy and really nice to be able to use bouillon cubes.  If any are like me, I have huge cases of bouillon cubes from Sam's Club and this is a good recipe to be able to use those instead of them going bad in my pantry.

Its good. I only put half the beef bouillon & then I added Lipton onion soup mix & a can of kidney beans. I should have left out the salt. I think the bouillon & soup mix had enough. Next time no salt. I also wasnt going to be home to make dinner so, in the morning I browned the beef & then put it all in the crock pot. Try it.

I just made this tonight.  I wanted something quick & easy to throw together for a chilly Halloween night.  I didn't have beef bouillon so I replaced the water with beef broth and no corn because my friend can't have it.  Other than that, it was the same.  And I LOVED it!  I never would eat it in the past, but thought why not and tried it & I am glad I did!  there were 3 of us & there is enough left for 1 good-sized bowl!  Will be making this again!

This is an absolute favorite at our house but I make it differently. I use no water, tomato sauce, or ketchup. I use low sodium tomato juice. I also add basil. Instead of fresh, cut-up vegetables, a package of frozen vegetables for soup can be added. I've done it both ways. This is a very inexpensive, healthy, and easy meal.

Just great! - Didn't have tomato juice, so put in a can of V8, the juice of the diced tomatoes. Pealed two small red potatoes & diced them up in it, and only had room for a cup & a half of water. I also added a heavy teaspoon of black pepper, but I like it pretty spicy. Have already been asked to make it again.

I was really disappointed in this! With such a high rating I was expecting a delicious soup! I followed the recipe to a 't', but after one hour of cooking it was extremely salty, and just ... not good. I got my husband to taste it, and he sort of cringed. [oh- actually I did cook the gr.beef with minced garlic... so I DID deviate slightly in the beginning!]  To salvage it I added over 2 cups of water, some ground pepper, a tsp of cayenne pepper, over a tsp of oregano, and about 1/4 cup of ketchup [I chose this over sugar because it was at my fingertips]. End result was good, though I likely won't be making this again. I can imagine that added barley would be a great addition to this [though you'll likely want to add a bit more water].  My thoughts on the problem is that perhaps different companys bouillon is different strengths? I used Knorr, and on the side of the box it said to dissolve each cube in 2 cups of water... I went against my intuition and used the 6 cubes recommended in the recipe. The end result might have been better had I lessened the number of cubes used. My first time using beef bouillon, so lesson learned!

This recipe is very, very delicious!! I'm a southerner, who loves things spicy, so I changed things up a bit. I used 1 can of beef broth instead of boullion cubes, added 1 can of rotel(chunky style), left out the potatoes, used canned veggies, excluded the basil to use own blend of spices, and used noodles instead of rice. I also didn't use lean ground beef and left the fatty grease in the mixture. Made it that much better. I will definitely use this recipe over and over!

great!  few changes...1) I added cubed potatoes, left out the corn, and put less stewed tomatoes.  2) i also left out the basil but used dried oregano and parsley flakes instead.  3) I threw everything in the pot, used double the water and beef bouillon, sliced garlic, and added a cup of barley.   Brought it to a boil, and then let simmer.  I fed this to my sick husband and he really enjoyed it.  We ate it all day long.  Added some shredded pepperjack on top and saltines on the side!

I love this recipe, although I added my own touches.  I added garlic and dried onion when I browned the beef.  Then since I used 2 small cans of petite diced tomatoes.  Didn't have any tomato sauce, so I added beef mushroom soup.  I followed the recipe otherwise.  Will definitely make this again!   Next time might take advice of others and also add some kidney beans before serving.

My husband made this a while back when I was on nights... he liked it but I kinda felt like I was eating watered down tomato sauce with veggies mixed in. If you look closely at the recipes... that's exactly what it is!

Everyone in my family loves this recipe.  My son calls it the shiny soup (don't know where this comes from).  I add a clove or two of garlic, pepper to taste, a dash or two of hot chili sauce to taste, pasta shells (towards the end of cooking) and worcester sauce.  I have also been known to add a chopped sweet potato or yam.

This soup was SO delicious and easy to make. I used leftover spagetti sauce instead of the diced tomatoes and can of sauce. I also added garlic and green beans and used 2 cans of beef stock instead of the cubes. Did not need salt or ketchup.

Mmmmm Mmmmm Good!
I had two pounds of ground beef thawed so my soup came out pretty thick. I added a few cloves of garlic, italian seasoning, frozen green beans, and some Ragu sauce from a jar I had open in the fridge.
It came out great, a good, healthy recipe you that can play around with.
Thanks!!

Delicious, but too salty.  I suggest cutting down on the amount of boullion and salt you add.  I didn't have corn, but added half a cup of wild rice.  I threw it all in the slowcooker and it turned out great!

This soup, if made with bouillon cubes and a tsp of salt as directed, contains over 7,000 mg of sodium (per pot, not serving!). I'm not on a special diet, but that seemed way too high. Therefore, I substituted low-sodium beef broth, then added back a little salt to taste. I also left out the ketchup (too sweet) and added a clove of pressed garlic and cracked black pepper. It was excellent! We served it with toasted garlic bread and green salad.

The basic flavor of this was really good.  It didn't have enough vegetables for our taste, so I added a head of cauliflower, a bell pepper, and doubled the celery and onion.  It also needed black pepper.  With those additions, it was a very tasty soup that I will probably make again.

I really liked this soup.  It's quick, easy, and you can adjust it to your own tastes.  It heats up well for lunches the next day.  I know I'll make this again for sure!

Soup is delicious.  I substituted ground turkey and served with shredded cheddar cheese.  Disappeared in one day.

This was very good, I did add the egg noodles like other reviewers had said and also added minced garlic and the italian seasoning instead of basil because I didn't have any, but it was still really good and the kids loved it to!  Also instead of bread I made corn bread muffins and that was good with it as well!!

Great recipe - even my picky friends loved it! I did follow other reviewers' advice and added macaroni (along with an extra 2 cups of water - we like it soupy) and italian seasoning in lieu of the dried basil. When I make this for myself and have no picky eaters around, I plan to add mushrooms, stewed tomatoes and kidney beans to add some more flavor. Still a terrific recipe as is, though! Thank you!

Delicious basic recipe. I used Rotel tomatoes and added beef bouillon. I like to add cooked elbow macaroni and omit the potatoes. My go to clean out the fridge dinner! Use up all the leftover veggies.

I have made this soup. for church functions and for my family, and it is loved by everyone. 
I'm not a big fan of peas. So I leave them out and I've added potatoes to it. It is a great basic recipe where you can add and subtract what vegetables you want. 
Love this recipe and have passed the recipe around.

Easy and yummy! I added a few cubed potatoes, minced garlic and doubled the tomato sauce as one reviewer suggested. Perfection and it’s about the only soup my kiddo will eat. She loves it! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this soup exactly as the recipe states except I used 1.5 lbs of ground beef instead of just 1 lb (I needed to use it up and didn't want to throw away .5 lb of meat). My whole family enjoyed it!  It was delicious, very hearty, and perfect for a chilly fall day!  Will make again!

I used my Instsnt Pot for this soup.  Browned the ground beef, drained off the fat.  Sauté d the vegetables for a few minutes.  Added everything else to the pot.  Pressure cooked for 5 minutes, natural release for 5.   It turned out great.

I'm feeding a family of 7 and need at least one serving for next day lunch, so I doubled the recipe.  It was a HUGE hit!! I left out the celery because my husband doesn't like it. I also added a leftover partial bag of frozen peas! So, this recipe can be used to clean out your freezer. I think I'll add baby butter beans next time too! Maybe even some diced potatoes. I didn't add potatoes to keep down on the carb intake especially when served with warm crusty Italian bread! Yum!!

Very good on a cold night. I didn’t have an onion or beef bullion so I substituted a shallot and beef broth and skipped the water. I also added peas and it turned out great. Potatoes would also be good.

I added 1 cup cubed zucchini and yellow squash instead of using frozen corn. I also didn’t add the ketchup And used a 16 ounce can of Italian canned tomatoes. The soup turned out delicious and it was even better the next day.

I was looking for a recipe to use some ground beef I had.  I found this recipe and it sounded like something that would be good.  I was right.  I did make some changes because I didn't exactly have everything called for so I had to improvise.  I used beef broth instead of water and bouillon .  I used homemade Italian stewed tomatoes.  I added a couple bay leaves and a can of cannellini beans and a small can of mushrooms.  I also added 1/4 of a cabbage because my husband likes it.  I seasoned it with garlic powder and cajun seasoning.  It turned out really good.  My husband really liked it and asked if I would make it again someday.    I definitely will.  Thank you for this really good recipe.

I adapted the recipe a little.  Used 4 cups beef broth instead of bouillon and 2 cups of water.  19 oz of diced tomato, 398 ml tomato sauce and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of quartered baby potatoes & 1tsp pepper.  Delish!

I made no changes to this dish. I never do the first time I make a dish, It should be made the way the author intended. It was very good I am looking for one that mirrors my Late Mom's dish but still looking. Will I make it again sure. The family liked it very much. Cheers.

Would be considered a clean recipe when you use extra lean ground beef.

I made it in my pressure cooker, and it was fast and easyI didn't have Basil so I used garlic and fresh thyme. I used my own beef stock, hence less sodium. The flavour was good and a nice soup on a cold day as lunch for the whole family.

I used frozen veggies from the garden and home canned stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce instead of store bought but it's a good recipe that was quick and easy.  I put it all in the crock pot at lunchtime and it was ready to eat at supper with cornbread.  Added to my recipes so I can make it again.

Great recipe! Following others reviews, I omitted the ketchup and added a splash of Worcestershire sauce. I also served the soup over elbow noodles, which for me, made it even more fantastic.

This was really good.  I don't like to spend a lot of time cooking so I only used frozen vegetables, dried minced onion and garlic powder.  I used tomato soup instead of paste because I didn't have any paste.  It was really good.

I added a few things to this soup: mushrooms, unpeeled red potatoes, green pepper & some leftover California mix from last night's dinner. I also added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper & a generous dash of tabasco!

I love making this type of soup. I did change this recipe a little bit just to add something a little different. I added garlic, pepper, Italian spices, extra carrots celery beef and onion. At the end I put in an already cooked box of long grain wild rice to make it a bit more filling. This was a great recipe and I look forward to making it again. This is a fun recipe that you can easily add different veggies to.

Much like family beef stew I've made over 40 years and yet the hamburger changes it enough to make it a favorite in its own right! We love it! Makes easy in an hour in pressure cooker.

I didn't have the can of tomato sauce (used a 16oz jar of diced tomatoes), used homemade broth instead of water, added a few cloves of crushed garlic, and added in a couple of cups of cooked pasta. I don't know if it made it into something totally different, but we enjoyed it, and I will use this recipe again.

Easy and good soup. I've made it a few times and it's very versatile. Last time, I was out of beef cubes, so I substituted chicken cubes and browning sauce, and it still tasted great. I always add onions, carrots, and celery plus whatever I happen to have in frozen vegetables.

Made this following MUMOFTWINS suggestions as well as beef broth instead of water and bouillon as suggested by someone else. Added 1.5 cups orzo pasta during the last 30 minutes. Much flavor but not spicy, big hit with my husband and my 2 year old. Will definitely make again.

Loved it!!  It has a great flavor.  I tweaked it a little only to accommodate what I had on hand.  Canned corn instead of frozen and 14.5 oz can tomato sauce instead of 8 oz., so used 4.5 cups water to compensate.  not really anything major.  we loved it!

So easy and so delicious! My pantry wasn't as well stocked as I had thought so I was forced to use a mixture of chicken broth and onion soup mix in place of the beef boullion. I also added a couple of handfuls of rice.  It worked out perfectly.  I will make this again.

Awesome recipe. Very easy to make. This was perfect for the cold weather nights. I only added mushrooms and tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. Served with Jiffy cornbread.

Very tasty, hearty soup. Very easy to put together and my whole family loved it. I used beef broth and canned shoe peg corn because that's what I had on hand.  It's great the next day too! I'e made it a few times and will add it as one of my often made meals!

This was a big hit!  I used organic "better than bouillon" beef base instead of the cubes, and matchstix carrots to make it easier.  I made it last week and my husband already wants it again.

I've got my whole family hooked on this soup. So simple yet so good. I omitted the corn, added some garlic and parsley and Worcestershire.

I really thought of chili with this soup so I added black beans, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, chili powder, and minced garlic. I served it with sour cream, shredded cheese and green onions with garlic bread and everyone loved it

Delicious!! I used basil/oregano diced tomatos and a couple of splashes of worchestchire sauce. I didnt quite understand the ketchup so I completely omitted it. Sprinkled each serving with a little bit of cheese and serve with a half a grilled cheese sandwich(mostly to appeal to the kids) 13, 10 and 2 year old loved it! Even better the next day!

I made this soup last night....added some green beans and a bit of cabbage (end of garden produce!!). It was delicious. The flavor was so good. I've already passed it on to our four grown children. Thank you.

I added mushrooms and green peas based on what others suggested in the reviews, and added an extra cup of water and it turned out great!  It tasted great especially after the next day.  Great with fresh bread.

Yummy, easy, and healthy, just the way I like it.  I used the no salt added tomato sauce and tomatoes and it still tasted great!  This soup is a little bit on the sweet side, which makes it a nice surprise for a warm soup.  It's worth the try.  Enjoy!

This tasted bland. Everyone ate one bowl but no one wanted seconds. If I make again I will add more spices.

This soup was excellent. My family loved it. I added a few things (but nothing dramatically different). I added whole mushrooms for my husband, and minced garlic to the beef while browning it.I'll definitally make this one again. Thanx for the recipe.

This was really easy, nutritious, and surprisingly good. I substitued potatoes for the celery (I like potatoes, don't like celery) and added some veggie pasta.

I was looking for a soup recipe that contained ground beef and this was a delightful alternative to chili.  I would omit the ketchup to enjoy the flavor of the vegetables and meat.  I will make this soup again, but I will add 1 c. chopped potatoes to fill out this soup.

I took the advice of several reviewers and substituted celery for other veggies.  I also added garlic powder, garlic salt, Cajun seasoning and a dash of cayenne pepper to jazz it up.  I thought it was tasty and will make it again.

Yum - this was so good, even my picky husband liked it. I added green beans instead of the celery, just a personal preference. It was quick and easy to throw together. Will definitely make this again!

This is a very versatile soup. 
I followed others' suggestions and added 2 cans of kidney beans, 2 garlic cloves-minced, green beans, peas, and 1c. of pasta. Just put in whatever you have and it will turn out great!

This recipe was delicious. I did thicken it up a little by adding barley, although it was great without.

This is a great base for soup. I modified it as well. Instead of tomato sauce I used 2 cans of tomato soup, I scratched the corn and ketchup and put broccoli and green beans instead. I also only used 3 cans of water but used the same amount of beef bullion as the recipe called for. It was DELICIOUS!

I've renamed this "Water Soup". 
Think I'll try the other recipes for
hamburger soup.
