Absolutely delicious.  I added some blue cheese and chopped pecans. Sauteed two cloves of garlic with the mushrooms. This  would work with fresh spinach or mixture of spring greens and spinach.  Chicken slivers or boiled shrimp would be great and make it a meal in itself!  Wow! I could have this one every day!

I've made a similar salad myself many times before, and this one tastes great as well! I added also some fresh basil leaves in my salad.

OK, this was REALLY GOOD! I added some cherry tomatoes for good measure, but love the balsamic in the sauteed 'shrooms! Will definitely make again! Thanks!

CRAZY GOOD. One of the best salads I've had in a long time. The recipe didn't specify which kind of mushrooms to use, I used baby bellas which have a "beefy" taste which was really outstanding with the greens. LOVED this salad.

Wonderful salad! And so simple to prepare. I cannot wait to make this again per the recipe. This time, I added blue cheese, toasted walnuts and bacon bits. It was great tasting but I think I want to try it again with just the mushrooms.

Perhaps I did something wrong. 10 oz of greens was excessive for the amount of dressing, the ratio was way off. I would also consider blancing the greens before adding the dressing to remove the bitterness or adding some sugared pecans.

I like this a lot... It's pretty close to the ones I've had in restaurants.  I used portobello mushrooms and I topped it with some soft feta (or goat cheese) like in the restaurant.

Great dressing!  It seemed like it needed something else along with the greens though, something crunchy.  I may try a few walnuts or chopped water chestnuts.  I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious!!!  I am a huge fan of anything containing mushrooms (I think I ate them with every single meal when I was pregnant with my son!) so of course I found this salad awesome!!!  The only change I made was to saute one large shallot along with the mushrooms, because I always do and they complement each other so well!  If you are a mushroom lover you really need to try this salad!  Great recipe!

Amazing salad! 

I added a teaspoon of splenda to the sauce to sweeten it a little bit, two cloves of garlic and 1/4 of a diced onion (finely diced). It was delicious! I will for sure make this again and again!

This salad was ok but we didn't really care for the dressing... too much vinegar and also the warm mushrooms with lettuce was kind of odd to me.

I love this recipe! I used baby portabellos and added halved grape tomatoes to spinach and romaine lettuce. Such an easy yet elegant salad idea. Thanks for posting!

This was a great salad! I added some red bell pepper and scallions to the mushrooms while in the skillet. Right after tossing the salad I added some cherry tomatoes for extra color and texture. Everyone in my family loved it!

I thought this was good, but I agree w/ the reviewer who said the ratios seemed off-not enough mushrooms, too many greens and maybe even a little too much balsamic for my taste. It was good, though and I think by altering the olive oil to balsamic ratio and doing more mushrooms it would be even better. I will also try adding some toasted pecans as someone else mentioned.

I took this simple salad to Thanksgiving dinner.  I sauted 4 cloves of garlic with crimini mushrooms and served it over baby spinach. Even my salad-indifferent boyfriend ate it! Next time I will grate some fresh parmesan on top to add some texture and a salty flavor.

Tried this last night, absolutely FANTASTIC and UNUSUAL!  I agree with one of the reviewer that the ratio was not quiet up to par, but again it depends how much mushrooms do you want in the salad.  If you are a mushroom lover like me, double the recipe for mushrooms and/or use only 2/3 of the bag of greens.  I added goat cheese to mine & used Bella mushrooms, since they are tastier than white ones.  This recipe is a keeper in recipe box & can't wait to try it again soon.  Thank you Extraordinary Machine for sharing it with us all.

Simple, yet surprisingly good. I left out the optional garlic and seasonings, opting to use sun-dried tomato vinaigrette for the rest of the EVOO called for along with the balsamic. That took it to another level, and complemented my meal nicely. Love it!

I have made this recipe twice, once for just my husband and I. We loved it!  So decided to make a larger salad for a dinner with some friends but this time I add feta cheese to it!  WOW!  They couldn't get enough of it!  Great recipe will make it more often!

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic.  I have reused this recipe so many times!  I have added crabmeat, I've used it with steak, I used it with sliced pork.  I've added grape tomatoes, toasted almonds, fresh mozzarella, you name it.  What a great foundation recipe!

I loved this one - as did MrB. I use baby red lettuce and baby spinach, and lots of black pepper. We had this with cantaloupe which was a nice complement. I think this salad opens itself up to all kinds of great additions, but is also wonderful just as written. Thanks!!

I'm not sure why, (it might have been that my mushrooms were past their prime) but this recipe didn't do anything for me. I really don't like balsamic vinegar, either, so I used red wine vinegar. It wasn't bad, but i would not make it again.

This is an amazing recipe.  I was worried about a "warm" salad, but it cooled down to room temperature quickly, and was delicious.  I added goat cheese and pine nuts which made it much less healthy, but it's hard to resist throwing cheese into things.

This was so good, we had it with steak and it was a perfect pairing.  I LOVE mushrooms and used a lot of them over the salad greens.  If you aren't such a huge fan of the 'shrooms, then I would suggest adding the mushrooms a little at a time over the salad greens until you get the right combination.  You can always save the rest for soup or something later on.

I have a similar recipe which is a lot more work - this tastes great; however, I only used a 5 oz bag of greens and the dressing was barely enough.  I also added bleu cheese and sauteed the mushrooms in garlic.  I will definitely make this again!

I loved this, probably used more mushrooms, just bought a package of pre-sliced cremini's and threw them in. I also added tomatoes. My husband liked it just as a side and I loved it for my salad. Planning on making again this week as muchrooms are on sale.

I actually cooked the spinach for a warm salad + stir-fryed the mushrooms with red peppers, and  added chinese noodles in the mix, it was delish!

This salad is so delicious! I made a bit extra so I could have some the next day, but I decided I had to eat it all right then, that's how good it is! I made a few minor alterations, I used balsamic vinegratte dressing instead of balsamic vinegar, I tossed in chopped baby carrots, onion and garlic in the pan.  Then I tossed in some raw cucumber after the salad was in the bowl along with some shredded Jack cheese, mixed it all up with the baby spinach leaves and waa lah! A very tasty dish. I want to have this meal nonstop for dinner every night of the week! And it is so simple to make you can't really go wrong!

I increased the mushrooms to over 2cups  (I used shitake) over 8oz of spicy mesclun greens. I guess I waited too long to put the mushrooms on top since the greens did not wilt at all and I think this messed up my proportions (our salad was HUGE). Will add quicker next time. Also added shaved parm on top - yum

I like to add a little butter with the olive oil when cooking the mushrooms, it adds a nutty richness.

This salad was absolutely amazing. I decided to make a nice meal for my boyfriend after he'd had a bad week at work, and he loved it. i couldn't get the vinegar though so I used italian salad dressing and it was awesome. Will try with viegar next time! Thank You!

This was an excellent salad.  The only change/addition I made was feta cheese.  My husband thought this was the best salad and he doesn't even like Balsamic Vinegear.

Don't worry about the warmed mushrooms wilting the lettuce -- that was minimal (less than I'd hoped for, really).

Reminds me of a salad I had in southern Spain. I sautéed the sliced mushrooms in butter. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. So good!

This has become a staple in my kitchen. It is something everyone  in my household loves.  sometimes I serve it over mashed potatoes,  instead of salad. I like adding cherry tomatoes, 2 cloves of garlic, almond slices.

I made this for my dinner group this week and it was very tasty.  I wish I had seen the other reviewers comments about adding the cheese, that would have added the crowning touch to the salad in my opinion.

This made a nice change from my usual green salad. I did add a couple of pinches of italian seasoning to the mushrooms when I added the balsamic vinegar. Many Thanks.

I had a similar salad a few days earlier but the portion was so small and since I wanted to eat more, I tried this recipe at home.  This was exactly what I wanted to eat!  I also added sliced red and yellow bell peppers I had left over from another recipe.  Matched quite well with the salad.
