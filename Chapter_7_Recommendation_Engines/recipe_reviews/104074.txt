This was decent, but I was not extremely impressed.  I think that the recipe would have done better witout the lime juice and maybe vanilla extract or something.  It was just rather bland, and since it wasn't rich it just didn't have a whole lot going for it.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I was hoping for.

My boyfriend loves this cheesecake he's diabetic so I have to find ways to make him treats without the sugar  my only problem seems to be that the cake gets brown after 30 min.

I made this into a chocolate cheesecake by doing the following: adding 2 - 1 oz. bars of unsweetened chocolate, melted; did not add the lime juice but instead added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I also used Sugarfree shortbread cookies, crushed up for the crust.  I did not add the Splenda to them but did put the margerine in.  It came out great!  Try it!

I made this today to take to a meeting at church.  The ladies loved it!  it was so creamy.  I didn't have lime juice on hand, I used a dash of Lemon extract.  You can't tell it is sugar free!!!

This recipe is fantastic! Creamy texture and great taste. I did not make a crust and just baked the filling and cut down even further on the fat and carbs.  You will never even miss the crust as it comes out like the NY style cheesecake. Bake the filing for the entire time at 350 AND cover the top with non-stick foil to prevent excessive browning.  You will love it!!!

Wasn't crazy about this cake. It was very dense and "heavy". It left an artificial sweetener after taste in my mouth:(

I made this cheesecake for New Year's Eve and truly wanted to eat it all myself, instead of sharing it with friends.  It was very good, and I made it in an even lighter version using Neufchatel cream cheese instead of the two whole fat cream cheeses.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of mini chocolate chips.  Cake is a bit dense, but I enjoyed it immensely.

I made this cheesecake a few weeks ago and loved it!!  I did change it up a bit though.  instead of lime juice I added lemon juice, decreased the eggs to 3, added 1 teaspoon vanilla and added 1/2 c sour cream.  I also made just a bottom crust because I could not get the sides to stay up no matter what I tried!!!

I made this with the addition of 8 oz more cream cheese, Coffeemate sugarfree French Vanilla, leaving out the lime juice and using lemon instead for the acidity for the bake sale at my husbands Army unit to raise funds for families of our deployed members. But after the first slice, everyone was afraid that it would be an I quote "a million calorices a bite!" It didn't matter that it was explained that it was sugarfree and even diabetic allowed, ones bought 1/4 or 1/2 slices, and they are all on a 3500 caloric a day diet! So it tasted as if it was decadant when it isn't. Try it, I made it in 2 sugarfree gramah cracker pie shells, add fresh fruit of any kind if you want, but expect one's to not believe they can have it! Those two pies make $128.00 for our FRG fund, so thanks to your making Splenda and Coffeemate using it in their creamers, we could buy something for each of our deployed members children a gift from the unit, we are a small unit but care about each other, thank you for helping with wonderful recipes like this.

I made this recipe to give as a gift to my friend. She loved this cheesecake.  She mentioned that she could not tell the difference that sugar was not used. The only thing that I added to it was a sugar free cherry topping.
