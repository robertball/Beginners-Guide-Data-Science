This recipe comes together pretty quickly and is very good.  The slices of brie were a little challenging but I bought the small round brie about 5" in diameter, cut that in half and then cut slices.  It was just enough for two sandwiches.  I omitted the mustard that was optional just so we could enjoy the fresh flavors of the apple brie and bacon.  I served with some grapes and chardonnay, thanks for the great recipe!
