We call this a Peach Bulldog and we only use 2 parts cranberry juice with an unflavored vodka and no lime juice.  It is a fabulous drink and this is a fun variation on it.

Fantastic!! I had this version at a Christmas party at the Beverly Hills Four Seasons Hotel and the bartender was making them "your way" It is the only way to make them as far as I am concerned. Thanks for the recipe for this.

This was delicious! I was worried it was going to be too sweet with the peach schnapps but it was perfect, thanks Lori!

It's amazing how much the peach flavor comes through, even though you use only a bit of it!  I love citron vodka.....so versatile and a bit unique.  FANTASTIC cocktail!
