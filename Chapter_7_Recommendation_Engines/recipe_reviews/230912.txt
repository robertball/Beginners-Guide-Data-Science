Easy and yummy! "10% milk" is half-and-half. I substituted evaporated milk.

Made this at a get together this past weekend and it was delicious!!!  I will definitely be using this again and will never buy Caesar dressing again. It's so easy to make.

I really like to use plain yoghurt and a touch of lemon juice instead of mayonnaise and everyone enjoys my potato salad.  I also use ground black pepper which is healthier. Thank you for this lovely recipe. I will try adding the bacon for my next batch. In South Africa we don't have these exact ingredients, so I substituted our locally made Parmesan cheese.  I also sometimes chop up Camembert, Brie or other white cheese instead.

This was very good.  Added a bunch of Caesar flavored croutons and nixed the bacon. The dressing didn't get super thick. It did make a lot- I only used half for the salad. The potatoes were a great addition.  Will make it again.
