This is a very easy recipe, one of the best things about it is you usually have all the ingredients on hand to make it on short notice without shopping or running to the store.  We had this on NFL playoff game day an everyone loved it.  I added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne but like most chile recipes you can always experiment.

Perfect!  I added 1/4 cup of green bell peppers.  I also tried the orange bell peppers.  It gave it a little sweeter taste.  I used 2 cans - 15 oz each of tomato sauce, which was an equivalent to 3 cups.
