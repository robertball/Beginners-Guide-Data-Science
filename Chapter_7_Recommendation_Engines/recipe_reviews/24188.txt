When tasting this recipe as I was assembling I felt the bleu cheese was overpowering. After I put them together and let them sit in the refrigerator for a couple hours the flavors all came together and the bleu cheese flavor blended perfectly. This appetizer was a big hit in our household and disappeared in minutes. This is a keeper folks and it is simple to prpare.

I used gorgonzola instead of stilton because it was on sale and then switched the port for some brandy because it's what I had and used Sweet & Spicy pecans from Trader Joe's to save having to roast the nuts myself - So Tasty!! I'll be making these often.

I made these for a wine tasting event and they were a big hit. I will definitely make them again.
