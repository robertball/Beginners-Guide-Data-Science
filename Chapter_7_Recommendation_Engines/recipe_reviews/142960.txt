My husband was intrigued by this recipe and he tried it.  The flavor is good and savory, made me think of paella or arroz con pollo or something.  HOWEVER, you should cook the brown rice first, preferably in the brothy liquid.  He cooked the casserole an extra half hour and the rice still was crunchy. It makes me want to scratch my head: you cook everything else you put in this casserole, why not the rice??

Maybe with white rice this would have worked, but following the recipe exactly the rice is raw.  If I would have cooked it any longer it would have burned up.

As several people said, you MUST cook brown rice unless you are using Uncle Ben's or instant.  Regular brown rice must cook for at 45 minutes with a cup of rice to 2 cups of liquid.  This alone would make the recipe a 5 Star recipe.  Knowing this, I loved it, but rated it based on the recipe as written, not on my dish.  Also agree that putting the cheese on the side would make for better leftovers. Thanks for posting an excellent recipe.  I would suggest changing the rice to say instant brown or showing it as cooked brown rice.  But it is worth the work.

Sorry this looked similar to one of my families favorites but the tastes just did not come together.

Like other reviewers, I changed the rice in the recipe. I made fresh basmati and used that for the bottom layer. I reduced cook time to 15 minutes with foil then an additional 10 with the cheese and gluten free bread crumbs. We really liked it and will make again.

Great template for the creative use of a number of leftovers--like leftover cooked brown rice. Thank you.
