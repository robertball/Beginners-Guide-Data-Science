oh, good heavens are these delicious! I was desparate to play with some dough in my dorm and have some breakfast food in my room for when I dash out the door in the morning. I was running low on my baking supplies and didn't have any yeast, so I was very excited to have found a recipe without much preparation time needed. I mixed up some glaze to put on top-oh, how they melted in my mouth! I got a lot of dirty looks when I told others I wasn't sharing (I ended up sharing anyway-grrrr) and now I have only four left.  I am going to make these all the time now! talk about giving me a good reason to wake up in the morning! The only modification I made was I mixed the filling together and THEN spread it on the dough-I made a little more filling than called for and poured the extra on the bottom of the baking pan before I placed the rolls in it. This makes them nice and gooy on the one side.

From some of the other reviews, it sounded like they were expecting your traditional cinnamon rolls (the kind that requires yeast). These are not like that at all, and what I got are more like what the name suggests: brown sugar and cinnamon biscuits (contrary to what the author of the recipe claims).  They have the flaky consistency of biscuits but with a sweet twist. Still very tasty though, and so quick and easy if you're craving cinnamon rolls but don't have all the time needed for it...

these biscuits were pretty good! i was surprised after reading all the bad reviews but i decided to give it a try anyway- i was out of cream of tartar so i just skipped that ingredient but it came out great! a tip for others- make sure you flour your surface and hands alot before rolling the dough because it was a little sticky. instead of spreading the butter and then sprinkling brown sugar and cinnamon i mixed all three together and spread it. well, again this recipe rocked! thanks monstermama!

I made these rolls again yesterday and they are so fantastic!  They are easy and quick and a great knockoff for cinnamon rolls.  They bake up a bit flaky but soft and the next day are terrific popped in the microwave.  I make a simple cream cheese frosting to top them, pair them with fruit and we are set for breakfast.  I will continue to make these great rolls.  Yum!!

In spite of what the introduction says, these tasted like nothing more than baking powder biscuits with a cinnamon sugar swirl. That in itself was pretty unique. I can also see where one would need to frost with a cream cheese or powdered sugar glaze. Though the instructions say to bake for 15-20 minutes, mine were overbaked at 14. Fresh from the oven, these have a wonderful taste, but after they sit for an hour or so, they taste like a b.p. biscuit with a little cinnamon sugar. Pretty dry for my gang. Thanks anyway, monstermama.

I don't know what I did wrong here. My dough was really dry. It wouldn't roll properly and fell apart while I was cutting it. I was so disappointed but somehow the biscuits still turned out great! I'll definitely try it again on a better day. Maybe add a little more brown sugar to the dough next time.

This is my first attempt at making homemade cinnamon rolls...I had some of the same problems as previous reviewer amberlyn, the dough did fall apart when cutting them but they still turned out pretty good once baked. Not as fluffy as I would have liked but I think that can be improved when I try these again in the future. I drizzled a powdered sugar "sauce" over all and were still tasty despite flaws.

These are soooo good! They taste like the cinnamon rolls you make from Bisquick. YUMMY! I can never get the yeast right in regular cinnamon rolls, but I don't have to worry anymore. I used regular Crisco b/c I didn't have butter flavor. I made everything up the night before, sealed it up in plastic wrap, and then cut the biscuits off the roll in the morning. Perfect before school! Thank you!!

This review has to be more on the idea of the recipe. I used buscuit mix and added brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla to it. I then kneaded it briefly and used a tablespoon to scoop out drops which I rolled in cinnamon/sugar mix. Using my fingers and the spoon I made them round and flattened them into buscuits. They were yummy with butter on them and like regular bicuits they freeze and micro pretty easy. Thanks for the idea! It is a nice alternative to cold cereal or pancakes.

Using 1/4 cup of mild molasses & 1/4 cup of granulated sugar instead of 1/4 cup of brown sugar will keep these "biscuits" a moister, more caramel flavor.

I made this recipe vegan by substituting soy milk and vegan margarine for milk and butter... these substitutions may be the reason that these turned out so DRY...  Even with the dryness, they were eaten pretty quickly, especially when covered in an icing made of soymilk, vanilla and 10X sugar!

These were really good — similar to a less sweet version of a cinnamon roll.  I made these as stated with the exception of using butter in place of butter-flavored shortening (I never use shortening!).  Make sure to roll the long side of the dough up and not the short side :).  When I rolled mine out and cut into 12 slices, they looked pretty small, but don’t worry, they will rise!  Delicious and easy!

Excellent! I put a teaspoon of vanilla and a half teaspoon of almond extract in the biscuit dough. To die for! I can't have cinnamon, so I left that out and the inside of the rolls turned out like brown sugar caramel. We really loved this recipe and will make it often.

Though they were a bit sweet to be a biscuit to have with dinner they were still very delicious. The biscuits actually make great little cakes to top with fruit and whipped cream for a yummy summer dessert!

I was disappointed considering the rave reviews. Mine came out just like biscuit texture in cinnamon roll form. Very disappointing.

Move over Cinnabun!  I used "I can't believe it's not butter light" instead of shortening, skim milk and sprinkled chopped pecans over the brown sugar.  My husband went nuts!  Will make for the extended family at the next early morning get together.  Used the icing at the end too!  Yum!

The dough for this recipe is very similar to my biscuit recipe.  I made these just like I would my biscuits and they came out nice and flaky.  I did not use the icing at all.  I just kneaded the dough briefly, patted it out and cut with my biscuit cutter and baked.  Really have to be careful not to overwork biscuit dough or you will have hard/dry biscuits.  My husband said that these tasted like cookies.  What a pleasant change of pace to my standard biscuits that I serve.  Thank you.

These have the texture of a biscuits but look like a cinnamon roll. They were fast and easy to make. I had no trouble rolling or cutting them. My only change was to use 1/4 c. butter & 1/4 c. shortening because I didn't have the butter flavored shortening. It seemed to work fine. Also, next time I may cut the cinnamon to 4 tsp and increase the brown sugar. Thanks for an easy sweet treat!

Rating reflects on most of the recipe idea but I do not use the cream of tartar which can be drying.   Might be the reason some had trouble rolling them out.  Also, try and use unsalted butter - makes difference to texture and flavor. Have a wonderful flavor and just as good as cinnamon rolls.

They were tasty, but very dry. I followed another reviewer's advice and doubled the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture to line the bottom of the pan, and that made it a little better, but only on the bottom. With some editing I may make this again.

These are pretty good. I think next time I'll cook for maybe 10-12 minutes, add more sugar and try a glaze icing.  

If you go into it not expecting cinnamon rolls then you won't be disappointed.

Quick and easy to make, my son LOVED these.  Used half white, half wheat flour, and "tub butter" for spread as healthier choices.  Will add this to the family's repertoire.

I liked the idea behind this recipe, read some of the other reviews and decided to give it a try.  I added a hefty sprinkle of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and used real butter, but otherwise I followed the directions.  I know that over-kneading dough like this will cause it to be tough, so when the dough did not come together well I scrapped the idea of rolling it out like you would for cinnamon rolls.  I shaped it into a circle and cut into into wedges for scones. I rubbed some softened butter on top and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking.  After baking I drizzled some icing on top and served them to my kids.  They were a hit.  One of my sons has repeatedly asked for them.  They are a fast, easy snack or addition to breakfast.

I did not care for these at all. They were dry and not very flavorful. If you insist on trying them, when you make the filling...use half the suggested amount of cinnamon and maybe add some more brown sugar. Also I suggest mixing the sugar/cinnamon combo into the butter and spread it all on together.

I have not made these cookies, but the women in our family used to make these from left over dough after the pies were done.  It stems back many generations and in french families, they are called "pete de soeur".  Delicious.

I was anxious to try this recipe since I always make pinwheels with my left over pie crust and these sounded similar.  They were excellent.  Believe it or not, I was out of milk this morning but I did have buttermilk so I substituted that.  And I noticed that I needed to add a little more buttermilk than the 2/3 cup that recipe called for in order to make a good dough.  But I didn't measure it.  Another 'glob' maybe?  I'm so pleased to have a cinnamon roll recipe that didn't require yeast and proofing.  Not sure why some people weren't happy with the results.  I was and will definitely make again!!  Thanks for sharing!!

I've made these twice, and we really like them!  I only gave 4 stars, because it seems like there should be icing or something to make it complete.  Very easy!

I enjoy these on the weekends instead of the typical weekday bowl of cereal.  I get requests for them very often.

I can't stop eating these!  They are definitely biscuits and not cinnamon rolls, but delicious nonetheless!

These were DELICIOUS! I substituted buttermilk for the milk, and was careful not to over bake them. I removed them from the oven as soon as they started browning, which was 16 minutes for me. Very tender & tasty. A light drizzle of vanilla glaze was perfect.

I've made these biscuits multiple times and everyone loves them with an icing recipe I found. They're tasty and fairly simple to make.

I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, and maple syrup instead of vanilla. They were delicious!! I will be making these again in the near future!

Ok so I cut the recipe in half just in case I didn't like it, (plus I had just enough cinnamon.) but now u wish u hadn't. These are do delicious and warm and just soooo good! Mine don't look as pretty but I can fix that next time. Oh and I just added more baking powder for cream of tartar plus I used butter for shortening.

Family loved, not too sweet.  I drizzled a simple powdered sugar and milk glaze on top.
