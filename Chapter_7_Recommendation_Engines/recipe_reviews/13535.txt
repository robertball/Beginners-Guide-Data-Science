Good and simple, and definitely reminiscent of a Caesar salad.  Open to lots of different variations if you want.  Thank you for posting this!

Very simple, yet delicious dressing.  I use the dressing on all sorts of salads - I like anchovies.  Even if you do not like anchovies, you may like this because they are blended into the dressing.  The acidity of the lemon juice balances the anchovies' saltiness.  I do not always use the Parmesan cheese - in combination with the anchovies, it adds additional salt.  You might try cutting back on both the anchovies and the cheese if you wish to include both.

I just made this and it's very good.  It's quick and easy and tastes like light caesar salad.  I added more garlic and lemon juice to the dressing.  It really improved the taste.  Thank you for the recipe.

This dressing is fantastic!  Confession...used anchovy paste; had on hand rather than the actual “anchovies” and was pleased to determine that after blending with the other ingredients, this shortcut proved to be acceptable in a pinch! I love this salad because it fits the bill as an appetizer and/or salad and can be made in a short time before hand. Delicious and simple, yet fairly elegant in its presentation. Pairs well with poultry, pork and beef, as well as an excellent start to a seafood entree (especially pan seared large scallops!). Can’t go wrong!
