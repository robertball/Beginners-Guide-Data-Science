I made this for about 24 people, including 6 kids. They ate most of it and liked it just fine. However, I did add 1/4 cup of brown sugar when I made it because my husband thought it needed a little sweetness.
It was a pretty yellow color. I did make it one day in advance and it did just fine the next day on my Christmas party buffet table.

This is just an incredible tasting dip. Great little tang,that adds so much to the veggies. The color is really appealing. Do make it the night before-as this one gets better & better with mellowing the flavors together.

I served this at aretirement party last year and have been requested to serve it again at a party this week.  It has a unique flavor and is a change from the ever-present ranch vegetable dip.

This was great!  I was skeptical at first because it called for mayonnaise and not sour cream, but it was surprisingly wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

Not good at all! The guests were not impressed and I ended up throwing it all out. I let it sit overnight and that helped but I will never make this again!

Delicious!  I made a few changes:  used light mayonnaise, replaced grated onion with 1/2 t minced dried onion, and used 1/4 t tarragon + 3 t white vinegar.  Took it to my book group and everyone asked me what was in the dip.

I thought it was okay, as did my guests.  I think that my main problem is that I always think that I like curry better than I actually do!  The dip was well balanced, and generally pleasant; I just thought I would like it better than I did.

I love this dip.  The curry gives sit a punch.  Although my husband and all the guests liked another dill dip better, this is the one for me.  It goes especially well with carrots.

This is very different than your normal veggie dip and I can see that non-adventurous eaters may not enjoy this! It has a perfect balance of flavors and if I didn't know what was in it, I couldn't guess. I used balsamic vinegar since it is what I had on hand. I refrigerated it for about 3 hrs and I just had to test it. Turns out it was already so addicting, I ended up washing and cutting up all my fresh veggies so I could eat more dip!! I immediately made another batch. I did add a pinch of salt and a little black pepper. Will definately make this again!!!!

This was a big hit, and so attractive in a decorative bowl - everyone wanted the recipe.  This will become one my my staple veggie dips because it's different than the standard ranch dip and just as easy.

The relatives thought this was pretty tasty, and not at all spicy.  We followed the recipe exactly, right down to the tarragon vinegar.  The color is really nice, the only problem is that everyone assumed it was made with mustard!

This is an amazing recipe!   I always have to double it because it goes so fast.  The color is unique, so people shy away from it at first, then once they taste it--it flys of the table!

I'm not sure how to rate this since the recipe obviously uses yellow curry (since curry powder is a mixture of spices there is a wide range of curry powders) and I don't do yellow (asian) curry. I used red (Indian) curry and left out the horseradish because I was out and red curry powder is spicy already. This was pretty good with carrots but really good with tortilla chips. I think it would make a really good dip for chips or crackers if you added crab and a little sharp cheddar but don't forget to use the red curry.

Made this as the recipe was written except I only used 1/4 tsp horseradish.  I am not overly fond of horseradish.  Served it at a back yard BBQ and it was well received.

You really need to be a curry lover to enjoy this one. I followed the recipe exactly, but the curry flavor was too overwhelming for it to be enjoyable. At a function with about 25 people, there was no obvious change in volume and nobody went back for seconds. It was not a hit.

This is a great alternative to the traditional veggie dip!  I didn't have tarragon vinegar, but had fresh tarragon in the garden - used some of that with red wine vinegar and it was fabulous.  I'll have to keep an eye out for tarragon vinegar, but until then, I'll probably use my dried tarragon.  I used this dip for everything in my garden...carrots, zucchini, bell peppers, pea pods...  It kept well too. Thank you.

Prepared exactly as written and let sit overnight.  It was the best vegetable dip I have ever eaten.  This will be my only vegetable dip from now on.

FANTASTIC!!!! This can be made several days ahead and still taste/look fabulous. Next time, I will make it at least 2 days before so the color can fully develop. Even people who don't like curry said it was delicious. Try this with jicama.

I didn't have tarragon vinegar, so I substituted 1Tbsp balsamic instead. I've made this 3 times since Christmas, once with sour cream. It was too sour, so stick with mayo. You should experiment with smaller amounts of balsamic in case yours is more intense than the one I used. I've had numerous requests for the recipe, so I consider this a winner!

I made a small amount of this and ate it with sliced cucumbers as a pre-dinner snack.  It's really good because it's different than the usual veggie dip... (I also did not have tarragon vinegar so used dried along with some rice vinegar.)

I love this vegetable dip.  It is unique and not your usual run of the mill ranch dip.  Definitely let it sit overnight before serving; the flavors need to bloom.

Mmmmm. This was yummy. It's not the common vegetable dip that is typically served. I like it because it's "something different". It went very well with red peppers.

The curry is too strong, horseradish too sharp, and the garlic too pervasive.  Cut these ingredients in half and definitely add sugar.

I made this for Christmas for a vege platter and my kids could not get enough of it!!!  I think next time I might add a little sour cream just to cut it a little.  My kids want me to make this dip next time I make wings.  That's how much they liked it.

I was looking for something light for a Thanksgiving appetizer. Also had to be dairy free. I made it with vegan mayo, fresh garlic finely chopped. More than it called for. It was a hit. Lots of compliments. Made it the night before and definitely tasted better then next day.

This really is as delicious as other reviewers have said. Just brought it to a dinner party and all seven other people raved about it.

I don't usually like curry but I loved this!  Nice change from my usual dill or spinach artichoke dips.  I had to substitute balsamic vinegar because it's what I had available.

This is the most amazing veggie dip ever! I have been bringing it to parties for a couple years now and Everyone loves it. I don't always remember to make it the night before, but it's still delicious and a big hit.

This has been an old family favorite for decades. My original recipe calls for 1tsp. garlic salt in place of the crushed garlic and 1tsp. white vinegar in place of the tarragon vinegar. I need to try this recipe because mine is way to salty for my taste.

Took this dip to a small group outing, all the women wanted the recipe. It was delicious, and would make a wonderful sandwich spread as well.

My family loves this for a change instead of normal chips and dips.  It is great with all kinds of fresh veggies.

Simply amazing blend of flavors.  Wonderful complement to raw vegetables.  My personal favorite is with broccoli.  Raw broccoli is not my favorite -- but I may be eating it more often now.  Thanks for posting.
