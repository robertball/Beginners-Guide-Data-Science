My friends and I tried this on New Year's eve, but we realized we only had crystalized ginger. It was actually really good with the crystalized and may be even better with the pickled. I will definitely try and update.

I tried it with my homemade champagne and all I had crystalized ginger, it turned out pretty good.  I will do this again with sushi.

I really liked it...however I was the only one. Everyone thought the ginger was too strong.

Didn't taste the ginger as much as I thought I would but did make a couple of minor variations in technique. I keep pickled ginger in the fridge and vodka in the freezer. So instead of shaking with ice, I muddled the ginger in the bottom of the glass, poured in a bit of vodka and topped off with the champagne. Looked lovely when the ginger pieces started to dance on the bubbles and went great with the sushi I had for dinner. LATER: I realized that my champagne glasses are bigger than the one shown so I added more ginger and a bit of the juice from the jar. Great!
