Really good, I used rice vinegar and it tasted good to me and the first time I made it I didn't think there was enough sauce.  So when I made it the second time I doubled all the ingredients for the sauce and I think it turned out pretty good. I'll probably try and tweak it just a little more, but its a good recipe!  Thank you for posting this!! my husband went on a mission to China and so loves all Asian food and he really enjoyed it!

Good basic recipe. I used more pork so had to double the sauce. Next time I think I'll look at other recipes to see if I can add anything to bump up the flavour a bit.

This was very good, though I doubled everything except for the water and the tofu.  It worked out great for 3 people with enough for 1 meal after.
