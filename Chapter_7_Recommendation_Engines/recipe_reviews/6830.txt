Wow! This natural-foods enthusiast says, "thumbs up". I revised some of the ingredients, and it was still incredibly delicious. The pale pink color inside is lovely as well.

[I scaled down the sugar to about 1 cup (and used raw), and I used a combo of alternate grains (cornmeal, rice flour,buckwheat, etc.)to substitute part of the whole wheat flour for variety. To add moisture and reduce fat, I substituted applesauce for part of the vegetable oil. Adding a pinch of ginger spices it up nicely too. It's so good that I'm baking it for the teachers at my kids' school for their special luncheon. Thank you!!]

My husband didn't like this bread. He said it tastes like flour... I didn't find it anything special or great either.

This loaf turned out great! I cut back the sugar to 1/2c. and the oil to 1/4c.  I also added one extra banana and doubled the strawberries.  Chopped pecans were a great addition, as well as 3 T. of cocoa.  What a great chocolatey and healthy treat!

Good, although I think the recipe needs some adjustments.  It certainly needs a small amount of salt and vanilla.   I added pecans which and used frozen strawberries.  Fresh strawberries would be much better since the frozen ones kind of just turned to mush when I tried to stir them into the batter.  If you want more strawberry taste, you could add strawberry puree for daiquiris in addition to the chopped fresh strawberries.

Don't let the amount of sugar in this recipe scare you off - I made it with only 1/2 cup of sugar and it came out great. It makes it more of a snack bread and less of a dessert. I also reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and added a bit of salt, vanilla and nutmeg. Very good!

Very moist & full of flavor. The outside of the bread did start browning too much so I cut the temp down by 25 degrees.

I took the bread out of the oven after one hour. It came out very moist, best eaten with a fork, and very tasty. I could have left it in longer for firmer bread but the outside seemed to be getting too brown to leave in the oven.

The bread seemed over-done when I cooked it the hour and 15 minutes. If I made it again, I'd cook it for less time. The flavor was pretty good.

Whole wheat banana stawberry bread was quick to make and tasted great, especially after being in the refrigerator a few days. We liked it lightly toasted with a little butter.

This is really good! I cut the sugar down to only one cup, and it was absolutely enough. I also made into muffins instead of bread. Made 12 good size muffins, baked at 350 for 19 minutes.

I made this a few days ago for my children, and even my husband who is not a fan of strawberrries or wheat bread enjoyed it.  I did substitute applesauce for all of the oil and honey for all of the sugar to make it a little more healthy and it still turned out nice and moist.  Yum!

I had a lone overripe banana to use and a pathetically small rhubarb plant that I wanted to make at least *something*  with.  Found this recipe and reduced the serving size down to a third of the original (for the lone banana) and doubled the rhubarb (like many did with the strawberry component) and made muffins with it (start with about 20 min for baking time).  I don't know if it helped or not but I coated the chopped rhubarb in some of the sugar first to sweeten it a bit while I prepared the rest of the ingredients.  Next time I will add a pinch of salt, too, I think.

I made this by hand and it was awesome. One of the only recipes I used as written and didn't have the desire to modify. The bread was so moist and soft. WE LOVED IT! Can't wait to go strawberry picking just for this bread.

Great base recipe that I could change up to suit my needs. I had to make just a couple of substitutions to cut back on sugar and use the ingredients I had on hand. Thanks for sharing.

This was great! I changed a LOT though..i used only 1/2 c of oil, 1 c white sugar and 2 mashed bananas. I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of salt. Then i folded in some blueberries and topped half with walnuts...soooo good!

This recipe is wonderful!!  My husband is hard to please and keeps raving about it.  I made it late last night and we had it for breakfast this morning.  I made it EXACTLY according to the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.  My loaf pan must have been smaller than the one others used because some of the batter boiled over and I had to slip a metal pan under my glass loaf pan to catch it.  I cooked it for the full time and it was brown on the top but it was a delicious crust that tasted buttery even though there was no butter in the recipe.  I usually have to cook recipes about 20 minutes longer than the recipes called for though so maybe this one was just right for my oven.  I've had the same issue with the last 3 ovens I've owned, so maybe it's our climate.  Anyway, I would recommend not changing a thing but make sure your loaf pan isn't more than 2/3 full to avoid any spilling over.  THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!

This was just okay. It would make a nice plain banana bread. I wasn't thrilled the the strawberries just turn kind of slimy.

First let me say I have never tried to make bread before ever in my life but I made this today...and it's great!! I made 2 changes and that was to cut the sugar down to about a half cup and I also baked it for only an hour. I will use more strawberries next time but the bread came out fantastic!

This came out okay, but not great (I did get some very good reviews, but I think next time I might try a different recipe). I did make some changes, though. I added salt, vanilla and more fruit than stated by the recipe, and I substituted splenda for sugar, egg beaters for eggs and applesauce for all of the oil. Overall there was nothing wrong with it, but I probably won't make it again. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.

Great recipe. But I did a few changes. I used 1/4 cup butter in place of oil and only used 1 and 1/4 cup of sugar. I also added 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup silk chai latte, a dash of salt, and little vanilla extract. I also added pecan pieces and sliced an extra banana on top of the loaf before baking. It came out soooo good!!!

Something isn't quite right with this recipe...maybe too much oil??  I baked it at a lower temp, but the outside still got really brown, while the inside was mushy.  I tried it just out of the oven, then hoped it would be better the next day...no such luck.  If I ever want this kind of bread again, I'll just use my standard banana bread recipe, sub whole wheat flour, add strawberries.

I had everything in the kitchen to make this bread. Very easy! I ommited the oil and use a fruit based baking substitute instead. I liked it so much, I tried it with blueberries too. (which was even better than the strawberry) Pecans are a great add in as well!

Not bad but just not great.  I didn't think the strawberries had much impact on the recipe.  The bread did turn out very moist and it does brown very quickly - but overall - no big whoop.

My family loved this loaf!  
I had some pretty sad looking strawberries from the garden that had sat around too long.  The loaf didn't care.  
I added a cup of chopped walnuts and divided the batter between two pans.

This is a healthier option of banana bread. From the original recipe, I added 1/4 cup of plain yogurt (this helped the bread to taste and look smoother) and added some walnuts in pieces. Also, I only pour 1/4 cup of oil and 1 cup of sugar, and still tastes sweet.

I made this with strawberries I picked yesterday. I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil, added extra cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. It tastes awesome! I wish it was a little bit drier. I couldn't bake it any longer to dry it out some, because the top was beginning to get too brown and crispy.

This bread turned out awesome even though I changed quite a few things like made it with gluten free flour and ground flax, and used raw honey instead of sugar. Turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as muffins as well but I didn't get 12 good sized muffins, more like 12 medium muffins.  Next time I will add a cup of oatmeal to increase the content.  I also want to try this by adding rhubarb, which my family loves, as several other reviewers suggested.

I didn't have enough fresh strawberries to make a full cup.  I added 1/2 cup of coconut to the batter.  The bread came out nice and sweet, maybe a bit too sweet. I used 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and added 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  I also reduced my oven temperature to 325.  It took 1 hour, 45 minutes to bake.  It's a simple recipe.  Next time, I think I'll cut back on the sugar.

the strawberry disappeared into the bread and there was not enough banana to make a statement, even though I added slightly more than suggested in the recipe. It really didn't have anything wonderful about it, just a dry lacklustre fruit bread. I may try it again with increased everything, but not in any hurry

After reading the reviews, I decided to make changes to the recipe as well.  I was doubling the recipe for a camping trip with my larger family, so I used a 9x13 pan.  I used 3c wheat flour and 1c white flour, added a touch of vanilla extract, an extra dash or two of cinnamon, 2 dashes allspice, and a heaping handful each of freeze dried strawberries and walnuts.  (Recipes for quick breads don't require precision measurements)  I baked the bread in a 325 degree oven for 1 hour, and the bread came out moist, delicious, and cake-like.  My family loved it.  With the moisture level I got using freeze dried fruit, I would not recommend using wet fruits.

I made this recipe for a hypoglycemic friend of mine by substituting the sugar with splenda and the oil with apple sauce and it still turned out really good. I was AMAZED!!!! I did increase the strawberry amount to almost two cups of quartered strawberries, but the bread part tasted delicious. I think next time I will use one more banana though.

As is, this recipe does not work.  I forgot to read the reviews before making it, so I made it exactly as it reads. The top was burned, the inside too moist, and it fell apart coming out.  The flavor is ok, but a little sweet, and I think too much oil.  Wish I had taken suggestions from others.

This was a tasty bread, but nothing spectacular.  The strawberries don't add much flavor so if you want that flavor I would suggest adding more and probably mashing them up or pureeing them.
