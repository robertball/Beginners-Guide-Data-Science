oh boy,  this is good.  i double the pepper since i love the heat and skip cognac since i dont have one in hand.  i add 2 tbs black sweet soy sauce for coloring and add cornstarch to thicken.  this is definitely a keeper.  so so good!

This was he perfect sauce for an herb-garlic pepper tenderloin on the grill.  I tripled the recipe and there was nothing left for a party of 15!

This is my "go to" recipe with beef tenderloin, even Salisbury Steak, boneless pork chops...it's the bomb.  I often make with heavy cream or even sour cream.  I slightly prefer the sour cream.  When I have it, I sometimes substitute Demi glace' for beef stock.  A pinch of citic acid or a teaspoon of lemon juice will brighten the flavor.  You need to try it!  It saves pretty good if there are leftovers.  I put it on my potato too.  Good stuff.

This recipe did not come out well at all.  I think there is too much butter, which made the sauce very oily.  It never got thick like au Poivre should.  I think it may have too much beef stock or cognac.  Also, for a pepper corn there wasn't really any pepper.
I won't make this one again, sorry!

Strong work, Nick!  This recipe makes a LOT of sauce, so I would cut by 1/2 or 1/4 based on your needs. Also, I'm going to reduce the beef stock to 1/2 cup (ratio-wise) to ensure it's thicker -- the way I like my au poive.
