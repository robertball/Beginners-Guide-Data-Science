Wow, look no further for THE BEST oatmeal raisin cookie recipe.  I've tried 3 from this website and this one is the best- by a landslide.  Husband said it was the best oatmeal cookies he ever ate, and his mom makes this for her speciality, and my cookies came out better.  This is moist, chewy and perfectly sweet.  I followed other's advice and used all butter, which gave a fantastic buttery flavor and this stayed moist for a good 3 days (maybe longer, don't know cuz it never lasts that long in our house).  Just keep it in an airtight container.  And definitely watch your cooking time.  9 minutes was perfect, 10 min. gave it more color and add more crispness to the edges. I like mine soft and moist and this gives it all--look no futher folks!

These were very tasty cookies, I added another half teaspoon of cinnamon, a half teasoppon of nutmeg, and a 1/4 teaspoon of ginger.  I also used all butter.  I only left them in the oven for about 8 or 9 minutes so they would stay chewy after they cooled.  when I left them in for 12 minutes they were hard as a rock when they cooled off!

I did some checking and found that this recipe is pretty much the same that is printed by Quaker oatmeal. The only difference is the addition of cloves. I have been baking for years and have always relied on this recipe. The only change I make is to use pumpkin pie spice for a bit more kick. Thanks.

i've made this recipe dozens of times since I first found it on Allrecipes. This is not the same recipe as the Quaker Oat cannister. That is the recipe I use to make. I double checked. Of course there are similarities, butter, sugar, oatmeal, etc. What Beth changes makes all the difference. The use of butter flavored shortening gives moistness and the cloves give great flavor.  These are far superior to the recipe on the oatmeal box. They are the most delicious cookies. They have just the right amount of spice and crispy moistness. I would definitely use butter and not margarine. The taste is not the same adn studies are now showing margarine is no healthier than butter. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe, Beth. If you can come up with this great recipe, you should become a cookbook writer.

Oh. My. God.  These cookies are delicious!  I did make a few changes though.  I didn't have butter-flavored shortening, so I just used regular shortening and added 1/2 tsp of butter flavoring.  Also, a soaked the raisins in hot water first to plump them up, substituted allspice for the cloves, and dumped in a package of instant vanilla pudding to make the cookies moister.  The result?  One fabulous cookie!

BETH!!  I NEED HELP!!  YOUR RECIPE IS AMAZING..BUT I THINK I MESSED IT UP!!  I made the recipe exactly how the instructions say except I used all butter and no shortening like the others.  I also uses golden raisins.  When my cookies came out they were soft and perfect but they never HARDENED...this was to the point that they all broke apart and fell through the cracks of my cooling rack.  I mean, I love soft cookies, don't get me wrong, but you couldn't even pick these up without them falling apart.  It was almost like they didn't cook.  I was also baking them for well over the time suggested (13-15 minutes).  When I tried to salvage them into a container they formed into this big DELICIOUS block of oatmeal mess!  The only thing I can think of is that I put the dough in the fridge prior to baking them for about an hour because I had to run out.  Is that the problem??  I didn't know that this could make a difference.  Is it possible that my eggs or flour or something was too old or maybe bad?  I can't imagine that, but at this point I am desperate!  The cookies were seriously amazing (hence the 5 stars), and I want to make them again, but I need them to hold their shape and somewhat harden!  Please please will someone help me?  Thank you in advance!

I make awesome cookies, but I never had a good oatmeal raisin recipe. This one is it!  I used all butter flavored Crisco instead of using any butter (butter tends to burn in cookies).  I also soaked my raisins in warm water for 10 minutes before I added them to the dough.  Use the convection feature on your oven (If you have one).  Never grease or spray the pan (causes bottoms to burn).  Wipe the tray off between batches.  These cookies were soft and chewy with fabulous flavor!

This is THE SAME RECIPE as on the Quaker Oats container - the only difference is the addition of cloves.  The cookies turned out soggy and horrible.  Never again.

THE BEST cookie I have EVER tasted! I actually made an oatmeal mix for a trip I was going on that used cloves and cinnamon just like this recipe. I ended up not liking the oatmeal but didn't want to waste it, and when I came accross this recipe I was thrilled that it used the same ingredients! So I ended up making this cookie without changing anything, except using 1 cup of butter.  BUT, my oatmeal recipe did have 1 1/3 cups dry milk powder in it and I thought it might alter the cookies a little, but they turned out UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! So basically I doubled the cookie recipe, used all butter, and had 1 1/3 cups dry milk powder mixed in also!! THEY TURNED OUT SOOOO DELICIOUS!!!! I have DEFINATELY found my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe! I baked for 11 minutes each, and saw melted butter on the top when I took them out, but when they cooled overnight they ended up nice and chewy in the morning. TASTE LIKE BAKERY STYLE!! EVEN BETTER!! MMMMMMM I would give 100 STARS!!!!

Skip the shortening and replace it with the same amount of light olive oil.  You'll never taste the difference but your heart will appreciate the difference!!!  Enjoy!

This recipe came out absolutely wonderful!! My parents liked the cookies a lot. I did make a few changes after reading some of the reviews: 
1)	Soaked the raisins in hot water for about 10 mins and rolled them in flour before adding it to the cookie mix
2)	I used all brown sugar instead of white and brown and the sweetness was perfect (for my family)
3)	Finally, (and this might be helpful for those people who find theirs runny) after finishing making the cookie mix, I put it in the refrigerator for about 30 mins. (cleaned up until then) and then I dropped a tsp mix on the cookie sheet and baked for 12 mins. The rest was the same…gotta try it out those of you who haven’t!

This is the cookie that comes to mind when you think of oatmeal cookies. Sweet and mildly spicy, chewy and tender, with lots of raisins. The perfect comfort food. Why bother with any other oatmeal cookie recipe? Look no further - this is the real deal. Edited to add: It's true that this is not an original recipe. It's the old Quaker Oats recipe with only the addition of cloves. It's still arguably the best. It's certainly the best I've tried in over 46 years of baking, many of those years spent professionally! Perfect texture with the requisite chewiness and flavor. The addition of cloves kicks up the spiciness that is usually associated with a hearty, home made oatmeal raisin cookie. For those whose cookies came out too flat, adding 1-2 Tb flour will usually alleviate that problem. Just be aware that the cookie might be a tad denser as a result. For those who had trouble removing from the cookie sheet, use either parchment or foil (shiny side DOWN, and scoop the dough onto the dull side.) They will release after they are cool easily.

I wish i could give this more stars! this was an excellent recipe. I read quite a few reviews and combined some of the modifications for a wonderful recipe :) here is what i did. i did not have ground cloves, instead I used 
1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg and allspice. i used all butter instead of the butter/shortening combo and they came out very moist and delicious. i also  added chopped walnuts and soaked the raisins in hot water to make more plump. to top off, i used the brown butter cinnamon glaze as suggested by another user and these were perfect. needless to say,I'll be making another batch later on!  thanks for the post :)

Awesome!!!! I have tried these several times. I left all ingredients the same, Substituted 1/2 cup shortening with 1/2 cup applesauce; they are always wonderful. These cookies have turned one of my two year olds into a little cookie monster! Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely FANTASTIC! I have to admit. I LITERALLY did a dance when I tried this one. I bake most of my cookies at 300 degrees. About 15 mins does it every time (in my oven at least) for golden, chewy cookies done all the way through with just a slight crisp on the edge. I highly recommend using parchment or waxed paper for the perfect cookie bottom - cool on a flat surface. As with the choco chip cookies, Beth, you have another winner!

This has become a regular in the house (usually bake them twice a week).  The kids (aged 4, 3, and even the 2-year old) really love them, my husband raves about them (he's not a cookie lover, by the way) and practically anybody who'd tasted them.  I just reduced the white sugar a bit, but added 1/2 cup more of the raisins.  I omitted the shortening, but used 1 cup butter.  Still excellent.  Very versatile.

I simmered the raisins in some Dr. Pepper until they were very plump (about 20min). Then I drained them in a colander and lightly dusted them with 1 Tbsp. flour. The Dr. Pepper added to the flavour. Other than that, I follows the recipe exactly. YUM!

Hubs’ birthday is tomorrow and he requested I make both chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies for him to take to work for his birthday treat.  When I mentioned this particular recipe, with its unusual addition of cloves, he said he’d prefer them without because cloves are for ham.  He reluctantly agreed to let me give it a try.  So I did, with the cloves and using half butter, half regular shortening (I tried the butter-flavored once, long ago and didn’t like it).  Both of us loved them.  The cloves are barely noticeable, just serving to give a bland, boring oatmeal cookie a little kick of distinction.

Absolutely wonderful!!  I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour.  I also substituted the white sugar with Splenda and a touch of honey and used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (a little over 1/2 cup).  These are SOOOOOO good, chewy, and delicious!!

Thanks for the recipe =) I modified it to make it a bit for a healthier flair: in place of the shortening, I added 1/2 cup of canned pumpkin; in place of 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour; in place of just 1 cup of raisins, I mixed in 1/2 cup of chopped apples, 1/4 cup of golden raisins (soaked in warm water first) and 1/2 cup of sugar-free chocolate covered raisins (I had to add chocolate in there somehow!) YUM!! I had to bake my cookies for about 12-13 minutes.

These are the perfect oatmeal raisin cookie.  It is good to use the shortening with the butter because it keeps the cookies from spreading out and getting too thin or crisp.  Be sure not to soften your butter too much either, as this, too, will cause spreading.  I lined my baking sheets with wax paper first so they wouldn't stick, but also so I didn't have to grease, which, like so many other things, will lead to spreading.  I am only saying this because it seems to be the number one problem in baking, and with these tips, your cookies will come out perfectly.  I doubled the cinnamon, and I plumped my raisin by covering them in hot water for a few minutes and draining well before adding to the batter.  You can't fail with this recipe, and the cloves only makes it more seasonal tasting.  Enjoy!

Mmmm, very good!  I made a few changes to try to make them a bit healthier.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, added some flaxseed, and used butter instead of shortening (just because shortening grosses me out!).  I also added more raisins than called for, and added a few chocolate chips.  I baked these for 10 minutes on convection at 325.  They turned out great!!

This is the perfect holiday cookie recipe. After eating a few of these cookies, I found that I had gained a new inner-personal sense of joy and accomplishment.  I spent several frustrating years trying to bake a decent cookie, only to have other recipes end up burnt with inconsistent textures and tasting more like the raw ingredients and less like a finished cookie.  Beth's Spicy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies turned out so well, I decided to see what my young toddler thought of them. Suddenly, after eating these cookies, she no longer throws temper tantrums and has begun to speak several words in Japanese. I couldn't believe it.  These cookies were not only a godsend for me, however, but they also saved someone's life. I gave two dozen of these cookies to a friend over the holidays. Unfortunately, they got buried in the trunk of their car and forgotten about, until the blizzard hit in February. Even after several months in the trunk, when my friends got stranded for 3 days in their car during the blizzard, these cookies were just as warm, soft and fresh as the day they cam out of the oven. Jimmy and Sara owe their lives to those cookies.  If you are down on your luck, need to build confidence or even shed a few pounds, these cookies may do the trick. Their amazing miracle powers should not be underestimated.  Sincerely, Betsy Kilbourne

Good oatmeal cookies, but I still prefer the recipe on the container of Quaker brand oats. This recipe is very similar, the only difference is this recipe uses cloves along with half butter half shortening. I prefer oatmeal raisin cookies made with all butter instead. The addition of the cloves is very nice, but the 1/2 teaspoon was a bit too much for us. Next time I will use all butter, and cut down the cloves to 1/4 teaspoon. Thanks for sharing :)

Who doesn't love this recipe? I've always used it except with all butter and no shortening. Not terribly cool to change that one thing from the Quaker Oatmeal canister recipe and then claim it as your "own" recipe but it is nice to have online in case the "Vanishing Oatmeal Raisin Cookie" recipe ever vanishes from the lid of the canister :o)

It's probably redundant to add my opinion after this recipe has gotten over 1730 reviews, but these cookies were far too good for me to remain silent! OUTSTANDING, EXCELLENT and SCRUMPTIOUS are just a few words that immediately spring to mind!!! Everyone who has tasted these LOVES them! The combination and amounts of spice are just right; even the raisins taste good mixed in and I don't even like raisins!!!
Don't fool with this one by trying to alter the ingredients... just follow the recipe to the letter and you will not be disappointed. This is one of the best cookie recipes EVER!!!

The other reviews are not wrong, this is similar to the Quaker recipe, but the ratios are not the same and I think that makes ALL the difference.  These cookies are fantastic!!  I am a searcher: I hunt down and try many recipes until I find one I ADORE, then I write it on a note card and put it in my special recipe box.  This one is going in there right now!!

Fabulous cookies. Nice and chewy the way an oatmeal cookie is supposed to be. I used plain shortening instead of butter flavored and the taste of the cookie was still great. I also did not have any cloves, so I used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Absolutely delicious, i didnt have any cloves on hand so I simply ommitted them. A word to the bakers not having success, I found the trick to getting light fluffy cookies with a little crunch is to whip the butter first, then whip the sugar eggs etc into the butter (an electric mixer is perfect for the job. Use the mixer to blend in the flour. gently fold in the oats and raisins. For plump raisins, soak in hot water for 10 minutes prior to adding them, then drain well and add to your cookies. Bake for 8-9minutes (using a tablespoon measurement for sizing) at 350. Delicious!!! Ive never seen cookies disappear so fast!!!!

A very good Oatmeal rasin cookie, good texture as well as taste. If you've ever tried the recipe on the box of Quaker Oats for Vanishing Oatmeal Rasin Cookies, this is almost exactly the same. So if you liked those you'll like these too.

This is a very good recipe. As others have noted, it's nearly identical to the Quaker Oats recipe - but that doesn't mean it's not good! My changes were VERY minor: 1) I used margarine instead of the butter/shortening combo (just my preference. I use all butter when I want a crisper cookie) AND 2) I used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice rather than the cinnamon and cloves. Other things I found helpful to make a perfect batch of these cookies: I whisked the eggs before pouring them into the butter/sugar/vanilla mix, and then blended THAT with a whisk (gently) until smooth. No hand blender. I also folded in the dry ingredients in order using a wooden spoon until just incorported. I soaked my raisins in hot water while prepping the batter (makes for a much better raisin texture/taste). I refrigerated the dough between batches, and let the baked cookies cool on the pan a minute or so to set up before moving them onto a cookie rack to cool. NOTE: This recipe works just as well with fast-cooking oats as it does with regular rolled oats. It's even good with the multi-grain oats. Adding some walnuts and even pumpkin seeds tastes great too - especially when using pumpkin pie spice!

Mmmmm... great cookie recipe, Beth!
I took some of the most helpful advice, adding 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon, ginger and a touch of nutmeg. Baked for only 9 minutes. These disappeared rather quickly in my house! Thank you.

This was a chewy great tasting cookie.  I did grind the cloves.  There is nothing like fresh ground spices.  I made this for a conference and also a for friend who like myself prefers oatmeal raisin cookies over chocolate chips cookies anyday!   He really liked them too, he had to share a cookie in class with someone who smelled them.   But he only gave up one!  These cookies are good enough to make sure you have a small stash for yourself :)

This recipe was amazing, even with my few minor substitutions.  I used all real butter as opposed to shortening.  I had no rolled oats or cloves on hand, so I used old-fashioned oats and added extra cinnamon.  The cookies came out absolutely perfect!  They are also excellent with chocolate chips!

This is my standard oatmeal cookie recipe now.  The only thing different that I do is use all shortening.  It makes a consistently soft chewy cookie that holds its shape well.  I also make batches with dried cranberries and white chips instead of the raisins.  My Grandpa can't get enough of "my" oatmeal cookies.  Thanks for a great recipe!

To anyone who is getting cookies that are all crumbly, slightly underbake, then leave the cookies on the cookie sheet for at least 10 minutes after taking them out of the oven. This allows them to finish cooking without getting crispy. Every cookie recipe I've tried does better with this single tip (and I've made a lot of different cookies). 

I followed this recipe exactly, except I used butter instead of crisco and added 1/2 tsp baking powder and they turned out perfectly.

Made the recipe as directed, but was rather disappointed with the result. The taste is ok, but not very spicy, though very sweet. The mixture melted in the oven, so the edges where very crisp and the middle was rather soggy. The rest of the dough is in the fridge and I will make some more tomorrow, maybe the solidfied butter will help. Considering adapting it, more spices, less sugar, more flour&egg.

I love the addition of cloves to this classic oatmeal cookie recipe. It gives them just a little more kick and did indeed make my kitchen smell heavenly on this cold winter day! 

I like to try and "healthy up" treat recipes, so I made some small changes. First I substituted a cup of wheat flour for the white to get some more whole grain in there. Since wheat flour doesn't rise as well as white, I also added a half teaspoon more baking soda. Instead of the shortening I used unsweetened applesauce, which made the dough just a little too wet, so I added another eighth cup or so of wheat flour.
 
As per others' suggestions I soaked the raisins in some boiling water for a few minutes, and that made a big difference. Instead of getting all bitter and shrivelly, the raisins stayed plump and juicy. 

I also recommend flattening the cookie dough a bit when you drop it onto the baking sheet. I love that these cookies don't spread very much.

The finished product: moist, chewy, just barely crisp on the edges, and very very good. These are sure to be gobbled up by my family when they all get home this afternoon!

I used all butter instead of a combination of butter/shortening based on the other reviews. I also added dried cranberries to make them a little different. The tang was a nice contrast to the spicy/sweet. I do want to mention that I tried to make two sizes and discovered that smaller is absolutely better. They bake more evenly and are the perfect combination of soft and chewy. A little over teaspoon sized is what worked best for me (which is the size the recipe suggests). They were delicious and a huge hit at my office party! Great recipe!

I found that if you like your cookies to remain high rather than flat you need to add 1/2 cup more flour to this recipe.

Great recipe!!!  Texture is perfect.  They came out with a just little crispness on the outside and super soft and chewy on the inside.  I made a few changes (can't help myself)... I'm not too crazy about cloves so instead I used a couple pinches each of ground clove, nutmeg and allspice.  Also I made a Brown Butter Cinnamon Glaze to drizzle over the top.  It was 1/2 stick butter over medium heat until slightly browned, remove from heat and add 1 and 1/2 cups confectioners sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, cinnamon to taste (not much, maybe 1/8 to 1/4 tsp.) and about 2 tablespoons water (just enough to get it to drizzle consistency).  Then just drizzle over the cookies and let it harden.  YUM!!!

I modified this recipe quite a bit to make it a bit healthier. They still came out really good! I used 3/4 c. butter instead of the shortening, 1/2 wheat & 1/2 white flour, Splenda in place of sugar (I think I might do half real sugar next time. I like things on the sweeter side), 2 cups of Quaker old fashioned oats & 1 cup of Trader Joe's spiced pumpkin flax seed granola cereal (for added omega 3's & 6's and a tiny bit of crunch).

I like my cookies moist & a little softer so I baked them for only 10 mins and they came out perfect. I think these would be excellent with chocolate chips as well. 

They smell amazing.

This recipe was simply amazing! Everybody in my home enjoyed it and that includes my picky/"selective" cousin. It was gone in a matter of hours! Only slight variations were made: I used butter instead of shortening, I reduced the recipe to 18 servings, and I didn't add cloves. Despite these changes it was DELICIOUS! Even better than the ones sold in Publix or Winn-Dixie!

This recipe is not very good.  I read all of the reviews and was confident that this would be a good recipe, but it was not.  I like the clove and butter flavor shortening, but other than that it was not very good.  It needs more sugar.  It is almost exactly the same as the Quaker Oats recipe, but somehow not as good.  However, some of the cookies from this batch were frozen and upon thawing the clove flavor becomes amazing!

I made the recipe according to instruction the 1st time, and they had very good spice, but stuck to the baking sheet and were lacking the rich taste that butter provides.  On the second try, I substituted butter for all of the shortening, and they were superb.

This recipe is great!  I use regular shortening and omit the raisins (personal preference!) and they are so chewy and tasty!  I love the subtle spiciness of these cookies with a cup of mulled tea on a cold day :-)

I'm not sure what to think, the texture of the cookie is not what I was expecting. It came out moist and chewy, but it was more like a brittle texture. Hard to explain. After baking, I put the rest of the dough in the fridge to see if that would help, but it didn't. I probably won't make again, but they aren't bad.

Maybe something went wrong...but I didn't enjoy this recipe, and neither did my dad who loves oatmeal cookies. I followed it EXACTLY except i added a tiny bit more vanilla and a tad less white sugar. I don't think that would change it too much...Maybe It's my oven, i dunno, but these were disappointing =/.

These were delicious!  I made a couple changes to make them a little healthier and my family never knew the difference.  Instead of white flour I used soft white wheat and instead of plain oatmeal I used a 7-grain mix that has oatmeal, flaked rye, barley, etc.  This blend is heavier so I reduced the oats to 2 cups.  The cookies were fantastic.  Highly recommend them!

This recipe was great as written, however I made the following changes as recommended by others: I don't like shortning in my cookies so I used all butter. I also added 1/4 tsp ginger, an additional 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp nutmeg for a truly spicy oatmeal cookie. They were to die for. Couldn't stop eating them!!

I made this exactly as directed.  The taste was pretty good, but it didn't beat my grandma's toasted oatmeal cookies (uses sour milk & toasts the oatmeal first).  I also prefer the oatmeal cookie recipe on the Quaker Oats box.  If you want soft, add a slice of apple to the container when they start getting crisp.  (Grandma's tip)

I followed the recipe exactly. The cookies look delicious, but all I can taste is the shortening. I may try it again using only butter as some posters suggested but will definitely skip the shortening.

EXCELLENT! I lack the ability to be a great baker, so I don't bake many things, especially oatmeal cookies. They are my husbands favorite, but I don't make them because every time I have tried, they are hard as rocks. This recipe was something that even I can make. They turned out fantastic! The whole family loved them. They are soft, and chewy, and we love the great flavors. I did take some advice from previous reviews, and when my first batch came out a little flat, I added 1/2 teaspoon more of baking soda. I made more 48 hours later when they were all gone. This time I put in 2 teaspoons of baking soda, and love the thickness of the cookies, it's perfect for us. I also kept the dough in the fridge while baking each batch. Couldn't ask for a better tasting cookie! Thanks for the great recipe, that even the baking challenged can cook properly :).

Oh, yum.  I halved this recipe, knowing that it makes quite a deal more than the stated 36 cookies. Used all butter, and reduced the cloves to half. (I'll probably use the suggested amount next time!) I soaked the raisins in hot water to ensure that they'd remain juicy. Because these cookies will be quite flat otherwise, I'd recommend chilling the dough in between batches. At 350 F, my tablespoon sized balls took 10 minutes to be done. ( I like them on the softer side.) Made roughly 3 dozen, even after halving the recipe. This is one of the best cookies out there. So chewy!

I've never been a huge fan of oatmeal raisin cookies. However, my boyfriend loves them so I went on a search for the perfect recipie. My search ends with this one here. 
After a year of baking them, I've only changed a few things. I sift in a small package of vanilla instant pudding mix with the flour and increase the cloves to a 1/2 tsp (we like the spiciness!). I like chunkier cookies so increased the raisins to about 2 cups.
Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipie!

I've finally found an oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I'm thrilled with.  Nice crunch to the exterior with a chewy interior. As with other tinkerers, I made some slight changes.  I put in a splash of buttermilk (probably 1 - 2 Tbs.)and a serving teaspoonful of molasses.  Due to the added moisture, I added another 2 Tbs. flour.  For my family's tastes, I cut the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon and little sprinklings of cloves, nutmeg, and ginger for additional interest.  The next time I make these--and there will be one--I will increase the raisins to 1 1/2 cups.  I think any nuts, baking chips, candy, fruit, etc. would be wonderful.

I have followed this recipe a dozen times at least.  For the first time in my 50 years of baking, I am successful at baking delicious, chewy oatmeal raisin cookies.  No more bland, dry or flat/crisp oatmeal cookies.  My friends and family rave over these cookies. My best advice is to follow the recipe and do not over-bake.

awesome recipe. I also experimented with it mainly because of my son's allergies. I used 2/3 cup of coconut oil and 1/3 cup of shorting. I had to substitute the eggs so I used 2 tsp of ground flax soaked for 20 min in 4 tbsp of room temp water. It worked out perfectly!

These cookies are without a doubt  one the best and most fail safe cookie you will ever bake. Key to them being chewy is do NOT over bake them. 12 minutes at 350 is perfect.

Great recipe. I personally found the cloves a bit overpowering, next time I'll reduce it to 1/4 tsp. I also made half the batch with chocolate chips added in. Not as healthy, but delicious!

Cookies crumbed as soon as I took them off the pan, the 1st batch I thought I over cooked (baked 10 min) I did 9 the following batch and it was only a little better. I used all butter instead of half butter half shortening, otherwise used the same recipe. Taste was ok, not 5 star IMO. My husband and I both agree 1/2 tsp cloves is too much.

These are delicious!! (My go-to oatmeal cookie recipe from now on!) I used all butter (2 sticks) and added in some pumpkin pie spice (about 1/2 tsp.)...baked for 10 minutes and let set for about 5 minutes on the pan out of the oven - they are beautiful cookies and taste amazing! :)

If you love oatmeal raisin cookies, you have got to TRY this recipe!! By far, the best cookie I have ever baked.  Moist and chewy and just perfectly spiced. Everyone who has tasted them loves them ... asks for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing this one!!  All other oatmeal raisin cookie recipes have hit the trash can!  :O)

I really did not understand where the "spice" was in these to justify the title.  They really needed more cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg or ginger.  iI'm glad I tried these to compare but I think the recipe on the oatmeal container is better.

I'm not sure why I feel the need to add a review after over 1500 others have said how wonderful these cookies are, but I don't seem to be able to help myself!  I think it must have something to do with my inability to stop eating them once they are out of the oven...  This has become my husband's favorite "new" cookie! I will never go back to the recipe I have used for the last 30+ years.  I do add an additional 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, but that is just personal preference.  Just make them and you and your family will enjoy them.  They are so very delicious.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I used all butter because that is all I had on hand.  I also used pumpkin spice in place of the spices and chocolate chips for raisins.  Even without these changes these cookies would be so delicious.  I am surprised any got baked we loved the dough so much.  Thanks Beth!

Cookies came out too soft -- to the point of falling apart -- even though I followed the recipe to the letter (for once!). They're pretty good, but I think I'll try less shortening next time.

I don't bake very often but I needed to make some cookies for a gift and this recipe popped up on the top 20. Easiest recipe to follow and I also used 3/4 cup of butter instead of shortening and divided the dough into 3 and used dried cranberries, raisins and chocolate chips. turned out perfect! a touch soft when they came out of the oven but a few min to rest on the pan and then with a spatula over to a cooling rack and they were perfect!

These were great!! I cut the recipe down to 2 dozen...BIG MISTAKE.  They were sooo good, I might have to make them again soon. I didn't have the butter flavored shortening, so I just used all butter.  And my 5 y/o DD decided they would be good with carmel filled chocolate chips, boy was she right.  Also I didn't have any brown sugar so I used a more natural sugar called Rapadura (2/3 cup) and 1/3 cup white sugar. Also I wasn't sure if I could but I used quick cook oats and they were fine. I can't wait to share this at Bible Study tonight, if there are any left to take.  I can't keep my kids out of them.  Thanks for the recipe!  These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever.

These cookies were delicious! I had to bake mine for 14-15 minutes. I only used 1/4 tsp of ground cloves which was plenty and I also soaked the raisins which I never would have thought to do...it makes a huge difference in the texture of the cookies!

This was really good.  I used a medium-sized cookie scoop and came out with 3 dozen cookies exactly.  I didn't have any butter flavored shortening, so I used regular shortening and margarine.  I also ran out of raisins for the last batch, so I used craisins instead.  The ground cloves really add a whole lot to the depth of flavor.  Also, I would not recommend baking these for more than 9 minutes.  They may be super soft coming out of the oven, but they get a lot firmer the next day.  YUMMY!

This recipe is great! It's almost exactly the same as the recipe on the bottom of the oatmeal box lid, but the additional spices really make a difference! I cut down the cooking time a little... 9 minutes makes them a little chewier than 10-12. Great recipe!

This was an excellent recipe...and I didn't even make it right. When I got home i didn't have ground clove so I used plain cinnamon and nutmeg. The first thing my husband said when he walked in from work was " Wow, something smells really good". I can't wait to try it again but this time I will try it using the recipe as written.

I just love it when someone takes a recipe that has been a staple for years, changes it a bit, and comes up with a new favorite!  Good job, Beth! I doubled the cinnamon,added a bit more cloves, and used craisins.

If you omit the cloves and use two sticks of butter, you have the same recipe that is printed on the lid of the Quaker Oats oatmeal container.  Good, chewy recipe.

I made these word for word from the recipe. I have gotten nothing but rave reviews. One thing I would do is press them down on the cookie sheets next time. I left them balled and they turned into cookie nuggets because they didnt really change shape. So delicious. I also recommend adding more spices. The spices here were not overpowering and some people may like more to taste.

Today is 2 days after I made them and they're still soft.

Even though I was out of butter and had to use all shortening, I still loved these cookies. Not too sweet, and the texture was slightly chewy with a light crispness. I replaced the cloves with cardamom and nutmeg (personal preference), and I might increase the cinnamon next time--and I will make them again, using butter.

These cookies are tremendous!!  By far the best oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten.  I made them for Thanksgiving, and everybody in the family loved them, even those who aren't usually too keen on oatmeal cookies.  Don't change a thing about the recipe...it's perfect the way it is. :)

These are terrific.  Be sure not to overbake them.  I take them out just as the edges start to brown.  They should still be soft in the middle when they cool.  Be sure to soak the raisins in some warm water before mixing into the dough so that they plump up.  

I like the recipe as is, but I sometimes omit the cloves for a more traditional oatmeal raisin cookie.

Yum, yum, yummy!  I brought these in to work today and I don't think they lasted an hour! Changes I made: I used all butter instead of the butter/shortening combo, plumped up the raisins by soaking them in a bit of hot water first, and used quick cooking oats. Did I say yummy?  :-)

Well, it is certainly safe to say that I will NEVER use another oatmeal cookie recipe ever again! These cookies were absolutely delicious.  Not only have I never baked such amazing oatmeal cookies, but I don't think I've ever even TASTED such amazing oatmeal cookies!  I made the cookies less than 24 hours ago and they are all gone.  The texture/consistency was perfect - so soft and chewy - and the flavour was amazing (the 'spice' flavour from the cloves and cinammon was perfect).  I made a few minor changes - instead of using butter and butter flavoured shortening, I used all margarine (it was all I had on hand and it certainly didn't negatively affect the cookies), and I added more cinammon.  Also, I probably cooked the cookies for only 8 or so minutes because I hate overdone cookies and I like them to be extra soft.  Also, I scaled down the recipe to 24 servings, and yet I still made 33 medium sized cookies.  Next time I will NOT scale down the recipe because I will want to make more so they will last a bit longer!!  GREAT RECIPE!!!

Ok, I used all butter as another person recommended and it was WAY better than the 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening version.  The all butter batch held their shape better too.  EVERYONE loved these (even the kids).  Changes I made were pumpkin pie spice in place of spices and Golden Raisin's instead of regular.

This cookie recipe is so gooooood!!!! I added nutmeg, and black walnuts, and to keep them moist, added 1/2 box of instant vanilla pudding. (pudding added to drop cookies will keep them soft for a LONG time!)

I have made these, as the recipe stated, with butter-flavored shortening, and I've made them with butter only; and both my husband & I agree, they are much better with butter alone.  I also used pecans, and golden raisins (goldens stay softer and plumper).  I also added 1 tsp cardamom because I just love that spice.  These cookies were SO good!  I was craving oatmeal raisin cookies for weeks, and this did the trick.  It made just over 3 dozen; baked them day before yesterday and there are two left with 3 people in the household.  Guess who ate the most?  Uh-huh!  Me! :(  UPDATE 07/11/06: My mom used to make oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, so I used this recipe today for that, again using butter only, omitting the spices and adding 1c semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1c pecan halves.  SLURP!

This is one great cookie.  My son (14) doesn't like raisins, but he liked these cookies.  I didn't have the butter flavored shortening so I used another 1/2 cup of butter and they turned out terrific.  Thanks Beth!

These were as good as the recipe I've always used, and that's because it's the same one as is printed on the Quaker Oatmeal box.  The only difference is the cloves and butter-flavored shortening (which I don't use anyway).  Excellent cookie, and will be adding cloves now everytime!

These cookies are very good, they were gone fast.  Chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside - delicious!  Incidentally, this was the exact recipe on my box of oatmeal (minus the cloves).  I also omitted the cloves.  Already made two batches!

Beth, these cookies are so chewy and moist!  My husband took them to work and came home with requests for more from his co-workers!  Next time I think I'll substitue dried cranberries for the raisins.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled it and used 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of raisins. My 15 year old keeps grabbing cookies and shoving the whole thing in his mouth and running out of the kitchen....like I don't know what he is doing. Very Happy Boy! Thanks for this recipe! House smells amazing!

These are fantastic cookies. At 8 minutes, they were perfect so keep a close eye on them. I used all butter and chocolate chips instead of raisins. So good, still chewy the next day.

Love it! I dont like raisins so I used craisins instead and my family LOVED THEM!!! Everyone at work raves about how great they are.  **Helpful hint bake them right away, if you let the batter sit in the fridge covered it tends to dry out.

Absolutely wonderful!  How great to fine a recipe for these that is so good!  I didn't even have the butte-flavored shortening and they were still great, tho can't wait to try them with that, too.  I added pecans, just because we love pecans in cookies, but honestly, I don't think these cookies need anything extra to taste wonderful.  Was hesitant about the cloves, not something we're fond of, but I'm so glad I went ahead and added it -- wonderful flavor!

OMG!!!!!!!!!  These were outstanding.  Very dangerous.  I don't normally write reviews, but I couldn't help it with this one.  This is my second attempt at homemade cookies . . . my first attempt a couple of years ago failed miserably (think "rocks.").  Cookies have always intimidated me, but I chose this recipe to try again.  I gave it five stars, even though I followed the recipe except didn't use cloves (don't like the flavor) and added chocolate chips and walnuts.   Also, I used all butter.  They were great.  I realized when I had eaten 3/4 of the first batch by the next day I had to get rid of the rest of the dough.  I baked them up last night and brought to work.  They're already all gone and it's not even 11am yet.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very tasty and flavorful!  The only change I made was to leave out the raisins as we don't care for them in our oatmeal cookies.  We love the spiciness of this recipe.  Thank you Beth Sigworth for sharing your tasty and flavorful recipe!!

Follow the recipe as written. These are great cookies. As directed...do not over bake. Watch carefully and check them starting at about 8 or 9 minutes rather than just set the timer for 10 to 12. They may very well over bake and this five star cookie becomes a 1 star cookie. If over baked the flavor and wonderful chewy texture is lost. Also, soak the raisins first. Makes a world of difference.

This is an awesome oatmeal cookie! The only adjustment I made was that instead of using raisins, I used dark chocolate covered raisins. How can you go wrong by adding chocolate! This is definitely a keeper!

Good recipe.  I made it as written, except using all butter instead of the shortening.  I needed to bake them about 13 minutes.  For the people who gave this one star and said the cookies were mushy, there are several things to remember.  1. Let butter soften on the counter to room temperature.  Don't soften in the microwave.  2.Make sure you use rolled oats, not quick oats.
3.  Be sure to leave them on the tray for a little after getting them out of the oven as the directions specify.

These ARE good! I made a few adjustments since I was missing some items and I also was in the experimenting mood. I didn't have shortening or light brown sugar or cloves so instead I substituted them for butter, regular brown sugar, and nutmeg. I also used 1/2c raisins and 1/2c dried cranberries and I added 1/2c pecans.

Delicious recipe! thanks for sharing! After having read many reviews I decided not to alter anything but add only a tablespoon of thick natural honey. The result is amazing.  I placed the cookies onto baking paper covered cookie sheets in shape of balls. Beautiful chubby cookies!

YUM!!! I was craving oatmeal raisin cookies, and could not find my tried and true recipe anywhere. I am glad I stumbled upon this one. For my own personal taste, I bumped up the measurements of spices and raisins. To my chagrin I was out of vanilla.  I decided to add a couple Tblsp of molasses, which made these heavenly! I used all butter. The flavor and texture are SO good. Moist and chewy. Thanks for coming to the rescue of my cookie craving!!

I have tried many oatmeal cookie recipes, and this one is the best.  I believe it is the combination of half butter crisco (although it's not healthy, shortening makes the BEST cookies) and half butter or margarine.  The other step that seems to make them better is to add the raisins to the beaten eggs and vanilla and let them soak for about an hour.  Add after creaming the butter and shortening with the two sugars and then the flour mixture.  The raisins are "plump" in the finished cookie.

Oatmeal rasin cookies are one of my very favorite cookies! This recipe is the best I have tried! I doubled the recipe and used whole wheat flour and 1/2 to 1 cup less sugar than it calls for. Still great tasting and a little better for you!

this recipe has great flavor and i will surely make it again. the problem i had, many others had as well.  the cookies flatten out and become a mess.  a quick fix is to add another 1/2 cup of flour.  also, to add a little more texture, try using 2 cups quick oats and 1 cup whole oats. cook for 9 mins. is plenty.

Delish!  I gave it 4 stars as I did modify the recipe...added a little extra baking soda and a little baking powder after reading other reviews and eliminated the white sugar.  They came out the perfect texture and were plenty sweet with just the brown sugar!

I just made these for the first time and am so happy I did. They are delicious! I didn't have raisins so I used craisins instead plus I added some chopped almonds. I also used all butter instead of the shortening. Cooking times must vary because I decited to take some of the reviewers advice and cut the time down to 9-10 minutes. Those cookies we're undercooked. The last batch was left for 12 minutes and came out perfect. My husband has never liked oatmeal cookies and he's already had 3 of these.

I was looking at this recipe thinking bad thoughts because I have never liked oatmeal raisin cookies but then I thought, "how can over 1000 people be wrong?" so I decided about 20 minutes ago to make these and I'm in love. True story.

Wow! I have searched and searched for a perfect oatmeal raisin cookie recipe. My husband hates raisins and the only oatmeal cookie he likes are peanut butter no-bakes but he loved these. They didn't last long between him and my 2 & 4-year-olds. I doubled the recipe and instead of just cinnamon and cloves, I used 3tsp. cinnamon, 3/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves, 1/4 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp. allspice as spices. I used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. regular shortening. The lack of butter flavored shortening didn't hurt these at all. I also soaked my raisins in hot water first, this helped the cookie stay moist and chewy as well. I baked my cookies for 12 minutes otherwise they were still pale and doughy; at 12 minutes they were perfect and three days later, when the last one was eaten, it was still soft and chewy. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is very close to the "Vanishing Oatmeal Raisin Cookies" recipe off the lid of every canister of Quaker Oats, which I recognized because we have made these cookies almost every weekend in my house for years.  The ingredients are even in the same order.

The exception that makes this recipe stand apart is the addition of cloves.  They really add a wonderful spice, and I would never have thought of doing that.  In addition, I liked the half-n-half shortening/butter combination.  I have always replaced butter with butter-flavor shortening for this recipe because it makes them so gooey and chewy, but I think I do prefer it Beth's way.

Great ideas for tweaking what I have always considered to be the best oatmeal raisin cookie recipe anywhere.

What wonderful cookies!!!  To obtain the great "chewiness" here in Colorado at 7,000 feet, I used 2 Tblsp less sugar and baked the cookies @ 375 degrees for 10 minutes. People rave about these cookies

I love Oatmeal Raisin cookies and my mother always made the best until I tried these. 
I have made some minor modifications which work really well for me.
1. I use DARK brown sugar since the molasses helps keep the cookies moist.
2. Maybe it's my oven but I cook them a little longer than the original recipe (OR).
3. I have found that the butter flavored shortening works better than all butter. Maybe a food chemist can explain why.
4. I increased the amount of cloves to a full teaspoon. Makes the house smell like Christmas, even in July!
5. Make sure the raisins are separated. If they are fresh, they will clump together.
6. I combine all dry ingredients first by putting them in a used butter tub or similar large container and shaking it hard and fast in order to get everything coated well.
7. then I combine the wet ingredients (including the brown sugar because of the molasses) and mix them until they are totally smooth.
8. I also use a cooking stone. If you don't have one, they are great for baking.

By far the best soft oatmeal cookie ever! I've tried a lot of oatmeal cookie recipes over the years looking for one that stays soft, isn't more like cake than cookie, isn't so dry that it stays heaped up in a little ball during baking, yet doesn't flatten out too much causing the edges to be thin and crispy. When I first read the ingredients, I wasn't too sure about adding the cloves since I'm not a real big fan of that spice - it can be strong and overpowering. But I decided to try the recipe as is on the first batch. Beth's oatmeal cookies are perfect. I've received so many compliments. I will definitely make these again. I used a pre-heated baking stone; baked the cookies for 11 minutes; pulled the batch out of the oven and let the cookies sit for two minutes on the stone before removing them to a cooling rack. Using a size 50 mini ice cream scooper yielded 4 dozen cookies.

Exceptional!  I needed to make several dozen cookies fast so I whipped up a batch of these cookies and pressed them into a greased, foil-lined 9x13 inch pan.  Decrease the temp by 25º and cook approx. 20 minutes (until golden brown).  Cool completely before removing from pan.  Cut into squares and enjoy!

I like a little more spice... next time I'll be more generous with the cinnamon, and maybe add some ginger too for extra kick.  I used old fashioned oats instead of quick or rolled oats, and this was a mistake, but otherwise really good cookies.

These were very nice. I only used canola oil instead of the butter flavored shortening and Splenda instead of white sugar. Very good cookies.

This recipe IS good but it is not the final word on oatmeal raisin cookies.  My family enjoyed it for variety but we have another favorite.  We used 3/4 cup butter instead of shortening for health reasons, so perhaps that is what keeps it from being the best (though we NEVER use shortening for anything).  The cookies were nice and soft and chewy and the spices lend an "interesting" flavor- as my two year old says.

I made up a very large batch of these to send with my husband to work one day for a potluck lunch and he says they were gone before he even got one! I've had similar results in the house. Everyone loves these. All I ever have is whole cloves so I crush between 6-8 to get the 1 tsp (for doubled batch) using a mortar & pestle. Great recipe. Thanks!

I hate raisins, but I LOVED THESE COOKIES! I make them for my husband, and when I gave them a try I couldn't believe how good they were! I didn't have any cloves so I left out the cinnamon and made up the difference with pumpkin pie spice. Chewy, moist, sweet and PERFECT. Will never try another Oatmeal raisin cookie recipe again. This one's a keeper!

If I could, I would give this recipe even more than five stars. These were the best cookies I've ever eaten in my life. I love them even more than Costco's cookies, which I thought were the ultimate best you could ever get. The only change I made was I added about a teaspoon of nutmeg along with the cloves and cinnamon. THEY WERE THE BEST COOKIES EVER!!!

Really good.  Smell awesome, taste even better.  I followed several of the other reviews and used whole wheat flour.  Ground it myself, it was even a little gritty, and these still turned out to die for.  I like the flavor of the whole wheat flour, it goes really good with the oats and spices.

These cookies were awesome. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and I only had 1/2 cup raisins so I added  1 cup of shredded coconut. Even using rounded teaspoons this recipe made 87 cookies- thats a whole lot more than 3 dozen!

This is a good, standard oatmeal cooky that is heavy on the cloves. I've baked it three times now to see what the fuss is about, and I can't see it. A good recipe, not great.

Heh.. I'm changing my review and rating b/c I made this recipe without the butter (found it in the microwave after the cookies were done)... oops! They still had wonderful flavor, just the texture was different. I also made them w/o raisins, but it was fine! More cake-like texture than the Quaker recipe. I think I may just stick to the dense Quaker Oats recipe and add the same spices. Thanks anyhow!

Awesome cookie! To the person who had oatmeal madness falling apart that didn't set up like a cookie, I added 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 of baking soda with extra cinnamon and it was great...hope that helps someone.

This is an amazing recipe...it's definitely a keeper.  I doubled the recipe and made four different kinds, and all of them were delicious!  I made plain raisin, raisin with walnuts, plain chocolate chips, and chocolate chips with walnuts.  They were a big hit in my family!

This receipe was easy to prepare. I didn't have butter flavored shortening, so I used just regular shortening. The cookies stayed moist and soft. The cloves gave the cookies a down home taste. Thanks Beth for the receipe.

Wow, these are great!  The perfect blend of crispy outside and chewy inside. I followed the recipe as directed with one exception.  I don't like biting into whole cooked raisins (personal preference) I boiled and plumped 3/4 cup raisins, drained them and then processed them in the food processor with the butter and sugar mixture. Then I proceeded with the recipe as directed.  My friends wolfed the whole batch down in a couple of minutes!

Wonderful recipe!  I did tweek it a little though.  I added 1/2 cup of apple sauce because I did not have any shortening.  I also added 1/4 t. pumpkin spice, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1/4 t. ginger, 1/2 t. cinnamon and I omitted the cloves because I didn't have any on hand.  I will definitely make these again.  They were moist and flavorful.

These are absolutely delicious!!! I made them and they were an immediate favorite around here.  I went with the suggestions from other users and lessened the cooking time to about 8 minutes and added a lil extra cinnamon and some nutmeg.  Also, used all butter instead of shortening!  These are great! I am so glad I found this recipe!!!

These cookies were a big hit.  The only criticism I got from my "taste-testers" was that they wanted more raisins!  The spice was just right and they were nice and chewy even after they cooled.

I used all butter (unsalted) and added an additional 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and a shake more cinnamon. I also soaked the raisins before adding to the cookie dough.  I scooped out the cookies onto a large baking sheet and refrigerated the dough until well chilled.  As each batch was baking, the rest remained in the fridge.  This resulted in a nice thick cookie, just the way my daughter likes them.  This has become her new favorite cookie.  Thanks Beth!

I made these for a cookie swap and they were very popular. They are my husband's favorite cookies. I like to use chocolate covered raisins, they make the recipe totally outstanding.

Man, Mrs. Sigworth can sure make some cookies! These are fabulous, I've been looking for a chewy/crispy-edged oatmeal cookie for a while now, and my search is over!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening, but they tasted fine with regular shortening.  I thought the spices were great, but obviously, if you're not a fan of spices you may want to decrease the amt. but I love them as is. I used currants soaked in brandy instead of raisins (since I didn't have any and my b/f loathes raisins) which was pretty good. Altough my b/f made me promise to make them without raisins/currants next time. I'd like to try them with golden raisins and some coconut or nuts...the possibilities are endless. But instead I must try Beth's choc. chip cookies!! (Beth's snickerdoodles are the best cookies I've ever made!!!) Thanks again, Beth!  Add more recipes!!!

These were wonderful!  My husband does not like raisins so I substituted Hershey's cinnamon chips. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I cooked them on a Pampered Chef stone and the first couple of batches took 10 minutes, the rest 8. Beth is correct - these smell heavenly and taste divine!

Very good.  Love the cloves. I had to bake them a little longer but keep an eye on them. I sifted my flour and had to add a little more because the first batch whent flat. The added flour perked them up. I made a double batch and froze the rest. Easy to make and good spoon lickin.

Thanks Beth! This is a very good recipe and the cloves really make a difference. I used Blue Bonnet margerine and they came out very soft and chewy. Also to keep them that way, I always put a slice of bread in my cookie jar with the cookies.

Great cookie!  I used regular shorting and cut back a bit on the fat and sugar by lowering the butter and sugar slightly.  I also used craisins instead of raisins for a nice twist. They tasted great and would recommend them.

Thank you so much for this recipe Beth.  I've never liked oatmeal cookies before now, but boy, now I'm a changed woman.  These cookies were excellent!!  I made a batch this morning.  Before adding any raisins I divided the dough in half and followed the original recipe with raisins for half the dough.  With the rest I added a generous amount of Hershey's cinnamon chips and they tasted heavenly!  The next batch I make I'll use raisins and cinnamon chips together!

I tried this recipe the other day and 
they are the best oatmeal/raisin cookies 
I have ever tasted. They remind me of my 
grandmother.I didn't have butter flavored
shortning so I just used all margarine.
They didn't even last a day!

This is a tale of my night, pieced together from my friends, and the contents of my counter this morning.
Last night, I was a great many things; sober not among them.
I admit, I did some drinking. I had had a very bad day. My fiancé was upset with me, and I was feeling like  when I should have been ecstatic. Not fun.
I had used this recipe before, and I enjoyed the cookies, but I'm not much of a reviewer. Last night, however, was bake night. I used to work in a bakery, and ever since I had to quit (surgery), I have had some friends over once a month for bake night. When my friends arrived, I suddenly realized what night it was. I don't remember much of the night, but this recipe was up, and I clearly used it, so here is what I know:
A glaze drizzle was involved. I know that I used straight cream at first. Must have had to thin it out. I tasted what was left in the fridge and dark rum is the prime suspect.
Chocolate and beer were added. Friend saw me add beer; I can't imagine adding enough to make the cookies as dark as they turned out.
Currants instead of raisins. That's for sure.
There's Irish cream in either the glaze or cookies; apparently I poured myself a glass and I HATE Irish cream, but will never waste booze.
LOTS of spice. They are almost hot from the cinnamon.
Ginger?
On my counter are the following: apricot nectar, pineapple juice, Coke, pear vodka, tequila, rum, and Like a Sir e-juice. Any or all of them may have made it into the cookies. Delicious, though.

I had a HUGE bag of oats that I needed to use up, so I found this recipe with all the rave reviews (love you, Allrecipes.com!!).  I didn't have the butter-flavored shortening, so I just added another stick of butter.  These cookies are wonderful!!  Not only in taste, but in texture:  they have that lightly crispy outside and chewy inside.  Heaven!  Just calls for a fresh cup of coffee, hot tea, or cold glass of milk.  (Listened to Traveling Wilburys while baking these).  :)

Made according to recipe except added an extra half cup of raisins.  Great texture and beautiful appearance.  Just too much cloves for me.  I am softening another half cup of butter on the counter to make another batch and cut the cloves to one quarter teaspoon.  I am a personal chef and my son's teacher wanted me to make him some oatmeal raisin cookies.  I just can't send this first batch to school with my son.  The overpowering cloves made me cough. I believe with that small modification this will make a very delightful oatmeal raisin cookie.  I think the amount of cloves is just a matter of personal preference.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

We thought these were GREAT oatmeal raisin cookies. This is now my official Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using regular shortening instead of butter-flavored shortening and quicks oats instead of regular rolled. (It's what I had on hand.) I always use my Pampered Chef cookie scoop when making cookies. I used the small scoop (1 tbsp) for the first batch which made small cookies; about 2 bites and required a 10 min baking time. Then for the rest I used my medium scoop (2 tbsp) and this made nice BIG cookies. I preferred them. They needed to bake 14 min and I flattened them slightly by pressing on them with my fingers before putting them in the oven to bake.  I ended up with 4 dozen cookies.

These cookies are so good I cannot stop eating them!
I read reviews and did some tweaking...I used 1 cup of butter as I did not have the butter flavoured shortening. I omitted the white sugar all together and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I soaked my raisins in boiling water as I prepped everything and this made them plump and soft. 
I used my medium size scoop for the dough and flattened them slightly. I baked them for the full 12 minutes as they were thick and they are amazingly moist!
Honestly this is the best oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever had and I am trying really hard to leave some for the rest of the family!

Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine b/c that was what I had.  Had to bake for 17-18 min @ 350 for them to get slightly brown.  They were delicious! Also, slightly crunchy on the outside, but soft & moist even after they cooled.  I made Lg cookies (10-12/pan).  Maybe our ovens are really this different. :)

I used quick oats and the Pampered Chef 1.5" cookie scoop. Baking time was 10 minutes. The second batch I tried with steel cut oats, but that didn't work, so I'll stick with quick or rolled oats.

Mmmmm.  Writing this review as I stand in my kitchen, with a lovely cup of herbal tea and a couple of these amazing cookies by my side.  Not too sweet, perfect spiciness ... this could be a problem.  I made them for my daughter (who comes home from college tomorrow for a week) and I am thinking that there will be fewer for her than originally planned.  I've been looking for tasty cookies to send to the cadets at USCGA for the day room before the holidays - these are easy, tasty, and I see many dozen on their way to appreciative cadets in the near future.  THANK YOU, BETH!!!

I FINALLY got around to making these, and yikes, I've already eaten 7 of them! I think the flavor is delicious; I personally love the cloves in this recipe. IMO, they are plenty sweet (and I even reduced the white sugar to 1/4c.). I also used all butter. They did turn out quite thin and flat but when fully cooled are a great chewy texture with a slight crispness to the edges. I used a TBS sized cookie scoop and baked for exactly 11 min.

This is a keeper! I did make some changes out of necessity such as using pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and cloves and added 8 oz of chocolate chips because they were there. The cookies turned out moist and flavorful. This will be the only recipe I use when I need to make oatmeal raisin cookies. Thank you Beth!

I am waiting for the last batch of these to come out of the oven. My apt. smells like Treats Cookie Shops used too at the mall in the morning. It is a very distinct smell that brings back childhood memories. I am sure it is the cloves that really gives it the character. This is a very good cookie. If made properly no one should be disappointed! Great with coffee or tea.

I baked 11 minuttes, but the cookies were big.  I used all butter.  I doubled the recipe.  I used cinnamon butter for a half of a cup, don't know if it made a difference.  I used 3 jumbo eggs(its what I had on hand)  These turned out great, repeatable.

These cookies are spicy, hence the name. Lots of clove. They came out crispy around the edges and chewy in the center. Used golden raisins. Soaked the raisins in vanilla extract to plump them up. For me, the cookies did take the 10-12 mins to bake however I strongly suggest watching them carefully after 8. The cookies are done when the top is no longer wet and the edges are slightly brown. They quickly go from perfectly baked to overdone.

Gorgeous decadent chewy cookie with just the right amount of spice.  Perfect for the winter months!  I followed the recipe exactly (oh other than using all butter, just hate shortening).  Will certainly be making these again...

WARNING!!!!!  When you try to eat these off of the pan, because they smell so good you will burn the roof of your mouth and neck hole so freakin bad that you will quickly find religion!!!!  I used pumpkin pie spice, because I did not have cloves, and I was not disappointed.

I also put the cookies too close together (I am a new baker) so they made several big cookies.  Actually, this is not a bad thing if you are on a diet and limiting yourself to only "1" cookie.

These are so good they are addictive, good luck!  Thanks for the love handles Beth!

Very good texture and flavor. I subbed 1/2 c. wheat flour and 1 c. AP flour, as I am trying to incorporate more whole wheat flour in all of my baking. I left out the raisins and added chopped walnuts in their place. I will definitely make these again

These are making the house smell so good! The spices are great-I put in a little more cinnamon,couldn't find any cloves, but that will appear in future makings of this recipe. Might have to make a ssecond batch soon as most of these are going out to the neighbors as gifts.

This is a good basic oatmeal cookie with spices. I had to change it up a bit. First I can't have that much clove so I cut it in half.  I love the taste of cinnamon and vanilla so I doubled those amounts.  Make sure you fold in the oatmeal as it simply isn't as good if you beat it with a blender. It crumbles up the oats until they are fine and it is not a good consistency.  I added chopped walnuts to mine. About 1 cup and they came out delicious though I often make them without nuts.

Ok you have to make a double batch of these. I have added coconut, peanut chips, butterscotch chips, chocolate chips and M&M's to this recipe different times. If you are looking for a great base recipe for oatmeal cookies this is it!!! I follow the directions every time and don't vary any of the base but love to add different things. This is a keeper folks!

I soaked my raisins in hot warter for about 30 minutes.  I had a mix of rolled and quick oats.  I was baking with kids and the cloves got doubled...sorta, and it gave the cookies an even richer spice taste.  They came out perfect.

This is a great cookie.....chewy and delicious.  My family doesn't like raisins so I added chocolate chips instead. I didn't have ground cloves so I added a little nutmeg instead.  Super!

STOP RIGHT HERE. You need look no further for an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie recipe. It is by the best with a couple of additions. I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 2 teaspoons of Nutmeg, 2.5 teaspoons of ALLSPICE. HOLY SMOKES the 1 and 2 batch were gone before I had a chance to put them on the cookie rack to cool. EVERYONE in the house was tummy happy

So I decided to change things up a bit for Christmas. Beth's Spicy Oatmeal Raisin cookies. I was thinking about pine trees and egg nog and then I started thinking about cinnamon, which somehow made me start thinking about oatmeal although I don't see any connection on that last part..  The whole process was fairly straight forward. We didn't use shortening, and substituted with only butter. We also decided to make 2 flavors!:   1) Oatmeal Raisin  2) White Chocolate Walnut Oatmeal Raisin  These cookies really spread out when you start baking so make sure you give them room or they will combine with the adjacent cookie and result in a complex phenomena called "cookie-neighboring".    The cookies were slightly soft after baking, but the following day they were crispy at the edges and chewy in the center. I firmly believe the taste had improved after waiting a day. We liked both flavors but agreed the traditional Oatmeal Raisin flavor was better, and went fantastic with a Starbucks Latte.   Next time, I would use slightly less sugar, maybe a 1/4 cup of granulated sugar than 1/2 cup. And I would add more raisins! I hear if  you soak the raisins in boiling water they will become more plump and moist! I'll have to implement that as well. All in all, a great recipe and appropriate for the holidays. BAKE OR DIE!

These were absolutely incredible.  I didn't have any cloves on hand, so I omitted them.  I added a little extra cinnamon, as well as a dash of both ginger and nutmeg.  I used all butter. I boiled my raisins until they were plump prior to adding them to the mix.  I forgot to dust them in flour to dry them a little, and therefore my cookies wouldn't stay together due to being too moist (No one seemed to mind, as they disappeared before my eyes!). I also used the cinnamon "glaze" (more like an icing, really) which totally topped it off.  Note:  They will NOT look done after 9-10 minutes. They'll be puffy and still light.  Take them out, they will flatten and look like oatmeal raisin cookies once they're cool. :o)  My boyfriend and I are making them again this weekend!

I know that this recipe doesn't need any more reviews, but I just wanted to say that, like others, this is the best oatmeal cookie I think I've ever eaten. I found the cinnamon and cloves very pleasing and not overpowering at all like some thought. I followed the recipe to the letter and wouldn't change a thing. I doubled the recipe so that I could give cookies for gifts this Christmas (but you'd better have a very large bowl!). I'll be honest with you, I thought that the original recipe for 36 cookies would be for little tiny cookies but to my surprise, I made them about 3 inches in diameter and there was plenty of cookie dough for 36 cookies. Now I have oatmeal cookies coming out of my ears! I'll freeze some, give some as gifts and of course EAT lots. They are good for breakfast - like a quick bowl of oatmeal cereal right in a cookie! THANK YOU for sharing this recipe!

Okay, at 35 yrs old I am JUST learning to cook beyond the microwave, so mistakes are likely.  FIRST LESSON: I forgot the flour (how does THAT happen!?!) and found a sticky oozing mess when I checked the first batch.  SECOND LESSON: the recipe does not specify (for us beginners) to use salted or unsalted butter. I used salted and the additional salt. My suggestion to others like me who do not know better is to use one or the other, not both. THIRD LESSON: This recipe is a little sweet for me (it tastes "store bought" sweet) so I may try to cut back the sugar next time.  FOURTH LESSON: Cutting back the baking time to about 10 minutes saved me from hard cookies, but now I find them chewy.  ADDITIONS: 1/4 tsp Cardamom for depth to the spicy flavor.  YUMMY even if a tad salty and chewy!

(6)Yes. These are a good cookie. If you omitted the cloves and used butter, you'd have a clone of another well-known cookie. TIP: When I made oatmeal raisin cookies, I will sometimes use a dried mixed berry blend or dried cranberries in place of the raisins. For plumper raisins, soak them in hot water/juice for about 45 minutes and drain well before adding them to your cookie dough.

Best Oatmeal Cookies I've ever made. I only used ½ cup butter for this recipe and omitted the shortening.  I wanted a healthy cookie for my family to snack on and I found one!

I happened to thoroughly enjoy this recipe just as written, whether or not it came from a Quaker Oats package. I believe that recipes should not be reviewed if someone is going to tweak the recipe or, as I have seen many times, include their own recipe in their review! If you create your own recipe using this as a base recipe, then post it elsewhere, please! I do appreciate this recipe very much Beth. Oatmeal Raisin cookies are my absolute favorite and this recipe was just top notch! I really wish I could have rated it at more than 5 stars because it would have been well deserved. I will be passing this recipe on to all cookie lovers that I know!

These were the greatest. I've been looking for a good oatmeal cookie for past month. I've tried four other recipes but this is the one that makes the perfect cookie for me. I left out the cloves but added a bit more cinnamon. I used a half teaspoon instead of a teaspoon for a perfect size cookie for snacking. I also used all stick margarine  for the fat. Still came out great and flavorful.

This is a GREAT moist & chewy cookie! I only changed a few  things. I added a small box of instant vanilla pudding,  increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons, increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons, omitted the cloves BUT added about 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg & omitted the raisins. Baked 9-10 min.

One word:  ADDICTIVE!

I love oatmeal raisin cookies and I was very pleased how these came out.  I baked them for some friends who came over and they were gone within a few hours.  Very good indeed!  Will definitely make again.

This is a review for my "healthy" version of these cookies. I took some pointers from other posts and then changed a few things on top of that to make these healthy. I'm sure this version pales in comparison to the original but since I have not tried the original I was happy with the results. Here are my changes: Substitute applesauce for butter and shortening, only used half of the amounts of the brown and white sugars, 1/2 c. egg beaters instead of eggs, whole wheat flour instead of white, additional 1/2 tsp. baking soda, additional 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. allspice, omitted cloves, added a package of sugar free vanilla pudding, brought water to a boil and added a splash of vanilla and then added the raisins and covered so they were nice and juicy and finally I sprayed my cookie sheets with cooking spray to prevent sticking. I baked them for 9 minutes and was very happy with the results.  I calculated these to be 1 Weight Watchers point each!

I am JUST starting to learn how to cook and bake. Have totally botched a few recipes so far, (what, you can't substitude baking soda for baking powder?) :)
But I tried out this recipe, and OH MY GOSH. These cookies are AMAZING! So easy, and came out perfect!! I didn't alter the recipe at all, and I got so many compliments! My new hubby took them to work, and everyone was raving!
I will definitely make these again!

These are wonderful! I make them all the time for my husband. I always double the spices since these are pretty mild otherwise. I usually make a big batch of dough and keep it in a covered container in the fridge. They store well and my husband gets fresh cookies whenever he wants. Thank you so much for sharing... we LOVE them!!

I have tried many oatmeal raisin cookie recipes and always come back to this one.  I usually add a few more raisins and little extra cinnamon and it makes the best cookies ever.

This is a very good recipe.  A tad similar to the one found on the quaker oatmeal box.  I used all butter,omitted the cloves out of personal preference and soaked the raisin in 1 cup of boiling water.  I did not have any problems and they were delicious and chewy. Having made the quaker recipe it is recommended not to overbeat the ingredients because it seems to make them more cake like.

I also took other reviewers advice, I did use 1/4 c butter flavored Crisco with 1/2 stick of butter,& bumped up the cinnamon an additional 1/2 tsp, along with 1/2 tsp allspice. Next time I will also add 1/4 tsp of cloves as it still could use a touch more spice. I added 3-1.5 oz boxes of raisens which I plumped up with hot water. Overall I think this recipe with the changes, makes for a GREAT tasting oatmeal cookie.

This recipe is almost identical to the quaker oats recipe so I am not sure what all the fuss is about.  To be honest with my end results I can't tell the difference between the two recipes except for maybe the addition of the cloves in this one.  But anyway, it is a good recipe.  If you have tried the quaker recipe and like that one you will most likely like this one too.

A very versatile oatmeal cookie dough.  Like many reviewers I used butter only.  I also used Craraisins instead of raisins as I didn't have any raisins, also added 1/2 cup of toasted chopped almonds and doubled all the spices and added nutmeg but that's just my personal taste.

I used butter instead of shortening and added ground nutmeg to the dough. Some cookie doughs improve after putting them in the fridge but I found that these cookies are best with fresh cookie dough. Very delicious! I will definitely make them again.

I used all butter instead of 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening.  If you go with this modification be prepared to add a little more flour (add 1/8 to 1/4 c).  Before I added the additional flour the cookies flattened out a little more than what I wanted.  The flavor is excellent and they were gone quickly.  This recipe is absolutely a keeper!

These were WONDERFUL cookies! I didn't have all of the items on hand (it happens when you're broke!) so I substituted a few items. I will list them just in case anyone else is in my boat :)   I did not add vanilla since I did not have any, I also doubled the cinnamon and per posters I added 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I also did not use cloves since I did not have any. I used a whole cup of butter and omitted the shortening, and finally, I did not have "rolled oats" so I just used packed instant oatmeal. It took about 6 packets of Cinnamon & Spice instant oatmeal to equal 3 cups. I was a little uneasy about it but they turned out wonderful! I was able to roll the dough around in my hand to make little balls and I cooked it like that. BEAUTIFUL!

Great cookies. However, this is exactly the same as the recipe on the QUAKER OATS box except for the shortening (instead of butter) and the cloves. I made this recipe using butter instead of shortening before I saw the QUAKER OATS recipe. Very good cookies. Still moist  and chewey two days later! Don't know about day three because they were all gone by then.

I have to tell you, I did not understand what could be so special about this recipe to get so many rave reviews. I mean, sheesh, it is just an Oatmeal cookie and believe me I second guessed my decision to make the cookie when the cost of the ground cloves was $6.99 for the half tsp needed for the recipe BUT it was well worth it! Even my 8 year old who said yuck Oatmeal!! I am not gonna eat those... well after they came out of the oven, he was the first to try and enjoyed them very much!!

Thank you for sharing this special recipe that may look like the run of the mill Oatmeal cookie BUT is CERTAINLY NOT!!

LOVED THESE!!! I think that the cloves really made the difference in this recipe...made the house smell great and added a good flavor to the cookies. This recipe works well with craisins (dried cranberries) too. Perfect mix of chewy and crispy. One word of warning, though...make sure not to overcook the cookies. They don't look like they are done after 11 minutes, but if you cook them longer, they get overcooked. Just wait the two minutes before taking them off of the cookie sheet and they will be fine!

These were pretty good.  We don't have shortening in New Zealand so I just used all butter.  I also added chocolate chips.  They turned out good and everyone liked them.

These are fabulous!! I made a batch of 18 - which came out to about 25. With a few alterations these turned out fantastic. I upped the cinnamon, added allspice, nutmeg, and a little bit of vanilla pudding dry mix (to keep moist. I found some Sunsweet jumbo red raisins which were already juicy and plump and needed no hot-water soak. Let me just say that I absolutely hate cookies. Never have I liked a cookie or even desired to have a cookie. The only reason I made these is because my dad loves oatmeal raisin. Well after a small taste-test my life had changed! The cloves make this cookie, loved every bite.

These are SUPER tasty.  I completely omitted the white sugar and only used the 1 cup of brown and they were still VERY sweet.  I also used only whole wheat flour in place of the white flour.  This is a much healthier alternative and the raisins still make them sweet and tasty!  I bake at 350 for only 8 minutes and they were PERFECT!  This recipe makes a TON of cookies so you might want to cut the recipe in half if you have a small family.

Well, I must say these are the only oatmeal cookies I have ever really loved! The cloves really make this recipe what it is. I threw in a package of instant vanilla pudding (to keep the insides nice and moist) and added about a half cup more raisins than called for. Yum!

I just baked a batch of these this morning and they are very good!  Someone else had reviewed them as the same cookie from the Quaker Oats can.  They are!("Vanishing Oatmeal Raisin Cookies").  They only difference is that Beth's recipe uses 1/2 C. butter and 1/2 C. butter flavored shortening (instead of 1 C. butter).

OH MY GOSH these are good cookies!  My 2 1/2 year old and 4 year old are actually eating oatmeal!  Thank you thank you thank you!  I substituted the 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening with 1 cup of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray, used Splenda instead of sugar, and used 4 egg whites intead of 2 eggs and they are soft and chewy and deliciousously sinful!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Super delish. The recipe is a little sweet for me so I may need to cut the sugar next time and the cookies fell apart a bit so I should probably let them stay a liiiitle longer(cut the time based on a recommendation). I like that they are soft though so maybe I will just make them small (the bigger they are, the harder they are to pick up) and keep the time the same. Either way the recipe is a winner. Thanks Beth

These cookies came out perfect! I didn't have any shortening, so I used 1/2 cup of butter, and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil. I baked them for 9 minutes, and they had the perfect chewyness. My mother said these tasted exactly like her mother used to make, so it brought back some good memories for her. Thank you!

phenomenal!
i changed this bit: instead of butter + shortening, i used 1 cup smart balance. "top off" (add a little more) light brown sugar, and a little less white sugar. and i cheat on the cinnamon too, adding a little more. 4 cups oats (i just eyeball it to see if it should need more. definitely more than 3 cups). 2 cups raisins (eyeball, more than 1 cup).

This is the same recipe that I get from the underside of the lid of the Quaker Old Fashioned Oat Meal and have been using for years and years. I use ALL Crisco and add about 1/2 tsp. extra of cinnamon. I bake for only 9 mins. and let the heat finish baking them once they are out of the oven. This way they are big and puffy and soft but do not fall apart. The best cookies ever!

Beth, my favorite cookie recipe used to be your Snickerdoodles, but these are just superb!  I have made them 3 times this month with a few small additions - walnuts and chocolate/white chocolate chips and a little more cinnamon.  Keep up the great work in your cookie kitchen!

Thank You! This is a great recipe. I too had subtle substitutions as follows: 1C "Smart Balance" in lieu of butter and shortening, increased the amount of spices and added allspice, boiled the raisins and added 1/4C. more flour and juice from boiling raisins. Made for juicy raisins...Yumm!

Just wonderful! I omitted the raisins and otherwise made exactly to recipe. Using airbake cookie sheets I baked them for 10 minutes, using regular cookie sheets I baked them for 9 minutes. I used parchment paper. Thanks for the post.

This recipe is the best! The only change I made was to substitute a freshly ground teaspoon of Allspice for the cloves, since that was all I had in my cupboard. Excellent cookies! Be careful not to overbake though.

This recipe is the same as the one inside the lid of the oatmeal container with the addition of ground cloves. I used all butter and also added 1/4tsp each of nutmeg and all spice.

We made two oatmeal cookie recipes and the other one was better than this one. This recipe is still good. I would use it again but add nuts and double the cloves.

I omitted the cloves because I didn't have any. I had to add extra raisins and cinnamon. They turned out very good! They were chewy and very cinnamony. I took them to my coworkers on a Friday and I brought my empty cookie tin home the very next day. :) I'll definitely make these again sometime.

Just made these, and they are superb!  Definitely the best home-made oatmeal cookie recipe I've tasted.  I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavored Crisco, and no problems with spreading.  Did not use cloves, but added extra cinnamon, some nutmeg and ginger, as other people suggested...perfect.    Cookies are crispy and soft at the same time.  Will  absolutely make these again.

Used all butter instead of shortening. Definitely refrigerate the batter prior to baking to prevent spreading.  This will allow the cookies to cook uniformly.

Great flavor!  I did double the amount of cinnamon and clove as others suggested.  I always try a test batch with cookies, and if they come out too flat I just add more flour.  That what I did with these, and it worked out well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The flavour I thought was very nice. But I could see how some would want it more spicy. I have a couple of suggestions 1. use all shortening. Yeas I did just say that. 2.Use Quaker rolled oats brand and3. do not bake on convection. If you follow these instructions your cookies wont be so flat. Other then that they were great!

un-remarkable.  I made 72 cookies (doubled recipe) to take to a company cookie exchange.  I did not get any compliments.  The dough tasted great raw but the cookie was lacking.  I would double the cinnamon and cloves next time if I made again.  I also had trouble getting the baking time right.  10 minutes seemed under-done and they were too gooey (not just soft) they were raw in the middle but if I let them cook longer they got too done.  They were edible but not delicious like I was hoping they would be.  Sorry :(

These are some of the best cookies I've ever had. I made 2 very minor changes to the recipe. I soaked my raisins in hot water for about 10 min first and I also used quick oats instead of rolled because that was all i had. My whole family thought these were fabulous.

This in one of the best recipes for oatmeal rasin cookies I have tried.  Keep to the original recipe and you will not be disappointed.  They had a great flavor and stayed moist and soft after they cooled.  Even after I over baked a batch.

I just made these cookies and despite not having the proper rolled out they came out pretty good.  I omitted the 1/2 cup of white sugar, BAD IDEA! I should of left it in they ended up being too bland.  Besides that, I switched to 1 cup of butter and added 1/2 tsp. extra baking soda.  I'm going to try doing them with all the sugar and the rolled outs and if they turn out well I will be doing them for Christmas =)

This is the same recipe on the Quaker Oatmeal box top. The only differance is the addition of cloves. I used butter instead of shortening. The texture was soft and chewy but we thought it was a bit blande.  Will add more spices the next time. I also soaked my raisins to plump them. Even though they didn't seem to have much flavor we couldn't stop eating them.

I don't understand why these get rave reviews???  The texture was soft yes, but very chewy and crumbly, and not cookie like at all. Maybe would make a better granola bar?  I used old fashioned rolled oats, (as I do in my regular recipe), and maybe it should have been quick oats? At any rate, there are way too many oats in this recipe.  I have three kids who are all cookie lovers, and I made these a week ago and there are still some left.  Sorry but I will stick to my regular recipe.

I made these cookies for the first time, they are wonderful.  I entered a cookie contest with this recipe, I did switch it up a little though.  I used 1 cup of butter instead of shortening and butter, I also replaced the regular sugars with splenda brown sugar and splenda white sugar for baking (I am diabetic)  Anyway they still tasted awesome and the house smelt like I was burning a pumpkin spice candle, yummy

These were awesome!  I loved the scent that filled my house and the flavor was superb.  The only change I made was using chocolate covered raisins because apparently my K-Mart doesn't carry regular raisins!  Anyway, they turned out excellent.

Well, I love oatmeal cookies, but it is esp nice when you find one that EVERYONE likes, even the non-oatmeal fans. The spices are standard, but the balance is nice in this one. I used the golden raisins, as I think they taste better and look better in a cookie.  I have made these a few times now, and also tried it with chopped walnuts.  Every batch has been a hit, easy to make and so tasty! But, I'll always stand by the golden raisins as the best! (Soak them in boiling water first, then toss them in a little bit of flour. That way, the raisins are juicy, not dried out hard bits.)  Yummy overall!  Thanks!

I hate to give this recipe a bad rating but the truth is that I really dont care for the cookies.  They have a great appearance but the flavor is lacking.  I do want to add that I wasnt able to use packed brown sugar and I soaked the raisins in rum.  If I had it to do again, I would not soak the raisins, I would be sure to use the correct sugar and I would leave out the clove.  It seems like it would add to the flavor of a great cookie but ultimately that is the only taste left in your mouth.  Nevertheless, the cookies are simple to prepare so give it a try and dont let my review discourage you!

Help!  I made these last night and now I can't stop eating them!  Gave away 1 1/2 dozen which still leave me with way too many.....lol   I've been wanting to try this recipe for a long time and finally got to it.  It will be in my fav. recipe book soon.  Even my mailcarrier asked for a copy of the recipe today when I gave him some.  I did make minor changes (added a bit of nutmeg and allspice, plus increased the amt of cinnamon; used chopped dates instead of raisins, and added toasted pecans) but the basic cookie dough was perfect. Nice, big chewy cookies!   Tips: 1)Softened butter is not the same as melted butter--you need to know the difference.  2) If I want chewy cookies I try to watch them closely and remove them from the oven when they appear to be slightly 'puffy' in the middles.  The heat of the oven makes the moist ingredients so hot they expand somewhat and if you take them out at that point they will remain moist and chewy.  If the 'puffiness' is gone it will be a
crispier cookie.  Hope this helps.  Beth, now I can't wait to test your other listings--thanks so much for sharing! (even though it is going to kill my diet....)

I chose this recipe because of the raving reviews, figuring 500+ people could not steer me wrong.  For my family and the U.S Marines in my husband's company the cookies get an absolute - please don't make these ever again!!!!  I made another batch of the same recipe without the cloves and got rave reviews.

I made this recipe for a bake-sale and it sold out in a couple of minutes. This is a fantastic recipe, but I would remind bakers to watch that the cookies don't overcook. If they appear light in the middle and golden brown on the edges they are probably done. Don't wait too long!

Such a simple recipe, most recipes take 3 times as long & the results aren't nearly as good. I've probably made this recipe 30-40 times, with kids & friends they never last more than 2 days. I've probably had 8 people tell me these are the best cookies they have ever had, I agree with them.

I was looking for a cookie recipe that would travel well to my Army son in Iraq.  This is a good cookie, but as they were baking I remembered one reviewers comment that these are much better than the ones on the Quaker Oats box.  I decided to compare the recipes and they are the exact same recipe, with the exception of adding the cloves.  A good cookie, but no better, nor no worse, than the recipe on the box.

An excellent, excellent cookie recipe! Like other reviewers I also used an extra 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening. I substituted the cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice, and added 3/4 cup of walnuts. They taste even better if you leave them in a sealed container overnight to let the flavors blend, the next day they are much softer and taste even better! I will definitely make these over and over again, I’m also planning on making a batch to send to my husband who is deployed overseas right now. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Very Delicious! I used 1 cup of butter and increased the amount of raisins to 1 1/2 cups, it just didn't seem like enough.  These made the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've had in a while!

Hands down, the best oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever had...and my family agrees (and half of them don't even like raisins!)!!  I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and they smelled so good baking!! Thank you thank you Beth for this great recipe!  Now, if I could only find a way to make these into muffins.....

Everyone is right!  These are delicious, moist and perfect oatmeal raisin cookies.  I made a couple of changes and I'm still thrilled with the texture and taste of the cookies.  I used all butter and used freshly ground whole soft wheat flour.  No one even knew!  I tried freezing them in little cookie balls, and they came out wonderful--even better I think.  My 10 year old son loves them.

I made a cookie platter for work today: chocolate chip, peanut butter, and these.  In past experience, the other two flavors are always the first to go.  I decided to try these, just to add some variety, and they were by far the most complimented.   Men were tracking me down to say things like, "I've eaten a lot of cookies, and these were the best I've ever had".   If I keep making things like this, I will be a popular girl in the office, that's for sure!   Thank you so much for sharing this one - it's a keeper!  The only thing I changed was to use all Butter Flavored Crisco...it's my secret ingredient in a lot of baked goods.  It keeps the cookies soft and they don't fall flat when cooled.

I thought this was a good basic oatmeal cookie. It kind of reminded me of the recipe on the oatmeal box I have tried before. The only change I made was using all butter. My main issue, was there was just a little too many raisins for my taste. I was trying to make about 2 dozen for a party cookie platter. I made a 1/2 recipe and got 27 cookies using a cookie scoop. They will work great for the party, and I believe they will be well received.

High Altitude Alterations: use 3/4 cup packed brown sugar instead of a whole cup, add a punch more baking soda and put them on the trays in balls not pressed down. I used all butter. Bake for 9 min. DELICIOUS!

The smell was amazing!  The cookie dough tastes very good.  They are a little thin and not as sweet as I like, but still very good.  I'm sure my husband will love them dipped in milk.  Thanks for the good oatmeal cookie recipe that I will file away. :)

Hands down THE BEST oatmeal raisin cookie ever!!! I made this exactly as shown and I would advise anyone else to do the same. Don't change a thing. I love oatmeal raisin cookies and this one is awesome! And for those of you saying Beth "stole" this recipe from the Quaker Oats box, well, you are WRONG!!! Hello...that's what cooking/baking is! Starting with a base recipe and changing it to make it your own recipe. I've had the Quaker Oats recipe and, even though it has some similarities, it simply doesn't compare. THIS IS BETH'S RECIPE AND IT IS THE BEST!!!

This recipe has become a staple for our house. When I first made it, I didn't have ground cloves, so I threw in about 3/4 tsp. of pumpkin spice instead. I continue to make them that way, they are SO good. My 18 yr old calls them "glorious cookies". I also use regular shortening instead of butter shortening. GREAT recipe!

I use all butter and white whole wheat flour in these. They have become one of our favorites even though I don't like raisins in my cookies. I divide the dough before mixing them in and make half with chocolate chips instead. Perfect way to compromise without two messes.

This recipe was awesome and it was easy to make. As recommended instead of using shortening I used a cup of butter and instead of the ground cloves I replaced it with all spice and nutmeg. Before baking I chilled my dough for about 3 hours and they turned out great with a around 10 1/2 cooking time. If you want the closes thing to grandmas oatmeal cookies this is as close as your going to get.

These were easy to make and fantastic.  They were sooo chewy.  I must stress that you need to take them out of the oven a bit early.  They will not look done. But they are.  And then they're wonderful.  They got rave reviews.

So good! I used allspice instead of the cloves cause I didn't have any. I added 1/4 tsp of ground ginger. First batch I baked at 9 min and I thought they didn't looked done so I baked second batch at 10. The first batch was done after letting them sit on the cooking sheet and turned out the best.

Doubled the recipe, but forgot to double the fat (was switching to all butter rather than butter/shortening combo - then only put in 1 c. instead of 2 c.), the good news, the were still great - - and with less fat!

These are absolutely my favorite oatmeal raising cookies! I used all butter, since my grocery store doesn't carry butter flavored shortening. I don't care for cloves, so I replaced them with allspice. I added 1 c. of pecans. I find that these are cookies that really benefit from making balls out of the dough and pressing those flat onto the cookie sheet before baking.

Very delicious as is. 
I like to swap out the butter and shortening for 1/2 coconut oil, 1/2 margarine. I use less sugar and add more raisins. I also use whole wheat flour instead of white.

Nummy!
 I use less shortening ( regular, not butter-flavored) and add  applesauce. like 1/4 cshortening,  add 1/4 c applesauce
 I also  beat the eggs and vanilla and soak the raisins for up to an hour or so beforehand to plump them up.
  they are very good!

I read many of the reviews and was impressed, so pressed on , but need to leave out the butter, adding homemade nonfat yogurt and homemade applebutter. No cinnamon,but nutmeg allspice and cardamon. I also found that the 9lbs of quick oatmeal a friend of mine gave me madeexcellent chewy cookies, as my neighbor kids all came back for more and my husband was afraid I was robbing him of his fair share when I was taking some to others.I assurred him I had made a double double batch, placing some in the freezer. This is a bettet breakfast bar, and not too difficult to concoct,thanks, Beth.

I've been cooking since I was 4, but only just started baking.  I love oatmeal cookies and this is the first cookie recipe I tried and I'll never make another.  It's the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had.  I followed the advice of others using only butter, baking less (9 min)  and adding ginger (luv ginger too, lol) and added in some craisins too.  I found the extra plump raisins in these cookies are amazing.  You can find them at BJ's. I also baked it on parchment paper.  No chance of sticking to the cookie sheet and extremely easy clean up, just throw away the paper.  I made them for Thanksgiving and everyone went crazy for them.  They're a great match with home made cinnamon ice cream,  We started making ice cream sandwiches out of them.  Not only did they disappear quickly, have to double or triple the recipe next time but they were fun, the ic sandwiches, lol.

Good cookies! Mine came out a little puffy and soft, which is fine, but I do prefer a little thinner and chewier. Nothing to complain about in the taste though. I did omit the cloves because I wasn't sure that the people I was making them for would care for clove taste, but I'm sure I would have liked them fine with it. All in all a nice recipe I would make again. Edited: I originally gave this four stars but everyone who ate them wouldn't stop telling me how awesome they were, and they disappeared fast, so I think that calls for the fifth star!

This recipe had mixed reviews.  Some thought the cookies were a bit too spicy.  I guess those people have the so called super taste buds.  Anyway, I probably won't make it again or at least, leave out the cloves.

I substituted Stevia in the Raw for sugar to make the cookies a little healthier (since there is so much butter/shortening) and they came out great. My picky daughter and her friends loved them and they were a HUGE hit at the PTA meeting!

This is NOT the same recipe on Quaker Oats box (looking at it right now) it calls for only butter,3/4cup brown sugar,1/2cup white sugar if your going to say it is the same please make sure you are looking at the recipe the reason these fall apart it because they have to much brown sugar in them

These were great!  To make mixing a little easier though, you can mix the first wet ingredients with the mixer and after adding the dry ingredients, use the mixer again!  Just stir in the raisins.  In our house, and oatmeal cookie has to have coconut though, so I used some coconut flavouring and 3/4 cup shredded coconut as well.  I also like my cookies to look uniform in size, so I roll into 2" or 3" balls and then flatten with a fork.  Thanks for sharing!

Really good!!! Thank you! Used all butter instead of shortening; personal preference. Baked for 11 minutes; soft and chewy, with a slight crisp on edges...perfect! Only thing - they flattened out quite a bit. Not sure if they are supposed to, and if not, wonder what I can do to keep fluffy? Thanks!

I made this with my son today.  I must say, these were so tasty.  I used 1 whole cup of unsalted butter instead of the flavored shortening.  The only other minor changes we did was add chocolate chips instead of raisins, and substituted 1 tbsp flaxseed meal + 3 tbsp water (in lieu of one egg).  The cookies came out great and smelled wonderful.  These were HIS cookies.  My toddler loved them too. Now let's see if dad will try them (he's not a fan of oatmeal, but loves choc chips!).  Great recipe try it!

Beautiful cookies--soft and chewy, and so fragrant! Only one tip-make sure to stir the softened butter and  sugar together BEFORE adding the eggs. If they are cold eggs, the butter will become clumpy and difficult to mix in. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

I will never buy refrigerated cookie dough ever again!  Simply the best oatmeal cookie recipe and I have tried more than I care to remember.  I added 1 cup of pecan pieces, used a large cookie scoop and parchment paper.  Mylove could not wait for them to come out of the oven.
Mylove finished the batch last night and has requested more cookies-only this recipe!

Good recipe, but definitely misnamed, it's not spicy at all, the flavour is very mild.  Sweet, chewy cookie, just will use a lot more spices next time.

I don't think I had never made oatmeal raisin cookies before. I will definitely make them again. Followed recipe exactly and the result was a moist and chewy cookie that stayed that way for days.

These are great! I don't keep ground cloves so I add 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  They are so yummy, so soft and chewy, just how my husband likes them! I divide the batter and put choco chips in half and craisins in the other half.

Delicious! I made these with all butter and 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon, just cause I like cinnamon. Don't leave out the ground cloves, they really add to the flavor. Try soaking the raisins in about 1/3 cup of Triplesec and enough water to cover the raisins then microwave till the liquid and raisins are to the boiling point...let them soak and cool for 10 minutes or so then drain off the remaining liquid ( there won't be much left) and add the raisins...make sure the raisins have cooled off though! This step plumps the raisins and adds a subtle hint of flavor to them which of course, makes these cookies even better!  Thanks for the recipe!

By far the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever had! They are soft and chewy, and have the most wonderful flavor! The cinnamon and cloves do wonders for this cookie! I used all butter instead of half butter and half butter flavored shortening just because butter flavored shortening gives me the creeps! These are delicious cookies!

Okay they had a great flavor but I really had to tweak the cooking times and temperature of my convection oven and I still haven't come up with the perfect time/temp. Also these cookies were a little too thin and crispy. I think I'll increase the flour and decrease the oatmeal nxt time. Also when I first pulled them out of the oven and let them cool slightly, the middle tasted really buttery so i would advise to let them completely cool down. I also think making them with  walnuts will be really good! UPDATE: I let them sit overnight and now they r sssooo soft and chewy and not crispy at all! Definitely five stars now!

I thought I reviewed this (my recipe box says I did) but I can't find it. I'll do it again since it's been a while. Anyways, these are amazing and I can't seem to keep them around long. I've made them 3 times in the few short weeks since I found the recipe! I've always loved oatmeal raisin cookies, they are my favorite cookies, but these are by far the best! And I know oatmeal raisin cookies! My 15yr old son says he doesn't like oatmeal raisin cookies, yet he loves these. The smell and taste will remind you of fall, but you will want them year round. The raw dough is amazing to eat as well (I'm a raw cookie dough kind of person).

These are GREAT cookies made exactly as the recipe specifies (and it's a great recipe to play with as well).  The little bit of clove is what makes them special.  My husband says they smell like Christmas.   In the last batch, I added some dried cranberries in addition to the raisins, SOOO GOOD!  The cranberries added a bright tartness to the cookie that's just wonderful.

This recipe is delicious! I do all butter, about double the cinnamon. I also do it with cranberries, (I use the dried, sweetened ones) and depending on the ones you get, you might want to add a little more sugar. I soak the raisins or cranberries for 10 minutes in warm water before putting them in the mixture. As a fundraiser for my church we sell baked goods and I make these every week and people love them! If you like cranberries, they are amazing with them! I haven't tried blueberries or any other berry in them, but I'm sure that would be delicious too! Thank you for this recipe!!

it's a really good recipe, and thanks to Beth for putting her own spin on it and sharing it with us!  loved it...i halved the recipe so we wouldn't pig out...then, i subbed whole wheat flour (of course) and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cloves (only bc i didn't have any...doubled the amount).  i did use a tbsp or 2 of whole milk to moisten up the batter a bit and added 1/4c walnuts.  truly heavenly cookies!  best oatmeal cookies i've ever tasted!!!

I added 2/3 cup of rum. Soooo good. I also used butter instead of shortening and didn't use white sugar. I was out of eggs so I used 1/4 cup of mayonaise and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder as a substitute.  I can't believe how good these were, especially considering all the wonky changes I made to the recipe. I can't imagine a better oatmeal raisin cookie. I gorged myself on them.

Modified to make these HEALTHY FIRST:  instead of 1/2 cup shortening substitued 1/2 cup apple regular sauce SECOND: instead of 1 1/2 cup all purpose flour substituted 1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup all purpose THIRD: instead of 1/2 cup white sugar substituted 1/2 cup more rasins  Everything else was exactly the same.  Cookies came out great - not crunchy but softer.  Plenty sweet.  Always make sure butter is somewhat firm.  These didn't spread, when you put a dolop of dough on the cookie sheet you have to flatten it a bit.  Loved the spicyness.

I have never made oatmeal cookies brfore. These are so delicious. They are so flavorful. It's nice how the flavor lingers in your mouth after you eat it. I used all butter. I followed a suggestion to use have the cloves. I was a bit apprehensive to use the whole amount of cloves. I'm glad I did. They turned out perfectly!! I will add these cookies to the top of my holiday cookie list!!

these were excellent! nice and moist as well as yummy. however, a trick to having nice and plump cookies rather than flat ones is to keep the batter chilled in between the batches going in and out of the oven. that way the butter melts in the oven when baking rather than while the batter is sitting out waiting to be baked.

I hate to bring the reviews down but unfortunately I did not have luck with these cookies!  I used white whole wheat flour and used all butter.  Kept everything else the same.  The cookies were chewy but the flavor was nothing to rave about!!!  I wonder if it was the flour?  I'll try to make it again using all purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour.  This recipe has so many rave reviews so I'm determined to make it work!

EDIT - I made this recipe again with all purpose flour and it made a huge difference.  The cookies seem to taste better the next day.  Anyways, they are a hit and I can eat a whole tray of these cookies by myself.

It's hard for me to say this......but these cookies beat the socks off my mother's famous oatmeal cookies.  The cloves add this very interesting element that makes you want more.  While I might use a little less (1/4 tsp) if making it for a crowd where they might be picky eaters, for me the cloves were perfect.  I also added 1/8 tsp allspice, nutmeg and ginger to the dry ingredients for a bit more complexity.  I also soaked the raisins to plump them up a bit (my mom's famous recipe does this, so I figured it's a always a good idea).  I bragged about these to her so much, she's having make these for X-Mas this year instead of her recipe.  I'm nervous, but I don't think this one will let anybody down.  It's awesome!

The cookies were a disappointment. I chose this recipe because of the high reviews it had but should have went with another. The cookies were not sweet enough, were on the crumbly side and the cloves ruined the taste. I did find that the longer the cookie sat the better it tasted but I don't know that any amount of time can save these cookies. My advice, if you're gonna make these leave out the cloves and let them sit for a day.

I bake these over and over to have cookies on hand.  They are excellent.  I don't put the raisins in because the kids don't care for them...cookies stay chewy delicious for days...if they last that long.  I love this recipe.

Okay, taste was 100%. The recipe was simple. BUT the cookies came out too thin. I think I should increase the flour to 2 cups. I used 1 1/2 cups sifted flour and the cookies ended up looking unappetizing. And, you MUST use cloves. It makes all the difference! I used 1/2 cup butter and slightly less than 1/2 cup of olive oil. And I used all white sugar. Works fine...but as I said before, something I did differently from the original recipe caused my cookies to be thin and look blah.

I made these cookies tonight and they were a big hit. Very tasty, not too sweet - love the clove kick. I did take the advice of others and soaked the raisins for 10 minutes in hot water then drained and patted them dry with paper towels before adding them to the mix. It is a great tip that prevents you from having hard raisin flavored tar chewys in your cookies. Also, all I had on hand was extra thick organic rolled oats because they are extra thick I only used 2 1/2 cups of oats. The flavor, consistancy, and the aroma made for an awesome cookie expreience. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow. Just like Subway's when you leave out the cloves. My husband ate almost the entire batch by himself. I used all margarine (instead of butter and shortening) and they turned out fantastic. This is my new go-to cookie recipe. I have been looking for a good oatmeal cookie recipe, and had just about given up, since they never turn out to my satisfaction. I tell you what...my search is over. Perfect oatmeal raisin cookie every time.

This is a nice oatmeal recipe but like everyone else there is a distinct taste that you are going for that you remember from growing up.   I tweaked this recipe and found the perfect combo of spicy, sweet and crunch.  I used a whole cup of butter and skipped the shortening.   I increased my sugar to a cup. Added in 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. I replaced 1/2 the regular flour w/whole wheat flour and added a 1/2 cup of finely chopped toasted walnuts.  I omitted the cloves because I've never had it in my oatmeal cookies before and it just didn't sound appealing.  The end result is so perfect that my guy literally closed his eye while he was eating and said they were incredible.   I like a lil bit of a crunch around the edge so I cooked it a minute longer.   The wheat flour adds a darker color to the cookie  so you have to carefully watch and not depend on the color to tell if it is done.  Please let me know if you enjoy.

I agree the recipe is similar to the Quaker carton but honestly adding freshly ground cloves and cinnamon made a huge difference. Even my daughter, who usually isn't a fan of oatmeal cookies loved them. They were especially good when I swapped out raisins for half a bag of mini chocolate chips. Yummy.

This is the BEST oatmeal cookie recipe!  In the past, I have attempted to make oatmeal cookies and they always turned out dry.  These cookies stayed moist and chewy for several days in a resealable plastic bag.  I wouldn't change a thing.

This has got to be the best oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I have ever made!  Thanks Beth for sharing!  I too used 1 c. of butter instead of the mix of butter/shortening.  I also soaked the raisins in warm water as someone previously suggested.  They turned out chewy and so fresh and I hated to give most of them away.  I baked them special for my Dad for Father's Day.  Hope they make it on the airplane!

So this recipe has been in my recipe box for quite some time.  Every time that I go to make it, I find something else to make or go back to my usual oatmeal cookie recipe.  Tonight, I decided that for sure this is what I was going to make.  I debated whether to try and make this recipe healthier like I usually try to do and decided to give it a go and if it didn't work then I wouldn't rate it until I tried it again as written.  So I added 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I also don't really care for cloves, so I used nutmeg as some other reviewers did.  Everything else stayed the same.  I am a cookie dough lover and so, of course, I had to try the dough. At this point in the recipe, all was great.  Scooped them onto the cookie sheet, flattened a little and baked for 10 minutes.  Cooled for a few minutes on the sheet and removed.  They are WONDERFUL!!!  Even without the full 1 cup of butter, so I am sure that they are even better than what I am tasting.  This is replacing my usual recipe and I will definitely be making these often.

These are certainly yummy cookies; I'm not sure they are 5 star cookies; but I am certainly addicted to them. I used 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening (I don't really understand the point of that). I will definitely try out different spice combinations as well! I'd also like to mention I never ever ever add salt to my baking (unless it's bread or pie crust). I left it out for this recipe as well and good riddance!! (I am NOT a fan of salt and avoid it at all costs!)

Delicious!  These cookies bake up perfectly.  I thought the taste of the cloves was a little too strong but it definitely gave the cookies that warm flavor.  I will try a 1/4 tsp of ground cloves next time.  Thanks for sharing!

I just made these yesterday and they came out perfect.  If you haven't already, invest in some good quality cookie sheets and use parchment paper.  shop.jakaubsmarket.com

These are fabulous cookies! My husband and son don't like raisins so I use chocolate chips instead. They don't last the night through. :)

I'm a retired male and this is the first recipe I ever made, because I'm a lover of oatmeal raisin cookies.  I made it the first time with 2 sticks of butter because I didn't have butter flavored shortening on hand.  They came out good, but a little crispy for me, but others thought they were great.  The next time I used the butter flavored shortening and I thought they came out too pasty.  The third time I went back to the 2 sticks of butter and made larger cookies and cooked for 10 min.  They came out just right and they were gone in no time flat.  I've made several times since and they always come out great.  Now I'm on to peanut butter cookies, my second favorite.  Wish me luck.

Definitely a tasty cookie.  I will say that they do not spread at all so if you want a flatter cookie you will need to flatten them.  I added a dash of pumpkin pie spice and substituted applesauce for the non butter shortening.  I cooked mine for twelve minutes at 350 until the tips of the cookies were starting to brown.  They are more of a crunchy cookie and less of a moist cookie.  Tasty.

Awesome cookies! I make about 100 dozen cookies every Xmas and I am always in search of great tasting cookie recipes. This is a keeper! I used all butter as several did. I increased the white sugar to almost a cup and I added walnuts because we love nuts. Here's my tip......process 2 cups of the oatmeal to a fine powder and leave the remaining cup as is. This will give your cookies that "nutty" consistency you are looking for. No food processer? No problem...I used one of those little mini ultimate chopper things or just use your blender. Also always use parchment paper to line your cookie sheet pan and don't over bake. These cookies are wonderful! Enjoy!

We love these cookies! My brothers both say they are the best cookies they've ever had--of ANY kind. The only change I made was to use all butter.

these cookies are a fave in my household & only seem to get better with each day!  i highly recommend simmering the raisins in hot water for about 4 minutes before mixing them into the batter.. Remember to drain them well!  Doing this helps keep the raisins soft as the cookies bake and helps keep the cookie fresh & softer longer!! yummmmmmm even tom the turkey wants one from the oven beloooowwwww! a thanksgiving hit for sure!

These cookies were delectable! I took some advice and used an extra 1/4 c. flour and cut the ground cloves back to 1/4 tsp. I could definitely taste the cloves in the dough, but the taste was very subtle in the finished cookie. 10 minutes was perfect, and the cloves just make them addictive.  It is the same recipe that's on the Instant Quacker Oats container, except for the cloves, which are what make this recipe awesome!

Excellent recipe, I'm not fond of cloves and will probably use allspice next time but I always make the first recipe exactly as stated, how else can you rate it, if you change it?  Just a side note to those that are having difficulties: Humidity affects cookies, as does high altitude.  If you are in a humid place or just having a humid day, use a little bit less "liquid".  If you are in high altitude, use less butter/shortening and a little bit more flour.  These are standard cooking changes for dealing with climate.  Hope this helps.

This is definitely the best tasting oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever had! My husband loved them and he took some to work and they loved them too. I've made them a couple times now and sometimes I add shredded coconut. My only complaint is that the cookie is so soft the it just crumbles to the touch. I followed the directions as well as some reviewers' tips. No Luck.

These definitely were tasty, I believe the addition of the cloves really made it unique! My only problems were that the cookies took me longer than 10-12 more like 18 and I did not have enough of a moist texture in my cookies. But overall the family loved them! Thanks =)

Very nice recipe, make sure you don't overcook them (I burnt the first batch - doh)  I recommend not playing online poker and baking cookies at the same time.  Also, don't substitute nutmeg for cinnamon.  They still turned out amazing though...  Will totally make this again.

I did alter it a bit, due to what I had on hand. e.g. 2 c's oats + 1 c of granola cereal. 1 1/2 sticks of butter + 1/4 c of regular crisco shortening. I used Craisins because it's what I had in the pantry. I added 1/2 tsp walnut extract. I lined my cookie sheets with wax paper. I used a scoop type tablespoon to measure out the dough, which I rounded over the top of the spoon (I would guestimate it at approx. 1 1/2 tablespoons) It made 40 palm sized cookies. I used long cookie sheets, which I was able to fit 15 cookies on each sheet. I baked both of sheets at the same time, I had to switch them around because the bottom rack of cookies wasn't cooking as fast as the top rack. I had to cook them for 15 minutes, but this was due to having 2 big sheets of cookies in the oven. The 3rd sheet cooked at 10 minutes. Final product produced an ever so slightly cripsy outer edge and a soft and chewy center. PS This is not the same recipe as Quaker's (who cares where it came from, as long as you have it). The amounts of butter and sugars aren't the same, + it doesn't call for cloves. Speaking of the cloves in this recipe... it doesn't make it spicy, it just makes them taste perfect! I have acid reflux & almost everything burns my throat but these cookies didn't. Drizzle icing across the tops by mixing 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 2 1/2 tsp milk, 2 1/2 tsp light corn syrup, 1/2 tsp walnut extract. Very Good Recipe, Thanks Beth!

Some reviewers have mentioned that this is the same recipe as listed on Quaker's website and while indeed, the ingredients are extremely similiar, it's Beth's years of tried and true AMOUNTS of those ingredients that does the trick for me.  I used crasins because that's what I had, plus some wonderful pecans I happened to have.  Fabulous cookies says the daughter and hubby.  Next time I may spinkle in a tad of ginger for kicks.

Wow, I really thought these were going to be good, but as one reviewer said, they came out way too gooey.  I had to bake them for 15 min to get them to hold up, and they still were too gooey.  They had a nice flavor, but something was missing.  Thanks for the recipe anyway.

Very good cookie.  I baked mine about 11 minutes. The first batch was hard to get off the pan.  These taste better the next day.  I used all butter because I didnt have crisco on hand.  I will make these again! I wonder how they would taste with chocolate chips? might try that, as my bf is the only one who likes the rasins.

These cookies are DELICIOUS!! (I made my cookies a bit smaller and left them in the oven for 8 minutes to maintain the softness.) I used to make the recipe on the back of the Quaker oatmeal container, and this is NOT the same one. That recipe is good, but this is outstanding! I will definitely be making these again! Thanks, Beth!!

I adjusted the recipe to make it vegan. I used 1/2 cup Earth Balance margarine (vegetable oil works too), 1/2 cup applesauce to replace the butter and shortening. I used 2 tbs ground flaxseed with 6 tbs water to replace the eggs. I also upped the ground cinnamon to 2 tsp, and added 1 tsp ground nutmeg, and 2 tsp ground allspice. Baked it for 9 minutes. It was delicious. I'm sure the original recipe would be very good too but I didn't have eggs on hand when I made it.

Great Recipe! I am watching my cholesterol, so instead of butter, I used Move Over Butter, and 100% egg whites (1/3 cup) and also, instead of using 1 1/2 cups all white flour, I traded for 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and a cup of all white flour.  Everything else I kept the same.  Thank you Beth for taking the time to write it out and thank you Quaker for the perfect oatmeal cookie recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly other than adding a package of instant vanilla pudding and substituting 1/2 t. all spice and 1/2 t. of nutmeg rather than the cloves and they were amazing... GONE the next day!

I changed this recipe quite a bit and it was still amazing!  I added 1/2 c canola oil instead of the shortening.  I substituted flaxseed and water mixture for the eggs, since I had none. had 2 cups of rolled oats and 1 cup of quick oats. I also didn't have many raisins left, so I added a cup of coconut instead.  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and cloves.  Yum Yum!

I have been making this recipe for about 5 years now and it has always been a hit.  The changes i have made are to use all butter, add nutmeg, and add choc chips.  The choc chips really make it extra extra yummy!

WOW! This is, hands down, the best recipe I have had for oatmeal cookies! I did use all butter instead of using some shortening, but that is a habit we have in our home. This will likely be the only oatmeal cookie recipe I will use from here out. Thanks!

Wow. I don't normally give a 5 unless it's exceptional. These hit the spot! They were perfectly *spiced* and a wonderfully chewy cookie. The ONLY changes I made were what I added to the dough...some were plain, others either had butterscotch chips or golden raisins. WOWZA! HIGHLY Recommend giving this recipe a shot...as it's written. :)

I didn't change a thing about this recipe and glad I didn't! These were a huge hit with everyone here. The only regret I have is that I didn't get a pic before they were all gone! This will be my new oatmeal raisin cookie for now on! Thanks for the great recipe!

.I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THESE CHANGES. ITS ONE DARN GOOD COOKIE, AND I WILL NOT GO BACK TO PLAIN OATMEAL COOKIES AGAIN. DOUGH AND COOKIES FREEZE WELL. THANK YOU BETH FOR ONE HECK OF A COOKIE. I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE, EXCEPT USED ALL BUTTER INSTEAD OF FLAVORED CRISCO. I DID NOT HAVE ANY AND I REALLY WANTED SOME MORE COOKIES.

Added a little bit of nutmeg. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Baked for 9 minutes, turned out perfectly! Oh, and didn't add raisins cause I don't like raisins in oatmeal cookies.

This is a GREAT oatmeal cookie recipe.  Unfortunately, i only had cinnamon on hand for the spices and just figured I could double it and it would taste okay.  It did taste okay, but I can see how it would be GREAT if i had the other spices... Follow the recipe to the very last teaspoon!!!

FANTASTIC!!! I didn't have any butter flavored shortening, so just used 1 cup of real butter. Also I baked on an "Air bake cookie sheet" so added a couple of minutes to baking time, but other than that, followed recipe exactly. Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite, and this is a great recipe!

I am always amazed at the reviewers who change everything and then "rate" the original recipe.
I changed NOTHING and found these to be excellent. Took them to a party and they were ALL gone with rave reviews.
The next time I make these, I will probably tweak them a bit to see if I can improve on this EXCELLENT recipe.

Wow!! These are my absolute favorite cookies from now on. I didn't have all the right ingredients so I just hoped for the best with what I had on hand.
I used 1/2 C regular vegetable shortening and 1 stick of Blue Bonnet light. I cut the sugar way down and used 1/4 C spenda/sugar mix and 1/4 C brown sugar...but I increased vanilla to 2 t. I used Sunmaid raisins and cooked the cookies for 9 min. They were perfect!!! And with the lower sugar amounts I feel a little less quilty after I ate 8 of them (my batch made about 55 cookies). Yum!

Ok, almost two thousand people cannot be wrong! This was a great recipe and I have used it several times in last couple of months. I did plumb the raisins in water (boil the raisins and then drain) before using in the recipe. I would highly recommend making these cookies.

these are EXCELLENT! a little chewy and gooey, too. i always use 1 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. a.p. white flour to add some fiber and nutrition. i honestly think it enhances the recipe for the better. i also throw in about 1/4 c. or so of milled flax seed. you can't taste it, but it adds a great heart healthy component to these. i add it to pancakes, biscuits...its undetectable and so good for you. sometimes i'll add a 1/4 c. or so of chopped pecans, too. 
great recipe!

Beth, Beth, Beth!!! Why did you have to share this recipe! OMG, these are the best ever!!! I would give them 100 stars if I could! Perfect cookies. And while I was baking ( and eating) these cookies, I expected to look out my window and see the leaves changing, cool crisp air and pumpkins everywhere.  It felt like a beautiful fall day.  The spices were perfect. Thanks for sharing!!

The cookies had good texture, but they were not as sweet as I like my cookies, and were kind of bland.  This may be because I omitted the cloves - I don't like the flavor of cloves and was just trying to find a god basic oatmeal cookie recipe.  I think I'll keep looking.  As a side note, I used all whole-wheat flour because my mom had used all of the all-purpose making buns and the cookies turned out structurally sound.  I usually have problems with dough/batter consistency when using whole wheat but these were great, that way.  Second time through: Used margarine 'cause that's what we had.  First pan was flat, so added about a tbsp more flour and an extra 1/4c of oats and that fixed the problem.  Added 1/2tsp extra cinnamon and  1/2tsp nutmeg.  Again omitted the cloves (I just don't care for cloves!)

Wow, are these good!  I'm not even an oatmeal raisin cookie fan, and I made two batches of these this past weekend!  Unfortunately, I had a give both batches away (although kept quite a few cookies for myself), so I will be making them again this weekend!  I did use all butter because I never have shortening in the house.  I always bake with dark brown sugar and double the vanilla extract.  And, I doubled the cloves by accident, and the flavor was right on!  The whole house smelled incredible all day.

UPDATE: I made these cookies again, but instead of using rolled oats and such, I substituted breakfast cereal, some dried cranberries, extra raisins and chocolate chips. Any left over dry cereal would do the trick. 

Dangerous, dangerous cookies to have in your house! These are OMG DELICIOUS!!! So, if you eat all 36 don't say you weren't warned. I used all butter and a mix of raisins and dried cranberries because that's all I had. I didn't have cloves so I substituted the cinnamon and cloves in the recipe for 1 and 1/2 tsp of Chinese Five Spice which contains fennel, anise, ginger, licorice root, cinnamon and cloves. The smell is devine. The smell of the cookies in the oven is heaven and each one I eat, I cannot believe how good these taste. I still give these 5 stars even though I subbed in some more spices and used all butter. I will post some photos of these diet busters!

I will use tablespoons instead of a heaping teaspoon when I put them on the cookie sheet.  too small and even though I only cooked them for 9 minutes, they were crusty...not chewy.

These are my favorite Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, they definitely have some spice, not a bland oatmeal cookie. I did not change anything about this recipe. Definitely use butter flavored shortening and not plain shortening. If you do not have butter flavored shortening, then just use another stick (1/2) cup of butter. I dropped my cookies onto the sheet as rounded tablespoons not teaspoons and cooked them for 15-16 minutes with the same results!

Excellent flavor and texture.  Will use this recipe for Oatmeal cookies but I will add some nuts, I used golden raisins instead of dark raisin, and I might try craisins as suggested because they came out looking very plain and not as scrumptious looking as they actually are...maybe I should add 1/2 tsp more baking soda? I will also double the cinnamon and I used nutmeg instead of clove, which I thought worked well.

The BEST oatmeal cookies with or without the spice. I can make these 3 times a week and the family still wants more. FYI make sure to use non-stick baking sheets AND cooking spray as these tend to stick

AWESOME!!!  I only changed two things.  I didn't have any shortening, so I used all butter, and my youngest son doesn't like raisins, so I made half of the dough with raisins and half with chocolate chips. They both turned out wonderful!  I also made them very big, so I didn't have any problems with them burning or drying out (baked at 11 minutes).  This is replacing my regular oatmeal raisin cookie recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good!  Used whole wheat flour and mixed in chocolate chips with half the dough and used coconut and pecans in the other. Yummy!  Worked out great with all butter- didnt have shortening on hand.

Wow! THE best oatmeal cookies Ive ever made, thank you Beth! I followed the recipe pretty exact, of course soaking the rasins in hot water so they would plump first. I used olive oil in place of the shortening. Oh, and I always add more vanilla (one tablespoon in place of the standard teaspoon) and I also added a pinch of ground ginger. Super yummy deliciouso, 15 large cookies lasted just one hour in my house!

My husband didn't like the first batch because of the cloves - he said it reminded him too much of a Thanksgiving ham. He LOVED the second batch (I used all spice in stead of cloves).

This is a terrific cookie.  I used all butter and craisins plumped in hot water.  I'm an average baker, so the fact that this turned out so well means they were awesome!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was a wonderful find!  I have made it over and over again, and my husband told me to throw my old recipe away.  I love that it has 3 cups of oatmeal!  One variation that I have used almost every time is to substitute the white flour entirely with whole wheat.  It is a wonderful, healthy cookie, and we enjoy it as an afternoon snack with coffee.  One suggestion that deserves restating:  Do not over-bake!

These went off like a hit at my Church gathering this weekend.  I thought I had raisins but instead found that I had a mixture of dark and golden raisins with chopped apricots and cranberries.  The recipe turned out wonderfully!
Thank you and I will definitely use this recipe again as I have transfered it to my cookbook of favorite recipies.

My family really liked them. However, I wouldn't call them spicy. I did add some cloves, cardamom, and allspice too make them more so.

This is the Vanishing Oatmeal Raisin Cookies with the addition of the clove.  Quaker Oats has it on their website.  Still a good version though.

The best oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted. I did use all butter and added about 1/8 cup extra flour. 

Thanks! People have already started asking me for this wonderful recipe!

These turned out wonderful!  After reading about those that found it too soft and breaking apart it seemed that it only happened to those that used all butter rather than 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening.  So I keep with the 1/2 c butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening.  I didn't have clove seasoning, so I used nutmeg.  Do to some of the comments about lack of flavor, I did up the cinnamon to 2 tsp and a full tsp of nutmeg (in replace of the cloves).  Also, I only baked them for 8 minutes (9 minutes for the larger size.)

AWESOME!!  I took them out of my gas oven at 10 min when they were a bit raw inside still.  Then they cooked a tad more on the hot pan and they were crunchy outside and soft/moist inside.  They are delicious!!  I didnt add cloves cause I dont like clove flavor so I just added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. :)

First, I did make a couple of changes to this recipe. I didn't have ground clove, so I doubled the cinnamon instead. Also, I had no real butter in the house so I used all butter-flavored Crisco instead. Also, I'm a huge nut fan, especially when it comes to oatmeal cookies... so I only added 1/2 cup of raisins (rather than 1 cup) and 1/2 cup of pecans. My problem with this recipe wasn't the flavor but the consistency. It was a very dry batter that needed to be pressed into balls in order to stay together and the cookies never flattened out during baking either, which meant either flattening them or adding an extra 5 minutes to the bake-time.
The flavor was at least a 4 1/2 stars but it wasn't so great that I felt it was worth the extra trouble of trying to keep them together on the sheet or the extra bake time, sorry.

These are very good cookies.  I double the cinnamon (Just a personal preference.)  This is the same recipe that appears on the Quaker Oats container with cloves added and substituting half the butter for shortening.  The shortening does help the cookies not to spread as much.  I don't use the butter flavored shortening becaue I just don't like the artificial butter flavor.  I always soak my raisins in very hot water for about 10 minutes and then drain.

Always a crowd pleaser, even amongst all of the 'fancier' Christmas cookies on the platter!  I have made these for several years now and they always turn out great and stay nice and soft.  I use all butter, as other reviewers have said, and I add 1/2 tsp of allspice for extra zing.  Delicious!

I make the dough for this and Beth's other cookie recipes and freeze it to give as Christmas gifts. I use a cookie scoop and drop on a baking sheet and freeze 1-2 hours. Then put frozen dough in freezer zip bags. You can bake any flavor, mix and match right out of the freezer. Just place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, bake for 13 minutes at 375 degrees. I found you really need to sift the flour then measure. Especially when making multiple batches. I was asked at Thanksgiving by several family members "your still making cookie dough for Christmas right!?!?!" Thanks Beth

YUM! I used cranberries instead of raisins and used all butter (salted) instead of shortening.  I baked them for about 8 minutes for soft and chewy cookies.  I made them slightly smaller and was able to get 40 cookies.  Bake them on silicone baking mats for a truly chewy cookie!
I'm making more of these soon. Half will be chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips (instead of the raisins).

An OK cookie. I found them a bit dry and not enough flavor in them. Maybe if I soaked the raisins in hot water first would have done the trick? I don't know if I like them enough to make them again and try.

There is a reason this is in the top 20, it is fabulous!  I did add extra spices, a handful of crushed nuts, and a little extra flour for consistency.  I used a medium cookie scoop and baked for 9 minutes-turned out moist and chewy...Thanks

My sister doesn't really like oatmeal raisin cookies. She ate all of the first batch that came out of the oven, and basically finished the rest over the next day and a half. That's how good they are.

Fabulous...Simple amazing! I made a few "healthy" changes though. I substituted 1 cup applesauce for the shortening, and used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Worked great. Also used grandma's secret and added about a teaspoon of grated orange rind. This are a new favorite.

I cant say enough about this recipe, these cookies are so good! Even the cookie dough is delicious as it is! Ive baked them probably 5-7 times and they are always being requested. Thank you so much Beth for sharing this recipe!
** Oh yeah, I forgot to add also that I do make one small change, I use pumpkin spice in place of straight ground cloves. Still yummy but not as harsh. hope that helps.

These were a disappointment.  I felt the spice mixture didn't complement itself, the ginger and cinnamon seemed to conflict on my taste buds, and not only that, but they were not nearly as chewy as oatmeal cookies should be!

These cookies are amazing!  I made them a few years ago and now I am known for them at church.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I don't change anything when I make them.

These were not my most favorite oatmeal raisin cookie.  To me they really seemed to be lacking something.  I really didn't care for the flavor.  Probably wouldn't make again.

They were good.  They did expand like crazy though.  The first batch I made were not worthy of being consumed in my opinion but my boyfriend ate all of them anyways and said they were devine.

Very yummy! I like most of the other reviewers used 3/4 cup of butter, and no shortening. I did soak the raisins in hot water to make them more plump. I did have to leave them in the oven for at least 13 min, maybe because my cookies were larger than what Beth recommended. This will be my new oatmeal cookie recipe! My husband and I could not stop eating them!

These came out really well.  I only made some slight changes, I used heaping teaspoons of whatever herbs it suggested (some other reviewers complained of not enough flavour) and I'm not a huge raisin fan, but I used white chocolate and a dried fruit mix (cranberries, cherries, and blueberries) and they tasted wonderful! I did have trouble with them falling apart a bit, but the taste made up for it!

These are very, very good. I took the advice of others and used 3/4 cup of and no shortening and altered the spices a bit--1/4 tsp. cin., 1/4 allspice and 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. Yum, yum, yum!

I used a total of 3/4C butter (no shortening).  I also added allspice and chopped walnuts and doubled the cinnamon.  I think next time I may reduce the sugar a bit.

We couldn't stop eating them!!

These cookies were delicious, with a few minor changes: I halved the recipe, and upped the oats to 2 cups and the raisins [I used golden] to 1 cup. I wasn't able to use cloves since I didn't have any, but I upped the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. The first batch [cooked for 9 minutes] was browned more on top that I prefer, so I lowered the temperature to 350 for the second batch and baked them for 10 minutes. They were perfect! With heaping teaspoonfuls of dough, this recipe made a generous 2 dozen, with a bit of dough left over to munch on.

Very good cookie--I'll add a bit more cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice next time, but this is a really good oatmeal cookie.  They were gone in about 24 hours.

Delish!  These taste great right out of the oven and when they are cool.  I'm normally a chocolate person and I've never made oatmeal raisin cookies before but I had a craving for them and these really satisfied.  I don't think I'll ever look for another oatmeal raisin cookie recipe!

Yum!!  These were lovely.  I might add a little more flour or cook them for a bit longer as they were not done enough after 10 -12 mins.  They were so good though I will keep trying.

Delicious chewy oatmeal cookies.  Next time, I will add the cloves to increase the flavor; I didn't have any when I made this.  Important to chill the dough so they don't spread too much.  Also, I will try these with real butter to make them even richer in taste.  Great recipe, Beth!

Can I hear an AMEN?  These cookies were delish with a capital D!  I have made these cookies several times and everyone is totally IN LOVE with them!  I even found out my mother-in-law was getting up in the night to sneak a cookie...now that's a good cookie!  I highly recommend these cookies for a special occasion, gift, or for just good ol' yumminess!  Enjoy!

These are finishing up in the oven as I type...I left the cloves out, and doubled the recipe as is. Baked for about 10 mins, and removed from pan to cooling rack immediately. These have a great taste, however, I like a more flater cookie, these stay in drop form pretty much making it a "thick" cookie.

This recipe is wonderful! The aroma of spices and cooked oatmeal is tantilizing. I did use regular shortening instead of the butter shortening and 4 cups of oatmeal. The cloves is a great touch. I did exactly as mentioned and cooked for 11 minutes, cooled 2 minutes. The cookies were moist yet had a cookie texture. The extra oatmeal made them easy to shape. WILL make this cookies again..thanks!

These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies that I have ever had, and I was surprised at how many cookies the recipe made.  They were a big hit.  I agree that this recipe is very similar to the recipe on the oatmeal container.  I can see why it is advertised on the container.  These are awesome cookies.

These are definitely the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever tasted. I cooked them just a little too long but they still tasted good.

Great Cookie!  Crunchy outside, chewy inside.  Be careful with the cloves, can be to over powering. I should have measured more carefully.  A must try!

These were delicious. My family loves nuts in cookies, so I had to add 3/4 cup of toasted pecans for them. That seemed to add a nice dimension, but the recipe is wonderful as is. Thanks Beth

Delish!  I hate to sound too much like Rachel Ray, but they are!  We didn't have butter flavored shortening, so i used normal.  I did the normal butter, but for the shortening, I did half butter and half shortening, and they turned out great.  I doubled the cinnamon and did a little less cloves.  One complaint; same as Quaker Vanishing Oatmeal Raisin Cookies on oatmeal lid!!!

Very good.  I soaked my raisins for about 10 minutes in warm water.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to double the spices.  Nice crispy cookie.

I read the recommendation to use all butter-flavored shortening, great idea!
Also, soaking raisins in warm water before adding them made the cookies very moist even the day after, didn't last longer than that in this house!

The most excellent oatmeal cookie ever!!! Did not change a thing. It is perfect the way it is! You can customize with anything else you like! I added pecans and chocolate chips to part of a batch and also got rave reviews. The spices are delightful and makes the entire house smell like grandmas!

Excellent cookies! That 1/2 t. of cloves makes all the difference. I used all butter, as other reviewers suggested. Also used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (you only use 1/2c. instead of 1c.) You'd never know it... they were great! Only problem is that I should have doubled the recipe; they were gone in a day and a half!!

I made these less than 12 hours ago, and they're half gone! Sent a bag of them to work with my boyfriend so I wouldn't be able to eat the whole jar of cookies! I followed the recipe and they were perfect, next time am going to try with allspice and all butter, just to see. Thank you!

I was lookig for an oatmeal raisin cookie, and this one looked like a winner.it is very similar to quaker's oatmeal raisin cookie recipe, with the addition of cloves. I didn't use the cloves and I added a tad more baking soda, but i like puffy cookies. I also chilled the dough before baking it. I accidently greased my first batch, so they were very flat. the second batch was ungreased and they came out perfectly! They smell heavenly. I also sprinkle cinnamon sugar o them right out of the oven.

These cookies are the best I have ever had, even better than Peperridge Farm!  I added 1/2 cup chopped fuji apples and baked them at 300 for 15 minutes. They were gone in 2 hours.  My family devoured them.

The addition of ground cloves added a nice punch. I'm not a huge fan of raisins so I used dried cranberries. They turned out great.

These are excellent, particularly if you hold off eating them until the second day.  I use sucanat or raw sugar instead of white and brown sugar, and I use Earth Balance instead of butter as dairy does not agree with me.

This is the best oatmeal raisin cookie i have come across.... Husband LOVES it... But I did make a few changes... I used a cup of Butter instead of 1/2 and omitted the butter flavored shortening and I took 2 of the 3 cups of oatmeal and put it in my chopper and grounded it up more...makes a big difference in texture...I always melt my butter half way that makes a difference also...

I loved this recipe and so did everyone else.  I used all butter instead of shortening.  Also, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour instead of all white.  I added 1/2 cup more raisin too.  Delicious!!!

Terrific recipe!  I tweaked it a bit.  I used all butter, no shortening, cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup and for spices, I used 1.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I boiled the raisins for a few minutes to plump them up and they really did stay juicy!  I also added chopped walnuts, toasted almonds and dried cranberries.  They were soooo good!  I would highly recommend trying other mix-ins!

My *favourite* oatmeal cookie recipe so far. They were very simple to make, and the cookies smelled so wonderful out of the oven. I didn't use as many oats or raisins as suggested and that was still more than enough. Must make this again sometime!

Beth this is the second one of your recipes that I have tried and it was as big of a hit as the Chocolate chip cookies.  Love that this cookie does not get flat.  All I can say is I want Beth's recipe box.  Keep submitting the great recipes.

This is a great oatmeal cookie. It is soft and chewy with a taste of spice. Instead of adding raisins I added chocolate chips.My husband loved them. I will definetly make again.

These are the best cookies I have ever eaten.  I am forever getting requests from relatives, co-workers, and friends to make another batch.  Always double the recipe, they'll be gone before you know it.

This recipe is all about using the best ingredients.  Every element came together to make a cookie infused with spice, sweetness, texture and wholesome goodness.  I had added a little bit more cloves, which made the cookie more fragrant and tantalizing.  Based on another recipe, I also added three tablespoons of milk.  The cookie was both crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  A really great recipe that combines the best of all of the ingredients.

Three for three Mrs. Sigg, I'm eating one of these little delights as I type.  The only thing I did differently, was adding yogurt covered raisins, because that is all that I had.  Delish, thanks so much.

I'm not a great lover of oatmeal to begin with, but I made these for my best friend and she absolutely loved them!  I tried one as it came out of the oven (You do have to test for doneness right?), and I have to say I was quite impressed myself.  I added an additional 1/4 tsp. each of nutmeg and ginger.  The next time I make this recipe I plan on increasing that to 1/2 tsp. each for an additional variant.  I will DEFINITELY be making these again.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

This is a great recipe for moist cookies.  Most of the recipes I find for oatmeal raisin cookies are way too hard. We like them nice and soft.  I added chopped pecans and they turned out great.

Delectable cookies! I used oat flour due to a wheat allergy, and they're still delicious. My brother-in-law, an oatmeal raisin cookie connosieur loved them!  I loved the cloves in them. Thank you so much!!

Mmmmm . . . very good cookies, I just made some to give away for Christmas.  I added about 1/2 - 1 cup more flour though, so that the cookies held their shape a little better, which made the dough a lot less sticky.  I also soaked the raisins in brandy.  Definitely a keeper!

Not that this recipe needs my rave review, but I'll give it anyway.
I had no shortening, so I used all butter. Also added a handful of walnuts, just because I love cookies with nuts. Otherwise followed recipe and they turned out phenomenal! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Very good! Used all butter and added a touch more vanilla, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My only wish is that they would've been a tad spicier, only because I love a spicier cookie. That's an easy fix for next time though. Love the way the house smells too!

Great recipe!  Only changed to all butter and added some dried berries and apple pie seasoning that I made.  The house smelled WONDERFUL!  The cookies were pretty tasty!  I overcooked slightly, not used to oatmeal cookies.

Utterly fantastic.  I followed what other reviewers suggested and used all butter and omitted the shortening.  The cookies disappeared quickly, and even my health conscious, non-cookie eater dad asked when I would make them again.  These will now be a staple in our home!

These are spectacular cookies , I made these for a group meeting we had a year ago , they were getting a little down so I figured I would cheer them up a little bit and bring in some cookies as someone in the group mentioned oatmeal raisin cookies as their favorite cookie , so I whipped out my application and went to work and the next morning I brought in cookies that I had doubled the size of cookies so they were big "adult" size cookies and a year later everyone continues to talk about this recipe and continually ask when I am going to bring some in they are all trying to figure out how I make them and I tell them it is a secret little recipe that I have stashed in my head , I don't write it down just a little of this and little of that and a pinch of this and  pinch of that and viola  we have cookies , it is my secret weapon .......

This is by far the best recipe I have yet to make. I didn't have butter flavor shortening, so I just used real butter. Not Margarine.  I did soak my raisins in very warm water while I was preparing the cookies. Also, I baked my cookies for 8 minutes. What I do is roll the cookie dough in a ball, then moisten a bottom of a glass with water and press the ball flat. Be sure to moisten the bottom of the glass after 2 cookies, or they will stick to the glass. My family loved the cookies.

These are very good oatmeal raisin cookies with a wonderful spice flavor. I followed another reviewer's advice and added an additional 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. That turned out well. However, I followed another reviewer's advice to pull the cookies at 10 minutes, and that left me with 12 underdone cookies that fell apart when I tried to remove them. My slower GE electric oven obviously needs 10-12 minutes. 12 especially for the first batch. Be warned. Otherwise, great cookies.

The cloves gave it a strange taste, not what I liked. They will be good cloveless with more cinnamon. I'll make them again.

Awesome recipe. I've been making them for years. I soak the raisins in hot water with vanilla. I also add a tsp of pumpkin pie spice and use all butter. I also add a bit orange zest.

I finally found a close match to my Grandma's FAMOUS Christmas oatmeal cookies. I tried it with just raisins then added chocolate chips then added walnuts. The cookie with it all was definitely the favorite. I also took a poll on the need for buttercream icing. Of course the icing won 100%. Topping with rainbow sprinkles and a red hot candy really made it festive and Grandma's. Thanks so much Beth! My kids will grow up having your cookies every winter :-)

I usually don't post on here but I was so disappointed I had to comment.  The cookies were just blah and after 10 minutes in the oven they were baked to a crisp.  I am modifying by adding more spices to save the dough

I found this delicious but I thought it needed more spice, if you can believe that.  My cookies came out a little thin, but not too bad.  They are tasty (I added about 1/4 cup more raisins, just because we love them) but slightly bland.  The sweetness is right on, but next time I will add more cinnamon.

Really good but made some changes.  Used 1C real unsalted butter instead of butter+shortening, used 2tsp. chinese 5-spice instead of cinnamon+cloves, used orang extract instead of vanilla, and dried cranberries instead of raisins.  Turned out REALLY well, nice and chewy, and the blend of orange and cranberry flavors is there but not overpowering.  A definite keeper!

The cookies are ok, a bit sweet for my liking... and maybe its me but they were too soft as well... maybe less sugar and more time in the oven and it would be a lot more suited to my tastes.

Great flavor.  The cookies flattened out quite a bit, but that happens to me no matter what oatmeal recipe I try, so I don't think I can really blame this recipe.  When cooked for 8 minutes, they were perfect :)

Absolutely the best recipe ever, they were a hit not only with my family but neighborhood kids and school teachers.I did take few pointers from other reviewers- baked for 9 mins., added a touch of ginger,  i added 1 cup pecans, mixed in the oats, pecans, & raisens into the mixture by hand.  They were addicting!!!

It's a pretty basic oatmeal cookie, but not super great.  After following the recipe just as it says, I'm a bit let down. It's just a normal oatmeal raisin cookie.

Oh my were these good!  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding cloves.  I didn't have any so I added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I also soaked the raisins in water for a few minutes before adding them to the mix...this helps them plump up a bit and not burn.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really enjoyed these. The key to making any cookie stay chewy/soft is to take them out before they're totally done. You have to remove them when they still look just a little wet on top. Leave them for five or ten minutes on the cookie sheet and they will continue to cook and firm up. The shortening/butter in these helps to keep them soft. I added a cup of dried cranberries and a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and maybe a tablespoon or so more of shortening. Also, I hate when cookies taste too plain and this cookie has lots of flavor thanks to the spices. Great recipe! It will be my new oatmeal cookie recipe.

I had never made oatmeal raisin cookies before these. For some reason I was nervous to deviate from my reliable chocolate chip cookies but I sure am glad I did! These were SO tasty! I loved the cloves in it, it really took the flavor to the next level. 

I wish I would have read the other reviews about using all butter instead of half butter and half butter flavored shortening. Regardless, they turned out great. 

One change I made was that I cut the flour down to 1-1/4 and I added 1 package of instant vanilla pudding. The cookies are so soft and yummy! I definitely reccomend adding the pudding, it really bumps the texture up a notch.

These are right at the top with out favorite oatmeal cookies, we didn't find them spicy but that's not a bad thing. Used all butter and 1/2 the amount of craisins, no raisins. They are a little flat but all oatmeal cookies are for me unless I cook them from frozen dough balls. Thanks!

Excellent cookies. I used all butter - no shortening;  all brown sugar - no white. But, I think what made them a hit was soaking the raisins in brandy for an hour. Do NOT overbake.

I'm real picky on the appearance of my cookies.  I made these last night.  They got too brown for me.  They are still really soft, too soft for me.  However, I won't make again simply because they were dark brown and don't look good at all.  If I walked by a plate of brown cookies, I'd keep walking and not try them.

Hi, although I think this is a 5 star recipe on it's own (without a doubt) I DID change a couple of things...  I used all butter, 1 1/4 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup of white sugar.  The only thing I would change next time I bake these (and there WILL be a next time) I will add more cinnamon.  I found that the last couple of batches I cooked had more body to them.  The next time, I will let the dough set on the counter for 30 to 45 minutes before baking. I made these about golf ball size on the cookie sheet & cooked them for about 17 to 19 minutes. I let them set on the cookie sheet for about 3 minutes before removing them.  Using parchment paper makes removal so easy! I made 28 cookies at this size.  This is THE BEST oatmeal raisin cookie recipe!  They came out with just a little bit of crustiness on top and soft & chewy inside - yummmmm! I compared it to the one on the Quaker oatmeal container & the ingredients are mostly the same but the measurements/amounts are different.  That changes te end result! Plus the addition of the cloves is a great touch.  Don't hesitate to make these cookies!

I don't even like oatmeal raisin cookies but tried these because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I made with all butter instead of shortening and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, an extra tsp of cinnamon.  They are fabulous and I could not stop eating them!!
Thanks for a great recipe Beth!

These cookies are good, but I wouldn't call them spicy.  Next time I'll double the cloves.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup margarine (no trans fats kind) and dark brown sugar rather than light.  Cookies just seem to come out chewier with dark brown sugar.  I used both baking powder and baking soda (1 tsp each) just because I always put both in my cookies.  I also added a little nutmeg (not quite 1/2 tsp.  They do leave a very pleasant after taste in your mouth though.  I only had to bake mine for 7 min. and removed them from the cookie sheets immediately.  Overall, a good cookie, but could be even better with more alterations.

Really liked these alot- husband likes them also. I soaked raisins in boiling water + 1/2 tsp. orange extract to cover for a few minutes. I also thought the cloves would overtake the other flavors so I reduced amount to 1/4 tsp and added 1/8 tsp nutmeg. I used the 1/2 c. butter flavored shortening as called for (I always make cookies using 1/2 shortening-- really improves the texture of the cookie and cuts down on saturated fat). Oh- and added about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. The result was a light, slightly crispy on edges cookie with subtle spice flavors that complimented the oat/raisin combo without overpowering. Thanks for this tasty recipe.

These are very good cookies.  I will add more cloves next time to make them even more spicy.  I made half a batch.  I got 3 dozen 2" cookies by making a rounded teaspoon--not heaping and not a tablespoon.

These are officially my favorite cookies! LOVE this recipe! I never have shortening in the house, so I just use all butter. Bake them on parchment paper for 9 - 10 minutes. They look undone in the middle when I take them out of the oven, but they always end up perfectly crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. I use Craisins instead of raisins, and also add chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, walnuts, and chopped candied ginger pieces. Ultimate YUMness!!! Thanks, Beth!

These cookies turned out pretty good. I used Crasians, California Raisins ( the golden ones), also chocolate chips. ( 3 Separate batches.) As others mentioned, this is a huge recipe ( I had to cut the original recipe into thirds for what I was banking) and I STILL had to freeze some.  Also, if you prefer your cookies moist, I used an additional 2 tbs more of margarine.

I made these cookies today expecting them to be really chewy to my disapointment they were not that great. They were just like all the other oatmeal cookies I have tried. They got hard after about an hour and they didn't have much flavor.  I don't think I will attempt to make these again.

This was a good recipe just needed some tweaking and not sure what I need to do different next time.  The first batch at 10 minutes were tood hard and the section batch at 10 minutes were too soft and were falling apart.  They have a really good taste and using the buttered flavored Crisco makes a big difference in how fluffy your cookies will come out.  Using just margarine leaves you with flat cookies.  Great taste just need to work on better consistency, maybe less oats, 2 /12 cups instead of 3.

I have made these three times already! I love the chewy/crunchiness of this cookie. I didn't change the recipe at all yet (with 5 star results) but want to experiment with reducing the amount of butter and shortening used without compromising the chewy/crunchy texture.

These are yummy! I substituted golden raisins for regular raisins, and I added 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. I also dipped the bottoms in white almond bark.

The first batch I made per the recipe.  Big hit.  I wanted to make some more healthy versions of same.  So I replaced the butter and shortening with smart balance.  The brown sugar with 2/3 cup of Agava nectar and 1 table spoon of molasses.
The sugar was replaced by stevia. 
I used whole wheat all purpose on the later batches also.  One not old style rolled oats not quick oats. 
I also had a batch I made with cranrasins.  All were hits too. I had to mash them down to get the chewy flat look  on all versions. 

Great cookie I made a ton for Christmas gifts.  They freeze well too.

So delicious! I'll definitely be making these again! Instead of shortening I used melted coconut oil as it is much healthier. You could not taste the coconut at all.

This recipe is simple and good. All I did differently was substitute the white sugar with granulated Splenda and omitted the salt since Splenda tends to bring out the salt in baked goods.I will definitely use it again.

Made some minor changes to boost the fiber content.  Used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat.  Used 2 3/4 cups oats and 1/4 cup oat bran.  Finally, added about 2 tablespoons of flaxseed meal.  Also used margarine as I had neither butter nor shortening on hand.  Otherwise, made as directed and they came out dense, hearty, and delicious.  These are a snack cookie that will stave off hunger!

10 mins was perfect for my oven. These were very good. I will make these again but increase the amount of spice and probably add some ground ginger and nutmeg for more of a spice flavored cookie. Perfect recipe to try out my cookie dough scoop!

These cookies came out very flat and lacked some flavor and spice. I know this is a popular recipe, but it left a lot to be desired.

These were delicious! Instead of the butter shortening, I just used more butter, and they came out fine. I made them for a party, and we ate most of them before the party!

Excellent classic recipe. I make this with dairy-free margarine (to make it allergy-safe) and I'm sure this cookie is even better with butter. With margarine, it is a beautifully textured cookie with the perfect balance of both crunch and softness and even more perfect flavour, thanks to the spice mix. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very moist and chewy just like it says! I used all butter like other reviewers recommended. I absolutely love this recipe and will continue to use it forever! A fun twist is to use half golden raisins :o)

Superb! had no brown sugar so used all white, still came out delicious (crispy). Used all butter. Chewy+sticky and not soft, LOVE IT. I hate raisins so used walnuts and peanuts, tastes wonderful! THE BEST Recipe ever. Note: these do not flatten by themselves

Awesome cookie with easy recipe.  To add a little bit of flavor to these I made a batch with peanut butter morsels added in and a batch with butterscoth morsels. These were gone in my house in a jiffy.  Note: I would add that do not leave cookies in the oven to long. 10 minutes is plenty to have soft chewy oatmeal raisin cookie treats -LOL

These are the best raisin oatmeal cookies i've had and im not a huge fan of them at all.  I had to bake them fro 11min.  But they were so soft in the middle, I loved that.  Not great for people on Weight Watchers, Im having a hard time saying no to second.  I did have to mix with my hands because I couldn't get a good mix in otherwise.  And I used full butter since Im not a fan of shortening.  I also added a couple scoops of my husbands protein vanilla powder.  Thanks for sharing a great recipes! :)

Best Oatmeal Raisin cookies I have ever eaten.  The only thing I did diffrent was soaking the raisens in hot water while I was mixing the other ingredients, just to plump them up.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  The cooking time listed was perfect for my oven.  Great Cookie!!!!!!  Thanks for sharing Lynne64.

I made these cookies yesterday, and I didn't have ground cloves and raisins, just added chocolate chips instead, all i can say is.... this is the most delicious cookies I have baked. I know when I baked something good.... because my big glass cookie jar is empty as of today.... Thanks for the recipe... Just a little note, I baked the cookies for exactly 10 minutes, turned off the oven, and let it sit there for 3 minutes, before removing the cookie sheets. The cookies turned brown on the edges, but super moist and and chewy inside, but not cakey at all.... we looooove it....

These are the most amazing cookies I've ever eaten. Even my husband and brother who are die-hard chocolate in every cookie even like these! The spices are the key! I put a little bit of pumpkin spice instead of cloves and it worked great!

i have to warn you that these cookies are dangerous...  i don't usually like oatmeal cookies and i still can't stop eating them!!!  i used 1c butter (didn't have shortening), 2/3c dark brown sugar (again, didn't have light brown sugar), 1c dried cherries (hmm, maybe i should go to the grocery store before i start on a new recipe - didn't have raisins!), and added 1c of white chocolate chips.  holy cow they're so good!!!

Great! ... I have never heard of butter flavored shortening, so i just used regular shortening, and it was fine. ...also, i always like to soak the raisins in the eggs for 1/2hour- 1hour whenever i make oatmeal raisin cookies-- it just makes the raisins soft. (If you do this for this recipe, just add the eggs/raisins mixture in when it says to add in the eggs.)

These were fab!  Chewy and not too sweet.  I subbed mixed dried berries for the raisins, nutmeg for the cloves and non-flavored shortening for the butter flavored and they still turned out perfectly.

These tasted delicious!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I did substitute allspice for the cloves.  The first batch I made small tablespoon size balls and baked for 9 minutes at 350degrees.  They were nowhere near done so I let the go for aonther 2 minutes.  They came out flat and see-through!  The next batch I made very large tablespoon size balls and baked for 11 minutes at 375 degrees.  For some reason this kept them from flattening out so much.  Both batches tasted great but the second batch looked a lot more like a cookie rather than a paper doily!

Excellent cookies!  I applied the suggested additional spices and used a full cup of butter.  I also added dried cranberries and chocolate chips.  The bake time was hard to judge but for me, 10 minutes seemed to do the trick.

These were the best! I brought them home at Christmas for the family and everyone asked for the recipe. They were soft and had the perfect amount of spice. Plus, they made the house smell wonderful!

Apparently my 2 yr old grandson threw his backpack on this morning and said he was going to Grandma's house for cookies. As raisins are his favorite(not mine) I thought I'd try these! I'm so glad he likes raisins or I may have missed this awesome recipe. I did substitute chocolate chips on the first batch for my hubby...My grandson lives 250 miles away so I thought I'd have enough time to make a second batch before he gets here!!! Thanks for the keeper Beth!

I'm still giving these 5 stars even though I altered it slightly because I think they still would have been fabulous! Instead of 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening, I used all butter. I also added more raisins because that's how we like them. 10 minutes was absolutely perfect for these in my oven. My whole family and I agree that these are probably the best oatmeal raisin cookies that we have ever had. Thanks for the recipe!

I do not like my cookie hard as a rock. If you are like me and want them soft and chewy, stick to a cooking time of 8 minutes or so. Even the next day, my cookies are still soft and chewy

I like spice. The more the better, so I added 1/4 Teaspoon of Ginger. Instead of ½ cup of butter flavored shortening, I used all butter. So instead of only ½ cup of butter, I increased that to 1 cup. 

The best Oatmeal Cookies I have ever had!
-----------
Update - I still love this recipe. I have a variation to offer. Instead of raisins, I used chocolate chips. For me, the combo of the spice and chocolate worked perfectly. 

Still recommend sticking to all butter unless you just happen to like shortening. Also still recommend a lot of extra spice. That is if you live spice like me. I suggest sticking to the original recipe, except for the shortening, and then branching out from there as your tastes dictates.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe to a "t" (which i don't normally do) and they turned out great! Now that i know the recipe is tried and true i may try some variations.....but why bother they are so good:)
i used large flake oats, and thompsons raisins, which i think are classic. I got 50 cookies out of one batch, cooked the smaller ones for 9 min, the others 10-12 all turned out great! Thanks for the simple yet wonderful recipe Beth!!!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. I live at a high altitude, so I increase the flour by 1/4 cup. Great with craisins or raisins!

taste wise, these taste like any other oatmeal raisin cookies I've had and made but texture wise, these are hands down the best. perfectly soft and chewy with just a bit of crunch from the oats. the only downside is I cannot stop eating them!

I used all butter, skipped the half cup of white sugar and used pumpkin pie seasoning in an equal amount to the spices listed. I also chose to soak my raisins in coffee liqueur (Tia Maria) while I prepared the recipe. After I strained out the raisins and was adding them in I felt the dough seemed dry so I poured in the liqueur as well (about half a cup). I rolled the cookies into balls and baked them as such without flattening. They're the perfect bite, while being crunchy yet chewy.

Excellent cookies!  I used all butter b/c that is what i had on hand, but other than that I kept to the recipe.  I baked them for 10 minutes and let them finish "cooking" on the sheets.  this resulted in chewy, deliciously sweet and spicy cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!

soo wonderful!  Made exactly 3 dozen cookies.  Didn't have 1/2 c shortening, so I used 1/3 cup and 2/3 butter.  Also did not have cloves, so used 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  made 1/3 regular, 1/3 with coarse sugar on top, and 1/3 with chocolate chips.  ALL turned out great!

Did as others suggested, butter only no shortening.  Next time I think I'm going to do as the recipe is written.
Didn't have any cloves so I substituted  with Pumpkin Pie spice, still came out great.
Threw in diced Granny Smith apples instead of raisins.  Great!!

Awesome recipe. Made a few changes....left out the cloves based on other readers' recommendations. Added dried cranberries instead of raisins and one cup of pecans. Then I divided the dough in half and added 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips to the one half portion of dough. Put dough in fridge to allow it to rest. Couldn't be any easier or better!

Just came out of the oven and I'm ready to eat them!! A couple of changes to make them my own: 1 cup crisco and 2tsp butter flavor. For the spices- 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Soaked raisins to plump. Baked 11 minutes- my oven usually takes a few extra minutes. Just tasted one & its yumm-o-licious!!!

I've been making these for the last 3 months and have yet to find anyone who doesn't like them.  The funny thing is that the cookie is much better the next day. They are very addictive.    CHANGES: I do not use butter flavored shortening, but regular shortening substituted nicely.  I love pecans and used 2/3 cup chopped.

This was a delicious recipe.  My husband loves his cookies and pie's on the "spicy" side, and his favorite cookie is oatmeal, so it was a match made in heaven. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.  We're not a fan of raisins, so we left that out, but next time we're going to try dried cranberries just to see how that tastes.

They were pretty good, but I hate raisins, so that might have swayed my vote. Also, it was a little too much spice for my taste. Other than that, they were good.

These cookies turned out perfect, a wonderful addition to my Christmas trays.  I did read the other review and used all butter, just personal prefrence, and I made them bite six so I cut the time to 9 min.  Will add them as a keeper to my recipe collection.  Thanks for sharing.

Very nice... the texture and the flavor. It is moist chewy and fragrant with the right amount of spice. I skipped the cloves and added just 3/4 tsp of freshly ground cinnamon, it was just right for me. I also soaked the raisins. I have the last batch in the oven right now and if the texture is the same tomorrow, it will definitely be a keeper.

I love oatmeal cookies and these were really good.  I left out the raisins and added walnuts instead.   They came out very soft for me, the first batch broke up when I tried to remove them from the pan.  I cooked the other batches longer than stated and that seemed to work for me.   There's no doubt I'll make them again, maybe adding less butter so that they're not as soft?  Very good!

I made these 4 days ago and they are just as moist, soft and chewy as they were when they first came out of the oven. Absolutely delicious. I baked them for 9 minutes and they were perfect. I used all butter because I was out of shortening. these were so fantastic, thank you!

I just made this tonight for a Christmas present and they came out AMAZING. I don't know if the person I'm giving them to likes raisins, so I just left those out. The cookies are still super tasty and soft. I did add chocolate chips in the second dozen I molded...they are baking as I write this! I'm so pleased with these cookies! Oatmeal cookies are my favorite so I can't wait to make them again!

Nice flavor, but I'd like a cookie that is both soft and slightly browned.  These cookies are either  browned and crisp, or soft and almost undercooked looking.

perfect!  I made this exactly as the recipe reads and it was perfect.  The edges had a little crunch but then the rest was soft.  I actually split the mix in 1/2 and made one oatmeal raisin batch and one oatmeal Craisin batch (I love cranberries)  The Craisin batch didn't need as much time, but they're still delicious.      This is officially my go to oatmeal cookie recipe.  Thanks!

I would reccommend creaming the sugar and butter together before adding the egg, vanilla and salt. I love the cloves but I think I will add nutmeg and ginger in next time as well. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these with a couple of minor changes. I used one cup of margarine, as I had no shortening or butter, and one and a half teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, instead of ground cloves and cinnamon. These cookies came out awesome! Baked for 10 minutes they came out soft and moist; at 12 minutes they came out with a nice crunch to them.

My dad is on a no sugar/no white flour diet, so I replaced the sugars with honey, and the white flour with whole wheat flour.  I baked the first batch for 10 minutes, but it was overcooked and dry, so I added  heavy cream and baked the next batch for 8 minutes. They were nice and chewy, a little too soft, but that's my own fault.  Next time I'll follow the recipe, and I'm sure they'll turn out great! :)

I loved these. Although the recipe is the exact same as the one on back of the oatmeal lid except with cloves.... But that one ingredient changes everything and made them perfect! I added pecans.

THE best soft & chewy oatmeal raisin cookies ever! I loved the spices...they smelled and tasted fabulous! I didn't have any shortening, so just used butter. They were so yummy...I brought a batch to my son's college dorm, and they were a total hit! Thanks for sharing this perfect cookie recipe!

Fabulous!  My only complaint is that I didn't double the recipe :)    I used regular shortening since I didn't have butter flavored & I didn't feel as though I was missing anything.  I can imagine that these would be even better with the addition of chopped walnuts, so I plan on adding 1/2 C. next time I make these.

I would have to add my 5 star rating, if it ever gets read! With every other oatmeal cookie recipe I have tried the cookies spread out so much on my stoneware baking pans. Not, these, they really keep a nice shape. They also use less sugar than other recipes, which lets you enjoy the flavour rather than just the sweet.  I like to make these with Earth Balance "vegan buttery sticks" as I often bake for someone with a dairy allergy, and I use 100% whole wheat flour instead of the white. I do add a teeny bit more baking soda but not sure if this is necessary. Also, I find they take 12-13 minutes on my stoneware pans. And it makes about 5 dozen cookies with my 1 tablespoon dough scoop thingy.  YUM YUM!!

Edit:I usually only use 1/4 cup of super packed brown sugar. An I use chocolate chips!

Very good recipe and I don't even like oatmeal cookies!  I followed the recipe for half the dough and added coco powder to the other half (as a kid pleaser).  Both turned out really good and soft!

These are truly an exceptional cookie.  I did make some changes but I think they only enhanced the great recipe that Beth has shared with us.  I used all butter instead of shortening, added a little ground allspice, used Sunmaid Mixed Raisins (Thompson, Golden, and Red Flame, YUM!) For my oatmeal, I used Arrowhead Mills Oat Flakes which is a very sturdy oatmeal and my nuts were sliced almonds.  Together the almonds and the oat flakes added a nice crisp crunch around the chewiness of this fabulous cookie.  Thanx so much for sharing this, Beth!  This will be the standard for oatmeal cookies around here from now on. :0)

I followed the recipe, but instead of raisins I added chopped dried cherries, 1 t almond extract (in addition to the vanilla), and 3/4 c slivered almonds. Fabulous!

Couldn't locate my usual oatmeal recipe so I tried this and have not looked back. We have made it 4-5 times. One time I added chopped dates it was wonderful that way also.

These were the best oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted! Also, everyone (10+ people) I served them to agreed.  I used craisins instead of raisins, and it was quite delicious. Thanks for this recipe!

Okay, I'm eating the very first one right now. One word: Yummmmmm!!! I actually baked them for the full 12 mins as they were too soft and breaking a bit when I tried to take them out after about 9 mins. After 12 mins they were still soft, but easy to remove from the cookie sheet with a spatula. Will def. bake these again!

These cookies were flavorful and soft. The only changes I made were as follows:  1) used 1 cup butter instead of half butter and half shortening 2) increased vanilla to 1.5 teaspoons 3) used 1.5 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and cloves I also softened the raisins in warm water while I was measuring/mixing the other ingredients as other reviewers recommended. Cooked for 10 minutes for a golden colour but soft cookie.  My family loved these and I love that the cookies are soft, but since everyone eats so many of them, I will reduce the sugar next time. Since the raisins are sweet themselves, I think the sugars could be reduced by a third and the cookie would still be satisfying (and not healthfood-like). Thanks for sharing the fantastic recipe, Beth!

These are great!  I even made them a bit healthier by using whole wheat flour, egg substitute, and 1/2 stevia, 1/2 white sugar along with the brown sugar.  They didn't spread as much as others but they were still the right consistency and delicious!  Thank you!

These were the best.  Thanks for sharing.  I have made lots of good oatmeal cookies, but I have to say this is one of the best.  I added some extra spice as others have.  No other changes needed.  YumO

Excellent!  Used 2 sticks of butter instead of 1/2 c shortening.  Also used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg instead of cloves.  Very good.  Love how they are crispy on the outside & soft in the middle.  Will definitely add these to my regular cookies.

I can see there is actually nothing else to say about how superb these cookies are. I do sometimes use cranberries instead of raisins. Depends on my mood. One is as good as the other. I also like my cookies with walnuts. I noticed when I do put the nuts in them they don't spread out as much. So I press them down gently and they will made a perfect cookie. Thanks Beth! These are my favorite cookies.

This is a great recipe whether it's Quaker's or not, who cares! I always throw in a box of pudding when I'm baking so I added a box of vanilla & used currants which I soaked in boiling H2O while I was mixing up the batter. I cooked mine for 9 min. in my convection oven & they turned out perfectly although I didn't have the shortening, don't use it, so I used a full cup of unsalted butter. Definitely a keeper!

Well I've had a hankering for oatmeal raisin cookies for about a week.  Tonight, I just HAD to have some.  Since I'm only cooking for myself, it would have been dangerous to make all 36, so I scaled the recipe to 12.  I WISH I had made all 36 so I could have shared - these were SO good.  I did make a few changes.  I added 1 tsp molasses, used turbinado sugar, flax seed rather than an egg, and allspice instead of cloves.  YUM

These cookies are really good. I did use some suggestions from previous reviewers. I soak the raisins in hot water before adding them and I add a little fresh ground nutmeg and omitted the cloves because I do not like them. Awesome cookies and everyone asks for the recipe!! :)

While I personally am not a fan of oatmeal cookies, my family loved these! As a note, if you don't have the shortening, you can just use another 1/2 cup of butter - you'll be fine. I also omitted the raisins, as I didn't have any on hand, but I heard no complaints. Yum!

By far the best oatmeAl rasin cookie recipe! I baked mine in muffin tins. They come out light and fluffy and perfectly round. I also soaked the rasins in water before hand and used all butter (unsalted) instead of shortening. I took these to work and my coworkers and managers devoured them! It's a good thing I didn't bring the entire batch! Some said the best oatmeal cookies they ever had. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Thanks Beth, A great flawless recipe.  I am a 64 year old widower and my wife besides being a wonderful person was a great baker and I have been searching for a recipe for my grandchildren that is healthy and this fits the bill.  Besides if an old boy like me can make perfect cookies from this recipe anyone can.

I've made this recipe twice now -it's good but the cookies turn out too crunchy and too grease for taste.  Next time I will move them directly on to the cooking rack to cool rather than waiting and cut back on the butter to see if it helps.

I am not really a big fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, but these were great!  I used 1 c of butter and only 1/4 tsp cloves because i don't like a ton of spice.  I actually halved this recipe and quartered the oats on accident, and they still turned out excellent.  I can't wait to make them again, with the full amt of oats.  Definately worth trying!

Cookie Perfection.  Doubled this exact recipe, I made the cookies jumbo size using a muffin scoop and used dried cranberries, cherries and blueberries in place of raisens and added white chocolate chips. I am and avid cookie baker and this was an EXCELLENT cookie.  Lightly golden slightly crisp edge not flat but puffed just right in the middle and soft on the inside. Better than the bakery. The time had to be upped to 16-18 minnutes in my oven due to the JUMBO size. TRY IT!

Head to head with 'soft oatmeal cookies' from this site, I'm afraid this did not add up. The cloves are nice, but they were too soft for me. The changes I made (which I made to both) were to increase cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp and cloves to 1 tspn. I used Earth Balance buttery spread. One half was raisin chocolate chip and the other was craisin white chocolate chip. Good, but not the best.

Very good recipe. Didn't have cloves on hand, so just used cinnamon and allspice. Also substituted applesauce for the butter and shortening to make it healthier, and it came out great.

The spice in these are great!  Yummy cookie, but not as chewy and soft the next day.  We added some mini chocolate chips that we enjoyed with the raisins.  I would seriously underbake these as they firm up a lot.  Tasty recipe though.

These cookies are really good.  I do not normally like oatmeal raisin but these are delicious.  I used two sticks of butter since I didn't have the shortening and will likely keep making them the same way.  I am VERY particular about cookies but I am adding this one to my recipe book.

i've made this recipe twice in the last few weeks, once with all butter, and one with butter and the shortening like the recipe calls for, i LOVED the ones made with shortening!  i was making these for someone who requested oatmeal raisin cookies, and i don't usually even like them that much, but these are AWESOME!!

Great recipe. I add lots of extras like dried spinach, dried carrots and my dd loves her special oatmeal cookies and gets some extra veggies to boot.

2,460 people can't be wrong! I tried this recipe last night with slight adjustments per others reviews: -    1. Increased cinnamon to 2 tsp.  2. Added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  3. Added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger.  4. Added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  5. Decreased shortening to 1/4 cup.    I chilled dough in fridge for 2 hours, scooped them with in between 2 melon ballers instead of the bigger ice cream scoop for more uniform, smaller and cuter cookies and baked mine for exactly 10 minutes.     These little wonders came out as highly aromatic... perfectly chewy and best of all... very flavourful cute cookies! They stand tall and don’t fall flat at all upon baking and I shall post my photo later…    KUDOS! A VERY BIG THANK YOU FOR RECIPE SUBMITTER AND THOSE TOP REVIEWERS!!!

I loved these cookies!   The ground cloves in this recipe really make these over the top good!!!  I added some walnuts just because I had a few on hand that needed to be used and used golden raisins because they are my favorite.    These cookies would be great with craisins also.

My husband and dad requested these for Christmas, so I came across this recipe and decided to make them. They came out perfect and they loved them and ate every single one of them. The only thing I changed is that I used regular shortening instead of butter flavored because I didn't have any. Other than that, I followed it exactly and they came out perfect, moist, and soft.

i know... why bother to review when so many people have already made it pretty clear that this is an AMAZING recipe, but i had to:).  i printed this recipe at least 5 years ago and it has been my go-to recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies.  i leave the shortening out and use only butter, but that is the only change.  i bake them until they are still slightly soft in the middle and they stay moist for days.  the most delicious oatmeal raisin cookie i've ever made or tasted.

Awesome!  While a self-proclaimed Cookie Monster, I'm not a big fan oatmeal cookies, I sampled one to make sure they were edible.  They were so edible that I had 2 more.  :O)   I followed the recipe to the letter EXCEPT I had substituted pumpkin spice for the ground cloves since I didn't have any of those on hand.

Fantastic!!  Just made them this afternoon for my 1st Christmas cookie.  They are delicious.  Packed most of them in the freezer, but left out a few for us to enjoy now.  Hubby & I agree, they are wonderful.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe.  Thanks for such a good old-fashioned treat.

This is a great recipe and heres a few tips. 1. I didnt want to use cloves so I didnt, no biggie, recipe still works. 2. I didnt have any butter flavored crisco, no biggie, substituted regular crisco in place of butter flavor, recipe still works.  Also used the recommended about of real butter. 3. I refridgerated the dough before cooking 4.  Theres a review on the first page from someone that ended up with cookies that fell apart, that almost caused me to question the baking time. DONT.  If you follow the recipe, and chill the dough, 10-11 minutes is plenty of time.  You really dont need these cookies browned. 5. I use insulated cookie sheets, for me, these always turn out the best cookies without burning the bottoms.

This is hands down the BEST cookie recipe ever! I have tried many different cookie recipes over the years and I like this on the best, even though I'm not partial to oatmeal cookies. The only change I made was to decrease the brown sugar by half a cup, so that I ended up using only 1 cup of sugar total since I prefer a less sweet cookie. It came out perfectly moist after 11 minutes of baking. I will be making a lot more of these over the holidays.

The only thing I change when I bake these is I omit the cloves and use golden raisins soaked 10 minutes in hot water and drained. Makes 4 dozen for me. They come out absolutely perfect each and every time!

Pretty good. The texture of the cookie is perfect, but the cloves are a little overpowering. I added extra cinnamon and still couldn't taste it over the cloves. I I would suggest halving the amount of cloves or leaving them out altogether (like the original Quaker recipe).

I have not made these yet but wanted to respond to Jamiesd. Yes, using all butter instead of half butter, half shortening would cause the cookies to flatten. Butter melts at a lower temperature than shortening and does not provide the same structure and body. Better luck next time!

This recipe made 52 cookies using TABLESPOONS (some rounded, some not so rounded) in case anyone needs that info. With that said, these were delicious, but not exactly what I call the best ever. I halved the clove and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg (cloves don't generally do much for me except make me wish I hadn't used them). I think probably I should've upped the cinnamon or flattened the cookies out so they'd be chewy. They are nice and soft, but that isn't precisely what I was after. However, they ARE delicious, so I'm giving this recipe 5 stars. Thanks, Beth!

As other readers suggested I went on and added the nutmeg and ginger to give it a more holiday spice.  Have made them both ways and great with just the cloves too.    Also, because I have high cholesterol, I substituted (in place of the butter and butter flavored shortning) 8 TBSP's of Smart Balance.  This significantly lowered the amount of cholesterol and eliminated any trans fats that would be incorporated by using the butter and shortning.  Cut the cooking time by two minutes and they turn out just fine.    My 2 yr old loves these!!   I'm going to try replacing the sugars with Splenda substitutes for the white and brown sugars next time around.  Maybe if I'm lucky it won't take away from the great taste of this cookie.  Then they will be heart healthy and diabetic friendly ...

I followed this recipe exactly and had the same problem many others had; the cookies turned out very flat.  My uncle (pastry chef) solved this problem for me.  My baking soda and flour were older than 6 mos. old.  I hadn't even considered that.  So, anyone else who had this problem try new baking soda and flour and they will come out normal; you don't need to change anything about the recipe.  I will say that although the first batch was flat and fell apart, my husband and all of our kids loved the taste....they were gone that evening.  Great taste and texture.

I just whipped these up...delicious! I didn't have any butter so I used a whole stick of the butter flavored shortening and three teaspoons of water. It may have changed the flavor a bit, but they are still great. They were not too soft at all...wonder what happened to so many people that they are falling apart! I also left out the raisins since my honey makes faces at them :)

The taste if wonderful, but I can't get these off the cookie sheet as a cookie!!  I have a ton of wonderful tasting crumbs.  I refrigerated the dough thinking maybe I had let the butter get too soft, but that hasn't helped.  UPDATE: I found success!  IF YOUR COOKIES CRUMBLE: I finally finished off the dough by dropping the chilled dough by a scant tablespoon into mini-petite no-stick muffin tins (the ones that each cup holds about a tablespoon of batter).  I baked them the recommended time and they came out as mini-petite muffins.

These are great! I must say that I have made a few changes, though. In place of the regular brown sugar I used Splenda brown sugar. Trust me it does not taste any different. Every little bit helps, right? Also I have added some nutmeg and allspice as well as the cinnamon it calls for. I think this adds a great depth of flavor. And finally instead of raisins I have added Craisins and white chocolate chips. I will try them with raisins next time though, because I am sure it will be fantastic. Take the advice from other reviewers and bake them for 9-10 minutes max. They are soft and chewy and really to-die-for good! Thanks Beth for such a fantastic recipe!

I gave this a four star rating because there are a few tweaks that will greatly improve these.  First, just use a cup of butter and omit the shortening for a chewy but cooked texture.  Also, I'm going to omit the white sugar and maybe even cut back to 3/4 c of brown sugar because they are just too sweet.  And finally, maybe at a pinch (1/8 tsp) of nutmeg.  Otherwise very, very good base recipe.

This is a lovely oatmeal cookie, as written. Not crazy about clove...leave it out. Want nuts...put them in.

I've made this recipe almost every weekend for several weeks now! I don't use cloves, and I up the cinnamon to at least 1T. I like these best just with raisins, although I tried one batch with raisins, chocolate, and nuts and another with raisins and chocolate.

Great flavor! Make sure to not overcook if you want a chewy cookie. Pull out of the oven BEFORE tops are browned!

Although these were quite good, they weren't as spectacular as many other recipes rated 5-stars.  I felt that the flavor could be improved further.  I did make a few of the changes suggested by other reviewers:  Used all butter (instead of half shortening), added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and soaked the raisins in hot water for 10 minutes to plump them.

I can't believe there are people saying this is the same recipe as on the quaker box. I have made both, and they may be similar in ingredients but the quaker recipe uses all butter and no shortening and no cloves. With these changes, it is a completely different cookie. I will be using this recipe as my go to oatmeal raisin cookie. Got rave reviwes from all who tried them. And my family knew this was different from my usual oatmeal cookie.

These cookies are great! It has a little bit of a new flavor (in a good way) from the combination of spices. Will definitely replace my now bland oatmeal cookie recipe with this one. Thanks!

These cookies were very good. I loved the soft, chewy texture, and they had a great flavor. I used a mixture of dried cherries and golden raisins, and it was great. Next time I'll leave the cloves out - the flavor was too strong for us, and I'll throw in some toasted pecans for a little crunch. Thank you for a great recipe!  Update: I made these cookies again and this time cut the cloves in half and added pecans - really wonderful. You can use dried cherries, cranberries, raisins, or golden raisins - all great. We really love this recipe.

The best oatmeal cookies ever!  Just to note though:  I have made this recipe numerous times before, but have started to use whole wheat flour...so I replaced the white flour for whole wheat and you could NOT tell the difference!  Also to get my kids to eat something healthy, I added about 1/4 cup of ground flax seed and again you could not even tell!

These are amazing!  I don't like to bake with butter-flavored shortening (b/c of the partially hydrogenated fat) so I used 1 full cup of butter instead of 1/2 c. butter & 1/2 c. shortening.  They came out great!!

My brother wanted oatmeal and raisin cookies for Christmas, so I made these.  He loved them! In fact, we all did.  They weren't hard or dry like other oatmeal cookies I've made.  I didn't have cloves, so I used 1/2 tsp of Allspice instead.  I also used all real butter and no grease.  There were crispy around the edges, yet soft in the middle.  This one is a keeper!

These are really good, but they're not the absolute BEST cookies in the whole wide world.  Maybe because oatmeal isn't my all time favourite.  These were nice and I liked the addition of the cloves.  I found them a little too sweet, and I would probably decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup next time.  I followed the recipe exactly with good results.  Thanks! UPDATE: I'm changing my rating to 5 stars as everyone I've served them to thinks they're the best cookies ever!!!!  I guess its just me:)

15 STARS!!  These are the absolute BEST cookies!  I make them EXACTLY AS IS and have made them w/marg&butter or w/all butter.  For best results USE THE SHORTENING AND BUTTER!  They just turn out so pretty!  I've made these at least 10 times.  I'll be using this at the upcoming Christmas cookie exchange!

Another great cookie recipe from Beth...I tell ya, this woman knows her cookies!

I did make a couple of small changes...I used all butter, we don't use margarine.  Also, I used a cup of dried cranberries instead of the raisins and added some chopped pecans and a little orange zest.  Yummy cookies!

Best oatmeal raisin cookies I've had in a long time. My tsp's of cinnamon and cloves were heaping, and I used all butter because that's what I had, but other than that I followed the original recipe.

Very good oatmeal cookies.  I made a double batch of dough today for a bake sale this weekend.  I baked a few to do a taste test.  I like them better than the classic oatmeal cookie recipe - the cloves add nice flavor.

This is a GREAT recipe!
A few changes/additions - like OCEANFLWR82, I added another 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground ginger, used all butter (instead of the shortening), and baked for 10 minutes. I also added a cup of chopped walnuts and used "golden" raisins. Very tasty cookies! Happy baking!

Followed directions to a T - smelled great, but were flat, mushy,fell apart,  and were embarrasing to bring to Thanksgiving. I'll stick to my own recipe.

These are great cookies.  Next time I will add wheat germ and flax to add some more nutrients.  The only change I made was to use all butter.  These smelled great while cooking.

This is my husband's favorite cookie ever.  I like to change the recipe up sometimes, adding butterscotch chips and sunflower seed kernels.  Just the best, most moist cookie ever! Thank you so much!

The reviews for this cookie got me really pumped up and I went straight to my kitchen and made them. But.... ugh! They are defiantly not as spectacular as the reviews made them out to be :-(  They are really missing that pizzaz everyone claims they have. The good thing about these is that they have a nice after taste... I also found I needed to cook them for 15 to 20 min as opposed to 10 to 12 but it might just be a preference thing. Also I regret not putting in more cloves (and I only "regret" it because I probably wont use this recipe again.) My advice: use a different recipe. Happy cooking!

This is a flawless recipe. Like other users I didn't use shortening and used all butter instead. I also used more Vanilla than the recipe called for and because i love the taste of chocolate and raisens I used chocolate covered raisens. My husband and kids loved it!

I am certain this is the recipe on the oatmeal canister except for the substitution of 1/2 c shortening for the butter, and the addition of the cloves (which I LOVE - the smell and the taste!). I am not thrilled that it's the same 'ole recipe and was looking for something different. I didn't use shortening though, so I'm giving this the benefit of the doubt and giving 4 stars. Maybe the shortening will make it great, but I'm thinking not. I will try again with the shortening, but using butter is just not enough of a change.

I can see exactly why this recipe has a 5 star rating.  Delicious, right down to the last bite.  I accidently softened 1 cup of butter, so I used all butter in place of the butter and shortening.  It was very yummy, nontheless.

i noticed someone else caught this too, but just by reading the recipe i knew it was almost identical (except cloves) to the quaker oat recipe, which i've nerdily memorized. it's a great recipe.

This is a pretty good cookie, but not a great cookie. I followed the directions exactly, and ended with tons of wonderful crunchy but still moist cookies. The problem is that the flavor is a little confused. The oat flavor is muted; the cloves stands out front and center; the raisins, cinnamon, and vanilla are well balanced. For an oatmeal raisin cookie I want the oatmeal and the raisins to be fighting for prominence, not the cloves. I could accept the spiciness of the cloves more if there was a complexity to it such as happens in curry or in pumpkin pie. Some reviewers have suggested adding ginger, allspice, nutmeg, cardamom, etc. to spice it up and I think that has the potential to turn this from good to great.

Ive been hunting for an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie recipe for ages and they have never measured up before but this recipe is gorgeous. 
My only modifications, even by accident were to use Self-raising flour (Im in the UK and didnt realise that All-Purpose Flour meant Plain!!) and I added a teaspoon of mixed spice as I like them with a strong taste. 
They turned out lovely though and I think using Self Raising flour gave them a lovely light texture.
Now Ive got to try and save some for when the children get home from school, and not munch on them all myself!

I used turbinado sugar as a substitute and reduced down to 1/2 C butter without shortening.  I also used other members reviews and added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ground ginger.  I dropped the bake time down to 8 minutes and I added 1/2 C more oats.  The cookies turned out beautifully and tasted very delicious!

I know that everyone and thier mother has reviewed this recipe, but I can't help it. It was just so very good. I subbed 1/2 cup ground flax seeds for 1/2 cup of the flour to boost nutritional content (and somehow make it ok that I ate EIGHT cookies throughout the day that I baked these!!) & dropped the white sugar for a squeeze of honey. Although I made a few changes it was nothing too drastic that altered the "flavor" so I feel like I can say that this is the very best recipe for oatmeal cookies EVER!(you might get tired of reading it, but...)
Thank you so much for this recipe, Beth!

So, here's what I did.  I added 1/2 C bran, 1 C coconut, increased the walnuts to 1.5 cups, added 1 tsp ground ginger and used candied apples instead of the raisins.    I baked at 350 for 13 minutes  These are VERY good.  Crispy outside, chewy inside.

I am so glad I found this recipe... again!  I made these about a week ago froze the dough in a cookie roll (I wrap it in wax paper so it doesn't stick, and then plastic wrap).  Tonight I needed something quick for desert so I baked a batch.  I don't know if they got better over time, or if I ate too much cookie dough to notice how good they were the day I made them, but they are awesome!  So I have been frantically searching my Allrecipes recipe box so I could tag this one.  The only thing I did different was to substitute 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips for the raisins. Definitely a keeper!

very good, great spices, and very addictive.  although it's a great recipe, next time i might try decreasing the sugar by 1/2 cup or so cos the cookies are pretty sweet.
thank you!!
Update: made these again using 1 cup butter, no shortening, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I did soak the raisins in hot water too. Delicious! (May even be able to get away with 1/4 cup less sugar too)

I'm not sure what I did wrong here, but my cookies were so thin that when I picked them up with a spatula, they almost folded in half.  I suppose I'm just not adding enough dough.  The taste of these cookies were divine.  I'm going to perfect the consistency of these cookies, because the taste of them is certainly delicious.

I made these twice-once with only butter and once with 1 1/2 sticks butter & 2 tbsp of shortening. Both times with "quick" oats. They turned out great! My hubby said he didn't like oatmeal cookies but asked me to make a second batch of these. Great, easy recipe. I omitted the cloves. May add dried cranberries next time.

This is the best Oatmeal Raisin cookie recipe I have tried (and I've tried many)with a few adjustments. I used only butter instead of the shortening. I replaced 1 cup of white flour with whole wheat flour and used only brown sugar. I also soaked the raisins in hot water to plump, and added some butterscotch chips.I had a ripe banana, so I mashed it up and added that too.They turned out fabulous. I will definately make these cookies again.

These are perfect!  I used all butter (margarine) and they turned out chewy, not flat, and very flavorful.  My kids said, "ewe, raisins" when they saw the raisins, but soon were asking for more before the other batch was done!

Oooh these were so good! Very chewy and flat, even though I decreased the butter by half a stick (I used all butter - no shortening). They had lots of flavor. Instead of raisins, I made some with dried cranberries and some with chocolate chunks. I really liked the cranberries in them. Great recipe!

I realize I'm the underdog here, but these cookies just didn't work for me.  I've been cooking/baking many years and I followed the advice of others, added extra spices, etc., but these were nothing spectacular.  They didn't have the flavor I was hoping for. My daughter and I both baked cookies to enter in the county fair.  She made the cookies from the recipe on the back of the oatmeal box and I followed this recipe.  She got a ribbon and I didn't win anything for them.  Go figure.

These cookies are amazing.  I usually sub. dried cranberries for the raisins and up the amount to 2 cups.  By far the best cookies ever!

Fantastic recipe.  The cookies were very flavorful, not overly sweet and super moist.  I did make a couple of changes though.  First, I used 1 cup butter in lieu of shortening.  I also substituted whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour. Finally, I did not have any cloves so I used a mixture of nutmeg and ginger instead.  Baked for exactly 10 minutes and these were perfect.  My family loved these.

Baking at high altitude (8200 ft.) is always a challenge, but I didn't need to alter the recipe at all...just increased cinnamon since we didn't have any cloves...crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside!

These are good but they are the same recipe that's on the back of the Quaker oats box. With more butter/margarine and added cloves. I think the recipe on the back of the Quaker box, is better. Sorry

This recipe seems to have been given a bad rap.  It is really quite good and easy.  I did however use only butter because I hate crisco in cookies.  I also think that they cloves were a little strong for my taste and I will likely cut them back next time and try a little nutmeg.  Just don't walk away from these cookies!  They must be taken out when the edges begin to look done.  They will NOT look done in the middle on top.  Don't worry about that.  They continue to cook once out of the oven if left on the cookie sheet.  Let them set there until cool and they will be perfect!  the three dozen I got from this recipe were gone in TWO DAYS!

Awesome recipe! Our family and neighbours all enjoyed these cookies. I took them out of the oven at about 10 minutes and they where soft and chewy. Thank you! I will make these again and again.

I didn't have butter flavored shortening, so I used regular shortening. These turned out good, but it seemed like something was missing and I can't quite figure out what it is. These also flattened more than I would have liked them to.

Wow, I've found it. This is a great recipe. I followed alot of other reviewer suggestions. I used 1 cup of butter. I also used a package of vanilla instant pudding. I made half the batch with rasins and the other with chocolate chips. Both are great, although if I make a batch with just chocolate chips I might omit the cloves. Over all great recipe and thanks for all the suggestions.

Very good recipe. I only used butter (not shortening and butter) and I omitted the raisins. Tasted great right from the oven and four days later.

The perfect chewy oatmeal cookie.  I added 1/2 t powd. ginger for extra spiciness and 1/2 c toasted slivered almonds for crunch.  Best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.

We love the "spice" in these cookies.  Smelled just like Christmas in the house while baking.  Mine spread a little; they didn't come out like the photo, but were really delicious.  YUM!

Be sure to soak the raisins in hot water beforehand! I had no idea they would make such a difference...the cookie was moist and the raisins plump not dry like usual. 

I didn't have any allspice so I added an extra 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 t ginger and 1/2 t nutmeg...the cookies came out perfectly flavored!

These are AMAZING! I only changed it by using 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger for a bit of a spicy cick. Other than that, this recipe is perfect just the way it is.

I had so much fun with this recipe.  The first batch turned out very hard and inedible due to my own fault.  I didn't give up and was rewarded with my second batch.  It was a big hit with my very picky family. Even my uncle who didn't care for sweets had two of these cookies.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Very good. I only baked mine about 8-10 minutes. One batch 8 and the other batch 10. They are soft and flavorful. I used craisins in case any of my guests don't like raisins. I make them into balls and freeze on a cookie sheet. I thaw and bake as needed. YUM!

these were excellent!  For a slightly healthier version, I used 1c whole wheat flour and a half cup white, used apple sauce instead of shortening and added ~2tsp of wheat germ.  I also used craisins instead of raisins, and that little bit of sweetness was perfect!

This cookies are delicious, chewy and very tasty.  
I made some changes to avoid some grease: i only added one tbsp butter, no shortening because is grease. Instead i added some other ingredients such as two tbsp unsweetened chocolate powder, one tbsp coconut flakes, one tbsp walnuts, 1/2 cup of a canned 100% pumpkin  and a little more cinnamon.  It turned out great!!!
Nice dessert for any ocassion.

Oh my goodness.  I'm going to go have to compare this to my normal oatmeal cookie recipe to see what I was missing... these were fantastic.  I used straight butter and tossed in cloves, cinnamon and allspice.  I also soaked my raisins in water and a little vanilla first...

Yummm! I didn't have any cloves and I also used regular shortening rather than butter flavored. I also used Smart Balance margarine rather than butter. So good, my boyfriend loved them and so do I! Thanks for sharing Beth!

These were good cookies, but not great. Based on the ratings I was expecting the best oatmeal raisin cookie ever. Instead I got a decent, if not just average, version. Definitely edible, but I'll keep searching for a better version.

This is soooooooo yummy! I made it when we had a trip and it's all gone in a snap! My former boss said it's delicious. I followed the other reviewers suggestion to add another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I soaked the raisins in a hot water for 20 mins to plump it.  I just used quick cooking oats and it still came out great! thanks for the recipe.

These are the most wonderful cookies I've ever made. I ended up having to substitute butter for the shortening when I found I didn't have any in my house (which was still wonderful). They really did make the house smell wonderful and they were all gone within 5 minutes of me taking them out of the oven :)

These cookies were quite good.  I used all butter as others suggested and used allspice instead of the cloves.  I also added a bit more cinnamon than the recipe asked for. I don't really make cookies because for some reason I don't have the best of luck with them. However, these were easy to make and were very good.  I will probably make these again.

These yeilds the most fantastic oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had! The whole family loves them. I suggest making a double batch because the first batch will disappear quickly.

This cookie is truly amazing even though I changed all the ingredients in the title. My kids were asking for choc chip cookies but I wanted to try this recipe. So we compromised. Took out all the spices and raisins and used choc chips and milk chocolate chunks. Kept all the other ingredients the same. They were crunchy on the outside and soft insides and sweetness was just right. I made 41 big fat cookies and it took me about 15 minutes to cook. Thank you Beth for sharing.

Mmmm...absolutely the best oatmeal cookies!  Like other suggested, I used all butter.  It gave it a nice buttery, soft taste.  Also, add an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Replaced ground clove with allspice. Baked them in the oven for 9 mins was perfect.  Nice crispy edges, but ohhh so soft, chewy and moist.  Two thumbs up!

Soft and taste great!  awesome with dried cranberries.  I only gave 4 stars since it's nearly identical to the recipe on the quaker oats lid.

These were just okay for me.  I think I just like my oatmeal cookies plain.  The taste was nice but I found the cloves a bit too overpowering.  Great texture and easy to make though.

I have made these twice now.  The first time I used all butter and they were nice and soft and very chewy (only leave in the oven for 9-10 minutes at the most)and delicious!!  The 2nd time I made them I took the other's advice and omitted the cloves for all spice added extra cinnamon and used a 1/4 cup butter flavored shortning because I was a 1/4 short on butter and the cookies were totally melt-in-your-mouth delicious!!  I think the 1/4 butter flavored shortning made the difference in the melty-ness and buttery flavor!  I will continue to use this recipe over and over again...it's a winner!

This is my all time favorite oatmeal cookie.  Great with raisins, dried cranberries, or dried cherries. The spice is just right. Sometimes I even add chocolate chips too.

This was the perfect oatmeal raisin cookie.  I made a batch w/ chocolate chips for my husband who dislikes raisins, but I only added 1/2 the amount of ground cloves to the batter.  I wasn't sure if the strong clove taste (which is great w/ raisins) would be good w/ chocolate.

So chewy and yummy! I used all butter, doubled the cinnamon, and added 1/4 t nutmeg and ginger. I also made them smaller so I had 72 little cookies, done to chewy at 8 minutes. I'm not even trying any other recipes, I can't imagine them being any better!

The cookies have great flavor, but turned out flat and almost impossible to not burn them. The only thing I changed was I didn't have raisins so I used milk chocolate covered raisins. I was quite surprised the over baked brown ones were very tasty. Your could smash them up and used for breakfast cereal.

WOW! These are amazing! After reading some of the reviews about cookies breaking apart I decided to let them cool almost entirely before transferring them to a wire rack. My cookies are intact and absolutely delicious! I had to substitute gluten free flours, used Bob's Red Mill gluten free Oats and added one teaspoon of Xantham Gum. Perfect! It's been years since I have had an oatmeal cookie and these were better than any I ever used to make (I worked in a bakery!). Like other reviewers, the aroma that fills your house is so pleasing. Put them in an air tight container fast after they are completely cooled or you run the risk of eating them all!

Next time I make these I am going to try to add just a bit more flour, maybe a half a cup, just to give them more body. But if you want a chewy, flavorful, complex oat cookie this is the recipe for you.

Very very good! I changed it up a bit though, I only used 1/4 teaspoon cloves, 2 cups of oats craisins instead of raisins and added a cup each of white chocolate chips and walnuts. Fantastic cookies!

Really great cookies!  Super flavorful with great texture.  I added a additional 1/2 of flour based on other reviews but I think next time it might be ok to leave it out. I also soaked my rasins.  The cookiese held their shape great and didn't flatten out.  I also added chocolate chips just for fun

These really are the best -- I made a batch for a bake sale, and they were so good, I made another for home. They freeze really well.

I added 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp nutmeg for even more spice, and take them out around 8-9 minutes. I'm making them again tonight and will try Craisins and chocolate chips instead of raisins. 

Definitely a keeper!

These were great.  My husband loves molasses cookies and I love oatmeal - these were a good compromise.  I used all butter as others suggested and also added an extra 1/2 t. of cinammon and a 1/4 t. of ginger.  I left the raisins out because hubby doesn't like them, but will use goldens next time because he doesn't mind them.  My kids could have wiped out the whole batch and that's saying something.  I used a teaspoon scoop to size my cookies and I ended up w/ 55.  Will add to my make again list for sure.

These cookies are incredibly delicious! I've had many that say they're the best oatmeal cookies that they've ever eaten! I make them with all butter, and I use 1 cup finely chopped pecans and 1 (10 ounce) package cinnamon chips instead of raisins. I'm sure these would be fabulous with raisins, though!

Very very very good cookie!  I ate four of the bloomin' things as they came out of the oven!  My only wish:  a fluffier cookie - mine were pretty flat albeit chewy, yummy, um um good!

I'm not a big fan of cookies, but made these for Thanksgiving. My family ate them right up! And my boyfriend made me keep half of them to the side for him to munch on. All cookies were gone within 3 days! Fantastic recipe. Don't leave out the cloves, that's the best part!

So glad I finally just looked up the best! Great job, Beth, loved the recipe! These were a big hit, as you can see from above reviews. I did bake mine on parchment paper and just removed the paper to a cooling surface (top of washer), not removing the cookies until they were completely cool, and this eliminated the "fall apart" problem I saw mentioned above- I've had that prob before! I was able to re-use two sheets through the entire recipe so the cost was minimal. BTW this was far more than 36 cookies when measured as noted I got about 50 and had started making them bigger at the end....

I've made this recipe a few times now.  These cookies are delicious!!  I might leave the cloves out next time to see what they taste like without them.  Also, the dough should be relatively cold.  I let it sit on the counter for a while and the cookies went flat because the butter/shortening had melted too much. I put the dough in the fridge for a while and the rest of the batch held up fine.  11 minutes was right for my oven.

These are delicious! Mine were done in about 11 and 1/2 min. The edges were just a little crispy and the middle nice and soft. Perfect! The only thing I did differently was use vegetable shortening instead of the butter flavored. Will be using this as my standby oatmeal cookie recipe.

great oatmeal cookie.  I did make a few changes.  First used splenda instead of white sugar to cut the sugar amount (used the brown sugar as stated). I also accidently used nutmeg (thought I grabbed cinnemon)- still added cinemon and it was good.  Also had no raisins only cran mix (nuts/cran/choc) and the cookies were still good.  I only baked for 8 minutes.  I think this is a cookie that you really can't screw up. Added Notes... I love these cookies make them all the time as the recipe states, but wanted to try to slim down the fat and sugar...and it works pretty well.  reduced the butter to about 1/3 cup and 1/2 cup+ appelsauce.  Did a loose cup of brown suger with two big spoonfuls of honey. Added some ground ginger and nutmeg to compensate for the less sugar..they are great.  The cookies should cook 10 minutes. They are obviously not the original DELISH cookies, but for the kids they are GREAT..

I love these cookies but I do cut the cloves in half since most of my family doesn't care for cloves.  I've also omitted it completely and used butterscotch chips instead of raisins - they vanish.

I made these for food day at work. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding additional raisins (we like a lot of raisins in our cookies) They turned out wonderfully.  My son would have eaten all of them if I would let him.  This will definately be our families oatmeal cookie recipe. Made the whole house smell great.

These were excellent. I made them for dessert for a dinner I was hosting and everyone loved them.
The only changes I made was to use all butter instead of shortening and I added chocolate chips and craisins instead of raisins.

Simply delicious!  I have made it many many times. All my friends and my family members loveed it.  To make the cookies  healthier, I used whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar and butter total down to 3/4 cup each. By the way, I used nonhydogenated butter, that is, butter made from vegetable oil so that there is no trans fat nor cholesterol. It still tasted wonderful. Thank you so much!

I am excited...these cookies are amazing!!! The best oatmeal cookies I have ever eaten.  After reading some reviews, I was concerned that they  might not be moist enough...so I added a couple of handfulls of coconut to the batter.  I also added about a cup of chopped pecans in place of the raisons, and a couple pinches of nutmeg as well.  Baked for 12 minutes since I made them jumbo-sized.  Made the house smell wonderful and tastes sooooooooooo  good!!!!!  LOVE these cookies!! :)

My Mom and I have been baking this exact recipe for over 60 years - they are excellent cookies and everyone always asks for the recipe. If you want to make these cookies absolutely incredible, make a frosting and put it between two cookies. In a mixer combine 1 box of confectioners sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla or almond extract, 1/4 tsp of salt, 3 tbl of melted margerine, and add milk until you get the desired consistency. Be sure the cookies have cooled or the filing will run off. Preparing these cookies this way will make them unfogettable. Be SURE you don't overcook the cookies. Just a tad brown around the edge will do. And place a piece of parchment paper on your cookie sheet before the dough. That way you can just slide them off instead of deforming them when they are done. I promise these will be the best cookies your family ever had. If you don't like raisins as some of my family does, just leave them out. YUM!

This is what an oatmeal raisin cookie should be. Tasty and hearty at the same time. As my husband said, "Hearty.".

Excellent recipe!  I followed the directions exactly, except I only used 2 cups of oats instead of 3.  They are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted!!  I will definitely be making these again!  Thanks!

they're ok but not the best. definately add more spices. definately put em in for 12 min so they get crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside still.

These are pretty yummy.  The only changes I made were to omit the raisins and roll the balls in turbinado sugar before baking.  10 mins. was plenty for my oven using rounded teaspoon full.  Thanks for sharing this!

Excellent!!  I must have dropped more than a teaspoon full of dough since it took a little longer to bake...more like 14-15min.

These were good. I didnt have enough raisins on hand, so i made some with raisin and some with butterscotch chips. These didnt spread out at all for me, so i made them a little flatter after i dropped them.

This is a GREAT cookie.  I added one cup corn flakes, crushed.  I measured one cup of flakes, put them in a storage ziploc bag and crushed them unitil they were about the size of oatmeal.This made them a little crunchier.  You could use any flake cereal.  I have tried it with a little more flakes, which made them even crunchier.

Best oatmeal coocike I have ever made! I added a cup of finely chopped pecans and they were amazing! We can't stop eating them! The only change I would make is to cut the amount of salt in half, but that is my personal preference.

WOW, the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had.  I'm not used to making so many cookies with one batch, but my friends at school were thrilled.  The crunchy outside but soft inside stayed that way even after they cooled.  I've been craving them ever sense.

easy easy easy. I replaced 1/2 cup all-purpose flour with barley flour.

EDIT: this time I added butterscotch chips...Mmmmmm, it is now a 6 out of 5 (and I used half cup rye flour).

Was never good at baking anything really. This is the first time i tried to bake cookies, made it for a camp and there were none left! i used Allspice and would probably use a bit more, used 4 cups of oats-turn out fabulous! Would note for 1st timers to drop a small round teaspoon and give at least 2 inches of space between drops as they spread! Thanks for a nice recipe for keeps!

Good, but not out of this world.  Could use some tweaking...maybe cinnamon & nutmeg next time.  I personally thought the cookie was too cake-like.

These cookies were perfect although I did make a few changes. I added 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp ground cloves and 1/2 tsp all spice and also used 1 cup of butter instead of the shortening. I also soaked my raisins in water for a couple minutes before I put them into the cookies. They were very soft but still held their shape and I had my family wandering in and out of the kitchen because of the aroma. This was a definate crowd pleaser.

Very nice recipe. They didn't seem quite done when the timer rang after 10 minutes but I took them out of the oven anyway. Well, they were and they stayed chewy all week. I substituted chocolate chips for raisins as my only change. Thanks!

Absolutely love this cookie! It's not uncommon for my dad to polish off a whole batch in a day! He asks me to bring them every couple of weeks! Thanks!

I am not a big fan of oatmeal raisin cookies but these cookies changed my mind. They are delicious! I used half the amount of cloves because I thought it would be a bit overpowering.

I loved the flavor of cloves but it was a bit too strong for others (like my children).  Excelent recipe.

I didn't have cloves so I used nutmeg instead, and I used all Becel instead of butter/shortening. I only had 1/2 cup of raisens so I also added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts for extra oomph. They were Delicious!! Everyone loved them even my fussy toddler!

These cookies were really good.  I very much like the change from the regular recipe, as did my fiance.  I like to use dried cranberries or other fruit instead of raisens to change it up.  Tends to enhance the flavor of the cookie.  I didn't think these were at all too spicy.  I'm even thinking that with the next batch I'll add in extra spice such as Allspice and/or Nutmeg (1/2 to 1 tsp of each).

Mine did not come out like the picture, they spread more than I thought they would but the taste was still amazing anyhow! Crispy outside, chewy center. So Good! I added about 3/4 a cup of chopped walnuts and used a level teaspoon of cloves since it is easy to overdo cloves. I thought it was perfect! Oh and I used all butter. It is the same recipe that was on the can of oats except for the cloves. They add a nice touch. Thanks for the recipe! I am putting them into a bake sale to raise money for cancer.

My husband said he didn't like oatmeal raisin cookies - but when I snuck these in his lunchbox, he came home and told me he loved "those cookies". Little did he know...

This is a great recipe. I am a health nut and don't use any refined flours or sugars, so I substitued whole wheat flour for the white stuff and used sucanat (evaporated & dried sugar cane juice - you can find it in your local health food store or natural market) in place of the sugar. I stayed true to the rest of the recipe and the cookies turned out awesome.

Yum! We enjoyed these warm out of the oven. I cleaned out my cupboarded and added white, milk & semi-sweet chips; dates and craisins. Delicious! These are one of my hubby's favorites. He likes that they stayed soft.

Excellent Cookies.. I Use 1Cup Shortning Because I'm Allergic To Dairy. And Add 1T  +1t Extra Flour Because Of High Altitude (6500ft). They Flatten A Little After I Take Em Out Of The Oven Probably Because Of The Altitude, Next Time I'll Subtract 1.5/8t-1/4t Baking Soda, Will Hopefully Do The Trick.. My Favorite Cookies I've Made Em 3 Times This Last Week. :)

This recipe made my day. I have Celiac Disease so I can't have any gluten (this includes oats). I was able to substitute quinoa (a gluten free grain) for the oats and gluten free flours for the all-purpose flour. They turned out really well. Even my husband who eats normal food thought they were really good.

Amazing cookies! I substituted 1/2 cup butter for the shortening and added 1/2 tsp. more cinnamon (personal preference). They were SOOO delicious!    Definitely the only oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I'll ever need!

The only thing you need to watch is the time! Do not over cook, or else the cookies will become hard. Cooking till golden brown will ensure chewy cookies.

I went with my gut instinct and decreased the cloves from 1/2 tsp to 1/4 tsp and it paid off. It would have been way too overpowering in my opinion. However, the cookie itself was delicious, by decreasing the cloves it gave it just enough spice. Soft and delicious. great recipe!!

YUM!!!  We had a huge party and I decided last minute to make these.  Good idea.  Everyone just thought they were grabbing a regular old oatmeal raisin cookie, but when biting into them realized it was so different and so much better!  Definite 5-star.  I did pop them in the freezer for 20 minutes first, and I also did add more baking soda, and will add a little more next time, as I like mine pretty plump.

These cookies really taste great, but the recipe is not really any better than my mom's, which also includes cloves. I'm not sure what I did, but these cookies did not look very pretty, they were very flat and underbaked if baked for the suggested 12 minutes. I have to save five stars for recipes that both taste great and have eye appeal.

Awesome recipe! Thanks Beth :) I added some walnuts to mine. Very flavorful and moist. Hard to ration the kids to only 2 at a time!

JMO, I don't think it's fair to give less than 4 stars if you alter the recipe.

These cookies are so good I have eaten practically half the bacth that I made since yesterday. Although they were a little bit spicy because of the cloves for my taste but they are still delicious. Next time I'll use less cloves and maybe a little more cinnamon. I also soaked the raisins in water for a little bit and this made a difference in the cookies texture.

Great cookie!  I have been looking for an oatmeal raisin cookie that had it all, and this is it! Perfect texture and taste. For those who thought it was too thin, I add 1/3 tsp. of baking powder to some cookie recipes; these turned out just right.

My boyfriend and I baked these cookies and he really loved them.  The flavor of the spices with the raisins is terrific.  But I personally prefer a thicker, chewier cookie.  These were still chewy and good, but pretty thin.  I ate mine with some ice cream, which was really good - they'd probably make good ice cream sandwiches!  I baked on parchment for 10 minutes and then checked them.  They were still WAY too gooey in the middle so I left them in just another minute and that little time did the trick.  They stayed chewy the whole week that they lasted between my guy and me!  I'll be making these again, upon his request.

Excellent....not too sweet and very tasty - kids love them - in fact I have made two batches in two days as they were such a hit at home and work....definitely keep to 10-12 minutes cooking time and used all-spice instead of cloves.

I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of the raisins, I was out.  So I'm giving this a 4 only because I think they would have been better with the raisins.  I did add some pecans to part of the batch and really liked those. I ate them warm so I'm sure they will be ever better after they cool and crisp up a bit. I have a convection oven so I baked them at 325 for the full 12 minutes. They still seemed a bit undercooked but I think after they cool they will be just right. My boys loved them.  The spice amount was just right as well.

I have found the ONE!  I will never make another oatmeal cookie.  These were fantastic!  I didn't have cloves so I used allspice and the aroma was sensational.  Thanks for such a great moist cookie!

These are delicious.  I was looking for a good cookie recipe (not chocolate or PB...needed something different!) and these looked like 'it'.  I started making the recipe purely as it appeared--I used both butter and Crisco, while I am normally just a Crisco for cookies person.  But, then  I decided to melt the butter...per suggestions, for chewiness...and then I added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, just for fun...and a tbsp of molasses, to darken and moisten just a tad.  The turned out great--not too much spreading at all, chewy, good texture, nice flavor.  I got about 3 doz exactly--although the recipe should specify just how much picking in the batter you MUST do...!  I added more than 1 cup of raisins, and next time will try walnuts or pecans, too.  Thanks!

Wow!These were really good!
I always melt the butter in my cookies- it makes them chewy, and also I use all brown sugar.
I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips!  These were great! They only lasted about 1hr.
Thanks Beth

mmm, GREAT oatmeal raisin cookies!!  i substituted margarine (the lower calorie kind) for all of the shortening and refrigerated the dough for about an hour before baking because other people had complained about spreading.  well, there was no spreading here!  the cookies baked up moist and delicious in about 9 minutes.  also, i got like 50 good sized cookies out of this, so i don't know what the "36 servings" is all about (those must be huge!)  kudos to beth for something else too.  i LOVE burnt-bottomed cookies and always purposefully "overcook" a tray or two for my own personal enjoyment. :)  anyway, with these cookies, the soft (NOT overcooked) ones are MUCH better!  they're so moist and flavorful ... we're loving them!  so don't overcook and if you want to use all margarine, it works great -- just refrigerate the dough!

I didn't have the exact ingredients so I modified the recipie a bit and these still turned out great! I used stick margarine instead of butter, dark brown sugar in place of light brown  and I left out the clove. This is just the kind of cookie I was hoping it would be... moist and chewey, not cakey and hard.

Absolutely Fabulous!  I doubled the spices - b/c I always do - and they were terrific!   I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose (just trying to make things healthier).  Really, really great.

These are delicious...I soaked the raisins in a bit of rum for extra flavor and baked them just until light golden brown and they stayed chewy for as long as they lasted (which wasn't long)!

Wow.  Absolutly delicious!  This recipe was so incredibly easy (thanks to that lovely Kitchenaid!!)  I used all butter and I skipped the cloves and cinnimon and added a rounded tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice.  They came out amazing.  This is my permanent oatmeal cookie recipe.

These are some of the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had and I am so excited that I can make them whenever I want with this recipe! I did use all butter with this recipe (I didn't have any shortning), and they were delicious. I don't know if I'd even use shortning next time. I soaked the raisins in boiling water for about 20 minutes before adding them to the batter- which makes the raisins very plump and tender. I took these cookies into a sales meeting along with Beth's snickerdoodles and the big fat chewy chocolate chip cookies (my favorite) and the oatmeal cookies went first! Thank you so much for this great recipe.

The first time I made this, it was awful and I threw it away. I decided to give it a second try, thinking it HAD to be my fault. And it WAS something I messed up the first time. Since then, I have made these about 5 or 6 times a year. The cookies are very flavorful and moist. They're one of my favorites!!

These cookies had a good flavor but were hard to deal with.

Batch 1 spread out into cookie puddles that would not hold together even when cooled. I had baked at 350 for about 15 min. 

Batch 2 baked at 375 - went from underdone to overdone in about a minute.  These don't taste good overdone.

Batch 3 also baked at 375 finally turned out right, but had to keep very close watch on them.

I thought the cookies tasted good but don't feel that they are worth the constant watching.  Seems that they have to be timed just right.

sorry guys, but I did not think this deseved the high ratings everyone has given.  I have tried every oatmeal rasin cookie recipe known to man, trying to get away from the one on the back of the quaker oats canister.  I loved the added spice of the cookies, I was not thrilled with the texture. Maybe I did something wrong- but I thought they did not hold together well, and got too soft the next day, even though I stored them properly. As I usually bake for my co-workers, presentation is very important to me, and this just did not look good, even though the taste was ok.

Good!  I was a bit nervous about using 1/2 tsp cloves but it really tasted good and wasn't too strong when combined with all the other ingredients.  When you bake these cookies just right they have a nice crisp outside and a soft chewy center - very good.

THESE COOKIES ARE THE BEST!  We don't like raisins, so I left those out.  We didn't have chocolate chips or nuts, so I left those out as well and just made the plain oatmeal cookies.  I substituted nutmeg for the cloves.  They were moist and wonderful.  I made them yesterday and now I'm making another batch because the first one is gone!

I doubled this recipe so that I could give them out with other cookies at Christmas.  All of my friends heard rave reviews about these cookies....unfortunately, none of them got to find out for themselves b/c my boyfriend and I ate them ALL!  Absolutely the best oatmeal cookie I have ever eaten.  Beth, you deserve a medal.

These cookies were good, but they were not what I expected after reading all the 5 star reviews.  The cloves add a nice touch of flavor, and they do stay moist even a week after making them.  However, I made a second batch of cookies using the recipe on the bottom of the Quaker Oats lid, and those cookies are 5 star!!

These are great!  I've been making them for about 2 years and I always get rave reviews.  They're fantastic!  I boil the raisins in some water for about 15 minutes before I add them.  It makes them moist and gives them a great texture.

Excellent soft and spicy oatmeal cookie...they turned out perfect!  I added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp of cloves, and additionally I added a 1/4 tsp of ginger!

if you see a recipe that was submitted by Beth Sigworth, you can bet its worth trying.  I have YET to try a recipe by her that wasn't 5 star.  This recipe is exactly as she describes it... chewy and spicy... and little crisp on the outside.  Thanks Beth for another winner!

I always get great reviews with this recipe.  The cloves make them just distinctive enough while still tasting like a classic, chewy, oatmeal raisin cookie.

Good cookie.  Four stars only because I have a better recipe than this one.  Maybe I'll use dark brown sugar next time.

Like others I used all butter. I didn't have cloves, so I just used cinnamon. The first batch were only so-so. The cookies turned out very flat and spread too much. However, I froze half the batch by dropping teaspoonfuls on a cookie sheet and when I baked those (for an extra 5 minutes), they were alot better - they baked in nice heaped rounds. 

Next time, I will try adding choc-chips instead of raisins. It's a very nice chewy cookie.

I was a little disappointed with the outcome, perhaps I built my expectations to high, the reviews made them sound like they were incredibly, earth shattering cookies.  I felt they were too cakey and much too fluffy, a bit unnatural for an oatmeal cookie.  The cloves and cinammon did add a lot of flavor to the cookies, but I feel these cookies definitly aren't the best in town.

These are absolutely wonderful as almost everyone has said.  The spices are perfect and really what makes them so wonderful.  As she has said...DO NOT OVERBAKE...perfect, perfect, perfect!!!  My husband hates raisins and ended up actually complimenting these.  What better review could you get.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  I followed everything to the tee, except, after reading all the reviews....I decided to make a double batch.  LOL  Thank goodness I did!!

Wonderful recipe. The spices are a great touch. I made these for my family and my office Christmas party. They DEVOURED them - nothing left but crumbs!!! My mom even asked me to make another batch for her co-workers. They couldn't get enough. I cooked mine for about 8-10 minutes, depending on the size, because my oven gets really hot. Don't walk away, they brown pretty quickly, and they finish baking outside the oven.

Ohhhhh yea!  Spectacular, fabulous and divine!  Thanks for a wonderful, lip-smacking, shake-your-groove-thing recipe!  I added 3/4 c chopped walnuts, used all butter instead of shortening and they were so very delectable.

My grandson is allergic to peanuts, so I had to find a really good homemade cookie for him.  This is it!  I've been making them since he was 9 months old.  His first sentence was, "You go cook."  I haven't changed a thing, but when I give these to him, he says "Wahoo, cookies!"

These cookies are the best!!  I had to make them two times in the same week and discovered that if you use a little less rolled oats - the cookies come out a little softer and chewier.  These cookies are a new family favorite.

The taste is quite simular to our Dutch "speculaas". (I tried shaping them into balls before baking. I liked them better just by dropping some of the mixture on a cookiesheet)
However, I think this kind of cookie has to be crispy, not chewy!
I will try other recipes.

This is exactly the oatmeal cookie recipe I have been searching for. I've made at least six batches since I first discovered it. They're great with chocolate chips / Craisins & raisins / broken up chocolate-covered almonds / or even a mashed over-ripe banana. I make them with non-hydrogenated margarine instead of butter and shortening so that I can avoid those trans-fatty acids, but they turn out surprisingly well, despite the substitution. Thank you SO much!

These were delicious; my coworkers gobbled these up.  The spices are what make the difference in these cookies.  I followed the advice of several others reviewers and lessened the amount of cloves, which I also felt was too much.  These were wonderful and will absolutely be making these again.

WOW!! These were wonderful!!  I made a few changes and they turned out really good!  I added 1 1/2 cup chopped coconut (my husband hates coconut, but he keeps commenting on how good the cookies are and he can't seem to figure out why !!)    I also added 6oz. chopped white chocolate in place of the raisins.  With the oats  I used half old fashioned and half quick cooking.   It gives a better texture.   These are my new favorite!!

I don't give out 5 stars very easily!! This is the best raisin cookie that I've made.  If I could choose one "pig out" food for me, it would be oatmeal raisin cookies!!  So, juding by that comment, you know this is good!!

This has become our favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.  Though about half the time we leave out the cloves, but with or without them it doesnt change how much we enjoy them.

These cookies were good.  I will definitely make them again! They were much better the day after I made them. I was disappointed when I ate one right out of the oven, but the next day they were perfect! There's nothing totally spectacular about them, but I doubt I'll ever use a different recipe for oatmeal cookies. These were yummy!

I thought that they tasted wonderful.  The smell reminded me of my mother's gingerbread. However, others said that it was too spicy for their taste. If I made them again, I would reduce or eliminate the cloves.

Delicious!  I've made this twice now, first a half recipe (in case we didn't like them) and then two days later a full recipe.  My wife and I pretty much inhaled them.  The full batch made about 75 cookies but I was using a batter scoop for the first time and I might have made the scoops too small.  Anyway they made great small cookies.  I reduced cooking time to about 9 minutes so they'd be soft.

These are excellent! (far better than the recipe on the Quaker Oats package, which is sickeningly sweet)  Cookies are crunchy around the edges, chewy in the middle, and leave you wanting more.

Like others, I modified Beth's recipe a little, and thanks to the fabulous base of ingredients/proportions, these cookies turned out beautifully. I only had quick oats, used regular shortening, and used 1/4 tsp each of cloves and nutmeg. Maybe because of the different oats, my cookies spread quite thin, but retained the perfect crispy edged/chewy inside texture. GREAT RECIPE- thanks!

These are excellent!  Make sure to let them cool on the cookie sheets for about 2-3 minutes before removing or they may fall apart.  These cookies taste wonderful with extra raisins.

This is exACTly the recipe I was looking for.  These cookies are very chewy and the ground cloves add a really great flavour!  An extra cup of raisins makes them extra special!  ;)

These tasted really good, but hardened up a bit by the second day.  I would make them again, though.

Best Oatmeal Rasin Cookies I ever had!!! Everybody loves them. Let the rasins sunk in rum instead of water and they turned out twice as tasty.

I ended up with crunchy cookies, not soft/moist like I expected, but my entire family can't keep their hands off them.  Apparently, they are quite a success.

This is a great recipe! I, like the other bakers was not big on the cloves in the mix. However, I just added 1/4 tsp of cloves and it was great! It gave you just a hint of the taste. My family loved them all! This is a keeper and I will no longer have to look for the Best Oatmeal Cookie Recipe! Thanks for sharing this with all of us!

This recipe has slight variations in amounts of ingredients on an old family favorite recipe I have---but it produced cookies with greatly improved texture!  I did add an extra 2 T of flour to make them a little puffier (so they won't flatten completely as they cool from the oven)  But they turned out chewy, delicious, and nice looking.  Thanks a bunch!

Excellent!  Got rave reviews from my guests.  I omitted ground cloves b/c I don't care for it.  Added dash of nutmeg, ground allspice and some extra raisins as suggested by another reviewer.  I bet they'd be good with some chocolate chips too!  Oh yeah, I used all butter, no shortening.

A very tasty cookie.  I omitted the spices and raisins but added macadamia nuts and choc. chips.  I was looking for an oatmeal cookie that spread out and was crispy.  This wasn't it but was very tasty anyhow!

Personally, i thought this cookie tasted better the next day, or even 2-3 days later -- the cookie became super soft and developed a flavor that's not there right out of the oven. Therefore, a good cookie for mailing out!

I have reviewed this recipe before, but it's soooo good I had to rate it a 5 again.  I also use this for OATMEAL CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES! Only changes - no spices - regular shortening - and 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips!  Just ate two out of the oven with milk.  Just can't beat um'! ;0)

I'm not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, but these were *really* good. They were extremely easy to make. I recommend baking them no more than 7 minutes - the cookies get crisp pretty quickly. I made the cookies very small, though, so that may have affected the bake time. My only complaint is that these cookies don't stay soft for very long - even though I put them into airtight containers while they were still warm.

I used this recipe for one of my Christmas cookies.  It was a hit with everyone especially my husband.  He couldn't keep his fingers out of the cookie jar!! I made two substitutions.  I used Molasses sugar instead of brown sugar and only 2 1/2 cups instant oats.  They were fabulous.  Thanks Beth for the recipe.  I will use this one all year.  C.Ferris in China

Do yourself a favor and start with a double batch...you will be making more! These were phenomenal. I used regular shortening and didn't add the raisins. my boys love chocolate chip and I usually make oatmeal for me, but they can not get enough of these cookies...a second batch is on the way. Thank you Beth!!

Best Oatmeal Raisin Cookie I've ever tried.  I soaked the raisins in 1/3 cup of rum overnight prior to making the cookies.  The flavor of the rum blended well with the cinnamon and cloves.

Made this gluten free/ dairy free/ soy free. Used Bob's Red Mill gf flour, ghee/ lard for butter/ shortening. Only used 2 c. gf old fashioned oats otherwise the same. Came out wonderfully. Only thing else I would change is trying more flour as it needed more batter to not fall apart. I noticed this when I used reg. flour as well which is why I decreased the oatmeal to 2 c.

I didn’t want to buy shortening, and have the end of a big jug of coconut oil eating up counter space. So used half butter, half coconut and they turned out great.

I can count on this recipe to turn out amazingly delicious cookies. Oatmeal raisin is my husbands favorite. The last 2 batches I’ve made for him included a little something extra special ... I soaked the raisins in bourbon for an hour before adding them to the dough. He told me these were the best oatmeal raisin cookies he has ever ... mind you ... ever eaten.

I didn't make any changes and these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  Cooked exactly 10 minutes and they were perfect.

Even though I prefer chocolate cookie to the oatmeal raisin one, this recipe still made me impress. Most ingredients were just at the point for me. One thing I did different from the recipe was, that I cutted down 1/3 of the sugar, because  I didn't want cookies to become super sweet. Anyway, the result was pretty good, and if you don't like something too sweet, I suggest you also consider to reduce some sugar just like I did.

This recipe is really easy for children to learn. It also has a good taste, at the same time, it is not bad for our health.

Great cookie, love the texture.  The only change I made was using Pumpkin Pie spice which is a combination of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves.

I have made these twice now. Once with regular flour and once with gluten-free flour and they were both excellent. The g-f batch did not suffer AT ALL. I did add a bit more spice because I liked where they were going but wanted to take them further. So instead of 1 tsp cinn, I used 1&1/2, 3/4 tsp cloves, then I also added 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ginger. I left out the raisins in the g-f batch because those family members don't enjoy them. I guess you could add choc chips but I am currently rebelling against the addition of the darn things into just about EVERY recipe, it seems. These cookies stand up well without the chips or raisins. They are wholesome and very tasty!
From now on I will always make these with g-f flour and then we don't have to have two separate well-marked plates of treats…something that somewhat isolates those with special needs in their diet.
Update: I no longer need to cook for g-f but now I need to cook for pre-diabetic. Sooo... I replaced half the fat with applesauce and reduced both sugars by 1/2. No icing of course. I personally don’t enjoy overly sweet cookies and I think these are WONDERFUL in this form too. Sheesh! What a versatile recipe!

An excellent recipe overall.  I substituted French Vanilla extract for the plain, this added extra depth to the vanilla undertones.  I   also soaked my raisins in bourbon (rum would also be delish!) before adding to the mixture. The recipe didn't call for nuts, but I added chopped walnuts.  The oven temperature and cooking times were spot-on.  I used parchment paper on my cookie sheet and was able to easily lift the cookies by hand with no sticking.  These were by far the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

This recipe was pure PERFECTION!! I have finally found a Cinnamon Oatmeal Raisin Cookie that worked. I have tried many but this one was bang on. I followed it almost exactly. Only one small change. I did 1 tsp of Baking Powder instead of Baking Soda. A BIG BIG Tip:  Do NOT over stir. I didn't use a mixer at all. I did it all by hand and just stirred until it was combined. Do NOT over-stir!! I believe this is the secret to the success. My cookies came out moist, golden brown, and roundish NOT flat like all the other ones i've ever made :)  THIS IS A KEEPER FOR LIFE!!! LOL ;)

These came out great! I used muffin tins instead of a cookie sheet to make more consistent serving sizes. I just increased the baking time to 12 minutes. If using silicone, no need to grease the muffin pans.

FLAT!! Great flavor, but FLAT cookies, though I did take advice of many other reviews and used all butter. I believe this would easily be remedied by adding 1/4-1/3c more flour.

These cookies are delicious! Due to not having raisins or butter flavored shortening, I made substitutions on those two ingredients (craisins for raisins and butter for the butter flavored shortening), but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My husband said they are the best oatmeal cookies he's ever had. Thanks for a great recipe, Beth!

Great recipe!!  Only change I made was to use all butter. Certainly will make them again.  Next time I think I will try it with dried cranberries instead of raisins just to give them a little different taste. I really don't understand some of the negative reviewers who claim to be good bakers and can't get this simple recipe to work out.

I make this recipe every year at Christmas. They are fool proof and fantastic!! I never liked oatmeal raisin cookies before I tried this recipe. I don't really look at the time when they are in the oven; I just keep an eye on the cookies themselves. I take them out when they look ready and they are perfect every single time. Everyone now looks forward to my cookies at the Christmas parties and get togethers we attend.

I cannot eat eggs so i have never actually tried these. However, i have been making these every December for the past several years and they are always a hit especially with my kids! I never use shortening so I just use 2 sticks of butter. This year i used a ¼ cup of whole wheat white flour along with the 1 cup of all purpose flour. I also mixed in some sweetened cranberries and cut down by both sugars just a but. Still a hit!

Awesome. I used Olivio instead of butter and shortening. I left out the cloves and added more cinnamon. It is also great with carmel syrup added to the top of the cookies right before they come out of the oven.

Be generous with the spices, and add a teaspoon of nutmeg.

My father grew up on his grandmother's oatmeal cookies, but unfortunately the recipe died with her.  I made these for him for father's day, and he loved them!

Perfect oatmeal raisin cookie!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I just substituted regular crisco.  And I added about 1/2 a teaspoon of cardamom because I love the taste.  This will be my "go to" recipe from now on.

These are without a shadow of a doubt THE BEST oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted. Ever. Seriously... EVER. I saw a comment about them coming out soggy and honestly, I have no idea how that could happen if you follow the instructions. I left them for about 10-11 minutes with the heat a bit higher and they came out hard on the outside, but soft on the inside. I used ground walnuts because I had no raisins in the house and OH.MY.GOD. The deliciousness!

I just made these cookies and they turned out awesome! Light and semi crispy but still chewy. I always use organic cane sugar instead of the more refined sugars and I find it makes them even tastier. I followed the recipe exactly except I added chopped pecans. Super yummy!

Fast and easy to put together. I did use all butter instead of the shortening.  My brother strongly objected to a batch being taken to the girls at work.

I used additional spices (nutmeg, ginger) and 1 1/2 raisins. Its an excellent recipe and when so many (3000+) like anything on this website, its always good.

These were delicious! I used 3/4 brown sugar and 3/4 stevia powder instead of the listed amounts. And added 1/2 teaspoon more cinnamon.

This recipe is really good, but the only reason I rated it a 4 is because instead of using the shortening, I used Organic Ghee.  I also used a gluten free Multi Purpose mix instead of regular flour.  I LOVED the flavor! The cloves really puts it over the top. Thank you for sharing.

A M A Z I N G!!!  Tried these yesterday and they were sooooo good.  the only change I made was to use craisins instead of raisins because I had a bag of them on hand, and used the whole bag, so about 2 cups.  Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing recipe! Perfect oatmeal cookies! EXTREMELY VERSATILE RECIPE.....I was out of eggs and substituted pear apple sauce....didn't have cloves either so I used nutmeg...didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used butter and the cookies were the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever had (and maybe even the BEST cookies I have ever had). Next time when I actually use all the ingredients stated I am sure they will taste even better! This recipe is phenomenal thank you so much.

I make these using only 1 cup butter, no shortening. This is the ONLY recipe I use to make these cookies and I get compliments every time I make them. I also took the advice of some other people on here and soak the raisins for about 20 minutes in warm water. My husbands office asks me to make these all the time.

I used all butter since I didn't have any butter flavored shortening, also, I halved the recipe.  They are good cookies, they remind me of spice cake somewhat of which I am not a fan, but I'll definitely finish these off.  My only two observations:  Firstly, the recipe says to drop rounded teaspoonfuls, which is WAY too little, more like rounded TABLESPOONFULS.  Once I realized the error, I used the cookie scoop that I bought which is about a #40 disher which is 1.5 tablespoons (go to wikipedia and look up scoop utensil for disher sizes), and that was much more appropriate.  Secondly, for those of you having trouble with them falling apart, my guess is that they were not baked long enough.  I put in two cookie sheets, and after 12 minutes the cookies on the top rack were lightly golden and held together fine after cooling for 2 minutes then removing from the cookie sheet, but those on the middle rack wanted to bunch up and break and were still too pale, I put them back in for a couple more minutes and then they were fine.

I was craving oatmeal raisin cookies, so I did a search on this site and found this recipe. I read some of the reviews before making them and about 99.9% were favorable, so I went for it.I halved the recipe because I was only making them for myself.I ate 6 and wanted more, but had to stop.They are delicious!

I adore these cookies. Chewy and tasty. I use the best spices I can buy, and just shy of the 1c of raisins. I cant help but eat more than my share of these with every batch. They freeze good and still come out chewy when thawed. I use all butter, no shortening as I don't keep it in the house, and amazing!

These cookies were very, very good! They stayed soft and chewy the whole time they were in my cookie jar. I made these cookies on a whim just because I felt like baking. My husband hates rasins in ANYTHING! But he ate most of these cookies. He loved them. I will be making them alot this holiday season.

Per other reviews, I also used all butter. I used equal parts whole wheat and white flour, and added a few tablespoons of ground flax seed just for kicks. These are great!

I really liked everything about this cookie. I baked at 325 convection for 8 minutes-nice and soft and chewy. As is, this recipe is 4 stars because it lacked flavor. It became a 5 star recipe when I used half quick cook oats and half rolled oats,  and 1.5 Tbsp. apple pie spice for flavor-I like my oatmeal raisin cookie to be more of a spice cookie.

Great! I know I'm changing my mind again... but better than Chewy Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies recipe. Actually, I adjusted that recipe to basically make this one, but the addition of cinnamon and cloves really makes it come out on top! I used all butter, and none of that fake shortening. Also, the temperature is correct because if you bake them any lower (325 degrees), they will be too thin.

I used all butter as I can't seem to find shortening in Australia. Soaked 1 cup of raisins in whiskey over night which resulted in 2 cups of very plump and whiskey filled raisins. Also added 1/2 cup of coconut to help give it moisture. Pretty darn good!

I always like to try recipes with greater than 1000 reviews/ratings and still better than 4 star rating.  This is one of those and certainly a keeper.  Made delicious soft oatmeal raising cookies.  When I want to make Oatmeal Raisin Cookies this is the recipe I will be using.

Thumbs-up from all. Tried 3 different versions just for fun after reading about all of the revisions from everyone. (BTW...Cloves and cinnamon make the cookie, loved the flavor. ) 1. Recipe as is, but substituted butter for the shortening. Probably why mine turned out a little flat. 2. Previous + chopped pecans. Hubby LOVED, says the nuts cut the sweetness a little so you can "eat more cookies" :) and 3. Previous with nuts + chocolate chips. (Couldn't help it, just had to add chocolate) and they are awesome, but very rich. Thanks so much.

WOW...If I could give it more stars I would!! THANKS for sharing...the ONLY thing I changed was only 1/2 the raisens( because my family doesn't care for raisens) I did chop them up smaller before I added them so you wouldn't bite into a big piece of raisen...even my husband and neice loved them and they don't like oatmeal cookies!!! this is a definate keeper!!

Let's put it this way...  third dozen is baking right now, and the first dozen is already eaten!  That's how GOOD this recipe is!  When I read "cloves" I was a bit worried, but the spices put this recipe over the top.  My only sub was all margarine (no shorting or butter in the house).

Thanks for sharing!  HIGHLY recommended!

Delicious!!  I used 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and added a cup of white chocolate chips.  Also baked for 9 minutes as several others suggested and flattened a bit.  These are fantastic!

Admittedly I did not eat the cookies myself as I made them for my husband and his work... but judging by how quickly they disappeared, they were pretty delicious! Only thing I noticed was that I had to leave them in a little longer than indicated- between 15-18 minutes.

I am vegan so substituted a few things but wanted to leave my review because the base of this recipe is fantastic! I used 1/3 cup Earth Balance margerine and 1/3 cup coconut oil, used organic brown/white sugars, omitted the eggs and added 1/4 cup unsweet almond milk, added a little nutmeg and ginger, and reduced the flour (whole wheat) by 1/4 cup. These were amazing, soft and chewy, wonderful recipe that can be altered without changing the taste tremendously...thanks!

These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies!  As someone who does not like raisins, I originally found this recipe to make for a friend, and it has now become my most requested cookie!  My only change is to use all butter, as many other reviewers did - it makes it very easy when I halve the recipe.

My whole family loved this cookie. I used all butter and they came out with a crispy outside and a chewy center. I left out the cloves (personal preference) but the cookie was not lacking flavor at all. I used large flake oats which give the cookie a hearty bite. I made larger cookies dropping about 1/4 cup of dough per cookie. You will need to bake them about 12-14 minutes if you go with the larger ones. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Very nice cookies. The ground cloves added a nice spicyness to it. I also added dried cranberries in addition to the raisins. It was very nice.

I used a full cup of butter and these cookies are awesome.  I have to admit this was my first attempt at baking oatmeal raisin cookies and I couldn't belive how good they are.  Plus the scent of the cookies smells great while that are baking.

The best recipe, who cares if its on the back of the oats like some other reviewers have commented.  I used allspice since I had no cloves.  Little secret I read somewhere, soak the raisins in hot water for 10 mins, makes a huge difference.  Thanks Beth!

These are wonderful!  I used pumpkin spice in place of the cinnamon and cloves (my pumpkin spice has both, plus a few other spices).  I also plumped up the raisins in warm water, and used all butter instead of shortening.  These are easily among the best oatmeal-raisin cookies I have ever had!  The kids and my mother in law could not stop eating them.

Like some others, I don't use shortening, so I used all butter and they turned out great.  I also discovered I only had 2 cups of regular oatmeal, so I made up the difference with steel cut oats blended into a flour.  I figured we're eating the cookies for the oats, so using oat flour is a healthier alternative than regular flour. Husband loves these cookies, even though he normally doesn't like oatmeal.  I may use more oat and less wheat flour next time.  I also added some walnuts for added nutrition.  This is a great recipe.  Thanks Beth!

Warning: dieters stay away! These are pretty much irresistible.   I added an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar since I was low on brown sugar. Also used all butter and baked for 10 min.  Perfect!

I've made these cookies twice now and both times they have turned out super tasty and chewy.  I add slightly more raisins than the recipes calls for as I am a raisin fanatic.  Overall this is the best oatmeal cookie I've had.

These were delicious! I think the base recipe is probably great (and as some reviewers said, very similar to the Quaker Oats box recipe), but I did make some modifications. I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in place of 1/2 a cup of the all purpose flour. I used craisins instead of raisins because I had a ton of them lying around. I also wanted to use up some chopped pecans and white chocolate chips, so I added a cup each of those. Since I'd added all this the dough got too dry, so I added 1/4 cup of applesauce. Then the dough was too wet, so I added 2 tablespoons of flax seed. Seriously yummy!!!

The cookies I make are delicious however they are very soft and puffy in the center, not flat and chewy all over like the picture.  I have done the recipe exactly minus the cloves and also with all butter.  How do I get them to look like the picture??????? Thanks.

These are great cookies I made a slight change by covering the raisins with boiling water for 5 min. then draining and drying them, I also added a bit of nutmeg as I love that spice.

Wonderful! Not too sweet. I did use a full cup of butter instead of half shortening, because I didn't have any on hand.  I will be making this again.  And often.

If I could give this recipes more stars, I would! My favorite cookie EVER is "Grandma's Homestyle Oatmeal Raisin" and I've wanted to make something similar for years. Every recipe I've tried didn't satisfy.....until I tried Beth's! It is soooooooo fantastic. Spicy, soft, chewy, MELT IN YOUR MOUTH good. You won't go wrong with this recipe. Everyone who has tried them has raved over them. I add a little extra cinnamon and clove to suit my taste. The recipe as is is AMAZING...I just like a little extra kick. :) Make, enjoy, and SHARE! (you'll probably want to eat the whole batch yourself...lol)

This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe!  These cookies are soft, chewy and addicting!  I didn't have cloves, so I subsituted the cinnamon and cloves with an equal amount of "pumpkin pie seasoning" which was a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  The nutmeg and cloves added a nice rich-ness in flavor to a regular oatmeal cookie recipe.  These were fantastic (I've made them twice in the last month) and I will definitely make them again!

These cookies were awesome!! I didnt have butter flavoured shortening so I just used no salt butter instead. I also had to substitute allspice for cloves. My husband and kids both loved them so much they were gone before I knew it! I am doing another batch today!

Great recipe. However I did make some changes. I ommited the clove and added chocolate chips, walnuts and extra rasins.I also doubled the butter and didnt use the shortning. They turned out great. The ones I baked at 12 mins were more cake like and the ones I baked at 10 mins were more chewy.

A 1/2 tsp of cloves sounded like way too much.  Cloves are a strong-tasting herb, and if you like it you should use it sparingly.  And I was right.  I added a little less, and the clove flavor was still way too pungent for my tastes.  If you left out the cloves, it would've been perfect.  I always use 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of shortening to cut down on the fat, and it works great with this recipe.  Moist, chewy, yummy ... minus the cloves.  My husband agreed; next time, cloves will be left in the pantry and out of my cookies!

I rate these 4 stars because as someone else pointed out, this is a copied recipe and to be honest, they are better without the cloves.  Without, they are a superb oatmeal raisin cookie.  Also, the yield is 48 teaspoon cookies, so halving it makes a nice batch for home.

Delicious, but way too soft. I made them with a butter/oil combo and had to bake them longer & at a higher temp. And even then, they are sticking together in the cookie box!

I wondered about cutting the fat and just found virtually the identical recipe to this in my Better Homes &Gardens book. It uses 1/4 cup less butter + baking powder as well as soda. Think I'll try that--healthier that way.

These cookies were wonderful.  I did use a whole cup of butter per other reviews.  The only reason I am giving this recipe a 4 star is because I think the cloves are a tad bit overpowering.  I like the flavor, but I think next time I will maybe use a 1/4 tsp of cloves.  Other than that, they are yummy.  Perfect texture, I took mine out at exactly 10 minutes- a little crisp around the edges, but the rest of the cookie is soft and chewy.  *Oh- I also soaked my raisins in the eggs and vanilla while I was gettting everything else ready.

I've made these cookies twice. The first time, I took the advice of all the reviewers and used all butter, soaked my raisins, etc. What I ended up with were thin, runny cookies that were very flimsy and too soft. This time, I followed the original instructions, but I baked them for 8 minutes. They were absolutely perfect! Just crispy enough to hold together, but not hard and crunchy. The raisins were juicy and tasty! I think the problem the first time was that by soaking the raisins, it added more moisture to the cookie, which caused it to be like a flat pancake. I also believe the smaller the "drop" the better. This made 68 cookies for me, not the 36 that the recipe states. My "drops" were just over a heaping teaspoon. One last thing...I ran out of my old fashioned oats at 2 & 1/4 cups. To make up the difference, I had two packets of maple & brown sugar instant oatmeal laying around. I put it in and OMG it worked and they were awesome! Hands-down the BEST oatmeal cookies I've ever had!

The best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I also added extra spices....but I like my oatmeal cookies cinnamon-y! Yum!

My boyfriend hates all sweets except oatmeal raisin cookies, which he is extremely particular about. These cookies (this recipe makes a LOT) disappeared SO quickly... couldn't believe it! They smelled like heaven and tasted even better. Definitely a keeper.

These were delicious. I used all butter instead of shortening, as per other reviews. I also used 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg instead of cloves because I didn't have any on hand. I used a disher equal to 1 Tbs. and the cookies cooked in approx. 11 minutes. I also got many more cookies this way. The biggest thing to remember about oatmeal raisin cookies is that if you want them chewy they need to look a little under done on the baking sheet. I found that there was no extra liquid necessary and I was also able to add about 1/2 c. extra raisins with no adverse effects. Will definitely make these again.

So very delicious and chewy :)

I used all butter! no shortening
Substituted the light brown and white sugar for all brown sugar
Substituted all purpose flour for whole wheat flour
I did not have any ground cloves so I used extra teaspoon of ground cinnamon instead

Baked for 10 mins and they were perfect :)
Make sure you drop teaspoonful!
If you make them larger the bake time will have to be changed

They were soo good and chewy
Maybe next time I will use 1/4 less cup of sugar because I thought it was sweet enough from the raisins
I also cut the raisins in half because I personally don't like large raisins

Soo Good I will definitely make it again

Thank you for the wonderful recipe :)

Delicious, soft, and chewy. I substitute the raisins for walnuts, though, since my husband isn't big on raisins.

Made these cookies last night and the flavor was really good.  Didnt quite like the texture therefore will try them again (was using someone else's oven) at home.  Overall,  a very good recipe.

excellent, the cloves make all the difference by adding a complexity to the flavor.  I used cranberries instead of raisins. Also used 2 sticks of butter as others recommended.  chewy and crispy.  mmmm  mmmm mmmmm...

Yum!   I used all butter and instead of raisins used cinnamon red hots.  So very good!    (if yours spread out too much...your butter was too melted.)

These cookies are excellent!!  I had it in my head that I wanted to make oatmeal blueberry cookies, so chose this recipe for the base.  I used 12 oz. white chocolate chips and about 1 & 1/2 cups dried blueberries.  
While they were very good, I couldn't really taste the blueberries, probably should've used more?

My husband and I have both made this recipe several times, and they always turn out beautiful. Sometimes I use a 1/8 cup measure to put them on the pan, sometimes I use a tablespoon. They both produce large cookies, but the tblspoon size ones are more child friendly. 
Our family loves this recipe! thank you!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I do use the extra spices that some other reviewers mentioned.  One thing I like, to set these apart from the rest, is to substitute dried cranberries for the raisins.  Fabulous!

These were great cookies! I omitted the butter and shortening replacing them instead with applesauce and a teeny bit of cottage cheese and they still came out great. I just had to keep them in the oven about 5-8 minutes longer.

This is the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had. The only thing I changed was I used 1 cup of butter because my work (assisted living place) don't use shortening. Residents and staff just loved these cookies.

very good.  I omitted raisins and added a little bit more oats, maybe 1/8 cup.  Try placing the cookie drops into muffin cups on the baking sheet.  I did this because I wanted to use my black metal pan and easily re-load it, but it was a very nice surprise how it kept the sizes uniform, was super easy to remove them, they had a nice brown crispy bottom (until kept in airtight container where they all became one blob) with soft top, and the cupcake cups acted like little serving plates AND kept them from sticking together during storage.  HOWEVER I made double the number of servings indicated, so mine were small and cooked exactly 8 minutes.  I used all butter, no shortening. *** Next time I made them I had no butter so I used all margarine and made them the indicated size for yielding 3 dozen.  The outcome was more of a muffin than a cookie when I made them in the muffin wraps.  More of a springy cake than the chewy cookie I had last time.  Both ways are very good, as a "muffin" I had to cook them for 12 minutes and yielded 3 dozen.

I had to use normal shortening, but I couldn't taste a difference. I also added 1/2 t nutmeg for some extra spicy. 

After adding 3 cups oatmeal, I thought the batter might be too thick, but no worries--they turned out great!

AWESOME!!  I changed one small part since I didn't have butter flavored shortening I used 1/2 cup butter and a 1/2 cup of regular shortening and it was fine.  They are a little strong on the spice, FYI,  but I loved them!

I tried this recipe immediately upon running across it because of the 5 Star Ratings.  In a few reviews I read, it said to cook it only 9 minutes for a soft and chewy cookie.  I cooked them for 12 minutes and they're still too soft.  I don't particularly like the ground cloves taste which is very noticeable in the cookies, so that influenced my opinion of the overall cookie.  I definitely don't believe this cookie rates a 5 star unless you like ground cloves and undercooked cookies.  I think I'll stick with the Quaker Oats Cookies...they taste better like an Oatmeal Raisin cookie should.

HOLY JEEPERS THESE WERE TASTY...wow great job on the recipe. I decided to add 2 mashed bananas and I just started throwing in a ton of spices. Cardamom, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, etc. Also, with the bananas, I had to add another 1/2 cup of flour. I too boiled CRAISINS, not raisins. Overall, SUPER wicked recipe:)

Loved these cookies, they were just what I was looking for.  I, like some others, used all butter and no crisco.  They were chewy and delicious.

Awesome cookies!  And just to comment on some previous ratings...this is NOT the same recipe that is on the quaker box.  I have that recipe in front of me (as I am using quaker oats) and there are several differences.  Mainly that there is shortening in this recipe and not in the quaker recipe at all.  The small differences really make a difference :)  Wonderful cookie!

Amazing! Tasted great warm out of the oven, and even better the next day! Perfect texture and a nice presentation, and even though I over-baked mine by accident, they were still chewy a day or two later. Great flavor! They tasted like cookies from a bakery the next day when the flavors had melded.  I will make these many times, and will definitely make them as written, no need for changes at all!

I used regular shortening instead of butter-flavored shortening, because that's all I had.  I omitted the raisins because I didn't have any.  I used 1 cup of all-purpose flour, and 1/2 cup of 100% whole wheat flour.  Very minor changes.  I make them a little bigger, using a metal ice cream scoop to put them on the cookie sheet.  And I let them cook for 13 minutes.  In my oven, that still leaves them a little raw on the inside, which is how I like to bake cookies.  I like to let them set that way.  Makes for firm but soft cookies that melt in your mouth.  For a long time I've been using the "Soft Oatmeal Cookies" recipe by Bittersweet1 on this website.  No disrespect, but this one is better.  I think I've found my main oatmeal cookie recipe.  Thanks Beth.  They were delicious, even without raisins.  It's the spices that win me over.

These cookies are so yummy! The only thing I did differently was I put in 1 cup of softened butter instead of 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening. They are delicious and I definitely will be making them again and again!

YUM!! I used all whole wheat flour and doubled the cinnamon...and they are deeelicious! I also used all butter because I didn't have any shortening. You don't even miss the white flour...and it makes the cookies just a little healthier (I'm always trying to sneak healthy things into dishes for my 2 yr old picky eater). Thanks...definitely a recipe I will use again!

The taste and chewy texture are fab. But mine spread like crazy... Could be my fault. I used margarine because I didn't have butter on hand.
Will definately try again sometime.

This receipe made the BEST oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever tasted!!  Followed the recipe exactly with only one simple change: used my cookie scoop for dropping the batter on my sheet but batter was very stiff so pressed the cookie top slightly flat (batter doesn't flatten during the cooking process).  Perfection!

This cookie is THE reason I finally decided to sign up with this site.  I'm known in my house for being able to bake anything under the sun, EXCEPT for cookies...  Something ALWAYS goes awry when I'm making cookies, but this time was completely and amazingly different!!  

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I really didn't mean to toy with it at all.  When I got to baking though, I had to make a couple substitutions.  I didn't have butter-flavored shortening, so I used the normal golden variety.  I didn't have cloves, but instead used allspice.  I used a "heavy hand" when adding each flavor (vanilla, cinnamon and allspice) because I'm a spice nut.  And I mistakenly doubled the baking soda, but it didn't hurt the outcome one bit, so I'll be sure to add a bit extra again next time.  Also, my oven runs really hot, so I turned the temp to about 315, and they cooked perfectly in 11-13 minutes.

THANK YOU for the amazing cookie recipe!  To the lady who's batch didn't turn out, I think it probably would have been fine if you'd kept the dough out of the fridge.  Before making cookies, I've heard it's beneficial to have room-temp ingredients, even the butter and eggs. :)

These cookies are pretty darn awesome! They didn't brown up a lot on the top for me, but maybe that's because I only used 1/4 cup shortening, combined with 3/4 butter. They taste fantastic though! I also used allspice instead of cloves as my picky husband doesn't like cloves.

Used applesauce in place of the shortening, but left the rest as is, and these were GREAT! Loved the added flavor and softness from the applesauce, and didn't miss the extra fat at all.  I've finally found my go to oatmeal cookie recipe.

Love this recipe!  Made this using 1 C craisins and 2 C of semisweet chocolate chips and the cookies were chewy and moist, simply divine.  These cookies got raves from everyone else too!  I did skip the cloves and cut back a little on the cinnamon

These are delish!!!!!!!!!!! no need to search for another oatmeal raisin cookie recipe, perfect the way that it is. However I love nutmeg and cinnamon , so I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1 1/2, cinnamon and some pumpkin spice in  place of cloves I also added pecans. But this is a great recipe  that would still be great with no changes. Only thing don't over cooked unless you like crunchy cookies.

Everyone who tries these cookies says they're better than the ones their grandma/mom/aunt makes!  Like other reviewers, I use 1 full cup of butter instead of half butter/half shortening.  I also use dark brown sugar instead of light and ground nutmeg instead of ground cloves (because I couldn't find ground cloves anywhere!)  These cookies are just the right amount of crispy around the edges, chewy inside, rich and completely delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!!

UHHH-MAZING! This recipe was uber easy to make as well. However, I didn't have butter flavored shortening so regular shortening worked just fine for me. I really dislike raisins so I substituted for about 1-1/2 cups milk chocolate chips, added just a pinch of cardamom and nutmeg and voila! So yummy, tasty, soft, chewy, delicious. Will definitely be making time and time again.

Very good, maybe not as chewy as I generally like, but the flavour is really nice

Edit- I have since tried these again and had much better luck with the texture, nice and chewy! Not sure why they turned out cakey the first time but this time they were bang on!!

This recipe is missing a crucial ingredient: liquid.  There should be about 1/4 cup of water.

The first time I made these I accidentally put a half cup extra white sugar in them, but they turned out quite good anyway. I also used blueberry flavoured craisins - yum!!

Very good recipe. I added a cup of walnuts and substituted all spice since I didn't have any ground cloves. My family loved them.

Delicious - I followed recipe exactly since it was my first time. I used old-fashioned rolled oats, not instant or quick. The cookies had a lot of texture. Next time, I may change it up by playing with the proportions of oats - maybe 1/2 old-fashioned and 1/2 instant. I would like to keep them chewy but not quite as textured. Can't wait to try it again!

Made a double batch as I always like to share.  I made half with craisens and white chocolate chips.  The rest I made plain.  These are delicious.  I baked them on parchment paper which I love to do with cookies for fast and easy cleanup and cooling.  These are perfect chewy oatmeal cookies, you can't go wrong.

These are great. The white sugar addition makes for a crisp outside. I made, w one recipe 24 small 1 tsp sized cookies AND 6 x 4 3/4" diameter giant cookies like in the bookstores! The change I made was to sprinkle some terbanado/(or Demerrar)sugar on the tops of the large ones (it's much more granular) Great addition to dress up the tops.

They tasted good but I thought that they were just a little too tough. It may have been because I didn't use shortening and instead just used butter so that might have made a huge difference.

DELICIOUS!!  Followed the recipe with the only exception being that I substituted 1/4 cup wheat flour for white flour so I could make it a small fraction 'healthier'.  First batch I cooked at 12 minutes and was too gooey.  Next batch I went 14 minutes and still plenty of chewiness.  Great flavor.  Will definitely be making again.  I think you should easily be able to go up to a 1/2 cup wheat flour without getting too dry or cakey

I have been looking all over for an oatmeal cookie like this!!!!  I haven't had one as good in 7 years (I lived in Ca. from a popular bakery)  Even my hubby who hates raisins said they were the best he had ever had.  I will be making the next batch for him per his request with chocolate chips instead of raisins, YUM!!!  As per reviews I soaked the raisins to plump them up.  I didn't have any cloves so I added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  Plus I used all butter instead of shortening.  Cookies were soft but had that sugary crispyness to the edges!!!!  Melts in your mouth!!!!!!!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!  My eight-year-old son had been devouring them and pestering me to give them five stars.  I'll definitely make them again.  They remind us of the cookie part of oatmeal cream pies.  NOTE:  I used 1 cup of butter instead of half butter and half shortening.  I also added a tad more cinnamon and cloves.

made it gluten free by using an all-purpose gluten free flour.  All the spices in the cookie helped to mask any tastes from the gluten free flour substitution.   EVERYONE including myself loved these cookies.  Also added dried cranraisins-  awesome.

These were really good.  I loved the extra spice and that the cookies stayed moist inside and crisp around the edges.  Used cranberries instead of raisins.  Also, mine took a couple extra minutes in the oven.

Oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite, but I had a request from a friend... so, when I found this recipe with so many glowing reviews, I figured it was worth a try.  I just finished the first batch... and I have to say ~ they are scrumptious!  I followed the recipe to a T... The only apprehension I had was in the formation of the cookies... the dough is VERY gooey and doesn't exactly form into a nice ball... instead I just sort of dropped clumps of dough on the cookie sheet.  Mine definitely don't resemble the photo - but instead they are thick snowballs of gooey goodness... I'm not disappointed and I doubt my friend will be either!

Very tasty cookies!  However, my cookies were quite thin and fell apart after they cooled.  I used all butter and let the dough chill as many had suggested.  Could this be why?

These cookies are always a hit! I use golden raisins and all butter rather than the shortening. Be sure to use light brown sugar. I tried using dark, as I am usually partial to the flavor, but it was too overpowering for the oatmeal.

These a really good! We are eating healthy and I substituted sucanat in for the sugar. I also did not use shortening and just used 1.5 butter sticks total. Very good recipe!

I soaked the raisins in warm water and honey to make them a little more moist, and ended up refridgerating the dough overnight, so I think that was the reason it took 11 minutes for my cookies to finish baking, rather than the 9 that other reviewers mentioned.  The cookies came out great, soft, moist and delicious.  I am making this recipe from now on

It's not that it's the recipe from the oatmeal box, it's the recipe from Sunmaid Raisins, plus cloves.

I made these just as the recipe states and they were FANTASTIC! Just a reminder--the cookies wil set up a bit while cooling, so don't worry if the middle seems a little soft when you take them out.

As expected, super good. Used all butter instead of shortening.  Had to keep a careful eye on the oven to not under or over bake.  Came out perfect.

Excellent!  Substituted coconut oil and butter mixture for the butter flavored shortening, since I didn't have any on hand - otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, with GREAT results!

Really yummy! I took out the raisins as I didn't have any. The only thing I changed was that I had to add a bit of milk to the mix as it was really crumbly, but they still turned out well.

Very good recipe which makes great cookies. Instead of Crisco I used a cup of butter....added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla. Didn't used cloves don't have any. The one thing that needs to be done is once the batter is done put the fridge for ten minutes. This makes a big difference and ur cookies won't run together.

These cookies are SO moist it's insane!  Love these so much.  I made them for an office party Halloween Trick or Treat event for coworker kids.  I was the only one in the office to bake something and not bring store bought candy.  These were all loved.

Holy cow these are good.  I reduced the ground cloves because we have Penzey spices and they are a tad too strong for cookies.  Also someone wrote that these fall apart too easily.  Make sure you have good Baking Soda - not too old because that can make a difference.

Have made this twice, once exactly as written and the second time adding an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a pinch of ginger. I also add chocolate chips and use all butter. They are really good cookies, but I just find perhaps they are missing a little something, cant figure out what. Maybe I will try adding some nutmeg next. I bake them for 9 mins and cool for 2, They stay nice and soft in an airtight container. They actually taste even better the next day! Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious cookies! I used all butter (melted) and may try half butter and half coconut oil next time, and I used allspice instead of cloves and added a tablespoon of vanilla. I found the baking time was best around 8 minutes. And not only are the cookies excellent, the house smells divine! Thank you, Beth.

I used a combination spread (butter and olive oil) because it was all I had at the time. The cookies turned out cakelike so I wouldn't recommend using the "healthier" butter. Next time I will definitely use the shortening and mix with butter as the recipe calls for.

Loved these! DON'T use a vanilla pudding mix as one review suggested without cutting out the vanilla or unless you sure like your cookies sweet. My mom went nuts for them, so I will defiantly make again. I left out the shortening, and used butter instead.

Did not like the use of shortening in this recipe. It made the cookies taste like any mass produced store bought bakery cookie. While they didn't taste bad, they didn't taste like a real homemade cookie. I'd consider trying again with all butter instead of 1/2 cup shortening.

I made these w/out the flavored crisco, just regular, and no raisins-- and the flavor is WONDERFUL ! Mine stuck to the pan, and that was a huge mess--so I greased the pan after that. They were very crumbly for some reason and fell apart way too easy, but OMG they're still amazing! Excellent recipe other than the crumbly part!

Awesome cookies! I didn't have the flavored shortening so used all butter & don't like raisins so I substituted butterscotch chips...they were so good. This is definitely the recipe I'll use in the future for oatmeal cookies =) Thanks for the recipe!

Great cookie! Soft and tasty. I used butter in place of the shortening and took other reviewers suggestions of soaking raisins for 10 mins in hot water, adding 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and reducing amount of clove (reviews made me nervous but I think it would have been ok as original recipe indicated). Baked for 10 minutes and had to resist the urge to put back in the oven to bake longer as they did not look done...so happy I did not because the cookies turned out perfectly at 350 for 10 minutes. I baked 30 cookies and am freezing the remaining dough for a treat at a later date!

I LOVE this recipe!  I do just 2 things a little different:  I soak the raisins in the 2 eggs and the cloves and cinnamon for up to 4 hours.  Then just add that into the creamed sugars when it calls for the eggs.(My talented neighbor's suggestion) The raisins plump up and aren't so chewey.  Also, I add 1/8 C flax seeds.  Just to throw in more nutrition.  I skipped it one time and my 14 yo boy noticed cuz he likes to chew on them.

I definately give this a 5 star!  I made a batch of these last night and they turned out great.  By the way, I compared this recipe to the one on the Quaker box top and although they are VERY similar, the small amount of "tweaking" that Beth did definately made the cookies more tasty...so, for those who say they are the SAME, you are wrong.  Thanks to Beth...I went in my file and kept only this oatmeal recipe because my family said they can't get any better than this!!

Yummo. I used butter instead of shortening/butter, just because I don't have any shortening. I also added pecans instead of raisins. I was a little scared about using clove, so I used allspice and it wasn't too spicy at all.   As other reviewers have said, with butter only they are a bit crumbly. Maybe next time I'll add a little more flour.   Thanks for the recipe!

These are ssoooo good!  I have made them exactally as written and tonight I tried them with a few substitutions to make them a little healthier and they were still delicious!  I used nonhydrod.  olive oil based margarine in place of both the butter and shortening, sucanat in place of both sugars and regular whole wheat flour in place of white. They turned out great, I think the molassesy flavor of the sucanat added to the flavor, yum, yum yummy!!!!!!

I did not have shortening, so I used all butter, but the cookies did not bind so well, so in the second batch I added 3/4 cup sifted flour and I added 1 cup walnuts, then they came out perfect!

I'm giving this recipe a 5 because my husband loves them.  I also thought they were great, but I prefer a crispy cookie, while these were soft and chewy.  I wasn't sure about the cloves, so I split the batter in 2 and did cloves in one half and nutmeg in the other and they were both really good.  The clove flavor was so subtle, you could barely detect it.  I will make these again and won't be afraid to include the cloves next time.

I am baking these now.  My boys (that includes my husband) are gobbling them up as fast as I'm cooking them!!!  They are SUPBERB!  As the name suggests, they ARE spicy, so if you're not into all that much spice cut back on the clove.  I used all margarine for mine.  Next time I will try 1/2 shortening as suggested. Just to see the difference, I can't imagine them being any better!!! I baked mine on parchment paper too. Hint (since I was naive about it too):  Rolled oats = old fashioned oats.  Don't use instant or quick cooking oats.

If you want a traditional tasting cookie this is not for you. The cloves ruined it for me, but I understand that I am out numbered if I say don't make these, without cloves they would have been ok.

Excellent recipe!  The only change I made was to omit the cloves (didn't have any on hand ) and add nutmeg. They came out moist and flavorful.  I'm sure I will make these over and over again.  Next time I might try with choc. chips

Very good recipe as written. I was looking for  something to match our Harris Teeter brand. My rasins soaked for 10 mins in hot water to soften up. I had to use allspice because I only had whole cloves...still very good. The next time I will add toasted walnuts, more spices, and have my cloves on hand.

Like gourmet cookies when I used 1/2 C raisins instead of a whole, then I added 1/2 cup chopped crystallized ginger, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 Tbs ginger paste (in produce area of store), 1/2 tsp ground cardamom and 1/2 C dark chocolate chips

My 18 year old son found this recipe online and even went to the store to get the ingredients. He made them while I was at work exactly as written - they were absolutely awesome (the first recipe I've gotten from him, and probably the first thing he's ever made on his own!). The cloves really make the difference I think.

This is the perfect oatmeal raisin recipe. With oatmeal cookies I tend to overbake it or it looks like mush instead of oatmeal. The first time I follow the recipe to the T with the suggestion of soaking the raisins in warm water for 10 mins. The second time I added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper for an extra kick, half a package of vanilla instant pudding, and used all butter. It turned out great. Yummy!

These are amazing!  I made them exactly how the recipe says.  My husband is currently serving in Afghanistan and I sent him a care package with these cookies.  It took 9 days to get there and they were still soft and fresh!

All I have to say is YUMMY!!!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening, so the only change I made was to use all butter instead and they were still delicious!  I will definitely make these again.

I LOVE oatmeal raisin cookies and this was the best! I picked on them forever. They were  soft and I soaked the raisins in water, made them taste sooo juicy.

These have a great flavor (keep reading) and I love the cloves in them. They even went over very well with others. I tasted them though, and immediately knew something was off-kilter. butter flavored shortening, that's what it was. It had an artificial taste that sneaks up in your mouth and ruins the rest of the tasty goodness. Next time I will make these with all butter.

Yummy! I changed it up a little though. I used raw organic sugar, all butter, and then added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I might cut the cloves next time as I'm not a huge clove fan and the flavor was quite strong. Good enough to take the place as my #1 oatmeal cookie recipe.

Fantastic!!!!  What a delicious cookie! We are a bit "wholesome" so the only slight changes I made to fit our dietary needs was using whole wheat flour, I took the all butter instead of the shortening suggestion and we use raw sugar, so I did that instead of white sugar and added a few teaspoons of black strap molasses to make up for the brown sugar. Amazing cookies! Absolutely delicious!

Soo good- really , really good and not over powering with sweetness. I used all brown sugar since I find that makes for a more chewy cookie. I also added some coconut and chocolate chips- thanks for a GREAT recipe

I think my search for a great oatmeal cookie recipe may be over! These are absolutely delicious—full of chewy, fragrant, nostalgic cinnamon-raisiny goodness.     I made them almost exactly as written, with a few minor tweaks that I think worked well: I soaked the raisins in just-boiled water for 5 minutes (this plumps them and prevents them from getting hard/dried out in the oven). I only used about 1/4tsp of the cloves but also added some powdered ginger, freshly grated nutmeg & allspice. And finally I used dark brown sugar because it's what I had on hand, along with high quality French unsalted butter + organic vegetable shortening in place of of the flavored stuff.     The only thing I might change is to add a bit more butter or shortening (or reduce the flour a bit) the next time around—these go from chewy & perfect to a bit dry rather quickly, and my best batch were the ones I took out when they looked dangerously close to underdone.    All in all, however, these were marvelous & I'll definitely be making them again!

These are great!  I used 1 cup of butter (didn't have shortening) and added 1tsp of cardamom powder (just because my family loves cardamom) and all I can say is YUM!  These reminded me of the oatmeal cookies that are used to make the oatmeal cream pies I loved as a child.

Delicious! I made a batch at 10 and one at 12 min, and I prefered the softer ones at 10 minutes. I also added extra raisins because I love raisins. A+.

I was sceptical because one of the other reviews and I'm a pretty honest person so I'm NOT sugar coating this review...Wow! These are by far the best cookies I've made! I only used butter (no shortening) and I took the advice from another reader and soaked my raisins in hot water for a few minutes before adding to the cookie dough-OMG these were the best! I baked for 9-10 minutes and I let sit for 2 minutes before I put in my tupperware to finish cooling.

OOOOoohhhhhh, are these cookies good!!  They are so flavorful, a nice mixture of spices that had my family coming back for more.  I, personally thought they were great the first time around, and didn't change a thing.  Watch your oven to be sure they don't cook too long.  Most of the oatmeal-raisin cookie recipes are too much like store-bought bland cookie frisbees, this one was out of this world.  I have saved just about ALL of Beth's/Mrs. Sigg's cookie recipes, she doesn't disappoint!

These were fantastic.  I used 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the spices called for (because I was out.)  Also, I made half of the batch withdried cranberries and half without any fruit.  All were a huge hit with both adults and children. It does make quite a few cookies.  If you roll the dough into a log and freeze in wax paper it is easy to slice and make small batches later on.

Followed the recipe, but had to add more flour since my butter was too soft.  I have never made oatmeal cookies before and noticed after I made them that it is pretty much the same as on the canister!  I think I like that one better!

best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. I didn't have raisins, and only had a little over half a cup of chocolate chips, so I added those and 1/2 cup of shredded coconut as well as 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. Without the changes the basic cookie is still fabulous!

Just made these today and this will now be my go-to recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies.  Followed exactly as stated except I doubled the recipe and used 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of the cloves, and also grated in a little fresh nutmeg since I had it.  Baked on parchment paper for about 9 minutes and they were perfect.  NOTE:  Don't try to make these too huge - my first batch I wanted really big cookies but they thinned out a little too much - keep them smaller (my perfect ones were doughballs a little smaller than a golf ball) and they stay more puffed-up.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

I was very disappointed with these especially after the great reviews! The clove didn't go at all and was almost overpowering even thought I added a bit less than called for. The bagged oatmeal cookies that I usually make are ten times better with half the effort! Sorry but I won't be making these again!

Good recipe didn't have the cloves so im not sure if it's fair for me to rate this recipe although I must say It was good without.  My cookies turned out a bit on the hard side but I think that was my doing not the recipe.

these were amazing! I don't normally like raisin cookies but my sister wanted some and so when i made them for her i naturally had to try them and wow, i'm converted! These were great. I used all butter and only baked them for 9 minutes and they were perfectly moist and very delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!

These cookies are fantastic! This really is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried. I'm not such a huge fan of raisins, so I put half raisins, half chocolate chips. Family came over and tried them and they couldn't stop eating them! Thanks for sharing!

Great cookie. Nice crispy edges and soft center. I added a little allspice and ginger to mine. I love spice. I also subbed some of the sugar with molasses for a little depth. They were great. thanks!

Very good. I baked a batch as soon as I made the dough, those cookies spread out thin. Then I had to pop them in the fridge until the next day, those cookies did not flatten out. The baked much better than the first batch. Will chill before baking next time around.

I'm only giving this 4 stars becuase personally I think the ground cloves are way to over powering. I think next time I will either add less cloves or replace it with nutmeg. Other than that, they are very good, chewy and great for the holiday season. I also used currants instead of raisins, they are much smaller, but just as sweet. You can find them right next to the raisins if you want to try!

Very good recipe and the same as the one on the Quaker Oats box except for the added cloves and substituting 1/2 of the butter with shortening.  Funny to read how people quibble back and forth about whether it is or isn't that recipe.....sure reads like the one on the box of Quaker Oats I have at home!!!!!

These were good!  DH won't eat raisins so we used white chocolate chips but I think craisins would be delicious also.  We followed other reviewer's suggestion of using all butter and it gave us a lacy, crispy cookie instead of a chewy one.  I may use 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup butter flavored Crisco next time, just to give them some height.

This is one of the best oatmeal cookie recipes out there!  I actually had to make these twice.  The first time I used all butter & my daughter measured the flour & I think she did not fill it all of the way up because they flattened out horribly.  I am not sure if this was due to the sub of butter or the  possibility that my daughter was measuring.  The second time I did not substitute anything  except  using 1/2 whole wheat flour & half regular and I thought they turned out great.  These will be a regular in my recipe box for sure!

I thought this was very good with a nice chewy middle and crispy top, though I didn't think the flavor was very bright.  My friends all loved these though, I just thought it could have been more flavorful.

I hate to say this but no one who tried these liked them. To me they tasted like plain dry oatmeal. There was nothing sweet or dessert-y about them like you'd expect from a cookie. Even my mother-in-lay who LOVES oatmeal didn't care for them. I'd love to know what I did wrong because I can't get over all the great reviews here.  I guess I'll just have to keep buying the ready made dough available at the grocery stores to satisfy my oatmeal cookie craving.

Another *awesome* cookie from Ms. Sigworth! Thank you! I was looking for an oatmeal cookie yesterday and saw Beth's name on the recipe and stopped my search. As for my review, I did not have any butter flavored shortening so I just used regular. I don't like raisins so I used about half a bag of chocolate chips (mini). As I was putting the spices in, I had an incredible urge to put in some dried cranberries (Craisins). I may try that next time, since I like to follow a new recipe exactly the first time. The cloves are good but probably not necessary so feel free to leave that out, if needed. I will save that spice for when its Christmas time and maybe use pumpkin pie spice instead. Out of the 6 or so people who ended up trying these, everyone ate several. I made them about slightly more than tablespoon size and ended up making about 4 cookie sheets of 16-20. I will be making this again very soon. I baked them until they just started to get some color on them, about 9-11 minutes. Perfect! I let them cool, then put them in a tupperware. They are still sooo moist and soft today.

Very tasty! I think maybe adding a little more oatmeal might be worth a try.  I had a few runny cookies that didn`t get mix in with the oatmeal well.  Definetely worth a second try.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was just what I was looking for! A moist ,flavorful and chewy cookie. I used a 1 inch cookie scoop so I used currents instead of raisins.I like nutmeg-so I added 1 tsp of that. Wonderful and perfumed the air as they baked. Thanks!

This cookies are the best!  I used golden raisins and soaked them for 10 minutes in warm water so they would soften up.  The golden raisins are a beautiful addition because they have color varaitions of amber, green and purple.  I also added a little extra cinnamon.  They were delicious and do not last long at my house.

These are by far my favourite oatmeal cookies!  The only changes I made were instead of raisins, I used dried cranberries.  I also added white chocolate chips, which was a nice added touch!

WOW. These cookies are fantastic! I used the same recipe for the most part, but used dark chocolate chunks instead of raisins, pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and cloves, and a pinch of cayenne pepper for a kick on top!

Love these cookies!! I also added a pack of vanilla pudding to make them even more moist and chewy.  I'm not a big raisin fan so I used craisins and they were amazing!

Made these cookies this afternoon and used regular shortening because that's what I had on hand.  I also added a cup of chopped walnuts because my husband and I like nuts in our cookies.  This recipe is awsome, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, just the way a cookie is suposed to be.

Fantastic but you have to be very careful where you bake them in the oven.  I have baked these two times now and would advise you to not crowd the baking tray, push down on the blobs of cookie to spread them out a little, and only bake them on the middle rack in your oven.  9 mins works great so the bottoms dont overcook, any more than that and it will be too much.  I still found though that they were a little undercooked on the top, so after a little trial and error decided to flip them over as soon as the tray comes out of the oven and bake them for an additional 1 minute.  If anyone else has any other ideas would love to hear them.  I also added a little more spice for extra flavor.  These are great cookies that I will make all year round, not just over the holidays.

Very Good!  My dad loves Oatmeal Raisin Cookies and these passed the test.  Came out well when baked for 9 minutes and didnt have butter flavored shortening so I just used the basic vegetable oil shortening that I had on hand.

My husband does not like cookies or sweets but even he loved theee cookies!!  I did omit the shortening and add 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce.  I also had to extend baking time to 18 minutes.  My son asked if these could be Santa's cookies because they are so good!!

These are very good.  I scaled the recipe to make 48 cookies.  I used a tablespoon to measure out the batter and ended up making around 76 cookies, which is awesome because i burned 16 of them.  I used dark non-stick cookie sheets (do NOT butter them).  The cookies that burned on the bottom were placed on the bottom rack for 9 minutes.  So I would suggest only cooking them on the middle rack.  I used all butter and a package of vanilla pudding instead of vanilla extract.  (I was out. I tend to sub with what I have on hand).  Overall this is a good recipe, but next time I will add more spice than what is called for.

These are excellent!!  I had no shortening on hand so used one full cup of butter.  The recipe gave me 48 nice size cookies!  Took about 14 minutes to bake (things tend to take longer in my gas oven) .. nice taste and chewy!  Yummy!

I didnt have butter flavoured shortening so used plain instead.  Also had run out of cloves so used 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ginger.  I also changed the amount to 90 cookies. They are wonderful tasting cookies. Next time I will be sure to follow the recipe exactly

These cookies turned out awesome!!!  I did add a little extra ginger, and used golden raisins. I refrigerated my dough and rolled into 1" balls to add a little height, because the first batch in the oven did come out pretty flat.  The edges are crispy and the centers are oh so chewy and scrumptious. I am not a huge fan of oatmeal raisin cookies but I think these changed my mind!!!

WOW!These cookies are OUTSTANDING! I read a few previous reviews---not sure why people had problems with the batter being runny? All I can say is I followed this recipe exactly, except for the butter-flavored shortening, as I didn't have any on hand. Instead, I, like other reviewers, used all butter. My cookies baked for 12 minutes, came out perfectly moist and chewy. The batter was not at all runny, for me. Could it be the brand name of butter? Not sure---but also, I did soak my raisins for about 10 minutes in boiling water. These are my new favorite Oatmeal Raisin cookies...thank you Beth!

I was really pleased with these cookies! I followed the recipe, accept I cut the baking time down to 8-9 minutes. This kept them soft, which I prefer. I made them five days before Thanksgiving, then instructed my husband to stay away from the cookie jar so we would have some for the holiday. The cookies were just as good after five days!

I have made this recipe using all butter and following the recipe exactly, using the shortening. Butter is better. The cookies did not turn out any chewier using the shortening and the flavor is far superior using all butter. That, said, this is a very good recipe. I leave out the raisins and add walnuts.

The original recipe turned out to be way too sweet for me.  The texture was great.   I think next time I'll cut down the sugar by half.

These were really tasty.  They kind of fall apart, but still taste great.  Adding a couple of minutes to the baking time seems to help them stay more solid.  As recommended, I chilled the dough before baking.  I will make these again!

3 Stars- I followed recipe EXACTLY and these just were OK. My boyfriend ate them, but I did not. I guess I am just a Quaker Oatmeal cookie recipe girl. But, it was fun to try new things, I just don't think these were the cookies for me. EDIT: 5 Stars- I have since made these cookies again and I will admit I just used pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices and I like them much better. In fact they just might be my new fave. I am glad I did not write these cookies off. They have grown on me.

I love love love these cookies! They were nice and chewy but not too soft. I will use this recipe always!  Thank you Beth!  *My advice is to foil the bottom of your sheet, they brown beautifully!

Deeeeelicious! I substituted dried cranberries for raisins and added a dash more vanilla. Next time I might try pumpkin spice in them to mix it up a bit. Perfect oatmeal cookie staple recipe.

These are fantastic. I had never made oatmeal cookies before and was a little worried about consistency and dryness but no need to worry. The batter was so tasty I was excited to try the final product. The smell is so delightful in the house as well. I will be baking these again for sure.

These are the best! My only change is I don't like cloves, so I just up the cinnamon to a teaspoon. They are one of my most requested cookies.

This recipe is delicious! I used it to make a cookie cake for my Husband. The recipe batch is too big for one cookie, so be sure to cut it back. Use only 2/3 for the large cookie. I also cooked it at the same temperature, but for 10 min. and then take it out and let it sit for a while, it will keep cooking in the center. It came out perfectly chewy and tasted so good. My only ingredient switch was to used 1/4 tsp ground cardamon, and 1/8 tsp. ground cloves.

Delicious! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added a packet of vanilla instant pudding to the mix.  I've never done that before and WOW were they good!!  So moist and chewy, we ate them in no time!

Awesome cookie recipe!  Did not change a thing to the recipe.  The only thing I added was a cinnamon glaze that I drizzled over them - 1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons milk.

Awesome!! I didn't have butter-flavored shortening so I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening. I also used dark brown sugar instead of the light. FYI: Definitely soak the raisins first. A brandy or spiced rum soak is seriously good but water works well too.

Iv'e been making this cookies since 2006. Now and then I experiment. Sometimes I'll add 1/3 cup of cocoanut and 1/3 cup choc. chips. I lowered the cloves to 1/4tsp.I soak the raisins in warm water & I add 1/4 tsp cardamom,refrigerate for 1 hour.Also use  3/4tsp B.P & 3/4 tsp B.S.Original recipe is the greatest. I just like to experiment and they are great.Thanks Beth!

These cookies are awesome! I've made them several times, and I found using allspice in place of the cloves was a bigger hit with the kids. They bake perfectly and are so chewy and moist. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Extremely good. I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour though because they were too flat the first time around and easily fell apart.  The extra flour fixed the problem and the cookies were still really soft.  They were so good I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream between 2 cookies and they helped to make a really tasty ice cream sandwich!

These cookies smelled so good while cooking...I think it was the cloves.  I put raisins in half the dough and chocolate chips in the other half.  I ended up adding some extra flour because the cookies were a little flat.  I also had to bake them for about 12 minutes.  I used all butter because I didn't have any butter flavored shortening.

I made a few changes-- I used all butter and baked at 300 degrees. Takes only a few minutes longer- but yields a nice cookie. Fantastic taste! Add some milk choc chips too-- awesome!

Fantastic. I have never liked oatmeal raisin cookies, but i had about a cup of raisins that seemed they would never get eaten so i decided to get rid of them in cookies. I used all butter, allspice instead of cloves, and soaked my raisins in warm water. They cooked perfectly at 9 minutes and are chewy and soft with a slightly crisp outside. Perfect sweetness, perfect spice, just perfect. And, my kids love them. Great way to incorporate oatmeal in my picky eaters diet. Thanks Beth!!

These are my favorite oatmeal cookies. I used craisins and white chocolate chips in one batch and raisins with chocolate chips in another and they were both delicious. I prefer the version with just plain old raisins though! :)

I love this cookie recipe! I made them for the 4th time tonight for Family Home Evening. Kids love 'em, hubby loves 'em, and I could eat these all by myself. This recipe is great as-is or changed-up with your own add-ons, ex: nuts or different dried fruit. I've used this recipe with the dried cloves and without the dried cloves. Both are great. Going to try with craisins or dried cherries next time. Recommend that you pay attention to the cooking time. ALL OVENS are different. 10 minutes works for me, but may not for you. Happy Baking!

You know, honestly i didn't really like these when i first made them. I thought they were over rated. I still kinda do, but I could attribute that partly to the fact that I didn't follow the directions exactly. They weren't bad at all, they just weren't 5 star cookies. I thought they tasted too much like breakfast cookies. But I love them now, I can't stop eating them! What I did was: Instead of half butter, half shortening, I used half "buttery spread" half peanut butter( because I like peanut butter =] ). I also added 1 ripe banana (to get rid of it) and pumpkin spice instead of cloves. I also cut out 1/4 of the brown sugar, and sprinkled white sugar on top. So, in short, I give this 4 stars, due to my disobedience, lol. But I will try this again...the right way...minus the cloves. =]

These cookies were GREAT! I made 2 batches, omitting the cloves in both (didn't have any on hand), one w/ raisins and one with butterscotch chips for my cousins graduation party, and I totally had to stop my hubby from eating them ALL. I will definately use this as my new go to oatmeal cookie recipe! Thanks for posting. :)

This recipe makes a mighty fine oatmeal cookie.  Excellent ratio of oatmeal to "regular" dough texture.  For my batch, I reduced both the white and brown sugar by half, doubled the cinnamon because I didn't have cloves, doubled the vanilla, used dark chocolate covered raisins, and added walnuts.  Very nice!  I only baked for 9 minutes.  I baked different sheets of dough at 11, 10, and 9 minutes, and the cookies that sat for 10+ minutes were very dry after cooling.  The 9 minutes cookies stayed chewy.  I will definitely try this again with cloves.

I just made these cookies for my daughter's graduation party next week.  I made the recipe with margarine instead of butter to increase the fluffiness of the cookie.  I baked one dozen as a test and they did spread alot and were very thin.  I then added an additional 1/2 cup of flour to the batter.  The rest of the batch was perfect - thick, chewy cookies!  PS-I also increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp and added 1 tsp of baking powder.  Next time I will decrease the salt to 1/4 tsp.

These cookies are good.Easy..My 11 year old made with my help (her first cookie's!)That being said...I think they could use more spice & more raisan's.We will make this again but add more of the spices & add some nut's for crunch. Thanx for the recipe :)

I suddenly found myself having to bake cookies with very little time and a very demanding crowd! These cookies came up trumps! Having run out of raisins, I substituted dried cranberries and omitted the cloves, and even I loved them and I don't eat cookies! Looking forward to trying them the original way now!!

These were good, not the best, but good. 9 minutes seem to be the optimal cooking time. Any longer and they lost their gooey goodness.

Great recipe! I make a double batch every time and still can't keep them around.  I never use shortening, but use a shy 1/2 cup of coconut oil instead.  Thank you very much!

I FOLLOWED the recipe TO THE TEE and I wouldn't even call what came out cookies. It was all just mush shaped like cookies. I made another batch after the first one went horribly wrong and it came out the same.

The best oatmeal cookie ever! Only changes made were because of an empty pantry [not enough rasins, added currants and chocolate chips] The choices are limitless, made a batch which yielded 128 cookies;gone in just 1 day [4 kids and a family function] Thanks Beth.

Nice base recipe. Didn't have shortening, so used 2nd stick of butter. Also, added 1/4 tsp. ground white pepper. I like a SPICEY cookie! Also, parchment paper is a bakers best friend for those who hate doing dishes. Another tip for quick drop cookie making... dust off that old melon baller and put it to use! After my tweaking..make it 5 stars!

Wow, these are fantastic! I made some changes, because my coworkers don't like raisins and I only had 1 1/2 sticks of butter and no shortening. Oh, and no cloves, because I didn't have any. They were nice and chewy and oat-y and nicely spiced from the cinnamon. I made them a little bigger than the directions and baked for 15 min. Best cookie I have had in at least a year.

Excellent! Chewy and moist. I only baked until there was a mere hint of brown on the bottom edges and they were perfect. I suggest golden raisins soaked in water for about an hour, but make sure you thoroughly dry them.

My husband LOVED these cookies and could not stop eating them while they cooled. The only thing that I would do differently is eliminate the cloves and replace it with more cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg- it was a little strong for me. Other than that, a great cookie!

After hearing all the wonderful reviews on this cookie I thought it would be an instant favorite. I was disappointed though. The overall flavour of the cookie was ok, but I think the use of shortening really ruined it for me. The cookies tasted like something I would have bought at a grocery store bakery - very mass-produced and cheap tasting, not at all like a homemade cookie. I would possibly try again with real butter, but will probably just stick to my old basic oatmeal cookie recipe and modify it accordingly.

My husband loves these.   I made three different Oatmeal Cookie recipes and this one was by far his favorite!  They are soft and chewy with plenty of oatmeal flavor and not over baring with cinnamon. I made mine with QuickOats.  Next time I'm going to try the old fashioned oats and see which he likes better.

Who cares if this recipe came off of the Quaker's Oat Box.  It's DARN good and isn't that all that matters?  Make it the way the recipe tells you too and you will love your cookies.  Definitely my favorite recipe.  I added a cup of walnuts and let the dough rest in the refrigerator a few hours before baking.  I baked them for 8 minutes, perfect!

i have a small toaster-like oven and the temperature fluctuates terribly but these cookies are very forgiving and dont burn. made them when my husbands friends came over. they were the first homemdae cookies they ever ate (we live in s. korea) and they said we should start a cookie business. ^^ so, i'd say this is a great recipe!

This was a really good recipe.  I like my cookies spicy so I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and I added a 1/2 cup molasses for a richer flavor.  These are terrific!

This recipe is good nothing outstanding. I usually make oatmeal cookies using the quaker oats recipe which I will keep doing, that said, it should be rounded tablespoon, not teaspoon, comes out too small its like eating bite size granola.  Double the spices, I used raisins, but craisins are good too. I used 1 cup of butter since I had no shortening.

Great recipe!  I added a dash each of nutmeg and ginger.  These are the perfect combination of classic oatmeal/raisin and that holiday spice flavor.

These cookies were sooooooo GOOD!!! I made them with chocolate chips instead of raisins. I also didn't realize that I don't like cloves. lol! But they were still amazing. So the next time I make these they will just be regular old oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. No spice. lol! I bought them into the office and they were gone in 5 minutes.

A great recipe with the perfect blend of spices, but I would add at least 1/4 cup more flour next time.  They came out too flat and thin for my taste.

They come out perfect every time! I bake them for 10 minutes and thus they are soft and chewy. I leave out the raisins since my boyfriend doesn't like them. Don't be too stingy with the spices though: a little extra cinnamon or cloves never hurts the flavor.

I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting all butter vs. butter and shortening because I had no shortening in the house.  I thought they tasted great but fell apart on the cookie rack, so I added a little more flour maybe up to 1/2 cup to what batter was left and they held together better and still tasted great.  If you are making these with all butter, I would add a bit more flour.

Excellent, don't change a thing. I made some without raisins for picky eaters and some with raisins -both were chewy (undercooking for a couple of minutes is key to chewiness). To keep the raisins plump, I soak them raisins in warm water before adding to the mix. Thanks Beth.

As I am not a huge fan of cookies- let alone oatmeal cookies - I was extremely pleased with how these turned out - very moist!  And easy enough to bake with my 2 yr old daughter.  I will be making them again!  Thanks for sharing!

I used all butter instead of the butter flavored shortening, and used a mix of apple pie spice and pumpkin pie spice to equal the total 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon and ground cloves.  I also used cherry raisins and dried cranberries, 3/4 of a cup of each.  They came out so amazing and so chewy! This is definitely my go to recipe for oatmeal cookies!

I followed the recipe exactly, and I don't get all the rave reviews.  These cookies are borderline acceptable, and did not serve them to anyone else because they don't meet my standards.  I don't usually bake with butter flavored Crisco, and I assume that's what gave them the weird texture and taste.

Very good. I  used dark brown sugar and enjoyed the deeper flavor that sugar brings. Didn't use  raisins since I   wanted my   toddler to  eat these too.  Good snack for   him -  I   also   used "white  whole wheat"  flour  from King  Arthur flours.  Really  tasty. If you  don't use part crisco don't  be surprised if they taste and  texture is different. Crisco  esp.  lends  a  different texture  to  cookies  than  butter.

I'd love to say that I changed thisor that, but the recipe is perfect just the way it is. Although, I didn't get as many cookies out of the recipe as it claimed, however that might have been because I couldn't stop eating the cookie dough!

I've made this twice, and if I remember correctly, the last time went smoothly. This time I must have messed up because the batter runs everywhere so that I get nothing but a wafer-thin mess at the end. The only thing I did differently this time was soak the raisins (i also use dried cranberries) in warm water first, as another reviewer suggested. If this plumped them, I don't know and don't care. I think either the added moisture (I did drain and pat dry, but still...) made the batter too runny, or else the warmth melted the butter. Either way, of the 36 cookies this was supposed to make, I have only two that are still in a recognizable cookie shape. They still taste lovely, though.

AWESOME COOKIES!  I have never liked oatmeal cookies, but decided to use this recipe to make them to add to my Christmas goodies basket.  I tried one cookie and immediately decided to make another batch for me and my family to eat.  
I used all butter, allspice instead of cloves, and soaked raisins in warm water for 10 minutes.  They were so moist and chewy!

My cookies sort of melted and turned out very flat.  They were still pretty tasty and very popular.  Spices made it interesting.  Would make again.

Made these last night, and they turned out GREAT!!  My husband loves oatmeal cookies and said that these are, by far, the best oatmeal cookies I have made.  The kids could not keep their hands off of them. The taste was great and the texture is just right, just don't overcook because they will get crunchy after they cool.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!  This one is a keeper!!

Fantastic recipe!  If you have instant oatmeal on hand like I did, six packets will equal the three cups of rolled oats required; just cut the sugar by about a quarter cup otherwise they can get wicked-sweet due to the flavoring in the instant.  I used Quaker's 'Holiday Spice' but you could surely use Maple & Brown Sugar, Apples & Cinnamon or Regular Flavor...probably a couple other varieties, too!  They turn out a little flatter/chewier with the instant oatmeal but the cookie eaters in this house seem to dig that. ;)

I'm so happy I found this recipe again! I made these last year and they were so good. I wanted to make them for a Christmas party this year, and I must have forgotten to add them to my recipe box. I'm thrilled I found the recipe again, and made sure to add it. I do make some changes. I use unsweetened applesauce instead of butter or shortening to make them healthier. I don't care for cloves, so I substitute that for allspice. I also increase the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp, and add 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger, and 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice to make it just a little bit spicier. But these changes are not enough in my opinion to take away from a 5 star rating, since they are more due to preference and not due to a bad recipe. Last year I used golden raisins because that's what I had, and this year I used regular. Both are delicious. I lined my pans with foil for easy clean up, and 10 minutes in my gas oven was perfect for cookies that are just slightly cake-like, with just a hint of crispness. These are fabulous and I will keep this recipe to make again and again.

I was extremely disappointed in these cookies.  The cloves are horrible.  I should have known to omit the cloves, but, I thought I'd give it a try - big mistake.  The flavor is very overpowering.

Just made these with my kids and they came out wonderful!  I am not too fond of oatmeal raisin cookies, but I wanted to try something different.  These are by far the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is add a bit more cinnamon and maybe a touch of nutmeg.  Great recipe!

This was a good recipe to start, but I made a few modifications.  I found that it was a little bit too dry, so I cut back the oats to 2 cups and added another 1/4 cup of milk.  Also, I skipped the granulated sugar as it was already very sweet with just the brown sugar.  Lastly, I used whole wheat flour instead of the enriched white flour because it was what I had at home and it turned out well.  For the first batch, I made the cookies a little too big (about 2" or so in diameter), so I had to adjust the cooking time to 15 minutes and they turned out perfect.  I would make this again.

Beth, you are awesome!  My family and I love this recipe and we don't even like oatmeal raisin cookies, lol! I do soak my raisins in two eggs and a tsp. of vanilla for an hour.  I also add another egg to the mix.  I got this idea from another recipe from this site and its sooo good.

UPDATE: I never got around to mailing these to my friend (I was sick), so I brought them to work for our cookie exchange. Everyone liked them. I thought they lost a bit of their chewiness (but they were still good - and they smelled divine!). I didn't try warming them in the microwave... I'll have to do that next time! These are good cookies! Oatmeal raisin is not my "favorite" cookie (mine is chocolate chip), but these were yummy : ) Made half a batch to ship to a friend for Chirstmas. I used a 3 T Pampered Chef scoop for all of my cookies (and they were just the right size!). I think I made a little less than 1 1/2 dozen because of this.... I also had to bake my cookies for about 13 - 14 minutes because they were large. Note to all: these cookies smell WONDERFUL!!!  They are very spicy (in a "warm" sense, kinda like gingerbread). I followed the directions to a T, but next time I make a batch, I'll add 1 c. of raisins as a 1/2 c. just wasn't enough (I like raisins in every bite!). I think subbing chocolate covered raisins (i.e. Raisinettes) would be delicious and I might try that instead. I'll have to see how these are tomorrow. I am hoping for a soft, slightly crispy cookie to mail out this week. Thanks for sharing!

OMG....this cookie is exceptional!  It's exceptional bc it's so :

a) EASY
This is the first time I made it, and it only took 30 mins to make.  It was so effortless and yet, the cookies turned out like they came from a gourmet bakery.

b) VERSATILE
I added a various of spices that was not on the original recipe list.  I added more cloves, more cinnamon, some nutmeg, a bit of allspice and it really packed the flavour.  It was goooooddd.  I also added a bit of rum to the batter for a bit of a kick and moisture.

c) FLAVOURFUL
Such easy ingredients, but so much flavour.  It was also very moist and delicious.  It stored so well!

This recipe is pretty good.  A nice alternative to the ones my mom makes every year.  I totally forgot to add the shortening in my first batch.  They still came out yummy, though I thought the clove was a bit overpowering.

I never fail to get compliments on these cookies! They are great as is, or for the non-raisin lovers you can use chocolate chips instead of raisins and they are delicious that way too!
They make the perfect "spiced" soft cookie!
I do have to cook them for less time than specified in the recipe and at a lower temp but that because I have a very old oven that doesn't heat evenly

Excellent recipe as given. Would recommend to other cooks not to refrigerate the dough before baking (I did this) - cookies come out slightly crunchy instead of chewy, but it's still all good!

These were great cookies and I got a request for the recipe the first time I made them.  My picky husband who has to have soft and chewy yet a little crispy too loved them.  I don't like raisin oatmeal cookies and I made these so I wouldn't eat them, but it didn't work.  I loved them too!

These were great.  I was a little leery of using a full 1/2 tsp of cloves, but it was just right.  In later batches, I have added another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of ginger for a spicier cookie.  We tend to leave out the raisins, but we did add Craisins to the last half of a batch.  Very good!

WOW! Outstanding cookies! They were gone quick! The only change I made was I used all butter. Fantastic! Thanks!

I would like to give Beth credit for this "perfect" recipe, but I'm afraid the ribbon goes to Quaker Oatmeal!  With the exception of the extra lard and crushed cloves (ewe), this recipe is IDENTICAL to the recipe on the underside of the oatmeal lid.  Oh, a quick note...if you like your cookies chewy, try increasing the brown sugar and decreasing the flour and oats from 1/4 to 1/2 cup!  Then you have the "perfect" CHEWY oatmeal cookie!  =  )

Delicious.  I added a few shakes of ground ginger and another 1/4 c. oats.  I baked mine for 10 minutes instead of the reviewer recommended 9.  Wonderful cookies!  And I don't like raisins.

These were excellent! My dad bakes a whole lot and even he was like, you could sell these! I didnt have the butter flavored shortening so I just used the regular type. I also added 1/2 cup dried cherries and 1/2 cup walnuts. They were splendid!

Omg!  These are soooo delicious!  I made some healthy modifications as I always try to do when baking.  I reduced the butter to 5 Tbsp instead of 8 Tbsp.  I used Splenda sugar blend in place of the white sugar. I also substituted 1/2 cup of the flour with wheat bran.  The oats mask the taste of the bran, and you get the added fiber while using less white flour.  I also added butterscotch chips as an extra treat...these are really divine!

I have been looking for oatmeal cookies.  And I have found it.  All the others I have found, have been thin and not all that attractive.
 But these are thick and chewy and delish!

What a great cookie!! My mom and husband loved them! I used nuts (roasted them in the oven first for about 4 minutes) instead of raisins and didn't add the white sugar, sweet enough for me with one cup of brown sugar.

I hate to give a review on a recipe that I altered but these were so yummy. Not having raisins I used dried cranberries and not caring for cloves that much I substituted pumpkin pie spice...wow does it smell good in the kitchen. I think I could eat the whole batch......

Excellent.  I also put in a little bit of allspice (1/4 tsp) for a bit more zing.  Chocolate chips are also a wonderful substitute for raisins.

I absolutely loved these cookies and ate 4 of them before mailing them to my grandfather.  
I didn't have any butter flavored shortening, so I just used regular.  I used dark brown sugar instead of light.  I added a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice and also 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  Yummy!!!

These were the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever had!  I followed the recipe and cooked them for 10 minutes.  They came out perfect!  A little crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I liked this recipe, however was to sweet for my preference. If you don't prefer overly sweet things, I would recommend cutting the sugar a little bit and then adding up to the amount in the recipe to taste.

Very good, but be sure to use more cinnamon! Also, I tried replacing 1/3 of the white flour with whole wheat flour, worked out fine. I think next time I'll try using even more whole wheat flour.

Doubled the recipe and used splenda white and brown sugar for half of the total sugars and wheat flour for half of the flour.  Measured it out with a small scoop and got about 100 cookies.  Froze half in little balls on a cookie sheet to bake for next time.  YUM

With all the reviews and 5-star rating I expected the earth to move or something! While they are really good, I didn't think they were much different than any other oatmeal raisin cookie recipe. Probably won't make them again.

As others have said, this is the same as the recipe on the Quaker box except that part of the butter is switched to shortening (making them unhealthier) and except for the addition of cloves. Because of this, I was disappointed that this is in the top 20 recipes for this website.

Ok.. first, I didnt follow the recipe really.  I used Avocado instead of shortning.  I also used half raisins, and half craisins.  They turned out alright.  Not to sweet because I used half the sugar and added applesauce.  I am working on a "healthy cookie"  So we will see.  It was moist and chewy but didnt flatten.  So i had to smush them down before i baked them.

It really is a great recipe! I made this for my classmates and they simply loved it! One even ask if i could bake for her even if she had to pay me! WOW :) talk about great feedback :) Hmn I found out that younger people like chocolate chips with the cookie, I merely substituted chocolate chips for the raisins (although i still made some batches with raisins) and they loved it! my suggestion would be, that if you decide to add chocolate? add the ones that are not too sweet otherwise the cookie would be overly sweet :P

I love how they're not very sweet.  A healthy cookie!  My grocery only had extra thick whole rolled oats, so the second time I made these, I ground the oats quickly in my coffee bean grinder and the cookies came out perfect.

I have made a lot of Oatmeal raisin cookie recipes, the cloves made this the best one ever! I used all butter, that's all I had. Came out great, and the aroma was delicious!

It's five stars for a reason people. If you are not a huge fan of oatmeal raisin this recipe will change your tastebuds. 10 minute cooking time was right on ... just the right balance of chewy and crispy

I always use the recipe on Quaker Oats box and the only difference between the two is this one uses half shortening instead of all butter and it calls for cloves.  These will always be my favorite oatmeal raisin cookie.

Must try! These were absoulutely wonderful! I made a full batch but since my husband doesn't like sweets, I rolled up the remaining dough into balls and put them in a tupperware container to store in the freezer for later--this way I can bake a couple at a time and have them whenever:)

Wow!  I made these this afternoon and ended up blowing my diet and getting a belly-ache cause I ate too much!  One thing I did differently (and actually by accident) was to use french vanilla instead of plain vanilla.  Turned out wonderful with just a hint of the french.  Oh la la!

My son loves these cookies!   I used 1 tsp. of nutmeg.  I cooled cookies well before putting into tupperware, but they still didn't hold their shape.  It could be because I used all butter instead of half shortening.  The taste more than made up for the cookies that ended up in strange shapes after being in the tupperware.  I baked 9-10 minutes depending on which type of pan I used with each batch.  Great recipe!

DELISH!
I used Becel margarine instead of the butter/shortening combo, and added 1/3 chocolate chips along with the raisins.
Sooo good.
Thanks!!

Soooooooooo good! I didn't have shortening so I used all butter - also didn't have ground cloves. Doubled the recipe and the cookies came out great! Really chewy and moist. I'm sending them to my son in Iraq, so I hope they are still moist when they arrive. Thanks!

I loved these cookies. The smell alone is amazing. I did use less cloves than the recipe called for so they wouldn't be as spicy. This is the best oatmeal raisin cookies recipe I've used.

I just finished making these cookies, and they are wonderful. The recipe was really easy to follow, too. I'm a terrible cook, and difficult recipes are usually too much for me! I've tried several different recipes for oatmeal raisin cookies, and some of them have been bland, or okay at best. The spices in these make them so much better. The consistency is really nice too- kind of in between cookies and cake!

This is definately the best oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever made or had. I didn't have any clove so I just left it out. These cookies stay really soft even after sitting until the next day, although there wasn't many left the next day. Excellent recipe. Definately being made alot in this house.

Delicious Cookies. I've made Oatmeal cookies in the past but NEVER have they been this good! They only thing I left out was the cloves as I had none and made half with raisins half without for my husband although the ones with raisins are vastly superior, I think he's missing out but he loved them anyway.

These were the most delicious cookies I've made in a long time!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening, so I just used regular shortening and they turned out awesome!  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  I added a few extra raisins because I love it that way. I also didn't have any cloves, so I substituted pumpkin pie spice. My whole family loved these cookies.

The BEST... PERIOD. And to those critics who MUST always criticize a recipe regardless... get a life. Cooking is for the enjoyment and the experience and I really don't care WHO comes up with the recipe. When it's good, it's good. Please don't rate a recipe one star when you've changed it so drastically that it's nowhere near the original, just post your own!

These cookies came out really well.  They are light and chewy.  I added nutmeg for a little more flavor, used margarine instead of butter (dairy allergy) , and used a mix of brown sugar and Splenda brown sugar (all I had).  Yum!

My dad absolutely loves these cookies!! I substitute 1/2 cup margarine instead of the shortening because I never have shortening in the house and I don't have cloves either but I used pumpkin pie spice, 1 teaspoon in place of the cloves and they are really tasty. Thanks so much for this recipe, I keep them made all the time for my dad, he puts them in an airtight plastic container and stashes them in his closet. He eats a few everyday....he's crazy about them.

Perfect! Smells so good while baking, wanted to taste them right away! I used just magarine, no butter, but it was still yum! I do  think though, it could use a little bit more spice, and maybe some more fruit, like more raisins and perhaps some almonds. Still, thanks for a great recipe!!

This is the first time I have ever made oatmeal raisin cookies. They were pretty good; they would have been spectacular if I had copied the recipe down correctly. I don't know how I did it, but I wrote down 1 cup of butter instead of half butter, half shortening. As a result, they turned out a bit dry. I also didn't have any cloves so I left them out. I didn't think I would miss it but I really did! I will definitely make this one again after I get some cloves. Without them, I was thinking that some flaked coconut might have been good in these. Don't know how it would work with the cloves, though. Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've had by far. I've made changes every time and found the best variation is the one written. I make them extra special with the addition of brown butter icing. Thank you Beth!

These are absolutely the best cookies ever. I have even made changes to suit my families taste and they are still superb. I've added pecans or walnuts, chocolate chips, m & m's, whatever my kids want at the time. They are pure heaven. I too use real butter but I use the butter flavored crisco packs. Twelve minutes are perfect cooking time in my oven and they stay chewy for days, I spoon them out in a tablespoon and they plump up to be perfect size and shape. Awesome recipe Beth. And VERY easy to make.

I have been looking for a good oatmeal cookie recipe and this one is it! These are yummy and chewy. I ran out of cinnamon so I used pumkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and cloves and I will keep that substitution. I thought the spice was perfect.

Very tasty!  I've been making my mom's oatmeal raisin cookies for 30 years and decided to try something new.  Loved them, the only changes I made were to use dried cherries (we live in Northern Michigan - cherry country) and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans - they didn't last long!  Will definitely make them again!

Good but not great. Needs something more. Not spicy at all really but a decent cookie to start. Will definately add nutmeg and more cinnamon to give it more of a kick which sadly it lacked.

These are almost identical to the recipe on the quaker oat lid.  Very good cookie.  Sealed in an airtight container they stay fresh for a few days.  Also, I would definitely soak the raisins first ( I prefer golden).

This was such a simple and wonderful recipe. I took the advice of others and baked it for only 8 minutes. This prevented it from being hard and it turned out nice and soft.

Really yummy!  The cloves make for the unique flavor.  Soaked the raisins in warm water while mixing the other ingredients.  Drained and added to batter for a plumper raisin.  Gave to Dad for Father's Day!

These were really, really good cookies.  They reminded me of the oatmeal raisin cookies you get at Subway.  I used all butter, added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, soaked the raisins in hot water as sugguested in other reviews, and baked on a silicone baking mat for 15 minutes.  They came out perfectly!!  I would definitely make these again.

This recipe is very good.  The only thing I would change is add almond extract to it instead of the vanilla.  I love almond extract because it gives a great flavor.  Good job on your recipe!  You go girl!

Made exactly as recipe reads.  I thought they were good, but not great. They were better when still warm and also better right out of the freezer.  Probably won't make again since family prefers my other cookie recipes.

amazing cookies! If even someone as challenged as me in the kitchen can make these and have them taste amazing, anyone can! I upped the cinnamon too, and added in some chocolate chips. I also used margarine only b/c thats all i had at home. I made a recipe for 24 cookies, and ended up using only a little more than 1/3c of margarine. These cookies really tasted like the ones you buy from a bakery! They were so good, and the family loved them!

I didn't have cloves, so I couldn't use them, but I added nutmeg. I also used the 1 cup butter, as others suggested. I don't know if I mixed the batter wrong or maybe mismeasured - though I always double check - but these came out less than stellar. It took 15+ minutes for my first batch to cook, the dough was very mushy. I also don't think the flavor is as good as described. But like I said, perhaps I mixed something incorrectly. I would try this again.

The cloves are a little overpowering for my tastes.  I'll be adjusting the amount next time I make these.  Overall, very yummy.

I had a whim for oatmeal raisin cookies, and this was so easy... and I actually had all the ingredients (other then the shortening, used the regular kind). Very tasty and the kids loved helping me make them and EAT them!!

Beautiful and delicious!  These are the perfect oatmeal cookie.  I substituted margarine for the butter and regular shortening for the butter flavored shortening, but other than that left the recipe as is.  These are great with chocolate chips, craisins, raisins and walnuts, or any other mixins you like!  If you don't like the clove flavor, you can leave it out and up the cinnamon a little.

I didn't have shortening, so I used 1 cup butter. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and these turned out delicious!

I made this recipe with regular instead of butter flavored shortening and substituted dried cranberries for raisins. HUGE HIT!
They were incredibly tasty, and lived up to their promise to make your kitchen smell lovely!

I just used butter in place of the shortening (so 1c. butter total), baked them for about 11 minutes and they were still nice and soft when they cooled off.  I love the cloves in this cookie, but may increase the amount used next time as you can not taste it as distinctly once the cookie is baked. If you think this implies that I tried it in dough form as well....then you'd be correct :)  You just can't resist!  Will definitely make these again.

The perfect oatmeal cookies.  I made these with the 'rounded teaspoonful' size. and got about 60 little cookies out of it.  For chewy cookies this small I had to reduce the baking time to 8 minutes.  I will try to incorporate mini-chocolate chips next time, to make these even more decadent.  GREAT recipe.

I've made these several times and everybody raves over them. I frosted them with cream cheese frosting (of course, you could make your own, but I just bought some in a tub from the grocery store)and they taste incredible...just like carrot cake. Even people who aren't big oatmeal raisin cookie fans LOVE them.

This recipe is wonderful.  I will probably work on trying to make it a little more healthy and if the results are just as spectacular as the original recipe, I will report back with revisions.  

A side note - these are not spicy at all.      Perhaps the word "spicy" is a bit misleading.

Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!! The only thing I changed was that I used regular shortening instead of butter flavored. They were delicious!! And don't be scared about the "spicy" part, it's just the yummy spices, they weren't spicy like I first pictured (thankfully!)l!!

Great cookies. I changed a bit but used this as a base. I doubled the recipe and used Kamut and Prairie Gold wheat combo freshly ground in my mill (yum). I also used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of applesauce instead of the shortning. Used all the brown sugar and used half raw organic sugar for the white. I also added about 3/4 of a cup of pecans for an extra crunch. I baked them about 15 minutes since the applesauce makes the batter wet. The are a huge hit. Thanks for the recipe.

These Oatmeal Raisin cookies have made a unit of soldiers in Iraq very happy with a taste of home.  They are by far the best cookies Ive ever made.  Sometimes I will substitute nutmeg for cloves. Thankyou Beth for helping me keep my loved ones happy!!!

this recipe was fabulous. I've been making oatmeal cookies all my life (fam recipe), and to bring out the taste even more and to give the cookies an even fluffier consistency I use soy butter instead of the butter and replacement butter. Plus adding a bit of coconut makes the oatmeal taste really pop! Thanks for the recipe!

I was really against making these, because my go-to oatmeal raisin cookie recipe is Betty Crocker and it's awesome. But, I thought I would give this one a try for something different. It turned out great! Just out of curiousity, I looked at the recipe next to the Betty Crocker, the only difference was BC doesn't have cloves! Ha ha, go figure, right? Anyway, still a great cookie!

We really enjoyed these cookies. I used a medium sized ice cream scoop and still ended up with 54 cookies instead of 36. I used Airbake cookie sheets and they took about 14 minutes to bake. Even then they did not get too crispy, but that's the way we like them anyway.

These are very soft and chewy. I think the trick is to not over-bake them. I didn't let mine get brown on the top at all. I also added 1/2 teaspoon ginger and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg for some extra spice and they are delicious!

I added the nutmeg as recommended and they were excellent!  I baked for 12 min. as directed and they were still chewy.  Ovens vary so check your first batch early and then go from there...

DELICIOUS!  The perfect amount of spice and sweet.  Even the diehard anti-oatmeal raisin people at my work ate these.  I never use shortening in my cookies, though, so I just substituted that portion with butter.

Delicious! I will defiently make these again. I made a few small changes like other reviewers suggested. I used 
1 1/2 teaspoons of Cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon Ginger, instead of cloves. I also added in 1/2 cup chocolate chips along with the 1 cup of raisins. Next time I might add a small box of instant vanilla pudding so they'll stay softer longer, plan to send these overseas.

The delightful fragrance of these cookies lingered in the house for hours, and even drew my neighbor over for a gander! Delicious and complex flavor- the spices really kick it up! My only concern was the texture... when they first came out of the oven, they were soft and chewy. But after being stored in tubberware for a few days, they became harder. Perhaps lid wasn't on tight enough- Who knows! (My parents are older and can't eat anything too crunchy!) Thanks for the help and wonderful treat! (which I love in mid-afternoon with an apple and a cup of tea!)

mine where not flat at all, or like the picture either...

I added 3 shakes of nutmeg
No cloves
1 tablespoon unsulphured molasses
no white sugar
whole wheat flour instead of white

On 1/4 of the batch I blended up a banana and added it!  Yum!

NOTHING should taste this good!!  This is by far the best oatmeal cookie I have ever eaten.  It was so chewy and delicious.  I didn't add the cloves as I find the flavor really overwhelming, but instead I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  This was the perfect ingredient to add just a little more texture to the cookie.  This definitely lives up to all the hype and is a keeper for sure.

Positively fabulous!!! I used Smart Balance instead of the butter/shortening combo (dairy allergies) and they were outstanding! I took them to my son's baseball game and the boys in the dugout were clamoring for cookies. Of course, they couldn't have them at the time, and by the time the game was over, so were the cookies!   Update: Are these not the same as the recipe in the Quaker Oats box, with the addition of cloves?

Being not such a fan of oatmeal cookies, I thought that these were delicious! Very easy to make.  I got rave reviews! I used 3/4 cups of raisin just because I not a huge raisin person either.

You have just found THE BEST Oatmeal Raisin Cookie recipe...don't look any further! Whenever I make these cookies I divide the dough in half and make half with raisins and the other half without. My husband and oldest son like raisins and myself and two youngest sons  do not.  And yes, even without the raisins this recipe still rocks!!

This is by far the best Oatmeal Raisin cookie I have ever had!  Perfect proportion of crunch to chewy!  I followed the recipe to the "T" with the exception of adding approximately 1/2 more raisins. I will be making these again and again.  Thanks for sharing such an amazing recipe!!

Doubled the cinnamon and cloves and used Smart Balance spread instead of butter, otherwise followed recipe exactly. These were very easy to make cookies. Baked for exactly ten minutes and this was enough and perhaps a minute or two more than necessary. Mixture was runny and I was worried about that but it made decent if thin, light cookies that are relatively low in fat and not too sweet.  They were just a bit dry, but that may be because I did overbake them by a minute or two. Gave them a 4 because I've had better cookies but these were okay and really quick and easy to make.

Holey nummers!  And I'm not an oatmeal cookie fan.  I added raisons, craisons and walnuts and a bit of butter extract.  This recipe is amazzzing.  I also used my ice cream scoop to make the cookies a bit bigger than I would usually.  You could easily make friends with THIS cookie...

Just had my dh make these for me as I had a major craving for some chewy OR cookies and couldn't find any premade at the store that weren't crisp. They are delicious and I've already had 5. We omitted the clove alltogether and used regular shortening as that's what we had and they were/are fantastic. Saved this one to My Recipe Box so that we can/will use this one in the future!!! Thanks, Beth. Outstanding!!!

I used all butter, 1-min quick oats, substituted nutmeg for cloves, added more than 1.5 c of raisins, and added chocolate chips to my last dozen.  The cookie is good with or without the chocolate chips.  I baked each batch within 8-11 min.  All of my cookies are soft (bordering on soggy), but all my friends really like them that way.

These were great. I also used all butter (no shortening) and increased the cinnamon slightly. I used all white whole wheat flour (from King Arthur), and they were great. They took 10 minutes on the convection setting in my oven.

It was pretty good, but it wasn't as chewy as I expected.  Maybe I baked too long.  I added chocolate-covered cranberry, chocolate chip, and walnuts.  It tasted good, though.

I kept the butter and shortening the same. I only added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and ginger, I took the cloves down to 1/4 tsp as well, simply to suit my own personal taste. This is a great recipe just like her snickerdoodles. Thank you Beth, I'm trying your recipe for the peanut butter cookies next!

These came out great! I did use all butter as I have no Shortening but had to cook them for 11 minutes to get them to cook all the way. Might be my electric over and elevation though. i would probably add a little more spice next time - but just because I like things kicked up! All in all. everyone is eating them up as I type. Thanks for the recipe!

Used honey instead of brown sugar and nutmeg instead of cloves and all butter instead of half shortening.  The taste was great, but they did not come out as chewy as I would like.  Still testing the bake time, but will make again.

BEST OATMEAL COOKIES I'VE EVER MADE! this recipe is definately going into my favorites! the only thing I did different (followed the advice from several others) was replace the cloves with allspice. you will have a hard time not eating them all by yourself!

omg amazing.

seriously.

i've tried a lot of oatmeal cookie recipes and this is the best i've ever tasted. i used nutmeg and cinnamon in this, and added a mix of craisins, raisins, and golden raisins (you can buy a mix in a bag at the grocery store), which really made these a treat!

My 14 year old daughter decided to make these and they turned out wonderful! She did use 1 cup of butter instead of the shortening and took the idea from another reviewer who said to add one box of instant vanilla pudding. Best cookie I have ever had.

I was wanting to try this recipe for so long due to the fantastic reviews and i finally went for it. I don't usually like oatmeal raisin cookies but these were excellent. I liked the added spice that regular oatmeal raisin cookie don't have. I love how they stay chewy after they cool ( i hate crispy cookies). I made my cookies slightly bigger than the recipe called for and they took 14 minutes to bake. I will be making these again but next time i try to add some chocolate chips too. YUM! Thanks for the recipe :)

I had never made oatmeal cookies before but will be making these again soon. My family was in town visiting... my mom is hard to please and said these tasted "okay". Later, I found her going for seconds, thirds, fourths and then lost count. Soon the cookies were gone and she was begging me for the recipe. Keep them in an airtight container to keep them soft and chewy.

This is the only oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever made but they are very, very good.  Chewy and very tasty.  My boyfriend says they get even better after a couple days but I can't taste a difference, but they do stay soft when tightly kept.  I haven't made them with rolled oats, none on hand, will buy rolled oats soon.  I also add a 1/2 teaspoon of ground dry ginger but haven't tried the recipe without this addition to comment but tastes great with and doesn't taste like ginger cookies to me.

I made these cookies per the recipe and they were great. I baked them 10 mins and that was perfect for the size, I used a small ice cream scoop. I will continue to use this recipe. You will not go wrong using the orginal recipe.

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have found in a long time.  I made a batch with raisins and one without and they both were excellent.  Good job Beth!!

These were good.  The cloves added something new and different - but I won't make them like that every time.  Definitely a nice change up though!

This recipe yielded a delicious oatmeal raisin cookie, however I was quite disappointed with the outcome. I expected the spices of the cookie to have a significant kick - I found otherwise. I continuously sampled the dough and found that it wasn't remotely spicy - so I more than doubled the spices, added ginger, and even pepper. (Also, to get plump raisins, I soaked them in hot water for about 10 minutes) The end result was a delicious oatmeal raisin cookie - but it wasn't spicy as I expected. Having noted my personal disappointment, my family and friends did fawn over the cookie.

I decided to make these for my kids, however they did not like them as well as I hoped. (picky eaters) I added vanilla yogart covered raisins and chocolate chips also. I thought they were very good. My husband who doesnt seem to be a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies thought these were tasty. I will definitly make these again!

Very good cookies! I used all butter and decreased the amount by 1/4 cup and increased the oats by 1/2 cup. They are a little tricky to transfer to a cooling rack without falling apart, but it can be done with a little practice. Very good tasting cookie though!

These cookies are really easy to make...I knew it seemed a little odd for 1 1/2 cup of sugar! they came out way to sweet for my adult taste buds. Other than that, it's definitely a keeper.

This cookie is great but, I did  take some of the suggestions in the reviews:  limit cooking time to 8 or 9 minutes, add more of the spices, and use all butter you don't need the shortenning.  The cookies did not last 48 hours in my house.

These are sooo yummy! I didn't have cloves so I used all spice, and nutmeg. I also made them one time with blueberries instead of raisins, they were sooo good.

Very tasty.  Added an extra 1/4 cup of flour to make sure I didn't have a problem with spreading (used all butter, no shortening) and had no issues.  Also added walnuts for some crunch.  Yum!

Very moist cookies and the dough is amazing.  Followed recipe except I did not have raisins so substituted milk chocolate chips which my fiance loved.  I made some plain also and they were great.  I also increased the cinnamon to 1.5 teaspoons. Will make again.

I substituted the shortening for applesauce.  After I mixed all the ingredients except for the raisins.  I divided the dough into 3.  In one batch I put raisins, in the second batch I put craisins, and in the third batch I put chocolate chips.  It was yummy, and chewy, and the chocolate chip batch was by far the most well received.  But having the variety was good for different preferences.

Love these cookies!  I'm a huge spice fan and usually add more spices than called for, and this recipe certainly feeds that.  I usually add nutmeg and allspice to this recipe, but it's great without it too.  I make them often.

These were great! They were incredibly easy to make (perfect for me) and came out a little crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside shortly after cooling.  After keeping overnight in an airtight container, they are nice and chewy today (but lost the exterior crisp).  I didn't think they were necessarily spicy, next time I might add some more spices to get that effect. But they are yummy, easy and I will make again! I used all butter instead of shortening, baked about 11 minutes and they came out perfect.  This is basically the same recipe on the box of Quaker Oats though, which also calls for all butter (no shortening) and omits the cloves (but I am glad I included the cloves).
Also I only had light brown sugar on hand to use, but I think that worked just fine.

This was my first attempt at raisin oatmeal cookies and they are wonderful!  I don't plan to search for any other recipe.  I used regular shortening.  I didn't have ground clove so I just ground some tops of whole cloves.  I used egg replacer due to egg allergies and they were fantastic.  Thanks

This recipie is awesome.  The cookies turned out perfect.  Even my pickie boyfriend gobbled them down.  I followed the recipie to exactly except I used all butter because I had to no shortening and the cookies were great.  I had no problem with the consitency with the cookies crumbling that some of the other people wrote about.  I was worried but all went well.  I flattened my cookies slightly and baked for 12 minutes.  Thanks for the recipies.  This one's a keeper!!!!!!

If you like oatmeal cookies, this is THE recipe!  I experimented with different times, and every batch came out a little bit different. 8 minutes was the minimum and 10 minutes was the maximum.  Any less or more and they either came out under-cooked (fell apart) or burned on the bottom.  Took one reviewer's advice and put dough in refrigerator for 30 minutes before oven.  The first batch (cold from fridge) definitely came out the best. Made my home smell great!

I am so disappointed, not sure what went wrong but I followed the recipe exactly. They taste good but completely fell apart. I even waited 2-4 min. before removing them from the cookie sheet. I only made 2 batches & threw away the rest of the dough which felt like a complete waste.

I make oatmeal cookies all the time, and these are one of my favorites.  I can easily make them chewy or crunchy; whichever I feel like.  I always cut either the butter or shortening in half, cut either the brown or white sugar in half, and double the spices!  I also soak my raisins in some warm water for a few minutes before mixing it in.  From my experience with this recipe, the dough balls don't flatten out much when you bake them, so I flatten out my teaspoonful balls of dough before baking to get the round, flat chewy cookies.  Otherwise they come out as chewy mounds of cookies (not bad either, just not as pretty).

I am 9 months pregnant & had a huge craving for oatmeal/raisin cookies. I just made a batch of these & I am scared that I will eat them all! They are amazing!!  I subsituted nutmeg for ground cloves because I was too lazy to grind up the whole cloves I had on hand. I also used vegetable shortening because I didn't have any butter flavored shortening.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've never made oatmeal raisin cookies before, but they have always been a favorite.  I included this recipe in my Christmas 2007 baking.  It will be a regular with my holiday baking, as well as any other time I need something sweet.  Thanks, Beth!

I thought that this recipe was good but not AMAZING.  I had such high hopes based on the ratings but I didn't think they were as sweet as they should have been.  To be honest though, I doubled the recipe and I didn't have quite enough brown sugar so the error was most definately my fault.  I will try the recipe again and see how it turns out.  Also I used Tablespoon to drop the cookies vs. a teaspoon.  I thought using a teaspoon made them too small and hard when finished.  Update... I tried again w/ the right amount of everything and they turned out great!  The only thing I did do different is I used rounded Tablespoons vs. teaspoons and I flattened them out just a tad w/ a fork prior to baking.  They are great!!  Just what I expected.  Plus I still got 36 cookies out of the recipe using Tbl drops vs. tsp drops

The only changes I made were halving the recipe and I used all butter instead of half shortening...  Due to the rating I thought these would be better.  I was disappointed, turned out to be just like any other oatmeal cookie.

okay these are hands down aaamazing, my brother practically ate them all in one sitting...the trick to get them to stay soft and chewey is to flatten them out on the pan...they don't spread, so flatten them out as much as you can, and bake up for 6 minutes...ive also made them by dropping them into rounded balls on the pan, but they down stay as soft, so flatten them...and enjoy...

This is one of the all-time best cookies. After reading the other reviewers, I lowered cooking time to 9 minutes, left out cloves, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp ginger, dried cranberries and chopped walnuts. Every one of my testers loved it!

VERY good recipe!  My first attempt at making a different oatmeal raisin cookie was a failure, but these were very good.  They came out nice and chewy and had the perfect amount of raisins in them.  I might add just a bit less clove next time but I really did like the spiciness that it gives the cookie along with the cinnamon.  I made these as a part of my holiday baking line-up and I made things even easier by mixing all of the dry ingredients (besides the sugars) together in a large zip top bag a couple days in advance.  When I went to make the cookies all I had to do was cream the butter, sugars, eggs and vanilla then stir in the dry mix and bake.  Thank's for the recipe!

These were great!  To make them a little healthier, I used all brown sugar and all whole wheat flour.  I also added chocolate-peanut butter chips.  They still had a crispy outside and soft inside.  The cookies were also great a week later.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were so wonderful. The clove gives these cookies the perfect flavor. Everyone loved them in my house. I stuck with the recipe and can't think of a single thing I would change about it. I think one thing I may try next time is using dried cranberries rather than raisens.

I'm a huge fan of oatmeal cookies and these are the best.  I advise you not to change a thing because they're perfect the way they are.  Having said that, I did change a couple of things.  My personal preference is more cinnamon so I added just a little more.  I soaked the raisins in hot water for ten minutes and then drained and dried them before adding them to the batter.  The last thing I changed was I baked them for 10 minutes because I have an old cranky oven.  This is my favorite recipe for oatmeal cookies.

Wow! These are so delicious! I used all butter and mini choc chips instead of raisins as my son doesn't like raisins. Twelve minutes is a little too long. My first two trays came out too crunchy. The other 2 trays I only left in for 9 minutes, and pefect! It drives me nuts when people totally change the recipe around and then give it a rating on their finished product. Being that I changed the recipe a little is why I gave it 4 stars. Next time I will make some with raisins and others with choc chips! Thanks!

These are the best oatmeal cookies...just be sure to plump your rasins in tea to intensify the taste.

I am not a big fan of oatmeal cookies, but I made them for my dad since they are his favorite. I actually liked them pretty well, especially the spices in there. They also looked really nice.

GREAT RECIPE!!  Changed just a couple things...didn't add quite as much oats(2 1/2 cups) and added a bit of coconut.  Also did another batch and substituted chocolate chips for the raisins!!!

The cloves makes this an especially delicious  cookie.  I used apple pie spice and cloves.  Also I used a combination of raisins cranberries and cut up dried apricots.  They were delish.

Everywhere I go now, everyone asks If I brought these cookies.  They are chewy, hearty, healthy (if a cookie could be healthy) and the perfect blend of flavors.  They make you homesick for Christmas when you smell them baking.  An all-time favorite!!!! Thanks.

I had no trouble with these cookies.  Used the 36ct recipe, a 2 ounce ice cream scoop, which yielded 22 cookies.  I mixed by hand with a wooden spoon, until just incorporated.  My only modification was to take them out sooner...I have dark cookie sheets which burn things more quickly, and I kind of like my cookies just barely cooked anyways.  THESE ARE DELICIOUS!!!!!  Look just like the photo.  Yum.  Awesome taste and very photogenic cookies!

Wonderful! I've made the recipe on the box of oats and from the shortening. These are by far the best!
I didn't have the cloves, but I used a tiny bit of nutmeg and a bit more cinnamon. I rolled the dough in a ball and flattened them a bit, they looked store bought when they cooked! I iced with canned frosting, just a thin piping swirl. To die for!!! A++++++++++++++

These cookies are fabulous.  I made a few changes, I used all butter, exchanged 1/2 cup of flour for 1/2 cup of steel cut oats, added 1 tsp cardamom and I used dried cherries instead of raisins.  I will definitely make these again :)

These cookies are amazing, I can't stop eating them!  I don't like using Crisco, so I used 1/4 cup baking margarine, and 1/4 cup pumpkin to replace it...turned out great.  Definetely don't overbake, I did mine for 12 min's, let them sit on baking stone for a few minutes and then onto cooling rack...my husband likes them soft and chewy, he says they are perfect.

These disappeared and everybody loved them.  I added 1/4-1/2 cup flour (depending on how cake like you want them)as suggested.  I used all butter instead of shortening.  I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  Excellent.

I've made these twice now and boy are they yummy.  I made it just as written but do agree with some previous posters that if you prefer thicker cookies (like they are pictured), add a bit more flour.  I will add the extra flour in the future (forgot to do it this time) but even flat, they will still be gone within a couple of days.

begging me to make Oatmeal raisin cookies & thought I'd try this.  Just didn't have the Crisco, so I used all butter.  Great tasting cookie! (I ate wayyy too many!) :D

These are even better the second day. I used all butter since that's what I had, and I added a teaspoon of nutmeg and a teaspoon of ginger extract, and used dark brown sugar - really, really good!

Very yummy!! I did not have butter shortening, used regular shortening and added a bit more spice to them.  It's the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've made.

Sometimes when I make these the cookie dough seems really "liquidy" but they turn out perfectly fine (and chewy) when they're done. Very good cookies.

These were hands down the best tasting oatmeal cookie I've had - BUT - they all stuck to the cookie pan.  Did I do something wrong or do you positively need to use non-stick?

No doubt about it. This is THE oatmeal cookie recipe. What I did: of all the spices I added 1 tsp of each instead of the called for amount. Plus about 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice. I also used all butter. My husband unfortunately, hates raisins but even he ate some. LOVE these! Great job!

I just finished making a batch of these cookies and they are very tasty!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening, so I used regular and then added 1/2 tsp. Wilton's butter flavoring.  I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour in place of 1/2 cup of the regular flour, and golden raisins instead of regular, since that's what I had on hand.  They turned out great, with a subtle spiciness that makes me keep eating them  :-)  Great recipe, Beth!

These got rave reviews from the people at a party I brought them to. A couple of partygoers even said they were the "best oatmeal raisin cookies they had ever tasted". The cloves really make a huge difference!

These cookies were devoured!  I didn't put raisins in.  I used chocolate chips and peanut butter chips instead. I took a couple dozen into work and they were GONE before some teachers even got to try one!  Will definitely make again!

T-H-E best Oatmeal Raising Cookie Recipe EVER! Thick, moist, chewy, flavorful - it has it all. I added a pinch of ginger and nutmeg too for another twist. AMAZING with jumbo flame raisins soaked in hot, sugared water! I have used the base with chocolate chip & cranberry substituted for the raisins as well. BE FOREWARNED: husbands and workplaces will not mearly ask for the recipe but will insist that you bake and bring cookies in on a regular basis.

These did not turn out so well.  Don't get me wrong-they were good, just not great. They didn't flatten out during baking, so I ended up with thick cookies that were done on the outside, but gooey on the inside. Probably will not make these again.

These came out perfectly. just the right portions of spices, raisins & oats. Nice Job! The only variance that i applied was to cut the recipe in half and use unsalted butter, no shortening. It didn't seem to affect the outcome. My husband & I really enjoyed them.

I did not use the butter shortening - instead I subbed 1/4 cup butter + 1/4 cup oil.  I also added more spices - extra cinnamon and cloves, plus some nutmeg. I already add allspice to most of my cookies, might as well complete the trio.

I followed the recipe as directed except iI doubled the vanilla (as I do in all cookie recipes) and added more cinnamon. I thought the ratio of oats to flour was dispoportionate. The cookies stuck to the pan. My 9 year old son loved the version where I substitued chocolate chips for raisins. My husband who is not at all picky called them "interesting". While the flavor was okay, it was not the type of cookie I was looking for. I most likely would not make these again. And my search for the perfect hybrid oatmeal raisin/chocolate chip cookie recipe continues....

I really love these cookies!  They're so easy to make.  I use 3/4 c. of oil instead of butter and shortning, then I add 1/2 t. nutmeg because I love the flavor.  They turn out delicious and my only complaint is I can't stop eating them!  Try using two of the flattest cookies in the batch and making ice cream sandwiches with vanilla ice cream or frozen vanilla yogurt... YUM!  Thanks, Beth, for a yummy cookie recipe.

First of all, I read most of the reviews, the good and bad.
I read how people said it was basically the same recipe off the Quaker box, so I figured it would be fool proof. To me, the success of a recipe depends on how fool proof it is.

This was my first time making oatmeal cookies, but I was short a few ingredients and had to do a couple of substitutions.

I felt there wasn't a lot of spice or even sweetness. It was a little bit bland for me.

I'm not ready to give up on this yet! I am definitely going to try this again and make sure I have all the right ingredients and no substitutions. I believe it was my own fault for this recipe not fulfilling it's full potential.

I think if you make this one time and don't like it, it's definitely worth another try.

This recipe is fantastic!  The cloves make the recipe!  The only change I made was using butter instead of shortening.  I also made sure to use baking raisins which are moister.

cloves were difficult to find, but they made all the difference in this recipe.  I also replaced the "shortening" with 1/4 stick of butter + 1/4 cup of veg. oil.  I don't like the shortening after taste.

Very good.  I did alter the recipe slightly.  I used all butter flavored shortening rather than butter and shortening.  Additionally I realized I was out of vanilla, and used 1/2 tsp. of almond extract instead.  When baking, I lowered the temperature to 325 and baked them for 14 minutes.

These were good cookies; reviews helped alot!
I live in Va so we have a flour in the south called White Lily. Its a self rising soft wheat(cake flour). No messing with soda, salt etc It makes these cookies easy and tasty! I used 3/4 cup butter, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and cooked on convection for 10min. Next time I'll try chocolate chips.
Not the Ultimate but close.

So good!  I didn't have ground cloves, so I did what another user did and substituted pumpkin pie spice for that and the cinnamon (1.5 Tbs).  I then added a little more cinnamon after I tasted the batter.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious cookies!  They go so fast I have to double the recipe or I just might not get any.  I substitute Craisins for half the raisins for a tangy twist.  I've taken these on hunting trips for a sweet treat through the day.  It's a keeper!

This recipe is great! I substituted in Craisins for raisins and chilled the dough for 15-20 minutes to make scooping easier. Wonderful chewy, moist cookie that isn't overly sweet!

I thought this recipe was ok. I adjusted the sevings to 20 cookies and left out 1/8 of egg. It wasn't too sweet. I had to cook it a little longer than 10-12 min because I made them a little thicker. After reading some reviews, I think I'd add some chocolate chips for extra sweetness.

These were good. Nothing special though. I didnt taste the "Spice"in these cookies. I followed the recipe to a T. If i decide to make these again, i will try adding chocolate chips.

Excellent.  Here's a couple changes I made to make them even better:  Replace oatmeal with homemade granola, replace raisins with chopped gourmet chocolate (Such as Girradelli).   They are a real treat!!

This is a great recipe. Instead of the cinnamon and cloves I used "speculaaskruiden". I don't know what to call it in english! I like to use slightly more raisins, 50 percent or so, or chocolate chips instead. Thanks for this recipe!

Easy and turned out great! I used 1 cup of butter (instead of half butter, half shortening). I had to cook them a little longer, but that's just my oven. Really great, classic taste. Thanks!

Wonderful flavor and good texture.  Wonderful warm with a cold glass of milk, of course.  My boyfriend requested I make these again!  I didn't have ground cloves on hand, so I substituted allspice.

Mmmmm. I skipped the cloves, was 3 tablespoons short on shortening (added 3 T. butter) and it still turned out yummy. I'm not sure why so many people had problems, but I'm glad they turned out for me. They've got a good taste and a great texture. The only problem I had was that a few of them are not staying together but most of them are.

Definitely the best oatmeal raisin cookies, even if you're not a fan of one! Tastes best right out of the oven after cooling a few minutes. Mine turned out rather chewy than crispy after a few days, but definitely a keeper, no doubt! It will convert all those who never liked these cookies before!

These tasted really good, but mine spread out in the oven and ended up pancakes. I think it may have been because there was some moisture that I added with the raisins that I boiled in a 1/2 c of water and 1/4 c of Brugal dark rum, so that would have been my own fault.

Yummy, I loved these cookies.  I had to fight my son for them.  Only change I made was to add a little more cinnamon.  Next time I will try soaking the raisins before adding to cookies.  This will be my Oatmeal cookie recipe from now on.

Another great cookie. Soaking the raisins was a great suggestion. Adding a couple dashes of nutmeg and another tsp of cinnamon worked out really well. Nine minuetes was the perfect time on these. The end result, a moist and chewy cookie.

Pretty good, but next time I'll add more baking soda, flour, and spice.  The cookies turned out extremely flat and ran all over the place using the original recipe.  I'm guessing they'll be 5-stars + with some adjustments.

Good cookie, not very difficult to make.  I added chopped walnuts, and next time I would add more cloves and cinnamon, as well as include ginger and nutmeg for a truly spicy cookie.

Great cookies! I'm not a big fan of cloves so I substituted nutmeg and yummmmm. I used an extra half tsp of baking soda and soaked the raisins as some of the reviews recommended. Thanks to everyone for the great baking tips.

I used margarine in place of shortening and whole wheat flour in place of the all-purpose and instead of getting 36 cookies, I managed to 52 good sized cookies.  I like the taste and the consistency, however even though I used fresh spices, I did not find these cookies to be spicy at all.  I would recommend using twice the amount of spices called for.  Otherwise, this is a great cookie.  We will definitely make these again!

I sent these to work with my boyfriend. Many of them said they were the best oatmeal raisin cookie they have ever had. I loved the chewiness of these. I did not change a thing and will make them again and again!!!

YUM!! This is the BEST Oatmeal Raisin Cookie recipe I have ever made!! Followed recipe to a "T" with the exception of decreasing salt to 1/4 tsp. As I write the review, I am eating a still warm cookie, 4 minutes out of the oven, accompanied by a cup of hot tea!!!! Thank you for the recipe, Beth! SUPERB!!

I just had to write a review, because this got such raves.  I shared with my teenager who shared with her friends and they came back to tell me that they were the very best cookies they had ever had and could I make some for their bake sale!

Since discovering this recipe on here a few months ago, I have made these cookies many times.  My 4 year old LOVES them and asks me to make them all the time.  I have used butter or margarine depending on what I have and the margarine ones always turn out better (more chewy and moist).  Also I add the oats 1 cup at a time until the dough seems just right.  Sometimes it's 3 cups, sometimes less.  These are a family favourite her, Thanks Beth :)

These are really yummy.  I've made these a few times and people love them.  I soak the raisins in hot water for about a half hour before adding them to the dough - makes them plump & juicy.

Awesome oatmeal cookies! I refrigerated the dough for 1 hour before baking them and that made the cookies thicker. These cookies did not last very long in my house - they were gobbled up FAST!

AWESOME!!  I stuck with 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavored shortening.  I added a cup of quality shredded coconut + the nutmeg others recommended and I have to say, this was the best Oatmeal recipe I've used. I had family members who DON'T like Oatmeal Raisin cookies rave about it!!!

This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.  These cookies maintain a bit of puffiness instead of flattening out like those made just with butter.  I do soak my raisins in some rum (about 1/4 cup)for a few hours before I make these.

These were pretty good, but a little too spicy for my family. We like to taste more of the oatmeal flavor. Next time I'll halve the spices, including the vanilla.

I made these cookies yesterday. The recipe is easy and the cookies are perfect. We took a couple of the cookies on hike with us this morning and when we came across some ducks, we fed them little crumbs. Ducks loved them! Thanks for this recipe, I will use again.

I have found the perfect oatmeal cookie recipe!  This is everything I look for in a great oatmeal cookie.  I only made a few changes.  I added about a cup of chopped walnuts and a 6 oz package of crasins in place of the raisins.  I also baked them at 375 for 14 mins.  This recipe made 44 cookies made with the medium Pampered Chef scoop.  Just perfect thanks for the great recipe!

These are indeed excellent cookies. Without the cloves, they're the same cookies my grandma made for me off the back off the Quaker Oats can. These are the same cookies I've made for my children and grandchildren but we like to use allspice and all butter. The best oatmeal cookie recipe you'll ever find.

Excellent!  My roommates and I can't stop eating them!  Instead of the ground cloves, I subbed 1 tsp Chinese 5 Spice Powder (cinnamon, star anise, fennel, cloves, ginger, Szechuan peppercorn, white pepper) and 1/2tsp cinnammon, and added 1 cup finely chopped walnuts.  Yummmm....

These cookies are yummy! I made them last night and my picky-eater-boyfriend couldn't stop eating them.  He told me they were his favorite cookie I have ever made! I used parchment paper and it made baking a breeze! I just slid off the paper onto my counter top to cool.   The cookies are soft and chewy.  I love them.  I am makeing these often, that's for sure! :)

everyone in my family loves these cookies, and since none of us are big on raisins that is saying a lot! I made a batch and literally in less than 24 hours my two boys and husband had eaten them all! I managed to get a couple straight from the oven and they were really great. I made sure I watched them so as not to overcook them and I also have made them using 1/2 cup less oatmeal, I prefer a less chunky cookie myself, and both ways come out great! My oldest gets excited when he knows I am making them and asks for them in his lunch, and he is raisin phobic!! :)

I have made these cookies about 10 times! It was one of the first recipes that I ever got off of this website.  Everybody loves these cookies. They are chewy, spicy and the best oatmeal cookie ever! Every now and then I do add chocolate chips and it tastes great! I think the people who gave poor reviews don't know how to bake cookies. I have never had a problem with this recipe.

I am always a little skeptical of recipes that get 5 stars time and time again - they are never as good as I think/hope they will be. Thankfully, I was not disappointed this time! These cookies are absolutely delicious! Ok, I used nutmeg instead of cloves, but that was the only change I made. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks so much, Beth.

Wonderful cookies!  The amazing thing is, I am not a raisin lover, and I can't stop eating these things!  I did make a few slight changes based on some of the reviews I read.  Since I'm avoiding shortening and margarine (trans fats), I used all butter in this recipe.  The cookies spread beautifully (I form each spoonful of dough into a ball before baking) and there's no substitute for the wonderful taste of real butter.  I used ground Allspice instead on cloves (not a big fan of them), which really complimented the flavor of the cookies.  And since my oven runs hot, I reduced the baking temp to 325 degrees and baked about 11 minutes, which yielded perfect, golden cookies that were chewy with a slight crispness on the edge.  Awesome cookies!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! These were the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever! Baking always turn out as a disaster for me, but these were easy to make and they turned out great! I added a half cup of chopped walnuts and used half butter and half margerine. They came out very soft and chewy.

I wish they had 10 stars! I loved these cookies. After reading other reviews, I used 1 cup of butter instead of the shortening (only because I didn't have it on hand)and added 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg and allspice. I also soaked the golden raisins in very hot water that I added 1 tsp of vanilla too and let them sit for 1/2 hour before draining them and stirring in the dough. These are definitely my new favorite cookie. Try them you will not be disappointed!

My husband liked these cookies okay. I don't like cloves much, but even reducing the amount of cloves didn't make them my favourites. The cookies are small and not chewy enough for my liking. I thought them  too dry and consequently too crunchy. I'm looking to duplicate the Tim Horton's Oatmeal Cookie. That would be the ultimate.

Oh My!  My biggest pet peeve about Oatmeal Raisin Cookies is that there's not enough oatmeal, but this recipe was perfect.  I actually replaced a third of the flour with finely ground oatmeal, and it worked out great!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous and exactly what I've been searching for for years in an oatmeal cookie!  Flat, soft and chewy in the middle, crispy around the edges with the perfect home-made oatmeal cookie flavor.  The first batch is already almost gone and the rest are still waiting to be cooked!  I used just regular shortening (didn't have butter flavor) and skipped the raisins and obviously they came out just fine...

It's funny how some recipes just don't come out right for some people.  I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers on this one, however.  These cookies are just awesome.  Chewy and spiced just right.  I soaked my extra large raisins in hot water so they were nice and plump, and I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves because that is what I had.  They're going to work with me tomorrow and I know I'll be bringing home an empty container.

I have made this cookie for a couple of years now, and it is my favorite oatmaeal cookie.  People love the spices.  No one can guess that it is the cloves that make them a little different.  I have never had a problem with using the recipe as is.  Delicious!

I made these on request for a non-chocolate eating coworker. I thought they were good but not great. Husband says they are good.

These were chewy when cooked just a tad under, and they had a crunchy outside.  so great texture.  The taste wasn't quite what I expected for all the rave reviews.  I did add walnuts which made them a bit more interesting, but I'd add a bit more spice next time.

Good, but not great.  Mine turned out a little dry and not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I will stick to the Big Deluxe Pillsbury ready to bake, and same some time.  Thanks anyway Beth. I will try some of your other recipes.

Absolutely the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever made! Did 2 things different though. I let the raisins soak in very hot water for 1/2 hour then drained & towel dried them...and I didn't have ground cloves, so I used pumpkin pie spice. The cookies are incredibly moist and have a wonderful taste. The raisins came out plump & juicy. These cookies do not last long. I've made them for home and for work and everyone thinks I'm a wonderful cook! hehehe...Thank you Beth!

These were a little disappointing - not as tasty and special as I'd hoped.  A little on the dry side, and I didn't use quite all the flour and tried to underbake just a tad.  Liked the addition of cloves, I also added some chopped walnuts.

What a delicious cookie! The addition of cloves makes a subtle, but wonderful difference. I had company over for dinner and served these for dessert and they were a huge hit. Everyone was raving about how good they were and ate almost the entire container of them!

wow...i LOVED this recipe. it was so super good. it's nice to FINALLY find an oatmeal cookie recipe that doesn't go all flat. i definitely recommend making these. they are light and fluffy...a little crumbly, but it's okay, more for the munching :)

Yummy! My idea of a great cookie, moist and chewy.  Used all butter, didn't have the shortening and I used dark brown sugar. I soaked the raisins in warm water and a bit of vanilla for about an hour before baking. Everything else was as recipe called.  My husband, who "doesn't like oatmeal cookies" couldn't stop eating them.  Alot of reviewers stressed not to overbake and as a result I jumped the gun and underbaked the first batch, but the next batch turned out perfect.  Thank you so much Beth, I will be making these again and again.

Delicious cookies -- I soaked the raisins in water and 1 T brandy for about an hour before beginning the recipe.  There is just the right amount of sweetness and spiciness, in my opinion, but baking time must be monitored closely to attain the perfect consistency!  Thanks for sharing!

These cookies are very good.  The first time I made it, me and fiancee really liked it.  We pretty much finished it the next day.  So today I made it again but this time added a teaspoon of nutmeg.  Wow did it really taste good.  It gave it that extra spice I like.  Thanks for the recipe.

I took others advice and froze the dough first and I also substituted baking powder for the baking soda and used margerine instead of butter...They turned out great! It's the first time I have ever got oatmeal raisin cookies to stay plump.Thank You so much.

I think my expectations for these cookies were too high.  They were really good, don't get me wrong, but I don't think they were "exceptional".  I made them a bit bigger than recommended because rounded teaspoon is very small, rounded tablespoon seemed more appropriate.  I really liked the cloves in there!  It adds such a nice surprise!  I think this will be my standard Oatmeal Cookie recipe but I think I'll doctor it up from now on, maybe more raisins (you hardly notice they're there), some chocolate chip cookies, a bit of coconut, and probably a tad bit more vanilla, maybe even some finely chopped nuts.

These are very good cookies, but i changed the recipe a little. I left out the cloves, added 1/2 cup more flour and left out the butter and used all shortening. I never have a problem selling them in my bakery.

I am not a huge oatmeal cookie fan, but my husband is.  I have made about 5-6 different recipes and he always liked them, but he said this recipe was far greater than the others.  We could definately taste the spice from the cloves.  But I did do a few things different.  First, I made the cookies smaller, I managed to to squeeze out 5 dozen cookies.  I did have to reduce the baking time for this and I found that 8-9 minutes in a convection oven works best with the smaller ones.  Thank you so much for the great recipe, I will be making this over and over again.

These are good cookies, just not great as I was anticipating based on all the fabulous reviews.  The first batch I baked, following the recipe exactly, came out burnt.  The second batch I watched carefully and they were done at just under 10 minutes.  Instead of chewy as I was hoping for, ours were crunchy.  The taste I found to be basic oatmeal cookie, nothing to die for.

These cookies have to be the best my family has ever had. I used only brown sugar, and cut it by 1/4 cup.  I also used whole wheat flour and they were great. Thanks.

Very soft and yummy. I really liked the spices. The only thing I changed was instead of 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 butter, I just used 1 cup butter. It turned out fine with the change. I took them to a friends house, and they loved them! My father, who really likes raisin oatmeal cookies, also loved these. And then, when a friend of mine tried one of these cookies, she said that there are certain foods that are really enjoyable to eat, and these cookies are one of those!

These are the best oatmeal cookies ever.  The cloves give them that something extra and they smell wonderful when they are baking.  I make them about every other week now.

These cookies are absolutely perfect!  I doubled the batch right off the bat and I'm so glad I did.  I followed the recipe with 2 exceptions:  I only used 5 cups of oats (it seemed like plenty) and added chocolate chips to the last 2 or 3 dozen cookies.  I ended up with almost 8 dozen big, delicious cookies.  I had to bake them little longer because I used baking stones and they seemed soft when they came out but they firmed up.

This was the BEST Oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever tasted!!!
The only 2 things I changed were, instead of 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortning, I put 1 cup of butter and removed the shortening completely, and I used whole-wheat flour.
They are SO easy to make, even my husband makes them for me!
Try 'em, you'll love 'em :)

Perfect. I've made plenty of oatmeal raisin cookies before, but these were absolutely perfect. Everyone in my house loved them. They were just wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly and they truly are the best yet. The only advice I'd offer is to take your time when making these...I really relaxed and I believe it made all the difference. Thanks Beth!

Beth I will forever be grateful for this *INCREDIBLE*SOFT*CHEWY*COOKIE*RECIPE* This is my favorite style/flavor of cookie.  My sister in-law buys a frozen cookie dough like this and they are pricey.... I'm thrilled to be able to make these... My family gave them 2 thumbs up and file this recipe in the family keepsakes!!!  I believe I have found the best cookie I have ever baked and I've baked many.... Thanks for letting the tastebuds jump for joy!  We ended up with 12 *MONSTER SIZE COOKIES* :)

These were so yummy. I omitted the shortening and just used 1 cup of melted butter. They turned out soft, chewy, and delicious! (I also omitted the salt.)

Excellent - instead of butter and shortening I used margarine...turned out well.

I thought they were a little mushy when putting them on the baking sheet, but they turned out amazing

Beth wonderful recipe!  I've made many Oatmeal cookies and I have to say that this one was the best.  I think the cloves add a spectacular flavor and I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to spice it up some more, they were great.  note: to make a a perfectly round cookies take the dough in your hands and roll them into a ball. They'll really look store bought! I followed the recipe exactly and I had no problem, It is definitley a keeper!

Really good cookies.  This recipe is very similar to the "Vanishing Oatmeal Cookies" recipe found on Quaker Oats oatmeal canisters, except for the change to butter flavored shortening and the addition of cloves.  I do not like to use shortening except to grease pans, so basically I followed the Quaker Oats recipe and added cloves.  That recipe makes the best oatmeal cookies ever, so not surprising that these are also delicious.  My boyfriend suggested that the addition of cloves make these a more "grownup" cookie.

Wow! Warning, this mix is delicious uncooked, raw eggs and all. Baked, however, and it is sublime. I only made one change, using all butter instead of butter and shortening. It was great. Next time I may add some nuts as another reviewer suggested. Look out Mrs. Fields!

I think these are fantastic.  I did cook them for only 8 minutes so I would result in a chewier cookie.  I made them for my daughters who are 3 and 2.  I normally dont put raisins in my oatmeal cookies either,  but they were great.  I also think they would be great with nuts and some chocolate ships.  Thanks for sharing this recipe,  I will keep this on hand,  and will make again.

The few modifications from the typical oatmeal raisin recipe make a huge difference.  I also replaced about a 1/2 cup of flour with instant vanilla pudding mix to make them even softer.  I made them for my picky grandpa's brithday, and he raved about them for weeks!

GREAT cookie!  They do get brown really quickly so be careful.   My oven tends to get hotter in the back so I have to turn the sheet 180 degrees about half way through the baking time to make sure they bake evenly,  and only the edges get golden brown on these.  Any longer and they will get crispy after they cool off.

Ever since I made this cookie I get constant requests to make them again! My friend made herself sick from eating so many...she said they were addicting!  I use my pampered chef baking stone and they don't flatten out as much.  Excellent cookie!!

THESE WERE SOO WONDERFUL!  I DON'T MAKE COOKIES OFTEN CAUSE MOST RECIPES HAVE DISAPPOINTED ME, BUT THESE ARE PREMIUM.  I USED ONE OF MY SMALLEST ICE CREAM SCOOPERS (EQUALS ABOUT A TABLESPOON) THEY CAME OUT PERFECTLY SIZED AND ROUND (STORE BOUGHT SIZE) I'LL USE NUTS AND CHOC. CHIPS NEXT TIME. I SUBBED CAKE SPICE FOR CLOVE AN I ALSO SUBBED BUTTER FLAVORING INSTEAD OF VANILLA.

Wonderful cookie!  Co-workers thought they were  excellent.  I've now stopped looking for the best oatmeal cookie - 'cause this is it!  Thanks Beth.  I didn't have raisins - so I substituted white chocolate chips - very good - but next time if I use white chocolate (which is very sweet), I will decrease the sugar in the cookies a bit.  They would be wonderful though with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Versatile recipe.  Definitely a keeper and passer down!

These cookies are awesome!  I added 1/2 cup more raisins (we like raisins) and they were perfect.  I was baked them for a BBQ tomorrow but our neighbors and us ending up eating most of them, so I am baking another batch.  Thanks Beth for this recipe (and thanks from my family).

I think these are delicious!  I ended up using all butter instead of part shortening, because I didn't have the shortening.  I also ground up 1.t cups of the oats in the blender to make oat flour, and put in an additional 1/2 cup of rolled oats.  Oh, yeah, I also boiled the raisins and put in a handful of craisins.  Anyway, the basic recipe is great, and I don't agree with the other reviewers who said it was too spicy- they must have really sensitive taste buds!

My family eats these as fast as I can make them.  It is very easy to overbake these, though.  I use a silpat sheet to prevent them sticking in the pan.

Excellent cookies - I get requests to make them by friends.  I use 1 1/2 tsp of cloves though ... love the spicy taste.

These came out really well, though I wish I had the butter flavored shortening and cloves (which I think would have added more punch) Very tasty and hold their shape very well - would be a great bake sale cookie.

These are very good oatmeal cookies.  The cloves really add an extra kick.  Will definitely make them again.

As everyone else has said, this is basically the same recipe on the underside of the lid of the Quaker Oats package.  My first batch came out way too flat, even though it still tasted great.  I tried again using all margarine, and 1/2 tsp of baking soda + 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  I also chilled the dough for about 5-10 minutes before putting onto the cookie sheets.  This produced a much more desirable texture.  Also ran out of brown sugar, and substituted a half cup of white sugar for the missing amount, and it still came out fine!  Tastes great!

These are my favorite! It also works well if you put all-spice and ginger instead of ground cloves.

This is another one that I continue to make, over and over again. I do from time to time...tend to change them around a little. Sometimes I will leave out the raisns and I do an icing on them and then when readily available....I still omit the raisns but use cinamon chips. Anyway you make them though...they are amazing!

fantastic! i have never made oatmeal raisin cookies before so this was kindof a trial and error thing for me, but i was very happy with the results. hot out of the oven, i simply could not stop eating them!! after cooling, i thought they were maybe a tad too sweet. i may decrease the sugar next time. or, it could be that i used golden raisins, which can be sweeter than regular. whatever the case, i will definitely be making these again!

Excellent recipe. I've already baked them twice and everyone who's tried them can't get enough of them. They have an addictive flavor. Two things that I changed for my own preference is that I made it ALL butter, rather than the half butter, half shortening.  Also, I love the clove taste in them, so I doubled the amount of cloves the recipes call for from 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp.

These have to top all the other oatmeal cookies recipes I've made and tried. Everyone at work and others loved them. I didn't have any cloves, so I used ground ginger ... they were great. Will make again and again.

Made this twice for the kids at the daycare center. Went over really well. Used double the amount of margarine instead of shortening which I never use. Turned out nice and chewy with soft texture. Would make again, especially using dried cranberries.

All I can say is that these are just ok.  These don't remind me of the oatmeal cookies my mom use to make.  I made the recipe exact except for the butter flavored shortening.  I honestly don't think that made a difference.  I do think personally it calls for too many oats and too many rasins.  I also think they were not as sweet as i thought they would be.  Perhaps if I changed the recipe accordingly to my taste buds they would be better.  I will definately look for a better recipe.

This is by far the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever tried, and it's already become a family favorite. I didn't have butter flavored shortening on hand so I used plain and the cookies still turned out very well. Quick and simple to make.

These cookies are great!  I added a little ginger to it and substituted whole wheat flour for regular flower.  The result was a great oatmeal cookie!  I wish I had had walnuts handy to throw in with the raisins, that would have made them perfect!  I recommend trying these!

These were really good cookies. The spices were very familiar and reminded me of Thanksgiving (pumpkin pie!). My cookies came out a little too soft, so I would recommend cooking them a few minutes longer. This is a unique cookie recipe and it gives you a warm happy feeling when you eat them.

Incredibly tasty cookies. I followed the suggestions of others and added nutmeg. My husband loves oatmeal raisin cookies and he insists I use this recipe when I make them for him.

This recipe is delicious!  It's amazing what a bit of ground cloves will do for oatmeal raisin cookies!  What flavor!  These are my husband's favorite!

I don't bake, and I found this recipe yesterday because my boyfriend likes Oatmeal Raisin cookies so I thought I would give it a try today.   I love them. I know he will love them too.  Next time I will add more raisins and I will try adding chocolate chips.  Thank you.

These oatmeal cookies are delicious. I omitted the raisins and I used regular Crisco shortening instead of butter flavor, and I also omitted the cloves. My son-in-law and my grandson Jonathan loved them. They were also very easy to make. Thanks. Joyln

These are very good, don't overcook and they will be just a little crispy on the edges and so soft and chewy in the middle.  Not particularly spicy, but maybe my cloves are old.

Just made these cookies for my father-in-law and they are delicious!  I am a total chocoholic, so I wasn't sure that I would like them, but I do.  They hold their shape and are full, but not airy or fluffy.  They don't get flat either.  I substituted a bag of cinnamon chips for the raisins, and it was a great switch.  Will be making these again.

Wanting to do something nice for my family and knowing that oatmeal cookies are their favorite, I made after reading the reviews.  Let me tell you my nephews and fiance ate them within two days and begged for more!  This has got to be the best oatmeal cookie recipe ever!  Thanks Beth!

I gave this five stars for bieng simply deliscious. Funny thing I noticed though, if you have ever looked on the back of the Quaker Oats oatmeal lid, there ais a recipe called Vanishing Oatmeal cookies, and this recipe is identical except that these have 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup shortening as apposed to the original vanishing cookie which uses a full 1 cup of butter only. too funny. and this has just added ground cloves, it's practically the same recipe. Nice try though, really good still!

Just the recipe I've been looking for!!! I plumped my rasins too, added 1 pkg vanilla pudding mix
 to keep them moist.  Going to keep them covered to keep them soft. Thank you so
much for sharing.

These were good.  However, I substituted quick-cooking oats, and I would definately not do that again.  They just didn't turn out the same way than with the old-fashioned.  Other than that, they were great!

Everyone loved these cookies! Next time I will use a half cup less of oatmeal to make the cookies a little more chewy. I found them just a touch dry for my taste.

I had to try these cookies, after making Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies!!  I wasn't
disappointed at all! These cookies were the best!! I didn't have cloves, so I made
them without, and I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins.  They turned out
WONDERFUL!  They tasted divine.  Everybody loved them.

True to  her word, these cookies are chewy and have an excellent spiced-flavor!  Also, I had to hide these cookies because my family went crazy.  My son wanted them for breakfast--hard to argue that point!

I didn't think I liked oatmeal cookies--until NOW!  These are wonderful--the flavour!  the chewiness!  Raisins aren't my favourite things so I left them out; believe me, I never missed them.  Bake these cookies today; they are a real treat!

Super good Splenda cookies from this recipe.  I used the same recipe + 2 tablespoons of butter and Splenda instead of sugar and regular oatmeal (not instant). I used small cookie scoop and made 6 dozen small cookies. The recipe was perfect, 12 minutes cook time. with parchment paper.

These cookies are best if you do not put them in fridge before baking.  Also do not over bake them, pull them out of the oven when they are just slightly under being fully cooked.  And with any cookie, when they're done baking leave them on the cookie sheet for 5 mins before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling.

Good recipe.  I used palm oil instead of butter flavored shortening and used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 granulated raw sugar,  made them large and baked for 22 minutes.  They came out very nice.

Great recipe! Just a few things I did differently; I used regular, unflavored, shortening, I added an 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg and I used old fashioned oats. I did keep the dough in the refrigerator in between batches. Which made it so the dough wasn't too sticky to form. The cookies are awesome! I live in the Midwest and 10 minutes at 350 degrees was perfect.

Where has this recipe been all my life?  I am in love with this recipe.  Normally oatmeal cookies are not my favorite, but this recipe may just change that.    My search for the perfect oatmeal cookie has been found, one more item checked off my cooking bucket list. Thank you.

Make sure you have fresh raisins!!!! Mine were a bit old and you can taste that they are stale which is too bad. I read the reviews before I started this one like many others! The ways I differed from the recipe:
- I used all butter (as I didn't have shortening);
- I used quick oats instead of rolled oats;
- added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon;
- added 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg; and,
- added 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger.
Cookies turned out really well! They are a bit soft for my liking, but could be due to the all butter or oat type. The flavour of the spices are amazing!

I like this recipe. The cloves is a nice touch. I used all butter instead of half shortening and substituted almond extract for the vanilla then added 3/4 cup raisins and 3/4 cup dried cranberries plus 3/4 cup of coconut. I pressed them into a 11x16 pan to make bars, baking for about 20 min. and they were a flavor sensation

These were quite good! Aside from subbing out the cloves for cardamom (because that’s what I had), I veganized this recipe, switching out the 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening for 1 cup butter flavored coconut oil and the eggs for flax egg (1 tbsp ground flax seed + 3 tbsp water = 1 flax egg). I also threw in some muesli that I knew I wouldn’t be using anytime soon and some ground coconut flakes, cutting them into the overall quantity of rolled oats. Okay, now that I’ve spelled it out, I realize I changed a lot! ??????? Oh well...??????? They were delicious though. Thanks Beth!!!

Yummy! Except the shortbread I never baked any cookies; so yesterday (29th Dec 2019- historic day) when my family mentioned about oat and raisin cookies, I decided to try and based on number of reviews I decided on this recipe. Since I had only 1/2 cup of golden raisins, I decided to half the recipe and decided to match the quantity of sugar with just brown sugar packed. It was great but you know when you get comments from the critique of the house ‘Wow that’s great but if you had blah blah’! So I was the one who thought it was not good decision to use all brown sugar of mentioned quantity. I added 3 teaspoons of white sugar and voila that was a ten star to the recipe! 
Lesson learnt: if you want to use only brown sugar add about 2T more than the recipe called for.
RATING: Loved it and it’s in my favourites now... do I need   to say  more.

The end product after my corrections turned out amazing! I love the flavor the cloves give these cookies and it gives it a more christmasy flavor. The recipe states to bake at 350, but I found the cookies weren’t baking properly, so I turned it to 375 according to the regular oatmeal cookie recipe on the oatmeal container. I also added a couple more minutes, about 14 minutes in total to really give it the crispy outside but soft inside.

I can't say it was bad or good because I changed the recipe to all butter as some reviewers have done.  I did not have any butter flavored shortening so I figured why not, people have had good results . Not me, I followed all other directions to a T but I basically got 2 giant cookies .

These were amazing!  I made a few substitutions based on other reviewers' comments.  I used regular shortening instead of butter shortening since this was what I had.  I also substituted All Spice for the Cloves, and Splenda baking mix for the white sugar to cut down on calories.  My family LOVED them!! This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

The easiest and most delicious recipe. I used an ice cream scoop to mold the cockiest dough and get chunkier cookies. Had to bake them to 15 min as the cookies were thick. Turned out great!

Added an extra 1/2 tsp as reviewers suggested & soaked raisins for 10 min in boiling water/drained.  I also added ~1 cup chopped walnuts.  Flattened slightly with fork before baking.  (First batch was too puffy when I didn't press with fork.)  Baked for 8-9 minutes.  Good recipe.

This is a good oatmeal cookie, but the ground cloves were too aggressive for our tastes.

I followed the recipe (always do the first time and then modify if necessary) and wouldn’t change a thing! My husband raved about these cookies.  Love this recipe!

great cookies....soft in middle and crispy on outside.  Not a fan of butter flavoured shortening so substituted coconut oil for the shortening.  Came out great.

Delicious!  I have an old raisin cookie recipe that my Mom had that suggested you cover the raisins with water, bring to a low boil, and add the baking soda into the raisins.  Really plumps them up!

Excellent.  I will be making this often.  omitted cloves cause husband doesn’t like otherwise followed exactly. I did pre soak raisin in hot water.  Baked for 11 min, my oven tends to run lower and my times seem to be on the higher end

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  These cookies are great with NO changes to the original recipe.  Oatmeal cookies can be slightly boring but with the addition of cinnamon and cloves it takes it to the next level.  I baked mine for an extra 2-3 minutes but it could be my oven.

I make these cookies a lot.  The hint of spice is subtle but puts them beyond the average oatmeal cookie.  I use all butter rather than the half and half called for.

I've made this recipe several times and they've always turned out delicious! Instead of using all the different spices listed - as I don't always have them on  hand - I just use 2 tsp (or more!) of pumpkin spice. They're a hit every time!

I really liked this recipe. It was a little too sweet for me though, so next time I will reduce the sugar. I also used bacon grease instead of oil/margarine and added coconut. It was really good... rave reviews from the family

These were excellent! I think using part butter, part shortening make them nice and chewy.  These will be my go to oatmeal cookies. And contrary to what other reviewers said, they are not the same recipe on the oatmeal box. There's more brown sugar in this recipe and shortening has been added instead of all butter, and the cloves, of course!

Very yummy cookie recipe, soft and chewy....I did make a few changes based on my own personal preference....I used one cup of butter and skipped the shorting, and I forgot to add the white sugar but did not miss it at all...I think next time I make these I will cut back on the brown sugar a bit as well...they are plenty sweet enough.

I love these. I make a healthier version by using all grass-fed butter (no margarine), no white sugar, less brown sugar plus molasses, and almond flour in place of the white flour.

I first made these cookies when my husband and I began dating because this is his favorite kind, but forgot where I found the recipe until stumbling across it now. I’d never made oatmeal raisin before, and honestly never ate them because they looked boring. In making these for my new boyfriend, I burned my arm on the oven rack but the cookies turned out great! Now we’ve been married 9 years, and I still have a burn scar on my arm and often use the line “I burned myself for you!” Thanks for a tasty recipe and wonderful contribution to our story together. :)

I did make a few "adjustments", but love these! I used baking powder instead of baking soda, the cookies seem to be puffier and lighter this way. Also used craisins and nuts, as I don't care for raisins, and like nuts! Otherwise follow directions on letting them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute or two after removing from oven. Helps them "set" a little better.

I didn’t make any changes and I made 3 batches, separately,  and the neighbors, a party, some to my sister in law and my wife and I enjoyed the  rest.
All of the folks who enjoyed them wanted the recipe so I told them where to find it.

I added 1/2 cup coconut & 1/2 cup black walnuts.  The clove taste was too strong.  I will use apple/pumpkin pie spice to replace it next time.

I made it exactly as called for and the cookies were great!  I did however, use parchment paper on the baking pan so it took 15 minutes to get the bottoms crispy while the centers were chewy.  I'll definitely make again.

This one has been in my recipe box for years, but I haven't made them in a long time.  I'd forgotten what a perfect recipe it is!  Made them last night for our church home group that will meet this evening (but I just had one for breakfast).  I know they'll give rave reviews too.  Soft, chewy with just the right amount of spices.

The cookies are great. I used all butter, as some have said. I also threw in a few chocolate chips that I had, and since that made the dough thicker, I added just a few drops of water. The magic time in my oven was 11 minutes, and they came out great. I found that lining my baking sheets with parchment worked better than aluminum foil, as the recipe suggested. Overall, the recipe was easy, and delicious, and I will make it again.

I made the recipe as written & the cookies tasted great but fell apart when lifting them off the cookie sheet after the wait time.  My oven is new so perhaps isn’t the correct temp.

I really scoured all the reviews and was looking forward to these cookies.  they didn't ,however live up to my expectations. I found them to be just mediocre. Perhaps this wasn't the right recipe as I was imagining a crisper, chewier cookie. I also thought they could do without the raisins altho perhaps without them they would have been really dull.

I used 2 sticks of butter instead of butter and shortening.   I also used 2.5 instead of a full 3 cups of oats.  I think I will use about a half cup more raisins next time.  Loved the cookies.  They were moist and tasty .

so good!  usually my oatmeal cookies fall apart. But these didn't. I went with the other suggestions and just used butter. but I had to cook for 12 minutes. outside is nice and crispy but the inside is tender. and they have just the right amount of spice.

These are perfect! I think I might name them “spiced” instead of spicy, but they are fabulous. Word of warning: it’s best not to chill this dough. Or at least bring them to room temperature before you bake them. I’m wondering if some of the reviews about them being runny is because the dough was chilled, which was what I found to be the case.

I made these and they are AWESOME !!  May have to vary the baking time.  I also used all Becel Margarine and it worked out fine as I didn't have any extra butter on hand. I used the spices in recipe but also added 1/4 tsp allspice. The flavor blend was excellent, the texture was soft inside and a slight crisp to the edges. This is definitely a keeper as there is room for slight adjustments to your own preference. KEEPER, KEEPER, KEEPER !!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I don’t bake and I don’t cook. My husband does (he is a chief). I don’t like cookies and I don’t eat them. But my husband was out of town and I wanted to surprise him by doing something “unusual”. So, I baked. I had to wait for him to get home, so that he can tell me if cookies came out good or not. First thing he said “where did you buy them? Those are really good”. It took me a few minutes to convince him that I baked them myself. He liked the recipe very much. He said that “it is a keeper”. I guess, I will do it again. Note: I added white chip chocolate (he likes white chocolate). PS: happily married for 20 years.

Didn’t change a thing except for cooking time! They taste so flavorful, and had great flavor. I did put the dough in the fridge overnight and add about 3 min to the cooking time and the cookies ended up getting a healthy color to them. They came out a tad crispy on the edges and soft on the inside- very good tasting!

This is THE best oatmeal cookies I’ve had. I didn’t have raisins so I used craisin cranberries. Oh my gosh, me and 3 other people couldn’t stop. I even ate them for a breakfast cookie. Awesome, thank you. This is now the only recipe I’ll use

I used 1 1/2 cup of raisins, soaked in hot water for 5 minutes, then drained. I used pumpkin spice instead of cloves. And baked 9 minutes. They were awesome!

Perfect cookies. I took the advice of a baking expert friend and mixed the butter, sugar and eggs for EIGHT MINUTES to get it completely creamed together. I also used whole wheat flour, walnuts and cranberries for extra flavor, and whew boy. These are beyond words. This is what you're going for when you say, "Hey, I've got oatmeal. Let's make cookies!" God bless :)

I used all butter.  Otherwise followed as directed.  Someone made a comment to do steps one at a time and not rush or over work...I found this to be good advice.  For me..I didn't look at the quantity!  Made way too many.  But, my husband likes them.  Maybe we can share!!

THese are my go-to oatmeal raisins cookies. They turn out perfect every time and they go quickly whenever I take them anywhere. I always bake them until they are very lightly browned around the edge and a little undercooked in the middle. They will finish up on the pan and set very nicely without being too crispy. Yum!

These had a delicious flavor however, for me, it had too many oats. I decreased the oats to 2 cups and increased the raisins to 2 cups . The cloves add that special flavor that makes you feel as if it’s fall !

And I have my special twist:  I soak the raisins in bourbon.  Sometimes I have to add a little extra flour b/c I toss in the bourbon too.  Yum.

I thought these were fine.  I did increase the recipe by 50% to make larger cookies.  They came out chewy and moist; baked just 11 minutes.  However, I wasn't as keen on the strength of the cloves taste.

Review on flavor: definitely lacking. I used golden raisins (I prefer them over regular), old fashioned oats, and actually added an extra bit of the called-for spices, and they were pretty bland. My mom literally makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies I’ve EVER had so I was not necessarily expecting better than those.... but I was hoping for better flavor than a store-bought cookie.

These cookies are just what I was hoping for!  Just the right spice and texture. I did use a little extra cinnamon and a sprinkle of nutmeg along with the cloves the recipe called for. I also plumped the raisins. After reading reviews I decided to try replacing part of the shortening/butter mixture with applesauce and I added a couple of extra tablespoons of flour hoping to prevent them from flattening out too much. It must have worked because they couldn’t have turned out better!  Baked for 13 minutes at 350. Made 5 dozen.

Have never been a Oatmeal cookie fan but our son-in-law loves them.  Decided to surprise him for Fathers Day.  I followed the exact recipe, go figure, and it is wonderful.  Hope he likes them as well.  I think the clove really stands out and make it go from ok to AWESOME.

Every last one of Beth Sigworth's cookies are amazing. This is one of my two favorites. I'd like to suggest you try another of my favorites by her, Mrs. Sigg's snickerdoodles. They are every bit as amazing as this recipe. To people with negative reviews, please be sure you follow a recipe exactly and that your ingredients are fresh before posting a review. These cookies are absolutely amazing every time I make them, as all of Beth Sigworth's cookies are. So much if she ever wrote a cookbook I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

These cookies are amazing!  I soaked my raisins in some amaretto so they were nice and plump.  I shared and wish I hadn't, they are that great.

I made this recipe with below alterations. I didn’t have shortening so substituted it with 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter. I also used 1 + 1/4 cups brown sugar and 2 tbsp of honey. I baked these at 165 C for 20 minutes..
Everyone loved them !!

Hubby didn't like the nutmeg, but everyone else loved it.  We planned to take the cookies to "cards with the ladies", but the rest of the household would not allow them to leave the premises!!  These were just wonderful just as written.  We added a few chocolate chips that we happened to have left over, but they would have been great without them too!  Great recipe.  Thanks!

I sell home baked cookies around my area, and I made these originally for my partner who loves oatmeal raisin cookies. Well I had (tons) extra and my mom decided to take some to her work, and well, let’s just say that I have sold 5 dozen of these in a WEEK! I have definitely put my own twist on them, but I absolutely love these cookies.

This is a good recipe but if you dont cook them for atleast 9 minutes, they will want to fall apart or break in half just from moving it .  9 minutes seems to be perfect. I didnt add the cloves and I added 1 cup of dried cranberries instead of raisons and they are delicious........

I used 1 cup of butter instead of  half shortening/half butter. These cookies are wonderful and smell great while baking! Don't bake too long; only took about 10 minutes plus 2 mins to cool.

I just found this recipe to produce fairly dry cookies that were  too biscuit like.  Not the type of cookie I like.  I even out  back on flour by at least 1/2 cup.

Good, but a little too sweet. I used apricots instead of raisins. I would make it again but would reduce the amount of sugar.

OMG!! These cookies are delicious! I followed the recipe as directed, except I used 1 cup of butter instead of shortening. I also added nutmeg, ginger, and extra cinnamon as others have stated. I used parchment paper and baked for 10 min. The cookies turned out soft and chewy. I baked these for my husband for Valentine’s Day! He absolutely loved them.

These are excellent cookies! I halved the recipe and got 27. They are soft, chewy and a little crunchy with a nice blend of spices. I used all butter (maybe that's why they came out a little flat?). In any case, they're delicious! I also added a little more raisins, and found baking at 8-9 min worked for me. I've had several already and needed to put these in a closed container very quickly!!! UPDATE: Followed recipe using regular shortening (not butter-type). Kept in a container, they stay moist for a quite a while.

Followed recipe (almost) exactly. But my dough was way too dry, so I eye balled a splash of milk. Took forever to work it into the dough!! But ziplocked it and put in fridge overnight. (I was too tired to bake some by then). By next night the dough was perfect!! Only change was I omitted cloves (only had whole ones and I don't like anyway) but threw in a little ground ginger and a few rasps of fresh grated nutmeg!! And poached raisins in 1/2 inch water, drained, let cool then added, plus used 1/2 regular raisins. Don't remember bake times but I made huge cookies and flattened a bit before baking. And I got thick, soft, chewy cookies!! Definitely making again, with above adjustments. Still have dough left that I will freeze. No idea how that will work out though. Great base recipe!! :-)

On about my 7th batch now.  This is the BEST.  I took advice and used all butter but just because I didn't have the shortening on-hand.  Perfect.  I also boiled my raisins for a little while to soften.  Having a family who loves spicy, I doubled all the spices.  You cannot mess this up, people!  Thank you for such a great cookie!!!

This is identical to the Oatmeal cookies receipe in Bettery Crockers, with 2 eggs rather than 1, and no nuts. Otherwise identical.

If I could give these ten stars, I would!  I made these exactly as the recipe was written EXCEPT I substituted dates for raisins because that is what I had on hand.  They were fantastic!  I will continue to use this recipe and I will also continue to use dates because my family loved these so much.  Now, a note on baking... everyone's oven is different.  I had to set my oven to 375 and cook for 15 minutes for the cookies to slightly start to brown around the edges.  The results were a soft chewy cookie with an ever so slightly crisp bottom.

These are below average cookies. Very bland.  I will not be making these again.  I was excited about these cookies from the many reviews,  but the product is sub standard.

I agree it is the BEST!! Thanks, Beth!  I made the cookies exactly by the recipe and could not keep them on the plate!! Form cookie on a flat spoon and scoop onto sheet to cook. Cook no longer than 10 mins. Everyone loved them!!!

Used this recipe as the base for caramel apple oatmeal cookies, so the only thing omitted was the cloves, and I used a half cup of dried apples, and a half cup of salted caramel chips instead of raisins.  They turned out so good!!  Wouldn't have worked without a good basic oatmeal cookie recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

The best. Always a hit at the party. I tried another oatmeal cookie recipe and was disappointed. I'm making these for Christmas and sticking with it.

I actually make these about 9 minutes for those who like them chewy & 12 or so minutes for those who like it dry & crispy. They’re good either way!

12/20/17:  Great taste.  I used craisins instead of raisins and used all butter.  They did turn out pretty flat, though.  Perhaps chill the dough first next time.

Great cookies. I used all butter and 1 1/2 c of raisins because we like raisins and I didn't have the Crisco. Highly recommend!!

I made these for my hubby since oatmeal cookies are his favorite. He really liked them. I tasted them the next day and after the first bite I couldn't stop eating them. This is going to be my go to oatmeal cookie recipe from now on.

I made it with all butter, and substituted cardamom for the cloves. I don't even like raisins, but these were great! Next time, I'm going to sub out the raisins for raisins, and add some chopped walnuts. Yummmm!!!

I loved these cookies!  I did make a couple changes, based on what I had available and some of the reviews.  I used 1 cup of butter (no butter-flavored shortening), added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and substituted currants for the raisins (I didn't have any raisins in my cupboard). They turned out pretty good, although just a BIT crumbly.  I would suggest to let them cool completely before moving them to an airtight storage container. Otherwise, SO EASY to make! And this recipe makes a few cookies over 3 dozen medium-sized cookies (if you measure the dough out with a tablespoon).

I love these cookies. I used all butter, and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp allspice. They are chewy, buttery, and spicy. Perfect for Christmas time. Mine were cooked perfectly at 12 minutes. Update 2019: Still a family favorite, and the only oatmeal cookie recipe I use! I like to use dark brown sugar just to add a bit more flavor. Great recipe! Will convert any non-oatmeal-raisin-cookie lover with just one bite!

This was a good cookie although I wasn't "wowed". I think it is a matter of preference. I would make it again but not the best I have ever had. My cookie was flat and kind of chewy. I think it would be even better with coconut.

I have made two batches of this cookie.  It is the best I and my husband have ever had.  The last batch I put in some cranberries and chopped hazelnuts.  I baked them for 11 minutes to a nice golden brown.  Simply delicious!

I'm making these cookies now.  I'm on my 3rd pan full, and they are getting eaten as fast as I take them off the cookie sheets.. no changes made, except I only had regular shortening,  so used that.  I didn't have cloves, so added a couple of shakes of pumpkin pie spice.. And I plumped the raisins.  They are fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe.

Those cookies are very good and easy. Use the flower and eggs. We can cook those in us kitchen in only one hour.

Came out perfect and so good the 1st time making!  Very chewy and moist!  But like all cookies I bake, to sweet for my liking.

This recipe was outstanding. I chilled the cookie dough for an hour to try to keep them from spreading and they came out perfect. I'm not sure about the "spicy" title to the cookies. I was worried that there would be too much spice flavor with the cloves but it was very subtle and just perfect. My new recipe!!

I give 3 stars for this recipe. It is ok for me. I think I put to much sugar in ingredients,but ,if I put less sugar , it also not very nice. The amount of sugar is key of this recipe.

I find that sometimes the dough dries out too quickly and that it almost has too strong of a baking powder flavour (chemical-like flavour). I tried adding vanilla extract and bit more brown sugar to disguise the flavour. It seemed to work however this recipe works best if you are not in a rush and can take your time. the cooling off period of the cookies is ESSENTIAL!

the recipes is good, but a little weakness is the sugar is too much. after I ate the cookies, I must drink water with that, cuz is too sweet. Maybe is my mistake add too much sugar. and another point is in the process, should add "stir the sugar and flour before they pass the net." Why? cuz i ate a stone in the cookie!

I substituted  1 cup margarine.  Baking on silicone sheets gave even light brown bottoms, slighly chewy texture.  I had to increase bake time by 4 minutes. The amount of spices was just right.  I will use this recipe again.

Sooooo good! My wife is an oatmeal cookie fanatic and told me these were the best she's ever had. We used 1 cup of unsalted butter instead of the butter/shortening combo but kept the rest of the recipe the same. Regarding baking time, all ovens are different and vary in temperature, and cookie size is going to vary as well, but its worth noting that our first batch took 16 minutes  before being solid enough to remove to a cooling rack without falling apart.  For the remaining batches we used the convection oven setting at 325 and they were perfect after 11 minutes, and still moist after a day. Unfortunately (for us) we made these cookies to give away and only kept a few in the house. I'll be making these again... very soon!

I very much enjoyed these cookies. I increased the amount of cinnamon and cloves by rounding the measuring spoons. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom and 1/2 cup of coconut.

My cookies were more a tablespoon full in size and took about 12-13 minutes to cook.

These are quick and easy. I followed the recipe with a few small changes. I did what others recommended: soaked the raisins in warm water 10 minutes, patted dry then sprinkled them with flour. I also pulse processed the oats the 
 a few seconds. I added 1/2 cup mini chocolate morsels. I baked them on parchment paper at 300 degrees for 15 minutes as a reviewer suggested but left the second batch in for 15 min and 30 seconds since every oven is different.
They came out baked through with a perfectly chewy texture. 
I got 45 cookies dropped by rounded heaping teaspoons.
Love the slight flavor of cloves! Thank you for this great recipe!

Good cookie. I didn't have ground cloves so I used nutmeg instead. Turned out fine. This recipe makes quite a few cookies. Sent them to work with my husband who said they were a big hit.

Made as directed! Perfect!  You could change it to less shortening and use more butter but the balance of both works best! I only change ingredients when I'm out of something in the cupboards. Awesome taste ,my kids and all my customers love them! Thanks

Delish.  Made as directed except for sneaking in some super foods that didn't alter the taste. I added 1 tbsp of each of the following: chia seeds,  hemp seeds, sesame seeds, flax seed, poppy seeds and uncooked quinoa seed. In the last half of the batter I added 2 tbsp of cacao nibs for just a touch of good for you dark chocolate. It paired great with the raisins. Thanks for a terrific recipe. I will be making these again and again.

I made these as a gift for a guy who gifted us with his wonderful peat moss and compost. I combined butter with shortening as called for, and added a tiny bit of real butter flavoring as suggested. I added Wheat Montana rolled oats. I presoaked the raisins as suggested. I added a half cup of small NC pecans to provide for a nice crunch. When dropped on the cookie sheet they were nice high piles of yummy goodness. While baking they went flat - totally flat, as another reviewer had experienced. I have over 40 years of baking experience and this is the second time I've incorporated shortening into a cookie recipe, both times having them go flat. In the future I will just use butter no matter what the recipe says. I still sent them as a gift because the spiced flavor is good.

I made these for the first time Friday and family is asking me to make them again today, Monday. They were delicious! The only thing I'll probably do differently is cut the amount of cloves in half.  It's very powerful.

These cookies are great!  I followed the recipe. The only thing I did different was soak the raisins in hot water for ten minutes as some people had recommended.  The cookies were soft and chewy with a great flavor.

I made these cookies today for the first time in quite a while...  I'd forgotten how delicious they are...  I got about 5 1/2 dozen cookies from the dough...  I made them for a friend whose 10 year old great-granddaughter is coming to visit for a few days...  I think they'll be a hit...

Replaced the flour with 180 grams GF flour blend, plus 1 t xanthan gum.  Used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C plain shortening instead of butter flavored.  Replaced raisins with dried cranberries, and added some dark chocolate chips.  Added an extra 50% spice.  Stellar!  (Next time I'm going to add some toasted pecans too.)

Didn't have buttered flavored shortening on hand and used regular shortening.  Still felt they were very good.  Yes, I would make them again.

Great easy cookies to make. They are delicious. I usually double the recipe and then freeze (baked cookies)  half of them. My husband loves them and once he's done with the bag that's out he's in the freezer taking out the other bag! Our favorite cookie.

I made these again last night, and I’m reminded of why these are my all-time favorite cookies I’ve ever made and ever eaten.  These have been my go-to for years.  I follow the recipe exactly and bake for exactly 10 min.  I love cookies that are crisp on the edges but soft in the middle of course.  They are still perfect and soft the next day when baked for the minimum time.

This is a really good cookie. I couldn't get mine to flatten out very much, but that may be me and not the recipe. Next time it will try to rehydrate the raisins before adding them to see if that makes a difference. I will definitely make these again!

I am very picky about my oatmeal raisin cookies. They have to have flavor - and most importantly - be soft and chewy. As long as these are not overcooked (which is easy to do if not watching closely) they are perfect. I can't keep my hands off of them! I followed the recipe exactly except I used regular shortening since that was all I had on hand. I am eager to see if the butter flavored shortening really makes a difference. All in all super tasty and easy recipe that I was able to make in no time with the help of my stand mixer. Also, on a side note, this IS NOT the same recipe that is on the quaker oats container. Yes, they are similar, but the increments  and added spices are different. The difference in the increments alone will have an impact on cookie taste and texture.

Followed the recipe except per husband's request I added an additional 1/2 cup of raisins. I think it would have been just as yummy without it, but he likes lots of raisins in his cookies. I had to cook them just a little longer (my oven desperately needs to be recalibrated) but otherwise these were super simple to make.

I LOVE these!! My parents wanted a healthy alternative to a chocolate chip cookie and this was it! The spices are nice and create a warm sensation that is pleasing to the taste. I normally use coconut oil in all of my homemade cookie recipes so I substituted the shortening for coconut oil in this recipe as well. It makes the cookies a whole lot healthier and adds the tiniest bit of coconut flavor as well. I still love my chocolate chip and snicker doodle cookies but I have to admit that these are hard to beat!!

Perfect, and delicious.  The only changes I made are not necessary, but, I liked the result- instead of vanilla extract, I used 1 t of molasses, and I also added some ground ginger because I like the extra spiciness .

These are delicious! I had to alter the flour because I was out of all purpose flour! I used 1/2 C. of whole wheat bread flour and  1 C. of cake flour! I know, I know, quite the adjustment!!! However, the cookies came out fabulous and I can't stop taste-testing them! I cooked them exactly 11 minutes on parchment paper and followed all the other directions to the T. I was hesitant as I was mixing that they were going to be dry but they aren't, they're perfect :)

These were pretty good. Only thing I did different from recipe is added 1 tsp. rum extract and 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans I had leftover from another recipe. I did steep the raisins first to keep cookies moist, but even so they were a little on the dry side and did not spread at all. Thinking that if I make these again I would reuce the oats just a bit and perhaps add a bit more butter or shortening.

So good!!! Use all butter (salted) and eliminate the extra salt. Increase spices to 2-tsp cinnamon, 1-tsp cloves. Bake at 325 in convection oven, done to perfection at 9-min on light coloured pans. Also amazing when you swap the raisins for butterscotch chips.

This is a simple and perfect oatmeal raisin cookie recipe. I did use all butter but only because that's all I had on hand, I'm sure it would be great either way. Also after baking the first couple dozen at the 1 teaspoon size suggested, I really felt they were too small for my cookie-liking! So I made them closer to 1 tablespoon and baked for about 13 minutes. Came out perfect and they're still chewy three days later! Although the jar has dwindled by half thanks to my boyfriend!

This is a good recipe and I always add cloves  just because they add such a special taste. I didn't have raisins on hand so I substituted half a cup of currants and a half cup of cinnamon chips . The mixture seemed a little dry so I added some extra milk. They turned out moist and chewy. Good cookie!

I like the softness and the taste of these cookies, but since I don't like to use shortening  ( that is why the 4 stars) and used applesauce instead- the texture wasn't the crunchy but chewy I was hoping for (oh well). Next time I may add a tad more flour to see if they hold up a bit better. I used pumpkin pie spice like the others, and used tart dried cherries since that is all I had on hand.

I thought these were great, but what would you expect me to say?  Except the neighbors and friends I shared them with all popped up sooner or later saying, "best cookies ever!"
I soaked the raisins, of course, and discovered that while this recipe makes a huge batch, you can put half the dough in a ziplock bag and bake them a day or two later, and the second batch is even better. (Some crazy baking powder/ baking soda reaction!). You won't go wrong with this recipe, but watch the bake time, turn the cookie sheet 180 degrees halfway through, and when the edges are slightly brown, they are done. Edit: soak the raising in rum to go to the next level!

This an awesome twist on the regular old oatmeal raisin cookie. It is a must have if you like cookies. I have made these forwork as a treat for employees in the breakroom and also for church and community bake sales. They never stick around very long in any of these instances. 

I make these as the recipe lists without any changes, they are perfect as is.

My husband loves Oatmeal Raisin cookies. I personally am not a fan, I don't care for Raisins. However, these cookies are so good, I will eat them even with the Raisins! 

They turned out perfect! Not to much oatmeal or Raisins. Perfect Mix!!!

We LOVE them!!!

Followed recipe except for the shortening didn't have any, the cookies came out prefect. I did let my raisins set in root beer for a few before adding, it's just always made a difference, whether I'm making carrot cake or cookies.

I like the moistness and chewing as of this cookie. However, the clove is too strong for me. Next time I will add less clove then the recipe calls for and add a little more vanilla. But other than that this it is a good recipe.

I have made these at least 10 times. I follow the recipe exactly. They always turn out perfect! Just a little crunch but still soft. You have to take them out before they look done and let them cool on the cookie sheet for AT LEAST 2 minutes.
Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

These cookies were soft and chewy even two days later (we had to exert some major self control for that to happen). I followed the recipe as is, just tossed in a few chocolate chips I had lying around and also soaked the raisins in hot water for ten minutes before adding them in. I wonder if that's part of what made the cookies so moist. About ten minutes was the perfect time for my cookies. I don't usually make great cookies, but these turned out wonderfully, I will definitely hang on to the recipe.

Great recipe. I only had non butter flavored shortening, and I added a half teaspoon of nutmeg to the other spices, along with about a half cup of chopped walnuts. They turned out perfectly spicy and chewy.  I'll definitely make these again!

It was yummy! 
As per others reviews I used all butter (no shortening) and omitted the cloves.
More raisins might be nice..you can never have too many raisins  in a cookie, says me.

Awesome recipe - thanks! Recipe alterations: I used only brown sugar and didn't increase amount, used all butter, added more raisins, and made larger cookies (about 1/4c of dough). Baked 10 minutes.

I halved the recipe and it came out crumbly for a reason I couldn't figure out. I had some difficulty in scooping individual cookies. The crumbs were outstanding, though. Next time, I will leave the quantity as-is. Thanks so much for sharing.

Very good recipe, always pull cookies  out of the oven before their done, they continue to bake on the sheet. I added coconut  oil instead of margarine. Next time I will add more cinnamon and add allspice, that should spice it up some more. very good recipe.

4 stars.  I liked these but, they had a "floury" taste, or something I just can't put my finger on.  I think I prefer the recipe on the Quaker Oats container.  But they were ok overall.  I think I would have liked them better with chocolate chips instead of raisins.  3/2/16 Update:  I was able to identify the flavor I didn't like...cloves.  However, these ended up tasting much better in the subsequent days to come.  I would make these again.

Amazing!! Both my husband and 2 yr old loved them!! Soooo good and super easy to make. I only used butter and I used a little bit more raisins. I also soaked the raisins for about 10 mins in hot water.

These are awesome!!! I don't really like raisins so I will leave them out but this last time I added a cup of white chocolate chips I just happened to have and WOW -- they were delicious!!! I'm usually not a big fan of white chocolate but it gave the cookies an additional sweetness (like the raisins would) but without adding a strong flavor. Try it!! I also use all butter and no shortening. I have noticed an issue with getting them to bake in the center so I've tried dropping the oven temperature to 300 and baking for 13-15 minutes instead. It seems to work and the cookies are not overdone. My husband LOVES these cookies so they are a keeper in our house!

So good!  I didn't have shortening so I added 3/4 butter instead do 1/2 and 1  1/4 c flour and 2 1/2c oatmeal. Baked until slightly golden.  Texture and taste where perfect.

Great base recipe.  I'm not a fan of butter shortening, it tastes off to me, so I did all butter and 1/4 tsp each of cloves, nutmeg and allspice (not a huge fan of cloves).  Just right for my family - thanks, Beth!

I love oatmeal cookies! This recipe is my favorite by far. I followed the directions exactly,  but read enough reviews  ahead of time to have figured out that these cookies would probably spread. I put on a few as a trial batch to determine how they would bake. Mine took a little longer than directed (13 minutes) AND I waited a minute or two to let them cool before I moved them to the cooling rack. I was able to make 3 dozen cookies to give as gifts dropping them by the tablespoon. I also made a second batch the next day keeping the dough in a sealed container in the fridge. This helped with the spreading as the cookies baked but not by a lot.

Mmmmm I just love these cookies!  I always make a double batch every year.  This is just the best oatmeal recipe that I have tried.  I bake these at 325 instead of 350, I add chopped walnuts because I love them, and I use Irish butter instead of traditional butter.  Try this recipe, everyone will be grateful that you did!

Great.    Moist and chewy.  I doubled the recipe for a large group during the Thanksgiving weekend and they were all eaten amid continuous praise.  It was hard to walk past the cookies without getting 1 or 2.

These were so so yummy and perfect for the holiday season!  I made them for a dinner that I was invited to and my hosts had them for dessert that night and then with coffee the next morning.  The recipe is very quick and easy.  I'm going to try this recipe with chocolate chips instead of raisins next.

By far the best oatmeal raisin cookie recipe we've tried, and my family's new favorite.  This even changed my "I hate oatmeal cookies" kid to a lover of them.  The author was right...they do make the kitchen smell wonderful as well.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

My husband wanted to smell something baking in the oven at the cabin, so I chose to make these cookies.  I didn't have any cloves so I substituted that with all spice.  I added about 1/8 of a cup of flour which helped then stay a higher cookie rather than flat.  The taste and smell are awesome.  I am not an inexperienced baker.  I bake almost everyday.  I did put the raisins in hot water to plump them up and probably added a few more than the recipe called for since we like a lot of raisins.  I did not use a mixer for these cookies which I usually do but my kitchen aid is at home not the cabin.  It was still easy enough to mix up.  I am not sure where the negative reviews come from.  I will be sure this recipe is my go to recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies.  Next time I may add some walnuts they would be even better in my opinion.  Try this recipe for yourself.  I will be making more for our Christmas cookie plates.

Sooo.... I loved these cookies. They were fantastic, but my husband HATED them. He didn't think they were sweet enough and thought they needed butter. The recipe did make a lot so in the last half of the batter I added in a couple more teaspoons of sugar and a teaspoon of butter.

YUM!  I didn't have brown sugar on hand, so I substituted 1/2 cup white sugar with about 1/4 cup of dark corn syrup.  The cookies turned out a little cake-like, but that's probably because of my lack of brown sugar. They tasted AMAZING!  I like a spicy cookie, so I doubled the cinnamon and also added 1/4 teaspoon each of nutmeg, allspice, cloves and about 1/8 teaspoon ginger.  Like others, I also used 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 butter/shortening.

I've found my new oatmeal raisin cookie recipe! Great recipe. I followed the ingredients as listed, just added chopped walnuts and they were soft, chewy, not to sweet, cinnamon and clover were not overpowering. I will definitely make these cookie again.

I added cinnamon and nutmeg as well; didn't have butter flavored shortening but regular shortening worked just fine.

Will definitely make this again - not as spicy as I thought they might be, but super tasty. Definitely would use 1 cup of butter instead of the shortening.

These were great! I followed the recipe as it is above and they turned out quite well, those who tried them complimented me on the spices used and these didn't last long!! I baked them on my insulated cookie sheets and they took a little longer than the recipe stated but that could be due to the type of cookie sheet used.

Delicious. Wow!!! After reading other reviews I decided to do all butter. Only change more like addition is I added chopped pecans since my husband likes the added texture. Would be curious to make these exactly as the recipe states to see the difference in the cookie.

I've been making this recipe for years, both the way it's written and with changes. My changes are purely personal taste: one of my children doesn't like raisins, so sometimes I drop them (is it possible to make oatmeal raisin cookies without raisins?). And my husband loves cinnamon, so I usually add a lot of cinnamon. A lot. Everyone asks me for the recipe, as if it's some family secret, and I'm always happy to refer them here. This is the BEST recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies, and absolutely a necessity for an expat American in Norway who misses real American food.

Easy to make, they look nice and are soft and chewy. But they are way too sweet and not at all spicy but rather bland and boring. I will not make these again.

THESE ARE THE BEST OATMEAL COOKIES EVER!!
After reading the reviews I decided to give this recipe a try. I noticed alot of views said that this recipe is the same one as the Quaker Oats recipe. I think although it is similar, I prefer this recipe over the Quaker Oats. This one has an additional 1/4 cup of butter and additional 1/4 cup brown sugar. My cookies came out delicious, the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. Ive tried the Quaker Oat recipe in the past and my cookies always come out cake like and puffy. This is my new oatmeal cookie recipe. Thanks for posting!!

These turned out really well. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I used all butter and used pumpkin spice instead of cloves. I also baked them on a silpat  Will definitely make these again and again.

It is the first recipe of oatmeal raisin cookies I made and I think they turned out great! I did not have brown sugar so I used dark brown packed sugar. I also added some dried cranberries. The raisins and cranberries I used were soaked  a few hours in cognac. I will try it again!!!

A great recipe that me and my daughter enjoyed making and they taste great even though we messed up a couple items. Extra egg cause we added extra 1/2 cup of sugar and didn't have cloves but still tastes great

My bf (65 y.o., just like me) absolutely adores these cookies.  He feels they're the best he's ever had.  I'm not crazy about raisins, he is,  so I put them in his and none in my share.  We were both blown away.  You won't regret making these babies.

I have never made oatmeal cookies before, these were my first attempt. They turned out incredible and everyone in my house agrees that they are the best any of us has had before! I made a few changes, but only out of necessity as I was lacking certain specific ingredients. 1st I had to use bread flour as that was all I had on hand. 2nd, I only had unflavored shortening, so I used that plus a quarter teaspoon lemon extract; it should be noted that I also still used the vanilla extract in the same proportion. The last change I had to make was that I used two packages of instant rolled oats in apple cinnamon, because I only had 2 1/4 cups of plain rolled oats left in the can. Every thing else was done the same, and baked perfectly in about 11 min. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I've been making this recipe for years. But, I guess I never reviewed it before. It's a favorite of my family's. It is NOT by any means the same recipe that is on the Quaker box. I've tried both, so I know this for a fact. But, all cookie recipes follow a basic pattern. So, some similarities are to be expected. Thanks, Beth!

This is one of the very first recipes I made from Allrecipes, and is still one of my favorites. I use all butter, no shortening. A friend at work made them with the shortening, and honestly we could not tell the difference.

Used only butter.
Added extra  1/2t cloves, 1/2t cinnamon,  1/4t nutmeg.
Soaked raisins in hot water for 10 minutes. Used the middle-sized scoop, baked for 12 minutes on the stones, then used the metal spatula so they didn't have to sit on the stones 2 minutes.
My go-to for oatmeal raisin cookies!

Wonderful texture and chewiness! Sadly I didn't have any cloves on hand so I subbed in all spice and added 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice as another reviewer suggested. Aside from that I followed to the letter and I think they turned out great! I made them for my boyfriend's birthday tomorrow though, so the real test is how he likes them. My roommates LOVED the ugly ones I gave them though, so fingers crossed he'll be stoked as well!

Great recipe with a few tweaks: I omitted the shortening and used only butter. I substituted the cloves for 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and to give a punch of flavour I added an extra tsp of cinnamon. I also soaked the raisins well to plump them up before using.

I loved the recipe. the only substitution i made was to use a combo of butter and unsweetened applesauce and also straight butter (no shortening) and they turned out perfect both times. For a crispy cookie, i used room temperature dough and flattened them a little. And for soft fluffy cookies, i chilled the dough for a hour and scooped them into balls and did not flatten them at all.
MOST IMPORTANT! the type of cookie sheet you use is critical. the best for any cookie is the insulated, flat polished aluminum sheets. T-fal makes the best one. do not use a non stick pan.

I made this recipe originally as a gift to send my 93 yo mother since she said her favorite cookie was oatmeal raisin. Well, she loved these and raved about them and frequently requested them. I still send her a batch and they are always a hit! We love them as well. These are the most wonderful oatmeal cookie. I took a tip from another reviewer and soak my raisins in boiling water for 10 mins and then flour them. The most recent time I used a mixture of regular and golden raisins and they were terrific. Truly a marvelous recipe. Thank you so much for sharing. These cookies have brought much joy to many!

it was a soft and chewy cookies with the side crunchy and centre being soft. although i used only white sugar in this recipe followed the instructed amount, I found it way too sweet for me. Will reduce the sugar the next time I make it. I have also replaced the shortening with butter and it turned out well.

Delicious!  But next time I will not add the cloves.  I used fresh cloves (therefore potent), and my cookies had a baking soda-type metallic after taste.  I believe it was the use of cloves and not the baking soda that caused it.

Loved these!! I did not have butter flavored shortening so I used plain, also I only had old fashioned oats on hand, but still the cookies turned out great! 10min was about perfect in my oven. I think it's important to remember that sometimes environment can impact your baking. There have been times I've followed a tried and true recipe to a T but it didn't turn out that particular time. I think the cinnamon and cloves are great in these cookies. Love the flavor and texture. Adding this recipe to my cookie arsenal. I've been hunting for a really great oatmeal raisin cookie recipe!

I used 1/2 cup of palm shortening (better for you) in place of the 1/2 cup of butter shortening. . These cookies are so good!! Will be making them again for sure!

I just made these because my husband wanted oatmeal raisin cookies. First words out of his mouth " these are the best you have ever made!  Save that recipe. Your searching is over!!  Thank you so much. Only change I made was to put in half a cup extra raisins. That was only because we are huge raisin fans!

Best homemade oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had. Besides using ONLY butter instead of the butter and shortening combo, I followed the recipe exactly. With my convection oven it only took 10 minutes to bake. Irrelevant- the cookies dough was so good that I considered not baking them; try it.

I made these again.  Still used all butter but used 2 cups of flour, 2 tsps. baking soda, kicked up the spices, 2 tsps. cinnamon, 1 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  They didn't spread out so bad and my 95 year old father volunteered his opinion. "Hey, these are good."  He never does that! Oh, and 9-10 minutes was long enough in the oven.

Also, this made my kitchen smell fantastic!

These where a big hit with the guys at my local coffee shop. I did use all butter and not shorting, and only backed them for 10 mins. They where very soft, almost to soft. Next time I may bake for 11 mins. A keeper for sure.  0(* @ *)0

The cookies came out wonderfully soft, and I LOVE the addition of cloves, though it seems as though there is too much sugar. I will use this recipe again, but perhaps cut the brown sugar in half.

I have tried these many times now and aside from one time, when I mistakenly doubled the butter, these have always turned out delicious. I follow some other reviews reduced the cook time to 9 minutes MAX.

Best oatmeal cookies evah! First batch i used sligtly less of the cloves because I wasn't sure how the kids would like the spice, next batch I will use full amount. Kids loved them and asked for more. Follow up: made them with full amount of cloves and the kids (5 and 3) loved them. Getting lots of requests for the recipe too.

The husband and I loved this recipe.  The cookies were soft, a little chewy (in a good way), and flavorful.  I wouldn't have called them "spicy" though.  I'd have doubled the spices before calling them spicy.

FANTASTIC recipe!  My first time ever making Oatmeal Raisin cookies and they came out great.  I even messed up the oats and put 1-minute oats in, instead of rolled.  And they still came out great!  Just as they were coming out of the oven i sprinkled just a hint more of the cloves & cinnamon to the tops for color.  Awesome.

This recipe is great by itself, though of course after making it a few times I felt the need to try some changes.  I do use all butter (but mainly because I always have it, while I don't always have shortening).  I also use pumpkin pie spice and extra cinnamon.  The BIGGEST change I have made though is that I use a mixture of golden raisins, cranberries, and dried cherries.  I used to HATE oatmeal raisin cookies until I discovered that if I soak my dried fruit in a mixture of egg, vanilla, and the spices for at least a day before using they are extra moist and juicy and completely change the texture.  I make the cookies this way and call them "oatmeal fruit and nut cookies".  AMAZING.

I like to use my muffin top pan to get a crispy bottom and edges and a thick chewy middle. The crisp  is only good right out of the oven but I  keep pre scooped  dough in the freezer so I can have them  the way I want them. Sub craisins or mix   craisins and raisins. When I want a chocolate fix I like to put semi sweet chips on top to melt after I take them out of the oven.

I will never use another oatmeal raisin recipe again! I personally found that 9 minutes was perfect for smaller cookies and 10 minutes was good for slightly larger cookies. Sometimes I increase the cinnamon and cloves, but these are delicious as written. They were a big hit with my husband and family! Thanks Beth!

I followed pretty much what everyone else said with the butter and cooking time.  instead of the spices suggested I used Trader Joes pumpkin pie spice.  it has cinnamon, ginger, lemon peel, nutmeg, cloves and cardamom in it...I just sprinkled a bunch in and next time will put in more some extra flavor.  I also added wheat germ, ground flax seed, cranberries, chia seeds and walnuts to make them even healthier.  They taste GREAT...Just ate 2 before dinner!!!  YUM

Im not a huge fan of oatmeal raisin cookies but I saw another recipe for cream filled oatmeal raisin sandwich cookies and wanted to try a "well rated" recipe for the cookie part of this recipe.
I used all butter, no shortning and and baked them for about 12+ minutes. They were soft and very yummy!They didnt fall apart but I cooled them on my cutting board, not a cooling rack.
Only downfall....the batter was sooo delicious. I ate at least 4 cookies of batter. :)

This is my new oatmeal cookie recipe! It's quick, and can be put into the oven right away. I scooped into balls and they only spread after baking slightly, so they were a very round, chewy cookie. 12 minutes was perfect for mine, and while still warm, they had an outer crispiness with chewy middles...however, even now after a week in ziplocks, they are still chewy and just as good! I used all butter, just because shortening is not available where I live, and I added some nutmeg because I love it.

These are the best I've ever tried!  I made these exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  The butter/shortening mixture makes the cookies just right - not too soft and not crunchy.  I was hesitant to add the cloves because of their strong flavor but it blends in very nicely.  It doesn't dominate as I thought it might.  Just the right balance of spice.  Nicely done Beth! (BTW, other reviewers criticized this for being the same as the Quaker recipe.  It's close but it's not the same.  Beth has added cloves and substituted 1/2 the butter for shortening.  I think these changes are what makes it)

Excellent cookie, chewy and spicy not too sweet, my changes included using Crasins soaked in hot water and drained instead of raisins, 1/2 c sunflower seeds and using all butter instead of the shortening.

This is a pretty darn good cookie.  I left out some of the cloves, since I know cloves can be pretty overpowering.  I also added some nutmeg.  Instead of raisins, I added pecans.  Good stuff!

Pretty good.  Cookie falls apart and doesn't stay put.  I like the soft oatmeal cookie recipe better.  I did add more cinnamon and cut back on the sugar though.

I have NEVER reviewed a recipe, though I use this site regularly.  These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have made - and I have tested MANY recipes.  They are not only delicious, but they also make a beautiful presentation (they are not flat, thank goodness).  Thank you Beth.....my quest for the best oatmeal raisin cookie is over -- I've found it.  Got any more recipes?????  I'm a fan!!!!!

The cookies turned out awesome! They tasted fantastic the only thing I changed was that I used All Spice instead of cloves and regular crisco since I did not have the butter flavored. Oh, and I also added chocolate chips to half of them and they tasted great too. Will be making these again!

I rate this a 4 when made according to recipe. When made with a few changes it is easily worthy of a five star rating. I made these with only butter, doubled the vanilla, doubled the cinnamon, cut the cloves in half, added a dash of nutmeg, dash of ginger, and MOST IMPORTANTLY I soaked my raisins in Sugar water to rehydrate them. Then I formed balls a little bigger than walnuts and cooked for about 11 minutes. After doing these things I found that the cookies were the best I have had in a long time. Only thing I will do differently next time is to add another 1/4 cup of raisins. 1 cup just isn't enough for this recipe.

Wonderful recipe!  Oatmeal cookies can be tricky to keep chewy. Underbaked at only 9 minutes and they are still soft after cooling. I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and doubled the vanilla (because that is what my Mother always tells me to do). My husband loves them so they won't last long.

Twelve years of marriage. Twelve years of whining about oatmeal cookies. Until I tried this recipe! My husband finally has a favorite. I use all butter instead of half shortening, and all brown sugar in place of part white. We substitute butterscotch chips for the raisins too. Be sure to use softened butter, not melted (which makes the cookies not cook right), and light not dark brown sugar (which makes them burn).

Used all butter since I didn't have butter flavored shortening. Also added about 3/4 cup walnuts. My fiance, who is crazy for oatmeal raisin cookies, raved about this recipe. (And ate 6 of them when they came out of the oven.) Great recipe!!

These cookies were inhaled within a day! I threw the ingredients in my ninja (ordered it from tv & hardly use it, so thought i would for this). I kept them in for 10 mins & cooled for 2 mins on sheet & 10 on rack. 
Next time will keep in for 11 mins just for color. I also pressed them down just a tiny bit before baking.

Wow!  Just wow!  Awesome cookies. They have created a cult following in my circle.  I'm no longer allowed to attend my regular Sunday meeting without these cookies.  One little tweak; I soak the raisins in warm water for 15-20 minutes because I prefer them plump and soft.  No ogher changes required.  This one is a winner!

The best tasting oatmeal cookies ever, and I am not a fat of oatmeal.  The cinnamon provides just a hint of wonderfulness that makes a big difference. Not too sweet either. Yum.  I also used all butter because I don't buy shortening. 

Just another note on baking:  I found even 9 minutes to be a bit on the long side and settled with 8.5.

An okay recipe but could be spicier. Nice texture, soft rather than crispy. I would add more spices and perhaps nuts next time. Also, I used less sugar than stated but some people  found it still too sweet.

Yum! Best oatmeal cookies I've ever made! I needed a recipe to use up golden shortening I'd bought by mistake, and these cookies are so good I would even buy golden shortening again! 11 minutes baking made for perfectly soft and chewy cookies.

These were great and chewy, I always refridgerate my cookie batter for a few minutes prior to baking. They seems to alway be "fluffy" when i do this. I used cranberries instead of raisins. I loved the spices but my husband said they were a little too spicy for him. Cut down on the cloves just and tad.

Delish!  I made this for a Christmas cookie exchange party.  But I did make changes as others suggested.  1. Increased butter to 1 c and did not use shortening. 2. Decreased cinnamon to 1/2 t. 3. Added 1/2 t nutmeg 4. Added 1/4 t ground ginger 5. I let my yellow raisins soak in hot water to plump up for 10 minutes. I would make this recipe again.

LOVE - LOVE - LOVE these cookies.  I have now made 5 times.  Rave reviews.  I add 1/4 cup flax seed, 1/4 cup protein powder.  Still comes out chewy.  Feel a little guilty that something this good is healthy!

I have made these cookies more times than I can count and not only have they become my absolute favorite, but I always get RAVE reviews. They are the perfect mix of salty and sweet. When I make a batch I have to take some to the neighbors otherwise I'd sit and eat them all! I have started substituting the white sugar for raw sugar and there's no difference in the flavor or texture. I have also made the recipe with all butter rather than shortening and again, no noticeable difference. The BEST cookie!

I followed the recipe but made a few changes as others did.  I omitted the oil and 1/2 the amount of the butter and used cinnamon applesauce instead.  I also added more cinnamon, some nutmeg and some ginger.  I also added pecan pieces and walnut pieces and these turned out to be the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever tasted.  Thanks for the recipe.

Like everyone, I omit and change certain things from the recipes here but try to rate the recipe as it stands.  I am giving 3 stars.  I omitted the cloves because..well.. they're yucky.  I used "quick oats" and I have no idea if that  affected the outcome or what, but after cooling they were very dry.  I also halved the recipe but thinking maybe I should have added some extra butter or egg or something maybe it wouldn't have turned out that way.  They weren't the worst, but they were just ok.

I made these cookies exactly as indicated. Although they are delicious, they are just too soft to hold together. I let them rest on the baking sheets until they were entirely cold after reading many of the reviews with the same comment. They still fell apart when picked up to eat. Even doubling the baking time to the point they were very dark only helped a tiny bit. I am wondering if increasing the flour would help.

This is an excellent recipe. I made some mistakes though. I may have added too much clove; it was strong and if you don't want that taste try add a little less than a teaspoon. Also, to lessen calories and fat, it would taste great with half the butter. Ten minutes  bake time was perfect they were soft and chewy with a little crunch on the edges. Overall they were great for a first time. AND if you go according to recipe, they make a lot of cookies so I froze two bags of the cookie mixture for a another day. Great recipe....Thanks so much Beth!

Oh my goodness!! This cookies are heaven! My husband who "doesn't like oatmeal raisen cookies" polished them over night... the whole batch. He asked me the next morning why i didnt triple the recipe! Anyway, I cooked these just until they were done so they were soft on the inside and just crisp on the outside. They bake pretty flat and crisp quickly. I did make some changes and took notes from others. I added 1 tablespoon+ of vanilla. I didn't use the cloves because we dont like the flavor and i didnt have any. I used extra cinnamon instead. They also freeze well. (just made my second batch-2 days later) Enjoy!

I don't use shortening or butter but hard margarine, all results turn out great!!  I totally messed up at the beginnning by adding 4 eggs, so I had to double the recipe, but cut back on the sugars 1/4 cup each.  Which turned out great as I made one batch w choc chips and the other w raisins.  Also used all whole wheat flour, but only 2 1/2 cups and only used 4 1/2 cups of oats.  I found the cooking time to be off as well.  9 mins wasn't long enough, so in the end it was about 11-12 mins (maybe because of the wh wheat flour??).  Whatever it was, they turned out amazing!!  My kids will never know how healthy they really are!!  lol

My daughter volunteers me ;) to make these cookies for all her chorus/drama club and school events-her friends beg her to do so!
My only wish is for more nutritional information (how many cookies per serving).

Good cookies.  I wasn't crazy about the cloves though.  Just a personal preference.

Great taste, but they would fall apart as you ate them....have to make a slight modification next time to keep them together, but there will be a next time!

I followed the recipe exactly how listed. My cookies turned out FLAT. The taste was nothing exceptional. Kinda disappointed since I spent the money and time making these and they turned out horrible.

easy recipe to follow, fun for kids to help with and learn how to bake. Another good point is you can experiment with this recipe by adding things like chocolate chips or nuts. No matter what the cookies taste great.

Delicious cookies!  I opted to leave the cloves out.  I also used Tablespoons instead of Teaspoons when placing on the cookie sheet.  I found that baking for 10 minutes yield the perfect chewy consistency.  Next time I am going to try adding some ground ginger!

The oatmeal cookies are delicious!  I used 1 cup butter, only   chopped walnuts were increased to 2 cups.  

Added 1 cup yellow raisins.  Poured 1 cup hot water over raisins.  Steeped for 10 minutes.  Drained.  Dredged in 1 tablespoon flour.

These oatmeal cookies are Rock Stars!

I thought these were really good. I followed other reviewers' advice and only baked for 9 min.

I did make some substitutions:

- used 1 cup margarine
- used 1 cup flour + 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
- used Epicure Selections Chinese 5 Spice in place of cloves
- used half of the two sugars it called for

Still made a moist, delicious and not too sweet cookie at 104 calories a piece!

my college daughter asked me to make her some oatmel raisin cookie dough and bring it to her as I was going to visit. My other daugter found this recipe so I mixed it up for her. When she baked them up and shared them with her friends, they said they were the best oatmeal cookies they EVER had. I agree with them!

My father doesn't usually have a sweet tooth or like cakes and such. So I made these cookies for his birthday. I added walnuts as they are a favorite of his. The cookies were amazing. My father liked them so much he kept bribing me to make more. Great recipe!

chewy every time! I use whole wheat flour and brown sugar instead of white and occasionally substitute 1/4 c bran and/or 1/4 cup garbanzo flour for extra fiber. Sometimes replace 1/2 c raisins with chocolate chips or walnuts, depending on what I have handy. They always turn great! Love this recipe:)

I only made 1/2 a batch because my husband and I are on a 6 week RV trip and didnt want to end up eating sll of them... This recipe is AMAZING.. I did however use all Smart Balance for the butter, evaporated cane sugar and organic brown sugar. I also added 1/4c coconut 1/4c organic chocolate chips and 1/2c chopped walnuts.. I did'nt have clove so I doubled the cinnamon... They turned out AMAZING

I love these cookies!! I made them exactly as the recipe states. There's so many ideas for making variations to this recipe but I wouldn't know what changes made sense until I made them as written first - I personally don't see any need to make any changes to this recipe - we all love them!!

Delicious.  I only had regular shortening, so that is what I used.  Plumped the raisins, but otherwise made it exactly the same.  Very yummy.  My husband tried one and then said he was going to eat as many as I would let him.  :-)  Thanks!!

This is the best recipe I have ever found. I used all butter (no shortening)and only baked them for 9 minutes like the other reviewers had suggested, other than that I followed the recipe. My husband was thrilled with them. Soft, thin chewy cookies. The best.

WOwooow! YUMMYYY! This recipe for me made around 30 cookies and they were all gone by the end of the night! I used all butter and quick cooking oats, I also made a brown sugar icing and drizzled this on some of the batch and it was a nice touch to them. I definitely will be making this again!!!! THANKS BETH!!!!

Yummy!! I replaced the cinnamon and cloves with 1 1/2 tsp mixed spice because I didn't have cloves. Would love to know if you use quick oats or old fashioned oats?

I just made these for my husband. I had one and thought they were very good, what he says though is what matters lol. Instead of using 1/2 cup of butter and a 1/2cup of flavoured shortening I used one cup of margarine. I do not like using butter in baking, I usually use nothing but Blue Bonnett margarine it adds a very subtle taste, but it's what differentiates my baking from others. All in all though these were very good.

These cookies turned out awesome! I made a couple slight changes.....I didn't have butter flavored shortening but used the regular stuff and I realized too late that I only had about 2 cups of oats, so I threw in a couple packages of apple cinnamon instant oatmeal and it took these cookies to a whole new level!

Not to my taste.  I made half a batch.  The spices were overpoweringly strong.  Could still taste it in the air the next day.  Neither of my toddlers liked it much either.  They were soft and chewy though.

I followed the recipe to the "T" and must admit I was a bit skeptical about adding cloves to the recipe but to my surprise the flavor was AWESOME!!

They came out chewy and delicious. It's best to take the cookies out of the baking sheet when they're fresh out of the oven, I used a non stick cookie sheet.

Cookies didn't last too long in my household LOL!
Will definitely use this recipe again

These were absolutely wonderful!!!!  I did not have cloves, but made up for it with cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.  I used half butter and half homemade lard instead of butter flavored shortening.  I experimented with the time.  9 minutes were to soft to hold shape until totally cooled, but 10 minutes were perfect in color, texture and taste.  I cooked half and froze half the dough for later.

Good cookie - I used all butter and a bit of nutmeg instead of cloves. These have great flavor but mine didn't spread. I will definately make again.

If you REALLY want to make these fabulous cookies unforgettable, then roll them in cinnamon sugar before baking. A great mix is 1/2 c. raw sugar, 1/2 c. cane sugar and 3 T. saigon cinnamon. Roll them thourougly in the mixture, roll in the palms of your hands, then roll them a 2nd time, flatten each cookie between your hands & dip top of each cookie one more time! This will make these wonders jump right over the moon!

Oh my word!! These are the best cookies I have ever made. 
I omitted the shortening and just used all butter. Did not have ground cloves so used a half of teaspoon of all spice.
Added in 1/4 cup extra of flour for HIGH ALTITUDE.. 
I have never had such tasty cookies that looked beautiful as well. 
This is a keeper

These cookies were just ok for me.  I followed the recipe as is with no modifications.   I really liked the spiciness the cloves gave it but the cookies came out really thin and flat.  I usually like a heartier cookies, so was a little disappointed with that.  The flavor was great, but the texture was just so-so.

AB-SO-LUTE-LY THE BEST OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIES I HAVE EVER MADE! I bake all the time and have tried a numerous amount of oatmeal raisin cookie recipes and never came across one that was this stinkin good! I did make two changes..I didn't have any cloves so I did a big sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice. (approx. 1/2 tsp), and also didn't have the butter flavored shortening so I just used regular crisco shortening and they turned out fine! Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe with everyone Beth! It's def a keeper & I WILL BE MAKING THESE AGAIN! :)

So good! I try to avoid baking with shortening so I used all butter and they came out great! My 10 yr old son said he doesn't like oatmeal cookies and loved these. I left out the raisins. So much tastier than a regular oatmeal cookie but than again I love spices :)

Great cookies.  I didn't use cloves because I don't like cloves.  Instead, added add'l teaspoon of cinnamon.  Also, used only butter.  I did soak my raisins in warm water as advised in other reviews. I did use Splenda white sugar and brown sugar substitute.  I cooked 1st batch a little crispy and the 2nd a little on the soft side.  Preferred the softer cookies.  Will absolutely make again.

I changed with this recipe a little to feel less guilty about eating my facorite cookies. I scaled it down to 24 servings and used 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour + 1/4 cup of soy flour. Also used all butter and egg beaters. They were a bit drier than I would have liked, but I blame the flour change for that.  Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar a bit and maybe use more egg beaters for moisture. The flavor was great with the spices (I added a sprinkle of ginger and a little more cinnamon), and I will certainly will try it again. Thanks for sharing!

I love to bake and cookies are my favorite, but this is the first time I'd made oatmeal cookies in a few years! I kept the recipe exactly as stated except for omitting the raisins. They baked in about 11 minutes. Yum.

This is an excellent cookie.  For those who may not agree, you might be looking at a different box - mine is the old fashioned cooking oats.  Either way - these are great. NOTE:  you will have more flavorful raisins if you do this:  place the cup of raisins in a small bowl, fill with water and microwave until the water just comes to boiling.  Drain the raisins in a mesh colander and you will immediately smell the wonderful flavor that has been released and even a hint of vanilla.  I did not change any of the ingredients or quantities, however,  I did play with the size of the cookie because I have boys and they want something more than a small bite.  I used a 1/8 cup measure leveled for each cookie, and baked for  12 minutes (6 on the bottom rack and 6 on the middle rack).  If you use a silicon mat which I HIGHLY suggest, the cookies will never stick and you can let them cool on the rack completely if you want.  I left mine for 6 minutes because of the cook time.

Absolutely delicious. I didn't change a thing for ingredients. I did however have to bake them for about 14 minutes. That is a personal preference though, I think. I don't like mushy cookies!

Made this exactly to recipe, and it got rave reviews at work the next day.  I believe they taste better the day after baking than they do right out of the oven.

A really good oatmeal cookie. I left the raisins out because I don't like them. A bit crunchy around the edges and soft and chewy in the middle. Very good.

These are awesome!!! Have made twice already and they always disappear quickly. Only changes I made to the original recipe are adding 1 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. ginger (I like spice). Scooped these onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Used a large ice cream scoop. Flattened the dough with the bottom of a glass (to bake evenly). They were perfect after 12 min. @ 350. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

The best! I followed the advice of a friend and used all butter-flavored shortening instead of half butter. Because I used 100% whole wheat, I added about 2 TBS almond milk to the recipe. Turned out faaabulous! They stayed chewy. I agree with others that one can increase the spices, but there's something to be said for subtlety, as well. Great recipe!!

These cookies are quite good.  I followed other people's advice and used all butter instead of shortening. I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light to save calories and they still tasted great. I also used Splenda Brown Sugar Mix and Splenda regular sugar mix (not pure splenda) and it was good. I would add more spices next time...definitely more cinnamon.  Other than that, delicious! I took them out at 9 minutes and they were perfect.

The family loved these cookies! Since I never use shortening, I used 1 cup of butter. I also added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon ginger. I used golden raisins and soaked them in water before adding to the dough. Since I like soft cookies, I baked them for 10 minutes. I took them out of the oven when slightly brown around the edges, but they didn't really look done in the middle.

These were great!  I accidentally used quick oats instead of rolled but they still tasted delicious!  I didn't have any shortening on hand either so I used all butter.

I love this cookie's taste. But I still feel that something missing from its smell. May be because I skip filling clove because I do no have any. Anyway, everything comes out perfect.

I have used this recipe many times and they always come out perfect whether made as written or modified. I often substitute chocolate chips or dried cranberries for the raisins and play with the spices. I always use all butter and increase the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp. Tonight I used 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the separate cinnamon and cloves and they are one of the best, if not the best, batches I have made. Yum!

FAB COOKIES.  I made these today with the help of my "picky" 8 year old son.  We set up a lemonade and cookie stand in the front yard and these cookies were a hit.    I did not have the butter flavored shortening, so I used regular shortening.  I also soaked my raisins for 30 minutes (then drained) before adding them to the recipe.   Definately a keeper in our book.

Replaced the shortening with butter and still came out great. Could use more of the spices. 9-10 mins is plenty of baking time, although they come out pretty delicate and tend to stick together.

Made this recipe yesterday and they are very tasty. Now I have 2 large cookie jars of oat and raisin cookies for dipping into from time to time yums.  I made 2 alterations- I used all butter and also reduced the amount of white sugar to 1/4 cup. I don't think I'd change anything else.

Exact same measurements as recipe on oatmeal lid except substitute 1/2 butter crisco and add 1/2 tsp cloves. I couldn't tell the difference with the substitutions.

Really good cookies! Next time I will take the oatmeal for a little spin in the food processor, because the oats were a little too pronounced, but soaking the raisins (I used 1/2 C raisins and 1/2 C Craisins) really makes a difference. I gave some to a baker that lives behind me and he gave me a sincere, enthusiastic thumbs up!

I cut the recipe in half and made 1/2 with Splenda and the other half as per the original recipe.    For the Splenda version I added 1 tbl molasses and doubled the cinnamon to compensate for flavor.   Baked on parchment paper for 10 minutes.   Overall it was a good sugar-free cookie, but needed more modification.  It was pretty crumbly so I'm guessing it needs a little less oats and a little less flour.  Could have used a touch more butter and more cinnamon.  The lack of sugar and brown sugar always leaves things a little bland.  But not bad, so I would definitely make again with those modifications to see if I could reduce the crumble factor.   If trying with Splenda, also be sure to flatten the cookies out manually.  With Splenda, cookies don't "spread" when baking so you have to form the cookies prior to baking.  For the sugar-y version, it was very good.  I added a little nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon.  At the suggestion of other reviewers I cut the cloves in half.   Baked for 11 minutes on parchment paper.  They flatten out while cooking so you don't need to do this manually.  For both versions (sugar and Splenda) I put the dough in the freezer for about 10 minutes and it helped keep the dough from sticking.   Overall a good recipe, but not "the best cookies I've ever had" as other reviewers have touted.   I would make again if my family requested.

Cookies looked good and had great texture.  I found that the cloves ruined the flavor though.  I added much less than called for but we all found it to be over powering.  Easy recipe that I will make again without the cloves.

Too crumbly. I made as directed and they fell apart. They were thin. I tried cooking them longer but they were rock hard and crumbly. I cooked them shorter and they fell apart. I won't try this again.

So delicious! I've made these several times now and one time I got them perfect, huge, and soft (see the photo with my hand in front of them to show size). A couple of times they have come out less soft and more balled up. I haven't figured it out yet, but I don't mind practicing with this recipe!

as a single dad of 4 girls I don't get a lot of time for baking, so I was pleased that these came out so well. my girls and their neighborhood friends enjoyed them very much.  i am inclined to make a modification to the recipe on the next time i make these, however. given that shortening has a shelf life of a staggering 80 years, my next batch will include butter exclusively. -the latter being the less of two evils.

I absolutely love these cookies! The first time I made them I made another batch the following day!!  I added some Allspice into the mix too.  I found that if I cooled the batter before baking them they didn't melt as much and retained their form better.  XD

WOW!! These are awesome! I followed the recipe no changes needed to be made. I baked them for 10 minutes and they came out perfect and very fluffy. The ground clove is what makes these cookies great. I will make these again for sure.

Amazingly perfect!  I used a little less cloves since I didn't want a really spicy cookie, and it was still delicious.

I used 1 cup butter.  But using Crisco would've made them chewy.  I will do that next time.  I added 1/2 t each of vanilla & almond extract.  And added a dash of nutmeg, allspice, & ground ginger.  Just used 2 cups of oats & added dark chocolate chips instead of raisins.  And I threw it in a 8x8 square dish.  Good breakfast!!

I tried this recipe for my friends and everyone loved it. The only change I made was that I substituted margarine for both the butter and shortening. The cookies were quite delicious but a little too soft so next time I'll reduce the butter slightly or bake for a few extra minutes. Great oatmeal raisin recipe. This one is a keeper.

Outstanding oatmeal cookie. This is not a traditional thick heavy oatmeal cookie.  The batter is light and it is better to make these cookies no more than teaspoon sized as recommended.  They do burn easily but be sure to cook them through otherwise they just fall apart.  Golden brown is a good description.  Do not overdo the cloves or cinnamon, the amounts are good as this is a very light cookie.  Always gets rave reviews.

These are great cookies with Whole Wheat flour... but even better made with Spelt Flour!  Let them cool on the parchment paper or they will crumble and fall apart!

Turned out rather soggy and all of the cookies melted into one big cookie sheet. I'd try less butter next time or more flour.

I really liked these cookies. I added a bit more spices than it says on the recipe and made the cookies bigger. They stayed really soft and chewy for days and taste very festive and cosy. I'll definitely be making these again.

I cut the sugar way back in this recipe as I read some reviews saying it was too sweet, I used about 3/4 cup brown sugar(all I had left) and just under 1/2 cup white. I also added nutmeg, allspice and just a touch of ginger. Also my husband hates rasins so I left them out, And they turned out so good. I did change quite a bit which is why ive given 4 stars instead of 5. But it was a great base! Will use it again.

Yum, yum!! I doubled this recipe, because I just knew it would be good. One of the things I did was to mix all the dry ingredients, plus the oats & raisins in a large bowl, and mixed them up with my hands. This way I knew I mixed up. Thanks Beth!

These are exceptional.  Spicy oatmeal is a great description.  Like a mix between a spice cookie recipe and oatmeal raisin.  Awesome.  I did see someone's review who had added 1 1/3 c of dried milk to the mix and I did add this for some added calcium.  Excellent still.

I LOVE these cookies!!  I made them with mini-chocolate chips instead of raisins just because we don't like raisins at my house...but OMG are they the BEST!!  The cloves just add such wonderful flavor.  I can't stop eating them!  Thanks!!

Great oatmeal cookie with the perfect amount of spice!  The only comment I want to make is about the quantity. The batch I made, made 45 scoop #40 cookies (about 2 1/2 inch diameter).

Very important to leave on cookie sheet about 2 whole minutes before placing them on a cooling rack.  Will fall through the rack if you don't.  I prefer a thicker cookie myself.   These do taste good.  I made them exactly as the recipe states.   Unsure if I will try them again.

I made these exactly as the recipe states, but added 1/4 teaspoon all spice. They came out nice and chewy as described. These are yummy cookies and a variation from the usual oatmeal cookies because of the spices especially the cloves.

Well, the over the top amount of butter called for just seemed too much for me.  I mean, I don't want to see a puddle of butter on the top of my cookies when I take them out of the oven.  The flavor was pretty good, but I have had better.

BEST oatmeal cookie recipe ever! These are so addicting usually when I make them they are gone by the end of the night! I do not use the shortening or raisins, and they still are delicious!!! I also use whole wheat flour, and it gives them extra flavor-and more healthy!! I have also added about 1/4 c. peanut butter to the sugar mix and it makes them even more delicious!!!

Oatmeal raisin cookies are on of my favorites and have been searching for years for the perfect recipe.  I had about given up until I tried this recipe.  This quite possibly could be the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had!  I was worried the spices would make it too Christmasy....but not at all, just the perfect amount to give it something special!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

Very good recipe. Very much like a christmas cookie.  It could have used more raisens, not all of the cookies had some. Chocolate chips would have tasted great too, totally worked with out them though.

Soooo GOOD! So chewy and soft! I did make a glaze for them. A butter and powder sugar glaze which put the cookie over the top! I will never use another oatmeal cookie recipe ever again!

I followed the recipe to the letter and my cookies certainly don't look like the picture.  They are flat (too much butter & shortening) taste is good, crunchy& soft at the same time (good), texture is oily and crumble very easily.  Not my favorite cookie.......

These are great tasting oatmeal cookies. I really fudged them up - like another reviewer, I ended up with a big mess that turned into a pile of oatmeal cookie pieces. My guests gobbled them up despite the fact that they were definitely NOT cookies!! I don't know what I did wrong, but I will certainly try again as the flavor was so tasty, I could have just eaten the batter.

Not anything great, tasted like oatmeal cookies.  Mine came out really thin and the cookies fell apart after I put them in a container.  I used regular shortening and added about 1/8 teaspoon of ground ginger.  Maybe next time I will use all shortening so the cookies hold their shape better.  Also I soaked the raisins in hot water for about 10 minutes.

Super yummy cookie!  My husband love oatmeal raisin cookies.  We made these for some new neighbors that had just moved in and I ended up having to make a second batch because the family ate them before we could take them to the neighbor.  This was the exact right amount of spice and oatmeal flavor and not too sweet.

LOVE these!  No cloves on hand, so omitted these.  Used whole spelt flour instead of all-purpose, Sucanat instead of white and brown sugars, soaked my raisins, and OH MY!!!  LOVE these!!!  BF and I ate 3 while they were still warm!  I made 22 large cookies instead of 36 as recipe said, and baked them for 10 minutes.   As you slide them off the cookie sheet unto cooking rack, they look quite smooshy and foldy, but they cool nicely and chewily :)

The 4 stars may not be an accurate review.  I halved the recipe and used an egg replacer (son is allergic to eggs) and only had quick oats on hand.  I don't know if it's because of one or both but when the cookies came out of the oven, it didn't look quite cooked -- it didn't hold and was crumbling.  So I left it in longer and even left them on the cookie sheet.  When they completely cooled, they're actually not that bad -- cooked and crispy.  I just wanted to add this review in case someone out there is thinking of using substitutes and just know that mine did not turn out fantastically (albeit they're still edible).

By far THE VERY BEST cookies!  Made a double batch with Craisins and extra spices...wonderful.  This is a great recipe to add or change things to your own preference.  I've made several types of cookies based on this recipe...even the original is great!  Thank you so much for this recipe, it is an absolute favorite in our house.  The one and only tweak from the original recipe is I only use butter, no shortening.  YUMMY and they make my house smell devine!  Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe was so easy that our 10 year old daughter made it twice all by herself. She took one batch to school and there were no leftovers. The outside is crispy and the inside stayed chewy even the next day, when they were all devoured. Thanks Beth!

These were okay - I have to say that I haven't made oatmeal raisin cookies in a while, but I think if I were to make these again, I would increase the amount of raisins by at least 1/2 a cup (just personal preference).  The cookies didn't seem to spread and bake and instead really just sort of baked in the shape that I scooped them in.  The dough tasted nice though.  :-)

I've been making these for 7-8 years now.  Oatmeal Rasin is my all-time fave cookie and this is my "go to" recipe!  As other reviewers have suggested, I use all butter as well.

I use straight butter as I don't have "butter flavoured shortening" in the house, and sub chocolate chips for raisins out of preference. These are our favourite cookies!

What awesome cookies!  I've been trying to find a really good oatmeal cookie recipe for a while, and this one is it!  I used all butter - and I omitted the raisens (only because I didn't have any in the pantry) but these would be great with raisens, or nuts or chocolate chips!  Once thing I researched about baking cookies, is to use cool cookie sheets and to keep the batter cold.  The cookies will be fluffier instead of flattening out during baking.  This cookies rock!

YUM!  I actually made these gluten free by substituting sweet white rice flour for the all-purpose flour, and also added a 1/2 tsp of xanthan gum.  Delicious!

Delicious! Only change I made was to add a couple pinches of ginger for a little kick and 1 cup of chocolate chips because a little chocolate makes everything better ;-)  But they would still be great without my additions.

Wow.  Fantastic!  Added 1 1/2 cups of chopped walnuts as well.  Made just a little over 3 dozen cookies.  They were gone not even 12 hours later (I shared them with friends and they all loved them.  "No, I'll only have one...okay, maybe two....  Can I have just ONE more?"  Too funny.)  Great recipe.  But I only got two cookies myself before they were gone darnit!

These cookies are a hit with my husband!  We always store the cookies in an airtight container with a small slice of bread to keep them moist for days (if they last that long).

Excellent! I also replaced the shortening with real butter, and I added nutmeg, dried orange peel, ginger, allspice and extra cinnamon. Baking time was best around 8-10 minutes for especially moist cookies.

These were pretty good. Ill make them again, but next time I will use all real butter, and skip out on the Butter flavoured shortening. It ruined the flavour of the cookies, giving them a subtle fake butter taste (kind of like popcorn jellybellys), which Im not a fan of.

The most perfect Oatmeal Raisin cookie recipe. A bit crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. The spice of the cloves gives it a nice flavor. Followed the recipe exact but did add 1/2 tsp more cinnamon. Will try it next time with some chocolate chips!!

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe ever!  These are the standard cookies we prepare for the events at our winery.  I bake several dozen extra and they are always gone by the end of the event.  I use regular shortening not butter flavored.  Instead of raisins I use dried cranberries.

These were good. I wouldn't necessarily categorize these at "oatmeal" cookies, however. They were chocolate chip cookies with a dash of oats.  Nonetheless, their shape held up beautifully. I used milk and dark chocolate. yum!

I used all butter and no shortening. And late in the cookie baking game I discovered my raisins were dried out so I ended up using Craisins and throwing in a half a bag of white chocolate chips that I had in the cupboard. DELISH!  People at work are asking for the recipe.

This recipe was so good! The only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars because as this recipe is, it is just the quaker oatmeal cookies with cloves added. It is still really good. I use dark brown sugar, not light and it gives a more desirable flavor to me. Tastes richer. I also add chocolate chip cookies for a little extra to it. Everyone loved them andsaid they "taste like Christmas"

I made these cookies, and they are so delicious! I can't imagine how much better they would taste if I had everything on hand! I substituted margarine for butter and substituted butter flavored shortening for regular all-vegetable shortening and I omitted the ground cloves. I added chopped pecan and walnut pieces and mini chocolate chips. Very Delicious! Cant wait to try them when I add real butter!

These were so disappointing!  The only thing I changed about the recipe was I used regular shortening instead of butter flavored and I used splenda instead of real sugar.  The texture was awful, which i'm pretty sure would not be affected by the changes I made.  I put them on the cookie sheet in little rolled balls and their shape didn't change at all after they were done cooking.  They were extremely dry and crumbly. If I could give them no stars, I would.

absolutely delicious, almost perfect! decreasing the cloves and increasing the other spices does improve the cookies, though.

Instead of the shortening, I used 2/3 cup of butter and found that the cookie as it was too buttery and greasy with the full cup. It was also a little too sweet for my liking. I ended up using the full cup of brown sugar but cutting the white sugar down to 1/4 cup. Other than that, the consistency of the cookie was very nice and the taste was also pleasant. I would have added a little more cinnamon though, just because I like it to have a little more of a kick. The cookies stay moist for a at least a week.

Best cookies ever! I added chocolate chips and used all butter because I didn't have shortening and they are still fantastic! I will definitely use this recipe again.

The perfect cookie! Crisp on the outside and awesomely soft and chewy on the inside! My kids don't like raisins in cookies so we substituted butterscotch chips, which were terrific with the oatmeal. I, too, left out the cloves (too strong of a taste for us) and sub'd fresh grated nutmeg in its place. YUM! Will definitely be my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe from now on!

YUM!  Delicious!  They smell so good and taste wonderful!  I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and threw in some white chocolate chips (couldn't resist, they go so well with the dried cranberries!).  My girls loved them and my nephew did too!  Hubby will try them when he gets home.

This is a great recipe. I don't give a hoot if its on the Quaker Oats Box. I changed the raisins to craisins and added chocolate chips. I only baked 12 cookies and will freeze the rest of the dough.   Crunchy delish goodness. I will keep this recipe and use it again and again. My kids ages: 4, 2 and 1 loved these cookies!  YUMMY.

Mmm, wonderful.  I used all butter, and since I only had dark brown sugar, adjusted the white to brown ratio to 1:1. I want to try adjusting this to a cranberry white chocolate recipe sometime as well! There were some heretics in my group who refused to touch them because they had raisins in them.

These are great!  While I love raisins, I substituted chocolate chips.  I'm sure they're delish either way.  I may add more vanilla next time to cut the sweetness just a tad more.  Otherwise, recipe is definitely a 10!

I read another reviewer's comment that this is EXACTLY the recipe on the inside of the oatmeal canister plus the ground cloves, I checked the canister - and that statement is correct, a bit disappointing to think someone would claim this recipe as their own. Other than that this recipe is very yummy - slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I did cheat and used craisins instead of raisins and just had to add some chocolate chips... yum.

These are the best oatmeal (raisin) cookies I've ever made/eaten - I didn't add raisins this time, but added chopped walnuts instead - and used all butter, as another reader suggested - kudos to Beth for the wonderful recipe!

This is a great recipe. Some people said it was runny. So, I rolled the dough into balls and put them on the cookie sheet. I followed the recipe exactly and mine didn't spread out much at all. The next batch I made I shaped into "cookie shapes". These turned out perfect! However, I left them in about 3 minutes too long. Had it not been for my own personal mistake, they would have been absolutely perfect. I will try this recipe again and keep a better eye on the color as they are cooking. The smell alone made the experience worth it!

Do NOT look any further for the oatmeal cookie of your life! These are the BOMB!  Followed directions as written. I refrigerated my dough and made them 2 days later. Chewy, soft and crispy. I love em', the family gobbled them up and I'm making more!
12/15/10- Made them again and my first review sticks. These cookies smell wonderful baking and are absolutely the tastiest! Did not change a thing about the recipe!

We love this recipe! The cloves are a unique change of pace. I made the first batch as is - loved it so much, I had to make another batch. When I made the second batch, I omitted the raisins. To the first split, I added 3/4c. Craisins (which were soaked in warm water). Very good! To the second split, I added 1c. semi-sweet chocolate chips. THIS was the family favorite! Thank you!!

These are wonderful!  I add about a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg as well, because my husband really loves nutmeg.  Have made these with butterscotch chips and also with dried cranberries.  They are delicious without additions too!

These cookies are incredible, it was hard to stop eating the dough, and they turned out nice and chewy. I have already made these cookies twice, and will definitly make them in the future.

This year, I decided to make cookies for my co-workers; I'm stacking them, wrapping them in cellophane topped off with a big sparkly bow...and these were the cookies I chose to do that with!  I did have to test the recipe out first though, and I must say that this is an amazing cookie.  I followed the recipe exactly, and substituted nothing; the only thing was though, I needed really big cookies, so instead of dropping this dough by teaspoonfuls, I took a hunk of it in my palm, patted it into a ball, and baked on parchment paper for 19 minutes at 350 degrees.; I baked 6 at a time (you should have enough dough for 12 cookies this way).  After 19 minutes, when they come out, they might look a little under baked, but leave them sit for 10 minutes and they basically continue to bake on the cookie sheet (even out of the oven); they will also firm up some as well.  Your end result after taking these steps (for the giant cookies) is a soft and chewy centered cookie, that has a bit of a crispy outer...so perfect!  Thank you so very much for this recipe; I will make these over and over again; they are just too good...can't wait to give them away as gifts!

Great recipe.  The half-and-half combination of butter and shortening makes for a perfect cookie that tastes very buttery but does not spread too thin or burn.  I recommend lining the baking sheet with non-stick parchment paper so you don't have to wash the sheet in between batches.  I alternated two cookie sheets covered with parchment paper, so the entire baking process only took about 40 minutes.  I didn't bother to change the parchment paper; I just brushed off the crumbs before putting on the next batch of dough.

The cookies turned out great.  The only changes I made were I used all butter - and I simmered the raisins a few minutes in water and vanilla (next time I'm going to soak them in rum or brandy).  I baked for 12 minutes and they came out a beautiful golden brown.  I had no problems taking them off the cookie sheet.  The consistency of the cookie is semi-soft center and crunchier at the edges.  Made 48 cookies dropped by a small cookie scoop.

Excellent!  I like to add craisins instead, and only add chocolate chips to half the dough.

Yum! I've made this twice now, the first time it didn't come out quite right. The second time I did things a little different from the recipe and per other suggestions: 1) Let the raisins soak for about  10 minutes in water. This made them so moist to bite into.  2) After using  my mixer for wet ingredients I hand mixed in dry ingredients, oats, and raisins. I keep reading over and over that over mixing some cookies and cakes makes them tough/hard. 3) I also added about an extra 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Just a personal preference.  4) I use the small cookie scooper and pack it in there, when it wasn't, the butter melted too quickly and they became thin and crumbly. A cookie scooper is a must for just about all cookies in my book! Makes for a uniform and evenly baked batch. 5) I baked for only 8 minutes. The cookies came out perfect when the edges started to brown but the center looked gooey, almost raw. 
This is now my go to oatmeal raisin recipe!

This is an excellent base recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies. The only things I changed (and this is just my taste, you can do whatever you want), replaced the 1/2 cup butter margarine with butter (I hate the artificial butter taste), put in one tablespoon of vanilla and upped the cloves to 3/4 tablespoon. Can't keep these cookies in the tin for more than 3 days, seriously.

Any negative review, you were just doing something wrong....these are the BEST COOKIES EVER! I took them home for Thanksgiving and I was asked for the recipe on 5 different occasions.  My boyfriends Grandmother who is the best cook imaginable asked me for the recipe to take to her bridge game, that was the best compliment I could have ever gotten!  They also get better each day.  The only thing I changed was use one cup of butter instead of 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening and also they are done between 9-10 minutes (no more no less!).  Also do not leave out the cloves, that is the most important ingredient!

Very good cookies but next time I'll use regular crisco or just use butter because I really dislike that butter flavoured crisco. I used pumpkin pie spice too & will add more cinnamon next time. Thanx!

I am pleased with how these came out. I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup regular shortening, because that's what I had on hand. I also added some shredded coconut that I had leftover and wanted to get rid of. Also, I added some nutmeg. The only thing disappointing about these cookies is that they did not rise very much. They still tasted great, though.  I think next time I will chill the dough.

After reading some of the reviews, I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but decided to try it anyway- I'm glad I did.  My only change to the original recipe was that I added 1/4 tsp. baking powder to avoid any flatenning or spreading.  I rolled my dough into 1 inch balls and they baked fabulously! Also, they have a great flavor.  I will definately keep this recipe.

Good, but not the best ever.  I have no idea what I did wrong, but I expected a lot more.  They do smell wonderful while they're baking, but they weren't chewy and had a slight crumbly texture.  The taste was good, though.  I think I may remake these and substitute more shortening for the butter.

Very nice cookie.  I burnt the bottoms of the first ones by cooking on the bottom rack but they still tasted decent.  The later ones I cooked on the upper rack and they were great.

I have been looking for the 'perfect' oatmeal cookie for years. The first time I made these, I had found it. The second batch...one week later, that's how good they are...I used two sticks of margarine instead of the butter and Crisco. They did not work. Still tated good, but the texture was all wrong. For a real treat, make just like the directions. Wonderful.

OMG! I don't normally care for oatmeal raisin cookies but these were FANTASTIC with the following changes from other reviewers. I used 3/4 c. butter and 1/4 c. plain shortening, 1-1/2 teas. vanilla, 1-3/4 c. flour, 1/4 teas. cloves and threw in a handful of chopped walnuts. Can you say YUMMY????

I just made this recipe this morning. I did something I haven't done sense I found this site and that is, do the recipe "as is" and before I read the reviews. There was a couple of things I did do but I don't think they changed anything too important. 1. I soaked the raisins (only because Mom always did) 2. I used a tablespoon to drop the cookies onto the parchment, and 3. I was too lazy to take my baking stone out of the oven. Baked for 12 minutes and they came out wonderful. Using a tablespoon made 33 cookies. I think that they would have been way too small for any REAL cookie lover using the teaspoon! Next time I may play around with spices just for the fun of it!! ***UPDATE*** I made these this morning, they tasted good but not great. I was going over the recipe with some friends that stopped by for left over soup and found I made a mistake. I only used 1/2c brown sugar rather than the 1c the recipe called for. That could be the difference between "good" and "great".

I actually have this recipe taped to the outside of my oatmeal container. These cookies are very good.  If I don't want a spicey cookie, I simply leave out the spices. These are good either way, chewy with a great flavor. Thank you for this recipe.

Best recipe ever. I made two batches of cookies - one choc chip and one of these. I thought my flatmates would have gobbled up the chocolate chip ones, but these went first. So chewy, sweet, delicious and soft. Very more-ish!

These were good but flat. I compared this recipe to the one on the quaker oats can and the cloves are not the only difference, she adds more butter/crisco...double to be exact. Quaker calls for 2 sticks of butter while she calls for 2 sticks plus 1/2 cup crisco. So the cookies came flat.  Luckily I only baked half the dough so I added more flour, brown sugar and another egg and they came much more thick and still very good.

These cookies are absolutely delicious.  I used all butter (instead of half butter / half shortening) because I think shortening in cookies, cakes, and icing is a crime!  The cookies were soft, chewy, rich, and flavorful.  Yum!

These were good, but not quite what I was looking for.  I wanted a more crunchy oatmeal cookie.

These were GREAT!  I didn't have the butter flavored shortening, so I used all butter.  I also did not have ground cloves and when I went to the store to buy some it was $8 for a small bottle. So instead I used apple pie spice.Maybe next time I have the money I will splurge and try to get soem ground cloves and try them. After reading some reviews I also only baked mine for only 9 minutes. I also left them on the cookie sheet to cool for a few mins. before trying to move them to a wire rack because they were very soft when they came out. All in all, once my family tried the cookies I had to watch them like hawks before they ran off with the rest of them.

Perfect texture!  My only change was in the spices.  I used a pre-made cinnamon blend sold by the Pampered Chef.  A really great recipe.

Perfect recipe! I made it once 3 weeks ago, following the recipe "as is" with great results: soft, chewy, hint of spice...everyone at work raved. Today I made a few adjustments to suit my taste. Used dark brown sugar and reduced it to 3/4 cup, reduced white sugar to 1/3 cup. Added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/4 teaspoon cloves. Used whole rolled oats. Results may be even better! A bit more spice, a more "whole grain" cookie taste and not quite as sugary sweet. So far, the neighbors love them. Perfect with a glass of cold milk!

Delicious cookie! I changed the recipe slightly as I didn't have any raisins. Instead I added cranberries, walnuts and white chocolate chips. I also added about 3 oz. of vanilla pudding mix as I had some left over and needed to use it. Instead of cloves I added a little pumpkin spice and out came a wonderful cookie with a beautiful texture (crispy outside, soft inside). A perfect oatmeal cookie recipe that will now be added to my favorites.

These were the first Oatmeal Raisin cookies I have ever made and I know I will be making ALOT because they are AMAZING. I used regular crisco because I didnt have butter flavored, which was fine and I didnt have any clove so I added a little ground ginger and nutmeg. I love these!!!

Mm MM MMM!!! Yummmmmy! I made mine kinda big so they had to bake a little longer, but there is no need to shape these cookies they spread and form just perfectly. I'd love to tell you how they keep but I don't think they will last through tonight- taking them to a potluck.

Absolutely the BEST oatmeal cookie I have ever made.  The perfect blend of oatmeal and spices and the clove is not overpowering.  11 minutes cooked them to perfection (with the addtional 2 minutes on the pan out of the oven).  Will definitely be holding onto this recipe.  Note - I used regular shortening as I didn't have butter-flavored and the cookies are still perfect.  Thanks Beth.

I followed this recipes pretty closely but the cookies came out kinda too soft that they didn't hold together too well.  But the taste was really really good I must say.  I think next time I will try adding a little more flour and baking soda and bake it a little longer so that they will hold better as some other reviewers have suggested.  I prefer a more chewy cookie over a soft cookie.  Overall, my cookies turned out good except the fact that they didn't hold too well and were a little too soft for my taste.

These were pretty good.  Knowing that the recipe is called "Beth's SPICY Oatmeal Raisin Cookies" I reduced the amounts of cinnamon and cloves, because I didn't want a spicy cookie, just full flavor.  The texture was very good.  I will definitely make these again.

This is a fantastic cookie!  Full of flavor and a great blend of spices.    I changed it just slightly to make it a bit healthier.  Instead of white flour, I used whole wheat flour.  I think the nutty flavor combined with the spices even better than white flour would.  I also added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, quite by accident, but it worked out well.  I adjusted the recipe for 4 dozen instead of 3.  This created a bit of a problem as it asked for 2 3/4 eggs and I wasn't about to toss 1/4 of an egg.  So, I did use 3 eggs.  No noticeable difference.  I think I'll save this as my "go to" oatmeal raisin cookie!

made a half batch, used dark brown sugar and chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Raisins probably would be better--chocolate and cloves not the perfect combo.  But fantastic cookies.

I just made these and my Husband LOVES them!! I only changed the crisco I did not use it,also I used allspice instead of the cloves. I don't know if because I used all butter,but the cookies fell apart!! Other than that (we can deal with that) They are the BEST oatmeal cookies we have EVER ate!! Thanks for recipe!

Delicious recipe!  I used bread flour instead of all-purpose and the cookies turned out very chewy and super yummy.

I thought I was going to eat all the batter before even cooking them...what a perfect cookie. I added walnuts, they cooked to perfection in exactly 12 minutes. Still chewy but with that brown goodness taste.

These definitely taste wonderful, but mine came out so thin! Are they supposed to be more like a crisp than a cookie? I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting all butter for the half butter/half shortening. Has anyone else had this experience?

I made these the other week to cheer up my boyfriend.  Worked like a charm, he couldn't stop raving about them.  Also, my mom ate a half dozen in one sitting, and oatmeal raisin are normally her least favorite cookie.  Fantastic recipe.

(Update:  My boyfriend is begging to bake these with me when he comes for Thanksgiving, and the batch I made for my co-workers was a complete hit!)

I thought these cookies were absolutely delicious!  I substituted the raisins with craisins and added white chocolate chips to half the batch and with the other half i used semi sweet chocolate chips and pecans...  both AMAZING!!  this is basically the same recipe on the quaker oats box, but who would have thought the clove would make such a big difference for that added zip?!  my new favorite!

Fabulous! I didn't have raisins, so I used chocolate chips.  The cookies tasted like normal oatmeal raisin cookies, but with the surprise taste of dark chocolate once in a while.  I especially loved how the recipe creamed the eggs and vanilla in with the sugar at the beginning, instead of adding in the eggs later.  It saved a bit of time, I feel like.

Chewey, cruncy, spicey..Yummy.  This recipe is identical to the Cocoa Oatmeal Cookies on this site - with 2 exceptions - spices instead of cocoa - and baking soday instead of powder.  The powder makes the cookies spread a bit more and make them seem bigger... Next time I'll try this recipe with the cocoa and the baking soda...

Great cookies, I used 50/50 smart balance blend sticks and I didn't have any oats so I used instant apple cinnamon oatmeal packets and omitted the white sugar and added white chocolate chips, wow, really good ;o

I didn't have the butter flavoured shortening, and  just used margarine instead of butter. (Used 1 cup of margarine)  I also used Allspice and used a bit more than the 1 tsp of spices recommended.  These are very very good!

This is my son's favorite cookie and he said these are the best he has ever had.  We don't care for cloves, so I left that ingredient out.  They turned out chewey, sweet, and full of flavor.  I used twice the raisins and butter instead of the butter flavored Crisco.  This will be my standard oatmeal raisin cookie recipe.  Thank you Beth!

Very good cookies!  I didn't have buttered shortening so I used all butter like others suggested.  I added about 1/4 cup of white choc chips at my husband's request.  I tried several suggestions for the baking portion.  1) just as written (350F for 10 mins.), 2) 300F for 15 mins., 3) convection baking, 4) refrigerating the dough for 30 mins. first.  I liked the cookies baked just as written.  There was no difference in refriging the dough.  But I made sure my butter was softened, not melted or warm.  I'm not a fan of convection baking.  Those cookies were extra flat.  I have similar results with other cookies, and, as a cake decorator, don't like conv baking cakes.  Great recipe and it makes lots of dough.  I froze some for later.

I love these cookies! The only bad thing about them is they came out VERY flat the first time I made them. But the second time I added a lil more flour and a lil more baking soda and now they are turning out better. I am baking them right now to take to a family get-together. They're my favorite. sooo scrumptious :) ha. If you've never made these before, you definitely should :D

This is the only oatmeal cookie recipe I use now. I use the recipe as a base and create a lot of different versions. Once I made them with 1 1/2 cups granola, 1 cup oats and 1/2 cup shredded coconut. It was divine! Also, I like to add in a handful of nuts from time to time. Almonds, pecans and walnuts all work very well and add great flavor.

Not very impressed. They were not very flavorful, and definitely not the right texture for an oatmeal cookie. Not terrible, but definitely does not deserve the five stars that it seems to be getting.

Made these cookies or Father's Day and they were a hit. With the exception of only having veg shortening I followed recipe to the tee. They came out very moist and the hint of spice gave it the right taste. Thank you for an awesome recipe, will definitely make again.

I used currants instead of raisins, and tossed in some chopped pecans and dried cranberries for a little extra crunch and tang respectively. I also used cinnamon, cloves and pumpkin pie spice, and all butter. An absolutely perfect, delicious cookie!

Okay, I just threw out my recipe for oatmeal cookies. These are fabulous. The cloves make it!. Baked for 12 minutes and let sit on the pan for 3 minutes and...presto! A little bit of heaven.

Yummmmmmm!  I halved the recipe b/c I was testing it, used all butter (no shortening in the house), used rather generous tablespoon size drops of the batter (didn't want to dirty more trays), and baked 10 minutes.  These are fantastic!  I may even use more raisins/cinnamon next time - but its a personal preference - the recipe is not lacking for anything.

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made.  I've tried the Quaker Oat recipes, and it has never made good cookies.  I add more cinnamon and more raisins, but other than that, I'm done searching for a recipe.

I don't even normally like Oatmeal Raisin, but I had all the ingredients and thought I'd try them for my 2 year old. OH my goodness! I love these! Totally delicious and should be tried by all.

I would give these more stars if I could!  I have been looking for just the right oatmeal raisin cookie and this one is it!!! I left out the cloves for my own personal taste and they still had a nice, spicy flavor!  This will be the only recipe I use now.  Thank you!!!

They were amazing. I cooked them for about 10 minutes and I also added a hint of ginger. After cooking we sprinkled more cloves on top for an extra kick. They are so soft!! We didn't have butter flavored shortening so we just used regular stuff, next time I might just go full butter like others. Also, I want to try them with dark brown sugar (that's all we ever buy), and lower the amount of white sugar (I think I misread the measuring cup and added too much because they were a little too sweet). Otherwise, they were incredibly easy to make and were delicious. I baked them with the 12yr old girl I'm babysitting and we had to halve the recipe because of an oatmeal shortage, and we both had fun and easy time. I think this is my new oatmeal cookie recipe forever.

Beautiful! Loved them... 10 minutes did the trick for us.  Used all butter and love the kick with the cloves.  I'm going to try the crasins next time and maybe some nuts too.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

These were tastey...yes the ingredients are almost exactly like the one on the oatmeal box but who cares, its a cookie and it tastes good! One down side is that they began to get hard after only a day (even in a air tight container) So if you make this cookie its best to eat it fresh from the oven or at least in the first 24 hours ;)

Very good recipe.  I used all butter (no shortening), added 1/4 nutmeg and no raisins.  I liked that it stayed soft and chewy;  most of the oatmeal cookie recipes I have tried the cookie gets pretty crunchy, but not this one.

Won't ever need to look for another oatmeal raisin recipe again....this one is it!!  Used all butter since I didn't have the butter shortening.  They made such nice round chewy cookies, didn't spread much. Used a medium cookie scoop.  Wonderful!  Thank you!

Loved the cloves!!!  My oh my...watching them bake right now and have not noticed any spreading.  The only thing I changed was adding butterscotch chips instead of raisins.  This is definetely a keeper for me.  Now if I could only keep my husband from eating all the dough...

Very Good! Only changes made was using 1 cup butter, and no shortening. They turned out perfect - baked in a convection oven took only about 7-8 minutes. Made one batch of 12 cookies and refrigerated the rest of dough. The next day made another batch of 12 cookies and noticed less spread, since dough had been chilled. I prefer this batch at a time because hubby and I could consume the entire recipe in one day given the chance. Thanks for sharing.

I had to change my review, I took the first batch out too soon and they were hard to get off the sheet with the spatula.They were not very attractive looking and fell apart. I left the next batch in the oven a little longer and they came out much better. My husband and son really loved them!! They dont look the best, but the guys love them because they are soooo moist.

These turned out great. Not crunchy till I overcooked one batch but a yummy soft cookie. It makes a lot. I would halve the recipe next time (and I have 3 kids).

When a friend has a birthday, I offer to make them the cookies of their choosing.  Finally, after numerous variations of the chocolate chip cookie, I had a request for oatmeal raisin.  Nearly 2200 positive ratings did not disappoint!  These cookies were shared at the birthday party (we're all adults) and every person raved about them.  I am making them again this weekend for a camping trip and I expect the same results!  The only thing I changed was to omit the cloves, only because I didn't have them on hand.  Great recipe, highly recommended, thanks for sharing!

These cookies are amazing! My husband and I can't keep away from them.  I skipped the shortening and doubled the butter instead.  Also, I didn't have any cloves, so I just skipped it altogether.  The cookies were definitely done after 8 minutes.  Absolutely delicious!

I used margarine instead of butter and just regular organic shortening. The cookies still turn out great and stays soft for a few days! I like the spices in this cookie so I usually up them all a little!

These were awesome! Last time I made them, they needed a ton more spice to be spicy. So this time I did 1 TBSP. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and ginger. I also used half whole wheat flour and organic cane sugars. Delicious!

I made a large amount of dough.  The first batch of cookies was aweful - wet, oily and the cookies blended together.  I put the rest of the dough into the refrigerator thinking I would add more flour or oats later.  I didn't have time, but discovered that when I made the next batch, they were wonderful.  The original problem was the butter was too soft.

I was looking for a chewy oatmeal cookie and this recipe was very good.  I had to substitute Splenda white and brown sugar because my husband is diabetic.  I found that the amount of sugar called for is too high.  I would use less sugar the next time and use more nuts, cranberries and or raisins.  Also more spices.

My kids would probably give them a 4 or 5.  I think they have a little too much cloves in them, although I really like the flavor in these cookies. I cooked them for 10 mins and maybe should have done them longer, they were chewy(excellent!) but fell apart like crazy after they cooled off.  But all in all, they're great cookies.

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.  Only thing I changed was to use entirely whole wheat flour, and I used chocolate chips instead of raisins because we are chocoholics.  Next time I think I will try the raisins though.  While I'm not usually crazy about them in oatmeal cookies, I think somehow in these ones they'd be really good.

These are very good, they get slightly crisp on the edges but still soft and chewy in the middle, yum : ) I think this is because of the combo of regular butter, I used Safflower margarine, and shortening, good idea! I used a little more cinnamon, less clove and a dash of nutmeg to make them a tad less spicy and I used plain non hydrogenated shortening since it's hard to find non hydrogenated butter flavor shortening but next time I might add a little butter flavoring to see if it makes a difference, thanks!

These were good! I had no butter, so I used all shortening and they tasted fine- I just pressed them down a little before putting them in the oven. I let mine bake too long, so I put them in a plastic back with two pieces of moist bread to soften them up over night- worked like a charm!

Oh my, these cookies are unreal!  I left out the raisins but added dried cranberries, white chocolate chips, and candied walnuts....I have been asked for the recipe at least five times.  Everyone wants to know what the special taste is...i am guessing that they are talking about the clove.

I made these cookies without any changes to the recipe, and they turned out wonderful.  The only thing that I would change next time is to add a little less ground cloves.  Still an excellent cookie, though.

These are awesome cookies.  The only change I made was to use margarine instead of butter and shortening.  They have a "grown up" flavour to them!

These cookies are amazing!  Didn't have the cloves so substituted that with allspice.  Also, I added pecans to the mixture.  These turned out really good.  I had to bake them a little longer, more like 11-12 minutes and they came out perfect.  As others suggested, I used 1 c of butter and omitted the shortening.  Will definitely be making these again and OFTEN!!!

I agree with most; this is one of the best Oatmeal Raisin cookies I've had!  I chose to add 1/4 cup more flour because I like my cookies cakey, and I decreased the ground cloves to 1/4tsp.  Also I think next time I make these I will increase the cinnamon by 1/2 tsp.!

Very chewy and yummy!  Great recipe.  Made changes on second batch by using 3/4 c whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup all purpose, using 1/2 c brown sugar Splenda, and using pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves.  Great both ways :-)

I used all butter, old fashioned oats and baked for 12 mins.  They came out chewy on the inside with a nice crisp edge and the flavor is great--not overly rich and nice balance of spices.

Very yummy; my family,co-worker and myself loved the spicy taste !  I live overseas and don't always have easy access to US ingredients. Instead of butter flakes, I used as one reviewer did, one cup of butter.I also halved both brown & white sugar, and the cookies were still very yummy.  I was expecting them crunchier.They were crunchy out of the oven, and became moist.But,they held together nicely.Even a few days old they are still moist.  I will soon be preparing a second batch for the workplace so this is recipe was a hit !

This is absolutely the best oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever had! It's even better than grandma's. These cookies just melt in your mouth. They are perfect! I added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to give it some crunch, but didn't change anything else. This will definitely be my ONLY oatmeal raisin cookie recipe from now on. The only problem is...they're not very healthy. It would be great if someone could come up with a healthy cookie recipe that tastes this great:)

I was charged by my brother and his fiance to make "His and Hers' favorite cookies for their wedding reception.  His pick was Oatmeal Raisin Cookies.  There was a recipe that I used to make in high school for him that he really liked.  I made it and this recipe I found online and sent them to him to taste test.  He voted for this one hands down.  Great cookie recipe.  I added a bit a nutmeg like others suggested and I soaked the raisins in hot water to plump them up a bit.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Now I've just got to make 18 dozen of them. :)  Thanks for a great recipe.

My new go-to Oatmeal raisin cookie recipe. I've been looking for a good one for quite some time now and I can finally end my search.  Chewy, soft, and dense with just the right amount of spice and raisins.  I used all butter because I don't like the artificial ingredients of shortening.  Great buttery taste.  So delicious!

The texture was great!  Thick and cake like...However, next time I make them, I think I will add double the cinnamon and cloves....(I really couldn't taste either in the finished baked product.)  But definetly worth trying!!

As others suggested, I used all butter, soaked the raisins and halved the baking soda.  I also realized mid-recipe that I didn't have enough sugar, so I used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup honey.  As I expected the dough was a bit more wet than it should have been so I added about another half cup of flour (white whole wheat).  They are really tasty.

My family ADORES this recipe! It's not Christmas without them. They make the house smell WONDERFUL and never last long! I followed a lot of the recommendations of other people. I used all butter/margarine(depending on what I have on hand. Both work great), extra 1/2 tsp baking soda and 11 minute cooking time was perfect. And added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I just adore this recipe!

This recipe was awesome. I followed it exactly as it was written and it was excellent. The only thing I substituted was chocolate chips for raisins because we are a chocoholic family. They were chewy and yummy.

This recipe is incredibly good. My kids & family can't get enough. I did not change one thing on the recipe (accept double the batter as my family go thru these cookies in one day with just the one batch - they are gone before you know it!)

Wonderful! Soft, chewy and flavorful. Makes the perfect amount. Play with the seasoning- subtract the cloves, add more cinnamon, use a little nutmeg- have fun.

This recipe had the flavor and texture I was looking for- lots of spice and chewy. Everybody loved them. However, I cannot figure out how to make them "puff up".  They weren't totally flat, but they weren't like the bakery.  I mixed ingredients by hand, didn't grease the cookie sheet, had 350 oven, didn't overbake (only 10 min rather than 12...  I used "Baking Raisins".  I added butter extract to regular Crisco shortening.  I also used quick cooking oats-

These were very good.  The only change we made was to substitute unsweetened applesauce for the shortening.  Definitely a keeper.

Yes - this is a good cookie.  I checked it against the recipe on the Quaker Oats' Box and it's the exact same, with the exception of the 1/2 tsp cloves.  I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg for extra flavor and a pinch of freshly grounded pepper.

This is definately a wonderful recipe. I ran out of brown sugar so had 3/4 cup brown and then did 3/4 cup white. I also only had about 3/4 t of cinnamon. They truned out fabulous!! I am sure they are even better with all the correct measurements. Cooked up nice and soft with just a hint of a crisp to them. Didn't flatten out, stayed nice and puffy. And the recipe says 'Spicy' I find the spice just right, not too spicy. That scared me on first look. I will make these again and again!

I'm not a huge fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, but these definitely satisfy the occasional craving.  They are the perfect blend of chewy and crispy, and I love all the spices (which I overdo just a little, on purpose.)

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had.  I don't like cloves that much so I reduced the amt added to less than a 1/2 tsp.  The cookies were soft and chewy - just like I wanted!

THE BEST EVER. I added some nutmeg and allspice because I never have cloves.  Sometimes I add shredded coconut.  I keep half the batch in the freezer so I don't eat them all at once!

I made these for my husband and his co-workers, as they are his favorite.  Everyone said they were the best oatmeal raisin cookies they have ever had, and all asked what I put in them to make them so good.  My guess is that although the spices and butter-flavored shortening are minor changes from the Quaker recipe,  they create major changes in taste.  You could also substitute choc chips for raisins, spread in a pan to make a bar cookie and drizzle melted chocolate on top when they come out of the oven...very rich version, but very good.

I was very much swayed by the amount of reviews for this recipe--only to be disappointed. The cookies came out okay (were pretty flat and not as dense as I like/expected, any reasons why?) but not amazing by any means. Just okay. Wonder where I went astray.... if you're looking for a decent oatmeal raisin cookie, this will do it. But a standout, crowd pleaser, super star cookie? Keep looking b/c this ain't it!

I thought that this cookie was the best oatmeal raisin cookie i have ever had. although it is quite similar to the quaker recipe she has added her own flare to it. :) There is nothing wrong with doing that, in fact if you compare several recipes then most are alike in ways. These cookies came out with a texture between crunchy and chewy and just had an explosion of flavor in your mouth. This is definately my favorite recipe and the only thing i changed was i added an extra 1/2 teas. of cinnamon but thats only because i love cinnamon so much.

These oatmeal cookies are fantastic. Yes, they come out a little thin, but it gives them a nice crisp to them.  I varied the recipe by adding a 1/4cup of chopped walnuts and a equal portion of 90% cocoa chocolate chips to the mix.  Oh man are they good right out of the oven warm.  Ice cream anyone? Enjoy!

Best oatmeal cookies! yum! I used all butter instead of shortening, and made half the batch with no raisins and the other half with dried cherries and walnuts. Both were very tasty!

These oatmeal cookies are outstanding!  I followed the recipe to a T but pulled them a little early to make sure they'd stay soft and chewy ( I can't stand hard cookies!!).  I'll definitely be adding these to my recipe book :o) and can't wait to bring them to work for Pot-Luck Friday!

I love oatmeal raisin cookies and these have got to be one of the best that I have made.  I read a lot of the comments and followed their advice, I used pumpkin pie spice. I will make these as often as my hips will allow.

I have never made a better oatmeal cookie.  I only had sugared pecans so I used them they added a nice chewy crunch... I have also made the oatmeal box cookie and never turned out this good.  This is a keeper

Made this recipe today after having a craving for oatmeal raisin cookies.  Used all butter and omitted the cloves since I didn't have any in the pantry.  Cookies were awesome - moist and chewy - just how I love them.  Even my husband thought they were really good.  Would DEFINITELY make this again.

Well, this is basically the Vanishing Oatmeal Cookie recipe on the Quaker Oats box with two changes - half of the butter was substituted with (ugh) butter-flavored Crisco and ground cloves were added. The Vanishing recipe is still our favorite.  We do not like the butter flavored Crisco.  Crisco will give you a crisper cookie and all butter will give you a chewier cookie so if crispy cookies are what you crave try 3/4 cups unsalted butter and 1/4 cup regular Crisco. I also pour a cup of boiling water over the raisins to plump them up, drain and lay on paper towels to get rid of excess moisture, and then stir into the dough.  Trust me, these cookies  won't go to waste, but we like the Vanishing all-butter recipe better.

These cookies turned out really flat.  The only thing I changed was I used plain shortening instead of the butter flavor only because that is what I happened to have on hand. I will never make these again.

We tried this recipe this year and we really liked them.  They turned out very flat, so I'm not sure what happened.  Even though they were very flat they also were very chewy.  We didn't have the ground cloves so we substitued pumpkin pie spice instead.  We found that the cookies needed more spice after baking them.  Next time we will just up the cinnamon and the pumpkin pie spice a little bit.  Overall, we really liked these!

My new favorite oatmeal cookie recipe! They are soft and have nice flavor. I added half the amount of sugar (as I do in all baking), added half whole wheat flour,  and I put in 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips and 1/2 cup raisins instead of all raisins. With my small cookie scoop I made 110 little, two bite cookies. Four days later and they are still soft.

This is the recipe on the Quacker Oats lid, except for the cloves.  I made these without the cloves and they were excellent.  You can not over bake these cookies or they will be hard.  Pull them out of the oven even though you don't think they are done.

These were delicious! Soft and chewy and just the right sweetness.  I am not usually a big oatmeal raisin person,  but these are definitely a keeper.  Added a handful of craisins just cause, but not necessary.  Took exactly 12 minutes to brown in my oven

If I could give this 20 stars I would!  These are HANDS DOWN THE BEST cookies ever. And let me tell you, I'm not even a fan of Oatmeal Raisin cookies. I was baking them for a friend for Christmas, but now they are gone (it's been six hours) and I have to go bake another batch. I followed the recipe to the letter and they were perfect. The dough is stiff so I shaped little balls out of the dough with my hands and flattened them on the pan.  Beth needs to write a cookbook.  So so so amazing. I will never use another recipe.

Excellent as written -wonderfully spiced and a great texture!  Even though the original is great, I usually alter the recipe for my family to make them a bit healthier & they're still delicious!  I use 1/4 c olive oil in place of shortening and decrease the butter to 1/3 c.  I reduce the brown sugar to 3/4 c, which is still plenty sweet, and use 3/4 c AP flour and 3/4 c whole wheat flour.  I'm not a fan of cloves so I use 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp ginger in place of them.  I've used raisins & craisins and both are great.  I even make lactation cookies with this recipe by adding 2 generous Tbsps flax meal and 2 generous Tbsps brewers yeast.  Love them!

delish and soft.  I think I forgot the baking soda but they rose well and are moist and chewy.  watch them carefully though, my first batch burned a bit on the bottom as I kept them in when the tops didn't look done.  don't do that!  take them out and tap on the tops to see if they're done, even if they look sort of raw.  my second and third batches were perfect.  I used pumpkin pie spice, a little additional cinnamon, and golden raisins.  to get 36, I made mine larger than a teaspoon, more like a generous tablespoon, but we like them big!  thanks for sharing.

I'm sure this is a 5 star recipe but i made a few changes.I saw a recipe for blueberry cookies except they came out terrible they were flat and fell apart. so i tried this one with my changes. The first, skip the raisins and add BLUEBERRIES. If defrosting berries add a few extra table spoons flour to dry mix.I also only use cinnamon as the spice and change the baking soda to 1/4 soda and 3/4 baking powder. They came out PERFECT just like blueberry muffins with out the dry bread taste.

These cookies were outstanding. Some I added just raisens, some just chocolate chips and some with both. All of them were incredible. My only suggestion is to use parchment paper to bake since my batches without it stuck to the pan.

It's not as if these cookies need another fantastic review...but they deserve it.  They are moist, spicy and just plain delicious.  Make these, follow the recipe exactly and you will NOT be disappointed!

To die for!!!  I'm not the biggest oatmeal raisin cookie fan but these I can't stop eating!  I made them for my cousin who is stationed in Baghdad right now but as I was packing them up I couldn't stop eating them.  The only thing I changed was I didn't add cloves (simply because I didn't have any on hand).  These are delicious!!!

Excellent recipe!  I left out the raisins because I, personally, don't like them.  I added a package of instant vanilla pudding to ensure that the cookies were moist (they were).  I did not have butter flavored shortening, so I added 1 teaspoon of butter flavoring instead!

These cookies came out perfectly.  It is the same recipe as that on the oatmeal container but the change to half shortening/half butter is what makes them great.  I too always had trouble with the other recipe resulting is flat, greasy cookies.  Will definitely be a part of my cookie gifts this year.

This was a great recipe! Even though I forgot the baking soda (oops) and omitted the raisins (don't like them) it still came out amazing. My suggestion for those who had difficulty with their cookies breaking apart: make thicker cookies. My thinner cookies were a tad crumbly, but my thicker cookies were perfect! My husband and I scarfed half a recipe down in two days. This recipe is a keeper!

This is definitely a winner!!!  To the person who gave it one star and said it was the same as the quaker oat recipe, I think there must be more to it that only the addition of cloves.  I recently made that recipe and the cookies all blended together and all fell apart (used for ice cream topping instead).  With this recipe the cookies were delicious, moist and did not fall apart.  I would totally recommend it!  It is impossible to have just one!  I also omitted the shortening and used all butter.

These are great cookies.  They stay soft, and have just the right amount of spice.  I divided the dough, and made half of the cookies oatmeal raisin and half oatmeal chocolate chip.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this recipe was too way too salty even though I used unsalted butter. Next time I would use 1/2 the amount of salt. I used 1/2 cup of wheat germ and 1 cup of flour instead of the 1 1/2 cup of flour that the recipe called for. This made it healthier, but didn't seem to affect the chewiness. I agree with some other reviewers in that it's best to chill the dough before putting it in the oven especially if you are using all butter instead of half butter and half shortening. I got nowhere near 3 dozen cookies from this recipe, but I do like larger cookies.

I loved them!!!
It takes about ten minutes to put all ingredients that you always (well, i am:)) keep on hand 2gether! And how terrific they are! And almost healthy too;) I made first batch without changing a thing (except that I only used butter as I always do). My second batch... It was unusual... I subbed vanilla protein powder for flour since I addicted to low-carb diet, BB other stuff:))) It was a little hard to work with dough and I even had to add some milk, but cookies were almost like they have to! Kinda chewy (if u ever ate high-protein bars, u know what I'm talking about), but I like this thing a lot. So, oat=complex carbs, splenda instead of sugar (well, it suppose to be sweet, right?), and a lot of protein (I Used MultiPower Formula 80 whey)... A present for my trainer:)

Absolutely delicious! Did not change a thing other than to soak the raisins for about 10 minutes in warm water before adding them to the recipe. My cookies turned out a bit flat, so perhaps I will stick them in the fridge to firm up the dough next time. Flavor cannot be beat! Highly recommend!

Serious yummers!  This is now my families second favorite cookie and THAT is some seriously high praise!  I didn't have butter and used all butter flavor crisco... they were still absolutely delicious!  If you bake two pans at a time, you may need to add a couple minutes bake time.

This has become my favorite cookie recipe! In addition to using all butter, I added 1/2 tsp of allspice with the cloves, used golden raisins, added 1 cup of orange flavored craisins, and two cups of walnuts.
You won't believe how fantastic these are!

i used 1/2 c of raisins and 1/2 cup of craisins and about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips (b/c i had all on hand).  very good!  the texture is great and they brown up nicely.  the cloves add a nice little kick and make it a great holiday cookie.

Wish I could give 3 1/2 stars. These were good but the cloves were a little odd. Not what I;m used to but good for a potluck or something. I might try these again.

Really Good & Really Versatile. I swap out the raisins for all sorts of things - have tried dried cherries, choco chips, macadamia nuts, etc. Very good.

This is my new oatmeal cookie recipe!!!  If I were not married to my husband already, I would marry one of these cookies :)  The only thing I changed was to use 2 sticks of real butter instead of 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and I did NOT use the cloves or raisins due to personal preference.  This one is definitely worth the 5 stars.  Next time I will double cuz these will be gone in no time!!

Really tasty, I only wish they were more chewy, once they cool they become crisp.

These were very good!  I don't know if they were amazing - but they will get eaten for sure.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisins at my husbands request.  Easy to make and cooked up just right.

I love the cloves in these!  I was a bit generous with my spice measurements.  My husband made off with a bit of my cookie dough before I could finish baking all the cookies and he loved it!  Will definitely make this recipe again.

Great recipe! I made these for some friends and they loved them! I have very limited baking experience so that tells you anyone can make great cookies.
I'm not a fan of raisins so I threw in a cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips for the best oatmeal/chocolate cookies I've tasted. I wont need to buy out anymore.

To use my husband's words, "fantastic".  Only change I made was to soak my raisins for a few minutes in hot water because they weren't the freshest and to add about 3/4 cup chopped pecans because I didn't have walnuts.  Will absolutely make again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! Great flavor! Perfect amount of spices! I only cooked my for 8 minutes and they stayed perfectly chewy! I also didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used 1/2 C of regular shortening and 1/2 cup of butter. Great recipe! Thanks!!

Great recipe! IMO, the shortening really makes this recipe. I've tried countless oatmeal cookie recipes but this is the first using shortening, and is definately the best. Using shortening gives them a wonderful texutre. I omitted the raisins (only because I didn't have any) and substituted white chocolate chips and they turned out delicious!

Best Oatmeal Raisin Cookie I've ever tasted! I left a small batch of cookie dough without raisins overnight and it seemed to make the clover/cinnamon taste MUCH stronger the next day. If I were to refrigerate overnight again, I'd cut back on the spices. Still an excellent recipe though!

I think these cookies are great.  Even with making a few changes (I was out of raisins, so I used cran-raisins, and added roasted pumpkin seeda)  A nice texture and great flavor.  Thanks to Beth.

There should be one rating above 5 stars:  just like Grandma used to make!  These are truly incredible!  The house smells wonderful and they were easy.  My five-year-old helped me make them and he says these cookies are the best!  Thank you!

I thought these were nice, but found the dough to be very wet.  I added flour to reach the proper consistency, but still had to bake them much longer than stated.  Good cookies tho!

I took the advice of another reviewer and added more cinnamon, some nutmeg and some ginger.  I used King Arthur's White Whole Wheat flour (which I LOVE; I can put it in almost anything and hardly tell the difference from white flour-try it in chocolate cake!), and added extra raisins and a few tablespoons more oats.  Instead of the white/brown sugar mix, I used all white sugar and added a little molasses (I didn't measure, but it was probably close to 2 tablespoons)  We really liked them a lot, though next time I think I'll cut the sugar a little bit if I increase the raisins.

Oh my! I made these 2 weekends in a row and they didn't last through Sunday! The first time I used 1/3 C butter 2/3 C shortening (what I had on hand) and it worked just fine. They were chewy and delicious. Both times I doubled the spices which really added to the flavor. And I used Allspice instead of cloves. I think they are even better the second day. We'll definitely make these again!

Huge hit with my Dad! He can eat them all by himself! I use all margarine instead of the shortening, that's all I had on hand the first time I made them and have just stuck with it. Can't count how many times I made them and they are always scrumptious!

WOW! I love raisins and Christmas so this was a double joy for me to do in the middle of July! I didn't have all the ingredients so I just had to make do with what I had and they turned out amazing. I can't wait to try them again with the stated ingredients!

This is a good basic oatmeal cookie recipe and fairly healthy too. I reduced the recipe to half for 2 of us and I  added dried cherries, cranberries & walnuts--I also used allspice in place of  cloves. I baked 10 min> let rest on pan 2 min and  removed - a nice chewy cookie!

This turned out to be a very good oatmeal cookie. I made very few modifications to the recipe - I made two batches, one with chocolate chips and one with raisins and craisins. For each I added a little more than the recommended amount. I also left out the cloves because I did not have any on hand. Unlike some other reviewers, I had no issues with the baking time. Twelve minutes turned out a perfectly soft, slightly golden cookie.

This recipe was not to our liking. First of all-- it needed more spice. I suggest adding a pinch of ginger and nutmeg, in addition to the cinnamon and cloves. There is not hardly enough levening. You need 1 t baking powder and 1 t baking soda. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of flour, use 2 1/2. Honestly, if I was you, I would look for a different recipe.

We thought these were good the first day, but super great the next day. I did double the cinnamon and cloves and plumped the raisins like others did, yummy!

I just popped these out of my oven. Wow. Delicious...and buttery. One complaint. The cookies are very flat and crumbly. I used all butter ..maybe thats it? I'll try again because the taste was amazing!

The cookies were very good. Although, I did have some trouble with it. I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it. I used my Pampered Chef stones that have aided in many cookie baking successes. The first few batches were very,very flat. I added a bit more flour which seemed to help. I was surprised to see how quickly the cookies turned brown as well. This is still a very good recipe, I'll just have to be watchful of the batter consistency. It was a warm day today, so that could have thrown it off a bit. Thank you for sharing. Hubby will be bringing a dish full of yummy cookies tomorrow.

I made this recipe following the directions. I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I added the butter flavoring as another reviewer suggested.  My husband is a chocolate lover and I added about 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips along with the raisins.  Your right about getting some as they go quickly.  PERFECT COOKIE!!!!!  Wonderful..it is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.

Simple. and yet amazingly delicious!
thanks for sharing the recipe!
they lasted a whole day and a half and my family is demanding that i make more.
one of my family members refuses to eat raisins, so i did a half and half batch, i added 1/2 c. raisins to half, and then i used 1/2 c. craisins. she loved them! truthfully, i couldnt tell the difference between the two, but the dark raisins, and the vibrant red of the craisins made a beautiful assortment.
thanks again for the recipe.

I liked these but there was something about the texture that was just not perfect. The edges were a little crispy for what I'd expected and the middle was softer but it did have a sort of dry texture. They didn't melt in my mouth, more like crumbled. Maybe use all shortening? I'd probably make again trying a few alterations to get the texture just perfect for my preferences. They did get eaten all up, so I guess that means something!

These turned out amazing just like all the other reviews claim. I followed the recipe exactly except I used all butter instead of shortening. I baked them for 9 minutes and at first I was nervous they weren't done, but after 10-15 minutes of cooling and setting, they were perfect. Great with a glass of milk!

This is my new FAVORITE cookie (I gave it 4 stars because I used chocolate chips instead of raisins).  Next time I will use raisins...I can't wait until next time I make these...since they are almost gone!

I made these as written with regular shortening.  I scooped them with a cookie dough scoop so they were quite thick. I did have to flatten them a little in order to get them to bake through.  I also added chopped walnuts as another reviewer suggested. YUM!!

My husband LOVES Oatmeal Cookies so I wanted to find a recipe that was something a little out of the ordinary...this is it!  I subsitute the the sugar for Splenda brown sugar blend and I use the Pampered Chef "Cinnamon Plus" for the spice (Cinnamon blend with cloves, lemon, allspice, nutmeg) and the cookies come out perfect every time!nderful!

I used 1/2c butter and 1/2c margarine and I also used the quick cooking oats. Baked for 9-10 min. Came out just perfect. Thank you!

This is the BEST recipe. I made these cookies with Craisins over the weekend and they were a huge hit.  Everyone seemed to like them better with the craisins.  I love them either way! I leave a few out and have to put the rest in the freezer immediately before we eat them all!  They freeze up well and it's nice to have them on hand when the mood for something sweet hits.

These were some great cookies! Definitely chewy and flavorful. The amount of spices were perfect, I think, however instead of raisins I put chopped pecans as I really hate raisins.

These cookies are a absolute treat!  They baked up soft, not crunchy, just what was needed for the church before-service breakfast.  The spices were just right, and everyone enjoyed it.  The cookies disappeared, no leftovers at all.:)  A keeper which will be made often at my house.

This recipe is sssssssssoooooooo good. I made a few changes though, instead of using baking powder flour etc. I used Presto's self rising cake flour with salt and baking powder already added. I made two batches the first I left for 8mins and which was very chewy the next batch stayed for 10mins which made it a little more crispy...either way the were a hit!! great recipe!!!

These were great! SO moist and flavorful. I had to add an additional 2 Tbsp of flour because I live in Colorado at a higher altitude so that my cookies did not come out flat.  Send them with the husband on a skiing trip and he said everyone loved them.  Thanks for the tastey recipe.

This is the best oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever eaten. I always get requests for these. I add a bit more of each of the spices, and substitute allspice for the cloves. UPDATE: I've started adding 2 tbsp custard powder when creaming the butter/sugar - these cookies just got better!

wonderful,  doubled the batch, followed the directions except used all butter. I hate using shortening way to greasy IMO. This is my new go to oatmeal cookie!

These cookies are divine!  The spice and oatmeal combo is glorious. They always say you should bake cookies when you have an open house and I chose to bake these!  I made a triple batch and a stream of visitors later, they were all gone.  I don't know if I can thank the cookies but we only needed one open house to sell our home!

Wonderful cookie, deliciously moist.  I followed the recipe except used salted butter, omitted the salt, and added 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour.  Next time I will cut the white sugar.  The cookie is a bit sweeter than I would like for my toddler.  

The cloves make the cookie sing!  My brother ground them by hand with a mortar and pestle, and what a difference it made!

Ever since I printed and tried this recipe two years ago, it's the only oatmeal cookie recipe I use.  I get such great compliments on these. I hear "These are the best cookies I've ever had!" when I share them with people.  Thanks so much Beth!!

I only add 1/4 tsp. cloves and about 2 1/2 cups of rolled oats.  It doesn't make them as dry and crunchy because I love soft cookies.

Definently one of my favorite cookie recipes. It made the whole house smell wonderful when I was baking them. My whole family loved these oatmeal raisin cookies. The cookies were gone very quickly and I wished I had made lots more. Don't change anything about the recipe, and I definently recommend them.

I love this recipe, but I switched from all-purpose flour to whole wheat & from shortening to canola oil. My husband and daughter loved the cookies. This recipe is definitely a keeper (with healthier modifications).

Perfect Oatmeal cookies?  If they're not perfect for your family they easily could be with a little tweaking.  This is the best recipe I've ever used bar none and I'm an old, old Oatmeal cookie fan.  I too added some wheat flour, soaked my raisins, threw in some dates and put some chocolate chips in there just to confuse the kids.  They're wondrous!  I'm going to have to dial back the cloves just a little next time for the kids but they were perfect for me.

I used all butter, and used 1/4tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp allspice.  I also used whole wheat flour for all of the flour.  They were delicious.  The best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had.

These were great!  I used 1 cup butter, 1/2 tsp all spice, added a dash of ginger and nutmeg and soaked the raisins in hot water with a splash of vanilla.  I think they came out a bit small and too soft the next day because I put them in containers too quickly, I'll try keeping them out a bit longer after baking and see how they turn out next time.  But they were delicious!

I'm sorry, I don't usually leave a review for a recipe, not even for one that I LOVE, and especially not for one that I don't like. But I felt I had rate this recipe.  
After much time spent searching this site for the "perfect" oatmeal cookie, I finally chose this one, because it had the highest rating
I followed it to a "t", except that I did not have shortening, so I substituted butter, as per the AllRecipe Substitution chart.
I found these cookies to be dry and biscuit-like.  Kind of like a scone.  
Not was I was expecting, nor is it my idea of a yummy oatmeal cookie

i did like others suggested and doubled the spices.  i soaked the raisins in hot water to make them big, and i added a box of instant vanilla pudding to the mix.  they are the BEST cookies i've ever made.  i loved them, my husband loved them, and my dog loved licking the bowl sans any raisins.

I'm sorry, but my husband and I did not care for these at all, and our favorite cookies are oatmeal raisin. On the advice of others I used all butter, and because I also don't like cloves I substituted nutmeg.  That is all I changed.  We each took one bite and couldn't eat them.  But I gave an extra star because I brought them to work and everyone else seemed to love them.  I gladly handed over my copy of the recipe.  I guess it was just us.  Be careful when baking these.  I burned the first batch because they didn't look done in the middle after 12 minutes.  But after only a couple more minutes in the oven they were completely burned on the bottom.  I cooked the second batch for only 12 min., and even though they still looked too soft in the center, after they set and cooled, they were perfect.  Just didn't taste the greatest for us.  My husband made me promise never to deviate from our tried and true favorite oatmeal raisin recipe again.  Lesson learned.

Delicious, crisp on the outside with chewy innards. I substituted the spices with pumpkin pie spice, the only kind I had on hand. I like my cookies on the chewy side so I baked it for only 8-9 minutes and they turned out to be yummy!

These are fantastic!!  I even replaced all of the flour with whole wheat & no one even noticed.  I also replaced the cloves with nutmeg, and used raw sugar for the white.  I am sure the recipe is wonderful as is, but I was very pleased that the replacement of whole wheat flour produced such a wonderful cookie.  My picky husband even though it was great.  They stay nice & soft for days.  I've made them 3 times already!  YUM!!

Sorry, did not think these were that great.  Mine were slightly dry and crumbly(maybe too much oats?), had to flatten them with a fork or they look like drop biscuits.  We prefer the Oatmeal Peanut Butter Cookies, from Michele, on this website, uses less oats,more baking soda,no spices or raisins(I always throw in chocolate chips!).

Warning... I cut this recipe in half thinking I wouldn't care for the spices. Well I ended up in the kitchen longer than expected because I had to make another batch! If anything, double the recipe. This is the best. Hubby thought they were store bought.

These cookies were very delicious.  My husband and I really liked them, however my son thought they were a little dry.  That's his opinion.  I don't like raisins, so I made half of them with dried cherries, apricots and walnuts  I used all butter and substituted ginger for the clove.

Very, very good.  Used all butter, baked for exactly 9 minutes.  The cookies are chewy and moist and the spice amounts are perfect.  Watch out, they're like potato chips - start with one and soon the whole batch is gone!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good, very moist.  Next time I'll use only 1/4 tsp cloves or I'll substitue ginger as some others have suggested.

Delicious!  Made these twice in a month.  Great chewy texture.  Used allspice in place of cloves and they turned out great.

As good as all the reviews state!  They are really wonderful!  They smell delicious and came out perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly except for soaking the raisins in hot water.  Will definitely be making these over and over again!!!

Fantastic!! I opted to listen to others regarding some changes to the recipe: added one 3.4oz box of Instant Vanilla Pudding and used all butter in lieu of shortening. Also, I did not add any all spice and they were FABULOUS! Word to the wise: if using a silicone baking sheet on top of a metal sheet, you will need to bake for nearly DOUBLE the time.

These are really great cookies and I made them as written with no changes.  The entire family liked them.  I baked a few cookies a little longer to make them crispier.  Half of my family likes their cookies crisp while the other half likes them chewy and soft.  So, you can get the best of both worlds with this recipe.  We did taste a hint of spices which were not overwhelming at all.  I think the spices were just right.  However, next time I make these I will delete the shortening and add applesauce and delete the eggs and double the egg whites to lessen the fat content.

Made no changes and thought they were a bit bland, unfortunately.  Next time will listen to other reviewers :)

Maybe my review was a bit pre-mature as the cookies were much better the next day!!  I am a fresh out of the oven cookie taster :)  I will use all butter next time, though and a bit more spices!

I served these cookies to a group of my husband's friends as they played pool and the pool game became second choice. They are moist, flavourful and easy to make. Never did find out how well they freeze.

These cookies have a great flavour. 
I think I'll put a little less oatmeal in mine next time, so I can have a little more cookie and a little less muesli bar texture.

Yum!!  I omitted all the spices and the raisins, and I replaced them with chocolate chips.  I left them in the oven for 9 minutes to make sure I wouldn't overbake them.  At first, I thought I may have underbaked them, but once they cooled, they were perfect, soft, and delicious!

Quite possibly the softest cookie I've ever eaten.  Very popular with the kids and I had two or three myself (ok maybe 6 or 8)

I didn't have cloves or all spice and will give that a try next time because the cookies did lack that unique spice that I was hoping for.

I'm looking forward to my second attempt.

Amazing cookies! Best ever. Oatmeal raisin is my picky step dad's fave and he asked for the recipe, that is proof that these are the best.  I did use all butter instead of the shortening, but other than that kept them the same!

The thing I don't like about this recipe is that it's very difficult to make healthy. Typically I would use applesauce rather than fat, all egg whites, and honey or agave rather than sugar.  This recipe just doesn't really accommodate those substitutions.  But, if you're looking for all the delicious calories, these cookies work tastily.  DOES need more spice, though (nutmeg, ginger, double cinnamon.)

My husband loves these!  He told me to keep them in the rotation now.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and substituted allspice for the cloves and used all butter.  They baked up perfect for me at 11 minutes.  Two days later and they are still soft.  Thank you!

Ok, even if there are already over 1,500 reviews... what the heck, here's another one. These were SO delicious! I will definitely make these again. I used less cloves only because I don't like too many in a recipe. Next time I will add cinnamon chips. Yum! Thanks, Beth!

Very good recipe! I doubled it. Made half (which was gone in two days) then refrigerated the other half and made "fresh baked" cookies throughout the week. These didn't last long, and everyone loved them!

Excellent!  I have a 2 year old who is allergic to wheat, so I made these with Pamela's Baking Mix instead of flour and we all love them. That says alot since she normally won't touch cookies at all. A great treat to share with the whole family.

Incredible!!!!  I've been making oatmeal raisin cookies for over 15 years and this is the best one ever!  I love it!  I made a little sugar glaze for them and made them iced oatmeal cookies.  Two thumbs way up!

I kept with the 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c shortening. I added a bit more spices (some Cake Spice from Penzey's), but overall I think it needs a little more umph. Something stronger than cinnamon, perhaps. But other than that, these were awesome.

Wow!  These were great.  I didn't have any shortening, so I just used 1 cup of butter, and I didn't have ground cloves so I substituted nutmeg, but they still came out wonderfully.  For the recipe to yield 3 dozen cookies, you'd have to make pretty big cookies - I got 3 dozen "mini" cookies (3/4 inch ball of dough) and 2 1/2 dozen regular sized cookies.  Soft, subtly spicy, beautiful.  Thanks for the recipe!

oh my goodness, these oatmeal cookies are absolutely amazing. I've played around with all sorts of chocolate chips in this recipe, and no matter what kind of chips i use, they always turn out great. Very tasty :)

Ok so this was the perfect "launching pad" for the perfect recipe. I decreased the clove to 1/4 tsp because they just seemed really strong. I just used one cup of real butter instead of using shortening. I decreased the oatmeal by a 1/2 cup because it seemed to make the cookies too heavy and viola! They were the perfect flavor for my taste buds! Excellent stuff, let me tell you!

Huge hit with flatmates and coworkers! I used all margarine instead of the butter/shortening (you cannot tell the difference) and increased the spices.  Delicious and made heaps!

These are very good. I doubled the cinnamon as I really like cinnamon and tried adding the allspice someone mentioned. I couldn't taste the allspice. I do think they need a little more salt and some nuts. They don't last long in my house. I make them often

I baked these cookies this afternoon and they are fantasic - one of best I have ever made.  Crisp on bottom and yet chewy.  I used all butter and added additional 1/2 t cinnanmon and 1/4 t cloves.  Would be great with nuts - didn't have any but will add next time.

These are fantastic, just like from a cookie store!

I made a few changes, I doubled the cinnamon, substituted 1/2 of the white sugar for a 1/4 cup of butterscotch instant pudding mix and added 1 cup of butterscotch chips. I baked them just til the edges were lightly brown, then took them out and let them sit on the sheet for 10 minutes.  Perfectly chewy and addictive!!

These are phenomenal and they definitely hit the spot for something sweet and flavorful. I followed recipe exact with the exception of subbing allspice for the ground cloves.  Baked for 10 minutes and allowed to cool slightly before moving to cooling rack.  No problems with crumbling/falling apart.  Nice and soft and chewy!  I flattened them before baking and they spread slightly, but looked perfect - like I bought them at a bakery!  Thanks for your submission!

I was expecting absolutely fantastic cookies after reading all those rave reviews. When I had them ready I had two friends over. They said that those tasted like my regular oatmeal cookies that I often make, only with a touch of cloves. I was disappointed because they DID taste just like mine. To which my husband said: "Well, you never got your cookies reviewed..." So 5 stars for delicious cookies.

This is BY FAR the BEST Oatmeal Raisin cookie recipe EVER. No need to try the others on the site; I already have. THIS IS IT!!!! I make them weekly! Don't fear using the listed amount of cloves. It's not to strong - it's just perfect! Enjoy!

I made these cookies last year and they were really yummy. But this year when I made them they didn't come out as good. I followed the recipe exactly both times so I don't know what happened. They definitely have potential though!

These were delicious, i must say they are very delicate and need extra attention to remove from the sheet, they are thin cookies. I just baked the next batch on parchment paper, easy to remove no problems with them falling apart.  I did not have cloves so i used nutmeg and it was a great substitution and i used regular crisco and not butter flavored cuz i did not have it.  Next time i will use all butter cuz i like a crispy cookie vs a chewy cookie.  If you like chewy make as is.  Hubby said they were perfect and i agree. thanks.

These cookies were excellent! Like the others the extra spices made the difference.I added 1/4 ginger and nutmeg. I also added an additional 1/2 of cinnamon. My husband likes chocolate chips so I added 1 cup. I also used all butter instead of the shortening.  I used both brown sugar and white Splenda.  Remember to use baking butter instead of the butter with olive oil otherwise your cookies will turn out runny.

Only changes - used vegetable shortening instead of butter flavored and chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Cookies were just OK, didn't love them and probably won't make next Christmas.

Like some of the others, I had a real problem with these getting hard enough to take off the cookie sheet. I ended up adding more flour, increasing the temp 10 degrees, and the time by 2-3 minutes...and I followed the directions to a T. In the end, they were good. But much too much work to get them right and 2 wasted batches before we got there.

I doubled the recipe to make approx. 40 cookies. They were GONE in under 2 days! I added cranberries with the raisins, which turned out well. These cookies are fabulous, they come highly recommended.

I didn't have vanilla extract, so I used almond instead. I also subtracted a half cup of all-purpose flour and substituted in whole wheat flour. Then I added a half teaspoon each of groun allspice and ground ginger. These are awesome!

these are delicious! loved the spices. it keeps getting more moist as it sits though. i prefer a crispier cookie. nevertheless, with it's wonderful flavor, this is easily a five star cookie.

I use a full stick (1 cup) of Butter Flavor Crisco, add in some nutmeg, and those devilish Heath Toffee Bits (one full bag).   These cookies are to die for....

It's a good recipe, and I followed the recipe exactly.  However, it doesn't wow me.  The cookies were also rather inconsistent.  In the same batch, some spread out more than the others.  Nevertheless, it's a good recipe that I will try making again.

These are really good! I replaced the cloves with .5 tsp Allspice and .5 tsp Nutmeg. And I used golden raisins and crasins rather than regular but aside from that followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great! Thanks.

Pretty good.  I made a half batch, and swapped out chocolate chips for the raisins (per my family's preference).  I baked them for 9 minutes and they were all burnt on bottom.  I would suggest baking for 7 minutes and then checking them.

I am more of a chocolate chip person, but these were GREAT - once I figured out what I was doing wrong. 10 min. was about right to get the chewy cookie I was looking for. 12 min made them very crunchy. thank you for the recipe!!

This recipe is almost the same as the one on the oatmeal box except for the fact that you add cloves, and this recipe calls for 1/2 cup more butter/shortening than does the quaker recipe.  The quaker recipe has been my fall back for YEARS and everytime I make it people love it.  Add some coconut to it to make it good.  I always put a little extra vanilla and cinnamon, but try omitting 1/2 c shortening and see if they turn out better (those who has spreading/greasy issues)

Great recipe!  Crispy, yet chewy!  The only thing I had to change was used all butter, no shortening (didn't have any).  Think it's fair to evaluate with only that change.  Yum!

Followed the recipe, they came out beautiful, nice & soft, the way I like them.  But I don't think I like the spice in them.  Next time I'll make them without the spice.  Awesome recipe though!

The first time I made it, it took letting it sit for a minute before I could really enjoy the taste of the cookie. More than likely something I did. The second time I made it I was not as serious about the measurements and it turned out great, overcooked and all :)

Very good. I'm usually a chocolate chip girl but these were great. I didn't use cloves because I didn't have any.Don't think I would have liked it any way. Cookies came out crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. Thanks Beth.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my cookies ended up flat. I tried putting the dough in the fridge for awhile, but it didn't work. I ended up putting all the dough into a square pan and making an "oatmeal cake" which actually was quite delicious! The flavor is great, but they're not quite traditional oatmeal cookies.

These were really good! I used half butter, half applesauce, sweetener instead of white sugar, and half Craisins (since I ran low on raisins). I think I'll add more cinnamon and allspice (I used them instead of cloves) next time b/c my spices are a little old. Great recipe!

These cookies are yummy! I didn't have butter flavoured shortening, so I just used regular shortening. I used butter that had less fat and I reduced the white sugar by a bit. The taste was still nice and sweet, I probably could have reduced the sugar even more. It turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the insdie. The spices make it gingerbread-like. I love oatmeal raisin cookies, and the spices give it a nice kick.

I just made these cookies a minute ago.  I don't like oatmeal raisin cookies, I made them for a friend.  I did taste one though, to make sure they were okay.  It tasted like an oatmeal raisin cookie to me.  :)  But I did notice it was moist and chewy.  My oven tends to overbake, so I only baked them for 6 minutes.  I also didn't have butter shortening, so I just added more butter.  I didn't add cloves to the cookies either.  But I added a bit more cinnamon.  While baking, my kitchen smelled very nice!

These were really delicious. I don't keep shortening in my pantry so I swapped for more butter and it turned out awesome. They smelled so good when they were baking but honestly, the next day, these turned out to be some of the most delicious cookies ever! My husband suggested a little bit more oatmeal the next time around though, we'll try it and see how it goes!

I made this according to the recipe, except substituted chocolate chips for the raisins. I wouldn't recommend doing that! It would probably taste a lot better with raisins to balance out the floury and not-so-sweet taste of the cookie. I think I prefer, overall, the heavier, sweeter recipe on the side of the oatmeal box.

This recipe is tasty, but it doesn't really yield any serious surprises. The recipe is almost identical to the one on the back of the lid of the Quaker oatmeal I used. I also had to take the cookies out after about eight minutes. Next time I bake these I think I'm going to grease the cookie sheet -- they kind of stuck to the pan. Overall - a good recipe, but not the best.

This recipe is perfect exactly the way it is.  I wouldn't be adding stuff or taking anything away.  There's a reason over a thousand people like it.

I've made this cookie 5 times and I have a batch in the oven right now.  I always add more spices: 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/2 tsp allspice.  I also use regular shortening because I don't buy butter flavored.  This cookie is always raved about at work and my family loves them.

Great recipe, but not too far from the standard O.R. cookie recipe.  Tried to make this a bit lower cal. by substitutine 1/2 c. Splenda for the white sugar and used only 3/4 c. Smart Balance margarine for the butter.  Also added 1 T cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg.  Turns out a bit softer but still really good and just a little healtier.

My 4 kids love these cookies.  Our youngest child is allergic to tree nuts and peanuts, so I am always looking for new cookie recipes to try.  These were a huge hit -- the addition of cloves really adds that something special!

I followed this recipe to the letter. They taste very very good. My query is, I use a small ice cream scoop for all my cookies and this time the cookie did not flatten. Has anyone else had this problem and what can I do in the future to prevent this.  EXCELLENT  recipe all the same. Grandkids liked them still in a ball state, they said they were easy to pop in their mouths.

I made these cookies tonight and they were great.  I added more flour, (1/2 c.) because I like my cookies thicker.  I also added pumpkin, coconut, craisins, and ground flax seed to make them healthier.  They tasted great and are excellent base cookie to add lots of other add ins.

These cookies are simply fabulous! I'm not a big fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, but because I was pregnant when I first made this recipe, I had an odd craving for them. Maybe I've just been eating crappy ORC cookies, cause I love these and still make them even though I'm no longer pregnant. The hubby and 15 month old love them too!

These were really good.  Really really good.  The spice was amazing - the cloves were perfect!  I good comfy cookie, if you know what I mean...a little fluffier than I was expecting, so not a "chewy" cookie if that's what you're looking for, but amazing all the same!

These cookies are amazing.  What a great combo of oatmeal, butter and spices.  I did as some others and used only butter, no shortening.  I also doubled the vanilla.  I think next time I may add about 2 tsp flour as they almost fell apart.  Other than that, they are perfect!  Thank you, Beth!  They are the BEST!

i followed the recipe for fifteen,
but i ended up having twenty six.
other than that,
this is fabulous!
i'd add in more cinnamon and cloves next time [:
however, the raisins have a slight metallic taste to it, can somebody tell me why?

This is a great oatmeal raisin cookie recipe!!! I accidently left the last batch cooling overnight, and tried one in the morning and was just as soft and chewy as when came out of the oven! Only things i changed were added 1/2tsp nutmeg and had no butter flavored shortening so just used all butter. Everything came out perfectly!!!

I had a great crunchy Oatmeal Cookie recipe and now I have a great soft chewy one.  I made a ton of these for an event that ended up cancelled due to weather.  I had no problem ridding myself of the load...they actually started tasting healthy after awhile on the long drive home:)  Thanks for the great keeper!

In an attempt to make this recipe more vegan friendly I substited smart balance for butter and used smart balance in the place of crisco as well. I wonder if it was the lack of shortening but these cookies were a massive flop
they fell apart completely and didn't rise. They baked into crumbly pancakes that I had to scrape off of the cookie sheet. On the bright side I saved the crumbles and they made a tasty muffin topping.

This recipe makes the perfect oatmeal  raisin cookies.  I took the advice of adding just a little more cinnamon. I also added chocolate chips for a nice chewy chocolate, raisin oatmeal cookie.

Loved them! My family loved them! My friends loved them! The only change I made was to use all butter instead of 1/2 shortening, and it still turned out well. Maybe a little crisper around the edges, but some people like it better that way. Kudos, Beth, you are the cookie master!

These were fantastic!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening, so used butter instead.  I also used quick oats instead of rolled oats.  I used dried cranberries for a change of pace.  This was my first time making cookies from acratch.  The instructions could not be easier to follow.

Great recipe! The only substitution I made was pumpkin spice in place of cinnamon (because I did not have any) and still turned out mouth-watering delicious. 

Per other's suggestions I only baked for 8-9 minutes so that the cookies stayed chewy, avoiding "puck-cookies". 

Yummalicious : ) Two thumbs up!

the flavor is very good and they are chewy, but I think I messed something up. It is almost like they didn't completely cook. These got better the next day.

Beth, these cookies rock. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe to a 't'; however, I couldn't resist adding chocolate chips. I shared this recipe with my SIL- thanks a lot, I'm going to eat another cookie!

THESE ARE AWESOME COOKIES!!! I loved them, and so did my family. They are very soft, which is new for me, since most of my cookies come out REALLY hard. I HIGHLY reccomend these cookies for people who like oatmeal and raisins!!

They were pretty good, but not as moist as I would have liked.  I also used chocolate chips instead of raisins, but I don't think this would have affected the moistness.

I grind my own grains so the first try they were flat as paper.  This time I added 1/4 c. more of soft whole wheat and it was perfect!  USE OLD FASHION OATS...they give the best "chew" and flavor.  I also tried Allspice instead of clove and truly enjoyed it.  This is my go-to recipe now...great for kids lunches!!

These were okay, but I wouldn't gush about them. I thought the cookies were tasty and spicy, but they were definitely not nearly chewy enough for me. They were dry and crispy on the outside and tender/chewy on the inside but I was definitely looking for something that was a lot more chewy and tender. Also I do not think I would add as much cloves next time. On a side note they were pretty sweet for me, and I don't usually have issues with sweetness. I would add less sugar next time.

These cookies were delish.  I don't like raisins, so only put half cup, I also have convection oven, so had to watch cooking time, but I would definately make them again, mabe next time add chopped walnuts.

These are the best. I made a trio of cookies for the soccer team (for the boys of the family I nanny for), and they were instantly reduced to crumbs after the game. I used butter-flavor Crisco for these.
I thought these were just great. They smell wonderful as they are baking. And they are just the right texture. A winner!

These cookies are amazing... even if you don't have the right ingredients. I didn't have white sugar so I substituted with more brown sugar and some honey and they turned out great. I got asked for the recipe many times... Thanks  Beth!

I really enjoyed this oatmeal raisin cookie recipe.  I wish you could tase more of the spices but others told me it was the right amount.  I think next time I might try adding some chocolate chips in it for another kick.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! I made a half-batch, used ½ cup margarine instead of butter and shortening, used 1/4 cup of cartoned fat-free egg substitute in place of the egg, and two snack-size boxes of raisins. Oh, and I cut the cinnamon down to about half as both my husband and daughter are allergic. It made about 20 cookies for me and they took about 14 minutes to bake. My daughter is loving them. Thanks, Beth, for a great recipe! I think I'll add some white chocolate chips and maybe some walnuts next time. :)

these cookies smell & taste delicious! the only modifications i made were in substituting 1/2 c. of the all~purpose flour with whole wheat flour & soaking my raisins ahead of time so they'd stay plump. i also used old fashioned oats (the only way to go). thanks again beth, i made your snickerdoodles a while back & will try your orange cookies in the future!

I made these for my husbands hunting trip.  The wonderful smells and the delicious taste were a winner with the whole family.  I only saved 2 for me and the kids each and sent the rest on with him.  I have to make more!!  I love the ground cloves, it just added deliciously to the cookie.

ADDICTING!!!!!  Made this recipe for the first time and made them bite size.  After trying 1, I ended up eating 10 in one sitting.  My husband who doesn't like sweets raved about these.  Needless to say, my cookie jar was empty in 1 day.  Starting another batch.  When I get compliments from chefs about a cookie, I have to pass it on to the real owner of the recipe.  Compliments to you - great recipe!!!!!!!!

I changed quite a bit about the recipe (used applesauce, changed out half the raisins for a mix of dried berries, etc) but they came out wonderful. I doubled the recipe and froze the others, thank you!

I made these for my son and daughter to take to school for their teachers. I don't even like oatmeal cookies and I have to say I am hooked. They have the greatest taste and aroma. You can't loose with these. Needless to say their teachers were very pleased with them as well.

EXCELLENT!  I don't have time to write much, but I made these last week and they were excellent.  I just followed the recipe - no changes.  My husband who is very picky loved these as well, and I am fixing to make more right now.  Highly recommended.  I'm not even going to look for another recipe!!!  Oh, I did cook them for the full 12 minutes and they turned out great!

You can't go wrong with cinnamon and cloves! These are incredible! The smell alone that fills the house as they bake is advertisement enough on how great these cookies are! The only thing different I did was to use cold butter (makes the cookies fluffier according to Alton Brown) and leave out the raisins (hubby's request).

This is a very tasty recipe and makes the kitchen smell great! I substituted choc chips for raisins. Also, I got 5 dozen cookies out of it (not 3). I just wish that the cookies were chewier, that would have been 5 stars.

Fantastic!!  I love these cookies.  This is the recipe I have been waiting for.  I changed it just a little bit according to other reviewers suggestions.  I used 1 cup butter and omitted the butter shortening.  I melted the butter halfway.  I did decide to use the cloves and added some nutmeg as well.  I also used golden raisins the first time and big juicy organic raisins the second time...wonderful!  My husband loves them and by the end of the night almost half were gone.  These make about 50 cookies.  Our favorite cookies are oatmeal raisin so I think this will be a weekly thing.

These were really good, although I'm not crazy about the taste of clove, so I subbed nutmeg.  Instead of large cookies, I used a melon baller as a measuring scoop to make little 'cookie bites' - baking just 6 min for this size - sooo cute and gone within a day!

These were very good.  I probably should've melted the butter to make them chewier, but they were excellent!

These were pretty good. The cloves were a nice twist, I doubled the amount. A bit flat, and too sweet - cut sugar by at least 1/3 cup. Makes 60+ cookies.

Very good and easy to make.  Next time I will add 1/2 cup more raisins. Even better the second day - you really notice the spice.

I liked this recipe. I substituted another stick of butter for the butter-flavored shortening, and took out half a cup of the rolled oats and substituted a half cup of steel-cut oats instead.  I made them a little bigger than the recipe stated (about 1.5 inch diameter ball before baking) and baked them 15 minutes.  They came out very soft with a very nice texture on the outside and just a bit of crunch due to the steel-cut oats.  I will definitely make these again, but I may cut down on the sugar next time and use only 1.5 sticks of butter.

These were great...can't just eat one. I make them once aweek now, they are so easy. I did use buttermilk, and added nuts. I tried using the new chocolate/caramel chips, didn't turn out so good.  This is my new favorite oatmeal cookie!!  THANKS ALOT!!!

Phenomenal!!  These are so soft and chewy.  I made them one evening and had them for breakfast and lunch the next day.  My 2 year old loved them and I didnt feel too bad giving them to him because they have less sugar and more oats than most recipes.

This cookie needs more stars than 5!  I make them bite sized and they get vacuumed up every time.  Delish!  Thanks to much for the great recipe and keep 'em coming.  

BTW, when gift giving, I pair these with Beth's Snickerdoodles - they compliment each other perfectly.

This cookie is spiced just right.  It is moist and very tasty.  I did use all butter as did some other reviewers and this did not seem to affect the baking time or consistency at all. Wonderful cookie.  Will definitely make these again!

I have never made homemade cookies that were good...but saw this recipe and my 5 year old and I tried them out on Santa. They were fantastic!  I followed other advice and used 1 cup butter, instead of half butter, half shortening.  It tasted very "clovey" just out of the oven, but the next day it wasn't noticeable at all. Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

Holy Cow these cookies went first. I couldn't believe it. I have made about 10 different cookies and these were the first to go. They are so great with the spices. Just started a Christmas Cookie traditon. Thanks.

this is the first oatmeal cookie recipe i have ever made, and i actually have never even eaten an oatmeal cookie before so i have nothing to compare these to, but i LOVE them.  i left out the raisins since im not a fan and just used a full cup of butter, however these were delicious and i had great reviews. the first time i made them though it turned into a soup basically but i think i just used too much batter on the baking pan, but the second time it was fine. they were a little bit greasy though but the taste was great.

If only all my cookie recipes came out as well as this one...!  Wow!  And I don't even care for raisins.  Hey, I don't even like the smell of cloves.  But in this recipe, they are perfect.  Beth, you have really scored a hit with this recipe.  The cookies keep their excellent texture and fragrance even the next day...if they last that long.  I'm adding this to my collection of hit recipes.  Many thanks!

I made these cookies and took some to church to share. Now I have orders for more! They were moist, had a great taste, not bland, not too spicy. This recipe is definately going into my "keep forever" folder!! Like she said, make sure you don't overbake then and give them time to cool on the cookie sheet so they'll hold together!!

This  cookie came out looking like professional bakers style. Perfect shape and appearance. The taste is superior to any other oatmeal raisin I've ever eaten. Perfectlyl chewy.I used half bread flour and half whole wheat. I thought it may make them less cakey textured. I also added more spices. For the white sugar I used splenda.  Thanks for experimenting Beth, and then passing it on to the rest of us.

Really great and chewy!  The first time I made this I substituted the shortening for butter (just used 1 cup of butter).  The second time I made the same substitution and I substituted chocolate chips for raisins, per my husband's request.  Great with my morning coffee!

Excellent!  Of course, I have not met TOO many oatmeal cookies I did not like, but these were moist, chewy and did not last very long at our house!  I almost always make my cookies with the higher amount of brown sugar instead of white, as listed here.  It makes them richer and tasty!  Thanks for submitting this one!

These were excellent.  They looked beautiful, the texture was perfect and the flavor was wonderful.  I did notice that they tasted even better the next day.  I felt they could have been just a bit "spicier" for my taste, however.  The second time I made them I used an extra 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. This second batch was more to my liking.  All in all, these were delicious cookies that were very well received by everyone I shared them with.  Be sure to make plenty of them, though, because they will go very fast!

if you are looking for a really chewy cookie, try finding another recipe, this cookie was to cake-like for me, although it was very soft, and the taste was excellent, will try working on the texture, will probably make again

These are hands-down the best oatmeal cookies I have not only ever made, but ever tasted! These are a must try. I didn't have the cloves, but they were still packed full of flavor. So chewy and yummy. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These were pretty good.  I liked that they didn't spread a lot, which is what the other recipes I have tried do.  If you want something fantastic, use butterscotch chips and pecans instead of raisins!  I love oatmeal scotchies.  I also substituted half of the white sugar with splenda.

These cookies are very yummy. I upped the spices quite a bit, and put a sticky spicey glaze on top, and they were delicious. A little cakey perhaps, and not very crunchy - but then they weren't supposed to be so you can forgive that! Will make again.

These cookies were very good.  I used regular flavored shortening and dark brown sugar because that's all I had in the cupboard and they still turned out well.  Yummy!

These turned out so great! They will be my main oatmeal cookie recipe from now on. Moist and chewy..full of oats which I love. I used sultanas(a lighter type of raisin) instead and found them to be so good. I really did love these even though I'm not really in to clove. My husband really liked them too. It will make your kitchen smell so good. A quick easy recipe and a true keeper!!!

Awesome cookies. I was out of shortening so I substituted butter, I also added a dash of nutmeg (just because) and doubled the vanilla because I REALLY like vanilla.  I loved these cookies, they turned out great.

What a great cookie! I think I should have baked them even a bit less...when they were done cooling, they were set a bit crisper than what I would have preferred. (the centers were still chewy) So when you're making these, don't be afraid to take them out of the oven when they still appear to be somewhat underdone.

I've never been much of a fan of oatmeal cookies, but these might just change my mind!  I used all butter and substituted dried cranberries for raisins.  I found that rotating the cookie sheet halfway during baking time resulted in more evenly browned cookies.  I also discovered that a couple extra minutes resulted in a crisp cookie, perfect for dunking!  I was able to get 7 dozen cookies out of the recipe as is, using a 1-teaspoon cookie scoop, so I'm not sure what Beth was using.  Thanks for the post!

Yum!  These were hands down the best oatmeal raisin cookies that I have ever tried.  I used all butter instead of shortening, and they came out great.  It makes a large batch of cookies, but they'll be eaten so quickly that they won't last long!

Excellent recipe.  Made it at work and people that did not like raisins loved the cookie.  People asked if I boiled the raisins because they were so plump (No I did not boil the raisins).  Made it according to the recipe and will put in my cookie recipe collection.  Thanks Beth for a great recipe.

These are delicious!  I used regular shortening rather than butter flavored because I find the butter flavored stuff sometimes makes the product taste artificially buttery.  But they did come out nice and chewy, where most recipes will make either a crunchy or soft cookie.

Wow, even my picky boyfriend liked these cookies.  They are indeed chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside--totally worth buying the ground cloves for!  The only different thing I did was use 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup of extra butter due to having no butter flavored shortening.  They tasted just fine without refrigeration and baked in 9 minutes.

I thought these cookes were great! I used 1 cup of Crisco
butter flavored shortening, cut the white sugar to  1/4 ,
did not add cloves, I added 1/2 teaspoon of Pumpkin Spice,
cut the salt out and used Baking Raisens which are real
moist. I will definately make this cookie again, my husband
loved them too!

This is the best recipe I've ever found for oatmeal raisin cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect...every batch.  The cloves are a wonderful addition and gives them that extra oomph!  They are soft and chewy and my whole family loves them.  They sure don't last long in our house!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very yummy! I cut the white sugar completely, replacing it with some more oats, and these were still plenty sweet enough for me. Also omitted the vanilla extract and salt, as always. Nice and soft whilst warm, and gain a crunchier edge as they cool - if you don't eat them first that is!

Not very soft and chewy... but has pretty good flavor.  True enough, the spices aren't overpowering or anything.  Another great addition to a bowl/glass of milk :o)

The PERFECT oatmeal raisin cookie! I've tried different recipes, including the Quaker Oatmeal recipe, but this is by far the best! The trick to this cookie is to get the cookies out of the oven as soon as they're done. That way they will stay chewy even after they've cooled. If you wait too long to get them out they will be really crisp after they've cooled.

These were very good. I did take the suggestion of another review and went a little heavy on the spices. I also had my raisins soaking in spiced rum since Wednesday! Very Yummy!
This is a keeper!

Oh my goodness! I just took a batch out of the oven and tried one. These are phenomenal! I used all shortening just because I didn't have any butter. I'll make these over and over! I am making them for my dad so that I can suprise him when he comes home from a trip. He'll be home any minute and I can't wait till he tries these! THANK YOU BETH!

This is a really good oatmeal raisin cookie.  I didn't have any baking soda, so used baking powder instead and ended up with a nice puffy cookie.  I'll probably always make them this way, as they were excellent.  My cousin and her husband really liked them as well, and I sent a container of them home with them.

Excellent, with 2 changes.  All butter, no shortening.  I also round the cup of sugar, and the cinnamon and cloves.

Extremely tasty! My boyfriend ate them all in a couple of days. I left out the raisins just by preference, and had to use all butter because had no shortening. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly. Cookies tasted awesome and stayed chewy. They spread a lot and were very soft, but I expect that is because of the all-butter thing.  I will try chilling the dough next time to see if I can get a bit more body, but these are definitely keepers!

I am just begin to learn how to bake and cook and decided to make cookies to give to my friends for christmas.  I tried this recipe and got tons of complements. I followed the recipe and instructions exactly.  I only added nutmeg and more raisins.  Plus, I made sure to take the cookies when the still looked a bit underdone.  Once they cooled completely, they were perfect.

These would be delicious even without the chocolate chips.  Added the cinnamon as suggested and cooked for about 13 minutes.

Another awesome cookie from Beth Sigworth! My house smelled wonderful while making these. Although I didn't have any ground cloves around so I used a little more cinnamon and about a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg they were still perfect. I baked them for 12 minutes and they were still chewy when they cooled! If you like these, try Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles!! Thanks for another great recipe!

Based on all the 5 star  reviews, I expected too much.  The cookies had a nice flavor, but I went wrong somewhere. They were flat and too moist. They stuck to each oter when I put them in the container and broke apart. I am going to try them again..must have 
made a mistake somewhere!!

These cookies came out awesome! I let the dough sit for an hour and it wasn't long enough. I then let it sit for 2 days and they baked awesome. Everyone enjoyed them, and I'm sure this will be a holiday staple.

The best oatmeal cookies ever!!!  Texture was perfect.  Substituted chocolate chips and walnuts for the raisins (I'm not an oatmeal raisin fan)...everyone loved it.  Making bigger cookies will yield chewier, more satisfying cookies.  The smaller crunchy ones were perfectly crunchy, though.  Add in a little bit of nutmeg for an extra subtle kick your tongue will pick up and thoroughly appreciate.

A nice, moist cookie... although I like my oatmeal cookies a little crisper in texture.  Still, very nicely spiced.  A good cookie.

These cookies smell heavenly when they're cooking! I did add a touch of nutmeg as well. I'm not personally a big fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, but the people that ate them really loved them! I would note that these cookies were quite crispy rather than chewy, however. Still delicious, though! I also followed some other reviewers' suggestions and chilled the dough (while making some other cookies). The cookies still turned out kind of flat, but I don't really expect oatmeal raisin cookies to be big and fluffy either. I think they were fine!

Great cookies!! I didn't have any shortening, so I used all butter. Didn't have any cloves, so I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. They were soft, yet kind of dry. Maybe I will take them out a few minutes early next time.

Delicious!  I hate raisins, so I substituted a cup of pecans in for them.  They do flatten out, so if you're looking for the chunky fluffy oatmeal cookies, these are not for you.  The spices really make the difference.  I added a bit(1/4-1/2 of a teaspoon?) of allspice and nutmeg and it was quite yummy!

Fabulous!  My son, who doesn't like oatmeal cookies, loved these.  Don't leave out the cloves... it's what makes these different from the run of the mill oatmeal cookie.  I didn't have any butter flavored shortening, so used an extra 1/4 c. butter and reduced the shortening by 1/4 c.  This has now replaced the oatmeal cookie recipe that I've been using for years.

These were so good and made the house smell wonderful while baking.  I followed the directions exactly and baked for 9 minutes.  They came out so soft and the next day they were just as soft.  My husband has decided this is now his favorite cookie of all time....Thanks Beth

The cookies turned out nicely, but I felt they were missing something.  I baked on parchment paper and refrigerated the dough before hand so they didn't flatten out.  The flavor is nice but a bit too boring - next time I will increase the spices or add-ins like nuts, different types of raisins, etc.  Otherwise, very good cookie.

This were good!  The first time I made them I didn't have ground cloves so I substituted allspice, but the cookie felt like they were missing something.  Next time I used my coffee grinder (make sure you clean it out good!) to grind up whole cloves into ground and it DID make a difference! These are a chewy cookie.  I would definitely make them again.

Another great cookie recipe from Beth!!  I'm not a big fan of cloves, so I reduced the amount to 1/4 tsp. and also added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  The trick is to not overbake the cookies and they will stay moist.

I hate rasins, so I substituted dried cranberries, and added a pinch of fresh ground nutmeg. This recipe was delicious! Leaves a nice, spicy scent all over the house. I'm a college student with NINE roommates. (Makes rent and utilities cheap) Anyway, all of them poked their heads in to find out what the smell was. These cookies didn't last long! It will become a common recipe in this house.

Excellent even with substitutions!  I didn't realize that I was a cup short on oats & didn't have any raisins.  So I used a cup of crushed Kashi Go Lean Crunch cereal & Craisins.  They turned out perfectly.

Somewhat disappointed. They tasted great (do not leave out the cloves it makes all the difference!) however, they baked into little flat pancakes... which are not appealing to look at. I let the dough cool in the fridge for a couple of hours and yet it didn't seem to help... my advise it to add something that helps the cookies rise.

This was a great recipe! The cookies were wonderful warm. I added chopped walnuts and left out some of the clove because I was baking for finicky children's tastes. Was a big hit with all, and were gone within the day!

This is an excellent cookie!  I altered it a bit when I made it, adding more vanilla and cinnamon, about a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg and some toasted nuts, but the taste and texture were very good.

This was an excellent recipe! Normally, I don't care too much for oatmeal cookies, but these have the best flavor ever.  For a little extra pizzaz and sweetness, I mixed 1 cup powdered sugar with 1 tablespoon of milk to make a glaze, which I drizzled over the cookies.  Thanks Beth!

I love this recipe.  These cookies were so good the first time around, chewy and endowed with super oatmealy raisin flavor.  Not too sweet either, they smelled so delicious straight out of the oven.  The second time?  I followed the recipe straight off the page.  Not enough flavor.  It took me a while to realize what I'd done right the first time.  I'd squished the dough down flat, covered it in sarran wrap, left it out for a night without refrigeration, then baked it the next morning.  Mostly unintentional, of course, but I guess they need time to soak in their own juices.  So plan ahead.

I love these cookies- love the spice flavor that the cloves add.  My husband thinks they are a 4 because his dad makes the "perfect" oatmeal raisin cookie but his dad doesn't use the internet and we can't get the recipe from him to post it here.  Personally, I think they were excellent.

I have made these several times and always get rave reviews.  I think the ground cloves make the cookie, so I add almost a full teaspoon.  I have also made them with craisins, chopped dried fruit, or whatever I have on-hand and they always turn out great!

WOW! These were awesome. My husband has been craving oatmeal raisin cookies for awhile now. I thought I would try these and boy am I glad I did. I can't believe how chewy they were! Perfect! I did change up a few things. Like others I didn't use the shortening I just used two sticks of butter.  I  also didn't have the cloves in the pantry, so I tried pumpkin pie spice which has cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. What a great taste  it gave the cookies. I also split the batch and made some of the cookies with chocolate chips too. The kids loved that. These cookies were gobbled up by my husband and kids. These are definitely a staple in our home now. Thanks Beth!!

I just tried this recipe and it's da bomb! I have tried another oatmeal raisin cookie recipe, but this one is far superior. I used all butter instead of 1/2 shortening, and added nutmeg to the recipe. The cloves are a definite highlight, don't leave them out! I added about 1/2 cup extra raisins too to make it juicier. Very good consistency, and they are much better than the bakery kind! Thanks for sharing such a superb cookie recipe!

Used twice the butter and no shortening and nutmeg instead of cloves.  Still makes the best oatmeal-raisin cookie I've ever eaten.

EASY to make - and wonderful.  I added cranberries (dried - Craisins (regular flavor)), walnuts, and Chocolate Chips - and I used the new (to me at least) cinnamon coated rasins - and these were A HUGE HIT at my office and with friends and family.  I would highly suggest others try this recipe -- it is easy and I have not baked anything in 15 years but wanted to try to do something nice for the office mates -- you will not be sorry if you make this recipe!

Be warned!  These soft and chewy oatmeal raisin cookies are addictive.  They are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever baked and tasted.  It's doubtful anyone will ever find a better recipe.  Thanks Beth!  Job well done!

Fantastic cookies - my crew loved them.  Oatmeal Raisin is my husbands favorite - The first batch never got a chance to come off the cooling rack.  Luckily I doubled the recipe and managed to share a few with my neighbors.  They got rave reviews from every one.  I'll be making these again soon.  Thanks so much for a great recipe Beth - this one goes in with the keepers.

These are excellent cookies. Almost identical to the recipe listed on the Quaker Oats box, these just have cloves and use butter flavored shortening. However, it's an excellent recipe and the additional ingredients really add some flavor! I didn't have to change a thing.

Cookies were great but i substituted margarine for the shortening and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon to make up for the cloves! I would recommend dropping them in tablespoon fulls and flattening them a bit first before putting in the oven or else they end up kindy puffy and dinky!!

These are absolutely excellent!!!  I cut the cloves to 1/4 tsp and didn't have raisins so added about 1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips.  Made these for a camping trip and they were gone in a flash.

These cookies were good, but somewhat thin. They are chewy and were flavorful. My son despises raisins, so I put chocolate chips instead. I also, didn't have butter flavored shortening, but they were still very tasty. I will use this recipe again!

These are definitely 5 star cookies!  First of all they are so easy to prepare and the outcome is amazing.  I wasn't too sure how these were going to go over with my family because they are big chocolate chip fans, but they absolutely loved them! I highly recommend these cookies.  Thanks Beth for sharing.

I didn't have cloves, but I added a pinch of nutmeg and a few extra dashes of cinnamon - very good!  I also cut down the oats to 2 1/2 C, but added an extra handful of raisins.  I dropped by TABLESPOONS, not teaspoons like the recipe says, and baked for 11 minutes - perfect.  Next time I will add more brown sugar, maybe some dark this time.

I was trying to make an oatmeal raisin cookie like my mother's, so I experimented a little bit and substituted nutmeg for cloves, used 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, added 1/4 tsp. ginger, only used 2 1/2 cups of rolled oats and used golden raisins and these cookies were delicious.

love these cookies.  They baked up so fluffy and nice.  We baked half of them and froze the other half (cookie dough balls).

This is really a great cookie. I used what I had in the kitchen, regular crisco instead of butter flavor and I was out of raisins. I did add walnuts. I can't wait to try it with raisins. Thanks Beth.

Awesome! I used Crisco shortening because I didn't have butter flavored, and it didn't seem to matter. Also tossed in 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger and an extra 1/2 cup of raisins. Delicious!

Excellent cookies!  Stayed soft for several days.  I added chocolate chips to half of the batter and raisins to the other half.  They were a hit!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Substituted Country Crock for butter & shortening.  Ommitted cloves.  Ommitted raisins.  Added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  These are the first cookies I've ever tried to make and they came out very tasty.  This is what I picture when I think of oatmeal cookies.

These are AWESOME!  I used allspice instead of the cloves and coconut instead of raisins with the same equivalents and they were great even better the next day.  The texture was moist - just the way I like them.  Thank you Beth!!!

Yummy cookies, I used substituted butter instead of shortening, as I wasn't sure what sort of shortening to use, and they tasted great and had a great texture - nice and moist.

Very delicious...I do like my cookies a little crispier on the outside and soft in the middle, but the overall flavor of this cookie is great.  I wonder if I could increase the baking time to produce a crisy/chewy cookie.  Or perhaps play with the recipe...any suggestions?

This cookie is unbelievably good -- the perfect chewy texture, the spices...Also nice and buttery, but not "greasy" at all.  I poured boiling water over the raisins and let them stand for an hour before draining them and putting them in the recipe -- it made the raisins plump and juicy even after baked.  Yum.

The cookie was great!  I've been searching forever for an oatmeal cookie recipe...I substituted with cranberries (don't like raisins) and allspice (didn't have cloves).  I got many compliments one said "I don't like oatmeal cookies, but I like these!".  Thank you for sharing Beth!

I made them at Christmastime and they were the hit of the office!  It's February and my co-workers are still asking me to make more.  Great job Beth!

I love these cookies they remind me of times in the winter on the farm when we would come in from skateing on the nearby pond and my mom would have cookies right out of the oven waiting by the wood stove with tall glasses of ice cold milk to wash them down. A great recipe!

Search No More!!!  This is absolutely the best oatmeal cookie recipe you will ever find.  I've been baking for 20 years and this is one of the best cookie recipes I've ever made.  I always get rave reviews.  They're  moist and chewy.  Be very careful not to overbake them.

I have always made the best oatmeal cookies in my family, at least that's what they say, and these are even better than the ones I have made for years!  They don't taste as good after a couple of days so I make a whole batch of dough and cook 1/2 one day and the other half a few days later.  Keep the raw dough in an airtight container in the fridge.  It is so nice to just heat the oven and 10 minutes later you have fresh cookies!  Try this recipe!!!

I made these cookies for Christmas and I've been making them ever since. My mom doesn't like cloves so instead I used allspice. The cookies were still delicious. I also added walnuts and left out the raisins just to see how that would taste. This recipe is a keeper. I'm going to hand this one down to my children. They really are irresistable. Thank you Beth!!!!

Despite all the great reviews, I was skeptical. This recipe is exactly the same as one provided on the Quaker Oats box, with the exception of the cloves, and splitting the margarine (Quaker) into 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening (Beth's recipe). I'm glad I forged ahead with this anyway! This IS the best recipe! The Quaker Oats one has always turned out flat and crispy--none of the yummy, rich, chewiness you get from Beth's recipe. My husband has already told me to get rid of all of the other oatmeal cookie recipes I've tried over the years. Try this one if you haven't already! It's worth it!

Beth, you are a Cookie Goddess.  I just figured out you are the one who also brought us Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles.  What I wouldn't give to be in a Cookie Exchange with you!  Thank you for the perfect Oatmeal Raisin Cookie recipe.  My old one has been officially retired. You go girl!!!

My girlfriend insisted that I not try cloves and I succumbed.  Next time I will try them as many reviews talked about the importance of the "clove effect."  I had to rotate my pan because my oven bakes a bit unevenly ( the back row of cookies was always darker).  Also, 9 minutes was plenty of time for my batch. I loved them in spite of the advice from the clove grinch:)

I have made this recipe several times, and it is always wonderful!!  So tasty and soft!  I just finished making a batch...I messed up and put in too much ground cloves....it's still great!

Beth definitely has a winner with this one.  This is the only oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I use!

This is the best oatmeal cookie I've ever had!  My son and husband gobbled them up and are begging for me to make more! I am seriously throwing out all other oatmeal cookie recipes.  Some things I did differently....I didn't have light brown sugar so I used golden brown and 1/4 cup less in case it was sweeter. I didn't have butter flavored shortening and used regular -- and with those modifications.....they were divine!

These came out softer than any other oatmeal cookies I have ever made before. I goofed and put 1 tsp of clove instead of 1/2 tsp. but they were still great! (I love clove tho.)

I had to use 1 cup margarine instead of the butter and shortening and they were still great!  I also only used 1/4 teasp. of the cloves.  These were the only oatmeal raisin cookies I made that didn't spread like a pancake when baked!!!!  This one's a keeper!!

These are very very good. I love the spicy flavor. These outdo any oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever had before- and I love oatmeal raisin cookies! I would cook 12 minutes. I also used baking raisins- they  are plumper and juicier. I may even soak them next time. WONDERFUL!!!!!!!

These are the Oatmeal cookies my gramma used to make!!! I think they are fantastic.  I can't believe the difference a little cinnamon and clove makes!

I have always liked oatmeal cookies, but have never found a good recipe.  These were really good.  They were a little on the sweet side but I did not mind.  They were easy to make and the whole family loved them.

Thanks for the fabulous recipe, Beth!  My fiance and his friend started gobbling these up as soon as they came out of the oven.  Everyone LOVED them...best oatmeal raisin cookies that I have ever had, and oatmeal raisin are my favorite.  I found that the basic recipe yielded a small excess of 4 dozen instead of 3 as the recipe states.  Just an added bonus...now my coworkers will get to taste these too!!!  Thanks again!

Our family favorite has always been oatmeal raisin.  I have used Betty Crocker's Old Fashioned Oatmeal Cookie recipe for years, always thought it was the best and very moist.  It just didn't ship well because of that.  These are perfect,great taste, solid for shipping and chewy inside!  I did add walnuts but was extremly pleased with your recipe.  Thank you.

I just finished baking a batch of these great cookies!  I changed a couple of things...added all butter & extra cinnamon & a little nutmeg, too. If you bake them right about 12 minutes, they come out nice & chewy! Thanks for sharing this recipe Beth.

I am new at baking cookies, so bear with my silly questions:
1.  I followed the direction exactly, but my cookies was not chewy.  They are dry.
2.  It took me about 25-30 min. to bake the cookies at 350F, using middle shelf.  I kept open the door to check if the cookies are ready after 15 min.  They were definitely not ready at 15 min.
3.  My cookies did not turn out to be very round.  
Any advise is greatly appreciated.

The spices add quite a tang to the cookie, which I really liked!  The cookie also held a very good shape, almost as if I had bought it from a store.  I bought generic raisins that were a little dry, so I soaked them in hot water as I mixed everything else to plump them up a bit.

These were really great!  Mine didn't come out chewy, but not hard either - a nice in the middle texture and taste. LOVE the taste of them, will definately make these again!
They received great praise from the group I served them too, and the raisins were all gone from the bottom of the tupperware container too (they polished them off that good).

Loved the cookies! I tested this recipes so that for my next cook date at a clients house I would leave the children a treat of their favorite cookies. My family loved them and so did my next door neighbors, so much that I made a second batch to bring to my client but my neigbhor bought them from me to bring to a friends house. I guess I have to make them again & again & again

I printed this one because of all the good reviews I read about it.  They aren't kidding!!  Wonderfully moist and good flavor.  I didn't prepare this one myself, I gave it to my 10 and 7 year old daughters to make ... then I went to do some other chores.  They had no trouble at all.  Great cookie!!

These were excellent.  They're very easy and quick to make, and they really do make the kitchen smell great while they're baking.  We like soft, chewy cookies, and these are.  I didn't have any butter-flavored shortening and used regular, but they are still great.

These cookies are excellent! Perfect to pack in a school lunch or for an Autumn picnic. When I made them they were chewy in the center, and crispy on the edges. A perfect 10! When I let my mother taste one, she exclaimed "Wow!". If you want a great cookie, make these!

What a wonderful cookie for those cold dreary days! The kitchen creates such a wonderful 
aroma while these cookies bake. They are also great with a tall glass of ice cold lemonade on those very warm days as well. YUM! YUM!

I Love this recipe!  They are indeed addicting.  Once again I didn't have butter flavored shortening, but this time I remembered I had butter flavoring in the spice cabinet, and mixed it with the crisco.  It really did add something to it.  YUM!

These cookies were fantastic. I made them for my dad's birthday. They were a definite hit with my husband. I will be making these several times in the future. I might try them with chocolate chips instead of raisins or maybe both. You could also try adding dried cherries.

I loved these cookies!  They were easy to make, smelled wonderful, and tasted heavenly!  The spices are just the right things for these and they are moist and chewy, always a good thing in a cookie.
My husband is a big oatmeal raisin cookie fan and I tried several recipes before finally hitting on one he really couldn't keep his hands off of!

I add a bag of Nestle chocolate chip chunks to this recipe - it is a perfect blend of chocolate chip cookie and oatmeal raisin, especially if you have guests that don't really like oatmeal raisin (they will love it like this)!

These didn't turn out as delicious as the recipe on the oatmeal box.  It may have been the way I cooked them but these cookies turned out pretty dry.  Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles are to die for and these just didn't measure up as well.

WE loved the taste and chewiness of these cookies.  They were very flat though.  I am thinking that I might try them as bar cookies next time.  We can't stop eating them though.  So even though they are flat we will  make them again.

Another wonderful cookie recipe, Beth!  These are soooo addicting and loved by all.  I halved the quantity of cloves since it's not my favorite spice and it was just right for my taste.  I might experiment with allspice too.  We all hope you're still experimenting and almost ready to share more of your great cookie recipes.

WOW!  What a wonderful cookie!  All my other oatmeal raisin cookies get dry and crumbly after a day, but not these.  My husband LOVES these cookies and they will be on my list for Potluck Dinners and Gifts!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This spiced-up oatmeal raisin recipe gets my vote for the best . For a bit more zing, add 1/4 tsp of ginger.

These are the BEST oatmeal cookies I've ever made!  I didn't have time to make cookies so I spread the batter in a jelly roll sheet and made bars.  They were excellent--I take them hiking with me!

Very good cookie. The only difference between this recipe and the Quaker Oats one is the addition of ground cloves. I thought it tasted familiar!

The yummiest oatmeal raisin cookies I've had in a long time! Want to make them yummier? Grind the cinnamon and cloves (especially the cloves) FRESH just before you mix them in... you can smell them baking from across the street! yummy yummy yummy!

I made these for some chefs as a Thank You - that shows how much they were liked!
I used regular shortening and refridgerated the dough before dropping them on the sheet pan.
Worked wonderfully!  All cookies were gone in less than two days!  Thanks!
