If I were to rate on flavor alone I would rate it a 5.  If you are going to use this recipe you really need to pay attention to them because they can easily overbake.  The recipe says to take them out when the edges turn a light brown, but in my experience the edges never changed color.  I was afraid I was going to underbake them so I kept waiting for them to change and they didn't.  I finally took them out and the overbaked product was crumbly.  With the next batch I just took them out at 9 minutes and they turned out great.  So watch your time, not the edges!

these cookies are awesome. I did alter them a bit though.  First, I added 3/4 cup peanutbutter (instead of 1/2).  I used 1/2 cup honey in the place of sugar like someone else recommended.  Plus I also replaced 3/4 cup of flour with oats.   The result was really soft and peanutbuttery cookies. I took them to a party and someone said "Hope your are not expecting to leave with any of these"

The cookies were good but definately needed more peanut butter in them.  First off, I hate it when people rate the recipe based off of their version!!  Please do not rate recipes unless you have tried them exactly as written.  Otherwise post your own recipe with the changes you thought were better.  It's very annoying to look through recipes and find a million different versions and rated randomly.  I want to know what people thought of this particular recipe...not yours!!!

YUMMY! These came out great.  I followed other people's suggestions and did the following:

Used 3/4 cup oats in place of 3/4 cup flour.
Used both wheat and white flour.
1/4 cup honey to substitute the brown sugar.
Pressed fork crisscross into cookies 7 minute into baking.  Let bake 2 minutes more after that.

The cookie dough is much runnier than regular pbutter cookie dough, but don't worry!  It is supposed to be that way.  Because of this you really cannot "roll" them.  You just have to place them by rounded teaspoons onto the pan.  

Aside from what I wrote above, I followed the recipe.  I know someone else mentioned that they used butter, but I used margarine (SmartBalance) and it worked fine.

Thank you for this recipe! They are soft and delicious.

I made the cookies exactly as written, and agree with the others that they need more peanut butter.  I think 3/4 cup peanut butter would be about right.  Cooked them for 8 minutes and took them out of the oven.  Allowed them to sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes to set, then moved them to a cooling rack. After cooling, they are crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  They do seem like they could become crunchy cookies in a day or so though.

The recipe is just what I needed for the famous "peanut butter hershey kiss" cookies.  The cookies came out great (but I listened to the other reviews and put in 3/4 c. of peanut butter).

This was just the recipe I was looking for.  I doubled the recipe to create less work later...made about 6 dozen cookies with double batch.  I also added a bit more peanut butter.  Since I am a fan of cookies with chips in them, I also put in a cup of Ghirardelli 60% cocoa chips.  The turned out just perfect!

Awesome! Replaced margarine with butter, and used whole wheat graham flour instead of all purpose. Turned out great with the textured flour, and more fiber-Boyfriend loved them and said a 9 out of 10.

I stumbled upon this recipe when looking at "singforyoursupperblog.com". They looked so good (and I am not even a big fan of p.b. cookies) that I had to make them. They are FABULOUS! Made them with the recommended change of using 3/4 c. peanut butter. They are best eaten when cooled and taste like you scooped a spoonful of peanut butter right out of the jar and kissed it with just the right amount of sweetness. They are soft and somewhat delicate with a very slight crunch to the outside and tender soft on the in. Of course the better the peanut butter you use the better a cookie you will have. Very very good.

Nice and soft as promised. Not a tremendous amount of peanut butter flavor though. I added some chocolate chips for fun. I would make these again and add more peanut butter. Loved the texture of these. Buttery soft inside and only slightly crisp outside. Very decadent.

I have tried so many other recipes that I hated.  I made this recipe the first time and they came out FABULOUS!  I doubled the peanut butter as suggested by a few others 'cause I love PB.  I have also made the recipe with Spleda (white & brown) and had great success.  Also, try not to overcook for best results.

These are by far the most amazing peanut butter cookies I have ever made!!! They were sooo moist, and delicious!!! Instead of sugar though, I used honey, and they turned out just amazing.

recipe was very, very easy to follow. when they bake, they dont really flatten much, so i just pressed those classic peanut butter fork imprints on the tops of the rolled balls of cookie dough before i put them in the oven to help flatten them a bit. we ate them like 30 minutes after they were done, and the middle was slightly cake like; very, very soft cookies. these would be great with a glass of milk i think...just dont dunk them to long, they may get soggy ;)... next time i will either add more peanut butter, or put in those chocolate & peanut butter chips in there because the peanut butter taste wasnt as BOLD as i hoped it would be which is why i only gave it 4 and not 5 stars...  maybe i'll just experiment with different brands of peanut butter... today i used Peter Pan, next time i'll try Jiff of Skipp, maybe they will create more of the "peanut butter" taste i was craving today... hope this was helpful

These are one if not the best Peanut Butter Cookies I have ever made and I have been baking for years. I made 2 double batches and the first batch I made was taste tested by the whole family and they all gave me a thumbs up. When I made my second batch I had realized that I had left out the brown sugar in the first batch and I must say the cookies taste almost the same. It's nice to know this recipe is forgiving like that. Needless to say both double batches came out simply wonderful. This recipe will be put in my recipe box for me to use for years to come and to put smiley faces on my friends and family. Knowing that I am baking the tastiest morsels I cam make. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

This was such a good recipe! I only made a half batch because i wanted to try it out, but used a whole jumbo egg, so i might double the egg in the whole recipe, I like nice soft cookies! I also did half powder/half white sugar, which i always like to do for most cookies. Used them to make pb kiss cookies, and they were awesome! I made them 3 days ago and have kept them in a tupperware, theyre still soft and delicious!

This is a funny one, made the cookies and got side tracked and forgot one of the ingredients and didn't realize, so when my boyfriend came over he tryed the cookies and said they were good but did not taste like peanut butter cookies ((readers are you following me now yes the ingredient missing was the PEANUT BUTTER,)) but I must say the cookies were very good tasted like a sugar cookie, so I put some peanut butter and jelly on the cookies and made a sandwich with them, and I must say they are pretty good. so if there is any one like me and forget the pb try this ENJOY

I loved this recipe.  It was soft and very tasty.  I also used 3/4 cup of peanut butter which gave the cookies a pleasant peanut butter taste without being too much.  We ate the cookies so fast it didn't have time to get stale.

I followed this recipe as written. I felt that the cookie spread out too much and became flat. Others recommended adding oatmeal, but I wanted to try the recipt as is. But I do believe that they could use modification. Plus, they bake very quickly, you have to watch these!

I should have read ALL the reviews apparently. I made them as the recipe said, and they are ok if you are in dire need of a cookie. But as for this recipe, i will not be making it again. There was WAY TOO MUCH flour in this. The first batch was dry and crumbly...and the 2nd batch i added some water too to hopefully salvage it, and it was better but not by much. 
There are MUCH better recipes out there for PB cookies!

This recipe was great! Peanut butter cookies are my favorite and I've always wanted to make them from scratch but I never thought it would turn out ok. Let's just say that my boyfriend ate the entire batch. I had only 2 cookies! Now he wants me to make more tonight.

A very, very good soft peanut butter cookie! I took the advice of others and added 2 extra tablespoons of peanut butter. Instead of using a fork to flatten them I used the bottom of a drinking glass for a smoother finish. I love this web site but my pet peeve is people who review a recipe after making several changes to the original, but I have to add that I did drizzle melted chocolate chips over mine and they looked and tasted great.  But to give credit to the submitter, they were great right out of the oven w/out the chocolate. I will definately use this recipe again!

These are absolutely the best peanut butter cookies I have ever tasted! I did not have any problems mentioned by other reviewers, such as cookies hardening or spreading too much.  I used butter instead of margerine, otherwise I went by the letter of the recipe. I squished the balls just a little with a fork in a classic criss-cross pattern.

These are the best Peanut Butter Cookies that I've ever made.  They are so moist and delicious!  I always add chocolate chips and peanut butter chips to them.  My daughter loves them!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Cindy.   =)

These are excellent! so delicious. I followed the other reviewers' advice and used 3/4 c peanut butter but I'm not sure you need to because they were REALLY peanut buttery (which I love, but I can see why it was originally written for less). I made them using the pampered chef big scoop and 9 minutes was perfect on a silpat mat but I thought the cookies were too big for the hersheys kisses I put on top so I switched to a smaller scoop. At this size, 8-9 minutes max and they were great!

These cookies are amazing as is, though I keep tweaking it to get a chewier cookie (they're soft, yes, chewie, no).  I guess I've made them about half a dozen times since I found the recipe about a month ago.  I've tripled the amount of peanut butter and added a little more brown sugar (about quarter cup), and also I like to add peanut butter chips.  I replace 1/2 cup of the creamy peanut butter for extra crunchy, because it adds the little peanut pieces, which is awesome.  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh, and if you only have bread flour on hand (ahem, oops), use about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups instead of 1 3/4.

1st batch of these cookies I made exactly as stated. While good, our family felt that it definatly needed more peanutbutter! So I bumped the peanut butter up to 1 cup for the second batch. Like someone else said, dont pay attention to edges, pay attention to time! By the times that the edges start to change you have way over cooked them. Overall great taste and they are soft. Stored in a zippy or a sealed cookie jar, they stay that way for several days. =)

I love peanut butter so I did put in 3/4 C of peanut butter. I have to say I was cursing these cookies as I was trying to shape them. They were super crumbly. I felt like they didn't need to be cooled in the fridge for 15 minutes. They were much easier to mold once I got them back up to room temp. I got them together and pressed them down (some I had to push back together once flattened) in a traditional cris-cross pattern. I ended up leaving them in the oven for 11 minutes because they were way too soft at 7 minutes. Once they cooled they had a slight crunch on the edges and soft in the center. Absolutely delicious!!! I will be making them again.

These are the best tasting peanut butter cookies I have ever had! I used butter instead of margarine, fresh-ground peanut butter, a little under 1 cup of raw sugar, and used 1 cup whole wheat flour (and 3/4 cup white flour). I've made these cookies twice and the first time I think I baked them too long. I took them out right at 8 minutes the second time and they were perfect and VERY moist. Mmm!

YUM! I took other's advice: subbed 1/4c honey for brown sugar, 3/4c oatmeal for 3/4c of the flour and doubled the pntbtr. I used crunchy pntbutter instead of creamy and also added butterscotch chips. Flattened balls w/bottom of rock glass. Baked 9 minutes and they came out beautiful! Very good, soft cookie - the whole family loves them! Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful!  However, I can't give all the credit to the recipe since I altered it, so I don't know exactly how it'd turn out.
First, I used butter instead of margarine.  Then I omitted the brown sugar and used 1/4 cup of honey instead (basically half of what was asked for brown sugar..depending on what you set the servings too).  I also did half and half with the flour; half whole wheat and half all purpose.  I also did half traditional scored cookies and the other half I left unscored and added chocolate chips.
These were VERY soft and VERY tastey.  My daughter is begging me for more as I type.  lol

My family wanted soft peanut butter cookies, and this one really fit the bill!  They stayed soft in our cookie jar, however they disappeared fast!  Try adding 1 cup of chocolate chips to the recipe.  Great recipe!

The recipe yields a good dough, but I like a bit more peanut butter flavor. Me and my grandmother experimented, and we found a wonderful solution: Reese's peanut butter chips.
Put in whatever amount you like. These chips make sure that the peanut butter flavor is not overwhelming while still giving you little bursts of P.B. flavor.
Try it!

These cookies are the bomb!  These cookies look so soft when they're baking that they fooled me into thinking they weren't done.  I will take them out after 8 or 9 min next time.  Regardless, they were still wonderful.  I added ~1/2 cup of Reese's pieces to the batter, and since these cookies aren't overly sweet to begin with, it was the perfect touch!

These were so good. I listened to the other suggestions and put brown sugar and more honey to make it less dry. I also used less flour and more oatmeal. Made it several times already and each time I try to make them better according to my tastes :D

Easy to make.Using suggestions from other reviewers I used 3/4 cup of peanut butter and added about some chocolate chips  Worked out great. For my first batch of cookies, I rolled them into balls after chilling them. For the second batch, I spooned them instead. Both weregreat and the family liked both. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic cookies!  I think the reason for the mixed reviews must be due to the baking time.  You need to mix the flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl first and then add it slowly to the wet mixture.  I baked them on parchment paper (so worth buying).  Take them out early!  I took the first batch out after 11 minutes because they didn't look done.  After a few minutes they were hard.  The next batches I took out at 9 minutes, they looked completely undone.   But as they cooled they finished baking.  Now they are delicious!  Also used 3/4 c. Peanut butter and butter instead of margarine.  I didn't chill the dough and they turned out fine and I used a melon baller to make small balls on cookie sheet.  I did have to flatten mine since they weren't flattening on their own.  I used a fork.  Very good just take them out earlier rather than later!

Love these! Used butter instead of margarine and made the suggested changes: upped the peanut butter to 3/4cup, used 1/2 cup honey instead of brown sugar and used 3/4 cup oats in place of 3/4 cup of the flour. I also mixed whole wheat, triticale and all purpose flour for the remaining 1 cup flour, but I'm sure using just all purpose would come out just as good. Cooked them for exactly 9 minutes and they are incredible.

Followed the recipe to a tea, added chocolate chips.  Hands down the BEST peanut butter cookie ever.  It IS soft and chewy and totally worth it to make.  Only suggestion, as goes for all cookies in my opinion, use parchment paper, works wonders.  And don't over cook this one, they don't get super golden brown, you take them out when you can see the BOTTOM golden brown, which was 11 minutes for me.

Great recipe! I rolled the balls of dough in sugar before baking...adds a little sugar and makes them prettier :) I baked for 8 minutes and they were perfect!

Great peanut butter cookie recipe.  FYI  -  I used 1 cup peanut butter.  I use organic materials and the peanut butter I use is stiffer with less sugars so I also used 3/4 cup for each brown and white sugars.  Also used 1/2 cup oats like another suggested.  Cookies stayed soft - that is - the ones that were left for the next days.

Cookie dough is the first test for me - this recipe made the BEST pb cookie dough I have ever tasted!  I used a melon baller to scoop them onto the cookie sheet instead of rolling them into balls. Very quick, very easy, and delicious!

Excellent soft pb cookie! I used real butter instead of margarine, added about 1/8 cup more white sugar, added 1/4 cup additional peanut butter, and a cup of semisweet chocolate chips. Mmm! Two things I noticed (more user error than recipe flaw): I should've mixed the chips in more thoroughly (I made four dozen smaller cookies--baked for eight minutes and thirty seconds) as my last two dozen were loaded, and I also should've flattened the first two dozen--just a bit--with my fingers. Either way, they were awesome! I bake everything on parchment paper and I think that helped. I only chilled the dough for about five minutes and it was fine. I'll be making these again for sure! Thanks for the recipe. :)

I made a double batch of these cookies and I added a little extra peanut butter. They turned out perfectly!!! They are already starting to disappear! Besides extra peanut butter (personal preference), I would not change anything at all with this recipe.

Very good cookie! Doubled the batch and added more PB and they are fantastic!  Very moist and soft, 9 minutes worked perfect for me.  Husband and I have been snacking on them all day so I need to go make more!

Followed the recipe exactly except for adding an additional 1/4 cup of peanut butter. These are delicious!!! Just made my first batch and I've already eaten 4 or 5 of them!  Perfect balance of peanut butter and sweetness.  Mine cooked for 10 mins and turned out soft, chewy and have a light crumbly texture. Next time I'll add chocolate chips.

Very good soft cookies cookies and stayed soft after refrigerating covered, I used a butter scooper to make into balls and they were the perfect size and turned out very pretty.  Will make again.

Wow. Wow. Wow.  These are very, very good.  Used 3/4 cup peanut butter.  Left them in balls--didn't press them flat.  I also added chocolate chips to half of the dough.  I baked my 9 minutes.  Still, they looked like they weren't quite done and tried to fall apart when I put them on the cookie sheet, but when they cooled they were perfect.  So be sure not to overcook.  Take those babies out, even if they look not quite ready.  This makes a very soft, creamy cookie.  Delicious!

Very soft, and they stay soft... at least the next day!  I'm not sure how much longer they'll last after that.  I used 3/4 cup peanut butter like other reviewers, real butter rather than margarine, and natural peanut butter.  Hubby loved them too, and he's PICKY about cookies (can't be too dry or hard).  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!  Next time I'll add some unsalted peanuts and replace a bit of the flour with whole wheat.

I don't cook / bake often.  However, I enjoy it when I do. I am diabetic and after a long time in denial, I am finally addressing it. Therefore, I have begun cooking more often and thought I'd try these cookies.  I substituted the white sugar with Splenda and used one cup of Jiff Creamy PB and they were wonderful! Thanks for a recipe that I can make and share with others (so I won't eat too many!).

This was a hit with my entire family.  They were not overly sweet which I liked.  My husband did think I should add a little more peanut butter next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Update** I initially reviewed this recipe right after I made these cookies.  The next day they were hard and I do not feel like I overbaked them.  Sorry but I probably will not try them again.  Thanks anyway.

I made these cookies last night and I have to say they where good but didn't taste as much like peanut butter as I hoped. I even used name brand and add more then the recipe called for. I think they would be better as a sugar cookie. Very soft and cake like. Good cookie just not really a penut butter one.

I doubled this recipe and it actually made 4 1/2 dozen cookies.  I did make a couple of changes and did 1 1/2 cups creamy peanut butter and only 1/2 cup of margarine and I added a bag of chocolate chips (next time I will use mini chips).

They were really good but hard to work with because the batter is really crumbly (but what peanut butter cookie batter isn't).  It was really hard to mix all the flour because of the crumbly batter.  I used a cookie scoop and made them into balls and then just used my hand to pat them flat.  I also let them sit for 1 minute before removing them from the pan.  

Overall they were really good and my husband said they were not kid friendly (his clue that I had to keep them home and not give them to my son's class LOL).

Delicious. When I first took these out of the oven, they were slightly golden brown and a little doughy in the middle.  I thought I had undercooked them but when I tried them a few hours later, they were absolutely perfect.  This will be my peanut butter cookie recipe from now on!

Mmm, these were good!  It was nice to see a pretty simple recipe without chocolate chips, coconut, etc.  I did use a fork to flatten each dough ball out, to make the characteristic "x" shape; otherwise you'd end up with a "cookie ball" as someone mentioned already.  For the first dozen, I flattened them after about 7 min. of baking, but it turned out fine - I just fixed the edges.  These helped redeem me for messing up the checking account this week - my husband loves pb cookies ;-)  Thanks!

This is a good recipe, not too sweet. I recommend flattening them with a fork, otherwise you will end up with round balls, which my family doesn't really care for. I added chocolate chips to mine, and also 2 tablespoons more peanut butter. Good recipe overall.

I have made these cookies a few times now and they are one of our absolute favorites!  I follow the recipe to a T, but I only bake them for 7 minutes.  They may look slightly underdone, but they come out perfect every time!  Thank you for this recipe.  Everyone should know what these cookies taste like!

I've had this recipe for a while, and did make as is; but eventually tweaked it more to my liking. Did ¾ cup "dry", ie less oily version of peanut butter, decreased white sugar to 1/4, but upped brown sugar to 2/3. Decreased flour to 1&1/2 cup, and added in peanut butter morsels since strangely I've never like the nut pieces of peanuts in peanut butter cookies. And these turn out great. Boston Market used to have soft peanut cookies a long long time ago, and that inspired me to search for this recipe. The store brands are not soft and always have real peanut pieces in them. Double yuck.

The simplicity of this recipe and the deliciousness of the end results makes this: The best PB cookie ever. I always like to stick to the original recipe exactly on my first run around, but I did use 3/4c. PB as all other reviews suggested. This made 24 cookies for me and I baked them for 7 minutes! I'm writing this review 2 days later  and they are fresh and moist as day one. I didn't have a good quality baking margarine on hand, but I did have a large tub of Country Crock, I was a little worried but the cookies came out fabulous!  I'm about to make my next batch, I'm sticking to the recipe again but one day I'm very curious to try the Honey substitution.

Perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe.  My friends thought they were delicious.  I added a piece of chocolate in the middle as soon as they came out of the oven.  I did everything like the recipe said other than adding my own little chocolate in the middle for presentation.

These cookies were awesome. Except I didn't have an egg on hand at the time. Instead I added half of a small banana to replace the egg. These cookies turned out soft and delicious. I would add a little bit more peanut butter though. The cookies were a bit more bananay than peanut buttery. But they were still amazing!

I used the amount of peanut butter called for, and I think I would bump it up like the reviews called for. Not very "peanut-buttery". I also cut the butter in half and added a ripe banana, which turned out pretty good. The cookies were definitey soft, and had a good texture, but I think next time I woud drop the marg completely and make it up with peanut butter, and I would cut the white sugar in half since the banana sweetens it.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  The ONLY think I did different was to flatten them with fork dipped in flour as I didn't want a rolled cookie.  For me the amount of peanut butter is perfect :)

That was the 1st time we made cookies with my three year old and he loved it! We also used 3/4 cup of peanut butter and used honey instead of brown sugar. Turned out wonderful!!!! Though as we used toaster oven, it took us extra 3-4 minutes.

this worked great. I took the oats and honey suggestion and I added the extra peanut butter. Because 1/2 of my family likes PB cookies without nuts and the other 1/2 begs for nuts I made the first few bathes without and then added nuts to the remaining batter and they came out great to!! 
The only problem is that after they cooled, they became a bit crispy but still this is a great recipe!

I followed other reviews by putting in 3/4 peanut butter. I put in 1/4 cup of honey instead of the white sugar. I also used half whole wheat half all-purpose. 
They turned out soft and delicious.

These were delicious! We have nut allergies in our home so we used Sunbutter (sunflower spread) and it was better than the Sunbutter sites recommended recipe that I have used for a few years.  I did use 1/4 honey in place of the brown sugar, used 3/4 C. wheat flour and the rest white, increased the sunbutter to 3/4 C,  and butter instead of margarine.  These disappeared very quickly! I know I made modifications but this recipe would be a winner as originally posted as well so I am still giving it 5 stars. I just make it a tiny bit healthier. Oh yeah, they were VERY soft and Chewy!!!

Delicious! I followed the recipe with the exception of using Kraft Unsalted/Unsweetened Peanut Butter, and adding a cup of milk chocolate chips. I also took the advice of other reviews and used 3/4 cup of peanut butter as opposed to 1/2 cup. Mmmmmmmm!

Just made these cookies for the first time, and they were excellent.  They disappeared right off the cooling rack.  I made with 3/4 cups of peanut butter based on reading other peoples suggestions.  I flattened with fork just a little as was unsure as wasn't mentioned in original recipe and glad I did.  Will definitely make again!

I made these cookies several times, the first time I noticed the peanut butter taste was very light. The next time I amde them I added another forth of a cup of peanut butter. The third time I made them I added honey along with the extra forth of a cup of peanut butter and they were perfect. I love the texture of the cookie. I am asked to make these about twice a month.

Okay, I've done this recipe a few times now and each time, I've been disappointed by the taste- even after following the suggestions in the comments.  I added more peanut butter and they still taste bland.  Maybe it's me... but I guess I just don't like this recipe.

this was my first time baking peanut butter cookies.  after reading several reviews about the cookies still being raw after 7-8 minutes, i baked my first batch at 9 min.  i removed them after the timer went off but found that the center was still pretty raw & soft so i baked them an additional 2-3 minutes.  they turned out just right!    my second batch i baked at 12:30 - i think that's too long so i'll probably try 10:30 - 11 minutes the next time i bake these.      per another reviewer, i also added 1/8 c more sugar & used a 3/4 c of peanut butter.  for the vanilla, i probably used 1-tbsp or 2.      the only negative - these cookies are pretty dry yet i won't give up on this recipe.  my son &i still really enjoyed them.  : )

I made the suggested changes of 3/4 cup pb and substituted some flour for whole wheat and oats. I'm rating a 3 due to changes required to make them more peanut buttery. The flavor is nice, I added pb chips to some, chocolate to others, just for a few changes. The pb chips ones are the best. My cookies are definitely NOT soft. I used real butter, and chilled like the directions state, so I'm not sure why but they are rock hard.

SO much better than the "moist chewy" PBCC recipe on this site.  I added an additional 1/4 cup of peanut butter, crushed walnuts, and chocolate chips, and the end result is HEAVEN.  This is hands-down THE best peanut butter cookie I've ever tasted.  Enjoy!!

This recipe is amazing! I've made probably around 6 times and each time they are as good as ever! My dad even said they were the best peanut butter cookies he's ever had in his life. They are so delicious. Perfectly soft. One time I added Reeses peanut butter chips to the dough and when we ate them, they were soft, crumbly and delicious but this is the only time they have come out crumbly.

the only peanut butter cookie i've ever loved. i followed the advice of others, adding 3/4 cup peanut butter and some chocolate chips. the cookies were perfect after 7-8 minutes and I let them sit for a couple minutes on the hot cookie sheet. so soft and good! this will be a new favorite.

This tasted really good! So sweet, peanutbuttery..! I followed other people's advice by increasing the peanut butter to 3/4 cup and replaced the flour w/ oatmeal. My big mistake was replacing the white sugar with maple syrup. The cookie dough would not harden and when I baked the cookies all of the cookies ran together in a gloppy mess, which was my own fault. Although I might add, it was a delicious, heavenly-tasting gloppy mess.

These cookies have a great texture and are indeed soft but they lack in flavor. I agree that more peanut butter is definitely needed to give these cookies a richer flavor.

These cookies were fabulous, but I did add more peanut butter, after reading the reviews.  I think I ended up adding almost a whole cup of PB.  The cookies were soft and delicious.  A little crumbly, but still very good.  Also, I did not chill the dough.  It was plenty firm as-is.

My family really loves these. I used Smart Balance spread, 3/4 c. peanut butter and graham flour as one other reviewer suggested. Really good! Only one other suggestion: Double this recipe. Using a small cookie scoop, I was able to get less than two cookie sheets out of this recipe.

Best peanut butter cookie recipe I've ever made!
I only made half a batch to see if they were good, but now that I know I am going to make another whole batch! Very soft and chewy, and extremely flavorful. I'm bringing these into where I work tomorrow, and I'm sure they'll be a hit.

I gave this recipe a rating of 4 because, like others, I found the peanut butter flavor to be too mild. I think that an extra 1/4 to 1/3 cup of peanut butter would create a better flavor...but it might also create a greasier cookie.
The changes I made to the recipe are minor: Because we don't like over-sweet cookies, I decreased both the brown and white sugars down to 1/3 cup each. As per other's suggestions, I decreased the flour to 1 1/3 cups. Also I substituted butter for the margerine.  As a side note, I used Adam's 100% Natural creamy peanut butter. 
OK...in regards to texture I'd give these cookies 5 stars. We made them into 1.5" balls, baked them for 8-9 minutes, pulled them out of the oven just before the edges browned, and cooled them on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack. The cookies had a pillowy perfect softness, even on the 2nd day!
My family really liked them. Thanks for a great recipe.

I just made these cookies and they are great, very soft.  I chilled the dough for 30 minutes and still couldn't roll them, I just dropped them from a teaspoon on the pan.  Next time I may add more flour or oatmeal as others have.

Fantastic recipe. Very soft and chewy. Lots of PB flavor. I have made them both with chocolate chips and as giant sized PB cookies. I used salted butter and it didn't affect the recipe at all.

The flavor is great!  However, I think I made a couple of errors.  I used butter instead of margarine, and a brand of peanut butter we tried (it was cheap) and didn't much like.  Seemed like a good idea at the time...however, it was too dry (I think) and difficult to make balls that didn't fall apart.  In fact, they did split and crack when I did the fork thing.  Because the flavor was good, I'll try it again, with the proper ingredients!

So I followed some of the other reviews and used honey instead of sugar, and I upped the peanut butter by a 1/4 cup... oh, and I  added some peanut butter chips! Maybe half a bag or so and they were fabulous! My husband and I couldn't stop eating them. They were so addictive that I made another batch the very next day... and I'm off to make another right now! Perfect. Delicious. My favorite cookie EVER. :)

I doubled this recipe and substituted whole wheat pastry flour for just under half of the flour, and added some extra peanut butter as others suggested. I flattened the balls with a fork and made both small and medium-sized cookies with the same cooking time. My kids devoured these and asked for more. They stayed soft and chewy and you would not know that I used w.w. pastry flour. I'll make these again, soon.

Great cookie!!  I used half whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup margerine and 3/4 cup peanut butter to give it a richer taste and lessened the sugar a little to compensate for the sweetness of the extra peanut butter.  I then rolled the balls in cinnamon sugar for a nice touch.  I will definitely make these again

These aren't the best I've had, but they are super soft and easy to make. I also used 3/4 cup peanut better instead of 1/2. And I used 1 cup wheat flour and 3/4 white. It is imperative that you don't overcook them - in my older oven 10 minutes was best. Also, I didn't chill them - I'm nine months pregnant and was too impatient :)

I doubled the recipe and was afraid that there was way too much flour but I stuck to the recipe (I did add about 1/2 cup more PB because I love peanut butter)and rolled each one in sugar. I cooked them for exactly 9 minutes (I didn't bother to spray the cookie sheet, they are so full of oils already). I ate one that was still warm and I definitely needed some water!! When warm, they are super soft. When they cooled, they became more cake-like but still soft. I would suggest making the balls about 1 inch in diameter, def no bigger! They do not spread out much but they are so rich you don't need a big cookie.

Wow!  Disregard any review that tells you these aren't fabulous as are -- perfection in a cookie!  I like my cookies thick, so I didn't flatten them with a fork.  I dropped them by a cookie ball scoop onto the baking sheet, and they came out looking like cute little scoops of ice cream!  Thick, chewy -- almost creamy -- cookies, definitely our new favorites.  We're salt-free; I omitted the salt, used salt-free peanut butter, and substituted a half-teaspoon of salt-free baking powder for the baking soda, and they still came out fabulous.  I compared a batch baked directly after mixing with a batch baked after the prescribed 15 minutes of refrigeration, and found little difference -- if anything, I liked the un-refrigerated ones better.  In any case, you can't go wrong here.  Thanks!!

Delicious!  Do not overbake and they will be wonderful.  I rolled them in sugar before baking.  I also added a few M&Ms in some before going in the oven.  All you heard in my kitchen last night was 'mmmmmmmmmm'.

I do not like PB cookies.  This are the only PB cookies I have made in three years for my husband.  And I like them.  
A few changes - I used Earth Balance Buttery Sticks instead of margarine and I increased the PB to 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 c.  I didn't refrigerate the dough, just rolled it into rough shaped balls, baked for 10 minutes and then flattened with fork tines after baking.  
Thank you for sharing!  Maybe I'll mend my PB avoidance ways.

These cookies were really easy to make but came out too dry.  I think it may have been the type of peanut butter I used (Teddies Unsalted Old Fashioned Peanut Butter)which dries up kinda quickly once the jar is opened.  I would try this recipe again, but use skippy or something more creamy.

yummy! I followed the recipes exactly and would bake 1 pan at a time- while leaving the dough in the freezer in between. Then taking it out to roll up the next batch. I baked them for about 11 minutes and they were perfect! the recipe says 7-10min but with 9 minutes my dough was really undercooked in the middle. And they were only about 2" in diameter. Soft, not crispy, and doesnt crumble when you bit into it. This will be my PB cookie recipe from now on. Thanks!

These were quite good; could have been a bit more "peanut-buttery" but I liked them, and they were gobbled up quickly in my house. I wasn't able to criss-cross them though because the dough was just slightly too dry. Thanks for the recipe, I am sure I will make again.

Fabulous! I was looking for a good peanut butter cookie recipe, and I think I've found it! Even my boyfriend who doesn't like peanut butter cookies ate these and enjoyed them. I discovered why pb cookies have those characteristic fork tine marks after the first batch...my first batch came out a bit like peanut butter-flavored pebbles. But when I pushed them down with a fork for the second batch, they came out beautifully!! Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

When I lived in Germany, my peanut-butter-starved American and British friends LOVED when I made these cookies.  They never lasted long and are so easy to make, yet delicious.  You really won't need another recipe after this one!  Even my German friends who claimed to dislike peanut butter loved these.

I made these cookies late at night when we needed a cookie fix and only had 1/2 cup pb.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup honey.  1 cup kamut flour and 3/4 cup protein powder.  We certainly didn't have a problem eating them up!  Cured the craving but we found them very sweet and didn't really taste like pb.  Maybe it's the change of honey for brown sugar.  But we would prefer more pb flavour.  However they were super simple and came out super soft!  An excellent emergency cookie when you have cravings...or company but didn't really have a stron pb taste..wich can be a good thing as well. :0)

My whole family loved these cookies.. Out of 5 different cookies these were the first to be eaten. I did add more peanut butter because we're nuts for peanut butter. With the dough I did thumbprint cookies with hurshey huggs, cut out cookies, and regular peanut butter cookies pressed with a fork 7 minutes into cooking.. They all came out amazing. Already working on a second batch to give out as gifts.

These cookies were good, but they could have been far better.  The dough was extremely crumbly and I think there is too much flour called for in this recipe.  I also agree with other reviewers that there is not enough of a peanut butter taste to these cookies.  The first batch I made, I rolled into balls, then pushed down with a fork prior to baking.  Most of the cookies crumbled and came apart while baking.  The second batch I left in balls, then used a fork to push them down after seven minutes of baking, put them back in the oven for 2 more minutes.  Much better--no crumbly cookies!  I will make this again, but with some modifications.

I made these tonight and my husband and I can't stop eating them! I modified the recipe a bit. Instead of 1 3/4 flour I just made it 1 cup of flour and 3/4th oatmeal. The texture is a nice crunch but not the interruption of a nut. This one is a keeper!

These were very very good!! I used honey peanut butter I couldn't get the kids to eat on sandwiches and they turned out great, maybe not as soft as if I had used regular (the honey stuff if kinda tough!!) My kids love them w/vanilla ice cream in between two (an ice cream cookie sandwich) will definately be making again!!

I have to re-rate this after a few years. I recently made a DIFFERENT peanut butter cookie and they totally flopped and spread out to gross peanut butter pancakes.  Then I pulled out this recipe and forgot that this is the most PERFECT peanut butter cookie EVER! Just made them and they STILL ROCK!

This recipe worked out very well. I doubled the batch. I rolled them in sugar before making the cross hatching with a fork. That made them extra special. I also specifically was looking for a recipe that called for margarine instead of shortening since thats what I had. This one fit the bill to the tee. Everyone loved them and I can see that I will be making them again soon. Thanks!

I thought that they were ok.  I used an ice cream scooper so i could get large consistent cookies, but the dough was so crumbly it was hard to scoop, even afer chilling.  After scooping the 5 cookie, the dough ended up breaking my ice cream scooper.  I kept checking up on the first batch and saw that they weren't flattening out, so in the middle of baking, I took a glass and pressed the cookie flatter.  They turned out to taste fine and I didn't burn them.  It would've gotten more stars if it hadn't been such a hassle to make.  But with the added 1/4c of peanut butter, and all that stuff, the cookie was thick and tasted good, but not good enough to bake again.

These were the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made.  I did roll the balls in white sugar and pressed gently with a fork to create the traditional looking peanut butter cookie.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks Cindy.

Fantastic cookies. We substituted all purpose flour with potato flour to make it gluten free, and it was a smashing success.

Very good cookies.  At first I thought they weren't cooked enough, but after cooling, they firm up a bit.  I added about 1/2 cup chocolate & peanut butter chips, and they were awesome!  Thanks!

I'm not generally a pb cookie fan but my fiance is so I was making them for him. I live in china town and the brown sugar I was able to buy was a little weird; it looked like cinnamon and tasted like molasses so I was little weary. But I couldn't stop eating the dough! I used about a 1/3 of a cup less flour. I don't understand that first review about it not tasting peanut buttery (4 tbsp? the recipe called for 1/2 cup). mmmm I'm trying them out on my man tomorrow night

There are the weirdest peanut butter cookies I have ever tasted. True they are chewy, but they did not at all taste like peanut butter even though I added like 4 tbsp!!! They didn't even bake out flat , they just stayed in ball form!! DO NOT make these!!!

clearly the best soft peanut butter cookie recipe that I have tried. I add either chocolate or butter scotch chips to this recipe.  The folks in the office call them awesome.

I made these yesterday, and they were wonderful!!  I did read some of the reviews first and did change up a couple of things.  I know some don't like hearing that, but it helps me know what may or may not have worked, and tweak them a little to make more to our family's taste.

Used a #60 cookie scoop and baked for 8 minutes. Very nice out of the oven on their own and with some strawberry jam. Easy for my 10 yo to mix up on their own. Came together quickly as an after dinner snack. Will see how they rate tomorrow.

I made the recipe as posted.  I found the dough very soft and difficult to place on the sheet.  There was absolutely no way to press the dough down with a fork  since it would cling to the fork.

These are not the most peanut butter either. It's not a bad recipe, but there are better out there.

Really like this recipe. I did add extra 1/4 cup PB and replaced 3/4 cup flour with oatmeal as per other reviews. I know that means I'm not rating the original recipe, but that's the thing I love about Allrecipes! We learn from each other. I also put them in mini muffin tins to bake, fun shape, soft and chewy! Mine took 9 minutes to bake in the tins but I have a low temp oven I think, brand new, just called the appliance shop AGAIN to come service it. Try these, you'll love them!

I just finished making these, for church.  Hubby requested some extra, so making more... Easy, and they are delicious.  I just put them in the freezer for 10 minutes, as I was in a big hurry.. They came out fine.  I did do a slight criss cross pattern on them.

Super easy (and pretty fast) to make (my two year old helps me mix it) and stays nice and soft in a container. My husband loves them. I made it first with a mix of whole wheat and all purpose flour, came out great. So the next time I did it with all whole wheat flour and it still came out great!!

I tried this recipe because I love soft cookies.  I was very unimpressed and extremely disappointed.  The dough is VERY dry and does not form a ball well at all.  I did have to bake them for the full length of time.  I did not get to use them for what I had intended them for and had to find and make a new recipe.

Its a great reciepe.  But I didnt have chunky peanut butter,  so i added crushed walnuts,  crushed almonds to my creamy peanut butter.  After i had it all mixed it needed more flour to get it to the right thickness.  I also added a little bit of white chocolate to it as well.  Turned out great!  I prefer my cookies chewy n chunky lol

Super simple. I did follow the recipe exactly so I could leave an honest review on THIS recipe, not my tweaked one ;-) These were amazingly soft. Kids and hubby liked them so they go into my arsenal of cookies. Thanks a bunch for sharing.

These cookies were soft and delicious with lots of peanut butter flavor.  I listened to the other suggestions and used 3/4 cup peanut butter but stuck to the recipe other than that.  I baked  them for 7 minutes and they were perfect.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  This is now my go to recipe for peanut butter cookies.

This recipe needs more peanut butter. They burned very easily (I made two different batches, one time was my fault), and had a rather grainy consistency. With a few tweaks I am sure it could be much better.

I followed the recipe to-the-T and the flavor was five-star! Unfortunately, because they didn't stay soft after they cooled down I could not let myself rate the recipe five-star overall.

Perfect in every way.. Used 3/4 peanut butter for more flavor and I was out of vanilla so I used French vanilla creamer.. Turned out great!

Before I start my review, all of the different ways I've tried this have been with real butter, not margarine. First off, I want to also add that I forgot to spray my foil before baking, and it came off of the pan really easily, I tested it on the next batch and it didn't change anything so if you don't have any, or you'd rather be safe than sorry, it doesn't matter, the outcome should be the same.

For Peanut butter cookies: I attempted the recipe with 3/4 cups of peanut butter, and it wasn't really too peanut butter-y at first but the next day it was more noticeable, still would use the 1 cup to be sure. I tried some with the classic fork prong criss-crossing but they tasted much better if you leave them as they are, they stay soft the next day rather than completely hardening like the criss-crossed ones did. 

For chocolate chip peanut butter cookies: I added about a cup of milk chocolate chips to the batter after I used about half of it, so I guess 2 cups if you want the entire batch to be this kind. The chocolate chips really added something to them and kind of set off the peanut butter flavor in a way that I couldn't taste in the original recipe. Definitely recommend.  

I baked all of the cookies above for about 10 minutes each batch, it made about 34 cookies if each mound of dough is about an inch. If you don't have a mixer, you can do it by hand (fork), it was a little bit of work when it came to the mixing but not impossible, and definitely not too hard.

Doubled this recipe and made exactly 48 by measuring out 1/4 C. dough splitting it in half to make each cookie. I dipped each ball into white sugar and placed them sugar side up on sheets before pressing them down with fork. I had to cook them for 11-12 minutes and allow them to cool for a few more minutes on the pans before removing them to the cooling racks. These were excellent. Soft but stayed together well.I will putting them in the christmas cookie rotation.

I made these exactly as directed, and they were thick and fudgey with an excellent not-too-peanut buttery flavor.  You could taste the cookie dough flavor, too, which is exactly what I wanted.  If I wanted a mouthful of pb, I'd grab the jar and a spoon!!  These cookies were a hit at our party, and the leftovers went home wrapped in napkins, tucked in pockets :)

Thank You for sharing!! These cookies are really really good :).  I had to unfortunately add a little more flour and baking soda to hold the dough together and I did add more peanut butter like suggested.  I did however try it the first time and it was a flop they came out like flat pancakes lol..but second time worked great!!  THANKS AGAIN!

The flavor is good, but for some reason they almost seemed rubbery on the bottom. Ive used other recipes in the same conditions/time with no issue. Almost needed to burn them to toast the bottom enough that they were "crunchy" over "rubbery"..

I altered by adding 3/4 tsp each of vanilla and almond extracts, and reduced the cooking time to 9 minutes.  The best soft peanut butter cookies ever - they are gone as soon as I make them!

I followed the advice of many others who said to use 3/4 cups of peanut butter, and that worked great.  I also put a chocolate chip on top of each one after they came out of the oven, just for a bit of added cuteness.  Overall, these cookies were really simple and easy to make and tasted great!

Excellent!  I didn't change a single ingredient.  I did roll them before refrigerating for 15 minutes (only because I misread the directions) and they turned out great.  In response to another review, I didn't see the color change either, I just usually look for the cookies to start cracking to signal they are done.  I served them to my Bible study last night and got rave reviews.  Thanks for this excellent recipe!

NOTE:  I doubled the recipe and got 37 cookies using the Pampered Chef #40 scoop to measure (before rolling).  My oven takes a little longer, so I ended up baking for 15 minutes at 350.  They were soft and just perfect.

These are sooooo good.  I added a little over 3/4 c. reduced fat peanut butter.  I rolled mine in balls slightly smaller than ping pong balls.  This recipe made 52 cookies.

I followed this recipe exaclty as it is written and am extremely happy with how these cookies turned out. I had a go to recipe for pb cookies years ago that was misplaced and I've been searching for one to replace it. This will def be my new go to recipe. I am over the moon happy with how these came out. Perfectly soft and taste great! The first batch I baked on a regular cookie sheet for 12 min, the second batch on an airbake sheet for the same amt of time. The second batch didn't hold it's shape as well and some fell apart when I took them off the sheet. Maybe this is why some reviews complain about the cookie crumbling? Next time I'll use my reg sheet for all batches. Did I mention how much I LOVE this recipe :)

Oh my god, these peanut butter cookies were everything I was looking for!!! I stumbled across so many recipes that used waay too much peanut butter. I don't need all that excess calories and fat. Don't ever think using less peanut butter will lack flavor. These cookies are purrfect! I put all the ingredients together into a dough, and then realized I forgot the egg. I took the dough apart and added the egg. I thought it was going to turn out bad...but it didn't!..The cookies were fantastic! You can't go wrong with this recipe!...Oh, REMEMBER TO ADD PEANUTS!....

I added 3/4 cup of peanut butter and the honey instead of sugar like someone else suggested and made the most amazing batch of peanut butter cookies I have ever baked. The cookies were nice and soft!

These cookies were on the home page today, so I decided to try them. I had bought too much Halloween candy and seen the picture posted had them made with candies on top. I did a couple of different types, Kit Kat being the best! The cookies were good and soft, and the peanut butter taste was mild. I also liked that they didn't seem greasy, like many peanut butter cookies I have tasted. Although, I have always thought of peanut butter cookies to be a little plain tasting, so it is not something I normally make, this recipe seems to be a good basic peaunut butter cookie that is easily adaptable to any modifications.

Followed the recipe exactly, but added some peanut butter M&M's on top of a few.  These are soft and we are all thoroughly enjoying them.

These came out very tough, rather than chewy. I stopped adding flour after 1.5 cups because the dough was so dry I had to wet my hands and knead it to incorporate everything, and I think it was the kneading that toughened them.   Flavour was nice, not too sweet but I still think I'll try a different recipe next time.

I love this recipe! I think it's perfect! I plan to make these cookies for my younger sister sometime within the next month. She loves them, too!  Also, I posted a picture of a recipe card I made. I thought I would get to put a description on it before it posted, but I was wrong! Oh well. But, I just noticed that my ingredient measurements on the card are all twice as much of what are listed here, so I guess I made two batches last time and forgot to take that into account when I made the card. I would delete the picture and make a new one, but I don't know how! Anyway, GREAT RECIPE!

Made as directed and didn't even refrigerate and these were a hit. Be careful on the baking time though. It's a challenge to make sure they're done as they don't really brown. These cookies stayed soft for me in a ziplock for three days. Then it wasn't an issue as they were gone, gone, gone:)

These cookies were AMAZING.  I literally signed up to this site so that I could comment on these cookies.  I used butter instead of margarine and also used 3\4 cup PB and added oatmeal instead of all the flour. They came out DELICIOUS.  My husband loved them and so did the kids.  Perfect blend and very soft, this recipe has inspired me to bake again. Thanks

This is a decent recipe, but not exactly what I was looking for. I did follow the recipe exactly except for adding the extra 1/4 cup of PB. I tried them at 7 minutes and the next batch at 8 and both were still raw in the middle... I went up by 2 minutes for the next batch - still not really done and still not even browning on the edges.... 12 minutes finally worked well and they are (as a few others mentioned) very slightly crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside... the taste was decent, but still not what I was looking for. My regular crunchy PB cookies have a better taste... guess I'm still looking for the right recipe...

Altho I pull many, many recipes from here with success I've never felt compelled to comment before.  These cookies are WONDERFUL!!!  My boys have asked for them repeatedly since the first batch.  As suggested from other reviews I substituted the oats for some of the flour.  I think it makes them that much better - chewier and softer.  I'll try the honey substitution next and see how that goes!  This is definitely a 5 star recipe!

Great cookie.  I used whole wheat flour instead of regular flour which worked out fairly well although I did feel the need to coat the cookies in sugar before squishing them with the fork.  I think next time I will increase the amount of PB used to cover the whole wheat aftertaste.  This is the only cookie recipe where I have had an issue with the total whole wheat substitution being problematic.  Otherwise, this recipe is awesome.  The cookies remain soft and are delightfully delicious.  Definitely will experiment again! :)

Pretty good taste, my only issue was the texture was a litttle crumbly.  I liked the recipe enough that I will give it a second shot, maybe I will beat the PB and butter together for a little while longer to help with the texture.

My family died over these. They are soft chewy and taste absolutely perfect but be careful not to overbake. i chose this particular pb cookie recipe cuz i dont like when there's too much peanut butter and this recipe calls for equal amount of butter and peanut butter, which to me is just perfect. 1st batch i did just normal criss cross pb cookies. 2nd bath i added mini reeses pieces and formed dough into 1/4 cup size dough balls dipped in sugar (all the kids loved these)

Batter tasted good, but somehow the cookies moulded into eachother in the oven and barely cooked, and now that they're cool they're hard as rocks. Some adjustment is needed. Also, the batter nearly burnt out my mixer.

These Cookies were delicious. I made them a few days afther the new year just because I had too much PB in the house. My hubby was very upset because his resolution was to diet and I tempted him with his favorite cookie(peanut butter) during the first week of the new year. He cheated and ate a few but I wont tell.  The only adjustment I made was to add bit more PB and sugar.

I'm not a fan of peanutbutter cookies, but I thought these were pretty good.  The recipe could have been written better. I was not sure if I was supposed to flatten the balls but I went ahead and did so and they turned out fine.  We put Hershey kisses in ours after they baked.

I made these to add to our Christmas goodie trays, and they were a hit! I used real butter, rather than margarine and pure vanilla. I rolled into balls, then into a mixture of regular sugar, green & red decor sugars. Shortly after coming out of the oven, I topped each cookie with 3 mini hershey kisses. This made for an attractive cookie! My dough was stiff enough, that I didn't need to refrigerate dough. I'll certainly be using this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

These were great. I used 3 tbsp honey, 3 tbsp of molasses, and left out the brown sugar. I also used about 1 cup of peanut butter. I had some semisweet chocolate squares on hand, so I melted them (about 2 ounces) and with a knife, swirled it into the dough. They came out great!

Really good, with more peanut butter added. When I eat a peanut butter cookie, it needs to taste like peanut butter; that what it is-a peanut butter cookie.

These were just as Cindy said, not too sweet but if cooked just long enough soft.  The only major change I made was to take the suggestions of others and add a total of 3/4 cup peanut butter.  Beyond that, as personal craving, I added about 1/2 cup chopped roasted peanuts.  This is my new "go-to" peanut butter cookie recipe.  Thanks Cindy!!!

This is my "go to" Recipe for peanut butter cookies. They are perfect made exactly according to the recipe. Depending on where you live, you may need to alter the cooking time. Sometimes I add a splash of almond extract because I really like the flavor. If you really want a treat, throw some mini chocolate chips in the batter!

I doubled the recipe and added a bag of chocolate chips. I also used chunky peanut butter instead of regular. I thought that they could be a little sweeter but everyone that tried them thought that they were perfect.

They were very easy to make, and very soft. I added a tablespoon of honey for extra sweetness, and they were still not extremely sweet. There was really no need to chill the dough, so I skipped that step and added some cadies to half the batch for my choco-holic husband.

I nearly doubled the peanut butter and I still thought they might be a bit too flour-y. But my husband, the peanut butter fan, says "perfection." Everyone who tried them wanted seconds.

I was craving peanut butter cookies so badly because I gave up chocolate for Lent and I needed something sweet and this was perfect!  I've always loved peanut butter cookies but never was crazy about how crispy they were.  These are nice and chewy and will keep me from going crazy by Easter!

Very good cookies, but not as soft as I hoped. But I can say, they were just as my grandma used to make. I will probably try another soft peanut butter cookie recipe next time.

I love anything peanut butter, especially cookies. I can't make these cookies without a reason though, because I could eat the entire bowl of dough, or if I made it past the dough I could eat every last cookie. These cookies are so good!

These are incredible, melt-in-your-mouth cookies. I modified the recipe by doubling the peanut butter (didn't need additional flour), and I used honey instead of white sugar. I sprinkled a little sugar on top of some of the cookies before baking but found that they set just fine even without the sugar.  They're delicious!

I LOVE these cookies! And so does everyone else I share them with! I normally make a half batch crunchy the other soft. My 5 year old niece loves them (loves making them with me and sampling the batter with me too!). This recipe is definitely a keeper, thanks!!!

Changed recipe to make six cookies.  Used extra-crunchy peanut butter, and Smart Balance margarine.  May have, by mistake, put in only about a cup or so (instead of 1 3/4 cups) of combined instant oats and flour but the cookies didn't seem to suffer much from this. Used half cup peanut butter only and that was enough for our taste (my husband later told me that the peanut taste was just right--neither overwhelming nor too subtle), and added semi-sweet chocolate morsels. Pressed them down with my hand and shaped them into nice circles and had six LARGE (bakery size) cookies, each cookie a dessert onto itself!  

I left them in for exactly eight minutes: any more than that would have been too much so you definitely have to be careful you don't overbake--start looking into the oven after 7-8 minutes since each oven is different.  The combined texture of the oats and the peanut bits from the extra-crunchy peanut butter made them nice and chewy, and the chocolate morsels added just the extra sweetness the cookies needed and a touch of silky softness. Today, day after first making them, I put one in the microwave (from the refrigerator) for about 20 seconds and it was perfect and fresh. 
Next time I may use whole wheat flour, add flax seed.  For additional decadence I may roll them in sugar before baking, and may use M&M's instead of chocolate morsels, or just insert a Hershey's kiss righ smack in the middle if I make the cookies smaller.

I added the extra 1/4 cup of Peanut butter, which made these "just like Mom used to make".  For my hubby, I added chocolate chips.

Great recipe.

MMMMMMM.....sooooooooo good! I almost doubled the amount of peanut butter and added about a Tbs. of honey.  In half the batch I put in some chocolate chips! If you eat those right from the oven, they taste like a rolled up Reese's Peanut Butter Cup!

This is easy and great tasting. I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it should have more peanut butter in it. I ended up making 2 batches and doubling the PB in the second batch. YUMMY! Oh, and 9 min. max in the oven for me!

These were so good.  I added a few more tablespoons of butter and used honey roasted peanut butter.  I also rolled the balls in sugar, as I do with any peanut butter cookie recipe, but other than that I didn't change anything and they were very yummy and chewy!  Thanks for the post!!

This recipe was very easy to prepare and didn't take to much time to prepare and bake, and didn't cause a messy kitchen. My husband and kids loved them. I also sprinkled a little touch of white sugar on top of the cookies, to give it a little sweet taste. I recommend this recipe to others. Enjoy!!

This is great. I will never use another one. Like some of the other reviews i did cut the flour back by 1/2 cup. I use a small cookie scoop (about 1 to 1&1/2 inch in diamater) so i did get 21 cookies

Average.  I thought the dough was pretty dry.  They tasted fine, but I think you have to finagle the recipe a little bit to get the "soft" down pat.

Peanut butter makes me sick so I didn't eat them, but was told they tasted great. However, they did not stay soft even when I took them out of the oven a bit early.

I cut back the sugar and (accidentally) added a bit of extra soda to these.  DH said he thought they were "missing something" but then ate half a dozen right out of the oven.  The next day, they are still very soft, but not maybe as tasty as he would like.  He's the expert, but I also didn't exactly follow the recipe.

This recipe ROCKS!!!  My three kids absolutely loved it!  I only made a couple of changes...I added 2 extra tablespoons of peanut butter and I added mini M&M's.  I also rolled the balls into the size of small walnuts and they came out the perfect size for kids!  And this recipe was sooooooo easy to make!  My 3-year old helped me make them from beginning to end and we had a ball!  Thanks for such a great, easy recipe!  This one is going into my collection!

I really don't know what to say here....the taste was okay (not that I'm an expert cookie taster mind you), the texture as well, but the work involved was just not worth it to me. The dough was very very difficult to work with...sorry, I will not make again and will continue to search for that perfect Peanut Butter Cookie
recipe.  Thanks away!

My 4yr old and I just got done making this recipe and they turned out FANTASTIC! I haven't had a peanut butter cookie this good since I was a child! The one thing I did differently was substituted sugar for SPLENDA. First time using the product and it worked great. Thanks so much for this easy, yummy delight.

Loved the cookies! Mine turned out great even though I rolled them into balls. They did flatten...I think the trick is to make smaller balls. Great cookies, mine turned out PERFECT!!

Hello All, I have tried this recipe, and it works out great!!, Instead of writing "Thank You" Cards for my Baby Shower that my co-workers gave me, I used this recipe!, put cookies in ziplock bags, tied a ribbon and a little computer generated note around the bag,
The cookies stayed soft and chewy, and everyone absolutley loved them!!!I delt these cookies out to 25 people!! Not a crumb left!

I really doubted this would turn out well, the dough was crumbly and very dry.  Turned out lovely, chewy and a little crispy.  Better when left a little longer than 10 minutes. Super easy!

Pretty good cookies, though I added 2/3 cu choc chips, and I thought that the cookies needed the added sweetness/ texture of the chocolate.  These were not done in 7-10 min-  I had to cook them for 12min.

The kids say give these 5 stars.  I snuck in a bit of whole wheat pastry flour and they asked for choc. chips so I added two thirds of a cup.  I used a TBSP. of dough per cookie and flattened them with a glass.

Great recipe! They didn't last 24 hours in my house. I will add peanut butter chips next time I make them for more peanut butter flavor.

I tried this recipe and I didn't even get a cookie. Between and husband and children, I was lucky to get just the aroma. Great recipe!!!!

The first time I read this recipe, I thought the amount of sugar is too much. I tried it anyway and let my partner have a taste and didn't tell him what kind of cookies they are. He couldn't tell what they are because they're too sweet and he couldn't even trace a taste of peanut butter on them. So, I cut the amout of sugars in half and double the amount of peanut butter since, they're called peanut butter cookies.
