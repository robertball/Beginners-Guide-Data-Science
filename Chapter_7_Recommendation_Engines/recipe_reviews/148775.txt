Oh. My. Goodness. Is this good! If I could add more stars than five, I totally would.

I am SO glad that I attempted this recipe. I was skeptical at first, but
blown away when I tasted the end results.
Never again will I use bought syrup. It's
not like your typical bottled syrup.
It's more like a liquid cinnamon roll.
It's truly amazing, and you really can't
understand unless you try for yourself.

The only thing I changed was upped the
cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. I like my foods a little stronger on the spice side.

I freaked out after I added the baking
soda, because it foamed up quite a bit.
(I didn't read the reviews beforehand
so I wasn't expecting this.) After 
pouring in into the container and 
letting it cool in the refrigerator,
then shaking it up, it was thicker and
the syrup was more uniform in color.

Thank you times infinity for the person
who submitted this recipe.

I have such a mixed opinion on this one.  I agree with everyone else about the wonderful flavor.  I also agree about using a pot twice as big as needed because of the foaming after you add the b.soda.  The foam took about 30 minutes to go away after the syrup was done.  However - despite the great flavor - I could taste a slightly "carbonated" aftertaste of the baking soda.  I had to refrigerate this syrup and wait until the next morning to reheat it in the microwave - then this baking soda taste was gone.  I would recommend preparing this the day before you have guests over.  Otherwise it does have the flavor everyone else says it does!

All right, this is seriously the best syrup ever.  No more store bought ever again.  But there are a few things you should know when making it - first of all, when I first put the ingredients in the pot, the milk curdled and looked gross and it took a little while for it to set up correctly (just  a minute really, but I thought it would be faster to go from curdled looking to syrup looking and was worried that I had messed it up).  I also read the other reviews that mentioned how thin it ends up, so I took 1 tsp of cornstarch and added just enough water to make it liquid, then added it to the mix when I added the baking soda.  It was very foamy but still delicious.  My kids loved it.  I ended up eating a little later (you know, get them off to school and then get a chance to eat some waffles myself) and by that time, the syrup had cooled off, thickened up to about the same as store syrup, and lost all the frothiness. We'll see whether it will become a gel when it cools off completely - I tried to use just a little cornstarch to avoid that.  But whatever the form, frothy, syrupy or gel - this stuff is delicious. It does not taste like store bought stuff, but rather a buttery cinnamon syrup.  Much better and I didn't have to butter the waffles before the syrup because the butter was already in there!  All in all, a great recipe that will get written into my favorites recipe book.

The name of this recipe says it all!!! I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I used the substitute of 1C of milk to 1T of vinegar. I let that sit for 10 minutes and then I took out 1T of mixture since the recipe only calls for 1C of buttermilk. This turned out wonderful!!! It's definetly not your typical syrup but I'm not a fan of maple flavor so this was PERFECT for me. It is runny straight from the pan so if you have time to let it sit that helps! Just delicious! Thanks :-)

FANTASTIC!!!  Easy, Quick and wonderful taste!  I halved the recipe and my kids ate it all!  No more store bought syrup for us!  ***UPDATE*** I have made this several times now and want to let you know when adding the baking soda to the hot mixture it will bubble up a lot (do not leave it or it will boil over).  Also, we almost never have LEFTOVERS.  If you like a thicker syrup you need to let it cool. When it is hot it is very thin and can separate. It really thickens up nicely and has a beautiful caramel color.  I also make and serve mine right away but now I try and let it sit and cool for 10 minutes.  It does reheat well in the microwave  This would be GREAT used on a sundae, or as an apple dip.

I made a few changes according to other reviews. I slightly browned my butter, used 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and used only about 1/4 tsp soda and added a pinch of salt. WOW!!!!!! If you put it into a glass jar while still almost boiling and screw on the cap immediately and flip upside down for 5 min, it will seal! You can make it ahead and it won't spoil :))

Very good & caramelly. Used honey instead of corn syrup and kefir instead of buttermilk.

This is seriously *the best* syrup I have ever had. I made it exactly as writted except that I halved it. I made the syrup before I made the pancakes so it would have time to thicken up a little before serving. It was perfect! I loved it! I will only be making this syrup from now on! *Update: This really reheats well too!

I was incredibly leary about trying this recipe while reading the ingredients but decided to give it a whirl when I ended up out of syrup on pancake morning.  
I NEVER have buttermilk on hand so had to sub that with 2%milk mixed with 1 tb of lemon juice.  My kids and I really loved the flavor, the consistency kind of threw us, it is not thick at all, very runny but also not sticky as store bought syrups are.  
Overall very good recipe!  We enjoyed it and will use again, maybe instead of store-bought!

*Very* tasty pancake syrup!  We used it on waffles yesterday *and* then again today.  Kids and hubby *love* it!  Easy to make, just be sure to heed the directions and use a LARGE saucepan unless you want to be cleaning up gooey stickiness ;)

This doesn't make a THICK syrup, so if that's what you're looking for, keep looking.  If you're looking for YUM factor, you can stop looking :)

This is great. The recipe says to serve it warm, but I would suggest lukewarm to room temperature - it gives the foaming action some time to settle down and the syrup will thicken a bit. We had this on waffles with fresh strawberries. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and simple. Cooking time, in my opinion, should be increased until mix caramelizes and some moisture evaporates. After then the syrup does thicken nicely and it'll have a nice slight caramel taste.

This is just what the name says - absolutely the best.  I normally put fresh fruit or jam on my pancakes and waffles, but decided to give this a try on our Cinnamon Belgian Waffles this morning.  I wanted to lick my plate clean.  The only mistake I made was only making a half a batch.  I plan on making more very soon.  It's awesome!

This is SO yummy!  I can't imagine wanting store bought syrup again!  A couple members of my family started out with the store bought and thought they'd just TRY the homemade.  They loved it!  I made the Fluffy Pancake recipe found on this site also.  WONDERFUL!!  I did increase the cinnamon to 1/2 t.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is GREAT. Oddly, I hate maple anything so this is a great alternative! It was delicious, and my 6 year old said it was the best ever. My 1 year old got more IN her than ON her, always a sign that a recipe is a success (they both still needed baths after but that's how we roll with pancakes) SOOO glad for the advice to use a giant pot... would have made a huge mess if I hadn't read that! Update - made this for my honey and he said we're never buying syrup again. THAT is a good syrup. I halfed the butter (financial reasons, not health) and it's STILL good.

This was awesome! Skipped the corn syrup and used 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar. Made before the pancakes so it had time to cool and thicken. Everyone loved it (and kept sticking fingers into the pan to sneak tastes).

This was good but not something I'd make and eat regularly.  We eat pancakes/waffles/french toast about 3x a week and I can see eating this maybe a few times but not everytime.  My daughters absolutely loved the syrup and asked for more pancakes for it so it will be made again.

What did I do wrong??? I followed the recipe exactly. The aftertaste of the baking soda was unbearable. I'm in SUCH the minority here that I promise to give it one more try. I knew not to expect traditional syrup flavor; I had "Cinnabon" in mind. I sensed it was there, but as someone else said, the "carbonated" taste was overpowering.

Delish!!! I'm not really a big fan of maple flavor, so for me this syrup is perfect - tastes like a cinnamon roll. I was seriously licking the pan! ;-) it was runny when it was hot, but thickens up nicely once it cools - so make ahead if you can. Make sure you make it in a pan large enough to accommodate the increase in volume when you add the baking soda - it really foams up!  The bubbles disappear after it has cooled for a little.

Pretty good. Very easy to make and my family seemed to like it. Once it cooled down a bit it was not as thick and had some weird white chunks in it. Good to try for a change. Thanks!

I have made this several times and it is GREAT as is. However, the last time I made it I did do some substitutions. I used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup light brown sugar, 5 tbsp agave and 4 tbsp powdered buttermilk along with 1 cup water ( I omitted the corn syrup, left vanilla and cinnamon as is). I let it simmer for about 10 min stirring constantly. Then I added the baking soda. This method gave me a more 'syrup' like consistency and took off around 60 cal per serving.

Soooooo goooooooood!!! I, too, will never buy "store bought" again.  Used 1cup less 1tbsp 2% milk + 1 tbsp vinegar in place of the buttermilk and 1 1/2 tbsp brown sugar in place of the corn syrup.  After adding the baking soda, I continued to stir and cook until foam subsided(about 1 min)  Mine did not have the awful baking soda aftertaste that I was really sceptical of after reading other reviews.  Maybe the extra cooking helped, maybe not but mine was DELISH!!!!!!
I also doubled my cinnamon

This is a very rich syrup.  There's no maple so it's not really like traditional pancake syrup.  When I make this, I halve the recipe and mix it with half a recipe of the Maple-Vanilla Syrup.  Perfect!

Very good. Like others said, it doesn't taste like store bought syrup; more butter/cinnamon flavored. Even after I let it cool in the fridge it was still a little more runny than I would have liked. Maybe add a tsp. of cornstarch (per mixed with 1 tsp water) to it before adding the last baking soda step. That should thicken it up a bit.

This was awesome! Made as instructed according to receipe with no changes. Made it first then set aside to cool while making pancakes. After approx. 5 minutes syrup had thickened. We all loved it and the teenagers all said it was better then store bought.  Very easy to make.

Oh my god, this was SO good.  I left out the corn syrup, used 1/3 brown sugar and 2/3 white sugar, used powdered buttermilk, tripled the cinnamon, added a teeny bit of chai spice (by McCormick), and used a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with enough water to make it look like 2% milk. I just made it. I am making pancakes tomorrow (truck-stop buttermilk from this site), and I thought I'd make this the night before based on some reviews. Now I really wish I hadn't because this is truly perfect fresh. It's thick and sort of foamy, but in this really great amazing way.  The taste really is exactly like cinnamon rolls. It's a beautiful caramel colour. It is already starting to separate, and I'm hoping it will be okay once reheated/shaken up tomorrow. I'll update after breakfast. UPDATE: So I never updated, but... it was good the next day, but it was different. Not a bad different, just not as amazing as it was when it was fresh. I recommend using it fresh.

Had this syrup with homemade waffles for a brunch this AM. I did make it last night, then warmed it in the microwave before serving. Oh, my, goodness. It was a hit. Delicious. Guests said I should can it and sell it! My daughter wants to make homemade cinnamon rolls and use this as the icing. It really is good, and so simple!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is pretty good.  I wouldn't say it's the best.  I didn't have corn syrup, so I omitted it from the recipe.  I don't think it's needs it anyway as the syrup is really sweet without it, and the syrup thickens as it sits.  My husband and I thought it tasted like candy.

Amazing syrup! I served this with Oatmeal Pancakes II from this site,  for a brunch with friends. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I followed others suggestions and made it the night before, heated it up before serving, I also used extra cinnamon.
It just hit me what this syrup reminds me of, the inside of a really gooey cinnamon roll. It's delicious!

Very good syrup! This recipe is quite versatile too, try adding a couple tsp of either strawberry, almond or even rum extract to the mixture before adding the baking soda, use as a glaze to pour over cakes - like the Rum Cake II Recipe also found on this site (use the rum-butter glaze called for in that recipe too & follow that recipes instructions) then after you flip the cake out of bundt pan, drizzle some of this on top use the rum extract for this version of course! You can also add heavy whipping cream to this recipe for a great fruit dip. For those of you who prefer more of a maple syrup sub. dark brown sugar (dark has more molasses than light) and/or simply add some maple extract to the ingredients.  Definitely great to jar & give as gifts! The possibilities are endless with this base recipe. Thank you so much for sharing Melissa,
Lucy

Perfection!  My husband said he liked this even better than maple syrup. the best part is that I always have these ingredients on hand (I used powdered buttermilk) and it's so much cheaper than maple syrup!

I ran out of pancake syrup yesterday and didn't have time to go to the store, so I reluctantly looked up a recipe for one, thinking that there was no way you could actually make yummy homemade syrup. Boy, was I wrong. This stuff is HEAVENLY. I made a few changes though. I halved the recipe, used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and substituted honey for corn syrup, because I didn't have any on hand. I accidentely ended up adding too much cinnamon, but when I tasted it, it was PERFECT. I also made it the night before and stored it in an airtight container, and heated it up the morning after. Very rich, and very delicious. Perfect for those special breakfast occasions. But you should definitely limit yourself, because this stuff is a heart attack waiting to happen. (Not that that's a bad thing).

This was much better than I thought it would be! The sound of buttermilk and baking soda together for pancake syrup sounded disgusting, but it was really good. Just wish it was thicker. I even let it simmer at low heat for 5 minutes to help it thicken. It didn't state wether it should be white sugar or brown so I used white.

I've used this site for over 5 years, many of those as a supporting member, and this is the first review I've written.  My husband is a food snob so I was reluctant to try this recipe on him when he was craving pancakes this morning.  We don't buy grocery-store syrup - we buy the real thing online from Vermont but we were out it.  I gave this recipe a try and was really surprised at how good it tasted.  As for my husband?  He is drinking the syrup straight from the pan as we speak.  'Nuff said.

Loved this! I'm only confused as to the real purpose of the baking soda. Yes it provides foaminess but other than that I don't see it's purpose. I would double this recipe, omit the baking soda and make it thicker with some corn starch and water. The flavor can't be beat however. Next time I will try without baking soda and see if it is the magic yet subtle ingredient.

"Absolute Best" sure is correct!  This pancake syrup was wonderful!  My first time making my own pancake syrup and it was delish!  I didn't have buttermilk, so I just used a mixture of milk and half/half with a touch of lemon juice and it was perfect.  Letting the mixture cool really thickens it up nicely.  It makes a lot and I have a container of it remaining in the fridge for the next time.  After letting it cool in the fridge for a few hours has really made it extra thick and its pretty much just as thick as the bottles of syrup that you buy in the grocery.  I served this over pumpkin pancakes and it paired so well together!  Thanks for this great recipe!

Guess what??? I forgot to put in the buttermilk at the beginning, I ended up having to do it at the end AFTER I had already put in the baking soda and taken it off the heat.  It STILL turned out delicious!!!  I think this is DEFINITELY a keeper.  *UPDATE* I have now made this over 10 times since I found it less than 6 months ago.  This is absolutely the best and only syrup I will use from now on!! *Update again* I LOVE THIS SYRUP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After reading some of the reviews I was a little nervous about making this but, it turned out really good.  I think if you cook it for a few minutes instead of 10 seconds it gets rid of the baking soda taste.  I liked it better the next day.  I will definitely be making this again.

This pancake syrup is wonderful.  I did the recipe as is except added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/4 because i like my food very flavorful.  This syrup makes your pancakes taste like a cinnamon roll.  YUMMMY!

I just had to have pancakes today, and I realized I didn't have any maple syrup!!!   This recipe was a great substitute!  I still prefer traditional maple syrup, but I would definitely make this again if I run out.  If you are the type that buys "fake maple" syrup anyways, you should definitely try this.  It tastes better and its way healthier! (maybe not healthier from a calorie count perspective,but think, this has no preservatives or funny names you can't pronounce!)

Really tasty.  After reading the reviews I reduced the sugar and opted for the brown/white sugar combo (1/4 brown, 1/2 white).  Did have a lot of foam but passing it through a strainer helped. This is great on ice cream, waffles, pancakes and drizzled over fruit and yogurt.

Very very sweet, but my kids absolutely loved it!  Also, no high fructose corn syrup, which is a huge plus.  I used honey for the corn syrup, and a kefir type milk for the buttermilk.

It has a good flavor until the "carbonated" flavor hits your tongue.  I found this to be completely unusable.  I tried keeping it in the fridge overnight, did not help.  I will try adjusting the recipe to see if the baking soda flavor goes away, but as is, the recipe is not to my liking.

Wish I could rate this 10 stars!  My picky 12 year old told me, "You better get on Allrecipes and tell them that this was AWESOME syrup. You shouldn't ever buy the bottled stuff again." I followed the recipe exactly.  Good thing I doubled the waffle recipe so we can enjoy this again tomorrow!

Amazing! Delicious! Outstanding flavor! Very runny though until it cools and then it only thickens slightly but the flavor is so yummy! Not to mention, this literally takes no longer than 10 minutes to make. What a fabulous way to start the day!

This is good- really good!  Especially if you are feeding a large crowd! But if your family eats pancakes only occasionally or you are not feeding a huge crowd, than most of the syrup will end up being thrown away, as it should not be kept for more than a few days in the fridge.  And parts of it will get hard in the fridge & therefore need reheating in the microwave.

A few days ago, I rated this a 3. I'm amending my rating now that I've figured out the cooking time a bit better. The ingredients together are AMAZING and I give them 5 stars. But the cooking time? 0 stars. After you've put together everything but the baking soda, let it cook on medium-high heat until syrupy (about 10 minutes). Then follow the rest of the instructions.

DELICIOUS! Used 3/4c sugar instead of 1c. Added 2T maple/agave syrup (Trader Joe's) instead of 1T of corn syrup. Added 1/2 a pinch of nutmeg. Added 1/4t cornstarch to thicken.

I was skeptical especially while making this but I admit that I prefer it to artificial store bought syrup AND even real maple syrup flavor-wise. I will make this again especially for company. I allowed it to cool down until it was only just warm. I made my own buttermilk using milk and lemon juice since I didn't have any on hand and was already making some for the pancakes (fluffy pancakes - also a recipe from this site). Aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly.

Delicious. Very rich and buttery. I too used the milk/vinegar substitute for the buttermilk. Unfortunately, this was too rich for my husband's tastes. :(

awesome syrup! the foam from adding the baking soda is pretty major, but i used my largest saucepan, and it didn't overflow. i simmered it for 5 minutes and got a really good flavor and consistency. i removed it from the pan after the bubbles had subsided and poured it into a mason jar. it fit perfectly :)

I don't get what all the hype is about. I followed the recipe exactly as written, made no changes. It was okay... just nothing I'd make again or rave about. I like the real maple syrup SO much better, and it's a lot healthier than this butter filled syrup. Won't make this again.

phenomenal!  truly one of the best recipes on this site.  I probably added closer to 1/2 t cinnamon; used lemon juice+skim milk to make buttermilk; also boiled ~5 mins to thicken before adding soda.  Served with Fluffy French Toast & a glass of cold milk for a great snow day breakfast.  Next time we'll add some rum and serve with ice cream. Yum!

Awesome! I followed the recipe exactly except I added more cinnamon to my taste. So much nicer than the overly sweet store bought stuff. This is a definite keeper and will be used often in my home.

AWESOME!!!!!  Like a couple of other reviews, I added more cinnamon and 1 tsp of cornstarch.  Tastes much like a warm cinnamon roll withouth the work.  Thanks for sharing.

I have to agree with the reviewer about the carbonated taste.  That REALLY bothered me.  But otherwise the taste was wonderful.  I wish I had read her review ahead of time, then I could have avoided that!  Be sure to make this a day ahead and refrigerate it as she suggested.  Or maybe I'll just leave out the baking soda and see what happens.

This is so good! I didn't change a thing. It was a little runny for me though, but I think if I cook it a little longer next time it will fix that problem. Thanks so much for sharing! Will definitely make this again!

Mmm mmm good! I made this to use when I found the recipe for griddlecakes on this site. I didn't have any baking soda, and it still came out great. Made the pancakes taste like cinnamon bun pancakes. The family loved it! Will definitely make again!

Ok...after making this syrup  about 10 times now, I have to say that my boys will not eat anything else.  They would rather not even have waffles or pancakes if I don't make the syrup to go with it.  I've started making it bulk.  I usually double or triple the recipe and put it in a jar and keep it in the fridge...then warm it up right before serving.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!!!!!!

UPDATE: Every Friday I host a pancake/waffle breakfast for my son's entire x-country team and they insist I make the syrup.  None of them will eat the regular store bought stuff anymore. Thanks again!!!!!!!!!!

Sooo quick and easy to make! I've been trying to cut back on foods with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and there are absolutely no syrups in the grocery store without it, with the exception of pure maple.  The 1T of corn syrup in here has way less HFCS than a jar of syrup at the store.  I will use this recipe from now on instead of store bought!  My kids and myself gobbled it up, it was delicious!

Incredibly good ... It reminds me of the syrup they serve at Clinton St Bakery in NYC (best pancakes I have had to date) ....  I made minor alterations: 1/2 milk, 1/4 vinegar and 1/4 water instead of the 1 cup buttermilk. Also I added 1/4 tsp of maple extract. I ditched the corn syrup.

I also use this syrup to make monkey bread.  Quarter your 2 cans of fridge biscuits, dredge them in cinnamon sugar and place in a bundt pan and then pour about 1 cup of this pancake syrup on, bake at 350 for about 30 minutes. You can find the monkey bread recipes on this site, but I advise using this syrup to the others recommended.

I adapted this wonderful treat by substituting Splenda for the sugar. I did up the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp after reading other reviews. This way, I could enjoy a liquid Cinabon along with the rest of my family. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I made this one time and we just loved it! My husband and kids were all saying, "Mmmm" with every bite.  The next time I made pancakes my kids asked for the 'ice cream syrup'! This syrup is the reason I now keep butter milk in my fridge.

wow. I never  thought I could make pancake syrup, let alone one better than any store bought! I halved the recipe since I didn't need very much, and used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar, dark corn syrup, and for buttermilk in a pinch I used 1/2butter 1/2half n half. I always add extra cinnamon and vanilla to recipes for personal preference. Will DEFINATELY make again!

The taste is amazing.  I've made it with the milk and it was great but I also made it with water b/c my sister was visiting who is sensitive to dairy.  It tasted just as good.  I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar to give it more of a caramel color.  It was great and great for the non-dairy drinkers!  Way better than anything store bought.  I might drop the corn syrup next time just because its a GMO food and see how it goes.

Super easy and completely delicious!  I didn't change a thing....it is somewhat "runny" so I warned people before they used it....I served it right from the stove and it didn't have a chance to sit so maybe it could have thickened a bit more.  So yummy!!!!

I don't like Maple Syrup much so this was exactly what I was looking for.  It's not your typical thick, sticky syrup, but the flavor is AMAZING!  My family said they don't want 'the other' syrup again.

Oh so delicious ! I'm almost too ashamed to report I consumed a few "shots" of syrup straight-up ( sans pancakes ) as I had no self-control. I dare not keep this concoction around. I read other reviews and made this in a super deep container: my pasta pot as it expanded in volume tremendously.

The only change I did was added a little fresh vanilla bean since I had one that needed used. Otherwise I followed recipe exactly and it was wonderful. My teenage son said no more store bought syrup! Thanks for a great recipe.

How did others got thin/runny syrup?? Ours was so thick it was more of a glaze.  I'm thinking maybe it's how long you simmer it that makes a difference. (Also, we tasted NO baking soda after taste, and it only foamed up an inch, not like the volcano others implied.)  I made it exactly as the recipe indicated and it was delicious, but too thick to be called syrup. It's so delicious I am not complaining, I'll just simmer it less time next time.  But the recipe really is perfect, and fast to make.  I'll never buy syrup again.

Everyone loved this recipe, but it reminded me of caramel icing (like for a caramel cake) and nothing like syrup.  It was good, but if I want all the extra butter (which I love) I'll bake a cake next time.

This is wonderful stuff!! I didn't have any milk or buttermilk so used straight evaporated milk. And I added 1/2 tsp clear jell to the sugar before adding the wet ingredients. I also only used half the soda. It was the best i had ever had!

Um...Amazing. I made pancakes for my roommate this morning only to discover that (gasp) we only have sugar free syrup! My roommate is a semi health nut, so we only had "I can't believe it's not butter" and I substituted honey for corn syrup. It still came out amazing. He's calling it crack syrup. Can't wait to make it again, this time the right way.

Fantastic recipe! Imagine the pan after the cinnamon rolls are all gone - that's what this is like.  It's more like a cinnamony, buttery,  vanilla-y glaze.  Excellent and very very fast and easy.  So good!

What a great and delicious alternative to maple syrup Melissa! The only thing I may do differently next time is cut back on the sugar as I found it just a little too sweet. Added more cinnamon than called for and (blush) stupidly used baking powder instead of the soda! Ha! No matter because it turned out great anyway. This syrup went perfectly with Pumpkin Pancakes from this site. Thank you Melissa!!

This was super tasty! I am only rating it 4 stars because I had an issue with it curdling for some reason (I used all fresh ingredients) and I had to strain it through a fine sieve to remove the curdled bits. Other than that this was VERY nice. I also doubled the cinnamon and was glad I did. I will make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is my absolute favorite syrup recipe. It's easy to make, uses simple ingredients, and tastes delicious; the only problem is that it's not very thick. However, that doesn't bother me, because it tastes too good to mind.

Very good recipe. My fiance said it reminded her of Snickerdoodles. She put bananas on her pancakes and this over top. I really enjoyed it as well. Was definitely a bit sweeter then regular maple syrup, and was a bit thin but over all was quite tasty.

My family LOVED this syrup.  My kids said it made their pancakes taste like a churro, so they have now dubbed this "churrup."  My husband, a huge maple syrup fan, says he might never go back to his old favorite.

This did remind me of a cinnamon roll as one post that I read.  I really liked it.  It was a nice variation from traditional pancake syrup.  I also made a mock buttermilk from milk and vinegar and it worked fine. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 is that the consistency is a little thicker than I am used to.  And, with the butter and buttermilk in the syrup the fridge life is not as long as other syrups, I believe.  But, I will probably make again, but half the recipe for myself.  Thanks for submitting.

This is a bit too rich and sweet for me. It tastes like a cinammon roll. Great thick consistency-no need for cornstarch as some have recommended.

I made this the other day when I realized I was almost out of real maple syrup.  We all liked the taste, but it was pretty foamy.  Just for us that was fine.  I refrigerated it overnight and warmed it the next morning - it stayed a bit foamy.  Not sure how to clear it.  Any ideas?  I'd make it again in a pinch.

this was awesome!  Note, I started out making an apple syrup before I stumbled on this recipe.  I added three small apples, peeled and cut in to bite sized pieces.  Also, I did not have buttermilk, so I added a little lemon juice to both keep the apples from turning brown and to sour the milk a bit.  I was afraid of the baking soda after taste, so I used only 1/4 tsp, and this worked well. Finally, as someone else suggested, I used 1 tsp cornstarch with just enough water to liquify.  Yummy, my family kept asking for more!

This syrup was fabulous. It is not your traditional maple syrup and it is nice for a change. Easy to make. I just store leftovers in the fridge and warm it up in the microwave.

I decided to give this a try because I always have 1 cup of buttermilk left after making Buttermilk Pancakes II from this site.  It took a little encouragement to get my family to try it because they only like Aunt Jemima, but it went over well and I only had a little bit left.  It really does foam up and I was glad I had time to let it sit for a little while so the foam could settle before serving.  I have to admit that I used a spoon to get the last bit of syrup off of my plate.  A keeper!!

Absolutely delicious. I've been making this off and on for a year now just never got around to rating...  I make this and put the extra into a Good Seasons dressing bottle, in the fridge.  Then reheat in the microwave without the lid for the next time.  There's not any leftovers after that...  :)  Makes your pancakes taste like cinnabons!

This recipe is so easy and so darn delicious!  My kids loved this, which blew me out of the water because they're so used to Mrs. Butterworth.  Cinnamonny and sweet, tasted like a cinnamon roll with icing!  I did half the recipe and made subsitution for the buttermilk and added just a wee bit more cinnamon.  Will make this again for sure!

Wow...excellent!  I made a couple of adjustments, since I was making it for a sugar and fat-conscious client of mine.  I mixed up some fat-free powdered milk; and I used 1/8 cup of Xylitol for the sweetner.  Yummy stuff!  Thanks!  YourHealthCoach4Life

half my family like this the other half didn't care for this, but since I'm reviewing it, I LOVE this syrup, it's sooo yummy, I want more.  The half of my family that didn't care for it are not too thrilled with cinnamon in the first place, so if you don't care for cinnamon you may not like this, I also doubled the cinnamon, it's SOOOOOO yummy.  definitely try it - also, let the syrup cool for at least 1/2 hour before you use it, if you use it right away you'll get the baking soda taste, I was afraid it would be baking soda-y when I wanted to use it but it wasn't, so definitely let it sit for a little bit on the counter.

My son made this the other night. It came out great. My only complaint is that it needs to be thicker. Does anyone have any suggestions? I think flour or cornstarch would ruin the taste. Great Syrup! We will be making again!

Wonderful! Made to directions the first time, we loved it, like warm cinnamon ice cream, but it made me think of all kinds of things I could change to make it a little diffrent. We will use it for ice cream, and all kinds of desserts!

Very good! I used milk + vinegar for the buttermilk. In my opinion, it's best when very fresh because it's warm and foamy...delish!

Agreed, GodivaGirl - We, too, will never use store bought again.  My only complaint (and probably my own mistake) was the frothiness of this.  Way foamier than the picture.  But the taste was beyond anything I can even describe, so I didn't care about the consistency or aesthetic.

This was really really delicious..I added two drops of butter rum flavoring, just for kicks, and it turned out heavenly.  We will never purchase store bought syrup again.  I was out of buttermilk so I made my own using  regular milk and added two Tbsp of white vinegar....it turned out perfect.
*Be sure and use REAL butter in this recipe. I tried this with margarine and it was not nearly as good.

RIch!! Undeniable Cinnabon® smell, simmering in the pan the smell is incredible. Very buttery, obviously its got a lot of butter in it. I didn't have buttermilk and used 2% soured with lemon juice. I used half brown and half white sugar as others have. I used "golden syrup" instead of corn syrup, which wasn't in the cupboard.  After adding the bicarb soda I chose to cook for 5 minutes rather than 10 seconds as the recipe says. Stirring vigorously during that time, all the foaming people talk about subsides. This resulted in a much thicker consistency, like gravy, in Australia it'd be called "topping". Perhaps cooked for a shorter time would give a more desirable thinner consistency. Upon cooling, the sodium taste (bicarb/baking soda) is apparent but I didn't notice whilst still hot.  I give 5 stars, but honestly would give 4.5 stars, because it tastes so good on pancakes that after eating a lot of it I felt sick in my stomach (probably all that butter). Pace yourself.

Holymotherofgawd is this amazing!  Just be sure to make it ahead of time so the froth has time to subside. I used half brown sugar and half white, and added two dashes of salt. Bazinga!

Absolutely fabulous as the name and everyone else says. I wasn't sure what to expect - it's thinner than regular syrup. It bubbled up after the baking soda, but the bubbles will subside in a bit. If you let it sit, it separates, but will swish back together easily.

Absolute Best, I wouldn't call it.  It is a creamy, sweet topping to use for pancakes or the like.  I made it as the recipe directs except I used brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup for personal dietary issues.  Certainly a viable alternative to traditional pancake syrups, but not a replacement.  Thanks for the recipe.

!!! This is the best syrup I have had, bar none! I doubled the recipe and it filled a quart sized mason jar plus a little more. I put in 3/4 of the vanilla and topped it off with maple extract. This gives it a flavor similar to a Cinnabon without it being as sweet. We are trying to eat real, less processed foods so this is good minus the corn syrup. I will try it next time without it just to see the difference. Apart from that I wouldn't change a thing!!! :)

I have never rated recipes, but I just had to give you props on this. I am a chef on a charter yacht, and I make this recipe every week on pancake morning. Everyone BEGS me for the recipe! :) In the three years I have been making this, I have had only one child ask me for bottled pancake syrup instead. That says a lot! Now I have made a couple alterations that are not critical: I never have buttermilk on hand, so I make it with 1C milk and 1T lemon juice, also I don't like honey or corn syrup, so I have been using vanilla agave syrup instead. Cheers!

This recipe turned out alright.  I ran out of syrup one morning and I was not wasting gas to get syrup so I decided to make this since I had everything on hand.  I loved the buttery taste.  I think the only change I will make next time is not add the cinnamon.

I made this for the first time this morning. It's as good as the rave reviews say! Be warned though; a 2-qt saucepan is not big enough to make this in. That's what I used and it foamed over as soon as I added the baking soda. This recipe is a keeper. I want to give some as gifts. It's that good! Thank you, Melissa, for sharing.

WOW! I had to substitute milk and vinegar for the buttermilk, so I only made half a batch due to low expectations, but now I wish I'd tripled it. I followed it exactly other than adding a splash of bourbon to it in the beginning and I held off on the vanilla until I took it off the heat. My boyfriend (a pancake connoisseur) and I both agree this is better than maple syrup.

This was freaking amazing!!! Had to substitute milk and vinegar for the buttermilk (ran out while making the pancakes lol) and honey for the corn syrup (mine...expired). I will NEVER buy store syrup ever again. Do be careful though: it IS very addicting. It's like liquid cinnamon rolls. Thanks very much for the recipe.

This syrup was simply Smack-yer-Mama good. But seeing as it was Mothers Day and, and I'm from the North, I refrained both from calling her "Mama" and from smacking her. Regardless, everyone at brunch agreed that this was just amazing, and you know to believe such reviews when folks are complaining they're full, but they're still sitting at the table eating this by the spoonful. 

I had none of the problems anyone else reported; while it will indeed get foamy, if you're used to making caramel corn (which I do constantly... sort of a culinary tic of mine) you know how to give it room and gently coerce it into submission. To wit: a firm but not overly aggressive whisking off-heat will help calm it down. And if the aesthetics of serving it are vexing you, what little foam remains skims off easily with a cool, dry spoon.

My real reason for sticking in my two cents is to share that I, being totally dairy intolerant, made buttermilk of good, creamy Almond Milk with a spoon of white vinegar, and I substituted a high-quality natural margarine for the butter.

Not only was it amazing (and doubly so for me, who could partake if not guiltlessly then at least painlessly), but my guests could not stop eating this version either, which was almost imperceptible in its difference from the Mother Syrup.

This syrup is perfect over heartier breakfast sweets, like strata, bread puddings (shoot me now, I beg you) and stuffed French toasts. Also on grilled, buttered bread.

Thank you for this.

Absolutely delicious. Used 1 cup milk with a tablespoon of viniger instead of buttermilk. Added a heaped tsp of cornflour to thicken it up after reading the reviews. This will definitely be a staple in my house. Need to find some time to make pancakes in the mornings now!

I wish I could give this recipe more than five stars, I would give it ten! I absolutely love this stuff. I made the recipe exactly as given (except that I dropped the cinnamon)and I had no problem whatsoever with a baking soda "taste". I am guessing those who did may not have measured accurately. Use exact measurements and level off your spoons and cups with a straight-edged utensil. Many dry ingredients tend to settle. Always "fluff" your dry ingredients using a fork or whisk (with the exception of regular sugar and salt) before measuring and use a different spoon to drop your dry ingredients into your measuring cups and spoons, then level off with a straight-edged utensil (I use an old metal frosting spatula). I agree with some of the other reviewers that advised making this before making your pancakes. NOTE: This is not going to be as thick as that yucky corn syrup based store-bought stuff. Don't expect any homemade syrups to be thick, they just won't be, but they taste heavenly! Cook in a large enough pot, as it does "expand" during the cook. I actually had enough to last a little over a week, since it was just me using it. The leftovers (if you have any) will separate into layers, which all you have to do is give it a good shake (mine in a mason jar) before pouring the amount you intend to reheat.
A head's up to any of you who make bread pudding. The flavor of this would make an excellent sauce, and I intend to use it with the next bread pudding I make! YUMMY :)

This stuff is sooo good!! It's like eating the topping of a Cinnabon. My husband who is not a sweets person actually eats it by the spoonful:) Due to allergies, I cannot have milk or soy so I substitute almond/coconut milk and Earth Balance soy free margarine and double cinnamon and it's delicious. I make a double batch and keep it in the fridge. It lasts for a couple of weeks, no problem. Such a good recipe that I actually stopped buying syrup!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!!  I was making breakfast for supper last night and realized after the store had closed that we didn't have any syrup for the pancakes.  I decided to see if i couldn't find a recipe to make some myself since i love to bake and cook anyway.  This recipe was easy and the family loves it!!

This is ABSOLUTELY the MOST FABULOUS syrup ever.  I don't want to eat any waffles or pancakes anymore without this syrup. I ask my hubby to make it for me on the weekends while I mix up the waffle batter and then the magic comes together. Ahhhhh....Bliss in my mouth.

GREAT buttery-caramel flavour, the consistency is a bit thin, but if it's let to rest for a few minutes, it thickens a bit. Great after put in the fridge too. Definitly a keeper!

There is no reason now for me to buy any type of syrup. This is our homes syrup of choice. My grandkids refuse to eat pancakes or waffles without it. Absolutely Excellent!!! As others have said it is best if left to set over night before using it. It gives the flavors time to meld together. YUMMY!! Thanks for an awesome diet breaker...lol

I agree with the foam problem--not sure why the baking soda is even added but it creates a major amount of strange foam that's not "normal" for pancake syrup.  The taste of the syrup was really good but the foamy part was strange.

Very easy to make. Tastes good. Just keep in mind it isn't claiming to be a maple syrup clone. Very buttery tasting, in a good way! kinda caramelly tasting. We all liked it.

The only change I made was to use maple flavoring instead of vanilla. And I left out the cinnamon.

This was pretty much amazing.  It's almost like icing and made my pancakes taste like dessert.  As others said, it ends up being a little bit runnier than traditional maple syrup.  A little cornstarch can help that, but don't use too much or the texture gets a little grainy.

This is to die for! I was so impressed how good this turned out. Bye Bye bottled syrup. I made the day before I needed so when I went to use the next day I was able to take off all the "fat" from the top. Reheated perfectly.

Meh. OK, I guess.... I'm in the minority here, I know. Made this syrup to accompany Fluffy Pancakes (Kris). I made breakfast for my "Valentine" yesterday, and wanted to make everything from scratch (hence the search for a GOOD pancake and syrup recipe!). Although I didn't dislike this, I didn't think it was WOW either. And, I felt that the cinnamon roll comparison everyone is raving about was barely noticeable, IMHO. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem with my syrup boiling over, but that could be because I was expecting it (I read the first couple pages of most helpful reviews beforehand). Oh, and I too allowed my syrup to cool a bit, but it didn't seem to take care of the foam issue (I let it sit while making pancakes).... I like my syrup warm, so I'm not sure that this was a good idea for me. One last thing to note. If you do not have buttermilk (who keeps this readily available????), just add 2 T vinegar or lemon juice to 1 c. WHOLE milk. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes or so (it will begin to curdle). Anywhoo... is this good? Yes. Would I make it again? Probably not. Thanks for sharing and have a very happy Valentine's Day! :-)

Delicious!  I made one change, using brown sugar instead of white, as I had ran out making waffles.  Very tasty, if, as other reviewers have said, a bit strangely foamy.  Will use again!

We ran out of syrup and I had seen this recipe so I quick pulled it up and made it....WOW!  I'm so glad I was "forced" into making this!  My husband LOVED it and so did the kids.  It made our pancakes taste like cinnamon rolls!  What a treat!

Sure does make the pancakes taste like a Cinnabon! Easy to make and very good. Wouldn't eat it on my pancakes every day, but for a special breakfast it really is VERY good.

Pretty good.  I didn't have any syrup on hand, and this did the trick.  I agree with others though that it needs to sit for a bit before using in order to thicken up some.

Never made my own syrup before. This was excellent....a little on the thin side, but still SO good. Followed the recipe exactly. Be prepared when adding the baking soda....it foams up big time! I let mine cool before we had it on Moms Buttermilk Pancakes (from AR). Thanks for the recipe. I'll be using this one again.

I was a little worried about how the buttermilk would make this taste, but I had nothing to worry about!  This was the most amazing thing I have ever tasted.  We are going to freeze some of the leftovers to see how that does.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I made this simply because I was looking for a use for some buttermilk that I needed to use. YUM! If you are hesitating to try this recipe, DON'T, you won't be sorry. Hubby wants it all the time now, only with a little maple flavor.  Next time I will use 2 t vanilla and 1 t maple flavoring. Thank you for a great recipe.

This was the best syrup i've ever had. I am not a fan of traditional maple syrup nor do I care for the fruity syrups. This recipe will be a family favorite for sure.

You MUST try this. It was amazing. Don't let the color from the picture scare you. It isn't dark brown or thick like store bought syrup but the flavor is out of this world. I made according to recipe & also added 1/4 tsp maple flavor. Served over Stuffed French Toast II from this site. It was a restaurant quality meal without the price. A for-sure way to WOW everyone.

I was not sure about ths recipe, because of the color in the picture.  But I made it, the first words out of the mouth of both of my kids was "this is soooo gooood".  I think it tastes pretty good, especially with plain pancakes. If you like blueberries or other additions in your pancakes this sweet cinnamon syrup may not be the best. But overall we really loved it.  No changes, no additions. Thanks.

Eh, I was a little disappointed with this recipe after reading so many rave reviews. I definitely increased the amount of cinnamon after giving it a taste, but the separated buttermilk just really turned me off. However, maybe the buttermilk in Ireland is "real" buttermilk and hence the difference... will try again back in the states.

This syrup was wonderful.I love anything with buttermilk in it, and this was great. After reading other reviews, I left out the cinnamon because I wanted maple, added 1/2 tsp. maple extract along with the vanilla, and also added 1 tsp. of cornstarch to help speed up the thickening. I didn't have much time to let it cool and set up. And I used brown sugar instead of white. It tasted like a buttermilk praline!!! Maybe next time I'll add some chopped pecans. I didn't use quite as much soda as it called for and couldn't see where it made much difference.

This is the best syrup ever!!! Never again will I be buying store bought syrup.  The other reviews were absolutely right when they said it tastes like a liquid cinnamon roll. Yum. Yum. Yum. (Be sure you use a large saucepan to contain all the froth and foam.)

Excellent....but, dosen't look or taste like the traditional syrup (if that's what you are looking for).  I think it was better!  Just be careful to heat it in a pan that will be big enough, because when you add the baking soda it will bubble up and at least double in size before shrinking back down.

This was really good.  We didn't really think of it as syrup though.  My husband made it while I was making pancakes and he agreed that its amazing but he says it should be put on top of cinnamon rolls, not really a syrup.  Ours never really got thick either.  The butter was separating from the cinnamon and sugar even when we let it sit out.  Still very good, just not what we expected as a syrup.

Very tastey...I didnt have buttermilk so I tried to make some with milk (skim was all I had) and 1TB cream of tarter. I tried to follow other reviews in trying to make the syrup thicker...letting it cool, adding corn starch...but it was still really runny. I guess Ill just have to keep making this to perfect that! That was my only real complaint.

This was wonderful.  I'd never made syrup before but it was much more flavorful than store-bought syrup and very fun to make.  I used a 4.5Qt saucepan and it handled the foaming fine, and I'm glad I listened to that suggestion.  Followed the recipe exactly.  :D  Thanks so much!

tasted like werther's candy, only a little sweeter and melted.  after minutes away from heat, syrup separates into layers.  mixing often is necessary after away from heat.

This syrup is amazing! I’ve been using this recipe for over 2 years. I usually substitute regular milk for the buttermilk and honey for the corn syrup just because that is what I keep on hand. You definitely want to use a much larger pot than what you would expect. I reuse a Hungry Jack Syrup container to store this syrup in the refrigerator for easy reheating. Try it, you’ll love it.

I made this buttermilk syrup exactly as written.  Be sure to bring your syrup to a simmer, little bubbles bursting around the edge of the pan, and be sure to cook the 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda for at least 10 seconds, or even for 20 seconds, after your syrup has come to a simmer and it will cook off any possible after-taste of baking soda.  The longer this cools after cooking, the thicker the syrup becomes and most of the foaming subsides and leaves behind a buttery caramel syrup kissed by cinnamon!  This syrup is a divine indulgence and so easy to make that we may find ourselves splurging more often!  That first bite was heaven; but did we stop there?!  Oh, absolutely not!  As the author noted, this is so good that you may actually find yourself licking the plate!  Thank you, Melissa, for sharing your treasure with all of us!  How on earth did I get to be 60 years old without ever having tasted buttermilk syrup?!  This stuff is brilliantly YUMMY!  Thank you so much, Melissa!

No changes. Using at least a 4 cup pan is a must because of the baking soda foaming action. But my kids wanted to eat the syrup straight from the pan. (With all that sugar, who wouldn't?) Definitely a keeper!

ya know - i was skeptical about this recipe....but should you find yourself in that dire scenario with cooked pancakes and no syrup — this is a 5 minute recipe that’s pretty darn delicious and can salvage breakfast!

Absolutely amazing.  We use splenda instead of sugar and we do not add the baking soda....still PERFECT!   Lasts in the refrigerator for a long time and heats up well.   Thanks for sharing.

We were running low on pancake syrup, but wanted to have them for dinner one night. I found this recipe and tried it just as it is here. OH MY GOSH!!!! I had to make a second batch of it so that I had some for my pancake after my boys were full. They all LOVED it. We are thinking about using this instead of store-bought syrups. It was awesome!

I loved it. The only things I did differently is I used 1teaspoon of baking powder instead of baking soda and I used powder buttermilk. I was eating plain cheesecake and i must say it is really good on cheesecake.

This was sooo good! My 6, 5, and 2 year olds are all about syrup and I wasn't sure what they'd think, but they all loved it. I didn't have any buttermilk so I did the ole milk+vinegar trick. It smelled strongly of vinegar when it cooked so I was concerned, but it tastes delicious. It is a bit thin like others have reviewed but it still worked for us.

This recipe was very bland and not at all sweet. I’ll try adding brown sugar next time an maybe that will add what ever is missing. If it turns out bland again I will be throwing out this recipe

This syrup is delicious! If you’re out of syrup like I was try this recipe, you won’t be disappointed. Didn’t have buttermilk on hand so used 1 Tbsp in a cup of milk and let sit to make sour milk. Worked well this way!!

I have made this a few times already. My boyfriend and I love it! I don't change any ingredients, I follow it exactly. It definitely is the best tasting syrup for pancakes, crepes, waffles, plain sponge cake even ice cream! I can't rave about this enough. So easy to make as well. Just a side note..I prefer to eat this after its been cooled for 30mins or so..when it's more settled and not as "foamy" (reaction from the baking soda) Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The syrup had a weird taste and my milk curdled very quickly.
I am sure other people have found out ways to make it better and I am young so I dont have to much cooking experience.

Absolutely the best syrup I have ever made! I followed the recipe except tossed in a bit more cinnamon. I will no longer be buying my syrup at the store. Very rich and buttery flavor.

Love this so much! I wanted pancakes but i didn't have enough syrup for everyone. I found this recipe but I also didn't have any corn syrup. (I know, right?) So I used what little bit of maple syrup i had instead of corn syrup and it turned out perfect!

BEEST SYRUP I HAVE EVER TASTED! It is worth way more  than five stars. I tried it and it rocked. Add more recipes and never give up. It is finger and pan licking good.

We try to not eat sugar in our house, so I made this with honey. I put about 1/2 cup honey instead of the sugar and corn syrup. It tasted great! Will be making this again.

Absolute best ever is right. The flavor is so unique and good! The foaming freaked me out at first, but once it sat overnight, it was delicious. Combined it with the french toast bake on this site, and no one could get enough!

My family loved this but I prefer maple syrup on pancakes.  It didn't thicken much even after cooling.  It tastes good and will be good on other things rather than pancakes.

A wonderful and simple recipe. My daughter who will not use pancake syrup of any kind, loves this. We call it 'cinnamon bun syrup'! I whisked it periodically as it cooled and had no issues with separation. We doubled the cinnamon.

Thanks for sharing this. It is amazing. I made it exactly as stated and the next time I added a splash of almond extract, either way it's a five star recipe in this house. All the family loved it and made it clear that store bought syrup will no longer be welcomed. Since it's crazy-easy to make, there's no complaints from the cook.

Have to admit I was skeptical about this recipe, but decided to try it based on the reviews.  I followed it exactly, and it is now "the" pancake syrup for our house.  The taste is amazing.  I found myself licking the spoon.  I'd recommend using a pan larger than you think you need - because when you add the baking soda, it foams - a lot.  Try this, you won't be disappointed.

I made this to serve over Veronica's Apple Pancakes, my goodness was it awesome! I halved the recipe and had leftovers, it makes a lot! I made soured milk for the buttermilk, honey for the corn syrup and doubled the cinnamon. Will definitely make again!

With this recipe as with most you have to account for taste sensitivity. I personally am extremely sensitive to the taste of baking powder. (Very bitter to me) Keeping that in mind when making this.  If you need more cinnamon add it, use less if not to your taste, same with the sugar and butter and you can even get by with a little less baking soda. You get best results using real buttermilk, you will have a thicker syrup. This is a naturally thin syrup but it packs a punch so you don't need it to be thick. This is a great recipe and my family uses it on everything and it does make toast taste like a cinnamon roll. I get requests for the recipe constantly.

This is the BEST syrup I've ever made.  It is so smooth and creamy with a fantastic taste.  My son thought it made his pancakes taste like a cinnamon roll.  I really like a little of it in my oatmeal.  I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change or add anything to the original recipe.  I store it in the refrigerator in a glass bottle that I can reheat in the microwave to warm it up.  I made this to go on 'Buttermilk Pancakes I' from AR.  Our bottle is almost empty and I will be making more to enjoy on our breakfast treats.  A wonderful recipe to use up some buttermilk.

Just made this syrup for the first time. I would eat a roof shingle with this stuff on it. I'm making yeast waffles in the morning. Can't wait to try it on those. It's like caramel butter cinnamon roll donut glaze.

I was hesitant to try this recipe.  My faborite syrup is out the market. I gave it a try this morning and for my surprise is super delish.  I made some changes, I use brown sugar instead of white, added vanilla and nutmeg.  I will never buy   another bottle od commercial syrup ever!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Made this in a pinch when I ran out of syrup one morning. It was delicious! My kids absolutely loved it. It tastes like liquid cinnamon rolls. Quite a nice change from the typical maple syrup. I will be making this again, although not too frequently as it isn't healthy in the least bit.

Delicious. Kids love this much better than regular store-boughtsyrup.  The leftovers store well in frig but congeals; so it needs to be rewarmed to thin.  I've been experimenting & like the leftovers better when I've used a little less flour than the recipe calls for.

I make this recipe exactly as written. It is the BEST! Never buy store syrup. Be sure to use a large pan...I didn't use a big enough one the first time and like a science experiment it overflowed all over the stove top. I just made it again to go over pumpkin pancakes on this site. I roasted pecan pieces to top it off! Thanks!

This was delicious! One of the negative reviews said she was hoping for a Cinnabon taste. To me it tasted very much like Cinnabon. I used brown sugar instead of white to make it more like caramel. When you add the baking soda, be prepared for it to foam up quite a bit, but after you let it sit for 5-10 minute the foam settles down. I served this over sweet potato pancakes and it was a big hit with everyone!

Just tried this. I had to substitute a few things and wanted to change the sugar to create a darker taste.  From my adapted recipe, I would change 2 things and suggest to not pre-butter whatever you will use this on.

Alternative Recipe for Best Syrup

1/4 to 1/3 c. Butter

1/2 c. White granulated sugar
1/2 c. Dark Brown Sugar
1 c. Lactose Free Milk (actually I would have used vanilla soy milk)
1 T Vanilla Extract
1 T Corn Syrup
1/4 to 1/2 t Ground Cinnamon
1/2 t baking POWDER (no metal taste)
1/2 t Flour (may use gluten free oat flour)

Cook as directed previously.  Turn heat down to medium. Then add the baking powder and the flour and whisk to combine.  Continue whisking and as syrup builds on sides of pan, wash it down with a pastry brush.  Cook a total of 5 mins longer than other recipe.  Cooking longer will result in liquid too thick to use as syrup.  Refrigerate after use.

Tasted great! Though, it was a little to much vanilla. I added a 1\8 tsp baking soda, 1\4 cup butter, 1 tbsp sour cream,1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp corn syrup additional to recipe. It balanced out the strong vanilla taste. But overall, great texture and flavor!!:)

Very simple and good. I typically don't like overly sweet things so I was concerned if I would enjoy this.  Put the fears away... This was excellent. Made it the night before and microwaved the next day for 20 secs in microwave. My new staple.

Luscious! I made the exact ingredients called for.  The only cooking method I changed was I let it cook a little longer than 10 seconds hoping it would darken the color (it did not and mine was very pale almost looked turkey gravy) and I added the vanilla after I took it off the heat.  It was fantastic and a nice change from the traditional maple syrup.  I won't replace it but will add it to the line up :)  I did make it ahead to let it cool & thicken prior to using.

Tried this after I ran out of maple syrup. It tastes like corn syrup. Next time, I will make caramel sauce instead.

Oh god yeah! drool... so good!! Warning, don't use small pot... it expands like crazy during the cooking process!! At least for me it did.
Not sure if that's just the way it is or because I use the milk and vinegar recipe to get buttermilk and have a reaction with baking soda.

She's not kidding about licking the pan! It's more work than my previous recipe, but SO worth it! I followed the directions exactly and am careful about adding the baking soda. I'm always in a hurry and have noticed that the butter will curdle if I try to melt it first before adding the buttermilk (milk + 1/2TBS vinegar). Add the ingredients all at once--except soda--and heat it. Yum!!

This turned out great! I didn't have corn syrup so I substituted agave and I still thought it tasted amazing. I halved the recipe and it was still more than enough syrup to go with a full recipe of the Fluffy Pancakes.

I tried this yesterday  for Shrove Tuesday. I figured if we are having pancakes for dinner let's do it right! The kids all LOVED this, me too!! If anyone has ever had those little cinnamon sticky pullaparts things at McDonalds, this tastes exactly the same. Now I want to make cinnamon roils and pour this over top.I subbed honey for the corn syrup and made sour milk with vinegar & milk( 1 TB vinegar plus milk to equal one cup total) instead of using buttermilk and it was awesome!!!!

Oh my goodness... This syrup is amazing! I have tried a few recipes, but now my search is over. My seven year old, who initially groaned about homemade syrup, said she wants this from now on instead of store bought. Thanks for such a great recipe!!

We ran out of store bought syrup awhile ago and never picked any up.  Craving pancakes I figured would give this a try and HOLY COW DELICIOUS! I added some maple Crown Royal to give it a maple flavor.  Husband said we will never buy syrup again.  Great recipe, Thank you.

This is such a delicious syrup!! I think someone else called it "liquid cinnabon" and that's exactly how it tastes!. The only things I do differently is up the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp and use homemade simple syrup (sugar and water) in place of the corn syrup. And I usually don't have buttermilk on hand so I just do the milk and vinegar thing. I have made this several times and never had the problem w/ tasting the baking soda that many ppl have had. I can't figure out why it doesn't work for them. Maybe try doing a little less than 1/2 tsp or even halving it to 1/4 tsp? It has come out great for me every time. I echo what many have said and have not bought store pancake syrup since finding this recipe. It's either this or the real deal maple syrup on my pancakes!

Based on other comments, I intended on leaving the baking soda out altogehter, but lost focus, and ended up adding 1/8 teaspoon in.  I'm not quite sure of the purpose of the baking soda in this recipie, so I'll probably omit it next time.

I added in 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

It tastes like pancake syrup, so I'm happy.

This recipe was excellent!  I subbed honey for corn syrup and milk & lemon juice for the buttermilk but only because those are what I had on hand.  It was so quick and easy.  So far, I have only tasted it when it was done cooking and it was excellent.  I know it will be awesome with pancakes for dinner!

This is a great recipe but I did make a couple of changes.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt.  I also used Dark corn syrup (it didn't specify which to use, light or dark).  It's really kind of cool how it fizzes up after adding the baking soda! My recipe version stayed frothy for a while. When refrigerated it thickened and frothiness disappeared.  Tastes great warm.

Only change was upping the cinnamon and decreasing the baking soda. It was perfect. Best served hot.

This syrup is truly delicious. After reading other reviews I decided to use a little less liquid in order to make it more "syrupy". So I only used 1/2 C of buttermilk. I also left out the cinnamon because I really didn't want it to taste like a cinnamon roll as everyone says it does. It was great! I was worried about the baking soda after taste that some mentioned, but there was absolutely none. I wonder if maybe it just tastes a little too sour with a full cup of buttermilk. I may have to experiment and see if that is the case, but for now I will just use my tweaks and keep the kiddos happy.

Given all the rave reviews, this recipe was a HUGE letdown. My issue wasn't with the foamy baking soda, but rather, the watery consistency of this syrup. Not even cornstarch could save this. I just prefer THICK syrup. Guess I'll stick with the store-bought stuff, sorry!

I can't rate the original recipe because I had to make some substitutions due to lack of ingredients.  I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, which gave the syrup a rich flavor.  I didn't have vanilla extract, so I used two tablespoons of pure maple syrup and omitted the corn syrup.  The flavor was delicious - not too sweet with a taste almost like a cinnamon roll.  It came out quite thin, but I don't know if that's because of my modifications or what.  Next time I would probably halve the milk because I like a thicker syrup.  Will definitely make again.

I know buttermilk does not sound like and ingredient that should be in pancake syrup but you must try it for yourself.  My family would eat it alone with a spoon.  Easy to make and the with the taste uuuummmmmm what it is all about!

Wow.  I was close to putting some of this in a bowl and eating it with a spoon.  This is some delicious stuff.  Tastes like a Cinnabon.  I followed the recipe exactly and will be making this again.  Thanks so much!

OMG... SOOO GOOD!!! BF didn't like it as much as I did, he went with maple syrup on his 2nd piece of french toast, but I thought it was awesome!  I did alter it a bit based on reviews and what I had on hand... I made a half batch, but did the full amt of cinnamon, also cut back the sugar by 1/8c.  Didn't have buttermilk so I used heavy cream (considered using a buttermilk sub, but couldn't bring myself to add vinegar to this!).  Also, some mentioned it being too thin so I added 1/4ts cornstarch+ a few drops of h2o and I thought it was still a tad bit thin so next time I'll try it with 1/2ts cornstarch (and buttermilk!).  As it cooled, it did thicken up a bit though...  I saved the leftovers and we'll have it with vanilla ice cream and bananas for dessert tonight...MMMMM!!!

The flavor of the syrup was delish,however the consistency was a little loose.  I wish it was a little thicker.  I have tried it twice and both times it was like soup.  I will keep trying though since the flavor is yummy

WHOA!! This stuff is died-and-gone-to-heaven good!  And I even goofed up this recipe.  I was out of vanilla, so only had a few drops to add, instead of the 1 Tbsp., and the recipe says to add the baking soda after it simmers and I didn't read that.  Oops, I added everything at the beginning, it foamed up to about double in size, came to an almost boil, turned it down to a simmer for 1-2 minutes.  But it was still delicious.  One slight negative, it was very liquid-y, even after I let it sit and reduce.  I don't know if that was me, the way I made it or the recipe.  But no matter, I highly recommend this.

unlike many of the reviewers, I used real buttermilk (fat free though). It was really super delicious, but the buttermilk seems to have curdled. it looks gross and has some chewy chunks, but the overall flavor was delicious.

really really tasty, but mine separated and I couldn't get it to stay mixed, even with vigorous stirring, letting it sit, letting it sit overnight, nada.  I'll definitely make it again but I'll probably store it in a jar and then I can shake it up before serving.  We had it over homemade buttermilk pancakes and it made an ordinary breakfast pretty special; next time blueberry pancakes!  thanks for sharing!

Tasted like butterscotch ice cream syrup with a hint of cinnamon...too rich for our taste.  Would probably be better for ice cream.

yummy!!!!!!!!!!!
taste like cinnamon rolls, but I do recommend that after the sodais added that you let it sit until the bubbles have settled and cool it a bit, this is our new syrup when we have breakfast for dinner. thanks

Delicious.  A "must" for our waffles.  Can't really compare it to store-bought syrup.  It's thinner but the taste is !wow! and it seems like I'm not constantly adding more syrup to the kids plates when we use this recipe.

I loved this. it does taste like a cinnamon roll. The syrup was thin but did thicken up when cooled down, still not thick like regular pancake syrup, but that was okay with me. it soaked into the pancakes really nice. My family loved this and i cannot say enough good things about this. simple to make and will absolutly make again. thanks for the recipe.

This was just okay.  I may try again and make it so that I can thicken it up a bit.  It was nice for a change but I don't think I am ready to ditch the store bought syrup just yet.

This was really sweet, but it's nice to have the recipe in case of those mornings when there isn't enough maple syurp to go around!  My little girls thought it was wonderful, of course.

Very good.  Did have to remove from heat once the baking soda was added.  We thought it tasted great.  Seems to thicken as it cools.  My only question is how long does it hold for in the fridge?  This recipe makes a lot of syrup for our little family of 4.  A nice change from the store bought stuff.

I was hoping to find a recipe to replace store-bought syrup, and I think we've found a winner!  Keep in mind, this really doesn't taste at all like typical pancake syrup, but it does taste wonderful.  To me, the syrup tastes like I put some iced cinnamon rolls in a food processor and pureed them!  Be careful to use a big enough pot -- mine was fairly small, and barely contained all of the foam that is produced when the baking soda is added at the end.  We used this recipe with the Grain and Nut Whole Wheat Pancakes recipe from this site - will be a definite repeat combo in the future!

Fabulous Syrup.  It is a little thin but it made no difference once it's absorbed into pancakes or french toast.  One of my daughters who's usually picky about textures and new things was licking her plate clean!

I only tried this because I didn't have enough Log Cabin left for the number of people we had so I thought I would offer this as an option.  Well--not one person used the store bought syrup!  This tasted like warm cinammon rolls--DIVINE!
Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
