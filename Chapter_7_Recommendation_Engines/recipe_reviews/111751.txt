These were so good! I will definatly be making it again. The vinegar gives it great flavor. I was alittle hesitant to using vinegar as I thought the flavor might be too strong but its perfect. Its very subtile and tastes delicious. Yum!

Very delicious. With the cold weather creeping upon us my BBQ has been standing cold for a couple of weeks. This new recipe came in my email and I now had an excuse to use my BBQ. I did saute my onions first rather than at the end. Very tasty. We served this dish with boiled potaotes green beans and fresh bread. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so good! I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I both loved it. Last time I made brats I used the Beer Brats recipe from this site this recipe is 100 times better. The onions tasted great and the brats were delicious. The only thing I changed was browning them in a frying pan instead of grilling them. Will deinitely have the hubby grill them when I make them this summer but winters in Maine are not condusive to grilling. I will definitely be making this again!

YUM! The balsamic vinegar really gave these brats a nice tang. It was too cold out to grill these so I put them under the broiler until they were browned and crispy and served them on hoagie rolls with spicy mustard.

We really liked this one. I think that honestly good brats make this recipe. You can't just buy some cheap brats and have it taste as good. We have made this twice and enjoyed it both times.

Been looking for a good way to prepare brats indoors - I made just slight changes to the cooking process. Simmered the meat by itself then removed from skillet and reserved remaining pan juice. Sauteed the onions in the same skillet (adding a little of the juice for flavor) then added back the brats. Good with or without the bun!

I was out of regular balsamic so I used white balsamic vinegar and apple cider vinegar. I added a little brown sugar Splenda and Worchestershire sauce to get the brown coloring. I also used turkey brats. Turned out very good. Next time will use the real balsamic.

I was surprised that this was so tasty. Tasted much like excellent local German sausage dishes I've had in Germany; served with a potato dish and apples.

It's now a family favorite!! I added more onions but thats due to everyone liking them not because the recipe needed any change. You don't even have to grill them and they are still great!

Wow. We have never boiled our brats before grilling. Did not want the beer brats...fearful that our teens might not like. Yes...we might be a bit naive! Anyway followed this as written and it was awesome. The difference with boiling...skin got so very tender. Yummmm.

Excellent and super easy! The only thing I did differently was to slice some bell pepper and saute it along with the onions. Great recipe and I'll definitely be making it again. Thanks!

"Brine" is salty water not vinegar. Perhaps the recipe should be called "pickled bratwurst"?

This is one of the best ways I've ever had...and I go to a lot of trouble grilling brats! I got rave reviews at the table, and I will definitely do this again.
I grilled slices of french bread (french cut)and used chipotle mayo. Everyone loved it.
Thanks!

mmmmmmMMMMMMM! Singing operatically "Aaaaaawwwwesooome" I followed the recipe up to step 4. I put the brats back in the pan after removing the browned onions and browned the brats that way. I usually boil brats in beer with other ingredients and then grill them. Although we will continue to make the beer brat recipe the brined brat recipe definitely will be part of our rotation. My family loved them. Thanks for sharing!!

I didn't have onions so just used dried minced onions. This turned out delicious! It was easily the best bratwurst I've ever made. I will always do this now and forget about the beer method!

very good! A nice change from serving brats on a bun with mustard and ketchup. I didn't have onion so I cooked some yellow bell pepper instead and added a smidge of onion soup mix...great with mashed taters!

Very good it may flavor the onions more than the brats but better than cooking them in beer. I like to buy baguettes heat them in the oven then cut to same length as the brats great crunchy bread instead of a bun.

Yum!! I love balsamic vinegar so I added more to it than called for. They were plump juicy and just all-around good. I think next time I will cut the onion in half though.

This was AMAZING! I made this in February so no grilling outside but I browned the brats in a skillet. Now I did cook them longer because mine were not cooked all the way through. My brats were generic brand and had no additional flavoring or spices.

I think these are the best brats I have ever made! I also was leery of using the vinegar but they didn't taste vinegary at all and the brats were super moist and juicy from simmering them. The onions were good too I added a little bit of salt and pepper when browning them. I will definitely be making these again.

I'm not a brat fan but I thought this recipe was fantastic as did my son and husband. The onions are amazing! I tried to rush this recipe and accidentally boiled the brine so the casings split. Some of the brats ended up looking weird and dried out on the grill. If there is an occasion to make brats again I will definitely use this one.

I followed the recipe as instructed but browned the brats first in the pan on all sides then added the onions and liquid and simmered as directed. I did not finish them on the grill. They were delicious and tender and the finished onions were just as good! Will make brats this way every time.

Brats that were super easy to prepare and had a nice taste. I think what I enjoyed the most was that the skins stayed moist while grilling. The balsamic vinegar did make the brats dark in color. The onions were soft after cooking with the brats so I skipped the butter sautéing step. This was served with 'Grilled Corn with Cilantro Lime Butter' and 'Napa Cabbage Salad with Lemon-Pistachio Vinaigrette' both AR recipes.

We (tip from GINAH1) broiled the brats for browning rather than grilling which gave us more time for the other finishing steps we did. Instead of discarding all the liquid I saved about a cup of it. After browning the onions in butter I reduced the liquid (tip from MomB) stirring in a pat of butter at the end for a nice dipping sauce. Served on crusty sourdough bread with a green side salad. We'll keep this on as an occasional alternative to Beer Brats.

These were pretty good..we will make them again but the onions need to cook longer when they are out of the liquid. They need to carmelize. I wasn't sure of the need for all that liquid anyway and the next time I make them I'll decrease the water/vinegar--keep the flavor lose the liquid. I did brown them in the pan first off--so no need for the grill for us.

Loved this. My husband's family are bratwurst-loving Wisconson-ites. I wanted to change it up and we both love balsamic so I tried this recipe. It definitely elevated the flavor of the brats but you still can taste the brat which we love. I followed the recipe exactly. NOTE: I know NOT to pierce a brat and my brats did NOT burst. I also must mention that the onions were amazing! Make extra.

I'm from WI and have been making brats for many years and never have I boiled my brats with butter. Beer and onions only. And as other reviewers have said don't poke them as that dries them out.

My wife loves brats but is not a fan of beer so this recipe was just what the chef ordered! I did add about two pinches of brown sugar to the butter and onions to slightly take off the edge. We will make this again!

This was simple and easy. I’ve never had or cooked brats before and these came out delicious. I thought it would take less time to cook a sausage but it was worth the time.
