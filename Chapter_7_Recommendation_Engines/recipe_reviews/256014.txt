I tried this recipe in hopes of it actually tasting like cheesecake, unfortunately this is not the case. There is no way the flavor of this cake could ever be passed off as an authentic cheesecake. Sure the tofu mixture did mimic the proper texture, however the taste was just awful. I'm glad I did a practice run at home before taking it to a party as I had originally planned. Disappointing..
