I have never tried making ice cream before and this just turned out to be PERFECT!!! no ice cream machine, no special freeze container...basic elements and you will get the most amazing flavor EVER!!!!!  I only cooked the condensed milk and the cocoa for about 5 minutes,not 10 as the recipe says, maybe it´s the altitude but watch over it anyway; the second time I made this recipe added more cocoa and little evaporated milk for thickness, both times perfect, smooth, silky, flavorful and even I was concerned at first for my arteries, I didn´t care much once I ate up the first batch along with my mom, who is not ice cream people and said this was just the best ice cream she´s tried. Thank you Hersheys!!!!!

Leave it to Hersheys!  This was the tastiest, creamiest ice cream I've made since I got my ice cream maker!  I credit the condensed milk and will look for other ice cream recipes that include it.

to make the best texture..

Be sure to refrigerate until it is very cold before churning.  Also heat ice cream base to 175 degrees for the best texture ever!

Great texture and fllavor - but I think it tastes just like the "dutch chocolate" style of ice cream.  I'd definitely recommend this to a "beginner" home ice cream maker, especially one who loves dutch chocolate ice cream!

I've never made ice cream you have to cook before, and learned some key points from this recipe. I got impatient and didn't let it cool down completely before putting in the ice cream maker, therefore it took forever to freeze.  I added just a tablespoon of kahlua instead of vanilla, and added a couple spoonfuls of peanut butter to the chocolate while it was cooking on the stove. When it finally froze, it was very good!!!

I've made this twice now and loved it both times. It's very creamy and veeery chocolately. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and it still turned out wonderful. The second time I used whole milk instead of light cream. This made it a little less creamy, which I preferred.

I made this recipe and left my son stirring for a while.  I came back and thought it was ruined.  Very thick and lumpy.  I almost threw it out but decided to give it a try.  I whipped it all up with beaters until it was smooth and skipped the cool down step.  It was fantastic.  So many compliments young and old.

So smooth and silky.  I was mourning the clogging of my arteries as I poured in all that cream, but it's worth it, once in a while.  This stands good on its own, but would also be a great base for other ice creams, Rocky Road for example.

W0W!! This is a fantastic recipe and I don't even really like chocolate ice cream! I also don't have an ice cream maker - I just made it in an oven dish (because plastic doesn't transfer heat as well and so it takes longer to freeze) and beat it with my electric beater at half hourly intervals until firm.  It was light and SO tasty.  Thanks for submitting.

Delicious.  Very creamy and chocolatey.  I was worried that it wouldn't be rich enough but it was.  I preferred it right out of the ice cream maker, soft-serve style, rather than frozen solid.  Very nice smooth texture and better flavor.  When I had it the next day, I defrosted it in the microwave for 15 seconds at 50% power.  Definitely a keeper and will use this recipe whenever I get the chocolate ice cream craving.

This ice cream didn't taste rich enough for all of the calories it contained.  I would describe it as tasting like chocolate marshmallow, and my husband said it reminded him of the Carnation chocolate malts he used to get at the ball park.  It's a good eggless alternative.

awesome recipe.  I had a different brand of cocoa on hand (nestle) and used it.  ice cream turned out tasting very much like a wendy's frosty.  Yummy!  Will have to remember to try adding peanut butter next time...

Omigosh - This ice cream is soooo good!!! Easy to make but takes a little while because of the cooling down time, well worth the wait though. Not too sweet but very smooth and creamy. I gave some to the neighbor and she and her mom finished it off in one night - her dad only got one spoonful. Will definitely make this again soon, but i will double the recipe (there is no way it makes 18 servings).

Great recipe!  I took this over to a neighbor's for 4th of July.  Everyone loved it!  I do not recommend following the directions exactly.... you MUST double this recipe as it does not go too far.  This made 6 small bowls, which went very quickly.

This is fabulous tasting--rich choclate flavor.
Mine did not freeze well in the machine, so I poured it into a container and ripened it in the freezer. The texture was just wonderful--my daughter loves this ice cream!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!  I made this recipe and a batch of vanilla for my daughter's 4th birthday party and bar far the chocolate was voted the best.  It was SO easy and the texture was so creamy ... very yummy!  My niece (who typically doesn't like ice cream) loved it so much that now her Mom asked for the recipe and is planning to make it for her birthday in a few months.

Great ice cream!  I would have given it five stars, but it isn't nearly as good as chocolate ice cream I had in Graz (in Austria) once.  This was the second time I used my ice cream maker, and the first recipe I wasn't impressed with- it was vanilla and I thought was way too rich and had too much vanilla flavor (I'm sensitive to that flavoring), so with this recipe I used skim milk instead of light cream and 1/4 the amount of vanilla extract.  Wonderful, thank you so much!

I knew if it was Hershey's, it had to be good, and I was right. I've made their fudge for years and their Deep Dark Chocolate Cake is to die for. I am a chocoholic, but I don't like chocolate ice cream that's too rich. This one isn't. The flavor is remniscient of fudgesicles, my favorite ice cream truck treat.

I got the Kitchenaid attachment for Christmas and wanted to give it a try now that it's warmer.  My husband requested chocolate ice cream - the hardest ice cream to make.  I searched and found this recipe and it couldn't have turned out better.  My whole family fell in love.

This was the third Ice Cream recipe that I made in my new Ice Cream Maker and it was by far the best and the easiest. I liked that it didn't need eggs and still came out very creamy. I added a little chocolate syrup to this recipe in addition to the cocoa (nothing can ever be too chocolately to me). Thanks for sharing. I'll be making this again soon!

I love this ice cream.  I have been experminting with different recipes and this one is the best I have tried.  It tastes delisious and is so creamy.  I have even made it leaving out the cocoa for a creamy vanilla or adding sauted buttered pecans and 1 tlb. butter for buttered pecan ice cream.  Also works great for peach or strawberry by adding them instead of the cocoa.

This was really good except you could taste too much of the vanilla extract.  Next time, I make this I would probably use less vanilla extract, and it would be perfect.  This didn't come together in my ice cream maker, so I put it in the freezer after a while. (but I think I read somewhere that that is supposed to happen with certain types of ice cream, but I'm not sure)  Besides the problem I had with the vanilla extract, it was perfect and super-extra easy.  My dad won't let me make anything with raw egg, so this is another reason this recipe is gr8!

Absolutely delicious! Beware though, this is a really rich ice cream and it's not the kind I'd like to eat in large portions... In an ice cream cone or to top some cake... Creamy and rich!

Excellent.  I probably should have made 2 batches.  My guests were coming back for seconds.  Some even said they do not care for ice cream, but now have changed their minds after having this!  Did not change a thing in the recipe.

First time making this recipe.  It's my favorite chocolate ice cream so far. The texture and sweetness is just right.

Fantastic!  Could be a little too chocolaty for some, but texture is wonderful.  Will make again.

This was my first attempt at making ice cream using my new ice cream maker and the end result was "OK", but nothing spectacular.  I didn't use heavy cream (used half and half instead) and in the end, the ice cream tasted like sorbet with a powdery texture.  I probably won't make this again.

Awesome recipe!  VERY chocolatey, but not too much.  A great no raw egg recipe which is a must with little ones around!

Followed the recipe to the T, except I doubled it. For making ice cream for the 1st time, my family was very impressed.  Its a good thing I did double it because I only made it yesterday and it is already almost gone.  I might add some goodies (such as candy bar pieces *reeses*) next time.  Definatly a keeper

Very yummy ice-cream. It's pretty much the same recipe and taste as the Rocky Road Ice Cream from this site but without the Rocky Road bits. I prefer the Rocky Road one!
