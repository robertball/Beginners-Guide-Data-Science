If you like ketchup, you will love these.  I found that they had no other flavor than that.  I added a whole bottle of store bough BBQ sauce and then served these.  Sorry, but not a hit in our home.

I used butter and cut down on the onion. Otherwise, I followed the ingredients to a T, at first. I made the sauce completely before adding the meat. When I tasted the completed sauce, it just didn't work for me. It was overly tangy from the white vinegar. At this point, I added a little more sugar and worchestershire sauce, and finally some liquid smoke to give it more of a barbecue flavor. I thought the flour was a little strange. My son enjoyed this and had seconds, so this gets 4 stars.

This recipe had way too much sauce. If I make it again (which I don't plan to) I would half the sauce and double the amount of pork.
