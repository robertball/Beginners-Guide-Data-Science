Quickly becoming one of my favorite drinks. I use bakers sugar to rim the glass and an actual lemon drop candy in place of the cherry. You can use half of the amount of triple sec and have good results as well.

5/18/06----On the first one I rimmed my glass w/ powdered sugar but on the second I used superfine granulated & I prefer that. The drink itself is rather tart but w/ the sugar on the glass it becomes sweet & tart. Yummm! I copied IHeartShane & used a lemon drop in place of the cherry & I also added a tiny sprig of mint. Beautiful drink & tasty too! UPDATE 5/31/06---I made this drink again tonight but instead of using the triple sec I subbed 1/2 of the amount w/ lemon simple syrup (it's too sweet to use as much as I would triple sec) & then added just a bit more lemon juice. (Other than this change I made it the same as the last review.) I also tried to be clever & garnished this w/ a couple of pieces of candied lemon peel. Don't do that.;o) It rehydrated perfectly wonderful addictive sugary lemon candies back into bitter leathery lemon peels. The lemon simple syrup instead o the triple sec is a really good idea. The candied lemon peel garnish is a very bad idea. Oh well; you win some you lose some.

The first time I made these I could have sworn they turned out ok. But this time they were just awful. I'm not sure what I did differently the first time but this time I followed the recipe exactly and my husband actually poured his down the sink.

My husband and I did not care for this. This is usually my signature drink when I go out so I was really dissapointed in this. It was way too strong and bitter. I even tried adding more lemon juice and sugar. Nothing helped.

I served these recently at a Ladies Only Nite. They got a AAA Rating from all of the girls. The variation was that I served the Lemon Drop II Martinis in a glass rimmed with sugar and used a lemon twist as a garnish! Absolutely Delish!

Didn't care for it. Not great not horrible. A bit too strong for our taste.

This was ok. I left the maraschino cherries out because I don't care for them which resulted in the drink tasting a little bland. Next time I'll try adding some grenadine or something to give it a little more flavor.
