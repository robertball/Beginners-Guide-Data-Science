This recipe was easy to follow especially being my first time making homemade lasagna. This is the best lasagna I've ever had! I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I have made this recipe twice now. I used ricotta rather than cottage cheese, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband loved it, and I took it to church and 2 people asked for the recipe.  This is even better as leftovers, and it's great to assemble the night before and bake the next day.

Iv'e made this recipe 3 times. First time I followed the recipe to the t, the salami was a bit over powering. 
The second time around, i left the salami out, it was way better. I also added chopped sweet peppers to the sauce. By the third try, I've decided to use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. 
Overall, a great recipe. (my substitutions are based on my hubby's preference).
