This dip is definitely very simple, but the taste is amazing.  I always use an English cucumber (seedless with 'edible' skin), shred the entire thing in the food processor, and then squeeze out the excess liquid for better texture.  Also, definitely use fresh dill, you will not be disappointed.  I think the dip's success depends on what you serve it with.  My preferences: Garlic Melbas (good for dipping), fresh veggies, and tortilla chips.

We have cucumbers coming out of our ears (husband planted huge garden!) so I took a gamble on this recipe and doubled it the first time I made it.  IT IS WONDERFUL! I just went to the store and bought 8 more packages of cream cheese because we don't dare run out of this stuff - its addictive!

Note: first time I made it I didn't have enough liquid in the pepper sauce, so I added water to the jar & hoped it would work.  (A taste test off off my finger proved that it didn't - so I added 1/4 tsp of Cajun seasoning salt to the doubled recipe.) Perfect! I liked the little zing from the Cajun flavor, so next time I make the dip I will add it again w/ maybe just a touch more.

Only suggestion I have is to suggest using very mild flavored crackers or chips as the dip is so good - you don't want to overpower it with a strong flavored cracker.

I actually made this as a filling for tea sandwiches...I made it as written (except I grated the cucmber and pressed out the water before adding it), then added another 1/2 tsp. dill, dash onion powder, and dash seasoned salt to pump up the flavor a bit. I then added a couple of drops of green food coloring. Along with ham or chicken salad, and cheese spread, it made beautiful ribbon sandwiches. I also had a lot left over which we used as a dip. I would have to say if I used it for sandwiches again, I would probably use 1/2 as much mayo. A very good and useful recipe.

Everyone LOVED this dip! Great way to use up extra cucumbers from the garden. We had this on crackers and veggies. I added a little bit more dill weed than the recipe called for and used HOT chili powder instead of hot sauce, and I thought it was perfect!  * * I found that the easiest way to slice up and seed the cucumbers was to cut them in quarters lengthwise, so they're shaped like pickle spears. Then, run a knife along the top of each spear to trim away the seeds. * *

I only buy English cucs, which after running thru my food processor, I placed in a colander, sprinkled with salt and let it drain for five hours. I used a soft herbed cream cheese and a tsp. of the dill. Nice dip Reid and thanks!

I used reduced fat cream cheese/mayonnaise. I made no other changes. This was good but not great--it reminds me a little of tzakiki sauce. I think it could use more dill and maybe some fresh minced garlic. I'd like to play with this recipe. Maybe substitute half nonfat greek yogurt in place of some of the mayonnaise next time.

This was delicious.  I did double the amount of dill because I couldn't taste it with the amounts stated.  I also didn't add the hot pepper sauce (I forgot) and it was still amazing.  Can't wait to try this out on company.  Thanks for the post.

I can't stop eating this!  It's such a great dip fro summer.  This was my first time making this and I realized that I didn't have any mayo, so I subbed in sour cream.  It worked out really well.  Also, I highly recommend making this with fresh dill.  Yummy!!!

I made this dip to accompany baked salmon and was not disappointed. My husband loved it, (a treat in itself if you read my bio)!  I also took a portion of it and added garlic powder and fresh parm cheese, spread over the salmon as it baked and it was wonderful also!  Thanks Molson7!

Absolutely loved it, perfect with Wheat Thins.  I used one english cucumber and after grating squeezed out as much juice as I could.  It needs a little time to sit in order to get the full flavor.

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite dips. Its easy to make and had a light, refreshing flavor. I didn't use the hot pepper sauce. I used fresh dill instead of dried. I passed the cucumbers (seeded) through the food processor and voila! An easy and delicious dip perfect for football season or parties. Thanks for sharing and go Bears!

Very tasty. I shredded and dried off the cucumbers before adding to keep the dip thick. I didn't have hot sauce so I used cajun spices mentioned in another review. To give it a stronger dill taste I doubled the amount the recipe called for. Thanks for sharing the recipe it will be used a lot at our house!

This dip was a huge hit at my last party.  I had to add a lot more dill (dried and fresh) to make it more... dilly? And also let it rest over night in the fridge.  Squeezing out the water from the cucumbers was a great tip.  All in all, the bowl was scraped clean.

This is a quick and wonderful recipe! The only differences I did was used one large cucumber from garden and about 3 tbsp. of dill - we love dill. Delish served with crackers!

EITHER USE LESS CUCUMBER OR SHRED IT FIRST AND PRESS OUT WITH PAPERTOWEL OR IT WILL BE RUNNY. I love the flavor. I did add more dill. Mine came out a bit runny to be a dip. I'm wondering if it will thicken a bit upon setting in the fridge.  I suspect my cucumbers were bigger than normal, thus too runny, next time I will add the cucumbers a bit at a time and see how that goes. However, this will make an excellent salad dressing too! Oh my gosh I wrote the above then I was tasting it again and decided to add some horseradish. Now I just can't stop tasting it! I'm going to put it on my salad for lunch.

I thought it had too much of a mayo taste so added some sour cream to tone it down.  I got all the water out of the cucumbers (important).  I had a family request to make it again (that is an automatic 5 star!).

This is a great recipe and a great way to use up all those cucumbers from the garden.  I did think the recipe was bland.  I doubled the dill and also added a teaspoon of cajun seasoning (thanks whoever suggested that)..it made it so much better...just a slight kick and everyone in our cooking club really enjoyed it.  Will make it again. Great served with crackers.

I added a lot more dill than called for, at least a tablespoon.  I also drained my cucmber for about half an hour before making the dip.  This recipe is very good!

Absolutely delicious!!!! I added a bit of onion powder and instead of hot sauce (God only knows how but I ran out) I used cayenne.  Not a disappointment whatsoever - will definitely make this again!!!

Tasty, I did only use half the mayo and doubled the dill. Make sure you don't have too big of pieces of cucumbers since it is a dip.

Made the recipe without the dill weed because I didn't have any but this recipe was super delicious.  I took this to work and my coworkers gobbled it up quickly and were wanting the recipe.  I used this recipe to try to use up our plentiful cucumbers from the garden.  I got my husband to eat this and he doesn't like cucumbers, I'm impressed.  Thanks for submitting, maybe one day I will have a recipe to submit.

Used 1/4 c. Mayo. And also extra all-purpose Dill Mix (has garlic and a few other spices in it). This is a great dip, especially the next day.

This dip is truly amazing!  Fresh, light, creamy and just delicious!  I definitely recommend using a nonflavored melba toast or chip because otherwise you miss out on the subtley of the flavors that make this tip unique.  I used a bit more lemon juice and remember to double the dill if you're using fresh dill as I did.  People honestly parked in front of this tonight at my sister's barbecue.  Wonderful!

I've been using this recipe for years and we love it.  I grill salmon and drop dollops of this on top of the salmon before serving and everyone loves it.  When you're dieting and eating low sugar foods and lots of protein it gets boring - so this helped perk up the salmon.  Never tried it on crackers.  Thanks for the recipe - its become a staple in our house during the summer.

I have made this dip about 6 times this summer, and it has been an absolute hit everytime.  I have used fresh cucumbers from the garden and cucumbers I bought from the store.  Of course, fresh is best but it was still good with the store bought cucs.  I've used fat free ingredients as well and it was still really good.  I did use about 5 times as much dill as what this recipe calls for--the 1/2 a teaspoon just was not enough.  I serve it with salt free mini pretzels--everyone loved it!

I had a ton of cucumbers I needed to use up so I made this dip and served with additional cucumber slices and it just vanished.  I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 plain greek yogurt and reduced fat cream cheese to cut calories.

Refreshing!!! I have cucumbers growing wild in my garden and I was looking for a recipe. Love going off of reviews for the best recipe and here you have it! I shredded my cucumber and let drain for 11/2hr. I also used a lot more dill. Also used Franks red hot pepper sauce and a little extra then recipe called for and I let dip chill 6-8hrs or over night for best results!
5* it is very delicious recipe!

If you happen to have all the ingredients I guess it is better than no dip, but nothing remarkable about this dip, nobody will probably ask for the recipe.  They will probably eat it but not remember it.

I decided to make one serving to try. I used Toffutti instead of cream cheese, and following the other reviews pureed the cucumber to drain the excess water. I put the rest of the ingredients into the blender, and it was still watery, so added a little more Toffutti and enough bread to thicken it. It still turned out delicious! I will definately make this again. Thank you!

Used Pic-a-Peppa Sauce - goes well w/the cream cheese.  1 1/2 teaspoons. 

Spread on toasted bread, add thin-sliced turkey and create double-decker club sandwich.

We've made this every week since the start of summer, and I am serving it as ourThanksgiving appetizer.  I signed up for allrecipes.com just to rave about this dip!  We use it for veggies, chips, crackers, as a sandwich spread, to stuff celery - even for a cold stuffed fresh bell pepper recipe.  I am not a "spicy" person so I omit the hot pepper sauce and double the dried dill, and use reduced fat cream cheese and light mayonnaise.  I even use this to top cooked salmon filets.  This dip is simple to make, and simply fabulous!

I reduced the mayo by 1/2 and used Miracle Whip in place of the mayo.  I also doubled the hot sauce and used the Georgia Peach and Vidalia Onion hot sauce that I get from Peppers (an absolutely must-have).  Next time I would probably shred the cucumber.  This is definitely a great summertime dip for parties.
