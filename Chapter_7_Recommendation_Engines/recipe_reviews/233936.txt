This is delicious!  I used Sriracha as my hot sauce and lime juice in place of lemon because I had no lemons.  My son called it "lady food" and then proceeded to finish it.  Thanks, this will become a summer staple.

This recipe is great! Perfect for a potluck. I added walnuts for crunch and cherry tomatoes for colour. The dressing tastes so good. Really fresh. Looking forward to when peaches are in season! I also tried it with strawberries instead of peaches- a great alternative!
