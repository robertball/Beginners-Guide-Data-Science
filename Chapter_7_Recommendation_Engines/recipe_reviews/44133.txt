Very good to excellent recipe, but it seemed like the sauce needed a little something.  Next time I will add ginger to the actual sauce - in addition to rubbing it on the chicken - maybe 1 Tbsp. I will probably also add 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. I also added flour to the sauce to get it to thicken up.

This was very good - I couldn't find any fresh Tarragon so just used the dried.  I heated the leftovers for dinner the next day and it was just as good

Yum-yum! Chicken was great. I made it for the second time and I grated a little ginger and used ginger powder and left it on the chicken for about 15 minutes. I got the ginger kick this time around. Served it with wild rice and enjoyed every bite. Oh I changed the skillet because I didn't like the brown color from frying the chicken mixed with the sauce.

Very good - although I think I probably used too little ginger to get the real punch - there were some subtle flavours in the sauce though.  I added mushrooms, which seemed to work quite well.  I'd definitely use this recipe again.

I thought this was OK.  My husband was not crazy about it.  I thought it could have used more flavor and the sauce never thickened.

This was so good. The sauce was amazing.  Can you believe the day I went to the store the boneless breasts were less money than the bone in? Made them with the boneless and we still had great flavor. I added a pint of mushrooms to the sauce.  Will make again. Fam loved it all including the asparagus.
