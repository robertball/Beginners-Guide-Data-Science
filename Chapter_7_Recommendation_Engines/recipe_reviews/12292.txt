A co-worker made this pie and it's delicious.  The only change she made was to add about a teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg.  It's wonderful!

This was the nastiest "desert" I ever made. It was second only to the chocolate souffle when I forgot to add the sugar...chocolate scrambled eggs...Come to think of it, that was better than this. Water ran out of the pie followed by a syrup that was the consitancy of library glue. The tomatoes were still chrunchy and the color was repulsive.

No one could guess it! They all loved it though! I used ripe tomatoes, but the flavor tastes the same as apple pie very much.  NOTE: Eat it fresh, not refrigerated (the tomato flavor comes out after a while if you use fresh toms)

my kids love "almost apple pie" so much that they cleaned out the tomato garden asking for it!  The recipe is a little too juicy and does need more flour, or another thicking agent to get the right consistency.  It is also helpful to cut the tomatoes into smaller, more bite sized pieces, before baking because tomatoes dont hold their shape once cooked and they relax into long noodly shapes that are awkward to eat as pie.  Otherwise, yummy!

Pretty good pie, though the aftertaste is a bit off.  Definitely would need more flour, as mine came out very runny.  I ran out of white sugar and had to use brown and that worked out pretty well.

At first, we were pleasantly surprised with this pie's flavor, but the tomatoes needed to be chopped more instead of sliced, and the consistency was a little runny.  Maybe mixing in a few apples would help.

WOW!  This was Fantastic!  I never thought of making a pie with green apples until I skimmed through the site and saw this one.  I had a basket full of green tomatos which were the last from my garden and wanted to make something different other than fried green tomatos and saw this recipe.  I had an extra large pie pan so I made a larger batch than what the recipe noted.  When it baked I was surprised that it smelled like apple pie and then you could smell the green tomatos.  When it finished it even looked and tasted like apple pie.  To me it was best cold with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of Hershey's syrup.  I was so proud of it I even took photos.

the green tomato pie tastes just like a apple pie and is really good. I like to make it every summer out of my green tomatoes that haven't ripened. it's so easy to make

Made this morning with tomatoes picked yesterday.  Very good and not to sweet.
