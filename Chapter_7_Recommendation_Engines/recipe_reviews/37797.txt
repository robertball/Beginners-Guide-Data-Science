This recipe was very easy and delicious.  I would only add another teaspoon of the creole seasoning to zip it up another notch!

Horrible! The Miracle Whip ruined it. It gets worse as it cools down too!

I loved this fish. It's simple, fast, and very tasty. I didn't have corn flakes so I used crushed saltine crackers. It turned out great!

This recipe is so easy and good!  I forgot the parmesan cheese and used fat free mayo, and it was still wonderful.  It has the feeling of my grandma's cooking without heavy oil or time-consuming cooking.  Delicious!

This was super!  Extremely full of flavor.  A hint of spice, but not too much for my 3 year old & 18 mo. old--we did add a tsp per other's advice.  Looked great in the pan. Fun & easy to put together. Crushing our corn chex cereal was fun for the kids.  Grated romano cheese replaced the parm.  We used the Creole Seasoning Blend recipe on this site. We used regular mayo which made it nice and moist. We will make this again.

This is a very good fish recipe.  I used fat free mayo, Emeril's Essence for the creole seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste on the filets.  It turned out great!  You can't beat the fact that it was quick and easy too.

This was a tasty dish. My husband liked it!  I took into consideration someone's review regarding the miracle whip dressing, so I used the dressing on half of the filets and the other half I ommitted the dressing.  I must say the dressing did add a bit more zip to the catfish!  I didn't have the cajun seasoning on hand so I added a few drops of hot sauce...very delicious.  Also, I marinated the filets with salt, pepper and some other spices that I like for about an hour..then I soaked it in milk for 30 minutes.  Just for kicks, I think next time I am going to try to use bread crumbs instead of the crushed cornflakes.

A+ recipe! My husband (who doesn't like fish) had 3 servings, and my 2 year old son stood at the stove begging for bites before everything else was ready! I followed the recipe to a T except I used a BBQ brush to brush on the dressing instead of dipping it. That the dressing went on much more evenly.

This was ok...nothing to write home about. Not sure if I will make again....I thought the recipe was a bit bland and the mayonnaise gave it a funny taste.

Very good, very easy. I might add a bit more Cajun seasoning next time, otherwise it's perfect. The only cereal we had in the house was Special K, and it worked great. Using Miracle Whip (for anything other than my husband's sandwiches) goes against every fiber of my being, but it finally has a noble use in my book.

Sublime! Nothing could be more simple to prepare and easy on the wallet.  Macaroni&cheese and a salad side and we were in business.

I try to get away from my old frying days whenever I can and this fit the bill.  Nice crunch outside and tender inside.  Easy, too.  Thanks!

Not very good.  The coating didn't want to stick to the fish, and I ended up with some weird gooey mixture on the bottom of the pan.  Will stick with my old oven fried catfish recipe.

This was great, the miracle whip made the fish so tender and soft and the corn flakes gave it a good texture. Instead of creole I added cayanne pepper to give it a little kick. I will make this again. Only thing that I had to change was the cook time, I left it in there about 35 min and raised the temperature by 25 degrees

Very tasty recipe.  Even the kids liked it.  Catfish tends to be a little too fishy for my kids so I soaked the fish in milk for about an hour first.  Used Special K instead of corn flakes.  Not quite as crisp as we might have liked, but still delicious.

Excellent! This was my first time using the oven-fry method for catfish and I must say, this is the best catfish I have ever made in my 20 years of frying. I altered the recipe by adding 2 tablespoons of prepared mustard to the salad dressing. I found that my fish stuck to the pan, so I will spray with a little Pam before baking next time.

"Best catfish I have ever had!" That is what came out of my husbands mouth. I would say that I agree. I was easy and tasted great.
