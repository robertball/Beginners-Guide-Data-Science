These are incredibly tasty, crunchy and quick and easy to make. I took the advice of another reviewer and used half bread crumbs and half flour. These disappeared with in moments of my setting them down. I will prepare my wings this way from now on.

Made these a few days ago. They were very good. Nice and crunchy without the fat of frying. The only change I made was to use Italian-Style Bread crumbs instead of flour which spiked the flavor even more and I think, made the drummies crispier. Used this recipe again for a whole chicken that I cut into parts) and it yielded the same results - great flavor and crisp texture. Naturally I had to increase bake time to allow for the thicker pieces of chicken. This is a new family favorite - will definitely make these again.

These were good tasting, but then again...I like ANY kind of wings!!  They didn't come out as evenly brown as the picture shows.  Next time I may let them go even longer because I liked the ones that got done the most the best!  I followed the recipe exactly (except used margarine instead of butter). The dip was good, but the ranch was a little STRONG tasting for me.  I ended up adding a little more sour cream and that helped.   I will probably make these again, but not with the dip...too much fat for both the wings and the dip!

Very tasty and pretty easy too. I used the bread crumbs as mentioned below and they were nice and crispy - and the Italian dressing mix since I had it on hand. I did give them a few minutes under the broiler before serving to  add some extra crispness - but not necessary really. Also, I used canola oil instead of butter and that worked great. My hubby is already asking when I'm making them again. Probably this weekend!

This was so different and very good.  However, my family were not particularly crazy about the Hidden Valley dressing, so the second time I made it, I used Zesty Italian (packaged) and that was great.  I left the wings in for a bit longer for extra crispy.

I've tried a variation of this before and was very pleased. I'll being doing it again, this time with the dip included in this recipe.

Great recipe. Very easy to make and came out perfect with no changes. We made this as a dinner and devoured them. Thanks, Hidden Valley.

These were pretty good but I would suggest adding some seasoning salt like tonys to the flour bc it just needed something more. The ranch dip is very good. I added only 1/2 a packet to the dip and 1/2 a pack of onion soup mix and a lot more hotsauce. I now make it just to dip my veggies in. I like it better than making the plain ranch dip the way the ranch packet tells you too bc it makes a thicker dip and that makes it easier to dip veggies in. All in all very good for when you dont want spicy buffalo wings.

Delicious!  This is definitely something I'll be making again.  My family loves wings and we've tried making our own before, different types and they turn out okay but these are not hard and fool proof.  So simple and the meat just fell off of the bone.

These were super easy and delicious.  My family prefers boneless wings so I cut up boneless breasts into chunks and used it in place of the drummettes. I also added some crushed red pepper to the flour mixture.  I cooked the chunks for about 10 minutes on each side.  They didn't brown as nicely since I cooked them for a shorter time.  I think I'll finish them under the broiler next time.

Not impressed with the sauce, but the wings were tasty and easy to make.
