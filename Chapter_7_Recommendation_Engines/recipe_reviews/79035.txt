Absolutely the best fried clams I've ever had. I didn't have any crackers, so I substituted with Panko and flour: I had the eggs in one bowl, Panko in another bowl, and then the flour mixed with all the other spices in another bowl. Dipped the clams in the egg, then in the flour mixture, then in the panko and fried till golden brown. Yum!!! My husband, who isn't really a big fan of fried clams, thought they were delicious and ate them right up. Although I've lived in WA for over 15 years, this was my first time digging for, then preparing and eating razor clams. Now I'm a huge fan! =) Note: It's really super important to be sure to clean these clams properly, as well as to make sure they are thoroughly patted dry with paper towels before you begin.

I love this recipe!!  I grew up digging these little suckers, and eating them just like this.  If you want to cook razor clams this is the only way beside clam chowder or fritters.

We tried this recipe last night and thought it was great right down to the spicy cocktail sauce,  We also used some sweet and sour sauce and lightly salted the clams right when they came out of the oil.  As for a boggy taste,  we wondered if maybe the other reviewer didnt properly clean thier clams.  Razor Clams are known for thier mild taste but must be cleaned properly.  I would certinly make this again!!

This recipe is the real deal if you are a razor clam fan. We dig up Razor Clams down on Long Beach Washington. This is the recipe we use to fry up the day's catch when we get back to the condo. You can serve with butter, tarter or cocktail sauce.

Lacking saltines, I followed ladybug's recommendation and dipped the clams in flour, then egg wash, then panko mixed with seasonings.  At medium-high, they only take a few minutes per side.  Yum.

Absolutely wonderful.  We fried these clams for a holiday dinner appetizer, and everyone enjoyed them.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Just fried some up, great meal. Followed Ladybug's suggestions and they were spot on! I fried 90 seconds per side, remember they are still cooking once out of the oil. Enjoy!

I made this and thought it was excellent.  We dug our own razor clams on a beach in Alaska and cleaned them ourselves.  What a chore, but you have to do it right, or the slightest bit of clam guts could ruin a whole batch.  I fried these up with a little change in the ingredients.  I added some corn meal because I love the corn battered clams.  It was flavorful and a hit with everyone, even my boys - 4 and almost 2 - who would have thought?  I found it works best if you fry them hot and quick.  They don't turn out rubbery and they are very tender.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will use it over and over again.

I love clams, but I found these guys to be a little chewy, and the recipe could've done without the crackers. Not sure I will make these again, or else use a different recipe.

I am an old pro (lol) at razor clam digging, cleaning and cooking. I had a very difficult time getting the breading to stick when I fried these. Maybe I didn't have the right oil temp? I ended up having to rinse  the crumb mixture off the second batch and then breading with our family fav, seasoned cornmeal and flour. That worked great.

Better than our favorite restaurant in Ocean Shores!  I used regular bread crumbs instead of saltines and added a pinch of dried parsley flakes.  These disappeared quickly off the serving platter!  Definitely will make again, if our local Costco keeps carrying them in their fresh fish section! 

...Okay, maybe I'd go dig them if I had to, but I've never done it (sad, lived in Washington all my life and never dug clams!).

A great recipe. I never used the cracker crumbs but have always used Progresso bread crumbs. Very easy and tasty.

I love razor clams and Costco had them fresh and cleaned! I followed the recipe but used the flour and some panko.  Made tartar sauce for my husband and I enjoyed with just lemon juice! YUM! Thanks for the recipe! I appreciated having it to rely on.

Says 1 min to cook but long experience shows 20 sec or 20 min is all the same... rubber. They should cut like butter with a fork. Cook with your oil just smoking.

Best fried Razor clams I've ever had I did change a couple of things. I used Club crackers and I doubled the recipe and used oil and a stick of butter for frying. Even my son who isn't really a clam fan liked them.
