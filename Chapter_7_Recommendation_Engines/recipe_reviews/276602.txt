Excellent recipe for making a homemade version including the bread dough. Only changes I made was a little more flour because it was super sticky and I live in a humid area. Otherwise dough was super soft and easy to work with. Bread came out great.

Excellent pizza roll. The dough is fantastic, soft but workable. Per the recipe I made it in the stand mixer so it came together quickly. The 1st rise time was closer to 2 hours but it's winter so that's how it goes. Once rolled into the rectangle I did  spread fresh garlic puree (grated on a rasp) before the egg wash. Also sprinkled the provolone with grated parmesan, a few red pepper flakes and dried oregano in addition to the pepperoni. Second rise, sprinkled top with garlic powder and baked for 38 minutes. I did only make half this recipe which made a HUGE loaf. Unless you have a bunch of hungry li'l monkeys (kids!) half was plenty. Next time I think I'll try very thinly sliced smoked ham instead of the pepperoni and gruyere cheese instead of provolone  to switch it up. All in all a great recipe!
