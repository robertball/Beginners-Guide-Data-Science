Very good "mostly from scratch" recipe!  My family did not care for the bread crumb topping, opting instead for our usual crunchy onion topping. It was rather mild the first time around, so we spiced it up by adding 1 TBLS Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp or so of pureed garlic (essentially 1 clove garlic), 1/4 cup white wine, 6 oz. Mozzarella cheese and shaved parmesan.  Need white wine so the cheeses don't get "stringy" when baked.  Also added generous pinches of Nutmeg, Corriander & Tarragon.  This is a great recipe to try as it is largely a scratch recipe that you can add or delete your own twists to.
