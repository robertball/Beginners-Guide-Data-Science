Very flavorful and thick. Tastes old school, Italian like my Sicilian neighbors used to make in high school. Loved it... even my picky teenagers liked it.

Turned out amazing! My favorite sauce as of today. However I did make some adjustments. I cut the recipe in half as I thought the original would yield too much for my home. I did add diced mushrooms while saluting the onions and browned 1lb Italian seasoned ground turkey. Since mushrooms sweat (produce extra liquid) I used a full can of tomato paste. I cut down the olive oil to about 2T and used a mixture of oregano and thyme. I decided to use my slow cooker and cooked it for about an hour then took out the bay leaves, threw in the fresh basil and cheese and then put in a splash of white wine instead of the suggested amount. Slow cooked for another hour and boy, I can eat this out of the pot by itself! Thank you for sharing!

This is an excellent sauce. I followed the recipe exactly, except used crushed rather than diced tomatoes and less olive oil.

I really didn't make this recipe, but I am Italian, and I learned how to cook sauce exactly the same way my mother did using this exact recipe.  We never measured, but we eyeballed it, did it by sight, smell, and most importantly, taste.  I changed out the sugar for a bit of carrot.  Trust me, you won't miss the wasted calories from the sugar and your kids will never know there's carrot in the sauce.

It was super easy and super good. Didn't last long as all three batches went quickly and I had three requests for the recipe.

Added a rib of chopped celery and a chopped carrot for sweetness.  Excellent sauce to add meat to.

Excellent sauce! Easy to make and I only eliminated the crushed red pepper. I did not have any! Oops My men loved every bite of it.

there were several changes I made to this recipe. Do to my preferences. I used one large can of crushed tomatoes. This replaces diced tomatoes. Instead of 1/2 cup of olive oil. I used 2 tbs. (because I cook low fat). Also omitted the wine.  the recipe turned out great. Definitely will make it again.
