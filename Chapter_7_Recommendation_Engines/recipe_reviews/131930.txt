I took time reviewing this recipe. I am a Martini Lover and had alot of different types over the years. At first I wanted to rate this with 1-2 stars... But the more I sat and thought about this there is really only 1 thing I would change, So with the change it is 5 star worthy.. All I did was use a dash of vermouth to a dash to coat the glass. That was it now go enjoy!
