Southern hubby was amazed that my Northern self knew about fried egg sandwiches.  I have always just made them with salt and pepper on buttered toast slices, no cheese, no mayo, no ketchup. But the additions sound pretty good. If you cook your eggs over easy the yolk does get kind of messy while eating but I just sop it up with my toast.  Also, since this recipe is being compared to fast food I have recently ventured into making them in the microwave. It’s faster and easier and less clean up.  Melt a little margerine in a small glass ramekin type bowl. Swirl the margerine around to coat the bowl. Break your egg into the bowl. Prick the yolk gently 2-3 times with a toothpick. It does not run like you might think. Cover your little bowl with wax paper and mike on high for about 45 seconds.  You can make more eggs in more bowls at the same time by adding a few more seconds. Slide them out onto your toast. Use a potholder, they are hot. They come out round just like those egg McYouknowhats.

I guess I'm the minority, I didn't like the ketchup on this sandwich.

I changed this up a little.

My ingredients are as follows:
Fried egg
Toasted rye bread
Extra sharp white cheddar cheese
Bacon (tasty addition)
Mayo (no ketchup)

I would have liked to add tomato and onion if I had it.

Traditional is good too though the way I made them before was just with egg and mayo.

This is a joke right?  People who can't assemble a breakfast sandwich without a recipe should probably be institutionalized.

Egg sandwiches are a staple in this house - in many shapes and forms. I was curious to try this one as it had the addition of mayonnaise. I made two sandwiches and used toasted whole grain bread. I liked the ketchup and mayo, but will probably go back to my old standard. My husband left his plain and of course had to add some bacon!

This was good! I took JUSTCYN's idea and tried this one in the microwave, for convenience sake. I sprayed PAM inside a small, square tupperware container, and added the pepper to the egg mixture (I left out the salt, I'm not big on it). This method worked like a charm. From start to finish, I had my sandwich in about three minutes. This is a keeper, no doubt. Perfect for the mornings I'm in a rush and need something quick before class. Not to mention I won't be spending time/money in the McDonald's drive-thru twice a week. Thank you!

I fried my eggs in bacon grease and used cheddar cheese instead of American. My kids wanted their sandwiches with ketchup and mayo so I made theirs according to the recipe. I did not, I just shook some Frank's hot sauce over my eggs before I put the bread together. As always, egg sandwiches are economical, quick and filling.

definitely a tasty and quick breakfast snack when you're in a hurry. Or when you're just plain lazy. Salt and Pepper are crucial. I personally skip the mayo and ketchup and go straight for the hot sauce. Call me crazy, but I need some spice to get me going in the morning. ;-)

This is my "feel good" sandwich.  

Within the past 2 years, my husband's health has declined severely.  He is 70 years old.  He refused to eat much at regular meal times, but awakened me in the middle of the night ---every night---to fix him something to eat.  Since his dementia was increasing and he was not eating properly otherwise, I would jump out of bed and fix him a fried egg sandwich along with a large glass of cold milk.  He always ate the entire sandwich and occasionally ate two.  That made me more comfortable knowing that he was getting proper nourishment.  So, I always kept the ingredients on hand.  From the time my husband awoke me to the time the sandwich was cooked  was only about 3 minutes.

Now I still keep the ingredients on hand; however,my dear husband had to be placed in a senior living center.  He has no one at the center to cater to his late night snack demands.  However, he is getting help from professionals, and is now eating well during regular meal times.  Unfortunately, his dementia is not reversible.

This is a great comfort food sandwich to keep in your bag if tricks.  I've never met anyone who didn't like them.

I knew I was going to like this recipe but I had no idea just how tasty this simple recipe would be! Biting down into this bad boy was a true treat that I'd recommend to just about anyone. I'd stress, as others have, that the ketchup is a must and shouldn't be feared.

YUM, I fried 2 eggs in olive oil, prepared them over easy, and slapped them on toasted white bread with mayo and tomatoes(instead of ketchup). Delicious! Add a variety of veggies! I wanted lettuce and onion, but didn't have any on hand (shopping day is tomorrow) Be creative!

I followd another reviewers advice and I am so glad I did. This is what I did: Toast your bread and spread with mayo and ketchup. Then I took an oversized coffee cup and sprayed with pam then cracked an egg into it. Then I poked 3 small holes in the yoak. Then cover the cup losely with wax paper and put it into the microwave for 45 seconds. Then add your salt and pepper and slide it onto your bread and top with cheese. I will never be going to get McDonalds breakfast again!

I looove these! My dad used to make them for me on the weekends..I make them and take them with me to work in the morning once in a while..I break the yolk in the pan so it doesn't make such a mess...I also use old cheddar and either Ketchup OR mayo...not both.

Surprisingly gross.  Not sure how it could taste so bad when it was such a simple, straightforward recipe.  I think the ketchup/mayo combo with the egg just doesn't mix well.

This is an old standby in my family with a couple of exceptions. Cheddar, no processed cheese, a thin slice of ham, anything but white (paste) bread, and NO CATSUP. What makes it is using Salsa instead of catsup. That is the magical ingredient, whether served on a plate with toast on the side, or as a sandwich. Mmmmm When my duaghters and I talk about their childhood, this breakfast always comes up. Has to have been good. Eggs and salsa were made for each other.

I am always reminded since we have chickens, the value of an egg! My friend is always telling me to fix a fried egg sandwich! This one is fabulous... and I have to say, was quick and easy! I left off the ketchup, only because it wasn't my preference!

Just love egg sandwiches!  And, you are right, quick, easy, better than that McD thing.  I have made them for years and I wish to suggest one more condiment to add.  People think I am nuts, but I grew up with this.  Take a small piece of egg sandwich and put "sweet relish" on it with the ketchup.  Mom made them that way and I couldn't argue with mom.

Why is everyone so afraid of adding ketchup?! Ketchup is key to this delicious sandwich. (Usually though, I do not add cheese, cuts the fat). Not just for breakfast, this sandwich is great any time of the day.

There is nothing better than an egg sandwich on plain white toast! My favourite variations are to use HP Sauce instead of ketchup or use Marmite with stout Irish cheese on Irish bread.

I can't believe anyone actually needed a recipe for this.  I've been making and eating fried egg sandwiches since I was a kid, and I'm old now.  If the bread is toasted, I've even made them and taken them to work for lunch-time.  But I really don't like ketchup on eggs of any style.  Possibly BBQ sauce.

Ok,  I'll add my 2cents...I have been making fried egg sandwiches for ever and have taught my husband and kids to make their own.  I know ketchup is good on eggs...but I don't use it on my egg sandwiches.  I use a little mustard and Miracle Whip instead of Mayo.  It adds a nice tang.  
Oh yes,  I had to give up the white bread long time ago but use any other healthy bread with grains..That was hubby's choice,  just as good tho.

Both my husband and I have been eating these since we we're kids.  Our mothers would pack these in our luched in grade school.

Love an egg sandwich - and this one fit the breakfast cravings.  I was out of ketchup so I added a fresh tomato instead.  Thanks Erica for a quick breakfast.

I can eat breakfast food for any meal of the day.  This was so good and way better than using jelly or jam.  Hubby always puts ketchup or hot sauce on his eggs so I thought why not try this one.  Big hit at our house!

We love these sandwiches! I'm very familiar with fried egg sandwiches, had them all my life. I was curious about this recipe because of the addition of mayo, I always just had them with ketchup. I was very surprised of the flavor, it's delicious. Very subtle, but adds a nice touch to a classic. A bit messy because we prefer the eggs runny, but it doesn't bother us. Thanks for sharing the new idea! :)

We love Fried Egg Sandwiches...I slow fry the eggs and after turning lay a slice of cheddar/colby-jack cheese over the egg and let it melt slowly. We use a whole grain oat bread and season with Mrs. Dash along with 3 shaved slices of roast-beef...mmmmm-good!

I grew up eating fried egg sandwiches with ketchup. My husband always had them with mayo. Neither of us ever had them with cheese before. So I used both the ketchup and mayo with the cheese and I've got to say, "Why didn't I think of that before!"

I was raised on egg sandwiches.  I prefer to scramble my eggs first and then cook them--sort of like an omelet.  I'm not a fan of egg whites.
I add tomatoes on my sandwich.

I had no idea this was a southern thing or a northern thing.  All I know  is I was raised in Nebraska and I thought my dad, my brothers and I were the only ones that liked fried egg sandwiches.  Me? I like mine with salt and pepper, crisp bacon, mayo and dill pickles.  The dill pickles seem to put others on a high ick factor, but I like it.  My big ick factor is soft eggs mashed into pancakes.  LOL

Classic breakfast sandwich right here. I grew up eating this as a treat (I come from a larger family so we only had 'egg' breakfasts once in awhile) and now offer it every so often to my son when a hot breakfast is just what he needs. Can't go wrong with this one!

it's so simple, you rarely think of making a sandwich with a fried egg, but it's soooo good. I used mustard and mayo, and maybe fresh tomato if I had any left.

Delicious. I knew this would be good when I saw it had mayonnaise and ketchup on it. The same ingredients that make a mean salad dressing. With my sandwich I used cheddar cheese, grilled onions, jalapenos, and then grilled the bread on both sides for a minute. Its going to be necessary to try it with bacon next time.

Awesome fast and easy breakfast sandwich. I have made these for years for my family of 3 boys. Spray glass small round ramkin with Pam, break egg up in the dish, cook 45 seconds, turn egg over, put on a slice of Canadian bacon, a slice of cheese, microwave for 30 more seconds. Put on toasted English muffins or bagels. Couldn't be easier. I usually use the same dish to make several sandwiches as they are so fast and easy to make and then you only have to clean one dish. You can add minced onion, peppers, etc., to change it. We have made 100's of these and now my boys and grandchildren are making their own. Like I said couldn't be easier. No excuse for not grabbing a quick breakfast. I have also made these healthier with whole wheat muffins or  bagels and use egg substitute or egg whites with no cheese or low fast cheese.

Mmmm! I've had plenty of fried egg/cheese sandwiches with ketchup...but this was the first time I added mayo...it was sooo good! I used reduced fat mayo and fat free processed cheese and it was still fantastic.

Pretty decent, but next time I am going to use picante instead and toast the bread lightly, then finish it by grilling the sandwich. This would be great with an omelet inside. A lot of possibilites to keep this from getting old.

I have been making these since I was in elementary school (without the ketchup though). I LOVE them and I've gotten every one of my room mates and family members addicted to them. Try making them on bagels! Thanks for posting this Erica.

So easy! I tried out the microwave way and cooked an egg for about a minute. Remember to put something over the egg or else you will be cleaning your microwave like me! I like to add a little bit of garlic to the egg and add low fat mayo to the bun. I love how fast it is!

I season my eggs with S&P during cooking, use ff cheese, wheat toast and lite mayo and otherwise followed the recipe as written. It was tasty, but the combo of mayo/ketchup didn't quite do it for me so I will keep looking - but if you know you like those two together this is a great breakfast sandwich! (I was wondering if it would remind me of the hamburgers we used to eat in Senegal, West Africa - they had fried eggs on them and the usual burger condiments too). :)

This was a great easy breakfast sandwich.  I changed it slightly:  used two eggs per sandwich rather than one.  I wanted to add bacon, but didn't have any on hand so I added some real bacon pieces (bits) to the eggs while they cooked.  I used sliced block cheddar instead of processed cheese, and served as an open faced sandwich.  I added mayo to the bread, and my boyfriend chose to try with the ketchup.  Not the most elegant looking breakfast, but very tasty and quite easy.

Have made this for years and made one for myself again this morning. Sometimes I add lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, ham, etc. Today, in order to make it healthier, I made an open face sandwich and omitted the second slice of bread and fried my egg in Pam instead of butter. I have never used the ketchup. I can see maybe adding a touch of salsa but ketchup? hmmm. These are great to make and hand to my teenagers in a paper towel so that they can have a healthy breakfast, of sorts, on their way to school in the morning. Thanks for the post here!

This recipe is simple and straightforward. I’d never tried ketchup along with mayonnaise before on a fried egg sandwich and loved it! The changes I made were using coconut oil instead of butter (just trying to tone down my butter use in cooking lately), added a slice of ham, and threw a few dabs of tapatio as I do every time I eat fried eggs!

Good combination, but not the least bit imaginative. I don't understand why so many people don't like the mayo/ketchup combination... it's called Russian dressing, and it's been around since I was a little kid (90 years ago.) This works great served on one of my home-made pitas that I make every week on the outside gas grill. The essential addition is the habanero pepper sauce I make every year.

This is one of my favorite breakfasts to eat. It was quick to make and so delicious. I'm not big on ketchup so I didn't use it. Instead I used a slice of sharp cheddar cheese (or pepper jack cheese) and I placed the eggs over the cheese so that it can melt faster. If you love spiciness then you can add some hot sauce, jalapeños diced up or even sprinkle some cayenne pepper over the eggs. If your not into that, bacon will never fail you. Enjoy!

I love fried egg sandwiches, and I have never put ketchup on it. ... I must say, I will probably not try it again. No fault of the recipe--lots of taste buds will like this, I'm sure.  I will most likely stick to just a little butter. The ketchup made me think that a hamburger patty needed to be on the sandwich. The mayo wasn't all that bad. I may try mayo again, and use hot sauce instead of ketchup ... if I feel like experimenting.

Very good, yes even with the ketchup!!!   Another way to make it is to use mustard and pickle relish instead of ketchup and mayo.    My husband used to eat those and I was totally repulsed.....til I tried it :)

Fairly good but why, why would anyone use PROCESSED cheese.  Grate some cheddar or whatever cheese.  But processed - never for taste.

I'm writing this review for some extra things people could possibly add to the sandwich. I used butter on my toast and sprinkled garlic salt onto the toast and then I used some crushed red pepper on egg. I thought it tasted a lot better that way, but it's always personal preference.

This truly is THE BEST egg and cheese sandwich out there! So simple yet bursting with flavor! Now granted I am from Pittsburgh so we pretty much put Heinz ketchup on everything but this is an amazing combo worth a try!

I'm trying to learn as much easy recipes as I can, seeing that I will be ready to go out into the world on my own in a few years and luckily, I had all the ingredients listed. These came out fantastic. I have never made sunny side up eggs, let alone eggs with ketchup or mayo, but the sandwiches are amazing. I'll be making them again for breakfast here in a little bit!

I saw my daughter making this very sandwich recipe yesterday before I read it today! A fried egg, cheese, ketchup, seasonings. It looked delicious. I have to say I didn't think one needed a recipe for such a simple sandwich but the possibilities are endless and that's what recipes are all about, isn't it? May I also say I enjoy and benefit from this site tremendously. Thanks to all the recipe providers and reviewers.

Yes, it is easy to make fried egg sandwiches without a recipe, but sometimes they just hit the spot, and seeing this on allrecipes reminded me to share this: we have breakfast for dinner one night a week, and a fried egg sandwich is perfect for that!  Try it at your house -- it's cheap, quick, easy and it gives you the chance to try out all of those brunch and breakfast recipes you don't get to make on all of those "cereal" mornings!

My hubby taught me how to make this amazing anytime meal.  His version, is great if your looking for a low fat alternative.  He spices with pepper and cayenne and instead of cheese or mayo he uses chili sauce. The green chili sauce is my fave.  It gives this recipe a real kick!

I have made egg sandwiches for quite some time quite similar to this recipe - but I use cheddar or jack cheese, whole or honey wheat bread and omit the ketchup. You may also try to trickle some maple syrup on the eggs instead of using cheese to satisfy your sweet tooth ... ;-)

Fried egg sandwiches have been a favorite of mine forever.  The cheese was a good addition - skipped the mayo.  We grew up with the egg on plain untoasted bread, with ketchup.  I'm not a fan of ketchup but it is a must on a fried egg sandwich.

I haven't tried this recipe yet but like what it makes. I refuse to rate a recipe before giving the original a try without changes.

If more would try this we would have a more complete recipe storage with honest improvements!

Make the recipe first, then add your improvements afterwards.

I was forced to add a rating so I gave it 5 stars.

I laughingly agree with Bigdaddywf that a recipe shouldn't be needed for a fried egg sanny. Growing up in the south this was breakfast most Saturday morning when we were given one and kicked out of the house for the day. Add bacon slices. Yummy

I used bacon fat and added crumpled bacon to the top.  Did not use mayonnaise or ketchup.  I did have some on the table but it was not used.  Delicious without it.

Fried Egg sandwiches were/are a staple ever since I can remember. I can't think of going Ice Fishing without a generous number of them for toasting over an open fire while waiting for a bite. Delicious! :-D ~ OwlOak

Fried egg sandwiches have been a staple for our family for a long time.  Don't know if I can bring myself to try ketchup on them, but maybe I'll summon the courage some day.  Prefer mine with pepper jack cheese and just a little ranch dressing, and in the summertime a slice of tomato.  A couple of dashes of hot sauce doesn't hurt either.

I LOVE fried egg sandwiches! I've made them for years. Toasted with still runny yolk for breakfast or with fully cooked yolk for a cold lunch sandwich on bread. I've never used mayo just ketchup with or without meat and/or cheese. Add whatever you like and make on your favourite bread or bun - delish!

Loved this without the ketchup but as is, the ketchup and the runny egg together was too much. If it was scrambled or completely fried, not as bad. Adding bacon never hurts either (well, if you don't mind the calories.)

Instead of white toast, we use toasted English Muffin bread, makes all the difference.  Also, a slice of Provolone cheese and sometimes a slice of Canadian bacon.  I love the ketchup, my husband likes justs a small bit of butter on the toast.

Well what can I say.  I used black cheddar thick slices and i love mayo and kc.  I used multigrain toast to give it some fibre and texture.  It was heaven.  A definete winner.

Thanks for reminding me of this great breakfast option. I'm always in a rush in the morning and end up eating during my drive to school. I like stuff that I can eat with one hand (I know that I shouldn't be driving and eating, sorry) and this fit the bill perfectly. I used 2 eggs in my sandwich, shredded cheddar and mustard. Thanks to all the other reviewers for some great suggestions. I'll be trying them out over the course of the semester.

We used to make these all the time in high school!! Simple to make and the ingredients are always on hand. We always used jumbo eggs (double yolks - YUM!), salt and pepper, left off the cheese and slathered them with mayo. Sounds weird, but so good and EASY!

I haven't made this version with the ketchup, but make my own fried eggs to medium doneness, throw on a slice of American cheese to the cooked egg; use MW bacon (4 slices to 2 sandwiches) and toast English Muffins (whole grain), butter them and assemble. Sooo much better than McD's bacon egg and cheese sandwiches, and quick and easy.

I was so surprised at how good this was. I've been making this at least once a week since I found this recipe and it is SO good! I asked my boyfriend if he wanted one the other day and he was less than enthused about the idea (he's a strictly scrambled egg or omelet guy), but he was singing its praises after the first bite. Only thing I do differently is use wheat toast. Yum Yum Yum. Thanks!

Great Breakfast!  I used sourdough bread, extra sharp cheddar, *less* butter, and traded the mayo and katsup for honey.

Very good! I flipped the egg, cooking it just enough so the yolk was a little runny but not a mess. Great with sliced ham, melted provolone, and ketchup on a whole-wheat english muffin.

Brought me back to my childhood! My father would make this for me (although I thought it was unusual with the mayo and ketchup, I loved it) and I'm glad to see it here!

Loved this recipe.  I did not put mayo or ketchup on.  I also added bacon on top of the egg and cheese.  Used potato bread.  Could make for breakfast, lunch or supper.  Thanks

Husband makes fun of me for putting ketchup on everything, especially eggs. Maybe it's a British thing... Anyway, fried egg sandwiches are a staple with us. We prefer ours without mayo, and Husband is still not convinced about the ketchup. I wouldn't eat them any other way.

this recipe makes a pretty tasty sandwich. we fried our eggs over medium & added sausage patties however passed on the sauce since the boyfriend isn't a catsup fan & i don't care much for mayo. i agree with the reviewers who think english muffins would work well here too. thanks erica!

My husband has been making these sandwiches for years.  Only difference is he uses English muffins, toasted, and usually puts on a sausage patty.  To make sure the sausage doesn't shrink up too much, he presses them between the bottoms of two dessert plates.  They flatten out nicely, then when they shrink up during cooking, they are just the right size.  Skip on the salt, there is plenty in the cheese and sausage (if you use it) already.  Also, we don't use the mayo or ketchup, the flavor is good enough on it's own.  Perhaps we'll try it that way some time.  Quick and easy.

I love fries egg sandwhiches. I dont like mayo and ketchup. I butter my toast. Better to make at home than to order as a fast food breakfast.
