1.5.17  Cookies in the oven, started to put things away, and then I realized I forgot to add the baking power...YIKES!  Well, I guess that it didn’t matter because they were simply delicious anyway.  The cookie dough is very easy to work with, and since the recipe author doesn’t tell you how big they should be, I used a 2-1/4” cutter.  The cookie dough is tender, flavorful, and the apple filling will make you think you’re eating a piece of apple pie.  I don’t bake often, but I’d definitely make these again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

These are amazingly good. Huge hit at an event last week. I made a double batch and was glad I did!!! I used a 2 1/4" cutter and it worked well, could make them a tiny bit bigger, but not much. The beauty of these is that they are just right at a small size, very rich and a great balance of cookie and pastry dough.

I  made these  using the recipe for apples also by dropping the cinnamon used cherry pie filling both were good. The only trouble was the cookie was a little soggy may try baking a little longer next time.

Delicious! I used only two teaspoons vanilla, as two tablespoons seemed wrong.  A wine glass two inches across made 24 cookies.  I cut the apple slices in half to fit the cookie, easily cut with a spoon right in the can and then placed on the cookie bottom.  Next time I will try making fresh apple filling.

They are okay. if i tried it again  I would roll the dough thinner.  I didn't get 24 but i used 3" cutter since it dosen't say what size and cut up pie filling a little to make it fit better.
