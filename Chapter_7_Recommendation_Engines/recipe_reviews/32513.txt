I used doubled this and used frozen bananas which eliminated the need for ice. Doubling this recipe made just enough for my two kids and I. We thought this was very tasty--the combination of pineapple and banana is yummy!

This recipe is a good one!  The first time I made it I added some orange juice to it for a little more of an orange flavor.  I made it again and tried some frozen mixed berries along with the banana, and that was excellent too! You can use banana, or other fruit combinations and it will probably turn out good every time!

I made this to go along with my breakfast tortilla (also on this site).  I didn't use near 1 cup of pineapple juice...mainly because I only have 1 can of pineapple and I need that for my meatballs tonight.  I used a couple of tablespoons and added about 5 peices of pineapple.  I also added a container of yogurt and a splash of vanilla extract.  5 a day right!!  Thanks Margo

This smoothie didn't knock any sox off here. Its pretty bland for us. However, it was very good with a more intensely flavored juice such as orange or apple. Thanks Margo.

I thought this was pretty good.  I used frozen bananas and left out the ice, for less watered down flavor.

I also used frozen bananas like many people here suggested and the first time added 1 cup of pineapple juice and a teaspoon white sugar(cause I didn't have honey) and it came out pretty thick,like ice cream,very yummy(and healthy).Second time I added a bit more pineapple juice and no sugar/honey whatsoever,it came out good but I liked the taste the first time better(with the sugar)...Deff will make it again and this time I'll use honey.

This was a welcome change from the typical yogurt/berry smoothies. It's different in flavor, sort of tropical. It doesn't have that characteristic berry/yogurt smoothie tang and is refreshingly lighter and not so intense; darned near thirst quenching because of the addition of the fair amount of ice. Both of us loved this one.

It was great, but I added 1/2 cup coconut milk and it tasted like a tropical drink. I love it.

I agree, this smoothie is very bland. Not bad, but lacks flavor. I will probably not make this smoothie again.

Great smoothie. And if you aren't a big fan of  banana smoothies you can always substitute with other fruit.

I made these at my sons school at they were a huge hit!  The kids loved them.  Very easy to make.  I measured the juice, estimated the bananas and ice and added a squirt of honey.  Terrific recipe!   I'm serving them again this weekend at a pool party.  Thanks.

I thought this was pretty good. I made 1/2 recipe and it made 2 descent sized servings. I make another pineapple and banana smoothie from on here that is a little more creamier. This one is also a tad sweet compared to that one. However, it was still tasty.

This was really good. I didn't have any pineapple juice so I used reduced calorie/sugar orange juice and I left out the honey. Next time I will use a little less ice.

We made this with Trader Joe's pineapple juice, and also used frozen bananas. We thought it was delicious. Thanks for a great smoothie! We will make it even during the busy workweek as it is quick to prepare.
