This is similar to the recipe I use. There is one thing I do a bit different that adds a ton of flavor. I take a package of bacon and cook it in the large pot to start. Pull the bacon out but leave the grease and use that to cook the onions. You get the wonderful flavor of bacon in the onions and throughout the chowder. I crumble the bacon that I cooked and top the chowder with it before serving.

I'm lazy.  If a recipe touts itself as a "crock pot" recipe (as this does in the tag line/footnote), I don't want to brown, sautee, or sear, that defeats the purpose of the crockpot in my world.  So, rather than follow the directions and essentially cook the soup before using the crock pot to keep it warm/allow the flavors to meld, I tossed it all in the crock pot (sans celery) and left it on low while we were at work.  We came home to a delicious dinner.  The appearance was a tad off due to my lazy method (you could a see a bit of the butter pooling, but a quick stir took care of it), but it was tasy, nonetheless.  I was a bit concerned the half and half would curdle, but it didn't (I used fat free, not sure if that made a difference or not).  The only reason for 4 stars is it needs a lot of salt.  I know it says "to taste", but I used at least a T or more to give it some flavor (and even MR. LTH, who doesn't generally use salt, added more at service).  I think I'd prefer a seasoned salt of some sort next time.  THANKS for the recipe!

Best soup I have ever made...my family agrees!  I cooked my own bone-in chicken breasts with bouillion cubes, a celery stalk, whole peeled onion and a whole carrot...I discarded the cooked veggies and used the broth from that for my base.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing, except maybe to chop the veggies in the recipe in a food processor to save time!

Made this last night and it was delicious and very easy.  I only had 1% milk so I used that instead of half and half and it was still yummy.  Definately will make this again.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. Loved how the roux and sautéed veggies were a combined step. Easy to follow and a perfect, creamy soup. I've never added nutmeg to my chicken soup before. Delicious.

As for the seasoning/salt issue, rotisserie chicken tends to be much saltier than raw or home prepared, so perhaps that is where others were surprised by the need to add more salt. if you don't sauté the veggies too, it will reduce flavor A LOT.

This is wonderful.  Like another reviewer, I put everything (even the stick of butter) in the slow cooker.  I added a lot of seasoning salt, hot sauce, and black pepper to my liking, but otherwise, I followed the recipe to the T.  Every time I eat some, I have to have seconds.  I've told so many people about the recipe.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I made it exactly according to the recipe which I always do for the first time. 

I made this chowder using rotisserie chicken from Costco.  I did cut the recipe in half because it is only my husband and myself at home.
We liked it very much, especially the tip about adding the vegetable to the roué.  I will do that more often in the future.

It was very good but could have used a little more flavor so you don't need to add so much salt & pepper. I'd hate to add an herb like rosemary or cumin because it would change the flavor too much.  We did have leftovers and I added a little more salt & pepper, a little poultry seasoning and 3 strips of crumbled bacon as others suggested.  This enhanced the flavor without really changing the original taste.  

For all those who left out the carrots and celery I would like to offer a tip.  Diced them until they are teeny-tiny.  My husband always pulls the carrots out of stew, soup or chicken pies but he doesn't even notice them when I do this and I get to add those flavors.  

I am sure I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing Athyna .

I make a very similar Pennsylvania Dutch Chicken Corn Soup recipe.  That version is more 'brothy' rather than creamy as it doesn't use the half & half.  I also add about 4-5 sliced hard-boiled eggs.  Otherwise, the same.  I usually cook the chicken & use the broth, as others have mentioned.  (Another version my father-in-law uses is to use canned creamed corn to cut the half & half, if you are looking to cut some fat/dairy/calories.)  I like to use only white sweet corn.  Great with a crusty bread.

I made this and substituted leftover cooked, shredded turkey for the chicken, I also used 2 cups of 2% milk and 1 cup of light cream in place of the half-and-half.  The chowder was plenty thick, and just a little bit lighter!  Super-comforting dish!!

This is definitely a winner, I've made this recipe twice. The only thing I did different was instead of rotisserie chicken, I just used a store bought grilled chicken and finely chopped it myself. Also I added a small amount of pork Tasso which is a spicy Cajun sausage.  This is sure to be one of my repeat dishes, can't wait to bring it to church for Men's group annual potluck where we cook for our wives and daughters.

Amazing recipe. One change was to cook five slices of chopped bacon in the pot and use some bacon drippings along with less butter to saute the veggies. And I used 2% Milk instead of half and half. Topped the soup bowls with cooked bacon when served. The family loved this chowder!

The fun of finding a recipe that inspires your taste buds is to make it and add or omit to your "personal" preferences.  This recipe would probably be  good if you followed it exactly, however, it's absolutely divine if you tweak it and experiment a bit.  I took the advice of a few others and did add more flavoring as I kept tasting as I made it.  I added celery salt, garlic salt and did cook the onion in bacon fat.  I'm so glad I found this recipe as it's such a great meal with some fresh sourdough bread to accompany - a definite keeper!

This is a very tasty recipe and a new favorite!  And with the new guidelines to avoid sugar instead of fat, I used the full amount of butter.  I simplified it even further though.  Instead of using another pot, I sauteed the onion, parsnip (instead of carrot, which my hubbie doesn't like), and celery in the soup pot and sprinkled the flour into that pot.  When it was time, I added the other ingredients except for the chicken.  Ten minutes before I expected the potatoes to be done, I added the shredded rotisserie chicken breast.   Delish! 03/26/2017

This chowder is very easy to make and very tasty! I made it a few hours early and kept it warm in the crockpot until dinner. I always bought Campbell's chicken and corn chowder because I liked it. But, this is better! I will be making my own chowder from now on. It's cheaper to make my own anyway! Some reviewers said they omitted the half and half, but then you have soup instead of chowder!(It's the "cream" that makes it a chowder.) I will try it with bacon next time, but it was still very good. Some reviewers said it was bland, or that it needed a lot of salt. The ones who said that had made their own broth. When you buy the broth it is usually salty and you won't need to add much salt, if any. I didn't use a rotisserie chicken but I seasoned the chicken when I cooked it. I used boneless thighs because that is what I had. I think dark meat adds more flavor anyway. Served with garlic bread.

This is my new favorite recipe.  My husband loves it, also.  The first time i made it, I used all 2 1/2 cups of the half and half.  The second time i made it I only used 1/2 cup of half and half and an extra cup of chicken broth and it was just as good, if not better.  And it definitely had fewer calories by only adding 1/2 cup of half/half. I think you could also get away with adding NO half/half and it would still taste very good.  I did add a few shakes of poultry seasoning, which is just a personal preference.  Also used the entire chicken, white and dark meat, and only 3 potatoes, but they were very large potatoes.

Worked well for me. Like a previous reviewer, I didn't have chicken stock. I boiled the chicken and used the broth. It may have had a more rich flavor with stock but I had already subbed 1/4 bacon fat for some of the butter so nobody noticed. I would recommend paying attention to salt and pepper amounts. This chowder is heavy on corn, potatoes and cream - all of which soak up salt. After cooking and adding salt at various steps, it still wasn't "salty". If you're worried about adding too much salt during the process, just add to taste at serving time. Froze well, too.

We loved this delicious, easy soup! I did use boiled chicken breasts, and was excellent! I was skeptical of cooking the potatoes AFTER adding roux and half & half, but it worked beautifully! I used 2 regular sized cans of yellowv/white corn. Didn't even know that they were packaged together until now! Bottom line...AWESOME SOUP WITH ENOUGH FOR LOTS OF LEFTOVERS TO SHARE(or not ;-)!)!!

Love this delicious soup on a cold day. I add an jalapeño to the carrot/celery/onion mix and cayenne with the half and half to give it a kick.

This was fun to prepare. I did not use butter, I chopped 10 slices of bacon and added the carrot, celery, onion, garlic and then I added 2 diced Jalapenos and cooked the entire mix together then I added the flour and added everything into the slow cooker. I also added 2 cans of creamed corn to mine. I did not add any salt but I added a lot of fresh ground pepper. This was absolutely an amazing soup, and my house smelled wonderful. My roommate said he was drooling all day long, the bacon really adds a ton of flavor. I got the bacon idea from one of your other reviews by angel090401. I served this with Jalapeno Cheddar rolls and it was a huge hit, I had enough left over to freeze half and feed us a few more times.

I made this today and it came out delicious! I used 3 cans of chicken broth and used the whole rotisserie chicken minus the wings and drumsticks. It made quite a bit! It came out rich and thick. I also used a whole can of yellow corn and a small can of white corn. I added salt and pepper to taste, as well as some Tony Chachere's seasoning, local to NOLA. Off to have my second bowl!

Oh my!!! This soup was to die for!! I added a little extra corn and potatoes and used more chicken. I used 1 1/2 cups skim milk and 1 cup of fat free cream. I did use real butter. This meant I had to use more stock. The roux was easy and added so much flavor --- the depth of flavor would not have been reached with everything done in a crock pot. A meal in itself!!!

Good recipe - I cooked & shredded some chicken earlier in the day for this; cheated & used canned golden corn.  Easy peasy recipe!  I tweaked it just a bit & added some turmeric in final stage to give it nice happy color so it didn't look too pale.  And fresh ground multi colored peppercorns.  Yummy with a big chunk of Safeway's bakery dutch crunch bread.  Next time I may make a curried variation & take away the half and half for my grown daughter who is lactose intolerant.

I mostly followed the recipe but substituted 2% evaporated milk for the 1/2 & 1/2 & used celery seed in place of celery.  I also made my own stock by boiling the chicken (we'd used the breast meat for another meal) & used all the meat that was left from the legs & thighs.  Great way to finish off a rotisserie chicken & make a nice meal with our least favorite parts!

Loved it! Followed the recipe except I left out carrots because I don't like them and added more flour since I like it thick. Really good on a chilly day. Made it in the slow cooker and it turned out great!

This was excellent.
I didn't have the two types of corn as suggested.  I sautéed chicken breasts and sprinkled them with some smoked applewood rub spice (to give that rotisserie flavour) and then shredded them.
I didn't have enough frozen corn - so I used a combination of frozen corn and rinsed can corn.  This was super easy and very flavourful.  My husband and son love bacon, so I sprinkled bacon bits in their bowls....delicious.

Haven't tried the recipe, but want to.  Looks delicious!  Can fat-free half & half be used instead if regular?

Instant favorite!! My husband's reaction of "Mmm!" and going in for another taste test 100% confirms my opinion  I will definitely add this to my meal rotation, especially when it starts getting colder. I made a couple of changes due to limitations of available groceries near me - i used 2 10 oz bags of frozen yellow corn instead of half  white/half yellow, and i used milk instead of half and half and just added an extra 1/4 cup of sweet cream butter to make up for the creaminess of the half and half. I will definitely try adding bacon to it next time, as was recommended other reviews!

I added some finely chopped cooking ham to the vegetable saute and some finely chopped jalapeno.  Very good today...tomorrow is always better after the flavors marry together overnight.

This soup is terrific!  The nutmeg compliments the rest of the flavors nicely.  Making the roux with the veggies is genius and helps make the chowder creamy.  Changes I made (only because I'm trying to use up cans in my pantry) were using evaporated milk, and 1 can of salt-free corn and 1 can of creamed corn.  I also added some hot pepper flakes for some heat. This recipe seems very adaptable and is very easy to make.

This is an excellent recipe!  One of my families favourites!  I'm not sure why anyone would do this soup in a crock pot when it's ready for the table in two hours.  I also used bacon fat instead of the butter and sprinkled the bacon in at the end.  It's the go to soup this winter, it's a five star plus star to me

I cut up the celery, carrot onion and potato the night before and put them in a sealed tupperware with the chicken stock and a can of whole kernel corn including the liquid.  The next morning I threw it all in the slow cooker all day.  I cooked the chicken in the oven and poured it the broth from that.  Cut the chicken up and threw that in as well as a can of creamed corn.  Let that sit for a while then I added 2 cups of light cream.  It was delicious!!

I thought the chowder was bland, but my husband loved it. Next time I will try the tip of Browning onions in bacon grease and using reserved bacon as a crumbled garnish on finished soup.

I made this the other night and the family loved it!  I only used 1 1/2 cups of half & half and it came out great.  Oh, and instead of flour, I used cornstarch (1/4 cup)...still came out great!

Great recipe! I threw it all in the crockpot while I slept during the day so dinner was ready when I woke up. Also, I used soy half/half instead of lactose because my bf is lactose intolerant. The substitution actually worked well bc it added a very subtle sweetness. I also added some spices like Italian seasoning, chicken bouillon cubes and Cajun seasoning to give it more flavor.

Very easy and delicious, id def make it again!

I made this two nights ago and my family couldn't get enough!  I subbed out 3/4 c. heavy cream for the half and half (that was all I had) and only used two tablespoons of butter (again, that was all I had left) and it was divine!  So delicious that my family all asked that I make this a regular on our menu!  Thanks for this recipe!

I love cooking and try recipes on here(as they are posted) all the time(that way I TRULY know if I need to add something or maybe I just need to allow myself to try new things/taste/flavors. My palate(did I spell that right?) is special... My mom wasn't feeling too well and trying to adhere to a diet but I knew she needed SOMEthing and somehow I stumbled across this recipe...made it as is and still throughly enjoyed it! Thank you so much for sharing!!!! Never used nutmeg and will do it next time with whatever I do to make it my own. Thank you, thank you, thank you, again!

We love soups in the colder months with a hearty loaf of artisan bread!  I have been trying to find a corn chowder like my mom's and this came close!  I had a bag of frozen yellow corn, and a can of creamed corn in the pantry, so that's what I used.  This recipe needed some seasoning though!  I like that the recipe calls for nutmeg which is great in creamy soups.  I also added a half of small jar of pimento which gives great flavor to creammy soupy and used white pepper.

I just made this recipe and I was disappointed... It lacks flavor and is very bland.. It needs a lot of salt and pepper.  I added cumin powder and extra nutmeg plus a little cayenne and chili powder to get some flavor going..  It was so so bland if you follow the recipe like I did..

I added 1 more cup of chicken broth because I like my soup saucy and used 2 cups half & half and 1/2 cup milk. Just because I didn’t want to buy another carton. Next time I will definitely cook and salt the potatoes by themselves. Even on low heat the soup was sticking but the potatoes weren’t done. It’s very tasty

This is a wonderful recipe. So much flavor comes from really simple ingredients and just a few spices. Skip the other AR recipes that call for adding creamed corn and use this one.

I took advantage of the fact that fresh sweet corn is in season. I broiled several ears (and increased the overall recipe to accommodate), then cut off the kernels and used them that way. This adds just a bit of some nice, smokey flavor.

Made this with a roasted chicken I had leftover from a bbq the night before. Made a chicken stock from the carcass then used the leftover mashed potatoes in place of the russets (saved me using the cornstarch mix) also used the chicken gravy from the cast pan drippings in place of the bouillon. Tastes great!

What do you do with leftover Rotisserie Chicken???  I will never have to ask that again. Terrific and easy to make. I use fresh corn for that added sweetness.

I followed the basics of this recipe with what I had on hand.  When I freeze corn in the summer, I boil the stripped cobs in chicken stock to extract all the corn flavor and then freeze the broth for chowders such as this.  So I used that; did not use the roux because I used just one can of creamed corn which thickened it nicely; added a small can of mild green chilis and a little ancho chili powder.  Served w/ cornbread on the side.

Delicious! I did make a few alterations though. I used canned cream corn and regular canned corn. Added more onion, garlic, carrots, and celery than the recipe called for. Left out the chicken and added 8 oz of cream cheese. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and directions. Was a big hit.

I followed this recipe with just a few differences. I cooked my chicken beforehand in Better than Bouillon and I also added a little cooked bacon during the cooking process. My family also adds more bacon and cheese when it’s served. This is our favorite chowder.

Made this tonight...my wife has a new favorite! I added bacon to the recipe...rendered about 6 slices and then cooked the veggies in the drippings. Followed the recipe the rest of the way. It's not chowder if it doesn't have bacon!

Followed the suggestion of adding bacon (I used 1/2 lb) and cooking the onions, celery, carrots in some (about 1/2 c)  of the bacon grease. Drained off rest of grease and added about 1/4 c butter.   Used matchstix carrots and diced them as a time saver. Also partially cooked the potatoes in the microwave before dicing.  Used 1/2  (white and dark meat) of a rotisserie chicken.  Did not add any flour - it was thick and meaty. Very tasty.

Very easy. Used creamed corn instead of kernels, as it was all I had. Overdid the nutmeg, but balanced it out with pepper, cayenne, and lemon juice.

This was a great recipe which I embellished with jalapeño peppers, red bell peppers, and bacon. I used cooked chicken breast from the freezer as well as sweet corn we had frozen from last summer. In addition, I used whole milk and added a bit more butter.  Adding bacon gives this dish a well rounded, more flavorful end result, for sure. I will definitely make again. I made the entire dish in a pressure cooker (Instant Pot) making it very simple to clean up.

This soup was a huge hit in my house.   My husband and young adult sons raved about it.  I made a few slight modifications. I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.  Because the finished soup seemed to need a some additional spice for flavor, I added roasted red pepper flakes.  

This is a soup I will make again!

This was delicious, but next time I’ll cut the amount of flour by half. For me, it was too thick (although extra stock or water could thin it).  Thanks for this...great winter soup!

Easy, tasty recipe! I was able to make it exactly as the recipe directed once, then needed to change it a bit as I didn't have enough 1/2 & 1/2 the second time I made it. I did add a bit more salt than was called for.

I made this and it was amazing! I was complimented by every family member and will definitely make again but I did make quite a few changes since I didn't have all ingredients. I made this using leftover  turkey from the holidays. Since I dodnt have chicken stock I boiled the skin and fat for 20 min in 6 cups of water and added onion powder ginger salt garlic a few shakes of each. I also threw in 2 tablespoons diced onions. Afte4 20 min removed skin and fat from broth about 4 cups left.  I was short 1 potatoe and 1 cup of corn. To make up for it I added 2 extra carrots and 1 green pepper. at the end I realized I didn't have enough half n half so did 1 1/2 cups plus half cup skim milk and tablespoon of bacon bits. I followed the rest of the recipe except only other change was I blended 4 cups of finished soup until thick liquid and dumped back in just to thicken it up. Topped with green onions minced and shredded sharp cheddar salt n pepper. Its just perfect for cold winter day and my family just raved about it!

Holy crud that was flipping excellent!  I sauteed a bunch of raw chicken breast instead of buying and deboning a couple of roasters.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee and DE-FRICKIN-LICIOUS

I love chicken corn chowder!!  It was delicious, however, I made some small changes.  When cooking the celery, carrots and onions I used a small amount of butter and coconut oil.  I also added turkey bacon at the end for more flavor.  I omitted the nutmeg and implemented some paprika, celery salt and parsley.   Fantastic meal that lasts for days!

We made this with leftover Cornish game hen & corn cut off the cob- delicious!  The only deviations we made from the recipe was: used 1/2 cup less half & half and used only two potatoes.

Loved this!  I'm not much of a cream soup person, but this was yummy!   I added I small can of chopped tomatoes, a few more spices (parsley, garlic salt) and only had 1% milk, but it was fine. Used rotisserie chicken from store.  Voila!  Lots of veggies and tasty dinner. Sprinkled Montery Jack cheese when serving  
 :)

I modified this recipe slightly. 

First I made my own chicken I roasted 4 thighs and 2 breasts in the oven with olive oil, salt and pepper, Bell's seasoning, and herbs de Provence. 400 degrees for 30 minutes. I felt this extra step would help with how little seasoning was in the recipe. 

I also cooked my veggies a bit before adding the butter to the pan. I wanted them to be caramelize to for that extra flavor, and I seasoned them with Bell's and salt an pepper, again due to the lack of spicing. 

These are the only modifications I used and I think it turned out better than the original recipe would, but I liked this recipe because it was an easy jump off point to make my own thing.

I will definitely make this delicious soup again!  My 4 y.o. daughter (who eats veggies like they're fruit) and I both loved it.  I did use less half & half as others suggested doing (1 cup) and 1 1/2 c. 2% milk, diced up a zucchini from my garden and used 
 a large sweet potato instead of regular potatoes.  The taste is still rich with less fat

This soup was fantastic. I sautéed the onions, celery, and carrots in the butter, then added flour. I also added ham later. Blended a quarter of the soup in a blender. Delicious. Will definitely make it again.

I had some smoked turkey left overs and broth I had cooked the smoked turkey carcass in that I used.  Plus I had some turkey bacon that I need to use.  It was delicious.  I used about 3/4 cup smoked turkey broth and 3/4 of the meat was smoked turkey the rest regular turkey.  I used 3 slices of turkey bacon and browned it in the pan before I added the butter with the first step of the method.

Love it!  This is a go-to in the winter.  My husband loves it and I usually have everything on hand.  Easy and delicious!!
(buy a rotisserie and shred it , separate it into 2 bags,  freeze, and you'll always have about 2 cups of shredded chicken on hand for soups or casseroles!)

Made it with following changes- tossed the vegetables in EVOO and flour- sauteed with 1/4 cup butter, then some white wine to simmer.  Added stock, potatoes, seasoning to slow cooker at high for 3 hr. Added rest into slow cooker. 3 hr low temp, added milk with 2 TBSP corn starch.1+ hr  then it is ready and tastes great. Shredded chicken on the side for those that want it (like me). Keeper dish for cold weather.

Loved this chicken corn chowder. My husband who is usually supportive of new recipes said it was a keeper recipe.  I actually used left over turkey instead of chicken, and made the bouillon with these leftovers. This made it more time consuming, but the flavors were great. Will definitely use this recipe in the future. May play with the recipe next time by adding thyme or other herb and or try bacon as was suggested in another review. May also try it in the slow cooker also. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the other reviews and used  the bacon grease to sauté my vegetables in. I also added in a jalepeno for some spice! Came out perfect! I suggest using rotisserie chicken breasts cuz they Have move flavor. Very filling soup! Can't eat it all the time but it's a nice soup to make in the winter for lunch or dinner!

I used Yukon potatoes instead since that's what I had in my kitchen.  Worked out great.  I think I'll try to cook bacon and use the grease for the onions like another reviewer did then crumble the cooked bacon on top when it's done.  Very good recipe

Loved it. Will make again. I used more onion, carrot and celery than called for .  I like a nice thick sauce so I added more roux mixture at beginning.  It's always easier to thin out than to thicken.  I added mushrooms and an 8 oz. package of mild cheddar cheese to the chowdah.  I used some thyme to it too. 
Oh, also topped off the bowl of chowdah with crispy bacon... yum.   I like mine with a little spice, so I mixed in a teaspoon or so of Tony Chaachere's creole seasoning in mine.  YUMMMM

I have made this before and have a large pot on the stove as I speak. I break it down into small freezer containers and pull one out to take to work for lunch. Excellent soup, right down to the dash of nutmeg. Thanks for the great recipe.

Im an average cook and have always shied away from making a chowder because i didn't have a clue how to do it.  This made it nice and easy and it is delicious!!.  The only change that I made that you may want to try is adding some sour cream in place of some of the half and half.  Thanks for sharing!!

My picky family loved this chowder, and so did I! I used a mixture of 1% milk and heavy cream instead of half & half, and diced chicken thighs instead of breasts, because that's what I had on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Delicious!

This was a good basic chowder.  I didn't have celery so didn't use any and I didn't have quite as much chicken available.  Could use some additional seasoning but not sure what.  I do like the dash of nutmeg which I use in my regular potato soup too.  It was plenty creamy with 2% milk (only used 2 cups) and I added a can of creamed corn to make up for the fact I didn't have half/half.

I had no nutmeg but it was still good. I didn't have 1/2 n 1/2 and substituted 1/2 block of cream cheese. 

I would make it again.  Made a cold night warm.

I made this for the first time tonight, and I absolutely loved it. It's so rich and creamy, now I know what to do with the leftover holiday turkey, other than the usual turkey sandwich. Thanks a lot for sharing this easy and tasty recipe.

I was looking for a chicken corn chowder receipe and came across ur receipt. I have a lot of food restrictions because I just started dialysis a few months ago. So here are the changes I made: I deleted the potatoes , so I made rice and put it afterwards, I substituted nondairy "Coffee Mate" ( original)  for the half n half. Amazingly this came out " Great"

Made several times in 2014 and final changes include sautéing the veggies, remove from pan, then make roux. Trying to make roux with veggies in pan was clumpy.  Added 1 lb Purdue Short Cuts chicken, less potato and more other veggies.  Made several times, Ray likes, San likes better than my scallop chowder!  Serve w cornbread, croutons or cheese stix.

I doubled the recipe ( and filled a 7quart pot nicely) and when it was finished, it was fine, but not what my family would enjoy. We love lots of spice. So I added some red pepper flakes and cumin and spiced it up a bit. We topped it off with shredded Monterey Jack, and ened up with a yummy white chili of sorts. I'll definitely use the recipe again as a base before adding my family's favorite flavors.

Cooked two boneless, skinless chicken breasts (almost two pounds, with seasoned salt and pepper) in one tablespoon butter with the vegetables, then added the remaining butter and flour to continue with the roux using the broth and cream. Added the corn and potatoes, along with the nutmeg and a little thyme, and cooked about 45 minutes. Excellent flavor.

Made this recipe as instructed but without the carrots and used red potatoes.  Diced all the veggies very, very tiny.  Used fat free half & half and it was DELICIOUS.  Make sure you add cooked bacon and shredded cheese to the top of each bowl of soup before serving.  Really enhances the flavors.

Super yummy.  I added Kale to mine and garnished with bacon.  Also, used coconut oil instead of butter for saute and for browning bread.  Made it sweet and savory.

An awesome recipe!  Since I didn't have quite enough chicken breast to shred, I shredded some of the dark meat and it was great.  I'll be making this soup for many years to come and would be proud to serve it to company...it's that good!

I just made this and it was yummy! I did make a couple of changes,  though. I browned Turkey bacon in the butter during the first step then just left it in. Since my family is dairy allergic/intolerant, I used soy creamer to get that nice, thick creamy taste without the cream. All I had was raw chicken tenderloins, so I chopped them up and tossed them in during the final simmer. It did require a lot of salt because Turkey bacon contributes only a little. I bet regular bacon would help with that. I was looking for a chicken corn chowder that didn't have jalapeno but DID have flavor. This is a good one but can imagine it being bland without the bacon.

Don't have celery? Out of half-half? Need your soup to be dairy-free? Like a little more spice?  No problem.  This is an extremely flexible and forgiving recipe that will reliably result in a tasty soup (or chowder if you prefer). Although I have used this recipe exactly as written or with minor substitutions many times, last night I put it to the test in several ways.  I didn't add any celery (I was out of it), used white potatoes instead of russet, added an extra cup of broth and skipped the dairy all together, and added most of a 7 oz can of chopped green chilis.  Also, I didn't use a rotisserie chicken but instead shredded broiled chicken breasts.  Still, the soup tasted great and had a satisfying texture.  Admittedly, while this is an easy soup to make, it is not a quick process even if you use a rotisserie chicken. I double the recipe but freeze the extra BEFORE completing the last step. Another suggestion, if you want a great soup quickly, have as many of the diced and shredded ingredients on-hand in your freezer.

I used a rotisserie chicken, used the bones to make the stock (yield about 5 cups). I also fried up about 8 thick slices of bacon and used the fat in place of the butter, to make up for that I used low fat 1/2 and 1/2. Served with a little bacon crumbles and some shredded cheddar.

I didn't add garlic or nutmeg. Instead I used rosemary (crushed) and Thyme with some parsley. I used my roast chicken left over carcass and added some thighs for the "fatty meats" While the chicken was cooking in the stock, I sautéed my celery, onions, carrots and butter but  added bacon to it as well...strained out my broth into another pot and took chicken off the bone and added all of it to the  broth, thickened with heavy cream and cornstarch and added a little milk as well. I didn't add salt as I used the Knorrs bullion to the water while the chicken was cooking and also with the bacon it was salty enough..This has always been a sig dish of mine, great fall meal!

Will definitely be making this again! Used fresh corn and cooked the cobs in the chicken broth with the chicken for extra corny flavor! Also added a can of creamed corn, and substituted 2% milk for the half and half! and red skin potatoes for the russets (I'm way to lazy to peel potatoes!). It's lengthy thick and delicious! So glad there's enough for leftovers!

Can't the onions be sautéed and the flour added just in the same pot as the soup will be made in? Why the two steps?

This is a good soup for cold weather days.  Easy to put together with left overs and things you probably already have on hand.  I serve hot sace at the table for those that like a little extra 'kick' instead of adding it in the pot.  Great with a grilled cheese sandwich on the side.

Changed this to a vegan recipe (almond milk, dairy free butter, vege stock) due to dairy allergies in our house and added red peppers. It was awesome! The whole family loved it.

We are a dairy free house so I use plain Greek yogurt instead of half and half. Add it the last 20-30 of cooking, delicious. I have done on stove top and in crock pot, both were a hit with my family.

This is an easy recipe to follow... The only thing I did different was I used all of the meat from the Chicken... I didn't want to waste any... I felt it did need Salt to taste... I made double the recipe so I could freeze some for a later date when I am running late and don't feel like cooking... I also took two quarts to work the following day for co-workers... they loved it so much they asked for the recipe too... Perfect for a cold or rainy day...

This chowder was easy to make and was a hit with my entire family.  The soup wasn't too thick or too thin.  I will definitely be making this again.

Amazing! Omitted celery, used powdered onion instead of chopped, and added a pinch of lemon herb seasoning as well. Such a comfort soup. Would be great with crusty bread.

This is a wonderful recipe for Chicken Corn Chowder.  I made the recipe just about as described, but also added about a cup of chopped cilantro, some bacon, paprika, a chopped serrano pepper, and some chipotle Tabasco to give it a little Southwestern flavor. After I also put it in the crock pot for for about 4 hours on High.  We ate our chowder with some chopped cilantro, too. Husband agreed that this recipe is a winner.  Will definitely make this chowda again!  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!

Excellent! I doubled the recipe, used 32 oz. frozen sweet corn, plus 32 oz. frozen cream corn, reduced half and half to 4 cups. All 4 kiddos and hubby loved it! Will definately make this again!:)

Made this following the recipe, held off adding salt until just before serving. Used about the same amount of chicken as diced potatoes. Added poultry seasoning and turmeric as others recommended, and a few strips of bacon. Very delicious ad rich.  cooked in crock pot after The recipe makes 6 - 8 hearty servings.  looking forward to leftovers.  Will make this again. I think turkey would make a fine substitute and it is rich enough to possible carry langostino, shrimp and seafood, though timing if adding seafood could get tricky.  Enjoy!  we did.

this recipe is good as written. My only suggestion would be to add the corn and chicken in at the end to warm up since they are already cooked.
To save steps, I just made the roux when the carrots, celery & onion were cooked (instead of setting the veggies aside and then going back to add the stock). The recipe can be changed up however you want... add cheese, diced jalapenos, chopped roasted poblano or red peppers, so on and so on according to your own taste.  I like spicy so after trying the original dish, I warmed some up with a couple of drops of Sriracha - great as well.

This recipe is very good the way it is but the adjustments that I made for my taste buds was I added some red pepper (did the black pepper also), curry, and a little seasoned salt (sorry, I never measure anything).  Also, instead of cooking it the final 20 minutes, I just did it for 5 minutes and then turned the stove off and let it sit for about 30 minutes. The potatoes were cooked to just the right texture - not super soft.

I made it exactly as written and it was excellent. Next time I may substitute low fat milk for some of the half & half and may add a little bacon to garnish but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

This just moved up to my favorite chowder. I treat myself and my family to what I call comfort food once in a while and this is one of those treats I enjoy. Now back to low calorie. :)

This was a little bit too rich for my taste. If I make it again, I will use a lighter cream or substitute the cream with milk. The corn made it very sweet as well. Overall it had good flavor with the combination of ingredients.

Quick and easy.  Will make again.  My only substitution was 2 cups of skim milk and 1/2 cup of heavy cream because that's what I had on hand.  Not 5 stars because it was a little bland, I added a pinch of cayenne.

I so loved this recipe.  I followed it with the exception of omitting celery (my husband hates it) and I did feel it needed a lot more salt than what the recipe called for.  I used seasoning salt.  It was delicious.  My husband said it was "a homerun" and had 2 bowls.  This is going in the make again and again pile of recipes.

We enjoyed this soup! I followed the recipe as is except only used 1 cup of half and half to make it a bit lighter. It still tasted great.
