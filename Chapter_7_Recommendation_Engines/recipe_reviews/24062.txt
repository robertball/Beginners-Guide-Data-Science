The recipe as written is a little unbalanced in the ingredients. I would suggest using 1/2 cup or even more flour. Mix the dry ingredients without the apples together in a bowl; gradually add the milk while mixing to get a smooth texture, and then add in the apples. That way you won't get the "milk curdling" affect (it's not that the milk is curdling; it's that the flour is not mixed smoothly). You can also add cinnamon and chopped pecans (or walnuts) for enhancement. And you can furthermore top with caramel. With these changes to the recipe, it comes out really nicely.

This recipe was extremely simple to prepare and easy to cook.  Not only was it a breeze to make, but the best thing was that it was a delight to eat.  I will certainly make this again!

The taste of this was good. It did not resemble pudding just cooked apples with a separated sauce.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed.  First of all, I had to continue cooking it for an hour.  When I served it, the liquid separated from the pudding and made it look undesirable.  I encouraged my husband to try it anyway -- he liked the flavor, but not the runny consistency.

Later in the afternoon, I added another 1/4 cup of flour to the recipe and cooked it at 350 for about 30 minutes and it was exactly like I think it should have looked in the first place.

My suggestion is to increase the flour from 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup and cook the recipe for about 50 minutes at 350 degrees.  

It had a great flavor, but if you're looking for anything like apple, Moms, you out of luck on this recipe.

Good simple recipe.  It cooks up as apple slices in a creamy sauce that takes on a nice apple flavor.

I had a great experience with this recipe! Followed ingredients exactly using white whole wheat flour and Rhode Island Greening apples (a good baking apple that is tart and keeps its shape w/o cooking down too much) and whole milk. It looked a little liquidy after the 45 minutes so we put it back in for 15 more and it set perfectly. I wasn't sure what kind of flavor it would have w/o any spices and was amazed at how much creamy, appley flavor it has. Definitely a keeper here!!

Did not resemble pudding at all. I was annoyed at the apples I wasted.

Tried this as I thought I'd like it with a runny sauce.  However, the milk curdled in the oven.  Although it still tasted good, the sauce consistency was poor as a result.  I wouldn't try this again.

I followed the directions but added a little bit of cinnamon to it and after baking it for 45 minutes at 325 was a little too runny so I increased the oven to 400 and baked it for an additioinal 10 minutes and it turned out just right!

Double flour, half sugar (use brown), cook 15 minutes longer. Lovely with ice cream, hot / warm/ cool, regardless.

I made this today.  It was good - not too sweet.  I had to add a bit more milk so it would "almost cover" the apples, and let it cook an extra 10 minutes.  Next time I might add some cinnamon.  It does need something.  The lemon sauce sounds good, but more extra work than I would want.  In the picture, it looks like it was baked covered.  It doesn't say that in the instructions.  I may try it.

Very toasty. Went well with vanilla ice cream. Next time I will try cornstarch instead of flour to thicken it up. I also added cinnamon and it was wonderful.

I used this recipe as a base for a low-carb version! I used half the apples, tossed them with 1/2c Splenda and cinnamon to taste, then microwaved a few minutes to soften the apples. I mixed 1c Cream with 1/8-1/4c of vanilla whey protein powder, mixed into the apple mixture, and baked until the top was slightly brown. This is more of a custard than a pudding, but it's delicious and satisfies my craving for sweets!

I made this recipe based on the recent review suggesting the use of more flour. I think that was likely a good suggestion and this came out pretty good. I've never had apple pudding but I think I'll be making more of this, maybe with some tweaks to the seasoning.
