This is the best Chocolate Crinkles recipe!!  Our family has been baking these for decades.  Baking chocolate (not cocoa as some recipes use) makes these cookies rich and fudgy.  You can't mess these up; even little children enjoy making them.  The recipe should say "4 ounces of unsweetened chocolate, MELTED AND COOLED".  Also, chilling the dough is an important step - otherwise, the dough will be too soft to work with.  I chill it overnight, then put the bowl out on the counter for 1/2 hour before beginning to bake.  (If the cookies don't spread as much as you'd like during baking, you can start pressing down gently on the tops of the cookies before putting them into the oven.)  We love these cookies - they're brownies in cookie form!

Actually, the way this recipe is written, it doesn't make sense.  It says mix oil, chocolate and sugar.  What do you do with the chocolate?  Grate it? Melt it?  Hmmm... I had to do my own thing, but would like to know how the recipe is actually made.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I did as one reviewer suggested and stuck the dough in the freezer for about 45 minutes. Then I used a lightly oiled tablespoon scoop to drop the dough into the confectioner's sugar. I rolled it around for a bit and then formed it into a ball before plopping it on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper. I squished the dough balls down a bit before baking for about 15 minutes. The cookies spread a lot more than I thought they would, so I'm glad that they were placed about 2 inches apart. [I actually like the flatter version more than the little mounds you see in the photos] Despite the extended baking time and flat-ish shape, they still came out chewy and soft and fudgy [maybe a tiny bit crisp or hard on the sides]. They really are brownies in cookie form :D [Note: 1/4 a recipe yielded 10 cookies. I used a rounded, generous tablespoon for each cookie.]

This is the best Crinkle recipe I have ever tried!  I made them today for the first time and they turned out so soft and chewy.  I have tried others in the past, but none were ever this good.  I didn't bake them on a normal cookie sheet, but instead used the Demarle Silpat and perforated cookie sheet.  I will be definitely making these again.

This is the crinkle recipe to use!!!!My Mom has been making them over over 40 years and I have also been making them for at least 15 years.  It's a foolproof recipe which makes lots of cookies.  One sure tip would be:  being that the dough is sticky, flour your hands often and then roll the chocolate balls, it goes a lot faster that way.  Enjoy!!! Everyone will love these delicious cookies.

Found this cookie to be a mild flavored cookie, would have liked a stronger chocolate flavor. Nice chewy cookie and beautiful crinkle finish. Difficult to get off cookie sheet, maybe greasing sheet would have helped. I had no consistency problems, seems the refrigerating took care of that.

I have used this recipe for 30 years.  It's easily divisible by 4 so if low on an ingredient, you can still get a chocolate fix by dividing the recipe in half or fourths.  This recipe makes great brownies.  Use 1/4 recipe if you don't trust yourself with a whole recipe and stick in a loaf pan.  1/2 recipe (less 1 Tablespoon of uncooked dough eaten!) fits in an 8x8 or 9x9 pan.

I have been using this particular recipe since I was 10 years old. When I moved out of the house I took the recipe with me.  I was in the Air Force and brought my chocolate crinkles to work and everybody, I mean everybody could not resist them. People were asking me for the recipe left and right. One lady was starting her own business and decided to make and sell these cookies and give it a name that pertained to me.. How cool is that?

FANTASTIC!!   Super easy to make and just delicious.  I agree with the other reviewer who said they have a slight crispy crunch on the outside but are soft like a brownie on the inside.  The are nice and chocolately/fudgy tasting and the sweet confectioners sugar on the outside is such a nice balance.  These are definitely going on my cookie trays!!

These cookies are great!  They do tend to stick to the pans, but if you let them cool for awhile on the pans, they come off a little better. Added in a half bag of chocolate chips I wanted to use up, and they tasted great in the cookie!  Also dusted with a little more powdered sugar once the cookies were cooled. Very yummy.

These were my favorite cookies as a kid...and still are! I prefer them only 3/4 baked, and then freeze them. I can pull them out of the freezer and any time and still have gooey cookies.

This is my mom's recipe too! I love it - when I moved out it was one of the "Must Have" recipies I had to get a copy of.  

TIP!!!  Dough is sticky. Put powdered sugar in a bowl. Use wax paper to pick up teaspoon-size bits of the tough and drop into the powdered sugar. After putting a few in the bowl, use a sppon (or your hands) to cover any dough that is showing in the powdered sugar. You can then pick each one up and form it into a ball - without your hands getting all sticky!  Works really good!

Very yummylicious as my daughter stated!  I followed recipe as is except I halved it and used 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of the 1/4 cup of oil and I added 1 T. of Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa to mixture.  They were very soft and had a wonderful chocolate taste.  Perfect!

Somewhere between melting the chocolate and baking the dough, something went horribly wrong.  Mine turned out so cake-y.  Modifications were: (1) used semisweet chocolate squares as I didn't have unsweetened ones on hand and (2) decreased the amount of sugar due to the already-sweet squares.  This is the first time I made chocolate crinkles using melted chocolate.  I'm sticking to cocoa powder.  Thanks for sharing, though.

Found and used this recipe tonight. Amazing!!!! I've tried other recipes for crinkles before, they never came out right.  These are perfect! Baked up soft and round and fabulous.  Couple of side notes: no need to cool the chocolate if you don't overheat it, the oil, sugar, and eggs will cool it plenty. Also, instead of chilling overnight, I popped my dough in the freezer for 45 min, worked perfectly.  :) Thank you so much for this recipe, it's never leaving my recipe box!

As written, 2 stars for tasting more like the flour/egg than the chocolate. With my modifications -- FOUR STARS. Before rolling into balls, I made a little indent with my thumb and filled with either (1) a chopped up piece from a Kraft caramel candy square and 1 or 2 chocolate chips; (2) a little peanut butter and a couple of chocolate chips; or (3) a few white/semi-sweet chocolate chips. This made for 3 varieties of cookies with delicious surprises in the center that spread out into the rest of the cookie when bakes. As written, I wouldn't make again, but with my modifications, I'll return to this recipe over and over again!

Good cookie, simple. I like to add a bit more chocolate (1square) for a richer cookie.  For the reviewer that gave no stars because they didn't know what to do with the chocolate....the ingredients says "melted".

I wanted a chocolate cookie to top with ice cream and always had this recipe sitting in my recipe box. I have to say, this is like a brownie in cookie form and it is so good with a small scoop of ice cream on top of it! I had one by itself and it was so fudgy and delicious! I melted the chocolate on defrost mode in the microwave (keep an eye on it!) and whisked it smooth and immediately started to make the recipe. I stuck the batter in the freezer for about an hour and made them into small balls. I did not flatten them, they flattened out themselves while baking. They smelt so good when they came out the oven and tasted even better!

Yummy yummy, just like the chocolate crinkles my mom and I used to make every Christmas. They were mine and my dad's favorite cookies! I think using the unsweetened squares of chocolate, rather than cocoa powder, makes these cookies as chocolatey as they should be. If you are a chocolate lover, you will LOVE these cookies. I followed the recipe exactly, and the cookies came out perfect. Just make sure not to overbake, or else you will end up with hard cookies. These need to be soft and chewy.

Fantastic.  Much better than other recipes I've tried that call for cake mix or powdered cocoa rather melted chocolate.  I used a rounded teaspoon to make these cookies and I was able to make  fifty cookies from this recipe and I still have two cups of dough sitting in my fridge.

For cleanliness sake I would definitely recommend keeping your hands and spoon covered in powdered sugar as well as rolling the dough in the sugar inside of a large plastic bag.

I'm still not sure that these are as good as the chocolate crackles that my mother used to make from a lost recipe (she thinks it did involve powdered cocoa but butter instead of oil) but this is the best recipe I have been able to lay my hands on and everyone I gave these to thought they were the best chocolate crackles they'd ever had.

These are good, but I was surprised it didn't seem to have a lot of flavor beyond the chocolate and sugar. The sugar seemed a bit strong to me. If I were to make again, I'd probably add a little more vanilla and less sugar. But that's my preference. My husband loved them though!

Made as written.  They tasted good, but I was used to the little "nugget" cookies and these flattened out incredibly.  The bulk of the powdered sugar also "melted" during the cooking process.  Again, they tasted good, but they were not what I was looking for.  I will go back to the cake mix version.

LOVE this recipe!  This is the exact recipe, (practically word for word) out of Betty Crocker's 1963 "Cooky Book."  We made these every Christmas growing up and I can't wait to start making them for my kids this year!

These cookies are yummy!  I was looking for a recipe like this because there is a restaurant here that makes chocolate "volcano cookies."  I never knew they were called crinkle cookies.  I did not have baking chocolate, so I used 3/4 c. cocoa and 1/4 butter but otherwise copied the recipe exactly.  Definitely a hit with my kids! (and my hubby and me too)

I was not very impressed with the texture, flavor or user-friendliness of this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I replaced one of the tsp of vanilla with strong coffee from this morning.  This one change should not change anything, as I"m replacing liquid for liquid.  I even weighed out the chocolate to exactly four ounces.      the end results spread out way too thin, barely tasted like chocolate and stuck to the pan no matter how much I sprayed it (I always use a very light uniform spray).  Might try again.

Mmm.. Delicious, BEAUTIFUL cookies! The only thing I would change is instead of covering the dough in sugar and then rolling into a ball, roll it into a ball first, and then just dip the top half into the powdered sugar. Covering it with sugar on the bottom too made it more difficult to get off of the pan. My cookies came out a little sweeter than was intended, because I didn't have any unsweetened baking squares, only semi-sweet, But I think I will be using Semi-sweet always. They taste sooo good.

Upon baking these a second time, I want to add, be sure to use the baker's chocolate squares, and do not try to substitute with cocoa powder. The cocoa powder gives a conversion chart to make a baker's square.. but it is -not- the same. The cookies this time spread out MUCH more in the oven and were a lot flatter. Not as good imo, though, maybe if your going for a flatter cookie this would work? :-p

And one more tip, they are even easier to work with if you place them in the freezer instead of the fridge.

This recipe turned out so well for me.  I made a similar recipe before, and the cookies turned out really flat and sort of crunchy.  But things were in the right proportions in this one so that they turned out soft and a little chewy.

These cookies tasted great, but I found the dough to be way too sticky to work with. This may have been because I was out of all-purpose flour, so I substituted a half-and-half mixture of cake and bread flours. However, I always do this when I am out of all-purpose and it has always worked before! Anyway, I ended up adding a little more flour, some sugar, and some cocoa powder, and I used tons of powdered sugar to roll them in. This worked pretty well, and the cookies went over very well. They were good, but I don't think I will use this recipe again.

Jekhill,   It clearly states in the ingredients that the chocolate is supposed to be MELTED.  I grew up making these cookies every year for Christmas.  My mom, sister and I still make them :)

EXCELLENT.  My family says these are the best things I've ever baked, and I bake a lot.  Seeing the complaints about stickiness, I greased the pans with extra butter and I still had some slight problems getting them off the pan.  I also prefer larger, flatter cookies over the nearly spherical ones you see in pictures, so I flattened them out a lot before baking, which didn't affect the baking time at all.  I uploaded a pic of my flattened cookies if anyone wants to see the difference.

Try rolling the balls in regular white granulated sugar before baking (instead of confectioner's) It makes the cookies more carmelized on the outside. It is SO good. Of all the crinkle recipes posted I think this is the best because the vegetable oil makes them better for you but they're still SO light and fluffy.

I doubled the recipe and didn't refrigerate before baking.  Turned out really well, although a little oily.  Crisp outside, tender, almost fudgey inside.  Really very good.  Will make these every year at Christmas, now.  Thank you!

Love it when a thing goes right!  To be honest, I had my doubts when the dough looked more like batter.  But after refrigerating it over night, allowing to soften a bit before scooping, all was made right!  Like little snow kissed brownies!  I'll definitely be making these again!

These cookies were really great! Very chocolatey and a nice consistency. I love that you can make half or a quarter of the batch (thanks to another commenter for pointing that out!). I used coconut oil and it worked perfectly. I used a big cookie scoop and baked for 10 minutes. I will definitely make these again.

-30 windchill the day I made these. Did not want to go to the store, so I made them with semi-sweet chocolate and coconut oil. Added 3 tablespoons of dark chocolate cocoa powder. Delicious!

Best recipe!

I've been making these for over a decade.  I prefer this recipe using the baking chocolate squares because, I think it gives a better texture.  However, I also add 1 tbsp of the dark cocoa powder to give a deeper chocolate flavor.
Either way, it's the best recipe for crinkles.
Thanks for sharing!

Recipe was easy to follow. Although an added tip might be to explain how to melt the chocolate, which is basically in a pan on low heat stirring constantly. Also, I only baked the cookies for about 10 minutes because I prefer a gooey center. However, this was a fantastic recipe and everyone loved them! I will make them again soon! They flew off the cooking racks haha

Perfect in flavor and shape. Keep the dough cold to keep it from getting sticky. Don't actually handle the dough until after you've dropped the spoonfulls into the sugar to coat and then they will roll around in yours hands easily. I put red and green M'n'Ms on top to decorate for Christmas. Big hit.

Followed the recipe exactly-cookies baked up beautifully, great crinkle finish and texture, chewy and soft on the inside. Refrigerated overnight before baking for about 8 minutes. Milder chocolate flavor than I wanted, though. Could have been stronger. Other than that, great recipe.

I was looking for a recipe that was like my Mom's as this is one of our traditional cookies made around the holidays and this one nailed it. If this recipe did not work for you...remember to chill it for several hours and stick back in the fridge in between trays, this keeps them from spreading too much and the powdered sugar melting into them. Thank you Mellan for posting this recipe!

They turned out well visually but the cookie was a little too dry for my liking. I had these from another baker & they were like chewy little brownies. I'm going to investigate to see if it might have been my technique adding the eggs. A time consuming but fun cookie project. The better the chocolate you use, the better they will taste.

I wouldn't roll it in icing sugar the next time. Half of it disappears during the baking process.  Instead, I would sprinkle it on after they've cooled.  My tip for that is to use a loose tea spoon and fill with the icing sugar.  It works great!  Mine came out nice and chewy in the middle. It's not overly sweet, still very yummy!

Just like mom used to make!  I used a tablespoon to  measure the dough and baked for exavtly twelve minutes.  They were still a bit fudgy in the middle but I think that's how they're best!

This is a family favorite and has been since before I was born.  I have no idea if this is the same recipe my grandma uses (probably not), but it tastes the same!  And that's good enough for me!

Followed the recipe to a "T". I chilled the dough for 5 hours. We Loved the cookies. I got seven dozen cookies using the small cookie scoop from Pampered Chef. This recipe is a keeper.

These cookies are awesome! This was the first time that I have ever made chocolate crinkles and they turned out wonderful! I didn't have any problems with sticking but that is probably because I greased my pans very generously. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Delicious, with a lovely texture! We loved these. I flattened mine slightly because I prefer flat cookies. These cookies do spread quite a bit so don't go less than 2" between them on the sheet. I used the stated amount of granulated sugar, but skimped on the confectioner's sugar because I have this phobia of too-sweet foods. It came out perfect for our tastes. BTW the Star Trek blob was  Horta, not Ahorta. :)

Yummy! These are definitely "milk & cookie" cookies! I was impatient and only left these in the fridge for about 30 minutes. The key is to not over work the dough when you are rolling... that's when things start getting really messy! I like to add white chocolate chunks or chocolate chips to the batter to give it a little something extra.

These were awesome!  I was looking for something right away, so I froze the batter while I preheated the oven, and made one batch (effectively half) on a cookie sheet.  Those were okay, but not very chocolately.     The 2nd batch froze for an extra 15 mins while the 1st batch cooked. I put the second batch in a muffin tins, just rolling the balls pretty big and putting one in each muffin cup.  I was vigilant not to overcook them (I cooked the cookie sheet batch for 10 minutes, but it was too long), I cooked them for about 13-15 minutes in my oven, although it's hard to tell b/c I kept checking on them.  I learned that they puff up a little when they are done.   They were awesome!  Fudgy and perfect.  Next time I might add chocolate chips or maybe a mini peanut butter cup in the middle of the muffin cup before i bake.

We were hoping for a stronger chocolate flavour.  These were too mild, hence the lower rating.  Ours didn't flatten out, as we were expecting.  We're glad we didn't have any sticky problems.  They were very pretty though so I will try making them again...perhaps a different recipe next time.

Great play date for my 4 yr old and his friend! I made the dough up last night and it was really easy for them to roll into balls today. I didn't and wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for the great afternoon!

Very good cookie -- I used one bar of Ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate, and I added 1 tsp of instant coffee granules to the melted chocolate. They needed to bake a bit longer than the recipe stated, and they still remained chewy. I suspect these would be fantastic with peppermint extract.

Best cookie I've had in a long time. My best friend's mother used to make these when we were in junior high and I've looked for years for a receipe for these.  They are as good as I remember them.
