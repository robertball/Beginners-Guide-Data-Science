This is my third year serving this with my turkey and everybody raves about it.  I can eat it all by it self, but it is good over ice cream, or pound cake.  It makes for a low calorie fat free dessert.

I made this recipe to go with a pork dinner, and my family loved it.  There was no way to tell it was not made with sugar - this will be a regular dish on our table.

I made this last Thanksgiving and Christmas and it was a hit. No leftovers! I'm hosting the family reunion this Thanksgiving and this has been requested even by the non-diabetics in the family! No one can tell that it is not a full sugar recipe.
