I didn't have the jasmine green tea so decided to make this using Trader Joe's candy cane green tea. I'm also off sugar, so I used stevia as my sweetener. At first taste, I thought this wasn't my "cup of tea." But after eating the entire thing, it grew on me. I can see it being a refreshing, albeit different, dessert after a meal or snack.
