I’ve made this recipe for over 20 years and it is very versatile. I always use a large can of pureed tomatoes in sauce otherwise there is not enough sauce. Substitute chopped green peppers and mushrooms for the ground beef if serving to non-meat eaters. It tastes just as good. Add a sprinkle of cayenne for a little pizzazz. Great dish for pot lucks. Buon appetito!

I mixed the meat sauce with the noodles and topped with the cheese and baked at 350 for approx 20 minutes (instead of broiling).  Very tasty!

Great recipe!  I double the tomato sauce or else there isn't enough.  Aside from that it has turned out to be a new favorite dish.  Its quick and easy and tastes great!

Instead of adding the cheese and then placing it under the broiler I did as some of the other reviews suggested and just sprinkled the cheese on top and let the heat from the food melt the cheese.  This was truley wonderful.  My whole family loved this and can't wait for me to make it again.

So yummy!  Had to make a couple changes due to what I had in the pantry.  No tomato sauce so I used 15 oz of petite diced tomatoes with a clove of fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I tossed the butter in the colander with the pasta and put the pasta right into the skillet with the meat sauce then topped with the mozzarella.  Came out great!!  I used the called for amount of salt and thought it needed more after cooking- you have to use tomatoe sauce; not a spaghetti sauce.  If you use a spaghetti sauce forget the  salt. Good yummy recipe.

Although I did make a couple of modifications, I loved this recipe as the ingredients mesh together well. I doubled the tomato sauce and cheese and added a little sweet bell pepper, garlic and onion to the sautéed ground beef before adding the tomato sauce. I also just eyeballed the parmesan cheese as I grated it, so I think it was more than 1/4 up.  I also baked it for 15 to 20 mins at 350 like others suggested. Will definitely make again!

This was pretty dry and salty, and too meaty.  If I did bother to make it again, I'd cut the meat to one fourth, and triple the tomato sauce.  But I won't bother making it again.

This was an easy recipe to make and my husband really enjoyed it!  As recommended by other reviewers, I mixed everything together and baked it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.
I made this recipe a second time and added two Italian sausages and some onion and minced garlic to the meat mixture (also put in some extra pasta sauce).  It was even better!  Yum!

I thought the sauce needed something, it tasted a little flat.  It was okay but my family didn't care for it so I won't be making it again.

I liked the black olives with the pasta and meat sauce. I used leftover "Pasta Lasagna" from this site, so mine was really good. I would like the dish the way the recipe says to make it though. Thanks for the great way to use leftovers that I was sick of.

Very good.  I halved the pasta but kept the amount of sauce the same.  I had to be a bit creative bc I didn't have quite enough sauce, and I didn't have ground beef.  So I added a can of drained diced tomatoes to make sure there was enough tomato and I added a can of sliced mushrooms and red peppers to make the sauce hearty.  I used an entire can of whole olives and instead of slicing them, I just cut them in half.  Bf isn't a fan of olives so that made it easier for him to pick them out.  Lest you think I wasn't being fair to him, he likes mushrooms and I don't so I picked those out.  LOL.  I'm glad I used what amounted to double the sauce; if I hadn't, it definitely would not have been enough.  I think that it would be even better with the pasta and sauce mixed together and the parmesan cheese mixed with the butter and pasta instead of cooked into the sauce, but otherwise I find this dish tasty, hearty, and so easy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good but not 'WOW' good in my opinion.  I would definitely make again because of the ease and relatively inexpensive ingredients.  Added 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning and 50% more tomato sauce.

My family liked this real well.  My family isn't into black olives very much, so instead of 1 cup sliced black olives I used one 2.25 oz can of sliced black olives and one 4.5 oz can of chopped green chiles.

This was a great, quick and easy change from my usual ground beef recipes.  I loved the olives and I don't usually like black olives!  Also I added some chopped mushrooms and baked everything at 350 for 20 minutes.  My husband said that it was a keeper!

We all really enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe & didn't mix the sauce and pasta together.  I really liked the taste of the pasta as it tasted butttery, yet it was topped with meaty sauce.  Yummy!  Next time though I would increase the sauce by 50%.

I modified this recipe due to lack of time and no ground beef!  I made the sauce in a large skillet with the olives, cheese and all the seasonings, and simply added the cooked pasta (without the butter)when it was done.  The shredded cheese melted over the top of the hot mixture, and it was a huge hit with my kids.  They loved the olives in this tasty, cheesy meal!  Will definitely make again!

excellent recipe. I did omit the olives and next time will double the meat sauce as we prefer more sauce. And I will just use one tsp of seasoning salt, it was a bit salty.

WOW!! That tasted so great!!! I had been craving mushrooms, so I used them instead of olives, but I absolutely loved this recipe!!! The only problem was that I didn't have any leftovers to enjoy the next day!

This was great and simple, a nice alternative to regular spaghetti.  I doubled the sauce and used spiral pasta (already had it in the pantry).  It was even great as leftovers the next day.  :o)

Loved it. I Did double the sauce as other reviewers mentioned there wasn't enough sauce. All my kids loved it...it is now in the monthly menu rotation. I did substitute the ground beef with Italian sausage just because my kids needed a change :-) thank you for a great recipe

I give it four stars. If you made it with more sauce it would be 5 stars! I doubled everything for our large family. But with doubling the meat I would say then to triple the sauce.
