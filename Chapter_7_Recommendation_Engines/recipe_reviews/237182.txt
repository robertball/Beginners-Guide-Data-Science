Kind of bland. I added a bunch of freshly grated Parmesan, freshly grated pepper & olive oil.

Prosciutto crudo and asparagus go very well together in this light pasta. I sautéed the onions, prosciutto and the asparagus together until the ham was lightly warmed, not crisp as to not ruin the prosciutto. I then simply tossed it all together with the pasta at the last minute. The flavours and textures are wonderful together. The saltiness of the ham is intense so I suggest lightly salting the pasta water. Thank you Khatche for your recipe.

The pasta has a very light flavour. It’s a wonderful pasta to make for potlucks, BBQs, or just on a Tuesday. My WHOLE family enjoyed this, which is definitely never easy to do. We added some fresh Parmesan and some Italian Blend seasonings to give it a little more life and was perfect :)

Easy to make and quick. Loved the flavours coming the prosciutto and asparagus. Nice not to have sauce as it would have taken away from those flavours. Will certainly add to my list of favs

These are great steps in the right direction. I made the recipe, but before I severed it, it  wasn't very tasty. I made a few modifications, and cheesy  bread for supper

This was really bland. I added some parmesan cheese and that only helped a little. I wish I'd used bacon or something other than prosciutto, since prosciutto is a rare treat for us and we would have rather had it on its own than waste it on this. Not making this one again, sorry.

I found the dish to be extremely delicious. the lack of sauce allowed to taste the whole dish which I enjoyed. I sautéed the asparagus before boiling and that added a little crispness that I enjoyed. I also used wheat noodles which I thing helped for taste

Any chance to put asparagus and prosciutto together is a win in my book. I used leftover grilled asparagus, which I think added a bit more of that roasted flavor.
