I was skeptical about a microwave recipe but I was in a hurry.  I substituted a rolled turkey breast for the pork loin and it turned out really juicy and tasty!

This is the first roast I've ever cooked in the micro - turned out perfect!  I was surprised at how moist the pork was - even ate the onions.  Will make again. 
Thx, CJ

Surprisingly good!  I did not use fresh rosemary, I just sprinkled some crushed rosemary on pork along with other seasonings. SUPER easy and quick.  I will surely make this again for a fast easy meal.

Tried this last night as I was in a hurry to get dinner on the table.  Had all ingredients on hand including fresh rosemary from my herb garden.  Delish and easy!

Caught by unexpected dinner guest. And not wanting them to have to wait,  I gave this a try.  Been cooking for years and otherwise would have never cooked pork chops in MW!  Turned out great.  Do have to check for doneness not dryness.  Mid way, I browned in pan with a little oil for just seconds and put back in MW to finish.  Turned out great.  Made gravy in pan I browned in.

I liked the idea of a quality meal made quickly.  I like using my microwave over gas or electric ovens. However...

I followed this recipe EXACTLY as stated and after 16 + 6 minutes, it was not cooked through. I gave it another 6, then 6 more, then another 6 and then it was cooked through.  And, yes, microwave was on high, etc., etc. Meat didn't weather the microwaving very well, it was kind of tough.

Best part of this recipe? The onions! Even my 4 boys sucked them down (ages 15, 14, 12 & 7). Only one would eat the meat but commented on the "chewiness".  Oh, well. It was worth a try.

Not just for college students. I tried it with a 3lb loin and it was fantastic.

My husband and I have enjoyed this several times. IT IS DELICIOUS. I broke our stove/ burners right before Thanksgiving and for weeks we have been using the microwave to cook our meals. I am grateful for a real meal here. Thank you! Bravo! God Bless You for sharing this recipe. You helped this new wife out.
