I have never made fudge before but my husband requested this, I didn't think I would eat any but it is sublime!  I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts which were wonderful, next time I'll use about 50% more than the recipe calls for because I like the crunch they add.  Next time I'll add a pinch of salt or perhaps salt the pecans while toasting them.  The texture of this was really perfect, smooth and creamy instead of dry and grainy like a lot of fudge is.  I also agree the presentation was lovely.  Thanks for the recipe, I will use it as is and try many modifications in the future!

I made this fudge as a white chocolate/vanilla fudge instead of maple (I've already made maple fudge this year).  So I just used vanilla in place of maple extract.  It is so good, and easy to make.  It tastes wonderful and cuts very well too.  It looks beautiful and will make nice gifts.  I'm happy to have found a "white chocolate" recipe for fudge!

I thought this was very good fudge.  It set up well for me.  It had a good texture and cut nicely.  Now one of my favorites.

Quite good!  I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the white chocolate taste was a little overwhelming.  I upped the maple extract to 3 tsp, only added 2 cups of white chocolate chips and I can still taste the chocolate clearly.

After reading the other reviews that said their fudge came out too soft I used a candy thermometer to make sure the sugar/milk/butter mixture got all the way to 234 degrees.  It boiled for much much longer (I live at a high altitude, that might have been part of it as well).  Either way, the marshmallows and chocolate melted just fine and it cooled to the perfect fudge consistency.  I also toasted the walnuts before I added them and that was very good.

This recipe is great. You need to make sure you bring it to a fast boil and boil it for 5 minutes. I doubled the recipe and added a smidge more maple extract. Turned out wonderful. Also made the recipe substituting (in a double batch) 2 cups semi sweet chips, and 4 cups milk chocolate chips for the white chips. Made great chocolate fugde. Easier than Aunt Teen's Fudge. I like using the mini marshmellows instead of creme. The mixture boils quicker. Just have to do a lot of stirring after to melt everything. Will make this recipe often. I give a gifts at Christmas time. Everyones loves it!

This tasted like plain vanilla fudge-not what I expected at all. It's only redeeming qualities are its ease to make, and its smooth texture. If you're looking for something that tastes really 'mapley', keep looking.

This fudge was okay, but the texture wasn't very good. It came out very soft. Also, the flavor was not very strong. The fugde tasted more like the white chocolate chips than maple. Okay recipe, but not the maple fudge recipe that I was looking for.

I made it exactly according to the recipe.  And it never quite set up enough to cut.  I had to put it in the freezer.  Tastes great though, I'll probably modify a no fail fudge recipe to make maple fudge.

Made this without walnuts and it came out superbly smooth and rich. Very easy to make. Will try the next batch with the walnuts.

This recipe is the same as on the Nestle's white chocolate morsels bag. 
I used a candy thermometer and the
fudge set up perfectly. Like other folks..I have to agree the taste of the
white chocolate over powers the maple.
If you are looking for a real maple
flavored fudge..this is not the recipe you are looking for.

I followed the recipe precisely and it never set so I heated it and added confectioner's sugar to thicken it, poured it back in the 9 x 13 pan and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. It set some but still too soft on the bottom.   Flavor was good but consistencey poor.

This fudge is very easy to make and tastes great. I have never really made fudge before, but I was able to make this recipe very easily.   I halved the recipe and made it in an 11x7 pan instead of a 9x13. I don't know if it's because of this or not, but this fudge most certainly did not require 8 hours to set up. It was already almost set as I was spreading it in the pan. I did chill it a couple hours, but it wasn't necessary. Maybe it works different when you do the full recipe.  Regardless, this is a great fudge that I will most certainly make again.

What did I do wrong?  I left it to chill overnight in the fridge, and still, it's too soft to even cut.    Taste was good, but I had to scrap the whole thing since it was too gooey to serve.

My pot was to small so I had to pour everything into a bowl then the marshmallows and chips wouldn't melt so I had to microwave everything for 90 seconds. I added an extra tsp of maple, the fudge set soft but that might be my fault I will let it boil longer next time, there will be a next time since this was the best maple walnut fudge I've had

I used pecans instead of walnuts.
I also used a candy thermometer and let it reach 240F & let it boil at that temp for about 3-4 min before turning off the heat & adding the rest of the ingredients.  Fudge came out perfect!

This is an easy fudge recipe that takes no time at all and turns out wonderfully. After having read the reviews, I decided to use semi-sweet chips rather than white, used a tsp more maple extract, and about a 1/3 cup more walnuts. Absolutely devine.

The recipe was easy enough, but the white chocolate chips didn't melt completly, and it took a long time for the marshmallows to melt also. Wasn't sure if this was how it is supposed to be. The flavor was good. I will continue to look for a better recipe along this line though.

Very good but VERY sweet as well. After reading other reviews, I increased the maple flavor extract to help mask the white choc. chips. Also, I had no problem with it setting.

The flavor of this recipe is excellent! I used pecans instead of walnuts.  It is very important to use a candy thermometer and boil until it reaches 234 degrees.  Otherwise just boiling for 5 minutes is not long enough to allow the recipe to set.  I also prefer to use marshmallow creme rather than mini marshmallows because it has a nice taste and texture, and also melts more easily.

It was a hit at our Christmas get together!  My family like nuts so I doubled the nuts in the recipe instead of topping it with walnut halves.  I also made the pieces small as it is very rich and sweet.

I have never made fudge before and followed the directions given. I buttered my pan but was unable to remove the fudge. I tried setting it in a pan of warm water, using a hair dryer on the inverted pan...even using my iron to heat the bottom of the pan, but I could not pry the fudge out. In reviewing other recipes I now see that the answer is simple: You must line your buttered dish with foil and then butter the foil so you can remove the fudge in one block. 
I wish folks who post recipes would include such pertinent info for folks like me -  someone making this kind of confection for the first time!
I had to get creative because my attempt was  was on the eve of a bake sale and I had no extra ingredients with which to make another batch. I ended up using a melon baller to scoop the fudge out and rolled the little balls in ground nuts. These tasted and looked OK but I wanted to present the tray of fudge I pledged.
