My maiden voyage into the Instant Pot world and, as a recent widower, cooking was never high on my todo list. The one-pot nature of this helped and simply following the directions produced a really decent meal option for me. I've been into the power bowl type of meals, so it felt like an accomplishment to be able to produce something like this on my own.

I was easy and turned out well.  I added ground chicken while sauteing the onions.

I added some ground turkey and ate it with chips and cheese. It was delicious and filling!
