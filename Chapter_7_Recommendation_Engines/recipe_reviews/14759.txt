To freeze them....this is what i do.
take a cookie sheet or whatever that covers a large surface and is flat (but make sure it fits in your refrigerator)and put the fresh dunpings on the sheet, making sure that the dumpings do not touch. then freeze them until they are rock hard. now just remove them and throw them into a bag to put in a freezer, etc. to cook: boil water and put these frozen dumpings in. boil until soften (and make sure the filling is cooked of course)

These are amazingly good! I used ground turkey because my sister was visiting and she doesn't eat pork. While still very good, ground turkey will leave a little bit of "turkey" aftertaste, so I can't wait to try them with pork! I used a bag of angel hair coleslaw mix for a cabbage short-cut and that worked very well. We boiled our dumplings in salted water for five minutes and they were fabulous--didn't need to be fried at all! (A Chinese friend of ours from Beijing introduced us to this low-fat alternative!) For a dipping sauce we used 2 T. soy sauce, 1/2 t. vinegar (rice vinegar is best but all I had was white vinegar) and a drop of sesame oil. After boiling all the dumplings we added sliced green onions to the water and served it as a light broth soup alongside the dumplings (also traditionally Chinese). Four of us easily ate all of the dumplings as the main dish. An amazing dinner!

I really enjoyed these... although I'm used to the thicker wrappers, the ones I purchased were really thin, however they still tasted great!  I meant to half the recipe but messed up on one of the ingredients and had to make them all... I don't know about this making 100 dumplings...but it sure made a lot (so much that i've individually frozen 6 dumplings worth of meat and wrappers in baggies, to be defrosted for appetizers for me and my honey)... And my boyfriend absolutely loved it..

I followed the recipe with the exception of I used turkey instead of pork, and I pan fried for a couple of minutes then poured water in the pan to steam...

THIS IS A KEEPER!

Excellent!!! Have made these on two different times for parties and have been complimented over and over!  The recipe makes a lot so I usually freeze about 1/2 on a cookie sheet then throw in a freezer bag - great to make later for dinner with a nice salad.  I've both steamed in lettuce leaves and sauteed - the best method for me has been to brown in a wok type pan with cooking spray for about 3 minutes, flip them, then add about 1/3 cup of water to bottom of the pan and cover for about 15 minutes on low heat or until the water is evaporated - REALLY GOOD!  Serve with mixture of 2tbsp rice wine vinegar, 1 tbsp dark sesame oil, 2 tbsp soy sauce, and two thinly chopped scallions from previous review - Thanks for this great recipe!

*Option for pan-fry to crisp skin starting from uncooked if you would prefer* -   Get a large deep-sided nonstick pan nice and hot with a couple TBs of oil, about mid-high heat.  Place dumplings flat-side down in pan, it's OK to crowd a little and be touching, but not overlap.  Pan-fry until that bottom is nice & crisp and then get a lid ready - add about a 1/2 cup of water to the pan and quickly cover with lid to contain the sizzling/popping from the oil.  (Yes you're adding water to hot oil) Reduce heat to mid-low and boil until all the water is gone, about 10-15 mins.  Some oil will be left on bottom once water is gone, remove lid for a couple mins and continue to cook... the skins will shrink against the filling and they'll have a crisp chewy bottom.            Lorna's original recipe here is top-notch and totally worthy of 5 star as it's written though!

Excellent!!!  We made these with our exchange daughter from Hong Kong and she thought they were great :)  We agree!  And we've lived in Hong Kong and have travelled all throughout China... this is a close bet to what you'd really eat there :)

If you mix equal amount of shrimp, add finely chopped shitake mushrooms and waterchestnuts and mix with sesame oil and some oyster sauce, it boosts the flavour a whole lot.

When I made these I made the dumplings from scratch, it took forever but it was well worth it...one thing though, be sure that the dumplings have cooked all the way through...mine were not tiny like they should have been and when I cooked the dumplings I had a scare when one I bit into wasn't quite done. The recipe is quite wonderful, really garlicy and delicious. Thanks :)

Excellent recipe.  I used the bagged slaw mix instead of chopping cabbage.  They're even good as leftovers.  I'm going to try ground chicken next time for a little variety.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome.  I didn't have the ginger and I substituted leeks for the cabbage.  It still rocked.  I precooked the leeks, garlic and pork together before putting into wrappers cuase I was worried about the leeks shrinking and changing the dumplings.  I also fried then added water to cook.  It all came together nicely.

Excellent! I wanted to halve the recipe, but since I had 1 full pound of ground pork, I went a little generous with the amount of seasonings called for (using almost the full 6 serving seasoning amounts called for). I also added about 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper to the mix. Some reviews mentioned the dumplings being bland but these came out delicious! I used the technique of browning the dumplings in a pan first (used cooking spray and heat on medium high) and then poured a cup of chicken broth in the pan and quickly covered. Once the broth dried up, I uncovered them and made sure they crisped up again on the bottom. Yummy! I served these with soy sauce mixed with a chile garlic paste, Sambal Oelek. Spicy good. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I did not add any cabbage since I like the dumplings at Chinese restaurants with just meat in them. I place 9 to 12 wonton wrappers on a flexible plastic cutting board and use a stainless steel oil sprayer filled with water to mist each wonton lightly two times each. Then I place the filling on all the wontons at the same time, and then fold them over into a rectangle shape and press down the seams. I then mist each folded wonton once and give them 3 pleats each before I place them on wax paper. Every so often I mist the wontons I have already made so they do not dry out until I have the tray filled. I found my assembly line using the sprayer cut down on my time tremendously and my fingers stay much cleaner. I also use a nonstick pan and just spray the dumplings generously with cooking spray. I spray the first side before they go in the pan, and then spray the second side once they are in the pan. I then fry both sides until nicely brown and then steam 1/2 cup of water off (with the lid on) for about 10 min the way someone else's review suggested.

These are great and easy to make!  I always make them using ground turkey instead of ground pork.  They turn out more flavorable than some of the ones I have had at Chinese Restaurants.  My nine year old loves them.

I have made it several time and without doubts its better than our local Japanese/Chinese restaurant. I cooked them in a Chinese bamboo steamer. Then, I sauteed them in olive oil just to make them crispy. Its time consuming but its worthwhile. For the dipping sauce, I prepare 1/2 cup of soy sauce, a few drops of sesame oil, a drop of rice wine vinegar and add a few spring onions well chopped as well as sesame seeds. Its fantastic! This recipe is my No 1 when it comes to dinner parties or company. EXCELLENT!

Excellent!  The filling tastes exactly like the ones we get at our favorite Chinese food restaurant; in fact my husband liked them better.  I made a dipping suace with soy sauce, white sugar, rice wine vinegar, fresh grated ginger and chopped scallions.  Yummy!  They are not difficult at all, just a bit of time to put together 100+ of these yummy dumplings.  Next time I think I'll halve the recipe.  I couldn't find Chinese cabbage, so I used the leafy green part of Bok Choy.  I like pan fried for the crispy, but I steamed first for 20 min. because I was afraid just pan frying the skins would be burned before the pork got cooked.  I froze a batch after steaming, then the next day thawed and pan fried.  Perfect.  The rest of the batch I froze without cooking first, so we'll see how they turn out.  Great recipe.  Thanks!  Update: the ones I froze uncooked came out great too.  I steamed for 10 mins. and then a quick pan fry with peanut oil.  I cut down the steam time (first round I was afraid of undercooking pork) and they were perfectly cooked, and the pork didn't shrink as much.  We made a meal out of them.  Yum!

This recipe is amazing!!! My husband said they tasted very authentic! I halved the recipe and it made 49 dumplings. I love the idea of pan frying them and then adding chicken broth to the pan, covering and steaming for 15 minutes, worked great. Perfectly seasoned garlicky dumplings. My husband is finishing the rest off right now and says they're oddly addictive! I also made a dipping sauce with soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar and green onions as others have suggested. Excellent recipe!

Really good filling. I had trouble with the folding of the dumplings - because I'm all thumbs, so I decided to rolls these like mini egg rolls. Delicious. We dipped them in a red chili thai sauce and loved the flavor. I froze 1/2 of this recipe on baking sheets and placed baggies of 10 in the freezer. My son loves them for a quick after school snack or a quick weekend lunch.

These came out pretty good for me. Since this was my first time making homemade "potstickers", I decided to cook the pork first before adding it to the rest of the ingredients. It worked ok, but I really think everything would've held together better had I just stuck to the recipe and left the meat raw. I will do that next time. I couldn't find wonton wrappers at the grocery store, so I used the "Wonton Wrappers" recipe found on this site, and they worked very well.I recommend them if you'd like to make your own. My only real complaint - making these dumplings was very time consuming. I'd make them again, as I thought they were delicious, but not any time soon :)  Thank you for sharing!

used a 2 cups cabbage and 2 cups bok choy, added the Chines 5 spice from this site and a tsp of sugar. This makes a large batch. I steamed them all, the longer the meat mixture sat the better they tasted. So I would mix the filling and leave 2-4 hours, then make the dumplings. We can't stop eating these, sooo good.

YUM!  I scaled down to 1lb of pork, used 2 Tbsp of ginger per others, kept 1 egg, and used 2 large handfuls of shredded cole slaw.  Perfect!  I was able to finish off an entire package of wonton wrappers which I then cooked per the "Pot Stickers Traditional" recipe.. pan fry for 3 min, then steam in 3/4 cup of water for about 8 minutes.  So amazing!  You do NOT need to pre-cook the pork... the fry/steam will do the work for you!

These were fantastic!  The only changes I made to the recipe was to use bagged shredded cabbage instead of chopping my own.  Also, I cooked them in a pan over medium low heat.  After about 2 minutes on each side, I poured in a bit of water and put a lid over it so they could steam the rest of the way.  It was much faster than steaming in my electric steamer!  I served it with Kikkoman Ponzu sauce.  They were spectacular!  Even my picky husband loved them!

WOW! If I could rate this a 10* I would. This turned out VERY good. My hubby said it is restaurant quality. I used Fresh Express coleslaw mix with green and red cabbage with carrots - shredded. It worked perfect. Also, I boiled the dumplings for about 5 minutes instead of steaming. Was amazing!! I dipped in oriental dipping sauce also found of this site. I mean PERFECT! I served with the Peanut butter noodles from this site too. This could not of been a better meal!!! TIP: for your leftovers just put in plastic container...they will stick together when cooled but the next day just cover the dumplings in hot tap water for a couple of minutes and they will seperate. EDIT: I have made these many of times as our family LOVES this recipe...I tried to boil them and then fry them to make them "pot sickers" and that did NOT work at all...I even tried to fry them before boiling and that did not work either..

these were good...but i have had better ones...on other reviews i read people were having problems with there dumpling sticking...to fix that lay down cabbage or lettuce first and then put ur dumplings on top of that it wont change the flavor...also i used lean ground pork...and my pork shrunk...and it seemed a little dry so next time i am gonna use regular ground pork and then maybe they will taste as good as the chinese food place

wonderful!  outstanding!  These are the best dumplings I have ever had in my life.  I would eat them everyday if I knew that I would eventually get sick of these.  They are awesome!!  we used bok choy for the chinese lettuce and they were delicous. we will deffinatly make again.  We made them for the Chinese New Year.  we dipped it in 1 tb hoisin, 1 ts miran and 1 ts soy sauce. so good!

great appetizer.  I reduced the amount of sesame oil to just a teaspoon, (I think a little goes a long way), and I reduced the amount of shredded cabbage.  I also fried briefly the dumplings before steaming them.  I find a brief browning in the pan prevents their sticking together in the steamer.  I didn't have any trouble stuffing and cooking with uncooked pork, I think they come out juicier if stuffed raw, just be sure to steam sufficiently long enough to cook through.  These were a big hit at the Christmas party!  Thank you for this recipe.

I made the filling only, and made up wrappers as I needed them. I didn't use as much cabbage as it called for, and I found I needed a little more liquid. But it smelled and tasted perfect!

This is a great recipe. I froze them and a few days later added them to homemade chicken broth, lemon grass, egg,  and before serving a splash of sesame oil and chopped scallions as a tasty soup. Delicious!

Going to use this recipe forever. TIP if you do not have a steamer I Youtubed it and just prepare a large pot of boiling water a metal rack to place on top of the pot and a large skillet to cover your dumplings

I wasn't that big of a fan. Hubby loved them more than store-bought though. Lot of work when steaming, so give yourself enough time.

These turned out wonderful! I haven't seen the egg used in other recipes, but I think that helped it all stick together, like with meatloaf. If it hadn't taken 3 hours to make, we would have these more often.

This was a really good recipe. However the ONLY package of wonton wrappers I could find was a 48 Ct package and it took about 1.2 lb of ground beef. I also did not use cabbage because I didn't have any. However I did follow the rest of the recipe exactly. It seems like a lot of liquid but it is actually perfect. I steamed them for about 15min and they came out WONDERFUL. My bf must have eaten about 30 of them lol.
The dipping sauce in one of the reviews was quite good as well.

I make mine without the ginger, garlic and onion, which is how my friend from Beijing makes it, use spinach instead of Chinese cabbage and make my own dough/wonton circles. Also, instead of steaming them, you can bring a big pot of water to boil and drop the wrapped dumplings into the boiling water. Once they float to the surface, let them cook for a couple more minutes and they should be done.
If you are adventurous, you may try the following: after shredding the spinach, squeeze them in palmfuls and collect the dark green juice in a bowl. Incorporate this juice into your dough, mix well and you will have green dumplings!

These were great!  I halved the recipe, and used ground turkey (it was on sale) and a bag of cabbage/carrot slaw mix, and it was delicious!  I also boiled them (don't have a bamboo steamer) for 6 minutes, which worked just fine for me.  I'll try steaming once I eventually acquire a bamboo steamer.  Next time I will definitely try pork, but the turkey was great too!  Served with that Asian Dipping Sauce that lots of people recommended and it was a nice match, but next time I'll probably try something different to dip them in.  I froze the leftovers on a cookie sheet and threw them in a ziploc bag... can't wait to eat them!  Thanks for demystifying the preparation of this delicious dish for me!

Very tasty recipe.  I made one substitution. I used bok choy instead of the chinese cabbage. The recipe yielded 60-70 dumplings. I ran out of wrappers and still had plenty of filling left over.   I steamed some dumplings and it came out okay.  I froze the remainder of the batch.  The next day I pan-fried them from frozen. I used only a bit of cooking spray, and fried 2-3 minutes until golden. I then added a cup of water to the pan and let cook for another 10-12 minutes uncovered on medium heat.  The water evaporates and the remaining product was great.   It was much more tastier than  the steamer method.  I will definitely make them again, but will pan-fry instead.

This was a fabulous recipe. The only thing I changed was how to cook them - I cooked them in a frying pan, with a bit of olive oil. There's definately an art to the steaming process, which I'm no good at, so I just browned them in the oil and they were great! What to do differently next time: chop and mix ingredients WELL before dinner time, even the day before, just omitt the cabbage until ready to cook so it doesn't get soggy.

This is something that has to be cooked right away, if you store them they will stick together and become an aweful mess.

I omit  soy sauce and egg, and use a tablespoon of kosher salt split. Cut cabbage and sprinkle two teaspoons of kosher salt on it and toss. Set aside and work on the filling while moisture is drawn out of cabbage. Once filling is complete, wring out  cabbage and add to the filling. Two teaspoons of salt seems like a lot, but most  will leave with the squeezed out moisture. Add last teaspoon of salt directly to the filling, or use less if you think it is too much salt. I use a piping bag and spray bottle of water to fill and wet the wrappers. I do 9 to 12 wontons at a time. I moisten them all at once with the spray bottle, and then fill and seal. Once sealed, I moisten the outside with the spray bottle, and give each 3 to 6 pleats. I mist finished ones every so often until they make it to the freezer. I cook them directly from frozen. I use a nonstick pan with lid. Place 3/4 to 1 cup of water in the bottom of the pan, and drizzle a tablespoon or two of oil in as well. Put frozen dumplings in the pan and place the lid on tightly. Cook on med-high heat until all the water has boiled off (it will boil off even if lid is tight). Once the water has almost all boiled off, remove the lid and turn down to med-low or low heat until bottom of dumpling are brown and crisp. If you want more sides crisp (mine have 3 sides), flip them. With my assembly line method I can do a whole batch in about an hour, and it makes a BIG bag for freezer.

I think that this was a great recipe for pork dumplings.  They were very successful and very tasty.  You need to plan a little extra time to make dinner if you are not overly proficient at wrapping the dumplings.  Be careful not to overfill the dumplings either.

These tasted great! While easy, they were time consuming. Next time I will probably make them all the day before. I pan fried and then steamed with water in the skillet. Next time I will try boiling in salted water. Very authentic and my kids loved them.

Yum! Took a bit of practice but... definitely a winner. After a few tries/youtube videos I made the following changes. 1. dont use square.. makes too much extra dough, was gross. I took stacks of the goza wrappers cut off the corners to make rough circles, and then would make pleats on one side- more filling fit in, and better filling to dough ratio. 2. I boiled the first batch, not worth it. Spread sesame oil lightly on a pan over med heat, placed a batch of dumplings in the pan and then pour a scant cup of noiling water over them to cover them half way. cover the pan and steam the dumplings until the water is evaporated (about five or six min). Whena ll the water is gone, drip a little sesame oil in between the rows of dumplings to crisp up the edges and remove from pan after a minute or two when the bottoms are browned and crispy. PERFECT! I used spinach instead of cabbage, and doubled the ginger and used six cloves of garlic. Sauce was a few tbs of soy sauce plus rice vinegar plus a tiny bit of sesame oil. SO good. Just took a while....

These are definitely tasty! I added 2 more cloves of garlic and another egg. I thought that 15 minutes was too long to steam and found that 10 minutes was perfect. You can't layer these on top of each other to cook as they stick. We served it with white rice. Definitely will make these again!

I thought these little guys were mighty tasty!  I made 44 total, I simply used up all my leftover wonton wraps from a previous night's dish.  I ended up with roughly half the pork mixture leftover that I'll use another time.  I mixed everything in the food processor for ease.  I used a melon scooper which made it easier but still, these were incredibly time consuming!  So glad I made a LOT at one time!  Serving size for an appetizer should be more like 5 dumplings.. 15?!  Really!?  I tried pan frying these but that was a made idea.  I'll follow all the other suggestions and just boil these because they stuck the pan and the undersides looked pretty messy.  So I just made sure to serve these pretty-side-up :)  Picture on my profile.  I served this with a small dish of low-sodium soy sauce.  So other than how long these took to put together (yea, we're talking like 3 hours here) and a possible technique problem, these were so scrumptious and were a perfect compliment to an Asian-themed dinner!

I made half the recipe and used a whole pack of wrappers. I used bok choy and steamed them. Outstanding! So much cheaper than buying them at Chinese restaurant. Will make them again and again.

yummy, but definately add shitake mushrooms, one additional spoonful of soysauce & sesame oil. I steamed it with cabbage leaf on the bottom, and the dumplings are delish!

These were super tasty. They were out of won-ton skins so I used egg roll skins cut into fourths. It made them a little thicker, but definitely worked and tasted good!

It was fabulous!  Since my family doesn't eat pork, I used chicken instead.  It was still wonderful. I didn't have a good steamer and fried them instead.

I make these only I use crushed(ground) shrimp to the mixture. Gives a little seafood taste without the texture.

This recipe was great- very tasty.  My family gobbled them up.  
However, I don't think I'll make it again.  It took way too long to make.   I bought the cabbage and other ingrediants pre-chopped too.   I did not have a large steamer basket so I was only able to steam 5-6 at a time.  This from a package of 65 wrappers took me quite some time to cook all of them.   I added lettuce to the metal steamer that I had which made them easier to remove but I found they were much more tasty fried in a little oil.
I should have heeded the advice of the other reviewers of this recipe that complained about the time too. 
This is good but be pre-pared to spend 2-3 hours making this.  Oy vey.

I didn't actually make this, because the ingredients are almost the same as I already make.  However, a few tips:
-I used no cabbage, just a little finally chopped celery and opnion
-while making them, put them on a lighly floured piece of waxed paper
- never let the uncooked dumplings touch each other, either in storing or in steamimg
- I fry these lightly after steaming and so I only steam the dumplings for about 5 minutes.  If you steam over boiling water, they will be cooked in no time.  
-just fry for a few minutes in hot peanut oil
-dipping sauce:
     soy sauce
     add some finally chopped fresh ginger
     few drops of sesame oil
     little rice wine vinegar if you have it

I'm hungry.  Have to go to the store to make this tommorrow

use a dumpling wrapper (round) instead. makes them alot better. dumpling wrappers are thicker than the wonton wrappers and steam better. also as another person metioned do not let them touch. spray your steamer with pam it does help.

I gave a 4 instead of 5 stars only because I found the steaming time to be only 10 minutes rather than the 15-20 suggested in the recipe. They came out very nicely (I added chopped cilantro and minced carrots to  the mix to up the nutrient value and flavor). This was my first time making dumplings at home so I followed the recipe closely. I'm pleased with the outcome and thought they tasted just like Chinese takeout. 

For added flavor, I also made a dipping sauce of reduced sodium soy sauce, a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and a squeeze or two of honey. I let that settle while I made the dumplings. It was a perfect match!

These are the best I have made. The only thing I recommend is that you lightly use olive oil on the outside of the dumplings before placing them on a metal steamer. Mine stuck to the steamer and it was a big fat mess to get them off of it. Still worth the hassle though!

I would halve the amount of sesame oil - it overwhelms even the ginger! Also, maybe cook the cabbage a bit before adding to the mix? The cabbage was unfortunately crunchy in the finished product, at least when I made them directly without freezing first.

Really tasty! Next time I'll triple the recipe and invite some friends over to help assemble them. They freeze well so we can all share the dumplings to take home.

These are delicious! I did not have sesame oil, so i just used a little olive oil.  Instead of folding them in triangles, i find it a little tricky to keem them closed, i shaped them into little squares as well as little pouches by sinching up the 4 corners.  Very tasty served with a peanut satay sauce (which has sesame oil in it). Thanks for the recipe!

I made these as an appetizer for a Japanese dinner party.  They were a huge hit.  I halved the recipe and it was still plenty for the 10 guests; not sure where they get 6 servings from if you make the full recipe.

Traditional and delicious.  I linked your recipe to our GetAllergyWise blog.  I use ground turkey instead of pork and ofen use a 16oz bag of frozen spinach or chopped fresh chives in place of the napa cabbage.  I also like to add a little sugar and a splash of cooking wine to the meat mixture.

I cut this recipe in 1/2 & followed the recipe completely.  LOVED them!  Way better than my favorite Chinese restaurant's pot stickers!  Simple to make, just took a bit to get them all steamed.  I did it in 3 batches, putting the done ones in the oven on warm to keep them warm until we were ready to eat.

Sooooo good. My only tip is to cut this recipe in half if you're not having a huge party. I used an entire package of wonton wrappers and had so much filling left over. I'm going to go back and buy some more wrappers and make the rest to freeze, though. These were delicious and tasted like the real thing from a Japanese restaurant.

Very good recipe! Very time consuming, but worth it in the end! My whole family loved them. Also when looking for the wrappers, try finding the larger ones. It took me 4 hours to wrap 100 small dumplings.

Yum, these were delicious and easy to make. I added cilantro and shitake mushrooms just to add more flavor. I used lean ground pork and they were moist and perfect. I steamed them in a bamboo steamer, which worked so well and made it super easy.  I froze the extra dumplings and when I steamed them frozen they came out equally as perfect. Great recipe.

VERY AUTHENTIC!!! I've been eating these since I was five. My chinese baby sitter cooked these and we loved them!! The only difference was she added some rice wine vinegar to the soy sauce used for dipping! Make sure to use cooking spray on the bottom so the dumplings don't stick. I used half of this recipe and it was plenty for four adults. I also used less cabbage, more soy sauce, and less sesame oil due to my individual tastes.

Wonderful!  I don't eat pork, so I replace it with ground chicken.  This recipe makes SO much filling. I buy extra wrappers, construct, and freeze the rest.  I have also made "chinese meatballs" out of the extra filling and served as a chicken lo mein.

Update:still love these things...and eat with pork now. Reduced recipe by half, still made enough to freeze. Cheated and used prepacked coleslaw mix so I didn't have to mess with chopping cabbage (such a pain!) also still used the whole egg. Used my measuring teaspoon to fill wrappers. Perfect amount.

This is awesome as is.  However, I like garlic and green onions so the second time I made it I tripled the green onion and the garlic and I and those I served it to thought it was even better.   Also, I tried, as others suggested frying them a little before steaming them and they were good, but I don't think the extra step in necesarry.    I used a variation of the sauce another reviewer recommended - 2 TBSP Soy, 2 TBSP Rice Wine Vinegar, 1 TBSP Sunflower Oil and a couple of scallions sliced up.  Fantastic.

I had a group of friends over last night and these were a huge "HIT"!   I used gyoza skins because I really like their texture. Other than that, all the ingredients remained the same.   They were easy to make the night before. I went through all the steps and then froze them as another reviewer recommended. To cook: I put them in a really large pot of water and let them cook for about 3 to 5 minutes after they floated. Served with the dipping sauce recipe also on this site.

I would try finding a wonton/dumpling skin recipe as using wonton wrappers were a bit too thin. You can also try using two sheets of wrapper instead.

This was a delicious recipe.  When making I substituted spinach instead of the Chinese cabbage, and only put in 1 1/2 cups of it in the mixture. I also added a bit more garlic.  For a dipping sauce I followed the recommendation of FullTime Mom by mixing 2 T. soy sauce, 1/2 t. vinegar (rice vinegar is best but all I had was white vinegar), a drop of sesame oil, I also added a red pepper flakes.  As other reviewers have mentioned these do take some time to make but if you have someone to fold while you stuff it goes much faster.

I really loved this dish!! I have never made anything like it...fun! Quite time consuming (wrapping the wontons), but worth it!! I froze most of them on a cookie sheet and then bagged them, so that I can pull them out as an appetizer any time! My husband asked me to deep fry them next time, but I think I would like it either way. They were a hit at my Asian food themed party!

Excellent.  I made with ground chicken instead of pork but that was the only thing I changed for the filling.  I browned first on one side and steamed using chicken broth.  They were great.   I made a really good soy-based dipping sauce.  These were great!!

I prefer to follow recipe as written, I did not have any pork, I had left over chicken and took the advice of previous poster and used celery and onion, did not have cabbage.  I steamed one batch, and then brown the next batch in a pan and then steamed.  My DD prefered steamed ones.  Also I halved the recipe.

Fantastic!  My family loved these.  They are so worth the effort.  I steamed my dumplings for 10 minutes and then pan fried for about a minute a side.  They came out perfectly and there are plenty leftover for tomorrow.

This recipe is great as is!  I did add a few shrimp and threw them in a blender with the rest of the mix for different combination and it came out well.  The flavor is great.  I made my own sauce by combining soy sauce, white vinegar, a little mirin, a little sesame oil, some chopped spring onion, a little fresh ginger and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.  Basically I just used what I already had from the recipe plus a few other items I had on hand- It was delicious!

Excellent recipe and great as described. I made a few improvements and used 1lb lean ground pork and a half pound of frozen raw shrimp.  Also I substituted organic red chard for the cabbage.  

Pan frying gives them a nice crunchy texture.  Low-med heat and cover with lid to cook through.   Also in my opinion all dumplings should be served with a mixture of rice vinegar and soya sauce.

These were pretty good! I used the filling for wonton soup and they came out delicious. I used ground chicken because a family member does not eat pork. I added some grated carrot to the mixture. The only change I would make would be to reduce the amount of ginger a little as it seemed a tad too strong for me and I'd like to add a little more garlic next time, but my husband thought they were perfect. My recommendation to others would be to fill 1 wonton, boil, and taste first so you can adjust the seasonings as you want, or cook 1 tsp in a small pan to taste test. Great recipe that is simple and easy to make! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made it exactly as written with fresh ingredients. Sorry to say we found it to be very dry and bland. It was like mealy pork meatballs wrapped in won tons. Nothing like the wonderful moist dumplings we get from our local restaurant. I will say the use of won ton wrappers was close to what we are used to, the filling is the issue.

These are really tasty!  I only had 1 1lb of pork, so I halved all of the other ingredients (except ginger).  On another site, they suggested blanching the vegetables, so I did.  I used Shanghai Bok Choy, they were really tiny & very tender.  I cut off the stems & discarded them, as I only wanted the leaves for this one.  I kept the folded dumplings under a damp paper towel as well as the wrappers that were waiting for folding.  Apparently, it's important to keep them from drying out.   For a first time effort, I was very pleased.

This was the first time I made dumplings, and I would change a few things in my process such as making sure that I don't get as much flour on them before I steam them. But I do have to say that I love steaming them - it's so much healthier than frying them. All in all, not bad. I enjoyed these.

These taste wonderful and they're great for our budget because the recipe yields so many.  My husband has determined that we must have them at least once a month. I agree.  The leftovers make my lunch break at work magical.

Wish I could put three and a half but it is what it is.  The taste of the Pork was phenomenal.  However, steaming these lead to a pile of stuck together messiness.  I would definitely cut the amount in half simply because storing the dumplings before cooking is impossible if they touch at all they become one.  Lastly, I would fry these simply because the recipe really isn't healthy at all to start with and frying enhances the flavors massively.

I love this recipe, with a few modifications. I used ground turkey (added a bit of black pepper and more garlic--to spice it up a bit). I cooked the turkey first and then mixed all the other things together. Also, I did as other reviewers did and browned them first in cooking spray, then steamed for a few minutes. My entire family (kids included), couldn't get enough of them.

OK.  These were delicious.  I was skeptical of steaming them and so baked half of them for 15 minutes at 400.  We definitely liked them better steamed.  They're really good!  We did however learn not to steam more than one layer at a time because they all molded together.  Make sure not to layer and not to let touch one another if you steam.  Really liked with the sauce by another on here: 2 T soy, 1/2 t. rice vinegar, a few drops of sesame oil.

First attempt at making Chinese food. My boyfriend loves loves loves dumplings at local restaurants. He was ver doubtful these would be good. He tried one...and didn't stop till the plate was gone. The mix of ginger, sesame oil, and delicious pork and cabbage was amazing. I used other suggestions and made a dipping sauce of soy sauce rice vinegar and sesame oil with chopped green onion. I didn't steam them, I pan fried them in a non stick pan with a splash of oil. It is time consuming but great hands on project for date night, crack a bottle of wine and have fun. You'll deffinately enjoy these

I love the Pot Stickers that we get from take-out, and now I can make them at home, and they are even better!  I don't have a bamboo steamer, I just steam them in a covered wok in some chicken broth, they are great as meal with some steamed vegetables or as a side dish!

These turned out wonderfully. I followed the recipe with the exception of using a sliced pork loin that I finely chopped vs the ground pork. I really like the idea of freezing them because it does make a lot.

I thought these were really good. I used the recipe as a guideline, but made a few changes: I only used 1.5 pounds of ground pork, 8 cloves of garlic, about 1/4 cup of scallions, and I scaled the sesame oil back to 1 tablespoon. I used 1/3 of a head of regular cabbage that I blanched, and chopped up. I did not add the egg, as I think it would "toughen up" the meat mixture. It held together just fine without it. I would sugget using thin gyoza or wonton wrappers, as it really lets the flavors come through. I made wonton and pan fried it, and made some for soup.  It was excellent! This recipe comes together very easily, and is a keeper!  I am planning to make a batch tomorrow and put in my freezer for future meals. Thank you for posting!

These are absolutely delicious and a real crowd-pleaser! I put them on a cookie sheet and brushed them with sesame oil, then baked them until golden brown and crispy. Came out great!

Not bad. I've found better, and no more complicated, dumplings in an asian cookbook that we much prefer. Maybe more ginger would help?

These are phenomenal!! I doubled the ginger and green onion because I LOVE them, and added a tsp of salt and some red chili sauce for a kick. They steamed beautifully and I used all 100 wonton wrappers and still have about a cup of filling left. I CANNOT thank you enough for this recipe...I may never order takeout again!!

This recipe is fantastic.  It's the perfect filling for dumplings.  There's a few things I've learned technique-wise that make these easier.  First of all, forming the dumplings can be a little challenging, but I searched around online and found some good tutorials.  Also when you go to steam these, spray the bamboo steamer liberally with vegatable oil spray or line with lettuce leaves to prevent them from sticking.  Also, I used regular cabbage, but I suppose this would work for whatever type you use, if you can salt the cabbage and draw out the water before fixing the filling, the dumplings will cook better.

These were quite good... Served them with sweet chile sauce which went well together.  I took the advice of another reviewer and boiled them rather than steaming them... next time I will try steaming them because my wonton wrappers just fell apart in the boiling process, perhaps it was too hard of a boil.  The dumplings themselves were good enough to definately try again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

PLAN on at least ONE HOUR for prep time!  THese were wonderful, but they took FAR longer to prep than I expected.  I'm glad I have 40+ in the freezer for another time...my husband REALLY liked them.  He was my biggest skeptic...plus he was the one watching the kids while I putzed around in the kitchen for 2 hours!  Crazy, but good, and worth the effort. :)

Update:  The second time around these turned out SO well, I thought I would post what I did as a reminder to mySELF what worked for me. :)  I pulsed the cabbage to a pulp in my food processor, squeezed out the excess liquid, then added the remaining ingredients. I also replaced the egg with 2 Tablespoons cornstarch for a better texture, imo.  AND, i cut back on the sesame oil to about a tsp. due to my husbands' distaste for it.  Fried them in a stainless steel pan in a little bit of palm oil shortening (they did NOT stick) to a deep golden brown, then added about 1/2-3/4 cup chicken stock, covered and let steam until most of the liquid evaporated.  I took off the cover to let the remaining liquid evaporate.  These were INCREDIBLE.  So, so good.  I must try them with ground chicken.

Very Good!  I halved the entire recipe (using 1 lb pork and 1 head of bak choy).  Served it with a dipping sauce I got off this site: 2 TBSP rice wine, 2 TBSP soy sauce, 1/2 tsp sesame oil, and 1 tsp minced green onion.  Instead of steaming, I followed another recipe which called to heat 3 TBSP veg oil in a deep skillet, add pot stickers seam side up and fry 30 seconds, then pour 3/4 cup water on top.  Gently boil 7 to 8 minutes (until water almost evaporates) then add another 2 TBSP oil.  Cook until lightly browned.

This was time consuming, but worth it. I ended up using two wrappers for each dumpling, because as try as I might, I could not get it to work folding just one. They kept falling apart or ripping. I was even using a teaspoon to apply the filling and it was still too much. That said, it all worked out for the best. They were yummy and very easy to make. I first fried for a few moments to brown and then added water to the pan to steam-cook them the rest of the way. We gobbled them up!

YUM! Soooooooo good! This recipe really makes a lot, so think carefully before doubling - I did, and had TONS of filling left over. Used my vegetable steamer to steam them, but some of the skins ended up sticking, so I am looking for a bamboo steamer for the next batch. Used angel hair coleslaw shred, as mentioned by others and it worked out great - also used more garlic and ginger because we love the flavour.  Made the dipping sauce listed by another reviewer and it was also FABULOUS!  Really made the flavour of the dumplings pop.  These take some work, but it is soooo worth the time and effort.

This is my second batch,  I have been told they are better then restraunts.  I do use abit less cabbage  then called for.  A good dip I make (after lots of trys) is equal parts soy sauce and rive vinagar, a spash of sesame oil, pinch of pepper flakes, (garlic, and ginger is good in it to)

I really liked this recipe.  Did not add cabbage, but no one knew anything was missing.  They were quite flavorful and relatively easy to make.  My daughter (5) helped seal the wontons into triangles and our entire fmaily devoured them.  We definitely enjoyed the ones we steamed (80%) over the ones we fried in peanut oil.

I made these and both myself and my husband thoroughly enjoyed them.  However, they are quite time consuming and more than a little messy, hence the 4 stars.  However, will definately make again.

Made this for Chinese New Year and it was a HUGE hit.  I ommitted the ginger since some family members have allergies to it and it was still delicious.  I had a lot of the mixture leftover since I chose not to make all 100 and it froze beautifully and made more awesome dumpings the next weekend.  This is a keeper!

What a fantastic recipe!  I folded the wonton like a crab rangoon wrapper and fried it like a potsticker instead of steaming. I also substituted regular cabbage and peanut oil.  Serve dipped in Hoisin sause and it is very tasty!  If you run out of wrappers, stir fry the remaining pork and serve over lo mein noodles.

I used ground turkey and made this recipe with half the amount called for.  I doubled the garlic, ginger, and green onion.  I ended up with 30 dumplings.  I fried/steamed 10 and steamed the rest in the metal basket with PAM.  The steamed ones came out so much better than the fried/steamed and they were so amazing.  Great flavor and texture.  Delicious with hoisin sauce!

These were the absolute best dumplings I've ever tasted...so flavorful!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the steaming.  I used a shallow pan half full of water and cooked them at a simmer for about 5-7 min.  This worked really well.  I also froze the leftovers as it made way too many for my husband and I..then I just thawed them in the fridge and the tasted as good as when they where fresh cooked!  Great recipe!!

These are awesome, but I can't imagine that six people could finish these!  Definitely not an accurate "servings" number.  I would add a bit of salt to the mixture, even with the soy sauce.  I used ground turkey, and it worked out great!

These pot stickers were great. I used a lot less cabbage then the recipe called for. Time consuming, but worth it!

These were really great. I love dumplings! I didn't put the shrimp in whole. I processed them with everything else and used it as filling. Very tasty. I think I would like to try my hand at finding some dumpling wrappers (different from won ton wrappers) and making these into dumplings. Thanks for submitting!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!
We enjoy these steamed or deep-fried, and we also use the recipe for the Oriental Dipping Sauce... we can't keep them on the plate! SNARF!

Great recipe! Easy (though time-consuming), fun, and, to our minds, authentic. Kids kept asking for more and more. I was worried about the raw pork cooking through, so after steaming them I followed another reviewer's suggestion and also fried them lightly in sesame oil (in a non-stick pan) just before serving. The only other changes I made was to halve the recipe while using close to the original amount of garlic and ginger, but we always go heavy on those. Oh, and I added a teaspoon or so of brown sugar to the filling, as well. The 12 yr old gives it a 9.5 (and he's a tough customer).

Great taste.  We cooked the filling 1st.  I recommend it.  I really don't see any reason to handle/risk the raw filling.  I also think doubling/tripling the eggs helps (if you are pre-cooking it)

I altered this recipe just a bit since I couldn't find some of the ingredients.  I cooked up a lb. of minced pork, cabbage and leeks, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and the sesame oil.  This turned out to be a great filling.  After cooking it all I chopped it up a bit finer so it would stuff easier into the wonton wrappers (I made these by hand using the wonton wrapper recipe from here).  Got lots of compliments on these.  Can't wait to do them again.

This recipe sounds good, but i wouldn't know exactly, cause i've never tried it.  All i would like to know is can you substitute lettuce for the cabbage?

Very flavorful. Followed the recipe. I didn't have quite as much cabbage and a bit more pork but, it still came out great. I froze them before steaming. I fried some also. Yummy! Had some filling left over. Thinking it would be good as a Chinese meatball in soup, over rice with a sauce or even added to meatloaf.

I have made these several times.  Takes time to assemble, but so worth it.  Used carrots (super easy as I chopped them in a blender) in place of the cabbage. Post steaming, kids love it with a soy sauce and ketchup dip or sauted lightly with in soy and sesame oil.  For some spice, I have added a cayenne to the meat mixture and saute post steaming in sriracha, soy, and sesame. With leftover meat filling, I threw in some panko bread crumbs and turned them into meatballs...YUM!

It tastes delicious! Very much like one you would buy for take out. I steamed these in my bamboo steamer and they held up very well. Only thing is that it is a big production, folding them, cooking them, it’s long!! I definitely recommend this recipe!

The pork and chicken sausage turned into a greasy mess.  Next time not going to add the sesame oil.  Needed more salt.  You really need to let the dumplings steam the full time and then some.  Don't be tempted to open the lid.  I still had to pan fry at the end.  Even though I put a tiny amount per dumpling the pork still didn't cook all the au.  Next time I'm thinking of frying the meat first and then putting it in the wonton wrapper. My kids love dumplings so I'll muster up the courage to try again.

Makes a ton of dumplings. Enough for a party. I fried them for a bit to crisp them up. Then dumped a quarter cup of water on top and covered to steam. Worked great, very good!

These dumplings are fantastic! The only change I made was using ground ginger as I had run out of the fresh.  I froze them on cookie trays covered with wax paper and then placed them in ziplock bags. They steam very well right out of the freezer.

I don't eat pork, so I didn't taste , but made for my family as a main dish. All loved it, asked to have again.  Couldn't find won ton wraps, so made in egg roll form.  Recipe yielded 12.  Didn't take long as others have suggested.   Browned pork w ginger root first, then baked.  Used kale based cabbage.   Nice change from my "regular" meals...will definitely make again, also as appetizers.  Thank you!

These were AWESOME! Yes, the wrapping is time consuming, but if you get your 16 year old to help you, then it goes much faster. She is a Pot Sticker addict like myself. I also used the rice wine/soy sauce suggestion (adding a touch of chili sauce) to make a dipping sauce. Yes, it makes a large recipe, I cut it in half and still have some in the freezer to use for another time!

Made it with Tofu instead of pork and took out the egg. I basically made it vegan and it turned out to be a success.

These came out so great! I made them up and put them on parchment on a cookie sheet and put them in the freezer for an hour. Then you can just toss them in a freezer bag and cook whenever you want!

wow these are tasty, I wasn't a total fan of the sauce however it was good I just love tradishtional dumpling dipping sauce. I made one modification and that was doing one tablespoon regular soy sauce and one reduced sodium however I will do it the ordinal way next time just to compare. I was genuinely surprised at how easy these were and dumplings are one of my favorite foods. seriously try this recipie!! Had a problem with folding them so I just did the wonton fold and it was perfect

Delicious!! I added shiitake mushrooms and cooked the dumplings by first frying one side for a couple of minutes, then adding 1c water and steaming in the skillet for 5 min. Will definitely make again.

So I had now made these 3 times and made them in batches of 60.  I am not stretch a good cook and have fat fingers. These have turned out amazing each time. I do steam them and have learned don't over flour these as the flour gets mealy. When steaming they take 20 minutes and I use sesame oil on the bottom of the double steamer to give them an extra taste.

I used pork sausage instead of ground pork and it was amazing!! I did what another reviewer suggested and browned them in a pan with cooking spray, then dumped in a cup of chicken stock and covered, then once all the fluid boiled out I browned again on both sides and they were awesome!

Super receipe!  Easy to do too.  I had always wanted to do this and thought it would be too difficult.  I followed the receipe and the use of the egg does seem to bind all together.  I did add 1 tablespoon of fried chili paste (super hot) cause we love hot stuff - very hot!  They steamed perfectly.  Big hit at the house and I will definitly do this again and again.

Made these last night and they were delicious.  Easy to assemble and prepare.  I scaled down the recipe to feed one but 16 of these actually fed two.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy.

Fantastic. The flavour was intense and it was not too difficult to make. I used rice paper sheets because I could not find wonton wrappers at my local supermarket.

I have made these dumplings on several occasions and for different groups of people. They are always a hit and always requested again and again. They are a bit time consuming but soooo worth it!! I also steam them in my bamboo steamer. Just remember to line the steamer with lettuce so the dumplings don't stick to the bamboo. Also, if I have a little more time, I make the mixture the night before, mix well and leave it covered overnight in the frig. FABULOUS!!!!!

I wish I could give it higher than a 5 star! I made these using regular cabbage. That's all I had and couldn't find Chinese cabbage.  These were amazing! I made them for a party of about 30 people. I made them ahead of time. And thank God I did. The. I made the mixture and let it sit for a few hours to let the cabbage soften. Then stuffed them. I put them on a sheet pan and froze them. When frozen I moved them to a zip lock bag in the freezer. They are very time consuming. But so worth it! The day of the party I would put about 8 in a pot of boiling salted water. Then cook till they floated and a little extra. I couldn't make them fast enough. My husband and brother took over cooking so that I could do other things. But we had two pots going and still not fast enough. I wish I had another way to make them faster or ahead of time. But you don't want them to dry out. They should be moist.

My whole family loved these. Served them as a main dish with "easy pancit" recipe on the side. Didn't have sesame oil, still great. Next time I may cheat to save time and purchase shredded cabbage (for cole slaw) and minced garlic in a jar. Lots of leftovers to freeze (if they make it that far).

These were awesome as is! They were a little gingery for me, but everyone else liked them just fine, so that's just a personal thing. It did take forever to make for me and my boyfriend, but it was fun.

These were delicious! Very time consuming putting them together but totally worth it! The only problem I had was that they all stuck together when steaming them. But they tasted great!

Loved these! Did change it a little.  I used hot italian sausage and only half of the sesame oil ( the brand I use seems to be very strong).  Well worth time to wrap them all. Def a keeper!

I used tofu instead of pork and they turned out really well!  Dipping them in some peanut sauce makes them twice as good maybe I'll just put a little peanut sauce in the wrapper before frying them.

This is one of my favorite recipes- easy to make and delicious, but they do take a little time.  Definitely worth it though.  I followed the instructions for freezing (see JENNYINHRE's recommendation), and this works great- so you can make extra, and get several meals out of one prep session.  the frozen dumplings taste as good as the fresh ones- just pull them from the freezer and steam for about 20 minutes. Even when frozen, they never last long at my house.

First time ever making dumplings, these were really good, i didnt expect them to come out restaurant style! Next time i make these I would add more soy sauce, the filling was a bit bland, but I think that had to do with the cabbage I used. I looked at reviews and next time I wont be adding any cabbage, it added too much of a crunch for my liking. This recipe is very time consuming, but fun to make =) will try with chicken next time! YUM!

Very good; but make sure that you know how to crimp the edges; I like them steamed; they need to lay in a single layer or else they stick together

Very good recipe. I usually add a bit of red pepper to make it spicier. I am not good with cooking these fresh, so I freeze them. I cook the filling, then cool, then fill my wrappers and freeze. This way I do not have to worry about cooking thoroughly when we take them out of the freezer. The meat is cooked so we only have to heat them. They are great for snacks for the kids. We live in another country now and cannot go to Trader Joe's and get their frozen dumplings. These taste almost just like them. We just take them out and pop them in the microwave. We are a bit strange though and enjoy that really chewy wrapper. :)

I made these with very few modifications. I like things a little spicier - so I added a teaspoon of siracha to the mix and wish I'd done a little more. Also, didn't have quite enough ground pork so I added some baby shrimp to the mix. I did not use wonton wrappers, my local Asian food store had Gyoza wrappers, which I like more. All in all, they were incredibly time consuming, but considering the cost of take out and the amount this made (plenty extra to go in my freezer) it was totally worth it. They were delicious.

My dumplings turned out very good!  For those who think it may be bland, remember, in our society, we're used to Asian inspired foods that have extremely unhealthy levels of sodium . . . I suggest adding more ginger and onion to it.  I also took some of the filling, added more onion and cabbage to it, "browned" it in a sauce pan with a tad more oil and soy sauce, and then just added several cups of water to let it cook as a mild broth for the dumplings.

Outstanding. This was the recipe I had been searching for. I used hot pork sausage and napa cabbage for the filling and they turned out phenomenal! I cut the recipe in half and froze what I didn't eat that day. Looking forward to dumplings whenever I get the urge.

The dumplings were good, but not good enough that it made up for the hours I spent making them and the days my kitchen stunk like cabbage. I thought the taste of cabbage was too strong and would recommend decreasing the amount. Still, it would be ok for someone who enjoys cooking and has hours to kill.

These are over the top. It was my first time making dumplings and I've made them at least 10 times since then. I followed the advise of other reviewers and added 1/2 teaspoon of salt for every cup of cabbage to draw out the moisture.  I let sit for 15 minutes than squezzed all of the water out of the cabbage. I omitted the egg as others suggested it wasn't necessary (it held together nicely). When cooking - first I placed a bit of oil in a non stick skillet. I place the dumpling in and cooked on medium heat until lightly browned. I added 1/4 cup water & covered skillet. Cooked for 7-8 minutes until water evaporated. (Optional- Removed top and let crisp up again.) Served with dipping sauce recommended by LeAnne from this site.  Well worth the effort.

this was definitely time consuming for me. ( i am a beginner though and i made my own wrapper taking up most of the time) but it was worth every second i didn't have any pork and used beef instead and they were still wonderful every one who tried them loved it was great

Wow I tripled this recipe and had no Idea what I was in for. This would have easily made over 300 wontons. However I gave up after 220 and just made meatballs after that. I threw some in with the fried rice I had. Next time I will cut back on the sesame, it was a little strong even though it was tasty. I might throw in some sort of other veggie in it next time, I think it just needs a little more than the meat.

Not bad.  I scaled down the recipe and used ground beef instead of pork.  I also bought egg roll wrappers and cut them into fourths because it was cheaper than buying the real wonton wrappers, even though they're made out of exactly the same thing.  The flavor is not exactly like restaurant dumplings or the frozen ones you buy at the Asian store, which I'm trying to duplicate, but these are still good.  To freeze them, I followed another reviewer's advice and put the dumplings on wax paper on a cookie sheet, not touching, and froze them until solid, then threw them in a ziploc bag.  The wax paper helps, because in the past I have had problems with them sticking to the tray or plastic wrap, but with the wax paper I had no trouble at all peeling them off.

Very easy to make. I didn't think they had much flavor so I added extra soy sauce and they were great.

Yummy, but so ugly I could not bear to serve them as is! Served them as soup with beef broth and more chopped green onion. I was glad I did that, as the broth also added some much-needed flavor.

My husband and I thought that these were quite good even though we are not big dumpling fans. Now if I can just find the perfect dipping sauce for them.

Modifications I made to the recipe: 1lb ground pork, one minced small onion, 3 minced garlic cloves, and 1/4 cup green onions (about 2 stalks). I pan fried some of them tonight and will be boiling the rest with mushrooms for a wonton soup tomorrow. It did take some time to fill it but it was worht it!! DELICIOUS!!

I liked these a lot. I had trouble freezing them to use later. They all stuck together and cooked up as one big blob. We used a citrus flavored soy sauce for dipping.

This recipe is AMAZING! My fiance and I spent an afternoon making these and we even doubled the recipe. We made half with ground pork and half with ground turkey and they both taste equally as good! We only steam about a dozen at a time and the rest we keep frozen for another night! This one will definitely stay in the recipe box!!! Thanks!!

These were so unbelievably good, I really couldn't believe I'd made them myself. Like another reviewer, I fried them in a little bit of oil (peanut), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Outstanding! Thanks so much, Lorna!

The stuffing was great.  Peeling the wonton wrappers from the stack was a challenge and took too much time.  Next time I will make the wrappers instead.  I will make this again.  Thanks
