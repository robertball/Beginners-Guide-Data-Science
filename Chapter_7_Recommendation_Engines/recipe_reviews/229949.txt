I made this for a chili cook-off and it tied for 1st place! I even used 3 cans of canned chicken, drained. I cooked the onion and garlic and chicken together in the olive oil, then added that and the rest of the ingredients to my crock-pot, following the directions at the end for adding the sour cream and whipping cream when the crock-pot was off.  Will make this again!

I made this yesterday in my crock pot. Put everything but the sour cream and cream in and let it simmer all day. I left the chicken breasts whole and pulled them out when I got home from work and shredded them, then returned them to the slow cooker with the last two ingredients. Only change I made as far as ingredients was using half and half instead of cream. I also sprinkled some fresh cilantro on top.  My husband took one bite and fairly squealed with joy.  This was easy and delicious. Best white chili ever!

My family gobbled this up tonight. It was fantastic. I did modify it just a bit. For starters I added onion, green pepper, minced garlic, chicken and olive oil to the pan and cooked for about 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, I drained the great northern beans ( I was afraid of soup like consistency instead of hearty chili) and corn. I also used Swanson's Mexican Tortilla Flavor Infused Broth ( includes flavors of monterey jack cheese, lime, cayenne pepper, cumin, toasted corn, jalapeno, and paprika). I put all ingredients into a crockpot and cooked on high for 2 hours. Once done I added just enough heavy whipping cream to give it that cream like texture without overbearing the rest of the flavors. I saved the sour cream for the side because my son dislikes sour cream. It is delicious with and without sour cream. I topped with cilantro, a sprinkle of monterey jack cheese, and served lime flavored tortillas on the side. This is my husbands new favorite chili recipe and mine as well. Thanks for a great recipe!

My family LOVED this recipe! I substituted pinto beans instead of the northern beans, added shredded cheese, and served with honey corbread ~ delish. Sorry, the photo I added is not the best but I would definitely recommend anyone trying this. Good luck! My vote is 5 stars.

Simple and tasty!  I used a cooked turkey breast from our deli, and did not add the cream.  I also used low fat sour cream to cut more calories.  I only used one can of green chilis, which was perfect for our family.  The mix of spices is wonderful and my husband raved about it.  Will be my White Chili recipe from now on.

This is a really yummy recipe! I made several changes including using a lb of ground chicken instead of using chicken chunks. I also mixed in a 1/2 lb of spicy chicken Italian sausage to add a little more flavor. I saw another poster who suggested adding a green bell pepper, so I substituted that for one of the cans of green chilis. And I added a bag of frozen white corn too because I love chunky chili, and I subbed chipotle pepper for the cayenne just to add a little more smokey flavor. And since I like my chili a little thicker than the consistency of the original recipe, I let the meat mixture simmer in my crock pot for about an hour and then added the corn, beans, milk, sour cream, and about 4 tablespoons of cornstarch and let it simmer for another 30 minutes or so. It thickened up perfectly. I served with a pan of homemade buttermilk cornbread...and this dinner was super yummy for me and my hubby! Perfect way to ring in the fall. :)

I just made this for my family. They thought it would be thicker and so did I. The flavor was great but we wanted a thicker chili consistency. It was more like soup. I followed the recipe to a T. When I saw the soupy texture I tried to thicken it. Didn't really do the trick. I will let it boil down a little next time and puree a couple cans of the beans with some broth. Needs some tweaking for our tastes.

i made changes...nothing drastic. i mashed one of the cans of great beans, i used almost a whole left-over roto chicken, only i can of the green chilies, sauted about a third of a cup sweet red bell pepper, a can with the liquid of sweet whole kernel white corn and then eye-balled the chicken stock needed to keep it from sticking while bringing it to a boil. left it on low after the boil for @ an hour. it was delicious. i added the sour cream and heavy cream to the indiviual bowls. i preferred it without the cream. excellent use for simple left-overs. i bet it would freeze excellent without the sour and heavy cream, which could be added after defrosting.

This was delicious and easy. I like that you don't have to have precooked chicken... saves a step. I added an extra can of beans, used fat-free sour cream, and subbed in evaporated milk for the cream, just to make it a little healthier. My whole family loved it! Served with grated cheddar and crushed tortilla chips. My kids told me it was amazing!

This recipe is sooo good!  It has such a wonderful, rich, full flavor.  My family wants it again tonight, you know.. one of those type recipes. I doubled this recipe b/c I have a big family.  After I cooked the chicken, onions & garlic, I put everything (not sour cream or whipping cream) in the crockpot on low.  After a couple of hours, I turned the crockpot off and added the sour cream & whipping cream & added a few potato flakes.  However, I don't really think the potato flakes were necessary.  But if you wanted it thicker (some reviews said it was too thin), then you could thicken it up to your liking w/the flakes.

My son made this recipe, and we all loved it! Just wanted more for leftovers, next time we will double it. He used half and half instead of heavy cream because thats all we had. Soup was a little thin I think, because of that. Next time I might try adding a bit of flour to thicken the soup. We all went back for seconds, will definitely be making this one again! Have been looking for a white bean chili, and I found it!

I did some changing: added 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 cup chicken broth vs. suggested, 1/2 C skim milk, green chiles on the side so it wasn't too spicy for the kids.  I browned the chicken in the garlic and onions with some chicken seasonings.  Then threw it into the crockpot with all the remaining ingredients and cooked on low for 3 hours. For toppers, shredded pepper jack and shredded cheddar (didn't use heavy cream or sour cream) it was fabulous

So delish!  Have made this twice now (in one weekend!) left out the whipping cream both times because I didn't have any and honestly didn't miss it nor it's calories.  Also, used pinto beans one of the times AND simmered it in my crockpot for several hours before adding sour cream! Easy peasy, I tell ya!

Im not really a fan of chilie but I live white sauces. When I saw this I thought I will try it. Im so glad I did it is hands down one of the best things I have made. I read in a review that someone made the white chilie for a chilie cookoff and it won first place. I can defferently believe that. I did use shreaded cheese I mixed in the sauce. I also added corn. Then made homemade corn bread for dipping. This recipe is worth  try!

Really good. I made mine in a crockpot. Sauted the onions, green chiles, and garlic in hot oil then added to crock pot with chicken. Allowed  chicken to cook and shredded it after about 4 hours. Added beans, chicken broth and dry seasonings/herbs. Cooked for a couple hours more on low for 2 hours and then added cream. Instead of whipping cream I added mexican crema. This is definitely a keeper. Yum. Topped it off with chili powder and shredded cheese to serve.

The sour cream and cream really killed it. It smelled amazing while cooking, but after adding the cream and sour cream, that is all it tasted like. Very soupy too. I might try this again without those ingredients. Look at the 5 star reviews! Half didn't follow the recipe.

This was a good base.  I don't eat meat (I'm okay with meat by-products and meat flavor though), so I left out the chicken and added turnips, parsnips, and cauliflower (all cut into decent sized wedges {what I would call "rustic chunks"}).  I had to add a little extra broth, cream, and seasonings to cook the veggies well and keep a good chili flavor.  I boiled until the veggies were nice and soft and I served it with the sour cream, guacamole and shredded cheese.  The family loved it, didn't miss the meat at all (the rest of the family are meat eaters and hate when I go vegetarian (or flexetarian in this case).  It was enjoyed all around!

Very good! I ended up cooking mine in a crock pot. Cooked the chicken in the broth for a few hours. Shredded the chicken and Then added everything else. I took a short cut and used dried minced onions and garlic powder. Also added another can of beans and shredded cheddar on top of each bowl. This is a very good recipe. I think you could add extra sour cream instead of the heavy cream if you didn't have any.

I just made this recipe and it was awesome, great alternative for regular chili, I did use only one can of the green chiles but bumped up the spices a little, used half and half instead of the cream and doubled the recipe  and am I glad I did. Everyone really liked it,and wondered why I've never made it before! I will definitely be making this one again.....

Have made this a couple of times, and we love it!  Quick, easy, and with ingredients that we always have on hand.  My only change is to reduce the salt by 50%.  Also, I have made with both canned and dried great northern beans.  Canned is quick, but my preference is to use the dried beans.  We serve with crusty french bread - great for dipping!

Don't mess around, just go ahead and make a triple batch!  I'ts that good!  I used rotisserie chicken and left out one can of green chilis just because I was afraid of the heat, and it worked well for us.  This is a wonderful recipe, and so easy.  I can't wait to make it again!

I made this last night and all I can say is WOW! It felt like a sin to eat alone. I did make some adjustments to suit what I had on hand. Instead of Cayenne pepper I used re Chili powder, used basil and rosemary instead of oregano, and I used ground turkey instead of chicken breast. It came out amazing. There is no chili like thickness which was fine with me. I will make this again. I might make my beans in the crock pot with the onions and fresh green chili. The aroma is enough to make you wanna just jump in the pot to go to town!

This was really good!  Previous reviews mentioned that it was too "soupy", but I found it was just right after adding the creams.  Excellent.  Will make this version from now on.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was absolutely delicious! Made it twice, once with ground chicken and once with cut up chicken. The ground chicken made it even better. Will definitely be making this again with the ground chicken. The whole family loved this one!

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years. It is so good. My family loves it. Today, I went with fat free sour cream and fat free half n half (instead of heavy whipping cream) to reduce the calories. It was still awesome!

I liked this recipe and my husband loved it. I didn't have sour cream or whipping cream so I substituted with 4oz. cream cheese and a cup of whole milk. Also, I used pinto and light kidney beans in place of Northern beans. I chose to do it in the crockpot instead of on the stove, probably for a total of 4-5 hours. It was yummy!

I really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again with a few variations though. I would shred the chicken, add corn and diced tomatoes and use regular whipping cream instead of heavy. I also think you could cut down on the cream and sour cream.

Great recipe, I made a few tweaks and it was great!! I had left over shredded chicken from street tacos so used that and the texture was great. I used one can black beans and 1 can northern beans and some frozen corn. I just like the color and taste better. I used light sour cream and no cream, just a bit of extra chicken stock to make the texture right at the end. I also put it all in crock pot since my chicken was cooked and put it on low for 2 hours and added the sour cream the last 30 mins. I added a bit more cumin and oregano too after tasting but super recipe!

I got this recipe about 17 years ago from my husband's boss' wife, and have been making it ever since. It is absolutely THE BEST white chili recipe ever. I take it to chili suppers all the time and the crock pot is always scraped clean and everyone wants the recipe. The key is the sour cream and heave cream at the end DO NOT leave those out!!!

My family of 6 loved it! The only regret was not having made a bigger portion than the default of 8 portions. 3 things done differently from the original but all 3 were suggestions from other reviews. 1. Shredded the meat from a store bought rotisserie chicken 2. Added 1 can of Sweet Corn Kernels 3. Used Half and Half in place of heavy cream. 

Very easy to prepare. This is an easy go-to recipe we'll be using again!

The only changes I made were to use half and half instead of heavy whipping cream, and I cut back on the cayenne, as several people in the group were very sensitive to heat. I was a little concerned, having grabbed the lowest sodium of everything, but it was phenomenal! I doubled the recipe and 7 adults who said they were "kinda full on snacks" devoured it.

I have been making this chili for over 30 years now and every time I make this everyone asks for the recipe.  Now, I do add at least one more can of beans to this along with another can of chopped green chilies.  My family likes this a little bit on the spicy side.  Serve this with a good crusty bread and some butter and you are in heaven.  My husband and I entered into a Chili contest and he made his traditional style chili and I made this one.  It was funny because I won First Place and he won Second Place!!  We serve this year round also.   Needless to say this will always be a keeper in the family cookbook.  Please note that this recipe comes out more like a soup consistency and not thick like traditional Chili.

Great tasting combination of spices, but the heavy cream/sour cream at the end seemed like overkill.  I added a little celery and some red and yellow peppers, diced fine, then tossed in a little cream of chicken soup.  Left the sour cream as an optional topping.

This chili was a huge hit with the BF. He demanded that I make more and stated that he could eat it everyday! Don't know about that but it's a great recipe. I used 2 cans of Cannelloni beans and one can of White beans and I felt that the chili tasted better everyday--it lasted three days in our household. I feel that the sour cream and cream added a nice dimension to the recipe but one or the other could probably be omitted. I also served with corn bread. 

I will be making this again and soon.

5 star plus!   I made this for a chili cook off and took 2nd out of about 30 chilis.   I cut the salt in half and smoked whole, skinned chickens instead of just using the breasts.   I cooked the onions, etc., in a pan as directed, but after that, I slow cooked everything else in a large roaster.   I made this recipe times 8.   That took 5 whole chickens.   I thought it was a bit runny, so prior to adding in the creams, I mixed up cornstarch with chicken broth (about 1 Tbsp per batch) and brought to a boil.   Then added in the creams.   Fantastic and I will be making again.

SOOOO yummy!!! I doubled the recipe. Used two defrosted chicken breasts and 2 frozen because I forgot to take extra out to defrost. I cooked this in a crock pot - chicken at the bottom, then chicken broth, rinsed beans (only had two cans of Great Northern, so also used 2 cans of pinto beans), green chilies, onions, garlic, and all seasonings. Cooked on high for 4 hours. About 3.5-4 hours, shredded chicken and added heavy whipping cream and sour cream. Had finely chopped cilantro, green onions, shredded cheddar cheese, and sour cream for toppings. It was seriously amazing! People who don't usually like white chicken chili tried it and really liked it too! Super delish with the cilantro topping!

Very good.  I doubled the recipe and eliminated the heavy cream and sour cream.  I let people put their own sour cream on top.  Also, to thicken it up a bit I added a rue to it - single batch use 4 Tbs butter and flour to make rue, for double batch use a full stick of buttter- 8TBS and 8 TBS flour.  I added at the end and blended it well.  Another option to try would be to sprinkle several TBS of flour over the chicken onion mixture before adding chicken stock.

One secret ingredient I add....not so secret now..add 1 teaspoon good unsweetened cocoa powder. Sounds odd, but makes it unbelievably gourmet. Trust me..be brave, do it! I also add 1 can new diced potatoes.  For events and parties I triple the recipe and it's enough to feed a hungry boys swim team ;)
AMAZING.  PICK THIS RECIPE

I made this recipe pretty much as is except that I parboiled the chicken first and shredded.  The soup is very flavorful and not overly creamy which I was worried about.  Definitely a keeper.

Really good base recipe. It lends itself well to being changed up. If you want it less soupy, use less broth. I also put in potatoes, carrots, corn, mushrooms,  and when I have them  green, red and orange peppers. Stirring in some chopped kale or spinach adds a healthy touch. Cumin is a must to give it that chili flavour. I've also made this in my Instant Pot, and for that, if using canned beans, put them in after cooking to keep them from getting mushy. If you need to thicken, use instant potato flakes...that works like a charm without changing the flavours. If using the Instant Pot, saute your onion, garlic, mushrooms and chicken together before adding in the stock and finishing the cooking. I then do 8-10 minutes pressure and switch it to slow cook mode for 30-60 minutes. If I'm hungry, the faster time works.

This was sooooo good! The basic recipe is fantastic! However I did change a few things. I used both chicken breast as well as boneless chicken thighs. I also made my Northern beans from scratch (soak overnight, boil down with onion, garlic, etc.)  instead of using the canned beans. I also used fresh Peppers instead of the canned green chilies. I used habanero peppers and long green hot peppers. My Supermarket was out of Chili Peppers. I could definitely see what one of the users said about it being soupy but I just let it boil down until some of the liquid evaporated. I paired this with black rice and garnished with cilantro. It was to die for! I will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe! I usually make it when I roast a whole chicken and have leftover already cooked meat. Just a few minor changes: I only use one can of green chiles and then toss in some bell pepper (I dice and freeze peppers from my own garden). Cannellini beans instead of Great Northern.  I sometimes cut back on the chicken broth if I want it a bit thicker.  And no cayenne pepper because my husband doesn't like pepper.  I saute the onion and garlic first and throw everything in the crockpot on low for the day. I don't add the whipping cream and just a spoonful of sour cream and shredded cheese on top of a bowlful. Nice to have dinner ready when I walk in the door.

I had ground turkey on hand so I exchanged that for the chicken.  I used 14oz of hot water with 2 cubes of chicken buillion.  I followed the rest of the recipe but left out the whipping cream or evaporated milk.  I considered adding corn but changed my mind because the liquid had simmered away.  I did not have a problem with consistency; actually it was thick and hearty.  If I were going to pour it over a noodle dish, i.e., orzo, ditalini, shells or other small pasta I would've added the evaporated milk because that's what I had in house.  We like our chili over pasta but I decided we didn't need it with this recipe.  I omitted the sour cream so that I could leave that decision to each person.  I did add sour cream, extra green chilies, cilantro and cheese to my dish ~ Exceollente'  A great, quick, easy to do, weeknight hearty meal.  The next time I make this dish I am going to make the cream corn/corn, sour cream & butter cornbread using the Jiffy corn bread mix.  That recipe is also delicious!

First let me explain that following a recipe and/or cooking of any kind has always been a challenge for me. Occasionally I’ll find a recipe with ingredients  that I’ve actually heard of. & steps that seem easy to follow,  however I normally mess it up somehow.  This chili is hands-down the most delicious thing I’ve ever made in my 45 years on this earth! It’s even more delicious reheated and I’ve actually won a chili cook off with this recipe. Who would’ve thought that I could EVER win a cooking.contest!?  I LOVE this chili and I make it year round!

This was very good!  No changes!  To those that say it is too “soupy” - you need to cook the beans down a bit and mash them a little. It thickens right up!

Definitely will make again!  Usually don’t care for white chili as it lacks flavor but this one is superb! Hubby said he liked it better than my usual red version. Added some cheese and sour cream on top! Yum! It will thicken up the longer you cook it. I don’t think the 30 minutes suggested is long enough . Let it cook till thick .

I doubled this but made no other changes, served it to a group and everybody loved it.  It's thick and creamy the way I like my cream soup.

I've tried a lot of different white chili recipes and this is by far the best of all. I followed the recipe except I poached my chicken in water, then shredded it and used the same pan for the soup. Also, I sautéed my onions in butter instead of olive oil. There is just nothing like the smell of onions cooking in butter. I added the sour cream and heavy cream when the soup was still on the fire and let it simmer a few minutes. This thickened it up nicely. This soup is wonderful and so easy. I like using the canned beans, so much less work. And the recipe isn't so huge that you are eating it for a week. It could easily be doubled for a family or for company. I will make this again and again. Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious! I took some advice from other reviews.
- use 1 lb ground chicken and almost 1 lb of Italian sweet turkey sausage
- added both chili powder and chiptole chili powder
- added more seasonings of everything
- added 1 can of creamed corn
- mixed 4 T of cornstarch with a 1/4 cup of chicken broth to thicken the chili then added it

Very flavorful.  I added low sodium broth and Better Than Bullion chicken flavor to it.  I decreased the green chilies to one can for the kids and actually forgot to add the cream and sour cream.  The pot was empty before I could add.

I made this for the first time last night for dinner.  I love the flavor of this chili.  I always make a dish exactly as given so I can give an honest opinion without a bunch of changes.  The only change I will make in the future is I will double the amount of beans.  That sounds like a lot, but otherwise this is more like a soup instead of a chili.  Still very delicious.  My husband loved it and said that he liked it better than some of the other chilies I have made.  I would definitely recommend trying this recipe.  Thanks for share it!!

ME LIKE! I took reviewer Barbara H-B's suggestion and made it in a crock pot. Placed  chicken breasts (raw and not cut up) and all the other ingredients (except sour cream and heavy cream) in crock pot . Cooked until chicken was done then shredded the chicken and put back. Half hour before serving added the sour cream and heavy cream and mixed it all up.  
Only other change was I used 1/2 the suggested cayenne because my family is wimpy when it comes to spice - even then it was still too spicy for them, but I would go with the full amount if it was up to me.

Hesitated for a long time to make a white chili. Afraid I would be disappointed and wish I made regular chili. But this was so good!!! I used chicken thighs just because they are more flavorful and breasts can tend to get dry in the crock pot. Added some green pepper and jalapeño. Also used half and half because that is what I had available.  Will make again!

This was excellent! I did make a few changes to the recipe to suit my taste more, but even had I not I’m sure it would’ve been fantastic. I used 1lb of ground chicken and also 2 links of chicken andouille sausage. I sautéed the onions and garlic w/ the chicken. Once that was done I put the chicken and the rest of the ingredients (chili pepper and chipotle for me instead of cayenne) together in the crockpot (sans creams until shortly before it was served!) and let it simmer all afternoon. Added the creams, stirred them in and served w/ a little cheddar melange on top... Delicious! My wife and I loved it, 100% will make again!

Weight Watchers folk!  If you use FF chicken broth and FF sour cream and do not use the whipping cream (I just used FF sour cream), this is a 1 point meal!  It's really yummy and very satisfying for 1 point!!

This recipe was very unique and I loved it.  I ended up opting for a heathier version, so I used Greek Yogurt/Milk (equal parts) in place of the  heavy cream, and Greek Yogurt in place of the sour cream.  It was slightly bland the way it was so I added some Southwest spice.  I also used bagged beans to save $ and already had them on hand, and will never do that again.  LOVED THIS, and will definitely make it again (gave 4 as had to add more spice and flavor)

This is a new favorite for us. You can make little changes to it without changing the entire recipe to fit everyones taste. It was thinner than we like so I took others advice and added some instant mashed potatoes to thicken it up. I added a can of diced jalapeños instead cause that’s what I had on hand. It was amazing and not to spicy for the rest of the family. I added extra peppers to my bowl cause I like heat and flavors of peppers. We added shredded cheese once it was served.  We all used a different kind of cheese of our liking.  We loved it.

This was a really impressive recipe. My nine-year-old enjoyed it thoroughly which is a hard thing to do. The only alteration I made when it was time to add the sour cream and cream I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch because it was too runny.It made it nice and thick. After taste testing at the end I decided to add a tablespoon fresh chopped cilantro. Everyone in the family enjoyed it only had a small amount for leftovers. We like  to eat it with crushed up tortilla chips. Instead of crackers. KEEPER??

I have been making this for years. I won 3rd prize in a chili cook-off with this recipe.
However, I do agree that it can be thin, like a soup. 
What I now do is I mash one of the cans of beans into a paste and stir it into the broth. It's still not thick like a regular beef chili, but it helps.
either way the taste is great!

I used thigh meat because that was what was on sale.  It tasted great.  This is a good recipe that is easy to prepare.  Mine did come out a little soupy but it did not take away from the virtues of this recipe.  I suppose if you want it thicker you could do a few things (add flour, crush some of the beans, etc) but I think it's already good.  Not all chilies need to come out like they were served from the can.  Thanks for this white chili recipe, I'll be making it again.

Too much sour cream for me. That's all I could taste. I reduced it by half and increase the cream. I also doubled the cumin. This was a better flavor for our crew.

Delicious although I was skeptical!  I threw all the ingredients as listed into my crockpot for 6 hours on low, then I turned it to warm and added the cream.  I didn't add the sour cream until I served it individually!

Very creamy, and delicious, slightly spicy. Changes: I left out the cayenne,  did 1/4 tsp pepper, 3/4 tsp salt, 1 can of green chilies, used half and half instead of cream,  and excluded the sour cream. Cooked in slow cooker on high for 3-4 hrs. Added half and half just before serving.

I made this this for dinner tonight with some leftover turkey breast instead of the  chicken and added a can of corn. I also popped a can of the beans into a blended as others suggested. Really delicious even my picky partner liked it. The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was still very watery and had thicken it with a little corn starch. Will absolutely make again!

I have found my keeper recipe here.  I have tried so many variations and nothing tasted as good as I  had once at a restaurant.  This recipe is better, but I  do feel you have to be a fan of sour cream to love it as much as I  do. For those who want a thicker soup, I  used a third can of beans and ran it through the blender, juice and all. Then add it to the soup and it comes out thicker. I also followed some reviews about doing it in a crockpot and don't  add the dairy unil the end. The only change i will make isn't  to improve the recipe because I  do feel it's  perfect, but for me, I'll  go another can of beans next time. I loved this. Thanks for sharing!

Very good flavor without making any changes. I put the uncooked chicken in the crockpot on low with the other ingredients and shredded it just before serving.  Don't add the cream products until you are ready to serve. If  you want it thicker, take out one cup of beans and mash them, then add them back. They will help thicken the broth.

Great flavor, I also expected it to be thicker. I added corn starch to more heavy whipping cream. Adding that helped the texture. We also topped with shredded mozzarella.

This was very tasty. I would use less green chiles. I also excluded the sour cream (only because my family hates it). Delicious!

Very good chili.  I use light sour cream and half n half.   Still tasty but not quite so rich. Using chopped jalepenos gives it a little more jump.     This  makes 8 'small' servings.   I need to double it to make enough for 5-6 people.

Delicious and probably very forgiving in terms of how we put it together. If we dice the chicken to 1/2 " then it sure doesn't take more than five minutes on medium high to cook it through. I really think the chicken should be cooked, dumped into broth and beans; then cook the onion, then the garlic, then the spices. If your loved ones don't like beans, purée one can rinsed and drained in the broth. I used canned stock. Finally it sure doesn't feed more than four in my family I but maybe five with all the beans. All that said its a keeper!

Excellent! The only thing I did differently was use light sour cream and instead of the heavy whipping cream I used half and half. Made for company and they all wanted the recipe.

We really like it. It's rich with the sour cram and cream. Will add a little less broth next time. It had more of a soup consistency.

My teenagers and the adults ate it all! My changes: one frozen or thawed uncooked breast per person in bottom of crock pot. Topped with spices, chopped veggies of your choice (peppers, onions, celery were mine). Covered with beans. Would use 1/2 cup of chicken broth only if using frozen breasts. Cooked on low for 4 hours. Added sour cream only at the end as per recipe. Omit the cream.

Used some of the bulk package chicken breast meat I had in my fridge that I had cooked in my slow cooker instead of raw chicken, otherwise I followed this to a T and it is an awesome dish.  Perfect comfort food for a blustery winter evening.  Made corn muffins as the side, easy meal.  I might throw in some corn next time and see how that goes.  This recipe is a keeper and will be a staple dish around here, thanks!

Recipe was totally enjoyable and tasty. Simple to assemble and I always keep all these ingredients on hand, made nice for a partly dreary day in Southern Oregon. I will have to say, it was very runny for a chili. I will make again but I think I'll leave the heavy whipping cream as I feel was the reason the chili was runny. My family really loved the recipe very much.

Very Good. Next time make a double batch so that we have leftovers! Made just as directed except I used 1 c. whipping cream (wanted to use up). I served shredded Mexican Blend Cheese & tortilla chips on top. Not that spicy.

PERFECTION!  We really loved this recipe--and I am not usually a white chili person.  This was really great and so easy--I just cooked the chicken and then threw it and all other ingredients into the crock pot for the day.  The aroma was insanely delicious and was tempting me all day long!!!  I will definitely make this again--THANK YOU!

I made this for 24 at a chili cook-off at a church event.  While I did not win, I received so many compliments on the chili.  The only thing I added was corn.  The flavor of the corn with the chicken/turkey really added to it.  Excellent recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Made it just as is except substituted 1/2 1/2 for the heavy cream. Made cornbread to go with it. Very tasty! This will become a regular in our household!

I honestly can't count the times I have made this recipe over the past year or so...it is hands down my favorite soup recipe I've ever tried.  I always double it  and freeze individual portions in Mason jars for easy and quick microwave lunches. And I usually use shredded chicken I already have cooked instead of cooking it in chunks. SO SO SO GOOD.

I made this last night in a combination crock pot/stove top cooker. The most time consuming part was dicing the chicken. This recipe is a breeze, and the flavors blend together beautifully. My only mistakes were that I added a container of frozen chicken broth that had more than the recipe called for, and I used the store brand of green chilies.They were extremely stalky. Go ahead and spring for the brand name green chilies. I plan on using this recipe for many years to come.

I made this for the first time for a work chili contest and won first place. It was definitely soupy like everyone else mentioned but the flavors were wonderful. I made it with minimal changes. Firstly, I quadrupled the recipe. I added jalapeno peppers and chili peppers for a really nice kick and I added assorted white beans and corn. I cooked it for an hour instead of a half hour.

For those who are complaining of it having a “soup like” consistency, make sure you’re either using “white bean chili beans” (which has some seasonings already added, but it also has a thick base to keep the chili from being over soupy) OR drain but do NOT RINSE whichever beans you choose. Beans are naturally starchy, so rinsing the beans before adding them means your chili won’t have its built-in thickener to get the chili consistency you want.

Super easy and surprisingly delicious. Thank you for sharing! I made some changes and used ground fat free turkey, added a can of cubed potatoes. I didn’t have cumin so I used Italian Seasoning.

Loved it! I've always been intimidated to make a soup w/ dairy in it. My guests enjoyed it and said it wasn't too spicy which is great knowing other guests can add more spice, if they choose, too! I'll definitely be making this again and maybe thicken it up a bit, but soooo yummy and easy to make! Thank you!

I didn’t change a thing except added a little more chicken broth that was left in the carton. This is very good but certainly not a light meal! I served it over some white rice with tortilla chips for dipping-really good.

Sensational taste.  I was expecting a thicker broth so will change it up for next time.  As is, adding the sour cream helped but not as I would have liked.

Tasty. If I make it again I'll use canellini beans instead and add celery with the onions. I also added the seasonings to the chicken before sauteeing.

Really great. Quick & easy—I just added some chopped bell pepper to the onions to give it some extra nutrition. I don’t think this recipes is 8 servings, more likely 6. But maybe we’re just pigs! Definitely will make again.

Good, solid recipe. Found it to be lacking a bit of flavor. I believe in actually reviewing the recipe as it is written and made. Next time, I will be adding things that I prefer. Very solid, easy weeknight meal, but lacking anything outstanding or great, in my opinion.

This is the best chili!! I didn't change any of the ingredients but I did use less of the chicken broth, about a cup total. I read the reviewers comments about it being too soupy and we like a thicker chili. I also added the heavy cream about thirty minutes before I turned off the heat,  to make my sauce a little thicker. I served it with corn chips. This is delicious!!!

I made this recipe, but with a few modifications.
1. I used dried Great Northern Beans that I had soaked overnight. Dried beans tend to hold up better than canned ones.
2. I used 2 fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped.
3. I used White Pepper instead of Cayenne.
4. I used a fresh purple scallion instead of a white onion, chopped.

The sour cream taste was too strong for me.  I tasted this before adding and it was good.  But the sour cream was overpowering in my opinion.  I made according to the recipe but I added some cheese and mushrooms and skipped the heavy cream.

I tried to cut back on the water/chicken broth as other reviews had mentioned but I also didn't want it to burn. It was the right consistency when cooking the chili but once the cream was added, it turned very soupy. If I try it again, I might just add the sour cream and skip the whipping cream.

This is OMG good!!!  I am known amongst friends and family for making outstanding soups, and I believe this is the best soup I've ever eaten.  I made it exactly per recipe but for omitting beans and increasing chicken due to low carb diet.

So good! I did make a few adjustments. I replaced one can of the great northern beans with a can of black beans and added a small can of diced jalapenos and a can of corn. For all of the canned items (aside from corn) I didn't drain the juice I just threw the whole can in the soup. I also doubled up the seasoning, added roughly 2 tablespoons of  green tabasco and shredded the chicken instead of cubing it. For toppings I used white onion, sour cream, cheese, cilantro and avocado along with crushed tortilla chips and a side of cornbread. Easily one of the best soups I've ever made. It was not very thick but it was still really good!

Best white chicken chili I’ve ever made, hands down! Don’t let any review tell you otherwise. Sauce was a little thin, but you can always remedy that without tweaking the recipe by adding crunched up tortilla chips and a bit of cheese. To all the haters out there, leave this one alone. If you want healthy, don’t start substituting this recipe and making it something it isn’t. Search for healthier white chili recipes instead of picking on this one. Can’t a recipe just be delicious without ridicule?

I would not call this a chili. Maybe a chowder? But it is tasty. I followed the recipe exactly. It’ll be back again, but I will add some things to it and cut some cream.

To make it vegetarian, I left out the chicken and used vegetable stock.  I sautéed mushrooms with the onions to give it more substance, and added corn for a little crunch.  Great recipe!  Will absolutely make again!

Really good and mostly heathy compared to regular chili. I added white corn (1 can) and topped it off with oyster crackers and shredded cheese. I cooked it in the crock pot and let it cook for hours. Super delicious. I didn’t make enough for our Halloween party and my guests let me know about it!  Next year I’ll make a double batch.

I typically double the beans to thicken it up; otherwise it's more soupy than chili.  Outstanding flavor.

This is my go-to recipe for white chili. Make it as called for and it will be a hit with everyone.  I like to add a bit more cayenne if I'm not serving a group--you never know what people consider "hot" which I don't feel this is at all.

THE BEST CHILI OUT THERE! 
I used actual green chili peppers and added paprika for an extra punch and corn and pinto beans to make it extra chunky. I also added some mashed potatoes that I had left over to make it more thick.

I thought I'd try this recipe as a change from my usual white chili.  This one is delicious!  I never follow a recipe exactly but the first time I make it, I try to stay close.  I prefer a smoky chili and the only change I made was dicing 4 strips of bacon and cooking them first and then cooking the chicken in the bacon grease.  I added the bacon bits toward the end.  Definitely not required as this recipe stands on it's own.  But it is a wonderful variant.

I made this chili for a cook-off at work.  Although a little runny it was winner winner chicken dinner.  I even added a few things (celery, more sour cream, garlic/onion powders and used two cans of Rotel instead of green chilies).  Grand prize was tickets to the Predators!

This is the best chicken chili I’ve had. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe said. Now when ever I make it I substitute the heavy whipping cream for half & half and use low fat sour cream (just to cut the amount of fat). I also take a 3rd can of beans and puree them and add it to make the chili thicker, which is a personal preference. I get a lot of compliments and asking for the recipe whenever I make a pot.

This is the best soup! 
I made this for an office party and we have a couple of vegetarians.   I substituted the chicken for chunky potatoes and kept everything the same and used vegetable broth.  That was a bigger hit than the chicken one!!  Even though they were both exactly the same!

I enjoyed making this dish and the taste was great. I worked up a traditional bag of dry beans. I used one brick of cream cheese to thicken it up.  Withhold the salt till the end to insure that the cooked beans will have softer outer shells.

This turned out amazing!! My husband doesn’t usually like white chili...after his first bite he said “Man this is awesome” so I’d say he liked it! I used 3 cans of chicken like previous reviews, added green pepper and some corn oh and a can of bushs southwest white beans. Soooo good will definitely make again!!

I've never been a big chili fan, but this is absolutely the best chili I've ever tasted! Followed the recipe closely. My only suggestion might be to cut down on the cayenne a little if you have somebody who's sensitive to hot spices. This will definitely be my go to recipe. Btw, try pouring it over cornbread for an extra treat.

Absolutely loved this recipe! Although I made a few alterations. I'm personally not a fan of hunks of meat. So I boiled and shredded the chicken breast. Since I feed 2 big young men and my husband I used extra meat and beans. I also used the broth from boiling the breasts that was seasoned and added it to the can of broth which made for about 3 cups. When I added the beans I took one can an pureed it. And of course being from Louisiana I added my own seasoning, will definitely make again! Family loooooooved it!

I used ground turkey and  butter beans (not the best choice but hey) because I had them on hand.  Also added a good dash of Ancho chili powder. Embarrassingly, I left it to cook down a Bit too long and burnt the bottom. But even with all of these changes/issues this was VERY good. Add that to quick and easy and it's definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

It got a ton of likes when I posted the final pic on my FB page. 
I used leftover turkey. Be conservative on the liquid recommendations . You can always add more. I used non fat yogurt instead of sour cream.

This is now a staple for us over the winter months. It NEVER goes to waste. I use low fat sour cream and fat-free Half & Half to cut down on fat calories. I use frozen chicken breasts and simmer them in about 16 ounces of salted water. I then use that water to make my broth and add chicken boullion to the liquid. You may want to cut out the salt in the recipe if you do this. This chili is AMAZING either way!

Hubby love ghost pepper, so 1/16th of a teaspoon was added in place of the cayenne.  Nothing else changed - it was gone in a heartbeat!  Quick, easy, and very satisfying.  Only negative was that he could not eat more.  Will double up next time!

Worth trying for dinner tonight! I've made it twice now in a month because it's so simple and delicious. It's a warm, hearty, creamy, and tasty dish and it's an instant favorite for my husband. So, will this be the most amazing thing to grace your palette? No, but the 5 stars is well deserved for something you don't see too often. Btw, we make this, watch Game of Thrones, and pretend we're eating whatever bowl to stew they are. This is better though.

This was fantastic! It is full of flavor and very easy to make. Especially on a very chilly night. I made it in my Dutch oven and also used ground turkey instead of the chicken breasts. It was more like a soup, next time I will cut down on the broth.

Wish I would have made a double batch, wanted to take some to work for lunch next day. Added more cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit, and a can of pintos. Think I will add some bell pepper and fresh jalapeños next time.

An excellent recipe.  I made a half recipe with leftover chicken.  Since the chicken was already cooked, I made appropriate changes to the recipe.  The only problem I had was that it could be a bit too bland.  In halving the recipe, I kept the original amounts of cumin, oregano, garlic, pepper, etc.    This was about right, but I think if would have been under flavored in the original recipe.  I also added some hot sauce at the table.

Excellent and a very easy recipe with perfect flavor. My boys are a bit on the picky/ timid spice side so I only used one 4oz can of diced green chillies and that was plenty. Also, to make a little healthier I used just a shot of whipping cream and substitute Greek yogurt in place of sour cream. Have made it without the creams and it’s still very creamy and excellent flavor so not sure that it’s even necessary but definitely adds a little something.

I agree that the chili was more souplike,however it was absolutely delicious. I would definitely make it again. It had just the right amount of heat and spices. I cooked the chicken for about 12 minutes and it was very tender. Next time I may even add shrimp.

Wow! Made this exactly as written and it was fantastic!  Served with fresh cilantro as garnish and a side of warm Jalapeno Cheddar Bread.  Agree with others, it wasn't as thick as I'd like so next time I'll probably add another can of beans, unrinsed and emulsified to help thicken it.  It was on the verge of being too spicy (and we love spicy foods) so I don't think an extra can of beans would take away from the flavor.  You can always make it spicier anyway.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe. Will be making it again and again! :)

Absolutely delicious! I have made this several times exactly as written. My husband loves it, but every time he says it’s a bit too “liquid-y”.  So, this last time I substituted the sour cream for about 3-4oz whipped cream cheese, similar to an asparagus potato soup recipe I have made. It worked! Thickened it up into a luxuriously creamy soup. Also like to top with shredded queso and cilantro, and sub one of the cans of great northern beans with cannellini beans for a bit of variety. The seasoning it perfect. A home run!

I have made this recipe several times. It is absolutely delicious! I always double the recipe so that my husband and I  have left overs. I made it once for a work function and it was a hit! My co-workers are still talking about this chili 2 years later.

Tasty, but didn't seem like a chili. Almost more of a chowder in my opinion. I may add cornstarch to thicken if I make this again.

We will def make again. My husband made it exactly as the recipe. He doubled everything. He browned the chicken pieces with the olive oil and onion and garlic on top of stove in skillet. Then he put everything into the Instant Pot on Stew. (19 min)  He then stirred in the sour cream and whipping cream. He may brown in the IP next time but wanted to see how quickly the sauté worked this time. Perfect recipe for those who love a bit of spice.

My family LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this. They never all like the same recipe but this one is outstanding. Thank you for sharing! I made the following minor alterations because my peeps like a bit of heat but not super-spicy: cut in half the black pepper, cayenne, and cumin. Used all other ingredients as recipe called for. I cut chicken into smaller sized bites because I don’t like bit chunks, and added it after onions and garlic were translucent. This way the chicken didn’t become dried out. For even nicer consistency and flavor, if you have time you can substitute dried beans for the canned beans as follows: Soak 1 1/2 cups dried beans overnight (or for a quick soak method, place beans in boiling water, then turn off water and let sit for one hour). Cook beans: Simmer 2 hours in chicken broth with aromatics (1 onion, 2 bay leaves, 5 peppercorns, 1 clove garlic). Strain beans (may want to reserve cooking liquid for another soup) and use in this recipe according to directions.

I followed the recipe as written.  Holy Cow...soo good.  My 17 year old said, “make sure I have that recipe when I move out!” .   And if you are lucky enough to have leftovers, I literally had about a cup left... even better the next day.   Thank you for putting this out there.  I will definitely double the recipe next time.

I followed the recipe but put all ingredients in the crock pot including uncooked chicken breasts, garlic and sliced onions cooking on low for about six hours. During the last hour, I added a can of hominy which adds a little more texture. My husband and I agreed that this was probably the best white chili we have had in quite a while.

This has become a favorite. we love it. i usually double the recipe so i can freeze some and have some for a couple of nights. i don't usually double the green chilies though and it's enough spice for us.

Love this chili recipe. I have never really been a tomato sauce person so am always looking for white sauce anything. Came across this recipe and decided to cook it in my crockpot to save me time. Awesome flavor. Will definitely make it more I. the future.

The absolute best creamy white chicken chili ever and my family loves it.  I made it for my church chili cookoff competition and it won first place!  The flavor is spectacular and is a repeat dinner choice for me to make for my family especially on a cold winter day.   I make it according to the recipe and serve it with some oyster crackers or cornbread to go with it.  But...If you expect a thick chili, you'll need to add some corn starch to thicken it as you want.

Delicious soup.  Added a little more cayenne pepper and an extra can of beans.  Husband prefers “more heat” in such recipes.  Great on those cold days with garden salad and garlic bread.

This was very tasty!  I had New Mexican chilis (12) that were roasted that I chopped up.  I used 1# dried beans with 2 T. Better than Bouillion Chicken and 16 c. water.  I cooked it covered for a couple hours, then uncovered to reduce until thick.  Major yum!

This is the best chili ever! I skip the sour cream and heavy cream altogether and add Greek yogurt instead. You can’t tell the difference and it’s way healthier. This is my go-to new mom or post surgery dinner to deliver. I double it all the time and there is never any left to freeze.

I double this recipe so we have leftovers. I have made this recipe exactly as stated, and I have found that it doesn’t need the heavy cream. So now I leave it out. I have also made this in the instant pot. When I do, I just reduce the liquid and add the sour cream at the end.

This is LICK THE BOWL YUMMY!! Even my 4 year old loves it (he can handle a little bit of kick). Made it for my entire immediate family and my parents and brothers raved about it-there were no leftovers from a doubled recipe for 5 people. They kept going back for more. One of my favorite dishes go make during winter. Make sure you top it with lots of cheese!

Delicious! Great for a cold, rainy evening.  The only changes I made were cooking chicken in a crockpot. I only used 1 can of chilis and whole milk instead of whipping cream.

Delish!!! I added a can of Mexican corn and mashed up the first can of northern beans. Also, I used rotisserie chicken. The only thing I would do different is heat it through after adding the cream and sour cream. I garnished with avocado and cilantro!!!

I have been making this forever it seems like. Such a family favorite! Using heavy whipping cream helps to thicken it up. You just have to let the "soup" part cook longer and it will thicken! I mix all the spices and chilis, broth and heavy whipping cream together and let it cook for a while before I add my chicken I've cooked. Some  people didn't use heavy whipping cream or substituted it for half and half, but you really need the heavy cream. As far as it only tasting like whipping cream and sour cream, add more spices! Eat it with tortilla chips and sourcream...that really is the BEST way to enjoy it!

I like it, very good recipe.  If you want it thicker (like I did) add some potato flakes, a little at a time, until it reaches your desired thickness.

My family loved it!  I did make some changes because of my families preferences. I didn’t add the chili peppers, cut the amount of cayenne pepper and cumin.  I also made a larger amount but didn’t measure anything. It was so yummy. Next time I will add a little more cayenne pepper and cumin. I don’t think my family will notice. We also added oyster crackers.

I was excited to try this. I used two cans of green chilis but used medium instead of mild to give it more of a pop of flavor. I had to add a cup more broth than the recipe called for because it seemed like it didn’t make a lot of soup for the two of us to eat. Even before adding more broth, it seemed so liquid-y, not a hearty, thicker  chili (the picture looks like this is a thick recipe). I ended up using some cornstarch to thicken it up. 
I thought the amount of spices would be too much but went with the recipe amounts, and even with the medium heat chilis, my husband, who doesn’t like spicy foods, said the chili was bland. I was shocked. 
I would probably make this again but doctor it up a bit, I might even omit the heavy cream and just use the sour cream. I’m no executive chef but I think all the dairy mellowed out the sass I was expecting from this chili.

Best chili I have made and tasted in over 40 years. Give it a try it’s so easy to make. Leftovers taste just as good heated up in a sauce pan for 10 minutes. I used two chicken breasts from a whole chicken I made a few days earlier.

It was good but too spicy for my kids. I added a can of corn and cut the broth down by a quarter. This gave a chunkier chili. If I made again I would cut the cayenne and cumin in half

Excellent!! I added white pepper too. Something about white pepper really gives it a smoothed off tast. I like adding in some cheese when serving.  Thanks for that idea. Everyone loves it. I’m making it for Family Christmas supper.

My adult son just went back for thirds. That is how good it was. I left out the cayenne because it was hot enough without it. A little too hot for my other half to eat his. Well, more for us :) Next time I will try to get chilies that are not as hot so my other half can eat too.

Nice spin on chili.  Used rotisserie chicken, fat-free half/half and sour cream.  Reduced both salt/pepper  to 1/8 tsp each figuring rotisserie chicken and broth contained enough salt and chilies would add enough heat.  Chili was good.

Seriously DELICIOUS and so easy. I used rotisserie chicken (precooked) and cooked in an Instant Pot on chili setting. Also, used Mexican oregano and decreased sour cream to 1/4 cups and replaced cream with 3/4 cup half and half and that was rich enough. This one’s a keeper.

Because it is quite thin with the broth, I used cream cheese instead of the cream. Very tasty. Second time I made it, Imade my own broth...tasty. Don't be afraid to use that cayenne pepper for a little spice. I also added frozen corn for a touch of sweetness.

Made exactly as recipe stated except I made 1.5 times the recipe because I had more people (4 adults, one child). The package of chicken I used was 2.5 lbs though, and I used 2.5 cans of 4 ounce chiles.

Flavor bursting.  Super easy and inexpensive to make.  I did add 1 can of hot diced green chilis along with the mild green chili, and just because I love Garbanzo beans, I added a can of that as well. I also added 1 tablespoon of butter with the olive oil to sautee the chicken, garlic and onion.  It made the best broth.

It was delicious. I made it in the crockpot. The house smelled amazing all day.  Used Half & Half  and plain yogurt because that’s what I had. Topped it with some white cheddar and avocado slices. Will make again.

I would totally make this dish again.  I made some small changes based on what I had.  Baked whole chicken legs, pulled them out before they were totally done, removed from the bone and sauteed in the onion and garlic.  I tripled the amount of cumin, doubled the pepper, salt, and oregano.  I used 8 cups of chicken stock and about 17 oz of canned chopped green chilies.  I only had about 1/2 cup of sour cream and I used 1 whole cup of whipping cream.  I used the original amount of cayenne pepper called for.  Cooking for a family of 4 including two teenagers, I had enough left over for everyone to bring some for lunch the next day.  Everyone loved it!

I will make this one again. I kept the recipe the same, just used can chicken, and I didn't add the garlic or the union, and for the northern beans, I used the northern beans mild chili flavor beans. I added all the ingredients to the chicken broth and brought it to a boil and then turned it down to simmer for about an hour, then I added the heavy whipping cream and the sour cream.

I toned down the spices a bit so my kids would eat it (they did not). But we really loved it. I basically made it as is besides the garlic (because I am too lazy to deal with it). Can't recommend this enough. It has replaced our previous favorite soup.

I made this for a family chili cookoff and it took second place.  I even got a call the next day for the recipe.  It was absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to make it again.  Great recipe!

I have never been a fan of white chilli. Was always bland and boring to me. But this recipe made me a huge fan!!! I used the ingrediants listed in the recipe but I never measure so I just kinda did my own thing. I did however add 1/4 cup of roasted corn and switched out the cream for half and half cause I didn't have any cream on hand. This chili was amazing!!! I only made a small amount the first time cause I expected to hate it like I do all white chilli. We loved it so much that I am remaking it for supper again tonite cause there were no leftovers and we really wanted more!!! I topped it with grated cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream and crushed tortilla chips from a bag. Wow it was soooooo good!!!! My family went crazy for it.

Used boneless, skinless chicken thighs for juicer, better textured meat. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Will do again.

This chili has really good flavor.  I do agree with the other reviewers that it's more of a chili soup as is.  I cooked up a double batch and added 2 table spoons of flour to my cream before adding, which thickened it up nicely.  I also served sour cream on the side rather than add it directly to the chili.  It is excellent with or without the sour cream.

I have made this twice, just in case the first time was a fluke!  Nope, it was delicious the 2nd time too!!  The only change I made is that I used Tabasco instead of cayenne power - mostly because I had Tabasco on hand.  I am taking it to a Chili Party...I think it will be a nice change from traditional tomato chili's.

This Chili was so good! As suggested by other reviews I doubled the recipe and was so glad I did. My husband was very skeptical about white chili as he had never heard of it. He loved it and could not believe how good it was. Will be making it again. I didn't really change anything just a little  tweaking on the spices! Yummy for my tummy!!!!

This was delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe suggested and we all loved it. Even my picky 14 year old son ate a bowl. 
We topped it with cheddar cheese after trying it plain and we loved it. We also tried tortilla strips and that was good too. I might try adding corn as someone suggested, along with tortilla strips and cilantro for a tortilla soup type recipe and see how that is.

I will definitely make this again.   The only changes I made were to use 1 1/2 lbs of chicken (That was two full breasts at my store.) and to use 3 cans of beans instead of the two.   I used the same amount of liquid and spices.  I made sure to NOT cover the chili while it simmered, so it cooked down nicely and was the perfect consistency when I added the cream and sour cream.  We served this with a fresh baked loaf of french bread.  Delicious!!

We absolutely LOVE this  recipe all year long. I have made it following the recipe  exactly and we still give it 5 stars.  I have changed it a bit (per our tastes) and now it's a 6 Star recipe LOL.  I add a can of drained corn and I use ground chicken. I omit the onion and only use half the amount of green chilies. One additional step I do is add shredded cheese at the end, while on low and stirring constantly, to thicken it up a bit. Perfection (for us). Pair this with garlic bread or focaccia  crackers, hell yeah! Delish!!!!

I can't believe this turned out so good! Pressed for time, needing dinner ready in less than 30 min, I cheated and used almost an entire 22 oz bag of frozen, diced grilled chicken. I sauteed my onion, then added the chilies (only had 1 can, darn)  and finally threw in the frozen chicken and 1 can of cannellini beans (only had 1). Mixed in an eyeballed amount of Better than Boullion chicken base into 16 oz of water and added spices to taste ( s&p, onion/garlic powders, a little chili powder, oregano, cumin, and dried cilantro). Simmered for 10-12 min and then added  about 1/4 bag of frozen corn to compensate for the lack of beans, 1/2 cup half-n-half  in lieu of  the heavy whipping cream and an entire 8 oz bag of shredded colby jack cheese. Mixed thoroughly  and stirred in a couple ladle-fulls of sour cream ( I eyeball everything!) Still wasn't quite the consistency I wanted, so used a bit of cornstarch slurry and it was perfect!  Served with crushed tortilla chips on top, it made for a quick, easy, and delicious dinner!  Next time, I would love to use  shredded chicken thighs in this and have the extra can of beans and chilies necessary. I did love the addition of the frozen corn as well, so I'll keep that in there for my version.

Added about a cup of frozen corn. Best to make the night before so you can refrigerate and allow the chili to thicken.

The only change I made to this recipe was adding flour to thicken it up a little more to my tastes.  I added 1/8 cup of flour at a time.  The second 1/8 was still a little thin, and the third 1/8 made it a *smidge* thicker than what I was going for, but it works.  This is absolutely delicious, simple to make, and was perfect for a cold, snowy, day!

This is a very good recipe. I added some avocado, green onions, and cheese in the bowls. Loved it! If you want it thick, be prepared to let it simmer... as with any soup/chili recipe. Very good way to begin fall weather!

I normally do not eat chili, but this is the exception. Instead of adding the heavy cream, I add shredded Monterey Jack cheese at the end, along with sour cream...It's a hit with everyone!

I just finished making this chili.  Some reviewers stated they were hoping for a thicker chili.  I wanted a thick chili too.  I followed the recipe as written with one exception - I added 1 1/2 TBS of cornstarch to the chicken broth before adding to the chicken, onion and garlic in the saucepan.  The chili was absolutely delicious and adding the cornstarch gave me the thickness I wanted.

I used thighs instead of breasts and milk instead of heavy whipping cream  I also added a can of corn and some sliced mushrooms. It was so good and had many compliments on it. One friend even asked for the recipe. Will definitely be making again!

Boasting great flavors!! We add parsnips to this as well, and scale way back on the dairy due to personal preference.  Definitely try this recipe as written, and then modify where you feel fit in the future!!

This was the easiest most delicious tasting white chili. Never had white chili before and being as a first timer surprised how tasty it was. Definitely a keeper and there was no leftovers!

I liked this but my husband didn't. I couldn't use the cayenne as my husband cannot handle heat so I used some chipotle chili powder instead.

I never give reviews on recipes but I loved this so much! I didn't change a thing and it was the best chili I've ever had. This will for sure be a new favorite for our home :)

I made this exactly as the recipe says. It is a huge hit with our friends and family! The only person that doesn't like it is my 6-year-old daughter. She thinks it is too spicy. It is mildly spicy due to the cayenne pepper. This is an awesome recipe!

Made this with a few minor adjustments, added 1 extra can of beans, a can of corn, and used a can of chipotle peppers instead of chili peppers for a pinch of extra heat. Definitely a keeper recipe...

This chili is amazing! My husband is not a chili fan and he requests this for dinner quite often. I like to add corn to it and use rotisserie chicken as well. Always a great meal!

I doubled this recipe. It was too soup like in it’s consistency so I let it boil for about 30 minutes, then turned down the heat to a simmer and added the heavy cream and sour cream. I only added 2 cans of green chilies and accidentally added 1 teaspoon more of pepper than called for. I was able to scoop out most of it but certainly there was more than the recipe called for in it! Lol However, it turned out perfectly for my family as they like spicy, so all’s well that ends well right?

I made this with tofu instead of chicken (not because I'm a vegetarian--I'm just sick of chicken lately). Anyway, it was delicious! I cut the cayenne  in half so the kids wouldn't complain about it being too spicy. It had just a touch of heat. They loved it and so did I.  Also, it's a nice, easy recipe.

Great recipe! The second time I didn't change anything, except I did throw in some pepperjack cheese I had at the very end which added a little heat and another layer of flavor. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is so good and easy. I used pre-cooked chicken (Tyson) and added it to the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes and added everything to the crockpot. I did add about a cup of frozen corn and only added one can of green chiles (my parents were over for dinner and don't like a lot of spice). I cooked on low for 4 hours and then removed and added whipping cream. I laid out the sour cream, Mexican cheese and tortilla chips for topping. I will definitely make this often!

I made this in the crock pot. I added the beans, all seasonings, and one large chicken breast, and left it on low all day, adding water to keep beans covered as needed. Then I shredded up the chicken breast, added the sour cream and half and half. It was not runny because I shredded chicken breast I think. I did have to increase the amount of spices though. It was good, made a lot, and I would make again.

Super Yummy!  I slow cooked white northern beans all day with broth, bacon, onions, celery, bell pepper, green chili, rotel, garlic (whole and minced) and shredded carrots.  (and spices)

Then I added the shredded rotisserie chicken, sour cream, heavy cream.  Served with monterey cheese , cilantro, crushed chips.  

It was a huge hit.. forgot to take a pic!

I agree with all the great reviews ... this is great!  I always hate it when someone says 'the only thing I changed was ...' , but I did make it for the Instant Pot rather than on the stove top.  Did not change any ingredients and the taste is spot on.  The biggest thing I did differently was to leave the chicken breasts whole and then shred once they had cooked in the Instant Pot.  I may never go back to beef chili again ... Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

3 4 18 ... 'Liked this.  Yes, thinner than I'd like, but still good.  I subbed precooked- aka leftover ;D - chicken.  'A little hotter than mild spice using chiles labeled "medium."  With minimal liquid, I could see this being good on nachos.  Ahhh, nachos.  :)

I didn’t have any great northern beans or white beans so I used 1 can light red kidney beans and 1 can pinto beans and it was still quite good

Made this many times now so I thought I should rate it.   Even the picky eaters in my family enjoy this.   My mom, who is the pickiest has even served it at a luncheon with a salad and garlic bread with rave reviews.   That speaks volumes!

I’ve made this recipe several times since I first found it! I’ve mostly done it in the crockpot while I’m at work, but I’ve also done it on the stove when I’ve had less time. I recently tried adding white corn and small golden potatoes to make it heartier. It can be a little soupy so I add about half the stock. Once I add the sour cream and heavy cream it is perfect. My whole family LOVES this recipe!

Here are the tweaks I made. Only used one can of chiles. Used homemade chicken broth. Made it in the slow cooker. Skipped the whipping cream and added Monterrey jack cheese. We really liked it.

My family loves this chili. The only change I made is i simmered the chicken breast covered in finely chopped onion, garlic, onion & bell pepper with cummin to season over night in the crock pot. I followed the recipe after that.

Outstanding.  Made according to directions except I sautéed the onions and garlic, then added shredded poached chicken meat I had made another day and froze.  Let the chicken thaw and added... followed the rest of the recipe as published from there.    Also freezes great.

I made this with a few adds: corn and diced tomatoes (drained).  I cut back on the cayenne and the green chilis because I hyper sensitive to spicy food.  I topped off with cheese and avocados, and it was great!  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I was most happy because it only takes an hour to prep and cook...win-win.

This chili was very tasty. We expected it to be quite spicy with the green chiles, but the dairy really toned the spice down.  A little extra green chile or cayenne would be ok if you like spice, as we do. I know someone else who made this recipe using extra sour cream, but I thought it lost the other flavors, so I will stick with just a cup. Not everyone in our group wanted chicken, so we browned it in a pan and kept it separate for self-serving. We also used vegetable broth. It was easy to make, and we enjoyed the change of the white beans from black & pinto.

I followed the recipe to a T x2.  (Upon completion, rather than do my own thing  to it ) we tried it and it was good!  I think the next time I will cut the sour cream by half, or use it as a garnish, it was a  little too much for my taste.  I only had the 2 cans of chilies on hand, which still made for a flavor burst on the doubled recipe.  This one is going into the work place competition!  Thanks!

My entire family of 5 LOVES this chili! It's rare to find a recipe that everyone likes so this one is a keeper! I will definitely make this again and again. I did add a bit more cayenne pepper to give it a bit more kick but otherwise I stuck to the same ingredients in the recipe.

14 degrees outside right now--I made this tonight for the second (third?) time. Can't recall if I used full fat cream before, but I DO know it was delicious or I wouldn't have saved it to my Favorites. And I never use full fat sour cream so saved some calories/fat there. Anyway, used 1/2 & 1/2 tonight and yeah--so, so, SO delicious! Easy. Try it. Love it.

I only made one change and it was such an awesome swap up that I had to share... instead of chicken I used shrimp.  OMG!  this is seriously a great chili!  I did have to add a rue to get it a bit creamier, but everything else was the same.  Absolutely awesome.

So good! I loved this and can not wait to make it again. My changes were only to use less of some ingredients (only half an onion, 1+1/2 cans of green chiles, slightly less black pepper, and only 1/2 C of sour cream bc I was afraid after adding it that 1 C would be too much). It was still spicy but someone with a low spice tolerance at my house was still able to eat it and liked it. We had to make an effort to stop ourselves from eating it all the first night!

I really like this chili.  As noted in some reviews it is not a thick consistency but what makes a dish a chili is adding chili peppers not the thickness.  I cooked it in my crock pot, shredded the chicken and added more salt.  I would recommend this recipe.

I made this to bring into work for some my guys.  Pretty much followed the ingredients of the recipes but  used fresh chicken breasts, fresh Serrano peppers, and dried beans cooked in the broth and spices (also added cilantro and rosemary) overnight in the crock pot.  I added the sour cream and heavy cream in morning and took it in the next day.  I figured the cream would neutralize the Serrano hotness, but it survived to give the chili just enough kick for people to know they were in there.  The consistency came out like  a thick clam chowder.  Needless to say it was a success and a surprise since no one had heard of a white chili :).

This is great! I had some ground chicken so browned that with the onion and garlic. I used 3 cans of beans - great northern, kidney and garbanzo. The rest of the ingredients I used as listed and it was very good. I will make it again the same way.

This chili was not super thick (like the picture), but that didn't bother us at all. We couldn't find green chiles, so we used some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (only a few) and it was great. You could add more if you like more heat. (Also, I always double or triple the garlic in any recipe!)

I did love it - very flavorful and it was pretty easy to make.  However, I must have done something wrong because it was very soupy.    Any suggestions?

This recipe had a lot more flavor than I expected. It was very good and very easy to make. I severed it with a drizzle of cayenne olive oil on top, fresh parsley and a side of garlic toast. No doubt I will make it again.

OMG, this is AMAZING...adding cheese to your bowl will thicken it, but at first it has a consistency of soup, but the cheese made it perfect , IMO :)
There's a lot you can do to make it to your own liking if you wish...
Excellent recipe!

Although my husband liked it, it was so spicy hot that I could not finish mine.  If I make it again, I will tone it down a bit.

I have made this several times with slight modifications. The first time I made it, it won a chili cook off with 15- 20 great entries. 
I prefer chili to be thicker consistency, so I reduced how much broth I put in by about an 1/8th. Then I add about 3/4 cup of crushed tortilla chips as a thickener. You can use corn or flour depending on your dietary needs. It takes simmering for 30+ minutes for the chips to dissolve into a smooth texture (the longer the better). Test it before serving, you don't want your creamy soup to be mealy.
I tried the hint of lime tortilla chips as an experiment once. It was still tasty, but much better without the lime chips. 
When short on time, I have used the Costco rotisserie chicken. I prefer my sauteed onions and cubed chicken, the flavor and chicken texture is better.

This was absolutely amazing! I didn't make any changes to the recipe, just made it as written and I'm so glad I did! The only thing I'm sad about is that I didn't double the recipe because my family of four ate the whole pot up and there's none for leftovers!

I followed the recipe to a t, except I only had 1/2 cup of sour cream on hand & used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the cream.  Next time I think I'll just add a cup of milk, it ended up being too rich for us.  Other than that it was excellent, had really great flavor & smelled amazing while it was simmering!

In LOVE!

I had never had white chili before and have no idea what in the world made me want to make this, but this recipe sure is tasty!  My husband had 2 bowls and my oldest son had 3.  I doubled the recipe and hardly had any left over.  

The only thing that I will do differently next time is add a little more spice.  My husband thought it should be spicier.

Loved this recipe. As most people do, I made a few changes based on availability and preferences. I used two cans of great northern beans and added a can of cannelloni beans. I used cubed chicken tenderloins and also added about 1/2 teaspoon of Southwest Seasoning from Penzey's. It added a really great flavor. I also took the opportunity to add about four frozen Hatch chilis, but will use eight next time. Will put this recipe into regular cool-weather rotation.

Loved this chili.  I used Rotel with green chilis and pepper jack cheese and some half and half to cream it up.  It could have easily used a can of corn too.  This will be one of those soups I end up making about once a month in the winter.  Wonderful!

The best. Substituting milk for the cream and low fat sour cream worked great and made this very weight watchers friendly. This recipe converted me into a white chili super fan.

Initial batch was made exactly as written. For me it was a little bland and soupy. Second time I made it I changed/added several things. Doubled the recipe and made in enameled Dutch oven. Browned cubed chicken thighs, set aside when mostly done. Added maybe 2 tbs veggie oil to pan then sauteed onions till slightly carmelized and the fond released from bottom of pan, then added chicken and garlic for last two minutes. Only thing I didn't double was the cayenne, only added another 1/8 tsp. Things I added: 1 chipotle in adobe sauce, somewhere between 1/4 - 1/2 tsp chili powder, about 3/4 cup frozen corn. Took one can of the beans and pureed it to use as a thickened. Then covered the pan and cooked in oven for maybe 4-5 hours at 275. Took lid off for last 30. Then added the cream and half and half.  Top it all off with diced avocados, fresh squeezed slice of lime and sprinkling of chiliI lime powder. Liked this much better, though next time 2 Chipotle and maybe double the cayenne.

This was delicious! I'm not the best cook and this was easy enough for even me! My only changes were, I salted and peppered the chicken on both sides before cutting it up and at the very end, I added two cups of shredded pepper jack cheese.  I will certainly make this again! Soon!

made it last weekend, my new favorite white chili.  To anyone who says it is too watery you can reduce it for a bit to cook out some of the liquid.  Also don't skip the cream.  I made it as is on the recipe.

This recipe was very good. I made a mistake and bought heavy cream instead of heavy whipping cream but it was still very good.

My husband can't tolerate anything spicy so I did modify. I had S & W seasoned white beans and one can that was seasoned with mild jalapeno. I only used a heaping tablespoon of the green chile peppers.  I made it again for a pot luck and it went over very well. This is one of my favorite recipes!

Perfect blend of spices!  I only used one can of chilis (my preference) and it gave it the perfect kick.  I'm not a bean eater so only used one can the first time but actually missed the white beans.  Added two the next time I made it.  Perfect soup for a cold day.  Have shared it with others and plan to make it for our work soup cook-off in January!

I was searching for a good recipe to use smoked pheasant (instead of chicken), and this was fantastic. I also pureed a third can of beans to thicken, and reduced the dairy by half. Outstanding.

Great flavor! Since I have a few picky eaters- I had each person add (or not) the sour cream & heavy cream to their individual bowls.  Also had jalapeños, bacon crumbles, shredded cheeses, cilantro & hot sauce for garnish!  Success all around!!

I used a family bone in chicken pack from TJ’s that was frozen. I covered the chicken with water in the crock pot and added about a tbl of pink salt. Cooked on low overnight about 8 hrs. Pulled the chicken out and deboned then added the bones back in to make bone broth. I doubled the recipe and used a can of coconut cream and Monterey Jack cheese to thicken. Turned out great! The chicken was so tender and I had 3 1/2 jars bone broth left to freeze for another recipe! Had quite a kick with great flavor!

Wowza! This was so delicious that I had to stop myself from eating a 3rd bowl!

I used chicken thighs since I already had some at home, and used low fat sour cream instead of regular, and it was amazing! As others have said, the consistency is more like a soup, but that doesn't take away from the full flavor of this meal. I've added this to my winter rotation and can't wait to make it again. 

Don't hesitate to make it - this dish truly lives up to the hype!

This was good, but not over the top.  It was much more 'soup-like' than what I thought it would be by looking at the picture.  I did end up adding some cornstarch to thicken it up a bit and next time I think I will follow another reviewer's suggestion and blend up some of the beans to give a thicker texture.  Overall, this had good flavor and will probably make again but will do some tweaking to get it more like chili.

Awesome! The best soup I have ever made. The only change I made was that I used roughly half the amount of sour cream to save on calories. I will absolutely make this again. Super easy and the family loved it.

Terrific flavor & the sour cream & heavy whipping cream toned down the heat of the green chilies. I also added small diced canned potatoes & frozen corn to make it more hearty as my husband likes chunky type chili's. Just a wee bit too thin & soup-y for our taste, think I'll add only 1/2 the suggested chicken broth next time, and perhaps a tablespoon or so of cornstarch.
Thank you for the recipe. A dinner I'll make again for sure!

I made the following adjustments and it was a gigantic hit. No cream. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, trust me on this one, it does something fantastic to the cumin. I added a tablespoon of dry sherry, to give the beans some depth. Salt to taste, beans rarely taste great without it. Added a half cup green salsa. Topped with shredded Mexican cheese.

This was a hit!  I used precooked & seasoned chicken, saving some time.  I did add some seeded chopped tomato and 1T fresh lime juice.  Substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream, and used reduced fat sour cream.  Garnished with a little shredded sharp cheddar and a bit of cilantro.  Served with warm tortilla chips.  This is definitely going into my rotation.  Next time I might add chopped tomatillo as well.

All ages in the family loved this & it’s simple to make. Even without a long cooking duration, the flavors blended together well and it tasted great. I used light sour cream to save calories.

I used chicken thighs, removed excess fat and chopped them up and sautéed them along with onions and jarred minced garlic in my Instapot. I added the other ingredients and switched the Instapot to slow cooker mode and let it run for 6 hours. I used great northern beans and I crush up one of the cans after rinsing them both.

This was absolutely fantastic!  My husband and I made it exactly as written, with the exception of leaving out the green chilies, as I have a sensitive stomach.  This white chili was so good that we ate it all in one night.  Next time, we will double the ingredients so we can have leftovers the next day.  As written, there is just enough for two people to have small seconds on the first night.  We want it for two nights with seconds!  Yummy!

It was delicious! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because it wasn't thick like a chili should be. However, now that I know that the next time I make it, I would add a little flour to thicken. Overall, it was a very tasty and flavorful recipe

This was a great recipe: comes together quickly and easily and my kids really enjoyed it. I made it as-is except I substituted white kidney beans as I couldn't find the type called for in the recipe.

I made this recipe today the only thing I did differently was I left of the cayenne pepper and added corn to it. I have 2 small kids and they love corn and I was afraid the cayenne pepper would be too hot for them. Loved it so much will definitely be making again!

Made this just now, it is excellent!!! Low carb too! Great taste. I did leave out the cayenne pepper.  I will definitely be making this often, especially for a work pot luck. I'm a picky eater so hands down to this recipe, excellent!

I threw this together last night for a chili cookoff at church this morning and did not have time to read any reviews ahead of time.  The only change I made was to use 1 lb. of roaster chicken meat instead of cooking raw chicken.  The chili was delicious, and it won the cookoff!  In the future, I may experiment with adding some additional veggies.

We really enjoyed this version of a white chili.  The flavors were great!  I did not alter the ingredients in the recipe but did add a chopped 1/2 yellow pepper I wanted to use up.  Also just to give just a tad more thickness (thought it was a bit soupy after adding sour cream and heavy cream) I mixed a tablespoon of cornstarch with a tiny more cream and stirred it in for a couple minutes.  Served it with homemade cheesy bread sticks.  Great for chilly evenings!  I will make this again.

I added 4 oz can of diced jalapenos, extra beans, cumin seed and used lite half and half.  I didn't add the sour cream and half and half until  I dished up the serving bowls. This heats up beautifully and I've had nothing but rave reviews!!!

This is SO good! I made it in my crockpot. I used rotisserie chicken put the sour cream and whipping cream at the end. This is probably the best soup I ever made! Can’t wait to make this for the family when we are snowed in!

I made the following changes and it was just ok. I  boiled and then shredded the chicken and cooked with the onion and garlic in the pan. I prefer shredded rather than cubed. I also added corn and an additional can of beans. Other than that I made the recipe exactly as written. It was really bland to me. I did use mild peppers and maybe that was my mistake. After it was done, I had to dump more cayenne, cumin and then added some chili powder just for it to have some flavor. Can't believe this won several contests. It is good with the changes I made but I wouldn't call it an award winner.

I only used one can of green chillies and it was plenty spicy. I also added some corn starch. The Fibers of Love group gave it a thumbs up.

We really liked this chili, even better the next day when the flavors combined more, however I did have to thicken the sauce with Arrowroot to give it a more  consistency.

I stayed pretty close to the recipe technique  but had to change  some of the ingredients because  they weren't available in my pantry. I used  one can of  great Northern beans, 1 can of pinto beans and one can of whole kernel corn, all of which were drained. And  I  used Greek yogurt instead of  heavy cream. So, what I ended up with was Calico Chili, and it was a big hit. My wife and I had it for supper the first night And with a dinner guest two night's later. I served it with big, home made corn muffins and he went back for  seconds on both. The recipe is a keeper.

Awesome - - followed the recipe with a couple exceptions -  that was adding a can of Ro Tel (didn't have just green chiles) and a can of corn.  After reading that many made it and it turned out more of a soup, I took a can of the beans and pureed them.  Really thickened it up.  I also didn't have any sour cream so I made a substitute from Greek Yogurt, Apple Cider Vinegar, Lime Juice, Salt & Pepper.  I  also added  half a brick of Monterrey Jack cheese.  Excellent!

My family LOVES this recipe, and so do I! Many times a "white chicken chili" recipe is very thin and watery--but in this recipe, the cream and sour cream thicken it up. I consistently leave off the cayenne pepper, as that's too spicy for me. Otherwise, no changes necessary!

This is so good! Made it twice so far. Did have to add more broth as I used a whole roasted chicken. This recipe is easily modified to individual tastes such as how spicy, or more garlic, etc. My family likes it as written.

Made it exact and Loved it. Way better than beef chili. A slight warming seeps in after you stop eating. It's like a bonus. I topped with shredded cheddar jack.

loved the flavors, but as others had commented,it was a bit more  like soup, when I make this again,which I will, I will add more northern beans,and possibly some diced white potatoes. easy enough to make,and does not take very long.

This was really tasty. To save on fat and calories, I used 1/2 cup of sour cream and a 1/2 cup of 2% milk. I bet it's insanely good using the original recipe though. I also blended one of the cans of beans, made it nice and thick.

Wow! I made it as per the recipe except I used the entire 13 ounce can of chopped chili peppers versus 2 four ounce cans. My other half thought it was too spicy, for me it was perfect. Yes, it's like a soup, and we actually really liked it that way. In addition to the deliciousness it provided as a meal on it's own, we made scrambled eggs and put in a few ladles of the chili, minus most of the liquid (slotted spoon). Holy cow that was good!  I will next time try making it with either half and half or even the fat-free half and half, and maybe low fat sour cream. If that works, I'll be making this a lot.

Best white chili recipe out there. Originally saw this recipe on Taste Of Home.  Sometimes I amp the heat by using Serrano or jalapeño peppers. Even better the next day!

I have been making this same recipe for years,  my husband and I love it. I pretty much follow the recipe for the most part. Sometimes I may add more sour cream to thicken it up a bit more but other that that, this recipe is perfect!

I doubled the quantity, increasing amount of cayenne pepper and cumin because I like more of them than most recipes indicate.  Definitely will make again.  It's great!!

Used thighs and drumsticks (skin removed) Threw everything in the slow cooker other than the cream and sour cream.  Added the cream after about six hours and served the sour cream separately.  I am a veggie but my meat eaters yummed it all up serviced with cheesy garlic bread and Delia's rice

Quick simple recipe.  I made it in the crockpot with whole chicken breasts, like another reader suggested.  I used chicken broth seasoning, not liquid,  as I wanted to keep it quite thick.  At the end of the cooking time, I shredded the chicken and added a little water to make it the consistency I wanted.  It was a big hit with the whole family.

This recipe hit the spot on a cool Autumn evening. Easy to make and ready in an hour. I didn't change anything...perhaps a bit more chicken than called for. Topped it with shredded cheese, green tobacco and some toasted garlic bread for dipping. Perfect and delicious!!!

I think adding the heaven cream made it taste more like a stroganoff, better the second day when I put it over some fettuccine. Not my favorite.

Oh my goodness. It's my new favorite soup! In freaking love!! Only thing I had to change because I didn't have enough sour cream on hand, was I substituted Greek yogurt. I also cooked it in the Crock-Pot on low for 4 or 5 hours and then added the sour cream and heavy whipping cream at the end. Amazing!!!

Easily doubles.  Do chop chicken in 1/2”cubes, as recipe reads, or shred by hand.  Substituted about half of the green chilies with fire roasted green chilies and it really added to the depth of flavor and not too hot.  Strongly recommend doing that.  This recipe is a keeper,

After reading several reviews for this chili, I was prepared for it to be more soup-like and not so thick, so I had a plan to thicken it even before starting to cook. I also knew I wanted to kick up the heat because there didn't seem to be anything spicy in the recipe. I diced up a red pepper and used two ears of fresh corn and cooked that with the onion and garlic and chicken (1 3/4 lb. vs. the the 1 lb. called for). I added 2 ounces of canned jalapeños in addition to the green chilis. And I added a third can of beans (a small can) at the end when I decided I still wanted more thickness. I used a box of broth, which contained about a cup more than the recipe called for, so that also created a need for all my thickening tricks. Lastly, I added approximately 3 tablespoons of flour to REALLY complete my chili and a dash more of all the spices called for. The final result was an  AWESOME thick, well-rounded creamy chili with a nice kick, perfect for the approaching fall chill. My advice: use the recipe as a guideline, add your favorite chili ingredients and give yourself time to cook it so that you can tweek it.

I liked it but I had to change a couple of things. I used white kidney beans instead of great Northern  and jalapenos instead of green chilies (reducing the amount) and added green pepoer.  It was good but a bit too soupy. May make it again sometime

This is a fantastic chili recipe! It is quick and easy! I added an additional half cup of whipping cream for flavor. I will need to drain the white beans and green chilies next time. I prefer thicker chili! The spice is perfect!

I actually prefer this to conventional (red) chili. I simplify the prep by putting everything in my Crock Pot (6 quart oval), leaving the chicken breasts whole and removing them about a half hour before the time is up to chop into bite size pieces. At the same time, I add half & half with some cornstarch mixed in to help thicken since we like our chili thicker. I don't know what the difference in calories and fat is from using cream, but I generally have half & half on hand. How much cornstarch? Eh, maybe a heaping tablespoon or a little more and whisk that well with the cream before adding to the chili. This recipe freezes well and even benefits with 'aging.' We absolutely love this on a cold day, topped with shredded Monterey Jack cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and served with a side of tortilla chips instead of crackers or corn bread. I have a Crock Pot that allows me to choose high or low settings, in increments of 30 minutes up to 20 hours. I find that 3 hours on high is perfect for a single batch, but my Crock Pot runs hot. You could cook this on low for 6 hours, and then add the half & half mixture and allow it to cook for another 20-30 on high to thicken. As an added note, if you opt to double this batch in the slow cooker, it will take longer than 3 hours on high.  More like 4-5 hours on high  or 8-10 on low. I also omitted the oil since I was not browning the chicken on the stove first. That dirties another pan and adds a step that isn't necessary unless you are co

This is the first dish I've liked using white beans. I substituted smaller white beans found in the Latin Food section for the great Northern beans and liked the texture. Also, I used cooked roasted chicken breast as I had leftover from a dinner. Just added them to the onion/garlic mixture in pan after they had softened then cooked together for about 5 minutes.

BEST CHILI EVER!  Substituted store roasted chicken by sautéing onion until translucent, added garlic for one minute, then added cubed chicken. Sautéed for a few minutes over medium heat, then followed recipe. Did substitute low fat sour cream and light cream. Fabulous!

No cream or sour cream cooked in my chili.  
Used 3 lbs ground turkey instead of chicken.  Onion and chilies with juice while frying.  After no chicken broth, sub salsa verde. 2 cans white beans with juice, 2 cans white shopeg corn with juice, 2x spices, no oregano.  (are you kidding? add cilantro if you must.)   Put on top of crushed white corn chips, added Jack cheese, sour cream, and cubed avocado on top.
Son won unconventional chili 1st at scout cook off.

This recipe has been a family favorite for many years. Originally published in Taste of Home magazine submitted by Laura Brewer.  It is Identical except for changing vegetable oil to olive oil and replacing 1 1/2 tsp. garlic powder with the chopped garlic cloves. All 3 of my kids asked for this recipe when they grew up and moved out.  I mixed in 1 Tablespoon of flour into the sour cream to thicken the chili up a little and served it in a sour dough bread bowl. Anyway, great recipe.

Oh wow this was so delicious! I did sub boneless chicken thighs for the breast, and used fresh green chile, but other than that made to recipe. Next time I will omit the cayenne pepper as it was a little too over powering for my taste. Will definitely be putting this in regular rotation this fall/winter!

Plan on making this again definitely as my husband, daughter and son-in-law loved it.   I did change the chicken to Tyson frozen grilled chicken and I added 1 jalapeno chopped,  1 green pepper chopped, two stalks celery chopped, and one small bag of frozen corn. Saute the onion, jalapeño, green pepper, celery and garlic in organic canola oil 10-15 minutes and then added the rest of the ingredients except the sour cream and whipping cream.  These I added after cooking in a slow cooker for 2 hours.  Hands free for 2 hours worked for me.  Leftovers reheated also excellent. I even tried it after picking out the chicken as I mostly eat vegetables. Excellent flavor.

Absolutely delicious! We added corn and turkey sausage. Cooked the chicken, onions, green peppers, and turkey sausage in the pan with the olive oil for 10-15min before adding to the crockpot. Drained the beans and corn and added all the ingredients in the crockpot and cooked on high for 2 hrs.

I highly recommend skipping the can chillies and use fresh peppers. I used a combination of poblano, serrano, & banana peppers.  It was delicious! My picky husband thought it was even better the next day after the flavors sat together longer.

Great recipe but I use a can of rotel with green chilies already included in place of the cans of green chilies.

I really liked this recipe as is, but doubled for my family of four...the seasoning is basically the same as chili powder minus paprika, which gave it the kick it needed. This recipe is by no means bland.   I love pickled jalapenos, so I added them to my own bowl and it was perfect.  I won't call it a change to the recipe, just a nice garnish.

Delicious, as is! I like a thicker consistency, so I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 4 tbls cornstarch to the chicken mixture before adding any liquid and mashed some of the beans. Nothing else was altered though. My whole family loved this.

Definitely a keeper. Only change I made was to add extra cumin cause it's my favorite spice. Turned out excellent, will definitely stay as one of our favorites.

I've made this many times. Watch the heat if there are people less inclined to spicy food eating. Made it as is with home grown peppers and it was at the top of the comfort scale.
Great use of leftover turkey too.

I did like this very much.  I will adjust the "hot spicy" ingredients when I make it again and I will make again, will try  some of the suggestions ie. canned chicken.  Love the flavor but, I have a slight reaction to too much spice.

Very good chili! I had to use bell peppers instead of green chiles (I didn't have any & didn't want to go to the grocery store in the rain) but it was still really good! I added some extra cayenne pepper & corn & used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. Overall, quite delicious & definitely something I will make again (especially since there were no leftovers)!

This was really good but I altered it a tiny bit because I can't handle food that is too spicy.  It's definitely got kick and that was after we doubled the broth, sour cream and whipping cream. I also used two pounds of chicken breast instead of one and I found fire roasted green chilies instead of the regular ones. I'm thinking next time I'll add more beans and maybe do half the amount of green chilies. Hubby ate two bowls full and kept raving about how good it was!

Good Stuff!  I added one ingredient to this recipe (just to use it up) but I know this chili would be just as good without that little extra!  Never had chicken chili before this; it will be my go to chili recipe from now on.  Thank you!

Made it as directed except used full fat coconut milk instead of heavy cream and also lactose free sour cream because dairy doesn't like me. Also, I cooked dried beans to save a little money Anyway, it came out delicious!

I shredded in chicken after it cooked in the other ingredients (minus milk products) for 2 hours. Otherwise everything was done as said. Was very good and company asked for recipe. I think the addition of some bell pepper would have enhanced the flavor some more though. Also, if I had not simmered the soup and let it reduced before adding cream, it would have been too runny or soup like as other reviewers stated.

What a terrific recipe! There were no leftovers, that is for sure. I made a couple of changes, to suit our taste, which were: 

1) Added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes (strained out the sauce)
2) Added an additional 1/2 lb of chicken
3) Added another can of northern beans
4) Added additional seasonings, as it was a touch bland for us without it.
5) I prefer a heartier broth, so I thickened the broth with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in a little bit of cold water, then poured that slowly into the chili, stirring to make sure it incorporated properly. That made the broth nice and thick!

And we enjoyed it!! This recipe is a keeper!

my guests loved the recipe. I substituted ground turkey and added some cubanelle peppers and chopped cilantro. Would definitely make it again and already passed along the recipe.

This was so easy & the taste is excellent.  I will make it again. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was due to how runny it is. As others said, keep potato flakes on hand. I made a double recipe & ended up adding 2 cups of flakes. Surprisingly it didn't alter the flavor & it thickened it up.  It is so delicious!!!!!

I used everything but my preparation was different as I roasted the chicken with fresh herbs and veg, then de-boned the chicken, used the drippings and stock from the roaster and followed remaining recipe. This was very flavorful. I will be making it again. Great job, thank you for this.

I entered a chili cook-off and won first place with this recipe!  I made two batches, one at a time- without the whipping cream and the sour cream. Then the chili sat in the frig for 2 days. Day of the cook-off, I whisked together the whipping cream and the sour cream and added 2/3 of it to the chili and heated it in the crock pot. I did use "Tabatchnick" chicken broth- the only decent store-bought broth, in my opinion. It was yummy!
This is an updated review! I did win a chili cook off and today I am cooking it for my family of 13 for my birthday gathering. I doubled the recipe and tripled the amount of chicken. First, I cooked the onion and garlic in a large pan with olive oil. Then I put the cooked  onion and garlic in a large crockpot and set it to high. Then, I rinsed the beans and added the beans and the green chillies to the pot. Next, I cooked the 3 pounds of cubed  chicken in the pan with olive oil and when done added, added the meat to the pot. Then, I mixed all the spices in a bowl, and added all the spices to the chicken broth and put it on high and let it simmer 10 minutes. Finally, I added the seasoned broth to the very full crock pot. After 4 hours on high, I put it in the frig overnight. Tomorrow, I will divide the crock pot into 2 large pot on the stove and reheat and add the sour cream and whipping cream.

I had my doubts about making this soup but I'm glad I did. It is sooo good.  The only change I made was to add a cup of  Monterrey Jack cheese.  Served with warm baguette with garlic and parmesan cheese.  Yum.

Excellent! The chili was perfectly balanced and thick. Not sure what other reviewers did wrong but I found the chili to have just barely enough liquid; I almost wanted to add more sour cream! Make sure you drain and rinse the beans to get rid of excess liquid. Delicious!

This is a good base recipe, and with a little tweaking it is 5 star restaurant quality chili. First, I made my own baby Lima beans in the pressure cooker with bay leaf and onion and garlic for flavor. I strained the cooked beans, took out the bay leaves (4), retained the water. The bottom has a thick bean mixture and that is what I used for thickening.  I simmered the chicken, onion, garlic, green chili's, Chardonnay and broth with the spices + 3 dried chili peppers with seeds removed & crushed into bubbling mixture, anchovy paste, Worchestershire sauce, White wine vinegar(for salt), Chipotle pepper (is a must for smoky flavor), smoked paprika, more cumin, hot chili powder, coriander and more cayenne. Reduced it for 20 minutes and poured it over the beans into the slow cooker. Then I took my same fry pan heated it up, then seared more chardonnay, chicken broth, 1/2 brick of cream cheese, garlic & onion powder, 1-2 T. Butter, 2 big spoonfuls of sour cream and 1/2 C. whipping cream and made it bubbly, tasted and put in black pepper. Basically Alfredo sauce minus the parm cheese and egg. Then poured over the top of the chili and mixed in. Slow cooked  on low about 1 hour. If it was to thin, I didn't notice, but if you want it thicker, add Idahoan potato flakes, works like a charm.  Served with white cheddar and green onion. Husband loved it and it was spicy enough for him, and calmed down with the sour cream and whipping cream for me. A perfect balance.  I used 3 large frozen ch

This was awesome.  My husband loved it.  I thought it was excellent.  I personally like it a little better before I added the sour cream.  The dairy tamed the bite from the cayenne pepper.

I made this as listed,  except that I didn't have the chilies. So I  chose to use a red onion not a yellow onion.  I also added a pinch of chili powder.  When I noticed that the soup was thin as  prepared,  I mixed 2T of masa (corn)  flour with a bit of chicken stock until smooth,  and stirred it into the soup.  This thickened it quite nicely.  Next time, I might add a bit less of the heavy and sour creams,  too.  Served with shredded Colby jack and cheddar cheese and tortilla chips. Turned out really well,  and we enjoyed it.  Will make it again!

I mistakenly bought a can of butter beans instead of 2 cans of great northern and didn't drain off enough liquid from either can so I had to let it simmer longer it was so good my wife had it for breakfast the next day.  I had it for lunch yesterday and it was amazing the flavors and heat are perfect.  I used African fatali peper instead of cayenne (yellow pepper instead of red) I don't think my substitutes would have changed the flavor or texture.  I will cube my chicken a little smaller on the next batch so it is closer to the size of the beans

Came out great and everyone agreed.  I substituted one fresh Pasilla pepper and two fresh jalapenos in place of the canned chilis.  I added these to the onion and garlic with the oil to soften.  I also substituted fresh beans for canned.  I started out with about 20 oz. of dried beans soaked overnight and boiled with one chopped onion until soft.  Because I added onion to the beans I only used one half an onion with the peppers and garlic.   I believe that I started with a bit more than a pound of chicken as well, so my proportions were for a slightly larger batch of chili requiring a little extra liquid.  I will make this again.

Absolutely loved it. I trippled the recipe and it turned out well. I diced and sauteed fresh green chiles rather than using canned. In doing so, I probably using about 2x what the recipe called for because I like think the green chile flavor should be the predominant one. I used a  homemade chicken stock containing mire poix instead of broth to avoid the copious amounts of salt and manufactured glutamic acid (MSG or 'yeast extracts') used in almost every purchased broth or soup.  Other than that I was faithful to the recipe which I try to be the first time. I will be keeping this one!

Delicious! Five stars! Only made one minor change: I like the rustic touch of shredded chicken, so instead of cubing and sautéing the chicken, I sautéed the onion and garlic alone, then poured in the broth, brought it to a boil, and dropped the chicken breasts in. I covered it and let it simmer about ten minutes until done, then shredded the chicken and proceeded with the rest of the recipe as written. Fabulous chili! Served with a dash of hot sauce and a sprinkle of shredded queso verde on top.

I loved it - husband wouldn't eat it. His loss!  I made no changes, except I accidentally put in a whole cup of whipping cream instead of one half cup. I think I'll keep doing it this way on purpose. It is spicy and this tones it down just a bit. I love it spicy though.

This was a hit with the entire family...a rarity. I made a couple of very simple changes. I addeda bag of frozen corn kernels that I had roasted on a cookie sheet in the oven and only used one can of mild green chilies. It was very good with plenty of flavor.

This is very good chili, but it's pretty runny.  I pureed a can of beans and added them, but it's still more like "soup" than "chili", in my opinion.

This was fantastic !! Had great flavor, super easy to make, but I think I would double the recipe for more than 3 or 4 people unless this is just a side for something else, but as a meal, definitely double.  Would be great in a bread bowl too. Will certainly make this again, was a hit with the hubby and the grand kids !!

I made it exactly as recipeexcept: did not need all of the heavy cream and did not drain beans nor green chillis. Also, did not add chicken to pot until I cooked the onions, chillis, garlic and spices together for a few minutes. Let cook down after adding creams.

This white chili was great. However I did make 2 changes, I used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream and white kidney beans in place of the navy beans. It was very tasty!

Awesome!  I can't eat red beans so don't make regular chili.  I made this for the homeless I feed every week (enough for 75 people) and saved a little out for us. We loved it and our homeless guys were ecstatic.  Will definitely make it agai.

I doubled everything except the chicken amount and it was plenty.
I didn't add the heavy cream at all and only used the sour cream as a garnish. 
It's delicious!!

Such a good recipe. So tasty and easy to make. I adjusted it slightly to make a 'lighter' version (use light sour cream or yogurt and half and half). It's pretty versatile too, using most of the same ingredients I made a pasta dish instead of soup and it was just as delicious. It's a regular in my house now.

The flavor of this chili is great, but the texture is a bit off with a more liquid soup based and the diced chicken.  We will make it again and address this by using shredded chicken instead of diced and pureeing half of the beans.

This was very good. Added a bit of corn starch to thicken it up.
Was more like a soup, then a thick and hearty chili. I will make this again.

EXCELLENT! Huge hit with even the pickiest eaters.  Added 1/2 cup celery with sauteed onion, a bit more chicken & chicken stock, only used 1/2 the chilies called for.  Have already been asked to make this recipe for the next family get together!

I made a few changes. I sauteed the onion and garlic alone. Instead of boneless chicken breast I used split chicken breast with the bone and placed the  chicken in a crock pot. After sauteing the onion and garlic I removed from heat than added all the dry ingredients than the beans and I added one extra can of beans. I only used one can of chili's not two.  If you like it hot add more it's all in how much heat you can take. I can handle oh so much. Than I added the broth and mixed it all  together than poured it over the split  chicken breast. I cooked for five hours in the slow cooker. Than I pulled the meat of the bone with a fork removing the bone and excess fat. I used sour cream and whipping cream. It was a little thin so I added flour to thicken it. I loved the flavor combinations. It taste so good and had just enough heat. If you like it hotter add more cayanee pepper and chili's. I'll make this again. Great recipe

LOVED IT, just used 1 heaping tsp of minced garlic vs cloves, cooked chicken, onion, garlic first, then threw everything in the crockpot and cooked on low for the afternoon, turned off crockpot before serving, added in the sour cream and heavy cream and let set for a few.   Husband LOVED it, everybody did!  YUMMY

My favorite way to alternate this recipe is to use my slow cooker! I'll add chicken breasts and the chicken broth and cook on high for about 5 hours. Shred the chicken with a fork. Then add everything else and cook on low for 3-4. Sour cream, heavy cream, and some shredded cheese once it's ready to serve. Great, easy way to switch up this recipe!

I made this for a chili cookoff  and won first place. Awesome recipe. I didn't use canned chicken broth, I made my own with powder chicken base. I added a bag of sweet corn and I thickened it with cornstarch.

I made the recipe exactly as it says and the whole family LOVED it. I made a double batch and it was gobbled up and gone! This will make it into my rotation for winter recipes! Perfect!

I follow the directions pretty close but have to double the recipe. This is absolutely the best white chili recipe ever. I have to double because it goes so fast!

So easy & so delicious!!  I Used dried beans that I already had -  so it took more time to make than if I had used canned beans. My family loved it;) I wish I would have doubled the recipe so we would have had leftovers!

I have never been a fan of white chicken chili but my husband requested this for dinner and wow was this so good! Pretty easy to make too and I froze the left overs for later.  I can't wait to have it again.

I have made this several times. I found the recipe on the Taste of Homes web site from a lady named Laura Brewer Lafayette, Indiana. Did not change a thing, everyone I serve it to goes back for more....thanks Laura for a great recipe.

Best chili recipe ever I never write reviews but I had to for this one, I made it for my boyfriend and upon taking the first bite he gave me a round of applause & told me to make it at his family's next cookout. This is definitely a recipe to try you won't be disappointed!! I doubled my recipe so we could have leftovers & used rotisserie chicken & I also added sweet corn and pepper jack cheese to the recipe. I am one happy camper & definitely making this again ! :-)

Very good with a few modifications:
I used Fresh Peppers, and Ground Garlic.
Good Spicy Heat, Richness and Flavors.

Will be entering this into a Chili Contest in 5-weeks.  I'll report back then

I have made this several times, at party, bbq, and cookoff. It has been the first to disappear each time. I lost the cookoff only because it was a red chili cookoff. It still was the first to disappear after the judging.

Really good. I love the tang of sour cream with this but prefer to add at the table. I'm not so into the cream. I made a double batch sans sour cream or cream & will freeze some for great meals in the future. I cooked dry beans whic worked well.

This chili is really good! My family is not crazy about spicy things so I added a green pepper and cut down on the green chilies. I only put 1 4oz can in a double recipe. Also I didn't have enough northern beans so I used pinto and garbanzo and northern beans. also, I didn't have any heavy whipping cream on hand so I used evaporated milk. Even with all the changes it was really delicious.

My first time to try a white chili, and I've never eaten any before, so didn't know what to expect. It was fantastic. I styed true to the recipe except using only one can of green chilies instead of two. I found one to be enough for us. This will become a year around favorite.

I've made this at least a dozen times. Everyone loves it. I don't bother adding the cream and it's great with just the sour cream. I usually throw the chicken in a crockpot in the morning or use a rotisserie chicken to save time.

I had some leftover chicken and had never made a white chili before. This was a very good way to eat that chicken. I don't think I'd choose to make it without the leftovers waiting to be eaten, though.

I made this several times.   I thought each time followed the directions exactly, but twice it ended up like soup instead of creamy.  Therefore, I recommend reducing the chicken broth by 3/4.  This last time I also drained the canned beans in a colander first.   My family really likes this recipe.

I've made this recipe 3 times now and I think we like it even better each time we serve it.  I doubled the recipe this time so we would have leftovers and we could send some home with our grown children who had come to visit.  It deserves the rave reviews it gets.

This was wonderful! I put too much chicken broth in it so it turned out more like George's by the Cove soup with a southwest flare, but was fantastic!

made a double batch, used 1/2 the amount of chilis called for (4 cans is just a bit too much) and left out onions (they tend to overpower chili taste) and this is the best chili I've ever had!  I have people request that I bring this to pitch-ins and potlucks.

Great recipe. Only modification was to add a small amount of corn starch/water at the end to thicken it a bit. We like thicker chili.

I LOVE this recipe! It's my go-to when I have a little extra chicken breast in my freezer. The thing that kills me about it is, creamy chicken goodness and all, if you close your eyes, you couldn't tell this difference between this and your traditional beef chili. Absolutely outstanding!

I love this recipe, and I've been making it for a few years now. I use about 2c shredded rotisserie chicken instead of cubes, because it makes it feel more like a chili vs a soup.

This is so good!  Made it exactly as the recipe states except for cooking a little longer at the end (after adding creams) to get it to thicken up.  3 out of 4 of us loved it ... My 10-year old, who normally has 2 bowls of any type of red chili I make, did not care for this.  I'm pretty sure that had more to do with the whole red vs. white chili thing than the actual recipe,.

I made this chili as written but instead of using canned green chilies I used Hatch roasted, peeled  and frozen green chili. I used 5 medium hot peppers.  I seeded them prior to chopping. This recipe turned out great and was a big hit. I definitely will make it again. Thank you for sharing this.

I made this last night for dinner and it turned out amazing!!!! Only thing I did differently is I used a store bought already hot and ready to eat Rotisserie Chicken instead. It was way easier! I also topped it off w cheddar cheese :) I will definitely be using this recipe again in the future! My family loved it!!!!  Thks for sharing ??

This is so good, I've made this 3 times following the recipe exactly, but never felt I was as creamy as I wanted, so this time I substituted 4 oz. cream cheese for the sour cream, and now it's perfect!

I threw 8 boneless skinless thighs and the other ingredients, minus the dairy products, into a crock pot and set it to low. At the end of the cooking time I shredded the chicken, added the dairy products, a little more salt, and set it to warm for 15-30 minutes. Served this with a side dish of homemade nachos, and chips and salsa. 2 teenage boys and hubs all loved it and ate multiple bowls. It's a keeper and it makes enough for me to have leftovers!! This will be in the rotation from now on!!

This recipe has made me obsessed with making chicken chili!  I use ground chicken due to texture preference, and use one extra can of white beans whipped with my immersion blender w/ a little chicken stock.  I add the whipped beans toward the end for thickening.  Use some Fritos for dipping!

I LOVE white chili!!! I doubled the recipe, added 2 cups of Monterey jack cheese, and 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro. I didn't deviate too much from this great recipe but wanted it a little thicker. Oh, and the cilantro just boosts the already fantastic flavor!!

My family of seven loves this soup! I have to double it to get a single serving left over for my lunch the next day.

I do half black beans, and half the cayenne since my younger kids don't love the spice, and serve with Monterey Jack cheese and Fritos on the side.  Everyone goes back for seconds.

Quick and easy and full of flavor.  Great for a weeknight meal.  I topped ours with avocado, radishes, lime juice and cheese.  I will for sure make this again as my hubby and son really liked this and so did I.

It's a wonderful chili, I do like my chili thick so I just added a little extra sour cream and a bit of flour to get my desired thickness.

Phenomenal! I stayed pretty true to the recipe, but I did modify it. I only used 1/4 cup each of heavy cream and sour cream, I added a can of beans, and used 1.5 lb of ground chicken. 

Others were right about there being too much liquid, but adding the extra beans, chicken and arrowroot made it perfect! Hubby loved it, and I'm DEFINITELY adding this to the regular rotation.

I make this over and over.  The only changes I have made is I use 1 can of regular green chilies and one can of hot chilies.  I add a whole pint of whipping cream, but add about a quarter cup of cornstarch mixed up on it, so that the chili is thick and creamy.  Also, fresh cilantro is a must.  It just gives it that extra layer of yum.  Sometimes I will throw in a can of drained corn as well.

My family loved this recipe!!! I only made 1 change since others were saying it was kind of thin. I added a thickening. 1/4 cup of Instant Corn Masa mix mixed with 1/2 cup water to add a little texture. We use that in regular chili. Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!

VERY tasty recipe.  I've made this several times now and never get tired of  it.  Sometimes I add cilantro for a different flavor profile.  Bonus - leftover chili thickens in the fridge and is WONDERFUL as a dip for tortilla chips!.  This recipe is also a great way to use up leftover holiday turkey.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!  ")

This chili is a unique brand apart from "traditional" chilies and tastes great!  Instead of using chicken breast I used cut-up boneless, skinless chicken thighs and they came out very tender.  When letting the pot simmer, I suggest leaving it uncovered and allow it to reduce a little bit before removing from heat and adding the creams--I didn't do this and it came out a little soupy for chili (but still tasted great).

Wow this was good! I doubled the recipe since I was making it for 8 people.  I put 2lbs chicken breasts in the crock pot with just enough vegetable and chicken broth to cover.  Sauted the onion with the green chilis in a pan then poured on top of the chicken breasts.  Let cook for 3 hours on high. Then I shredded the chicken, added only 2 cans white beans even though it called for 4, and 2 cans organic sweet corn.  Turned to low for another hour, then added only the sour cream. Turned up to high for the last 30 minutes.  It turned out incredible.  A huge hit with my family, we all had seconds, and have just enough for dinner tonight.  This is my new "go to" chili recipe!!!

Thank you immensely, this recipe was amazing!!!! I stayed pretty true to the recipe, only adding lime juice and a touch of flour in the end since I made it in a pressure cooker. This will be my go to recipe for WCC from now on.

Big win with this recipe! So easy, and so delicious! I took a couple of cues from the Zuppa Toscana at Olive Garden and added potato slices to the pot. Then, when I added the sour cream and whipping cream at the end, I also added fresh torn up baby kale and about 3 oz of finely grated manchego cheese. I'll definitely make this again, but now that I've got the wife hooked on it, next time It'll cost her!

Hey. This recipe was awesome. I did add about half extra of the spices and salt. And an extra clove of garlic. Made it for 3 of us. It was perfect, probably heard "this is good" a dozen times. And one time a "this is the best chili ive had". Thank you for your awesomeness allrecipes!

Absolutely delicious! My husband made this tonight and wow is it good!!! It's got great flavor, just enough heat without being over powering, and a great consistentcy. He made the recipe as-is and said it was very easy. We will definitely make again! Might add corn just for fun, but this is awesome as is!

This was an okay chili. The flavor was different, but it seemed to be lacking something to it. I added frozen corn to it, which help, but still seemed lacking. May or may not make it again.

It was yummy.  I made it on a chilly night and it was tasty. The only change from the original recipe was I added frozen whole kernel corn. I will be making this dish again.

I made it just as called for but didn't add the chicken broth. I thought I would add it last as needed but it was the right consistency without it. Others had said it was runny and it would have been with the broth. It had an excellent flavor and I'll make it again. I also used light sour cream and it was just fine.

This was quite tasty and very easy. I did make some minor substitutions based on what I had in my pantry: I used black beans instead of white, only a single can of green chilies, and had to sub Greek yogurt and 1/2-n-1/2 for the sour cream and heavy cream.  Would it have been creamier with the called-for ingredients? I'm sure. But since I was trying to use up things I had on-hand, I wanted people to know that it stands up to making these changes. I also omitted the cayenne (on account of cooking for little ones) and allowed the adults to add their own spice at the table using hot sauce. Tossed in a can of corn as well. :) I'll keep this in the rotation since even my picky daughter ate most of it! We served it topped with crushed corn chips and shredded cheese.

This was really good soup! I used 2 cans of shredded precooked chicken as previous reviewer suggested and sauteed with onion and garlic. The rest except for sour cream and whipping cream was put into a crock pot. This tasted really good after about 30 mins, but even better with the cream-of course! I will use this recipe again!

I needed to make a large portion and I didn't have enough chicken broth  so I added a can of Hatch Green Chile enchilada sauce.  It was amazing!  I  know it would have been amazing without the enchilada sauce, too! My family raved!

Made 11/15. We loved it.  Excellent, easy and quick. Used 2 boneless chicken breasts, 2 med onions, 3 cloves garlic,  coriander for cumin (had none), FF yogurt for the sour cream and half and half for whipping cream. Was delicious and thick without adding any flour/cornstarch. Looks like picture. Barely made 4 med servings as a main course.  Would need to double for more than 2 people.

Super easy. I adjusted it for the crock pot by throwing the whole chicken breast in with everything else except the cayenne, sour cream and 1/2 and 1/2. I only added 1/2 c chicken broth because the crock pot brings out more moisture. After shredding the chicken, I added the cayenne and back in pot for a bit to meld flavors. Followed by the milk products just before serving.

I love this chili. It is so quick to put together. Most ingredients are from the pantry.  My husband doesn't like sour cream so I subbed plain Greek yogurt and replaced the cream with chicken broth. I love the spiciness. A keeper! I'll be making this again this fall and winter!

This was SO yummy!! I  decreased the amount of chicken broth to 1 cup after reading it was too "soupy" for some. It was amazing! My family ate it up and I dare say it's a new favorite.

I put everything in the crockpot except the creamy stuff.  Those of us who like sour cream, added a dollop to our individual bowls. I didn't have whipping cream so I omitted it entirely.  

There were no leftovers tonight! :)

Great recipe! Turned out wonderful! Several changes I made were using low fat sour cream and Half and Half instead of the heavy whipping cream. Also incorporated (by mistake) these ingredients into the chili early on and let it simmer at that point. Added some corn and used a Cubanelle Pepper since I am not a big fan of the heat.
Thickened it up a bit with some cornstarch at the end. Turned out GREAT! Now my wife wants to bottle this recipe up and give it out for the Holiday as gifts!

To prepare a heart-healthy version, I substituted fat-free cream for heavy cream and low fat sour cream for regular. Added 1 1/2 cups chopped celery sautéed in olive oil along with the onion. You can thicken further with a rue or more purred northern beans.

This was pretty good, but not fantastic.  I pureed one can of beans and added cumin and fresh cilantro. It was still kind of bland. The pureed beans thickened it up enough, so didn't add the cream or sour cream, which would have diluted the flavors even more.

I made it following the recipe, with the exception of doubling the cayenne pepper. This was a very easy recipe to make and tasted really good just following the recipe. Next time however, I will cook the chicken with all the spices and green chilies together. It's watery like soup but I expect that from a white chili. Very good and happy to add this to the fall rotation.

I used leftover rotisserie chicken that I shredded rather than cooking the chicken from raw. I added one carrot as well, and cheddar cheese (1 cup) and reduced the sour cream to about 3/4 cup (I didn't have enough). It still came out very creamy and had good flavor. Definitely a spicy dish. Served garlic bread on the side. It was delicious and easy. A great weeknight dish, and even better for cold weather!

Best white chili I've ever made! I stuck to the original recipe, but didn't use the oregano. I used low sodium broth and I did this one in the crockpot. I cooked my onion and garlic beforehand and put everything in the crockpot for 5-6hrs on low. Shredded my chicken, then added the sour cream and cream at the last 30min while my cornbread was in the oven. Topped it with white and yellow cheddar cheese. Fantastic!!!!

I did make changes but nothing too substantial and I'm sure it would still be five stars without my changes, but here is what I did that was a little different. 1. I didn't use any cayenne, instead I used double the amount of sundried heirloom chimayo chili powder. It is not as hot and I prefer the flavor. 2. I used regular, not heavy, whipping cream. 3. I used 1.25 lbs of chicken (a little more than the recipe called for) and finally, 4. I substituted canned rinsed and drained black eyed peas in place of the beans because I like them better. A couple reviewers said theirs came out too soupy, but mine was not soupy at all. I simmered it in a very wide skillet with the lid off after adding the broth and before adding the sour cream and whipping cream. That may have been what evaporated enough broth. Or possibly the brand of sour cream could make a difference? I used the regular, not light, Daisy brand. 
This was fast, easy, cheap, and delicious! I served it with hot gluten free corn muffins,  and to drink; cold hard cider.

Truly a first rate keeper!  Simple enough ingredients & just the right spices to give it a 3-or-4 alarm heat.   The womenfolk were extremely grateful for both the 'creams' to tame it just a touch.  In this case though, it needed more liquid, as I made the whole mess in my trusty cast-iron skillet & plenty evaporated.  So I added about 2 cups of broth, which was plenty chilled to allow for 2 T's of corn starch as thickener.  The perfect addition!

Like others, I made some substitutions for preferences and items on hand:  a few red pepper flakes (fir the cayenne pepper);  a few jar jalapeño slices (for chiles); light whipping cream and light sour cream; and 1/2 of a rotisserie chicken.  So good--will definitely make again!

I subbed Whole Milk for the Heavy Cream to make it a little bit healthier. And I subbed the Northern Beans for Creole Creamed Navy Beans and added a can of Spanish Rice to kick it up a notch... So I guess you could call it Cajun White Chili now! Regardless it was AWESOME!

The taste is excellent! The kids all loved it. I only got a bit of it the night we made it, they all took the rest to school the next day :-) My kids said it tasted like an enchilada in a bowl.

Only complaint, it was a bit thin. Soupy is how my son described it. I hoped it would thicken up over night, but it didn't. No worries, next time we make it we'll just thicken it with a tiny bit of cornstarch.

WOW! Wicked good! Followed the recipe to a T, except my changes were omit the heavy cream and substitute evaporated milk and thickened it up with a packet of butter flavored potato flakes.  Will make this again! (got those tips from previous reviews)

Loved it! My husband ate it before adding the sour cream and heavy cream and he loved that too! I was out of oregano and will probably leave out next time b/c I really liked the flavor without it. I also used rotisserie chicken which saves time and gives it that shredded texture. Yum!

An absolute favorite! I added one large mashed potato to make it a bit thicker. And I used sea salt instead of table salt. I cooked enough for 15 people, and it was gone in seconds. This and nice slice of sweet cornbread can end wars!

I simply love this recipe! I have made this numerous times since I found this recipe.  I substitute a large can of canned chicken and 2 cans of the rotel tomatoes with chili's since I have to have tomatoes in my chilli.

Make it. Delicious.  I did add a can of DelMonte whole kernel southwest corn.  Knock the heat down by eliminating a can of the green chilies. I didn't do that as my gang likes it spicy.  For those of you who found this too thin, just add a slurry.  A slurry is a thin mixture of cornstarch mixed with water.  Thickened it up nicely.  Very good.  A keeper!

This was delicious!  The only thing different I did was I made it with two cans of Tyson white chunk canned chicken (save on time).  At the end, after sour cream and heavy cream were added, I still felt it was a little too soupy so I put a can of cannellini beans in the food processer to make a paste and stirred it in at the end.  I served this with Krusteaz honey corn bread muffins to two picky teenagers who loved it and I even noticed this morning my husband ate some late last night and he hates cream based anything!  Wonderful recipe, thank you.

I used slightly more whipping cream, because I like a slightly sweeter chili, but this recipe is REALLY good.  I plan on using it for a chili cookoff that I've won twice with a more traditional chili! I didn't believe it would really taste like chili, but because of the blend of spices and pepper, it does, and it's almost impossible to stop eating. I recommend, as with your more traditional chili, letting it sit overnight to really soak in the flavors. When it's first done, it's not all that spicy, and I was disappointed that I hadn't added more chili peppers, but by the next day I think it's PERFECT!

This is very good!!!!  I didn't give it 5 stars because I tweaked it a little the second time I made it, and I believe my changes improved the recipe.  I added 1 can cream of mushroom soup, sauteed mushrooms, 1 can diced tomatoes, and 1 Red Bell pepper chopped and sauteed.  Was good before changes, and with changes it was Excellent!!!

This was really good!  I used raw northern beans.  I rinsed and sorted the beans and cooked on high heat for one and a half hours.  I kept adding water to them, and then the chicken broth.  I left out the peppers and cayenne pepper.  I will make again!

First time making and having white chili. This dish is not hearty (thick consistency). Instead of cooking the chicken w/ oil I did everything in my crockpot. I used boneless chicken thighs and seasoned w/ emeril season, garlic &  onion pwdr and pepper. I used low soudium chicken stock and 1 can of green chiles (nxt time will use 2) and recommended seasonings. Let that cook on high for 3 1/2 hrs. I shredded my meat and added beans let it cook some more for another hour. Then I turned off the crock pot added last two ingredients. Was too thin for my liking and mix a cornstarch slurry; still thin but not thicker and let that simmer for another 30min or so. I also reseasoned the chili w/ salt, pepper, oregano and cayenne pepper and onion pwdr. Made jalapeño cornbread and added pepper jack cheese w/ diced jalapeño peppers. Was k the first day, but much better the nxt day. It had a little kick in back of throat, for more heat I will add jalapeño into pot along w pepper jack cheese.

5 Stars!  I have made White Chicken Chili before, but this recipe had a lot more flavor.  This is a keeper.  Only things I changed is I used whole milk rather than cream, mashed the beans before serving just because I don't like it runny and sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top of each serving.

Cubanellle pepper with the onions, garlic and chicken. A definite keeper recipe!

This was really good. I made the full recipe for just my husband and myself and we only had enough left over for about one more meal.  The only change I made was that I added two cups of diced turnips since I have an abundance of them in my garden.

I have been making this recipe since it appeared in the Feb. 2001 issue of Taste of Home magazine. Everyone loved it, but over the years I realized many people described it as "soup" probably because it contained cubes of chicken. I started grinding the chicken and have actually garnered a couple Chili-Cook Off prizes since.  I usually make a double batch and double everything except I use only 3 cans of the green chilies.

Should of used an extra can of beans and more chicken cause there is a lot of liquid. I also cooked it in a crockpot for 3.5 hrs adding the cream the last forty minutes.

Made mostly as directed in that I used only 1 can of green chilies.  Very good but just a smidgen too spicy.  Will make again but reduce the cayenne a bit.

Generally good, but I'd recommend not using all the salt. Was VERY salty. I think it would have been great if there was less salt. And I'm a self-proclaimed salt-a-holic!  So, if I thought it was salty...

Not bad for white chili. I agree that it is too runny, but you can fix that with 1-2 tablespoons of all purpose flour. I also used another can of beans. Two cans was too little to make the chili stand out. My husband is my toughest critic. He stated it was bland the first bite he took, but after the 3rd bite the flavors started coming together. I took this to our chili contest at church, and though I did not win, I at least found this recipe rewarding as other chili recipes make my stomach turn. Gave 4/5 stars due to being a bit runny.

There's a reason this has five stars.  There's none left at my house!  So good.  I sautéed the onion and garlic, then put everything in the slow cooker except the sour cream and cream.  I added that about 30 minutes before serving.  YUMMY!

Awesome White Chili!! Since I have a large family, I always quadruple the recipe, but only triple the cream and sour cream and add a couple of extra cans of beans. We love garlic so add a few extra cloves, add frozen corn and serve a little 'toppings bar' including shredded cheese, lime wedges, chopped jalapenos, green onions, extra sour cream, cilantro and lime flavored tortilla chips or scoops - everyone always enjoys personalizing their little bowl of heaven. We found this more of a soup than a chili, but easily thickened it by using corn starch, instant potato flakes, using a bit less broth or pureeing a couple cans of beans - depending on what's on hand. A super easy recipe that lends itself nicely to add or subtract to depending on what your family likes. It also works beautifully in a crock pot - just throw everything in and cook on low for a few hours, then when almost ready to eat, turn of crock pot and add creams. We always make Honey Cornbread to go along with it, which makes a nice contrast to the bit of heat in this amazing chili!!

This recipe is delicious!  We did make a few minor changes.  We only used 1/2 of an onion, but added 1/3 cup each of red, yellow and green bell peppers.  We substituted a can of chickpeas for one of the cans of Great Northern Beans, and substituted a can of diced jalopenos for one of the cans of diced green chilis.

There weren't any leftovers, so I'm sure this will be on out dinner table several times this winter!

I won an award at a chili contest tonight with this.  BUT...I made it the lazy/easy way.  Did it all in the crockpot...raw chicken and all.  No fresh ingredients...chopped dried onion instead of fresh, garlic powder instead of cloves.  Omitted the heavy cream (too many calories) and cayenne pepper (too spicy for us).  Wahlah!  You could easily do greek yogurt instead of sour cream and make it a healthier dish.  And canned chicken!  I told you I'm lazy.

Excellent flavor, just enough spice. Loved it, and will make it again. The only thing I would change is to make it thicker,  using less liquid/broth. I added one can of beans, and then the other can I put in a food processor and blended it. That helped to make it a little thicker. 

I love the ideas others had about adding cheese, cilantro and salted-lime chips. You can also put over cooked noodles, rice or add potatoes to this recipe for a change.

Great recipe. But don't count on 8 servings. I added an extra can of beans and still 3 of us only had a small bowl left over (which my son finished off before bed). I will be making this again.

This was a fantastic recipe! I did add a few things though. I used dried red and northwest beans, added sausage in addition to the chicken, garlic and doubled the spices. Since I didn't have heavy cream I used a can of evaporated milk. Normally I wouldn't rate a recipe if I changed something since I like to read reviews that are according to the actual recipe, but since I kept the core of the recipe intact and it turned out so good I couldn't resist. Thank you for submitting this one! It's now my go to white chili recipe!

My 3 and 5 year olds LOVED this, and I can't get them to eat chili normally. I left out the chilis and cayenne pepper, because we don't like spicy things, and also left out the heavy whipping cream. Best chili I've ever made!

I have made quiet a few white chicken chilies before and this one is such a quick and easy recipe to follow! I always use rotisserie chicken instead because I just think it is easier! I add one less can of diced green chilies than it calls for - I tried it with two and I thought it was a bit much! Love this chili! Thanks for sharing!

Get out! This was the "Bomb"! I doubled the recipe using a whole rotisserie chicken (I'm lazy)and used half white pepper and black. I also shredded up about 1 cup of sharp cheddar to throw in at the end, because I had it on hand and needed to use it up. Oh, and I used chicken stock instead of broth. Served it with corn bread slathered in butter. I'm in heaven and so is my man! Thanks for sharing JELZA!

I just won 1st place in a church chili cook off with this recipe.  I doubled the recipe, but used only 1 can of chicken stock & used cream cheese in place of whipping cream.  Cooking all but the creams in the crockpot worked great.

I made for a Christmas eve dinner since I had to work earlier in the day and needed something quick that would not keep me from visiting with family.  This was a hit!  Everyone went back for seconds and a few asked for the recipe.  I did use different beans than what the recipe calls for since it was what I had on hand.  I used pinto, great northern and the white kidney beans.  I doubled the recipe and it came out great.  Im sure it freeze great as well however I didn't have any leftovers to try it out.

I made this almost as written...only adding corn and omitting 1 can of the chiles and the cayenne (I have little kids that don't like spice).  I did use light sour cream.  It was very good.  I didn't have the problem that some complained about of it being too runny.  Everyone in the family enjoyed this one!

My family loved this one!  Except the 10 year old who does not like anything and my 13 year old would have omitted the beans but it was very good :)  I would suggest doubling it to have leftovers b/c our family of 4 went right through it.

Loved this recipe! I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery to make it even easier. I also added some corn for the taste but also a little texture. YUM!

This was very easy to prepare. I made a few slight changes (which to a purist would mean I should not give it this rating.) I added 1/2 can of chiles, 1 can of evaporated skim milk (instead of the heavy cream) and used fat-free sour cream. The first night we had it, it had a nice spicy bite to it (perfect for my 7-year old granddaughter and me, but a bit much for my husband.) The spiciness mellowed tremendously the second day so I added some of the leftover chiles to mine to give it more zip.
Nice filling meal with some crackers and cheddar cheese!

This is a great chicken chili recipe.  My boyfriend is a huge fan of chicken chili and I thought I would try to make some.  He loved it!  I did tweak the recipe a little and that's why I gave it a 4 and not a 5.  I added corn, bell peppers and jalapenos to the chili.  It came out perfect! Served with some corn bread and topped the chili with some shredded pepper jack and fresh cilantro! Yum!

It was good even though I left out the best parts - chicken, heavy cream and sour cream. (We try to eat vegan at home.) I did add nutritional yeast and a little flour instead. We will make it again!! Thank you!

Super yummy! Doubled the recipe and used 4 cups of roasted chicken. Also only added 1 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup whipping cream. Might try white corn in it next time. Only had couple of bowls left over for my family of 3.

Really good...I would give it 5 stars but I made some changes so it really isn't the same recipe.
I did one can of the white beans and one can of black beans...gave it more texture and flavor variety...great northern beans can be mushy.  Also I let everyone put what they wanted for an amount of sour cream instead of mixing it in.  We also added shredded cheese individually.

It was a little on the spicy side for my family so next time only one can of chilies and probably cut back on the cayenne by half...my kids are still little.

Also we liked eating the leftovers with the scoop kind of tortilla chips...the kids thought it was great!

My minor adjustments included using a whole 32 oz carton of broth, added some coriander & dried cilantro, & I also added a tablespoon or two of white wine vinegar to brighten it up. After making it I wishes I had a wedge of lime to squeeze on it. Next time.  Delicious!

I've been making this recipe for a few years now, and we love it. A friend of mine gave it to me - the only difference is it calls for 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of cloves. I like to use white pepper instead of black, just to keep it all white. It is rather soupy, but I like that; it tastes fantastic. Some people add potato flakes or puree an extra can of beans to thicken it up some. It's one of those recipes you can make to your liking.

I have never been so surprised with anything I have cooked. When my family took our first bites we looked at each other and smiled. The flavor to this soup will knock your socks off.  Personally, I didn’t think that it looked too pretty in its presentation but made it because the ingredients sounded good. And was it ever! I had never used sour cream in a soup and didn’t know it would add such a flavor. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was that it is not a creamy or thick soup. Flavor makes up for this though!  Also, this is a high fat soup so if you are worried about this, I would recommend making this as a side dish or first course to start dinner off with. Personally, I say don’t compromise taste by cutting out the tasty ingredients. Let yourself indulge but just eat a little less.

Great recipe: everyone loved it.  Didn't have green chiles so added fewer red--omitted heavy cream on health grounds.  Served on mashed potatoes (didn't say what to accompany it with, and my husband is a potato-freak): will definitely make again, possibly with rice. . .

Made this last night on a super cold night and my husband had 3 bowls!  SO GOOD!  As a timesaver, on most all recipes calling for cooked chicken, I always buy a rotisserie chicken from my grocery store, that is already cooked and VERY flavorful.  With this recipe, I took a fork and just shredded the breast meat off of the bird and even pulled some of the leg meat off the chicken as well.  This saves time with any recipe (chicken enchiladas, etc.) Plus the rotisserie chickens are so tender.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, but added a few drops of Tabasco.  I also used 1 can of beans instead of 2 (but that's just my preference!).  Very easy recipe I will definitely make again!
