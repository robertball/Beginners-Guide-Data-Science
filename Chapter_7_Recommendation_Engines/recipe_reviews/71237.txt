Good basic starter recipe though i had to adapt due to lack of all the ingredients and needed some extra flavours.  Used pork liver and no veal.  Used whole milk because i couldn't get my hands on cream.  Added thyme, mace (you can use all spice) and one bay leaf which i took out before putting it all into the blender.  Homemade pat√® way better than anything you can get at a store or in my case can't get at all.
