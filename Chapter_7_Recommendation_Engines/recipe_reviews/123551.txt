I think the key to not drying out turkey is to remember that meat will continue to cook as it rests before slicing.  I use an electronic thermometer that is left in the meat while cooking, and cook to 175.  While resting during gravy prep the temperature will raise the rest of the way to 180-185, which is perfect for turkey.  I also baste every 30-45 minutes, and put a couple of cups of water in the bottom of the pan.  I really liked this rub.  I hadn't thought of lemon pepper (I used salt free) for turkey before, and it gave it a nice taste.  I ran out of Pam while spraying the turkey, so half my turkey had Pam and the other half had olive oil rubbed on the skin.  Didn't notice a bit of difference.

My family LOVED this turkey!  It was quick and easy to prepare.  I omitted the lemon pepper seasoning and used italian seasoning in its place.  I also was worried about this drying out and the skin burning.  I used 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth in the bottom of the pan and covered it for the first hour while cooking. I also basted every 30 minutes with the broth.  It took 2 hours to get to 185 degrees.  There isn't any left for sandwiches!!

Update: made tonight again for the upteenth time. Have a great new electric thermometer.  It ruined this recipe.  Do not cook this until 185 degrees as called for.  Dried out. Should be about 170.  I have always just baked for 2.5 hours at 325 and it was perfect.  Don't follow the temperature in recipe.

Wow, this is great. Smells great and the recipe is wonderful just as is.  My 6 pound turkey breast (with bones) took about 2 1/2 hours to cook....and it smelled heavenly.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and put 1 can of chicken broth in bottom of pan along with 1 medium onion sliced.  I have always struggled with gravy and this came out amazing, and very simple.

I made this for the first Thanksgiving my fiance and I spent together (today). I am a vegetarian, but cooked this for him. Since I could only find boneless turkey breast, as a previous reviewer, I put some white wine in the bottom of the pan--just enough to cover the bottom. I laid some chunks of onion in the pan, and laid the turkey breast on top. I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and poultry seasoning. I basted about every 20 minutes, and my Fiance loved it. The meat was very moist and flavorful. I will likely make this again.

Made this last Sunday and everyone loved it.  It made a wonderful gravy.  My only substitution was broth, not boullion.

This turkey turned out pretty good.  I used a boneless turkey breast and found that I had to keep adding water to bottomof pan.  Therefore the gravy was not as good as it should have been but would definitely try again.

This was delicious! Like others suggested, I would recommend adding a cup of chicken broth (and I added a little white wine) to the bottom of the pan, as there is little to baste with otherwise. The turkey turned out very moist and yummy and I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

9/16/08: used frozen turkey breast. did not cover with foil. put 2 cups of ckn broth in pan and basted often. also put a few pats of butter under the skin.  used all the spices except onion powder. made a terrific gravy.  just added ckn broth, water and flour to drippings.  allt the spices gave the gravy great flavor.  made with mashed red potatoes, larry likes it mashed with a masher and not the mixer. kids liked it too!

I made this for Thanksgiving (there were only 3 of us) and it turned out amazing! I roasted it on a bed of sweet potatoes, and the flavor from the herb rub and the turkey drippings made everthing taste great. Easy and delicious!

Amazingly delicious!  I made this for Sunday dinner today with my in-laws over, and it turned out perfectly!   The seasoning rub and veggies in the cavity gave this so much flavor, and I cooked until my meat thermometer read 175- which was perfect.  Very moist and yummy.  The only thing I did not do was follow the directions for gravy.  I have a foolproof gravy recipe I always use.  Skim the fat off of the pan drippings, and then add them to a saucepan.  Mix in a quarter cup of flour with a whisk until smooth, and then cook over medium-low heat until it turns into a thick roux.  This happens fast, so don't walk away.  Then add chicken broth a little at a time to your desired consistency.  This always makes perfect gravy- no matter what type of roast you have made.  I will definitely make this turkey again!

Delicious! I played around with the spices, but other than that, made this recipe to a "t". I had to add some liquid to the pan to keep it moist, and I used a foil tent to help as well. If the recipe had called for these things I would have given it 5 stars. I made turkey soup with the carcass the next day. The gravy was absolutely awesome!

We all thought this was moist and delicious.  I added about a cup of chicken broth to the bottom of the pan, covered the breast in foil for the first hour, and basted the breast (and rotated the pan) every thirty minutes, adding chicken broth as needed.  The chicken broth enabled me to skip the water and bouillon at the end, as I wound up with plenty of liquid and drippings for the gravy.  A savory (and tasty!) combination of spices,  and it really did make delicious gravy.  I will definitely be making this again.

I didn’t bother with either the celery or the onion.  I rubbed the breast all over with butter rather than cooking spray, then with the combined seasonings.  Lemon pepper didn’t appeal to me so I substituted a new seasoning I’ve been wanting to try, “McCormick’s Grill Mates Smokehouse Maple Seasoning,” along with the remaining spices as directed.  I had a 6.69 pound breast, and it was cooked to a perfect 170-175 degrees in just under 2-1/2 hours.  I would suggest NOT cooking the turkey to the 185 degrees as this recipe directs.  I did not baste it at all – not only is that not necessary, but by not doing so, I was rewarded with a nicely browned turkey breast with crispy skin, that most certainly didn’t take as long to cook as it would have had I opened the oven door every half hour.  While the turkey rested, I made my gravy as I normally do – with the pan drippings, flour and chicken broth.  This was so moist and tender, and the recipe, for the most part, is a good foundational recipe.

I used an oven bag to avoid basting and didn't get around to making the gravy, but this was the best turkey I've ever made. We used the bed of onions and celery and added 1 cup of chicken broth and about 1/2 cup of white wine. We'll definitely have this again sometime - thanks for the recipe!

I did the onions/celery, added broth to cover the bottom of the pan, then totally spaced out and completely forgot the spices! I basically put it in naked. Cooked about 2 hours and was done. It was excellent and made excellent gravy despite my major gaffe.

I loved this recipe! The flavor of all the spices really create a wonderful turkey dish. The only thing I did was add a can of chicken broth to the bottom of the pan for more gravy. This is defiantly a keeper!

Turned out perfect.  The skin was crispy and a lovely dark golden color.  I added about 1 cup of white wine and 2 cups of chicken broth to the bottom of pan for basting.  The breast was juicy and tender, I used a boneless breast.  The gravy was delicious.  I used this for Thanksgiving this year, will use it for Christmas again.

Delicious! Just made this for Thanksgiving and it was not only easy but absolutely delicious. Followed the comments of others by cooking for only two hours at 325, covered for first hour, basted every half hour, added 1 can of chicken stock (and extra water toward the end). Gorgeous gravy, moist, tender, not at all dry. Thanks so much for posting!

Honestly, It will be a long time before I cook a turkey, the old fashion way.  Old Black Woman, from Louisiana, gives this turkey recipe, more than two thumbs up.  I also added turkey wings to recipe.  My husband cut up wings, and I placed them in slow cooker with the breast.  As the kids say, "OMG"!.  I shared leftovers with two of my coworkers, and they said their families thought they were in seventh heaven.  The only thing I did differently, was the gravy.  My husband always make a "mean" gravy.  So he added the gravy from the meat, and incorporated in his own thing, and all I can say, again, is "OMG".  Thank you to the originator.

Really good! I halved the recipe for a 3 lb turkey breast and added the broth, onion and celery to the pan. It was really moist, with great flavor. It made great gravy. Thanks for the recipe.

Very nice rub. The celery and onions added nice hints of flavors. I needed to add water to the pan after 30 minutes. Will do again.

We like lemon pepper so I thought this would be a 5 star for us.  The rub resulted in a pretty turkey breast and the gravy looked fantastic, but taste-wise, it was off for us.  Would have been much better on chicken.  Like most reviewers, I used chicken broth in the pan instead of water (about 1 quart, but my roasting pan is huge).  Timewise, my not quite 6lb breast took almost 3 hrs at 325 (and my oven runs a bit hot) to reach 175.  Am glad we tried it but won'tmake with turkey again.  Will modify for chicken breasts and try again.

So simple and juicy! Check occassionally, ie when basting/injecting, to make sure water does not completely evaporate.  Add some, if necessary.  We did not make gravy, so let turkey rest covered in aluminum foil for 10 minutes before serving.

Wow...the best Turkey breast I ever made! It came out so flavorful and moist and sliced up perfectly! This one is a definite keeper and will have them begging for you to make it again & again! Even the gravy was tasty!

While visiting Utah for Christmas, my mom bought a turkey breast instead of a whole Turkey as she assumed I liked white meat. Well, I generally don't but I used this recipe and it turned out to be the moistest most declicious turkey I've ever eaten. It blows away any restaurant's turkey! We didn't have lemon-pepper seasoning so I used italian and squeezed a lemon into the herb mixture. Also, I took my hand and seperated the skin from the breast meat and put about 5 pats of butter inbetween the skin/meat then secured the opening with toothpicks. I basted every 20 minutes or so, and this turkey (which was an 8 pound breast) was done before the recipe says so keep watching it! I made my own gravy recipe, so no need to use this one if you don't want to - the turkey is good enough! Enjoy!

I made this on Christmas Day and it was fantastic! I used 2 3 lb.boneless turkey breasts; a quart of low-sodium chicken broth, and used Wondra flour to make the gravy. Will definitely make again, as these were much more moist than the whole turkey also on the family's Christmas buffet table. The spice rub really made a great gravy!

I made this exactly as directed.  It was dry, every time I basted the breast, it just rinsed the seasonings off of it.  I prefer a high heat for the first 30 minutes to crispen the seasonings into the breast and then be able to baste without worries.  We won't make this again, sorry  :/

First time I ever cooked turkey for Thanksgiving.  I was looking for a smaller version from a whole bird and this was just the ticket.  I really liked the splice blend.  Very good.

This was SO perfect.  I did have a little trouble getting the breast to stand up with the onion and celery "inside" it.  And, also I only baked until my meat thermometer got to 165....after taking it out and letting it stand it had risen to 180 (I looked this up on Emeril's site).  It was absolutely perfect.  This was the first time I didn't use a turkey baking bag...

Great recipe. I replaced half of the lemon pepper with Cheyenne pepper. I added chicken broth half way through and covered it as well. I used butter instead  of the nonstick cooking spray. Since I added the bouillon to the turkey I didn't add it to the gravy. Gravy was wonderful.

Wow!!!!  I found a turkey rub several years ago and it produced a delicious turkey.  I was unable to find one in the store this year. I decided to see what allrecipes had.  This was perfect.  I cooked my 6 1/2 lb breast in a bag and did not need to baste.  This was the most flavorful and moist turkey I have ever made.  My 3 boys ate it all in one sitting!! The next day, I was buying another 6 1/2 lb turkey breast to cook to go with all the other dishes left over.  Besides, we didn't get enough turkey.  This is a winner!

this is my first attempt at roasting a turkey (breast), and my first attempt at Thanksgiving.  People raved about it and are still eating leftovers.  It was really easy to do.  I used all of the ingredients that I had around--so that means no onion powder or lemon-pepper seasoning.  it took about 3 1/2 hours to cook, but that might have been because i was cooking 2 turkey breasts at a time.  i left foil on most of the time and only removed at the end.  i also added two garlic cloves under the turkey with the onions and celery.  yum!

Crazy good!  I thought my husband was going to lick his plate to finish off the last drops of gravy.  He asked me to roast a turkey breast last night and all of the turkey breasts at the store were frozen solid.  So, I used a 5 lb whole fryer chicken.  I cut the rub in half due to the small chicken.  I rubbed the chicken with a little bit of olive oil prior to adding the rub and I did put a slit over each side of the breast and put a pat of butter inside.  I used a can of chicken broth instead of water and bouillon although I don't think that makes any big difference.  Finally, I thickened the gravy with 2 TB of flour whisked into a cup of milk.  Don't mess with the herbs/spices - they are perfect!!  I can't wait to try this with turkey and I can tell you that this will be on my table come Thanksgiving!!

this turkey was unbelievable! it was the first turkey breast i had ever made and it was also the best i had ever had. i took a couple of the review suggestions and left out the lemon pepper seasoning, added ground thyme and ground mustard to the rub. i covered the bottom of the pan with about 3/4 of an inch of chicken broth and put little pads of butter under the skin. i basted every 25 minutes. it was awesome and the gravy was so delicious... my husband even said that i can't even mention it to his mother because she would be affraid i'd encroach on thanksgiving!

This turkey came out so moist and tender and it was seasoned perfectly.  I used the recommended seasoning but I just added a little more.  This was the easiest and best tasting gravy I ever made.  I guess the secret is the bouillon cube.

Not difficult and my family liked it. The only problem was that there was very little pan drippings to make gravy from, so we had only a small amount of gravy. However, what there was was delicious. Only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of water for the gravy. I would never add water to gravy, as it dilutes the flavour. Thanks!

This deserves 10 stars!! By far the best turkey I have ever had. I rubbed some of the seasoning mixture under the skin and used the rest on the outside. I used one can of chicken broth in the roasting pan and cooked to 170.I have never seen such a juicy flavorful bird!! This is the only way I will ever cook turkey from now on.

The rub was fantastic and didn't need altering. However I made some changes to the rest of the recipe. I used an eight lb turkey breast and rubbed olive oil on the outside instead of the spray. About 1 hour into cooking, I added 2 tbls of butter to the top. Then about a half hour later I added 1/2 cup of water to the bottom of the pan. Throughout the cooking time I continously basted the turkey. Cooked wonderfully! While the turkey was resting in another plate, I strained the juices into a saucepan. There was enough drippings so no broth or boullion was needed. Then I mixed 1 tbls of flour in 1/4 cup of warm water and mixed that well. While I was mixing the flour mixture up, I heat up the drippings almost to a slow boil and added the flour mixture. Came out great!! I will make this again!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it turned out great! I used a can of broth in the pan like suggested by another reviewer and it was so moist and delicious that there is very little left over. I did not make ht gravy though because I ran out of time but I'm sure that was delicious as well.

I modified this recipe for a two pound boneless turkey breast. I used a deep pot on the stove at medium high heat and put 1 cup water on the bottom as well as the celery and onion. I rubbed the breast with the seasonings (scaled down) and added a pad of butter. I just put the lid on and let it cook for about 45 mins. Absolutely wonderful! Would work nicely for a slow cooker as well.

Sorry, but we didn't like this very much.  Not enough drippings to really baste the turkey with and the skin never crisped up.  Seasoning taste was not to our liking.  Next time will stick with the "Homestyle Turkey, the Michigander Way" also from this site.  Would work just as well on a breast, I think, and you would have plenty of juice for basting.

I made this for both Thanksgiving and Christmas and it was wonderful!  I'd reccommend substituting the water with chicken broth and I eliminated the lemon pepper on Christmas, I liked it both ways but I just wanted to test it.  It is excellent, moist delicious tons of compliments.

This was such a juicy turkey.  It had a really great flavor also not too strong but just enough.  I did follow others and left out the lemon-pepper seasoning my husband is not a fan of lemon-pepper.  I also used a garlic clove instead of garlic powder.   I baked at 450 for the first 30 minutes then turned the oven down to 325.  I checked it and basted it with chicken broth and it's juices every 30minutes. I needed more gravy so I added a can of cream of chicken and chicken broth along with the ingredients called for in the recipe. I am not sure I would do that again it was good but kind of tasted too much like soup instead of gravy.  All my guest and family loved it!  Thanks Emily Chaney for the recipe it is Great!

I fully intended to make the slow cooker turkey breast recipe on this web site but when I pulled out my crock pot and the turkey breast, there was no way it was going to fit!  So I made this recipe instead.  So glad I did because it was delicious and moist!  After about an hour of cooking, I realized there were no juices to baste with so I added 2 cups of water to the bottom of the pan and basted several times.  I then followed the gravy directions and added all the liquid from the pan (strained) to the gravy.  Really tasty!

This was very good and I will make it again, but I altered it a little. I used lime pepper (all I had);preheated the oven to 425, then reduced to 325 once the bird was in; basted with melted butter; and made the usual pan gravy with some of the drippings, flour, and diluted chicken broth (Better Homes style). The turkey was a lovely brown and very moist and tasty.

Overall this was very good. It definitely needed some salt, though. Next time I will put some salt in the rub. I did add a pinch of thyme to the rub. Next time I will also put in a pinch of rosemary. This was very juicy as other reviewers said. It did cook faster than I thought it would. I had a 7 & 1/2 pound turkey breast that cooked in less than two hours. I took the advice of another reviewer, cooking it to a temperature of 165, mine actually was 170, and then letting it cost the rest of the way as it rested before cooking. This recipe is a keeper.

I made a few changes and my husband said this is the moistest turkey he has ever eaten.  I use a disposible turkey bag and no need to baste.  I put the water and bouillon in the bag with the turkey, onion and celery and added 1/2 c white wine.  Only bake until thermometer is 165 (about 2 hours.)  Temp will rise to 185 on the counter.
