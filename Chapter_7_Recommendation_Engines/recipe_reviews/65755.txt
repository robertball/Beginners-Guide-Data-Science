I was in a rush to make an appetizer that I could bring to a holiday potluck. This appetizer was so easy to make and the other guests were so impressed that many of them asked me for the recipe. This dish is a keeper!

O.K. Used chopped black olives instead of diced. I turned mine into a whole pizza putting pancetta on one side and omitting the olives with the other side being prepared like the recipe. We liked my version better with the pancetta and the omission of the olives. Looked pretty however.

I made the leek and olive portion of the recipe as written but put on croustades instead of pizza dough (used Crostini D'Emily croustade recipe from this site.)  Delicious, popular, and very, very easy to make for appetizers for a crowd.
