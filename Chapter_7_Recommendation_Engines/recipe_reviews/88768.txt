awesome recipe! I did make a couple of changes according to what i had on hand though, but it still came out brilliantly. i'm eating while i type!
i "made" the vegetable broth by crumbling a boullion cube in about a cup of water, and let the tofu sit soak while i was mixing the flour. I never measure more accurately than just eyeballing when I cook, but I used about a handful of brown flour (rather than white), and added maybe a tbsp of a curry mix spice (cumin, curry powder, garlic, mustard powder), a large pinch of chili powder, a large pinch of dill, and some fresh ground pepper. i skipped the yeast because i didn't have any (although i am a fan of that stuff). i also didn't add any salt, as boullion cubes are usually loaded with salt already.
i used just enough olive oil to coat the bottom of a small frying pan and fried until crispy. yum! and it only took me about 10 minutes in all too!

Very good. I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in place of the yeast. 
I also added salt at the end. 
To make the frying easier, I used tongs to flip the pieces of tofu. It was very easy that way to brown all sides.

Great! I served them with quinoa and black beans (from this site) and sprinkled a little soy all over. We both had seconds, and wanted thirds! If you want the tofu a little more dense (than even the extra firm) cut it up, marinade in the veg broth, and stick it in the freezer for a while. You can leave it there for at least a couple weeks, and it becomes more dense. (Freeze in a single layer until frozen) This goes for any tofu recipe, especially those that go on the grill!

My husband downed these tofu nuggets!  I  did make changes: I used some cornstarch instead of yeast; I also added some garlic powder to the flour.  I didn't soak them in broth first so they kept more tofu flavor (my husband loves it).  I fried them in a mix of peanut and sesame oil, and we dipped them in 2 sauces--one was a soy sauce/lemon juice mix, and the other was like marinara sauce.  They were a yummy treat.

My first attempt at making tofu and it turned out great thanks to this recipe! Per the Mock Chicken recipe I put the tofu in the freezer until a day before I needed it when I let it thaw in the refrigerator instead of simmering it in hot water like the recipe indicated. Wrapped in a dish towel I am able to squeeze out a fair amount of liquid without having to place a heavy object on it like I have seen suggested. I did make the mistake of buying firm instead of extra firm tofu but it did not cause any problems. These turned out great crunchy and tasty on the outside with a chicken like texture on the inside. Definitely keeping this one!

This was excellent! I soaked it in a vegetable broth from a soup the night before, and breaded it with half flour and half onion ring batter mix. We dipped them in a hot and sour sauce and a marinara sauce...made them taste like mozzarella sticks! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night and it was wonderful - it made the tofo a perfect consistency - fried just enough so that the tofu wasn't too, well, "tofu-ey". Perfect blend of spices. I served it over a bed a mashed potatoes with a great mushroom sauce. I highly recommend it!

This is an excellent recipe.  The tofu has a nice crispy outer breading with a soft, chewy center.  I didn't have nutritional yeast so I substituted cornstarch as another reviewer suggested.  I made this for my boyfriend and myself (I'm a vegetarian, he isn't) and we both loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this for my non-tofu eating friends, and they all loved it and want the recipe. It's become one of my favorite ways to cook Tofu, and tastes lovely dipped in plain yogurt. A tip for nutritional yeast - I found it in the beauty section at Whole Foods in large cans,  but apparently it's also available in the bulk section where you can buy it by weight. Enjoy - it's delicious!

AS IS, this recipe is only a 4 because it requires waaaay more seasonings such as garlic, onion powder, more salt & pepper, etc...but when you add your own touch to this recipe you'll find it's fantastic. If the flour doesn't work for you, substitute with corn starch because it sticks to the tofu much better and it fries better too.

Not a typical tofu eater. Tried this recipe because we are trying to incorporate less meat and more protein foods into our diet. Plus my youngest is allergic to pretty much everything. I altered a little with rice flour & used cornstarch. no cayenne pepper. They came out crispy and needing a little salt but good. I will probably use a soy sauce/ lemon mixture to dip them into.

Finally got 'em right after the 3rd time making these! :) A couple tips: Soak tofu in chicken broth overnight for max flavor. Before rolling in flour, dont wring out the broth from the tofu, so its able to soak the batter and make it stick. I alternated between a bowl of seasoned flour, and a bowl of crushed, seasoned croutons & crackers. It made the "nuggets" crunchier. (Press tofu in flour 1st, then the croutons, then the flour again) Fried in olive oil, and it turned out GREAT as you can see, and tasted great also!

I made a change to this.  The coating on the tofu will come out crispy every time if you add ground sunflower seeds and almonds (or other nuts) to your flour.  Simply grind up some sunflower seeds and nuts in a blender and add to the flour.  From the seeds and nuts, you will get plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, which makes this recipe even healthier.

Loved it! Quick, simple and you could experiment and do just about any kind of seasoning. My daughter ate three sticks, which is a HUGE meal for her.

So good! This is about the only way that I cook tofu anymore. I simplify it a little bit by freezing the tofu before thawing it to use (for a better texture). After being pressed & cut into strips, I bread it in a mix of flour, garlic powder, & chili powder that I kind of eyeball and fry it in a bit of olive oil. When done cooking, I throw it in a bowl, pour some sauce over top, cover it with a lid, and toss to coat. YUM! The biggest hits have been Sweet Baby Ray's mild buffalo sauce & Panda Express' orange sauce. Serve with some rice & you've got a great, filling meal!

Wow, I get to be the 100th rater! I thought this was pretty darn good! Dipped in marniara. Didn't have vege stock so I used chicken broth. (I guess the stock is for the vegetarians among us!) Also used corn starch as others did for lack of "nutritional yeast" what ever that is. I added some garlic powder because well... garlic is good in anything! I omitted the salt as well because the broth was already salty. Will make again with a different name than "Tofu Sticks" for my man!

A relatively alternative to chicken nuggets!  I skip the yeast, use chicken broth, and much less cayenne.  I also use much more oil to fry them (no deep-frying in that they are not completely submerged, but I usually use about 1/8 in. in the bottom of the pan).  Quick and easy---definitely a keeper!

This was delicious! I made a bunch of changes though. I ommited the yeast and didn't have any sage. I used extra cayenne pepper, with some basil and lemon pepper. I also didnt have veg. broth so I dipped them in egg whites and then the flour mix. IMPORTANT: It's extremely helpful to bake the tofu before coating and frying it. This makes it stay together and have a MUCH better texture. 
Definitely a keeper!!

YES!! We've found it!! We have been looking for that perfect deep fried tofu recipe...like the one at the Sushi bar...this is it! I didn't soak it in the broth or use spices (next time--I am sure it makes it even better). Even plain, dipped in soy sauce, this is a winner. We will be making this OFTEN. My 3 year old loved helping roll the tofu chunks in the flour/yeast mixture and then gobbled them when they were cool enough to eat! A family favorite for sure. Thanks for the recipe.

Good recipe.  Tofu turned out very crispy and had good flavor.  Used Parmesan cheese instead of nutritional yeast as didn't have any on hand.  Okay, so not vegan, but good nonetheless.

I made this for my kids because they love tofu (I hate it) and they ate every last bit.  I backed off a little bit on the cayenne, but otherwise I made it as stated.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it for friends who aren't usually enthusiastic tofu eaters and they liked them too.  I used extra firm tofu.  The only unfortunate thing was that I was unable to find nutritional yeast at my local grocery store so I had to leave it out.  I'll keep looking for some and look forward to trying this recipe with the yeast.  My brother is a strict vegetarian and LOVES nutritional yeast on everything.

I tried this recipe first just pressing the tofu and the 2nd time after freezing the tofu. Freezing it made it sooo much better. Also cutting the strips thinner makes it crispier. To freeze I drained the tofu, put it in a freezer bag, and thawed in the fridge. Then followed the recipe. YUMMY! My husband and four year old loved this.

I would definitely add more seasonings to this next time. The texture was okay- but I would pan fry it before I breaded it to add to the crunchy texture. I didn't fry it though- I baked it.

This was a really great recipe!  I was trying to find a way to make tofu crispy and it worked.  The only thing I would have changed is to have a zestier breading.

I liked this recipe.  I've made it several times. I would recommend sprinkling  crushed almonds or peanuts on the tofu and using peanut oil instead of vegtable oil.  This will make the tofu crunchier, and peanut oil fries at higher temperatures.

My boyfriend and I had this for dinner last night.  We both enjoyed it.  This is one of the first time I've made tofu that was edible!  I changed the spices a bit based on what was in my kitchen and dipped the things in marinara sauce.  Tasty!  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was amazing! If you want to add an extra kick and you're a health freak try cutting up some kale, bell pepper, green onions and even serrano peppers and cooking it wwith the tofu. It turned out delicious

I only used curry with the flour and did not use nutritional yeast. I made a sweet chilli dipping sauce that went perfectly. I took thai chilli paste, added a little rice vinegar, some minced garlic, a pinch of brown sugar.

This tofu was AMAZING. I added considerably more spices than it called for, but I like a good zing in my food. One thing you should note is that unless you press out a LOT of the vegetable broth, the tofu will be very squishy on the inside. To de-squishify it, either press out more liquid OR freeze it for a few hours OR bake it at a low heat for 10-30 minutes.

This gets 5 stars for consistency. This fries up beautifully and is nice and chewy. My only complaint is that it is REALLY bland. Cannot be eaten on its own, good recipe maybe for making sweet and sour tofu or something like that.

Pretty good, although next time I'd go a lot more heavily on the spices and I'd mix the spices in the flour. I had sprinkled a dash of cumin, cayenne, salt, pepper, garlic powder on top and only the first piece got the spices! And I didn't have nutritional yeast or sage to try, and I also didn't bother soaking in broth and it was flavorful enough.

Very good and easy to make. I've recently stopped eating pork, beef, and chicken and I'm making an effort to serve less meat to my family. This recipe fills the meat void.  I followed the recipe as written and ended up with browned crispy nuggets that were really tasty.  As others have stated, a sauce is needed. I mixed ketchup, soy and rooster paste for a spicey dipping sauce that was excellent.  Next time I'll try a dipping sauce from this site.  This recipe is a keeper!

So this went down really well with my kids.To make it extra crispy i used cornflake crumbs as well.I also dipped the slices in egg before as the crumbs just fell off. I added a whole bunch of herbs as well as garlic powder. They did taste a little plain..I think i might marinade them in b'que sauce next time and see how that is.

I've never prepared tofu before, and I found this recipe to be a very easy and fun way to serve tofu.  I upped the sage and cayenne a little and added a little dried basil to the breading and left out the yeast as I had none.  We dipped these in honey mustard for a great lunch!

This was very tasty, and better than fried tofu I've tried making in the past! We ate it with quinoa and some steamed veggies. My only complaint was that the breading tasted a bit flour-y. The spices were delicious, though. I'm interested in the suggestion of adding ground nuts/seeds to the breading. I think I will try that next time I make this - because I do plan on making it again!

This was exactly what I was looking for. Perfect consistency and the spice was enough that I could eat it plain, but not so overpowering that I couldn't add it to another dish.

I'm sorry to say I didn't enjoy this recipe at all. I had high hopes when others said it was similar to a mozzarella stick, but even after freezing the tofu, then thawing it in broth, the end result tasted like plain rubber. The seasonings were good but did not seem to impart any flavor to the tofu. Thanks for the recipe though.

Great! I made it with just a mild curry powder for the spices. My 1 and 3 year old GOBBLED them up, just as finger food dipping into hummus. So easy and fast. I think you could add crushed peanuts into the breading, or use some peanut sauce as a dip. Thanks for the very useful recipe.

Delicious! I made two minor changes: I skipped the salt, as I used regular, not low-sodium, veggie broth, so that was plenty of salt for my taste. I also tripled the pepper, just because I love fresh ground black pepper and almost always add more than the amount called for to recipes. I served it with a side of sesame rice noodles and everyone loved it--a real crowd pleaser! I will most definitely be making this again! Thanks so much for the fabulous recipe!

I had some tofu on hand that was going out of date and needed to make something.  This recipe was a great use of it...I didn't have the yeast, but used some corn starch with the flour and spice mixture.  I liked the results of this recipe, a good way to get some extra protein and the only fat was the small amount of oil used for frying.  I dipped in a soy sauce/red chili pepper combo.  yum!

Thought this was okay.  Might try it again with smaller cubes and make the breading spicier.

My husband probably would've eaten the whole package of tofu by himself!  This was a really good way to eat tofu, and it got just crunchy enough on the outside.  I used more oil than called for, unfortunately.  I'll try to cut back next time.

I'm usually sceptical about tofu recipes but I was very happy that it turned out so well.  
I don't like changing a recipe the first time but I did two things different.  First I cut and froze the tofu for 45 min.  I guess it is supposed to help the cosistancy of the tofu.  The other thing was I used rosemary instead of sage because I didn't have sage.  
These turned out so great that my tofu hating husband acutally tasted them and thought they were "not terrible" :) and my 6 yr old son wanted some.

This is a great base to start from for fried tofu! I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I used what I had and it still turned out great!! I just used the flour, cornstarch (instead of yeast) and cayenne pepper. It flavored it just right and next time I will definately be adding the rest of the original ingredients. I have been wanting to eat a little more tofu in my diet and I'm glad I found this recipe.

I REALLY wanted to like this recipe b/c I'm desperate for a good, seasoned tofu dish. But this tasted like the plain old tofu I'm used to. Maybe it needs more spices or maybe I'm just not used to fried foods and didn't cook it long enough. Probably won't try this again.

My first time cooking and/or eating tofu as it never looked all that appetizing.  I was given some firm tofu and needed to do something with it.  I made it according to the recipe as written.  It was Awesome!  As others have proven, it can be adapted to your preferences, but I liked it just fine made this way.  Great recipe.  Thanks!.

Good recipe.   Don't leave out the nutritional yeast.  Nutritional yeast is not equivalent to corn starch.   It is cheesy, buttery and rich and adds a lot of flavor to the breading.   If you are going to add corn starch swap out the flour for corn starch.

the name "softly spiced" is exactly what it was.. but unfortunately it translated into bland for me.. maybe it's bc i didn't soak the tofu in the broth i'm not sure.. but that's why i'm giving it a 3 star rating and nothing less.. i could have gotten away with a lot less flour and a lot more spices.. maybe the key is that you NEED to have a dipping sauce.. maybe if the poster included a recipe with a dipping sauce instead of just mentioning it in the introduction then i'd be less critical.. i used 2 T oil but felt i could have used even less than that.. i substituted 2 T of cornstarch for the yeast as another reviewer suggested.. and the cook time was way off for me.. i'm sure i spent a lot more than 15 min's trying to brown on all sides and i had the flame on as high as it could go.. if anything, this made me very thankful for my thai place up the street

Sorry I didn't like this. I think it might have tasted better had the tofu marinated in the broth for a longer time. I added cumin, cayenne and garlic powder but it still tasted under seasoned.

My first time cooking tofu and I am hooked. These were simple and very tasty. I may add some Italian breadcrumbs next. Used same recipe with cheese sticks in case these were awful. Surprisingly, the crowd preferred the tofu! Another keeper. Thanks Allrecipe!

Wow! This was sooo good. I had to slice an orange to munch on so I didn't eat them all right out of the pan. My tofu fell apart while I was pressing it so it wasnt pretty but it didn't even matter! I used them in the vegetarian karma on this website.....all I can say is Holy Moly it was awesome! Even picky kids loved this.

This is great. To be honest, soaking the tofu in broth doesn't impart much flavor. So now when I make this, I heavily season a saucepan of broth (garlic, onion, soy sauce, ginger, pepper, etc.) and boil slices of tofu in that for 30 minutes, then remove and press dry. I followed the rest of the recipe precisely and it was delicious. I am not sure how people could omit the nutritional yeast -- it gives so much flavor to the breading that corn starch absolutely lacks.

Very good.  Added a little extra Cayenne pepper, put in a little garlic powder, mustard powder, and a dash of chili powder as some of the other reviewers mentioned.
Turned out great.  The only thing I'd do different is use a non-stick pan.  The pan I used to saute the tofu in made the tofu keep sticking at times causing some of my sticks to crumble into little pieces.  Still very good though.

I've never eaten or made tofu, so I don't know if my review should count.  I liked it, my kids didn't.  I dipped it  some Yakisoba sauce.  Plus I cut it up into small bites and put it in my stir fry.  I liked that.  Plain though, it's bland. I'll try it again with a sauce.

I expected this to be good, but it exceeded my expectations! Absolutely delicious! I didn't have nutritional yeast (different from baker's yeast) or cornstarch so I used bread crumbs and it worked fine. Also I added curry powder and garlic powder to the mix. Really fantastic and I will make it again

None of us really liked it. My daughter (3) kept calling it "eggs".   Thats exactly what the texture inside was like.  We've been eating Veg a few months and tofu numerous times.  We will not be making this again. It was hard to get down.

Very yummy. I would use a deep fryer on these next time tho. The breading kept sticking to the bottom of the pan.

This recipe was alright. We are not big tofu eaters but if in a pinch i will make it again. I did have to add curry, chili powder and cut the salt in half to kick it up a notch.

This is one of my favorite tofu recipes I've tried from this site, and as a meat-eater, I still was impressed. I had to be patient to get them to crisp up because it takes a lot longer than the recipe says. I also salted when they came out of the oil. Now I just need to find a good dipping sauce!

This recipe is perfect for the veggie eater in your home. Dont be afraid to add a bit of extra cayenne pepper for the "kick". Also I added garlic bread crumbs and they were mmmmgood!!! serve with your favorite dipping sauce and have a party. :)

It is gorgeous, I spiced up the flour mixture like others suggested and I fried it in a shallow mix of vegetable oil and spicy sesame oil. Its a keeper.

Such a great recipe! I'm transitioning into eating more vegetarian meals and I loved this. My previous experiences with tofu were a little disappointing but this turned out great. I served it with the "Garlic Feta Dip" I found on here as well and it was excellent together. However, I breaded the tofu ahead and cooked it later so the dough was very sticky and I lost a little bit of it. So next time I will bread and fry it right away.

Excellent recipe; quick and easy.  I have made these several times now, they are a staple in my home.  I strongly suggest doubling the spices; otherwise, the flavor is bland.  Once I doubled them, these came out tasting like chicken strips.  Everyone I serve them to loves them; and,they go well in dipping sauces!

This is a wonderful recipe! I've been a vegetarian for 3 years and have never cooked tofu myself, thinking it would be too difficult and also my boyfriend isnt fond of it. This recipe solved both avoided both problems for me. My boyfriend loved these tofu sticks and the were so simple to make. Thank you!

Tried this recipe b/c tofu was on sale. The tofu was crispy and better than any I've made before! I should've read more reviews before trying. I wish I had put more seasoning in the flour. I will make this again, but I'll up the spice ratios!

This was amazing! We are huge tofu fans, anyways, but this is our new favorite. We couldn't find the nutritional yeast, but it tasted great without it. Also, next time we'll omit the extra salt. Thanks!

I cut the tofu into small half inch square bites and baked it for 15 minutes or so and then soaked in vegetarian vegetable broth, rolled in spices and fried.  The result was very nice and crispy and definately had noticable flavor but needed something just right to go with it.  I tried light sour cream as a dip (didn't have plain yogurt) but it washed out the flavor even more.  After a little hunting I found the Peanut Sauce I recipe at this site and it was AMAZING paired with this.  The sauce is super quick, easy and yummy - i subbed honey for molasses and soy sauce for tamari and didn't have to go out to buy a thing.  Anyways, thanks for a good base spicy, crunch tofu recipe.  I'm sure I will make again when I need a meat substitute for any spicy dish!

Wow, this is the best tofu I've ever made! Thanks for the great recipe. 

I used the tofu to add to a vegetarian thai basil fried dish I made--great combo!

Delicious! The instructions are for 1/2 by 1/2 inch sticks, but the pictures show cubes, and I think that would work better for dipping. I rarely fry food, so I wasn't sure what heat to use, but I tried high and it worked fine. Just be careful if you do multiple batches not to let the burnt breading that stays in the pan get on your fresh sticks! This will definitely be a new tofu standby for me.

I have tried tofu in this fashion over an over, this was by far the best recipe. I can't have wheat or yeast, so I used rice flour, and used garlic powder and chili powder. It was fantastic, the closest I'll get to good fried fare until I can reintroduce more foods to my diet.

This is a delicious way to make tofu. I used to make it with bread crumbs but I needed lots of egg before and after the crumbs to make them stick and to get it to fry right. This way is much better because the coating is finer and sticks much better. I didn't use broth, just the tofu juice. I used tofu that had been frozen and thawed in the fridge so it was 'meaty'. I didn't need to press it, just squeezed it out a little before breading. It turned out really well and tasted great with chile dipping sauce. My husband used plum sauce and my son used ketchup. All were tasty. I will use this recipe from now on.

Absolutely delicious!  As someone who seems to rarely like vegan dishes (but tries hard to be a vegan anyway), let me tell you:  you will LOVE these yummy little tofu bites!  They are absolutely delicious; my cats even like them (and my cats NEVER like any of my vegan dishes).  I soaked the tofu in the veggie broth before slicing it for about a half hour, and then cut them and soaked them for another ten.  Yum!  I highly recommend this recipe!

I added ginger & garlic powder to the veggie broth and corn starch instead of the yeast and they were great... Hubby wants to try adding bread crumbs to the breading mix next time.

I really liked thisdish. The coating was very tasty, though the kids didn't like the texture of the tofu. Next time I think I will try freezing the tofu to give it a meaty texture. I went a little heavy on the seasoning and it was perfect.

I am addicted to this recipe!!!  I've made it many, many times.  And I didn't even think I liked tofu!!  I slice the tofu brick into patties instead of sticks and I add a Southwestern dry rub mix (found at Target) into the breading.  I dip it into plain yogurt mixed with curry powder.  So, so good!!! :)

Very good! It is a great way to use up tofu if you don't normally have it around and aren't familiar with cooking with it. I used about a half inch of oil to get them closer to deep fried. I also used chicken broth because I'm not a vegan or anything and I dipped them in soy sauce. =) They were great!

My vegetarian family loves this tofu!  After a couple of trys, I've found that deep frying makes it amazingly more delicious. I'm not big on deep fat frying; I only use it for a couple of recipes, but try it with this one! The family gobbles it up every time.

This is a great recipe for tofu!  Crispy and tasty on the outside and inside!  I made this as a part of a thai dish and turned out great! Followed recipe to a T.  Thanks!

I am new to cooking tofu.I found this recipe easy to make and loved the flavor. I served it over asparagus and carrots. One thing though, my partner who is semi-veg said there was not enough flavor, so I might try a vegan poultry seasoning or allspice in the batter next time.

I went a little easy on the pepper since I made this for my 1 year old as well as myself. He gobbled it up and I thought it was pretty good.

Great Recipe!  Try dipping them in tamarind sauce, it's really good.  Tamarind sauce is usually available at east indian groceries.

I am new to cooking with tofu & can’t believe how good this was. I didn’t have sage so I substituted with equal amount of poultry seasoning. After frying, I discarded all but approximately 2 Tbsp of the oil & stirred in the flour mixture I had left over from coating tofu. Cooked for 2 mins then added 2 cups milk. (Obviously not vegans) Served with mashed potatoes. Was absolutely delicious!!!

I made this for my granddaughter for New Year's dinner (she's a vegetarian).  I used cornstarch instead of the yeast and it fried up nice and crispy.  My granddaughter loved it, said it was the best tofu dish yet.  She even took what little was left home. I certainly will be making this again.

My kids and I really love this simple,  tasty recipe. The 2nd time I made it, I used chili powder instead of cayenne and sprinkled salt on the tofu before marinating. It was excellent both ways, but I prefer a tad more saltiness. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for my vegetarian adult daughter.  She was less than thrilled with them served as sticks, and said they would be better if they were nuggets and used within another recipe as a meat substitute, rather than eating plain or dipped.  So I may try that next time.  I tried one myself -- I'd never had tofu before -- and thought it was pretty good, a nice recipe for tofu beginners :)

I followed the instructions exactly and even marinated for extra long in the veggie broth but it was still pretty much tasteless.  The texture was good, but it really needs sauce on it.  I added sweet chili sauce to it which saved the meal.

Great great great recipe! And such a fantastic way to prepare tofu for a nice starter to a recipe that needs toasted cubes of tofu. Here what I did--
I made the recipe as stated, but toasted up some ginger, garlic and thinly sliced carrots in the oil while the cubes marinated in the broth--then fished them for later. 
After the tofu cubes were all fried, I fished them out of the oil and wiped the pan almost completely dry. 
Then I heated some the leftover broth with natural peanut butter, soy sauce, and sraracha. The remainder of the broth was used to microwave some frozen baby broccoli florets. There was literally no waste--except a small bit of leftover flour. 
I then combined the sauce, broccoli, the cubes and carrots/garlic/garlic bits all together, and served over rice. It was FANTASTIC!!!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

We made this for our Vegan daughter, not knowing much about how to prepare tofu. It was very good however, next ime we will let it marinate for hours rather than minutes and use a lot more spices. Especially garlic salt. 

Our daughter LOVED it.

This is my first time trying Tofu, and I was pleasantly surprised. The recipe is great, and we followed the directions flawlessly.

The only thing I feel needs a bit of a change is that they seem to lack flavor just a bit (I suppose that's why the dip is recommended). I may end up experimenting with the recipe a bit to add some extra 'kick' here or there, but the recipe is definitely a keeper

It was alright... the breading needed ALOT more seasoning. I think the seasoning would have helped a tremendous more. Its a good concept though, just needed more or different seasoning. Thank you for sharing

I'm pretty new to cooking with tofu and have been experimenting lately - this was a simple but delicious recipe.  The kick of spiciness and crisp, light breading hit the spot.  I didn't have the yeast either, so I substituted store-bought Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs, which worked fine.  (I also had chicken broth to use up, so I sub'd it for the veggie.)  The sticks would probably be great as an appetizer or snack with a cool, cucumber dip such as tzatziki sauce, which would complement the zestiness, or served on top of a salad.  My boyfriend and I actually incorporated them into a fondue night using another contributor's recipe for Basic Fondue (but with beer instead of milk).  I recommend this as a quick and easy way to do tofu and will likely try it again, playing with the spices next time.  Thanks!

This is a keeper!  I made it last night and put it on top of some whole wheat pasta with tomato basil marinara sauce and made tofu parmesan!  It tastes amazing.  I imagine you can put it in a ton of different recipes.  I used the leftovers in a cold salad for lunch today, too.

I loved the texture of the tofu, but it seemed pretty bland to me.  I will try this again but with more spices

This was pretty good!  I used cornstarch instead of yeast and added garlic and extra cayenne!  I also cooked these in peanut oil for added flavor and dipped them in Japanese Spicy Miso sauce!  Yummy!!!

I made these and served with pasta sauce.  My kids thought they were o.k.  Next time I will make them thinner so that every bite is crispy.  I did not freeze the tofu and thaw, I will try that next time because the insides were gooey.

Unfortunately nobody like this much.  But we are not used to tofu... I am trying to find some ways to get my family to eat less meat.  I ended up using the coating I had left for chicken since nobody would eat the tofu.  It was great on chicken!

this was tasty but salty. i'd probably omit the salt next time. i used herbes de provence instead of sage. also, i used penzey's black and red (black pepper and cayenne), just 1/2 tsp total. it still had quite a kick. i omitted the yeast as well (didn't have any). served with steamed broccoli.

This is a standard dish in our household.  We often prepare the tofu "francaise" style or with gravy.  I've made this dish for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians and everyone loves it.

Good but not amazing.  You could sort of taste the flour.  This recipe would be useful in preparing tofu for the tofu parmigiana recipe which is also on this site.

First time I've ever used tofu and I loved it.  I tried to replicate a recipe I had in Beijing.  This wasn't quite right, but it definately satisfied the craving!  It's great with the sweet chili Thai sauce.

I think I must have not had the oil hot enough because by the time my tofu was golden brown it was also quite rubbery. I will try again because this has the potential to be a great recipe.

Excellent and easy! I Did make a few minor adjustments - omitted soaking in the broth. Instead dipped the tofu in egg and rolled in breading. (I added some onion powder to the breading.) Make sure to fry long enough to crisp the outside.
I served it with the ginger dipping sauce from this site. Delish!

Finally a recipe that makes crispy tofu!  I'd almost given up!  I let it drain for about 20 minutes, did not soak it in any stock, and just pressed it between paper towels. Other than this, followed the recipe exactly.  I ended up with perfectly coated golden  brown crispy "sticks" of tofu!  We dipped it in peanut sauce--yum!  Seasoning was mild, maybe next time I'd try to zip it up a bit.

Yum! This was really good.  I used whole wheat flour mixed with ginger and garlic salt to coat, then fried it in olive oil.  I served it with a little soy sauce to dip.  Everyone loved it.

This was good for a tofu recipe.  I omitted the nutritional yeast and replaced the flour with a mixture of 1/2 soy flour and 1/2 cornmeal.  Also I marinated the tofu over-night.

I didn't use sage - i used parsley; and i didn't use cayenne pepper - i used chili powder... but my results are the same as other reviewers... we liked it a lot. My husband even liked it - he said " i like it b/c i doesn't taste like tofu - and it's spicy - yum"  And he went back for seconds... usually when it comes to tofu, he doesn't even finish his first serving... so i'd say it's definitely 5 stars and I will make it again.

Love it! very good and easy. I used ghee instead of oil. Adds some extra flavor. Put this in some fried rice (don't even need eggs in the fried rice),and you are good to go!

My newly aquired vegan son ABSOLUTLY loved this.  I suprised myself and thought it a very tasty snack.  Dipped in a thai vinagrette with green onion concoction. Hope I can recreate that dip.  Not sure if the dipping sauce was the best part or the seasoned tofu.  Will make again and again.

This was really awesome. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, and it still turned out wonderful.

I used homemade breadcrumbs, which were a bit too irregularly shaped to coat the tofu completely, but really, the tofu tasted great anyway. Nice and crispy on the outside with a non-jelloey inside. I want to say it was actually a bit of a chicken consistency (think McDonald's chicken nugget 'chicken').

Loved it! Served it with noodles that were also spiced a bit.

I never thought I'd like tofu.  This recipe proved me wrong.  The only change I made was to fry them in olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Good stuff.  Reminded me of fried mozarella sticks, only much healthier.

I used the recipe here for the breading and used squash pieces instead of tofu! It was really good, so tasty and delicious! But, I fear that the squash was a little too moist compared to tofu, and soaked up a lot of the breading, even after multiple coats! I suggest that anyone who wants to make a good breading for any vegetable or meat substitute try this recipe. I can't wait to actually use tofu next time though!

Good blend of spices. Next time, I think I'll use silken tofu, more salt and a little bit of peanut oil when frying to get the texture I want.

Pretty good - added less sage b/c I'm not a big fan of the taste, but added a bit more salt.  Served it with some plain yogurt mixed with a bit of cumin & cinnamon for dipping.  Yum!  Fried the tofu in two batches and the second batch came out much crispier due to the oil already being used.  Also, used chicken broth instead of veg broth, since we already had some open.
