OMG! I saw this and absolutely had to try it! This definitely is a delightful twist on traditional strawberry shortcake. It's so easy and it's a great way to use up glazed doughnuts. It leaves you wondering why you'd eat a glazed doughnut any other way! And while it's not for those counting calories - it's OK to indulge once in a while (at least you can say you got a serving of fruit LOL). I did drizzle these with a little chocolate sauce to take them over the top but they're fabulous as is - everyone loved these. This quick and easy recipe is a definite keeper. Thanks voraciousgirl! (my husband thanks you too!)

Seriously?! This idea is genius!!!! So long spongy shortcake....hello amazingly delicious glazed donut...squishy sweet donut meets fresh juicy strawberries and creamy whipped cream...all in a single sized portion. I am definitely making these again for Father's Day. What Dad wouldn't feel like a million bucks after devouring one (or two, or three...) of these?

I did find that a bread knife worked really well at slicing them, and a finger licking job it was!  My Grandkids will LOVE this!

I have to admit I was skeptical at first. I tried this with cake doughnuts and it was really good. I used unglazed and glazed thinking the glazed might be too much but it wasn't. The glazed is definitely the way to go. It is perfect with the tartness of the strawberries. I made a few other changes as well. I sprinkle sugar on my strawberries and let them 'marinate' in the fridge for a few hours to get nice and juicy. I also made my whipped cream in my isi instead of whipping in a bowl. I added a couple more teaspoons of vanilla to give it an extra yummy flavour.

After you clean your berries use an egg slicer for slicing the berries and they come out the same size.  lay them across as you would a hard boiled egg.  Makes it faster and easier.

When we were younger, my mom used to use day old cake doughnuts with sliced strawberries and the old Dream Whip you made.  Everything old is new again!  The strawberry juice would soak up on the day old doughnut and it was ummmm-good.  Better than dry shortcake.

One change, and I hate recipe changes, but pipe that whipped cream just for ease of execution! What an amazing thing that I WILL HAVE to try with Krispy Kreme Hot and Ready glazed! Have mercy!

Oh, my GOSH!! This recipe screams controversy in the most scandalous way and scrumptious way. Everything looks so GOOD that my mouth is watering!! I also like the fact that the ingredients are portioned. I can make two for myself and my sister, and this recipe will hopefully satisfy my sweet tooth. :-)

This is a great way to spruce up ordinary strawberry shortcakes!  I did add a little bit of sugar to the sliced strawberries ahead of time, to allow the strawberries to release their juices.  I dusted each donut shortcake with powdered sugar over top.  I think it would also be great drizzled with chocolate sauce.  Thank you for the different idea!

I love strawberry shortcake and this was no exception. I think I actually like it better from a standpoint of not having to macerate the strawberries. I also think the type of donut used impacts the overall quality. I bought donuts from my local donut bakery and I think this could be a fun recipe to experiment with!

I'd like to take the cream for this recipe and slather it on everything. It's worth it's weight in gold… Well maybe not its weight since it's late but it's excellent! Make this recipe soon but be careful not to squish the donuts like I did ;-)

Absolutely great just as written! Made this for our youth group and it disappeared!  Agree that a serrated knife works best on donuts.

So easy and a big hit!  The fresh strawberries in the grocery store didn't look good so I bought frozen sliced strawberries and they were great! I thought the whipped cream a was too sweet but everyone else thought it was perfect.

I was worried that the doughnut would make this dish too sweet, so I used less sugar than usual in both the strawberries and the whipped cream.  It turned out perfectly, and my husband announced that it was his now-favorite dessert!

Recipe for whipped cream is probably enough as is.
