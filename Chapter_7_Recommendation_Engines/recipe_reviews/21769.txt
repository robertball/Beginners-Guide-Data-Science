Excellent rice pudding! I assumed that 1 cup of water was needed to boil with the uncooked rice. We liked the hint of maple, and the custard was perfect - not dry or watery, and just the right sweetness.

this is the first time i've ever made rice pudding.  i made the following alterations:
2 cups thick whipping cream
1/2 cup 2%milk
1/4 cup maple syrup (real maple syrup NOT something like Aunt Jamima's (sorry about the spelling)
i mixed the  out of the concoction BEFORE adding the rice
 
People have said it curdled, it's not that it curdled it's the fact that it has a similar consistancy to creme brule
it was awesome!
even the dogs loved it.
i like really sweet things so this did it. it was great for breakfast with my morning coffee. thanks!

i think the trick is to mix the eggs, sugar, milk and syrup so that it's completely liquid with no lumps.  it turned out nice and golden and was very VERY good. thanks for the recipe...oh yeah and i didn't add raisins. lol
thanks

The pudding tasted good, but it was very watery and curdled.  Maybe because I used skim milk.  If I try it again, I'll use something with a little more fat.

We liked the taste of it. It was good.  The thing that I would change is to put a dash of cinnamon on it after it has been cooked to add a little more flavour.  Also I would add a little bit more milk in it to make it not so dry.  thanks for the recipe.

I knew from the recipe directions that this would not produce a creamy rice pudding, but more custard-like.  I didn't expect it to separate so much though or be so watery (except the other reviews warned me).  I won't make this again.  I like the brown sugar and maple flavor, so I will probably try it on the stove top with the same ingredients minus one egg.

Tastes GREAT )with added vanilla & cinnamon) ... but really needs to be cooked at a lower temp, in a water bath, in order to be creamy.  I'l be experimenting.

I used medium grain rice & 1% milk (which work great for stovetop rice pudding) - rice & raisins sunk to the bottom, milk/egg mixture curdled.  Sweetness is fine. Something definitely missing to make the pudding creamy and not separate.  2 1/2 c of milk is what I'd use for 1 1/2 c cooked rice on the stovetop. Since this was only 1c cooked rice, the milk ratio is probably too high. I also wondered about the bake temp of 400, seems quite high (vs. 375 or even 350).  Don’t know how many times I’d be willing to “tune” this to get it right.

Came out very curdled, wonder if it would have done better if it had been in a water bath.  Ended up stirring and cooking it longer.  Kids loved it.

I made this recipe with japanese short-grain rice, and i don't know if that was what went wrong, but it came out of the oven all seperated, like scrambled eggs and rice. flavor was fine though.

I made this for my family and they hated it!  The Maple Syrup gave it a completely different taste.

Not bad. If I make this one again, I will do a few things: reduce the milk by one half cup, double the amount of syrup, and add two tablespoons of corn starch to make it a bit creamier. It turned out okay, but a bit watery.
