Nice "Italian" twist on a breakfast sandwich! This definitely is tasty and great for on the go. I used thick sliced Italian bread that I had on hand and brushed it with olive oil. I'm sure any type of bread would work just fine. I scrambled my eggs with a bit of milk and used shredded mozzarella cheese. Fresh tomato and basil are always great together and this was no exception!

This "recipe" certainly doesn't require a lot of skill or effort but it is noteworthy for its creativity. I used a sturdy Italian bread, and butter rather than  olive oil.  This is a nice breakfast sandwich that has tons of flavor (but I really would have preferred it without the eggs - sorry American Egg Board).

This recipe was soo heavenly!!! I guess its just a choice of taste, because I really loved the combination of eggs, tomatoes, and basil. It was really easy to make as well, I just scrambled eggs, cut one tomato, and used some fresh basil leaves from my garden. Then i grilled these with shredded mozzarella cheese on whole wheat bread using olive oil. It was perfect for a late brunch!
