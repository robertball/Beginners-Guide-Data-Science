This was good and it was also my dinner. Although I liked it the cottage cheese it was not well received by the "guacamole purists" in the crowd. Although it isn't authentic 'guacamole' it is very good.

I made this as written except I blended the cottage cheese, avocado, and lime juice in the blender with a little bit of garlic juice and water.  I thought it was better than regular guacamole.
