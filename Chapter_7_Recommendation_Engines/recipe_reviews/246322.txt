It needed sugar, nuts (ANY) and sugar, minimum.  Perhaps better if following a granola bar option.  Also need vitamin addition

I'm sorry, but this did not work for me. I was intrigued by it, so, of course, I had to try it. I had everything on hand to make it, so I thought I'd give it a go..The top never really browned, staying flimsy in the middle while the edges were starting to burn. Also, there is to much salt in this. I thought this was a cool concept, but it just wasn't right for me.
