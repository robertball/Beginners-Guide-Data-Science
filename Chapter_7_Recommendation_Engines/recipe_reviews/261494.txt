My sprouts were fairly large and they were pure mush after 3 minutes. The flavor was good so I'll try them again but with less cook time. I diced bacon and sauteed that with the onions and it was delicious!

9/29/2108 - These came out perfect! Sautéing in the pot until slightly browned adds to the “roasted” look. The cook time is spot on. When I mentioned this method to my mom she thought they would be mushy. Nope! Oven roasting is still my preferred method of cooking brusssels but this is great, too.

Very delicious. Will make again. Did not have  vegetable  broth so  I used low sodium chicken broth and I use 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of 1 teaspoon. Used frozen Brussel spourts instead of fresh. Good recipe my family will have this again.

Just learning my instant pot.  After reading all the reviews, I only cleaned my brussel sprouts and "scored" the stems to allow stem in.  Followed directs exactly with my lowest setting to pressure cook at 5 minutes.  Did the quick release and veggies were perfect.  Nothing soggy!!

I made this last night. When I did the saute part, I added a sprig of rosemary and one of thyme. After the sprouts browned I pressure cooked them for 4 minutes. They were amazing. Just like roasted in much less time. Will definitely make again, as my husband loves brussels sprouts.

I would cut the cook time down to about 1 minute if I try this recipe again. My brussel sprouts were medium sized and  came out mushy.

Yum! Do not change a thing! Don't forget to core your fresh Brussel's sprouts. I added 2 slices of turnkey bacon. Will make this again and again.

Me exactly as written and it was a hit, even with my anti Brussels sprouts husband! I think I will follow the advise of other reviews and add garlic powder and turkey bacon.

Made this exactly as written except we put it in the oven for a few minutes at the end to try and get a crisp on them.  Yes, it was cooked through but the flavor was disgusting. I'm sorry, this one went straight into the fail bucket.

I made this. It was AWFUL!! Roasted, my sainted Aunt Matilda! We both like brussels sprouts a LOT, but these were mush. Back to the oven! The IP  is good for lots of things, but this is not one of them.

There’s NOTHING crispy about these. They’re  complete mush. :-(

I’ll try again with a much shorter cooking time.

The sprouts weren’t too mushy and had a good taste. However I would’ve preferred if they were been firmer. They did not heat up well because they became mushy and I didn’t taste so good after being reheated.

Quick and easy and tastes good.  Even my wife that doesn't like Brussels sprouts thought it was good.  Only thing I would change is to use garlic salt rather than plain salt.

Followed the recipe by sauteing onion, seasoning and brussel sprouts in olive oil.  Switched to pressure cook and added  3/4 in sections of 3 carrots. Put 1 cup water in bottom, put all veggies on two  crossed over racks, and p cooked 3 minutes after seasoning again. let 10 min elapse before reducing pressure. Sprouts were perfectly done and carrots were very done. Next time I will cut the carrots in 1 inch sections. Hubs liked the dish!

I wouldn't consider these as 'roasted' and they certainly do not end up 'crispy' as the recipe suggests. Making them 'roasted' and 'crispy' they need additional cooking in an air fryer or under a broiler.

Made it,  and used onion powder as I didn't have an onion. I chopped up bacon and sautéed it along with some minced garlic (not in recipe, but I was improvising), and cooked the pressure-cooked for 2 minutes. Was delicious! 

I like brussel sprouts that are kinda crispy, so I'll probably pressure-cook for just 1 minute next time. Good recipe!

Mine came out a bit soggy. I put them in the oven for about 30 minutes on 400 to crisp them a tad and then crumbled bacon on them. They were delicious after that. I will adjust liquid and try again soon!
