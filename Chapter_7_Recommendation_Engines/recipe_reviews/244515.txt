I made this with my niece and it was fun! I used a handheld easy chopper so it would have been faster in the blender but delicious. Loved it.

Very good however unless you watch the video first, there is an omission in step 4 of the written directions. It leaves out adding the remaining half of the pudding mixture after you have added the remaining gummy worms and has you adding the final layer of crumbs so make sure to note this or you will have a large amount of left over pudding mixture.

Made this for a demonstration speech in my Public Speaking class! Was a hit, though messy.

This was really easy and yummy! We added a haunted twist to ours and made it a haunted pumpkin patch with skeletons (see pic)!

Very festive, the kids loved the gummy worms inside. Just make sure your cream cheese is at room temperature when you start mixing or you will have lumps.

I've never seen this done as a pumpkin patch! My daughter and I made it layered in a pumpkin pail to share at gymnastics. Big hit! I used store bought green frosting instead of mixing my own.

Loved it! Had a ton over so made a mini patch or a patch annex!
