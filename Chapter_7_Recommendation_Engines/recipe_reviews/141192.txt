Just a note: the chops should be baked covered (not uncovered as recipe indicates).

These were pretty easy to make.  I substituted ketchup for the tomato juice, and added some garlic powder, dried mustard and worchestershire to the sauce.  The chops came out nice and tender with a good flavor.  Overall, a decent recipe...

It is a good recipe for a sweet and tangy flavor.  To make this even simpler just use your favorite BBQ sauce and bake!

I just made this for dinner.  Absolutely Fabulous!!!!  My husband does not like sweet meat and he loved it.  I made a few changes, I used 1 can tomato sauce instead a tomato juice.  I added garlic powder to my bread crumbs.  Lastly, I added 1 small can of mushrooms and 1 small chopped onion to the sauce and let it simmer.  I will definately make it again.  So easy and I'm not a very good cook.

Wow. Like someone else said, I was skeptical about the sweetness, but it did some major justice to the meal.  My husband loved it and my kids actually ate it.  I also did not have tomato juice, so I added one small can of tomato sauce and one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes which I crushed on their way out of the can (in my hands, it was fun).  Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe.  Served with Chicken Broth rice and cabbage (saute with margarine).  Definite hit at our house!

This was pretty good.  I didn't use the eggs, bread crumbs or veggie oil, and didn't fry them at all.  I put them in the baking dish raw, put the liquid mixture (after boiling and simmering) on top and baked them for an hour.  These were great.  14 points for WW following the recipe, 10 without frying them.

These were tasty enough.  Good flavor.  However, the sauce does not thicken at all.  I ended up putting in on the stove top and thickening it a little bit by putting instant potato flakes in it.  The chops were not near as tender as I thought they would be judging by other reviews.  They were moist but not overly tender.  I did cover them for 45 minutes of the cooking time because, in my experience, they turn out more dry and less tender if cooked uncovered.  I'm glad I didn't cook uncovered the whole time now. Hubby isn't a big fan of tomato based things but he liked them.  Didn't love them but liked them enough.  They could have been a lot more tender though.  Over all a decent recipe and I will make it again from time to time.

Just had this for dinner.  My whole family enjoyed it, even my picky kids!  I did use thin sliced pork chops & jar sauce (chunky basil).  I covered the pan with foil & could cut them with a fork.  Very good!

I cooked this recipe with 4 porkchops instead of 6 so I used 2 cups of tomato juice (actually V8).  I forgot to change the proportions on all the other ingredients so it was probably sweeter than intended but definitley great!  The pork was so tender and the meal went great with a fresh green salad with mixed berry dressing!

Pretty good!  My hubby and I really enjoyed the flavor this recipe had!  The Pork Chops came out nice and tender too!  The only draw back with using Tomato Juice is there is a lot of juice waste after cooking.  I would make this one again and that's saying a lot for someone who doesn't really like pork chops!

Made this last night and basically followed the recipe to the dime.  It was delicious and really easy.  I will definitely make these again.  I paired the meal with Broccoli and Garlic Butter.

These chops were very good! I took one reviewer's suggestion and used bottled BBQ sauce and it saved me a bunch of work, so I can't speak to the flavors of this sauce. I can say that these were the juiciest pork chops I've ever made. Sometime soon when I'm not rushing around on a weeknight, I will come back and try the full recipe with homemade sauce as I'm sure it makes these tasty chops even better!

I think you can halve the sauce ingredients and it would come out fine

This was a very tasty dish and easy to make. I used tomato sauce instead of tomato juice. Since I love garlic in everything I added one crushed clove to the sauce mixture while it simmered. I, also, liked the flavor that the ground cloves added.

I'm not a big fan of sweet sauces for meat, and I didn't like this one either. There was just way too much brown sugar for me. I also didn't like how the breading got really soggy and flavorless from baking in the sauce. I probably won't try this recipe again.

I wasn't quite sure when I put it in the oven, but my husband devoured it! We thought it was great... and VERY easy!
