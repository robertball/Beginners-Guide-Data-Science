In my opinion, with autumn here, that means apple baking.  These bars are wonderfully spiced, and delicious.

Very good. Made a very good dessert for last nights dinner and will make a great snack today. I am not a baker by nature and this recipe scared me but I am glad I tried it anyway. I rolled the crust out much larger then I needed only to figure out that you don't want the bottom crust to lay over the top of the baking dish and that you should make the top crust just a little larger than the inside perimeter. I had so much extra crust I made cinnamon pin wheels with the extra.

It has good flavor and I will make it again, but next time I wont use oatmeal. I will not put anything on the bottom crust. It was too dried out.
