People could not get enough of this. We were practically snatching the bread out of each other's hands to scrape the pot.

I used a mixture of Gruyere, Emmenthaler, and Raclette for the cheese and New Glarus Apple Ale for the beer. Mine was a smidge too bitter, but I might have simmered the beer a little too long while greeting guests. It was still tasty with bread, apples, pears, cauliflower, and pretty much everything we dipped in it. Thanks, ScandoGirl!

ABSOLUTELY LOVED!!! Best Cheese Fondue! Don't put too much beer into the mixture--but it was amazing. Making it again tonight!

Why did fondue go out of style? This recipe could single handedly bring it back! So easy and so fun. For fondue fixins' we used broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, sausage, grapes and apples.

Rich flavor and a creamy texture (keep the heat moderate and keep stirring so the mixture doesn't stiffen) made this fondue a party hit with my friends. The surprise was using beer instead of wine.

The beer taste was way too strong. Very disappointing. Maybe chicken broth with a touch of beer next time.

Turned out great. I made a double recipe for 7 people, and there wasn't a drop left after dinner.

Followed the recipe as stated and unfortunately it came out very stiff. Not sure what went wrong, maybe too much corn starch? I'm not sure I'll try this recipe again, the cheeses are just too expensive to not have this work.
