Loved it... Am a fellow Portagee and greatly appreciated this recipe.  The sauce is very spicy/tasty and can be used with other meats as well.  I actually used it with steak and eggs(another Portuguese favorite) and it came out fantastic.  One thing, I thought that marinating the tuna was excessive since the sauce was already so strong.  And for those of you that don't know what 'pimenta moida' is, it's wet, hot, crushed red pepper that comes in a jar... It's critical to the recipe.  A possible substitution could be hot crushed cherry peppers.

This was really good! We will make this again once fresh tuna comes our way. My husband even asked without knowing the name of the recipes-"what makes this taste Portuguese?" Of course the pimenta moida is what I replied. I made one change, I used white wine instead of the vinegar. We served with steamed potatos tossed with garlic, butter and fresh parsley.

I loved this recipe!!  I didn't do the marinade, I actually just made the sauce and poured it on top of my fish just before serving it.  It was a big hit... even with my portuguese mom!

This is wonderfulllllllllllll!!! I had no idea what the "pimenta moida" pepper stuff was but I used red pepper flakes and a dash of chilli powder and called it good. I made potatoes and rice and found it to be perfect with both.  I was slo in a hurry and didn't let the fish sit in the mixture for very long but made the sauce and it added just enough kick!! So yummy!

Blech. Not sure what I did wrong, if it was me. Flavors not good, a lot of work goes into prepping. Sadface.

We've been ordering the pan fried tuna in several local (SE MA) Portuguese restaurants lately. My wife loves it and even though I'm not a fish fan, I like it too. This one comes close to what we've been getting. 
p.s. Best if the tuna is NOT over cooked!
