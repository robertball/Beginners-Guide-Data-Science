I liked this as it is. But I believe the next time I make it, I am going to substitute the Asian pear for pineapple. The main reason is the pineapple has more acidity and will tenderize the meat a bit better than the Asian pear. All in all a very good recipe. I spent 2 years in Korea and this dish brought me back.

My whole family, 3 kids and all said we will have to make this a "regular recipe"!  I couldn't find the Lg Asian pear, so I used a bartlett.  All the asian ingredients were available at the grocery store.  I want to make this again and will hunt for that Asian pear to see if there is a difference.

We enjoyed this, marinated for a full 24 hours.  Great flavor, made up extra sauce to baste with during grilling.

Delicious! I dis not have fresh pears, but had pear vinegar and it tasted so delicious. Meat was so tender it fell off the bone.

These turned out dynamite!  Yet another excellent recipe from Chef John.  If you don't regularly watch his videos, you should!

I made these per the recipe, but I couldn't get an Asian Pear.  After a bit of research, I found that a decent alternative is to use Kiwi. They both have the same enzyme that acts to tenderize the meat.  I am no expert, but I read that Kiwi has a stronger concentration of the enzyme, so doesn't need to marinate as long as with the Asian Pear.   I used 1 and 1/2 Kiwi peeled and quartered.  I went about 8 hours and the meat was nice and tender.  I don't think going 2-4 hours longer would have been any issue.  I can't say how much the Kiwi vs. the Pear changes the flavor profile (must be at least a little), but I think in either case, the kiwi or the pear is a subtle tone to the overall flavor.  The end result didn't taste a lot like kiwi at all.

If you've never tried them, I'd highly recommend it.  Very easy to make and really great flavor.  I also like how they cook very quickly since they are thin, and so no mystery as to whether they are cooked all the way through.  It's hard to screw them up.  Grill over direct medium-high heat and when they look good and charred on both sides, they're done.

Also be sure to follow the directions about drying the meat off after removing from marinade.  I did this, but will do even more thoroughly next time to be sure to get a really nice char.  Hard to get those nice crispy bits when the meat goes on wet.

Very good! The picture showing the rack of ribs shows the wrong kind of ribs for this recipe, though. Those ribs would take way longer than 4 mins per side. You should be getting flanken style ribs as the recipe says. Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious with lots of white rice!

I had twice braised kalbi-style Asian short ribs at Alan Wong’s in Honolulu;  they were boneless and delicious!  

That being said, I like to control the degree of doneness and texture with sous vide.  The braise liquid here is fine, but 72hrs at 56C with a second broil to fix a glaze was perfect.

This was my first recipe that I have used from Chef John.
Everybody loves these, this is my wife's favorite dish, Follow the recipe, it is very important to be sure to pat these down after you marinate the short ribs, The aroma frome the BBQ will bring your guests and friends over to the grill to get a sample before you serve .
The only problem I have had with this recipe is what to substitute when Asain Pears are not in season?

This is the best short rib recipe I’ve found. I’ve tried to just chop up the ingredients and put it in a bag on a lazy day, and compared to making the marinade, it doesn’t even do it justice. The marinade is delicious, and the ribs require no extra seasoning. Perfect!

Used this recipe, but without the pear and sherry wine. Marinated overnight, cooked in the oven at 360 degrees for 20 mins plus my husband put it in the grill just enough to get grill marks and char. Turned out AMAZING! Paired it with grilled corn and rice. Both my girls had second servings and I got 2 thumbs up plus a good head shake from my husband. Safe to say this recipe will be used time and time again!

Fabulous! I followed the ingredient list to the letter BUT I turned the marinade into a braising sauce. I soaked the ribs in cold salted water while I made the sauce. Then browned the ribs in batches in a little oil in a large dutch oven, 
poured off the fat, deglazed the pot with a little water, returned the ribs along with the sauce to the Dutch oven. brought the sauce to a low boil, covered the pot and placed it in a 325 degree oven for 2 and a half hours and stirred it occasionally. Served over rice. It might be good to make it the day before serving and skim more of the fat.
