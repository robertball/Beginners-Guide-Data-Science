We loved this, but I did do a couple changes.  I added the soup mixture to the beef instead of mixing with it the potatoes. My family much preferred it this way.  After reviewing other comments I did add a little more pepper and some season salt.  I also reduced the milk a little and added some sour cream to meat/soup mix.  Nice touch to the flavour.  I also saut√©ed onion and the mushrooms before adding to the meat mix.   A definite keeper to our family menu.

I made some modifications, and it was amazing.  First, I used 1 lb. turkey and 1 lb. ground beef, then I added chopped onion, chopped red bell pepper, minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper to the ground beef and turkey as I cooked it.  I then mashed the potatoes and added to it 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, milk, salt and pepper.  I did not use the second can of Cream of Mushroom to pour over it (did not want it to be soupy). And when I layered it, I had plenty of meat to balance out the meal. I used more Cheddar cheese to cover each layer.  Then I only cooked in oven for 30 minutes.  Let it sit for 15 minutes.  AMAZING!!!

We liked this but a little too bland.  Thought it would be so I added a can of mild green chilies to hamburger. Next time I'll add minced onions & garlic  also to hamburger while cooking. Also use more cheese. I only used 1 large jar of mushrooms & that was plenty.  Left off the French fried onions since I didn't have any.   Will make again with changes. Good middle of the week meal.

I made several modifications. First, I added Lipton onion soup mix (dry package) into the ground beef. Secondly, I left out the mushrooms. Thirdly, I used both ground beef and ground deer (for my wild game-loving husband). Both my husband and his friend who also loves heavy casseroles enjoyed it.

Made this last night for company. Easy to prepare ahead of time and then bake. I like to use these types of "do before hand" so I can visit while it heats in the oven. This dish was okay but very bland. It needed more spice than just salt and pepper. I followed the exact recipe. I will not make this again. It needed something to pep it up.

I follow other reviewers  suggestions of reducing the milk and added an equal amt of sour cream.  I added 1/2 a small can of diced green chilis, some garlic powder, a bit of paprika and onion powder.  I also used a 9x13 pan because there was 1.5# of burger and added extra cheese on the top.  This will most definitely be one of my frequent dishes.  The only thing I'd change is to cut the potatoes in more of a steak fry size vs. just slicing the potato.

Delicious! Good comfort food. Changes I made were browning onions with the meat and I used two beef boullion cubes also. Feeling lazy I used frozen hash browns instead of peeling and slicing. Very good will definitely make again.

This was a very simple recipe to make! As another reviewer stated, "It's much faster using a mandolin to slice the potatoes!"
I also spiced it up a bit. I added: black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder paprika and cayenne pepper to both cans of mushroom soup. I would have added mushrooms but I didn't have any--NEXT TIME!
I did add a can (drained) of corn.
This turned out delicious!

Used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Sauteed onions and then cooked mushrooms and added cream of mushroom and potatoes.   Turned out very good, took longer for potatoes to cook all the way through had to cook for almost 2 hours.  I would turn the heat up next time I cook this maybe to 375.

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use mushrooms (nobody here likes them) and I used French's cheddar flavored fried onions.  I think this actually added some good flavor to the dish.  However, I made this primarily for my kids, and they didn't like it.

The fried onions really make the dish. They add a nice flavor and a satisfying crunch. This is a great way to use hamburger meat that isn't meatloaf or Hamburger Helper. Very tasty.

Super good!  Super easy with a mandolin to thinly slice the potatoes.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms with the hamburger.

I made some modifications after reading the reviews, it turned out awesome! 

I was worried it would be bland, so took some of the other recommendations and sauteed onions and fresh mushrooms together and added some onion soup mix. 

followed everything else as written and it was SOOOO good!

I cooked 2 lbs ground beef. In a separate pot, I cooked potatoes, frozen green beans and frozen carrots together.  I cooked the potatoes too long to the consistency of potato soup.  I drained the water.  Since I cooked the potatoes too long, I had to scoop ‚Äúpotato soup‚Äù out of the sink. I added 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup milk and 2 cans cream of celery soup to the potato veggie mixture. I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder and a seasoning blend. I layered potato mixture, meat and cheese in a casserole dish. I cooked at 350 for 30‚Äù topping with onion rings the last 5 minutes. It was delicious!  Next time I will cook the carrots first, then I‚Äôll add the potatoes, then the green beans. Thanks Theresa for the recipe and to others for adding your ideas.

I added chopped onions to the hamburger as it fried. I also left out the mushrooms. The kids and I loved this dish, and it will now be a regular in our household!

I actually haven't made it yet, but it's JUST what I was looking for. It's 'hamburger' time around here now, since hubby lost his job.  Needed to find something tasty and filling to do with ground beef. Thanks!

I went to make my traditional ham, cheese, and potato casserole with cream of mushroom soup and milk and BAM!!!!! No. Ham. I wanted to cry. I was craving that casserole. So I looked for something that had those ingredients but had something other than ham. I found this. I was skeptical, because we're not too big on hamburger casseroles. I really had no other choice, because I had no other meat. Also, the added mushrooms were iffy... But I shouldn't have worried at all! This was great! There was a great taste and a solid feel, and is great as Man Food. The husband approved, and that's huge in this house. It was filling, which is not the norm for me and hamburger. And the additional mushrooms? Killer! Spot on! Definitely needed! I will (I would submit a picture, but the picture requirements for this site are killing me and I can never find one to fit the size and height/width requirements. ugh...)

Just made for my husband and he loves it. I didn't have cream of mushroom on hand so I used cream of chicken and cream of asparagus. Delicious...

We liked it, I used regular onion in it, didn't have the french fried onions.  Probably added a little more pepper than the recipe called for.  It will be a keeper for me
