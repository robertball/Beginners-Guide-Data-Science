My husband and I loved this, but we made some substitutions along the way, mostly because we cannot afford some of the more expensive ingredients. We used a 5 oz. can of tuna in oil, substituted 1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp. soy sauce for the anchovy paste, put in two large dashes of oregano and red pepper flakes, and added a dash of paprika as well. We also used two cans of Campbell's tomato soup, which is from concentrate, so we made the soup following the directions on the can, then used 3 1/2 cups of that for the sauce, so we didn't add the additional 1/2 cup of water. We substituted pre-grated Parmesan cheese for the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and 1 tsp. marjoram for the tarragon. And to finish, we garnished it with just some of the leftover Parmesan with no red pepper flakes. And although we weren't able to make this recipe exactly how it's supposed to be, we loved what we ended up with and plan to add this recipe to our list of favorites!

I didn't have any soup, so I used homemade chicken stock, a little can of tomato paste and heavy cream with a dash of onion powder. No tarragon, so I used about 1/4 c. fresh basil from the garden instead. It had so much flavor! Don't skip the anchovy, it wasn't fishy at all.

I have to say I didn't really have high hopes for this, as I am not a huge fish person.  But I do like traditional tuna casseroles, and this sounded good and different, so I gave it a go.  WOW!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the tarragon.  I swear I bought some, but somehow I didn't end up with it at home, so I subbed just a dash of fennel instead, which did lend a lovely flavor.  This is surprisingly and amazingly delicious!  The only non-condensed cream of tomato soup I was able to find was a tomato and basil variety, which was wonderful.  I had 4 cups of it, so I added it all, since the only tuna in olive oil I found was in cans, and I had a little over 8 ounces of that as well.  Yum, yum, yum!  Will definitely be making this again and again (and will definitely make sure I get home with the tarragon next time too!).  Thanks Chef John!  :)

Simple and quick to make. I didn't use the Tarragon, but followed the rest of the recipe. Even my husband who when I mentioned can Tuna was like oh I'm not going to like that. He loved it, so did my teenage son. Will defitnaly make again. Oh, and loved the kick that the red pepper flakes gave it.

I am making this for the third time-my husband and I love it, and it's quick, easy and not expensive. Thanks to Chef John I always have Pacific brand organic creamy tomato soup, low sodium version, anchovy fillets, and good quality oil packed tuna on hand so this is almost an "instant" dinner. Throw some frozen peas in with the pasta during the last 5 minutes of cooking for an extra veggie boost. You can also sub wine for the water. Tonight I'm serving it over Barilla brand spinach and cheese tortellini, since I'm out of penne. Thanks again to Chef John for clueing me in to the dry tortellini, they are delicious and handy to have around. I'll be making this with gluten-free pasta when my celiac houseguest arrives in a couple weeks.

Very, very good recipe. Made it according to the directions except for the fact that I could only find tuna in olive oil in 4.5 oz. cans, so I used two. Also, I can't stand not to use all of something, so I used 16 oz. of pasta and entire 32 oz. carton of cream of tomato soup. Everything else according to the original recipe.  So good I'm making it again tomorrow!!

This was a very good recipe and a nice vegetarian option.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used basil and marjoram instead of tarragon, since I didn't have any.  I also used 1/2tsp soy sauce and 1/2tsp Worcestershire sauce instead of anchovy paste.  Everyone I served this to liked it!

this was very good.  but i couldn't leave well enough alone as usual.  i tossed in some green olives for good measure.  also used home made tomato sauce instead of the canned soup, and no tarragon (don't like it).  everything else remained the same. well....no water, i used evaporated milk that needed to be used up.  delicious!

Liking both tomato soup & toasted tuna sandwiches I had high expectations for this dish but was sadly somewhat let down. Maybe my expectations were unrealistic but this dish just didn't measure up as an alternative to the real thing. It isn't that the dish is bad -- far from it -- but that it just doesn't resonate with myself or my family like I had thought.

My two girls thought that it had too much tarragon in it and that that flavor came to dominate the dish. This dish was good enough that I plan on making it again for another try but will cut the tarragon in half. Hopefully we'll like it better and, if so, I'll update my review accordingly.

As a final thought, though, my recommendation is to stick with the soup and sandwiches for that flavor combination instead of this dish.

This is by far my favorite pasta recipe. The boyfriend has been requesting it 3 weekends in a row!

I used 2/3 Campbell Tomato soup, and 1/3 Campbell's Orange Harvest Tomato soup, and it came out a bit sweeter than if I had gone full Tomato soup. I definitely preferred the result!

My kids are 5, 7, & 8.  They loved it and had seconds.  It didn't taste fishy or like tuna, although my kids do like tuna.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer to use 1/2 t. worcestershire sauce and 1/2 t. soy sauce in place of anchovy paste since I didn't have any anchovy paste on hand.  I also made two cans of condensed soup, following the directions for soup with milk.  (I did use half cream & half milk for a richer sauce.)  Then, I used about 3 1/2 cups of this soup in place of the soup and 1/2 c. water called for in the recipe.  I followed the spice measurments in the sauce. When I served the pasta, I sprinkled extra oregano, salt, and chili flakes on each plate according to my kids' and husband's different tastes.  Excellent!

This is very tasty, I didn't have fresh garlic or anchovy, or tarragon, so I used garlic powder, and wasabi (don't ask me why)  and I used my left over homemade tomato soup.  Excellent, nice flavors, next time I will make sure I have all the ingredients and make it as per the recipe.  Easy and quick

I added a 1/2 cup Chardonnay instead of water and a tsp soy sauce vs. anchovy paste! Excellent dish. I happened to have everything for this recipe on a night when I had nothing else in my refrigerator. The most delicious clean up kitchen meal I've ever had!!!

I have made a similar recipe like this for years -- instead of the liquids/seasonings, I use a jar of spaghetti sauce -- I salute onions and garlic, add tuna, then add sauce and cheese.  A staple at our house - one of my family's favorite meals!

Fantastic recipe!  The best part is how quick and easy it is to make but still upholds a gourmet meal flavor and quality.  Stick with the recipe.  I followed the recommendations of the video by using tuna with jalapeno in olive oil out of the jar.  It's worth the money (about $8 and can be found in any grocery store), as well as cream of tomato soup out of the box, not the can!  I buy the organic kind, tastes much better than canned IMO.  The only thing I changed is I leave out the anchovie paste only because I don't have it.  Otherwise, it's perfect as is and delicious!  Thanks Chef John!

I had some real trouble finding the amounts in the recipe at the store, so I fudged a few things. 2 cans of tuna in olive oil came out to 9oz and the 2 cans of tomato bisque came out to 28oz and the penne was 12oz. With the extra tuna I halved the anchovy paste. In all both my DH and I loved the recipe. I also threw in a can of sweet corn and used the "veggie" penne to add some more veggie servings. Can't wait to make this for company. So quick and easy.

This is such a great an easy recipe to make if you are trying to clean out your pantry or you are a day or two away from going to the grocery store! We ended up using bowtie pasta (because we needed to use it) and tuna in water (again, we needed to use it) but just added a little olive oil and oregano.

This was great!  I used half jarred Alfredo & half jarred tomato basil sauces.  Added a little EVOO since I only had lemon pepper tuna in packs on hand.  Topped it off with grated  parmesan reggiano.   Very quick & easy.  Will definitely make again!

I love Chef John, but this disappointed me.  My partner still eats like it’s 1975 (Campbell’s soup and white bread), so I thought this a great compromise meal.  I used the best ingredients, which made it a very expensive meal, but it tasted like pasta, tomato soup and tuna.  I could have used cheap canned tuna, Campbell’s soup, Kraft Parmesan, left out the anchovy paste and tarragon and achieve a similar result.

This was shockingly good!  I made a "double" batch:  two cans of solid albacore tuna in water, drained (don't like the extra sodium or taste in tuna packed in olive oil) and cooked in just one TB olive oil. I then kind of just doubled everything from there. Grated a small block of asiago because it's all I had and sadly had to use dried tarragon but STILL AWESOME.  We had no leftovers.  Thank you SO much for this recipe! We will use it a lot!

I had high hopes for this recipe but was disappointed.  .Maybe I did something wrong but I thought it was bland. Didn't have anchovy paste but did as other reviewers did.  Also used Pacific brand organic creamy tomato soup. This was good but I was hoping for excellent.  Will try again.

With the exception I made cream of fresh tomato soup using the recipe on AR I followed the recipe exactly. The anchovy paste lends such an amazing flavor, and if you try to substitute anything in its place you'll miss out on the depth it brings to this dish. Perfectly delicious!!!

Needing to use up some stuff in the fridge and looking for a quick meal this recipe fit the bill.    I added a few fresh diced tomatoes and a minced jalapeno to the sauce so I subbed chili powder and dried cilantro for the tarragon.  I think the spiciness balanced the sweet soup nicely and overall we enjoyed this (my BF hates tomato soup), but it isn't something I'd make again

This is good and simple. Only change we made was subbing Worcestershire and soy sauces for anchovy paste, recommended by another reviewer, as didn't have any paste.  The red pepper flakes help this recipe a lot if you prefer some zip.

I did substitude the cream of tomato since I didn't have any at home. I made the sauce with two cups of water, tomato paste and added coconut milk since I'm lactose intolerant. The sauce turned out to be a little runny for my taste, but that was probably my fault. I also added chard to the sauce to make it a little healthier. I liked the state, and it was very filling.

Just tried this for the first time and eating it as I write this.

I'm not that good of a cook but this is fairly simple and it turned out great. This is a keeper and I plan to make this one more often.

Great recipe.  Substituted 1/2 cup water with one 14oz can undrained diced tomatoes and added basil.
