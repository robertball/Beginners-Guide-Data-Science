3 stars using this recipe ~ definitely lacked flavor.  Please note:  This recipe is not for the faint hearted or calorie conscious.  There are ways to lighten it up as other reviewers have suggested but it's 5 stars with the following modifications.  1.)  Use linguini noodles vs spaghetti cooked al dente as the noodles still have to bake.  2.)  Use turkey in this timeless dish, plus it's a good way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers.  3.)  Never use canned mushrooms - Ugh!  Baby brown bellas and white  buttons work beautifully.  Saute 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1 small minced onion, and 1 tsp of fresh thyme leaves in butter.  Add 1/2 cup of a GOOD white wine and let simmer.  Once the liquid from the mushrooms/wine evaporate, set mushroom mixture aside.  4.)  When making the sauce, add 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of white pepper, and 1 tsp of nutmeg, plus 2 cups milk to the cream and chicken broth for a more sophistacted sauce.  Let simmer for 10 + minutes until sauce thickens.  5.)  Add the sauce, mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, 3/4 cup frozen peas and 1/4 cup of Italian parsley (flat leaf parsley) to the noodles and stir until the noodles are evenly coated.  6.)  Transfer to a baking dish.  Mix 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese and 1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs and spread over the top of the noodles.  Dot with butter and bake as directed.  FYI - this dish freezes well...  With the modifications, this is a flavorful dish more true to the original that will have guests begging for more....  Enjoy!

This was a big hit in my house.  It is a great make ahead dish you can pop in the oven when you get home.  I highly recommend substituting lowfat evaporated milk for the heavy cream.  It is still plenty rich and satisfying.  I got away with only using 3 Tbsp. butter to make my roux and omitted the salt altogether.  I cooked the mushrooms with some chopped onion and garlic in a little olive oil before adding into the mixture.  I increased the chicken broth to 1-1/2 cups based on other reviews and this amount was perfect.  I also increased the sherry to 3 Tbsp.  Once the mixture was in the casserole dish I sprinkled some italian herb seasoning and fresh ground pepper over the top.  Another variation that is good is to add some grated cheese to the roux after adding in the chicken broth and milk.  It works really well with about 1/2 cup of any type of cheese you have on hand (cheese blends work really well).  Yummy!

This was so creamy and flavorful! I cooked the chicken in about 1 TBS of olive oil, and then made the roux in the same pan to catch all of the yummy drippings. I also added about 4 cloves of minced garlic, as well as a small chopped onion to the sauce (it was still bubbling so cooked the onion nicely.) I used low-fat evaporated milk (in place of cream) and I also used fresh mushrooms. The evaporated milk tastes great, by the way, and normally I prefer to use real cream! At first, it is essentially a really rich gravy. I put the spaghetti in a casserole pan, poured the sauce over it (and chicken,) and mixed it together. After putting it in the oven for 25 minutes, the "gravy" had thickened and it was more casserole-like. Will definitely make over and over! I disagree with other reviewers who said it lacked flavor, or the sherry was overpowering, etc. etc. The flavors were great.

I have made this recipe many times over the years and my family loves it, with a few changes.

I prefer to use kluski noodles rather than spaghetti, it really does make a huge difference.  I also add additional seasonings....garlic and onion esp.  I also make extra sauce to keep it moist and yummy.  This dish freezes wonderfully and I think is even better after frozen.  When I make it, I usually double or even triple the recipe and then have several containers in my freezer for a quick meal or to give away to friends.  Everyone loves it.  But honestly, try the kluski noodles, you won't be disappointed.

This was wonderful!  I broke the spaghetti in thirds, and as a time saver, used 3 pre-cooked seasoned chicken breasts.  I added some more flavor to my recipe:  I sauteed 1 cup chopped onion, 1 chopped bell pepper, 1 cup sliced *fresh* mushrooms, and 1 clove garlic in 1/2 Tbl. butter first, then added all that to the already thickened sauce.  For the sauce, I used 1 1/2 cups chicken broth + 1 cup skim milk + 1/2 cup fat-free half-and-half, which are the measurements I got from a similar recipe (other reviewers mentioned that you need to double the sauce, but I didn't want to double the flour and butter part).  Also, I think 1/4 cup parmesan was plenty.  Turned out great!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This came out really good, but I did modify it a lot. I used fresh sliced mushrooms (instead of canned) and sauteed with olive oil and garlic. I  then added the cooked chicken and sauteed a few minutes to give it some extra flavor. Also, I love tetrazzini with ham, so I added about a cup of diced ham to the mushroom/chicken mixture. I promise the ham makes the recipe SO much more tasty! After mixing all of the ingredients and pouring into the baking dish, I sprinked shredded cheddar (almost a full bag) on top of the parm. cheese. My mom always uses cheddar and I couldn't imagine tetrazzini without it. It's definitely NOT a low fat recipe (I'm sure it could be modified with something other than heavy cream), but if you're not trying to count calories, it's delicious.

thanks to previous reviews, i increased the amount of sauce by half the first time i made it. i think that next time though i am going to double it. the flavor though was EXCELLENT! i added some garlic powder with herbs and some shredded mozzarella and parmeson to the sauce. then for the topping i mixed shredded mozzarella and seasoned bread crumbs with the parmeson for the topping. it was great!

Very good.  I used skim  milk to make a lower fat version.  Fresh mushrooms are also a nice touch.

This was really good. Tatsed like alfredo, but with a nice mushroom flavor. I used fresh mushrooms and sauted them beforehand instead of canned mushrooms and it turned out nicely.

This was good...but a little bland for our taste...I think next time I will add a little more garlic and pepper...good base though!

Very good base recipe!  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, because I made so many changes to the recipe. My version will definitely go into the regular rotation at our house, as even my 20 month old son loved it! I roasted 2 chicken breast halves in the oven, and then diced them up, and I think it came out to more than 2 cups of meat.  Also added diced ham as one other reviewer suggested, and it was a great addition. I used extra wide egg noodles instead of spaghetti (easier for my toddler to eat), and made sure to cook them VERY al dente since the dish also has baking time. I sauteed two minced cloves or garlic, one diced yellow onion, and a package of fresh sliced brown mushrooms in olive oil. Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (the REAL stuff), maybe about 1 1/2 cups, and stirred it into the cream sauce after adding the sherry. To assemble I mixed the chicken, diced ham, egg noodles, cream sauce, and the sauteed mushroom mixture all in a big bowl. Divided between two 8x8 dishes (one for the freezer), and topped with some fresh breadcrumbs. Baked as directed. DELICIOUS!!!

This was really good, I doubled it...only complaint was it was sticky creamy if you know what I mean so I would cut back on the flour a little next time (1 stick butter, 6 T. flour).  Very filling and I did add some garlic and a few other spices to jazz it up.  This is a staple.  Thanks!!

I'm sorry it took so long for me to review this recipe. I have made this countless times over the last couple of years and it is the BEST tetrazzini I've ever eaten.  The only thing I do differently is add more sherry and use fresh mushrooms instead of canned. My family loves it and I get recipe requests EVERY time I serve it to guests.  It has become a family staple.

FABUILOUS recipe!  I made the following adjustments: I sauteed a bag of fresh spinach with a clove of garlic and added to the spaghetti and chicken.  I also added a hint of nutmeg to the sauce, this received UNBELIEVABLE rave reviews at my sons birthday party!

Tastes great even with my usual modifications to reduce fat. Fat Free half and half works great (sometimes using a little flour or cornstarch added) in place of cream in any recipe. Portabella mushrooms have marvelous flavor and I put garlic in most dishes as well.  Smoked or regular Salmon works well as another option.

I added some tiny broccoli florets and had extra Parmesan on the table. It did have a very nice Alfredo flavor. Grand kids loved it. There were no leftovers!

This was my first time ever making tetrazzini and it couldn't have been simpler.  I tweaked the recipe by doubling the chicken broth, flour and sherry for more sauce and by adding some garlic powder to it.  Instead of canned mushrooms, I sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms in garlic, butter and sherry before mixing them in.

One of the best Tetrazzinis!
I added a little more butter, sauted onion & mushrooms in the butter. Then added the flour, salt & pepper and let that cook for a few minutes. Then slowly added the broth, then the cream, slowly brought to a boil, then added the sherry. EXCELLENT recipe, fast and full of flavor! This is a keeper (and my husband doesn't even like mushrooms!)

Wow, this was absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to buy fresh baby portabello mushrooms and saute them in 2 tablespoons of butter seperately and then add them in when the recipe called for them.  My husband went nuts for this recipe, it was amazing!

YUMMY!!!  This recipe is absolutely perfect as is!  I've made it twice now & both times my husband & I have thoroughly enjoyed it (perhaps too much). Very easy & yummy! ETA This has become a regular staple in our menu planning.  It is delicious!

I've made this so many times and each time it's a hit.  It's my "company's coming" or potluck standby. I use fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned and I cook them in the sherry beforehand.  I usually add a bit more sherry to the sauce as well.  It adds some kick but is not overpowering.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

I am going to do something that I don't like....write changes to the recipe.  I did use the recipe as is but added a few things because the sauce can be bland and I used what I had in the house.
 
I added lightly sauteed celery like in Stouffers microwave turkey tetrazzini.  I like the added texture and flavor it brings.  I also use Jane's Crazy salt, key ingredient to almost anything!  Plus some thyme since it goes well w/the Sherry.  I was a little heavier on the Sherry.  I used linguini instead of spaghetti.   I make this recipe to use the leftover roasted chicken that I buy from the supermarket deli.  The roasted flavor w/the spices they use to bake in the chicken enhances the flavor of the sauce so much and the chicken is really tender.    

This is such a great comfort food and once it's made it is great for leftovers.  So nice to come home and pop it in the microwave and have a decent meal.  I usually have a side salad w/it.  It can get dry so I add a little milk or water when necessary.

Wow..this is really good! I made a few changes. I didn't add the sherry or the mushrooms. Right before I put it in the oven, I put butter all over the top. This way it doesn't make the top noodles hard. Five Stars!

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I used a rotisserie chicken for the meat and substituted fat-free half and half for the heavy cream.  My daughter doesn't like mushrooms, so I used frozen petite peas instead.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  Reminded me of my Mom's Chicken Tetrazzini.  We do not eat mushrooms, as my husband is allergic, but other than that I made the recipe exactly as is.  *Everyone* liked this dish - which is saying something in our house!

Okay....I am giving this 5 stars b/c I think the flavor is phenomenal but I did alter it a bit so maybe I should give it 4.  Here's what I did:    1) I used a variety of pasta to use up what I had, it was still yummy 2) Roux- added more flour & a little less salt 3) Increased chicken broth to 1 1/2 cups (homemade), 1 cup skim milk + 1/2-1 cup (not sure exactly) evaporated milk in place of heavy cream, increased to 3 T sherry  4) Sauteed fresh mushrooms w/ garlic, onion, and olive oil 5) Mixed mushroom mixture, with rotisserie chicken, noodles, tossed in a little extra fresh asiago cheese... I was so excited for supper b/c it smelled and tasted phenomenal and super creamy....   Then I put in oven...  Here's my biggest tip.  It got a LOT drier once I baked it (and I even covered it after I saw that it was).  It was still good but I was disappointed b/c the texture was PERFECT in the skillet.  Soooo I would say if you are going to bake it, make more sauce and add more liquid.  OR just eat it fresh from the skillet- that's how I'm making it next time.  It was awesome that way.  The oven dried it out a lot...and I prefer it creamier.  But that's just me.    A 5 for flavor for sure!!!!!!!!!    Thanks for an awesome base recipe. :)

I never change a recipe when I first try it to be fair to the submitter, so I tried it twice, submitter's way and my way and my way won. Great basic recipe with a few MINOR changes.  Only broke spaghetti in half. Added about 1/3 cup parmesan and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to sauce mixture. First time I made it, I found it to be a little too sticky so the second time I added the full can of chicken broth.  Used turkey because I prefer it in this classic dish. Used an 8 oz. box of fresh mushroom, sauteed over high heat in butter and sprinkled with garlic salt. This made a big difference. Canned mushrooms are like little rubber things. Also, made croutons for topping: cut crusts off 4 slices of white bread, cut the bread in cubes. Melted 3 T butter or margarine and tossed the bread cubes in the margarine then placed them over the casserole and grated extra parmesan over the bread cubes.  They come out lightly browned and crunchy. A nice addition and keeps the spaghetti from getting a hard crust when baking. Thanks for sharing a great recipe submitter!

My husband and I thought this was fantastic.  I doubled the sauce after reading some of the reviews, and I'm glad I did.  My kids weren't too fond of it, but I have no idea why.  I would definitely make this again!

This was very yummy.  I had to turn up the heat to medium to get the sauce to come to a low boil.  I might try it with bowtie pasta next time.

Yum! Husband is on his second helping as I write this review. I sauteed my chicken breasts and seasoned them to my liking. In a separate pan, I sauteed fresh mushrooms with my normal seasonings. I made the sauce following the recipe fairly closely, however, I needed to add some extra pepper, garlic/onion powders, and as I do with all my cream sauces, a pinch or two of nutmeg. I was honestly short on time and didn't want to heat up the house by turning on the oven, so after everything was done, I mixed everything together in the pot I boiled the spaghetti in, and added a few shakes of lemon pepper and a good handful of parmesan cheese right on top. Next time, I'll use half and half instead and use more than a cup. The sauce thickened up a tad too much for my preference, but that's an easy fix for next time. I'll also add some  petite sweet peas or broccoli next time. In my opinion, this dish doesn't even need the oven!

This was an awesome recipe! Much better then alfredo sauce because you can heat up left overs and it is good the next day. I added fresh garlic, used fresh mushrooms, and red peppers for color. I will definately make this again and again

Very good dish. Used too much pasta which resulted in the dish being a little dry. Added green peas, minced garlic and white onion. Will definitely make again.

This was very good.  I didn't have Sherry, so I subbed Rose wine, and I topped with seasoned panko bread crumbs.  Next time I will add chopped celery and onions.  Really good comfort food that allowed me to use leftover chicken from the night before - so it was economical too.  Since there are only two of us, I see myself making this as a second meal any time I do a roast chicken because we always have leftovers and I want to economize where I can.  Highly recommend.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was delicious, with a few minor changes.  I substituted Almond milk for the heavy cream to make  it a bit lighter.  I also used fresh mushrooms and omitted the sherry.  I was concerned that it would be kind of bland, but the pepper and parmesan flavor it nicely, without it being too strong.  

I'll probably make this again, possibly using rotisserie chicken for convenience.

I have made a stovetop version of this that I really like. This was pretty good, but took longer than the stovetop version.  A couple things that I changed. Once the butter was melted, I added 1/4 cup fine chopped celery and 1/4 cup fine chopped onion (shallots would be really good too).  Once those were tender, I added 8 oz sliced mushrooms and cooked until tender.  I omitted the canned mushrooms.  These things increased the cook time but really do a lot for the flavor.

The sauce is awesome. I finally found the base I've been looking for to make the perfect alfredo sauce!!!

I added some onions to the chicken as well as 2 tbs dried parsley and a wee bit of sherry as it was cooking. I will also add pimentos like my mother in law does to her terrazzini (the hubby loves it). Next time I will leave out the onion, its not needed at all. The sauce fantastic!

I have a large family so I added a cup of chicken (3 breast total).  Instead of boiling the chciken, I baked it for about 35-40 minutes at 350.  I had drizzeled olive oil on the breast and sprinkled garlic salt and fresh ground black  pepper. I doubled the recipe for the white sauce and used linguini noodles.  My family has requested that I make this dish again!!  Thank you Mary!

I am giving this recipe a 4 because I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  However, it is a GREAT base to start for your own personal tastes.  I followed the recipe but I also added ham and garlic. I also added peas, although broccoli would have been better but I didn't have any.  Great recipe, thanks

My new husband told me he hates the flavor of leftover turkey, so after Thanksgiving I thought I would tempt him with my childhood favorite. I kept everything the same but used whole milk instead of cream as it was all I had. It still turned out great and my husband and his brothers raved about this recipe. He typically reaches for the salt after my cooking but didn't with this.  Thanks.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!  I change very little, and it doesn't tell you how to cook the chicken, but that's easy enough to figure out.  I use fresh mushrooms - about a whole package of sliced button mushrooms.  I sautee them with the chicken in onions and minced garlic - the last few minutes before the chicken is done.  I also, as with most recipes on this site, double the sauce and cheese.  Thank you SO much for the recipe!!

doubled the sauce recipe like everyone suggested also added peas and season salt.  Rave reviews!  Someone posted to use grated parmesan cheese instead of shredded fresh parmesan.  Valuable tip!!  I use fresh shredded parm and really wanted to use it on this so I put fresh parm on 1/4 and grated on the rest.  The fresh parm didnt brown and just blended into the top instead of making a crust kind of topping.

This was actually really good. I used the wrong sherry and it was way too strong but that was my fault. I made the sauce a couple days before and when we were ready to have it, I just cooked the pasta - added it to the sauce and baked it

This is the first time I tried making a tetrazzini recipe and I'm so glad I did! This dish was outstanding. I fully cooked the chicken(seasoned with a no-salt blend of spices)in a bit of olive oil first, removed it from the pan, then added fresh, sliced mushrooms to the skillet and sauteed them. I then deglazed the skillet with a bit of sherry while the mushrooms were still in it.(yummy) I added a bit of parmesan cheese to the sauce, as well as a dash or 2 of nutmeg, and an extra bit of sherry too. The end result was delicious! I sprinkled fresh, minced parsley over all and served. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Absolutely decadent! Just be sure that you use 
GRATED parmesan, not shredded (like I did, oops) as it won't melt, and will dry out on top of the casserole. Still tastes good but hard to chew.

I loved this recipe.  It was easy to make and turned out very tasty.  It reheats very well too.  I used it for my lunch at work for a week and it was delicious every time.  Highly recommended.

Great Basic recipe. Made for second time. Original recipe is not quite enough sauce for our liking so modified a little.  1 17oz package of spaghetti will fill a 13x9x2 baking dish. I Melted 2/3 cup butter, added 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper and 1/3 cup flower. Then added one 10pz can cream of chicken soup and 1.5 cups heavy whipping cream, 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1/4 cup sherry (white wine works great too). Sautéed 1 whole medium onion and 4 cloves garlic in 1/8 cup olive oil, salt and pepper. Added to cream mixture along with 1 1/2 cups leftover pulled chicken and two handfuls of fresh spinach. Mix all together. I Sprinkled grated parmesan on top as it made the dish a little too salty the first time. Baked for 20 minutes. Delicious!

Very tasty! I sauteed a package of fresh mushrooms, 2 cloves of garlic and a chopped red bell pepper in a pat of butter. Then I substituted the heavy cream with one half heavy cream and one half fat free half and half. Then I mixed everything together.  The fresh mushrooms were wonderful.  I can't even stand the smell of mushrooms in a jar and the bell pepper gave it some color. I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes for some zing.  I will make this again!!

AMAZING.  I swapped out the sherry for some white wine because it was all I had and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life.

My interest in trying this was twofold.  The sherry and cream sounded reallly good.  I had not made tetrazzini in ages so it was something different for a change.  DH was impressed and wants to have it again.  So be it!

This is a wonderful way to use cooked chicken. It is rich, creamy and decadent.
A winner in my books!

Delicious- but I used a package of sliced mushrooms (tried it once with regular mushrooms and once with baby bella- both great).  I also doubled the recipe- I like it to be creamy, and think it can dry out in the oven if you don't.  I sauteed garlic, mushrooms and fresh spinach- drained it then added to the dish.  It was absolutely delicious.

This was Great!  The only thing I added (because I did not have a full cup of Parmesan Cheese) was add 1/2 cup of Parmesan (that I had) and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese.  It turned out GREAT!!!!  Will make it again and again!

I made this exactly per the recipe, and everything seemed to come out as intended. I'm only giving it three stars because as written, this is very bland. It needs serious flavor. Seems like a good base,so I'll probably try again with mods to add favor.

This is absolutely wonderful.  I took one reviewers suggestion and sauteed onions and garlic with the mushrooms.  Also used a whole 14 oz can of chicken broth.  I didn't have any sherry, but added 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese to the mixture.  Will definitely make again.

I used 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, no sherry, sauteed fresh mushrooms in olive oil and 1 clove garlic, added cheese and Italian seasoning to the roux at the end while it was bubbly, and then the biggest difference was that I added chopped up bacon slices.  This was simply divine.  One of the best dishes I've ever had- tip top restaurant quality!

We all loved this!  It was absolutely delicious!  I added more chicken broth as suggested, and used half and half.  When my kids ALL agree that something is delicious,  it is a great accomplishment for me.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe :)

Love it! After reading some of the reviews before I made it I was concerned that it might need more taste... So I also flavored the chicken when I cooked it, added garlic powder, and used fresh mushrooms. Also, you can taste it before baking it to check flavor. This will be a recipe we bring to the table all of the time!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  Next time I would saute and add onions and green peppers.  Also, the sauce tasted great, but dried up a little in the oven.  I would make 1/2 recipe more of the sauce.

I've made this a couple of times now, once doubling the sauce, and it was delicious either way.  I use fresh mushrooms and add 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg that really gives it a good flavor. The last time I made this, I used fat free half n half and it was still great.

This recipe is a keeper ! Wish I had seen more reviews ,as I did have to make a second batch of sauce as it was dry . The second time around I made a sauce of butter ,flour,chicken stock , milk ,parmesan grating, & thickened it with corn starch & poured  it over & stuck it in the oven for 5 mins. Served it with roasted chicken from the same site. Great recipe Thank you !

Made a few changes - boiled 1 lb fresh mushrooms with chicken breast and used instead of canned. Added some garlic powder as well.  Doubled the sauce and it turned out just right.  If the sauce had not been doubled, the caserole would have been very dry.  This is why I gave it 4 stars.  The taste was very good.  Will make again.

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  I use fresh mushrooms, halfnhalf rather than cream, and florentine it with some chopped spinach.  It is really good that way.  Makes it look pretty, too.

Very good!  I used fresh mushrooms that I sauteed in a little olive oil and some sherry (so good they alomst didn't make it into the Tetrazzini!)  I also used fat free half & half instead of heavy cream.  I found the sauce a little thick with only 1 cup, so I ended up using more like 1 1/2 cups.

I used fresh mushrooms as some others have done - just sauteed them in the butter at the beginning, adding the flour and continuing with the recipe as written. The sherry is a delicious touch. My mother always used to make tetrazzini with leftover chicken and turkey - her recipe included blanched almonds. I think I will try adding some almonds next time I make this - they add a nice crunch to the tetrazzini. This was so easy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, however, I found the chicken to be bland.  Next time I will flavor the chicken with garlic or onion just to add a little spice.

I made this when I couldn't get a hold of my mother's recipe (which i love).  I really liked it, but i did change a few things. I replaced the cream with whole milk and used 1.5 c. of broth and of milk.  The only thing i didn't really like was the layer of cheese on the top, i kinda found it a little strong - maybe next time i'll use less or mix it in or just leave it out.  Mixing peas in sounds like it might be a good idea too, although i've never had chicken tetrizzini that way.

I made this dish last night.  I must say it was very good.  I added a small jar of pimientos, 1 chopped green bell pepper, 1/4 cup onion, and 1 large clove of garlic.  My husband loved it.  I will most  definitely make this again.

This was good but I had to add a lot to spice it up for our tastes. We added more cheese, garlic, onion, and omitted the mushrooms.

Excellent!! So good in fact, that my husband bought the ingredients the next morning so he can make it at the firestation where he works...
Now the firemen's wives are calling me to get it.  Only thing I did different was add a can of sweet peas to mixture.

YUMMY!  This recipe was fantastic.  I tried it with added fresh sauteed spinch and fresh mushrooms as another reviewer suggested and it was amazing.  I am a novice cook and as complicated as this recipe looked, it was SO easy to make.  This is definately a keeper!

This is the best tetrazzini I have ever tasted.  I took the advise from other reviewers and doubled the sauce.  I added a box of frozen peas to my pasta water and sauteed my chicken with garlic and fresh mushrooms.  I added a little thyme for some extra zip.  Definately a keeper!

Absolutely fabulous!!  I also made extra sauce (though not doubleing).  I hope my family doesn't get tired of it because I seem to keep making it...  Thanks!!

I made this for my in-laws and boy did I get brownie points:)  This was so easy and delicious.  I read some of the other comments before making, so I halved the pasta and added garlic for kick and pimentos for color.  It was definitely a keeper.

After reading the reviews,I automatically doubled the chicken broth to make it saucier.I also sauteed the chicken in olive oil and minced garlic to give it some punch.It turned out wonderful! Tasty and hearty,I'll definitely make this a signature dish!

Have made this a couple of times and I just love it. I did double the sauce and made it with penne tonight. The sherry adds a nice crisp flavor. Fresh mushrooms are a must. Who wouldn't love this!

Very good but needed a few changes.  Used linguine instead of spag noodles.  Used regular milk instead of heavy cream.  Sauteed fresh mushrooms with 1/2 diced onion and 2 cloves of minced garlich instead of just canned mushrooms.  Used a bit of red pepper flakes just to add a bit of heat as a personal preference.  It was great!!

This was AMAZING--creamy, tasty, and satisfying. The only thing I did differently was use fat-free half & half instead of cream and I used fresh mushrooms. The sherry taste comes through in a sweet but subtle way. YUM.

Easy and quite tasty.  Covered the casserole dish and baked the left-overs the following day and it was still delicious and satisfying.  I cooked the chicken in olive oil, garlic and basil which added another flavor element to the dish; otherwise followed the directions and ingredients exactly and it turned out beautifully.

I didn't use Sherry and used Half and Half instead of heavy cream.  It was very good.  I also, used more cheese than was called for and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

This was creamy & delicious!  After reading reviews I altered by: 2 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of 2% milk, stirred 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese into mixture before baking-didn't add to top, no mushrooms,  used 8 ounces of bow tie noodles and turkey instead of chicken!  I also sauté some onion, celery & green pepper in the butter.  A definite keeper!

I made this tonight for the family. Let me just say it is a very savory dish. With all the cream, butter, and cheese, it's not the most healthy of main dishes, but hey, if you eat most of the week healthy, you can afford to indulge in this magnificence. It wasn't hard to make at all and the timing was right around an hour from prep to finish just like the directions stated.I made no changes to the recipes and followed the instructions to the letter. The whole family loved it! My wife, my 5 year old girl, and even my 10 month old kept opening her mouth to be fed this stuff! She never does that! Give this Chicken Tetrazzini a shot and you wont be sorry. This dish has now become one of our favorites and we will probably eat it bi-weekly from this point on.

I tweaked this just a little by sauteing an 8oz pkg of white button mushroom and half a small diced onion and adding it to the sauce.  I also used whole milk instead of heavy cream.  Two previously cooked chicken breasts, sliced thin, added more than enough meat for our familly.  I skip the baking step because I was in a hurry and my kids were hungry.  I'm sure the baking would have finished it off nicely but it was good without it too.  Last, I splashed in a little more chicken broth at the end once I dumped in the spaghetti and chicken because it was so thick I couldn't stir.  All in all, this was a tasty, satisfying dish that I will make again.

Great recipe, but I did make some adjustments like instead of heavy cream I used a small container of sour cream and a can of cream of chicken. But what made the real difference was I add a jar of chopped pimentos. I will be adding this to my recipe box.

This is a very good recipe for left overs.  I made a few changes. I used half and half and skim milk instead of heavy cream and I added 2 cloves of garlic minced, 1/8 t. onion powder, 1/4 cup parmasean, 1/2 cup of mexican blend shredded cheese, and 4 T. sherry instead of the two it called for to the sauce. I also doubled the chicken using the leftover roasted chicken from dinner the night before.  The result was a creamy, flavorful, hearty, chicken casserole.   My finicky family loved it...even with the mushrooms.

This was very good. I seasoned the chicken and sauteed then I took fresh garlic clove, mushrooms and onion and cooked in the same pan. I doubled the sauce and used both Sherry and White wine. It was delicious!! My 2 teen sons & hubby devoured it. This will be added to the monthly menu!!

Totally awesome, I know there is an easy way to make this with just adding canned condensed soups but why the heck would you do that when you have a recipe so simple as this and this was absolutely a great dish!  I used up my left over chicken and had a great meal.  Definately a keeper.   Just a side note I made this all gluten and dairy free.

Very good, but needs a little more flavor. I added some garlic powder and parmasen cheese to the mixture. I also topped it with panko crumbs melted in butter.

This is not bad, with some tweaks. I used fresh mushrooms and browned them beforehand with some butter, garlic and white wine. The sauce was extremely thick so I thinned with additional chicken broth, and it was very bland so I added onion powder and garlic powder. I used half and half and less parmesan to save some fat. This was enjoyable enough but probably won't be a repeat recipe for me. Thanks anyway for the recipe.

Very yummy! This is the first time I successfully made a white sauce :~) I followed the directions exactly for the sauce, except I doubled it after reading other reviews. I used an organic linguini (garlic and chive seasoned) and it was great. I always use fresh mushrooms. canned vege's are low in nutrition and have no flavor. I also sauteed onions and fresh minced garlic.  I will make this again, thanks for sharing!

A nice diversion from the same 'ole dinner recipes. I suggest making 1.5 of the sauce so that it's not dry. I  enjoy cooking with Sherry so this was a nice dish!

This was great! I made it vegetarian by omitting the chicken and adding diced celery and extra fresh mushrooms (and I used veggie broth). I also added two garlic cloves and doubled the sherry. YUMMY!

I have made this a few times and tonight I made it with whole wheat flour & I have to say that I think it is the best one yet!  I won't buy white flour anymore so I didn't have a choice & truly wasn't sure how it would turn out with the wheat flour-I was just nervous about that. But WOW I highly recommend it!  Now to find a healthy substitute for the butter and the cream... :)

I followed the advice of others and used fresh baby bella mushrooms, sauteed with garlic, onion, and red bell pepper and I still think this is no great shakes.  I ended up adding chopped ham and romano cheese to give it a lift.  I should have known it would be very bland but had the ingredients and couldn't resist.  I can't give it more than 2 stars with all the doctoring up it needs just to be edible.

Yum-my! I doubled the recipe and used the evap milk instead of cream, plenty of chicken stock, 1 lb of spaghetti noodles broken into 3rds, sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms, garlic and onion and held aside until later, Parmesan in the roux, bread crumbs and Parmesan on top, chopped leftover turkey... it made 2 large casseroles and my family feasted on this so rich, so tasty, so comforting meal.

The best part about this recipe was how quick and easy it was to make!  I got a phone call that someone was coming for dinner in 45 minutes...that's exactly how long it took to make this.  I used 1 large chicken breast - cubed and cooked in olive oil and butter.  Meanwhile I sauteed 1/2 a chopped onion, 2 cloves of chopped garlic, and the mushrooms in some butter in a separate pan.  When the chicken was done, I removed it from the pan and added a little more butter - then mixed in the flour.  I upped the sherry to 2 Tbs.  After adding the broth and cream I added a good handful of shredded colby jack cheese.  After putting in the baking dish, I sprinkled with Italian breadcrumbs that I had browned in some butter.

Very good recipe.  Easy, easy, easy.  I doubled the 'cream sauce' as suggested and am glad that I did.  I also added bread crumbs to the top while baking and that added a lot of flavor.  My 'secret' ingredient...added a  pinch of fresh nutmeg to cream sauce.  Will def make again. Yum!

Loved it! I didn't have any sherry but plan to make it with it next time since other reviews said to increase it for better taste. Tasted great without it too though! :)

Delicious! A little bland, so I added garlic and a medley of Italian spices. I also used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream, didn't have wine to cook with, and did not have time to bake it. Even so, it was great!

This was just OK.  It really needs something.  Maybe fresh veggies added to the noodles and chicken.  None of the family found it "bad" just not great.

Enjoyable! I was looking for something different to do with left over chicken and found this recipe. Delicious comfort food which can be changed up a bit to your liking. I would however stick with the measurements noted. I added peas for a little color, used whole wheat rotini pasta and replaced the heavy cream with fat free half and half. Very good with a tossed salad.

Sauteed about 2T garlic, a whole diced white onion and one package of fresh mushrooms in the butter.  Once onions were soft, I added the flour and stirred to coat.  Then I added the chicken broth and fat free 1/2 and 1/2 (instead of the cream).  Cooked until thick and then added the chicken and sherry.  Then I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Yummy!!!  Lots of flavor and not so fattening...thanks!

This is definitely a family favorite.  I've made this many times just as written with excellent results every time.  One addition that I've done is add a generous handful of mozz. cheese to give it a bit of "goo".  The kids love this!!

This is VERY good!!  I did not have any sherry so I just used some red wine.  After the chicken was cut up I seasoned with salt, pepper and some chicken seasoning that I had in my pantry.  I also added a few dashes of Italian seasoning to the sauce before I added the chicken and pasta.  I used half heavy cream and half 2% milk (not sure how many calories I saved but at least I tried).  It went over very well - my 6 year old had 3 helpings.  I definitely recommend this.

Easy and delicious! I used wide egg noodles instead of spaghetti, which I think worked better with the sauce.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I added chopped fresh spinach.  My whole family loved it.  I even pureed some for my 1 year old, who happily gobbled it up!

MMMMmmmmMMMM Good!!! Doubled recipe for large family and everyone loved it!!! I barely changed it but I used fresh mushrooms and added onion and garlic.  Also used half & half instead of cream to lighten it up a tad. I also added some italian bread crumbs to the parmesan on top because the tetrazzini I had as a child always had that little breaded topping... Definately wonderful, changed or not! Thanks so much for the recipe!

What a yummy dish! I did make a few subsitutes. I used half and half instead of cream. I also used fresh baby portabella mushrooms and celery. Next time, I will add some finely diced onions and garlic and saute them.

This is my second time reviewing this. I have made this twice now and my husband and I LOVE it!! It is very easy to make and taste great! I add minced garlic to mine though after the butter has melted. Freezes very well, it is a must try!

My 5 star review was with a few modifications.  Sooo good, infact this sauce is better than a lot of restaurants I've eaten at!..  I followed the advice of reviewers and made 1 1/2 times more sauce.  Next time I'll just double since when it bakes, it dries up a little!  I sauted about 1/4 cup onion with fresh mushrooms and a 1/2 tsp crushed garlic...  The sauce taste perfect and the sherry is what threw it over the top!  I used egg noodles because I had them on hand.  Thanks for this great recipe!  I will use this sauce everytime I need a cream sauce!~

Absolutely yummy and decadent. I increased the sauce by a 1/3 because I like there to be lots of sauce on the pasta. Can easily double or triple to feed a crowd. Can mix cream and milk with good results.

This recipe is so good!!  I've made it several times now and each time my husband raves!  I have used both cream and 1% milk and both were good (of course the cream is better, but not better for you!:))

Thought this needed a bit more flavor.  Otherwise, a nice dish for a crowd.  Next time maybe add some sauted onion.

This recipe was convenient in that I already had all the ingredients on hand.  It is easy to prepare and has a delightful flavour.  I added diced black forest ham to the recipe which added a layer of flavour.  And like others I used fresh mushroom since I had them handy and some cooking wine instead of sherry.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  One thing I forgot do was break up the pasta which made it a bit difficult when mixing it with the sauce.  Will make sure to do it next time AND make extra sauce.

This has absolutely no flavor at all. For being so high in fat with the heavy cream, I would want it more flavorful. Not sure if I will even try this again and doctor it up. Off to find another Chicken Tetrazzini recipe. :(

What a great last meal before starting the New Year's diet. I made a triple recipe of the sauce. I browned the chicken in olive oil and 2-3 tablespoons of finely chopped onion and 1 teaspoon of minced garlic. I also sauteed fresh mushrooms in the same pan I browned the chicken in. I removed the mushrooms from the pan and then made the tetrazzini sauce. I made the recipe as given but did add a heaping teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the sauce(triple recipe). Instead of spaghetti, I used 16 oz. of mini penne pasta. I can see that if you used a 1 to 1 ratio of sauce and pasta it might be a little dry. The next time I make it I believe I will use whole or 2% milk, but it was ever so good!

This recipe was very delicious as is. I added a little broccoli and some basic seasoning (just a little). It was a nice way to use pasta and chicken a little differently. The sauce was yummy, which reminded me of an alfredo sauce. I'll definitely make it again.

Mmmm mmmm. That's what I got to say about this. I sauteed fresh mushrooms in garlic salt, butter and olive oil, little bit of Riesling. Same with the chicken, and I used thighs because they are more tender. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Great stuff, I've never had it before.

This was great. The sherry adds a kick to the sauce, so if you don't like the taste, then reduce it (you can add more after you test it). My 2 year old son loved it. I used a roasted chicken from costco and deboned it and used it. The flavors were bold and tasty!

This recipe was OK, but not very flavorful.  I doubled the sauce like many reviewers suggested.  I also added some chopped onion & garlic and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned but I still thought the overall taste was a little bland.

I made this last night. Very good with a few changes. I sauteed a quarter of a vidalia onion finely chopped and 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic with fresh mushrooms. I also doubled the sauce as stated by other reviewers. Also as I was putting the mixture into the greased casserole dish, I put layers of grated parmesan cheese . 
Added frozen peas. Topped the dish with both grated parmesan cheese and italian style bread crumbs. 
Was very good, definitely a keeper. I am only giving 4 stars b/c without all the modifications, this dish would have been very bland.

Im giving this 3 stars b/c i did do some different things with it.  Good base, but TOTALLY needed more flavor.  I added minced garlic and shallot to FRESH mushrooms and sauteed them in olive oil and white wine.  Then added that to my cream sauce with the liquid.  I used white wine instead of sherry...very good if i may say so.  Added crushed red pepper to the sauce along with garlic powder and parsley.  I also doubled the sauce as recommended.  MUST double the sauce.  Topped it with parm cheese.  Didnt bake TOO long, or it will dry out.  Added also a lot of cracked pepper and kosher salt to the sauce. And cooked my noodles in my chicken poaching water.  And used GOOD stock/broth.  With all those additions, it was VERY good.  For doubling the sauce i used 1 cup cream and 1 cup half & half.  Would be great with grilled chicken too.  And toppped with green onion slivers...Yummy.

This was quite tasty, but a little dry.  Next time I think I will make more sauce, (maybe double, or at least 1 and a half times more!)  Otherwise, pretty good.

This was good...a very acceptable tetrazzini.  Only changes I made were to saute 8 oz of fresh mushrooms, and to decrease pasta to 3/4 lb.  Oh, and I ran about a 1/3 cup short on the cream so I added an additional 1/3 cup of chicken broth.  Not that this change makes it healthy, but if anyone is looking to save a few calories, the sauce was still plenty thick.  I think this is a good base recipe, but in the future I'd definitely make some additions.  Things I'd like to try:  seasoning the chicken with garlic and adding minced garlic while sauteeing the mushrooms, adding a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the sauce, and adding some additional veggies, especially peas as suggested by other reviewers but maybe some grated carrots or fresh green beans as well.  As written, this is a good but not particularly memorable recipe...with a few additions, I think it could be spectacular.  Thanks!

Pretty good. A bit dry. I'll try it again. I used frozen grilled chicken which really added to the flavor more than broiled would have. It lacked something though...

This is such a great recipe and easy to put together - I've made it several times!  A few additional items I like to add include red peppers, onion and garlic, I also use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and cut back on the butter.

Very simple and yummy!  I used orange juice in place of the sherry and Italian brown mushrooms in place of the canned mushrooms.  This was so easy to make, yet tasted heavenly!  I served it with garlic bread and a tomato/basil antipasta and the resulting dinner was spectacular.  Who'd have thought I'd get this from fridge to table in under 45 minutes?

This was tasty and easy, but what a cholesterol whopper!  I doubled the sauce as many advised, but maybe next time I would increase it only by half.  I had to add extra parmesan to keep it from being too "soupy".  I also added some garlic, even though this isn't traditional.  Next time I would skip the garlic and use a lot more pepper.  I also used fresh mushrooms.  We liked it, though!

This has become a staple in my house! It's time consuming, but most definitely worth it. We like to reduce the chicken by half and double the mushrooms. Yum yum yum!

This is indeed a wonderful dish. I loved it as is, but the man wants more sauce next time, so I will increase sauce by half. I also used fresh mushrooms and added two cloves of crushed garlic with the melted butter, sauteeing briefly. Will definitely make again!

Amazing flavour ! Delicate hints os sherry.  Great way to use up leftover pasta. Added crushed garlic to butter before flour and used evaporated milk instead of cream. Also added green peas as suggested previously.  Hubby loved it too.

There were some glaring pros and cons to this recipe, the first of which being that its a strong base recipe but also incredibly bland as is.  Another pro is the flexibility of this recipe.  Too rich and creamy for your tastebuds?  Decrease the heavy cream and increase the chicken broth by the same amount.  Tasted like flour?  Cook that flour in the butter for several minutes longer, turning it over and over until it almost smells kinda nutty and keep whisking quick when you add first the broth and then the cream.  Another con?  Back to that flavor thing again, this really needs it so try generous dashes of basil, fresh or dry, along with smaller dashes of nutmeg, summer savory, parsley and tarragon.  Additions of fresh sautéed garlic, onion and mushrooms are fabulous to make this recipe shine.  Out of fresh?  Don't be worried about using garlic or onion powder if that's all ya have.  My guy dislikes the texture of onion but is fine with the taste.  Sometimes we take the time to puree and sauté an onion, other times we shortcut with powdered spice.  Sometimes I leave it in big chunks and tell him too bad, it's onion night!  Add peas, asparagus or broccoli.  After minding our family's tastebuds for over 30 years, I knew when reading the recipe that I'd never make it as is but would want to add lots of flavorful additions and took liberties to do so.  We've really liked the different variations that have come about by using this recipe as the bones for a really great one!

I used canned mushrooms and half-n-half because that's what I had on hand, but I added lots of seasoning - garlic, onion, homemade chicken stock.  This is the kind I grew up on, and it is awesome!

I used Coffee Mate instead of cream to reduce the calories and keep the good taste.  I added fresh spinach (instead of the mushrooms) which I quickly sauteed in olive oil for 60 seconds -- then folded in with the rest of the ingredients prior to baking.

I prepared this recipe twice....once exactly as posted and once adding minced garlic, chopped onion and 1/4 cup white wine to replace the sherry.  Both were VERY good tho the recipe as written may be a little bland for some tastes.  For that reason I gave it a very solid four stars instead of five.  This is a keeper.  I will make it again.

WAY too much food for less than 12 people and super boring. This recipe has NO flavor.  I even added onion and garlic. The amount of sauce it calls for with the amount of noodles is WAY too little.  I doubles the recipe for sauce and it still wasn't quite enough.

This was a good base recipe, but it really did lack flavor as others suggested. The sauce definitely needs some herbs or something; otherwise, it just tastes like a bland white sauce. I added peas to it, as well, which we really liked.

This was a huge hit in my house! My 4 yr old son told me he didn't like it,that is one habit of a 4 yr old before they even try it.I told him to take 5 more bites and there was nothing left on his plate when he was done. My one year old daughter also loved it we could not get it on her fork fast enough! This is one we will make again!

This is AWESOME!  I used salt free Chicken Bouillon so added some extra powder to the mix for added flavour and fried up about 4 cloves of garlic because we love garlic.  It was great!  One for tonight and one for the freezer...will definetly make again.

Made this today with leftover baked chicken,it was very good. I changed a few things in this recipe with fresh mushrooms and fresh parsley. Also I used milk for the cream sauce to cut back on calories, it was still thick and creamy. Also added a hint of fresh nutmeg!!!  Thanks to the review from Crystal S !

This was an awesome meal and very easy to make.  I used fresh mushrooms that i microwaved in a bowl with some water until soft.  This is one for the guests and they will never know how easy it was becuase it tastes so good.

Wow, was this fantastic! The only changes I made were to use fettuccini noodles instead of spaghetti and FRESH SAUTEED MUSHROOMS ARE A MUST!  Don't use canned!  This recipe had everyone who tried it begging for more (although with all the real butter and heavy whipping cream I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a heart condition!)  :)

very good!!! Doubled it, cooked chicken in olive oil, then cooked mushrooms(with some white wine added in), then made sauce and added the chicken & mushrooms back in. Also I added minced garlic. Everyone loved it, even my 10 & almost 6 year old sons did!!!

Like the others, I think the key ingredient missing here is cheddar cheese.  Once you add that, perfection!!  Great recipe and love that it doesn't have a soup mix.

I love making this dish. It's so easy! I saute diced onion or shallots with an package of sliced mushrooms and minced garlic. Then add the butter and flour to make the rue. Next I use a whole can of chicken broth (14oz), a cup of heavy cream, and add 1/2 c. of parm cheese to the sauce. I can hold back on the salt because the cheese is salty enough. This is a comfort dish for sure.

This is really really good, I have to say though add mor veggies to it, it will def. make it so much more flavourful. I use red peppers, mushrooms, snap peas and sun dried tomatoes in oil. I also make a about 1/4 more of the sauce, so service for 5 instead of 4 but only for the sauce not the rest. I put the parmesan in the sauce not on top and it gives it wonderful flavour and lastly I don't use sherry (non alcohol drinker) and it's just delicious. A little tip for the pasta, I find different pasta's absorbed differently. I tried a regular pasta and it absorbed it so much it felt dry. Than I tried my usually Catelli Smart pasta Linguini and it was great! It doesn't absorb too much and leaves it very moist. I also boil my pasta and let it sit in cold water for about 30 minutes that helps it to absorb less of the sauce and more water, though that sounds bad, it makes the dish very moist and it doesn't taste watery at all, very very flavourfull :) Enjoy

This was very good, and I used many of the suggestions from other reviewers (fresh mushrooms, onions and garlic.) However, I did not make extra sauce as one person suggested, and I wish I had. It was a little dry. I would increase the amount of sauce by at least 1/2 again.

Very nice -- lovely!  I browned the chicken and the mushrooms in the butter with some olive oil, removed the chicken, and made the roux and the sauce.  Then poured the mushroom sauce over the chicken and pasta in the baking dish.  

I did add a teaspoon of paste garlic to the sauce, and sprinkled sliced black olives on top to look fancy.  Seriously yummy!  I'm serving it to students tonight, so I went all out.

We really liked this dish.  I like that it doesn't use canned soup, I try to stay away from that due to the sodium content.  I did use fresh mushrooms and sauteed them first with some chopped onion.  Very good flavor in this dish.  I only had the cooking sherry that you buy in the grocery store, so I added another tablespoon of that to give it more of the sherry taste.  Also used half and half instead of heavy cream just to cut down on calories and fat and that worked fine.  My husband loves this dish and requests it often.  We do top it off with some more grated Parmesan once it's on the plate.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Love this easy, sure-fire way of preparing the white sauce!  I made this at the last minute and thus did not have all of the ingredients, but we all liked it.  My husband does NOT like mushrooms, so I substituted broccoli.  Made extra sauce by adding more chicken broth, and used milk rather than cream, just to keep it less fattening. Did not have any wine or sherry, but it was still tasty. Needs more salt.  And next time I'll probably also add onion and garlic, but this is a great base from which to flex in many directions.

This recipe was delicious!  I used fresh mushrooms in this recipe and sauteed them with fresh chopped garlic and added the remaining ingredients for the sauce.  WOW!  The cream sauce was garlicky and creamy.  My family loved it! Thank you very much for this recipe.

I tried this recipe last night and was very happy with the results. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding fresh mushrooms instead of canned and doubling the amount of ground black pepper used. I also added a dash of garlic powder. All in all I was very pleased with this recipe and I will be making it again. Thanks!

I made this recipe for 60 for a church dinner, and it was devoured. The sherry just makes this dish ! made the following adjustments: I used half & half instead of cream, Mario Batali's 4-Cheese Italian blend mixed into the sauce, left out the mushrooms, and on top I sprinkled a little more of the cheese blend,  cheddar, and toasted sliced almonds. For extra flavor, I boiled the spaghetti in the same water in which I boiled the chicken. I mixed the casseroles the night before and baked about 30 minutes before serving. Great recipe!

I read a few reviews before making this and then went back and read them more closely after I made it.  I realized that many of the higher ranking reviews added extra seasonings to give it flavor.  I didn't add anything extra and found it very bland.  I used a chardonnay instead of sherry (whatever difference that makes, I don't know).  This might be a good base recipe, but I don't feel it deserves this high of a rating as is.  In my opinion, it needs garlic, onion, more salt, pepper, etc.  I would not recommend making this as stated or you will most likely be disappointed.

This was really great.  I made a double batch, though, and I would cut the butter a bit.  I'd have to play with it to make sure the sauce was still good, but there was WAY too much butter.  My husband and I both came away with that "ick too rich" feeling (so we cut it with a glass of red).

I loved this recipe.I did have to make some adjustments. I only use half the noodles if I am using this recipe. If I am cooking and using the entire package of noodles, I double the sauce. I found it to be too dry the 1st time I tried it without doubling the sauce. I also added thinly sliced celery to this recipe because my daughter and I love celery in our tetrazzini. I sauteed the mushrooms and celery with a tbsp. of real butter and a tbsp. of cooking sherry for about 2-3 minutes. I will be using this recipe for years to come. Was very good!!

This is the first time I made chicken tetrazzini and it turned out pretty good. The only thing I changed was I cruched up Ritz crackers and mixed them with Virgo parmesan bread crumbs for a topping. I sprinkled some butter in them so they would make yummy tidbits for the top. Next time I will make a little more of the sauce too because it was a little dry when we re-heated it. I will make this again though!

Fantastic!  Made almost as is, just used Italian seasoning when cooking the chicken (and like another reviewer, cooked it in olive oil then used the same pan to make the sauce), fresh mushrooms, and put half of the Parmesan cheese in with the flour and then the other half on top.  I also neglected to add the salt since the chicken broth I used had plenty of sodium. Fiance gave it an "A++" and asked it to be added to the regular rotation!

Everyone enjoyed it.  I did notice while making the roux it was a bit bland, I just tossed in a couple teaspoonfuls of chicken bouillon.  I gave the additional salt it need and a bit more flavor!

I made this tonight and my family loved it.  I did not have sherry but added some sweet white wine instead and it was perfect.  In fact I have some left overs which is good so that we can eat tomorrow for lunch.    I highly recommend.  Bon Appetite

Great Tetrazzini!  I doubled the sauce to make it extra soupy, used half and half, fresh mushrooms and added some peas.  It was perfect and my family loved it!

Very good! I used white wine instead of sherry, and added some minced garlic. It turned out great! No problems with it being too dry, but I may have used slightly less spaghetti than called for (just eyeballed it out of a LB box.) I look forward to playing with this one, it's a keeper!

I make tons of recipes from this site, but I review very few. This is by far one of the best I have tried. Not that it is beyond wonderful, but it is exactly as the recipe should be. Tetrazzini is comfort food and that is exactly what you get with this. I also did most of the suggestions, (I recalculated to 8 servings) and added 1/2 a finely diced onion, 4 cloves of garlic. I used cond milk instead of cream. I do not have Sherry, so I used 2 T of left over red wine. My 3 teenagers LOVED it. They are picker than 3 yr olds!!! Thanks for this recipe. I will make it very often because it is super easy, super yummy and I have all the stuff all the time!

My family of picky eaters loved this one.  I substituted the cream with milk, and instead of using canned mushrooms I sauteed fresh mushrooms in butter.  I used the sherry but felt that it overpowered everything else so next time I will either leave it out or only put 1 tbs.

Kind of bland kids said they didn't like it but would be willing to try it again if I made it differently, not very creamy or rich at all.  Will try again with some cream of mushroom any see they like it, thanks for the base recipe

This recipe is amazing! My dad who is a meat and potatos person loved this! It was a big hit in our home. I added the garlic and onion to roux, excellent!! Also, I doubled the sauce to make it more creamy along with using fresh mushrooms. I will make this all the time!!

I, like others, used skim instead of heavy cream and added some extra flour. I also used fresh mushrooms and some frozen peas. I also swapped the spaghetti with penne because I was out of spaghetti. It was absolutely delicious!

Great recipe. My husband & friend liked it a lot. I didnt use mushrooms, used parmesan reggiano, curly noodles and fat free 1/2 & 1/2.  Thought it was very tasty & will make again. Thanks for a new addition to my rotation :)

My husband absolutely loved this. I had to have surgey so I made a few meals ahead of time and this was one of them. My husband is a picky eater so I left out the mushrooms and sherry. I also took the tip of substituting evaporated skim milk instead of heavy cream. I read reviews stated this recipe was bland so before cooking the chicken I put a grilling seasoning on it called Weber Grilling Creations Kickin Chicken. It is kind of spicy but added a great flavor! I also went ahead and mixed the parmesan cheese into the dish. Since I was making this ahead of time to help my husband, I followed all the steps intil the baking. I put the mixture in a large freezer bag and instructed my husband to thaw it out in the morning and bake that evening. It turned out great! It is one of his favorites now.

Tasty!  The sherry makes this dish, so do not omit it!  This is kind of like a milder chicken alfredo.  A simple easy dish.

As suggested by others I sauted some garlic and onion in the butter before adding the flour. Easy to make and Super YUMMY. My two year old loved it and my husband told me that I'm not supposed to make stuff so good that he over eats. (we both went back for seconds) What I really loved is I was able to put the entire dish together and then keep it in the fridge until my husband called and said he was on the way home. Then I just popped it in the oven! Made for perfect timing!

Family loved this.  I used leftover cooked and seasoned chicken.  Green chilies might have been good in it also.  Idid not use mushrooms and did use two noodles I had half a box of.  Worked great!

I simpled this up by eliminating the flour and the cream, and cutting the butter in half.  I used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead and one can of cold milk.  Next time I will experiment by adding frozen peas and diced carrots to the mix. I like the idea of fresh mushrooms too. And brocolli florets to garnish this.  I gave this 5 stars because it is quick, easy and you can play with the recipe to suite your individual tastes.

Delish!  I highly recommend using 2% milk instead of heavy cream.  It cuts way down on the fat and still tastes great.  I will probably add some garlic and onion next time to liven it up a notch.

This dish is great, my family really enjoyed it, but I was desapointed for the fact that it turned out very dry and I only baked for 20 minutes. Maybe I should have baked it covered with a foil??? I'm not sure, but I can tell you that I had a couple bites before putting in the oven and it was excellent, very saucy. Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience as we always learn from our mistakes. Here are the changes I made: I sauted some onions with olive oil, then added the mushrooms and the white part of a rotisserie chicken. I also added half and half instead of heavy cream and only used 1 Tbsp of butter, which is more than enough. I will definetely make this again, but I will not bake it.

After watching the infamous "Chicken Tetrazzini" lady on The Soup, and never having had chicken tetrazzini before, I had to give it a try. I followed other members' suggestions and used nonfat evaporated milk instead of cream, and a handful of grated cheese in the sauce before mixing in the solid ingredients. I was going to also add sauteed chopped onion and minced garlic per others' advice, but forgot. It still made a very rich, creamy, and tasty sauce. This recipe is a keeper. Next time I won't forget the onion and garlic, and I'm going to try sprinkling on a topping of breadcrumbs before browning. There are 8 in my family, so I doubled the recipe and it made a TON of tetrazzini! This would be a great dish for a potluck or dinner party. My husband is going to be eating the leftovers for lunch for days, but I don't think he'll mind.

I rated this 3 stars for the original recipe. I made this "as is" per the recipe and found it good but not great. It is good as a base recipe and an easy recipe for someone who wants to try their first "white sauce". Thank you Mary for the recipe and time spent.  I'm not so vain to say that my version is better, but it did work for my family and my tastes. I read a lot of reviews about this recipe and incorporated them into my second try. Very little I did was not in the other reviews. My changes included: using 1TB olive oil to sautee 1/2 small onion and 4 cloves garlic chopped; added 3TB butter and 1/4 C flour; added 1 can chicken broth and 1C heavy cream to roux; added 2TB dry sherry and pepper to roux; added 1 8 ounce pkg of sauteed sliced baby portabellos and an 8 ounce pkg prepared spaghetti and 2C chicken; added 1/4C fresh shredded reg-parm cheese to mix. I put 1/4C reg-parm cheese mixed with italian style bread crumbs on top and baked. I used store bought rotisserie chicken. I would not do that again. Very salty. I hope this helps someone.

I made this dish for dinner the other night and my hubby and I really enjoyed it.  I did make changes according to other reviewers such as using fresh mushrooms, I added seasoning salt, minced garlic, minced onion and added frozen peas.  I also added basil to give a little more flavor.  Basil is a favorite in my household.  I sprinkled with grated parmesan and Italian Panko Bread Crumbs.  Will make again.

This was quick and easy to make.  I didn't change a thing and it turned out great.  EVERYone in my family loved it...which is a feat in itself (they even ignored the mushrooms).  There are so few meals I can make which all my picky eaters mutually enjoy.  This recipe has been added to the few recipes that will allow for a nice family dinner together.  Thanks!

This recipe was great!  I did make modifications based on other reviews and what I had on hand.  It definitely needed more sauce than the recipe called for.  I used 3/4 cup cream, 3/4 cup skim milk, 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth, and I used cornstarch rather than flour.  I also chopped up some chives and sprinkled them on top.

A great dish and easy to make.  I loved that it didn't call for a can of some kind of soup.  I did use fresh mushrooms due to the fact that I dislike them from the can.  Other than that made exactly as written.  Next time I may add a bit of garlic just because we use it in everything.  Everyone ate it so that gets a 5 right there.  Thanks!

Everyone is still raving about this recipe...only changes is I added chopped onion, pimentos, and diced green peppers to chicken when cooking.  I added 1 cup of parmesean cheese to the mixture before adding spaghetti and then topped with mozzarella cheese before putting in the oven...then sherry is a must!!!!  I will be making this many times...great freezer meal to make for later too!!!

Very yummy! We all really enjoyed this...I used leftover chicken from a whole chicken that I made in the crockpot, I also sauteed onion, garlic and mushrooms together in a little evoo and deglazed the pan with a little white wine. I used whole grain thin spaghetti and doubled the sauce. Only used half the butter and subbed the other half with evoo. I also used fat free half and half and had no problem with the sacue thickening (I also added about 1/2c pecorino romano cheese to the sauce). This was so tasty and very easy to make. I added some frozen baby peas and topped with some more pecorino romano and Italian bread crumbs. A great way to use leftover chicken and very tasty. Will make again!

This was very tasteful!As usual, I like to add a few things. I added onions(saute first) Also, I added some fresh, diced tomatoes.  Then, to  top  it off, I add buttered bread crumbs and bake!

I was looking for the "Original & Classic" Tetrazzini recipe, and this is the one!  Great for left-over chicken or turkey.  Please, do not use the recipe's that call for a can of soup.  This recipe is easy and it is worth making!

My family loved this!!  It was really very simple to make, and I even used leftover spaghetti that was in my fridge.  I might double the sauce next time, as I personally thought it could use more.  A really good recipe.

Very good, but a little heavy. When browning my chicken I use a little Cajun seasoning. It goes well with the pasta.

I too modified this a little by sauteeing fresh mushrooms, onion and garlic for the mushroom portion.  The flavor was great, but I think I liked the mixture prior to baking as more of like a chicken spaghetti.  Came out just a tad dry after being baked.  Dirtied up a lot of pans too.

This recipe is very good.  I will be making this again, however it was a little dry for our taste, so next time I will be making and additional 1/2 recipe of the sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe to add to our rotation.

I thought this recipe was pretty good--it could have used a bit of more flavor--perhaps garlic, more pepper or more sherry? I'd probably add more sherry next time. I doubled the sauce (exactly the same proportions as was called for in the recipe.) I sauteed the chicken in garlic and then added portabella mushrooms to the chicken in addition to two small cans of mushrooms. If you are looking for a yummy, creamy chicken pasta, this is a good one. My husband and 3 year old both liked it too. And I have a TON leftover.

I sauteed a clove of garlic with the butter before adding the salt, pepper and flour, this added the extra bit of flavor to this dish that so many found lacking without being overwhelming. I also substituted red wine for the sherry, and the rest of the bottle actually made a terrific complement to the meal at dinner!

This recipe is the base of something that will become a regular in my house. I added broccoli and red bell pepper to the pasta because it seemed so bland. It added alot but the pasta was still somewhat boring and on the dry side. Next time I will add more chicken broth and instead of broccoli i think i will try asparagus. In my opinion you should try as it the first time and build from there. Its a keeper but it just needs a little added to it!

This was really good; I think I could've given it 5 stars if I had used sherry instead of white wine (all I had on hand) and doubled the sauce.  It was a bit dry for my taste - I like things very creamy.  My kids and husband liked it very much and even ate the mushrooms!

This was very tasty and an easy way to use left over chicken breast.  I made some additions, including adding chopped bell peppers - green, red, and orange to the mushrooms, as they sautéed - the more veggies I can sneak in, the better and they tasted great.  Also, I added pre-cooked bacon to the sauce, which enhanced the flavor, along with a few dashes of hot sauce and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Served with bow tie pasta.  Everyone had seconds.

This is great. We cooked the chicken with the mushrooms, and added garlic powder and crushed red pepper as it cooked. We doubled the sauce. And topped with mozza before baking. This was fantastic!!!! And with only two of us, made enough for leftovers for a few days.

I made with the mods of sauted garlic, baby portabellas and onion, bit of red pepper flakes and non-fat evaporated milk. I always replace a can on NF evap milk for all my cooking, can't tell the difference and it saves your heart. It was nothing special, but good to take to a sports pasta dinner

Very good recipe. It does take a lot of time to make if you have to cook the "cooked" cubes of chicken but it is delicious and I love taking the time to cook. My fiancee did say it needed a bit more sauce my between you and me...I liked it just the way it was!

I didn't give this 5 *'s as I did tweak it as others posters suggested.I too doubled the sauce and added cooked onions, red pepper flakes, and minced garlic. I also only used 2 Tbsp. of sherry,& I used fat-free half & half. I had made a 15 lb turkey so I used the breast of turkey instead of chicken. I will DEFINITELY be making this again as it was a BIG hit with my DH.

I thought this was good! I used wine instead of sherry because that's what I had. I followed the exact directions other than the wine and I didn't think it was too dry. Will be making this again.

Tasty, but too buttery.  (Maybe my fault for the way I cooked the chicken) I'll cut back next time.  I really think with tweeking this is 5 stars.  I made exactly as written and this was great.  I'm not sure where the "dry" comments are coming from.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  Like others, I added sauteed onions and garlic and doubled the sauce.  I also used fettucini instead of spaghetti.  He told me this is his new all time favorite.  The fact that he ate about 1/2 of it verifies that!

This is a great tetrazzini recipe!  The sauce is so creamy and delicious. I put parmesan cheese in the recipe and also on top of it.  I make the recipe for 8 servings and divide it and put 1/2 in the freezer.

Good recipe!  
I changed a few things.  I used fresh mushrooms, added onions, and fresh minced garlic and omitted the sherry.  I sauteed the mushrooms, onions, and garlic together and added it to the chicken.  I didn't use 2 cups of Parmesan cheese... only sprinkled on top.  Turned out very good.

I used leftover Thanksgiving for this and it turned out really well.  I think the key to a good tetrazzini is adding plenty of flavor at every level, from the meat, to the sauce, to the vegetables.  I added a shallot, some minced garlic, and sliced my own baby portabellas which made this for me.  The sauce was easy, I used white wine as that's what I had.  The parmesan cheese got golden and crispy on top, absolutely delicious.  Definitely a great winter casserole.

I am giving this a four because I made a few changes. I used turkey instead of chicken, fat free half n' half instead of cream and I added onions ( I cooked them in a pan with fresh mushrooms). The sauce was plenty creamy with the half n' half. This was so good. We loved it!

I thought this recipe was a little dry and needed more flavor. Also, many more steps than necessary when making a "quick meal."

I got this recipe in my email.  I was looking for something different so I thought I'd give it a try because of all the great recommendation.   Took others advice and used the different noodles and 1 1/2X sause mix.  I'm not familiar with sherry so I used lambrusco instead. The prep time was a little longer as I used fresh mushrooms and cooked fresh chicken in garlic and olive oil.  I cooked the mushrooms in butter in the same pan.  The aroma was wonderful and the dish was GREAT.  I believe that a side of canned peas with a couple tsp butter heated to just before boiling would add the "something missing" other reviewers commented about.  I will definately use it again.

This was good. I think I put in too many noodles (didn't measure) because it was a bit dry. I used half-n-half and since I didn't have any sherry, I used marsala and I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I too had to turn up the heat to medium to get the sauce to boil. I think next time I'll saute' the mushrooms with some garlic and cut down on the noodles and maybe add a little salt - it was kind of bland but everyone liked it.

As other reviewers suggested, I added some chopped onion and chopped red pepper for added color and flavor.  I also added garlic powder and italian seasoning for more flavor.  I did not have any sherry so I used some red wine.  I was extremely pleased with the result.  The whole family loved it!

This was OK but it was missing something.  If anyone knows what that something is, let me know.  The substitutions I made were:  sauteed fresh mushrooms rather than canned, added 2 cloves minced garlic with the butter, used fat free half and half rather than cream, added 1/2 cup extra of broth and half and half to make extra sauce, used 2 tablespoons additional broth instead of sherry, added about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan to the sauce and used 2 chicken breasts worth cooked in olive oil (not sure how close that was to 2 cups).  Fiance seemed to really like it but I thought it was a bit bland.  Will probably try again but adding more seasoning or something.

Yumm!  I thinly sliced the chicken and then marinated it in chicken broth, lemon and lemon pepper.  I sauted the chicken in a little more butter and garlic, then added the mushrooms and some spinach.  I doubled the creme and chicken broth and added some frozen carrots, cauliflower and broccoli to the mixture right before I threw it in the oven. (I added the lemon because we don't drink alcohol and I think with a little bit it took the place nicely.)

I used this recipe for a brunch the morning after my daughter's wedding, with some changes.  I used a little garlic, more cream and sherry, fresh mushrooms sauted in butter, and fresh chopped spinich.  It was a huge sucess and many guests requested the recipe.

Very good recipe. It is a great way to use up left over turkey! I didn't add the sherry either and it tasted very good. I think next time I will add a little bit of milk to compensate for the lack of sherry.

Made as original recipe was written and found it to be tolerable but quite bland- like nursing home or big buffet food. Will try again with some of the adjusted recommendations because the foundation is there- just needs something more.

Found this recipe in an old Betty Crocker cookbook. Was in a pinch to make dinner and realized I had all the ingredients on hand. I did sauté onion in the butter before adding the flour, and I sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top before baking. Turned out very well, albeit a little starchy. Tasted like the 1970s!

My husband and I liked this fine, but honestly we made it the one time and never made it again. It comes off just a little sweet as the cream is a little overpowering in the end result for us I think. But if you that's your thing, this is a good dish.

Seriously a family favorite. We make this weekly, usually on a Sunday or early in the week because it reheats so deliciously for lunches through the week. The first time making it was a little daunting but after making it a couple times it is so easy and quick to make.

This recipe calls for too much flour. 1/4 cup to 4 Tbs of butter needs more then 1 and 1/2 cups of milk. Other then that it was good.

This was really good.  The only changes I made was first, I boiled the chicken with three chicken bouillon cubes, once the chicken was cooked, I removed the chicken, but DID NOT throw away the water/broth.  I then boiled the spaghetti in the same water I cooked the chicken in.  This gives the spaghetti some added flavor.

Also, i added crushed potato chips on one half of it, because my husband and kids like the crunch chips on top. 

Really good recipe!

I need to make this again! I grilled the chicken, added chopped onions and garlic to the butter and sautéed before I added the flour. I used 1/3 heavy cream 1/3 almond milk 1/3 evaporated milk. I will probably eliminate the heavy cream next time. Before I put it in the pan, I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper for flavor. When I put everything in the pan, I sprinkled paprika over the top. Sooooo good!!! Served with peas and garlic bread

Creamy comfort food with a nice ratio of pasta to chicken.  I lightened it up by using half the butter called for and 2% milk instead of cream.  I used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken.  No salt needed.  I topped it with a little extra parm and bread crumbs before baking.

As the recipe is, it would be really bland. I added minced roasted garlic, oregano, basil, some Parmesan cheese, and used fresh mushrooms. Next time I want to increase the amount of sauce so I will be increasing the broth and cream mixture, otherwise it dries out during baking.

I used chicken tenders cooked with garlic and onion first.  Then used chicken stock and lactose free 1% milk, probably about half a cup adding as needed.   Also added broccoli and quite a bit of Dijon mustard.  Was a big hit with everyone.  Will definitely make again.  Did not add sherry.

To all the so-called cooks that reviewed this dish.  It is called Tetrazzini for a reason.  Do a little research into the dish.  Once you've made all your "improvements" it is no longer the original but is now a knock-off.  Something you can find on any street corner --not worth the money.

Love this recipe. Made it 4 or 5 times with the following changes: Break the spaghetti in thirds. Use rotisserie chicken. Saute 1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, and 2 cloves minced garlic in 1-2 T olive oil first, then added all that to the already thickened sauce. For the sauce, I used 1 1/2 cups chicken broth + 1 cup 2% milk + 1/2 cup half-and-half.  Also used more sherry - maybe 5 Tablespoons. BE VERY CAREFUL TO USE ONLY 1/2 OF A 16 OUNCE PACKAGE OF SPAGHETTI.

I had fresh mushrooms that I sautéed before adding. I only had 1/2 cup of whipping cream, so I added 1/2 cup of milk. Turned out great.

This is  a good "comfort food" recipe.  I followed the directions with one exception - which was to use a container of fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned.  Once the ingredients were combined it felt dry - a criticism some other reviewers had also.  I made up an additional half batch of the broth/cream/flour/wine/butter mixture and then added it to the already combined ingredients. That gave the dish a much more pleasing consistency and is something I would continue to do.  I divided this into 2 smaller pans and froze one for use at a later date.  The finished produce is a little rich so serving it with a healthy green salad on the side cuts some of that.  While that doesn't make it a 'healthy' meal, the large salad on the side allows you to have a smaller portion of the main dish to help you keep the fat and calorie count in control.

Used leftover turkey and gravy from Thanksgiving.
Sautéed 8 0z. Baby Bella mushrooms and half an onion in butter then made the roux by adding the flour, extra butter and salt. Added the extra gravy to this, along with the sherry.
Added 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup half an half, the cooked spaghetti broken into smaller pieces, and the leftover turkey. Sprinkled with parmesan cheese.
Cooked in a 9x13 casserole dish for a little less than half an hour. Wonderful dinner!

I generally follow the recipe to the letter the first time around.  Doing so I feel I'm able determine,what if any substitutions I might try.  A family member has used Nutmeg rather than Sherry. I'll be considering what type of mushroom to pair with a light use of Nutmeg..

I've been looking for a tetrazzini recipe that is similar to one that a friend made for me years and years ago.  Finally, I hit upon this one, and it's the keeper.  It, in its written form, is definitely not health food, but is comfort food at its best.  The only changes that I made were to add a small jar of diced pimientos and about 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. If I decide to put this on regular rotation, I will try to lighten it up.  But making it as written (and I with my 2 small additions) results in a tasty, easy casserole that warms up a cool evening.  My family and teenage daughter's friend all loved it.

Even with modifications suggested by others (sauteed onions, garlic, and fresh mushrooms), my family thought this was bland. For us, really needs some herbs. Next time I'm adding bacon!

Delicious recipe. I made this for a party of 25 using the measurement adjustment feature on this website. It made way more than needed. I followed the recipe but added fresh mushrooms, bell pepper and onion. I marinated my chicken with some lemon juice before cooking. I used both breast and thigh meat. I also used Italian herbed breadcrumbs (as suggested by another reviewer) mixed with Parmesan cheese as a top layer. I got lots of compliments and will make this for my family in the future.

I liked it because it has such a nice flavor but will add celery and onion the next time I make it  as I have done in the past.
I like a little more texture but this is much easier and faster to make.

Per other cooks comments, I used 1/2 & 1/2. I also used garlic and fresh mushrooms. And changed to a smaller portion size (serves 6). Great base recipe !

I made it gluten free by omitting the butter and substituting cornstarch for flour, using half as much of the flour indicated.  I heated up the cream with water, reserving 1/2 cup water to mix with the cornstarch.  When the cream/water was bubbly, I added the cornstarch and stirred until thickened.  And of course, used gluten free spaghetti.  The only other change I made was adding 1/4 cup of parmesan to the sauce.  Turned out great!

Turned out great! I added broccoli. I didn't have chicken stock and used beef broth with full fat milk. Also carmalized the onions mushrooms and broccoli before I added to roux! Delish!

Great recipe.  Made 3 changes, used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, just sauted them in the same pan I cooked the chicken in.  Also, used 1/4 cup heavy cream and 3/4 cup milk to lighten it up a bit.  Added 1/4 cup parmesan to the sauce and sprinkled the rest on top.

It turned out well.  The only reason I give it 3 stars is because it was to rich and I had to make changes.  In the future I will find a way to use less heavy cream while keeping a good consistency.   Changes I made:  I used real mushrooms, used extra milk as another review suggested, I used a Pinot Grigio white whine, also, I pounded some chicken breasts to 1/2" floured and fried to 50% done..  Lastly, I followed another review of using Kloski noodles and I liked that decision.  It tasted amazing but my stomach didn't like how rich it was...

Recently my mother was given a tray of chicken tetrazzini  from one of the ladies from her church. She didn't think she would like it so she gave it to me. It seems like it was homemade but it failed miserably in taste compared to this recipe. I've made this one several times and I plan on making it again to show my taste buds that chicken tetrazzini is actually delicious.

Fantastic recipe!  I use 16 oz of fresh mushrooms instead of a lesser amount from a can, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  I'm about to make it again with chopped up turkey that I froze after Thanksgiving.  I'm sure it'll be just as good as the chicken.

I make this for large family gatherings and it is always a hit.  The kids love it as much as the adults.  The only substitution I make is using fresh cut up mushrooms.  When I serve the tetrazzini, I have cayenne pepper sitting next to it for people to add to spice the pasta up a little.  This is a nice option for people who like to have a little heat with their food.

Used fresh mushrooms and followed recipe exactly.  The 30 minutes was too long to bake in my oven.  It was brown and bubbly in only 10.  Watch it carefully!  Flavor was great.  Didn't find it bland at all.  Perfect with garlic bread.

I made this last night and although my husband ate it, I could not finish mine. The sauce was actually cream gravy. Flour + whipping cream =cream gravy. And as others have noted it had absolutely zero taste.

Made exactly as the recipe called for and it is really bland.Next time I'll brown boneless skinless tenders in olive oil and butter on each side then saute diced onions, sliced green onions and minced garlic in the pan drippings. I'll double the roux in a separate pot then add more milk instead of heavy cream. The sauce should be thinner and more plentiful when put into the oven so the al dente spaghetti can absorb the liquid while keeping the casserole moist and creamy. 
Love the sherry and next time I'll add more to taste and use white pepper instead of black. I cooked the spaghetti in water with chicken bouillon for more flavor. It's just something I do, but not necessary. I think next time I will also add finely shredded parmesan, instead of grated, to the sauce and then top the casserole with Mozzarella or Italian Blend cheese. Another tip, Always taste the dish before putting it in the oven and adjust seasonings as needed. This sauce needed more seasoning! Everything is already cooked and warm so once it starts bubbling in the oven, it's done - it doesn't need an hour to cook.

I've made this recipe once and I'm going to give it a go again tonight. This was the first recipe I tried with cooking wine or any kind of wine for that matter, and it turned out great! I am a newly married woman and I look forward to trying more recipes like this in the future. This one was great for breaking the ice in the kitchen for more homemade dishes.

As is, I'm rating this recipe a 3 star.  I made as following: used a whole package spaghetti ( which is 16 oz, not 8 as stated here), subsituted almond milk for stock and tripled the amount for the sauce. **In past experience this much pasta needs 4 cups sauce in order to not be dry after baking.** I also added nutmeg, white pepper and thyme to the sauce. Also added 1/2 cup Fontina cheese to the mix. I sauteed fresh shittakes and julianned Italian zucchini ( like to sneak in any fresh veggies I have  in all my dishes). I Added this to the finished sauce and then poured over cooked spaghetti and combined. Final touch, last 7 minutes of baking, I hit broil (500) and got a nice crispy top because my husband likes it that way :) Results? Let's just say even full, I had trouble stopping myself from going in for seconds!

I thought this was pretty good. It needed more sauce for the amount of pasta though. Next time I will double the sauce.

Fabulous!  I never make hotdish style dinners and my family just loved it!  Reminded us of the ala Homer dish at Spaghetti Factory.  
I made it as described and grated fresh parmesan on the top.

This was very good, and easy to make.  I used fresh mushrooms, don't like them in a can.  I was also pressed for time, so I did not bake it, it just let the pasta simmer in the sauce for a few minutes before serving.  I will be making this again for sure.

I think that this recipe was very good. To improve this recipe I would suggest adding different kinds of spices to give it more flavor. You could use garlic, olive oil, etc. to make this recipe have more flavor.

Loved this recipe.  Very simple to make.  The only changes I made were using a rotisserie chicken, adding a 1 Tablespoon of sriracha, and using portabella mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms. Overall big hit.

I followed the recipe as written. Even though my wife and family seemed to enjoy it, I found it a little bland. I will definitely make it again but maybe with a little garlic and a dash of cayenne for a little extra pizzaz.

YUM!!!!! I made this tonight & so glad I did! After reading the reviews, I did opt to use fresh portabella mushrooms sautéed in olive oil with a shallot and some garlic before adding to the mixture. I also doubled the sauce and used 3 cups of cooked chicken so I could feed my college swimmer and his teammates...good thing I did because there wasn't a bite left!

This recipe IS very good, but I reserve a 5 star rating for those that are truly exceptional (as a college English teacher I think it's part of the hazard of my profession!). As such, I will say that I make this every December with my leftover Christmas turkey instead of chicken. I find that it is rich and tasty on a cold winter night (though by no men's healthy). My husband does not like mushrooms, but this recipe is easily adjustable so that mushrooms get added just to my half. I tried many tetrazzini recipes in the past,but when's found this one I stuck with it. It is worth a try!

I used fresh sauteed mushrooms, substituted evap. milk for the cream and doubled the sauce. Doubling the sherry seemed like overkill so I only used 3 tbsp rather than 4. I also added onion and garlic. It turned out great! My husband told me it was a keeper and my 3 year old had seconds.

My family loves this! Want me to make it at least once a week. I cook my chicken remove it,then add fresh mushrooms to the pan with a little garlic. Do not add all the butter and substitute some of the cream for low fat milk. It taste even better warmed up the next day!

the ingredients are fine except I would take haf the sauce without chicken or mushrooms and mi it with the spaghetti.I would put it in a casserole and create a well in the midle.then I would mix the chicken and mushrooms in the rest of the sauce.sprinkle th 1/2 cup mozzraella and bake at 350 degrees or 1/2 hour or until cheese has nicely browned,
  I think it would present itself better.

Made it tonight.  Very rich recipe.  Usually I try it as written before adjusting.  Just a few adjustments this time though.  I sauted fresh mushrooms (don't like canned) with a little minced onion first and set it aside.  Boiled boneless skinless chicken breasts in chicken broth not water.  When it came time to assemble it all I left the white sauce in the pan, mixed the chicken and noodles together, then spooned in the sauce.  I sprinkled some plain breadcrumbs and shredded parmesan cheese before baking on convection for about 20 minutes.  Very nice.  Was a 'make again' from the family.  I know it would be a big hit with a crowd.

It was good, but not as good as I was expecting. Anyone who has watched the TV show The Soup has wanted to try this. After you take it out of the oven let it sit for a few minutes then put on tons of cheese.  It it is a cheap and tawdry dish, you will feel guilty afterwards.

This was a great recipe for leftovers.  I actually used turkey and it was wonderful.  We didn't have any mushrooms on hand, but I put in a jar of artichoke hearts and we enjoyed the tangyness they added.

Love this!! Like others I increased the chicken broth, and added the cheese to the sauce.  I also sauteed fresh mushrooms and used evaporated milk instead of cream.  I loved the original recipe, don't misunderstand!! Just trying to avoid the extra sodium and fat, and I have one non-cheese lover (who doesn't know it's in there unless it's on top)!  I used a rotisserie chicken from the store -- what amazing flavor!!  Will make again for sure!! Served with peas and garlic breadsticks.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Family loved this, but it only got 4 stars because if you make exactly as the recipe is written it can be a bit dry. You need to double the sauce-also helps if you saute some onions and garlic with the mushrooms.

This was extremely tasty.  The changes that I made were as follows.  I used white pepper in place of black, I used fresh sliced shiitake mushrooms (only because I had them on hand) and I added some diced celery, I also used chicken thighs only which I sauteed in some olive oil with salt & pepper.   My entire family loved this and they kept refilling their plates until there was nothing left.  My son suggested next time I try adding some buttered bread crumbs on top.  So we will definitely be making this again.

Just made this tonight and it was yummy! To make it a little healthier, I used whole wheat fettucini, evaporated milk instead of heavy cream, and added broccoli and diced tomatoes as suggested. I also used wine because I don't keep sherry on hand. Its a winner!

This had such good reviews, but a lot of modifications mentioned. I made one revision: 1) I used half-and-half in place of the heavy cream. This sauce is super creamy and easy to make. This is definitely a 5-star recipe. It will become a staple in my home and it seems like it will be a very forgiving recipe if you want to play around with it.

I made the mistake of adding a 1-lb. box of spaghetti, instead of the required 8 oz. . Way too dry!
I also use a 10-oz. pkg. of sliced fresh mushrooms, uncooked. And I broil the top if it hasn't browned while baking. 
This is one of my family's all-time favorite comfort foods, especially the day after Thanksgiving, using leftover turkey.

This was delicious.  However I did not do the final step of baking the dish.  Still we had to eat it quickly because it dried out so fast.  I did use fresh sliced mushrooms (which I sautéed in butter) rather than canned, and I omitted the sherry.  Needed a bit of salt & pepper at the end.  Overall: a little dry, but tasty.

We don't keep sherry in the house so I substituted white cooking wine in place of the sherry and it still was very good.  We used thin spaghetti and added some mozarella chesse along with the parmesan.  Kids loved it !

I accidentally bought fat free broth and light cream so Im sure Im missing a lil flavor due to that. This dish was tasty, but nothing amazing. I seasoned my chicken with S&P and garlic powder since plain old cooked chicken didnt feel right to me. It's def missing somthing, but I dont know what... EDIT: I know whats missing. The sauce itself needs some cheese in it. The bites with the parmesan crust were delicious, the rest were blah. So next time I will add some good quality shaved parmesan to the cream.

I have never made or eaten Chicken Tetrazzini.  I was looking for a way to use up leftover smoked turkey and this worked very well.  The kids enjoyed it and was easy for me to put together.  I might prefer the unbaked version just because it seemed more saucy than the baked version.

I made this for dinner last night and I have to say it was excellent.  The sauce is creamy and rich and the chicken and mushrooms flavors are so good.  It all worked well with the spaghetti pasta.  I went ahead and doubled the sauce portion and I think the consistency was just right, not too saucy.  I didn't think the sauce was bland but I did add just a light sprinkle of salt and pepper to each plate before serving.  Right before baking I added a crumbly topping to the casserole:  2 TBL melted butter, 1/4 C. bread crumbs (unseasoned) and 1/4 C. parmesan cheese (green can stuff) mixed together, crumbled on top.  The topping bakes to a golden brown and complimented the dish.  This is a very nice recipe with simple directions.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very good and my picky husband loved it! I added an extra 1/2 cup of chicken broth and added minced garlic to the butter to give it more flavor.  I also used the wine we were going to drink for dinner instead of the sherry and turned out great!!

My fiance said it was the tastiest meal he's had in a very long time. Will make this again for sure! Great use of leftovers. He doesn't eat mushrooms so I used diced red peppers, onion and garlic. Replaced sherry with red wine on hand and was really delicious!

This tasted very good, but I thought it was a little too dry.

I've been dying to make Chicken Tetrazzini (if you watch The Soup you might understand why) and this was very good.  There seemed to be a bit too much Sherry for my taste so next time I will cut that back.  Otherwise, it was very good and kept well for leftovers.

Wow!  Too rich and buttery tasting.  I made this exactly as written but did add bacon, onion, garlic and used fresh mushrooms.  Made me feel ill after eating.  Too heavy.  If I make this again I will follow other reviewers and make a lighter, healthier version.

This recipes is good. I would recommend adding more sauce. I used about 2 cups chicken broth and one whole can of evaporated milk. I also added one small onion and garlic to add flavor. It was just enough liquid once it baked. I didn't use the heavy cream. All in all it tasted good. I will make again.

Delicious! With no sherry we added chopped garlic to the sauce, and topped with two or so cups of parm, mozerella, and super crisp bacon afterwards. We plan to try cooking the mushrooms in the bacon grease next time! :D

I have not made this personnally YET, but will make it very very soon.  A friend served this last night at a small group meeting and it was fantastic.  It was a huge hit!!!  She did say she used fat free half and half and fresh mushrooms.  What a great recipe!!

Mmmm, yummy. I would rate this 5 stars, except for it being dry after baking. I should have took the other review's advice to add an extra half a cup of broth.

Out of all the recipes I've tried from AllRecipes.com, this one was probably the biggest hit with my family.  They LOVED it, as did I.   I didn't make a single change (except to double the recipe) and it came out perfectly!  Many thanks for sharing!

This is SO yummy! My husband...who is a strict meat and potatoes guy....loves this!  Kids love it too.  I double the sauce when I make it so it's not too dry.  Add some garlic bread and applesauce and it's a great meal!  Lefovers are awesome too.

This is a very yummy recipe.  I was surprised that my 4 year old wanted seconds (not the mushrooms).  I added the evaporated milk and it was perfect.  I would add some garlic next time for some extra flavor.  I threw everything together in the morning and baked it when I got home.  I know we will be making this often.

Really good and easy- my 8 year old made it. We added 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper though, and used Kluski's short egg noodles instead of spaghetti. We doubled the sauce recipe as another reader suggested, and also added fresh parm cheese to the mixture before baking. We used fresh mushrooms that were sweated. We will make again, and it was a good suggestion to be able to make ahead of time and keep in the fridge until ready to bake.

Easy and tasty recipe. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and dry vermouth instead of sherry because that's what I had and the result was very good.

The only modification I made was to increase the sherry to 3 Tbs. For the chicken, I used grilled chicken breasts seasoned with garlic salt, pepper, dried oregano and basil. It turned out perfectly!

This was really great!  It definitely needed the extra liquid.  When I reheated this after freezing it I added a cup of Italian breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese (half and half) and one cup of toasted almonds and that made it even better!

I made this for an afternoon party yesterday and it turned out great!  Modified according to some of the reviews.  Doubled the recipe except for the pasta, used only 8 oz.  Added 2 tsp. onion powder with the flour.  Lightly sprinkled the chicken breast pieces with garlic salt and black pepper before sauteeing in a little olive oil; sauteed the mushrooms with a tsp. of garlic paste.  Topped with Sargento 6-cheese Italian blend instead of just parmesan.  It was delicious and everyone liked it!  Although there are several steps to the recipe, it's not too time consuming.  Will definitely make it again.

Great recipe. To make it healthier, I used 1/4 c olive oil and sauteed the mushrooms and garlic in oil and then added whole wheat flour. Used 1% milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 and used 1/2 whole wheat spaghetti and 1/2 regular pasta. Also used an extra cup of broth (doubled the recipe).

I did a few changes as other's recommended. I cooked onion and celery first in the butter and added garlic. I also used white wine bc I didn't have sherry. I used regular cream bc I had no heavy cream. It was good, but I think it could have used another kind of cheese. I served with a ceasar salad and the family really liked it. I give it 4 stars only bc I'd like to experiment with another cheese next time.

This is a very good basic recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms and added fresh basil and onions.  I used evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream.  I only used 2 spaghetti portions because just my husband and me and there was plenty of sauce for that amount of spaghetti.  When serving I sprinkled on crushed red pepper.  Next time I will add some sliced green olives.

Easy and great!  My family loved this!  I took other suggestions and sauteed my onions and garlic in butter and olive oil.  I then added chicken. Also, I added a pinch of italian seasonings, pinch of red pepper and 2 T of red wine - yummy!  Only one bite left!

This was too bland for me. This recipe really needs some extras. We made the recipe exactly as stated except cooked it in the oven for 20 minutes versus the 30 advised. My pasta came out very dry. Some of my pasta had to be pulled out of my plate because it was so dry and hard. I don't think the oven step is even neccessary. Just mix it all together and eat. I will try this again but with many modifications. Sorry

As long as you have the patience to mix the sauce correctly instead of just dumping ingredients in, this recipe is SO good! It came together easily and has room for variation. I made it straight from the recipe but garnished it with more parm cheese and sliced green onions and it turned out great! A very good recipe for an "after work" meal for the family...it was a hit! Thanks!

I wanted to try something new with a left over rotisserie chicken. My bf suggested this dish because its his "favorite", but I had never had it.  It was tasty, but dry even after adding plenty of milk after I scooped it into the baking dish.  I topped it with Ritz cracker crumbs, but still thought it lacked flavor.  Think I will try a Chipotle Chile Pepper and Panko crumb topping if I fix it again.

Delicious. Substituted cream of mushroom for the heavy cream (didn't have any), then substituted some sauteed onions for the mushrooms. Flavor and texture of the sauce was still excellent. Added some small chunks of Velveeta to the mixture just before baking, and covered with parmesan as instructed. The chicken I used was marinated and cooked in a pan w/ olive oil. The sauce and crunchy parmesan crust makes this dish. Thanks!

This recipie was okay..I agree with the others when they say it lacked a little flavor.  I will try it again, but alter some things to give it more of a kick.

I loved this. Used 2% milk and an 8 oz pkg. fresh mushrooms and some of my leftover turkey.  Have used chicken too.  Sometimes I put in wine and sometimes not.   If you're watching calories, use lo or fat free stuff but keep the wine to kick up the flavor.

Delicious!  Just double the liquid ingredients otherwise it turns out a little dry.

Made it again...someone asked if there was bacon in it and thought that sounded like an awesome idea. May try that next time. Definitely a hit with the kids and grownups!

This recipe is only okay.  I'm not a chicken tetrazzini purist, but I much prefer the "Easy Chicken Tetrazzini" recipe by Marian Collins.  It's easier, doesn't require as many ingredients, and just has a better taste--uses cream of chicken soup as part of the sauce.  I'm not fond of the sherry in this recipe, it needs more salt, and just something isn't satisfying about the flavor.  We'll eat it and enjoy it, but I won't make it again.

I used whole wheat spaghetti and substitued 1% milk for the half and half. I added about a 1/2 cup of shredded mozzerella to the roux with the sherry. I sauted a red bell pepper, fresh mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlic in olive oil then added that to the cooked chicken. Then added that mixture to the roux.

This recipe is great, and very versatile! I didn't have any mushrooms, but I added some frozen chopped spinach instead and it was GREAT! :) I also didn't have any cream, and just used the thickest milk I had on hand which worked just fine. My husband suggested next time adding some frozen peas which I think I'll try. The sauce was rich and creamy and so easy to prepare! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I also added garlic, minced onion plus some peas for a little color. Next time would add more cream or try milk for lower fat version. Not "saucy" enough. Overall, good and quick meal!

This was a good meal- I also used fresh mushrooms sauteed with olive oil garlic and onion. I used 1% milk instead of heavy cream and ww noodles and it seemed to turn out just fine. I did add some parm to the sauce once it was bubbly- probably made it a bit more rich. Topped it off with italian seasoning, bread crumbs and parm.

I've made this recipe a few times, always turns out great!  I tend to add more seasoning in any recipe I cook, and this case is no different, I used seasoning salt, a garlic-flavored all-seasoning mixture and a little powdered chicken bouillion when I cook the chicken.  Other than that, I pretty much follow the recipe.  Today, however, I substitued skim milk for the heavy cream and peas for the mushrooms.  Still turned out quite tasty.  I usually increase the sauce by about half, so it's never dry.  This one is a hit with my family!

This was fantastic.  I was short on Parmesan cheese, so I topped it with a little bit of a "pizza mix" I had on hand.  Definitely will make this again!

This is one of my favorite dishes, and this recipe is close to the one I work from. I use half a store-bought rotisserie chicken, fresh portabello sliced mushrooms (just add to the sauce for a minute or two before boiling), only 2 tbsp of butter and skim milk to reduce the fat content. I also use whole wheat blend spaghetti (Healthy Harvest). My kids love this stuff. But I really think this is more like 5-6 servings even with the calorie reduction -- and we're not tiny people.

Made this for tomorrow night. I have a really busy day tomorrow and wanted something that seems like I can make ahead of time, so I took some of Sarah B's pointers and made it up until the last step which is the baking. I'll do that tomorrow night.  Anyway, I tasted it when I poured it into the casserole dish and it was great!! Like Sarah, I cooked the chicken in oil and crushed garlic.  Took the chicken out of the pan and made the roux with the chicken bits.  I also added the nonfat evaporated milk (trying to save on the fat, since I used the real butter), and since I didn't have Sherry, I used my hubby's homemade red wine...what the heck, right?  Also used Chicken Stock in stead of Broth only because it was in the house.   Simple enough recipe and so far, it's good. Hopefully it will refrigerate and heat well tomorrow.

So good! I added frozen peas and canned mushrooms, and put some panko breadcrumbs and cheddar cheese on top, and mixed a little bit of extra cheddar cheese in the whole thing. Next time I'll add onions, too. I'll definitely be making this again. My boyfriend loved it.

Very good recipe! I added garlic, onions, & fresh mushrooms.  I used 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth as others suggested.  I think next time I will season the chicken with creole seasoning just to spice it up a little.

This is a basic guideline for tetrazzini that needed embellishment. The only thing I really followed was the sauce. I ended sauteing fresh mushrooms, garlic, and onions with cubed chicken and then making the alfredo sauce in the same pan to pick up the little bits. Turned out well with the extra flavors. Needed a lot more salt and pepper for my taste as well.

This is a very good basic recipe, but I did add/change a bit and spice it up.  I think as is it is a little bland.  I used egg noodles instead of spaghetti.  I also added frozen peas and diced red pepper.  I started with a sauteed onion and garlic to add additional flavor and threw in some dried herbs I had on hand when with the onion and garlic.

My husband and I love this dish.  As it's written I give it 4 stars but substituting canned mushrooms for fresh and adding garlic powder makes it 5.  I've also added fresh minced garlic and onion and it's fab that way as well.

Very good.  Not bland if you season the chicken to taste.  Used poultry seasoning, sazon season all, white pepper.  Also sauteed mushrooms with a chopped onion and minced garlic.  Used 2% milk instead of heavy cream and added some finely shredded monterey-jack cheese to rue.  Also added finely crushed corn flake crumbs with Parmesan to make a crunchy topping. Will definately make again.

I gave this a 4, by bf gave it a 2.  I thought it was pretty good, but he thought it was very bland.  I have to admit, it is bland for the amount of work that goes into it, but its not too bad.

so yummy.  I made small changes.  Used fresh mushrooms and sautéd them with garlic and onion.  Just used milk instead of cream and shredded parm, romano, & asiago cheese on top.

I think this is a very good, simple recipe. I did add some chopped onion and garlic to the melted butter.  I also topped it off with some buttered bread crumbs.  2% milk was substituted for the heavy cream.

This is SO delicious! I have made this several times now. The sauce part of it really makes the whole dish. I substitute tuna for the chicken and skim milk for the half and half then add about 1/2 cup peas to the boiling pasta water right before I drain it. I also add a pinch of garlic powder to the sauce. I sometimes substitute egg noodles for the spaghetti when I want more of a tuna noodle casarole.

This recipe was good, using 8 oz sliced  fresh mushrooms, diced onions, minced garlic and fresh parsley.  I also used only 1 tbsp of butter and half and half, and shredded the chicken in large chunks.  I did need to add about a cup more half and half to make a little saucier.

I thought it was a little bland.  I would add some sauted onion and fresh parsley if I made it again.  It is good for kids because there is not much to it and if they don't like the mushrooms you can pick them out.

I thought this was great! Tasted similar to carbonara, but not as fattening and greasy. I added 1 small onion and 4 cloves of garlic, saute it in small separate pan.  I used 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, 1 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk.  After adding all the ingredients to the sauce mixture, I added alittle bit of salt and a handful of parsley.  Topped with panko bread crumbs and parm, baked for 30 mins, so so good!!! I aslo left out the sherry, don't like wine in my food.

Amazing dish.  I'm not a mushroom fan, so I didn't include those.  Yet, it was still incredible.  Only adjustments I made were topping the dish with herbs and putting garlic in the roux.  Definately planning to make this again.  Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic! The first time I made it was for a friend who'd had a baby and I wanted to give her something that would keep well. Not only she and her husband had it, but so did her sister and her parents. They asked me for the recipe, saying it was so good it had to have come from a box. Here are the changes I made, based on the other reviews... Pan-fried chicken in small amount of olive oil and used drippings for a rue; used Kluski egg noodles, instead of spaghetti; doubled the sauce; used a total of 6 Tbsp flour to thicken; omitted the sherry (didn't have any); omitted the mushrooms (friend's husband is allergic); added 2 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 cup shredded parmesan to sauce; topped with breadcrumbs and shredded parmesan and mozzerella. It's one of my favorite dishes!

Great recipe.  I cooked two chicken breasts in my crock pot all day with fresh sliced mushrooms and one cup of water.  When preparing the dish I followed the recipe exactly except for using low fat milk instead of cream and adding one small jar of pimentos for extra flavor and color. I used the broth in my crock pot instead of canned broth.  I sprinkled the dish with cracked pepper.  Very good family dinner recipe.

Per other reviewers I made a few changes. I used fresh button mushrooms sauteed in butter, garlic powder, and ~2 Tbsp sherry, when they were done I added and 1/2 c peas.   I used egg pappardelle because my whole grain pasta was bug infested.   Also per other reviewers I added more broth so I did 1c heavy cream, 1 c. chicken broth and 1/2 c. veggie broth.    Will make this again and again. Will try w/evaporated LF milk and make sure I have fresh garlic next time.

Very tastey.  I used fresh mushrooms.  The pasta dish is drier than expected, but it was still good.

I know that some of the reviews claimed that the sauce was bland, but I quite liked it.  It was mild, yes, but quite tasty, and the whole family gobbled it up (including a picky three year old).  This recipe is easy to prepare, feeds a lot, and tastes good.  Definitely a keeper!

pretty good, although I have to agree the sauce itself is sort of bland.  I used lf evaporated milk as suggested and it was plenty creamy, also added shredded mozzarella to the sauce and I have to say, I don't think it added much to the dish.  I added a red bell pepper and used whole wheat spaghetti, a nice addition.  all-in-all a solid recipe, thanks for sharing!

Not impressed at all. This was VERY bland. I was in a hurry so I didn't think about it too much at the time, but I definitely should have added more seasonings. It was definitely edible, but had virtually no flavor, although that is better than having bad flavor in my book.

This recipe came out really good.  I substituted the heavy cream with light cream.  Also, I used peas (about a half of a bag of frozen peas) instead of mushrooms.

A huge hit with my picky eater.  It was a little bland for me, next time will add a little garlic, and a bit more salt.  A new fixture in my monthly menu!

This recipe was went over well with my whole family. Even my pickiest eater cleaned her plate. Before making this i read many of the reviews so i made a few modifications. I doubled the amount of sauce and added about half a cup of an Italian cheese blend to it. I used fresh mushrooms which i sauteed with 2 cloves of minced garlic. And i used a 13 ounce box of spaghetti. I ended up with extra white sauce, which will be great for keeping re-heated leftovers from being to dry.

This was very good. I omitted the mushrooms but added frozed veggies: brocoli, corn, carrots - heated through of course.  I also added 2-3 cloves of minced garlic to the butter before adding the flour.  I also agree with another reviewer who said to double sauce-just preference.  I'll make this again, for sure.

Followed the recipe exactly.  My boyfriend loved although his only comment was "a little heavy on the butter".  Will try alternatives to lower the fat content.  Would welcome suggestions.

I really liked this recipe, but it was a little bland. I will add romano cheese to the sauce next time with some red pepper flakes. This should spice it up a bit. Over all...we liked it. It also heats up well for leftovers and travels well for a pot luck!

Loved this recipe!  I followed it except to add a bit more cheese because my family can't get enough of Parmesan. I doubled recipe and froze it.  It works well when I'm at school and not able to cook at night.  The only complaint I had from hubby and 3 kids was that I didn't make enough.  A KEEPER!

I made this for a family gift exchange/lunch Jan '08. There was enough for 9x13, and a large pie plate for Dave and I later. Serve with a crisp ceasar salad and good bread. Mix well before dividing to make sure all is moist.

This was a very simple and delicious recipe. My mom rated it 9/5 (!), my husband 4/5 and myself 5/5 as it was so easy to fix and I had most of the ingredients on hand. I used fresh mushrooms and some romano cheese, doubled all of the sauce ingredients, except the flour. I also sauteed garlic with the chicken in olive oil. Will definetly add this to our list of favorites.

I used what I had on hand and that was milk and turkey. There was not a lot of sauce. With the leftovers I made more white sauce and add more garlic and pepper. I will give this dish a second chance.

Pretty tasty. I didn't have sherry, so I don't know how that may have affected the taste. Easy recipe too! Next time I might make it a bit saucier. The sauce was absorbed by the noodles during the baking. The taste is much like cream of mushroom soup, but homemade and w/o all those preservatives!

Great recipe. Very tasty. Easy to make. My fussy teens loved the taste and texture.  I used fresh mushroom and added garlic.  The little bit that was leftover was delicious for lunch the next day.

We followed the advice of adding garlic and onion and chicken broth, half and half, and milk for the sauce.  This was a tasty treat we are sure to repeat again and again.

This turned out really great, although I would leave extra prep time for cooking the chicken. I added fresh red pepper and garlic to the chicken, then added the mushrooms to the mixture, and it turned out excellent!

A little bland , I added truffle oil which gave nice flavor.I also marinated chicken a day ahead in hazelnut oil garlic, parsley and salt which made it very moist.I also  did fresh mushrooms , garlic and onions (as others suggested) then deglazed with the sherry .All in all a good recipe.

made this for lunch with leftover chicken and didn't have sherry but had Chinese cooking wine so i used it and was worried that it might taste funky but it was delicious. i also threw in some chopped parsley. will make again.

This was a great base recipe. Like some of the other reviewers I added ingredients according to my tastes.  I added onion and fresh mushrooms after sauteing them in butter and garlic. I will make this again but cut back on the amount of flour in order to get a creamier sauce.

Doubled the sauce like many suggested. Sauteed diced/sliced green pepper, onion, garlic, fresh mushrooms in olive oil to add to the mix. 
Dish came out flavorful and very nice.

this was a fairly good meal. after reading reviews and making it, I know that I will definately make some additions and changes for the next time... I would add about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon garlic powder to the sauce, decrease amount of mushrooms to maybe 1.5 - 2 ounces. definately will try again and make enough to have a meal filler for another date.

I really wanted to like this one but it was just too bland.  I even took the suggestions of adding garlic, onion and fresh mushrooms.  Better, but still not flavorful enough for all the trouble.

I used leftover dark turkey meat & doubled the sauce, which I will not do next time.  I think the amount of sauce the recipe makes is plenty for the amount of meat. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 (it was all I had) & the sauce was plenty thick. I add my pasta to the sauce for the ratio we like, which is usually a lot less pasta than a recipe calls for.  I think the Sherry is a must, it's what gave the sauce it's distinct flavor.

I did like this recipe, but it is very bland.  I would make it again with a few adjustments.  I would use white wine instead of sherry.  I did use shallots and fresh mushrooms, which made it much better.

This was an easy enough recipe to follow.  My family enjoyed it.  I'm not sure I'll make it again, but then, it is easy.  Just made it because I had all ingredients and didn't need to go to store.  I used fresh mushrooms and added peas for color.

My husband and son both loved this.  Used the Kloski noodles garlic and doubled the recipe.  Had lots of left overs to freeze and to give plenty to my mom and another good friend--they both can use some calories!

Comfort food, total comfort food!  Absolutely delicious.  I used the Perdue Chicken Short-cuts from Costco to save time in the recipe preparation.  The only addition to the ingredients listed was some freshly grated nutmeg in the cream sauce.  (A Microplaner is the greatest kitchen tool ever invented!)  Sherry, heavy cream, parmesan cheese....oh my.  What is not to like with these ingredients???

Absolutely delicious. The touch of sherry was perfect. I used fresh mushrooms and milk instead of cream, and don't think the recipe suffered a bit. The whole family, including picky children, loved this!

This was just ok.  I used ground turkey instead of the chicken.  The leftovers froze well for a quick mid-week meal for my hubby.  It was lacking in something...

Very good! However I did make a few changes. I used 4 Tbsp. sherry and I think next time I will use 5. It was not at all boozy and it added a nice flavor. I also used Ezekiel 4:9 sprouted grain pasta linguine instead of regular spaghetti. That added a nice very subtle nutty flavor that we all enjoyed. I also used shitaki mushrooms that I sauteed in butter before adding to the casserole. It was wonderful! Thank you for a great recipe!

I was really looking forward to this dish as it sounded very good.  However, I was completely disappointed in it.  Perhaps I just don't like chicken tetrazzini (I had never had it before).  It was really bland, even though I followed a couple other reviewers advice and added a bit more spices for flavor, and I also doubled the sauce--can't imagine what it would have been like without doing that.  Sorry, but I just did not care for this and will not be making it again.  (I gave it 2 stars because my husband did eat his portion--I tossed mine and ate leftover stew.)

I made this last night and it is just fabulous.  I didn't have any sherry so I used what I had - Japanese sake!  Believe it or not, it worked.  If you use fresh parmesan, you may need to use less.  I like it but my mother thought it was a bit strong.  For a nice presentation, I turned the oven on broil for the last couple of minutes to toast some of the parmesan on top.  It looked and tasted great.  This is the best!  Try it.

I loved this - great use of leftover chicken and pasta.  In fact, I cleaned out my refrigerator with this one and dined like a Queen.

Just for the record, my son told me that it was definately good, but "not briliant".

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times and everyone always loves it!!!!  I grill the chicken but other than that I stick to the original recipe.

This is a good solid receipe that is easy to make and tasty, it could benefit however from a little something extra, some seasonings/garlic, just a little not to overpower.

Made this for dinner last night and everyone really enjoyed it.  It's kind of a comfort food thing, and quick and easy to prepare after coming home from work.  Also a great way to use up leftover roasted chicken!  However, next time I'll maybe add some peas for more color and taste.

This is a really good dish we all loved it.  You always can add in garlic, and different seasonings but I think it is great the way it is.  It is also pretty easy.

This was great - good leftover too.  I did add a clove of garlic to the butter when I was making the sauce.  I also used milk, not cream - worked fine.

It was Ok I'll definitely make it again. The kids loved it, but I wasn't in hog heaven. I was satisfied and happy but I didn't drool when I looked at the plate.

Oh my gosh, this was so good, even though I had to make a few changes.  I was out of spaghetti so I used egg noodles, and I didn't have any heavy cream so I substituted whole milk.  The kids gobbled theirs down, and my husband complimented my cooking--which doesn't happen too often.  Thanks, Mary!

I was a little disappointed because it was pretty bland. I would try this again but it needs a little something, I'm just not sure what

Simple and basic. No depth of flavor here though I added garlic and parmesan. Kids and husband really liked it but it just didn't do anything for me and I won't be making again.

This was very tasty.  I added fresh mushrooms and steamed chopped broccoli for some color and a little more sherry.  I shared the leftovers with a co worker and she couldn't stop raving about it.

Delicious!  Instead of cream, I used 1% milk, and I found I had to broil the casserole to brown the top.  My husband thought the recipe was a little bland except for the cheese topping, so next time I will add some parmesan to the white sauce.

We liked this very much with a few changes.  I seasoned the chicken with cajun seasoning before adding it.  I also halved the amount of pasta and added more cheese.  Excellent!

This was such a tasty dish. It was creamy and very simple to make. The time I made it, I added a clove of crushed garlic to the melted butter, peas and an extra can of mushrooms. I found that I doubled the chicken broth to make it more saucy. It turned out so DELICIOUS! A keeper. Thanks Mary.

I made this for a family dinner party and it was fabulous and everyone enjoyed it. I served it with a huge salad and increased the amount of cream and broth by half before cooking as there didn't seem to be enough sauce. Fabulous and I highly recommend it!

We all liked it very much, although it was best when just out of the oven and nice and warm. Next time I would marinate the chicken (it lacked any flavor) and also add some veggies. Overall, very simple and good.

This was a very good casserole, but it seemed to be lacking something...maybe a vegetable?  I would make it again though, we enjoyed it.
