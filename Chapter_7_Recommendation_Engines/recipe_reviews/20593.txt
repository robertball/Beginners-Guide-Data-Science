This is very good, and I like good, spicy Chinese food.  Some people criticize it for not being perfect restaurant quality, but c'mon, all we want is a very easy and quick recipe and this fits the bill.  And it tastes great.  HOWEVER, follow many of the other reviews and increase the spices, or it will be bland.  I doubled the garlic, doubled the ginger (used ginger powder), and added 2t garlic powder (easier than minced garlic).  Also added 1/4 t of red pepper flakes (1/2 t for some heat)and reduced sugar(used brown sugar) by about a third.  Also doubled the amount of beef stock which still made a nice thick sauce -- otherwise it is thick mud if you use the recommended amount of stock.  Cook the meat quickly and remove and add again when sauce begins to thicken so meat doesn't overcook.  These really are the recommendations of other reviewers but I thought I'd save you the time of looking at all the reviews.  I'll definitely make this again.

Tastey recipe, just needs a little tweeking.  Here's what I changed/added:  I used 2 tbsp Brown sugar, 4 tablespoons soy sauce, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 chopped large onion, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 (14 oz can beef broth), and also ended up using 1/4 cup flour to thicken the sauce.  I cooked the meat with the broth mixture, instead of seperatley, the meat turned out perfectly.  I will make this again, kids and husband loved it, no complaints, just needs something.

I gave this recipe five stars because it is an excellent recipe.  I made some changes to my taste, but that's because I like food somewhat spicy.  The first change that I made was to cook the round steak until tender before adding vegetables.  I also added one sliced onion to the simmering the meat. I also doubled the marinade and the sauce based on previous comments and also because I think I had more meat than the recipe called for.  I added chile oil, chili garlic sauce and substituted one teaspoon of sesame oil for oyster sauce.  My brocolli beef stood up to the best Chinese restaurants.  My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  It's easy to prepare and a must try.  I don't think you can really go wrong because you can add anything you like and it would probably still be good.  It has an excellent foundation to work with.

I am a tired, cranky, hungry college student with a microscopic kitchen and very little time to spend on cooking.  This recipe was everything I was looking for - quick, easy, very yummy and healthy.  After reading the reviews, I used 14 oz of broth, ground ginger, sirloin, and threw chopped onion in with the beef.  I also used frozen broccoli, because I'm lazy. =)  The sauce was perfect and was terrific over rice.  I think this recipe could be easily adapted to accomodate whatever ingredients you have on hand - and I think it might freeze well (I'm going to make extra next time and try freezing the leftovers to see how it goes).  Thanks so much - this one's going to be committed to my memory!

My family and I LOVE this recipe.  It's very yummy and satisfying.  I do make a couple of changes, though.  I use sirloin steak because it's more tender.  I use a bit more garlic and finely chopped ginger and I add sliced onions to give it that almost-Chinese-restaurant taste. I also separate some out for the kids and then add red pepper flakes to the remainder for my husband and I and our spicy palates!  Very yummy!

Wow this was great, I have been making beef broccoli for a while but it was always missing something...it was the ginger...the ginger added just what it had been missing and we loved it. Though I would have to say that after it cooks the chunks of ginger are a bit too much so instead I would use powdered ginger root or used bigger piecies of ginger and just remove it after its cooked. Overall this was a great meal that I am sure I will be making time and time again now.

EXCELLENT!!  I must admit that this is the best oriental recipe I have come across!  I listened to the advice of others in thier reviews and used ginger powder instead of the root.  I also tripled the sauce and will do the same next time.  It was great after I finished and me and my daughter loved it.  Adding an onion while beef was cooking was a great idea also.  Truly a favorite.

Quick and easy and so good!!! I loved the ginger flavor. I did have ginger root on hand but I just sprinkled some ginger powder and it tasted fine!!! The sauce was wonderful and I used Stir Fry Cut up Beef so it was really tender and super convenient! We served this with the new Lipton Asian side dishes...used the Beef Lo Mein. This tasted just like carryout Chinese!!! Thanks so much Sara..this is a definate keeper!

This was okay but nothing special.  Per other reviewers, I added chopped onion, additional garlic, bamboo shoots and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  Still, little taste and won't be making again.  Thanks but no thanks.

Delicious! I eaten a lot of broccoli beef and I must say that this is a pretty good recipe! I scaled this back to serve two people. I used boneless beef short-ribs instead of beef round steak mainly because it is a softer meat and won't toughen up as it cooks. I also stuck the meat in the freezer a bit so it would be easier to slice diagonally with a kitchen knife. Earlier I par-boiled the broccoli crowns in order to cut down on cooking time and also to retain it's vibrant green color. I just added the broccoli to hot, boiling water, turned off the stove and covered it with a lid and let it sit for a minute before draining. To the sauce I added a little more garlic and grated ginger to suit my tastes. I also doubled the amount of sauce because i know we all like a little more sauce over our rice. I browned the meat in the hot skillet for about 2 minutes on each side and quickly removed it to a plate. I added the garlic, ginger and flour/broth mixture and let it cook. I found that I had to add a little more beef stock to get the sauce to the right consistency. I added the meat back along with the broccoli. Within 5 minutes everything was done. The sauce is very tasty and savory with the right amount of ginger, garlic and beef broth. It is not too thick or too thin. The meat is very tender, flavorful and easy to chew. The broccoli adds a nice texture with it's crunch and green color. We enjoyed this dish served along with rice.

Excellent Dish.  Very good flavor.  A must-try. I added dried red chili pepper to add a little heat to the meal. I also used a little extra ginger, a 1/2 tsp total, and did not find it overpowering at all.

OK my intent to make as posted was very geniune, but never came to that point.  The outcome of the dish was delicious though.  I ended up slicing my beef sirloin on the grain and marinating in the 2 T soy sauce indicated with the ginger and garlic. But I then I did not know how to folow the exact recipe so I did the following:  to  the marinating meat I added 1 tsp sesame oil  and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes  Then I stir fried adding one can of beef broth mixed with 2 T of cornstarch and NOT the flour indicated on the receipe  Added broccoli and let simmer.  It was fabulous, but not as posted but I wanted to share none the less.  I used all of the listed ingredients, just did it my way;  I will give it 4 stars for ingredients but really needs the red pepper flakes.

Very nice recipe except it seemed to be missing a bit of a kick for our tastes so after I tasted it I added 1/4 tsp cayenne and 2 more TB soy sauce. PERFECT!  I will definitely make this again!

Beef n Broccoli has always been my family favorite... For those of you who find this recipe a bit bland (like I did :P) try marinading the meat first with: 
2 tablespoons oyster sauce,
1 teaspoon hoisin sauce,
1 teaspoon sugar,
2 tablespoon sweet soy sauce (kecap manis) - if you cant find it use 2 tbs soy sauce and 2 teaspoon brown sugar instead,
1 teaspoon sesame oil.
Let it marinade for half an hour or so before you stir fry it. Adding one whole onion chopped in rings with the broccoli is also nice. If you want it more stir fry like, just reduce the amount of broth used by half or more (and also the flour).

Easy... Yummy!  I followed other's suggestions and used top sirloin steak... sliced it thin while it was still a bit frozen.  I also added a handfull (will use 2-3 handfulls next time) of small mushrooms.  I put the broccoli in the last 2 minutes, because we like it a bit crunchy and not overcooked.
Thanks for this super easy recipe!

This is a quick easy and VERY tasty recipe! The key is to not over cook the ingredients. I followed the recipe to a T and the sauce is perfect as is. We have made this many times and will continue to do so! Thank you! :)

Delicious recipe. I added sliced onion and the garlic to the beef as it browned. I also doubled the sauce ingredients for our own preference. We like saucy chinese food. I used ground ginger instead of root. Basically, besides the onion- I did not stray from the original recipe and it turned out fantastic with a side of brown rice.

Loved it!  But...  threw it all in the slow cooker on high for an hour and a half instead of a skillet.  I doubled the beef broth and added a little water so the beef would be completely covered and I added the broccoli to the mix once the beef was cooked.  I added toasted sesame seeds to the top when it what all finished and it was AMAZING!!!!

I make this often and freeze it almost ready to cook. I put everything except the beef broth and broccoli into a quart bag and mix. Freeze flat then when ready to use I defrost - just cook all at the same time. Then pour the beef broth over and add the broccoli. Mix it all together and cook until broccoli just barely tender.

The sauce has a good flavor. I did double it based on prior reviews. I also doubled the garlic and ginger. I added onion, bamboo shoots, red pepper flakes and about 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. I did make the mistake of using round steak instead of sirloin, though, because that's all I had. It was tough and flavorless, I'll definitely use sirloin next time!

Here's a hint:  instead of slicing the beef, cut it in strips with kitchen shears.  Much faster and easier on the hands!  I thought this one was a little bland, and the consistency too thick.  Next time I will use more garlic, less ginger, less flour, and maybe some curry to help spice it up a little.

Super fast and easy to get this on the table. All finished in less than 30 min. The most work in this dish was the prep and that was just slicing and dicing. I used a sirloin steak and frozen broccoli. I thought it was rather bland overall and needed quite a bit of seasoning at the table while my husband enjoyed this and had seconds. This needs a little something to make it pop but I don't know exactly what flavor I am missing. I'll make this again since it was such a hit with my husband.

I didn't read the reviews before I made this, and I guess I should have. I don't usually follow a recipe exactly, but I did with this one. However, it came out extremely bland. I like all of the elements but it has no real flavor. Definitely needs salt, pepper and onion at a minimum.

We love this recipe.  I doubled the sauce, used left over roast beef and warmed it with some onion, celery, mushrooms and red pepper. Also added 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes.  Had this over some basmati rice.  Was awesome.  Thanks for the post.

I really love this recipe!  Like everyone else, I have a suggestion.  My husband and I only eat brown rice, and it takes quite a bit of time to cook.  I like to brown the beef and add all of the liquid ingredients except the flour and let it simmer on low while the rice is cooking.  Once the rice is almost done I add the broccoli, let it cook for a few minutes, and add the flour last.  It gives the beef time to soften and meld with some of the flavors of the broth.  Also, I like to broccoli to remain somewhat crispy.  Quite good.

Perfect. My husband loves this dish. I served it with fried rice restaurant style from the site. Others recommend doubling the sauce, but I thought it worked just fine as is. The meat turned out a little tough, but I'm not sure how to fix that.

I tried this one after reading the reviews and made the following adjustments: doubled the garlic, used 2 TBS of corn starch instead of the flour, used 3 slices of crystalized ginger (finely chopped)instead of the fresh, omitted the sugar, added 8 green onions sliced and added 1/2 tsp of sesame oil at the end of the cooking time.  It turned out really good.  Thanks!

Husband says Wow! But I changed a few things as other reviewers suggested. I tripled the garlic and fresh ginger,(fresh ginger is what makes this restaurant quality) added a med. onion (or 3/4 c. of green onions), and to spice it up, added 3/4 tsp. of red chili flakes. Also used sirloin instead of round steak and added an extra TB. of flour to the sauce. I also used beef bouillon instead of canned. You'll want to heat the bouillon a little and and whisk the flour in to prevent lumps. To cut down on time, I precooked the veggies in the microwave and added it to the sauce just before serving. A+++

Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! This was not  a traditional, asian flavored, broccoli and beef. This was a horribly bland, flour-like, and gravy over broccoli and beef.

This was outstanding!  Extremely easy to make and
absolutely delicious.  My kids (ages 4 and 2)
LOVED it.  I used a 14 oz. can of broth and
3/8 cup of flour to increase the amount of sauce
I also added a 4 oz. can of mushrooms.
This one is a keeper!!

This is *very* good.  It also works with chicken instead of beef (use chicken broth and omit the sugar).

Save your steak for something else! I made it the way it was written and it was a thick gooey mess even before adding the broccoli. There was nothing to steam the broccoli in so I added more broth...and more broth...to finally cook the broccoli. Needed more Soy and pretty much everything else to add flavor. It was just a sweet gooey mess of bland flour, meat and broccoli. Went to suggestions here and added more flavor before serving. Still not a winner in my house and a waste of expensive meat.

This was tasty and very quick to make. Not much fuss, perfect for a busy night or like for me tonight a lazy night :) I did use ground ginger instead of fresh since when I was at the store the fresh ginger looked very very sad. Worked fine. Thanks for the recipe.

The first time that I made this recipe I followed the directions exactly. It was okay, but did not taste like beef and brocolli that I was used to. Since then I cooked the meat longer to make it more tender, I add more seasoning and instead of using flour I skip it and then add cornstarch at the end to thicken it up. I think it comes out better that way but that is just my opinion.

Delicious! I followed the directions and at the end tasted my finished dish. It was great but then i decided to add about 1 tablespoon more of soy sauce and i used a little more than 1/4 tea of ground ginger. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is amazing! I like mine really saucy, so I add more beef broth, soy sauce and garlic to my recipe, and it's still awesome! When I cook this for my father I use gluten free flour and you can't taste the difference!

I've never had much luck getting the sauce to come out right for beef and broccoli before but this recipe was perfect! I doubled the garlic and used 1/2 tsp powdered ginger since I didn't have fresh. I made the full sauce recipe with half the broccoli and beef, since my husband is in Iraq and I'm cooking for one these days. The extra sauce was great for dipping with egg rolls and over rice. I used sirloin steak instead of round steak since that's what I had on hand, and cut it very thin. I'll definitely be making this one again, over ad over again! I live in Germany where good Chinese food is not easy to come by and with the above mentioned changes, this tasted just like I remember getting at Pei Wei but with a fraction of the fat! Thanks!

Very good, but a little too sweet for my tastes (and I only used half the sugar). Still, I will make this again with a few changes.

Mmmmmmmmm!!!!!  A lot of other reviewers had said this recipe was very bland.  To save it, I used added some hoisin sauce and sesame oil to the mix. I also substituted beef bouillon powder for the broth and corn starch for the flour.  I sauteed some onions and garlic and also added some red pepper to the mix.  I added more water and soy to make more sauce and it was pretty tasty! Thanks!

I doubled my meat and guess-timated on the broccoli.  I used two cans of 14.5 oz beef broth (I also seasoned my meat with garlic, pepper, and onion, then added chopped onion as well).  The result was not restaurant quality, but very, very good--I had no complaints, only requests for second helpings from the kids.  I felt it was missing something in the sauce (and it was a little sweet IMHO).  I'll have to play with it a little.  I cheated and didn't use rice--I made ramen noodles (without the seasoning packet) and used them instead of rice--it was a HUGE hit, and a different twist.

I am in total SHOCK!!!  Finally something my whole family has enjoyed!!.  My six yr old ate it, my 2yr old ate it (and didnt throw it, at least not all of it anyway..) and so did my 10 month old!!!  I did use more garlic and no ginger (didnt have any) and used beef stock powder instead of broth.  Still turned out GREAT!!

This was tasty and I plan to make it again. My husband is not a big fan of Chinese food, but he really liked this.  I added quite a bit more garlic than the recipe calls for since we like that flavor. Next time I think I'll use a more expensive cut of meat like flank steak. The round steak was OK, but not outstanding.

I have always made Beef & Broccoli using the packet of spices from the grocery store.  I had none today and so tried this recipe.  Husband & kids LOVED IT!!  And it was so easy!  Took less time than the fried rice I made to go with it!!

This recipe was soooo tasty. It really had the flavor and consistency of a restaurant dish.  For variation, next time, I might toss in a handful of cashews.  Mmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I recommend serving with rice because the sauce is so good, and I'll probably make an extra batch of the sauce because my husband just couldn't get enough.  I'm picky and not a great cook, so if it turned out for me you know it must be good.

Overall, it was a nice recipe although I didn't really like the sauce that much. I spread some roasted sesame on top - it gives a special kick to that dish.

Very easy and alot like the restuarant style. I added slices of sweet vidalia onion to it and it added a little something "extra". My family loved it-especially my 5 yr. old

I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for some heat, but otherwise made no changes, and it was just like our local delivery place's Beef and Broccoli. I think next time, I'd add some onions and maybe some mushrooms as well.

Made as written, otherwise I would be reviewing my "variation" and honestly I think that would not be fair. That said, the dish was very good but we are not big ginger fans so next time I make it I would just use a pinch of ginger powder instead of fresh ginger. We were happy with the other flavors and didn't think it was to sweet as others did. I would also like to add about 1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper, more garlic, sliced onion and look forward to trying this recipe again in the near future, with my minor changes.

Our family equated it to chop suey rather then beef broccoli.  Cooked with onion, garlic and ginger but just missing that tangy zing like takeout.  Will keep looking and experimenting.

This is really good!  I made it with sliced turkey breast fillets because my husband doesn't eat red meat or pork and it was just as tasty.  Served it with brown rice and egg drop soup.

Not at all like Chinese Restaurant Broccoli Beef; which I assumed it was poorly trying to imitate.  Also not good.  With some last minute add ins of extra soy sauce, extra ginger, extra sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, and red pepper flakes I was able to cover up the flour taste of the sauce.

I plan on trying to make broccoli beef again at home but don't see a reason to try to make this particular recipe work by tweaking as there is little worth saving...I knew it was odd that it called for flour when most asian dishes use cornstarch; should have read the 1 star reviews first.

If you make this and also don't like the sauce use a slotted spoon to salvage the good part.

Flavor was good but "sauce" is like a gravy, might try with less flour next time if I make it again. Picky family not impressed.

I made some of the suggested modifications and thought this recipe was OK.  I see that if I didn't change it, it would have been bland.  It isn't restaurant-quaility, but it is quick and easy.  I would make this again because of the ease, but I would continue to tweek it.  Also, one child loved it and the picky one did so-so with it which is pretty good.

To make this good recipe great, make the following changes:
* Double the sauce.
* Add 2 tablespoons of Garlic Chili Sauce (a little less if you don't like spicy).

Also, don't forget that you can substitute 1 can of beef broth for 2 cups of water and 2 beef bouillon cubes.

An average-tasting dish. Needed salt and I felt like it was just lacking something to give it a kick. If I tried it again I might try red pepper flakes.

not a fan of the sugar, It made it a little to sweet for me. The meat was a little tough. I think next time I will make the round steak early and simmer a few hours in the beef broth before putting the broccoli in.

This just didn't taste the way it should.  Something in the ingredients just isn't right, it may be the sugar.  If you don't know how Chinese food is suppose to taste, it may be alright, but I will keep looking for a better recipe.

Overall this had a great flavor. I ended up making extra sauce. Next time I think I would make the sacue with cornstarch for more of a glaze rather than a gravy. I feel it would be more authentic (at least compared to American Chinese food) that way.

I followed the recipe exactly as is except for seasoning the beef with a little salt, pepper and garlic while it was cooking to give it a little more flavor. We used top round roast thinly sliced. The portions were perfect and the sauce thickened up beautifully! Highly recommended!

I am giving this 3 stars.  I agree with reviewer MikeT that the flour/liquid ratio doesn't work.  Less flour more liquid or you will end up with glue.  Also, next time, I will triple up on the ginger and the rest of the spices because this was too bland. I used brown sugar and then added additional white sugar for sweetness, I did not add ground red pepper but only because I have to stay away from spicey foods.  If not, I would have gladly added that bit of hot in the mix.  I like this recipe because you can add anything you want, play with it and it will still be good. The only thing I think is wrong with this recipe is that there is way too much flour which gave it a floury undertaste. I would make rue next time, using corn starch rather than flour and slowly add this into the liquids just for thickening and so that the flour does not overpower the spices. Otherwise, this is a good, healthy recipe.

Recipe tastes very similar to what you get in the restaurant. The sauce could use a little more flavor though. I added water chestnuts, onions, and bean sprouts for a little variety and it was great.

As advised, I doubled the ginger (powder) and garlic, and added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  I was a little confused by the broth - the size can listed is for the Campbell's condensed and I wasn't sure if I should water it down.  Added two condensed and it went okay, a little too salty and the sauce didn't thicken until reheated as leftovers, but the flavor was good so it worked just fine for a college kid :) I would definitely recommend it.

This was a decent recipe. My husband liked it (and he's extremely picky). The only thing that I changed was that I browned the meat in sesame oil, then added the ingredients as is. It was not the authentic beef and broccoli but it was good.

I substituted already prepared chopped garlic rather than fresh as I didn't want the aroma to permeate my skin prior to going to work. My husband said it was better than the Asian restaurants, no two flavors dominating the other just the perfect balance.

This recipe is fantastic!  I doubled the sauce (with no sugar and store bought ground ginger)and added a chopped onion.  I got home from work, put on some rice, and in 30 minutes when the rice was done so was the broccoli beef!  I thought the flavor was very close to restaurant quality, and in my opinion you can't beat a quick and healthy dinner that also tastes great.

The flavor was pretty ok, but my husband said I should have marinated the beef first. I wasn't crazy about the texture of the sauce. I doubled it, but if I were to make again I would cut the flour in half. I thought it was too thick and "slimy". I also added crushed red pepper which helped things some.

This is a GREAT recipe.
I don't know why everyone was changing everything about it.
I added an extra clove of garlic and a tad more broth -- but realized in the end that it would have been better without it.
Really.  This is a simple and tasty recipe!

Fairly tasty but the garlic and ginger needs to be doubled to really add flavor.  I would mix the sauce using the ginger and use half as a marinade for the meat first.  I would also use cornstarch as the thickener instead of flour as it is the flour that creates the blandness when the spices aren't doubled.  I made mine with broccoli and zucchini but matchstick carrots are good too if you want more than one vegetable.  Chili pepper flakes add a nice zing if you like a little heat with this kind of dish.

this was pretty darn delicious. I didn't realized we were out of soy sauce, so used Worcestershire sauce instead. I used 2 cloves of minced garlic, added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (we like spice), doubled the broth, and added onions. Very good. Would be great over rice, but we ate it alone to cut down the carbs. Still very filling.

This was pretty good but i didn't think the sauce was quite right. I little bland and not thick enough for my tastes. I tried adding a bit of flour to the juices the thicken it a bit, which helped, but the texture was still off. 

Great flavor though

As-is, this recipe is good, but I added a few extra spices to make it really tasty. I doubled the garlic, used ground ginger instead of fresh (it was what I had on hand), added 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp of onion powder.  I also used reduced sodium soy sauce, and omitted the sugar.  A quick, easy, and tasty recipe!

We didn't care too much for this recipe. It makes a lot of sauce and the broccoli shrunk and got very limp while simmering in it.  The flavor was okay but we probably won't make this one again.

i've been making this for years. delicious way to use up not so tender cuts of beef, any kind will do. i never tenderize mine, just slice it thinly. i never measure spices, but i'm sure i add more ginger than is called for. also, i usually add carrot peels for added vitamin c and color, and water chestnuts, when i have them. i add extra liquid to make more sauce.

I have bee using this recipe for about 6 years now and I LOVE it! I'm very picky and love just the broccoli and beef over rice. I always use flank steak and double up on the 'sauce' ingredients. Serve it over some good Japanese rice and it's to die for!

Wow what a great recipe! Tasted just like Chinese takeout only better. I did make a few changes. First, I marinated the beef in soy sauce for a few hours, and then instead of just broccoli, I used a mixture of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. I also left out the ginger since I didn't have any.

This was delicious.  I did however, forget a part of the recipe, I forgot to add a beef boulion cube to my water to make the broth (I think I will keep on forgetting about it).  I also substituted teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce & sugar, and added about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  Oh - and I used frozen broccoli florets, worked well, I did take the beef and broccoli out of the sauce when it was heated and then let the sauce thicken more before I poured it back over the beef and broccoli.  YUM

My husband and I love asian food but have trouble finding good recipes.  This one was a huge hit!  I didn't have beef broth so I improvised and made my own by defrosting my meat in a little water and wha-la! beef broth.  It was fantastic!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I would reccomend more soy sauce and ginger, at least double what is in recipe.  For a healthier option to the sugarand if you don't like it as sweet, try honey about 2-3 TBS.

We loved this. After reading reviews I made some modifications. I used a 14 oz can beef broth, used brown instead of white sugar, doubled the soy sauce, used sirloin steak instead of round, used ground ginger instead of fresh & doubled the ammount, doubled the garlic & added 1 t sesame oil. I also added 1/4 t of red pepper flakes but my husband said it made it too hot so I won't use them again. This was soooo good. Just like it came from a Chinese restaurant. I made it with Fried Rice Restaurant Style & Best Egg Rolls Ever from this site. Thanks.

This recipe is so quick and easy. It is a great weeknight recipe. I have used flank steak and find that it works well. I followed other suggestions and added red pepper flake and water chestnut.  Delicious. Thanks for submitting.

Delicious! We have made this several times and love it. It is simple and made with stuff we generally always have in the pantry. Tastes like from the restaurant but better.

I liked it but the meat was cooked way too long. Instead of following the recipe, next time I will cook the meat only for a few minutes and make sure the broccoli is steamed before I mix it so the broccoli won't be cruchy and the meat won't be overly cooked

I thought this was very good. Only change I made was to use 2 TB of cornstarch instead of the flour. The sauce was perfect consistancy, not too thin, but not thick like gravy either. I didn't think it was bland at all, but I don't like spicy food, so this was perfect.

Very good fast and easy.  A true 5 in my book as it dosen't need anything changed to make it taste great but it still has the flexability to be changed if you want too.  I have made it as is, with red or green peppers, carrots, onions, waterchestnuts or a combination of the above. It is great over just plain rice or fried rice or even noodles.

My husband and I felt the sauce was uninteresting and bland, however we do think it's a good base for a stir-fry.  We didn't have enough ingredients to double it, as other reviewers suggested, but this wasn't a problem.  It definitely made enough to mix with the rice.  We used the frozen stir-fry beef (already cut into small pieces), to cut down on prep time.  The meat and the broccoli were good.  Next time we'll add big pieces of onion and more garlic and ginger.

Okay, maybe I'm just picky, because my dad lived in many different Asian countries, and can cook the best beef and broccoli, but this was NOT anywhere as good. It smelled really good, and looked really good...but the taste just wasn't there. I even added some red pepper sauce to spice it up, didn't help. It was just bland. Then added some more soy sauce, still didn't work. Won't make this again.

This was nothing that I would get excited about having again.  It didn't have a distinct flavor, except for a hint of ginger.  The meat was tough.  Overall, a pretty generic meal.

I have never used ginger in anything before but, plan on looking for some new ginger recipes soon.  This recipe was very tasty.. quick and oh so good!  My husband wants it in our "Top Ten List" and my 4 year old son even liked it!!!  If you want a good meal w/o putting all the time into I suggest you to try this one... it's rated A for Awesome.

Wow, I made real chinese food! My husband liked this more than me. I will make it again - all was great except the ginger was too strong. Next time I will try ground ginger or omit it all together. Other than that it was great. My husband loved the ginger.

I used stew meat because it's what I had on hand. I also Used a sugar substitute in place of the white sugar; No one knew the difference. This was quick, easy and flavorful and had just enough sauce (I usually double the sauce,  but didn't have to) Served with brown rice. Add red chili flakes for some spice or any other veggies such as peppers, water chestnuts, carrots or bamboo shoots. Makes great leftovers!

The flavour itself was okay but I think cornstarch would be a better option for this recipe. Also the meat should be stir fried first and removed and then stir fry broccoli and any other veggies and then add the meat back with the sauce with cornstarch in it rather then flour.

It was okay.... We used brown sugar instead of white sugar, as recommended by reviews, and it tasted much better than the first time we made it. The white sugar made the sauce taste too sweet, so the brown sugar was a good alternative to take that down a notch. Still a bland dish though, at least when following the recipe. It really needs something extra to add some more flavor, maybe onions. We'll probably continue experimenting with this one. The ginger root and garlic was very yummy and noticeable in the dish. (Edit: We've been making this dish for quite a few months. It's definitely best when you use brown sugar and use WAY more ginger root and garlic than suggested - basically add as much as you think will be good to bring out the flavors. This recipe has grown on me since I first made it, so I'm upping my 3 stars to 4.)

HOWEVER, follow many of the other reviews and increase the spices, or it will be bland. I doubled the garlic, doubled the ginger (used ginger powder), and added 2t garlic powder (easier than minced garlic). Also added 1/4 t of red pepper flakes (1/2 t for some heat)and reduced sugar(used brown sugar) by about a third. Also doubled the amount of beef stock which still made a nice thick sauce -- otherwise it is thick mud if you use the recommended amount of stock. Cook the meat quickly and remove and add again when sauce begins to thicken so meat doesn't overcook. These really are the recommendations of other reviewers but I thought I'd save you the time of looking at all the reviews. I'll definitely make this again.

Pretty good, lacking a bit in flavor. I did season the meat with salt and red pepper flakes before cooking and used ground ginger instead of fresh. Also added some green onions. The kids did really like it, so that was a plus. I would use this basic recipe again but maybe find something different for the sauce.

Made this for the second time and it is very close to restaurant quality and taste, if you follow some of the modifications in the reviews.  I doubled the sauce recipe and parboiled the broccoli, and added an onion.  Will keep this in our rotation.

This recipe was so good! I am very picky about my Chinese take-out and this will replace it! I bought pre-tenderized round steaks and cooked the strips in sesame oil. The sauce/gravy was amazing! We were impressed. It thickened perfectly and there was plenty of extra sauce for the rice.

Didn't have enough flavor for me, but it was still good.  I just increased the soy sauce and added some hot to it.

Tastes just like the dish you order at a Chinese restaurant. I used venison, as that's what we had, and overcooked it just slightly. But that did not much take away from the flavor of this dish. Highly recommended.

HOLY COW....this if a really easy and tasty recipe.  I have a left over "chain" from a beef Tenderloin.  I decided to try this recipe since it seemed so easy.  IT WAS!! I added more garlic and cooked the beef with some garlic powder.  Other than that, I didn't change anything.  WE LOVED IT...Thank you for such a nice, simple and tasty Valentine's Day Dinner...

Great recipe. I gave it 5 stars because it deserves 5. The only thing I changed, because I had to, was the Ginger. I did not have ginger root, I used ground ginger. The flavor of the beef and broccoli was close to what you get from a chinese restaurant. I served it over rice pilaf and everyone loved it!!!!

I made this today and the only change I made was to add more vegetables. I added onion, red bell pepper, celery, carrot and yellow squash. Because of the added vegetables I needed to cook it a little longer. It was excellent. My family raved about it. It is so good to find a dish that my daughter can eat.
She can only have 10 grams fat total for a meal and this one has only 3.2 grams. Great!

This was OK.  The sauce, as others have said, was pretty bland.  It looked awesome and smelled awesome, but there just wasn't a whole lot there.  It could use some more spice and flavor.  It's not going to ruin your meal or anything, but it's just extra work if the sauce doesn't add much.

So unbelievably good.  I cooked my meat longer to get it softer for our kids to be able to eat easier and then added the broccoli so it wasn't mushy from overcooking.

This was stunningly amazing. It is so much better than the Chinese Resturaunts for a couple reasons, one being that it is not greasy at all. And two because I know what is going in this, in the resturaunts they put food additives in it that make it unhealthy. However I did change a few things. I did not use that much sugar, I put about 3 pinches of sugar in it. Otherwise I would find it too sweet. I also added one red pepper, it gave it a little more color and was a better substitute for all that sugar. This recipe goes great with fried rice! 

(P.S. this is my moms account, and even she would tell you that I am a VERY picky eater. I really did enjoy this. So if you have pikcky eaters on your hands, maybe they will like this!)Yummy!

This was very good.  We made some changes at the recommendation of other reviewers.  We doubled the beef broth and added extra fresh ginger and Garlic.  We also added 1/2 of a white onion, some sliced mushrooms and some red pepper flakes to taste.  While cooking, I tasted and felt it still needed more flavor, so...I added some salt, more soy sauce, sesame oil and red pepper flakes until I had the desired taste.  We took out the beef after cooking, and added it back in with the mushrooms when there was only a few minutes of simmering left.  We also simmered with a lid on.  It was good once we made these changes.

I really don't have any complaints on this one - - it was fine.  Edible, but not good enough to make it into my recipe box.  My thoughts on it:  1) There is enough sauce as written.  2) It had enough flavor for my tastes.  3) I bought Campbell's beef broth and I think it would have been better with bouillon cubes mixed with water instead.  4) I always use ground ginger instead of ginger root - - I used about 1/8 tsp.  5) I didn't add onion, but I think this would be good to add.  6) Easy dish to make.

This was delicious! I made it just as ordered, but I used 1.25 pounds of beef because I like when there is more meat in these types of entrees. 

I used pre-minced garlic from a jar and powdered ginger from the spice section, and I think it tasted great.

I also added about 1/3-1/2 white onion, cut into about 3/4" square pieces.  I added this after bringing the mixture to a boil, before simmering for 5-10 minutes. They were the perfect in-between state of raw and cooked, and they were delicious.

Enjoy! :)

This was delicious!  I did make a couple of changes...I used 1 tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tbsp of white, and I left out the ginger root, primarily because I forgot to get any at the store!  I added a little pepper....and VOILA!  Perfect!  I will definitely keep this on the regular dinner rotation!

I love this recipe. It has become a staple in our household. It is so easy to make and tastes way better than the sodium/MSG-laden versions at Chinese restaurants. I will never do Broccoli Beef take-out ever again! EXCELLENT recipe!

Doubled the ginger (used powdered so kept the amount about the same as you would fresh) and probably could have added more. Doubled the garlic and added red pepper flake. Did the broth at 1.5 times the amount in the recipe and that was perfect. This was really very good. I made two freezer meals out of the ingredients. I separated the meat, veggies and sauce into separate freezer bags and froze them with directions. Thanks!!

I wasn't too sure about making this, but we had all the ingredients that needed to be used up so I gave it a try.  We were very impressed!  I have to say that while it was cooking it didn't look too appetizing, but it really was delicious!  My husband, after one bite, asked me to make this again.  He doesn't usually comment on what I make, so he must really like this.  I didn't have beef broth so I used chicken broth.  And I used powdered ginger rather than fresh.  Very very good.  Very very easy!

I give the reviewers that posted their changes 5 stars, the basic recipe I will give 3 stars since by itself it seems mediocre.    Based on other suggestions I changed the recipe:  beef broth (10 oz), 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp soy sauce, ½ tsp ground ginger, 2 cloves minced garlic, ¼ tsp red pepper flakes, ½ cup chopped green onion, and ½ tsp black pepper, stirring together with the ¼-cup flour.  The gravy was good.     Next time I make will have to remember to take a picture to share!

This recipe is awesome. Super fast and easy. It tastes just like take out.  I also used a 14.5 oz can beef broth and added a tbsp of cornstarch to the sauce mix.  The fresh ginger makes all the difference. This was a huge hit in our home, even our 2 year old daughter liked it, she kept dipping her fingers in the sauce.

Good, but even while doubling ginger, adding garlic powder and 1 tbsp oyster sauce and some pepper flakes, still lacking something. Will read reviews and see what else I could change.

Tastes excellent with a few minor changes.  Double the sauce, used ground ginger, fried steak with onion and used brown sugar instead of white.  I am very impressed!

Good recipe...After reading some of the reviews, I marinated the meat overnight with ~2tbsp soy sauce, 4 minced garlic cloves, ~1-2tbsp fresh ginger and ~1 tsbp crushed red pepper to absorb some of the flavours. I also increased the broth and reduced the sugar.  Next time I would experiment with some more spices to intensify the flavour.

Hubby really enjoyed. Substituted honey for the sugar, added crushed red chilis for heat and doubled the amount of garlic and ginger. I served it over rice. Will probably make again.

First, I was impressed by how thick the sauce turned out.  Definitely did not need the corn starch.  I was, however, disappointed by how sweet this recipe was.  I'm not sure how i feel about my broccoli beef being sugary.  I think next time I'll cut back on the sugar by like 75% and add a little more salt.

See Mike T's review. Add rice vinegar and red pepper flakes plus lots of garlic powder.  Use brown sugar.  Marinate beef in teriyaki, lime, Dijon mustard and oil.  Thicken sauce with rice flour.  Serve over egg noodles.

I used 1.5 cups of chicken broth (didn't have beef), 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 2 T soy sauce (as written), a bunch of ginger powder (didn't measure), and lots of garlic powder (didn't measure). After simmering a few minutes, I tasted the sauce and it didn't have quite enough flavor. I added more soy sauce, more ginger, more garlic powder, a little honey, and a tiny bit of red pepper flakes. Turned out great! I think the beef broth would have added a lot more flavor than chicken broth, which is why I gave it 4 stars even with all my additions. Not restaurant quality, but very, very good, and easy. 2 people, no leftovers! My husband was enthusiastic, and he likes his food VERY flavorful :)

I used a ginger beef marinade and let the meat sit over night in it.Threw it in the crock pot on low for 6hrs.Then i used the "sauce" recipe from this recipe.Worked out great! The meat was tender and the flavor of the sauce went excellent with it! I used a bag steamed broccoli & one bag steamed stir fry veggies.Very yummy can't go wrong with this one! My kid's loved it! Oh i did not use the flour i used 2 tablesppon of cornstarch & it was just right.I served over hot cooked brown rice :) Thanks will make again!

I used much more ginger, (fresh, grated), doubled the soy sauce and added green onion cut into 1" pieces.  Was going to use additional veggies (red bell pepper, carrots, etc.) but decided to go with just the broccoli.  Was glad I did - this was tasty.

This is a clever recipe for mimicking authentic broccoli beef sauce, but many reviewers have complained that it is missing something or needs "tweeking."  My suggestion is to skip step 1 of the directions and the hassle of making sauce and use what the restaurants do: Oyster Sauce.  This sauce is available in the Asian section of the supermarket and at Chinese markets.

Only 3 stars as written.  Second time I made I reduced sugar to 1 teaspoon, used 3 cloves of garlic minced, added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and a can of straw mushrooms, drained.  That brought it up to a 5 star recipe.  The "sauce" of this recipe made it easy to make the changes to perfect.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe!!  We've also made it with chicken & chicken stock instead of beef + beef broth and have added some carrots for color and it's amazing! Love the ginger so much we tend to add extra. Next time we'll add some water chestnuts for extra crunch! Delicious. Absolutely amazing! Thanks!!

Four stars "as is," but better with a few alterations.  I found the sauce thickened instantly once I added it to my wok, which would have made the sauce evaporate before my meat and broccoli were fully cooked.  I added a few generous splashes of soy sauce to compensate - perfect consistency!  I also thought the ginger on its own was too overpowering.  Perhaps shredded or powdered would work better than thin pieces.  Overall, very quick and tasty with white rice!

This was good. The sugar was a little too much so I had to add more soy and more stock, plus red pepper, black pepper, garlic powerder, and salt. I served over rice cooked in soy sauce and the family really liked it.

I followed this recipe to the T and it was great.  My husband and I really liked it and will make it again.  However, I'm only give 4 stars because next time I will add half the sugar.  It was wayto sweet and I LOVE sweet.

This recipe is so yummy. I don't like steak and had some in my freezer so I thought this would be a good way to use it. I only made one change. I sliced the steak very thin and it turned out so tender. Steak to me is tough and this melted in your mouth.  My husband raved about it. I will definatly be making this again.

I gave this 5 stars because it's the best Broccoli Beef recipe I've found so far. The only thing I would say to watch out for is your beef broth, most of them come in a 14.5 oz can, so add extra flour accordingly, but a little goes a long way.   The ginger really adds flavor, and if you like it spicy, you could add in some cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes. Loved this recipe, will definitely make this a regular!

My whole family loved this recipe and it was so easy!  It's also a good opportunity to let kids help in the kitchen-- they can clean the broccoli and tear it up to cook.  If you're cooking for someone who doesn't love broccoli, just cook the beef and broc separately by dividing the sauce.

This was very tasty. I think maybe next time I will let the beef marinade in the mixture (minus the flour) prior to cooking since it didnt seem to take up much of the flavor. The broccoli was very flavorful though. I also added pasta ( I can't stay away from my starches ). Will cook again!  EDIT: I made this again and added some salt to the beef. I think that's what was missing the first time I made this. It was delicious! Now I give it 5 stars instead of 4

This recipe is superb!!!! I did modify it by adding 2 cups fresh mushrooms 1 tsp fresh ginger instead or what was asked and i added 2 green onions chopped up!!!! Then I browned the meat with the ginger onion and and garlic i find that it makes the meat taste even more scumptious!!!!!

I have four children 2-7 that gobbled this up.  2 of them have food allergies and this was so easy and free of any offending ingredients.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and doubled the broth and the garlic.  I'm not a big fan of ginger, so I literally sprinkled it like salt lightly over the top and stirred it in.  It was just enough for me!  Loved the recipe, and it was so simple which is a A+ at my house!

Added some thickly sliced mushrooms (so my kids could easily pick them out!) and about a quarter cup chopped onion. Was very generous with the ginger root and garlic as well! My 15 year old son's first words after he tried this were "Mmmmmm"!

I'm a beginner at cooking, and this recipe was so easy and pretty tasty. I did everything by the recipe except for the ginger, I'm a little scared of using ginger, since I always put too much and it completly ruins the meal. It still turned out pretty good.

I made this tonight and even though I made alot of changes, it still left me feeling 'unsatisfied'.  It really is lacking that 'something'.  I followed the basic recipe, but added 1 chopped onion, 1 sliced carrot, pea pods, mushrooms,3 tsp minced garlic and ground ginger since fresh was unavailable at my super. Kept the same amt of liquid and added more soy sauce.  I marinated the beef strips in egg white and soy sauce and lots of garlic, yet still it wasn't enough--and I really don't like 'hot and spicy' so even for my mild tastes this  lacks something.  It's pretty and has potential, so maybe I'll work on trying to perfect this one.  Red pepper flakes might help or oyster sauce.

This was pretty flavorless and tasted like it was missing something, though I couldn't quite pinpoint what exactly it was missing. In my opinion, this tasted better closer to room temperature than piping hot. However, it just wasn't satisfying. Also, round steak is a tough cut of meat to begin with. If you cook it well done, it's even tougher. Either the meat needs to cook on low for 8 hours in a slow cooker to tenderize it, or this recipe needs a more tender cut of meat (though, in my opinion, it's not a great enough recipe for the expense of a more tender cut.) Maybe some pieces of leftover pot roast would work better?

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars so I remember it's a definite remake.  As is, it's pretty bland, but when you triple the garlic and ginger and add a good deal of red pepper flakes- it's a smash.  My guests practically tried to lick the serving dish.  Don't cut back on the sugar at all.  Go half white, half brown.  I steamed the broccoli on the side and added two onions sliced.  Splendid!

Must make MANY adjustments. Use 1/4 cup all purpose flour, one 14.5 ounce can of beef broth, 1.5 tablespoons brown sugar, 5 tablespoons light soy sauce, 1 pound sliced skirt steak, 1/2 finely chopped onion, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 4 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/4 teaspon salt, 2 cups sliced mushrooms, 4 cups chopped broccoli. First, sautee the mushrooms and onions and remove from pan. Next, season the steaks with salt, garlic powder, and black pepper and cook both sides. Stir in broth mixture, ginger, salt, red pepper flakes, garlic, mushrooms, and broccoli.

I didn't have a lot of broccoli left, so I added 1/2 of an onion, 1/2 of a green pepper and 1 portobello mushroom ... this was fantastic!  We like things spicy so I put some crushed red pepper flakes in it at the end to give it some zip ... will definitely be making this again ... quick and easy, very tasty!

This was tasty and my boyfriend and brother both really enjoyed it. I did use more spice than was called for. I also had trouble getting the sauce to thicken up. Eventually I made a cornstarch slurry and stirred that in and it thickened up nicely. Tasty recipe, thanks.

Wow, this is better than all the takeout beef with broccoli I've had. I doubled the sauce and served it over rice. I used powered ginger because I didnt want to waste a full root. Sauted some onions with the broccoli, then added the sauce, then the sirloin which I par cooked so it wouldnt get over done. Not chewy at all! Delicious!

We like this a lot.  I used some rib-eye steak, beef base instead of broth, and after reading some other reviews I doubled the garlic and almost tripled the fresh ginger.  I also added some slices of onion with the broccoli.  Served over medium grain white rice.

This recipe was pretty tasty.  The only reason we are giving it 3 stars is that it seemed as though the meat could have used a bit longer to simmer in the sauce.  Next time I will double the sauce recipe and allow the meat to simmer a bit longer before adding the broccoli.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good.  It doesn't taste like it came from a Chinese restaurant, but I knew that going in.  I used double the ginger and added crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat.  I also removed the meat from the pan while I started the broccoli and sauce.  About 3-4 minutes before the broccoli was done, I added the meat back to the pan.  Excellent thickness in the sauce.  I served this with rice.  It was really tasty.  I will totally make this one regularly.

Fantastic!  Followed the posted recipe with modifications as suggested by Mike T (Aug. 27, 2006) in the comments.  Absolutely excellent -- flavorful, fulfilling, healthy -- meal will definitely be incorporated into weekly meal plan.

I followed the recipe and at the end added a little more soy sauce.  The in-laws gave it 5 stars so I must too. My mother-in-law cooks alot of recipes so this must have impressed her.  I think cutting back on the sugar (to 1 T) is wise however, I am told by her that most Chinese dishes add a little sugar (so keep some in).  Enjoy!

Besides the facts that I used chicken and the chicken seasoning packet from ramen noodles, cornstarch instead of flour (2Tbl) and didn't have fresh ginger, THIS MEAL TURNED OUT EXCELLENT.  The sauce was perfect.  I marinated the chicken all day, then saved the sauce to boil on the stove and use as 'extra' instead of adding soy sauce.  I also served it over cooked ramen noodles.  This was YUMMY!

This recipe is great!  My son says it is better than the one from the Chinese Restaurant.  I even use left over roast in this, if it is slightly rare- a great way to use up leftovers.

Too sweet and too much sauce.  Too little broccoli.  Flour makes the sauce look cloudy, try cornstarch instead, but not as much!

we really liked this.  (well, the 3 yr old didnt, but she hates things mixed together).  The first time i made it as is.  The meat was overcooked, and so was the broccoli.  This  time I tripled (at least) the ginger, doubled the garlic, added extra broth, and made the sauce separate from everything then mixed it at the end.  awesome.

This is the best recipe that I have tried for this dish. My husband and I loved it and best of all it has low calories. The flavor is very close to the restaurant taste. I just made a few changes. I added more minced garlic and 1/4 of an onion in big chunks while I cooked the meat at first. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was very quick, easy and delicious! I dissolved a boullion cube in 8 oz water & then added 4 more oz cold water before adding flour. I also added more spices: 4 TBSP soy, 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp ground ginger. I also used the brown sugar as suggested by another reviewer.

I like this recipe because it is easy and quick and I always have the ingredients on hand. I usually double the amount of ginger and garlic and make more of the sauce because I think its better a bit saucier. I also add a chopped onion and a few chopped carrots after I have browned the beef. It is a great recipe, thank you!

Mmmm... Good!  This recipe tastes like the beef broccoli that I get from the Chinese take-out in my neighborhood.  However, I varied it a little as others suggested.  I added more garlic, soy sauce and ginger, and some black pepper for a little more flavor.  And, it's so easy to make.

I made a second batch of this recipe and substituted the beef and beef broth with chicken.  Again, I added in the extras (more garlic, soy sauce, ginger and black pepper) for a little more flavor.  My family LOVED it!  This recipe is a definite "keeper".

This was wonderful! So quick and easy. What took me the longest was waiting on the rice. I took the advice from others and changed a few things. I doubled the soy sauce, used splenda instead of sugar, upped the ginger to about a 1/2 tablespoon, used about 1 1/2 tablespoons of garlic (I love garlic) and added about 2t of red pepper flakes (a little spicy like I like it!). Also, since I like my meat very tender, I browned it and then removed it from the wok so it didn't over cook. Also, I used flash frozen broccoli so I cooked that al dente in the microwave and only had to let it cook in the wok for about a minute or so. I then added the beef back and stirred n' served! I used skirt steak which, in my opinion, is tougher than round. If using skirt again I will probably marinate for an hour or so in some soy sauce, red pepper, garlic and ginger to give it some more flavor and tenderize it, especially since I didn't cook it in the sauce like the directions. All in all this is a wonderful recipe!

Doubled the sauce and served over rice.  Very good, but my sauce never thickened - added a tablespoon or so of cornstarch and that seemed to help a little.  Also, used frozen broccoli, thawed briefly in hot water.  Worked great.

I really liked this recipe but I thought it was a little too sweet so i think I would put less sugar in next time and maybe more garlic.  Really easy and pretty healthy dinner!

I LOVE this dish! This has become one of my favorites and I make it often.  I use a lot more garlic because I love garlic, and a little more ginger than it calls for. I also mix the soy sauce with teriyaki because the soy alone made it a little too salty. I like to double the recipe for the sauce so I have enough to mix in with rice. Yummm...

Really good.  I added a little red pepper flakes to heat up the flavor.  My sauce didn't thicken quite enough so I added a little more flour.  I probably should have waited because I think it was just my impatience as the sauce ended up being too thick.  Great recipe!  Thank you for the post!  I will definitely make this again!

This wasn't terrible, but I felt like the sauce was missing something.  We had to add a lot more soy sauce to make it taste better.  I Probably won't make this again.

This is very good - you just need to be careful not to overcook the beef during the browning.  I made this mistake the second time making this.  Otherwise, great recipe! Thanks.

I really liked this and so did my husband!  It tastes as good as restuarant broccoli beef and is super easy...I added more garlic, but that is it!

For the amount of time it takes to prepare, this recipe is fabulous.  My husband had FOUR helpings- the record previously held by my chicken pot pie was three helpings!

This was great I added onions and a lot of garlic because of the coments that it had no flavor made me add some wine.  But you know I really didn't have to it was great.

This recipe was only OK.  I took the idea of cooking my frozen broccoli first, and it made the broccoli "smushy" by the time the dish was ready.  I would suggest instead of cooking the broccoli, let the frozen broccoli sit in hot water, to defrost, not cook.  The gravy was also bland, and I could not really decide what kind of spices it needed, although the rest of my family thought it was pretty good, except for the "smushy" broccoli.  I'll try this recipe again, but ill try a little bit different.

I was not impressed.  I followed the recipe exactly, but marinated the beef like someone else had suggested - it still had very little flavor.  I think with the addition of some more spices, it could work. I would definitely reccomend removing the beef while cooking the vegetables or the beef will be very overcooked.  Thanks anyway!

This is so, so, so good!!  Next time I will preheat my frozen broccoli before I add it because the meat came out a little tough. I don't think it would have, at all, if I hadn't had to simmer it long enough to heat the broccoli.  This recipe is easy and delish.....you just can't beat that.

This recipe tasted much better than most Chinese restaurants make it! I used sesame oil to brown the beef and added a can of water chestnuts and red pepper flakes to the mixture (I like spicy). I also serve it with brown rice instead of white. Also, if you use frozen broccoli, heat in microwave first and then add to beef mixture. AWESOME!

The Broccoli Beef is very good!  I didn't have any fresh gingeroot so I used ground ginger instead. I also cooked the beef in about two tablespoons of canola oil. It turned out great!

This recipe was very good!  I gave it four out of five stars though 'cause I too thought it was missing a little something.  Next time I'll try adding some red pepper flake and/or more garlic to give it more "pop".  Also, the meat was very chewy; I may have over cooked it, but I followed the directions.  My husband loved it even though he does not like ginger and I was pleased.  It was VERY easy and quick to make.

This is exactly what it says: Quick, easy and very tasty. Due to a wheat allergy I used oat flour in place of the wheat flour and also added cornstarch to make a thicker sauce. You could not tell the difference. At the suggestion of another reviewer I added water chestnuts & chopped onion, and my husband thought that next time I should add some cashews (great idea). He wasn't that hungry but ate 2 helpings because he liked it so much! Served over basmati rice and it was a meal in itself! Very good.

This was one of the better broccoli beef recipes I've tried. I added garlic and onion powder as other reviewers suggested, I thought it needed some spice so next time I'll add some crushed red pepper flakes. I also doubled the sauce because I like enough to flavor the rice that I serve on the side.

This was a pretty good dish.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used ground ginger as opposed to fresh ginger as well as 14 oz. of beef broth.  We also added some red onion.  We served this over white rice & it was a very quick & satisfying dish.  Next time we're going to add shitake mushrooms & see how that tastes!!

This was very good, fast and easy.  My 8 year old son even helped me make this. I used the sirloin as suggested and put it in the freezer for about an hour before I cut it into thin slices.  The meat was very tender.  I also added more garlic and used ginger powder.  My husband asked me to hurry up and make it again.  This is going into my personal cook book for make again recipes.!

This recipe was quick and easy to make, but definately did not taste like an authentic Chinese dish which is what I was looking for.  But my kids (5 and 21 months) both liked it which was a plus.

So simply to make and so delicious!  I was afraid it might be bland so I added onions.  I used top sirloin which came out nice & tender.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  I'll try mushrooms next.

I thought this was very good --- easy, delicious and a one dish meal when served over steamed rice!  My friend and I both added mushrooms and it was quite tasty!

My daughter and I loved this! I don't have a lot of time to cook during the week and this was really quick and easy. Instead of rice, we used crunchy chow mein noodles. I'll definitely make this again!!!

This was a great recipe. I do not have much experience with cooking, but this recipe was so esay to make, and and it did taste just like Beef with Broccoli at a Chinese Restaurant. I was unable to find ginger root, but it tasted fine without.

Great dish, my family loved it.  I would serve it with white rice next time, as the flavored rice did not compliment it well at all.  This recipe is just wonderful and easy too!

I love this recipe!  It tastes just like restaurant food. Even my two year old ate it.  My only problem is what to do with all the leftover ginger root, I ended up having to throw most of it away a week later. I wonder if ground ginger would work just as well?  Great recipe, though.

My husband loved this but I found it very blah.  For rating this recipe in thee easiness catagory I'd take one point off because if you are like me you don't have fresh ginger root on hand on an everyday basis.  :)  Other than that is was quite simple to make.  My 3 yr old didn't care for it but he's a picky eater when it comes to textures of foods.

Wow, excellent recipe!  This is so quick to make and all ingredients are things I had on hand, no specialty items needed.  I just had the leftovers from this and they tasted even better.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed-it's quick and easy and yields excellent results.

Wow, great recipe.  Flavors are rich and balanced.  I used round steak and cooked the meat a bit longer before adding the other ingredients to make it a bit more tender.  Turned out great.  Loved the sauce.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.
It was not like a typical beef with broccoli Asian dish; probably because it called for flour instead of corn starch. It was like a tastelessness gravy with beef and broccoli. 
This has been the first Allrecipe that I have been displeased with.

I started my review but didn’t finish and I’m not sure whether I can edit it. It turned out great and I’ll definitely make it again. I did make some changes (as suggested by Mike T). Used approx. 2 cups beef stock, added 1/2 an onion, red pepper flakes and a dash of cayenne. Doubled the garlic and ginger and halved the sugar (used brown). Browned beef and removed it, cooked onion, ginger and garlic, added sauce and broccoli. Then added beef back in just before broccoli was done. Delicious!

My family really liked it. I wish I would have read the reviews beforehand. However, I did my own thing and it still was yummy. I used brown sugar instead of white. Added a little more garlic and 3 dashes of ginger. Definitely add more broth or else the sauce is too thick. But overall it was decent and it hit the spot.

We love this recipe and use it quite a bit.  I don't care for people saying "I loved it but changed these things" and change the whole recipe, but I did make minor changes...  And I mean MINOR...  I like a little more sauce so I double the ingredients outside of the broccoli and meat.  And I take all other ingredients, including the garlic and ginger, and put it all in the sauce and pour it in instead of putting that in the pan first.  Just one less step for me.  But other than that, it is a quick and easy, delicious recipe and the family loves it.

I added additional garlic and had to use some corn starch to thicken the sauce.  My family liked this served over rice.

I gave it 5 stars because my daughter ate 2 helpings and ask for it to be put in her lunch tomorrow.  I needed quick, easy, and reasonably healthy so i  use frozen portobello  mushroom, frozen (steak-um), frozen seasoning mix (onion and red peppers).  I used powdered ginger, and added 1/2 pkg of linguine (cooked).

Added a bit more seasoning -- but the big question was, if this is designed to be a low-cal entree, why have sugar in it? Use Swerve or stevia instead (at half the amount of sugar listed) and use caulirice instead of real rice.

I made the changes suggested by other reviewers; brown sugar instead of white, doubled the amount of ginger, and doubled the amount of beef broth. It was great! I will deffiinitely make it again but I think I would add a little more ginger next time.

I use cornstarch instead of flour in Chinese cooking. I also tossed the raw meat in cornstarch before cooking. I had to use some dried spices as substitutes because I didn’t have everything fresh, but even with that we liked it very much and will have again.

I used Turbinado raw sugar instead of white sugar.  I used whole wheat multi-purpose flour instead of  white flour.   And I did not have fresh ginger available so I used powdered ginger.   I also, added a small round 'artisan pasta' and salt and pepper and extra beef broth.   Came out great!

It was good, but the sauce was very thick and bland. It still filled the empty stomached, but plates were not cleaned. Perhaps next time I will leave out the thickeners and add brown sugar and hot peppers.

Very plain (bland) dish, nothing special, but easy for a quick meal with some additions, as other reviewers have said. For sure I agree with reviewer Jaylee - meat must be browned first alone, then vegetables lightly crisped, then sauce added last to simmer. In fact, to prevent soggy vegetables I kept them out until I felt the meat was simmered & soft, and added them last. This sauce is simply like regular gravy (unless you add a bit more spice by way of red pepper flakes, ginger, & sesame oil). Also used a tiny bit of cornstarch - flour simply makes muddy gravy. Overall a 3/5. Appreciate the experience though, of making it. Thanks.

Delicious.  I added bean sprouts to mine at the end of cooking because I had to use them up, and it made a nice addition.  I always use more than one clove of garlic when I cook - like maybe two or three cloves were used.  Cooked up some jasmine rice and it was really great.  Easy dinner, and anything vaguely Chinese is a win for my family.

The first time I made this recipe the way it was instructed it was good. 

Tonight I made it with almond flour and stevia since I am on a low carb diet and it was still really good!

While it was very tasty the meat was tough. The round steak was cut in thin strips was it was still too chewy. I will make it again but with a better cut of meat.

I added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and increased the amount of garlic to 4 cloves and it was still lacking flavor. Served with white rice. This was so bland, l will not be making this again.

Very simple and easy and so delicious. Didn't use a wok because we had to season and break it in before hand since it was brand new but as long as you use a big enough saucepan or a casserole pan it will come out great. Followed the recipe to a T. Fast recipe that could be whipped up in less than 30 mins.

I am very pleased with this court. I have been a hobby chef, cook and chef international for 40 years. Read comments, must say tastes different. I take spices, spice mixture for shortbread & sliced, self-prepared. Instead of broccoli also cauliflower very good.

This is second time I've made this recipe.  I loved it the first time, but it needed something extra.  This go around I made a marinade for the steak and let it set for 3 hours.  It's going to be a regular at the table, my kids love it...

It was good, easy and fast.  I would add onions to the beef the next time and garlic.  Maybe even sweet red pepper and mushrooms  and additional garlic for more flavor.  I liked it over noodles.

This is better than Chinese takeout! I used dry, tough leftover roast beef that I cut up into strips. I cooked it in the liquid mixture (minus the flour) for 2 hours then added the ginger and garlic. I added a flour slurry at the end to thicken. My family ate every last drop!

This was a quick and easy meal.  I added 1/2 large red pepper and 1/2 can chopped water chestnuts as well. Made some fried brown rice with it and steamed edaname. Great Friday night food at home.  
 It made too much for the two of us but was still good the next day for lunch

Delicious! Made it without the ginger root since I didn't have any on hand and doubled up on the garlic. We love garlic lol. And added some squash. It came out perfectly. I'll definitely be making this again.

Bland and not much flavor to this recipe. I lived in Asia for over seven years and this was not even close. I feel bad for wasting some beef and broccoli making this recipe.

I didn't care for the sweetness of it   The dish was definitely missing something. I believe I'll use more vegetables and less sugar next time. Over all not too bad.

WE loved it just as written. We like to do the recipes that way at least the first time and then tune it up per our particular compression ratio. Very tasty, easy and a good base for other items that could suit one's particular palate. I think it's important to cut the meat against the grain and thin. We didn't tenderize it (hammer) this time but might the next time. Round is a nice cut of meat for this dish. Meat and broccoli and tasty sauce really hit the mark for us; especially for us Atkins diet folks.

This is one of my boyfriend's favourite meals. It's quick, easy, healthy and delicious! We are garlic and ginger fans, so we ended up doubling those. Great over rice. We have already made this twice and will definitely be making it again!

Its easy and quick, good basic start and I used rump steak, as that's what was in the fridge. I made more sauce to flavour the rice but felt it needed more taste.

I followed the recipe, but next time would use corn starch instead of flour. Following  the recipe, as written using flour, gives the dish an unappetizing gray, muddy color.

The only change I made was to add garlic powder and some garlic chili paste which made it quite tasty. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was there was too much flour for my liking--just a little to thick. Next time I will make it with corn starch. Overall, a really tasty and easy recipe.

Because I had all of the ingredients, I decided to make this for din-din tonight! Quick & easy-peasy! I made 2X the recipe because my head of broccoli was a few days old, and defrosting the flat steak was way easy to fit the expanded amount. All I changed was adding a large can of cooked mushrooms. For the amount I made tonight with this recipe, I figured would've cost around $45 dollars from our FAV local Chinese restaurant!

I added green and red bell peppers to add a little color..plus I let it marinate a little more for extra flavor.. and I also added cashew nuts for a little crunch.. It was a Chinese meal along with some rice.

This is a great simple recipe that'll be a hit for anyone. Just made this for my boyfriend and our roommate and they love it. 

I suggest that you should cook the broccoli first and make it tender, some do not like crisp vegetables. A little extra soy sauce and garnish with toasted sesame seeds go a long way as well!

My husband and I make this all the time, it's one of our favorite dishes. I also add baby corn, carrots, and water chestnuts to it, though. I still haven't found the right crab rangoon recipe yet, so we aways buy ours from a local china III, Come on, who eats stir fry with out rangoons! hah!

Great dish which my friends enjoyed. Used a joint of silver-side instead of steak which i part roasted to medium rare then finely sliced. 
I am sure this will become a friends and family favourite.

I made this with the changes suggested by KC03 in their review and it came out great.  The meat was very tender because I cooked it with the sauce.  The broccoli was a little too soft because I had to wait for awhile till we were ready for dinner - but it still tasted good.

This recipe was fantastic! I have food allergies so it's hard for us to eat at Chinese restaurants, however, my husband loves Chinese food. This recipe was quick, easy and delicious! I only had London broil so I sliced that into strips and followed the recipe as written. I used brown sugar instead of white, a 14 oz can of beef broth (that's all I had), 2 small cloves of garlic and fresh ginger; served it over plain rice. My husband said it was the best Chinese food he has eaten outside of a restaurant. Even the kids loved it! Will definitely be making this again!

I gave this recipe two stars because it was edible.  However, this tasted nothing like any beef and broccoli I've eaten at a Chinese restaurant. The sauce didn't thicken at all and the only flavor that reached me was that of the beef broth. That was with adding extra garlic and ginger. I will keep my eyes peeled for a better recipe.

After reading the reviews,  I doubled the beef broth, and I don't think I would increase the liquid that much again.  I also fried an onion with the beef, which worked well.  I think next time I will also try brown sugar instead of white, and not use the full amount - it was a bit sweet for me.   But it had promise, and the whole family ate it without complaint (with 3 kids that is a rare feat!)  So next time: increase broth by 1/2;  use brown sugar; increase ginger, fry onion with beef, and hopefully have an amazing dish!

It was decent for a basic recipe, but it was bland to me. On a side note, I also have a very bad sense of smell, so food has to have a strong aroma for me to like it.

This was easy to make and absolutely delicious. Even my Very picky eaters asked for seconds on the sauce. I made it almost exactly as written with only difference being that I added salt and pepper to the steak strips when I was cooking them. I served with Basmati rice. I can't wait to make it again.

My family loves beef and broccoli so I was on the search for a good recipe.  There are a lot of recipes out there with all kinds of fancy ingredients, so I thought I would give this one a try.  It is AMAZING!  It truly is restaurant quality with very few ingredients and it is quick to make, a big plus!

I made this delicious recipe and my family loved it! I did take some suggestions from other reviews. I added apple cider vinegar, sesame oil, garlic salt to give it some more flavor. Also you must brown the meat before you add the ingredients!

It was OK, there was not much flavor.  I added one small sliced onion and cooked it with the beef.  I used 2 tbsp. flour and 14.5 oz can of beef broth.  I subbed 1 packet of Splenda instead of the sugar  and 1/2 tsp. ground ginger.  I also added 1/2 tsp. crushed hot pepper flakes.  It definitely needed something.

Great outline, had to add a little more of everything because I used more broccoli and also added baby corn and onion.I also used a lite soy sauce and felt like it didn't loose any flavor.  I really enjoyed the fresh ginger, you just have to know your spice tolerance and adjust, I did use the amount suggested though and found it wasn't horribly spicy. (I did add more veggies though) It was under $2 a serving, and super easy and quick to cook. it was great, healthy , easy, and filling recipe for busy, tired people. Can't wait for leftovers.

This was a great recipe but yes needed some tweaking. Thanks to Mike T's helpful review that pretty much summed up all the suggestions and put it into one. So yes, we added some more garlic, ginger and I seasoned the beef as I cooked it as well. Also added some Chili paste and it was delicious. I did have to add water to the sauce as yes, it did become like a puddle of mud as he said haha. Good recipe. Will definitely do it again.

We doubled everything, add a finely sliced onion, cut asparagus in 2 inch pieces. Stir fried the onion and fresh ginger first. Took them out. Stir fried  the meat with the minced garlic for two minutes. Then added everything together. Added a heaping teaspoon of jarred minced ginger at this point , because we love ginger. Let simmer 2-3 minutes.  It was delicious. Served it over rice. Restaurant quality for sure.

Put in honey instead of white sugar. 1 cup low sodium beef bouillon instead of beef broth and added juice from half an orange, 1/2 chopped onion and sprinkle of red pepper flakes.
It was pretty good that way. But some people in my household don't like broccoli. More for me!

Delicious! Even my picky eating husband liked it!
I actually doubled the recipe and added fresh baby Bella mushrooms when I added the broccoli. 
Next time I would add a bit more soy sauce and or a pinch or two of salt.

I have a very picky husband but when I saw this recipe I thought he might like it....and he DID!!!!  He said he wouldn't want it often but I could fix it again and that in itself is saying a lot.  I found the recipe to be easy to fix.  I did not use fresh broccoli instead I used fresh frozen and thought it was good...it just wasn't as crispy as it would have been with fresh but it was still good.

Loved this recipe. Had only a half bag of frozen broccoli on hand so also added a small halved and sliced onion and a can of mushrooms. Also per others suggestions reduced the sugar a bit and doubled the amount of broth.  Served with noodles the first night and served the leftovers over mashed potatoes the next. Even my very picky husband loved it both times!

It was bland IMHO.  Next time will use more spice, a better cut of meat and never flour...cornstarch is what Asian recipes use. For the people who did say they had no fresh ginger, I have a tip. Buy a good chunk, wash and peel if you like [I don't bother and freeze well wrapped.]  When you need some, simply grate ginger  and use however much you like.  Can add more of this Ginger ''snow'' as you go along in the cooking as needed for your own preference.

I have another beef and broccoli recipe that I like better, but this was very good while being quick and easy to prepare. I added rice noodles to it.

So, I made this today...and it was so easy and good!!  I did have to alter the recipe a bit. I added onions to the broccoli mixture. I did not have ginger, so I substituted a ginger/teriyaki dressing into the mixture as well. My boyfriend told me that it was so good, he could 'drink the sauce'... It was definitely a hit with my family, and I will be making it again for sure!

Really good and quick.  Once you get the timing down, could be made in a lot less time.  We decided to use Top Sirloin because that's how we roll.  Was amazing, the meat just melted in your mouth with a slight ginger flavor.  Everyone loved it, adding this to the usual planner :)

Delicious. I always add white onion. I also add more broth because we like things more saucy. We love this dish and make it fairly often.

Tasty recipe! Tired of spending money when I can make in the comfort of my own home. I normally make recipes as directed the first time then add my own touch later. The common denominator from other reviews stated that it was a little bland so I increased a few ingredients and added onions. Definitely need more broth as it thickens when cooking. Added one more tablespoon of sugar and 3x the amount of garlic. Used ginger powder instead of fresh. Will add Tinley chopped carrots next time. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Surprisingly good for having an average of four stars rating. Although I did make a couple changes to the recipe such as replacing white sugar with brown and flour with corn starch. Thanks for the submission, my family and I enjoyed it :)

This wasn't all that great and really lacked flavor, enough though I added red pepper flakes, oniions, more ginger and more garlic. I won't be making this again.

I made this twice. Once as is and the second time with the following adjustments. I seared the meat in sesame oil and then removed the meat and then sautéed on med-high a small julienne sliced onion along with the broccoli until crisp tender. Added back in the beef along with the sauce mix. Then proceeded with recipe. For the sauce I omitted the flour and added 2 or 3 teaspoons of cornstarch and substituted brown sugar instead of white sugar. Brown sugar adds to the savory favors of the meat. I probably added more garlic but I typically add more garlic then the recipe suggests.

Good Stuff! I just wish I had a hotter stovetop to brown the meat. I substituted the sugar with honey. At the end I added sliced almonds. This is a repeatable recipe. Now to master fluffy rice. Seems I have sticky rice down.

Wonderful! I used venison rather than beef, and frozen broccoli. Like others mentioned, I upped the garlic and used dried ginger, about a half a teaspoon. To cut way back on carbs, rather than flour, I mixed the other ingredients for the sauce, let it reduce, then thickened with a half teaspoon of guar gum whisked in before removing from heat and serving. Will make this one again. Thanks for sharing.

Quick and easy, GREAT taste.  I added red and yellow onions, green beans, celery and cabbage, and a liberal dash of Dale's steak seasoning and cranberry juice instead of stock.  A bay leaf, some barley, 4 ozs of pork, three corn cracked pepper, all chased with fresh Italian bread to dip in the juices, cole slaw (hand made with half ranch dressing and mayo), and rotini noodles- Barilla, of course, radishes and green onions with salt for an appetizer, and a chilled Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio, followed by Greek coffee with a light cream.  WOW!  Wish I'd had green peppers, though.. :(

Pretty good. I didn't have some of the ingredients that other recipes called for, like oyster sauce, but I had everything for this. I doubled the ginger and garlic, personal preference, and added a bit of sesamie oil while sauteing the steak. I used cheap London broil I had in the freezer that was thin sliced for jerky. Wasn't tough at all. And I used frozen broccoli. I was able to whip this up in less than ten min. You could tinker around with seasonings on this because it's rather light on them. But I needed quick and easy tonight. OH and I only used half the flour, subbing whole wheat.

Great recipe as is, but I think I will add some red pepper flakes next time for my own taste.  Also had to add a little extra beef broth while cooking because the sauce thickened up too quickly.  Excellent served over rice.

The sauce and broccoli were good, but the meat cooked tough and chewy. I don't know if it was user error or the recipe, as I've never accidentally done that before? Anyway not that great, probably won't make again.

Everyone seemed to like it, but they said something was missing. I may sprinkle a little crushed pepper to spice it up next time. I doubled all ingredients except for the sugar, I used 1/2 tsp. of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger and in addition to the minced garlic, I sprinkled some garlic powder in too. Thanks to Mike T for his recommendations.

I looked up several of this recipe on this site and others; this was the best basic recipe. Mike T's review I followed many of his suggestions. I also used about 2 T oyster sauce, some sesame oil and corn starch instead of flour, stevia extract instead of sugar. I marinated the cut beef strips in sauce a few minutes took beef out with slotted spoon, cooked a few minutes, and then took beef out of pan. Sauce in the pan I added remaining marinade, then added corn starch, cooked and stirred till it was gravy/sauce consistency. Cut onion slices added to broccoli. Returned beef to gravy/sauce, then broccoli and onions, cooked a few minutes so vegetables were heated but still a little crisp, served on rice. Turned out great.

This was fine, but lacked something.  I used dried ginger, so maybe that was why.  It kind of tasted like just a beef gravy...  Next time I will try adding the cayenne others suggested.

Very bland, even though I added more garlic, ginger, onions, pepper flakes and black pepper.  I used cornstarch instead of flour and won't do that again. The cornstarch breaks down when you 'simmer' too long and the sauce gets too runny.

This was delicious and SO quick and easy.  Like others, I used powdered ginger - and it worked perfectly.  I used the round steak, but sliced it very thin (kept it from getting tough).  Used frozen (thawed) broccoli.  On the table in 30 minutes.  Hubby loved it too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is so good my entire family loved it. I read reviews and was concerned because some people mentioned that it was a little bland. I did double the ginger. I used fresh ginger, and fresh garlic. I added the garlic and ginger while cooking the meat so it could retain the flavor. I also added a small amount of pepper to the meat for flavoring. It was so yummy and flavorful.

This is a wonderful recipe! I tried to make it with chicken (to be a bit healthier) and low sodium chicken broth and it wasnt nearly as good. Any suggestions on how to make a chicken version a bit better?

It seems a little strong, and also seems like it's missing something, but at the same time, I make it about every other time I make Chinese, and it's still in my recipe box, so it's a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This is good but, I felt like it was missing something. The beef needed seasoning or something. The sauce tasted good with the broccoli. The only thing I did different was add seasame oil to the sauce.

I made this tonight, following the directions as is. The whole family (including our "picky eaters") really loved it. We all agreed, however, that there was definitely too much sugar. Will definitely make this on a regular basis, but I will cut the sugar by about half.

Quick....easy and perfect for the working person to tackle at the end of a day.  The ingredients are basic too so you don't need specialty things to make this like oyster sauce - sherry...etc.  

DOUBLE THE SAUCE ingredients or there's just not enough to soak the rice or noodles.

I upped the garlic and ginger too but we like things zippy!  Also I used Sesame oil to brown the beef.  Very tasty!

also great with chicken! you can microwave frozen broccoli and use that instead of fresh to make it a bit quicker, but you need to thicken the sauce some before you add the broccoli - it will get mushy if you cook it the 10 minutes in the sauce.

YUMMY! I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out delicious. The only thing I did different was that I added extra fresh ground Ginger to the beef marinade. I think it gives it more depth of flavor. Overall a great recipe

This was amazing!  Powder ginger works just fine, frozen thawed broccoli worked just fine, and I sauteed the beef in a touch of sesame oil...really gave it that Asian food flare.  Serve over hot plain noodles and voila!  My 12 year old daughter LOVED it, highly recommended.  :)

Taste really, really good!  I was a little nervous about how it would turn out, but it turned out great!!!!  I added my own seasonings to the recipe though to give it some more flavor.  I cut up green onions and added black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder... PERFECT!

i used mike t's recipe based on the reviews and it turned out great. very tasty but the sauce was a lil thin. no problem cause you can just use a slotted spoon and pull the tender meat and crisp but tender broccoli out. 5 stars for mike t

This was great.  I made no modifications, but I can't give it a 5 because I don't think it had an authentic taste.

I used shaved beef which worked great. First, I used a combo of sesame and chili oil and browned some sesame seeds (my kids love them) as well as a jalapeno and a red chili (cut in half so I could remove them later) and garlic. Then I browned the meat and added the sauce. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powder to taste. Also, I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 splenda instead of white sugar. Finally, I added a splash of orange juice. The heat from the peppers was perfect. I still have a mild tingling on my tongue. Oh, yeah I added more broth so I had more juice to put over my very sticky rice... I suck at cooking rice! I would definitely eat this again.

This was pretty good. :)  I had to use 24 oz. of beef broth because it kept getting too dry and starting to burn. I also had to cook it for almost 40 min to get the broccoli wasn't getting soft enough for my kids to be able to eat.

Really great recipe!! I read through the other reviews and made the appropriate tweaks like others said too. Just be careful on how much garlic you use...I used 2TB, and it had a very garlicky taste, which I dont mind, but even for me it was a little strong. I also added red pepper flakes for a little zing. I didnt use round steak like it called for, I just bought stew meat, so it was already cut up. Cooked some white rice to have as a nice base, and cut up some green onions to scatter on top. Really good and simple recipe!

This was pretty good.  I doubled the "stock" as it is written because after adding the amount called for it was clearly not enough.  It turned out more like a gravy in my opinion and was a bit blah.  I think next time I'll add a bit less flour and add another clove of garlic or some garlic powder and a bit more soy sauce.  The amount of ginger was right on in my opinion, as well as the sugar - although I might opt for brown sugar next time after reading some other reviews.  I did love the fact that it was so super easy and quick to make.  Would give it 4 and a 1/2 stars if I could...  :)

It wasn't very good. The sauce was like gravy and it was nothing like broccoli beef. I would rather have had it on mashed potatoes than rice.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I followed other user suggestions, and used 1/2 tsp. ground ginger (because we didn't have any whole fresh ginger on hand), and sprinkled with red pepper flakes, and it was DELICIOUS! I've already added this recipe to my recipe box.

I followed the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and increased the liquid.  This made the sauce perfect.  This was a delicious replica of the chinese restaurant Beef and Broccoli that my family loves.  I also tried it with chicken and it was just as great. The is a super easy recipe with great results.  Will make this again and again.

We LOVE  this recipe!  Sometimes I'll subsititue 2 chicken breast for the round steak and I usually use a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and add fresh or frozen extra broccoli to it.  I make some fried rice and we're set!  Delicious!

Great recipe! I will make this one again.  I felt the sauce needed some kick, so I added some heat and additional flavor. I added the following to the sauce mixture: oyster sauce, fish sauce, red pepper flakes, chili oil, rice vinegar, chinese five spice, sesane seeds, and sirachi and hoisin sauces. I did not add sugar, but used honey instead.  I also added mushrooms and water chestnuts.  I used flank steak and marinated in a honey teriyaki marinade (store bought- did not feel like making homemad). I felt the sauce was too watery, but that was probably due to the marinade, so next time I will make less sauce.  In order to ensure the flour/sauce mixture was blended well I took a small amout of the sauce mixture in a separate bowl and added the flour to that mixture, then I added the mixture to the larger bowl. Overall, great recipe, and would have been 5 stars had the flavor been more flavorful.

While this came together quickly, I felt as though it was pretty bland. I did add a sliced onion and I think if I tinkered with the seasonings a bit more it would be much better.

My 19 year old son said this was the 'bomb'.  I thought it was pasty and and lacked flavor (too much flour and not enough flavor).  I watched the History Channel  and they had a program "Chinese Takeout.  They said Broccoli Beef should have Oyster sauce (they showed how it was made).  I did an internet search and found several recipes for it but I wanted to use Allrecipes.com because I prefer the format and how users rate the recipes.  I found Resturant Style Beef and Broccoli recipe here. Much better.  Don't make this recipe; make Resturant Style Beef and Broccoli, it is SO MUCH BETTER and really not  more work. Nineteen year old liked it better also.

Pretty good...and makes a thick sauce. I had read the reviews prior to making and added some things in...and some things I thought would be good too to taste.  Sauted beef in skillet with sesame oil mixed with olive oil.  Added extra broth, fish sauce, oyster sauce, extra soy sauce, red pepper flakes, sirachi. Only put in about 2 tsp of sugar.  I had the fish and oyster sauce in my pantry and thought it needed more asian flavor as the sauce seemed very generic tasting as I was making it. I did not add too much spice as I relied for the spice to come from the ginger root.

wasn't impressed with this;  it was pretty bland and the sauce had the consistency and taste of gravy, not a typical "chinese take-out" taste.  probably needed more soy sauce and sriracha (red chili sauce)

Doubled the sauce as other reviewers did.  This reminded me of the way my mom made stir fry in the 80s.  Great for an easy dinner.  5 stars for nostalgia :)

Ver easy!  Pretty good for a home version.  I used ground ginger, and frozen broccoli.  I did use more beef broth like others advised, the sauce was still very thick, so that was good advice!

I just tried this recipe tonight, implementing some of the changes suggested in the reviews (more ginger, double garlic, more broth), and substituted the beef and broccoli with chicken and green beans.  It was de-LISH!  The hubby went back for seconds...and thirds. :)

I thought this was excellent.  It was very quick to make, the taste was great!  I made the sauce as described but doubled it, as we like lots of sauce.  This will be a regular in my household.

Tastes just like it came from take out!  I've made it twice and everyone in my house loves this recipe.  I add some pepper flakes for those in the family that like some spice, and serve over jasmine rice.

I thought the flavor was great. I cooked for 8 and so I used the calculator to figure out the servings, then read the reviews. I doubled the spices which worked out great and added some crushed red pepper, but the extra broth that was recommended in a comment was to much and it came out soupy. Good reviews from the house though!!

Edible, but not great.  It's pretty quick to put together.  I added in a can of Chinese mixed vegetables and some grated carrot for color.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I made a few minor changes:  I cut the meat and marinated it in teriyaki sauce for about 2 hours prior to cooking, I also sauteed sliced mushrooms and added them, the only other thing I did was add some teriyaki sauce as it was all cooking together.  I loved that the broccoli held up so well but was cooked enough to not have the raw crunch to it.  I'll for sure be making this again!

A simple stir fry recipe that tastes great.  I add a little black pepper and a sliced onion when stir frying the beef, double the ginger (powder) and garlic,  and usually reduce the sugar by about 1/3.  I've been making this for over two years because it is quick and good.

I thought this was excellent.  I pretty much made it as written, except I did add a bit more ginger and some garlic powder.  I didn't think it was bland at all. Because I used a tough cut of beef, I marinated it in soy sauce and garlic for about 2 hours (after slicing it), so maybe that helped to give it more flavor than some have said it has.  I also added some carrots, mushrooms, and onions, but it would have been fine with just the beef and broccoli.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I did make some alterations based on other people's reviews. I used a 14oz can of beef broth and added extra ginger and garlic. I also cooked the meat with onions and a splash of teriyaki! Overall very good and I will definitely use this recipe again!

I bought a big box of beef broth (32 oz)and used 2/3 of it, and for the flour, I only added 1/8 cup of flour. I also marinated my beef for an hour, in 2 T of: rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, soy sauce & worcestire sauce. Also, to the sauce I added 1 t of hoisin sauce. I am not very big on ginger flavor so I only used a piece about the size of 1/2 a cranberry. Boy, did this taste good!

This was ok, I doubled the spices as someone suggested & added some red pepper flakes & I thought it still needed a little more flavor. I served it over white rice & it was not bad but not as good as I expected it to be. If I make this again I'm going to have to mess with the spices a bit more to change the flavor a bit.

This was so good. I didn't use as much flour because I read previous reviews about the sauce being too thick and it turned out great. I did add a little hoison sauce ( I think that's spelled right) to the sauce mixture and 4 tablespoons soy sauce. I topped with green onions and served over instant white rice... very good close to the chinese place down the street but still missing something.

OK but not special.  I think it may be better without the sugar.

Even though I tripled the garlic & ginger and added fresh mushrooms & green onion...this dish still fell short in the flavor department. It was simply OK.

I recommend putting the broccoli in after the sauce thickens so that it cooks no more that 5 minutes or the broccoli gets a little overcooked.  Mine got a little too soggy for my taste.  I like a little crunch.

I would even give it more stars if I could. I try a new recipe from this site at least once per week. This is the first time I have commented. This was incredible! I took the advice of others and added some red pepper, more broth as well as red and green peppers and onion. My husband and I both agree this was better than anything we have eaten in a restaurant! After each new recipe we decide if it is one to keep or to throw away. This is absolutely a keeper. He wanted to know if we could have it weekly! Go try this! It is quick and easy and oh so delicious!

This dish was EXCELLENT! I added extra broccoli, and a bit more ginger than the recipe calls for. I've never used fresh ginger root before, so it was interesting to see how it changed the flavour. Leftovers are even better cold!! Will definitely be making this again.

I've made this both with a bag of frozen broccoli florets and with chopped up fresh broccoli and they both work out great depending on what you're aiming for.  Using frozen broccoli helps make this dish ready quick.  Using fresh I personally believe lends to better flavor as the fresh broccoli cools slower than frozen and ads its own essence to the dish!

I have a friend who gives me a lot of broccoli he's grown organically. This was a great way of using some of it up. Instead of the sugar I used 1T of honey and I had no fresh ginger to hand so used jarred chopped ginger. My husband loved this served with noodles. Thanks Sal.

This was pretty good and satisfied our craving for chinese without being uber expensive. I doubled the sauce and the amount of broccoli since I am a HUGE BROCCOLI LOVER. We put it over noodles and it got gobbled up rather quickly. I would still like to know how to tweak it to taste more like the kind you get at the restaurant. I guess I am giving this 4 stars because that is what I expected- restaurant style. But this is still good none the less.

This was ok, not quite like in the restaurant, I would defiantly steam the broccoli and add it at the end of cooking, the sauce was missing something, but hey it was less expensive to make at home than take-out!

I used this recipe for venison and it turned out very tender and juicy.  I didn't have any ginger on hand so I simply omitted it and it was still delicious.  My family ate it all.  Now I am anxious to get ginger and try it with the ginger.

This is some awesome food! I followed other reviewers opinions and doubled the broth and spices... I ended up with way too much thin liquid. I used cornstarch and had to double the amount to get the sauce to thicken up. No worries though because the sauce was so good we almost ate it all anyway. Next time, because there will def be a next time, I will follow receipe and just add a dash more ginger, garlic, and soy to get my prefered flavor. Thanks a ton for this one!!

Awesome recipe! Easy to make and comes out perfect everytime!

(update 2/3/10) I just made this again last night. Didn't have broccoli so used brussel sprouts and carrots that I had on hand. It came out perfect. Followed recipe exactly and is perfect. Good over white rice. Kids will love it, my 5-year-old does!

I had my doubts about the recipe however it turned out great my co-workers raved that it tasted like it came from a Chinese resturant.  I followed the recipe exactly but did add red pepper flakes and cilantro flakes for some kick.    Some reviews omitted the ginger root however, I thought it was good in the recipe.

Very good flavor, but the dish didn't look appealing.  The sauce - which I thought should have been more like a glaze - turned out to be a thick brown gravy.  The dish looked like beef stroganoff.  But again, the flavor was excellent.  Maybe next time I'll experiment with corn starch instead of flour.

This was better than my local Chinese take-out place as is! I'll make a few adjustments next time (add onions, more broth, etc..) to suit me but it's a great base recipe to build on.  Thank you for sharing!

This was good.  I added a few red pepper slices for some color and little extra flavor.  I would probably add a little more or maybe add some more ginger...I am not sure what it was lacking, but it seemed to miss something.  Overall, however, this was very good and I won't be buying at a chinese restaurant again!

i am so impressed!! i'm eating this right now, and it really does taste like takeout. i must admit, i was afraid that it wouldn't turn out because i used 2 beef bullion cubes (boiled in 15 oz water). but the extra dashes of garlic and ginger powder definitely make this meal and it wasn't too salty. thanks for a great, easy recipe!

Little to sweet I ended up making it twice and cutting the sugar in half. I also made twice the amount of sauce..

Added extra soy sauce, garlic and a little chile sauce for zest.  some thick cut onions didn't hurt either.  Yummy.

I thought this recipe was decent.  It was edible, but I won't be making this again.  It was lacked flavor even with doubling the garlic, ginger, and sauce (even adding red pepper flakes).

This recipe was great. My husband and I like it better than the same dish from the chinese restaurants. Like others I doubled the broth. I also added fresh sliced mushrooms to the broccoli and some chili powder, black pepper and more garlic. Will be making again and again. Thanks!!!

I liked the concept of this dish, but it just fell short on the flavor. I wanted that traditional zing that Asian food provides and unfortunately this was a little bland.

I tried this recipe for the first time today. I love Chinese food. I did double the garlic and ginger in this recipe. Add 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes. Also, added onion. As mentioned in the reviews privous to my attempt in making this. 

Still is missing something though, will try brown sugar instead of white sugar next time and add some kosher salt and black pepper.

It was quick and easy and a dish I will make again in the future.

Great recipe... very authentic tasting.  I made the following changes:  I marinated the beef overnight with some soy sayce, red pepper flakes (gave it a little punch), olive oil, ginger and garlic.  When cooking the beef I also added an onion like many of the other reviewers and also used frozen broccoli without compromising the results.  The beef turned out very tender and the sauce was the same as we get from our local chinese food restaurant.

This is dish is AMAZING!! My family doesnt even like broccoli and they really enjoyed it. I took a few tips and chopped the ginger in bigger sizes so that I could pull it out once finished. I added chopped onions and a little bit of Chopped cilantro towards the end. The flavor was delicious. I actually mixed the meat in the broth, flour, sugar and soy sauce prior to frying (by accident) and it turned out awesome....better than any take out for sure!! I think next time I will add a few red pepper flakes like another reviewer suggested. Thanks for this great recipe!

I had to add some more liquid...too much like a thick gravy for our tastes.  Once it was thinned out, it was really good.  I also added some crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up a little.

I made this for dinner tonight and got an average rating from my husband. I have to agree that following the recipe verbatum makes it a bit bland. But I give props to the submitter because it looks like the best recipe on the site for Beef & Broc. I will make it again and I will follow the recommendations. My advice is: If you make this recipe, use the suggestions made by others, otherwise, you probably won't be happy.

If I made this recipe as-is, I think it would have tasted terrible. However, I took the suggestions of other posters and it tasted pretty good. I like how the recipe is very simple; not too many ingredients are needed and the ingredients are usually stuff I have in the kitchen anyway. I used 16oz of beef broth, 5 cloves of garlic, 3x the amount of fresh garlic, seasoned the beef w/ salt and pepper, and added more soy sauce. I also added French cut green beans along with the broccoli and it went well with the dish.

Used recipe as is, except for I only had ground ginger.  Had enough sauce, almost too much.  It is missing something as far as flavor, that's why I only gave it 4 stars.  May add red pepper flakes or something else to spice it up a little.  But a very easy and quick recipe!

This recipe is great for a easy and quick family meal.  My family enjoyed it.  We did follow the directions from previous reviewers and doubled the seasoning and broth, although, I think next time we'll only times the broth by 1 1/2 instead.  My wife cut the meat into cubes, but after eating it I would have preferred strips. Great quick dinner, highly recommend it.

My family and I thought this was really good. Simple, fast and delicious!!! What more can you ask for! I did add more ginger than called for and I used brown sugar instead of white but other than that I stuck to the recipe.

Eh it was good...not mind blowing or anything. I enjoy beef and broccoli better from my local chinese restaurant. I might make again...just a different recipe. I also added some Hoisin sauce...maybe that was my mistake? i dont know. Was okay.

A very good recipe.  Quick and easy to make, but I felt it needed a little something more. Next time I will try adding more spices and veggies.  My husband LOVED it, and it will be used frequently for a quick meal. :)

This dish started out pretty bland and I had to add to much to make the flavor improve. I'd look for another recipe before making this again. sorry

Hah, too funny!  I didn't have any beef broth, so I used beef barley soup and just strained out the vegies and barley -and it worked fine!  I followed other suggestions of doubling the broth, adding corn starch instead of flour, using more garlic and ginger (on both, much more than two times), and more soy sauce and added red pepper chili flakes.  It might have been because I was using the beef soup, but I really used lots of the garlic and chili flakes.  As others suggested, I cooked sliced onion with the beef, and took it out of the pan to go with the next step of broccoli and broth, then adding the beef back.  With the changes, it was awesome!

I like this recipe okay, but even though I used slightly more garlic and ginger than directed and added salt and pepper to the meat, it came out bland. Sadly, my family aren't as gung-ho about Chinese food as I am and no one other than me liked it enough for me to try and perfect it. I won't be making this again.

This is a five star if you add 1/2 tsp of red pepper.  It needed a little kick to it.  My husband added a little extra red pepper to his plate.  My picky four year old asked if I could make it again.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

Really Good! Kids loved it and so did I. Doubled the sauce and used cornstartch like the other reviews. I will use a more tender beef next time as the round steak was really chewy. The five stars is for the sauce, it actually taste better then most I had in restaurants.

I did this recipe last night and as suggested by other reviewers I doubled up on the garlic and ginger. I also added white sliced onions and red chili peppers (chile de arbol) it gave it an extra spice. Served over rice. I will do this recipe again for sure. My husband and I really liked it.

This was excellent broccoli beef!  Though I did make several changes to spice it up.  I used way more ginger and garlic because we LOVE it here.  I added onion and an extra beef boullion cube.  We served it with rice and I will add water chestnuts next time.

A fast and tasty recipe - after reading the reviews, I doubled the garlic and tripled the ginger. I added an onion (sliced) to the beef and cooked a few minutes before putting the other ingredients in the wok. I couldn't believe I was out of soy sauce and worchestershire sauce (which another reviewer suggested as a substitute) so I used teriyaki sauce - which gave the recipe a flavour my husband raved about. Go figure.

I used the general idea for this- Instead of making a sauce I used a bottle of Teryaki Ginger marinade and a few extra veggies. I served it over rice and my whole family adored it! I'll be making this again for sure!

Tasty, healthy, not a lot of dishes/pots/pans to wash from the preparation, and incredibly easy.

I sprinkled sesame seeds over the whole thing before bringing it out.  It looked nice.

Thought this was pretty good, my steak didn't get tender enough but I think it was my fault for them not being slice thin enough!  I did double the gravy part and it was a good consistancy, but I too used frozen broccoli.  I'll make this one again but next time instead of white rice I'll used Fried Rice!!  Thanks!

This turned out pretty well.  I made with "meal starters" vegetarian steak strips which are already cooked so you just have to heat them.  Next time I will pay more attention to the broccoli cause I overcooked it a little bit.  Followed others' advice and added more garlic and ginger - I thought this was very good for how quickly it came together.

Good enough to make again, but not stellar. I didn't have trouble with the sauce thickness as I used frozen broccoli (as in frozen into a solid block of ice). Also, next time I think I will marinate the meat in the sauce (minus the flour) for deeper flavor, and leave out the sugar.

This was pretty good overall.  I gave it four stars instead of five because I would have left out the sugar.  It just didn't need it.  Also, like other reviewers said, you might want to add more broth or water, otherwise it's too thick.  I will make this again, and next time I think I'll add mushrooms and onion.

This was delicious!  The sauce was very mild and of great consistency.  I added carrots and used powdered ginger in the sauce.  Looked great on the plate as well.

This was very good. I made it for family dinner and everyone just loved it. I did add some more soy sauce like other suggested. I also added some season pepper and garlic pepper to the meat while it was cooking. It was great I will make it again

I agree with another reviewer who suggested doubling up on the broth other wise you get mud.  It needed a little bit more flavor also, but liked the fact it wasn't salty like take out Chinese food.

I made this as the recipe instructs and it was a little bland. Not too bad, though. Perhaps a bit more ginger or some chili powder for a kick would be good. I used stew meat instead of steak. I'll make this again; my kids liked it.

I'm not real happy with this one. This recipe lacked flavor, needed to at least double the soy sauce. My mother in law who won't normally eat Chinese food like it because it was much less salty than what you would find at a restaurant, so she thanks you for the recipe.

No leftovers here.  I let the beef set for about 30 minutes (not really marinate) in a little soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, sugar, and a bit of salt and pepper. Serve this with white rice and the Sesame Noodles recipe on this website.

Quick, easy, delicious. Loved this one. The only change I made was to use half a bouillon cube and a cup of water in place of the beef broth.

This came out great, just like the broccoli beef that is served in chinese restaurants.  On the suggestion of a few other reviews we doubled both the garlic and the ginger root, and played around with the seasonings.  Once we got it seasoned right it was GREAT!  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

This was easy and quick and so yummy! My whole family loved it and it took no time to make. I found the beef already sliced and used a bag of broccoli florets to speed things along. It was ready in 20 minutes! Thanks for a great recipe!

Flavor was good, but I did have to add spices.  As noted by other reviewers, I doubled the ginger and used 3 cloves garlic.  Used 4 TBSP soy sauce, and added onions too.  I highly recommend adding a half tsp. of red pepper flakes, the recipe is way too bland without the extra spices and the red pepper.

I LOVE how quick and easy this recipe is. My family likes it flavorful so I double (or triple) the ginger and garlic. I also marinate the beef in the sauce before I cook it and cook the beef in the sauce the entire time. It is delicious!

This was really good!  Easy, quick and tasty.  I did take the advice of some of the others by adding more soy sauce (3 TBS) and a little more ginger.  I thought there was sufficient broccoli. I also used flank steak because that is all I had. I would definately make this again!

I like this because it's so quick and easy. I make it a little more flavorful by doubling the garlic and ginger (or maybe even a little bit more), adding a sliced carrot and pinch of red pepper flakes. Because the gravy turns out fairly thick, I prefer to add only 1/8 cup of flour.  I serve it over soba noodles.

I thought this was average.  I followed others' suggestions, used more broth, more ginger, more garlic, added some crushed red pepper and some sliced onion.  It still seemed to "lack" something.  I may make it again and try to kick it up some more.

Very good. Everyone loved it. I followed the advice of another cook and used sirloin. Will definitely keep this recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

Definitely restaurant-style. I made a few changes, of course. I used about 4 TBS soy sauce, 2 cloves of garlic, added some red pepper flakes to the soy mixture, added 8 oz sliced mushrooms and used a bit more ginger than it called for. Served it with steamed white rice on the side and coconut shrimp as an appetizer. This dish will leave you plenty of leftovers and reheats well. Prep work takes a little while but well worth it!

My boyfriend and I thought this recipe was terrible! The gravy/sauce was very bland and tasted horrible.  I will not make this recipe again!

I am always a little cautious about making asian food because it never turns out ok, but I got brave with this recipe based on the reviews and LOVED IT!  My husband loved it and my neighbor was over and couldn't believe I made it.   Will definitely keep this recipe in my dinner rotation!!!

TIPS:  Definitely double the sauce.  I also added some chili pepper, garlic salt and ginger for some more flavor.  We served over chow mein noodles I found in the grocery store and it was great!!  I also used sirloin steak just because I bought a bunch at the grocery store and it was perfect.

My family loved it!!!! I tweaked it a bit and used a half can of beefy mushroom soup along with the can of broth also I added fresh mushrooms, red and green peppers. I love the kick the ginger added and the overall taste was fantastic. I will definitely make this again!!!

This was a quick and easy meal...perfect for weeknights.  The sauce has a nice flavor and if you can get the meat pre-sliced it's a real time-saver.  Try it, you'll like it!

Very good flavor. I followed most of the suggestions, but found that two cans was too saucy (even added a little more flour to thicken, to no avail). I'd go with 1 1/2 cans next time and a bit more flour. I like my sauce thicker so it clings to the food, but not "mud". Also, a bit more garlic than 2 tsp. if you use fresh/minced (maybe 3). 2 should be enough if you use powdered. I like lots of flavor! There was plenty fresh ginger at 2 tsp.

We really enjoyed this recipe but the sauce does not need to be doubled as indicated by another reviewer.  We did this and the end result was way too much sauce.  I will definitely make this again, but will add some fish sauce for a bit more savoury flavour.

This recipe is easy and tastes wonderful.  I served it over rice and it tasted just like my favorite Chinese restaurant in San Francisco.  I added more garlic and ginger, and some black pepper.

Cooks fast and tastes good! I actually steamed my broccoli separately and just before serving I tossed it with the beef and sauce.

This was fine, just not anything special.  I gave it 3 stars for being fairly healthy and easy.  I will try adding garlic powder to the beef when cooking it to add more flavor, as suggested by another reviewer.

This recipe is okay as long as you are not expecting Chinese beef and broccoli--it definitely is nothing close to that!  But it is edible and makes a nice gravy.  But just beware it's definitely not take out by any means!!!

This is a quick meal to make on a work night, my husband is not a fan of cooked vegetables and loves the cripiness of the broccoli, My 3 yr old loves it also.  Have been making it regularly since I found it on the site, a family favorite.

This is the closest I have tried to restaurant style beef and broccoli.  I made double the amount of sauce, and it was too much... probably would have been better doing 1.5 times the called for amount.  Came out great anyway.  And I added onions too when I started cooking the beef.

This turned out excellent!!!! I did add a good bit of garlic salt in the meat when it was cooking and without it I think it would have been bland. I also used ribeye because thats what I has on hand. It is my mew favorite recipe.

This was a pretty good recipe.  Still not as good as take out.  I added some onion and increased the garlic.  Next time I will double or triple the soy sauce - it was too bland without it.

This was a really easy middle of the week recipe. However the sauce was too sweet, next time I'll use less sugar and more soy sauce. I will also buy a better meat that have more flavor. I would definitely remove meat while cooking fresh vegtables.

WOW.. what a great 30 minute meal!  Boiled water for noodles while slicing partically frozen beef (secret to get it REALLY thin) and everything was ready SO quickly.  Sauteed the bef in sesame oil, flavoured it just right!  Enjoyed with noodles.. and a side of plain ol corn added great colour to the meal!  Sprinkled a bit of sesame seeds on top..   YUM

Recipe worked well as I marinaded the beef first, added some onion when browning the beef and then I added some oyster sauce to the broth for more flavor.  I was able to double the recipe successfully.  Kids really gobbled it up, although I prefer more of an authentic chinese style taste.

Meh. Was not impressed by this recipe at all. Maybe I didn't use good broth, although I like the brand and have used it before.  I thought there was an awful lot of flour added to the sauce (which I also found to be a lot like a gravy).  It was just all around bland and... just pretty bad.  I don't even know how you'd doctor this up to make it better... Also, I thought high heat was waaaaay too hot to cook the meat.

Not only was this recipe very tasty, but really easy to make. I added onions to give it more crunch. Just add them in with the broccoli. It comes out great... I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was "ok".  The sauce was a little sweet.  I cut the beef very thin (makes it more tender) and I marinated it in soy, sake, brown sugar and a touch of ginger.  Meat was good, but sauce was only fair.

I thought this dish was very good. Unlike the other reviewers, I thought the "gravy" was wonderful. I like having some to spoon over rice or noodles. Will make again

this was pretty good.   i marinated the beef all day in teriyaki sauce with a couple shakes of ginger powder. my sauce turned out a little too gravy-ish, so next time i would lighten up on the flour & only use 1/8 cup.  i wanted more of a brothy, glazey sauce.  i splashed some worcestershire in with the soy sauce, & i think it made a huge difference!  we liked it, but did not love it.

This was ok. I was hoping it would have more Asian flavor to it. I even added some sesame oil to cook the beef in, and it was still a little bland.

this recipe really did NOT do it for me.  the sauce was bad and really thick.  i tried many of the suggestions given but in the end, it was almost inedible.  basically, this is a VERY americanized version of this dish and those looking for an authentic flavor will NOT find it here.

I made Beef Broccoli and beef teriyaki at the same time. One on one side of the stove and one on the other side.  The Beef teriyaki won hands down. The Beef Broccoli I didn't have the flavor the beef teriyaki did.  I found both recipes on this web site.

I'm giving this recipe a 3 star because although I didnt care for it, it has potential.  The sauce was bland, but the meat (sirloin) was tender.  With the right additions this recipe could become a family pleaser.

WOW! what a great recipe. A total hit with my family especially my husband who has been a chef for 5 star properties around the world for the last 20 years. I just added Cauliflower as that was what I had handy. I also used garlic and ginger paste and added a few chillis for a little extra zing

Recipe was okay. The sauce was too sweet, so I added red pepper flakes to balance it out as well as more garlic. Next time I will try adding more veggies & some onion.

I've used this recipe several times as is; sometimes I add peppers and carrots as well.  I do not find the sauce bland as other reviewers have stated; I think the combination of beef broth and soy sauce adds enough flavor.

This is a good base, but the sauce was very bland.  I sauteed onions with the beef and added red peppers, snow peas and water chestnuts (we love veggies), and it was still very boring.  Next time I might add hot sauce or chili powder.  Thanks for the recipe.

I agree that this is not "just like take-out".  It is, however, pretty good.  Like other reviewers, I added a chopped onion.  In my opinion, it needs more soy sauce, but that's because I love the taste of it and like it strong.  I'll just note to add more to it the next time I make it.  I will make this again, but I'll still be indulging in take out every now and then!

As a former general manager of an oriental restaurant, I can tell you that this is not "just like take out" but it is good. My family likes it and we will make it again. I did follow the advice about using the sirloin and slicing it while it was still partially frozen. Great tip! I also added larger amounts of the spices and garlic for a stronger flavor. Easy and Yummy!

While this was very good, it was no where near what we get at our fav chinese restaurant.  We think this tasted like pepper steak.  We will make it again, but ill not use round steak.  It made it taste too much like stew.  The sauce was great like everyone else has stated.

Made this tonight and it was great.  Hubby is not a brocoli fan and he ate a bunch of it.  He suggested that we might add pea pods and some water chestnuts next time we have this.  I totally agree as I love the veggies.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was fantastic! It was fast and easy as well. I used cornstarch instead of flour and added onion as other reviewers suggested. I can't wait to make it again. I made extra because we love leftovers, and I am glad I did.

VERY TASTY!! Since I do not eat beef and shy away from chicken, I substituted fresh tuna for the beef and chicken broth for the beef broth and it was still DELICIOUS. I used frozen broccoli and added a few onions as others did and served it over white rice. I will be making this again! Thanks Sara!

Mmmmm...no more stopping for takeout!  This is great - better than the one from the local Chinese restaurant!  Hubby polished off the rest of the pan at midnight!

This was pretty good! Easy to put together, low in WW Points (3). Lacking in the flavor department slightly, but I used reduced sodium Soy Sauce. Next time I will add onions. I added water chestnuts...it was 'eh' with them. The sauce was good though, I may use that as a base for other recipes. I will try marinading it in Sherry like another reviewer suggested next time...there will be one!

I thought this recipie was fantastic. The only things I changed were I doubled it, since I make more for lunches the next day. I also marianated the meat first for 30 min, and subsituted pea pods. The sauce was GREAT! Hub loved it and so did kids. Great recepie!

This was a tasty treat! Great reviews from the family.  I may use snow peas along with other vegetables next time I try this for some variety. Fast and easy, even for a beginner like me!

This was really good.  I doubled the sauce recipe so there was enough to put over rice.  My whole family loved this.

I made this again last night using chicken instead of beef.  Using chicken broth instead of beef.  I also substituted frozen french style green beens for the broccoli and added water chestnuts and baby corn.  It was really good however, next time I will cut down a little on the sugar with the chicken version.

I doubled the sauce so there would be extra and served over white rice.
