I made sure to marinade as one reviewer thought skipping the marinade may have changed the dish but I'm not sure what the marinade did as we found this a little lacking in the flavour we were expecting. It was missing something. If there was a honey glaze to go over the cooked chicken it would be much better in my opinion. All that said my family liked the dish! Thanks patti!

Very easy to make - and family said it was tasty. Not full of flavor but a good quick dish.

I added chilli flakes to the breading and it added flavour and heat to this dish. My family is a big fan of spicy food so it was a big hit at our house.

I cut the recipe in half but otherwise followed the directions as written with one exception---I didn't marinate the chicken as long as required. And for me that might have been my downfall because I felt that it needed a little more flavor. Hubby didn't agree with me at all! He loved it! I did think the amount of marinade was running a little short so don't be afraid to add more of it! I liked the idea of the corn flakes and walnuts. I will make this again using the full marinating time. Thanks patti! We had enough left over for dinner the second night too!
