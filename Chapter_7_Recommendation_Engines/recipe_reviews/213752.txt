Made into cupcakes. I also did not swirl the colors at all. I wanted a very straight, uniform "rainbow" type effect. This was VERY NEAT looking. I also used the regualr liquid food coloring, not the gel type. If you only have the liquid type coloring, here is the ratio of drops to make each color. PURPLE is 9 R and 6 B.  BLUE is 12 drops. GREEN is 12 drops. YELLOW is 12 drops. ORANGE is 12 Y and 4 R. RED is 18 drops. The red will look a bit pink but will turn out bright red when baked.

I'm the recipe submitter (and I, obviously, love this cake!).  If you have a favorite from scratch cake recipe, that works well, too!  I no longer use the toothpick test; I prefer to gently press the top of the cupcake...if it *bounces* back-it's done (helps to prevent overbaking).  These rock as cupcakes, too!  These (in cake or cupcake form) are so simple to make, yet I've never taken them anywhere where they weren't "ooed" and "awed" over.  Your friends and family will think you are a baking rock star when you show up w/these!

Made this back when she shared it on the Recipe Exchange. My kids flipped for it and we had a blast making it together. This is also good to use with a homemade white cake, if you'd rather not used boxed mix. GREAT recipe to make for Pride Week.

I first saw the "Clown Vomit Cake" mentioned in a blog, and HAD to try it, just for the name.  i used a homemade pound cake, colored the batter with gel food coloring (about 7 different colors,) and baked it it a tube pan.  What a hit!  Make a glaze and use some fun sprinkles on top.  I have since used this idea to make a "Santa Vomit Cake" for Christmas, using plain batter, red, and green.  What a great idea this is..... You can use different colors for different holidays...... Red, White, and Blue would be great for the 4th of July.  Thanks for such and neat idea (P.S. when you color your batter, you can just "plop" it in the pan.  It will marble while it bakes!)

Made these for easter! I bought neon and regular gel food coloring because it was all I could find and the colors turned out amazing! We used pink, green, blue, orange, yellow and purple for the cake and neon green, blue for the frosting. I also bought colored sugar (we made this into cupcakes) and topped each one with the different colors. They turned out amazingly bright and everyone loved them. My sister actually wants me to make a cake like this for her birthday. If you make cup cakes, just pour about 2 cups of the batter into 6 different bowls and add the gel coloring.. blend together and dump a tablespoon of each color into the cups. Two boxes made 34 cupcakes.. half of which were gone 30 minutes into our celebration.

My niece and I made these for her 7th birthday. We had a lot of fun mixing the bright colors. We layered the colored cake batter into muffin pans to make cupcakes and did not swirl the batter. To make layering easier I put the batter into sandwich baggies and piped it into the pan.  I really thought the colors were going to be dull but was pleasantly surprised at how bright they turned out after baking.  I frosted my cupcakes with Fluffy White Frosting from this site. Thanks so much, lovetohost, for such a fun colorful idea! I am sure we will be making these again.

Awesome! I chose not to swirl my colors, as I wanted a more layered look than swirled one and was super happy with how they turned out. Super cute. Frosted with Butter Cream Frosting II for a yummy combo. Thanks LTH! :)

I made these into cupcakes - they were so fun to make and eat! It made a beautiful tie-dye effect - I think next time I may try it in 2 round pans, and layer each color like the rainbow instead of swirling it. I passed this recipe on to two other friends that requested it! And I love the idea from one of the last reviewers of changing colors for the holidays :)

I'm so glad you finally got this approved!! Absolutely delish and so fun to make. Used for my daughters butterfly cake and a beach cake for a luau party. Gel or powdering colorings are a godsend here to get vibrant colors.

Perfect recipe and a splendid idea! They were a hit at my church fete! I used 1 box of white cake mix but intend to make my own white the next time I make this, coz I've found a perfectly YUM recipe for white cake...for those interested, the recipe is 'Simple White Cake' by Scottosman! Like the other reviewers suggested, I didn't swirl the colours too, and I'm glad I didn't! Also, I followed My4boys's suggestion on getting the colours as well! For those who can't find her review here's an excerpt from her review: 'If you only have the liquid type coloring, here is the ratio of drops to make each color. PURPLE is 9 R and 6 B. BLUE is 12 drops. GREEN is 12 drops. YELLOW is 12 drops. ORANGE is 12 Y and 4 R. RED is 18 drops. The red will look a bit pink but will turn out bright red when baked.' 
I frosted this with 'Buttercream Icing' by Sharon Gerstman. I didn't colour the icing because I wanted a contrast to the colourful cake! Once again, thank you lovestohost for this recipe! :)

Okay... I had a major issue with this cake.... The colors were wonderful and the marbled effect was really neat, but the second it was finished this funny smell washed over the room. My 4 year old son asked "Why did you make a cake out of playdough mommy?!?" and sure enough, after a quick testing, not only did it smell like playdough - it also tasted like playdough.... ew. Any suggestions as to what I might have down wrong?!?! I used a Duncan Hines white cake mix box and ....oh.... I used vegitable oil instead of canola. Do you think that would have made a difference? Either way, I'm dissapointed, because after all that planning and preparation.... I'll be buying a store bought cake for my husbands birthday tonight.  :(

I love making this recipe! I always make cupcakes with it, and they are ALWAYS a hit! The extra work is so worth it. I should mention that when you add the colors to NOT attempt to smooth them out. It will swirl the colors together and ruin the "rainbow" effect. Just pile one on top of the other. You CAN do this! Gel food colors make extra bright colors.

I used this for my son's first birthday cake, because I thought it would be fun to destroy. And it really was. I carved the cake, so I would have preferred it to be a little bit more dense, but it looked excellent. I used yellow, green, blue, red, and purple paste coloring, and it turned out super vivid. I was very happy with the results. The colors seemed a little dull before baking, but it turned out beautifully.

I LOVE this recipe!! I've made several batches and have tried several different color schemes.  I did bright neon colors for a retro birthday party and Halloween colors for my sons party.  I have also used a yellow cake mix and it turned out just as good.  I will be making these often!!

Very simple to make.  I used the Wilton gel colors in the small jars and got the vivid colors I wanted.  I didn't swirl the colors, but plopped them in one spoonful at a time as stated in the recipe.  I really don't know why this wouldn't work just following the directions on the cake package and not taking the time to whip the egg whites and just leaving in the yolks.

these are WONDERFUL for kids, but seriously- my Mom has been making them since I was little and liquid food coloring works FINE. It says that paste coloring is "necessary" but I promise you, it's not. If you want bold coloring, perhaps use the paste; but for light to medium pastel, liquid is tops.

What a great idea. The thought had never crossed my mind to bake a cake with different colors. Thank you so much for the recipe. I used a yellow cake mix and mixed food coloring with the batter. That was what I had on hand. My 6 y/o daughter helped. We had a great time making and baking this cake. Turn out really nice.

This was fantastic! Made into cupcakes for my son's 3rd birthday party yesterday. I didn't find any of that concentrated paste colouring so I just used a lot of regular food colouring drops: After separating into 3 different bowls I used 60 drops of red in one, blue in another and yellow in the third bowl. Colours turned out nice and bright. Wished I had swirled the colours more but will do that the next time!

My daughter & I made this last year to bring into school for her birthday. I used gel food coloring but the colors came out like pastels when it baked. I would use more food coloring to get the vibrant color that is shown in the picture.

I made these into tie dye cupcakes for my daughters birthday party last year.  (We also dyed t-shirts.)  I just followed the directions from a box mix and added the food coloring and gave each cupcake a little swirl with a toothpick.  My 3 year old "helped" make these however, when I turned away she started painting herself with the green food coloring.  After much soaking in the tub and scrubbing with vinegar and draining green water and refilling with clear water, she was finally clean.

What huge hit at my daughter's 9th birthday party.  Everybody loved the outside but when I cut into they all squealed with delight.  I have three requests already!!!  I chose this recipe over one that used Sprite.  I am so glad I picked this one.  In addition to looking fabulous, it tasted delicious!!  I doubled th recipe and split into three pans (layers).  Each pan had two colors so it really looked like a rainbow.  I also put a flower nail in the center of the pan/batter.  This kept the cake from dooming.  Thanks for this great recipe.  I will definitely be using this one over and over.

I made this cake for my 3 year old's birthday.  I used a yellow cake mix and added a box of instant vanilla pudding mix and adjusted some of the ingredients on the cake mix.  The only color that didn't quite turn out vibrant was the purple color.  It looked really gray.  Maybe I will use a white mix next time.  But since I used the purple of the bottom it really didn't matter.  I also used two circle pans and had three colors in each for a total of six colors.  It turned out moist and colorful.  The cake was a huge success.  Everyone talked about it.  I will definately make this again and probably will make them into cupcakes.

I have been doing this idea for years now!  So happy to see it here for others to enjoy it!  It's really a kid pleaser.  I made it for my daughters 10th B-day party.  THX

I made this cake... well, cupcakes.... for my daughters 5th Birthday. They turned out wonderful. I did change it up some due to an issue with eggs. I just made my normal cake mix with apple sauce and baking powder in place of the eggs and then followed the layering hints given here. Turned out great.

I used the same idea for my 12 year old son's birthday.  I also made the icing tye-dyed.  I called it a tye-dye cake.  It turned out pretty cool and everyone loved it.  But, I made a yummy homemade banana cake!!!  What a cool way to celebrate for an adult or older child.

These were SO fun to make and eat!!  I’m not a fan of using boxed cake mix, so I used the Heavenly White Cake recipe from this site in place of the boxed cake mix.  I will absolutely make these again!

Tasty and pretty too! Divided the batter into six bowls and added a different paste food color to each bowl (use paste colors for the most vibrant colors).  I put each colored batter into a Ziploc bag and piped a small amount the colors into lined muffin pans - great rainbow effect. Frosted with white buttercream and put a little sugar decoration on top - lovely!

This will be made for my son's 4th birthday. We made a pre test one only because I have the food coloring drops and not the paste. It was fun to make and you get a different result all the time. I cant wait to make this for him so I know he will be happy about it. Thanls for the recipe and thinking out of the box.

This review isn't for taste, because you know what you're getting with vanilla cake mix, I am reviewing this on ease, appearance, and the joy it brought my eight year old to make and share with her class.  I didn't want the colors to turn out pastel, but if you are going to use the classic dropper food coloring I think they will.   I followed recommendations of others and still got pastels, but it still looked great.

I've made this twice now and it is so easy and fun to make. My kids enjoy helping stir the different color icing gels into the different bowl of batter. I make this in a rectangular baking stone for easy traveling. It is so cute! Thanks for the great recipe.

Lots of fun. Finally got on the ball, juggled the bowls (only three, this time out) and joined the parade of ruffle-collared, red-nosed, big-footed Bozos (just kidding) making this circus ready confection. I used powdered dyes, and tried various methods of swirling the colored batter in the cups: spoon, spoon handles, skewer, and simple dollops. Picture posted on my profile page. Thanks, LTH for a more appetizing name and a fun session of baking.

Will the flavor didn't change with the cake mix, this was totally fun to day. It worked out so well with the cake style I made for my daughter, to let her know how proud I was of her, doing so well in school. I took the mix and divided the 6 colors into 2 small 8 inch round cakes, and I had a blast!! My kids went bananas over the whole appearance of the cake...cutting was another story. I had the darn thing loaded down with 48 ounces of M&M's and 10 standard size Kit Kat Bars....Worth it....It made a great conversation piece with my kids. Thank you so much for this Rainbow Clown Cake recipe....I know have a purpose to make it again for an upcoming event.

I made rainbow cupcakes for my son's 5th birthday and these cupcakes were an absolute hit!!!  I was very generous with my food coloring gel and created very bright colors!  These are awesome and fun to eat! I plan to make some bright red/white/blue one's for the 4th of July!

I made these for my little cousins and they (and I =D) absolutely loved them. Used white cake mix with regular liquid food coloring and the colors came out very bright. Topped with cream cheese frosting and rainbow sprinkles. I'm definitely making these again!

This is a great idea. I have made it a few times for cupcakes and noticed if you want clean layers of color to make sure the batter is thick. When I had thin batter the colors moved around more than when I had thicker batter. I think you just need to use one less egg to make it thicker. It didn't affect the taste. This is my new Easter tradition! Thanks for the idea!

I saw a similar recipe in Family Fun and made these for my daughter's St. Patty's Day party.  Instead of icing, I just pushed a gold chocolate coin 1/2 into the cupcake and called them Gold at the End of the Rainbow cupcakes!!  Will do the circus thing next !!!

I made these for St Patrick's Day and put a gold chocolate coin on top for decoration.  These were so cute and so good!  I followed the directions on the cake package and added 1 tsp almond extract.  Frosted with white buttercream cake frosting and rainbox sprinkles.  My three girls thought they were great!  We will make these again!  I love the fun name- clown vomit cake!  CUTE!

I made recipe exactly as written except made cupcakes for the 4th instead. They turned out so wonderful! I didn't swirl any colors, just put blue on bottom, then left white in middle and put red on top. My family thought they were awesome. Topped with cream cheese frosting and cut up strawberries to top with also.

Such a fun idea!  I made this recipe into cupcakes for my daughter's preschool for St. Patty's Day.  All the kids loved the colors and it worked out great since they were talking about rainbows that day.

I made this cake over the weekend for my daughter's birthday. I used cream cheese frosting and crushed up Oreos in it becuase her original request was for Oreo ice cream cake--which I had to veto because we had her party at a skating rink and it would have melted. 
I made the cake while she was gone, and then wrapped up the glass pan so that she couldn't see into it. When I cut it at the party and lifted out the first piece, all of the kids' jaws dropped open and my daughter was SO excited! It was so much fun to surprise her with such a neat cake. Will upload a picture as soon as I find my camera cord!

Made into Mardi Gras colors and they turned out good. Five stars for looks and creativity but if it tasted great, that would be the whole package.

Absolutely perfect. I made it for my 3 year old daughter's birthday party. Everyone enjoyed it. I have made it a number of times since, not always doing the different colors.

Wow was this ever a fun recipe! I just followed the directions on the back of the cake mix and it was great. I used regular food coloring as that is all I had. I made a cake and 3 batches of cupcakes and I did different designs everytime. Some I swirled, some I layered etc and I had just as much fun as my kids. Would highly recommend this recipe.

I made this for my sons 5th Birthday, everyone was asking how I did it! I made as Cupcakes, don't think I'd do that again, as was VERY time consuming and ran out of two colours because over filled the first 12 I made and the last 12 were underfilled!

My 7 yrd old had so much fun with this cake.  In fact, she had such fun that the 13 yr old jumped in to "help" as well.  Little time consuming but so worth the extra effort

My niece loved this cake for her 4th birthday! I only did four colors-- red, yellow, green, and blue. It looked fabulous and my brother and his wife were quite surprised by the cake. Definitely a HUGE hit with kids! I made it as an ice-cream cake with berry sherbert between the 2-9" cake rounds, then covered with cool whip and pink sprinkles. My niece kept wanting to open the freezer to look at it.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. I had to make a few changes due to different ingerdients on hand. I used vegetable oil in place of canola oil. I also only had liquid food coloring so I made my choice of colors and hoped for the best! The cupcakes turned out perfect and the colors were great! I will make this cake for many years to come!!! Thanks for sharing the idea...

This was great! I spooned big plops of colored batter all over the pan and then swirled it with a butter knife. Turned out perfectly and got rave reviews from a bunch of 12 year olds! I brushed the cake with a vanilla simple syrup and frosted with the Grocery Store frosting recipe from this site. So fun and delicious!

These cupcakes are awesome! They are colorful and great for special occasions. I used Betty Crocker gel colors, they turned out very pastel- good for a baby shower. Next time I will use Wilton colors for a brighter color palette!

A huge hit for my son's 3rd bday and SO easy to make! I made these as cupcakes with a basic buttercream frosting and they were so delicious. I can't wait to modify these a bit in the future for other holidays, can be easily modified to fit your needs!

Fantastic! I was concerned with the "swirling" because I've seen pictures that didn't turn out so great. seems the key is to just dribble the colors in randomly (I kept alternating colors and just kind of "globbing" it in there... and it turned out great!) I also did a straight layered style which is nifty too.  You can use any colors your heart desires, and the fact that this is a box recipe (slightly altered with the amount of oil, water, and eggs) makes life so much easier!

So much fun to make!!  Made this into cupcakes, it does take a little while to put it all together.  But, the end result is definitely worth it!  I used 7 different colors and each cupcake came out different and unique.  People could not quit commenting on how cool these were.  Thanks for a great recipe LTH!!

Excellent! The egg whites keep the base color for the batter white so the colors are vibrant and beautiful, and I think it also keeps the cake light and moist.  I split this between five colors - used "pastel" gel colors (although I added a few extra drops) for Easter colors and made cupcakes. One recipe gave me 18 cupcakes.  Thanks for sharing, LTH! Love this one! :)

Too Cool! I made these for my "Little Flower Child" daughter. She loves everything about the 60's, the music, all the upheaval, the clothes, the passion, etc. When I came across this recipe I knew I had to surprise her for her birthday. I made cupcakes and she loved them and thinks "Mom" is the greatest.

oh my gosh!  i made this cake with my kids and it is SO FUN.  we didn't have gel coloring...just the regular liquid stuff you get in the bottles.  also, since we live at high altitude i added in about 1.5 tbls of flour just incase.  it came out perfectly!  the colors are so pretty and the cupcake was yummy too.  thanks for the great recipe...we're making it again later on this week!

10 stars!  I baked this recipe into cupcakes, and striped the colors instead of swirling them.  If you want to be a superstar with your kids or anyone else's, make this recipe!  My daughter loved them, her friends loved them, and they were delicious.  I topped them with a vanilla bean cream cheese buttercream frosting and they were fabulous--exactly how you would expect a birthday cake to taste!  Perfect method LTH, thanks for sharing!!  *Update--I frosted these cupcakes with this frosting.  Fabulous combination!  http://allrecipes.com/PersonalRecipe/62789942/Vanilla-Bean-Birthday-Cupcake-Frosting/Detail.aspx

Such a fun cake, I make them into cupcakes ( it makes a better rainbow) and the kids go CRAZY for them, but I do as well. I never knew a cupcake could make someone so happy, but they're so colorful how can you NOT be happy while eating them! I add white frosting and rainbow sprinkles

This cake was really easy and fun to make. I received lots of compliments on how vivid the colors were and how moist the cake was. I baked it in an average 9X13 pan for about 20 minutes and it came out perfect. Definately one i'll make again!

I made this as a 9x13" cake and took it to Easter dinner at friends'.  It was a hit with the kids.  I loved all the colors, except my purple looked a little grayish - but that could have been my food coloring.  I did use regular liquid food coloring and didn't have any problems.   And thanks to the reviewer who gave us the "formula" as to how many drops to use to make each color.  I swirled it just a bit with a toothpick. I frosted this with Butter Cream Frosting II, also from this site, and sprinkled it with brightly colored sprinkles.   Thank you!

How fun was that! I used the paste coloring, and went with pastels since it was for Easter. Looked so nice! I made cupcakes, unfortunately, I didn't guesstimate how many correctly. I tried to make 24, I really should have only made 20 to get some nice sized cupcakes (maybe even 18). Had a blast making them with my 7 yr old.

I used 8oz jelly jars (sprayed inside with pan coating) and filled them 1/2 full using teaspoons.  I then set the jars in a lasagna pan and filled the bottom with 1/2 inch of water.  Bake about 50 minutes (or when toothpick comes out clean)  The kids LOVED them!

My five year old grandson and I made this recipe into cupcakes. We did not swirl or layer neatly. He placed a spoonful of one color into the cup and I placed one. They were beautiful! We kept the name - Clown Throwup. Oh, we didn't frost but sugared the top before we put them into the oven. He had a blast with that!

This recipe was quite disappointing. I tried to follow the recipe without using a cake mix, and making a white cake from scratch, using only the dry ingredients that the recipe shared in common with a mix. This made the batter extremely thin-- like soup. At this point I was doubtful already, so I tasted the batter. It barely had any flavor so I added some vanilla. I made the batter rainbowy, put it in the oven, and waited apprehensively. When it was ready, they hadn't even risen 1/2 way, but they were ready. I took a bite of one, and to my dismay, they tasted like less flavorful mini angel food cakes. YUCK. So, I threw all 24 cupcakes a away and proceeded to make a new batch from a yellow cake recipe (and they turned out great!). So, I rated it 2 stars because teh dying concept was cool. I'm sticking to my yellow rainbow cake recipe though. Any recipe that relies on a MIX deserves no more than 2 stars in my book. ~Bae

5 stars for presentation! Kids and adults love this.  I used the Cream Cheese Pound Cake III recipe from this site for the base here, and split one cake recipe into two small bundt/angel food pans for gifts (1 hour at 325). Mixed 6 colors and dropped evenly between the two pans. Also, I've split batter three ways (orange, green and white - no food color) for St Pat's day, and am making right now using spring colors for Easter. Lots of fun, thanks for sharing, and for the food coloring drop ratios (they work great)!

This cake was beautiful!  Only problem was that it was a lot of food coloring.  Kids loved it though.

Delicious! I used two boxes to make a double layer round 9 inch cake. My 4 year old daughter had so much fun mixing the colors in. I used the Buttercream frosting II with this cake and it was amazing!

I made cupcakes instead of one cake, but they turned out really pretty, I used less coloring to have a pastel look. I also looked up white cake recipe instead of using white cake mix since it taste sooo much better than cake made from a package if you bake your cupcakes from scratch.

this was great! except (this is my fault) when i put in all the cupcake mix into the cup, and they baked, they were a mess! I was looking for a straight and clean look, but it was messy and gross looking! but all the other pictures looked great! i must have done something wrong!

My 12 year old son got a kick out of making clown cake cupcakes.....he enjoyed eating them too. They turned out so colorful. It just made us happy to see all the bright colors coming out of the oven.

This was fun to make and turned out beautifully. My only problem was I didn't have a cake mix so I needed to make a white cake from scratch. No problem--just looked it up here. The problem was with carefully folding the egg whited in and then mixing and mixing to get the colors mixed in well. Otherwise this is a great idea. I will just use an easier, less finicky cake recipe next time.

I made these red, white and blue for the 4th of July and they turned out perfectly.  These are not difficult to make, and they actually taste great.  The possibilities are endless for color combinations and flavors.  Thanks for the great idea! 9/2 - I made these for my son's birthday party at school, and I have never seen him so excited about cupcakes.  He thinks that these are awesome and they have all he has been talking about all day - what a fun recipe!

I made cupcakes instead of cake & they were a huge hit(not a big surprise tho;). Very easy & quick to make. I used neon gel colors & they came out bright & beautiful! Topped them w/"Butter Cream Frosting II" from this site & colored sprinkles. I can't wait for another reason to make them! Thanks lth!!

Love this!  Made as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Used the drop color method and the colors were great!  Also I like that even though this recipe had only 2 Tbs of oil and no yolks it was still moist and had a great texture.  Fun recipe - will definitely make again.

Big Hit! Our German Exchange student joined our family on her birthday... and this is the cake we decided to do for her American Birthday party.  It was fun to make and fun to eat. We plan on making it again and again. Maybe with cupcakes next time.

AMAZING!   I made this for my grandson's 12th birthday and cannot wait for him to cut into it.  He will be so surprised and I know he'll be calling it clown vomit to all his friends.  Thank you LTH for sharing this AMAZING recipe and helping to make his day special.  UPDATE:  My grandson loved his cake but the most surprising factor was the adults went "bonkers" over it!

I will be making this again. It looked great and tasted even better. I used regular drop-in food coloring and the colors were still bright. Needed another batch, but realized I was out of eggs- searched for a substitution and used some sprite instead. Those turned out even brighter and softer. Try this cake!

Made this into cupcakes and also another time into a cake. The kids LOVED it in cupcakes and the adults loved it in the cake version. Its so awesome looking. I used liquid and gel food coloring and it came at well with both.

Taste was OK...box cake mix.  The coloring idea was great.  My 6 year-old LOVED it!  I would not make it for the taste alone.  But the idea and end product is worth it.

This was so much fun to make. The kids loved all the different colors. I separated the batter into 5 different bowls - each cupcake got a teaspoon of colored batter - 4 teaspoon total of each color, perfect amount of batter.  Would definitely make this again.

This is such an awesome idea. I planned on making a cake mix from scratch but was a little short on time so used box mix. I made these red blue and green for my sons birthday and all the kids want them for their birthdays too! Its kind of a pain but was very fun and a nice surprise!

I made this recipe into cupcakes for my daughter's second birthday party.  I didn't mix the colors, just dolloped a bit of each color into the cupcake liners to bake.  Everyone was in awe over the colors!  I did use gel food coloring, and the colors were vibrant.  Simple to make, though a bit more time consuming than I anticipated - however it was well worth the effort.  I topped with a simple butter cream frosting and rainbow sprinkles.

These are so awesome!!  I made jumbo cupcakes for my son's 7th bday and everyone loved them! They key is to use 8 or 9 in round cake pans and stack them or use jumbo cupcakes if you want to use more than 3 colors. I will be making thse again and again! Thanks for the recipe! :)

These didn't get the  "WOW" reaction I was hoping for at our fundraiser but they still sold out. I divided the batter equally into ziplocs and kneaded in 1/4 t. of color pot gel.   I was very happy with the color intensity.  DD said the wrappers were almost too pretty to throw away.

Just got done making these with my two year old.  Was a great way to practice his colors and culinary skills;)  I should post a picture of his tie-dyed face b/c I caught him robbing the bowls of batter!!  I followed the cake mix directions for bake time and did cupcakes...these are a keeper!  Love the other reviewers ideas for holiday themes, he's a 4th of July baby, so I can't wait to do some RWB for his birthday!  Thanks for sharing;)

For people who are into Reiki, this can be a Chakra Cake! I used 3 eight inch round cake pans and a double batch of white cake mix. I weighed and split the batter into 7 medium sized pyrex cups. I used the gel coloring. Because I've had so many requests for this cake, I acquired 7 empty (and thouroughly cleaned) liquid dish detergent bottles (with the pull open, push close caps). I place each of the colored batter mixes in its own bottle, then gently squeeze it into the 3 cake pans ( 3 colors in the 1st pan, then 2 colors in the other 2 pans). To get a good distinction between the colors, you want to add the colors on top of each other gently, as too much pressure will result in the colors 'blobbing' into each other. The detergent bottles can be used over and over again. Please note that the cake pan with the 3 colors will cook longer than the other (2 color) pans.

Very cute idea. I'd been trying for months to impress my boyfriend's friends, and when one of their birthdays rolled around, I decided to go all out on the cake. Didn't marbleize the colors, because I thought stripes worked better for the rainbow idea. I used gel colors, and the colors turned out vibrant. The technique did seem to reduce the yield (I had to go through two boxes of mix for a two layer 9 inch cake) so that's something to be aware of.

This was the biggest flop I have ever made.  I made it in a 2 layer cake and both layers completely stuck to the pans.  Great idea but I wouldn't follow the recipe it shows I would just make a regular cake with the instructions that are shown on the box and color it accordingly. I think this recipe makes the cake too crumbly and it just fell apart.  So now my nephew is stuck with a cake for his birthday that looks like a 5 year old made it :(

Very fun & good.  I made for a 26 yr old funky kinda girl (daughter) and she loved it.  So did everyone else.  I only used 4 colors and found the gel food color at Hobby Lobby.  Now everyone want's this cake for their BD...

very easy to prepare! & it makes a great impression. I found it best to spoon in the different colors then slightly stir with a fork to get a tie-died look.

Made cupcakes in red, white, & blue for the 4th of July. Can't wait to make these for other holidays and change up the colors. Every one at the picnic thought they were great. I used Butter Cream Frosting II which most thought was too sweet so will probably try and find a different frosting to use next time.

I made this cake for an office party last night. Here are some comments I got: "This is the prettiest cake I've ever eaten!" "This is amazing! How did you do that?!" "Can you be my roommate?" "WOW." Then they all took a picture, before eating it. And just like that it was gone.  With that said, I made vanilla icing and it was too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll use pudding and cream for the topping.

Made this with my boyfriend's ten year old daughter, and she had sooo much fun making it. We used like four different colors and then colored the icing as well. It all got eaten, and everybody enjoyed it. We mixed whipped icing with marshmallow fluff, and put that in the middle of two layers. The easiest thing to do is make the cake accordingto the directions on the box, then follow directions in this recipe. We used gel food coloring and it worked fine, although it's hard to measure the colors. (We had a purple that was kind of muddied.) Other than that it was a great success. =)

This is GENIUS! I did a trial run for my daughter's birthday cupcakes this weekend, and they turned out awesome. And, I love that you can play with the colors to get the effect you want. But, keep in mind this is more a decorating idea than a recipe, per se, so if you're not a fan of the flavor, try a different cake mix. I used the gel coloring, and that gave me a nice vibrant and rich set of colors.

I only gave it 4 stars because it was so time consuming. I made them into cupcakes for my daughters 1st birthday. They looked so cute smashed all over her face. I used french vanilla cake mix and made it like the box suggested, then seperated the batter into five bowls. I omited the orange color. For the icing I used butter cream. They were yummy.

I followed the directions on my cake box instead of using what these directions say.  I used gel coloring.  The colors turned out great!  This was really a very easy way to make a fun cake.  I did one small round cake and about 10 cupcakes for my son's 2nd b'day.  It was a hit b/c of the fun colors.  The flavor was good but it is just a box cake so nothing to write home about.  The 4th star is for the clever idea :)  I might make again for the kids if they want but the adults were needing something a little more adult-like....... you know, like chocolate!

I needed a cake for a friend of mine who was 1. Having a birthday and 2. Getting promoted to Supervisor.  We usually do store bought cakes but I wanted to surprise my crew so I made this an ice cream cake. I baked the cake in a glass bowl alternating the colors. It baked up beautifully! I put the ice cream in a foil lined cake pan. I turned the ice cream out onto a plate and topped it with the Clown  bowl. I frosted the whole thing with homemade frosting and used different colored gumballs to decorate the whole thing. We call my friend Becky Ball, hence the Ball theme.  She Loved it!! It was delicious! If a bit messy.

Everyone loved this at my son's 1st b-day party.  It was a little extra work, but not too bad, and my 5 year old helped.  I followed the guide from another reviewer. R 18 Y 12 G 12, B 12 drop food coloring.  I skipped O 12 Y and 4R and P 9 R 6 B.

Very pretty cake...I made it for my 2 year old's birthday. I used regular food coloring...using the number of drops recommended by another reviewer. It turned out very bright and vibrant. A very nice surprise when cutting through white frosting!

My youngest daughter loves rainbow colors so I made this for her birthday yesterday. I did this in a rectangle 9x13 pan so I didn't think I would get the nice even layer effect, but it turned out better than expected, with a slight swirl so it looked tie dyed. I used gel food coloring from the local crafts store. This was excellent and produced very vivid and bright colors. I posted a photo of it on my Facebook page and I got rave reviews on how it looked. Tastes good too. By the way, my daughter loved it, and now her older sister wants one!

This cake is not only delicious but looks so neat, too!  My 5 year old daughter and her friend made it together and did almost all of the work themselves.  Easy to make and will definitely be making again!  The grocery store didn't have paste food coloring, so I bought a 4-pack of neon gel food coloring.  I used liquid food coloring I had on hand for the remaining 2 bowls of batter and they all turned out well.

My kids will never let me make a plain cake ever again!! I just used this as an idea, I made my batter exactly as the box said, divided between 6 bowls, added a ton of food coloring ( I used neon colors). In a 9x13 I put random globs all over. They did NOT mix together and made an AMAZING NEON TIE DIE CAKE!! I colored sugar the same colors and made a random pattern on the top as well over the frosting! It a HUGE hit! I had strangers asking to take pics of the cake when we cut into it!! It took a lot of dishes and a fair amount of time, but it was TOTALLY WORTH IT   and WAY COOLER than any EXPENSIVE STORE BOUGHT CAKE!!

Loved this!!!!! I did not think the colours would turn out well when I tried this and i worried they would run together, but they didn't. I used food colouring paste and the colours were bright and vibrant. Just like the picture! I made this for my niece's 5th birthday and she was so surprised to see the inside of the cake when we cut in.

Yummy fun!  Made cupcakes from this recipe with my 6 & 4 yo niece and nephew and they had a blast! (Although, I'm not sure if their favorite part wasn't licking all the bowls!)    

We used a Duncan Hines white cake-mix and made the cake according to the recipe on the box, using egg whites.  Used gel paste, neon and regular, and they turned out very bright!  We also made 3 different color icings and topped with sprinkles.   

The kids were so excited about being a part of making them and couldn't wait to see the end results so they stayed very engaged in the project. YMMV. 

I was originally concerned the colors would blend together, but that wasn't an issue at all since the batter was thick enough.  

I used cupcake liners, but would not use them in the future.  The ones I used were thin and their lack of weight caused them to ride up in the muffin tins until they were full, and it made filling them more tedious.  My experience was they created an extra step/expense that just wasn't necessary.  

Used the White Cake Frosting II recipe from this site, but used butter flavored Crisco i/o plain.  The flavor was great, but it made the color of the icing off-white, so if you're wanting white icing, don't substitute.   I also needed more than the 4 T water the recipe called for.

I'm not a cake mix kinda gal, but I must say, they tasted great!

Presentation-wise, this looked so good! I used Wilton's gel paste and all it took was a small dab on the tip of a toothpick to get a light pastel shade, exactly the way I wanted it. Did not swirl the batter, but instead layered it by colour. Do take note of the number of colours you have and spoon in proportionate amounts cause you can't undo the layering! hehehe. 

Taste-wise, it was not that great; but that is probably because I used a cheap cake mix. I frosted the cupcake with some leftover cream cheese — looked nice but the taste didn't really blend. 

But I would still make this again, it is too pretty to pass.

This is such an ingenious idea and frankly, I'm a little disappointed that I never thought of this. I made red, white, and blue cupcakes with this recipe and they came out so cute. I used regular food color and it worked just fine. The blue isn't that dark but it worked. This dish inspired me to make red, white, and blue rice krispy treats and they also turned out great!

My 3 yr old picked out this recipe with me and loved putting them in the pan! Very easy and easily entertained her. I only had liquid food coloring and didn't seem to have a problem. I will add a pudding mix next time because the moistness and flavor was not spectacular but that was do to the mix I used!

Many times in many color combos! From kids’ bdays to adults, baby showers to football games. People love the colors! Warning: do NOT skimp on the food coloring! You’ll ruin the whole thing if you don’t use good quality paste colors. I personally use the gels from Wilton. Wonderful results everytime. When I say you lose quality if you try to take the tiny bit cheaper liquids, they will not only deprive the cake color vividnesss, they change the batter, and the baking. You’ll throw the baked cake in the garbage for it.

I made this for a one-year old's smash cake. I did more even layers instead of the "marble" effect. It was adorable!

I love this recipe so much! I made it for my friends surprise party. She asked me where I got the recipe. I told her that I got it from this website and she looked it up and made it for her new years eve party. This was such a fun idea that you had. Id love to call this recipe my own but unfortunately I cant do that. Love it.

I made this with the Simple White Cake recipe.  It looked amazing.  I might add more sugar next time to mask the food coloring taste...or a sweeter frosting (I used Fluffy White from this site)

These were a bit difficult. I did try them in a mini cupcake maker so next time I might have better success in the full size. It is a visual item more than a flavorful item.
