This was pretty good! Definitely easy! The only change I made was to broil the cheese for a minute after it melted so that it got a little crispy on top like French onion soup often has.

Very tasty but I thought it needed more cheese too and the "sauce" was a little thin. Next time I think I will dredge the chicken in flour before cooking in the pan. I will definitely make again though!

Pretty good very easy to make. I added some fresh garlic doubled the soup and doubled the cheese.
