This was so moist and very good- I did add chopped walnuts to the frosting since thats what I know as Rocky Road with the marshmallows and nuts- The cake was and frosting however were fabulous I was skeptical of the vinegar but did use it.  I intend to make it again.

MAKE THIS CAKE! It was VERY easy, and the glaze/frosting was simple and came out delicious as well, though sweet, which IMHO, is a good thing. Best cake of this type I've had in a long time.  Okay, so I confess I didn't sift anything. I did use a whisk to try and blend the dry ingredients, but I'm no pastry chef, so maybe that is supposed to do something, but the cake was amazing anyway.  I plan to use the glaze on other cakes. It set up pretty quickly, and would work on many other cakes. I also think I may double the cake recipe but not the glaze next time, and bake in a 9x13 pan. I think I may also try without the marshmallows.   DISCLAIMER: I do not, as a general rule, like chocolate cake. That being said, this one was absolutely delicious! Thanks for the recipe LEESON71!

Fantastic cake!!! I love the idea and it was  a big hit with everyone! I doubled the cake recipe and baked it in a 9" tin. I did not need to double the frosting. It melted well and spread easily over the cake. I sprinkled the cake with mini marshmallows, white and chocolate chocolate chips. The topping set nicely and held the topping in place. I will be making this again. It was very easy!!

I made this for my nephew who is allergic to milk and compared to his other dairy free cakes, this was excellent!! I sifted the dry mixture only once, and baked as directed.  Crumbly as I would expect a cake like this to be, but a very yummy version of dairy free cake!! Didn't make the frosting this round (the cake alone was yummy), but will definitely try it next time!

I love this cake!  I bring this to people who are sick or had a baby and the size is perfect.  The first time I made it I was out of white sugar so substitute brown sugar and I was so happy with the slight caramel flavor that I make it with brown sugar now.

Loved, loved, loved the cake but made more of a whipped icing the second time as I found this a bit too heavy for the cake.

This is a definite kid/teen pleaser. My kids would have given this 10 stars if they could have. My husband and I found it so-so and gave it 3 stars. It is super easy to make. I may not make it for us again, but it will be made for my kids and their friends for sure. Thank you for the recipe.

I made the cake exactly as directed and thought it was very good. Super easy and fast! I did add chopped walnuts as topping, which I thought added to the Rocky Road flavor and gave it a good change in texture.

The cake came out well-it baked up nicely and had a nice dark chocolatey taste.  The icing however, was too sweet for the cake and adding it kind of ruined the cake eating experience for us.

I used butter instead of oil, and freshly brewed coffee in place of the water. Amazing!!! I frosted with some peanut butter frosting that I had left over from another recipe, but will definitely make it again with its own frosting.

My toddler asked for a chocolate marshmallow cake for his third birthday so I made this one.  I baked it in mini muffin cups, plated them with whipping cream and a jumbo marshmallow, and drizzled the chocolate sauce on top.  It was a massive hit with both the kids and adults.  I used melted butter instead of oil and milk instead of water.  This recipe also makes excellent cookies

This was amazing , although I did not fold in marshmallows I layered them with the icing as I poured it over created a much nicer look. This was a delicious dessert and I will make it again.

I actually made it as written for my daughters birthday.  We all loved it but it is very rich.  Next time I make this I plan on stirring some marshmallows into the cake batter.

I made this cake on the weekend. Very dense I made it in 2 9in pans but next time I will buy the marshmallows as this was a long process and they did not set well perhaps because it was a wet day!

This topping was grainy.  I doubled recipe and found it needs at lease 40-45 minutes cook time.  I did not like marshmallows on top.  Would not make this recipe again.

WOW!! Absolutely amazing. I made a few changes though because I was out of cocoa - I melted 3 squares of unsweetened chocolate then only used 2 tbsp of oil instead of 5 and made cupcakes. Very chocolately and moist. I then made a marshmallow creme frosting, piped it in the center and on top of the cupcake. Definitely going to keep this recipe, very delicious.
