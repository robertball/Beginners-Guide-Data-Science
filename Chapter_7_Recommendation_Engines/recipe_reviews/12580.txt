After altering the recipe a little, (half & half instead of milk & 3/4 cup sugar) this recipe was great tasting and easy to make!

I made it for my mom's 50th Birthday, her favorite kind of pie that she hadn't had in over 30 years... what a challenge this would be, I thought ( I cook... but am not much of a baker...to say the least). What a fabulous outcome! Even made my dad proud !!!!(pie making is a dying art in my family that he has completely mastered... the women who cook and alter recipes tend not to do so well in this department, but this was a real winner!).

I attempted to make this recipe for the first time today and was disappointed with the results.  However, I believe it was more of user error.  I followed all the steps exactly and the pie looked fine going into the oven.  But after 50 minutes and a very brown shell...the pie still had not set.  I used 2% milk which I don't know if this recipe was intended for whole milk.  I will try this again with whole milk to see if this corrects the problem.  Any suggestions?

This pie was wonderful !!! I used sweetened flaked coconut and just 1 cup of sugar because I read other reviews saying this pie was too sweet. I found that 1 cup was the perfect sweetness. I brushed the pie crust around the edges with beaten egg (to result in a "pretty" baked crust) and covered the edges with strips of foil after the first 15 minutes of baking (to prevent over browning). The custard is delicious and so EASY to make. It's very very tasty and I will make this again for sure. Thanks, Lesley !

Really way too sweet, but still good. Just be ABSOLUTLY sure you blend the butter & sugar together BEFORE you add the eggs when making this pie.It comes out wit an odd texture if you add everything at the same time. I made that BIG mistake. It tasted fine, but was weird to eat. I'm sure it would've been awsome if I hadn't -- Truely a great recepie.

This pie is rich and wonderful, just like the ones my grandma used to make.  When she died, all her great recipes went with her. My dad goes crazy for this pie! It's like having a part of her back. Thanks, Lesley!
EDIT - 6 years later and we're still loving it, but I always use a 10-inch crust so to ensure that the pie will set.

I found this pie to be most delicious, and I'm not a coconut fan. I used 1 cup of sugar, and maybe next time I might use heavy cream instead of milk to give the custard a bit more body. All my friends are begging for more!

My entire family is made up of coconut-a-holics, so this pie was a huge hit!  I made two pies for my in-laws, and they loved it so much that they polished one off if less than two days.  My mother-in-law brought the other one to work to share, and apparently everyone raved about the pie, demanding the recipe.  She said we're *required* to bring this pie for all holiday gatherings from now on.  ;-)

Oh, one thing, if you're a coconut freak like us, substitute coconut milk for regular milk.  You will not be disappointed!  Very yummy!

I agree with the last poster. I tried this recipe and it was really sweet. Too sweet. So I tried it again and cut the sugar from 1 1/2 cups to 3/4 of a cup and it came out just right. It is a good recipe and easy. I made the two pies the second time with the sugar cut and eveyone loved it.

I must have done something wrong, because this pie was way too sweet.  I think there is too much sugar in the custard.  I will try it again.  But, my husband and father-in-law loved it!!!

I'm giving this 5 stars after making just a few adjustments, but overall, this is a terrific recipe. I never made coconut custard pie in my life even though it is my favorite, so I had a high standard in my mind of how I hoped it would taste.  I read the other reviews and did cut the sugar amount down to a little over 3/4 of a cup and it was definitely sweet enough; do not use sweetened shredded coconut, that would make it too sweet; I had skim milk so added half and half to make it creamier--3/4 c skim and 1/4 c half and half. I also did 1/2 tsp vanilla and added 1/4 tsp coconut rum which I had in my cupboard; baked it 15 minutes and then covered the edges with foil so the edges do not over cook while the custard sets.  Make sure you follow the order of the ingredients carefully, the first time I made this I added the butter last and it took its toll on its consistency but it still tasted great.  The second time came out perfectly.  I am not a baker by any means, so my family and I were thrilled that it came out so good! And my 13 year old daughter helped me make it--and eat it! A perfect pie for a snowy day...or any day!

I really enjoyed this recipe. My Mother use to make this pie when I was a little girl. She lost the recipe and she says this pie is just like the one she use to make thanks so much for listing the recipe I thought I would never get another taste.

I made this dessert for my husband as coconut custard is his favorite. I used 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup coconut milk. It turned out great! He said it is the best he has had (and he is picky).  I also have made this for friends and now they all say that I have to make this pie anytime we get together. Thank you.

This was really very easy and turned out great. I had my doubts with the other reviews, but it turned out surprisingly yummy.  I used 1/2 cup sugar and sweetened coconut. I also substituted 1/2 cup of coconut milk. Next time I'd use less butter (it was a little greasy).

I read the reviews before making this pie and was a little hesitant about making it. Everyone kept saying the pie was too sweet or too greasy. So, I altered the ingredients. I reduced the butter to 2 tbsps and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. I creamed the butter with the sugar before adding the eggs one at a time. I also added ground cinnamon and fresh nutmeg. It came out great! It was VERY good! This pie will be apart of my Thanksgiving dinner this year. Thanks!

Gorgeous pie...warm or cold, it's the new family favorite. I decreased the sugar to slightly under a cup, (90% of a cup of sugar). I also added a little more coconut (1/4th of a cup) and it turned out perfect. I've tried several coconut pie recipes and this is the best one yet.

I  feel that it uses too much sugar and not enough eggs. It was too sweet. Also, the consistency is more like that of a pecan pie than a custard. It was not done in 40 or 50 minutes.

I'm getting ready to make this for the third time.  It's an amazing and easy recipe just the way it is, but if you think it's too sweet, cut back on the sugar a bit.  I do need to add that I only used two percent milk instead of whole milk the last time I made it.  I couldn't tell a difference.

This was a request, I'm not a fan of coconut, but I'm told it is PERFECTION!

I read the reviews and reduced the Sugar to 1c and changed the milk to half & half.  I also took the advice of others and mixed the ingredients as intended.  Then I added tin foil to the crust after 15 minutes.

As far as setting?  It comes out toothpick clean after 50 minutes but still shifts in the pan, so I let it really set in the fridge overnight.  The recipe should really suggest this.  It was perfect after that and should be chilled.

I just finished mixing another (SO simple & easy) and am licking the bowl myself.  It's delicious.

Some claimed greasy?  I didn't reduce the butter, but I did soften it (leave out or microwave for 10 seconds).  I think the greasy taste may be from lumps that settled, then melted when baking.  Soften and blend til smooth.  This worked for me, not greasy AT ALL, just YUMMY!

I'm going to try this custard recipe and use blueberries or raspberries instead of the coconut.  I think that will be delicious.

I personally did not like this recipe. I took tips from others by reducing the sugar to 3/4cup, using sweet condensed milk and coconut milk instead of regular milk but it was still just too sweet for me. I also feel that it was way to greasy and should have taken someones comment about reducing the butter to 2tbsp. instead of 1/2cup or just not using butter at all. I also feel that it just quite didn't have that authentic custard texture,  should've probably used 3 eggs instead of 2. Overall I feel that it is a simple base recipe to have an idea of what is needed for a coconut custard pie.  I am going just have to play around with it a bit to get this right.

Made this recipe and with a few alterations, this pie was excellent!  Even before reading the reviews, I thought that the amount of sugar was way too much.  I use sweetened flake coconut so using 1 1/2 cups of sugar was not an option for me.  I did take one of the reviewers suggestions and used 3 eggs instead of two.  Two eggs just didn't seem to be enough to make a custard.  I also added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon and nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract.  The pie was perfectly sweet and the almond extract brought the flavor up a notch.  I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  I love coconut custard pie and I will make this recipe again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Most delicious !!!! And that's what everyone replies once they've had a bite.  I didn't add the last of the coconut(topping) I thought there was enough with each mouthful, still I loved this pie.  I ate one all by myself!:)

I've made this pie many times I get so many compliments. I reduced the sugar  to 1 cup because I use sweetened flaked coconut. I also use half and half instead of milk so it's creamier. I sprinkle more coconut on top than the recipe calls for so the coconut flavor is stronger. I also use a deep dish pie crust. It is so easy to make and delicious!

I absolutely loved this pie. My family loved this pie however I did alter the recipe. I used condensed milk I used 3/4 of sugar and Coconut milk and i added nutmeg. It came out so good! I would bake this pie again!

I just made this pie and since some reviews said it was sweet I decreased the sugar to 1 cup I also made it with half & half and I used the coconut flakes that I already had which was sweetened.  This pie was still way to sweet.  I guess I will try it again and just use 1/2 cup of sugar. I would still use the sweetened coconut cause I cant imagine unsweetened.  If this pie wasn't so sweet it would have been delicious.

This pie was way too sweet.  This was my first attempt at making a custard pie but it seemed to take longer then the specified time to get the pie to set.  Next time I will look for a recipe with less sugar.  Maybe I did something wrong since it was my first attempt.

I love coconut custard and I'm always trying to make some version of it. This recipie is great, however my pie always ends up very runny! I'm wondering If  a longer bake time will help... I'm an amateur baker and custards are a bit unfamiliar to me. Any tips?

I loved this recipe but I agreed with a previous baker.  since my coconut was presweetened, I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and the butter to 5 tablespoons. I increased the temp to 400 degrees and since I had cut some of the sugar I baked it in an 8"pie pan instead of a 9"pan.  it turned out great.

I used coconut milk and it added a nicer element if your really into coconut but the fat in coconut seemed to be to much with 1/2 cup of butter.   I'll reduce the butter next time.  I think 1/4 cup would be enough.

Coconut custard pie part 1.

   I put it in the refigerator over night.

 When I went to cut the pie it ran like Niagra falls it never thickened. All so the sugar is much to much.

I liked the taste but it took alot longer to bake and still, after 60+ mins. was a little watery in the middle. I was afraid I'd messed up, but after checking it again, I followed it to the letter. Hope others have better luck with it!

Well, it took a LOT longer than 40 mins to bake this pie. Try more like 2 and 1/2 hours. It was not as creamy and thick as I would think a coconut custard pie should be. IF I try it again, I will use heavy whipping cream instead of milk. I have another recipe for custard, I may use that and just add the coconut. Also, I wouls use less sugar. Way too sweet. Maybe try 3/4 of a cup.

I wish I had read the reviews prior to making. Despite mixing thoroughly the ingredients separated making the consistency totally wrong. Personally speaking it has too much sugar, too much coconut (and i love cocunut) and not enough flour. I will try again with a few changes based on the other reviews. It also was way too dark, maybe should be cooked on a lower setting as it looked almost burnt once it was set.

Good overall taste but too sweet. Next time I drop the sugar to half a cup. How would I change the recipe to get more custard?  If I double the custard ingredients, I’m afraid my crust would be over done.

First ,I cook for a living.I have been a chef for 40 years.I don't do a lot of baking.But I am challenging myself to practice more.I really had trouble with this recipe.I softened the butter,best till light and fluffy.Added sugar slowly,then eggs,then flour,and milk slowly.It turned into a separated mess.Liquid on bottom,butter and sugar floating on top.It really didn't look right.I started over in new bowl.Same thing,but I put it in pie shell anyways.Baked up more like a coconut sugar cookie.I took the first batch (didn't want to waste)
Added flour ,baking powder ,until consistency of cake batter.Baked into coconut cake.Will try another recipe next time.

Used 1/2 c sugar, 1 1/2 c sweetened coconut in the pie, coconut milk instead of milk and additional coconut on top.  AMAZING!!

A “sugar free” coconut pie was requested 3 hrs before my family Christmas dinner. I found this recipe and gave it a try using Splenda. It was a huge success with everyone, including some who don’t normally eat sugar free foods.
The only glitch I had was it was cut before the pie was completely cooled and the first slices were not very neat.
But, the taste compensated for the less than perfect look!

Great recipe. Had to leave it in much longer than requested. I think because mine is a convection oven it takes longer with a lot of recipes. Worked well though. This will be my go to recipe for this pie.

I had a craving for a coconut pie and chose this recipe for its simplicity and ingredients I had on hand. As many suggested I decreased the sugar to 1 cup and increased the coconut to 1-1/2 cups. I baked it for the full 50 minutes but probably should've covered the top with foil for part of the baking time as it browned and the filling was just barely set. Great taste. I will try it again and maybe adjust the baking time.

This is delicious, with a few tweaks, but the 1 1/2 cups sugar  is OUTRAGEOUSLY high.  I made it with 1 cup and it's still too sweet. Like, I-only-had-a-sliver-and-then-I-lapsed-into-a-diabetic-coma sweet.  1/2 cup sugar is plenty.

Ok y’all, I have an old oven that isn’t that great to use. I baked my pie for 40 mins at 350. After it was done, I set it on a rack to cool but it’s little jiggly in the middle. Is that supposed to happen? I never made one before so I don’t know how to tell if it’s done or not. Will the pie set when it cools down?

I made this pie yesterday & it is delicious. I did cut the suger to a little under 1 cup, the butter to a 1/2 stick based on other reviews . I used evaporated milk , a frozen  pie crust , put aluminum foil  on the ridge of the crust & baked at 350 for 40 min. & 300 for 10 min.  Turned out beautiful. Don't know why some others had problems like runny custard. Pie was perfect & a keeper in my recipes!

Like some of the other makers of this pie, I added just 3/4 of a cup of sugar and even that was more than enough.  To reduce the calories, I will half the butter the next time I make this pie. I added an additional egg too. All in all, the pie came out great! I made fresh whipped cream for the top before serving over the warm pie. I will be using this recipe again.

Just made this today. It turned out delicious and is very easy to make,  especially with a bought pie crust. I used butter, approximately 1/3  cup less sugar, unsweetened coconut and 1 % milk. Still outstanding says my personal food taster.

As everyone else has said, wayyyy too sweet and buttery.  I would cut the  sugar and butter in half, use cream or half and half instead of milk, and add an egg.

I made changes only because I realized I was out of whole milk. I had orange flavored milk and it work great. Because of using flavored milk I thought I better use less sugar and only used one cup sugar. I know I subbed a major ingredient...it was delicious! Next time I will follow the recipe but I was pleased with my sub.

This pie turned out way too greasy and did not set in the time frame mentioned.  Not setting could be because of my oven, but when I compare this recipe to some others, the amount of butter does seem excessive, while the amount of eggs and milk may not be enough. Hoping a couple days in the fridge will save it!  Also, keep foil on your crust the entire time, people!

This is the best coconit custard pie I have ever had, even from a restaurant. Not too sweet, just right. I took the advice from another review .... cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and used 1/2 & 1/2 only because I didn't have any milk on hand. Perfect. Making it for the 2nd time this week right now. It will be a new additional to thanksgiving desserts. Hope you enjoy as much as we have.

Adding a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon will make your pie even more delicious. Also, substituting  the milk for carnations evaporated milk or PET milk with give it incredible richness.  Enjoy!

I made this following the directions and didn't change a thing. This pie was horrible.
Way too sweet, odd texture and would never make again. There are too many awesome foolproof recipes for coconut custard pie to waste time changing anything on this one.  Yuk!

This pie turned out really well. I've made it a few times and had great reviews from my family.  I reduced the sugar, added two more egg yolks and used a mix of sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk. It turned out awesome, almost like a flan. Soo good!

I've made this pie three times.  The first for my father's birthday and it was awesome.  The second two times I made it for my daughter's school and both times the filling came out soupy.  I was just about to find a new recipe until I discovered the problem.  The first try was in a glass dish, the second and third were in aluminum pie tins.  I haven't found how to change the baking instructions, but I was given a tip ... put the aluminum pie tin in the glass pie plate to bake it.  Much easier to get in and out of the oven, and the glass should allow for even baking.  Just a thought for those having similar problems.  Oh, and I did also cut the sugar ... we're not fond of overly sweet in our house.

I liked this pie after making some alterations. It is not really a coconut custard pie...it is a coconut pie, with 2 eggs, it is just held together with the help of a ton of butter. Since I was using sweetened coconut, I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup. I used half & half instead of milk, I forgot the flour; but there may have been enough left over on the pie shell. The most important thing: I decreased cooking heat to 300, covered the whole pie with foil and checked it every 30 minutes. In all, I think it took 75 minutes to cook, the last 15, I uncovered it and put it up to 350. It is good, very sweet; but I still think I prefer a more custardy pie with more eggs.

I followed some reviewers' advice and used half and half in place of milk, and only 1 cup of sugar, and I thought it still ended up a little too sweet. But overall it was very tasty. My family enjoyed it.

I made this for Christmas and it got rave reviews from even the most picky of eaters.  This was a huge success! It was very easy to make and required so few ingredients. It has been asked for again and again.

I should have read the comments before I made this.  The consistency of the batter was questionable.  It did not result in a "custard" at all.  More like a very sweet pecan pie.  It tastes good but not what I expected.  I am taking it to a friends home for dessert and had to cut into it to be sure it was edible.  This is NOT the traditional custard.

This recipe is great, however 1 1/2 cups of sugar is way too much.  I reduce to 1 cup and sometimes I use evaporated milk or heavy cream - they both come out excellent. I also use a deep dish pie crust, a regular pie crust would produce two pies for this recipe.

Easiest and yummiest coconut pie!  I made this after midnight one night-- the prep took 10 minutes, and it baked for 40.  It came out perfectly!  It's my dad's favorite so I was really glad to find this recipe.  I used unsweetened coconut, and I only used about 3/4 cup of sugar.  It was still nicely sweet without being overpowering.  I also used condensed milk instead of regular and it was very creamy. Will be making this pie a lot now!

I tried with half the ingredients, for me and my wife (she's not a real fan of sweets) and it was so good. I only used two thirds of the sugar and mixed it with the butter before adding the rest of the ingredients. Two thumbs up! After many disappointments in the kitchen, finally a little bit of encouragement.

This is an excellent pie, very easy and was a big hit with my partner and our dinner guests. I did however cut down the sugar to 1 cup and it was perfect. I am making a couple more for a holiday party this weekend.
