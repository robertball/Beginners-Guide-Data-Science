Very good. I didn't use olive oil since the sausage is greasy enough, and I drained the fat before adding the other ingredients.

I am of Polish descent, and love eating kielbasa! I could eat it with cabbage all the time, but my boyfriend isn't a fan. So, I'm always trying to find some new vessel for the delicious sausage. This was far better than I had dared hope it would be. It seemed such a weird combination, but it definitely works! I'm just not sure that adding the crushed tortillas had much effect. Maybe I made them too small to give the quesadilla any crunch. . . .

Excellent recipe, I did add some onion and a little more Cumin, and I used ground sausage. I didn't have salsa so I added some fresh tomatos and a little tomatoe juice. Thought it needed a sauce so I put a homemade enchilada sauce on it with some grated cheese on top. Husband says its a definate repeat!

This is a good recipe, but of course I did not have all the ingredients and had to improvise.  I cut the sausage into small pieces to help them cook faster.  I did not have salsa so I used stewed tomatoes and added a quarter cup of water, covered and simmered the sausage until done. My tortilla chips were taco shells heated and crunched up.  But we ate every sinful bite. I would make it again because it was tasty without being too hot.
