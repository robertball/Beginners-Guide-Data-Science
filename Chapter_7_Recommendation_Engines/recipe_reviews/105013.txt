While this sounds good, let me tell you how this really should be made.  You should start w/ 3-4 potatoes (peeled or not, your preference), 1 bell pepper, chopped in large chunks, 1 lb sausage, sliced, 2-3 T butter.  Melt butter in deep skillet, add potatoes and pepper, season to taste.  After they have begun to cook, add sausage and cook for about 30 min.  Wow  delish!  Almost exacty like your recipe, but fresh potatoes.  And she's right....it's great!

Great camping breakfast. We pre-cut the onions and pepper and put them in a tupperware. Super easy to make. Great topped with cheddar.

I've made a recipe similar to this for years. I use fresh potatoes also and fry in olive oil with diced onions and I use garlic salt and pepper to taste. I also substitute ground beef and sometimes cut up leftover beef roast and it's amazing. If I can get fresh hungarian wax peppers, i'll add in with the onions and it's awesome.  A lot of variations can be used on this. Wonderful!

This was really good. I rarely follow a recipe to the tee and I pretty much did in this case.

This is a simple and yet easy recipe. I omited the onion and bell pepper in this recipe, only and only because the frozen hash browns I had in the freezer already had them in it. But I did kick it up a little bit with garlic powder when I added salt and pepper. Other then that, it was easy to make. I served it wrapped in small flour tortillas for my kids and added shredded cheese, sour cream and salsa for the ones that wanted theirs deluxe. A super quick addition for those nights you really don't want to go all out and cook a hugh meal, these are filling. I'm make them again.

I make a very similar recipe, but I add red bell peppers instead of green. I also like to use fresh potatoes, and top with fresh chopped parsley. Another way of making sure your potatoes are cooked through is to drop them in boiling water for about 5 minutes, depending on how thick they are cut.

This was very good.  I used turkey smoked sausage and omitted the onion and pepper.  Instead I used onion powder and garlic salt.  I also melted some Cheddar cheese over it at the end.  My picky husband loved it!

I'm trying to figure out what the big deal is here.  Outside of throwing in an onion and bell pepper, you could serve the two main ingredients (sausage/potato) separately, and it would still taste the same. Doesn't seem like there's any mixing of spices or anything here.  Just sausage thrown in with a potato and a little onion and bell pepper.  Good ingredients, but not much of a mix to me.  Actually, if you scramble in an egg or two, you'd have yourself a pretty decent omelette.

Three adults and 5 very picky kids ate their food! Because the cook (me) doesn't like peppers I omitted them. Topped with a couple of eggs overeasy a breakfast(for dinner)made in heaven.

This turned out pretty good, but I did do it a little different. I don't use a nonstick skillet (hate Teflon) so I had to use a little oil. I also used a pound of turkey sausage and a pound of jalapeno venison sausage, cabbage, corn, and no bell pepper or salt. Try adding a little Worcestershire sauce to the sausage. Yummy.

I turned this into a tasty 2-ingredient recipe by substituting JohnsonvilleÂ® Italian Mild Sausage Links for the smoked sausage and used a bag of frozen potatoes which already had the peppers and onions in them.  We gave it a pretty healthy shake of hot sauce to spice it up a bit.  This recipe is a candidate for scrambling a couple eggs into it or topping with a poached egg.

Good meal in a hurry. I browned the sausage in olive oil, added onions and peppers, then added frozen hashed browns, instead of cooking meat separately. I also added some garlic powder and dried parsley along with salt and pepper. Tasty!

This recipe is GREAT!!! I was looking for something different and came accross this. I have already made it twice, and have shared the recipe with many family memebers who also loved it. The only thing I changed (because I am lazy) is that I purchased the hash browns that already have the onion and peppers in it so I didn't have to cut them up. Came out perfect!!! Thank You for sharing this!!!

Why pretty much by the recipe. Used fresh potatoes,  salt/pepper, red bell pepper and parsley.  MY husband and I liked the meal but we found it on the greasy side. Could have been the sausage I used. I cooked in the skillet with minimal olive oil.

I probably shouldn't review this since i didnt exactly follow the recipe but since my husband went nuts and its sooooo easy I figured I'd share.  I though I got the potatoes with the peppers and onions but I didnt.  So I just browned the sausage in a large skillet with a little pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  Removed it from the pan, added a splash of oil, browned the potatoes, then added the sausage back in.  I figured Id just steam some veggies to serve with it since it was missing the peppers and onions.  My husband loved it with a little hot sauce on top.  Never have I gotten such a good response from something soo quick and easy.  A go to meal for a busy night.

I would give this five stars, except that I altered it quite a bit. I used fresh red potatoes with the skins on, green AND red bell peppers, only half of a large white onion, and added half a can of corn. This alters the cook time, but if you chop the potatoes thin enough, not by much. My whole family loves this, even my picky husband and 15 month old!

I've made this many times using the original recipe and it always turns out great. Last night, I didn't have the bell pepper, so I used extra onions instead and I didn't have the frozen potatoes, so I used fresh potatoes instead. The frozen potatoes seem to hold up better to the cooking. Next time, I think I will stick to the original recipe.

I'm not a huge fan of sausage, but hubby is.  So, I find recipes to use sausage and not just the main ingredient.  This was very tasty and one pan dish to boot.  I made the recipe with just one addition, I added an over easy egg and it was delish!

Since I used turkey sausage, which leaves little grease, I added about 2 tablespoons of butter to cook the onion and green pepper in, and another 2 tablespoons for the potatoes. Used seasoned (salt-free) pepper. Because of the butter and sausage, I didn't add any salt. And I thought it was yummy--warm and filling and fast. We have smoked sausage slices mixed with mac & cheese a lot; this was a happy change.

Yeah, that's the ticket.  You get home from work late, and you want something home cooked. The frozen hash browns make it fast, bell peppers and onions give it a little kick, and th ed smoked turkey sausage gave it flavor. The grandkids ate it up and so did we. Some of us added Sriracha sauce, some wanted catsup, I ate mine straight up.  Now off to the easy chair! I'll work hard on a recipe on the weekends!

My husband and I made it but I made a few changes and absolutely loved it. I put it in a large taco shell and added lots of cheese then grilled it. It was a wonderful change.

I used thawed plain hash browns(shredded),and frozen mixed peppers. I cooked the peppers and onions in olive oil for about 7 minutes, added the sausage and cooked for another 5 minutes on high. L

This was so easy and good.  I used Simply Potatoes- Garlic & Herb Hashbrowns.  I did have to add some evoo while browning the potatoes and it did take a little longer to cook than stated but still a quick dish.  Next time I'll make for breakfast and add some cheese and eggs on top, yum.

Great one skillet meal.  I browned the sausage along with a red chili to add spice to the mix followed by the green pepper& onion.  I also tossed in part of a red pepper to add color to the mix. I used potato wedges and garlic then added everything back to the skillet.  My husband had a clean plate & I thought it was a quick tasty meal as well.

Very simple with items I have on hand. I used regular potatoes and added garlic salt instead.

This was ok, nothing spectacular but something different.  I did end up adding some cayenne pepper and oregano to add some flavor as I thought it was a bit bland.  Might make again and play with it to suit our tastes.

This was a good recipe but needed a little more spice. I added basil, a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, and fresh ground pepper. You have to cook frozen hash browns longer than 5 minutes, but I topped it with diced tomatoes after cooking and it's definately something I'll make again.

Very tasty! I tried a mild flavored smoked sausage and it turned out very well. I also added scrambled eggs at the end for a different texture and taste.

This sounded like it would be really good, but it was too greasy. It might work better with something like a low-sodium turkey sausage. Disappointing.

Add some diced, seeded tomatoes just before serving...be sure to squeeze them well so they don't add a lot of juice to the pan.
