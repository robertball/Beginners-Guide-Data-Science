I missed the garlic in this recipe and had to add it after tasting the marinade.  Much better.  As I didn't want to heat up the house.  (90 degrees here today), I elected to barbeque them.  No leftovers which is always a sign of a successful recipe.  Served with Sesame Udon Noodles and Fried Broccoli both from AR.  Thanks Chef John!

This Teriyaki is pretty good but would be even better with a couple of cloves of minced garlic.  I would double or triple the ginger too.  Broiling worked well, I used Reynold's non stick foil (love that stuff) but I think actually grilling the chicken would have been even better.  Chicken thighs are pretty thin and cook really fast.  I didn't get the 'finish' I would have liked using the broiler.  Grilling over direct heat and glazing the entire time would have been easier and produced a better glazed finish to the chicken without over cooking it.

I followed the directions exactly (except, like another reviewer Baking Nana, I added garlic and extra ginger), and the chicken came out amazing. I got a great char on the chicken with the broiler set at 500 F and the chicken on the top rack. The flavor of the teriyaki sauce was on point. It was better than takeout teriyaki.

I tried this last night. My n-laws were in town so I wanted to cook something tasty.  I wanted to cook something similar to Yakitori which is Japanese dish.  If you would put small bite size of chickens and good size of green onion chunks and put them in a skewer alternately and then glaze and cook them. I'm sure that would be a hit.

I always read a few reviews before I make something, so I added garlic and increased the ginger as one reviewer suggested, because I love garlic and I find that most recipes need more spice than called for (at least for my taste).  We all loved it!  My husband grilled the chicken outside and it got nice and crispy on the outside but was juicy inside.

My family said it was good, but not worth making again.  I substituted the sake + mirin alchol for homemade white wine.

So good!  I used a bottle of teriyaki sauce I had in the pantry, added crushed garlic and Ginger.  I had a fresh pineapple so I added it to the pan for the last half of the cooking, basting it along with the chicken thighs. So juicy and flavourful. Another great recipe.  Thanks Chef.

An excellent recipe. My family went back for seconda.

Broiling 6-inches from the element ensures the chicken doesn't dry out.

This an an awesome recipe and my husband and son love it. Definitely a keeper in my house. I changed a couple things...I only cook 4 pieces of bone in chicken thighs, I wash and skin them myself, however, I still use the full teriyaki sauce recipe.(Iâ€™m a gravy girl and love extra sauce to put on my rice and chicken.)

Made as stated except added a tablespoon of minced garlic, was really good. Will make again but increase the marinated time to at least 2 hours.

Donâ€™t know. Marinaded it for at least 2 hours but still didnâ€™t taste much. BLAH. I wonâ€™t make again and way too much time attending to it under broiler in order to turn regularly and baste. Wouldnâ€™t spend that much ever again.  Sorry

Made this using Salmon fillets instead of chicken. 
Wasn't sure how that taste would go with the fish, but nothing ventured...Addedd garlic n ginger as others have suggested. No Mirrin, so used white wine and a good shot of Chambord liqueur. Excellent recipe. My wife absolutely loved it. (Always the acid test!) Would definitely use again.  Would like to try it with chicken on the BBQ.

Chef John produces another delight in the kitchen!  I made this with a little hesitation because of the sake and mirin, not being an alcohol lover in any way.  Instead of being smothered with the taste of spirits, I found the end result to be sweet and very satisfying.  This made some of the most tender chicken I've produced in a while and my family raved about it.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and the dark green onions were a wonderful finishing touch.  Very, very happy family who love Asian food!

I did try this recipe a couple of days ago. I did not have any Mirin so I used Seasoned Rice Wine Vinegar and added some sugar to sweeten it up. I also added garlic to the marinade. My thighs marinated for approximately 1.5 hours before putting under the broiler. I found the broiler time took longer than the recipe quoted and I eventually moved my top rack closer to the heat source. My 2 1/2 year old and 5 year old granddaughters loved this meal. I served it over brown basmati rice with a side of broccoli. All in all a very good recipe and I will make this again... Thanks Chef!

Pretty time consuming.  Also, buying a special ingredient like sake and the cost associated with that didn't make me feel the result was worth the extra effort and cost. (And I substituted sherry which I had on hand for the mirin because couldn't find it). My 11-year old son did like it though; and he'd never really had dark meat chicken at home before and is sensitive to new meals.

I added some garlic and more ginger as others have suggested. I probably didn't need quite as much ginger as I used, but it was so good (on its own) that I could have drank it.

I added rice vinegar to marinate the chicken for about 30 mins and rinsing off before adding the teriyaki marinade.  I am sensitive to smell from meat and vinegar helps to rid of them.  The chicken turns out well and juicy.
