Loved this recipe! Tasted great. Made it as a birthday dinner for my wife who likes scallops. I used bay scallops instead of the full-sized guys, so the initial "searing" was more of a bubbling and reduction, but I moved onto the next step quickly to avoid the meat getting overcooked.

I substituted half & half for the heavy cream, just because it was what I had on hand. Just made it a little runnier, but the kids liked it a lot, even at the age where they're picky about everything.

Wow, was this delicious!  I didn't have sherry, so I used a good sweet white wine instead.  It was a good substitute, but I can't wait to try it with sherry!  An easy recipe that will be a regular in our house. Thx. Chef!

Simple and delicious!  Used a white wine instead of  sherry  and thin spaghetti - pasta water came in handy to  add more  moisture as it continues to soak up the sauce.  Also used cheapo parmesan  cheese.  Husband loved it and said it was excellent the next day for lunch.  Nice addition to our seafood meals - Thanks John!

We liked this a lot, but it was just a touch too lemony. Perhaps the lemon I used produced more juice than Chef John intended. As with all recipes, it would be so helpful if measurements were provided, ie how many tsps or tablespoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice, rather than the ambiguous juice of one lemon.

5 stars with alterations.  Used sake instead of sherry (personal preference, I don't care for the taste of sherry)  and reduced the cream to 1/3 cup and lemon to 1/2 lemon.  There was plenty of sauce still.

Wonderful flavor! I used small bay shrimp instead of scallops (only because that is what was freshest), and it was delish! If using shrimp, don't place the heat on high. Shrimp cook very quickly. I generally cook shrimp on M-MH, watching until they are no longer opaque. If you don't have sherry, I recommend a crisp, citrus forward dry white white, such as Matua Sauvignon Blanc.

This is my first time making this recipe so I made it as printed. I don't think I'd change a thing. Great flavor from the scallops. The lemon zest and parsley add a light note to the over all flavor. YUM

I read the reviews and decided to only add juice from half the lemon. I think it was perfect. It had a light, lemon-y flavor and the other flavors were not over powered. I will definitely make this again!

Soooo good. Entire family loved it. Doubled the recipe for leftovers... can't wait to eat it again for lunch!!

My only minor issue was that my scallops ended up producing a lot of liquid, which I tried to drain, but they basically stewed instead of fried so consequently did not brown... likely because I used frozen. I'll have to try it with fresh next time. It still turned out delicious though! Thanks Chef John!

Since I’m on keto I made mine with zoodles and topped it with this creamy yummyness! I made my husbands and daughters as written and it was absolutely out of this world. My picky five-year-old did not leave a morsel.

OMG!! Loved this dish!! I made this for my husband & I for dinner tonight (made the kids a separate dinner :) and we raved about it so much i ended up having to share some of mine with them.  I followed the recipe to the T and could kick myself for not making more! A quick meal which packs big flavors do not omit the sherry! DEFINITELY will make this again thank you yet again Chef John!

This dish is a regular in our house. Once you’ve made it a few times you can prep the sauce while the pasta is cooking, making it a very quick but special meal.

Amazing flavor!! We used a crisp Sauvignon blanc instead of sherry and added a few cloves more garlic. The lemon flavor and crisp wine... it was light and so scrumptious! Our new favorite pasta!

Tasty, but the lemon completely overpowered the delicate flavor of the scallops.

My husband who usually is quite picky when it comes to new dishes, loved this. I did as well. The sauce didn't thicken up as much as I would have liked but it might have been because I didn't let the alcohol from the sherry burn off enough.  All in all, the garlic, sherry, butter and cheeses made it very tasteful. I will definitely make this again.

This is definitely going in the recipe book. First time cooking scallops and it was a hit. Things I did differently:

1. Only used a little lemon juice and omitted the rind (come on guys you know your taste better than Chef John. If you don’t like a heck of a lot of lemon reduce it)

2. Used sea scallops instead of bay scallops

3. Added more seasoning to scallops before searing the first side i.e. onion and garlic powder, Hungarian spicy paprika, accent and a small sprinkle of cumin

4. Added spinach towards the end to make it more visually appealing while adding a veggie to meal

5. Used half n half instead of heavy cream (what I had on hand. Just add more cheese to thicken if needed)

Excellent recipe! Of course I had to tweak it. Added mushrooms and roasted red peppers to the butter and oil. Removed the scallops and put them back in with the pasta. Yum!

I substituted the scallops with shrimp since my husband doesn't like scallops. I also couldn't find dry sherry at my store so I used a Pinot Grigio instead, it turned out delicious! I read some people thought it was a little too much lemon so I only used half of a lemon juiced and it was the perfect amount for us. I'm sure if you made this with the dry sherry it would be just as good too! Chef John's recipes don't disappoint, at least they haven't yet for me.

I'm always amused by people who complain when others review a recipe after making changes to the original.  COME ON, PEOPLE!!  Use your imagination.  A recipe is nothing more than a guide.  There are lots of times when,  out of necessity, due to lack of ingredients, or just personal preference, changes can easily be made, and it doesn't take away from the intent of the original recipe.  Here is one such example.  I didn't have Bay Scallops, but I DID have some frozen Sea Scallops in a big bag from Costco.  I simply used them and cut them in quarters.  I didn't have heavy cream handy, so I used milk.  These were minor changes and didn't detract from my hero, Chef John's, recipe.  I'm sure I used more garlic and basil than he called for (probably more sherry, too!) The result was fantastic.  If you like scallops and pasta, this is one you just can't mess up.  It's THAT easy . . . and GOOD!!

This was awesome.  My husband said he would pay for it in a restaurant.  I used white wine instead of sherry, and loosely measured everything else (meaning I probably doubled the butter).  I didn’t have a lemon so just used lemon juice and based on other reviewers didn’t go too crazy (a couple of squirts).  Used coffee cream as that was what I had on hand.  Loved the spice, and how simple this was.  Will definitely be making again!

Maybe a little bit less lemon zest and juice but otherwise gorgeous!  Made with brown rice spaghetti and still turned out lovely.  Will make again.  :)

Fabulous! Entertained several with this dish...all were in awe at how the taste  was extraordinary! Wish I had used sea scallops instead of bay, I think the flavor would have been much better. All in all very good!

Delicious!  Was out of garlic cloves so I substituted 1/4 tsp. garlic powder; didn't have a full 2 tsp. of lemon rind so added a couple drops of doTERRA lemon essential oil.

For someone that doesn't really care for Italian food, this was great.  Made exactly per recipe. We had some left over and had it the next night, still great!  Will definitely make again. Thanks Chef John.

One of the best dishes I have ever made with bay scallops. My whole family (kids and all) were groaning with delight. Comes together quick, so have everything chopped, measured and ready to go once the scallops hit the pan.
Also, b/c we love scallops, I doubled the amount (I get them in a 2 lb. bag), but left all other proportions exactly as listed. Wouldn't change a thing. Served with crisp-tender asparagus.

Delicious!  But scallops way over done.  Next time I will do a quick sauté on the scallops then remove them.  I’ll make the sauce then add the scallops back in with the pasta!  A little more spice wouldn’t hurt!  Quick and easy once you get it all organized and ready to go.

Really good. Might use white wine next time instead of rich Sherry since bay scallops are so rich. Also added a small bit bay seasoning.

Loved this recipe!  I made it a little spicier, adding a light coating of white pepper to the scallops and i increased the crushed red pepper.  Very flavorful.  I plan to replicate for my son using chicken vs. scallops because he won't eat scallops.

This recipe was awesome.  I added chopped spinach at the same time as the parsely.  I used red wine instead of sherry, only because I didn’t have any sherry handy.   The meal had to be the most delicious meal ever! Thanks!

I made this dish and it was delicious. I didn’t use scallops though. I made the recipe starting with melting the butter and adding the garlic and then added shrimp at the end. Everything else I did the same and it was very tasty. Will make this dish again. Would make it for company.

Excellent! Quick and easy. 
I only made few changes, using coconut oil, reduced bay scallops in half replacing with handful of cauliflower bits. Had no cheese but still tasted great. Plan to make again!

Our local Whole Foods didn't have bay, we used sea scallops, we sliced and diced a little. Wife loves scallops, she was quite pleased with the meal! Personally, I would have added a pinch of cayenne.

Doubled the garlic, which is never a bad idea.  Overall tasted like a restaurant, one dirty pan, and super easy.

Loved this dish.  Not a fan of fat spaghetti so I used bow ties and it turned out great.  Will definitely make again.
