This is wonderful and refreshing, be sure however to buy a fresh bag. of coconut flakes and not a bag from the pantry, my half bag was only in there for about a month but the flavor was already fading away so I ran out and bought a new bag....big difference! Same with the mint.  This recipe served 4 adults, along with ribs and a potato dish, I'm not sure how this recipe donor got 15 servings?  Anyway, it's very good and very colorful. Thanks for posting it.

Doesn't get much easier than this.,,equal portions of fruit and coconut.  The coconut really adds another layer of flavor to what, otherwise, simply would be a fruit salad.  Enjoyed for breakfast today, tasty!
