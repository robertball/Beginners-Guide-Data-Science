I used only half the amount of soy sauce,and thought it tasted just fine. It was a bit difficult to taste the lime,though.

I used fresh squeezed limes, lime chunks, and lime skins in the marinade and it was really lime-y. Yum!

WOW!  Incredible.  I changed this recipe a bit, and used chicken breasts with skin and ribs.  I marinated for about an hour, and then baked the chicken at 375 for about an hour, basting several times during cooking uncovered.  Served with roasted potatoes and spicy green beans - yum!

I marinated it all day to be ready at night.  Awesome!  Also added some mushrooms.  No leftovers.  It's a keeper

such a tasty marinade!  I would definitely use low-sodium soy sauce next time (maybe a little less, too) and add more lime.   The family loved it!

I used this recipe to make a stir-fry.  It was fabulous!  I used onion, celery, carrots, yellow, red, orange peppers, snow peas, broccoli, and green zucchini.  I first cooked the chicken, removed it from the pan, and placed the cooked chicken in the sauce to marinate.  I then cooked the veggies, re-added the cooked chicken in sauce, simmered for about 5 minutes. Next, I added cooked pasta and let it all simmer an additional 5 minutes.  I served it sprinkled with parmesan and pepper to taste!  Fabulous!   I guess I could call it “Lime Garlic Chicken Parmesan Stir-fry”!  Thanks for the amazing sauce!

this recipe was very easy and very tasty. i added a third clove of garlic and doubled the lime juice because i had read in other reviews that it was hard to taste the lime with only 1/4 c. i would definitely make it again.

I would have liked to taste the lime a little more in this recipe.  It was moist, but didn't really "stand out" as a superb marinade, maybe boosting the flavor with the lime juice plus the zest would help.

I was really excited about this recipe because I love lime, but it was not good.  I would not recommend it.

I tried the suggestion of doubling the lime juice and it made the taste so strong it hard to eat. I also cooked it about two minutes longer than the recipe says and it still wasn't done in the middle. Don't think I will try it again in the future.

This recipe is average. I used chicken breast tenders. I used 1.5 limes squeezed for marinade. And marinated for 4 hours. It had a nice lime flavor. 
I liked it better cold the next day. On top of a salad or quick lunch. This is a good recipe when you don't feel like cooking or doing minimal preparation.

The whole family enjoyed it. I added more garlic and cooked the chicken in the marinade, as opposed to discarding it as the recipe states, and it was absolutely wonderful!

This was good, but the garlic flavour wasn't strong enough for me. Mostly I could taste lime. My husband really liked it. I might make it again, but I would add more garlic & maybe some spices.

This was a good recipe, but seemed very strong to me- i don't know if i had bad garlic or what, but otherwise, it was tasty.  i'll have to try it again and see.  my roommate loved it though!
