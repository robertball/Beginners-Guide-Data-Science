This recipe was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and didn't change a thing, and it came out perfect. It was very easy and great flavor. I ate it as a main course with crusty bread, as suggested, and my husband loved it as well. A keeper!

I thought this was devine except I would use more than 1 tablespoon olive oil I just poured it in by eye, and we LOVE the floavor of EVOO so- that would be my only suggestion, therwise I followed this to a T and it was a delishious side to our roasted chicken and white wine :)

I made this for me and my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it.  He said it was good but a little strange.  However, he went back for seconds.  I didn't measure out the onion (I used about a quarter of a small red onion) and used jarred minced garlic.  I wish I used fresh garlic.  All in all it is a tasty dish.

MMMM, delicious. I added a bit of turmeric and basil, and it was great with the buttered fettucine and pork chops. Great stuff! Easy, too.

Made this with red bell peppers as hubby does not like the green ones. He said that this was not as flavorful as he thought that it would be but then I did make this in February.  I will try again in the summer with better tomatoes and see how he likes it.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

You have to add some of the spices you want to make it something tasty. This is a great base recipe but it should not be a final. I added seasoning salt and your definitely going to want to add more red onion and garlic.

I was searching for a bell pepper salad when I came across this recipe. Also, I've been tinkering with incorporating more fruit into my hot dishes. 

With this recipe I added 1/2 C sliced Red Delicious Apple - peeled during the onion sautee step, and adjusted some measurements: 1/2 C red onion, 3 T red onion, and 1 orange - 1 red - 1 yellow green pepper. 
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
We happened to be having grilled brats with German pickle spears and Horseradish Mustard for dinner. This dish complemented it very nicely, though next time I will use  crunchy deli chips or toasted Lavash. I grilled tortillas and found them too flimsy and doughy.
And, finally, the Flafla was wonderful ON THE BRATS!! I wonderful year-round alternative for folks that do not care for sauer kraut.
P.S. This dish is LOADED with Vitamins C and D!
