I was looking for a small sponge cake that would be quick and easy and this was it.  I skipped the topping, added about 1/2 tsp vanilla and instead served it with strawberries and whipped cream.  Imagine a Twinkie with no chemical taste, fresher and more tender...that's the effect I got.  Be sure to mix with a whisk attachment if you have and mix very well as air is the primary leavening here.

I made the cake, not the topping, and it was just what I was after - just a basic, old-fashioned sponge cake.  I used the batter to make individual sponge cake shells for strawberry shortcake. The cakes were light, tender, airy and perfect to absorb those sweet strawberry (mixed with a little Chambord) juices.

Mmmm, this cake turned out moist, fluffy, and delicious. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of salt.

I wish there were words to describe how absolutely wonderful this cake is. The only thing I did differently was to make 1-1/2 batches and put it in an 8" x 11.5" pan and cooked for 23-25 minutes. It has a great texture, not too dry, not too crumbly, not too spongy, just perfect. I did not make the topping but used as strawberry shortcake, granted the strawberries have been put away awhile and I still cannot stop eating this cake with nothing on it. The only thing I would suggest is to make when the kids are playing.....my 2-1/2 year old thought that the 4 minute and 5 minute beating times were just way too long. :)  Will be making again (maybe even in the next couple of days). Thanks for the great recipe. I will never make shortcakes for my strawberries again.

I have made this several times and enjoy it with fruit topping and whipped cream.  The sponge cake is much lighter and tastier than normal shortcake.  Great fast, easy.  I bake it in a 8X8 square pan.  Wonderful treat without tons of calories!  Thanks Sandra!!!!

This cake has been our family's "birthday cake" as long as I can remember (& I am 68 years old). It originally came from my grandmother or great-grandmother (can't remember which). Although this recipe calls for it to have a broiled topping & many folks here have indicated that they use it as a strawberry shortcake, in our family we frost it with a fudge frosting (the kind that hardens like "fudge"). It is a simple but amazingly delicious cake!! The only thing that I will tell anyone looking to make this is to be sure to beat the eggs the full 4+ minutes and to SLOWLY add the sugar, beating another 4+ minutes (in my experience, the slow incorporating of the sugar takes at least 6-8 minutes). For the rest, don't overmix the flour into the eggs, mix just until combined and the same with the milk & butter. Be gentle with this and you will have a devine cake!! Oh, I do add a teaspoon of vanilla extract as well. If I'm making this for a "crowd", I double it and make it in a 9x13 baking dish.

I made this recipe as a part of an attempt to replicate a cake made at a local Italian bakery - A light, fluffy cake with fresh strawberry, peach, and whipped cream filling, and frosted with a not-sickly-sweet frosting (I used homemade whipped cream). I doubled the recipe to have enough to make two layers about 1 1/2 - 2 inches thick. 

While this cake was tasty, it did not quite fulfill my "light and fluffy" hopes. If I were to make this again, I think think I would separate the eggs from the yolks and maybe add a little lemon zest for a "brighter" flavor. Also, this cake took about 40 minutes to bake in a convection oven.

I did not make the coconut topping to go on this.  I made these my mini Bundt pan, and then we topped them with whipped cream and strawberries.  Made for a delicious and very light dessert, especially because of the very low amount of butter in the cake.

Great Recipe! Really moist and flavorful and very easy to change to situations. I made it for my mom's job's party and they all loved it and even asked to keep it so the people who weren't their could try it. I didn't have the right size pan so I used a pie plate (Strange, I know) and I replaces coconut and walnuts with Almonds.

YUM! Let is be said I am not the best baker, this is actually the first time I've ever baked a cake-- IT WAS SO GOOD! Better than any bake mix I've ever used. This was so easy, too! I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, "light" butter and added a pinch of salt. I only used 1 tablespoon of milk for the topping and omitted the nuts. The cake was light and fuffy and moist! This is a keeper!

Great low fat dessert! And a very forgiving recipe. I've never made sponge cake before and my 4 year old was helping me "throw" everything in. So I missed the part about beating the sugar into the eggs first...oops. Everything still turned out just great and we all enjoyed our dessert with strawberries :) Thank you for sharing!

Good! But a little dense, even though I beat the eggs and sugar for a total for 8mins (4mins just eggs, 4mins after adding sugar). Maybe 10mins of beating will help? I reduced the sugar in the cake to 3/4 cup and didn't make the frosting, it was already sweet and sticky enough. Added 1/2 tsp salt and vanilla to batter. I think I'd use more baking powder next time... 1.5tsp perhaps.

I didn't use the topping recipe, but instead turned this into the BEST strawberry shortcake recipe ever! Baked it in a 9-inch round pan, sliced it horizontally, filled with sugared strawberries and freshly whipped cream, and topped with the same, and it was gone within minutes!  Thanks so very much, as I'm not so much of a baker, but this was incredibly easy and delicious.

This cake turned out great, and I am notoriously BAD at making cake (they fall and other bad cake tricks). 5 stars for this one because it did not fail me. I followed the directions for the cake, only adding a tsp of vanilla to the listed ingredients. I did not add the topping, used a strawberry sauce - this was just the thing for strawberry shortcake type dessert. One trick for sure is don't get that milk and butter too hot or it might curdle the egg mixture. I actually might do that step after beating the eggs but before adding the flour/baking powder to give it time to cool down somewhat. Great cake!

I want to say that I'm a total klutz when it comes to cooking. Even then this recipe turned out beautifully! I varied it a little by adding some pineapple extract and essence to the batter! Thank you so much for sharing this!

I made this just as written, with the walnut and coconut topping - love it!  I'm not that great a cook, but it came out just like I'd want. Its indeed easy, and especially so when I use the stand mixer and a timer for the eggs and sugar.  The cake has an airy texture and no overpowering sweetness.  The broiled brown sugar, walnut, and coconut topping adds crunch and more flavor.  I can see how this cake would be a great base for other fruit toppings.  I will keep it on hand for sure!

Yummy! Followed the recipe to the "T". Only change i made was to leave the walnuts out since my mom doesn't like them. The topping really gave the cake a nice crunchy top, while the sponge was moist and fluffy. Thanks Zookie!

Tastes really pretty good, but not the same kind of really fluffy spongy sponge cake that's leavened with egg white... Made it twice, and both time had bits of unmoistened flour in the end... maybe it's because I am beater with a fork instead of a beater ?... but I didn't have this problem with any other non-egg-white type cake...   Also the batter wasn't a whole lot in terms of volume... so poured into an 6"x9" pan instead of the 9"x9" suggested... and the thickness of the finished product was only 1"-1.25"... I personally don't want a cake with the height of brownies... so would probably double the cake part of it to bake in an 8"x8" if I was entertaining...   Made it once with 2 Tb of cocoa like someone suggested, plus 2 Tb of instant coffee granule... (without the topping)... the flavour turns out OK, but not spectacular... If I was looking for a mocha cake would probably go for a chiffon recipe instead...   Anyway, the coconut topping is really my favorite... This is a very good old fashioned snacking cake... home-made style... not exactly elegant but definitely hearty and homey... Makes great comfort food to go with coffee when you're pulling an all-nighter... Will make again... if for nothing else, surely for the coconut topping !!

This was simple to make and turned out very good.  I used it in a trifle instead of pound cake.  It is also good for snacking.

This recipe never fails.  I have made it so many times and it always turns out well.  I use this cake for strawberry shortcake.  My mom requests to for her birthday to go with fresh strawberries from the garden.  It is so simple and easy and versatile with fruit toppings. Love it!

I did not like this cake.  The frosting is too rich and too sweet.  The cake was just okay though I may try the cake recipe again.  For sure not the topping. I do not recommend this recipe.

I used this cake to make a strawberry shortcake. Although it was easy to make, the cake was a little on the dry side. However, the juice from the strawberry sauce remedied that.

This came out really well made this without the topping to use as a base in a caribbean icebox cake. As another reviewer in a similar recipe advised I did beat the eggs for four minutes.

It's an average cake.  Doesn't have the aroma of other cakes so it feels a bit bland and flat.  The cake is not dry but not as moist and soft as what I'm used to.  Second time I made it, I added vanilla.  I put the mixer on whip instead of beat setting and it made it a bit softer. It was still not the texture I was hoping for.

EXCELLENT cake!!  I didn't make the topping, only the cake and topped it with whipped cream and strawberries to make a strawberry shortcake-like dessert.  My guests loved this cake and everyone had seconds.  Be sure to use a whisk attachment and beat for as long as the directions say!

I made the cake without the topping (I plan to use it in a trifle) and it came out as promised, light and fluffy.  I baked it for exactly 20 minutes and it was a tad overdone, so keep an eye on it.

It wasn't as spongy as I was expecting.  The flavor was good.  We found it to be slightly dry.  But we made it for my daughter's birthday (at her request for strawberry sponge cake) and put whipped cream and strawberries on top, and it was pretty good.  Next time we'll have to try it with the broiled coconut topping, which sounds delicious.

My son claims this is the best homemade cake I've done so far. Mind you, he'll eat anything that doesn't have nuts. I followed the recipe as it was given*. I did forget to add vanilla extract as some other users suggested. I also didn't have enough white sugar to make a complete cup so I added abt 1/2 tbsp of brown sugar to make up. The result was a soft sugar taste which is fine when you can add sweet toppings. I'm gonna try this in blueberry, chocolate  & lemon flavors. Can't wait!

I love this cake. So easy. Read the reviews  and learned  it was OK to make changes. The changes were to double  it and put a dark chocolate frosting . Super moist and delicious. Made a great birthday cake.

This was a great, simple cake with ingredients I always have on hand.  Did not add the full amount of sugar, and did not make the coconut topping. I beat the eggs for a total of 8 minutes.  I have made this twice already for strawberry shortcake, and it is wonderful!

This is such a great recipe for those little sponge cakes you usually find in the grocery store for strawberry shortcakes! A very simple and easy recipe. Careful not to over mix once you add the flour to maintain a light and airy batter. Also sifting the flour/baking powder is very important. I made quite a few mini cake in a shortcake mould. Bake a little less time and grease your mould really well because I found they have a tendency to stick even when I thought I had sprayed the pan well with Pam.

Great with fresh strawberries and real whip cream. I was only looking for the cake, not the topping so I didn't make that part.
I heated the milk and butter in the microwave instead of a saucepan and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. salt.

I cannot ask for a better recipe than this one. Honestly, this was easy to make and tasted great. As long as you follow the instructions, it will come out perfect. I baked it in a toaster oven, and it makes no difference. I would recommend this to a friend and continue to use this recipe.

This cake was pretty good. Good texture and just sweet enough. I did not use the topping, but added some almond extract and a pinch of salt. Be warned....I set my timer for 20 minutes and the cake was overdone!! I would check it around 18 minutes!! Other than that this is a good cake.

awesome!  I was skeptical, but I wanted a cake that i could make with a cream and this was perfect.  I didn't put on the topping, but I doubled the batch for the cake and covered each layer with pureed mango and frosted with homemade whip cream.  I called it a mango twinkie cake.  Fantastic!  Thank you

This is a very good and simple recipe. A bit of work but worth it. I did not use the nuts or coconut. And made the topping a little differently. I melted it all in a sauce pan like the sauce for bananas foster and poured on top while stil warm. Excellent!

This was really good!I used the cake as a base for strawberry shortcake and I didn't do the whole coconut broiling thing. It was the perfect, spongey and delicious, cake that I was hoping for!Thanks much:)

So I decided to try this recipe as my first with Splenda. I'm not sure if it was the Splenda or the recipe, but overall, I didn't care for this. It burnt on top and didn't bake on the bottom even though it was on a lower rack. It had an aftertaste that I suspect was the Splenda. I had high hopes for this sponge cake. I'll try it again sometime with real sugar and we'll see what happens

I baked a cake for the first time in my life this christmas! ... And surprisingly it turned out quite well.  The only problem in it was ... it didn't fluff up.  When I consulted one of my friends, she suggested I ferment it for about 5 hours before actually baking the cake.  However, there is no mention in the recipe for the same.  Can anyone help me out? ... Should I leave the cake for fermentation before baking it?

I thought this cake came out tasting like it had a tad too much flour, and the cake itself wasn't as sweet as I was expecting it to be (minus the topping).  Perhaps I made the cake wrong.  The things I liked about this cake were the ease, simplicity of ingredients, and of course it didn't take long to put together.  The brown sugar topping was great but I omitted the coconut, as I am not a fan.   I would definitely make this cake again, but I will be increasing the amount of sugar I use in the batter (to 1 1/4 cups) and decreasing the amount of flour (to 3/4 cups).  Overall, a keeper recipe, but slightly modified for my tastes.  Thanks, Sandra!  :)

I really appreciate your posting this recipe; my grandma used to make it, and when we lost her, I thought I'd lost hot milk sponge cake forever! It was always my favorite thing she made for us, and I particularly appreciate the time indications you put in here--good job, and thank you so much!
