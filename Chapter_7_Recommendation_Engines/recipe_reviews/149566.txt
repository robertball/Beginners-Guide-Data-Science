This rating is based on changes I made to the recipe, not the recipe as written. I cooked the bacon first, then removed from pan and drained most of the fat. I left about 1 T of fat to cook veggies in instead of butter. I reduced the diced tomatoes to only 1 C. Used 1.5 lbs of lean ground beef and omitted the veal and sausage. Mixed the cooked bacon in with the meat along with the egg and condiments. I reduced the spicy mustard to 1 T only because I ran out.   Next time I make this, i will not bake the glaze on,  I will use it as a sauce on top when serving. The sauce is yummy and I wish it was more evenly disbursed over the meat. Also, the sauce made draining the fat off the meatloaf difficult. Every time I tipped the pan to drain the fat, sauce would fall off and splatter, making a huge mess.

awesome, better without the veal or the egg, also need to make sure the meats are extra lean...

I didn't use veal (just regular beef and italian sausage) or Worcestershire sauce, so my review is somewhat inexact. 

Reasons for three stars:
* meatloaf came out too loose, I'd like it a bit firmer
* cook time is too long - it turned out a bit on the dry side
* it ended up with too much fat drippings - you HAVE TO use very lean meat, my oven was smoking toward the end of cook time
* 3 tablespoons of mustard gave it "too much mustard" taste

My man loves meat loaf but he was not real enthusiastic about this recipe. Like the other reviews it was too loose and greasy. I liked the taste but I am big on presentation and a meatloaf that is not firm does not present well.  The kitchen smelled great but the meatloaf could not live up to the promising smells, I was embarrassed. Three stars for tasting good.

This is good, no, this is great meatloaf. It stays moist and doesn't fall apart. It is tangy and smooth. The flavours are bursting with every bite. It has the right amount of everything. There are telephone books shorter than the ingredients list for this meatloaf I know.  I even had to go to the grocery store twice just to get everything. Don't fret or give up, it is worth it. My husband didn't ask me to marry him though. It's not the meatloaf's fault. He was too busy stealing my portion. But then again, he did propose that I make another one for tomorrow. :-) Thank you Jesscat for your recipe.

I made this for my love on Valentine's Day. It was a great twist on regular meat loaf! The flavors were really nice and my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I used panko breading, however, since I didn't have any "regular" bread crumbs. I also omitted the mushrooms since my honey doesn't like them. I did take a note from the other reviews about the grease. I just poured the grease out before I put the glaze on and also before I was ready to serve it. The meatloaf itself was nice and tender and there was little to no grease left :).

I  made it and I love it and so does everyone else I've shared it with so far.  I did cut out  the curry powder and bacon.  Plus, since I can't easily find veal without going to a butcher, I used equal parts ground beef and Italian sausage.  I can't get it to stay together as a loaf without using a loaf pan so if you have one I recommend using it --  it still tastes delicious.

Omitted veal, increased beef used soy sauce in place of teriyaki. My family loved it. Too lazy to go to the store to get what I didn't have. I will use this again. Thank you.

Didn't have curry or a substitute, didn't have the teriyaki  sauce used soy sauce. Used tomatoes with green chiles in place of tomatoes. Used beef and pork only.  Liked it better than any other  meat loaf I have prepared and tried.

As unpleasant as its name.
