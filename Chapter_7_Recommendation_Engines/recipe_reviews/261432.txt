Well, just YUM!  What's not to like about this dessert??  I used So Delicious Very Vanilla for the ice cream---a very yummy cashew milk iced dessert.  This would be great for a dinner party ending!  Thanks, Baileys!

I love putting Baileys over ice cream, and this was a nice idea to add some pretzels to give it that salty sweet combo and some crunch. I think chocolate covered pretzels would be perfect, but I didn't have any. I used coffee flavored ice cream (which was awesome) and added some whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles. I crushed up a pretzel rod.

This is such an easy, delicious dessert! I used Dark Chocolate & Peppermint Pretzel Crisps by Snack Factory for my pretzels, and they were a wonderful addition to this sundae. I loved the chocolate and peppermint flavors that they added. I did use only 1 ounce of Baileys due to the size of my scoop of ice cream.

I added a drizzle or so of Hershey's Syrup and a dollop of whipped cream.  Absolutely delicious.....the pretzels add a nice crunch - sure to satisfy those "time of the month" cravings!!

Very yummy & oh, so easy. I'd add a little more ice cream for the 2oz of Baileys, but that's personal preference. The pretzels added great contrast!

I really liked this, but I think it would be better with more pretzels. They really help to cut the sweetness and liquor-i-ness. By the end when I ran out of pretzels, the nearly pure liqueur was rather tough for me to get down. Extra pretzels would be perfect! Thanks for sharing.

Too easy and  very delicious!  We made these a couple of times already and love them.  I added some grated chocolate over the Vanilla Bean ice cream, excellent!
