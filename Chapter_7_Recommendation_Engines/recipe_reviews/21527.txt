I'll echo what others have said in saying that this cake is amazing.  And despite being pretty easy to make, it looks like it was prepared at a bakery.  

Just a few tips:  

1. I definitely think the cake needs longer to cook than the 15 minutes they suggest.  I would say closer to 30.  Use the toothpick test, and wait until it's a light golden brown on the outside.  

2. The part that's easiest to mess up is the filling.  Make sure the whipped cream is as "firm" as possible before adding it to the pudding mixture.  (It's best to keep the beaters and bowl in the freezer until ready to use).  And make sure that the cake is totally cooled before you add the filling or you'll probably be dealing with a mess.  

3. I'd go with more chocolate than the 1.5 oz bar they suggest.  It wasn't nearly enough to drizzle over the cake. 

4. It may feel like a lot of amaretto when you're making it, but the taste is definitely not overpowering when it's done.  I'd recommend using the full amount.  

Enjoy - it's fabulous!

I kind of freaked out at first because at 15 minutes at 325 degrees the layers were all still very liquidy and a clean toothpick inserted into the center was not coming out clean. However, I continued baking and checking them at 5 minute intervals, they looked much better after an additional 15 minutes and everything else went smoothly. So i just reccomend upping the baking time to 30 minutes. Also I beleive that you are supposed to use the liquid creamer, thats what I used because an entire cup of powdered creamer just seemed like too much to me. Maybe I'm wrong but it all worked out in the end! :-) Happy Baking!

I made this cake twice yesterday.  The first time I made it, I followed directions using layer pans.  I used non-stick pans and sprayed them.  Cooked according to directions.  Could not get them out of the pans because they were so moist.  Made it again in a 9 X 13 pan and used shortening and flour.  Turned out great, but it still stuck to the pan a little.  Next time I make it, I'll put wax paper in the bottom of the pans and see if that helps.  The cake is absolutely "divine" and I will be making this a lot.  Co-workers loved it and it has now become my husbands favorite cake!

This cake was easy to make and sooo delicious. For me, it works best as a trifle, and looks lovely as such. I took it to work for a coworker of mine and it was gone before the end of the day. Everyone that tasted it raved about how good it was and I handed the recipe out to at least two people. One thing though, about the recipe: when you mix the pudding mix with the creamer and amaretto, it doesn't thicken as pudding would with milk, but that's okay(at first I thought I goofed). Also, if you're not good at whipping cream ( and I'm not), Cool Whip works just as well, but I'd try the extra creamy versions. All in all, this cake recipe ROCKS!

I'd have to say this might have been the best cake that I've made from here yet! I had to use 9-inch layer pans as that is all I had, and I cooked the cake approximately 20 minutes.  Also made extra whipped cream to fold into the filling to allow for frosting the sides. Used dark chocolate melted on top. Everyone raved!!!

This cake was heavenly and looked like a bakery bought cake!  I made the cakes as stated in the recipe (w/liquid creamer).  When I went to make the filling, I realized I had no vanilla pudding, so I used chocolate.  As the birthday "girl" and her husband do not drink, I did not use Amaretto in the filling.  I also am not a big fan of heavy cream, so i substituted fat free Cool Whip.  The modifications were awesome!  I used the filling solely as filling between the layers.  I then frosted the cake w/Duncan Hines vanilla frosting (no choc drizzle).  Awesome cake w/minimal effort above and beyond baking a plain box cake.  Thanks!  Ooops, forgot, I baked at least 30 minutes (toothpick test).
UPDATE:  VERY important to line pans w/parchment if you'd like them to come out in tact.....if you forget (as I did on my second try) this will create a wonderful tasting trifle!

I was given this recipe by a friend and it is truly a great cake recipe!! Be sure and use the wax paper to make it easier to remove cake from pan, this was a really good tip I got from a previous reviewer and it does make it alot easier as does making sure the whipping cream is whipped to stiff peaks. I have made this recipe several times since Jan. and it is an impressive dessert enjoyed by all. I highly recommend trying it and all who have tasted this request the recipe!!

I made this cake for a friends birthday party and it was the hit of the night! I am so glad I read all the reviews ahead of time. While I was making the frosting I realized that I forgot to buy the vanilla pudding but I had a tub of vanilla whipped frosting on hand and used that with the cool whip and it turned out to the perfect consistency! Oh and the creamer is liquid not powder. And double boil the chocolate bar And use a spoon to drizzle the chocolate. And I also toasted the almond slivers in a pan and make sure you add the almonds last on top! Divine indeed!!!

I couldn't not give this five stars. I made it for my husband's birthday (amaretto is his favorite). I used International Delights Liquid non-dairy amaretto flavor (you can go on their website and find out which stores carry it... I had to go across town), Disaronno amaretto, and cool whip lite. I omitted nuts and heath bars. As per others' suggestions, I put wax paper down in my pans and the cakes came out perfectly (about 21-22 minutes for me). I used two Hershey's bars, but struggled to get all of the drizzle on there, there was so much!! I also used two 8oz tubs of cool whip... one and a half would have been fine (I frosted sides too). Everyone thought I bought it from a bakery when they looked at it, and were in love with the flavor. Worked out so well!!!

Update: I've been using this recipe for 4 years now, as cakes and cupcakes, changing out various liqueurs, creamers, and puddings. I just tried Kahlua Cinnamon Spice with Cinnamon Vanilla creamer, which resulted in a little drier of a cake than I'd have hoped for - maybe I should have changed the yellow cake base this time.

I'm not a fan of cake mix, so I was dubious about this recipe, but let me just say, it is every bit as good as any scratch cake I've baked, and I've baked a lot of fabulous cakes!  I followed the recipe exactly, except the baking time was extended from 15 mins. to 22 mins.    The cake is extremely moist, so I was glad that I used parchment paper to line the cake pan bottoms.   I made this for a friend's birthday, and he was more than delighted with it.  The cake got RAVE reviews.  I will make it again soon.

Oh dear lord, I want to have this cake as my final meal! I've made it two ways, and both were received with RAVE reviews. First way was by the recipe - I always like to follow the recipe by the letter and then tweak from there. I did use more whipped cream (an entire "tall" one) for added lovliness and fluffy frosting. Second way: I adapted it into a white-chocolate raspberry cake by changing the creamer flavor (there are SO many options out there today!) and adding some pureed raspberries (strained out the seeds) and raspberry flavoring.  MAKE THIS CAKE - you will be the talk of the night!

This was great... it's beautiful & overall very easy to make!  I made it for a birthday party & everyone just raved over it (they don't usually like dessert).  It is very rich, so I recommend keeping the servings small.

I won a competition with this cake, I was so happy with how easy it was. I actually made mine into cupcakes. They take about 20 minutes to bake. I did everything as specified in the recipe but instead of drizzling the chocolate I made chocolate drizzles on wax paper before hand and stuck them up vertically. They looked really impressive.

I am currently making another batch right now for an event tomorrow. I can't wait to see the group's reactions!

WOW!! This cake is awesome! I made it in two 9" pans and baked it for about 25 minutes. I made it for a friends birthday and everyone raved about it! I saved the extra whipped cream to put on top of hot chocolate...YUM!!! I also used two melted chocolate bars and put in plastic sandwich bag and cut the tip to decorate. Looked like I bought this from a bakery!

The best cake I have ever made! I did substitute a few things here and there (chocolate cake mix, no toffee in topping, less oil in cake mixture, less alcohol in the topping, Cool Whip Lite instead of heavy cream, toasted the almonds). ALSO: Bake for way more than 15 minutes - more like 30 minutes. The picture is up in the 1 of 7 featured photos - side/top view. ABSOLUTELY YUMMY!

I LOVED this cake!  I wasn't able to find the amaretto creamer so I just used regular vanilla.  It does have a strong amaretto flavor even without it but I didn't think it was too overpowering.  I think next time I will use pecans instead of almonds, just a personal preference though!  Everyone really enjoyed it!!

This cake is wonderfully moist and delicious. The first time I made it with only 2 cake pans which meant it did need to bake a bit longer than stated. I also used a large tub of cool whip instead of the whipping cream and it didn't get as firm as I would have liked but still tasted great. There was plenty of frosting even though I frosted the whole cake. Since I had so much leftover, I made a second cake in a a 9x13 pan which tasted just as good as the layer cake. Everyone who tasted it loved it!

This is an extremely good cake, and very easy to make. It also looks a lot more impressive than than the amount of work it takes to make. I do think that this takes longer than 15 minutes to bake though - I ended up baking mine for about 30 minutes before it was done enough, and I determined that by sticking a toothpick in the middle ultimately. (Though I will say it also just looked done after that amount of time too, and it didn't look done at 15.) I also iced the sides of the cake even though the directions say not to, and drizzled it with three melted chocolate bars, not just one. I suspect two would also be enough, but one definitely isn't if you want to use the drizzled chocolate. (It's something that I don't think *has* to be done, though.) And the amaretto was not at all too overpowering for us, so my suggestion would be to use the full amount. In terms of creamer, I used the liquid amaretto flavored creamer. I suspect the cake part itself would also be very good with other icings if you didn't want to use the one included with the recipe - even just the cake part is very good. It was greatly enjoyed by all of us, and I will definitely make this again.

I made this cake for the first time last week for our annual cook off at work.  One of the judges said she loves chocolate so much that my cake, as pretty as it was, had no chance of winning her vote.  I'm happy to say that not only did I win her over but I won the dessert category!  She could not believe how delicious and moist this cake was; everyone loved it and had to have the recipe.  This is my first time to write a review on a recipe; had I not read the reviews before attempting to make this cake, I might not have won.  They were all very helpful.
I too made a few adjustments to the original recipe; regardless of the size of cake pans you use, the cook time is longer than 15 minutes.  I used nine inch cake pans so the cook time was increased to 22 minues.  I was a little conerned that the Amaretto would be over whelming but it was not, I used the exact amounts it calls for.  The whipping cream was increased to 3 cups so there would be enough icing for the sides.  Beat the wipping cream to very stiff peaks, it will soften up a lot once you add the pudding mixture.  Instead of placing sliced almonds on the top of the cake, I added more chocolate covered toffee pieces by using a star cookie cutter as a mold.    This cake is a new family favorite that I will continue to make year after year!

I would like to try this recipe but make them into cupcakes.  How long do you think I should bake them?  Should I change the temperature? Any other suggestions?

This cake is awesome, this whole website makes me seem like a natural cheif to my whole family! The cake was soooooo yummy,the only issue is that I cooked the cake layers for 23 mins instead of 15 in a nine inch pan.

Very rich and very pretty and would deserve four stars, but he frosting was too soft and the layers slid, even after freezing the bowl and beaters and whipping the cream til it was almost butter. Made it the second time and used two boxes of instant pudding and used between layers.  This held together much better, but had a stronger flavor.  I reserved 1 cup of that mixture, which I folded into an additional two cups of whipped cream, along with two more chopped Heath bars.  I used this to frost the top and outsides.  Much better and beautiful!

This cake was a total hit! And I made it with a triple chocolate cake mix, Devil Food chocolate pudding and Kahlua and the hazelnut creamer, suggested by another reviewer. My cake layers were very dense and fudgy like brownies. Was the creamer supposed to be liquid?  When I mixed the pudding and dry creamer with the Kahlua it took some time to incorporate with the whipped cream but it turned out just fine.  I would make this again, but hope someone can enlighten me on the creamer.

I was really impressed with this cake because it was quick to make and everyone that ate it loved it.   If you make this recipe make sure that you whip the heavy cream really well prior to mixing it with the pudding mix because the pudding mix seems to make the whipped cream a lot less stiff.   Even though the recipe says that you should not ice the sides of the cake, I made extra whipped cream (instead of two cups, I used three) and  mixed that in with the pudding mix so that I could ice the  sides of the cake. However, if you use two cups of heavy cream you should have more than enough icing to ice the entire cake. I had so much left over that I made another batch of cake batter and made cupcakes so that I would not waste all of the extra icing.  I had a problem drizzling the cake with chocolate, so I think next time I will skip that step since the cupcakes  did not get drizzled in chocolate and they tasted great without it.

This is the BEST CAKE EVER!!  I started making this cake a few years ago & it is specifically requested all the time now. Last time I made it I made a double batch & made cup cakes along side the cake. There is never a piece left over to take back home.
 I even made the chocolate version that someone mentioned & it was really good too.

Great recipe! I couldn't find amaretto creamer so I used almond toffee.  Very good!  I also used french vanilla pudding.  Put double dipped chocolate covered strawberries on top with the chocolate drizzle.  I made it for my best friend's Birthday.  Very impressive cake.  Make it without hesitation :)

Absolutely scrumptious cake! The best I've ever made. Easy to prepare and displays beautifully. If you love almond flavor, this cake is to die for! Very rich, you only need a small piece.

not the BEST cake in the world but it's good. i found that the coffee creamer made it  taste a little artificial. i wouldn't make it again but am glad i tried it out. it looks nice when finished and turned out very moist, just the actual flavor of the cake and frosting wasn't completely right.   sidenote: went to two stores to find amaretto creamer and couldn't so i used french almond flavor creamer.

Very delicious!! Depending on your sweet tooth, you may want to add more/less amaretto liquor to the frosting. Next time I will use just a little bit less liquor because it was way too sweet and sugary. I omitted the chocolate drizzle on the sides, and it was just as good!

This was a good cake, although I will definitely make the cake from scratch next time.  I don't care for boxed cake mix.  I used 2 square pans instead of 3 round ones.  There was enough frosting to very generously frost the middle, top and sides.  My family liked having the extra frosting on the cake.  The frosting was definitely the bomb!  I topped it with lots of finely curled chocolate and drizzled melted chocolate on a diagonal.  It looked so pretty.  Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loves this recipe. The only problem i have is the cakes are very moist and falls apart when assembling. I followed the recipe as is and the cake comes out oh so good. For the centre filling i add a bit of crushed hazelnut and almond chocolate candy mixed with the frosting.

This cake is delicious and beautiful, light and very moist. I used the liquid creamer a little less amaretto only because I ran out. The amount of amaretto in the cake was 1/2 cup liquor and 1/2 cup water. Baking time for me was 25 minutes.  The frosting change was cool whip because I am not gifted at making real whipped cream. A small tub was used in place of the whipped cream. I also whizzed the toffee bars in the food processor. I had forgotten the chocolate bars and melted semi-sweet chocolate chips for the drizzle. Great cake --- my 6 guests loved it and two just had to take a piece home for the next day.

This cake was delicious, everyone wanted the recipe. Just two things though: as others have said, it needed to bake longer, and I ended up with about twice as much frosting as I needed, and I did frost the sides, though the recipe says not to.

Overall the cake is amazing and a guaranteed hit!

This cake turned out wonderfully; the amaretto frosting is not too strong or overpowering.  Just use what's recommended and it should turn out fine.  I did not have any problems.  And everybody enjoyed it! Thanks!

Can it be clarified whether the recipe refers to powdered or liquid creamer?  This may be where the problems are arising.

I have made this several times with great results.  I did have to bake the cakes about 35 minutes and the last time I just put 1 tablespoon of amaretto in the frosting and it was not quite as strong.  If you are wanting to make a really impressive dessert that is fairly easy I would reccomend this one.  It is absoulutely BEAUTIFUL when done (I frost the sides of mine and don't usually put the almonds on top though)

I don't know where I went wrong.  I followed the directions to a tee - the layers were no where near ready after 15 minutes.  I proceeded to let them cook another 6 minutes (21 min.) - I thought that was good enough.  After cooling, I began to turn the layers out and they were still very mushy inside - like wet/greasy.  I rechecked my oven temp, and the recipe to make sure 325 was correct.  I cooked the layers another 8 minutes !  They are still mushy !  Could it be the amaretto liquer ?  I don't know - I would appreciate any tips you can give.  I was so looking forward to serving this cake to my bridge club tonight !

Made this cake this weekend and it was tasty but the cake is a flop. Boxed cakes have been decreased in size so the liquid amounts are to much. You will need to buy two cake mixes and use a scale to get the amount of dry ingredients correct. Same with the pudding it could use a bump up in the powder too. Instead of a three layer cake I got two flat and wet layers about an inch thick.

This was very tasty and thanks for sharing. I would agree with other reviewers that it needs to cook longer ~ I had it in for 25 minutes and it was still a little undercooked, so I think 30 would have been perfect. Also, I only ended up using about half of the filling and frosting mixture and I very generously filled and frosted top and sides. This cake is great to customize yourself with so many flavors of cake mix, creamers, puddings, and liquors available.

Very good cake.  Made this for my daughters birthday and everyone loved it.  I could not find amaretto creamer so I used french vanilla, would like to try it with the amaretto creamer some time.  I used 2 large containers of cool whip as I wanted to frost the sides of the cake but had way too much.  I think you could do it with only 1 large container of cool whip or you could go with 1 large and 1 small and then you would definately have enough.

This cake was AWESOME!  If you love Amaretto, this is the cake for you.  Easy to make, and I am no baker.  I didn't give it a five, because it is not very portable.  I took it to work and it shifted en route.  Still tasted wonderful and everyone wanted the recipe.  Next time I will chill it longer and maybe put dowels in it for stability.  Highly recommend this cake.

I love this recipe.  I tried substituting raspberry amaretto for the original,French vanilla creamer and pudding for regular vanilla, coconut for the heath bars and topped it with toasted coconut and raspberrys for the almonds. It turned out fantastic and very pretty.

We didn't like this cake very well. Perhaps made an error but found the cake way too rich for our taste.

I followed this recipe exactly, except the baking time of 15 minutes.  It came out just beautiful!  I'm so excited about this recipe that I HAD to let everyone know how great it was. I used more chocolate on the top and had to let the frosting set a bit before I could spread it on.  The liquid creamer worked great even though I was nervous about it.   Great Recipe!!

My family & I did not like this recipe at all.  I used Ameretto flavored liquid non-dairy creamer since the recipe didn't specify. Maybe that's why I thought the flavor was off.  The cake & the topping had a fake almost metallic taste.  Yucky

Divine is certainly the word for it! It is the most wonderful cake I have ever eaten! Filling is light and tasty and cake is so good! I was afraid I had used too much amaretto but,once baked, it was a subtle flavor.
Oh! I used liquid creamer. Turned out great!

FANTASTIC!!!  i made it to bring to my sister-in-law's house for Mothers Day. Everyone, and i mean everyone, loved it!! I'm passing out this recipe to everyone that was there! I did line my cake pans with waxed paper before baking as someone suggested and it worked out very well that way because they didn't stick to the pan.  Thank You very much for sharing this wonderful tasty cake!!

Mamagdc....This is my recipe; I have made it several times and have not had the trouble you described.  I am so very sorry you were not able to enjoy it with your friends.  Is there any possibility you could have had a power failure?  Otherwise, I do not know why your cake did not turn out.  I hope you will try it again.  Janet A.

Made as directed.  Needed to bake longer than 15 minutes.  Did 20 at least.  Used whipped topping instead of whipping cream and seemed great to us all!  Seemed even better the next day.  YUM!!!

Definitely going to make this again. Unfortunately amaretto flavoured non dairy creamer isn't available here. So, I had to use an almond flavoured one instead. I was worried the flavours wouldn't mesh well, but it was so yummy. This will be a go to when I need a special dessert

I made this for a Mother's Day dinner for my family, and they said it's the best cake I've ever made and I'm the one who brings the dessert to our family events so that means a lot! I love amaretto, so when I found this cake I couldn't wait to make it. My tips are: usually one box of cake now is usually around 15oz, so be careful, buy two boxes and measure/scale out 18.25 oz (or even 19oz which is what I did) to get the right amount of dry ingredients. Also for the amaretto non dairy creamer. I couldn't find that… so I used a liquid vanilla one instead and I'm lucky enough to have found amaretto extract at a local baker shop... so I added a generous teaspoon of that in the cake and in the frosting. I let the pudding mixture set for ten mins, and whipped the whip cream until it was basically butter… it was such a delicious frosting (my dad said he could swim in it!) Delicious and it was a big hit, thanks for this recipe!

This totally flopped. I don't know if it was the wrong kind of pudding or wrong creamer or what but my frosting would not set up. It never thickened but I used it anyways thinking I could just pour it in between layers and the whole cake was a runny lopsided mess. I decided I was too embarrassed of it to take to Christmas dinner. The only reason I didn't give it one star was that it still tasted sweet and my kids liked it. Had to be stored in the freezer.

Made this cake 4 times already!  First try, I couldn't find the Amaretto and used the Bailey's Toffee Almond creamer and it was still good, according to my co-workers - same flavor pattern as the Amaretto and toffee.   I made it again, with the Amaretto creamer and ended up winning the Bake Off at work with this cake!  SO delicious!  Agree with the other posts, bake a little longer, make sure the whipped cream is good and stiff before folding in the pudding.  I used chopped up Heath Bars on the first 2 and then I tried the Heath Chunks, found in with the Chocolate Chips section at the store, and it turned out great either way.  My son-in-law wanted this cake for Thanksgiving, which got me off the hook for making the turkey!  Not only is it good, but super easy to make too!

My whole family loves this cake! I don't use alcohol in the frosting because my family is very LDS. Instead I use the almond flavoring.  I make it about 1-2 times a year. Only once did I have a problem with getting the cake to come out of the pan. when that happened I decided to turn it into a triffel and acted like that was how I wanted it to turn out. :)

I made this for a Christmas party. I accidentally put the pudding in the cake batter (used a second box for the filling). With all the liquid, it was able to aborb it. Definitely whip your cream just a bit longer. Once I added the pudding mixture to the cream, I whipped it more until it was just slightly stiff.I left big chunks of candy bar and did not do the chocolate drizzle. Great cake! It is sinful and decadent.

This has to be one of the best tasting cakes I have ever made. The family loved it and wanted to ensure I make this cake again. 
Some modifications will need to be made the next time but other wise this cake is AWESOME.

Absolutely amazing. True amaretto flavor, more than just cherry and almond. I like to make the whipped frosting without toffee pieces, but that's just preference - thanks so much for this recipe!

Oh my gosh!  This is the best cake ever!  My friend always ask me what kind of cake I want for my birthday and I gave her this recipe this year.  I told her don't bother to ask anymore!  This is my absolute favorite!  She did frost the cake on the sides and it came out looking just like the picture.  It is so good!  Another friend who is a caterer has made this cake 3 times in the last 2 weeks and it is a huge hit for her too.  We'll be having it again tomorrow for Easter.  Everyone will be amazed!

I didn't want to rate this since I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but rather substituted Kahlua for the amaretto, and used cappuccino powder in place of the creamer. The cake turned out SUPER boozy and no one in my family could or would eat it. I'm not sure if using the amaretto would produce the same result, but just be wary. If it seems like a lot of alcohol for your tastes, it probably is.

This is an amazing cake.  I don't like chocolate, so I simply skip the candy bars and it is still "divine".  Everyone always raves when I bake it.  It is extremely moist and tastes very decadent.

I haven't yet tried this recipe, just found it today, but sounds WONDERFUL!!! I am wondering if the lady who had so much trouble with it perhaps had a cake mix that wasn't fresh (it happens even when you buy them from the store for the recipe sometimes). This happened to me once with a chocolate cake; it was very flat and took a lot longer to bake. My kids thought I made a big pan of brownies and they were happy, so it was a save!!  This is what could have happened.
