I was very nervous about preparing this dish because I was worried that the steamed asparagus wouldn't turn out but my guests loved it.  Fairly easy recipe and I will definitely serve it again.  I made a spinach salad with cranberries and mandarin oranges and I made oven roasted potatoes using Lipton Onion Mix and olive oil.  My dinner party was a success and I will definitely make this recipe again!

I have made this twice; once the original way and it was good; once my way and it was fantastic (for me). My Way: I marinated the chicken for 1 hour in the wine and herbs but added 1/2 lemon for greater acidity. Dipped them in an egg bath and then dusted them with a mixture of 30/70 Flour/Parmesean Cheese (grated not shreded) and pan fried it. I was suprised the sauce went so well over the crusted chicken breast. Also I blanched my Asparagus instead of steaming them; but that is just a personal prefrence. Great Recipe!!

Wouldn't change a thing. This is quite a tasty recipe. With so few ingredients, I was skeptical; assuming it would be bland. On the contrary. It's super easy, creamy and scrumptious. A perfect mid-week meal for the family that looks like a gourmet dish. My 8-year-old son and my wife loved it. I will make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. For a simpler version, bake the chicken directly in the prepared hollandaise sauce and top with asparagus.

Be careful not to let the chicken marinate more than the 2 hours. I marinated for about 4 hours and it turned out horrible. All I could taste was the wine.

I prepared this recipe with the Chickpea Salad with Red Onion and Tomato recipe. While this was a fine combo, I would prefer to make this with a mild rice dish next time. This was a very successful recipe. It is nice mild flavor and a good way to combine the veggies with the meat. I ended up cooking it in my oven at 375 on a broiling pan for 25 minutes. This is because I do not have a grill. It worked out fine and I would make this dish again.

Great recipe.  I used bernaise sauce instead of hollandaise and less cheese (we don't use much in any dish).

This was pretty dang good. I was worried about what other reviewers said about marinating too long in the wine, so I kept mine to two hours on the dot. The flavor was yummy. I didn't use packaged hollandaise. Instead I found "Blender Hollandaise Sauce" on all recipes. It was great! Between the two recipes you'll have a gourmet meal in much less time.

I think this recipe is very good. However, I have made some changes. I use a whole can of chicken broth and cook the asparagus until slightly tender. Then I take the asparagus out ans set aside. Then I place the chicken in the remaining broth and season with what feels right that night (rosemary goes well). Then I pretty much follow the recipe as follows. I drain any extra juice at the end, then throw the cheese on. If you like your asparagus more on the crisp side, follow the recipe.

I thought this was OK.  I grilled my chicken for this and only marinated it for two hours using Chardonnay.  Any longer than that and the wine taste would definitely be overpowering.

I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I used canned asparagus. They were mushy and it was awful.  The second time I followed the recipe exactly and used fresh asparagus.  That was a definite improvement, but it still wasn't very good.  It was too bland.  It sounded so good.  I wonder if they brand of hollandaise mix would make a difference.

this was wonderful!  made it for my daughter's 18th birthday party with our family and grandma.  Used Gloria Pitzer's easy hollandaise sauce, which uses no egg yolks or butter (think lite mayo).  I also baked chicken with sauce, then put 4-5 microwaved asparagus spears along out sides of 13x9 pan, sprinkled with combo of shredded cheeses.  Served with boiled potatoes which was used to savor sauce, salad and apple strudel muffins (from this site).  Big hit, will be used for those special occasions to WOW guests.  Thanks Teck.

Asparagus was amazing like always but the chicken flavor was so over powered by the wine. So maybe i messed up but if ur a pro it should be great. I rated it a 3

We really like this. People always ask me for the recipe.  We don't use as much cheese and usually don't keep the meat in the marinade for the full two hours, but it still has a nice mixture of flavors.

I wish I would have submitted a photo.  Very nice presentation---I did change it. I cut up the chicken into 2 inch cubes, broiled them 5 minutes per side.  I put the chicken on a serving platter, covered with the asparagus, then the sauce and finally the cheese. Very pretty.  Won't make again. This had too much of a sweat taste for me

This is a really good, easy, weekday dinner.  And the good thing is, you get your veggie and protein in the same meal.  I also grill the asparagus.. don't skimp on the cheddar.  Very good.

I used this marinade as a base to poach the chicken (with chicken broth added to the mix) and it gave it such good flavor! Next time I'll try it with the asparagus. Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm sorry, but for me, this needs work....ok, but not a repeat for us...cheddar doesn't seem to find a place, hollandaise is great for asparagus, but combined with the tarragon in the marinade, why not just use bernaise...but then you would have a marinade of simply Chardonnay....needs some tinkering....

This is the first recipe from this site and it was a big success. I had my brother in law over and he thought it was amazing as did I. I prepared it with some tomatoe basil couscous and it was a great compliment to the dish. I can't wait to cook it again.

Due to a broken oven, I followed the recipe but cooked the chicken in the microwave using chicken tenderloins and cooking for 25 minutes in the sauce.  Microwaved the asparagus for 7 minutes and served the sauce over all.  Easy and very good.

Good flavors!  I lightly browned the chicken and then poached it in the wine and a little water and it turned out okay, but I will definitely grill it during the summer.  With all the other flavors, the tarragon did not stand out as much as  I was hoping for.

Oh my goodness!  This recipe was awesome!!!  Even my husband loved it...and he's a picky eater!  My 4 year old, my 8 year old and my 2 year old gobbled it up!  I took the advice of another and served it with roasted pine nut couscous!  Wow!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  We will make this one again and again!

This recipe is a good, savory way to up the flavor profile of chicken from every night fare to something extra special. The one change that I made was that I made the Hollandaise Sauce fresh (recipe on this site). This is an elegant meal as long as you have the time to marinade it properly. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for posting it.

This recipe was awesome!  I used a 10oz. box of frozen asparagus &  I also used Butter Buds in the sauce.  Definitely "company" worthy!

This is beyond delicious!  I'm eating it as I type - just couldn't wait to say thank you!!! I will make this over and over.  I even read the recipe wrong and used only 1/4 cup charddonay so I'm really looking forward to making it correctly.  Thank you.

I made this for company and paried it with couscous made with tomatoes and basil (Company Couscous)as another member suggested.  It was wonderful. Very easy and presented beautifully!  I recieved rave reviews.  The only thing I did different was leave off the Cheddar Cheese.  I forgot to put it on, but didn't miss it at all.

My boyfriend and I made this at college and it was fabulous. It was cheep and eay and we had enough leftovers for another meal. We even went home and made it for his parents. It is great!
