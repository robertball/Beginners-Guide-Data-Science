It was refreshing to see a knefla recipe that isn't the popular soup.  This is how I remember my German Russian grandmother making it.  A few things:  I would start with 1 1/4 cup flour and add more as needed.  I thought this called for a lot of flour and I had to add extra liquid to the dough as it turned out crumbly.  Like my grandmother, I par-boiled the potatoes in ham broth, removed the potatoes then cooked the knefla in the broth as well.  Instead of frying in oil, I heated the butter until good and brown (med-high heat)and then fried the potatoes and knepfla.  Also, I can't resist adding the toasted bread crumbs to this dish.  I hadn't made this in years and came across this recipe by accident.  Jogged my memory.  Thanks.  By the way, I grew up in SD, 100 miles or so west of Hoven, SD.

My sister Sandy and I were searching for Kuchen recipes and found this site.  We were so excited to see this recipe as it brought back many happy memories at Grandma's table.  We are orginally from a little town called Canova, SD which is near Salem.  Thanks so much for sharing and what a coincidence that we live in PA as well.

I taught school in Ellendale, ND, for 5 years back in the early 1980s. This recipe is as close as any to the way the ladies in our church made knepfla. In addition to parboiling the potatoes and frying in butter rather than oil, knepfla always included chopped onions in with the noodles and potatoes. At the last minute, a couple slices of bread, crumbled into random, medium-sized pieces, were tossed into the browning ingredients.  Parsley, fresh or dried, or dill weed (fresh is best!) were added as garnish.  As most ethnic traditional dishes, each woman has/had her own way of making and serving, but the variations were never far from the basic recipe. This dish is hearty farm food, made with love and ingenuity from a pantry far different from today's. Those living on the prairies of Russia or the US often had little more than flour, potatoes, salt, and ingredients from their own chickens and a cow. What creativity!

I grew up with this recipe! A couple of tips:

1) Don't ever mistake the baking powder for baking soda...the dough turns green (true story!)
2) don't put too many pieces into the water at once; they won't cook thoroughly and you'll have a runny mess.

Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was a lot of work and made a lot of dirty dishes.  The flavor was ok considering how much effort it took.  I served it with sausages and I would have to say that was the best part of the meal.

Glad to see this recipe, my mother made this regularly but she made a stew first with beef, onion and potatoes, then added the dough.   I thought the recipe was lost until I saw it here, so happy.   One of my favorite dishes
