This is close to the 'original' Caesar Salad recipe that I have been making for almost forty years.  The only difference being that my recipe does NOT include any red wine vinegar but another third of a lemon's juice, six to eight dashes of Worcestershire, a few more anchovy filets and 'KEEN's Hot English Mustard' instead of Dijon but Dijon is fine (The 'KEEN'S' gives it a bit more zip!).  The preparation is very easy to mess this up if not done delicately, thoroughly and carefully and I think from the comments of the worst reviews that the 'chefs' were not prudent and messed up....from my own past mistakes.  
ALSO, folks who claim to not like or want anchovies in their Caesar Salad are then NOT eating a Caesar Salad and any chef who claims to make a Caesar Salad without anchovies is not making a Caesar Salad...it MAY be a good salad but it is 'something else', just NOT a Caesar.  
NB...the 'original' Caesar Salad was created in Northern Mexico at the Caesar Brothers restaurant circa 1938 to feed the cast and crew when shooting ran late during the filming of the movie 'STAGECOACH'.  There is nothing Italian or anything to do with Rome or Julius Caesar about it.

Ok, and for the tweeks.... Instead of the raw egg I use about 1/2 cup mayonnaise, eliminate the vinegar, reduce the olive oil by half, add 1/2 cup grated fresh parmesan and whip together with the other ingredients.  I use anchovy paste as it blends into the whole dressing better without the overwhelming flavor of fishy anchovy. It is a must in Caesar dressing. This makes a wonderful creamy Caesar dressing with no fear of raw eggs, and people always ask for the recipe.

Fabulous traditional caesar salad, faithful to the original. I can't help but add...It is so frustrating when people review a recipe that they haven't even actually tried. A few small adjustments to a recipe is one thing but when there are Major changes - adding mayonaise and removing vinegar and egg - no problem if that's the dressing you like but its not a classic caesar salad dressing and its certainly not this recipe.  Some posters stray so far from the plot it leaves me wondering if they are rating the submitted recipe at 3 stars or are they giving their creation 3 stars?

The dressing is best when using a coddled egg instead of a raw egg yolk:
Bring a pot of water to a full boil, place an egg in the water for exactly 60 seconds (no more!), then remove and put under cold running water to stop the cooking process
Whisk this into the dressing in place of the raw yolk.

I can't imagine a ceasar salad without fresh, course ground black pepper! I also worked at a fancy restaurant and we back waiters always assembled the salad at the table-and theatrics  COUNTED! Kitchen prep was crushing garlic cloves and steeping them in EVOO for at least an hour and mixing anchovy paste with the juice of fresh lemons- this makes the anchovies taste more "nutty" and less "fishy" and the salt in the paste takes the acidic "edge" off of the lemon. We washed and seperated the romaine leaves and let them dry completely. The croutons were buttered and sprinkled with an italian spice blend and were always oven fresh and hot at assembly. We always began our presentation by rubbing the entire inside of the WOODEN bowl with a split clove of garlic. We then added the oil/garlic to the bowl, broke and seperated an egg  yolk (discard the sac) into the oil. We then gently placed the lemon juice/anchovy in the bowl (beside the oil, being careful not to blend the two) and broke another egg yolk into it , whisking it. The romaine was then torn into the bowl and the whole lightly tossed, trying hard to maintain flavor seperation. Then we added finely crumbled bleu cheese and hot croutons and the salad was tossed once more, immediately plated and served with us grating the parmesan and grinding the pepper for the diner(s). We NEVER added salt to this salad. A dry white wine was usually served with this salad, but a rose' goes well with it also!

Excellent as-is, my sweety was very happy with it and I'll use the same recipe again. I only had anchovy paste in a tube...but a teaspoon of that worked fine. Forgot to buy fresh garlic so had to use powdered which was the only mis-step in terms of taste -- not the recipe's fault.

When I saw this called for an egg yolk I knew it was a traditional recipe. I use a tablespoon Anchovy Paste in place of the whole anchovies when making a salad for four, it mixes well and taste great. Adjust to your liking. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this a lot.  I think next time I will use a little less lemon juice, it was a bit tart.  Also, maybe another anchovy filet or two.  I also will try using balsalmic vinegar for 1/2 the red wine vinegar.

This was a treat.  I always knew how to make a good Caesar Dressing, but this was better than mine.  It was the Dijon Mustard that mine was missing. This is also a great Coleslaw dressing.

Traditionally, I learned how to make this from a master chef and we have always added 1 tbsp. of capers...always improves the overall taste. I also coddle an egg for 1 minute before adding the whole egg, making the dressing much creamier and thicker! a pestle works well to crush the garlic, anchovies and capers together.

5 star recipe without the red wine vinegar and a few alterations... not in the ingredients though, just the quantities.  This is the same recipe we use but for the red wine vinegar.  We use about 5 cloves of garlic, several dashes of Worcestershire, and a 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese!  We use anchovy paste, a good squeeze from the tube and as far as the lemon juice, just add to suit your preference.  Everyone asks for this recipe!  It's even better the next day, so we always double the recipe and keep it in the fridge.

I made this to take to a meeting.  I was happy we didn't go to the meeting because no one in our house like this.  It is very sour!  I added a cup of splenda and it was still too sour.  Needed something creamy in it.  Just threw it away.

Very tasty and well-balanced dressing!  However, we only used one anchovy fillet.  Note, that this recipe makes a generous serving size for 2 people (we dressed our salad until just coated).  Thank-you for sharing!

It's not that it was inedible, but the lemon was overpowering and it just didn't have that Caesar mojo.  I preferred bottled dressing.  So I'll keep looking for the great Caesar Salad dressing that gets made at your table in the best restaurants.

This is truly a "classic" Caesar recipe!  I've been using it for years and the only one single ingredient I change is the fact that I use anchovy paste rather than chopping them up.  Just a large squish and it's still got the flavor without the ick factor!!

These are the exact ingredients we used when we made table side caesars in an upscale restaurant that I worked at years ago.  
The secret to a good thick dressing is to very very slowly drizzle the oil in while whisking constantly.

The original gourmet and fine restaurant version mashes the anchovies and garlic into the bowl, no anchovy paste. The idea is it gives the bite of the anchovy taste, not full on. Egg should be coddled, lemon not red wine or any vinegar. The lettuce is washed and cleaned and wrapped in towels and put in frig briefly until ready to use. This recipe was approved by any restaurants with Diners Club approval and famous at the finest Palm Beach and New York restaurants.

I have been making this classic Caesar salad for years and it is loved by all.  My recipe does not call for 2 T of red wine vinegar.  More like 2 shakes.  Everything else is the same.  Home made croutons and grainy deli-style mustard are my recommendations.  Of course, grate your own Parmesan cheese.  I recommend Egg Beaters for safety and I use less olive oil.  You won't miss it.  This salad is unbelievable.  I learned the technique from Meson Restaurant in San Antonio, Texas.

This is absolutely amazing! I used 1tsp anchovy paste instead & tasted so delicious. My husband hates anchovies & didn't want to eat it at first, but he loved it. This is my new caesar salad recipe!

This recipe is identical to the one I've been using since the 1980s.  Both my partner and I love it.  I use a few more anchovies and make my own croutons.

I was Director of Marketing for the oldest fine dining restaurant in Dallas. This recipe for Classic Restaurant Caesar Dressing is authentic and flawless. It is elegant and never fails to present the best!! It reminds me of the 5 star.. white tablecloth restaurants that were prevalent in the 70's and 80's. Stunning!

Made once with vinegar. Didn't care for it. Second time left out and it was excellent.  I did this in a food processor - step by step as above and used 4 anchovies.   When it came to drizzling in oil, I did it till incorporated.  Don't over process.  It came our very creamy.

The red wine vinegar and anchovy fillets are what really make this taste like something you would get in a high end restaurant. I followed this to a T and wouldn't change a thing.

Wow! This dressing is CLASSIC and AWESOME! tip #1...if you mix the dressing in a wooden salad bowl it also acts as an abrasive for the anchovies. I reluctantly substituted ReaLemon for fresh squeezed BC I forgot to buy a lemon. Three squeezes was plenty for me. I also used mostly apple cider vinegar with about 1 tsp red wine vinegar (I ran out). No salt necessary as anchovies (not paste) are plenty salty. Tip #2...if yours is too tart, please don't add sweetener. USE 1 tbsp grated parmesan to neutralize.  Thanks, Sarah, for taking me back to the gourmet restaurants of Vegas, Puerto Rico, Bahamas, and every other glamorous casino destination in the Western World!

Not so delicious.  Too tart and lemony, overpowering flavor of vinegar. I added another anchovy and it helped a little but it just didn't have the complexity of flavor I like in Caesar.  I also really don't like recipes that call for "half a lemon." My lemon tree has all different size lemons, and the amount of juice is  dependent on the season---just measure the lemon juice like you do everything else and included accurate measurements in the recipe.

Adjusted the recipe to 6 servings. Next time I'll do 10 because it's so good.  :)
I'm not sure why people make so many changes. This is great as written. It's so like I have had in fine restaurants. One was in Canton , Ohio, the first table side I had. I have craved it ever since and this fits the bill!

I agree with Toshmeabone, it must have anchovies and no red wine vinegar. Also, the egg should be coddled first then tossed with the romaine so the dressing will adhere to the leaf. I also 'de-stem' the romaine of it's cellulositic ribs. The salad is a lot more elegant and easier to eat.

Only use egg beaters and a ninja food processor to incorporate everything. No drizzling of oil and will never know the anchovies existed. Will never use mayo. or vinegar and only use dry mustard.

Our fancy restaurant used tubes of anchovy paste and tubes of garlic paste.  Saved time and was quality-controlled on the vendor's end.  They provided a wonderful flavor.  The rest of the recipe was pretty much the same as yours!  EXCELLENT salad !!  THANKS !

I did not use the vinegar as the lemon juice added enough acidity for my taste.  I also added the grated Parmesan to the dressing to continue to let the flavores develop.  It was very delicious and served the salad with Parmesan crisps.   Will definitely use this recipe as my go to for Caesar salad.

I made it essentially as given in the recipe, but I substituted tonkatsu sauce for Worcestershire sauce, and I used one whole egg instead of just the yolk. It was a big hit at the potluck. I will definitely make it again.
Update: I made this again, this time for Thanksgiving 2017. I didn't have quite enough red wind vinegar, so I added a little sherry vinegar. Everyone loved it. 
The one change I would suggest is that there's too much dressing for the amount of lettuce specified; double or triple the amount of lettuce (or reduce the amount of dressing accordingly). 
Still, the best home made Caesar salad I've ever had.

I've made it twice now. The second time I used a whole egg. It made it a little less thick. Better able to not over dress the lettuce. Love it!!!

The changes I made was to eliminate the anchovies. Allergic to fish and also I did not put in the raw egg. Turned out delicious and a favourite of ours.

I give myself 4 stars- I made the Dijon mustard on my own since I didn't have the store bought version.

This isn't the classic Caesar as I know it. As others have said the dressing should include dry English mustard  not Dijon mustard (1/4 tsp). There is far too much mustard in this recipe. And about   1/4 tsp of Worcestershire sauce.  I don't include the vinegar either.  Why use vinegar if you are also using lemon juice?  Way too much garlic in this recipe. 1 clove is plenty for an average head of Romaine lettuce. The egg has to be coddled first. Raw egg isn't healthy. Just slip the egg into boiling water for one minute, take it out and carefully crack it open and discard the white. I only use the yolk since the white is unnecessary. Others have mentioned mayonnaise. No. Not in the classic salad. That's a recent American addition along with bacon bits, shrimp and other items. I also use anchovy paste instead of canned anchovies simply because a tube of it keeps in the fridge for months. I use 1 tsp of the paste.

It was good but it definitely needs more anchovies, garlic, & some hot sauce. I'll keep looking.

This tasted like a vinaigrette dressing and was watery when pouring. Also, it doesn't need any salt.

I did not care for this recipe, I think it was the red wine vinegar that made it taste so bad.

It is way too tart. I agree with some of the reviews and the coddled egg (I never have use raw) really make a difference.\

this dressing is DELICIOUS!!!!  It is so flavorful & authentic.  I swapped the raw egg for a scant tablespoon of mayo.  When you add the olive oil, it emulsified  so beautifully.  A definite keeper -- thank you!!!!

Does anyone have the recipe for the classic grilled chicken that accompanies this salad in restaurants? The chicken seems to have the same taste whereever I go.
