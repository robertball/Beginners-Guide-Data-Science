I am drinking this right now.  The smoothest smoothie I've ever had.  I did not have Greek yogurt so I used plain vanilla and had to substitute the pumpkin pie spice with a bit of allspice.  I will make this again and again! Especially during pumpkin season! My 2 year old is currently stealing sips from my straw now! Toddler and mama approved!

I thought this was okay, I used light vanilla yogurt but  next time I do not think I will  put in the peanut butter it takes the pumpkin taste away
