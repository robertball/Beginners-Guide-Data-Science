It was quite dry and just not what I had expected. Kind of bland.  I doubled the recipe to use up farm-fresh eggs.  The only variation is that I left out the red pepper to make it kid friendly.  But even the kids didn't care for it.  Hubby smothered it with salsa and said it was "good enough for seconds".  It may be better without whipping the egg whites and adding more cheese.
