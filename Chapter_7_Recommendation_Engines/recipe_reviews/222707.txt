Winner! You know that delicate crackly top you get on brownies if you’re lucky?  And then how underneath that a soft and chocolaty brownie is revealed?  And how, if you include LOTS of chocolate chips in those brownies, they are now gooey and even more intensely chocolate?  Yeah, these are like that.  Don’t change a darn thing.  They’re perfect.  Too perfect, if you know what  I mean.

I give these a 5 star!  They taste just like a soft chewy brownie.  They are very sweet, you could probably cut down on the sugar if you wanted to, but I like them this way.  I only had 1 cup of brown sugar, so I used 1/2 a cup of white sugar along with it and it turned out great!

Yum!  What a wonderful aroma while baking! I used bread flour to up the chewy factor and subbed milk for the tbsp of water.  I used Ande's chocolate mint chips. Wonderful flavor and nice chewy texture.  They also freeze very well.  Will make again.

I followed this recipe exact, only using mini chocolate chips instead of the full sized ones. I baked them at 350* for nine minutes, letting them cool slightly on the pan before pulling them off to cool on my kitchen counter. AMAZING little cookies. They taste EXACTLY like a brownie. The whole family LOVED them. One of the best cookies I've made in a long time.

Perfectly chewy on the outside, and soft on the inside- even when slightly over-cooked!  Has a great chocolate flavor, but is slightly too sweet.

There was way too many chocolate chips, too cocoa tasting, and they DID NOT flatten! AT ALL.

OK, I have been trying out quite a few brownie recipes this summer and have not found the taste and texture I have been looking for until NOW.  THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT IF YOU LOVE CHEWY, CHOCOLATEY BROWNIES - LOOK NO FURTHER!.  I mixed up the ingredients for the cookies but put the mixture into an 11 x 7 rectangular pan at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and they turned out soft and chewy, just like the cookies!!!  LOVE THEM! THIS RECIPIE IS A KEEPER!!!

Real winner!!  Beautiful presentation, bakes soft and chewy.  A perfect brownie cookie.
Couple changes:
Added an addition 1/4 cup flour (batter was too wet otherwise)
Subbed unsalted butter for the shortening (same qty)

Came out perfect- thank you for sharing!  I would have posted a pic, but my husband is already eating them!

Awesome recipe!! Took a leap of faith and followed the recipe exactly (with ONE exception: we added mini m&m's. : D  ).

Turned out AMAZING! Fast prep and baking time. Love the consistency and it is DEFINITELY chewy - love it! I personally love the abundance of chocolate chips, but if you don't want some in every bite, you can half the amount of chocolate chips. :3 

For those who have a problem with the dough flattening during baking, I suggest you make smaller spoonfulls of dough and maybe flatten them yourself slightly with the spoon. Our first batch were too large and "piled on" and they did not bake completely in the middle. We fixed this in the rest of the batches and they turned out baked and delicious!

After 7-9 minutes of baking, do not worry if they're super soft - I was worried when I couldn't lift the cookies off the sheet with a spatula(they did not seem baked thoroughly) but after setting them for a couple minutes before lifting them, they should be fine! :D

Enjoy your cookies - this is a recipe I'll definitely use again and again! ^^

I made them exactly as written, but I wasn't impressed.  They really weren't that chewy.  They were ok, I was expecting more of a brownie type cookie.  They were just a chocolate cookie and I have a recipe that I like much better for a chocolate, chocolate chip cookie.  They did get eaten by the kids, but they all said they liked my other recipe better.  I guess when we want something like a brownie, we will make brownies. :)

These were fantastic the way I made them. I substituted the shortening with a cube of butter and about a tablespoon or 2 of shortening (I like the flavor of butter, so I didn't want too much shortening…). I also sifted the dry ingredients. I baked them for 8 minutes. They were fantastic! I mean, they really are a brownie cookie. The centers were filled with melted chocolate chunks and gooey batter, while the outside was rounded, crisp. Definitely recommend these if you want to get away from the traditional chocolate chip cookie or brownie.

Good. 2nd batch, I used butter instead of shortening and used 1/2 cup of cocoa and no chocolate chips. Much better. Update: dried out rather quickly, then became rather average.

I did not care for this recipe. But to be fair, I used butter instead of shortening. Even though I added a bit extra flour, these still were incredibly "wet". I used butterscotch chips and only used probably half as many as the recipe called for.  The cookie itself tasted much like hot chocolate. Not great. The major problem was that they flattened out and even at 375, which is higher than most, it didn't set up in the center. I froze the majority of the dough and will more than likely lower the oven temp and cook it for a greater amount of time when I get around to baking these.. which won't be for a while since they don't taste great.

I just made this last night... very easy.  The dough doesn't really spread so the center stays chewy and you can fit 24 cookies on a sheet.  I made about 40 cookies. They took 8-9 minutes. When I tasted the batter, it didn't taste that sweet, just chocolatey so I was worried the chocolate would be overpowering.  However, once they cooled they were sooo yummy.  I took them to work and everyone was raving over them. A winner for sure!

WOW!DELICIOUS! Can I give it 10 stars?  This Cookie was chosen by Unanymous Vote to replace the Chocolate Cupcake we have made for years along with our Scout Cookies for Fundraising here in Yucatan Mexico.  Often it has been suggested we make Brownies, but these are so much better.  And I love the comment (Which I cannot find now) If a Brownie and a Chocoloatechip cookie had a baby this would be it!   OH yes we have a winner.   I must say I found this récipe since I needed something to take to our meeting last night.  So I did a search here for a récipe that had eggs and Brown sugar, and no butter, margarine or oatmeal which I was out of.  Ths one came up,  I loved most of the comments and decided to make it.   Then as I was mixing,  I realized I only had a cup of flour. So I added an extra 1/2 cup of Cocoa.  Tasted GREAT! I usually follow directions exactly before playing with it, and today I am going to the store and I will make as directed,   - who knows it may be even better.  I reccomend this......Yum Yum  Thank You! Thank you!

Chewy and chocolatey. I followed the directions except I didn't have any chocolate chips. When the cookies came out of the oven, I made a little indention in the tops of some and poured caramel into them. Those were just as good as the ones without. From now on I'll be making these instead of brownies. The wife and kids loved them.

I doubled the original recipe, then added 1½ cups of walnuts.  I used a tablespoon cookie scoop and fit 16 (4x4 rows) on an airbrake tray (lined with parchment paper).  Baked 7 min, then left on cookie sheet for an additional 2 min before transferring to cooling racks.  My son loves chocolate and brownies so he thought they were great, but very rich.  I thought they were really, REALLY sweet, but they did taste like a brownie.  I think next time I'd reduce the chocolate chips by ½ or ¼.  The doubled recipe (with walnuts) made 11 dozen cookies (Tbsp scoops).

Made no changes and this a very  good cookie that can be made with ingredients  you already have  on hand.  DO NOT
overcook.,.  Take out just as the cookie seems to set.

I've made this recipe a few times and it always turns out amazing (even the time I accidentally doubled the shortening and didnt realize until they were already baking)! The one thing that I change is that I use white chocolate chips because I've never really liked the milk or semi-sweet chocolate chips. Definitely glad I stumbled across this recipe!

I have made these countless times, they are wonderful and are always well received *understatement*. I long ago axed shortening from my house and have found they are just as good made with butter (just omit the water).

These are fabulous! I love how it's soft, chewy, and chocolaty like a brownie, but in cookie form! Some people in the reviews said it was too sweet, but I found these cookies PERFECT! They mysteriously vanished before my eyes! :) I made a bunch for  a New Year's party, and I had to make another batch of them today (already.) This recipe makes roughly three and a half dozen cookies, in case you were wondering.

These are great! I used butter in place of shortening and used 1 and 1/3 cups of mini semi sweet chocolate chips because that is all I had in pantry. Sprinkled crushed candy canes on top to take to a Christmas Cookie exchange. They taste great with or without the peppermint. Great shape and perfectly chewy. I baked mine on parchment paper for 8 min. at 375 as directed. Delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe!  I added a 3.5 oz vanilla pudding mix and substituted a 1/2 cup of granulated sugar for 1/2 cup of brown sugar. They were moist, chewy, and absolutely amazing! I also used the peanut butter chip/chocolate chip mixed bag.  MMMMMM

Delish!  I halved the recipe and had to add a splash of milk b/c it was a little dry.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar after they were done baking.

Absolutely love as is! Made twice so far. Once as written and once swapping the shortening with coconut oil. I baked in a convection oven at 375° and it took the full ten minutes. I let them cool in the pan and they came out perfect!

This is the exact recipe I have been making for at least 20 years or more and they are amazing!!  Probably the most requested cookie I have ever made.  They take exactly like brownies!   I bake mine for 8 minutes and they are just perfect.

These cookies worked out beautifully and taste divine! The original recipe was a little sweet for my tastes, so I only added 1 cup of brown sugar, and I also combined dark chocolate chips with salted caramel chips, added walnuts, and used butter instead of veg shortening since I never use anything else in my baking. Delish!! They DO taste just like brownies!

I baked these on parchment paper, and had absolutely no issues with sticking. I also found they flattened nicely, they made a nicely proportioned cookie. I am wondering if those that had issues with it spreading too much may have added the shortening while it was too soft. I didn't even chill mine before baking, and they worked out beautifully!

Great flavor, great texture.  I did need to bake these 10 minutes for my light pans, and even then, they were still kinda gooey, but I like that in a brownie.  I did sub 1/2 cup white sugar for the equal amount of brown sugar just to lighten the flavor a little. Also, I only used half of the chocolate chips, because I just didn't have enough on hand, and it was still good.  I would definitely make it again.

It was DELICIOUS! I changed the shortening with coconut oil and the sugar with coconut sugar. I would recommend this recipe to all of my fellow chocolate lovers. Tip- if it isn't very crunchy outside, leave them for a few mins. and try not to eat them.

I mix up the chips depending what I have/feel like, our favourite is the sea salt caramel chips or mint. I use my #2070 scoop which yielded 58 cookies taht baked at 350 for 14 minutes. I use butter for the shortening and milk/cream for the water.

So easy to mix up & bake. I did cut the chocolate chips to one cup. Tasty cookie. For our bake sale, I cut out a heart shape in the center. Then spread marshmallow cream on a full cookie. Next, just sandwich them together & sprinkle the sugar.

this is, by far, my favorite brownie/cookie recipe ever. i've definitely made them at least a dozen times and they're always perfect! i love them, my friends love them, my family loves them.. there's just no way to go wrong with these. i never change anything in the recipe aside from doubling it; they're that good! if you're ever looking for a new brownie recipe to change things up, this is definitely the right way to go!

Just as described--delicious, soft, chewy, brownie-tasting cookies!  I used what I had on hand, so my only substitutions were whole wheat flour in place of all purpose, dark cocoa powder in place of regular cocoa powder and mini semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of regular semi-sweet chips.  Dark cocoa made them super indulgent, and the mini chips melted away to almost nothing--for those who fear chips will be too much.  Also great with chopped walnuts, if you like them!

These are very good cookies. I followed the recipe exactly, and they  came out nice and chewy in the center with the outside slightly crunchy like a brownie. I think next time I will add more cocoa and maybe nuts. Definitely a keeper and I think I will add these to my Christmas cookie collection that I bake and give out every year. I used a scoop for these cookies and the recipe yielded 32 cookies.
 Since my review in 2017, these have become a part of my Christmas Cookie Collection that I bake every year and give out to family, friends, and co-workers. It has become one of my most asked for cookies. Thank you so much for the recipe.

They were very good, actually, they taste exactly like the "cake mix cookies" recipes on this site, so if time and convenience is a major factor for you, there you go. I did substitute lard for shortening just because i can't find it in Spain. I also made a mistake and used baking chocolate (chopped in chunks- but the inevitable small flakes also fell in) instead of chocolate chips and for a moment while the first batch was baking, i panicked because the cookies were spreading a bit much for my comfort. They turned out just fine, slightly puffy or cakey so definitely be careful when dropping the spoonfuls to not tower them too high. My cookies also came out with a major chocolate molten center because of my mistake, but still delicious. I got 20 cookies and they cooked in about 7 or 8 minutes. They come out a little wobbly, but leave them to set in the pan out of the oven for about 2 minutes. All in all, they were good, but I won't make them often.

I used canola oil instead of margarine to cream the sugar and eggs and the outside of the cookie has got a slight merang texture. I love these. Will definitely be making these again.

This recipe is a favorite of my family, people at work, and friends.  I usually have to make double the recipe or more every time I make it! I always omit the water, else I find they are runny.  Also, I typically use white chips for the amount the recipe calls for and then add an additional half that amount of milk chocolate chips. I find this chip combination really throws these cookies over the top as far as flavor!

Loved these cookies! I used butter flavor shortening in place of the butter, only because I nearly always do (overall more cost effective than butter, although I do love me some butter!). I also had to add about, I don't know, three big spoonfuls of extra flour-maybe a cup? But I suspect this has something to do with either my altitude or the butter flavor shortening, as I always have to add more flour when baking cookies.

At any rate, these turned out wonderful-my 5 year old daughter did not like the cookies, but LOVED the raw dough. Everyone else loved the cookies! Soft and yes, tasted like brownies! These now go into my go-to recipe box!

I made this almost exactly as written (used a Butter Crisco baking stick for the shortening) and I used milk chocolate chips (didn't measure, just poured them in but it wasn't two cups).  I wasn't looking for a traditional cookie, so I spread the batter onto a parchment lined baking sheet.  I baked at 350 for about 15-20 minutes.  After it cooled, I used a cookie cutter to cut out circles and turned them into brownie ice cream sandwiches.  I tasted the left over pieces and they were chewy - I am going to use this as my brownie recipe from now on (but maybe add melted chocolate to the batter to give it a little more chocolate flavor that we like).

This recipe is one of my absolute favorites. The only adjustment I made after several times of following the exact recipe (because they are great as is!) was to add 1/2 cup of cocoa instead of 1/3 and I use 1 tsp of salt instead of half, it makes it nice and salty sweet.  It is also a great base recipe to add nuts and different types of candies.  Instead of the 2 cups of chocolate chips try Reeses Pieces or mint M&M's, they were a hit in my house.  We've even omitted the chips altogether and they are still fantastic. These are a constant request by friends and family.  Chewy little standouts!

I love this recipe! I do but coffee in instead of the water. It brings out a richer chocolate flavor more. I have also used a marshmallow frosting & crumbled graham crackers on top & made smore cookies with them.

These are definitely chocolaty, but somehow, they didn't quite do it for us. They were a little bland, and thick in an unpleasant way. If you do make them, cut the sugar; not more than 1 cup is needed. And watch them carefully; if you overbake even a bit they get dry.

Pretty good! I was craving a carbohydrate-y, chocolatey dessert and these looked like just the thing. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 c, as someone said they were a bit sugary, and I like the result. I would make these again, maybe with a few other tweaks - I left them in too long, for one thing!

Delicious! Even that I had only 1 cup of brown sugar (substituted 1/2 cup white sugar) and left out half the chocolate chips in favor of 1 cup of chopped raw pecans. The pecans added an adult flair to the cookie I thought. Most of my 12 grandchildren don't eat nuts. Thank you. I will make it again. PS... Measured carefully, the cookies flatten appropriately... Perfectly, actually!

Very chewy and delicious!!!  I changed it up some and only used 1 cup brown sugar and added stevia.  They come out very unstable, but as they cool, they firm up.  I will make these again!

Everyone loved them!  I used only 1 cup of packed brown sugar tho. And they don't really flatten as much as the picture but that is to be expected with how thick the mixture was. I may try a tiny bit more water to see if they may next time. Also I enjoy them heated in the microwave for 10 seconds the next day or so. Delicious. I would definately make them again.

These cookies are excellent! I made them for a family get together and they went over great. When I make them they are gone within a day or 2. So yummy.

These cookies had great flavor, but they spread a lot, and ran into each other. Not what I expected. :/

I changed the flour to ground oats, but this was awesome.  thanks.  fyi, i think one of your reviewers mixed up cups and ounces on the chocolate chips.  the chips are sold by weight ounces, not volume ounces.

These turned out really soft! pretty good. tasted just like a brownie in cookie form :) missing some flavour though.. might have to do with the cocoa i used. Id either add some melted dark chocolate to the batter or use a higher end cocoa

I made these yesterday using all Organic ingredients and they were heavenly!  I also halved the amount of chocolate chips only because we're not an overly chocolaty family.  I'll be taking these gems with me to some Fall parties!

This recipe turned out great! I decided to use half brown sugar and half Splenda brown sugar, substituted 1 cup of m&m's for the 2 cups of chocolate chips and used the smallest cookie scoop which yielded 44 cookies. The texture was perfect and just the right amount of sweetness!

I just made these for a present but I think I'll just make another batch as a present because they are SO GOOD!!!!! Very chocolaty, moist and if you eat them a little warm it's like OMG, heaven!
I just used butter and followed the rest of the recipe and they turned out great. Thanks for this one!

These are Perfect!!!! I've searched for so long for a perfect brownie cookie and have failed several times. This recipe is exactly what I've been looking for! Chewy, chocolately, slightly crisp bottom. Perfect! Don't change a single thing! I used dark cocoa powder and m&ms because that's what I had on hand and they were so delicious!!

I loved these!!  My husband thought they were too "chewy" but he prefers a crispy cookie.  I did add a touch of cream to the batter because I thought it was a bit too thick, so maybe that's why they were too soft for him.  I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but I do love soft cookies.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Awesome recipe. I did little adjustments. I used 1 cup of ap flour and the other half cup of bread flour. And 1 cup of brown sugar & half cup of Splenda. Used 1 cup of white chocolate chip cause it was the only chips I had in my pantry. Oh and 3/8 tsp of salt. Next time I'll do 1/4 tsp of salt and leave out the chips cause I just wanted chewy cookies, nothing too sweet. These cookies were sweet enough. My cookies weren't entirely chewy, it was chewy on the outside and soft almost like cake on the inside. So delicious.

A perfect cookie!  Tastes just like a brownie, in a cookie morsel.  It's hard to stop at one cookie.  Bake on a baking stone for perfect baking and texture.

This is a tasty quick cookie dough. I have baked many cookies in my life so I felt comfortable adjusting the recipe-- I subbed some applesauce for some of the butter, cut the sugar by 1/4 cup, and only had one cup of chips but we really like this one.  The texture is great -- chewy with a great chocolatey flavor. This seems like one of those recipes that lends itself to adaptation according to personal taste.

Oh boy, did I ever mess up this recipe!  My kids 'helped' me bake these.  I realized I forgot the cocoa powder when I pulled the first batch out of the oven - oops!!  I managed to save the rest of the recipe by adding cocoa to remaining cookies and they turned out really good.  Even the cookies that did't have cocoa powder turned out well.  Overall, a good recipe with the cocoa and without!!

I saved this recipe awhile back and was excited to finally use it for Valentine’s Day! It was the perfect choice for a perfectly chocolate-y treat to share with coworkers! Studded with mint chocolate chip AND red and white mint M&M candies, these cookies are sure to win over many hearts. I don’t typically use shortening for cookies but bit the bullet for this recipe and was pleased with the results. They aren’t greasy, just perfectly chewy and delicious. (Note: Same recipe as “Chocolate-Mint Brownie Cookies” on this site, with the exception of the peppermint extract.)

I made half of the recipe and I liked this brownie/cookie.  I used margarine instead of shortening.  I'm not a fan of shortening as the primary source of fat in desserts.  I also used half milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I didn't want chocolate chips in the cookies so I melted the chips with the water and added it to the margarine/sugar mixture.  The next time I may add more sugar.  I used a small cookie scoop (do not flatten) and the cookies baked for 8 minutes.

These cookies deliver: soft, chocolatey, perfect balance of salt & sweet. Followed recipe exactly and was pleased. Husband (who considers himself Ultimate Cookie Authority) gave them a 4, said he'd rather had Choc Chip Cookies or brownies. Still, he ate more than anyone else, I noticed. Very nice recipe.

Tried it today.  They were awesome!  I was a little short on shortening, so I made up the difference with butter.

Awesome! Loved by everyone. Changed the water to milk and used peanut butter chips and chocolate chips in them. Also I baked them at 350 F for 11-12 min because I made them  bigger.

These cookies are absolutely perfect!  They are crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside, just like a brownie!  These cookies are the perfect treat for chocolate lovers.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't make any changes.  I've also tried putting Andes Creme De Menthe chips in them and they were good, but I prefer them without.  Next time I make them, I am going to try putting toffee chips in them and see how they turn out.

I tried this recipe out to bring to my office's Christmas party. They loved it, not so much as the peanut butter balls which always seem to be the hit of the year, but almost. Highly recommended for chocolate lovers.

This cookie is very tasty.  My first batch burned slightly on the bottom (dark, non-stick pan with parchment paper) at 375F.  Lowered the temp to 350F and they were perfect.  I used the smaller scoop, that looks like an ice cream scoop, and baked them for 8 min.  I used white chocolate chips, instead of chocolate chips, and they looked as good as they tasted!

Made these for my coworkers, they were a huge hit. Very easy to make, everyday ingredients. Everyone commented on how chewy and soft they were. I made them a little bigger then the recipe called for (my recipe yielded 20 cookies) I had to bake for an extra 3 minutes.
