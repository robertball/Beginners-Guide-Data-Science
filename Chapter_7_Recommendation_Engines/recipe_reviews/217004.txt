Easy and delicious - plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken! I cut the recipe in half since I didn't have pecans I subbed toasted walnuts instead. I used a Red Delicious Apple and I also threw in just a bit of chopped celery and some dried cranberries. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used Hellman's light mayo and cut it with a bit of reduced fat sour cream. I used half apple pie spice and half curry powder along with a bit of salt and pepper. It chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good. Overall, a great combination of flavors!

What makes this unique is the apple pie spice which I mixed with mayo (actually used Miracle Whip Light). I halved the recipe, but liked the flavor of the spice so much, I used a full 1/2 teaspoon plus. This takes no time to put together, and I would serve this to company with no qualms at all. It tastes good, and the presentation is lovely.

Hello... This is jo1527, JO.  I tried to edit the recipe but couldn't.  I failed to put in the fact what many have figured out. The apple pie spice and mayo are in fact mixed together first before adding to the rest of the ingredients.  Enjoy!

I love this recipe the only change I made to it was I used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo to make it healthier. Excellent recipe!

This is better than your average chicken salad recipe and my husband loved it. I had my doubts about it because of the fruit and apple pie spice but it was good enough that I will make it again. I did use light mayonnaise instead of the full fat variety and I seasoned my chicken breast before cooking them.

This is basically the same as the recipe I love so much. Instead of apple pie spice, I add a tablespoon of dried tarragon.  The flavor really comes out after refrigerating for a couple of hours or even overnight. Makes a great sandwich on whole grain bread or, better yet, spread on graham crackers. Delish!

This recipe is also lovely as a hearty sandwich. I use curry and a dash of sugar to bring out the flavor of the curry, and walnuts instead of pecans. My hubby and son love it. I have not used the apple pie spice, but look forward to giving it a try.

I made this for a lunch with a girlfriend. It was fantastic!!! The only change I made was to omit the pecans and I added a little finely diced onion. It was great. The next day my girlfriend sent me a message saying she was craving the chicken salad.

Simple and SO easy to make!
I just made this for lunch today and made it into a wrap. Heavenly!!! I didn't have all the ingredients though, so I used what I had: salt & pepper instead of the spice, and chopped almonds. 
It was still very good. Next time, I'll definitely try it with the apple pie spice. Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

We love this recipe, use it for camping and beach trips all the time. I make it ahead of time and it's a nice alternative to the standard travel lunch fare. (Especially when you have small children) I did change it to add some curry powder and a bit of sugar. (Sometimes I don't even add the apple pie spice since the curry has enough unique flavor) Our friends love it and when we camp together with them they ask us to make extra.

I used walnuts instead of pecans, added celery and cranberries, used half mayonnaise and half salad dressing, and used 1/2 apple pie spice (made myself - cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice) and 1/2 curry powder.  It was excellent.  Next time, however, I will use a little more curry powder and add a touch of salt and pepper.  The family loved it though.

Apple pie spice too strong. Whole pecans give better flavor. I would not make this again. Back to chicken, celery, chopped onion, mayonnaise for me.
