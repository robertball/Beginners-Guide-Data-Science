Excellent and easy for a very novice cook.  I added some Sesame Oil to the black bean sauce for extra oriental zest.

The ingredient list was a bit daunting, but we just jumped right in and WOW was this wonderful.  I followed the recipe to the letter and the result was amazing!

The marinate/sauce was really really good but I didn't much care for the texture of the steamed fish, and the tofu was just blah. Will try it again with baked fish and will omit the tofu altogether. Thanks anyway.

We didn't want the leftovers, and that speaks a bit to the quality of the dish.
