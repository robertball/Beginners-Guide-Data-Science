Very good and healthy! I just used 1/2 cup of corn meal, and added a few dashes of onion powder and 2 Tb of parmesan cheese. Make sure to drain on paper towels before cooking.

Pretty good. I plan on playing with the spices a bit next time. I drained the zucchini by placing it in a colander first and pushing my metal mixing bowl down onto it. I then placed the mixture in a kitchen towel and folded it over, pushed a glass pie plate on top which allowed me to see how much water was being pushed out based on how wet the towel got. I am glad I did the colander first because I could have easily gone through a couple towels.

This was ok, but like the other reviews I found it to be a bit bland....it needed something. After trying a few random things, I topped one of them with Parmesan cheese and that was the ticket! Next time I'll add the cheese to the filling and that should do it!

This recipe is amazing. I gave the original recipe four stars because I added spices. I used cornmeal rather than corn muffin mix (so no sugar). I used 1/2 tsp of onion powder, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of sweet paprika, 1 tbsp of italian seasoning. Was great tasting. I made them on the smaller side as recommended by other reviewers. Would be great with cucumber dill sauce.

This was ok - I didn't have yellow squash so used all zucchini instead. I don't think I enjoyed the cornbread mix in this recipe. I did like the carrots in the recipe. I also think it needs onion and other seasonings.

Since we like anything Mexican, I used Mexican cornbread mix.  Like some of the other reviews I think it would be very bland without it.  Mine didn't get very crispy, maybe I didn't get enough water out.

I loved these!  They were very tasty.  I used Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix.  I also took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added some onion powder to make them a little less bland.  My family thought they were delicious.

Added minced  green onion & garlic, 1/2 tsp ea of garlic salt & onion powder. Cook med/med low heat; Just don't burn them. Use a teflon pan and you won't need any oil at all.

This was a nice light fritter. The corn meal was a different change and a great way to try something new with all my garden zucchini. I took advice and added 2 tbsp of spicey rub in the mix. Could have used perhaps more. My youngest put hot sauce on them and enjoyed. Easy to do.

This is definitely a stock recipe because it can be added to easily! I made changes, such as a cornmeal and breadcrumb mixture and added Parmesan. GREAT recipe to build from!

Make sure you serve these hot. I made them ahead of the rest of the meal and they would have been best hot. Next time I will add red pepper flakes or something to add a touch of heat. Otherwise a great way to incorporate veggies with a meal!

I made it pretty much the way it was written.  Was very good.  I'll probably change it slightly depending on what I'm serving with it.

I followed the exact ingredients except I used regular paprika. It turned out really good. It was a bit smushy and would fall apart easily. Next time I'll tweak it a little and add a few scotch bonnet peppers to it, a long with something more crunchy. Overall, my friends and I enjoyed it.

This was the first time I have made fritters and will do it again.  I will make sure to add more veggies to it. Not the best picture but so good!

So delicious!  Instead of carrots, I added corn.
