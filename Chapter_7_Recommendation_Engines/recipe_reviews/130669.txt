8.18.10 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/130669/blueberry-dessert/ ... First review!  Notsogood.  Not bad, just not worth making.  It looked pretty.  Blueberries sandwiched between white.  The meringue became rubbery once topped.  The crust was okay.  It didn't become crisp or too much different than it was to start with.  Too many dishes, too much time, too ho-hum to make this again.  Maybe it's one of those recipes kids like more than adults.

Seems as though there is problem with this recipe, I made it an customized it for 8 servings, it turned out very good, so then I made it for 12 as originally printed and it seems so though the pan size should change to 9x13, I put in the 8x12 as stated, the meringue was so high that it seemed hard to put on the blueberries and the whipped cream. Something is just not correct with this recipe. First pan was very good.
