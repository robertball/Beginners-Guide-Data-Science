Basel Toasted Flour Soup may have an off-putting name, but it is tasty, hearty, and traditionally eaten (but not exclusively) after "Morgenstreich" (around 6 a.m) at the Basle, Switzerland Fastnacht (Carnival) every February.

This soup is amazing, very easy to make, taste is out of this world and it looks great too.  The only thing I changed was to toast the bread with garlic and butter before topping with cheese and soup.  Thank you for sharing, yum!

I used vegetable broth instead of beef.  This soup was surprisingly good!

This was very tasty.  Not sure why but it reminded me of gravy.  However, very warm and comforting.
