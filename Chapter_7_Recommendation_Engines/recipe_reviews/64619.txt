OH MY GOD, these meat balls are amazing!!
I used only normal bread crumbs, and tomato paste, (instead of pizza sauce) and normal tomato soup with my own spices ( I liek a lot of garlic) and they still turned out soooooo gooooooood!!  This recipe is DEFINATELY a keeper!

Finally, a winning meatball recipe! My husband and oldest son are big fans of Subway's meatball sub and I have been trying to duplicate the sub for a long time. The problem is, most meatball recipes I have tried are too bland. With this recipe, I had bouillon cubes on hand, so I used 2 crushed cubes. I made the meatballs a little larger than the recipe calls for and I used Prego traditional sauce instead of italian herb tomato soup, since I could not find that flavor of soup. I put the meatballs on french bread and hoagie buns and topped them with shredded mozarella. Thanks for helping me perfect the meatball sub for my family!

my children love subway meatball sandwiches and after reading the great review i tried them... my kids said they were even better than subway and already want me to make them again---the only thing i changed was i used spaghetti sauce instead of the soup and i didn't put my moz.cheese on until after the meatball were done, and i just let the cheese melt on the meatballs.  great recipe!!!

I would've given it a one because I couldn't stand it.  I was glad I had zucchini around to make zucchini grinders.  My family loved this recipe, though, so I gave it a four.

My picky husband loved it!  I have never made spaghetti with meatballs before, which is one of my husbands favorite dishes, and now he is complaining that I've been holding out on him for 5 years!  After browning them, I put them in the spaghetti sauce and let them simmer for about 30 mins.

This came out wonderful!  I used 2 lbs. of hamburger and doubled the recipe and made bigger meatballs.  They had a wonderful taste and were some of the best meatballs that I've ever had.  We made mashed potatoes with it and that went perfectly with it.  Lots of leftovers!

This turned out awesome, I didn't think it would make so many meat balls, but it did and the family keeps asking me to make them again.

Good 'all purpose' meatball, great for when you're in a hurry. I just made the meatballs and skipped the sauce, baked them at 350 F for 25 minutes. Also I just shaved down and crushed 2 buillion cubes to cut down the salt a bit. Will make it again.

Very Good! This is the perfect recipe for meatballs. I used Italian Seasonings in the mix and baked for 30 mins. Turned out perfect!

I thought this recipes was easy and tasted great!!   I only made 21 meatballs but I didn't make them incredibly small.  I added 1/2 tsp dried basil and 1/2 tsp dried oregano to a regular can of tomato soup and it came out great!!!   I will definitely make this again!

I found it to be bland. I didn't use italian tomato soup though so maybe that is where I went wrong. However I made meatball sandwiches on chiabatta buns (god bless chiabatta buns) added cayenne, tomato, it was a good sandwich. I'll probably try something else before I repeat this recipe.

These meatballs were very tasty. I made them for our Christmas Eve buffet table. I couldn't find the tomato soup listed in the recipe, so I used regular tomato soup and added Italian seasoning. This was very easy and quick to make. I will make again.

These were yummy and SO EASY!  They turned out great even with it being my first time making meatballs.  I did make some changes based on others reviews and our personal preferences.  I substituted 2 crushed beef bouillion cubes for the granules, onion powder for the onion, and egg substitute for the egg.  Also, instead of tomato soup, I used the same pizza sauce that I had used in the meatballs (Chef Boyardee).  We served them as meatball sandwiches, and my picky husband went back for seconds, thirds, and leftovers!

These made wonderful meatball sandwiches. I used spaghetti sauce instead of the soup. After baking the meatballs I filled sub rolls and topped with sliced mozzarella, then wrapped each sandwich in foil and continued baking for about 10 minutes.

Very nice recipe. Husband said, "These are some great meatballs!" Served on spaghetti pasta and a great Chianti Classico wine.

Fantastic recipe!  I used pasta sauce instead of soup and used extra so I could serve with spaghetti.
