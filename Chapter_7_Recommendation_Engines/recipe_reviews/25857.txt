This is loved everywhere I take it but a few things different in mine.
Mix softened cream cheese and 1 Tblsp of Milk with electric mixer.  And 1 Tablespoon Garlic powder 1/4 of a small onion finely chopped and 1/4 of the Cocktail jar.  Mix well with electric mixer.  Then put on platter, cover with well drained baby shrimp and the rest of the cocktail sauce.  Chill in fridge an hour serve with crackers.

Classic!  Very appealing and easy.  I beat the cream cheese with 4 oz. sour cream just to make it creamier and easier to scoop up with crackers.

This is great!!! I don't use canned shrimp. I use fresh shrimp and I put the cocktail sauce over the cream cheese and then put the shrimp over the cocktail sauce. It is great for parties!!!

I have used this recipe for years & it's excellent!  I do prefer to use fresh shrimp.  I use wheat thins as a cracker to dip them with... yum!  **Please note though, the cocktail sauce can make a world of difference, so make sure you use something you know you like!

This is just one of those classic recipes. Simple yet delicious, my mom always made this for company. Instead of layering the ingredients though she mixed it all together into a lovely pink dip. I can never get enough of it.

I made this with a few changes, I made my own cocktail sauce (Katchup and hoursradish) because I like more horseradishy zipI threw all the ingredients in a blender and then chilled it in a bowl, served with potato chips and it is AMAZING!

I'm not a huge fan of shrimp but this shrimp dip is very good.  I used 2 cans of shrimp mixed with 1 bottle of zesty chili sauce.  I also added approx. 1/2 cup sour cream to the cream cheese for a better texture and for the ease of spreading/scooping.  Top this dip off with 2 cups of shredded mild cheddar cheese and use Tostito brand "scoops" for scooping the dip....YUM!!

This is always a hit.  I use an easier and more appealing presentation, though.  I simply place the block of cream cheese on a serving plate, pour the drained and chilled shrimp over it, then the cocktail sauce. Serve with a small cheese spreader for spreading on crackers.   Very elegant.  And easier!

Another attractive way to serve: On crackers, spread a layer of cream cheese, then shrimp mixed with the cocktail sauce, and garnish with green onions.

I like to mix the cream cheese with some cocktail sauce first, then layer a little more sauce, then put the shrimp on the top and serve with crackers.  Mixing the cream cheese with some cocktail sauce first makes it easier to dip the crackers into it.  I always make this dip for parties and it is always gone!  Yummy!

I have had this dip before and loved it, but I didn't like it very much when I made it myself. Maybe it was the type of cocktail sauce I used? It was also difficult to dip my bagel crackers int it. They would break every time i tried to scoop up some of the cream cheese.

It really is very easy and it was loved by everyone which is even better. I doubled the recipe and made my own cocktail sauce. Ketchup, horseradish and lemon juice. You can add a little brown sugar if you don't like it too spicy. Just keep adding and tasting until you like it.

This is good - you need to really drain and blot the shrimp, then chill before putting them on the cocktail sauce.

Although thre taste is good, I made this for a buffet style party, but found that with the crackers, my guests were not getting to the cheese layer. So in the future I will either put the shrimp into the cream cheese or use a heartier cracker. I put a spoon in the dish, but noticed guests were using the crackers to scoop out the dip, thereby not getting to the cheesy layer.

I feel bad to be the only one not thrilled with this recipe. I think for people that need quick and easy this is the way to go. However, if you want flavor I would suggest do not do this recipe.

This is theee best appetizer! PLEASE try THIS cocktail sauce...you will never try another..it TOTALLY makes the dip.  It's simply called "Homemade Chili Sauce" It's in a cute little round jar with a tiny black and white label, white lid.  I find it at Raley's, Scolaris, Albertsons...NOT Walmart.  It's sweet and amazing with the shrimp (shrimp should be frozen from the deli) We've made this for as long as I can remember, please try the sauce..its not the same without it!!

So easy, and soooo tasty. For a good shrimp appetizer the budget was just right. I used light cream cheese and, as another reviewer suggested, I added a little light sour cream also.

I mix all the ingredients together with a dollop of sour cream. It becomes a pretty pink dip that is much easier to scoop. I use frozen (thawed) salad shrimp and serve it with wheat thins. Love it!

Mix cream cheese with finely chopped onion and green pepper.....add layer of shrimp...pour on the chili sauce....sprinkle top with finely shredded mozzarella and finely chopped scallion greens.............serve with a small spread utensil because crackers will break if you try to scoop (until the cheese warms to room temp, anyway)

I wanted an easy recipe for shrimp dip.  I used 2 packages of cream cheese, beat it to soften with 2 Tbsp light Miracle Whip, blended about 2 handfuls of thawed frozen shrimp cut fine and a couple of oz of cocktail sauce. Tasty and easy. Thanks for the idea~

Love this recipe but only when the ingredients are mixed together to make a lovely, creamy pink dip.  Most of the time I use fresh shrimp and coarsely chop them after poaching.  I usually add a little prepared horseradish or a few drops of hot sauce and some fresh lemon juice.  We enjoy it with Fritos or Bugles.

The idea is wonderful. I just didn't have enough cream cheese. We had only 2/3's of a block left after having bagels. I used what I had, and added some sour cream to make it stretch. Got a little runny with the sour cream.
I discovered it is really good as a spread on rye toast. Thanks!

My Fiance makes this all the time... he calls it his "wicked good dip"... it's literally one of the only edible things he makes haha... he used fresh mini salad shrimp bc they are smaller and easier to scoop onto a triscuit

This is virtually the same as Easy Shrimp Dip recipe on this site. This is an oldie but goodie. I like to vary my shrimp dip and add tabasco, pepper, cream of shrimp soup, mix well and refrigerate overnight.

I doctor mine up a bit.  I use a mixer and add a little sour cream to soften the cream cheese.  I spread the mixture on a platter, sprinkle it lightly with garlic powder, add some minced onion (lightly press into the cream cheese with rubber spatula), pour and spread sauce evenly with the same spatula. I then sprinkle it with shredded cheddar cheese and well drained shrimp! (If I have green onions on hand I skip minced onion and sprinkle top with green onion.)

This is the same recipe I use, only I add a little dried parsley for color and a dash of salt and pepper.  Very good recipe!

I think I was the only one that ate this at our little get together. I liked it okay, maybe I should have added a little Old Bay in hindsight. It was super cheap and easy though, so 4 stars. On the recipes defense, I did have a lot of other great apps out, so maybe that was it :)

Very easy and very delish! I have made this several times and each time I have used different type of shrimp...small canned shrimp, big shrimp, i have even used immitation crab meat and its just wonderful.i chopped green onions and sprinkled on top. Goes great with any type of cracker.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for a few reasons.  It is sooo easy to make.. i think it took me about 5 whole minutes.  It's a great seafood dip for a fraction of the cost of some other seafood dips we love such as crab dip but it is just as good.  Everybody loved it and ate it up.  Already planning on using for my next party..

Easy and pretty tasty. I combined all the ingredients together instead of layering them and it sit in the fridge for an hour. I might add a little more spice next time...maybe a touch of horseradish. I might try this with fresh shrimp next time.

This is an old family favorite and we just love it! I prefer it with a can of crab meat rather than shrimp. What is also tasty is to mix together the cream cheese, shrimp and cocktail sauce, rather than layer it---it makes a great dip for potato chips (make sure you use the ripply ones!)

I make this same recipe every year during the Christmas holidays for get-togethers - everyone loves it and can't believe how easy it is to make - I serve it with those little crackers with the poppyseeds in them.. Yum!!

I made this "as is" and I found it to be boring. Made it for a pitch in and got mixed reviews there. Needed more zip.  I think if I make it again, I will use a spicier sauce and/or add other ingredients to kick it up a notch... thus not being a very easy shrimp dip!

I love this recipe and have taken it to many potlucks for the past 30 years. I like to mix the cream cheese with a little sour cream so it is not too firm and add onion and garlic powder to it for little extra kick. I also use FRESH baby shrimp and top it with salt and pepper. You can substitute chives for green onions and serve it with Ritz crackers. It's yummy!

I made this dip with Super Al's Cocktail Sauce (found on this site), as I didn't have any in the bottle.  I also made a shrimp stock with the shells of fresh shrimp and added it to the mixture.  It was great!

This is a simple recipe my family usually makes around the holidays. We like Wheat Thins the best with this dip.
