Tasted great!  I baked the chicken, instead of grilling, at 400 degrees, and it was very juicy and tender.  Also, I wrapped each chicken breast in aluminum foil because there was so much stuffing.  I will definitely make this again!

Very colorful and great tasting. Easy to make!I baked the chicken covered in the oven for 60 minutes at 350 degrees. The last 15 minutes I removed the foil.

Another crowd pleaser. I did make some alteration to lower the fat content. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast. Flatten them to about 1/2 inch thick and rolled the stuffing. It was fantastic. 

I can see myself using this recipe over and over again.

This was delicious.....I scaled it back to just use 2 chicken breasts for my husband and I- Instead of cutting a pocket for the filling, I pounded them thin and rolled the filling up and wrapped in foil.  Also, Instead of marinating the chicken ahead of time ( I forgot) I just dredged the chicken in the marinade before rolling and wrapping in foil.  I baked in the oven at 400 deg. for about 40 min or so.  Delicious!

I had a hard time getting the cut for the pocket deep enough...  so all my filling oozed out and baked onto the dish.  Over all it was tasty, but not tasty enough for all the hassle involved.  Doubt I'd make it again.

This is so good. My husband doesn't like most vegetables, but he LOVES this chicken. It's just a very nice, light flavor. We've made this twice and both times we had it with roasted red potatoes and sauteed asparagus. Yum! I'll make this again and again.

I grilled for a few mintures and then baked!  This was so yummy.  Next time I think I might grill the chicken for 10 minutes or so and then add the stuffing and bake it.  I also think the peppers would be really yummy grilled if you want to go through all the work!
