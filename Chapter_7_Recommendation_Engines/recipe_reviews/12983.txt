This is a great starter recipe for chicken stock, although I’m not sure if it’s a true stock, simply because by definition a stock is made from liquid, veggies and bones… the internals of the bones producing a richer texture than broth. In addition, stocks are traditionally cooked longer (several hours). In contrast, a broth is an aromatic liquid made by simmering water with meat and veggies for an hour or so.
The process of clarifying the liquid is called building a “raft” and it’s something we had to perfect within the first few weeks at the Culinary Institute. Rafts can be simply eggs, or they can be a combination of eggs and other ingredients. For example, the rafts we made at the CIA included eggs tomato, onion, leek, celery, etc. Not only did it clear the liquid, in addition the ingredients flavored it. The whole theory behind a raft is that denatured proteins (the ingredients in the raft) attract cooked proteins. Once more thing… Once a stock is clarified, it changes names to a consommé.
And now you know the rest of the story…

First off, for your mirepoix you should have 2 parts onion to one part carrots and one part celery.  You should never add salt to a stock since this is just supposed to be a base for soups which will be seasoned with salt when cooked.  Clove??? A general sachet for chicken (white) stock calls for bay leaves, dried thyme, crushed peppercorns, and parsley stems.  Cold water optional????  Never used warm or hot water to start your stock, alway used cold water, you learn that in cooking 101!!  And remember, a chicken stock is made with chicken bones only, no meat!! if you are using meat instead of bones then you are making a broth not a stock.  If you constantly skim off the impurities that float to the surface while cooking, there is no need for this egg technique to clarify your broth.  Also, for the mirepoix, 1 inch chunks is a little too big for chicken stock, you normally use 1 inch piece of mirepoix when making a dark stock like veal stock which is cooked for about 20 hours, for chicken (white stock) you should cut your mirepoix no larger than 1/2 inch to impart more flavor into your stock.   Also, you could also cook the stock longer than the suggested time, doing so will draw out more flavor from the bones and mirepoix.  If you want to make dark chicken stock, simply bake the bones until browned on both sides and carmelize the mirepoix (not the celery, since its mostly water and will stop the carmelization process) before adding to stockpot. Hope this helps!!

This was delicious!  I had a few pounds of split bone-in breasts that needed to be used and this was exactly what I wanted.  I added a clove of garlic and some peppercorns into the mix.  When the chicken was cooked through I took it out, pulled the meat off and tossed the bones back in for a little while.  The resulting broth is so rich and delicious, it's wonderful!  Since I made quite a lot, I'm freezing it in 4-cup increments.  Boil some noodles and veggies in it, put the pre-cooked chicken back in and it makes such a yummy soup and it has a "cooked all day" taste, even though you can make it in about 20 minutes.

This was so good, I almost ate it without adding the noodles!  My 9-year old called it "the best broth ever." I added a bay leaf and some freshly ground black pepper.

I used this to clarify my stock.  When making stock I always add a turnip, parsley stalks, peppercorns and a slice on fresh lemon.  This adds to the flavor. The cooking time should be 2-3 hours.

Wow!  I am in shock at how easy it is to make your own stock.  The taste is so much better than any canned stock I have tried.  I am so happy to find a wonderful stock recipe.  I made Grandma's chicken noodle soup with this stock.  AWESOME!!

10 stars for me...my first pot of homemade stock and it was amazing....I used the carcass from a 7ilb roaster that I made "Sticky Rotis. Chicken" from this site (so there were lots of spices still attached to it. I also omitted the cloves and did not do the egg trick. I did add 3 cloves of garlic which I just smashed and threw in, 2 bay leaves and some dry thyme leaves. Dark, rich and so delicious....made a wonderful chicken soup with this and froze the rest of the stock. Thanks!

Made the stock....but wanted to share my cheap discovery.  I usually buy boneless chicken breast...so I don't think to save chicken carcass to make stock. I go to the 99 Ranch Market in Houston(Very nice Asian Market) and buy the chicken carcass. I paid $2.00 for two of them. This is extremely convenient for me since I only make stock about twice a year..and it's not something I plan ahead to do since it's just me.  Don't want to overload my freezer with bones I "may" use in the future.  Makes for a great stock!

Logan, adding the egg and shell to clear the broth is my favorite cooking tip of the year. I have been telling everyone! My broth is crystal clear now and I have made it twice this month. It takes the greasy flavor out and you taste the chicken instead, and I'm guessing it must lower the calories as well. Bravo!

haven't made this yet, but I wanted to thank you Logan for sharing your professional knowledge and education. I soak it up when professionals stop by here to teach those of us that are craving such knowledge! Even for something as simple as chicken stock.

Yummy!!! This is so much better than canned and well worth the effort. My additions: Italian parsley which I grow, black pepper, 2 bay leaves. I used a pkg. of leg quarters; removed the chicken after 30 min so it wouldn't dry out, also the vegetables; returned the bones to the pot for about 45 min. I didn't do the clarifying part, may try that next time. Then made Tortellini Soup.

This was really good and the technique of the egg was something I had never done before. I will, that it did lack a lot of flavor, hence it's a basic chicken stock. It really did a great job with the chicken, my chicken was very juicy and tender and was falling to pieces. It diffently helped enhance the chicken noodle soup that I also made from this site. I would enhance the stock with a blend of italian seasonings next time. But this is a total keeper.

Used frozen chicken breasts, baby carrots and the conversion for ground cloves and it worked great. I was using this in a pot pie recipe so I didn't need to clarify but the taste of the pot pie was amazing! I'm making it now for broth needed in chicken lasagna. :)

This made a really nice, flavorful, yellow chicken broth. G proportions of meat/water/vegetables.  I'm assuming the "cloves" meant garlic.  Also, good to note that there's no bay leaf in this recipe...bay leaf belongs in soup, imo, but not in broth.

This was the first I had heard of using an egg to clarify the stock, and it worked BEAUTIFULLY! My stock was already on the stove when I came across this, so I didn't use the same recipe, but I'm giving it 5 stars for revolutionizing the way I handle a homemade chicken noodle soup craving..I was ready to eat it greasy, so thank you!

I used chicken carcasses from the Roast Sticky chicken recipe from this site.  I tossed in all the veggies listed here and some leeks, as well as some peppercorns.  I simmered it for about 1 1/2 - 2 hours.  Great basic stock!

This turned out amazing!! I used some frozen chicken carcasses, added bayleaf, garlic, and some peppercorns, simmered for several hours...strained...refrigerated....once cooled..skimmed fat...and froze in ice cube trays (4 full cubes = 1/4 cup {approx}) keep in freezer bag ready to use....soooo much better than store bought!! UPDATE...I have found that roasting the carcass along with the vegetables and onions adds another level of flavor to the stock.

Easy to do!  I added poultry spice, basil and thyme then simmered for 2 and a half hours.  Very yummy and could eat it on it's own.

This was fantastic! I didn't clarify it. I stuck it in the fridge and after the fat got hard I picked it off and tossed it. I didn't need it to be clear. The flavor was outstanding! I didn't know it could be so easy to make stock/broth. I may never use store bought again!!!

This is a delicious, natural recipe & the best of the many stock recipes I have tried. I used 4 lbs inexpensive chicken parts & water to cover. Yield was 4 cups excellent stock which I froze. In addition to the veggies mentioned in the recipe, I added a few peeled garlic cloves, fresh parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and a few peppercorns.

I made this in the "Basic" form. I did add some salt and pepper to the mix and added 4 cubes of chicken bullion as I added a little extra water. I did use the clarifying method mentioned in the recipe and it worked great! After it cooled down I put the stock in zip lock sandwich bags. (2c per bag and froze them laying flat on a cookie sheet. I then put those in a 1 gal. zip lock to keep them together. I didn't get wild on the spices as I don't know what the stock will always be used for. At least this is the way my old brain works!! 8^)

This is a good stock and easy. You might want to try throwing all the chicken and veggies in the stock pot and cooking until juices are released from the chicken THEN adding the amount of water you'll need and simmering for a few hours. The broth turns out rich and delicious.

I tripled the recipe and instead of cloves, I used 9 garlic cloves, basically a whole bulb of garlic.  I added 9 peppercorns, 2 bay leaves and a bunch of fresh parsley including the stems and doubled the salt.  Wow, this was so clever and easy to make.  While I was making this I baked some fresh Sweet Potatoes.  MMMM *** I will use this recipe all the time***  UPDATE:  I used this stock in Mama Mandola's Spicy Chicken Soup that had called for water and wow it made the soup 100% better, (I also added Chili Powder, red pepper flakes and other spices to that recipe)!  Again, thank you for posting this easy and yummy stock recipe!

I knew I wanted to make stock, but I had no idea what to do. This was a great starter recipe. I only used 1/2 an onion (skin on), added 2 cloves of garlic, and omitted the cloves. I simmered for 1 hour uncovered, 2 hours covered. I cooled and refrigerated, skimmed the fat off and repeated. I did this 3 times until there was almost no trace of visible fat. It came out very nicely. I didn't use the egg method, as I really didn't need clear broth, but that's good to know. Thanks :)

This recipe was excellent and so easy!  I took another reviewer's advice and added a turnip, parsley stalks, and some pepper.  Who knew making your own stock was so easy?  As an added bonus, your whole house smells wonderful while its cooking.  I cooked it for 2 hours.

I love the instructions on clarifying! Thank you! I also add bay leaf, nix the cloves and add peppercorns. Also, I used the carcass of a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store that we had for supper the night before. Now I feel proud of myself for being so thrifty :)

I use this recipe often.  I make it with a whole chicken instead of parts and use the cooked meat in other recipes.  I double the ingredients (omitting the salt) and use enough water to cover the chicken by an inch or so in an 8 quart stockpot.  Once cool, I freeze in individual containers.  Well worth the effort!

This is fantastic. I combined this recipe with a soup recipe I had (b/c I was too lazy to make stock and THEN soup) and made the following changes: no cloves, salted to taste (with kosher salt), didn't clarify,  doubled the recipe, used 5 carrots, 5 big potatoes, 4 bay leaves, a chicken carcass (I removed the legs and breasts for another recipe), 2 wings, 2 breasts, and two parsnips (1 big, 1 small). I added the potatoes (cut in .75-1 inch chunks) after simmering the soup for 1 hour. They were done after 20-30 minutes of simmering. Then I flaked any meat off the bones, returned the meat to the soup, and discarded the bones. This makes a fabulous soup. I'll definitely repeat it and probably try adding egg noodles next time.

I haven't used this recipe yet (but I couldn't post without a star rating so I gave it a 4 because it's so similar to how I make stock) but when I make chicken stock I strain it using a jelly bag. Gets out the tiny little flecks of herb particles so I get a nice clear stock. It also takes out a lot of the fat.

This was a very easy recipe.  I used a cut up frying chicken from my local meat market.  As it was just over 3 pounds I tripled the recipe.  This gave me enough rick stock for chicken noodle soup (from this site) and to also freeze multiple 1 cup portions for future use.  Wonderful recipe.

I made this using two large chicken breasts (bone-in, skin on) and without cloves. I had a can of chicken broth so threw that in as well. I did not clarify it either. I took everything out of the pot to boil some noodles then added it all back in. It was delicious.

In honesty, I am not overly impressed with this recipe.  I'm sorry.  Maybe it's because I doubled it.  I believe it was the cloves that ruined it for me. I was looking to try something different then my own way and I'm glad I did :)  Thanks for sharing it, but i will not be making this again.

It needed some herbs, but that's why it's a BASIC chicken stock--easy to personalize. :) I added some peppercorns, fresh garlic, parsley, basil, thyme, and oregano. Turned out delicious.

I was just going to use this for the broth but the veggies tasted so good I had to make a soup! I used a chicken carcass, didnt have any cloves but thew in some peppercorn. Cooked for 3 hours. Will never throw out the chicken bones again.  This was great and so easy!

I have never made soup stock before. I really expected this to taste like flavored water, but it is fabulous. I can't believe how good it is. Trust me, if I can make it, anyone can make it.

This sounds exactly like my own chicken stock recipe except for the cloves.  I use whole allspice.  In addition, I add garlic cloves or dried minced garlic for extra flavor and cook it longer to make a nice rich stock.

Excellent basic stock recipe. I make sure that all fat/skin is removed from the chicken before I put it in the pot, and I usually use a whole fryer.

I stopped making stock years ago because I could never get it clear enough! The egg shell/white step works GREAT and the recipe would get a 5 star for that alone.

It is cheaper to buy a low sodium stock than to make this.  The instructions to clearify the stock are great, but that is the highest praise I can give it.  After it had simmered for an hour it still tasted like salt water, so I let it sinner for 2.5 hours.  The stock cooked down, but it wasn't very flavorful.  I won't waste my tine with it again.

A great basic recipe for stock - we use it all the time after we make the Roasted Vegetable Chicken recipe (listed on this site) (using just the bones and what's left on them).  Thanks so much for the recipe!

It was an amazing recipe to start with. I had made a few changes in the recipe after reading some of the comments and did some research. For the mirepox, i made 2 parts of onions to 1part of carrot and celery. Added 2-3 bay leaves, dried thyme and crushed peppercorns. Eliminated the salt as I will be adding salt in the soup I will be making later with the stock. I place all the ingredients at night in the slow-cooker, and the next morning, voila, the chicken stock is ready. It smells sooooo nice and taste good too! Thanks for all the tips and comments!

This is perfect chicken broth!  The first time I made this I followed the recipe to the T.  But I'm not into cloves so the next time I didn't put any in and it was perfect!  I make this every few weeks, without the cloves and use it as a regular staple.  And the kids love it!

I made this stock to flavor my rice so I didn't add much meat, mostly vegetables.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of herbs.  I skipped the egg step and just put it through a strainer.  Good!

Excellent! I had never made my own stock before, but there was too much meat on my leftover Thanksgiving turkey bones to just throw it away. I finally used my stock pot for something besides bobbing for apples, and the stock was so delicious!

Very good recipe, I did add fresh parsley form my garden, only cause my family loves in chicken soup. I am planning on canning this broth so I have it on hand this winter for soups. Won't be buying store bought broth anymore :) Thanks for the recipe

This recipe is great, except for the cloves.  They give a weird taste to the broth.  I have made it several times substituting peppercorns for the cloves.  Then it is a lovely clear broth great for soups.

I thought this was a great recipe.  Next time i may add some garlic and a bay leaf.  (Only to enhance... not to make better.)  I didn't need to clarify but I did skim the fat off the top once it cooled a bit.

Perfect, basic chicken stock. It was my first time making chicken stock, and the cloves threw me off. But it tasted great!

Needed to use up some chicken legs I had defrosted in order to make room in the freezer.  This was perfect. It’s back in the freezer now as stock. Will use it for next week for Thanksgiving fixings.

Made this recipe for my family without any changes except I used ground cloves since that's what I had on hand and everyone from my 2 year to my grandma was fighting over the last bowl. I have made stock before but this put the others to shame. My mother couldn't wait for the noodles to be added. It was gone in minutes!

Rich, incredible flavor.  I used the giblets, back, neck, and leftover bits after I cut up a chicken.  I strained it but didn't clarify it.  Froze it for later use.

It would be helpful if you gave how many servings a recipe makes so we can figure out how big a "serving" is. Haven't made it yet but it sounds good.

It might have been the white onions I used, but the stock turned out extremely sweet, which is a little disconcerting for a soup base!  I added extra salt, a little black pepper, and some powdered garlic (oh the shame).  I also threw in the bones from a rotisserie chicken to give it a little heft.

This recipe is directly out the Better Homes and Gardens "New Cook Book." My edition is Dom 1986 that was passed down to me from my mom. How can you go wrong with BH&G?! Traditional and delicious.

I had been searching for a method for clarifying broths/stocks this is
fabulous method.  This produced a delicious stock and is a relatively
simple method,easily got the results I was hoping to achieve,even for a
minimally experienced cook.  Definitely a keeper. Thank you Logan

I make chicken broth every time I cook either a whole or cut up chicken.  Just put the giblets in a pot with 4-6 cups of water and add celery, onion, parsley, bayleaf and salt and pepper. If cut up chicken, add the wings and back.  simmer 30 min to 1 hour, cool and strain, then freeze in 2 cup portions in zipper bags. It's easy and I never run out of broth. I was glad to see the instructions for clarifying, however my broth usually doesn't need it.
