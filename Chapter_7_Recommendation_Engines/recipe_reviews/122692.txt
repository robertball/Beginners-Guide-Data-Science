This was fantastic. I needed a few more eggs in order to fill up my 9x11 pan and added a lot more bacon and cheese than it called for originally.  Everyone loved it and it was even better the next day.  I can't wait to try this again!

Very tasty! I made this last night and it was very good and everyone loved it. I also added some red and green peppers and tomatoes to frittata. It came out wonderful!

I served this recipe for the first time on Christmas morning and everybody loved it! I have repeated this recipe adding baked potato at the bottom, ham or egg substitute and it always comes out great.  The secret for this recipe is the cheese, don't be afraid to use it in massive quantities.

Using the same egg mixture, I tried it with other fillings too: Cubed Ham, Sliced Roma Tomatoes and Swiss; Onions, Roma Tomatoes & Green Peppers. Also, I baked them in muffin pans for individual servings and topped them w/ fresh Salsa.  YUMMO!

This is yummy and SO easy! I've made this half-a-dozen times, usually adding chopped green and red pepper to add more color. As the recipe advises, cook long enough so that the middle isn't runny.

My husband requested a quiche for breakfast and I'm doing low carb. So,not trusting myself not to eat the crust, I decided to try a frittata. Basicly a quiche without the crust. This was very good! My hubby and I both enjoyed this. I now have a delicious and low carb breakfast that we both enjoy! Wow! thats great! Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

Five stars for taste, ease of preparation and aesthetic appeal.  So versatile!  Add whatever you might put in an omelet or scrambled eggs.  Great way to use up vegetables in the fridge too!  In this case I browned the bacon, drained most of the grease, added finely chopped multi-colored bell peppers and onions, briefly sauteed that, then added it to my beaten eggs (which I just mixed with salt and pepper and half-and-half) along with some sliced black olives and garden fresh chives.  I baked it in a pretty, shallow buttered casserole.  No muss, no fuss, free to do other things while it baked, and it cut into individual servings perfectly.  This will definitely be a re-do.

I've made this for guests several times now.  It's easy to put together and walk away to do other things.  I add extra cheese.  I use a rectangular glass dish and it takes mine 10-15 minutes longer to bake.

Great flavor and easy to make with ingredients around the house.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for 45 minutes. Although the frittata firmed up nicely , there was a runny residue at the bottom of the pan that turned my kids off.

This was very light and fluffy and not at all dry. I think I might add a bit more bacon next. I served this with sauteed mushrooms and there wasnt a scrap left. Thanks

YUM! Everyone enjoyed this. I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup, and for the bacon I used 1/2 cup of Oscar Meyer "Real Bacon Pieces" (found in the salad dressing aisle @ the store). Per another reviewer's suggestion, I used sharp white cheddar (1.5 cups) and added caramelized onions (omitted green onion). Baked for almost 40 minutes in my oven...

VERY good recipe, I am a single working woman and can't always find  the time to cook when I do, i like to cook more than I need for a later date.  For this recipe, instead of using a baking pan, I used a muffin pan and made individual portions...they came out great. The rest can be frozen and used when needed!

Very, very good recipe. I like this because it doesn't stuff you and weigh you down like other breakfast casseroles.
I paired this with the recipe for> Featherlight Scones...wonderful combination.

This was my first attempt at baking a frittata. The baking dish I used was only 8 X 8 so I ended up baking it for 5 minutes longer than the recipe called for but it was fantastic. It was light and fluffy and delicious. Great recipe, I will definitely make it again. I'm going to check out the variations now and maybe try one of those.

Easy, filling, and delicious.  I substituted the green onions for 1/4 cup chopped yellow onion and a little bit of chopped green bell pepper.  I sauteed the onions and pepper in the bacon grease before adding to the egg mixture.

Why anyone would make quiche anymore is beyond me!  No fattening, soggy crust and easy still doesn't describe this frittata!  New Years Day brunch made easy....overnight french toast, a bacon and scallion frittata, a tomato, mushroom and leek frittata, spiral ham, sour cream coffee cake and easy company potatoes! Yum!

This was delicious and so easy! I increased the amount of cheese and bacon ( because my family's motto is "Anything worth doing is worth over-doing!") and I used peppered bacon because it's what I had in the fridge.  Loved it!!

This was an excellent dinner that the whole family enjoyed.  I thought that six eggs would not be enough, so I brought the recipe up to 10 servings and it was the perfect amount for a 9x13 cooked for 35 minutes.  I mixed a little ham into the egg mixture before putting cheese and bacon on top and it was a little salty.  We are thinking that adding some diced tomato will help next time.  We actually brainstormed as a family the items that we would like to have in it the next time (spinach, black beans, a layer of mashed or shredded potatoes on the bottom, feta...)

Simple, straight forward, great for a quick meal.   Added a couple eggs, will likely  reduce the amt of milk next time for less "jiggle".

This was a great base.  At another reviewer's recommendation, I added some diced potatoes.  I also added a pinch of onion and garlic powder.

I made this, but thought a full one cup of milk sounded like an awful lot for 6 eggs, so I cut the milk in half.  I was in a rush and inadvertently put the onion and cheese in with the eggs, rather than sprinkling them on top.  After discovering my error, I purposely didn’t add the bacon until I was plating the frittata and just sprinkled it on top.  This was good, but too salty for us and we like salt!  Another objection I have with this recipe is the use of an 11x7 baking dish, which resulted in a really flat, skinny frittata.  If I make this again, I will be sure to use a smaller baking dish, maybe an 8x8.

I've been making this recipe weekly for awhile now and I have never used milk or butter, it's not necessary. After experimenting/seeing friends & family taste tester reactions this is the best: For 9x9 pan use 9 eggs, some chopped spinach leaves, a buttload of cooked bacon and tons of shredded cheddar cheese. Mushrooms too if you want. Sprinkle some cheese on top.

This was very good.  I added some chopped parsely, tiny chopped red bell pepper and sliced scallions and black olives to the top for decoration.  It really looked beautiful.  I made it in traditional fritata style, on the stove top and finished it in the oven.  I think I used too large of a skillet, as I would have liked the fritata a bit thicker.  So that is a change I will make next time.  You can get most of the components ready the night before, and just put it together in a minute or two.  It really is an easy and impressive breakfast or brunch dish.

This was very good and made only one change. Instead of putting the mix in a pie dish, I used cup cake tins to make individual servings.

Great base!  The measurements seem to be right on though I chose to add a little extra cheese and bacon.  I also sauteed some dice mushrooms in the butter until all the liquid had evaporated and then added this to the eggs.  Very good!  I will definitely make this again and again!!

This recipe is awesome...and versatile!! I didn't have any bacon, so I used Brown & Serve sausage (cooked and cut into small pieces). And from other reviewers, I added 1/4 cup chopped green pepper and 1 Roma tomato...and way more than 1 cup cheese!   Just my husband and I ate almost the whole dish w/English Muffins (but we're ranchers and eat big breakfasts). Definitely a keeper and will be used many times when we have overnight guests. Thanks Diana! UPDATE: Made this again this AM and added 1 cup frozen shredded hashbrowns, which was a nice touch. My husband liked it better with the potatoes in it...I like it both ways!

Great base for making all kinds of frittatas.  My favorite variation is to caramelize a white onion, use a medium cheddar (or sharp if you want a little more cheesy Bite), add a dash or two of Tabasco and cubed, smoked ham.  My sister has used the same base and added Feta cheese and spinach and left out the bacon, green onions and cheddar.  Yum!

OMG, thanks for the recipe!  I had to make changes, because it was 10 o clock at night and I was making it last minute for breakfast the next morning.  Its a good basic recipe to add what you like!  I only had maple bacon and a colby cheese blend, so that was the subsitutes I made, I also added diced mushrooms,  because we love them.  I'm telling you, that put it over the top for me.  I have nothing negative to say!!  Thanks again!

I made this recipe being very careful to count calories.  I used 6 eggs, 5 slices of thick cut bacon and 3 oz of cheddar for the cup of shredded cheese.  I skipped the onions as I am allergic. I used skim milk, and promise spread for the butter - that cut down the total calories for the recipe tremendously!  I went by the packaging values on every ingredient.  It turned out very well and tasted great!

This recipe is delish!! I didn't have green onions, so I sauteed white onion as the bacon was frying. And I added 1/2 cup frozen spinach. This recipe is so versatile, I think I'll add mushrooms next time! Try it!

Very quick and easy to assemble. Family loved it (honestly, I didn't think they'd go for breakfast at dinner but they did!). Served it with warm bread and a green salad. Could be easily adapted to whatever veggies you have.

Simple and tasty!  I made as directed, using center cut bacon and reduced fat cheese to lighten it up a bit.  Also, I left out the onions (personal preference).  This is great as is, but I think it would also be a good main course with the addition of some sauteed peppers and mushrooms.

this is a great recipe, makes a beautiful light dinner.  You can use whatever vegatables or meat you have.  I dont add melted butter, just use a little to saute the veggies first. I will definately make it again and again. Thanks

This was really, really good.  The only thing I will say is that it says it is six servings, but I made it for 5 of us and I could have really used another one for sure.

Absolutely delicious! So quick, simple and tasty - and such a good starting point for lots of other variations. Maybe Indian style, with curry seasoning and roasted chicken instead of the bacon; maybe Italian style with chopped sausage and basil; maybe Spanish style, with chorizo and jalapenos.... Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a perfect "springboard" recipe -- a basic foundation to which I can add whatever I have available for a particular meal.  I've made it twice now, once with bacon (my favorite) and once with sliced turkey sausage links (a bit bland).  I add: 1/4 cup each diced red and green peppers and a couple of garlic cloves (all of which I saute with the onions in the bacon drippings), a small chopped tomato, some fresh parsley, and a few dashes of tabasco.  I leave out the melted butter, and in contrast to a previous reviewer, I reduce the amount of cheese to a modest sprinkling on top to cut down on fat.  In a square 9x9 baking dish, I had to cook it about 45 minutes.  Good stuff!

We really enjoyed this recipe. Used 6 extra large eggs and 1 cup milk.  Subbed ham for the bacon and minced onion for the green onion since it's what I had on hand.  Used extra cheese.  Filled the 11x7 inch dish perfectly.  My only complaint was that I had to cook it for 40 minutes to get it to set.  The 11x7 was a perfect size for 4 hearty eaters to enjoy the dish for dinner along with biscuits and a fresh fruiit salad.  Will definitely be making this again.  UPDATE:  Made this again as above but added sauteed mushrooms and chopped fresh tomato.  The tomato made the bottom watery so DEFINITELY will NOT add those again!

Five stars for the recipe as written.  Also tried a veggie version (with red peppers, tomatoes, onions and scallions) which came out a little watery.  But it's a perfect base recipe to make endless variations.

My subs: ground pork sausage and onion already cooked and mushrooms.
Absolutely delicious, easy, and quick. Just had foot surgery so I can't be standing for too long. This was quick enough to do and not be on my feet for long. Paired it with a cucumber, onion, and tomato salad with a light sour cream & dill dressing. A nice, light but flavorful meal for a summer evening. Best part is you can use most any veggie and/or meat to make this your own. Next time...going to take it Mexican style with green chillies, taco seasoned sausage. corn, cheese, onion and top with salsa and sour cream. Mmmmmm.

I really liked this recipe. I plan on making it again. Next time I will not add the additional salt. Between the salt in the butter, bacon and cheese I think the 1/2 tsp was a little too much for my taste. Other than that I loved it and look forward to making it again with some tomatoes and peppers added in.

All I can say is OMG!!!!!! This was absolutely phenomal!!!!! I cooked exactly as instructed, however I ran out of milk so I used what I had and fat free half and half to make a cup.  Also I used Jones All Natural Fully Cooked Sausage Links -Lite (instead of bacon) cooked them in a pan with olive oil then took out (did not drain) put on plate then sauteed green peppers into same pan. Crumbled sausage and scraped green peppers from pan into a pyrex pie dish then sprinkled with cup of low fat sharp cheddar cheese.
Also while whisking the egg mixture I added the required salt, shook pepper to my taste, sprinkled organic cilantro (dried) and basil (dried) into the mixture. WOW, this was incredible! My husband (who can be a pickey eater) and 2 year old thoroughly enjoyed as well!! You can't go wrong with this.  A definate keeper!!

I made this last night for dinner as something to clean out my fridge.  I did make a couple swaps...cooked, cubed ham for the bacon, no green onions - so I used fresh parsley and some onion and garlic powders.  My husband doesn't like cheese so I only used 1/4 cup of cheddar and about 1/4 cup of shredded hot pepper jack cheese.  The possibilities are endless with this recipe!  Also cooked in an 8 x 8 pan, but had to up the temp to 400 and cook for about 35-45 minutes. Great recipe and I will be making this more often!

Very tasty - my husband ate almost an entire pan by himself.  I thought there was maybe a bit much cheese, but it was otherwise tasty.  I added some sauteed mushrooms too, which were really good.

Pretty good. I have to complain about the recipe though, because it isn't very clear.  You're supposed to add butter-ok, melted butter? room temperature butter? etc?  Recipes should be concise, but not so short that someone has to guess. I threw in some spinach and added paprika to the eggs to give it some flair.  Then I browned it at 450 at the end, to brown the cheese and leave it a bit crusty on top. Magnificenza.

I made this recipe but used pancetta instead of bacon.  I also cooked it stove top in my fritatta pan from Williams Sonoma.  So deliciously wonderful!  It has a nice golden brown crust and was really fluffy inside.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

WOW!  This recipe was amazing!  I couldn't wait to get to a computer to rate it!!  I made this recipe because I wanted to use up my eggs and onions before they went bad and I'm so glad I stumbled across this recipe!  It was moist and flavorful!! I also added green peppers because I wanted to use those up too!  My entire family raved about this and I will quadruple the recipe next time!  it was also phenomenal as a breakfast sandwith and burrito!

I feel guilty even rating this, as I made quite a few changes based on taste preference and mainly, ingredients on hand that needed to be used up. I browned 6-7 sausage links along with a few slices of diced turkey bacon. I used 8 eggs and whisked them with 1/2 c milk and a 1/2 c ricotta cheese. I also added garlic/onion powders, a few shakes of dried parsley, and some black pepper. I then sauteed a small onion, finely diced along with some green pepper (also finely diced) and a roma tomato sans pulp/seeds. I sprinkled a little extra garlic powder to this mixture as it was sauteeing. Used 1/2 c cheddar, and a 1/2 c parmesan cheese. I then mixed everything together and baked in a deep dish pan for 30 minutes at 350. I took it out, let it rest for 10 minutes, sprinkled a little extra parmesan on the top, and voila, a really good brunch today!

Very easy, tasty and a great recipe to think of as a blank canvass.  The egg part seemed perfect to me and I could easily add any topping on hand or anything that sounds good.  Great recipe!

I mixed the bacon, green onions and cheese in with the eggs, but that's just a personal preference. My fiance and I love doing breakfast for dinner and it was the perfect quick recipe  for a busy Sunday evening.

This was a very easy and tasty frittata. Makes for a very inexpensive meal since most of these ingredients are pantry/refrigerator staples, which I liked a lot. I thought the baking time was way off though, ended up having it in the oven for almost 50 minutes before it set up. Liked it with the green onions and bacon. Next time I think I will decrease the salt a little since it was just a bit on the salty side, but no big deal. Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this twice now.  Both times I added sausage and mushrooms.  The first time was for my Sunday School class, I doubled it, and brought it in a 9x13 baking dish- everyone loved it.  This morning, since my wife is a vegetarian and I and the twins love meat, I had to separate it, so I made them in the muffin pans (grease the pans first).  They also turned out stupendous.  Either way, this is a verrrry good recipe.  I really like the green onion flavor, my wife didn't.  Plus, I added a pinch of ground cayenne pepper for just a bit of kick, and never tell anyone about that because they freak out

Very quick and easy.  Made it for dinner tonight and the only change I made was to add extra cheese.  I can see lots of possibilities for additions or substitutions.  I will be making this again.  
Thanks!

Had this for dinner tonight.  I sauteed red and orange peppers and green onions and then added them to the rest of the ingredients.  I also threw in a little pepper jack cheese.  I might decrease the milk next time to 3/4 cup and see how it turns out.  We enjoyed this frittata even though it was really soft.

I usually make this type breakfast "pie" with either southern style hash browns , or potatoes O'Brien from the freezer. I just put potato of choice in the sprayed pan and pour on the rest of it. Yummy stuff! Great for a crowd and much faster to feed all 16 of us when we gather for breakfast.

Excellent, quick, and easy.  Only additions I made were leftover honeybaked ham cubes instead of bacon, and a pinch of garlic powder.  Yummy!

I made this one morning on a whim and didn't have all the exact ingredients, but it was awesome! My husband loved it too! I used 3 eggs, 6 egg whites, added spinach and used red onions. Also, used diced ham rather than bacon and used half cheddar and half asiago cheese. I will keep this recipe and use it often. PS... heats up well and i had breakfast for work for 2 days!

I found it needed almost an hour to bake in the oven. However, I did add other cut vegetables that could have affected the outcome. Will attempt again.

Wonderful and super easy! I doctored it a little,I placed a pie crust on the bottom of the pie plate, then added the egg mixture, followed by some spinach and thin slices of tomato, then I put the green onions, bacon and cheese. This is a great recipe, so simple and delicious. Thank you for posting it :-)

Loved this breakfast dish. Next time I make this I will place squares on lightly toasted bagels to make bagel sandwiches. I doubled the recipe, added LOTS of cheese to both pans and green pepper to one of the pans. Delicious!

I had never made a frittata before - we all really enjoyed this.  I had a lot of eggs on hand so I used 8 and I had pancetta instead of bacon.  Great Sunday night dinner with some homemade scones or biscuits.  Will definitely make again.

OMG! My hubby and I loved this! I did a couple things different.. I added a lot more bacon and cheese. I mixed everything in the bowl. Sprinkling the bacon on top was useless it sinks anyway. I added cheese to the mixture and I did it in a 10' oven safe frying pan. I cooked it for 12 minutes on the stove at medium heat and then broiled it in the oven for about 6. Before I put it in the oven I added a heck of a lot of cheese to the top and watched for it to not over brown while in the oven. It turned out perfect! It had a scrambled egg texture and was fabulous the next morning as well. My hubby LOVED it!

I give it 5 stars because it tastes great, is easy to make and re-heats very well.  A wonderful meal any time of day, especially with a fruit plate on the side.  Don't skip the green onions - they make this dish.   I've also made this wilh italian sweet sausauge (casings removed, chopped up and fried), chopped tomatoes and italian mix shredded cheese.  Recipe is very versatile.

Very good!  Its a very versatile recipe in that I used onions, mushrooms and only 2 strips of bacon in the recipe.  You could almost use any veggies that you have left over.  Really tasty!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I have made it as written and also exchanged the meats, veggies and cheeses with whatever I had on hand and it comes out beautifully.  I have tried other oils, like e.v.o.o., canola, and the only 1, besides butter/margarine that worked well for me was Nutiva organic coconut oil.  Somehow the olive and the canola didn't taste "right"...it was just ok but not spectacularly scrumptious and irresistible.

Fantastic! Not only was this tasty, it's also versatile and super easy!! I did add mushrooms, chives, bell pepper, and potatoes, so I also added 3 extra eggs and cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan. Highly recommended! Yum! Oh btw, out of many picky eaters in our family of 5, ALL 5 raved over this even the child who will not ever eat anything with eggs in it!!

This is great.......... I was making omlets in the morning for my son before school, now all he has to do is heat them up and he's good to go!! I baked them in a cup cake pan which makes it really easy to just grab n go.........
I added some spinach and mushrooms just to get more veggies in him and he really enjoyed them. 
Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

This recipe was very good. The only reason I give it 4 starts is because I found that the bacon made it too salty for my family's taste. Next time I'll add half the amount of bacon and add some more fresh ingredients (spinach, tomatoes, or mushrooms).

I made this for breakfast today.  I didn't have green onions, so I used a 4 oz can of mushroom (well drained), and I increased the pepper to 1/2 tsp.  It was delicious!!!  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good!  Our entire family loved it.  I added 1/4 tsp. each garlic, basil, and marjoram, as another custom version had listed.  I used the 1 C. mozzarella, as that recipe also suggested, and 1/4 C. jack cheese.  Excellent!

This Recipe was easy and quick. Although you can add many different ingredients to make this more exciting, this was the very best combo for picky kids and guests.  I will definately make it again.  I also used a larger pan which means I needed to add 3 more eggs, 1/2 c milk, and 3 more slices of bacon.  I also sprinkled parsley for color. Very nice!

I made this and really liked it.  Made some additions, added 1 tsp. oregano, 1/2 cup feta cheese and 1/4 cup chopped Kalamat olives, now you can call it a Mediterran Frittata.

This is excellent and so quick to prepare!!!  I substituted Butter Buds Sprinkles for the margarine and used Skim Milk to cut down on the fat/calories.  I always keep ready-to-cook or pre-cooked bacon on hand so this was super quick and easy.  My 7 yr old loved it!  This is most definitely a "keeper."

Only made the one change suggested by a reviewer.  Added 2 eggs and 1/3 c. milk to make it in a 9 x 13" pan, and it disappeared quickly.  May put in a little sauteed spinach and garlic next time as that too was mentioned by someone.  Thank you for our new breakfast for dinner favorite.

i used yellow onion instead of green as thats what i had on hand, cooked them with the bacon & added about 3tbsp of chopped jalepenos for a little spice as well as some frozen peas (i love the combo of peas + bacon in anything). i also left out the salt, bacon is usually salty enough in a dish that you wont need any added salt. i thought adding potatos/hashbrowns to this would defeat the purpose of making this recipe as opposed to a recipe that actually calls for potatos/hashbrowns so i served breakfast potatos on the side to make a filling dinner for my husband. all in all, we both enjoyed this and i'll make it again in the future!

EXCELLENT ! Next time I will omit the 2 T. butter, since I greased my baking dish with butter and it was a tad too rich.  The last helping in the dish I put
between 2 slices of toast on the third
day and what do you know ?  It was the
tastiest this way !!!!  It will be one of
my favorite recipes to make from now on.

I gave this a three stars because it was really thin with just 6 eggs and my husband was pretty disappointed in it.  The only change I made was I sauteed some white onion to use instead of the green onions.

This makes a great weeknight supper.  It is quick and easy.  I serve it with biscuits and OJ.  I do not use green onions since my husband does not like them.

This is a wonderful dish!! I've made this several times, exactly as written, and also with a few minor changes. I always use lots of cheese and haven't had a bad outcome yet!

Awesome! I was looking for something to make ahead for weekday breakfast.  I divided mixture in mini loaf pans and have one for each am.  Add a bagel and perfection!
I used the bacon crumbles to make it even easier on myself.  Whole family was impressed :)
Thanks bunches!

I made it for my daughter who is a vegetarian. I used veggie bacon( Morning Star) instead of bacon. I tried some I couldn't tell it was veggie bacon. The veggie bacon does work very well. To much green onions for my taste and my daughter's.

I added two extra eggs for this and also threw in some peppers.  Instead of the suggested layers, I just mixed everything together with the beaten eggs.

It's a good basic Frittata recipe.  It doesn't hurt to throw in a few more of your favorite fillings such as green pepper and tomato!

used ham instead of bacon, and threw it in while cooking, along with the cheese - would cut back a little on the salt (pork products have quite a bit in them to begin with). saved a little cheese to throw on top, and the kids really liked it otherwise, maybe throw in some chopped tomato. good recipe, nonetheless!

Great recipe if you are feeding a gang ain the morning and want to do prep ahead of time.  A little salty, I would cut the salt out and let the salt from the bacon and cheese flavor it.  At least cut it way down!

This frittata is delicious and so easy to make.  I divide this recipe into four souffle dishes.  I have made it with canadian bacon, spinach, peppers, you can add or substitute many different things in this recipe.  It never fails to impress guests!

I made this for a nice pre-theater brunch with my "in-laws". Everyone loved it, it was downright delicious! The only problem I had was the bacon made it too salty...which I know can vary depending on the bacon. I also added Green onion. I think this is an excellent recipe with endless options for variation and will absolutely make it again!

I wish i could give this more stars. It went together so easy and it was amazing the first and second morning. I would suggest a bit longer cook time. I think mine went closer to 40 minutes. Just start with the 25 and check often after that.

This recipe is a combination of all the things I love: a base of items that I almost always have on hand, incredible versatility, easy preparation and a satisfying final product.  I made no changes to the base ingredients, but used items I had on hand instead of the bacon and a blend of cheeses rather than just cheddar.  I do believe I'll make many many versions in the future.

Made this tonight and loved it! I didn't have fresh onions, so I used minced; also, cut the milk back to 3/4 cup because I had only medium eggs. I baked this in an 8 x 8 glass dish for 30 minutes and it was perfectly done. Next time, I'll cut back on the salt.

We had this for breakfast this morning. I used 5 cooked sausage patties (4 would have been fine) that I cut up, white onion (didn't have green), and cut up some fresh mushrooms. I also used a white/cheddar shredded combo. Really tasty. I was surprised at how much it makes. We had two large helpings and were filled, and still had enough left over for lunch.

Very good. I halfed the recipe for just my husband and I. Doubled up on the bacon. make sure you cook the fat out of bacon. Added more cheese, I added about 1/4 cup pickled japs. My husband loved it. Will make again.

Very quick and simple to make and delicious. I used 8 eggs instead of 6, 10 pieces of thick sliced bacon and substituted bacon fat for butter. This is a very versatile recipe where you can add just about anything you like such as spinach, mushrooms, etc. It's great with chopped green chilies, fresh chopped serranos, chopped cilantro and sliced black olives.

This was amazing!! Quick, easy and delicious.  I always have bacon pieces on hand and used 3/4 cup cheese crumbles versus shredded cheese.

Great recipe, I doubled the recipe since I have 2 teenage sons and a hungry husband and added green peppers and mushrooms as well and used half and half instead of milk to make it a big richer.  I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Great recipe and very easy to make!

There was a bit too much milk so I had to cook it longer.  However, it tasted great.  I used cut up chicken apple sausages instead of bacon.

I'm always looking for a way to get a quick, high protein breakfast in my kids before school.  I doubled the recipe and had leftovers for several days.  Very easy and yummy, and it tastes great reheated in the microwave.

This was a big hit at our brunch. We doubled the amount of bacon, but we'll use a smaller baking dish next time. It was spread REALLY thinly in a 9 X 13 pan (I know the recipe calls for 11 x 7 but we didn't have that)

We loved this- I made it for a week night dinner and served it with hasbrowns. I took the submitter's advice and cooked the bacon ahead. This made for really quick and easy prep. This will also work well for when the in-laws visit since it is gluten free. 1/1/10 new note: Have made this several times- to make even faster, I just chop 'ready bacon' and throw it in. I don't usually have green onion on hand, but a tablespoon of minced dried onion made a fine substitution.

I was really surprised at how flavorful this came out! I wasn't expecting much despite the reviews, just because the ingredients seemed simple... nothing extraordinary. I was so wrong.  My husband loved it, topped it with some hot sauce. Great!  Next time, for a tex-mex kick I might add some chopped jalapenos rather than the green onions!  It's a keeper!

This recipe is very easy and even the kids liked it. I had to make some substitutions because I didn't have things all the ingredients in the house though. I followed the recipe but I used ham, swiss cheese and white onion finely chopped. A great base recipe. Thanks!

Very easy and very good.  I just wanted to add the definition of a frittata as I think people might be confused.  A frittata is an open-faced omelet which means that it's going to be thin and not thick like a quiche.

This was very easy to make and very good. I made it and the put it in the over when my company came as to not over cook it - however all the cheese fell to the bottom. I am going to make it again this weekend, but will put the ingredients in the egg right before I pop it in the oven!

I made this recipe for a brunch for Mother's Day.  It turned out perfectly!  I used regular onions instead of green onions.  Other than that, I followed the recipe & it turned out great! Would not change a thing.

OK, this was really yum.  God bless the ingredient search feature, or else I would never have made it.  My mods were as such:  turkey bacon, a few dashes of hot sauce and about 2TB of grated parm, mostly because I needed to get rid of it.  2 adults and a preschooler made fast work of the entire dish.  Husband is already asking when I'm going to make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  Made exactly as it called for, but i oiled the 9x13 instead of butter. Will do a little butter next time. The green onion (tips) are a must! Made a great breakfast sandwich, too.

this was pretty good. I doubled the recipe, since I have a family of five and there wasn't any leftovers. I also added red peppers and feta cheese. Definitely decrease the butter, cut it in half, it was really oily. And mine took about 55 minutes to bake.

The great thing about a recipe like this is that you can add whatever you like best.  I made this for dinner the other night and added some chopped potatoes I had boiled earlier.  My husband and I really enjoyed this, and the leftovers were even tastier.

I've made this twice for dinner, and each time the kids can't wait for me to make it again.  The only additions I make are 1 teaspoon of dried minced onion, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 cup of baby spinach and I double the bacon.  A delicious and flavorful alternative to the same old dinners.

Replaced milk with cream because I had an expiring tub, added some leftover bell peppers and used a mix of chedder and mozzarella. Result = yummy! Leftovers made an excellent sandwich filling. Proportions were totally spot-on, giving a moist frittata instead of a fried omelette.

This was good enough that I might make it again.  The cheese flavor was a little strong and I felt like it needed more vegetables.  I added diced red pepper to it, but next time I might put even more pepper or broccoli in it.

This was delicious.  It was light and fluffy.  My girl scout troop made this to earn their cooking badge and loved it.  We put in ham instead of bacon. Everyone is requesting this recipe.

This was delicious and easy.  I substituted red bell pepper for the green onions.  My husband and I thought it was good, but my brother thought it could use more cheese and bacon, less egg.

Wow, this was great. I made the 6 servings for just my fiance and I, thinking there'd be left overs and there wasn't! I susbstituted regular onions chopped very small since I didn't have green onion and added sauteed mushrooms. DELICIOUS and fluffy!

I scoured long and hard to find this recipe which is one of the easiest and most versatile frittata's. I have substituted onions for green chiles and I have also served it with the onions sautéed. Family favorite!

I made this fritata for dinner.  Instead of milk I used heavy whipping cream.  I baked at 350 for 35 minutes using a 9" pie pan (glass) and topped the mixture with home grown tomato slices.  Light, fluffy and the tomatoes gave it a wonderful burst of flavor.

This is a nice recipe if you do not want anymore carbs like bread or potatoes in it. I used 9 eggs in this and put it in a 9x9 glass pan. I couldn't imagine it in a larger pan. I got 4 serving from this.

This is a great recipe - I did add extra bacon, cheese and green onions (just personal preference) and it was delicious.  Very easy to put together, I used a 9 inch pie plate.  Mine took closer to 40 minutes to bake.  Will make again!

Overall, this wasn't bad. It was something different to try, which is what I was going for. I made it a little more "figure friendly." I substituted turkey bacon for the real stuff and I cut down on the butter and cheese. Like a lot of the other recipes I've tried recently, it gives me a base to work off of and play around with it.

Delicious!  If you had a few croutons to the top with the cheese and bacon, it will help to get rid of the runny eggs, i also added crumbled sausage and added more eggs.  Wonderful!

I loved this recipe.  It was simple and delicious.  I'm thinking about trying it with sausage next time.  The bacon didn't add enough flavor for me.  I didn't season it enough either so it was a little plain.  Overall this was a great dish

There is nothing to change in this recipe.  It was really easy to make and well worth the wait till it finished baking.  My husband loved it, plus I made one to take to a quilting get-together and it was a huge hit!  My husband told me that real men dont eat quiche.  I guess not, but they sure love the bacon cheese fritatta!!

Made it.. it's very easy, but I'd cut back on salt amounts esp b/c bacon is already salty.. in fact I'd put NO salt if using bacon.  I've made it with brown ground sausage too.

This was ok. The texture was weird, but I've never had a frittata before so maybe it was just me. The flavor was good, but I only made it through half a slice before I was done with it. I guess I'm not much of a savory breakfast eater.

this is an excellent skeleton recipe!; with that I do add my own ways.  1.)- I use ten eggs instead of 6- making the dish more larger and denser.  2.) I use about 3/4 cup Jenni O turkey ham, cubed vs. bacon strips.  3.) I spruce it up with my own veggies- including diced green bell peppers and red pepper flakes. FINALLY, (here's the kicker), I add pillsbury crescent rolls as a topper.  In the last 15 minutes of baking, save 1/2 cup of cheese from the recipe and top the casserole with the remaining cheese, then lay 1/2 the can of unrolled crescent dough to the top of the dish- leaving air pockets for breathe. This may seem like a lot of work, but it serves for a delicious dish- I've made it several times and it's a favorite in our house! Little note, the cooking time bumps up to 45-60 minutes- the extra eggs really add for extra time. The casserole center needs to be solid before the crescent topper is added. No one wants a runny center!

This made for a very tasty and easy to make breakfast.  I took other folk's advice and added 2 extra eggs, and doubled the bacon (as I am a huge bacon lover).  It took about twice as long to cook as what the recipe suggests, but was well worth the wait.  I will definitely be making this again.

I baked it in a pie plate and it took a lot longer (at least 15 minutes) to be done in the middle. Might just be our altitude here in Colorado! Loved it, though - easy & delicious!

Used sausage instead of Bacon, took it to a party it was a GREAT HIT. Cooked it a bit longer the recipe calls for great meal for any time of the day. Especially if company is in the house not having to cook eggs for breakfast.

I was looking forward to this dish but it came out quite wet.  I left it in 10 mins longer than required yet there was liquid in the bottom when I cut it.  I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting some red pepper for the bacon -could that have made the difference?  It was very tasty so I want to make it work.

Wow! What a great and simple result. I tried this after lunch today and it turned out fabulous. Will be a great breakfast meal tomorrow (if it lasts thru the evening!)  I like this one a lot. Taste is terrific, texture, color. All as advertised. I highly recommend this one for a fast and easy big time meal. Thanx.

good overall recipe. use the size dish 7 x 11 "greased" that they tell you to. Thus you will not have cooking time issues. i agree with other you can put literally anything in this dish to suit your pallet. easy & good!

Used Sautéed  mushrooms and prosciutto and swiss cheese, and served it for dinner! Wonderful-a great way to clean out the fresh ingredients from your fridge before you go on vacation. (which is what I did!)

Awesome. Will definitely make again and again. Can't believe I never tried this before. I didn't have bacon so I used sauteed breakfast sausages. And I added some garlic pepper to the eggs. Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent! I added two more eggs and a touch more milk, because I had a bigger dish. First time ever making a frittata. I have mede quiches and this is just so yum. I have it for dinner and breakfast. It is a must have, so quick and easy. I added some sliced tomatoes to the top and sprinkle a lil more cheese on top and broil until browned.

made this today with my neice for brunch, wow we really enjoyed it.  I did add more cheese to it as well as i used dried minced onions as I didn't have any green onions,  did it ever give it a nice flavor.  Think next time I will only add the amount of cheese that the recipe calls for as i found it a bit greasy, it did bake longer as well but that could be because i did use a 8x8 pan instead of a 11x7 one but will make this again.  works really well using ham instead of bacon mine was still frozen thanks

Really good and easy to make - I didn't have onions which would have made it even better. I think next time I will use a little less butter though.

This was very good... my husband said it was even better the next day.  I left out the green onions because I didn't have any on hand and added cooked sausage links (chopped).  Served w/ biscuits and honey.

I loved it!  Even my teenage daughter liked this one.  I used diced ham instead of bacon, added some chopped green peppers and topped with a dallop of sour cream and a little hot sauce.  I also used a cast iron skillet.  Everyone was asking for more.

Very easy and good.  I made this with turkey bacon and 2% cheddar cheese (to cut down on the fat due to DH cholesterol).  It was delicious but a little on the salty side.  I think next time I will use only half the salt suggested. Otherwise this is perfect.

Excellent. I put this together the night before for a crowd of out of town guests. Then in the morning I put it in the oven. No fuss and it was delicious. It was gone in 20 minutes. I should have made two.

Yummy frittata! I substituted ham for the bacon and used a mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheese because that's what was in my kitchen. Great idea for an easy breakfast for overnight guests. Will make again.

Tasty recipe. My fussy eaters ate it all! I'm not a big meat eater, so would put less bacon in it next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving breakfast, and was delighted with how easy and quick it was.  My family loved it!
