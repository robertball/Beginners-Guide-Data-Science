I gave this recipe a try despite my reservations about using mayo for the sauce.  The pizza was good - nothing that tantalized my taste buds though.  I made homemade pizza dough and topped the unbaked crust with the sauce, toppings (I added artichoke hearts - this was a welcome addition) and baked for 10 minutes... added the spinach and feta and baked another 10 minutes until cheese was beginning to brown/bubble.  Although the mayo sauce wasn't bad - I feel that a garlic/olive oil sauce may have really given the pizza the flavor it needed to stand out.  Also - a little mozzarella would have been nice too - it was a bit too much feta in my opinion.  This is a good recipe for someone looking for something new.

what a delicious surprise this pizza was. The mayo mix made the pizza extra special. I added 1 fresh tomato in addition to sun dried. And I also precooked the onion before applying to pizza.

4.5 stars; great flavor, great taste.  Firstly, I used raw dough, which presents a different set of problems than a pre-baked crust.  Since the mayo/feta mixture is heavy and moist, it will saturate your dough and the heavy pizza will stick to your peel even with copious flour.  So it's best to pre-bake raw dough for 10 minutes on this pizza.  I used only 1/2 cup of feta and used 1.5 cups mozzaella cheese on the very top.  It's best to cover the spinch with the cheese so the spinch won't shrink up too much or burn.  I increased the garlic amount too.  The onion didn't cook too well on this pizza; next time I may put then on the very top over the mozz. cheese, or omit them entirely. Good white pizza.

This is excellent!  The combo of olives, feta, and sun dried tomatoes is jazzy, and it's an easy dish to prepare... and to eat!  I'm on a diet these days, so I'll be making this on pitas instead of on a traditional crust...and it'll be just as good!  Thanks so much for the recipe...

I didn't have all the ingredients so I improvised:  sprinkled olive oil on a mini-pita, topped with the mayo mix, then a fresh tomato slice, sprinkled with dried basil and feta.  The mayo mix is a great base for a greek pizza.

Great recipe! A regular go-to in our house. The only time we tweak it is to replace the sun-dried tomatoes with a few capers.

So good!  Everyone went for this yummy pizza.  I premade some whole wheat pizza crusts which complemented the dish nicely.  DH isn't into onions, so I did w/o them and found it was still great!  FYI-Costco sells large containers of Kalamata olives at a great price!

First let me say the flavor combination is excellent.  Having said that, I think the amounts are a bit off.  I only had 3/4 cup of feta and even that was too much - the feta tended to overpower the other flavors.  For next time, I will reduce the feta to 1/2 cup total and may also try one that is tomato-basil flavored.  I added chopped artichoke hearts and put some of the onion on the pizza with the other ingredients for a longer bake time.  I also used less spinach than called for and chopped the leaves before tossing them with the remaining onion and feta.  The other thing I will do is eliminate that Tablespoon of oil - it doesn't add flavor but it does add an oily feeling that isn't appealing.  This really is a fine recipe idea!

This is great! Quite "rich" with the mayo/feta cheese base.  I used olive mayonaise (healthier). Next time I may reduce the mayo to make it healthier.

Oh my goodness, this pizza is to die for! We had it on Friday sans the chicken as a part of lent and it was magnificent. My friend actually made it and I took the liberty to find it on allrecipes. She bought everything from Kroger, I don't know if that had an effect, but this recipe is a keeper!!!!

This pizza is FANTASTIC!!! I used a large sweet onion that was browned till just tender-used Roma tomato thinly sliced and blotted of excess moisture- used olive oil to toss the mixture that goes on second! Sprinkled with mozzarella over second layer!! Also, I used Pillsbury thin crust pizza (found in the refrigerated roll section) dough- I prebaked it at 400 for 7 mins-it was nice and crispy!!

Surprisingly good!  Was apprehensive about Mayo yet it added a nice tangy quality and balance to the garlic. I used Trader Joe's whole wheat pizza dough, baked it for 10 mins. first.  Saut√©ed the onions in Olive oil with kosher salt for 10 mins, added the spinach and cooked until wilted.

I made this pizza for company and everyone raved about it.  The only additions that I made were I added chicken and red pepper flakes.  I will make this again.

I was trying to find a recipe to make with the little we were working with in our fridge, and this seemed a perfect fit especially since it was quick and easy. My husband loved it and said that he wants to add this into our meal rotation.  I made my own dough from the pizza dough I recipe on this site. We unfortunately didn't have olives, so I only topped it with spinach. My husband wants artichokes and olives next time.   Will definitely be making many more times! Thank you for sharing

ok, I'm the first to admit I changed this and maybe I should not rate this, but the recipe was followed as per grocery store finds and what was on hand. I used flat-bread, sub. the mayo for butter then proceeded with the rest of prep. I added diced portabella mushrooms and red bell peppers. these freeze great and make a great snack for meatless Fridays. great recipe!

Will make again!  Used the Trader Joe's Garlic and Herb pizza crust and baked it first.  Also used the suggestion of putting the onions on with the tomatoes and olives layer and I added artichokes.  Super yummy and husband was impressed!

The pizza was amazing! I made homemade dough and created a stuffed crust pizza using mozzarella cheese sticks. I baked the crust for 10 minutes at 450. Then I topped it with the mayo, garlic, and feta mixture. The mayo sounds odd and I almost changed the sauce. I am glad that I didn't because it was amazing! I couldn't imagine the pizza without it. After baking the crust with the sauce and the first layer of toppings for 10 minutes at 375, I then topped it off with sauted red onions, spinach, and feta cheese. I baked it for 4 more minutes. It was perfect! We'll never need to order a gourmet pizza again!

Only one thing I would change is Yogurt cheese instead of mayo, not so sweet and healthier.

Artichoke hearts were very good on this pizza, other than that it tasted like cheesy, olive loaf..or something. I'll stick to takeout.

this was a gourmet pizza- very good- I am thinking of having a gourmet pizza night for our friends and will add this one as the veggie one for those who do not eat meat. Both my 5 and 7 year old loved it.

I LOVE this pizza! I added some oregano to the feta/mayo mixture as well. I had green onions so I used them instead of white and added a little mozza to the topl. I make this every time I crave pizza now. (If you make your own crust, its nice to put some basil, rosemary and oregano in the dough as well. Amazing aroma while its baking!)

READ THIS!! Pizza recipes are very forgiving and if you have spinach in the garden that needs to be used, this is a perfect recipe.  I live in a town of 500 so the sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, and feta cheese mean a 50 mile round trip to the store. That wasn't going to happen . S0 ... I made my own crust using the previously mentioned Jay's Signature Pizza Crust Recipe, used the tomato-basil feta I had on hand and enhanced it with shredded mozarella, substituted bruschetta for the tomatoes and garlic, cut back on the oregano, and used the spinach from my garden.  The only real recipe ingredients I had was the olives, onions, and oregano. I have now made it two times, both times using my pizza stone and it has turned out terrifically.

Like most people, I questioned the mayo ingredient. I'm glad I didn't skip it! It made a FANTASTIC feta/garlic sauce for the pizza. This is easily the best spinach and feta pizza I've ever had. My 10 year old sister hates eating spinach, even she couldn't resist this dish.  Having limited ingredients, I gave up both the onion and the tomato. The dish didn't suffer. It was still fantastic!  It was easy to make and didn't have a long wait time. My younger siblings even helped me make it. This is a great dish for kids to help out with. They'll enjoy making it as much as they'll love eating it. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

mmm good! Never had Greek pizza before (although some family have, they enjoyed it too) but this was delicious! I didn't even think I liked any olives (other than black). Figured in too little time (having never done it before, took me almost 1 1/2 hrs, would have been less if I had had the right tomatoes, threw some fresh to 'dry' in the oven while I prepped everything else.) Took mine on a plate to work and everybody stopped to ask what that wonderful smell was. ;)

The mayo was a surprise success! Very rich. Delicious. Easy. I used roasted cherry tomatoes from my garden. Definately a repeat.

The first time I tried this recipe, I thought it needed a little more of a punch of flavor. So this time, instead of the mayo, I used Philladelphia garlic cooking cream and cut back a bit on the minced garlic called for in the recipe. It definitely brought it to another level of flavor.

Delicious !! Just a couple of changes..I used a prepared whole wheat pizza crust.  I added a little less mayo and added a small amount of olive oil to the mayo mixture.  I added the red onion before baking the first time.  I also added sliced up artichokes hearts.  Instead of the dried tomatoes, I sliced up a Roma tomato into thin slices and layered them on top of the mayo mixture.  I did not add the oregano.  This is a keeper !!

Great pizza!  Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.  I loved the mayo sauce.  Made a slightly tangy, sweet sauce.  I used the Whole Wheat pizza dough recipe from this site.  I carmelized a sweet onion in a frying pan to use instead of raw onion.  Used fresh oregano (which I love), but in this case I feel oregano just doesn't belong (on pizza?  Go figure!).  I'll definitely leave it out next time.  Added shredded mozzarella and a bit of parmesan.  Might add toasted pine nuts next time, or a sprinkling of a smoked gruyere cheese.  YUM!

This is an excellent greek pizza. I served it with a tzatziki dipping sauce. The only thing I will change next time I make it is the sun dried tomatoes to roma tomatoes.

I needed lots of appetizers for a party and this fit the bill as I could make several large pizza's and cut them into smaller pieces to feed a large group. I used my own homemade dough and store bought alfredo sauce instead of the mayo. I really think the alredo sauce made a big difference. I will definitely be making this again.

Really good base for building your pizza. I made my own dough and precooked for 15 mins. Then I spread the garlic mayo sauce over it. Topped with carmelized red onions, feta cheese, Greek olives, sundried tomatoes and chicken. WOW, it was tasty!

Easy, delicious, and quick pizza recipe.  I made some modifications to the recipe to better accommodate both my appetite and wallet.  I substituted whole, pitted black olives for the kalamata olives.  I also substituted frozen, chopped spinach for the fresh baby spinach (rinsed the frozen spinach in warm water to soften it).  Finally, I added some chicken that I prepared ahead of time by searing, baking, resting, and chopping.  The listed crust worked just fine, but I'm going to try and substitute it with a whole wheat crust next time.

Great easy "garlic sauce" for a base. You can adjust this recipe to what you have on hand. I used Martha White's crispy pizza crust mix to make the crust. (My kids love this crust.) I also used fresh tomatoes, red onion, green olives, some capers, and frozen spinach that I cooked in the microwave first then drained well. I also added mozzarella cheese with the feta cheese. I added salt and pepper but it was a bit too salty so next time I won't add salt. Enjoy.

This recipe is so easy and delicious!!  I made this last night and was amazed at how fast it all came together!  I added some more Oregano and then some Rosemary and Thyme leaves.  It was great!  I will definitely make this again...soon!

I love the flavors of this pizza.  The fact that it is so fast and easy too gives this recipe 5 stars!  I was wary of using the mayo, but found that once the pizza came together, there was no mayo taste at all, it just tasted like a white sauce.  I added a can of quartered artichoke hearts, as another reviewer suggested.  And I used regular sliced black olives to cut costs (the ingredients of this pizza are already spendy enough, I've found).

5 Star Pizza. I rolled out a refrigerated pizza crust, baked to crisp it (don't forget to poke holes in it), then added the toppings. The mayo mixture is a must for the pizza, even though it may sound odd. My last change was to the spinach... I tossed it with a red wine vinaigrette  (since I didn't have the sun-dried tomatoes) and then topped the pizza.

This is good, and pretty close to my recipe. My family has an obsession with anchovies so...We buy a crust and use Emrils "Putanesca Sauce" Wich is amazing. Then add cheese and the kalamata olives wich we also get at Costco:) and anchovies, and feta of course. Pretty much the best pizza ever. Seriously just try the putanesca it is sooo good.

In this case, I give the pizza four stars plus one for introducing me to a completely new pizza combo!  I definitely wouldn't have thought to put these ingredients together, but they taste quite good.  I had some leftover sun-dried tomatoes, olives and feta, so when I found this recipe, I decided to give it a try.  Definitely a good accidental find!

These toppings were great, I made a few tweaks though - for what I thought was a  wonderful pizza. I added hot bannana peppers, real tomatoes instead of sundried, and I used  "Jay's Pizza Crust" from this site with a half and half mix of whole wheat to white flour.

This is indescribably good. I just eat this, my wife makes it. Alive with flavor and a great change from red sauce pizza. She adds a sprinkle of crumbled bacon or some mushrooms. Not too many extras though. The feta, olives and tomatoes really do the talking with this one.

My family loves this, and they're usually hard to please. I used Mission wraps as my "pizza crusts", and they made for the perfect thin crust pizza. I also pounded fried ikan bilis (anchovies!) and added them to the pizza sauce. I also cooked the onions over the stove separately with sugar and a pinch of balsamic vinegar, prior to adding it to the pizza.

This recipe was wonderful!  My family loved it!  I didn't have any spinach so used artichoke hearts and also added fresh tomatoes.  I cut the feta cheese in half and used Mozzarella for the rest.

We really liked it, but I wouldn't call it fabulous.  I think it might have been the sun-dried tomatoes that threw it off for me.  Not sure.  After reading the reviews, I added a little chicken, some marinated artichoke hearts, and I sprinkled some mozzarella on top along with the feta.  Not sure I'll make it again.

Love it. It's my new favorite pizza. I pretty much followed the recipe although I didn't measure anything. Just added straight from the garden halved cherry tomatoes and a handful of vidalia onions. I'm still trying to perfect a crust but I'd eat this thing without a perfect crust. Thanks for posting.

I love the pizza.  My DH is on a low fat diet so instead of using regular Mayo I used the reduced or olive oil kind.  I also used Reduced fat feta. I forgot the onions last time and it was still great.  We loved it.  This week I'm making 2 pizza's so that we have left overs for tomorrow.

I followed the recipe exactly but I found the recipe way too rich.  I think the mayonnaise was too much.  The taste was pretty good, though.

Made this recipe as directed, except I added a bit of mozarella. I didn't like the mayo sauce. It just had a weird taste, but that's just my opinion. I wish I would've gone with a red or garlic sauce. I think it has the potential to be a really great recipe, but not with the mayo. I will def. try it again minus the mayo.

Over all pretty good. I think when I make this again I will cut the amount of feta down though, probably by half.  I like feta as much as the next girl, but I think this was just too much.  Also maybe I'll make the mayo/garlic/feta sauce ahead of time and let the flavors meld some.  Maybe with these minor tweeks it'll gain 5 stars :)  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great.  I used pizza dough from my favorite pizza place instead and just baked it a bit before putting the mayo mixture on.  Next time I might use a little less oil.  Otherwise it was perfect!

My boyfriend and I LOVE greek pizza, we tried this last Friday-this was excellent. The sun dried tomatoes are great, was also a little skeptical of the mayo, but found it gave good flavor. We used Boboli for the crust.-Don't think we'll be ordering pizza out anymore!
