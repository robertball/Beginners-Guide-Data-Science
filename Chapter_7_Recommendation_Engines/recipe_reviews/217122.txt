Tasted great! This is the first home made cheese cake I made. Topped it with caramel sauce and everyone loved it. I added tbs more vanilla to the sour cream. I won't add as much our cream next time it over powers the cheese cake.

Wowee! We made this for a party today and everyone loved it. Being a cheesecake fan, I have tried many, but this one was absolutely fabulous! We had blueberry topping, but I ate mine without and it was so creamy and silky. The crust is amazing with the pecans. A new favorite for our family. Thanks for sharing!!

I made this cheesecake exactly as written and took it to work. I had a sliver in the morning just to taste it. By the time I got back for a proper piece with my lunch, it was gone. I'll have to make another to keep home.  Delicious!

I would have given this 5 stars but I'm not a fan of the crust. I'm not sure why, but it didn't seem right. the cheesecake itself turned out so yummy! I will be making it again!

I used digestive biscuits(a plain cookie) since graham crackers are not easily available. I also added some Greek yogurt with the sour cream. Several people commented it was the best cheesecake they had.

This is the best cheesecake.  Growing up we had a recipe with the sour cream top, so I was looking for one like that.  I did add cinnamon to the crust.

Very tasty recipe and have made several times. Love the pecan in crust mix. 

Decided to make minor additions & everyone has loved it.  I put 2 tsp of vanilla into filling and use 1/2 cup of coconut oil in crust.  

Really love the "no water bath" -- just bake, freeze, and serve :)
