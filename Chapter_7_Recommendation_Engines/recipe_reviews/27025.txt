I quite enjoyed this "Cranberry Eggnog," which reminded me of a treat from a gourmet coffee shop. I made my own eggnog (Allrecipes, sal, Easiest Egg Nog). I also used frozen cranberries, which are much less tart than fresh cranberries according to my own experimentation. I also left out the sugar, since my fresh homemade eggnog alone was sweet enough for me without adding additional sweetener. I will definitely make this again. IMPORTANT NOTE: I just realized that I failed to follow the recipe instructions. I just put everything together in the blender (no pre-cooking the cranberries), and I really enjoyed it like that. Oooops! I am thinking I might try another variation on this recipe: blending homemade cranberry sauce with egg nog. Thank you Pamela Logsdon for sharing your recipe.
