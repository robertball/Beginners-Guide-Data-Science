The best rice I've ever made! Even though this is a very basic recipe, it is fantastic. I saled the recipe for 4. I used a very heavy, teflon coated saucepan and did not have any sticking.  I did substitute a 14 oz can chicken broth and omitted the salt. If the lid of your pan doesn't seal tightly, wrap it in foil.. you have to keep the steam in as much as possible to get a nice fluffy rice. I also removed it from the heat for the last 5 minutes and let it sit. Do NOT peek! Remove the lid after 5 minutes off the heat and you'll have perfect rice with little to no scorched grains. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this quite a few times now with favorable reviews.  I do the following changes.  I use chicken broth or boullion cubes instead of regular water and after simmering for 25 minutes, stir from the bottom to "fluff", cover, and let steam an additional 10 to 15 minutes.  The rice will separate better and it won't be as sticky and moist.

This rice had a really nice texture to it.  I did add a couple of cloves of garlic (minced) to the hot oil and cooked until brown prior to adding the water and salt.  Gave it a nice, yet mild garlicky flavor.  I used Jasmine rice because it's what I had in my pantry and it turned out fine.

Hey great recipe because i was looking for a great puffy rice recipe.  I cooked some onion in the oil, i used olie oil and brown rice (to be more healthy).  I was worried it would not come out well but it did.  Next time i will add some chicken bouillon cubes to the water for more flavor.

This was was great, I wouldn't change a thing. I paired my rice with with fivebrigs' habichuelas (puerto rican style beans). Together, the rice and the beans reminded me of the meals we ate while on our trip in PR many years ago.

Very, very good.  I was a little worried about the amount of salt required but it was perfect!  *Just a word of caution... When stirring/mixing during steaming or when ready to serve, don't scrape from the bottom layer of the pot or you'll mix and serve yourself hard, crispy rice. I happen to like the "crusted" bottom layer but not everyone does.*

Added fresh cracked sea salt, oil, fresh cracked pepper, cumin, and chili powder to water before boiling.  Let boil then added 2 cups of rice.  Turned out great when combined with Carne Guisada and Habichuelas Guisadas

This tasted just like plain rice.  I couldn't tell the difference from making it any other way.  That being said, it was good but once again, just like any other plain rice to us.

This is a great recipe!! I have the hardest time making my rice come out with texture, Mine is usually a sticky mushy mess but this recipe produces a great flavorful rice with amazing texture! My Puerto Rican husband even approved! The only thing I did differently was add a bit of Adobo, Otherwise I followed this recipe to the letter!

Holy moly, this is my holy grail rice recipe! I know, it seems silly to have sought out a recipe for white rice, but I grew up with rice made in an electric rice cooker. My father is Puerto Rican, so we ate a lot of rice and beans growing up. My mother was from Germany, and rice wasn’t a routine part of their diet. My Puerto Rican grandmother taught her how to make all the dishes, and suggested a rice cooker to make it easier. I always found the rice cooker rice to be too firm and separate (my mom used a 1 to 1 ratio). When I moved out I tried making stovetop rice with bad results. I got a small rice cooker and ended up with ok rice (I used a 1 to 1.25 ratio). Still not what I was looking for. My friend’s mother is from PR, and her white rice was so good I’d eat a bowl of it plain! I asked what her secret ingredient was, my friend said it was probably salt. I almost never served rice because the perfect pot eluded me. Until this recipe. It is so blissfully simple, yet makes a perfect pot of fluffy white rice! I use regular long grain rice, follow the directions as written, then cover and set the timer for 23 minutes (my own magic number). Once the timer goes off, I take it off the heat and let it sit covered for another 5 minutes, lift the lid off, and there is a pot filled with the happiest, fluffiest rice I’ve ever seen. Every time I’ve made it using this recipe. I swear by it and even texted the link to my therapist, who is also half PR and said rice eludes her.

Very easy recipe and came out great! I added a packet of Sazon Goya and used regular white rice. I paired this with the Ropa Vieja (shredded flank steak ) recipe by Goya.  It was delicious!

Came out good. Substituted a 14oz can of chicken broth+water to add more flavor. It never stuck to the bottom of the pan.

I think this recipe goes with everything not only beef stew.  It is very simple to do.  I love with puertorican style chicken stew (pollo guisado) and pink beans... and don't forget the tostones o ripe plaintains.

really enjoyed making rice this way.  rice water boiled away quickly so i added some more water to it. it did stick to the bottom of the pan but not as badly as it could have without the added water. just scraped the rice off the pan and stirred it in with the rest.  tasted very   nice.   thanks for sharing!

This is wonderful "sticky rice". I added a cube of chicken bouillon instead of salt, and stopped the boiling a little sooner than directed, but did boil off a considerable amount of water first. Very delish and will make this regularly. 5 stars after my little changes.

THANK YOU!  I finally learned how to make white rice the way Perto Ricans make it!!!!!  I love the way they make their white rice that I could eat it every day.  I have asked so many of my PR friends how they made their white rice and not one of their recipes have made the rice taste authentic!  I make rice almost everyday cause my daughters and I love it but I never could figure out how to get it to taste and have that delicious texture.  Now don't get me wrong....I am an expert at making rice but thank you for over 20 years, you taught me the secret!!!!!!

Great recipe overall. However, my mom would say, “está soso”(it’s bland). Just add a little more salt and you should satisfy any Puerto Rican mom or cook!

All good. Get the crispy bottom (pegao) that comes off with a spoon. My daughter loves it. We used to fight for it growing up.

Top notch.  Following the directions, I got great results.  The rice consistency is very different than what you get when you use a rice cooker.  The grains were drier and a bit chewy giving it a great texture. The rice tasted a wee bit salty. One draw back is cleaning the pan. Despite the oil, there was a layer of rice stuck to the bottom. This is a keeper.

Great recipe! I make this rice every time with beans and it comes out perfect each time. I do add a little garlic powder to the boiling water at first for just a tiny hint of garlic. Will make again and again!

I made it exactly as the recipe is written and it was good. Better than the directions that came with the rice. I'll make it again that's for sure.

The trick is "salt to taste " also in spanishe/puerto rican cooking white rice is the base of many other dishes that usually create a sauce for the rice ... The crispy Pegao is the best part mmm love the rice thanks !!

I love this recipe! Very simple, easy, and quick. Versatile too! When I made it, the rice came out beautifully. I replaced the water with chicken stock, and didn't add salt, it was really good. Definitely recommend this recipe.

This rice is so great....it made me feel like I was back in PR!  My only complaint is that it sticks to the pan really bad but I think it is totally worth it for the rice!  Awesome tasting.

My family loves this rice. Even my picky 2 year old daughter loves to pair this rice with bistec. I just add a little minced garlic to the oil and it comes out perfect!!! Also great with porkchops

As plain and easy as this recipe is, it was very very tasty. Probably the best rice I ever made, that's not really saying much but... you know. I did accidentally add too much salt to it (way too much), but it still tasted yummy. The good thing is that I have all these things in my pantry. With this economy, I can't afford to cook gourmet meals, so this is perfect.

I've been making rice for about 30 years and this was truly the perfect rice.  I only made 4 servings and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Lately I've been making my rice in a plastic microwave cooker and had forgotten how good really well cooked rice is.  I'll always use this recipe from now on.

I wasn't a fan of this by itself, but then again, I'm usually not a fan of white rice. I threw some chicken (Cheddar Chicken) on top, and it was fantastic!

I cooked a roast in the slow-cooker and used the broth in place of 1/3 of the water. I cooked it in the rice cooker so I didn't have to watch it, turned out great! Thanks!

This was really good but not as flavorful as I was expecting based on previous reviews. A nice change from regular steamed rice.

I have tried to make basic white rice the way my mother in-law makes and finally this recipe did it! Mine did not come out mushy, FINALLY! Loved it!** I use medium grain rice and decrease water by 1/4 cup.
