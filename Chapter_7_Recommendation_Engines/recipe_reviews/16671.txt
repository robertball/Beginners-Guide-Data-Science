My grocery store doesn't carry raspberry vinegar so I used a combination of red wine vinegar, white vinegar, & pureed raspberries. Also added about 1 Tablespoon of poppyseeds. Delicious!!

Fabulous vinaigrette! Easy to make, yet tastes better than anything you'd get in a bottle. I used olive oil vs. veg. oil, cut the sugar in half and added a little seedless raspberry jam to bring out more of that wonderful raspberry flavor. Poppyseeds would be a great addition, but this was fine as is and was perfect over mixed salad greens with thin sliced red onion, toasted walnuts, dried cranberries and a bit of feta cheese sprinkled over top - YUM!

fabulous! fruit vinaigrettes are a nice alternative. I half the amount of sugar, however. This dressing goes nicely on my favourite salad - lettuce, manderine oranges and roasted almonds.

This is the best raspberry vinaigrette ever, and it's so simple!  The 2nd time I made it, I used Spelnda instead of sugar, and it was still great.  I use it on a spring mix with carmelized walnuts.  Nobody can get enough of it!!

I used rasberry balsamic vinegar as did a few others who have rated this recipe and about half the sugar. Sweet and tangy! Definately a keeper.

I don't like vinaigrette dressing but my hubby does so I decided to make this one.  I made it with red wine vinegar and it was delicious!  I only made half the recipe because I didn't want to waste my red wine vinegar...but YUMMMM!!!!!  I added sugar to my taste instead of relying on the recipe and it was just fine.  This goes in my keeper box!  Thanks!

This is a very good refreshingly light dressing.  I used EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) and served at a dinner party over over mixed greens, with crumbled blue cheese, walnuts and dried cranberries.

This was a really good dressing.  My husband loves raspberry vinaigrette, so I made this in honor of him. I used half the amount of sugar recommended and it was just the right amount of "sweet". I tossed this together with a mixture of romaine hearts and spinach.  I sprinkled on some parmesan cheese and black pepper to finish and it was delish!!  Will definitley be making this again.  Thanks Jan

I normally do not use dressing when I eat salad (yes I'm one of *those* people), but this is a great dressing recipe. To make it healthier I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil and 1/8 cup agave nectar in place of white sugar. I also added 6 oz fresh raspberries and threw the whole mixture in my Blendtec. One word: Amazing. Thickened it up, gave it an incredibly fresh flavor and wonderful pink color. It did increase the acidity, so I will add a touch more EVOO and/or agave nectar. Really yummy with a spinach/argula/feta/mandarin orange salad combo. I agree with another user, I could drink this stuff. Delicious!

One of the tastiest, yet easiest, vinaigrette I've ever tasted. Try it with different kinds of vinegars to suit your taste. Two thumbs up!

This is a wonderfully easy and great tasting Vinagrette.  After reading the reviews I decided to stick to the recipe and it was delightful.  I used mix greens, feta, pecans and cranberries.

Thanks for a great recipe Jan :o)

As with all vinaigrette dressings, the end result varies entirely based on the oil and vinegar used.  I used olive oil for this.  Personally, I felt like the oil to vinegar ratio is off, but it could just be my vinegar.  But it was VERY watery and too acidic.  One can mask the acid with sugar, but I prefer to start with just less vinegar and taste as I go.  The sugar should complement the dressing, not mask the flavor of the vinegar.

Fabulous! Simple! Delicious! I did cut the sugar by about half. I used homemade raspberry vinegar (Raspberry Vinegar I from this site). My dressing was very pink in color from the vinegar.

Served this with a salad of mixed greens, tart dried cherries, toasted pine nuts, and herbed cheese. The salad was delicious with the dressing. I do think I will cut the sugar back when I make this again - DH likes it as is! Thanks for a great dressing.

Wow! This is the best dressing I've ever tasted. No kidding. It's sweet yet tangy. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil and added a tad more raspberry vinegar. I tossed the vinaigrette in a field greens salad mixed with walnuts, shredded carrots and sliced strawberries. The dressing was delicious when I made it but tasted even better when it sat overnight in the refigerator. I eat it at least once a week now. It's that good!

rated this a 5 even though i had a lot of changes - here's what i did; 1/4 c olive oil, 1/8 c red wine vinegar; 1/8c white wine vinegar; used 1 tblespoon raspberry preserves; 1/2 tsp dijon mustard, oregano and black pepper. added about tsp of chopped red onion, and a tsp of sesame seeds. blended the mix in my hand blender with a bit of water to adjust consistency and added sugar to taste at the very end. served with a romaine/cabbage mix (bagged lettuce) and some shredded lettuce i had on hand. Added plenty of feta cheese and light qty of chopped red onion. also added cran raisins and honey toasted almonds (salad toppers). Mixed in 2/3 of dressing before serving and it was yummmmmmmy! perfect balance of flavors.

Since I couldn't find raspberry vinegar I made some using Raspberry Vinegar I on this site. I've been looking for a recipe like this for over 10 years, since a favorite restaurant closed! I used only half the sugar and will cut that even more next time! I also used extra virgin olive oil. Because of these changes I could only rate it 4! Now it's 5+!

This salad dressing is just wonderful.  I did use half of the sugar, and at first I was afraid it was still too sweet, but once I made up the salad it was perfect.  I used green leaf lettuce, blue cheese, toasted sliced almonds and red onion.  My dad actually licked the bowl.

I needed a nice salad dressing one night, had these ingredients on hand and decided to give it a try. Now I use it all the time. It's great as a dressing (I tossed it with fresh greens, rolled a chunck of goat cheese in bread crumbs and heated it the oven, dropped it in the middle of the salad and it was excellent) but I also use it all the time as a marinade for Salmon. My only criticism is the amount of sugar. I use about 1/2 the amount called for.

I've rated this recipe before. I'm on my lunch break right now and I'm eating tomatoes with a version made with real raspberries. If you ever have any fresh raspberries in your house, mash them through a strainer and use the pulp in this recipe. You won't be sorry! I then use champagne vinegar to cut down on the tartness. There is nothing else like it. YUM!

Yum, thanks for this recipe! I used walnut oil, a raspberry wine vinegar we bought from an artisan at the farmer's market in Belgium, and halved the sugar.  I think I could drink it, it's that good!  I used it on an arugula salad with feta and it was amazing!

Yum! I used olive oil, but otherwise I followed the recipe. For the salad I used Spring greens and some iceberg and romaine, dried cranberries, sliced almonds, a little chicken cut into small peices, a white nectarine cut into small peices and a little crumbled blue cheese. It was the best salad I've ever made! (I love fruit and nuts in salads) You could actually add any favorite fresh fruit, ie. strawberries,  pears, peach. It was very similar to salads I've had at nice restaurants. It was just what I was looking for and so easy to make. Thanks!

This is great! I took the suggestion of a reviewer and used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was definitely sweet enough. It went on a salad of mixed tart greens (arugula, radicchio, etc.). I received many compliments for it.

Very good, but agree with other reviewers that you can dramatically reduce sugar.  I cut sugar in half, and next time I will cut even more.

Very good!  I made this recipe using raspberry vinegar I made (Raspberry Vinegar I on this site).  As others suggested, I cut the amount of sugar by half, which was perfect  My only complaint is that this seemed too oily to me, but that won't keep me from making this again.

This has quickly become a favorite. It's the lightest, tastiest salad dressing I've tried in years and I love it. It's excellent on chicken and pork also. Such a versatile dressing and so simple to make!!

Yuuuummmmmm!!!  This dressing was so delicious!  I just made enough for one salad and it turned out great.  I made a green   salad with green apple slices, walnuts and feta cheese.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil because vegetable oils especially canola oil is so bad for you. My husband was literally licking the dressing out of the bottom of the salad bowl.  I will definetly make this dressing again.

Yum!  This is exactly what I was looking for!  I made it for a spinach and dark leaf lettuce salad with garlic herb feta and carmelized almonds.  My only modification to the recipe was to use 1/2 the sugar called for.

I made this 3 times over the holidays and it had people licking their lips and begging for the recipe.  Serve this over spring mix greens, crumbled blue cheese, walnuts and chopped tart apples and everyone will think you're the queen!

This is fantastic!!! I also reduced the amount of sugar as suggested by other reviewers, and I used extra light olive oil.  I made this for a group of people and they all hounded me for the recipe.  Even the non-salad eaters had seconds so that they could have more dressing.

Jon says: "I liked it.  Different from the usual Italian dressing."

Angie says:  "A little too sweet so I added salted sunflowerseeds to the salad.  I also modified the recipe by using extra virgin, light olive oil. The oil gave it a slight olive flavor which went well with the oregano."

Very good vinaigrette! It's a keeper, for sure. Although I did follow other reviews suggesting to use only half the sugar listed in the recipe (1/4 cup is enough for me). Also, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. It's a well-balanced dressing which I will regularly prepare.

I've made this twice, but since I don't have raspberry wine vinegar, I did 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup raspberry preserve, and used less sugar (1/4 cup). SO GOOD! My co-workers have asked me for the recipe ever since I brought some with my salad to the office one morning. Delicious!

this was AMAZING. so tangy and good! i made a couple of modifications with the sugar and oil ratio.  i used 1/4 cup vegetable oil + 1/2 cup of olive oil and only a 1/4 cup of sugar. i don't like seeing sugar in dressings, so i microwaved it for one minute in a microwave save salad dressing container to help meld the flavors and dissolve the sugar. mixed well, allowed to come to room temperature, and chilled for a couple of hours before serving.  i made this in the morning and it was super easy and so so good!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was pretty good. Second time around, I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil & cut the sugar to my tastes; and I really enjoyed it.
I can't wait to try this again, with candied pecans, gorgonzola cheese & pears. YUM!

This is delicious dressing, although i changed two things.  In place of vegetable oil, i used olive oil.  I also substituted (using less) pure maple syrup instead of the sugar.

Very very good!!  I did what others suggested and put about 1/8 cup sugar and 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup raspberries...so good!!!  The sweetness was perfect for me since I'm not big on super sweet dressings.

Awesome dressing!! I use just under 1/2 the sugar it calls for - I have already made it twice in 2 weeks and will be making it often!! I use my magic bullet to mix it up.

Oh this dressing is WONDERFUL! Everyone was raving about it when I made it for a spinach friut salad I took to a church potluck. I did make some changes because I didn't want to run to the store to buy more ingredients. I used brown mustard instead of dijon, 1/2 raspberry balsamic vinegar 1/2 red wine viegar instead of the raspberry wine vinegar, and Splenda in place of the sugar. Turned out great.

I tried this recipe because I did a raspberry ricotta salad with raspberry vinaigrette from a magazine, the salad was delicious but the vinaigrette was not; to salty for my taste. I then tired this recipe and WOW, I only suggest to stay back on the dijon, add one teaspoon and taste, if you feel it needs more add half a teaspoon. Also it tastes better with olive oil than with vegetable oil. Mine turned out pink because I mixed it on a blender, it looking cute.

pretty good... used pureed raspberries as I didn't have raspberry vinegar, which made a pretty pink colour... used combo of balsamic vinegar and red wine vinegar.  I thought quite vinegary too and ended up adding the full amount of sugar to counteract this... still looking for "perfect" recipe... :)

OMG....excellent.  I shared this with a friend that owns a restaurant and now she makes her own!  I can not put enough positive adjectives in this review to descibe.  But the second time I made it, I personally cut back on the sugar because for my personal taste it was too sweet.  Having said that, you should know I am not a sweets person.  Enjoy!

This was really good. I used red wine vinegar and 1/2 cup frozen raspberries instead of the raspberry vinegar. I also used olive oil and 4 T of Splenda. It was perfect for our taste. My ds had seconds. I was surprised as he usually only uses store bought Ranch. :) I used it on one of my favorite salads: Cheese, Fruit Toss Salad from the Food Nanny on BYU T.V.

I was looking for a use for my homemade raspberry vinegar (just added raspberries to white wine vinegar and let it sit for a few days..), and thought this was great.  I added less than half of the sugar, and it was still pretty sweet.  I also used a combination of olive and avocado oil.  I'll be making this a lot.  I love it with feta.

Raspberry is not a fav of mine, but I do like it as a dressing for my salad. I was not sure about the ingredients but I am so glad I made this tonight for my spinach salad. The flavor was great. I used less sugar, next time I will use less oil. A little oily for my taste.   I also brought some raspberry jam, incase the vinegar was not strong enough. The original recipe was so good, I did not want to add the jam, but if not it would have just sat in the pantry. With the addition of the jam, I got the thickness and color of a local restaurant dressing. In this case less sugar made the difference with the addition of the jam.  Next time I will use this recipe with the following modifications, less sugar and less oil.

This recipe was tasty and easy to make. I used balsamic vinaigrette instead of raspberry, regular mustard, and added some honey to setback the tangy 'kick' that makes my mouth water just thinking about. Will make again. Thanks!

This was a fabulous dressing. I was looking for something that would change up my boring salads and this was it! I have a big sweet tooth and this was still a tad tood sweet for me. Next time I will use 1/4 sugar and I will try extra virgin olive oil since it's WAY better for you.

Outstanding!  I also used olive oil as opposed to vegetable oil and switched out the sugar for splenda, it was still amaizing.  The splenda did not thicken the dressing quite as much as sugar would have though so next time I will add some thickener to the dressing.  I used this on a steak salad with pecans and my wife said it was better than any restraunt salad she has ever had.

I always make sure have some of this in my refrigerator, it's that good! Also has a nice shelf life. Like others have suggested I reduce the sugar by half, have used Splenda, and olive oil instead of canola oil.

This recipe was simply delicious, I did cut down on the sugar by half, and then also added about 2 Tbl. of frozen raspberry juice and a tsp. of poppy seeds, a real winner!

I doubled the recipe and used it over mixed green leaf and red leaf lettuce with cherry tomatoes, sliced avocado, artichoke hearts and sprinkled with walnuts. Served a party of ten and everyone raved! I passed the recipe out to several of the guests. Thank you!

Enjoyed the easy receipe.  Loved the mild raspberry flavour, with the sweet taste.  Great in my 'Martha's Vineyard' salad, of Boston Bibb, sweet red onions, pine nuts and crumbled blue cheese.  A taste sensation. Everyone raves!

I found this recipe to be very tasty with an interesting combination of flavors.  I used Kalamata olive oil and raspberry balsamic vinegar.  I agree with many of the reviewers that 1/2 cup of sugar just seemed like way too much.  I wasn't sure how much to start with so I measured a 1/2 cup of sugar and put it aside.  Then I started by just adding 1 T. of sugar at a time.  I think using balsamic vinegar, which is sweet, helped to cut the tartness. To my surprise I never added more than the 1 T.  I also added 1/2 tsp. water, also helping to cut the tartness.  I served it over a green salad with thin slices of red onion, chilled asparagus spears, cold thin slices of grilled chicken breast, homemade bacon bits, avocado, red chili glazed pecans, fresh pear slices, gorganzola cheese and a few other veggies that I had on hand.

This was quick and EASY. Made my salad 10x better. I did make a few changes. I used 3 packets of truvia sugar instead of the white sugar, 1 crushed garlic clove, and extra virgin olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. It was Perfect.

I made this dressing for Blueberry Walnut Salad, also on this site.  It was an excellent choice for that salad, but would be good on any number of salads.  I won’t hesitate to make this again as is, no changes necessary!  6/24/15 UPDATE:  I made this again, but this time I felt it was way too sweet, however the flavor is still excellent.  Next time I will cut the sugar back by half and continue to add more, if needed, to taste.

Used olive oil and raspberry vinegar and cut the sugar in half.  Also added a touch of raspberry preserves after tasting it, as others suggested, to give it a little more berry taste.  I think it came out great (and is plenty sweet), with the exception of the oregano - I had my doubts about using it, but did, and I think next time, I'd try a more subtle herb like thyme or marjoram.  I don't think the oregano does anything for this recipe and stands out a bit much for my taste.

Outstanding!  I used raspberry balsamic vinegar and it came out great!  Update:  added 1/2 cup fresh raspberries, used a 3:1 ration of white wine  vinegar and raspberry balsamic, cut down on the sugar.  Even better!

Delicious! As per others, I used half the amount of sugar and found it quite sweet enough. Same feeling the second time using this recipe using cranberry vinegar instead of raspberry. Very versatile, I'd say. Do try it!

I would like to add, if using raspberry jam or jelly, use the blender!  This recipe is only as good as it is shaken, I learned hard way and had my oil seperate even after shaking it a lot.  I gave it 5 stars because I modified it and would not be fair to rate it lower as I loved the flavor.  My mistake in not using the raspberry vinegar

Used apple cider vinegar, left out the sugar and added 2 tablespoons seedless raspberry jam .  The dijon really added an expected depth of flavor and we love it.  Thanks!

This is very good dressing served over baby greens with some crumbled goat or feta cheese, dried cranberries and toasted walnuts. (All measured to taste). The first time I tried it I made it as printed, but I found that raspberry balsamic tastes even better.  I also cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, as it's quite sweet with the lessened amount. When I used this dressing on a salad that I made for my 80 year old father, he said it was the best salad he ever had in his life (and that is saying something)!! And someone always asks for the recipe when I make it. It tastes like a dressing you would get in a fine restaurant.

For the first time, I created a better raspberry vinaigrette than a restaurant. We drizzled this over grilled chicken on a bed of spring mix greens, grape tomatoes, thin sliced red onions, black olives, and sprinkled the top with crumbled blue cheese and toasted walnuts. Outstanding. Thank you.

Cure for the summer time food blahs!  This is outstanding.  A reason to make salad!  I used raspberry balsamic vinigar (from Walmart) and 1/4 cup of sugar, otherwise didn't change a thing.  It was plenty sweet.  I served it over a spring mix salad, with strawberries, pecans, dried cranberries, thinly sliced sweet onions, and crumbeled blue cheese.  The flavors went together perfectly.  My husband who is a salad bore and only orders house salads with Ranch dressing devoured it and ate seconds. I am always saying " How do they make these restaurants salads so good?"  Well now I know!  Mine was as good as any I have had anywhere.  I can't wait to have dinner guest so I can wow them with this salad and dressing.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.  Absolutely delicious.

I enjoyed this recipe very much and added a few twists of my own. I did not have any raspberry wine vinegar so I just used red wine vinegar and added some fresh raspberries instead. I also found it a bit too sweet and will use only a tablespoon of sugar next time and olive oil. Toss it up with some spinach leaves, rocket, strawberries, avacado, mango, celery and sesame seeds - perfect for summer and it tastes as good as it looks!

This was fantastic!  I used the amount of sugar called for in the recipe, olive oil instead of vegetable and I had raspberry basalmic vinegar, not wine vinegar.  I served it on Beautiful Salad (baby spinach, cranberries, mandarin oranges, almonds and feta)  It was a huge hit!  The sweetness of the dressing cut the sharpness of the feta and balanced with the spinach very nicely.  I am glad to read it stores so well, because I will definately be keeping this on hand!  It's nice to have a sweeter dressing that goes so well with the peppery greens that are so good for you!  Thanks Jan!

03/20/05  Not having raspberry vinegar, I used strawberry vinegar.  Can't say that it was "wow" but rather, "ok, good."  I think next time, I will add a touch of appropriate jelly/jam (raspberry jam with raspberry vinegar or strawberry jam with strawberry vinegar) as part of the suagr for a more pronounced taste.  08/25/19 Made with 3/4 cup Penzeys Raspberry Enlightenment. Much better although still a light tasting of raspberry.

I had raspberry vinegar, not raspberry wine vinegar. I used Mac Nut Oil & Splenda- in half the amount of sugar. I had the first serving & loved it. My husband tried it- & the next thing I knew, the empty bottle was in the sink!!! My advice: don't halve the recipe like I did- it doesn't last!!!

This dressing is wonderful over a salad of baby lettuces and raspberries.  I used only 1/4 cup sugar.  Delicious and fresh tasting.

I thought this recipe was great just the way it was written.  I started with just 1/2 the sugar because of the other reviews I had read, but I found I liked it best with the full amount. I served it over baby mixed greens from our garden with craisens, blue cheese, bacon, and pine nuts.  This will be a regular item around here.

I recently tried to make this and it didn't turn out for me.  I am not entirely sure I didn't do anything wrong though.  I thought it tasted really, really oily.    I tried to see if I did something wrong and I followed the recipe again exactly.  I doubt I will make this again, it wasn't what I was looking for in taste.

Excellent dressing we cut it to a serving for (4) and used walnut oil, and reduced sugar by 1/3, plus added chopped walnuts to the greens.

I've found this recipe to become a "basic" in my kitchen.  Although I prefer to make it a little less sweet.  I add about 1/2 the recomended sugar and a complimentary additional ingredient is feta cheese before a quick whirl in the blender. mmmmmm

This dressing was delicious!! I used EVOO and white balsamic raspberry vinegar. I decreased the sugar to 2 tablespoons, which was plenty to me. I served it over baby arugula with crumbled goat cheese and dried cherries. My whole family raved about it.

This was good on the Royal Riviera Pear, Raisins by Alice, and Tangerine* salad.  Alice said, “Excellent”

Not having the raspberry wine vinegar, or the Dijon mustard, I used our raspberry flavoring syrup with white vinegar, and the Dijon honey mustard.  Since both of the substitutions contributed to the sweetness, it was okay that I used a little more vinegar and an equal amount of canola oil.  The raspberry syrup added to the vinegar came up to the 2/3 cup line.

*We don’t see much yield of tangerines likely to come this year from our one tree.  The tangerines were the seedless and sweet “Cuties” variety from the local store.

This recipe is amazing! Way better than any bottled vinaigrette that you can buy.  I used a white balsamic raspberry vinegar because that is all that my grocery store had and it was perfect.

This was a very good recipe.  I found I needed raspberry vinaigrette for another recipe I wanted to try (Strawberry and Feta Cheese Salad!) but did not have any on hand.  I did, however, come across this recipe and found that I had everything for it.  I used red wine and white vinegar and pureed raspberries (a useful suggestion for another reviewer) to substitute for the raspberry vinegar.  I also reduced the sugar.  Awesome!

Love this recipe!  It's light and refreshing and goes with any number of salad ingredients.  I halved the sugar and it still turned out great.  I served it on a salad of mixed baby greens, gorgonzola cheese and walnuts.

I made this using Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar and 1/4 cup sugar and thought it was a keeper.  Try the balsamic - it has a sweetness of it's own!! Forgot to say I added 1 teaspoon of mayo which helps any dressing hold an emulsion.

Great dressing! I didn't have the raspberry wine vinegar either, so I used apple cider vinegar in place and added a tablespoon of boysenberry jam. Delicious! The Dijon mustard really added good flavor. If you do add the jam, I would suggest cutting back on the sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

I don't usually eat salad but this dressing was soooo good! My husband & a friend ate 2 servings each cuz of the dressing. (they never eat salad) I used raspberry balsamic vinegar instead and add half of the sugar requested. I also added a little bit of balsamic vinegar to make it more tart. Love it! Everyone raved about the dressing and was begging for the recipe.

I love this dressing.  I cut the sugar down by more than 1/2 but actually substituted Splenda and it works great.  I also cut down the oil by approximately 1/3.   So good....

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  This dressing was so delicious, like one of the other reviewers said, I wanted to drink it.  I'm a sweet dressing person so the sugar was fine with me.  I did use Red Wine Vinegar like others because it's all I had in the house and it was delicious.  I have a non-salad eater 9 year old who still didnt eat her salad but said she really liked the dressing.  Easy to prepare and the 5 year old enjoyed shaking it up.  I didnt have oregano (but I bought some after dinner last night) so I used parsley for a little more color.  I recommend this dressing to anyone who loves sweet dressing and it's so easy to make.

This was a good dressing that can probably quite versatile.

I made 3 serving size since I didnt want any left overs.  I used olive oil instead of vegie oil and red wine vinegar and some raspberry jam instead of the raspberry vinegar.  I used as much sugar as I needed for my tastes (not the full 1/4 cup it called for).  

I also used a blender to blend everything together and it came out like a mayonnaise based dressing (even though there is no mayo in this recipe) so I can get all the flavors together at one bite.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

I used about 5 organic frozen raspberries as well and regular white vinegar because that's all I had.  I used half olive and half vegetable oil, but next time will use all vegetable oil because I think the flavor goes better with the sweet.  I also used only half the sugar called for, as recommended, although the only dijon mustard I had was honey dijon so that added a little sweet.  I whirred it up in the blender and it was great!  Everyone at the dinner party loved it -- even my kids loved it and ate salad, which they usually don't do!  This would be great for a Valentine's Day lunch salad with the pretty pink color...

I have been looking for a raspberry vinaigrette dressing that tastes similar to one we enjoy at a local restaurant.  This one is very close.  Try it as is, or make your own adjustments, but one thing that you should do if at all possible is to blend all the ingredients with some kind of blender.  A hand blender works just fine.  You’ll be much happier with the results, trust me. There is just no way to blend these ingredients well by just shaking them in a bottle.

My aunt tasted this dressing at my house when she was visiting from Korea and now I have to make a bottle and send it to her via airmail because she loved it so much!

To make a salad like a  5-star resturant, I cut up Roman and Redleaf lettuce. Put it in a bowl of ice water let stand 10 minutes (or you can put it in the refregerator over night) then spin it in a salad spinner. Cut up little slivers of red onion and spinkle a few on top. Make my published recipe of old-fashioned pecans and add a few on top then drizzle Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing. This is my version of a 5-star salad!

EXCELLANT!  I just made this salad dressing tonight for a family dinner.  I used Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil and also added a little less sugar than called for.  After I made it, I tossed in a 1/2 tsp of minced garlic.  My family couldn't get enough of it!  The salad bowl was practically licked clean!  
Next time, I may try the raspberry wine vinegar just to see how it tastes...I'm sure it will be wonderful.  Keep in mind, if you use the Balsamic vinegar, the salad dressing will be very dark.

It was GOOD!!  Instead of a wine vinegar I used a raspberry vinegarette.  Also, I didn't have any dijon mustard or oregano so I omitted those items and it was still very good.  Even my 8 year old boy thought it was good!

My husband and I love this dressing!  We make it just as the recipe says and it comes out perfect every time.  We both agree that it does taste best if made a few hours before serving so the flavors can mingle.

This dressing was fantastic!  And even better, it was easy to make.  I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup and we used a mix of olive oil and canola oil.  My husband kept asking "you made this?"

Followed the advice of others and cut sugar in half.  Used Kozlowski Farms Red Raspberry vinegar which was a lovely deep red color.  Mixed greens, thinly sliced red onion, raspberries and feta cheese completed the salad.  Won't ever buy raspberry vinaigrette from the store again!

Great recipe. Made own raspberry vinegar. 

Raspberry Vinegar:
In large stainless steel pan, place 2 pints ripe red raspberries. Cover them with one pint of cider vinegar. Let stand in cool place for 3 days. Strain liquid and store in sterile, well-corked glass bottle.

Wow, way too sweet! And I even halved the amount of sugar! I had to add more vinegar and oil just to be able to use it! I should have listened to the other reviewers and 1/4 the amount of sugar. I still have some left, and it is still way too sweet...I think I will add more balsamic vinegar, just to give it a bit more zing for the next salad.

This is wonderful. The only reason we gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is, for our tastes it would have been very sweet. We listened to other reviewers and cut the sugar in HALF.  After tasting, we felt it was missing some depth, so we added 1/2 t of aged balsamic. Added a little smokiness and the depth we were seeking. Very good recipe.

I will never be buying store bought raspberry vinaigrette again after making this recipe.  It is delicious.  Followed the recipe to a tee, however did not have the dijon mustard on hand and did not sub anything in place of. Fantastic as it was, will try the mustard next time. I imagine it would just add a little zip.  Thanks, Jan W.

I made this dressing for a catering event and went over fantastic.  Used a spring mix and romaine mix w/ candied pecans (recipe from another site), strawberries, red onion, soft goat cheese and this fabulous dressing. Awesome.

This is a great combination. I don't use white sugar very often, so I replaced it with liquid honey. I would also suggest maple syrup as a substitute for the sugar. I served it over baby romaine with feta, sliced strawberries, red peppers, and julienned cucumber. Nuts would be great (probably slivered almonds) but there was an allergy concern this time.

I made this vinaigrette dressing a few weeks ago and I forgot to review it. This dressing was good, the only thing I changed was olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

I made this at work and it was a huge hit.  I plan on using it this summer on a salad we will offer our customers.  The only change I made was making with olive oil.

this dressing is amazing.  i've been using it on a salad made with mixed greens, almond slices, grilled chicken, and mandarin oranges.  it's now my favorite lunch.  soooo good.  yum yum yum.  
i forgot to mention that i did use raspberry balsamic vinegar - awesome.  and i didn't use white sugar, i used cane sugar - and not quite as much.     mmmmm...  delicious.

Ok I admit I changed the recipe a bit but the basics are there! I used red wine vinegar and grape seed oil, only 1 Tbsp. sugar and added some dried basil and tarragon. It came out really great..a nice, mellow, fresh-tasting dressing. A great go to recipe if you're out of dressing or prefer home made like I do!

I used raspberry balsamic, which made it sweeter I also used evoo- I just think it is better for you.  I think I would cut back on the sugar for a regular salad.  That is just a personal preference.  I also used fresh oregano- its growing out of control!  It was good.

Very nice dressing - I substituted splenda and used only half the amount and it was definitely sweet enough.  Might reduce a little more next time.  Thanks for sharing!  I served this on the Tri-Pepper Salad recipe also on this site.  Nice pairing!

This recipe is great, I didn't have the rapsberry vinegar so I substituted it for red wine vinegar and 1/4 C frozen organic raspberries.
It was too sweet so now I use 1/4 C sugar.

Wow, I am never buying this in the store again!! I loved it and my company raved about it. I could only find raspberry balsamic vinegar so it's a darker dressing but still oh-so-tasty. I used just a hair under what the recipe called for with the sugar and I thought it was perfect.

This dressing is awesome!  I served it this last week at a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I put it on a pear and walnut salad with dried cranberries and feta cheese.  I substituted olive oil and left out the oregano.  Several of my guests left with the recipe!

I love this dressing! My husband and I eat it all the time. I use extra virgin olilve oil, and use the correct amount of sugar (maybe a bit more). I made it for my mom and it is her favorite dressing. We like to eat it on baby spinich leaves, with crushed blue cheese and pecans on top! Thank You!

The best salad dressing I ever had and the best I ever made!  I used raspberry balsamic vinegar as someone else suggested.  I made a salad with lettuce and baby spinach, which was a little bitter so the raspberry flavor complimented it well.  I also added cherry tomatoes, walnuts, seedless grapes and apples to the salad.  It was a hit!

Excellent! After trying several other raspberry vinaigrette dressings, this is the one. My kids have started eating salad again because of this dressing. My husband loves it too. So much tastier and healthier than store-bought dressing.

Swap out the sugar for honey, and the vegetable oil for avocado oil and this is the bombdiggity!! I make this in half batches because we don't use a lot of it, but the leftovers also make a really good marinade for chicken.

I used this dressing to accompany Apple Almond Crunch Salad from this site.  I went a little short on the sugar but otherwise followed the recipe.  I love using all the different types of vinegar.  Mine was a white balsamic raspberry vinegar that I picked up at HomeGoods.  Thanks for your recipe, JAN W!

I  replaced the sugar with seedless raspberry spread, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. One of my favourite dressings!

This was so simple and delicious! I used what I had on hand and made this in mere minutes. I, too, had no raspberry vinegar--no sweat! I used  1/2 cup of seedless raspberry preserves (all fruit type), and skipped the sugar altogether. Whisk in a bowl to incorporate the jam-like preserves then pour into a dressing bottle. Perfect!

This was great!  I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil.  I didn't have raspberry wine vinegar, so I used 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1 heaping Tbsp. low cal raspberry preserves.  Used raw sugar to decrease calories. Everything else I made the same.  Loved it!

We substituted apple cider vinegar for the raspberry vinegar. A little too sweet and not acidic enough.  But pretty good.

THIS IS FABULOUS. It is so good, I can't believe it! I did make some changes though. Instead of 1/2 cup sugar, I used 1/4 cup os stevia and put in half the amount of oregano.  This vinaigrette is SO versatile, it accompanies almost any salad. Delicious!

Outstanding! As suggested by others I used half the sugar, and it was perfect. If possible use the very best raspberry vinegar you can find ... it makes a difference.

This is really great!  I used a little less sugar than called for, due to me liking twang from the vinegar more than the sweetness from sugar.  Personal preference.

I'm not even a big raspberry vinaigrette person normally, but this is fantastic!  I think the dijon mustard gives it just the right flavor.  Will definitely make again!

Making this was really a breeze to me... just measured and combined all ingredients and shake it!! Made this vinaigrette dressing last week and let it sit in the fridge overnight before serving with salad. Delicious and super easy! I too, used extra virgin olive oil (only halved suggested quantity), added a dash of cracked black pepper and bit of salt. As for sugar, I followed exactly coz like my dressing to be on the sweet side. Definitely WILL make it very regularly!

Delicious, just like a restaurant.  I, too, used olive oil instead of vegetable and used Splenda.  Will definitely make again.  I used this on Missy's Candied Walnut Gorgonzola Salad from this site and it was wonderful.

I liked this recipe a lot.  It is good as it is, but is also nice to experiment with.  I didn't have raspberry vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar and some raspberry jam.  That was great -- just reduce the sugar to taste.  I also added a dash of salt and a few dashes of poppy seeds!  It is great and easy to make!  Shake up right before serving.  I also like it drizzled over a veggie plate.

This is an excellent dressing. I don't add as much sugar as the recipe calls for and it is fine. It depends on how sweet you like your salad dressing.

Amazing dressing. I made it for Mother's Day dinner with mixed spring greens, sliced canned pears, dried cranberries, walnuts and blue cheese. It was everyone's favorite part of the meal. However, I only used 1/4 cup of sugar as opposed to 1/2. That's the secret. Thanks for this great recipe!

I was looking for a dressing that would go great with Salmon. I decided on this one with 2 minor changes. I too reduced the sugar by half but also omitted the oregano and substituted tarragon. It was fantastic over the salmon that my husband grilled. What a beautiful presentation too with the salmon sitting on a bed of crisp lettuce surround with all of the other yummy ingredients. I love salads and I don't think I've ever had a salad from a restaurant that was this outstanding. Thanks!!

I was craving some raspberry vinaigrette, so I made this recipe, and it was AMAZING. I followed the recipe exactly, and we loved it. It was great served over baby spinach, almonds and dried cranberries, and a little chicken breast. I'll make this recipe again and again!

We really loved this, although I made a number of modifications. I used plain Balsamic in place of the raspberry vinagar (didn't have it), and olive oil. . .I also used some fresh raspberries, because without the raspberry vinagar, it doesn't fit it's name! I also cut the sugar by half. My family loved it, but I think it could have used more sugar! (tart. . .) It was really nice, I'll use again! (as written, most likely!)

I made this recipe & was skeptical at first. Took it to the dinner party & added to the salad there. The salad & vinaigrett was such a hit I've been asked to bring it again this week. Easy, easy, easy! I LOVE it!

Very tasty.  I serve this on top of mixed greens with dried cranberries, toasted walnuts, thin slices of red onion and blue cheese.  It is a great compliment.  The dressing is a little sweet - but exactly how I like it. Made it for two different sets of dinner guests and everyone raved.

Its very good and easy to make. I  use raspberry vinegar -sometimes put in a few fresh  or frozen raspberries if I have them --- I serve  it over baby greens with nuts, sliced red onion,  fresh fruit like silice apple, dried cranberries or cherries -YUM!

I made this for my Dad's birthday dinner tonight and it was a hit. I thought this dressing would be too sweet with 1/3 cup of sugar but it wasn't. I made it with spinach, Granny Smith apple, sweet and spicy pecans(from Trader Joes)Feta cheese and a little red onion. It was so quick and easy to make.  I will definitely make this again.

This dressing is delicious!!  I added a bit more mustard and oregano, and only used 1/4 cup of sugar.  I served it with a mixed green salad with shaved red onion, glazed walnuts, fuji apples, and feta cheese.  Everyone at my dinner party said it was the best dressing they have ever had!  Thanks for a great, easy dressing!  This one is a staple in my recipe box!

I really enjoyed this vinaigrette.  I made raspberry vinegar, so I was anxious to use it.  The 1/2 cup of sugar seemed like a lot, so I used 1/4 cup and it was still a little sweet.  Next time I will  start with 1 tblsp and add more 1 tblsp at a time trying after each addition.

This dressing was a runaway hit with my dinner guests. Like many of the other reviewers, I chose to reduce the vinegar to 1/3C and upped the oil to 2/3C.  I also cut the sugar by about half to compensate for the changed vinegar/oil ratio. For the record, I used Kozlowski Farms Red Raspberry vinegar and Kirkland Olive Oil. Thumbs Up!

Made this today, but modified: 1) 1/4 C grapeseed oil instead of 1/2 C vegetable oil; 2) 1/2 C frozen mixed berries, 1/4 C red wine vinegar & 1/4 C white vinegar instead of 1/2 C raspberry wine vinegar; and 3) used 1/4 C sugar (might try liquid honey next time).

It's very good - worth doing again! Better than any raspberry vinaigrette I've ever purchased.

I've always preferred 1 part vinegar to 3 parts oil in a vinaigrette and I started the recipe that way but with this recipe it's best as written. I followed the recipe except for the sugar and oil. Way too much sugar. I read the reviews and decided to start out with  a small amount of sugar,  1 Tbs and I still found it too sweet. I used avocado oil instead of vegetable oil. This is best made the day before  to let the flavours meld. Thanks for sharing.

I am requested by my roommates to make it again. Actually I've made it twice, both times using 1/4 cup of Smucker's Raspberry syrup and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar instead of the raspberry wine vinegar.  The sugar proved too much, so I knocked it down to 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.

I am giving this 4 stars because after reading reviews I changed the recipe up and I'm glad I did. I used extra virgin olive oil (cold press), cut the sugar and the vinegar to a 1/4 cup and added a pinch of sea salt (a bit more vinegar can be added but not a 1/2 cup).  I used this on a kale salad with red grapes feta cheese and thin sliced red onion and it paired beautifully. Green apples goes nicely with this as well. I will keep this one for the books.

I also used raspberry balsamic vinegar and half the sugar and it was still great. I liked how it was kind of savory yet sweet enough. I too served it on mixed greens with dried cranberries like some of the other posters. I will happily make this again since I just spent 11 dollars on this salad last week at a fancier restaurant. Never again, after finding this recipe! Thanks, Jan W.

Delish! Tossed a bit of this dressing with some romaine, thinly sliced honey crisp apples, candied pecans, and Gorgonzola. Next time I'll add in some thinly sliced red onion too.  I did use a good extra virgin olive oil. Kids asked this to be our "winter salad".

As did many others, I used half the sugar. I used olive oil and the raspberry vinegar I used was a balsamic. It had more flavor than my plain raspberry vinegar. The dressing was very good, but a little light on raspberry flavor. Next time, I think I will puree some raspberries into the dressing.

This was very good, just I found there was too much sugar in it. I also didn't have of the raspberry vinegar, so I too combined some puréed raspberries, red wine vinegar, and white vinegar. Next time I'll use less sugar and more raspberry purée.

This dressing is excellent, but I recommend cutting the sugar in half and tasting it.  You can always add more, can't take it back out.

This dressing was pretty good. I tweaked the recipe and omitted the sugar. 1/2 cup sugar  seemed excessive, I'm looking for a salad dressing not kool aid. So i substituted stevia as needed and it worked out quite well. Instead of vegetable oil, i used extra virgin olive oil as i do in all dressings (a million times better for you). I use it with mixed greens and slices of pears or apples and pecans.

I just made this and started by mixing the sugar and vinegar together a little at a time to get the right taste.  I'm sure I used nowhere near the half cup of sugar that it calls for. I did not have Dijon mustard so used spicy brown; it did not hurt the flavor.  I also added about an eighth of a teaspoon onion powder because I like onion powder in all my vinaigrettes.  The raspberry vinegar I used was my own homemade.  This is a yummy recipe and it's definitely a keeper.

It is so delicious, I've made it with EVOO and vegetable oil, both ways are yummy. I also recommend cutting back some on the sugar, the amount called for is not needed and some just goes straight to the bottom even right after shaking up. I also used rasberry balsamic vinegar. This is better than any storebought ones I've tried.

This is so easy to make and is comparable to the grocery store Vinaigrette Dressing. I love it! Thanks.

I needed a quick salad dressing for a fruit and spinach salad. Instead of white sugar I used agave sweetener, also added a couple shakes of onion powder and olive oil for the oil. Was wonderful on the salad.

I love this dressing! I use a bit less sugar, about 1/2 of what it calls for but that's just my preference. Otherwise, amazing!

Everyone loved it!  I made the dressing with 1/4 cup sugar and it was perfect.  Any more sugar would have been too sweet.

Awesome! Even our 11 year old liked it. I used this with the steak and spinach salad submitted by Rena and it was a hit.
