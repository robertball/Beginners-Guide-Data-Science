I have made these a few times now. This recipe is really awesome as is - but I found an easier & tastier way to do it after making it many times the way listed. I use the recipe on this site for Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Meat. Its very easy to make, & makes the tamales SO much tastier! I make the meat one day in the crockpot, then refrigerate it overnight.  This makes it easier to remove any fat. Just pluck off any fat the next morning & follow the recipe for the tamale dough, although I use vegetable shortening instead of lard. Make sure to keep a little water or beef broth on hand to dip your spreading knife into to make spreading the dough onto the corn husks a little easier. If you put a can of beef broth in the stockpot with a little water while you are steaming them, it makes the dough tastier as well.
Instead of using butchers twine, I just tear off thin strips of the corn husks & tie them with that.  

These are really good to freeze too. Place in a freezer bag, and pop in the freezer for up for 6 months.  To reheat, steam for 15-20 mins or wrap in a damp paper towel & microwave for 3-7 mins, depending on the microwave.  Steaming them will produce a moister tamale.  To reheat refrigerated tamales, wrap in a damp paper towel & microwave for about 1-2 mins.  You could also steam them for about 5 mins.  Make sure you leave the corn husk on while reheating!

if you have never attempted tamales, here are some important tips:  boil garlic and dried or fresh peppers in water(your favorite kind of pepper)for 30-ish minutes then cook the meat in that broth(leave peppers/garlic in) and add lots of spices.  This broth flavors the meat very well--I like spice so I use tons of peppers and garlic.  The meat should be cooked long enough that it practically crumbles to the touch--this makes it easier and faster to shred by hand--I usually cook mine 4 hours to overnigt depending on the cut of meat.  Boiling the meat is actually the only thing it needs cooking wise--but it depends on whether you boil in the meat in all the spices or add them later.  I soak my corn husks in hot/boiling water--this makes them softer faster.  Two important things to remember: masa is very bland and there is no substitute for lard!  I keep my meat juice for masa flavoring but still add other stuff--El Pato (mexican style tomato sauce)if you can find it is spectacular!  When making the tamales, the corn husks should only be about five inches across--any larger need to be sized!  (Line the meat along the edge and roll like a cigar)  If I plan on freezing I cook them only half the time--also, don't load to many in the steamer or they won't cook evenly!  When you place them in the steamer they need to be standing up as much as possible.

A little advice about mixing masa: add the lard to your dry ingredients and mix very well by hand. Begin adding your meat broth a little at a time until you get peanut butter consistancy, and to be really sure your batter is ready, drop a bit into a glass of water. If it floats to the top, it's ready.

A cultural note for everyone who says the tamale recipes take too long.  Traditionally a family will have a "tamalada"- a get together where family will work together assembling the tamales.  Making tamales is a time consuming process but when you do it this way, you will have an opportunity to visit with family and develop family bonds.  (It is great with friends too...)

This was my first attempt at making Tamales.  Instead of combining the masa, lard, and salt myself, I went to the local Hispanic grocery store and bought a 5lb bag of prepared masa.  I put 4 1/2 cups of water with the chuck roast.  I had 5 cups of beef stock after the roast was cooked.  I boiled the stock down to 1 1/2 cups and mixed it in with the prepared masa to get the consistency required.  I used a single 8 oz. package of husks with plenty left over.
This recipe was not a waste of time.  I prefer a little more flavor and a lot more heat than what was in this recipe, but then my wife and son would not have been able to enjoy this recipe.

This recipe is a good one but two other things should be mentioned when making Tamales, the corn husks must be very clean from the corn silk and when the Tamales are ready to be steamed they should not be standing in water or the water level should be just below the steamer rack. Also the tamales should be covered with a clean dry dish towel before the steamer lid is added. This helps keep the moisture from steeping out. I have made tamales my whole life with my mother ,grandmothers, aunts and sisters and when the steamer needs more water added we add boiling water.

This is a good recipe.  It's easy, but very time consuming.  Instead of steaming the tamales by laying them down in a basket, try inverting a bowl in a large pot and standing the tamales on end around the bowl to create a funnel effect.  It's faster and easier!

I loved this recipe! It was a bit time consuming, but well worth the effort. Everybody who tried them loved them, even those who have lived in Mexico for a couple of years. I scaled up the meat part of the recipe to use 6 lbs of rump roast (it was on sale :) and cut back the masa recipe to use 1 lb of lard and 6 cups of the corn meal masa mix. I also boiled down the water the beef cooked in so it would add more flavor to the masa when it was added. I added 2 tsp of salt to this amount of masa, and 1 Tbsp to the meat mix, and it turned out really well. I ended up using 1 8-0z package of corn husks, all of the masa that I had made, and about 1/2 of the meat for about 4 doz tamales. I have the rest of the meat frozen so it will be easier to make next time. I had a big pot and was able to fit all the tamales in (they were a little tightly packed) and steamed them for 2 hours to make sure they were done. The masa turned out nice and light and oh so tasty! Next time I think I'm going to double the amount of ancho chiles used to make them a little spicier.

Well tamales are never easy to make, but this recioe made it not very complicated..thank you!  What a wonderful taste to the meat.  I simmered the meat in a crock pot overnight, so it made the process one step better.  I used more chilis and more cumin, just because I prefer more heat.  It turned out great.  More stock is needed when making the masa harina to make it not so dry when cooked.  Be sure to get friends involved in the process...it's an ALL DAY EVENT!

FABULOUS!!  Finally I have found THE recipe!!  Very easy to make.  I couldn't find packaged corn husks, but had the produce man at the grocery store save fresh corn husks for me.  They worked out great!!  You have to try this!!

After living in PHoenix for 3 years, my husband begged me to try tamales this year. I must say, this recipe is far better than good. I read a couple of recipes, so I wandered a little from this recipe. I used the Ancho chiles, but also used 4 oz. of the New Mexico chiles. Plus I used 1 BULB of garlic for the meat preparation, as well as 1 BULB of garlic in the chile preparation. As for the chile preparation, I used a totally different method, which took far less effort. I removed stems and seeds. Then placed all chiles in stock pot with enough water to just cover them. I boiled them for about 30 minutes with 1/2 sliced onion, cumin, garlic, oregano, and white vinegar. I let this cool slightly, and then placed chiles and 2 ladles of chile broth into a blender. Blend on high for about 1 min. until thoroughly liquified. I had to do this in batches. Then I poured blended mixture into large bowl, and stirred once all of the chiles and juice were blended to incorporate it all together. This was WONDERFUL! Note that chile mixture will be slightly bitter, but flavors of the meat and the sweetness of the masa balanced this all out in the end. I cannot tell you how pleased I was with this outcome. BEST tamales ever made!!!

This takes time and patience but is worth it.  It is not spicy so it is good for kids to eat too.  You do not need 3 - 8 oz. packages of corn husks though. One would have done the job.

I have made tamales for years, and this is a good recipe. I just wanted to say that IF you love tamales but can't eat them due to the fattening nature of the ingredients, there is a very good substitute. You can use water (yes, water) instead of lard. And if you need less meat you can use the same spices in some blended blackeyed peas for the filling. Now I know this is not the SAME, but it IS quite good and would be a great way to once again have tamales even though your doctor has said 'NO.'

Having made Tamales for many many years, I prefer using pork roast. Has more flavor & juices than beef.I prefer using red chili pods, stems and seeds removed. Placed in a blender and processed until smooth. One other reminder, the lard mixed into the Masa Harina really makes a big difference in taste. I would never use veggie oil as stated by another review.

I have been making tamales at Christmas time for about 4 years now. I previously used the recipe on the masa harina bag and "tweeked" that a little bit. However after reading this recipe, I decided to try it and had very good results. For those of you who cringe at using lard, try using just the meat broth. It already has the fat rendered down and there seems to be enough fat in the broth to keep the masa formed correctly around the filling.  For the first time I used others sugestions of boiling the dried chilies together, adding some cumin and garlic and some salt. Boil in 2 cups of water for about 20 min and then cool. Remove the stems and seeds and then put in a blender. Add this mixture to the meat as it cooks. It adds wonderful flavor.  I would recommend reading other reviews and follow tips that make this easier. I never needed to soak corn husks for 3 hours.  Maybe  1 hr, just put them in a pot of hot water on the stove and med heat. They don't need to boil. Just separate  in the pot to get them to loosen up. This is a lot of work but well wort it.

This is a very authentic recipe. Authentic Mexican food is very falvorful, but not hot. It is we chili heads north of the border who have added the heat. That's called Tex-Mex. I recently had something suggested to me that cuts the time in half when making tamales. Take your tortilla press and line it with plastic or waxed paper, lay your shuck in it and place a walnut sized ball of masa, then press it down as if making tortillas, it spreads the masa, keeps your hands cleaner (clean isn't really an option when working with this :) ) and fills the shucks in no time at all. Just make sure you line that side of the press too. Also, for an interesting twist, try adding a little mole  (found in a jar in the mexican food aisle and looks like spreadable chocolate) into your masa harina mixture. You can also use either red or green enchilada mix, a really thin salsa, Louisianna hot sauce (if you want heat) and anything else you can think of. For a really interesting twist from the Yucatan, instead of using corn shucks, use bananna leaves. The flavor is incredible although you will absolutely need to tie these unline corn shucks which have a tendency to fold back up on them selves anyway. Either buy the bananna leaves at a Hispanic market or order them online.

Being a San Antonian, home of Tex-Mex, I was a bit nervous about making tamales on my very own this year. I must say, these turned out to be a real winner! I borrowed my mother's HUGE steamer(metallic, the kind that looks like a triple boiler with holes on the bottoms) because I don't have a dutch oven. I had to adjust the height of the tamales to get the lid to close, but it worked. You're supposed to steam the tamles in a semi-upright position, so I rolled a wad of foil into a ball and placed in the center. Then, I lay the tamales around the foil to form a teepee-like shape. I followed the recipe to the letter, and they are soooo delicious! BTW, I didn't feel the husks needed 3 whole hours to soften. I submerged them (almost blanched them) in hot tap water in the sink and put an inverted glass baking dish over them to keep them from floating for about 45 minutes. Very tedious, but my family had high praises! Next time, I will start in the morning as opposed to the evening and also enlist the help of a friend. I was EXHAUSTED by the time they were finished at 1:00 in the morning. I started around 9:00 in the evening. Oh, I also never bothered tying the tamales (my family doesn't do it either), and I divided the chuck roat into 2 parts and boiled them in 2 seperate pots to cut down on the cooking time. I trimmed off most of the fat, but you want to leave just a LITTLE tiny bit for flavor :)

Very authentic version.  I made extra chile sauce and added some half & half to serve over the tamales.  I also substituted shortening for lard and it worked fine.

lovely, simple recipe for a dish people tend to over-complicate.  To send this recipe right over the top into Midsummer Treat territory, use the green corn husks from your summertime fresh sweet corn to wrap the tamales.  OMG, it makes ALL the difference, lending a unique sweetness!

This was my 2nd time making tamales.  The first time I made them, I used canned red chile sauce.  They were good that way, but this sauce has a lot more flavor.  I would suggest using more than 1 cup broth.  I used about 2 1/2 c. of broth and it was  a lot saucier that way.  I will double the recipe for the sauce next time so that I have some left over to pour over the finished tamales.  Also, I used pork roast which I prepared in the crock pot the day before to save the time of having to prepare the roast the day I made them.  Very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

So after making a few changes to this recipe it was very worth of 5 stars to us..First I want to say there is NO substitute for LARD! Second we used cilantro instead of oregano, nor did we use the red pepper flakes but instead used diced jalapenos.... Very Good Recipe thanks for sharing...

This is a pretty way to make tamales but I agree with others that using pork is better.  Make sure to brown the meat, onions, and garlice before simmering with spices for better flavor.  Also, use the fatty broth strained in greater ratio to the masa and lard.  I use a teaspoon of baking powder for a fluffier dough.  To avoid soggy tamales you must place shucks in the bottom of your steamer while steaming!  Otherwise the water really soaks them.  Before eating or storing they must cool down on a sheet to firm up.  I freeze mine raw to steam fresh for parties.  Most people have never had a tamale fresh out of the steamer.  Reheated will never be the same.

My wife and I have been makin tamales for years. We've always made chicken. I'm making beef, similar to this recipe, but we are doing everything except steaming them. We are steaming a day later, will this be okay? They are in the fridge with plastic on them. Oh, and I've never used lard, and people say my tamales are delicious. We have always used butter, yup, butter. Sorry, but pig fat just grosses us out.

Wonderful recipe.  Just like Mom used to make! 

 The next day they are even better.   We would also heat them up by taking the husks of, and frying them in a small amount of oil until they are crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside, then top them with shredded iceberg lettuce and chopped tomatoes, red onion and avocado with a light vinegarette dressing.  

I know frying them does not exactly lighten up the calories, but it's the holidays and a how often are you going to make home made tamales?

To cut time and make this much easier.  I suggest buying prepared masa from a local Mexican market or supermarket that has a good Mexican selection.

These tamales turned out pretty good- They were a whole lotta work, and the recipe only made 4 dozen tamales, and I even used 5 and 1/2 pounds of meat (pork butts)  The filling turned out excellent-but I made 1 and 1/2 times the amount of sauce to simmer the meat in, and I used some chile powder from a local market instead of ancho chiles (they smelled like prunes for some reason) Also, a 8 ounce bag of shucks is plenty! My real problem with this recipe was the masa- It turned out really dry and floury-maybe it was the masa harina that I used, or maybe I didn't add enough broth to the mix.  Otherwise this was a great recipe and I will definitely make it again-as soon as I figure out what went wrong.

I want to give this more stars but I have tried to make it a couple of times and can't get my tamales to come out right, The filling is awesome but constantly having problems with the masa. I will give it 1 more shot but not for awhile since it's very time consuming. My masa seems to be to dry or has texture issues. I wish I knew what was wrong, I have watched enough videos and read reviews for tips but the results are still the same.

i prefer to buy the masa freshly made from your local mexican food store.but when you order your masa make sure you order it with cili powder mix. and i like to use beef. it takes beteer and much more tender.Just add garlic,cuman,salt,californis red chili pepper with the beef and beeh stock. it taste much better. i use the corn musk to tie together.

I changed this recipe to a vegetarian version and used spicy lentils in place of the meat, and vegetable broth instead of the lard in the masa. I didn't use the butcher's twine, instead just folded the ends and steamed them like that-I added spicy chipotle peppers to the lentils for an extra kick, and ended up with about 8 dozen. To finish them, I threw them on a hot grill to burn the husks to add a charcoal-smokiness. The finished product was smoky, flavorful, and delicious.

Nothing wrong with this recipe at all. Very Authentic. If you are not into authentic food then you may want to spice it up a bit more, but I found this recipe to be very true to authentic mexican food. I would suggest though that you make sure you have plenty of meat on hand; I thought I had enough but ended up running out of meat after about 47 of these buggers. I think you need more than four pounds but I may have not had four pounds after the cook off. I used the beef drippings to flavor the masa and had no problems. Also, I had way too many corn husks left over, I could have done with only 1 package. I dont think you have to use multiple layers of husks to wrap these, I used only 2 layers and came out just fine.

Being a vegetarian I used soy base chorizo sausage instead of meat.  
I added onions and cheese to the chorizo and then followed this recipe.
My meat eater friends and family couldn't believe the tamales were meatless. 
P.S. You can buy the vegetarian chorizo at Walmart in the produce section.

This recipe is actually very good.  I used pork carnitas and menudo seasoning along with the other spices.  I toasted my peppers with some liquid before adding everything together and seasoned my masa with more menudo seasoning for better flavor.  The picture posted of these really looks nothing like what they should.  Tamales should not be that thick and by all means should not have a red (blood like) sauce seeping from them.  Great recipe!

This recipe was a real lifesaver. I am a recent export from Texas, and was beginning to think I would die if I couldn't get my hands on some tamales. The meat was wonderful and juicy! I invited some friends over (some who had never heard of tamales, and we spent the day together making tamales and drinking margaritas. Thanks for the great recipe. Will be doing this again for Christmas. :)

My sister called me to tell me about this recipe.....i checked it out and decided to go to the grocery store to buy the ingredients that i was lacking to make them for dinner that night....I found this recipe to be incredible!!! As well as did my husband,,and he is an extremely picky eater...The recipe was easy to make, just time consuming, but worth the effort and the wait!!!! I couldnt find the peppers called for in the recipe..so i substituted with canned chili's. Im sure that it cut out a little work and didnt seem to alter the flavor!!! We topped the tamales with green chili sauce and also red taco sauce. A compliment to the flavor. Thank You Gloria for a fantastic recipe, this one is a keeper!

I used this recipe for the dough only, although I added more broth and warm water.  The dough came out way better than that they I've bought already prepared, I will use this dough every year.  I will be sending this to my sister to use as well.

The beef is so good it could be used for tacos alone.  I braised the beef in broth instead of water and added a chopped onion to add more flavor. I also added extra paprika and replaced cayenne for the crushed red pepper. I felt like the rue needed more than 1 cup, I ended using about 3 cups. I also replaced the salt with a beef bouilion cube to bump up the beef flavor. It was so delicious!!!

Some friends from Mexico several years back, came to our house and taught us to make their families' recipe for tamales. They took great pride in the making of them. We spent most of the entire day in the process; there were plenty for freezing and enjoying later. This recipe is very close but I like more liquid than called for (just makes easier spreading.)

Wow - made these today, but with Pork instead, some with just cheese. Very good and I thought easy to make...

Thanks for the recipe and easy instructions.
Also, I didn't tie mine, I just folded the bottome end over and stood them up, when steaming the tamales, I did cover the tamales with corn husks while steaming (these were things some of my latina girl friends told me to do :)...)

I used this recipe to make my very first tamales.  I was a little nervous because I was going to serve them to guests.  They turned out great and a lot easier than I expected.  Just time consuming.  My only complaint was the meat filling was kind of dry, I will need to think of some sort of sauce to add to it.  DO NOT buy as many corn husks as the recipe calls for.  I only purchased one package and I still had some left over.  Tamales are just about my favorite food around and I am so happy to know that I can make them myself now!!

These were awesome!  We had the kids help out and they made a huge mess...but they were worth it.  I asked plenty of people about making tamales and got a lot of feedback.  Not one told me that the masa sets after you take them out and allow them to sit.  I wish I would have known that. This being my first time, and learning when to take them out, they were great!

Overall, this recipe was Okay.  First I had way too much meat left over and corn husks as well.  I only used one package of corn husks.  Second, I dont know if its just my steamer or what, but I had to steam them for 75 minutes instead of the 60 (one hour) that was recommended. Third, the meat mixture really didnt have that much "kick" to it, so I added an extra chile or two, along with some other spices.  But this recipe was better than any of the other tamale recipes on here.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe. Next time I make it I will definitely increase the salt.  I did not add a lot out of fear that the tamales would be too salty.  I did find it easier to puree the peppers in my blender with a cup of the beef broth.  When I attempted to grind them in my mortar, it did not do anything.  Another difference is I added baking powder to the tamale dough because the masa corn that I purchased indicated this as a key ingredient.  My tamales came out great.  I bought 5 bags of corn husks instead of 3 and I used most of them.  I would definitely make this again.

Thanks to "Redneckwoman", I improvised my meat to include all the fixings from her recommended recipe!  Rave reviews on the meat.  Excellent idea!  I also used vegetable shortening instead of lard, but it does make for a "softer" tamale, which does not firm much even after refridgeration. 

I had enough masa afterwards, that I experimented and made Jalapeno Cheddar tamales for some of our vegetarian friends.  Yummmmm.

Tip:  Less Masa, more filling.  :)

Great recipe.  I lost the recipe I got from my friend years ago, and this one gave me a good guide.  The only difference was my friend added tomato paste and sauce to her 'gravy' that is added to the meat.  Also, when you steam the tamales, don't use water but use beef broth with some garlic cloves and chiles in it.  It will give them even more flavor, you'd be surprised! Thanks for the recipe!

So good! Everything went real well. I cooked the meat in a crockpot overnight on low. That worked out great. It didn't seem like as much work as it might have been.

The masa was too bland even after I added some extra spices to the mix and to the broth.  That didn't stop them from being very good though.  I just let my family add their own amount of salt for their own preference.  Another thing that happened to me was that my masa would not get firm.  It remained mushy even after steaming for two hours.  It was probably my own mistake, I probably had too much water in the steamer.  I solved the problem by placing the tamales in the oven on really high heat for a little while.  Just until the husks turned a little brown on the edges.  I tought they were perfect after that.  Great recipe.

This recipe is time consuming. VERY time consuming. The corn part of the tomale did not come out well at all. I tried to use shortening instead of lard, as i didnt have any lard on hand, and used the same measurements. Cooked them, and they just fell apart after you unrolled them from the husk. The beef mixture was pretty good tho, and i will try this again with lard to see if it was that or something else.

Whew!  Finished a day of making these delicious tamales.  My husband was in and out all day, so not as much help as I thought I'd have today, but I got it done with great results!!  These were really, really good.  I feel very proud of myself right now, and all I did was follow a recipe.  The flavors in these are wonderful!  I do have one question though.  Do people really use only  4 lb roast and 9 cups of masa harina for THREE packages of corn husks?  I soaked and washed a whole lot more than I needed.  The masa mix and the meat mix were spot on, and ran out at the same time.  I have no clue what to do with all the extra husks!  Thanks for posting.  Will definitely make again, only with one package of husks. :) photo of my first batch posted.

While I have not yet made this recipe, I have made tamales in the past. I lost my recipe (for amounts, etc), but the ingredients and amounts in this recipe sound right. I will post the results after they are made. My two step-daughters are coming over on 11/12/11 to make these and I am looking forward to it. I gave it five stars because it does sound perfect. I love this site because of all the comments - it always helps to see what others think.

After reading the mostly great reviews I was very excited, until I ate one after all these hours of preparation. The meat filling was tasty and juicy. It was the dough that was flavorless. I prepared exactly as stated in this recipe. I will not make this again, but at least it gave me a starting point with a good shredded beef.

This recipie is fairly easy but I think I did something wrong because my tamales turned out a little dry. I followed the recipie to the letter and I dont know were I went wrong. Maybe next time they wont be so dry.

This was my first attempt in the tamale making, and I will definately try these again; making it exactly as listed.  I took the advise of a review that said these were too greasy, and being on a diet; omitted 1 c of lard and substittuted beef broth in it's place.  Everyone loved them but I think it would be much better with the full 3 cups!  If you are going to spend all that time in the kitchen, indulge!

It really does take all day! I didn't have ancho chilies so I added more red pepper flakes. Steamed the tamales and then let them sit on the counter for about 30 minutes to harden.

Great recipe, I took the advice of other and made the meat in a slow cooker the day before.  Also, definitely don't need three-8oz packages of corn husks.

I found these to be really easy.  I was really pleased with myself, until I took off the corn husks , it just started to crumple.  I dont know what I did wrong.  Did I not add enough liquid to the masa?

I thought these were excellent! My husband on the other hand, who is very particular when it comes to tamales, said that he didn't like the masa too much... When I asked him why, he just said it didn't taste "right". However, we both agreed that the meat filling tasted great. Making these weren't difficult as I was expecting them to be, time consuming yes, but not difficult. Thanks for the great recipe!

Gloria I thank you and so does my family, this is something I've been dying to try to make. everyone said that they are hard to make. boy were they wrong!!! You spend more time waiting for the meat to cook or corn husks to soak. and the end result is fantastic! We spiced it up a bit. just because we are more "Tex-Mex". the hotter the better. I will make these again. I followed the recipe to the tee, with the exception of adding more hot spice's to the meat. very very very good and simple.

This recipe was great!  This was my first time attempting tamales and I was a little worried--they turned out so good.  I used Veggie Shortening instead of lard, and my family and I thought they were great.  This is definately going to be a "regular"  on the menu in my home!  I can't wait to try them with different meats/veggies/fruits.

I ADD MERKEN MAPUCHE SPICE. 
I found the Chilean spice about 2 years ago. It has a slightly smokey chile flavor (similar to ancho chiles). But I added about 3 tbsp to the original recipe and it really adds a wonderful flavor to the meat. I have an Asian bamboo steamer basket set that I stack on to of a large soup pot with a steamer grill at the bottom resting on a standard coffee mug. I am then able to fill the pot with water all of the way up to the top of the mug, then I begin layering the tamales, first on the steamer grill, then in the next three bamboo steamer baskets I have. It allows me to steam an entire batch at once. 

These are really tasty, can't wait to make them again. 

P.S. I get the Merken spice online. I can put it on just about everything.

I decided to finally make tamales for Christmas, and not only were these easy to make, but the meat is one of the best flavored tamale meat i have tasted.  I've used this meat recipe for shredded beef enchiladas, too. I need to work on the masa a bit, but that's more of my inexperience than a deficiency in the recipe.  As someone else mentioned, tamale making is a group event...it' a lot of work for one person!  Also, I put a black olive in the middle of the meat during the assembly process.  That is common here in Arizona.

I followed the suggestion to use Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Meat instead of the recipe's meat recipe.  The slow cooker beef was certainly tender enough but lacked almost all flavor.  I had to add the recipe's cumin and garlic and oregano and vinegar afterwards to step up the flavor.  I'll try the original recipe next time.

I really like this recipe.  I have made it many times now.  If followed exactly, I found it a little too mild spice-wise, but that is easily remedied with hotter chilies.  Also, you don't have to limit your filling options to only beef.  I have made this recipe with pork shoulder and chicken also.

This was a good recipe but it I were going to make again I would cut the amount of lard in half they were very greasy and I would add a few more peppers and my tamales steamed for about 2 hours before they were done. Thanks for sharing the recipe we really had fun making them!

I mixed the ground chiles with the beef broth then pushed it through a sieve to get rid of seeds and hard pieces of chile skin.  My husband prefers spicier tamales, so I put a small piece of jalapeno in half of the tamales.

I should have listened to everybody else when they told me tamales were an all day task! The meat was really good (I may use it for taco filling, etc.), but next time, I will cook it in the slow-cooker ahead of time. The directions were fantastic and very detailed.. great for a beginner like me! However, my only qualm with this recipe is the masa. Did I select the wrong masa? Anyhow, it was very dry. I may have to increase the lard next time (never thought I'd say that!!). Also, when we ran out of masa, I used 1/3 lard and 2/3 shortening.. big mistake.. they turned out crumbly and flavorless. I will try again next year, but will tweak the recipe some. Thanks!

So yummy! The masa harina took me a while to find, but I think it completes the dish, and am glad I was able to get my hands on some. These are quite a bit of work, but plenty well worth it in the end. Will definitely be making these again. :)

Wow! This is definitely a labor of love. Very time consuming but oh, so good! Next time I will get some of the prep work done ahead of time, like preparing ancho peppers and cooking the meat so I am not in the kitchen all day. I used a pressure cooker for the meat to save time. I served them to company and everyone loved them. I will make this again.

This was my first time making this recipe. It was a hit!  I used chicken instead of beed and though, I did not use lard for the masa. The masa I used just called for water. My husband and friends loved them.

This is the exact recipe my dear neighbor used when she taught me how to cook THE best Tamales.  Recipe from San Luis Petosi in central Mexico.  Most wonderful memories and most beautiful region of Mexico.  Lovely warm family and this memory will last my entire life.  Thank you, thank you!

Excellent recipe!  I have moved and left my recipe in storage so I was looking for an authentic Mexican recipe and this fit the bill.  I don't add the chilies.  However, I do add chili powder.

Only used the recipe for the masa and it came out very good. I plan to make the meat next time but I really like using my pork for tamales. I wish someone would post what the consistency is supposed to be like.

This was time consuming but worth it! We made extra so we could eat them all week. 
I think adding the cooking liquid to the masa made them extra special.  definately will be making these again.

This recipe was great.  I did add more spices and a lot of salt to the meat and I added all of the same spices to the masa and it turned out great.  Thank you for the recipe Christmas is complete with our tamale tradition.

this is a great recipe, very easy!  I used pork loin with NM green chiles and some chipotle peppers as well.. and they're divine.  I found the roll-up instructions a little vague, but found a bunch of websites that give you a visual.  My husband helped me roll them, and we both sort of found our own favorite method.  I will make them again soon with beef... very tasty!!

Overall this is a superb recipe, they remind me of tamales they serve at resturants on the southside of Tucson,AZ. They'll make great Christmas gifts this year! There seem to be a few too many steps, but I guess no guts no glory.

Wonderful recipe! I've made plenty. We enjoy chicken the best. We steam all of them and freeze. Microwave or steam to heat. Makes for easy dinner.

My 19 year old son and I made these Tamales for Christnas. They were the hit of the holiday!  Everyone says they are a lot of work. While I'll admit it's not microwave cooking, they really are fun to make if you love to cook!

Excellent!!!  Takes a long time to make, but well worth it.  They will cook better if the dough is about the consistency of peanut butter.  I had to add a little more liquid to get it right.

the recipe was great as far as taste goes. i never made tamales before, so i didnt know about measurements, as in, 1 bag of corn husks at 8oz is plenty, because you only get about 40 tamales out of the meat and dough. and i basically wasted 2 bags of corn husks at $5.00 each, because there wasnt enough to fill them with. well, after doing 40 i had enough...its better when you got someone helping you, as in you roll and they tie them. i also used crisco instead of lard, and it wasnt so bad with the prepping as i just let the meat simmer on my wood stove for 3 hrs and went about other business, and later steamed the tamales on there too. saving energy :) im going to have to buy another steamer pot, so i can steam all 40 at once. my steamer only holds 20 of them.

The masa wasn't bad but the meat was incredibly bland.

This was my first time making tamales, so I'm still learning and would change a few things to the recipe. I looked at a lot of different recipes and decided to add onions to the slow cooker and meat. I wish I had read the 'most helpful review' on here first since I would have added the peppers to the slow cooker since you save the juice to add to the masa for flavor. After reading the review, I did add some taco bell taco sauce inside the tamale to try to add flavor, which might have helped a bit, but the masa was a little more bland than I prefer. I also added the traditional pimento olive, which I love. Overall, they're still pretty tasty but I will probably add some enchilada sauce or something to spice it up.  I don't like very spicy foods, but I think more ancho chiles or some spicier chiles may also add more flavor. Glad that I made them, thumbs up.

Very very good.... BUT, I made some adjustments and it was quicker and tasted just like the tamales that I had in Oaxica, Mexico.
*     I used ground beef.  I added garlic and a small chopped onion.  Once cooked and drained-I used a food processor to mince the meat.  I stirred in a small jar of stewed peppers.  Once the tamales were ready to steam, I put a 9inch aluminum pan (I cut holes in it) inside a large pot. I stood each tamale up and steamed on 'medium' for about 45 minutes.  I also drenched 4-5 paper towels on top of the pot, then I put the lid on.  Served with crackers and Sirachi hot sauce....!

These turned out great...Added a few tablespoonns of mild salsa to the batter for a bit of a kick.   Made 4 dozen and family can't eat them fast enough.  Worth the time to make.....

I followed some of the suggestions from the other ladies and they came out delicious.  The only thing I'll do different next time is cook them probably about 15-20 minutes longer.

I boiled the beef in a orange salsa and pre seasoned. Much juicier and maintained most of the size of the original raw meat.

I followed this basic recipe, but used humanely harvested wild pork and I make my masa just a little different.  But this is the way to do it right. I do use quite a bit more garlic in the meat mixture and the masa and I smoke the meat for 2-3 hours prior to braising it in a crock pot until it falls apart easily.

This recipe was the best! Remember to add some beef broth to the tamales when they’re wrapped in the corn husks. The extra moisture will really be needed. Fantastic flavors. Can’t wair to make again. Keeper recipe.

These tamales were really good. I had a hard time knowing when my masa has enough liquid, so ended up taking a small amount and testing to see when I had too much liquid, then trying to match the consistency of the bulk of the masa to that just before the test amount was over-saturated. 9 cups was also way too much masa. I used maybe half, and I didn’t spread it super-thin on each tamale. The beef came out amazingly, but I did add almost 2 oz. extra mild chili powder. I added it in small amounts and to taste.

I made the recipe but I had to make a few changes.  I couldn't put the mass together with the amount of water the recipe called for.  I added approximately 1 1\2 more broth. It gave them a better flavor and easier spreading.

First off if you have never made tamales plan on 3 hours to roll the things in addition to time listed this was not easy. Also use the butchers twine the corn husk strings just keep breaking.  After soaking the corn husks for 3 hours dump the water and put hot tap water back in the hot water makes them more flexible . I added additional seasoning to the meat because it had no flavor. The masa was dry but I believe this may have been due to me using crisco instead of lard.

I've made these several times over the years since finding this recipe.They are A+  #1 in my book. I do substitute oil or butter for the lard depending on what I have on hand.  Depends on what your taste buds prefer. I like lard too but rest of family do not.

I made this with a few tweaks  and everything turned out great! I used a slow cooker for the beef, although I threw small amounts of cumin, a single ancho (torn apart), oregano, and garlic into the crock pot but followed the rest of the recipe exactly...adding  the very same ingredients again when required in their suggested amounts. Also, don't use a knife to spread the Masa!!!! Use Saran wrap and spread it with your hand, it won't stick to that.

Thanks for sharing this terrific tamale recipe.  Turned out perfect.  Only thing I changed was increasing the red pepper flakes, using some I dried from my garden and doubling cumin.
Only used one large pkg of corn husks.

This is my first foray into Mexican Cuisine. AND I didn't use the meat filling... so I cant speak to that... I just used my meat taco filling. I really just wanted to see if I could make the masa and corn husks work bc that is what most intimidated me. I used this recipe and the suggestions as my base and guide.
1st, soak the husks in WARM water. I didn't think of that at first and it took so much longer to make them pliable. 2nd, break out your food processor for the masa. I tried a hand-held mixer at first. Total waste of time and dishwasher space. 3rd, the masa is dry, even after the lard, so I used a combination of one small can of V8 tomato juice and beef broth until it was the consistency of frosting. I also used a ton of different spices that I like... S&P, cyanne, etc... whatever YOU like.

After that, I looked to the other posts for how to spread the masa. One could also you-tube it. 

The beautiful thing is that this is so adaptable. One can add any flavor to the masa and change the filling and make a thousand different combinations which all taste good.

I loved this recipe. It was almost as yummie as our traditional homemade tamales my aunts used to make back when I was a child. The texture was perfect and the flavor of the beef was tasty.  Have to say.. my first time making these solo.. this recipe was extremely helpful.

The masa needed a little more salt but I added two cans of EL Pato tomato sauce and it still gave it a pretty good flavor.  For a first time tamale maker these were delicious!

I cooked my meat in a pressure cooker, which only took 35-40 minutes.  I put the seasonings in with the meat and used the broth from the roast.  I also added 1 lb chorizo sausage to the mix.
  The tamales were ok, but somewhat dry on the inside and seemed like it needed some kind of sauce inside, just my opinion.  I wish I would have added some of the red sauce or mole some of the other reviewers talked about.
   I made half a batch, ate some and froze the rest.  Not sure if I will make these again, but if I do, I will definitely experiment with some kind of sauce for the inside so they aren't so dry.

These are excellent tamales.  I have made them a dozen times, at least!  Sometimes I use beef, and sometimes I use pork.  They are always a hit.  I follow the recipe to a T except for cooking the meat.  I use my crockpot because I can set it and forget it.  Wonderful recipe; make sure you have lots of time.

Love this recipe!  Thank you so much for posting.  I follow this exactly other than cooking the meat in my crock pot overnight.  My family gets together on Christmas morning, opens gifts and then the tamale making party begins.  We have tried other recipes in the past, but we will stick with this one, they turned out great.  I made a "chili gravy" to go over the tamales, and everyone loved them!

I certainly will not use this recipe ever again because the product was NOT worth all the effort. The filling is good on its own, but for some reason it was really dull and tasteless after it was wrapped and steamed. The finished product was really dry.

I cut the recipe in half and cooked the meat in the crock pot for a day first.
