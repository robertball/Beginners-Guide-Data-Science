This was really good!  I used cooked ham in place of bacon and forewent the saute with the peppers/onion.  I was not sure how this would work in the crock pot, but it worked!  the texture was a bit different that you'd get in the oven, but not bad, merely different.  While this isn't my *favorite* breakfast casserole, it is yummy enough that I'll make again because it's so easy to throw together the night before when we've got overnight guests. THANKS for the recipe!

I have made this twice now. The first time I followed the directions and the whole family hated it. I decided I would try one more time and use this as a base but tweak it a little to make it more edible. It was much better this time around.
I made the following changes:
1. I added salt and pepper to the potatoes.
2. I added cooked ham as well as the bacon.
3. I did not have cheddar cheese so I used mozzarella.
4. I used two cups of milk instead of one.
5. I added spices to the eggs, season all and cumin.

I let this cook for 10 hours overnight and it came out perfect.

Add extra cheese on top for every serving when serving.  Also, if use bacon double it! Cooking time was great.

This is easy to make.  Just do not over bake.  It's nice when you have guests and are playing hostess.

Excellent recipe! Smells heavenly and tastes great! My one and only change is that I left out the dill weed (personal preference only, I'm simply not a fan of that flavor in my eggs). I have made this twice - once with bacon and once with ham (the ham was our favorite! and as a bonus, I could saute it with the veggies). When I did use the bacon, it was the quick cooking kind that goes in the microwave - quick, easy and far less messy than bacon splattering all over your stove in a pan! :-) Next time I am going to add some mushrooms - yum!

I've never made a casserole successfully in a crock pot/slow cooker, so I was leery to try this one.  

I swapped bacon for ham, and parsley for dill, and didn't spend the time sauteeing the garlic, onion, and peppers.  (It was Christmas Eve!  Had to get to bed before Santa arrived!) 

After reading a lot of the comments and reviews, we reduced the milk to 1/2 a cup, and only let it cook for 5 hours on low.  (That was PLENTY!)  While setting an alarm was a bummer, if we make it for a brunch, starting it when we get up at 5 is perfect timing.

SUCCESS!  The kids ate it up, the husband said it was delish, and even I was happy with the taste and texture.  I may make it with less tater tots next time, and more cheese!  Definitely going to try the sausage or bacon version next time!

Thank you for sharing this!  A new Christmas Morning tradition is born!

This was a hot mess.  No flavor (how can this be with bacon?) Cooking time was WAY too long.  I made it for company everyone thought it was awful but tried to salt it and dress up. (the part that wasn't burned) I just gave everyone cereal bowls, spoons and apologized.

I did not care for this.... texture was spongy and not particularly pleasant. Smell wasn't exactly anything I'd want to smell either. Flavor was pretty bland and watery.

I made this recipe and followed the instructions to the letter. It was a major disappointment.  I stopped the cooking at 8 hours because I could smell it beginning to burn.  The texture of this dish was like insulation.. tasteless and rather unsightly. Honestly, I was embarrassed to serve it.

I've made this for the past several years for Christmas breakfast. It is great but it does taste best the next day as leftovers. The only change I have made over the years is use 2 packages of Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage instead of bacon. When I do this, I can use different flavors of bacon and skip the dill. The dill is a little off putting to some.

This recipe saved the day!  After my oven broke the morning I'm supposed to make a Quiche Lorraine for my office breakfast, I needed to quickly adjust my plan.  The crock pot was a perfect idea, except that I didn't have 8 hours for it to slowly cook.  So, I adjusted the recipe by fully cooking the hash browns on the stove and slightly warming the egg mixture on the stove (don't let the eggs cook). I then assembled the layers in the crock pot as instructed and turned it on high for 30 minutes, then turned it down to low for 60 minutes and it was perfectly ready.  I took it into the office, turned it on warm and it was a hit for the office potluck!

I made this for a breakfast buffet thinking I could make this first so that I would have time to make all of the other dishes. This was the main "meat" dish. It smelled good but came out VERY watery and all the onions floated to the top and tasted awful. I thought maybe I was supposed to cook with the lid off so it wouldn't be so watery but looking back at the recipe now, that's not what it says. I will always bake from now on, which is disappointing because I thought this would be great in the summer when I don't want to turn the oven on.

I made some changes to make it even less prep work. I used 1 bag potatoes O’brien which was a little under the recipes 2lbs that way i didn’t have to cut up peppers and onion, i used ham instead of bacon, and seasoned it with garlic powder and some spices, I used 2cups cheese because that’s how much is in 1 bag of shredded cheese. I also followed another reviewers advice and reduced the cook time to 6 hours, however I think 5 hours would have done the trick. I had to transport this across town and it was still hot when it was time to serve so that was nice. There was a lot of “juice/grease” I soaked up with a paper towel before serving it to anyone. This was a good dish and I will make it again, but I feel I made a lot of changes.

This was too spongey. I won't make eggs like this again. Also needs some more zing as far as taste.

Followed this as directed and it was just okay.  Not a big hit with the family.  Most of it ended up in the garbage.  My kids put ketchup on theirs.  Definitely needed more seasonings or something..it was very blah.  Also think 8 hours was too long in the crock.

Just okay - a little blah in the potato department - we prefer crunchy fried. I even added a lot of spices, and the texture was just like porridge. We'd rather have cold cereal.

Made this and loved the smell all day.  But the end result was dry and spongy.  We grabbed some salsa from the fridge and that helped.  Not sure if I'd make again without figuring out some way to counter the bland dry texture.

I think it was great. I did it both ways... once with bacon and once with cooked breakfast sausage. Both were great. I used shredded velveeta cheese and it melted beautifully inbetween the layers. I didn't do anything with the hashbrowns except thaw them.

This was really good! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only difference was that I added chopped scallions to the egg mixture before pouring it in. And I added some chopped cooked ham to the layers. This is a great base recipe, you can add different spices, you can add more chopped veggies (broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms). 8 hours on low was perfect. The cheese gets browned and crispy (love browned crispy cheese!). Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Very good!  I ended up making this the day i served it by putting crock pot on high.  Took about 4 hours and i served it for Christmas brunch. I used a whole pound of bacon and increased the milk a bit.  Finally,  i sprinkled more cheese on it when it was finished.

I modified this to make three slow cookers' worth for the office party so I deleted the meat and added sausage gravy mix. Here are the ingredients I use and quantity for each: 18 eggs, 1.5 Cups milk, 1 package of breakfast/sausage gravy mix, 6+ Cups finely shredded cheddar jack, 30 oz bag of frozen hash browns. I don't put any other seasoning in, I just let the gravy mix add the flavor. Turns out nicely and is always a big hit (and more affordable without the veggies and meat). 

Like others have mentioned, I also need much less cooking time, approximately four hours on Low.

I agree with the spongy comment. It seemed too bland as well. Next time will try an oven baked breakfast casserole.

This is the third yearI I have made this casserole for volunteers at an annual fair.  I have yet to bring any home and it is now assumed it will be there.  This year I used Obrien potatoes and the texture was much improved (personal preference).  I also add pepperoni slices and have hot sauce on the side to perk it up.

I have a question for anyone and everyone.  Whenever I make this, or any other breakfast casserole recipe in the slow cooker, there's one problem that makes it a turn off for the family.  It comes out with a weird layer of what almost seems like melted Saran Wrap over the top.  I can peel it off, but that tears up the top and takes away the presentation side of things.  Is this a common problem, and how do you avoid it?

As for reviewing it, I like it, except for the above mentioned problem, but 8 hours makes it hard and icky.  I've been going with six.  It's also just a little bit bland, so I up the salt and pepper a bit.

I made it and would make it again for a large group.  It is just my husband and I so we ate it for breakfast for nearly a week.  That said, it keeps well.  I think I would try different cheeses or a combination.  It was very tasty!

Agree to add more bacon and careful with the red pepper.  The red pepper seemed to overwhelm the flavor.  Timing is great.  Nice to wake up to fresh made breakfast.  I served this with a fresh fruit salad and asparagus.

This recipe was very easy and good for the quick breakfast meal. I think the time is a little too long. My seemed dried out. I didn't like it, but my family did! I guess I could have added some salsa to flavor it up.

Very disappointing! Smelled great all night long, but when we tasted it, it had no flavor and was very dry.

Good flavor, but not great. Mediocre texture and appearance. It is nice to have it cook overnight.
