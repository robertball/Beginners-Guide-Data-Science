I made this tonight and everyone loved it.  I have to admit I didn't use exact measurements, I just sort of used the recipe as a guide.  Once way or the other the pork itself produced so much juice that I was sorry I made the sauce.  Next time, in stead of adding the berries to more wine, I think I will just boil them in the pork's juice.  In the meanwhile, I am going to freeze several pork chops in the juice and sauce I have left over.  It was a big hit- a great "different" way to use up all of those summer blackberries.

This is a great, simple recipe.  I do hate reviewing recipes when I didn't follow it exactly, but I learned in the middle of preparing of this one that my blackberry jam didn't look fresh anymore, so I tossed it.  That said, I substituted a jar of prune-plum jam, and didn't use my fresh blackberries for extra sauce since the jam mixture made quite a bit in the slow cooker.   Slow cooker bags made clean up incredibly easy (can't imagine trying to scrub cooked jam off of the stoneware!).  Thanks for the recipe - I will definitely make this again.

This was most excellent!!  I used a 10 oz jar of Marion Berry Jam as I did not have any blackberry and after slicing the pork I put the leftover juice on the stove and heated it up with a little corn starch and water and poured it over the pork.....Yummmmmyyyyyyy

Fabulous, even with my modifications.  I got home late and had to cook it on High.  Used the probe, cooked to 165*F and it took about 2.5 hours.  I am a HUGE fan of wine reductions but wasn't sure if my kids would like it full-on, so I poured the cooking liquid in a saucepan and added about 1/4c red wineong with the blackberries, midway through.  Reduced on med-high.  Added some additional rosemary, black pepper, and ~2T of butter.  Yummy!  I think that I would have preferred the wine reduction more but my 7yo and 3yo seemed to enjoy this lighter version.  Next time I will try the full-on wine reduction sauce in addition to searing the meat first.  Thank you for the great recipe.

This was amazing! I don't care for fresh blackberries normally but this was delicious and had the perfect balance between sweet and savory! i seared the tenderloin first in a pan and used that pan with the drippings to make the sauce which I think added more flavor. I did end up adding a little roux to the sauce to thicken it up. Absolute 10!

An excellent slow cooker meal. I found the cooking time too long, but may be it is just my slow cooker. I put my tenderloin in still frozen and after 6 hours on low it was a little overcooked for my taste. 
I made some modifications (sorry) based on what I had on hand and personal preference: reduced the jam  to about 1/2 cup, and honey to 2 tbsp, but left the wine at 2 tbsp and reduced the ground sage to about 1/8 tsp and the rosemary to about 1/2 tsp (personal preference) and added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder. 
Because there was so much liquid in the crock pot, I didn't bother with the sauce. I blended a couple of tablespoons of flour into about 1/4 cup of water in a small pot, then added the liquid from the crock pot, and brought it to a boil until it thickened. 
My kids really liked this meal and I will definitely make it again. Thanks for a great recipe!

I substituted red raspberry jam instead of blackberry and used the jam for the sauce instead of the whole fruit.  Was very flavorful.  Dried out slightly but it was my fault because I cooked it too long.  Will make again.

This recipe was rated wonderful from my entire family of picky eaters - never happened before! I've made it exactly as the recipe states and once with whiskey as I was out of the wines needed. was great both ways. I also used the sauce from the crock pot as well as the sauce you make. the crock pot sauce is much spicier than the pan sauce, making every one happy.

The anticipation of this was better than it turned out my husband and I agreed; the 3 year old didn't take to it at all.  The meat didn't pick up the flavor as much as I thought it would have. All around a good meal but hardly not worth the long cook time and expensive ingredients. An entire jar of Jam for one meal - I just thought the meat would have tasted a little more fruity instead of having to rely on the sauces so much for flavor.

Magnificent recipe, really brought out the sweetness of the pork without being the least bit cloying.  The fresh blackberries gave a lovely tart contrast as well.  

I made this mostly as written, but in a covered roasting pan in the oven, with a little extra red wine and a bit of water to give a little more liquid, and about 2 tablespoons of good quality wholegrain mustard mixed through the jam.  

I'd say this would work beautifully for venison as well!

I made this for me and my hubby tonight as a trial run cause our 8 yr old daughter wasn't home. We both liked it alot. Considering neither one of us is a wine drinker, the taste was different. I had read the reviews and a couple people suggested using the juices from the crock pot instead of more wine, and that was what I did. I added a little more honey to it for taste, but to me it did not thicken up enough. Next time I will add a little cornstarch to it, just to have a thicker sauce. All in all I made the roast exactly as about and it turned out great. We will definitely be making this again!

I am 50/50 on this recipe. I liked it, thought it was a nice flavor, yet at the same time I would never make it again since I didn't love it enough. I did like the ease of it.

This was so good!  I wasn't able to slice it though, it was so tender it just fell apart.  I may have cooked it too long though, I had it on for five and a half hours while I was at work.  I also used fresh sage, which worked fine.  This was possibly one of the best recipes I've ever made!  I'm going to try the same thing with pork chops in the  slow cooker.

What I did differently was use a tart cherry preserves instead of blackberry (husband's preference); instead of rosemary I used a rosemary/garlic blend together with the rubbed sage because that's what I had on hand.  It came out great but the cooking time is definitely too long.  I made the wine reduction, doubled, and added dried bing cherries since I used the cherry preserves; added it to the juices in from the pork, thickened it up, added 1-2 TBL butter and it was fabulous.  My husband and my son loved it as did I.  Will make it again maybe with a loin and cook for a lesser amount of time.

I made this like the recipe says but I cut up a half of onion and two cloves of garlic and pan fried the pork (I used pork chops) till they were brown then put the pork in the crockpot. Then for the sauce I didn't use fresh blackberries - I used the other two ounces of blackberry jam (I had an 18 ounce jar and used 16 ounces in the crockpot) but had to thicken up up a bit with a touch of flour water. I also strained the liquid from the crockpot and added some of that to the sauce. It was great!!

My family really loved this. I didn't add nearly as much jam as was called for (maybe half a jar) and I had to sub black raspberry as that was all I had on hand but I can't wait to try it with the blackberry. I would say that next time I'm going to try it with a pork loin as opposed to the tenderloin and I think it would be better to cut it when it's almost done and then baste a lot with the juices. The inside was kind of dry. I made the reduction using all the juice in the slow cooker and just added a bit more wine and honey. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for Christmas dinner for DH and the kids.  Everyone loved it.  I think I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, wine reduction and all.  I did sear the tenderloin in a pan before putting it in the cooker.  I served the sauce and berries on the meat and used the juice from the slow cooker as a gravy.  No one seemed to mind. :D  DH commented that it was the best pork I have ever made.

This was so good! Didn't have time to get it into the crock pot so I put the pork in the oven for 1 hour at 350 degrees. it came out perfect.  Didn't change anything else. Will definitely be making this again.

Great taste and easy to prepare. The pork fell apart, so it didn't look like the pictures & sauce never made a gravy, but was really good and the blackberries made it look and taste so fresh. Next time, I will set the crock pot for less time. Easy to prepare and I will try it again.

Great recipe!  Added a few extra blackberries. The sauce is truly the finishing touch. Meat is melt in your mouth tender.

I made this tonight for our anniversary. I made it just as the recipe said.  It turned out wonderful.  The sauce enhanced the meat flavor perfectly.  I will add this to my recipe box for future use.

Holy cow! this was good.  The contrast of the fresh berries sourness and the honey's sweetness made a nice sauce.  I watched the cooking time to make sure the pork didn't dry out.  I'll make this again for sure.

This worked great with sherry instead of wine and thyme instead of sage.  (I had to substitute because of shortages in the house.)

Yum! This was an easy and really impressive meal! My husband ate so much and requested to have it again when he returns from his business trip! I would recommend to use the juice from the meat--it is already there for you and tastes so good! Next time, I will use it to make a gravy and just make a little of the red wine reduction sauce with fresh berries. The berries definitely added to the flavor, so I won't skip them!

I was a little worried that this would be too much of a “grown up” flavor for my kids, with the wine and blackberries. However, this was delicious! My family devoured this. I didn’t make any changes and it was perfect. This is a recipe I’ll be hanging onto for the future. It was a nice change from the traditional baked pork tenderloin and was super easy to make.

The pork tasted great, but cook time was a bit too long. It was ~200 degrees when taken out. I made the sauce as written in the directions, but I also boiled and thickened the sauce from the crock pot, and the consensus was that one was better, so I'll save time the next round. Made it with mashed potatoes and the gravy was great on those as well. Thanks for the recipe!

So yummy and SO easy.  I've made it three times now.  A couple of changes -- I used a Costco seasoned pork roast (eliminates the rubbing!) and I substituted raspberry-chipotle sauce and fresh raspberries for the jam and backberries.  It's what I had on hand.  Also, only cooked on low for 4 hours.  Enjoy!

It was really easy to prepare.  I used a little too much sage as it overpowered the rest of the spices but that was my fault.  I eyeballed the sage a bit and think I used to much.  I didn't have fresh blackberries so I used some of the jam to make the sauce.  I cut back the amount of honey since I thought it would be a little too sweet.

I made this to exact the only difference I was in a rush and cooked this on the stove. We wanted something different and was short on time and came across this recipe. I had every ingredient that was listed but no slow cooker, thats why I had to go with the stove top, and it came out delicious my wife loved it so much she can't wait for me to cook it again. Next time I cook it, it will be in my slow cooker I ordered.

I was so excited to make this. I had pork with blackberry sauce at a restaurant and it was amazing! I was hoping this would be similar. I don't know what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did differently was I seared the tenderloin first. The tenderloin didn't seem to absorb any of the flavor of the cooking juices.  The sauce made it better but even that was just ok. It was a very easy recipe but still I would not make it again. My kids would not eat it and my husband and I have not even been compelled to finish the leftovers.

This was incredible. The only difference I had was my blackberries went bad before i could use them so I went without. oops. Served it with some lemon and herb roasted potatoes and was eating it for days. Can't wait to try it with other jams once autumn rolls around and all the orchards open!

I made this but didn't have blackberry jam so used blueberry.  I only used half the amount of jam. I also used fresh rosemary and thyme since I had it in the garden. It was fabulous, loved it!

This is by far the best thing that can be done with pork.  I knew I would not have much time today, so I put everything except the blackberries into the slow cooker together in anticipation of not making a sauce at the end.  Ultimately, I didn't have time at the 4-5 hour mark and ended up pulling it off the bone like pulled pork after 7 hours.  I then drained the liquid, skimmed the fat, and reduced it into a gravy and added the berries last.  It was extremely flavorful and a hit for everyone.  I don't care for pork or merlot, but the flavors in this were perfect on both counts, plus fresh herbs instead of dried (because I had them available in the garden).  Thanks for a great recipe.

I had a diabetic guest an decided to adapt the recipe for her. I used sugar free jam and replaced the honey with Equal and water. For the final sauce, again I used artficial sweetener with the wine and the blackberry. The results: A five stars fish!

Absolutely needs to come out of the crockpot at the 4hour mark. Sauce could use some assistance by a teaspoon of corn starch to thinken it up some. Overall ; this recipe has been added to my "whata crock" board on Pinterst.

Cooked with more Cabrenet and did it in the oven at 325 degrees for 1 hour 45 minutes. Then basted with more jam and honey; raise the temp to 425 degrees for 15 minutes to glaze the top. Did not have time to make the sauce so garnished with the fresh blackberries. So delicious! This dish got a five star rating from everyone at our birthday/ Mardi Gras bash.

I loved the results. I had a five pound Pork Loin Roast so I used that and followed the recipe as stated above. Came out great!! One thing I might change next time is this: forget the sauce afterwards and instead, put the ingredients for the sauce into the slow cooker from the start.

Read this recipe and wanted to try it! Changed the blackberry jam to use a jar of cherry compote that I had on hand, omitted the wine (young grandson) to apple juice. It was wonderful! Will make again for company.

if you can find it, there are seedless blackberry preserves made with splenda, and you can reduce the calories a little.
this is an incredibly kid-friendly recipe, in my experience.  make couscous to soak up the gravy and watch the kids eat til there are no 
leftovers.

This recipe was a big hit.  My boyfriend made for us.  He loved how easy it was, but it came out tasting like a lot of effort went into it.  The sauce really tops off some tender and delicious pork.  We'll make it again, no modifications necessary to this recipe as written.

I was feeling lazy so I put some extra wine in the slow cooker and skipped making the sauce. It was still amazing!
