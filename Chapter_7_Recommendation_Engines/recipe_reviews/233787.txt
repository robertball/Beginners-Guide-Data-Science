Can't say that we were crazy about this.   We thought the smoked turkey sausage tasted more like a frankfurter than what we consider smoked sausage, and that was the biggest disappointment.  We eat Hillshire Farm Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage which I think comes closer to what I consider traditional smoked sausage (that I just don't eat anymore).  Don't really mean to bash Butterball, but I just compared the nutritional info for these two brands, and they're very, very close.  This all could be taste preference, but I just didn't care for this sausage, and it's unlikely I'll make this again.

We really liked this recipe and it's easy to make.   I did use sweet onions in place of the green onions and I added in green peppers to the onion saute.   I also used fresh tomatoes in place of the sun-dried.   I will probably cut back on the cheeses next time, as I think it is just a little too much.

2 thumbs up! I made one change and used turkey kielbasa as my grocery store didn't carry the sausage the recipe called for. We loved the Mediterranean twist on this. I made it in my cast iron skillet and the times listed in the recipe were perfect. This is the best frittata we've ever tried.

I chopped up the sausage and it seemed like a ton of sausage for this so I only used half and it was the perfect amount for me. I also couldn't find the sun dried tomatoes in my grocery store so I just seeded and chopped up some fresh and squeezed them dry between paper towels. I've been told that the sun dried tomatoes really make this dish. Now here comes the tricky party. I mixed everything together and tossed it in the oven. Then I realized I was supposed to cook a little before doing that. *Sigh* Oh well. Turned out good if you don't mind waiting 1/2 hour - 45 minutes to eat breakfast. Even though this tasted good I really wasn't a fan of the texture and sodium content (as well as a few other ingredients) of the sausage. If I make this again I would leave out the sausage.

Loved this. I used a chicken sun dried tomato sausage, left out the oil, added red peppers and used egg whites

I really wanted to like this frittata, but it was just ok for us. I wasn't blown away by the flavor of the smoked turkey sausage and probably won't buy it again. I was a little concerned about the fact that the recipe doesn't call for any salt in the eggs. For those of you who might have this same concern, the cheese and sausage are plenty salty and no extra salt is needed.

I thought this tasted good and I don't typically make frittatas. It seemed to hold together really well, with a little extra cook time. So, I just cooked it the whole time, in the pan, flipping it once using a plate. I made a few changes for preference. When I was chopping the meat and green onion, both seemed like a lot. So, I cut them in half. I am not a fan of fresh basil, so I just subbed two good sized pinches of dry basil. It was going to be cooked anyhow. After I got all of my ingredients out and started the recipe, I realized I forgot the mozzarella cheese! No problem, it still worked out just fine. It did have the parmesan cheese in it. I guess, the only downside is it seemed kind of salty. Not sure if it was from the parmesan cheese, sausage, or both combined together. It would make a fine recipe, though, to recommend to someone looking for brunch recipes. I found it to be very filling.

I made this for supper tonight and served it with croissants and orange juice. It took a little longer to cook than the instructions said, but it tasted wonderful. The whole family liked it and my husband took the last piece for to work for lunch. So I'd say it's definitely a keeper. I think it would be a great recipe to to take to a breakfast or brunch potluck.

This frittata is very similar to the quiche that I make.  Light and fluffy, it's great with fresh fruit, carrot salad, or on its own.  The Butterball Smoked Turkey Dinner Sausage is the perfect compliment to the eggs, cheese, and veggies.  My family loved it!

Since we were all going to be eating dinner at different times, I elected to make this into a baked frittata.  I started the sausage and green onions as directed and when ready I stirred them into the egg, cheese, tomato, basil mixture poured each serving into individual casseroles and baked them at 400F for about 12-15 minutes.  We all agreed this was a great combination of flavors.

This was a wonderful and easy breakfast dish.  We enjoyed it so much and had plenty leftover for breakfast the next day.

This was better than I'd anticipated!  I did make some tweaks, though:  I halved the recipe and baked at 400 for 30 min in a glass pie pan, as we don't have an oven safe skillet.  I also used fresh tomatoes in place of sun dried and added a diced jalap and some leftover corn that needed used.  Fresh basil wasn't available at our grocery store, so I was forced to sub dried.  I have to agree with the reviewers who said the "sausage" tasted like hot dogs, though (which kind of worked for me since I'm not a big sausage fan).

We really enjoyed this, but we love frittatas!  I sauteed the sausage until it was on the verge of crispy, and left everything else the same.  Be sure you have some orange juice on hand--this is perfect for any meal.

Everyone loved it!  The only suggestion was to up the sun dried tomato just a little, but it's really great as is!

For some reason our crew doesn't care for the pan-baked fritatta, so my son made this in an 11x14 glass casserole dish (doubled).  It was fast, easy, and will be made again!

Quick, easy, delicious dinner. It is just 2 of us, so I halved the recipe & cooked it in an 8" pan. Served with a slice of homemade potato wheat bread. Definitely a dinner for those busy nights.

This frittata was delicious!  I didn't have any green onions, so I subbed some diced yellow onion.  I used eggbeaters in place of the whole eggs. I will be making this again!  Fast, easy, healthy and delicious!
