The only complaint I have is that "a bunch of cilantro" is hard to gauge and it's such a pronounced flavor you need to use your own judgement. I quartered the recipe and it made plenty, probably 3-4 cups. I looked around for references because when I got done chopping the leaves I had about 2-3 times what I thought would be reasonable. I used 1/2 cup chopped leaves and any more would have been too much for us in this scaled down version. I also had a large jalapeno(3.5" long and not skinny). The two offset nicely and it wasn't too hot at all. Maybe the jalapeno was on the milder side. I did not have red onion and so I used all yellow. Scaling Note: 1/4 recipe-one reg size tomato, 1/2 c chopped cilantro leaves (not packed), large pepper, 1/2 a yellow onion-no purple.

8 24 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/236590/cabbage-pico-de-gallo/ ... This was good, &, surprisingly, not too far from regular pico-tasting.  Department of the obvious, but it's just less tomatoey, less soft because of cabbage (duh) so I can easier eat it with a fork. :)  I halved the recipe.  I gotta tell ya, unless you're feeding the neighborhood, half is plenty.  It fit in a 3L bowl  For the cilantro, I chopped 1c leaves.  It "cooks down" a bit as it sits, but the cabbage didn't get wilty or slimey - just as good as it was day one.  'Very glad I tried! ... 'Been having this in flour tortillas for a week & it's still freshtasting!  'Sometimes with cheese, sour cream, avocado, etc. Filling, but light.  Nice! ... Another one; haven't tried it ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/240458/pico-de-gallo-with-cabbage-mexican-coleslaw/

This was outstanding, even scaling it down to serve just the two of us.  Used Napa cabbage instead of green; just judged the amount nof everything by taste.  But the flavors as combined worked well together.  Thanks, Josh, for a good alternative to regular tomato salsa.

So this is a common dish in my household we like it with choped up cold cooked shrimp. Sometimes my mom would use pickled pig skin chopped up instead of shrimp or even octopus ,i like shrimp the best. This on a crunchy tostada shell with a bottle of good taqilla and some lime is a great way to entertain

I love this!  I made a half batch and cheated by using a cup or so of cole slaw mix you get in the bag instead of chopping cabbage.  I also followed the suggestion of using a half cup of cilantro as a previous reviewer. I used a couple medium sized tomatoes as that's what I had .  This is exactly the recipe  I've been looking for. 
 Thanks!

I will definitely make this again!  I did not have any tomatoes on hand, so those were omitted.  And I used garlic powder because my fresh garlic had gone bad.  BUT, this was AMAZING!  No one in my house eats cabbage so I am still eating this 3 days later and it just gets better every day.  The flavor is wonderful, the cabbage is not limp, and the jalapeno is smoother.  I chopped everything in my Ninja (a little at a time) so it was a breeze to make and clean up.  As the days have passed the jalapeno is not as pronounced so in the future I will most likely add more jalapeno so the heat remains longer.  Definitely a keeper - and I can just imagine that fresh tomatoes will just make this even tastier.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my family. I used a sweet vidalia onion for the yellow onion and really liked the little bit of sweetness that added.

This is really good. Adjust cilantro and jalapeno to taste. The ingredient ratio seems about perfect.

I used the recipe as a base and it is very easy to customize to your family's taste.  I started with one 16 oz bag of tri colored shredded cole slaw mix and used the directions for 1/4 recipe. That wasn't enough tomato, cilantro and lime, so I added more of both. Just to taste. We ate plain, with chips, and with black bean cigars from this site.  We will definitely have again.

I doubled the amount  of garlic because I like garlic and I added an extra tomato because I thought it could use a little more color.  This makes a lot so, have about 5 quart jars on hand.  Great recipe.

I used both the white and red cabbage to give it more colour. I opted not to use the garlic. Nonetheless, it is among the easiest of recipes and oh so mouth watering!
