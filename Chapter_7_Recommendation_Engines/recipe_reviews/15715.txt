Very good and tasty. Instead of forming them into individual loaves as suggested in the recipe, I used a muffin pan that I sprayed with PAM. The cooking time was the same and it was easier, too.

I wanted to try this recipe for several reasons - it has a ketchup/brown sugar topping like the recipe that my husband prefers and it was highly rated.  I would never have thought of putting OATMEAL and CHEESE in meatloaf!  It was SO good.  The thing that absolutely made this recipe the best was the texture - and I guess that is attributed to the oatmeal and cheese!  The only thing I did differently was put a dash of garlic powder in and use my Pampered Chef Mini-Loaf pan to do four loaves.

One suggestion for those who are finding it to be too "wet".  Let the oatmeal/egg/milk mixture sit for a few minutes so the oatmeal can absorb some of the liquid before you combine with the meat.

YUM!  This is going to be my permanent meatloaf recipe!

I wanted to try a new Meatloaf recipe other then my Mom's.  I saw this recipe, and it was close to hers, but a little different (quick oats, sauce, no onion).  So, I made it exactly as the recipe called for, BUT added one large chopped onion (meatloaf isn't meatloaf without onion).  

I found a NEW recipe.  This meatloaf recipe is BETTER then Moms.  My kids were licking their plates.  I can't get the taste out of my mouth.  It was fantastic.  I already sent the recipe to my sister in law, to feed to her finicky kids.  I think they'll even like it.  I don't think anyone who tries this would be disappointed.

My husband wanted meatloaf for dinner so I got online to see what I could find....THIS WAS AWESOME!!  I used a muffin pan like others had suggested.  I like the individual serving sizes except my husband ate 9 outta 12 meatloaf muffins!!!  So much for lunch tomorrow....
I stuck pretty close to original recipe but added Ms Dash's 1/2 tsp onion medley and cut back to 1/2 tsp salt.  Also was just under 1/2 cup of oats so I added some italian bread crumbs too.  Put about 1/4 cup chopped onions and had to add Worcester sauce cuz I love it!
This really was easy to make and has me looking forward to the next time we can eat meatloaf!  Thanks Tonya!!!

Very tasty.  I added some chopped sauted onions for extra flavor and used fresh bread crumbs because I didn't have oats.  I left the milk also. I did make 8 loavess, but I used 1 1/2 pounds of meat.  I don't know that 1 pound would have been enough meat for 8 loaves otherwise.  I felt they were the perfect size and ate one.  My brother was here for dinner and ate 4 though, but he is a big guy and had just come from work.

This was really REALLY good!!  After reading alot of the reviews, this is how I changed it a bit.  

I did use the muffin tin sprayed with cooking spray which yielded 10 mini meatloaves after a perfect 45 minutes in the oven.

I let the oats, milk and cheese sit for a few minutes to soften the oats a bit.  

I also added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion powder to the milk/oats/cheese mix.

For the topping I used dijon mustard - that countered the sweetness just right and made the perfect topping!

This recipe is top notch!!  My husband - the avowed meatloaf hater - ate SIX of them (and yes he was moaning on the couch afterward).  That's a winner in my book!

Very clever recipe that was appealing to everyone!  The kids liked having their own personal meatloaf and my dh even preferred it over the one giant lump of meatloaf.  It looked so much prettier to serve on a plate too!  I have to admit, I didn't have oats so I used regular saltine crackers and I didn't want the mustard in it so I left that out, but it was a fantastic recipe.  I used a measuring scoop as a mold.  A keeper!

I have tried several highly rated meatloaf recipes on this site, but this is my new favorite. It produces a tender and tasty meatloaf.

I made the following modifications. I tripled the recipe and substituted 1 lb  of ground lamb for 1 lb of ground beef. I made one batch of mini's in a muffin tin and instead of adding the cheese into the meat I formed the ball of meatloaf around a chunk of cojack cheese. Yummy, yummy! The other two loaves I mixed the cheddar cheese into and baked them regular size. 

Finally, I did not add the mustard to the topping; I don't like mustard. So I added a bit of onion powder and cut back on the sugar a bit.

Anyway, awesome recipe!

I made this one last night and I now have a favorite meatloaf recipe! My husband loved it ~ there were no leftovers. I have a new baby and this was easy to make up while he was napping and shove in the fridge for a few hurs, and pop in the oven when ready to cook. I ended up with 6 mini loaves, and I just added a pinch of regular sugar to the sauce (no brown sugar) and it was perfect, not too sweet at all. I added some garlic salt to the mix as well. I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of oats. I will definitely make this one again.

Ideal for kids and freezes well!  I make these for my sons’ lunch all the time.  I use the ingredients as per the recipe BUT put the individual potions in a muffin pan greased with PAM.  I have a simple food scale and make 3 oz patties.  I add the sauce equally over all the portions.  Obviously, I make these when the little ones can have it as a meal.  But this recipe is so easy to make in a big batch, that I can make more and freeze them in individual containers (two per container in this case) that can be sent to school with him for a reheat.
UPDATE: My boys were getting tired of big meat patties.  I now actually just scoop one tablespoon of the mixture, roll it into a meatball and then when all the meatballs are formed in a oven safe dish, I just dress them with the sauce.  Bake for only 30 minutes and watch them gobble them up.  Also served as appetizers and people who did not like meatloaf gave me compliments!

We loved this.  Like others, I mixed the milk, egg, salt, and oatmeal and let it sit while I prepared the rest.  I added half a small chopped sweet onion and a little pepper.  I divided the mixture evenly into my 12-muffin-tin and shook a little garlic powder over the top.  Then I spooned about 2 teaspoons of the catsup sauce over the top of each "muffin."  I put them in the oven, and after about half an hour, I took the then-meatballs from the muffin tins, tossing out the grease, and put them upside down on a foil-lined pan.  I covered them with the rest of the catsup mixture and returned them to the oven for the remaining cooking time (about 20 minutes more).  These were so great!  I'll make up some more tomorrow and freeze them for a lazy-day dinner later on this month!  Great recipe!  Thanks!

These were good.  I used a jarred pasta sauce instead of the ketchup, but other than that I didn't make any changes.  Will make again.  Thanks for the post.

This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe.  I've always been a meatloaf fan, but DH could take it or leave it.  Out of all of the meatloaf recipes I have used, he eats more of this one though.  I had never put oats or cheese in meatloaf before, but I love the texture of this meatloaf.  I just make it into one loaf and slice it up.  I do add dried minced onion, garlic powder and fresh ground pepper.  Best part about it.....meatloaf sandwich for lunch tomorrow!  I will make this recipe over and over.

I did these a little differently. Used 1/2 cup each evap. cond. milk and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, half the cheese, ketchup, salt and brown sugar, and added garlic powder, dry mustard and worcestershire all to the meat mixture. Put in prepared muffin cups and baked for 30 min. and then topped with flakey refrigerator biscuits (split in half). Continued baking for about 6 min. longer, till biscuits were done. Delicious, and thanks!

These were excellent.  I made them for work lunches so the mini-style suited tupperware well.  The sauce on top of the meatloaf is great, and I added a few extra oats for healthy fiber.  I also accidentally used old-fashioned oats, not quicking cooking ones, and it didn't make a bit of difference.  They were still delicious.

Wow - what an amazing recipe!! Me and my husband loved this dish! (We used antelope burger - so it is game friendly too!) The sauce as perfect for me, but hubby thought there was a little too mutch ketchup flavor. Will only add 1/3 cup ketchup next time... Maybe even less of sauce all together - was way too much. I found it easier to make 6 mini-loafs than 8. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - it is going in our dinner rotation!

Well I have finally found my ultimate meatloaf recipe to settle down with!  I have tried many, but this my final answer!  Oatmeal meatloaves are just the best.  I added onion to this of course and I added some Woreshire (sp) sauce to it and some garlic powder to it.  I cut down on the brown sugar in the topping for hubby's sake, but if it was just me I would have kept it all it.  I did have to add more oaks because the mixture was too soupy, probably up to a cup or so since....I doubled the recipe as I always do for meatloaf so that I get twice the result w/ one time the mess and freeze half of it.  I have a really big pan that is bigger than a 13 x 9 and I made 4 long loafs out of it. I did up the baking time to 1 hour.  This was great and easy and like I said it is here to stay!  Thanks!

My hubby raved about these little loaves.  I used ground turkey and they were really delicious.  He loved the glaze on the top.  A great twist to an old standby.

This was absolutely delicious and super moist. I made the following changes:  Sauteed 1/2 white onion, jalapeño pepper, and two cloves of garlic.  I added worschestire sauce to the mix, along with garlic powder, and pepper. It was sooooo good!

the recipe is good but as an under 300 calorie dish it falls short.  A serving of meat is 4oz not 2oz.  This recipe is great but it only serves 4 not 8

Excellent recipe. I hate meat loaf, but the reviews of others on  this meatloaf recipe were so great I had to try it. Well after trying this recipe I have to say I have changed my mind about meatloaf. 
Wonderful taste, moist, sweet and tangy.
This recipe is a keeper. Thank you

I was a little hesitant because of the oats and cheese but desperate for lower cal dinners. This was actually very good. I have made it a few times now and even my picky little eaters like it.

This is a staple in our house!  2 per person is just right for a meal.  They freeze well for make-ahead cooking too!

The meatloaves by themselves had very little flavor. The topping by itself is pretty sweet & ketchup-y. Together they make a tasty little meatloaf tho.  The texture is so perfect!! I would def add some onions next time!

Great recipe! I enjoyed it and so did my husband, even though he's not the biggest fan of ketchup. The only thing I'll do different next time is add some spices to the meat (maybe some pepper and onion) and then cut down on the brown sugar a bit. It was a little too sweet!

I made these in muffin tins and added onion and bell peppers.  Just the right size for a quick lunch.

One of my favorite and most-used recipes! As is, it's really good and I give it 4 stars, but I normally make a few changes to send it over the edge to 5. First up, I add a small onion, diced finely. Then I add 4 or 5 strips of cooked and crumbled bacon. With these two additions, this recipe is out of this world.

For us, we needed 1/2 cup chopped onion which improved the flavor. These are good with no topping, but with  gravy drizzled over the top. The cheese gives a firmer texture. I form these into small patties or loaves and bake in a greased foil lined 9x 13 pan for easy clean up. Thanks for sharing.

I'm not a big meatloaf person (too much of it as a kid) but this is pretty good. The best part - Hubby said it is better than his Mom's...this says a lot!

Instead of making mini loaves I just make it as one loave and it turns out just fine.

This recipe has became a favorite for us!   This is almost exactly like a recipe from the cookbook Taste of Home but this one leaves out the onion and has a little less brown sugar.  I reccommend adding 1/2 c. chopped onion to the meat and 1/2 c. brown sugar to the sauce.  This is not your ordinary meatloaf.  A lot of meatloafs are dry and plain.  These come out sooooo MOIST and flavorful!  The sauce is so sweet and is the best part!  I have made this recipe many of times!  I always seem to use brown sugar oatmeal because thats all I have instead of cooking oats.  And then I add just a little bit of seasoned bread crumbs to it also.  When you combine the beef mixture it looks a little runny from the milk...but thats the whole point of it coming out so moist.  So dont try putting more oats or anything in it because it could soak up everything and make it dry.  I normally make about 5-6 small loaves out of this recipe.  The best thing is everyone gets their own lil loaf!  It has always been on the top of our list!

Delicious recipe! It has great flavor even without the ketchup topping. I used 3/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp garlic salt.  I also used another reviewers suggestion and let the oats soak in the milk for about 10 minutes before adding the meat which made the oats barely noticeable after the meat was cooked. Will make again for sure.

I made this in jumbo muffin cups, so I got 6 loaves. I baked them for 35 minutes, then turned them out onto a foil-lined cookie sheet, and coated the undersides with the leftover glaze, then baked them another 10 minutes.

This has been my "go to" meatloaf recipe since my children were small - 40 yers ago.  I do add onion and some ground black pepper.  Regarding the person who thought it had a "wet" texture, I've found that it's best to let it sit at least 5-10 minutes after coming out of the oven before serving or slicing. These mini loaves (without topping) freeze really well. Wrap each individual loaf in wax or freezer paper, place on a cookie sheet and into the freezer.  When frozen, transfer to a freezer container or large freezer bag. Thaw, add the topping and pop in the oven.

I doubled the recipe and it turned out to be too much milk. I felt the cheese was too much also. My family and I just did not like the flavor of the meat or the sauce.

I've always considered meatloaf as the utimate "comfort " food.  I have an addition to any meatloaf recipe that might sound weird but you won't believe how much more moisture it adds. Tapioca..yes tapioca! Add about 1 TBSP. to a small loaf then more according to size.

I have never made meatloaf that was edible until this recipe!  I use tomato sauce instead of the glaze (that's how my mama always made meatloaf), and add finely chopped onion and garlic and a pinch of cumin.  I always make extra and freeze the little loafs.  I also have to cook these a bit longer than the recipe says.

This was terrible.  We ended up having to throw most of it out.  The meat had NO flavor, and the sauce on top was really bad.  I wanted to try something different, but I will stick to my tried and true meatloaf.  If I could give it a 0*, I would.

Pretty good, but, I changed it so much I am not sure I should be reviewing. I doubled the meat amount, used a sleeve of crushed saltine crackers instead of the oats, cut the amount of cheese in half (used what was stated for the original recipe), used 2 tsp of worcestershire sauce, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, a couple of shakes of italian seasoning, 2 tsp garlic powder, 2 eggs, doubled the milk, 1 cup of chopped onions. For the sauce I doubled the ketchup and mustard and left the brown sugar amount the same. It was perfect - not too sweet! I made 4 fairly large loaves (we put chopped green peppers in one of them), placed them on their own pieces of foil and placed that on my roaster rack and lined the pan below with foil for easy clean-up. All the grease fell down below. This needed 1 hour 20 minutes. This was good, and I am not a meatloaf kind of person.

This is an almost exact replica of the recipe I grew up with. I love the oatmeal added to this meatloaf, it makes the texture unbelievable. I also like to add a dry packet of Lipton's Onion Soup mix for a spectacular flavor addition. The Ketchup topping is sooo good and hard to replace. I've tried doing that with a tomato paste/brown sugar/mustard mix, but nothing beats the flavor that the ketchup brings. Some things just cant be beat ;) I'm a southern girl with the taste of good ol' comfort food. This does the trick!

Very tasty, and very easy. I made it in muffin tins and it cooked for the same amount of time, just perfectly. Yummy sauce, and we had a bunch of extra to serve on the side. I'll throw it into my rotation. There are so many good meatloaf recipes out there though so I won't be using this exclusively. Good one though!

THIS WILL LOOK TOO MOIST WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE PAN!!!  I was really worried when I put mine in the pan because it was so moist I couldn't shape it into a big mounded meatloaf in the bread pan.  However, when it came out, it was super moist, tasted absolutely amazing, and is one of the best meatloaf's I've ever made or eaten.  The hubby LOVED it and went for seconds.  This will be the recipe I use from now on.  I took someone's suggestion and let the cheese, oatmeal, egg, and milk mixture sit for about 10 minutes.  It did soak up some of the liquid.  Then I added the meat.  Like I said it still looked too moist but in the end it was a fantastic meatloaf.  I also used exactly 1lb of hamburger and not a package that had 1.2 or 1.3 pounds.  That could've been why mine was more moist too.

This was very good.  Followed the recipe almost exactly, just added a little onion and garlic powder and a couple of dashes Worcestershire.  I only made 4 meatloaves instead of 8.  Even my 15 month old loved this!

This is a wonderful recipe.  At first I thought it was too much milk, but it was perfect.  The meatloaves were done at the exact time stated and they were moist and delicious.  Loved the topping.  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing.

excellent! I put in several Tbsp's Worcestershire sauce into BOTH the meat mixture and the sauce, along with a few Tbsp. of dried jalapeno's to the meat mixture, which my husband really liked! I also just made it into the traditional loaf, instead of the mini loaves- baked @ 350 degrees for just over an hour. And I used about 3/4 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. ground turkey! I will definitely make again!

Easy and excellent. I substituted ground turkey and low-fat cheese.  It was delicious.

This was a great recipe. I made it as is, with only the addition of onion (as one reviewer stated, it's not meatloaf without). I also let the oatmeal sit in the milk for a few minutes as suggested and baked them in muffin pans. I got 11 meatloavies. Thanks for sharing!

I like the idea of individual portions.  Meat could use a tad more flavor.  Next time I will add some onions and garlic powder.

Love this recipe!  My boyfriend says it's the best meatloaf he's ever had and requests it all the time.  I like to add diced carrots and celery (about 1/2 to 2/3 cup each) and also a single serving bag of salt & vinegar kettle chips (crushed), plus garlic powder, oregano, and some chili powder.  The glaze is a great addition to the meatloaf!  Usually we make it in a 9x9 pan instead of the mini meatloaves, and often cook it on the grill in the summer (med or med-high heat) to avoid heating up the house.  Once we made it in a mini muffin pan for meatloaf bites to take to a party, they were a big hit!

I made these mini meatloaves tonight.  Results:  I will make them again, this time add some seasoning, a little bland for my taste.  I had ground venison which is very lean and the meatloaf just melted in our mouth.  I used muffin tins and they turned out to be the perfect portion.  Mashed potatoes and green beans completed the meal. I would not want to alter this recipe too much, it is good as is.  Thank you!  Can't wait to make these again.  A plate of these would be great for a pot luck.

I am not giving a lower rating because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used lean ground beef, 1% milk, and 2% cheddar to reduce the fat content.  I added garlic powder and a little dried onion.  Every thing else I followed exactly.  These were okay, but not the best... I found them to be a little bland.  If I used higher fat meat and dairy they probably would have tasted a little better, but I think the lack of seasoning in these is the only flaw.  I did like the individual serving idea, and will be using that in the next meatloaf I make.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! The glaze/topping is the best and really makes these pop!    I have made them twice now from demands of my family.  I use a muffin pan and come out with 12 perfect meat-muffins. I have only made 2 small changes - once I added finely chopped onion and the other time I used a meat loaf mix instead of all ground beef.  Both ways are fantastic.  The recipe is PERFECT as is, but can see room to 'play' with it for more creations - next time will be adding bits of bacon to the meat ... Who doesn't love bacon??  Thank you Tonya from all of us for the NEW way mommy makes meatloaf!

YUM! The glaze really makes these meatloaves outstanding - I did add a little steak sauce to it for the richness it adds. I added garlic and onion powders and a little worcestershire to the meat. My meat mixture seemed a bit too wet so I added some Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. The texture came out beautifully. Great flavor and super easy to throw together. Thanks!

I've been making these wonderfully delicious mini meatloaves for years, only we've called them Lil' Cheddar Meatloaves. And if I'm making them and in a hurry to get dinner done, I just make one large loaf instead, and bake it about one hour. Either way is yummy.

This recipe is very similar in how I've made my "little" "mini" small loaves. My recipe came from my mom and I have played with it little over the years. Oats absolutely! Onions are a definite! Garlic is also welcomed! I've used a combination of the oats and italian-style bread crumbs in the same mix. For the topping, because I'm not a big fan of ketchup; I still use just as much but I add a teaspoon or two of A1 sauce or Worcheshire to give it a little bite and more mustard. More recent years I started adding the cheese which is a nice touch too.

I really rate this a 3.5. After reading other reviews, I added approximately 1/4 lb. of additional ground beef.  I believe the oatmeal almost made the  meatloaf too creamy. I will make it with 1/2 oatmeal and 1/2 bread or cracker crumbs the next time.  I also think the addition of a little finely chopped onion would boost the flavor.  The ketchup topping was good but slightly sweet.  Maybe cut down the brown sugar just slightly. I wonder if adding the ketchup topping the second half of the baking time would allow the meatloaf to get a little "crustier."    The little meatloaves were adorable.  Children would love having a little loaf of their own.

I've been making this recipe for years and we love it! I got it from Taste of Home. We like it so much because you get more of the yummy sauce per serving as opposed to just a tiny bit on the top of a "slice" of regular meatloaf. They also tend to not be as soggy and greasy as regular meatloaf. I make it exactly as directed, but will try the muffin cups with cheese cube in the middle - sounds good!

I have to say this recipe is very, very yummy!  I forgot to take ground beef out of the freezer so I used ground turkey and added 1 chopped medium onion and about 1/2-1 tbsp of worcestershire sauce to give the turkey a little kick since it isn't as flavorful as beef is.  I also added fresh mushrooms.  I think I may even try adding broc. to it next time for a nice rounded meal, since I have a hard time getting my son to eat green veggies.  The sauce was THE BEST PART!!  A little sweet (and we love sweets in this family) so I think I might reduce the brown sugar a bit.  I had tasted the sauce before it was put into the oven and I have to say it didn't taste anything like it did when it came out of the oven.  Yummy,yummy.  My husband NEVER puts the food away for left overs but he did this dish.  He wanted to make sure it didn't get left out so he could eat it the next day,lol.  I also took the advice of others about making it in a muffin pan, turned out awesome.  cooking time was the same.  This recipe will definately be making it into my binder for future use.  Love the individule portions makes it serving to my 15 month old much easier.  Thanks a bunch!!!

I made these in a muffin tin and used whole oats, rather than the quick-cooking kind, since that is all I buy; I did let the oats sit in the egg/milk mixture for awhile in case they needed softening up!  We enjoyed this very much and look forward to meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow!  However, we do prefer the Brown Sugar Meatloaf, from this site, better. Thank you for sharing your recipe, Tonya!

Meat loafs were excellent. I found the glaze a bit overpowering. ( I used all & there was about 1 1/2 tbs per loaf) Next time I will make 1/3 the glaze & brush on.

These were great! I did make some modifications, however. I used ground turkey, no cheese, 1/4 C oats, 2 tbl. pl. breadcrumbs, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. pepper and 1/2 C chopped onion. I also put these into 12 muffin tins. These were very moist, and the sauce is outstanding! When putting them in muffin tins, you can get away with about 3/4 of the sauce. Thanks Tonya!

Nothing much to say here except that these tasted great.  I baked these mini loaves in a muffin pan.  The sauce really made the meatloaves, which themselves were a little bit lacking in the flavor department.  Don't mess with the sauce, but you may want to alter the loaf recipe for more flavor.

This recipe was one of the best ones for meatloaf I have found!  Having the mini meatloaves really cut the cooking time and made it cook evenly.  The sauce was great and I'll probably even use it for chicken and other meats.  This one is definately going into my regular dinner rotation!

This is a real family pleaser!  I've made them many times.  Great when you are in the mood for a meatloaf but want something different than the same old loaf you have been making for years.  The topping is very sweet and kids (ok adults too)like the novelty of having their own little loaf.

Very good recipe.  I will probably 
reduce the amount of ketchup next time, 
but otherwise it was delicious.

Everybody loves my meatloaf but it takes a long time to make because of the different things I add to it. I decided to make this one cause it looked easier, and my whole family loved it. It was easy fast and kids approved!!

Good recipe. I did as other reviewers suggested and let the oats, milk and egg soak for a few minutes. I don't know if that's the reason for all the oatmeal cookie complaints is the not soaking? I do need to figure out a solution for the grease, I put mine in muffin tins as well and made them 5 oz instead of 4 like someone else mentioned so the grease overflowed the muffin tin into the bottom of the oven. But I liked the bigger size better. I also threw in onions and Worcestershire but I bet you could do without onions and still be good. Not sure if the Worcestershire is dispensable or not. ;) I also doubled it and made twelve 5 oz muffins and five 4 oz muffins.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  However, I did make a few tweaks to it due to last minute planning for dinner.  Instead of oats, I used bread crumbs which soaked up some of the milk.  Also, I used less milk because I figured there would be too much liquid (which could also take some of the flavors away).  Instead of 3/4 cup of milk, I only used 1/2.  Flavor was great and made everyone happy.

Oh my goodness this was THE BEST recipe for meatloaf I have ever fixed or ate!!! Every other meatloaf I have made came out dry or unflavorful. With this recipe it was just right! I
did add minced garlic and a small diced onion. I have a mini loaf pan that bakes 8 loves at a time it was just right for this recipe. I made the mixture up in the afternoon, divided the mixture up into the pan then refrigerated it until I was ready to cook it that evening. My family loved this and asked for me to fix it again. I will keep this recipe and make this again! If you have been long for a good meatloaf recipe this is the one to try!

My neighbor does not cook. I told her that she should come over one night and I would help her gain the confidence to at least read a recipe. I picked this one out because it was very basic. We substituted the ketchup for a spicy BBQ sauce because I hate ketchup. Everyone loved them. My roommate called it a grand slam. Next time I may switch up the oats for crushed crackers or chips.

Tried this tonight for dinner. I'm rating it 4 stars since I had to make some modifications for more flavor, based on other reviews.  With my modifications I'd still only rate it 4.5 stars.  I mixed the egg, milk, salt, oats & cheese and let it sit for a bit to soften the oats.  I also added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of onion powder and about 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce. My husband said the meat still needed a little more flavor. Maybe I'll up the spices, or add pepper, or something else next time I make it.  I made them in a cupcake tin and yielded 9 mini meat loaves. I thought they were perfectly moist though my husband thought they should've been more moist and that next time I should make them in a larger muffin pan so they'll be more moist. (More moist center to dryer perimeter ratio per mini loaf, I guess) Sauce was great with prepared whole grain mustard.  I thought the flavor wouldn't be as bright as with prepared yellow mustard, and might go better.  All in all, I really liked it and will definitely make them again.

Was pretty good.  BF asked me to use pepper jack cheese and it made it fantastic.  Too much sugar for us in the topping though so we'll be omitting that next time.

Recipe as written is very good. Regarding letting the oats soak, I just let them sit in the egg/milk/salt while I was grating the cheese into the same bowl (5 minutes or so), which turned out great. I also added 1 large onion, finely diced, though I think you could use a little more depending on your tastes.

I made them in a muffin pan as others have suggested, my only criticism of this is that fatty ground beef can leak grease out of the top of the muffin holes, eventually ending up in the stove. I used 75/25 fresh ground beef, and had to put a drip pan below the muffin pan. I think in the future I will use 85/15 ground beef to reduce the grease.

The sauce is sweet, but I like it. I added a little more Dijon than is called for, as well as some Worcestershire. It is similar in taste to a sweet barbecue sauce, without any kick. The finished product didn't taste like mustard at all, in case you're mustard-averse and are curious.

We really, really enjoyed this!  I loved the individual serving sizes, and my daughter, who claims to hate meatloaf, begrudgingly took one because it was "so cute" and ended up eating the whole thing and going back for another :)  I can't fathom having meatloaf without onion, so I diced up a small one and tossed it in.  I also added just a pinch of pepper and a dash of garlic salt.  I could totally see adding some bacon and making these into little cheeseburger loaves, just to change things up a bit.  Absolutely wonderful they way they are though.  Thank you Tonya Swope- this will be in my Fall/Winter rotation for a go-to comfort food fix!

Made these last night & everyone loved them! I added some Worcestershire sauce to it (maybe 1-2 tsp.) & used Mrs. Dash onion instead of salt. Then shaped them into big burgers! Was the bomb. New hit with the grand kids. Thanks for the extra hugs! Oh, & the glaze was awesome, stayed right where u put it, would work great for pork roast & other meat too.

These were great. They were so easy to make too. I mixed the ingredients up and used 93% lean beef, 1% milk, reduced fat cheese, and dijon mustard. I lined a baking sheet with heavy foil and sprayed it lightly with PAM. I found out that a standard mashed potato scoop works perfect for measuring these out. It was exactly 8 scoops. After I got them on the pan, I just flattened the top slightly and shaped them into mini meat loaves before adding the sauce. I added about 7 minutes to the cook time, just because I like my meatloaf cooked well through. The overall calories weren't too bad either and they are portioned out.

I made some adjustments based on the amount of meat I had and my preferences, but this turned out perfectly.   This recipe is super tasty, super easy and a great representation of a classic meatloaf (mom's always had cheese). The biggest substitution I made was that I used half oat bran and half "fish shaped cheese cracker" crumbs (hooray for smashing fishy crackers with a rolling pin). I also added some dried onions, garlic powder, cracked black pepper and a touch of cayenne.
I did not make the sauce because I didn't have the ingredients but the meat loaf is so tasty you don't really need sauce if you don't want to.

If you do not like the taste of ground beef with no spices, garlic or herbs, you won't like this. especially if you do not use extra lean beef. I tried this recipe expecting a lot because of the good ratings so I was really dissapointed. I never cook ground beef without some type of herbs or spices or garlic. so those of you who do like the taste of meat on its own especially since I couldn't find extra lean beef, be careful. all I could taste is the grease and the flavorless meat despite the ketchup/sugar/mustard mixture. the cheddar (which I usually love) did not enhance the flavor but instead it made the whole thing greasier in a rather disgusting way. I give this 3 stars because my boyfriend liked them enough to eat the whole tray by himself because I couldn't touch them after the first few bites. If i ever do this again i'll add lots of fresh garlic and some pepper or other spices (liles all-spice) and i'll make sure to buy extra lean beef. so it is not so hard to enhance the recipe.

LOVE this recipe.  I did make some changes to suit our family - added 1/2 a chopped onion, used slightly less brown sugar and slightly more mustard.  Used bread crumbs instead of the milk and oatmeal.

I always look at a recipe as a base I can work from and this is a SUPER base recipe for me.  My husband, who usually HATES meatloaf loves these and will ask for seconds.  My girls will eat them even if they aren't feeling well.  Plus, they freeze and reheat really well :)

These came out so good!  I bet they would have been even better if I had quick oats, I used the larger variety and they didn't really absorb into the mixture as well.  I used a large muffin tin and made 4 bigger meatloaves. Will add this to my rotation!

Delectable! Moist! Tender! Must try. I didn't have quick cooking oats; so I broke up an uncooked thin bagel and added quick cooking cream of wheat. Didn't have shredded Cheddar; only had sliced, so broke up sliced into small pieces. Turned out incredible! Hubby loved it too! Absolutely will make again.

These were good! My sons loved them, the oldest had 3!!! I baked them in muffin tins as others suggested because my ground beef had just thawed overnight and for some reason still soft after adding more quick oats and another egg. Will make again!

Made these once and they were good, but thought they were better with a few tweaks: added 1/4 cup finely chopped onions, dash of Worcestershire Sauce and garlic powder, used saltines instead of oats, and reduced the milk to 1/4 cup. While you could tweak them any way you like according to your preferences, I think reducing the amt of milk was a NECESSARY adjustment. If you follow the recipe, they're very soggy.  I cook these in a 6-mini-loaf pan and the kids love them!

Overall very good but in the future we would just use ketchup of try a sauce from a different recipe on these. We found them just a bit too sweet.

These are really tasty! There weren't any leftovers, and I have picky ones!   I made mine in muffin tins for quicker cooking, but next time I will make them as the loaves and take a photo. The glaze is delicious and these are so easy!

Delicious!  I love that it takes less time to bake than traditional meatloaf.  I add diced onion to mine (about 1/3 c.)

This was yummy. However I'm rating it three stars because I feel that if you simply double a recipe by doubling the ingredients EXACTLY , then they should turn out the same. Unfortunately doubling the milk in this recipe leaves you with a soupy mess. I had to crush about half a pack of saltines to try to soak up some of the liquid. Turned out great though

So quick and easy that it's perfect for a weeknight meal.  If you have time, add some finely chopped onion, but if not the meatloaf is still delicious, flavorful and moist without it!

I halved the milk and cheese, added some Worchestire sauce and omitted the salt, used ketchup and BBQ sauce for topping, was fast and easy.

These are great!  The only thing that would make this a 5 star rating, for me, is a different topping.  I'm not a fan of the ketchup, mustard, brown sugar combo.  I'll probably just stick with plain ol ketchup next time.  I also reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and soaked my oats in the milk before combining.  This is a new favorite in my house!

Very tasty! I subbed rice milk for regular milk and omitted the cheese (allergies) and made them in muffin pans. My daughter thought the meatloaf muffins were yummy and had seconds!

Best meatloaf recipe ever!  I have been making it in olive-oil sprayed muffing tins, but the other day I used a loaf pan and it was just as good.  I do like the edges a little more "done", so I cook it for 5 to 7 minutes longer.  I also add 1 chopped onion to the meat mixture and a few shakes of worcestershire sauce to both the meat mixture and the topping mixture.

Really tasty! Quick & easy. Did add cooked onions, worchestshire sauce, pepper, it was great! The recipe is small enough that you could cook these in your toaster oven. (A nice option if you don't feel like heating the house so much, or if you want to be a little more energy conscious.)

Very very good.  I made exactly as directed except I did put it in a muffin pan as suggested by several people.  I'm not usually a fan of meatloaf but this one stood out so I figured I would give it a try, boy am I glad I did!  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good and easy. My family enjoyed it and said I should make it again.  I am not a big meatloaf fan in general, and have rarely ever had it. But, as far as meatloaf goes, this was good. I will use this recipe when making it. I used the pampered chef mini loaf pan and divided this evenly between them. It took about 45 minutes I think, as the stone wear takes longer and I made 4, not 8 loaves.

good recipe.  we're not meatloaf lovers but i gave this a try.  it was kinda bland.  needs a little something even after adding chopped onion and garlic salt (which was advised in other reviews).  if i ever make it again i'll spice it up a bit more.  the topping was YUMMY!  the texture was great.  i used lean ground beef.  overall good.

I almost wish I had never made this recipe, now it is the only thing my children want for dinner when they come over. The only change to the recipe I've made is one time I didn't have enough ketchup so I augmented with BBQ sauce. (Nobody noticed) We love it and I make it often.

This was pretty good. I ended up adding some garlic and onion powder because the recipe seemed like it would be bland. I did think the ketchup sauce was a bit too sweet.  would reduce the sugar next time. I also took the advice of other reviewers and made these in a muffin tin. It makes the perfect serving size. Great idea!

I am always skeptical when people say "that was the best ever!"  but this really WAS !  Made for my bunco group,  I doubled recipe and put it in 3 8-inch loaf pans.    I used  2 lbs ground sirloin and 1 lb ground pork.  It was lean and juicy.  Incredible !  everybody wants the recipe and I will always use this meatloaf recipe from now on.

Loved these - especially the glaze on top.  These are great when you don't have a lot of time to bake a whole meatloaf.  Mine were done baking in about 30 minutes.  Great dinner tonight!

Pretty good! Made these for dinner tonight. While I enjoyed my dinner very much, my fiance didn't (but he's picky when it comes to meatloaf...). My fiance thought the texture was too mushy & didn't care for the glaze (I have yet to find a glaze he will accept!). I thought the texture was just fine. Actually, I think the texture is much better than that of some meatloaf recipes I've tried recently on this site. I was a little put off by the oats, but didn't have bread crumbs or crackers available to substitute, so I forged ahead. To my surprise, I couldn't detect the oats at all. To boot, I got a dose of nutrition! :) As with any recipe, I have a couple of suggestions for improvement. First, you MUST add onion. I didn't feel like chopping one, so I added 2 T of dried minced onion. Second, garlic is another must. I added a t of garlic powder to my meatloaf, but wish I would have added garlic salt instead (my fiance's other complaint was this was underseasoned - i.e. needs LOTS of s&p). And finally, I can't imagine meatloaf w/o worcestershire sauce. Adding a t to my meatloaf & glaze did the trick. I too formed my meatloaves in well-greased muffin cups (too cute!). They cooked up perfectly in 45 min. The only downside to this method is that they swim in grease. I placed a slice of cocktail rye bread in ea. muffin cup to absorb some of it. Served w/ mashed taters, corn & dinner rolls, this was a filling, no-fuss meal. Thanks for sharing, Tonya! :-)

Very tasty.  Good idea to do them in mini loaves.  Probably one person could eat two loaves depending on what else is served.  I froze these so I could snack on them while breastfeeding.  I also added some frozen corn and onions to bring out a more savory taste.

ok. stop looking. this is it. i had my hubby make this when i was running late from work this week (really, it is simple so it matches his cooking experience :).  no changes.  we used 85/15 ground beef.  let me tell you - i don't like meatloaf. not even my own. just never catches me. this was marvelous.  i have always used oatmea, egg and milk but adding that darned cheese (even lower-fat Cheddar) made the meatloaf - despite the lower fat beef, these were moist and juicy and tasty. and the topping was to die for. really. my son and hubby wolfed down 3 each and i actually ate 2 (oink).  but then i realized - that was 4 oz of meat for me.  ok, so maybe it was not an oink moment.   i guarantee when i normally make a whole meatloaf, i use 2.25# beef and 1# pork and the two of them demolish 1/2 of it so there is a great portion control here.  don't change a thing. really. try it the way it is. i think it was great.  i can only imagine slicing these horizontally the next day for sandwiches if there were leftovers. kudos to Tonya on this one!!  i hope to find more of her recipes!

There were very many things that were wrong with this recipe.  I'm actually quite disturbed that so many people liked it.  The temperature wasn't nearly hot enough to get the meatloaves to firm up.  I cooked them almost twice as long, and had to raise the temperature just to get them to stay together.  The oats did not work well at all.  It really needed bread crumbs.  Also, the sauce was way too sweet. I don't know if something MAJOR went wrong, but we had to start dinner over from scratch.

Excellent recipe.  I always double or triple so I can pop the extra cooked mini's into the freezer for a quick meal.  Excellent for hot or cold meatloaf sandwiches.  I started making mini's when my kids balked at eating meatloaf.  They always seemed to like having their own.   These freeze well and sure cut down on the cooking time.  Don't skimp on the topping.  Easily adjustable if you don't have oats or would rather use seasoned bread crumbs.  Try these - you will never make a "full-size" meatloaf again.

Husband wont let me make any other kind of meatloaf! Great. I add a little more cheese, onion and cook some extra ketchup/sauce in a small sauce pan for dipping.  Don't be afraid of the cooking oats, they really hold them together so if you like firm meatloaves you can add more and it doesnt alter the taste at all.

These freeze well.  Make a double or triple batch and freeze in gallon baggies with waxed paper in between the loaves (use a straw to suck out all the extra air.  I've never tried freezing the glaze - I just make it as needed.  Also, they can be cooked on the grill w/o the sauce and are very yummy that way too.

This is the only meatloaf my family will eat.  I have been making it this way for years.  The only difference I also add Barbeque sauce to the glaze for more pizzaz.

Hands down my favorite meatloaf recipe. My kids went nuts and so did my husband and I. We used old fashioned oats and ground chuck. The consistency and flavor were fantastic. I doubled the recipe -- cooked half and froze half of the mini loaves on a cookie sheet. Once they were mostly frozen, I dumped them into a ziploc. I figure all I have to when I'm ready to eat them is plop them on a cookie sheet and make up a quick batch of the glaze. My kind of recipe!!

I made some alterations to this but liked the idea of using the oatmeal instead of crackers/breadcrumbs.  In addition to the oats I also put red pepper, celery, carrots, red onion and garlic in the food processor and ommitted the egg.  This was still very moist.   For the glaze I used ketchup, worcestshire and brown sugar with a few scallions.  My favorite meatloaf ever even my 13 year old who is a "sometimes" vegetarion loved this version.  Thanks for the oatmeal idea!

This meatloaf is so delicious-  the best ever- according to my family!  Even better- it is super simple with only a few ingredients but still packed with flavor.  This will be the go-to meatloaf from now on.

Really good! Not mushy like a lot of meat loaf. My husband loves meatloaf and we are always trying different recipes. That may change as until now there was never one that I liked as well as he did. I did add just a bit of garlic powder, but I'm not sure if it even made a difference. Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe. The loaves were nice and moist. Only thing I would do different is put some parchment paper or tin foil under the cookie tray I had the muffin tins on. The sauce made a mess!

These are great!  I add diced onion and green pepper to the mixture.  I use our favorite bbq sauce instead of making the one listed to save time.  I portion the meat mixture in my 1/2 cup measuring cup and make little mounds.  This way they are all even and they are just perfect! They are even better reheated the next day for meatloaf sandwiches.

Really great way to make meatloaf.  I've made this using the oatmeal and also using bread crumbs instead.  Both turn out great.  These are so much quicker than the traditional meatloaf and I freeze the leftovers for another meal.

Loved this! When I made it as small loaves as the recipe says, they were perfect. But then I used the suggestion to put in a muffin pan and wouldn't recommend it.  The grease has nowhere to go so the loaves get soggy.  Also, the grease tries to spill over so make sure the muffin pan has a cookie sheet under it.

Loved it!  Quick and easy.  Had to cook mine an extra 10 minutes, and I let them sit for an extra 10 before serving.  The sauce is perrrrfect.  Thank you, I will use this one over and over.

This recipe is very similar to what I make - I add onion and garlic powder, ketchup and mustard into the meat mixture, add more oats and 2 cups chopped baby spinach. Also 1 tsp worcestire sauce. I put it in a muffin pan and glaze it with the sauce (adding garlic pwder to the sauce too). For a great kids treat, dont glaze but instead top the "meatloaf muffins" with "mashed potato" frosting. Serve glaze on side. Great fun.

I have been making this recipe for many years. I actually made this recipe in a large quantity for a college project. I made about 150 mini-meat loaves that day, and who would of thought that meat loaf in a cafeteria would have been the biggest hit. I even gave this recipe to my mom, and she replaced her "tried and true" recipe with this one. It does have a sweet sauce, but that's what makes this recipe wonderful. If you are worried about sugar intake, replace the sugar with Splenda's new brown sugar product. Just a quick note... when you put the sauce on, don't worry about putting it on thick, because it won't run when baked. OH, the miracle of ketchup!

This is a great recipe!  My husband who only likes his Grandmother's meatloaf really liked this.  I did make a few changes.  1.  I used the muffin tins as suggested (more for my son then anything else) 2.  I soaked left over Italian bread (maybe 4 slices w/ no crusts) in milk and then wrung out the bread after 5-10 minutes and added bread (this is how I make my meatballs and really makes moist) 3.  I add 1/2 the oats recommended 4. Added onions, garlic powder, Worchester sauce.  Very good!  I will be making this again.  And I can't wait for a cold meatloaf sandwich for lunch!

Thank you Tonya! My family and I love these meat loaves. They are simple to put together and take not time to bake. What a great tase and that sauce is so yummy.... I made these one night while my mother was visiting. Now, undertand that she is so picky.... she cut one in half and put it on her plate and took a small taste and promptly put the other half and another full one on her plate. And, asked for the recipe. 
Folks, don't let this one slip by... it is so worth it!!
Thanks again Tonya!

I too added onions and a few more spices but this is the perfect foundational meatloaf recipe with which to tinker. The sauce was really good too.

I made one big loaf and really liked the sweet and spicy taste.  Made it into a sandwich the next day and took it to the park.  yummy!

This is so quick and easy to make and very tasty and moist!  My family really enjoyed this one so it will become a permanent recipe in my box.  The flavor has a barbeque quality to it and it smelled so good while it was baking that we were looking forward to having it for dinner.  I made it in a 12 section cupcake tin but the juices overflowed so the next time I'll know to put the tin on some foil to prevent spillage.

This was okay.  I just don't think I am much of a meatloaf person, so I don't want to be too unfair.  It was just a bit mushy for me.

These were awesome!  The sauce on top was great, too!  I added some fresh minced garlic to the meatloaves for added taste!  Yum!  I can't wait to make them again!

My family loved this!  I only used a 1/2 cup of milk  and added onion, green pepper, garlic powder and parsley flakes.  For the sauce I used Bold 'n Spicy brown mustard and result was absolutely delicious!

I love these. I made them once and then lost the recipe. I am glad to have it again. The cheese gives them a bit extra than just plain meatloaf.

My family is picky about their meatloaf.  I did have to add a T. or two of oatmeal to make the meatloaf firm enough to shape into loaves. The entire family loved the mini meatloaves. However, my 7 year old granddaughter didn't like the mustard in the topping. If she comes over again, I will just top her mini meatloaf with ketchup. So, another advantage of this recipe is you can customize each  meatloaf. My  husband said to add some green chilies to the topping on his meatloaf.

Delicious. One of my pet peeves on this site is the amount of people who give the recipe a lower rating after they've taken it apart and and tried to "better" it themselves with less than perfect results. Don't rate a recipe u less you've made it exactly as written first.. still don't like it? Then play with it till u do. It's inconsiderate to downgrade because of user error

Liked the concept of individual meatloaves; however, the texture with the oats was too soft/moist and the sauce was too sweet.  I took the liberty of adding a little onion and garlic to the meat mixture, and thank God I did...had I not done so I doubt anyone would have eaten this!  Overall just a big miss & hubs was making faces at me after (actually before) the first bite (not that that is unusual or anything).

This is the original Quaker Oats meatloaf recipe minus the cheddar cheese - it was made in a loaf pan. The oats make it moist - using breadcrumbs toughen it.

This is, hands down, the best meatloaf recipe I've ever tried.  I would have never thought to use oatmeal as a filler, but it definitely works!  Even people that hate meatloaf love this recipe.  And no matter what anyone says, it does NOT taste like an oatmeal cookie.  As a matter of fact, no one I've ever served it to has ever guessed that the secret ingredient is oats.  The only thing I do differently is make a brown gravy to go over the meatloaf upon serving.  I cook a 1/4 cup flour with a 1/4 cup melted butter in a small saucepan until it forms into a paste and starts to brown.  Then I add 2 cups of beef stock, and stir until thickened.  I then kick up the taste by adding a cube of Knorr Beef Concentrated Stock and a tsp of Kitchen Bouquet.  I serve this with the meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  There is something magical about the taste of the gravy together with the tomato/brown sugar topping.  If you are a mushroom fan, sauté some mushrooms with the butter until soft, and then proceed with the flour, stock, etc.

This is really tasty, and very moist! We made it as directed, using Dijon mustard. We let the oat mixture sit a couple of minutes before mixing in the meat per others' suggestion.  FYI each mini-loaf is about 1/2 cup, if you want to use a measuring cup to portion them and want the 8 the recipe calls for. Next time we are going to try adding cooked onion and maybe some spices - it was a little bland for our taste, but the texture is perfect.

This is a great recipe! I made the recipe as is except I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used what I had on hand. Also, I used a 12 muffin, muffin tin! I filled each cup with the meat mixture and topped each one with the mustard, ketchup & brown sugar mixture on top! This is OH SO YUMMY!! I will definitely make this again!

made exactly as written, loved the meat result, did not care for the topping sauce. 

Look forward to making again with plain tomato sauce on top, also I will bake on a broiler plate, as the 85% lean ground beef I used resulted in a ½ inch puddle of grease in the baking dish that the loaves were emersed in. Ew.

Good recipe. I'd make it again and experiment with spices and cheese. I agree with other reviewers about it being a bit runny. I'll reduce the milk in the future. I also recommend reducing the salt and adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder.

I loved it.  I used Italian Bread crumbs and did not add the cheese.  The sauce was great but to sweet for my husband. I can remedy that.  Easy, good, and quick meatloaf.  I liked it because it wasn't mushy.

This recipe is super delish! My husband LOOOVED it. What a great way to add a ton of flavor to otherwise boring meatballs. We ate them several ways. Just by themselves, or with marinara sauce on top on a sweet roll, they were amazing every way.

This was a great recipe! Instead of loaves, I made meatloaf cupcakes topped with piped garlic mashed potatoes and bacon 'sprinkles'. I made sure to use quick-cook oats and mixed all the other ingredients together before adding the meat (I wanted to make sure the oats were softened). I also added two tablespoons of salsa and simply spiced the ketchup with tandoori sauce instead of adding sugar etc. After 40 mins they were perfectly done, nice and moist! I will definitely make these again - I think mini-muffin meatloaf cupcakes with a dollop of mashed potatoes would make a great appetizer!

5* for taste (primarily the glaze which was wonderful), 2 1/2 to 3* for teexture (mushy mushy mushy).  If you enjoy really soft meatloaf, you'd probably love this - we, however, prefer a firmer texture.  Thank you for recipe :)

Wow, I loved this recipe and so did my family!  I make meatloaf quite often and they said this was by far the best.  The only change I would make would be to cut the sauce on top by half, it makes way too much.  Thank you for the recipe!!

The meatloaf itself was really great - yes it was a little wet, but that just made it really moist when it came out of the oven!!  I didn't like the topping that much - too sweet for my taste - will do much less brown sugar next time.  Only made 7 small loaves that needed about 20 minutes, not 45.  Very surprised oats worked in a meatloaf, will definitely make it again!

These were very delicious and easy to make! They cooked perfectly in a muffin pan, as others suggested. A few changes I made were adding a bit of onion and garlic powder to the meat mixture, and I also added some tomato paste to the sauce you put on top. Next time I will omit the cheese (not sure what it did to the recipe anyways because we couldn't taste it, so all it seemed to do what add calories) and add in chopped onions and bell pepper and tomato paste to the meat mixture, I missed having those in my meatloaf.

All in all though this recipe is great and definately worth trying!

i made this for my husband when we were still only fiances, and i am pretty sure it made him fall in love with me even more! They are soooo yummy and adorable! I of course served them with mashed potatoes!
Being mini, it really helps with portion control as well and perfect for taking to work for lunch the next day.

Very Good!  The glaze was my favorite part.  I followed the recipe exactly but only made 4 loaves as I felt 8 would be too small.  The next time I will add onions and leave out the cheese.  Thank you Tonya Swope for sharing your recipe!

The sauce was way too sweet and ketchupy.  The meat part was bland so you couldn't even scrape the sauce off and eat it plain.  Unfortunately not one person in my family liked this meatloaf.

I made these using a muffin pan instead of forming little loaves.  I have to say I was disappointed. I actually found them quite bland myself, I didn't get any flavor from the cheese at all, my daughter didn't even finish one and my husband tasted the sauce and then scraped the rest of it off before eating them. I followed the recipe exactly.  Won't be making these again.

very moist and tasty.  I was out of prepared mustard (ugh!)...so I added some dry mustard to the brown sugar and ketchup.  I used gluten free oats.  Still good...my only regret...there isn't more. :(  Next time i'll double the recipe.  (Oh, I also decided not to put the cheese in it - trying to cut back a little on the calories...not sure why I need cheese in my meatloaf anyhow? ...maybe I'll try it another time).  Awesome meal for my gluten intolerant husband!

I added diced red onion, grated carrot, seasoning, and a little Worcestershire. The end result was fantastic! The texture was perfect and the tangy glaze/sauce on top really kept calling me back for more. Even my picky 5 year old ate it (and my 2 year old probably would have liked it, too, had she tried it). My favorite meatloaf ever.

They are delicious!! I followed the suggestion of letting the oats soak for a while and it turned out really moist with perfect consistency. I didn't like the outcome from the cup cake pan though. I'll make it in a regular loaf pan next time. Thanks for the recipe. I'll definetly continue preparing it.

Muffin Tin version - I used 93% lean ground beef, decreased milk to 1/4 c, added half an onion (sauteed first with a dash of garlic powder and parsley flakes), and substituted bread crumbs for the oats.  Cooked for 25 minutes at 350.  My husband has never liked meatloaf, but now he requests this!

Overall, these tasted good but I think some of the proportions are off. To get a decent sized mini-loaf, I ended up with 6 of them, not 8 (and could have easily just made 4 of them, but I was concerned about that affecting the cooking temp and time). I also ended up with more sauce than we would have liked, and it was a bit too sweet, so next time I will scale back the ketchup, brown sugar and mustard.

This is the one thing I have never been able to make. I also, HATE meatloaf. Not anymore!  I added powdered and minced garlic, worcestershire sauce, homemade bread crumbs, and accidentally mixed all of the ingredients together. Had some homemade BBQ sauce, so topped it with that. Amazing!!!! Thank you for this recipe : )

This is one of the staple meals in our household! Instead of putting them into balls like the recipe suggests, I put them into 12 muffin tins. For the meatloaf, we use corn and mashed potatoes as a side.

We eat half of everything (meat, potatoes, and corn), and with the leftovers we make something like a Shepard's Pie. I crumble up the meat and place in the bottom of a loaf tin, then corn, then the mashed potatoes. The next day, I then put the Shepard's Pie in the oven at 350 for about 35 minutes, or until the mashed potatoes turn a golden brown on top. 

It's only my husband and I, but this recipe gets us 2 meals in one!! Love it!!

Really moist and great flavor, but I did add the onions most recommended and some garlic powder, onion powder and just a splash of worcestershire sauce.  Although we liked the topping I think next time I will add just a little less sugar.  Otherwise it was great and will definitely be adding to meal rotation.

Thanks Tonya. Your recipe is excellent. The mini meatloaves are a nice portion size and were moist and tasty. As others suggested, I added a finely chopped yellow onion, and a little garlic powder. I used 1/2 pound of ground round and 1/2 pound of ground pork because that was what I happened to have on hand.  I really liked the ketchup topping.  (I put my meat loaves in the oven and let them cook about 30 minutes before I put the ketchup topping on.  So, my topping did not get overdone). Thanks again for sharing a great recipe.

These were very flavorful. I used a big muffin pan with 6 and it worked perfectly. I also altered a few things such as using barbeque sauce instead of ketchup and adding a pouch of onion soup mix. Very tender.

Easy, kid-friendly and delicious!  I didn't have ketchup so used our favorite BBQ sauce instead and used about 1/8 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/4.  So good, and I will definitely put this in the rotation.  Served with sweet potato fries.

Excellent base recipe! Best I've ever had. With a few modifications, it was amazing! I used 1/4 each of quick oats and seasoned breadcrumbs, and used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef. I added 1tsp garlic powder, 1/4 cup yellow onion, and 1tbls Worcester sauce and otherwise followed the recipe! Excellent! I will be making this over and over again!

Four stars on taste, five stars on the idea of putting these in muffin pans. They cooked perfectly, no mess. I've had other meatloaf recipes that I enjoyed more, but these werent bad.

My go to recipe. I always double up, I use a meatloaf pan and ground turkey and make 2 big ones, not the little ones. I cook it at 365 for 50min to 1 hour (1 pound of meat per loaf), one loaf at a time. I use mozzarella or whatever cheese I have in the fridge. I serve it with white rice and butternut squash or just squash. It’s the perfect pair.

Very good and very easy.  Instead of salt I used a package of onion soup mix.  I also did it in the cup cake tins.  This was very moist and flavorful.  Best of all I had all the ingrediants.  I can't wait till my husband gets back from Kuwait to try it.  Thanks for the simple yet yummy recipe.

I did not have oats (or even breadcrumbs) so I held the meatloaf mixure together with two beaten eggs.  It worked quite well.  Also omitted brown sugar because I didn't have that either.  Added onions and a dash of red pepper flakes.  Lastly, made an indentation in the center of each individual meatloaf and poured steak sauce in it before baking.  Very tasty and easy!l

Pretty good.  Family loved it.  I didnt have oats and so I used bread crumbs.  Because of this, I did not use the milk.  Though, I will next time use 1/2 the amount listed in the recipe.  Big hit with the fam and will use this one again.

I have to admit after all the positive, rave reviews of this recipe, I am extremely disappointed.  I made it exactly as stated except I formed it into one loaf and added some finely diced onion and 1 teaspoon garlic powder.  It was still EXTREMELY bland.  The topping was good, but that was the only flavorful thing about the recipe.   I will not be making this again, and I had hoped to finally find a good meatloaf recipe :(

As a working bachelor, I love making these. They are simple to do, taste great and make terrific sandwiches when cold. I am having them again tonight with white quinoa,  steamed cabbage and carrots. Yum.  By the way, I use a soup ladle to form my minis - works well.

Tasty, simple and enjoyed by all (there was actually some fighting over the 2 leftover loaves the next day).  The sauce could have been cut in half though.

Maybe a touch too strong on the brown sugar -- but we had company for dinner and between 4 people there are no leftovers.  Arguably one of the best and easiest meatloaves to my memory -- moist, good flavor, and a breeze to prepare.  Well done.

Really nice idea.  I also like the fact that it calls for oats instead of crushed crackers.  The loaves had a really nice texture I thought.  Would make again.

I'm giving 5 stars; HOWEVER, not because this was a 'perfect' recipe, but because it's near 'perfect'. Overall, I thought the mini loaves were a great idea. Preparation was simple, and the taste was GOOD. I was hesitant about doing the sauce because of the ketchup (not a big fan), but am glad I used it. As other reviewers mentioned, my kids were licking their plates! This loaves were moist, but I felt they were lacking in flavor. Aside from the sauce on top, there didn't seem to be much taste. SO, with thoughtful seasoning in the future, this one's a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe! I added one teaspoon of garlic powder & half of a chopped onion for a little flavour. After reading some other recipes, I let the oats take in some milk (for a few minutes) before adding the meat. I halved the brown sugar because I didn't want it to be too sweet. It was very delicious and moist! I'll be using this again.

I had never used oats or cheese in meatloaf before but it was actually very good.  I loved the texture the oats gave but I'm not sure what the cheese contributed to the loaf, so next time I think I'll try it without. Only thing I did different was add onion because for me, meatloaf just isn't meatloaf without it.  The topping was a little sweet to me but not terrible... Definitely will make these again!

Great recipe! I cooked them in a muffin tin as suggested by other reviewers and they came out perfectly. I added a bit of garlic and black pepper. I love the texture of meatloaf made with oats and the sweet/tangy sauce is just right. Thanks for sharing!

I only gave it 4 stars because I made some modifications, based on other reviews. It's a good base recipe for meatloaf though. 

I used Italian bread crumbs instead of oats and increased the quantity to 3/4c. I also mix the milk and bread crumbs in a separate bowl first and let the crumbs absorb all the milk first. I also added a small onion, finely diced, about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and some Worcestershire sauce too, the meat seemed a little bland otherwise. 

I also cook them for another 15 min or so because I find they only made 4 individual-sized loaves (not 8) so I cook them a bit longer.

I didn't think I liked meatloaf until I had these and now they are one of my boyfriend's and mine's favorite winter comfort food recipes! So good! 

I think I will follow another reviewers advice and make these next time I need an appetizer for a party using my mini-muffin tin, for bite sized meatloaves!

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I have the pickiest little eaters, but they loved this recipe! They don't care for the sauce on top, but making mini loaves meant I didn't have to put it on theirs.

I have tried many meatloaf recipes over the years, but this is by far the best one yet. The only thing I add is a 1/4 cup chopped onion, because onion is a must in meatloaf.  scrumtious!!

Very good meatloaves. I used turkey instead of beef, otherwise I followed the recipe. The sauce was the best part. I will definitely make again!

I thought these were really good, and my husband just raved about them!  I used an oversized muffin pans instead of making them into loaves, which was so easy, and the meatloaves were the perfect size.  I substituted 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese for the Cheddar and added about 1 teaspoon garlic.  The flavor was great!

Favorite recipe on this website! I actually just make a whole loaf instead of mini ones and its so quick and delicious. I cut out the mustard just because I don't like the mustard.

Have made these twice now and I LOVE this recipe! I made it exact the first time, second time I cut down on the amount of sauce on top, simply because I liked the taste of the loaf alone and didn't want to hide it as much. My new go-to meatloaf recipe!

Have shared this with several ladies.  We love the ketchuppy sauce and that it is ready faster because of the small loaves.   Best meatloaf recipe I've ever tried.

Very adaptable and delicious!  I added some ground flax meal and dried onions, and omitted the sugar from the sauce - still quite sweet enough.  Will make again.

This meatloaf recipe is so good.  I never thought to use oats, but it works wonders.  My boyfriend can't get enough of it.  I make this at least twice a month.  Nothing beats a good old meatloaf with mashed potatoes on a cold winter day!  Thanks.

Started with this recipe, but made 1.5x the recipe since I had a 1 1/2 of ground beef...added 1T worcestershire sauce, some minced onion and some dried parsley flakes. I did mix the egg, milk, cheese, and oats and leave the mix stand for a few minutes before adding my meat. After mixing in the meat, it was super, super wet and sticky so I added some dried bread crumbs because I had used all my oats. I did not make the topping because my family doesn't usually like them. I baked them in my muffin pan. I got 12 very nice size "muffins" and I loved that I didn't have to cut a loaf. Well, considering I can't taste anything due to a head cold, I have to say these came out really good...my family said so! They are always honest about my cooking...sometimes brutally...and everyone loved these! This is a great recipe that allows you to add ingredients that suit your taste.

Loved this. I used the meatloaf mix you get in the store (has combo of pork and beef), and I used rolled oats since I didn't have quick cooking. These were so good and I liked the individual loaves. I will definately be making this again and again.

Thanks for this recipe; The best meatloaf I ever ate. Even the meatloaf haters here, had two servings.  Only thing I did different was add some green onions. Loved this. We will be eating more meatloaf in the future.

I made this in a muffin pan and it turned out beautifully! Such a great recipe and a good idea for portion control. This is one of the few recipes I've ever made off this website that I haven't altered in some way. It is great the way it is; don't change a thing!

Wow! I made these meatloaves for a group of 6 women, 3 of whom informed me afterwards that they don't like meatloaf. Chalked up 6 rave reviews! They ate all of them, so I didn't even get to sample them myself and find out what was so special, but I'll take their word for it.  I did substitute ground turkey for the beef, and because it was a little soupy when I followed the rest of the recipe, I also added 3 crumbled slices of stale New England Brown Bread.  I also added a bit of fresh-ground black pepper.  Happy to have another good dinner option for guests.

This is a great recipe!  Kid friendly, easy to make ahead, easy to customize & full of flavor.  I didn't have oats so I used the same amount of crushed saltines.  I also added a tablespoon of dried onion (only because I was out of fresh onion) and a teaspoon of garlic powder along with a tablespoon of Emeril's seasoning.  I thought that it would be too much milk but it turned out perfect - very moist.

I have been making this for years; soon after it was first posted.  We are a family of 5 so I double the recipe and put sauce on only half of the loaves made due to one pickier eater.  The left overs are gone within 2 days!  Thank you for this staple dinner!

We love it! Actually, it's having the oatmeal that made me try this. Instead of ground beef, I baked with Arabic lamb kofta and followed the rest. This is a keeper!

I've been making this recipe for 50 yrs. Never added cheese but use 1 cup of quick oats instead of 1/2c and add a chopped onion to the mix. I only add the sauce during  the last 10 minutes of cooking. Only meatloaf my husband and grandkids will eat. Great for sandwiches the next day, so make a double batch

This was absolutely the best meatloaf I have ever had! I made a few additions/changes. I added half of an onion, 1&1/2 cups diced mushrooms, garlic powder, oh and 1 lb of SAUSAGE (which really gave it the flavor it needs), 1/2 cup milk instead of 3/4 cup. I made 6 muffin sized in the muffin pan and the rest into a loaf. The loaf required more cooking time but 45 min was perfect for the ones in the muffin pan. This is my new recipe!!

This has become a regular at our house.  I have 4 kids who love when I make these!  I make them exactly like the recipe says.  I will warn that the meat mixture is very wet (or as my kids say "gooey").  The first time I made them I was afraid that the loaves would turn out too moist when cooked, but they don't.

This was very good. In particular, I liked the texture. Every time I've tried meatloaf before, my husband lovingly calls it "meat mush." This held together nicely but was still moist. I followed others' suggestion to allow the mix to sit before forming the loaves. Worked like a charm.  My only issue was the overwhelming ketchup taste of the sauce. Though all four of my children devoured it, I would have preferred a slightly toned-down flavor. I'll experiment and see what I can adjust in that regard. Still, this is my new go-to recipe.

My husband LOVES meat loaf... but was recently diagnosed with a gluten intolerance and my normal recipe uses bread crumbs. I found this online and decided to give it a try....SO GLAD I DID!!! I put them in my muffin pan and they turned out awesome! I used the suggestions that others said as far as letting the oatmeal mixture "settle" together for a little bit....and it was delicious. I also added finely chopped onions and bell pepper and fresh pressed garlic. It was delicious. Also for the Ketchup Sauce: I added Worcestershire Sauce and Tabasco....DELICIOUS! Thank you so much! My husband LOVED IT!

we never say the "m" word in our house.  my husband just cringes.    i call these little deliteful loaves of goodness yoummy stuff!   omg these are so not what you think of when you think of meatloave.  they are very very easy to make and sooooo yummy.  i prepared the recipe as written added lawerys salt and extra pepper.  i mixed it all up and let set in a bowl in the fridge till dinner time.  i kinda think this step is key so the flavors have time to meld and the oats suck up some of the milk.  it seemed kinda runny when i mixed it but by dinner time it was the right consistancy,   i did not top it with the ketchup mixture just tomato sauce and s & p.   oh my goodness.  the tomato sauce was sooooo right on.   so easy so yummy sooooo a keeper.everyone loved it.  i think this is company worthy..

Excellent recipe. I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce and some onion. And I formed mine into six loaves instead of eight, but otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. It was delicious! I served it with Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes. YUM! Comfort food to the extreme!

This recipe is the BOMB!  I made it as posted and wouldn't change a thing.  The texture is perfect; the sweet&sour topping is a great change from the ho-hum boring red ketchup that is traditionally used.  I made mine into a loaf and baked it for about 55 minutes.

YUM! Instead of mini loaves, I formed one big meatloaf and baked it on top of two slices of bread (to soak the grease) on a baking pan. For the glaze, I didn't have mustard, so I used dijon and it came out great.

THESE ARE AWESOME!  VERY TASTY.  I ALSO LET THE OATS AND MILK SOAK BEFORE ADDING THE GROUND BEEF.  I TRIPLE THE BATCH AND FREEZE THE LEFT OVERS.  I SPRAY A PIECE OF FOIL WITH NON STICK SPRAY AND WRAP EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY FOR LUNCHES.  I SPRAY THEM TO KEEP THE TOPPING FROM STICKING.  TRIPLING THE BATCH DOES GIVE YOU 24 MINI MEAT LOAVES OR GIANT MEATBALLS, DEPENDS ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE!!!

I made these last night and thought they were great! I followed some other reviewers by letting the oatmeal/milk/cheese mixture set for awhile. I actually put it in the refrigerator for about an hour since I wasn't ready to make the meatloaf yet. I used a meatloaf mix of 2/3 ground beef and 1/3 ground pork, for a total of almost a pound and a half of meat. I think the small amount of pork gave it a lot of flavor. I also used a packet of dry onion soup mix, chopped up a small onion and added Montreal steak seasoning, garlic and onion powder and left out the salt based on using the onion soup mix. I also cut down on the brown sugar for the topping and it turned out perfectly. I used a jumbo muffin tin and it made 6 jumbo muffin meatloafs in 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Very easy recipe!

Very good and easy meatloaf.  I especially like the sauce for this.  I used to use just plain ketchup and the mustard and brown sugar definitely add a lot to the flavor!  I also seasoned with some garlic and used a muffin tin which yielded 12 mini loaves.  It only took 25-30 minutes to completely bake.  I like this size because it works well for my two toddlers. They loved this both times I have made it and so did my husband.  Will definitely be making this regularly.

I've been making these little babies since I saw the recipe in a parenting magazine. Only change I make is throw in whatever spices I have that will go well with dinner and using crushed Ritz crackers or saltines, whatever crackers I have on hand. Flavored Cheese-it's work, too. My family dosen't care for the texture of the oats with the meat. My kids especially like these. NOTE: You can also use ground turkey or chicken and to make it easier for kids to pick up, you can cook them in your well-greased muffin tins.

Great recipe and so tasty. I followed the recipe as written except added one chopped onion and a little Worcestershire sauce. They were moist and the sauce added lots of flavour (I made it as written and did not find it too sweet at all).

Really good recipe, nice and moist. I used 1 1/4 lbs of gr beef and made them into 6 loaves so they were a nice size. Next time I will add onions and garlic and try them in the mini muffin pan. Will definately make again, fast and the kids ate it!!!

Half the family didn't care for the flavor of the cheese in the meatloaf, and the other half loved it.  It made some amazing cold meatloaf sandwiches the next day!  Will make the recipe again, but I'll cut back on the sweetness in the ketchup glaze.

This really is a meatloaf that lives up to the hype!  It was delicious - and I don't believe I've ever raved about meatloaf before.  I was a little worried about the oats though...I did not have 'quick-cooking' oats, only regular ones and after I added those in, along with some x'tra breadcrumbs (it just seemed too wet to stick together w/ just the oats) and popped it in the oven, a friend of mine told me "don't use regular oats"!!  So, I was sweating it...thinking I'd ruined the dish by not using the 'quick' oats like the recipe called for.  Luckily though, I had followed several other reviewer's suggestions and had soaked my oats in the milk prior to adding my meat mixture (grd. beef and grd. pork).  I think the soaking of the oats saved the day.  It all turned out in the end - great taste, great texture and the kids ate the heck out of it! Next time I'll be sure to use the correct oats though - just to see if there is a difference.

good, although a bit too soft for me. i prefer meatloaves that are not as bread-y.  i would increase the amount of ground beef next time.

This recipe is awesome! I followed other readers' advice and reduced the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon, let the oatmeal soak in the liquid for a few minutes before adding the beef, and added some garlic and onion. It was delightful, and even my very picky-eater 5-year old son loved it and ate a whole mini-loaf -- along with the potatoes, broccoli, and carrots I used to create a "Meatloaf Man". Lots of fun to put together and the whole family loved it.

Super easy and tasty!  I didn't really change much except that I added maybe 1/4 cup more quick oats because it just seemed to need more to hold the mini loaves together and then I added a heaping tablespoon more of the brown sugar and a squeeze more mustard just to cover the meatloaves better.  Served them with a side salad and butter and herb egg noodles.  Yum!

This was a great recipe!  I will definitely make again. I grinded the oats so they had the consistency more like bread crumbs, and they turned out great. I also put them in a muffin pan and loved the result.  My dad (who has only ever known my mom's traditional recipe) raved about them and told my mom to get the recipe from me!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

These turned out really well.  I doubled the recipe, and used half ground turkey, but only mixed up a single batch of glaze. I used only 1 tbls of brown sugar, and felt like I had enough glaze and it was sweet enough.  I did some in muffin tins and mini loaf pans at 45 minutes, and they turned out just fine.

My husband reall liked this meatloaf.  It was real moist.  There was some changes that I did make.  I added a packet of the lipton onion soup mix and some worc. sauce.  And I did cut back on the brown sugar.  It was very moist and tasty.  But by adding the onion mix I think that made it great.  Will cook again.  I also put it in muffin pan and made mini ones.

Based on all the rave reviews, I thought I'd give these a shot, and I'm confused as to what the fuss is all about. I made these for my family last evening, and I wasn't impressed.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, added garlic salt, onion powder and some black pepper. I like to stay true to a recipe the first time I try it, but couldn't forsee enjoying this dish with the only seasoning being salt.  These were really bland, unimpressive tasting meatloaves.  I cut the sugar in the sauce by half, and it was still super-sweet.  Reminded me of a T.V. dinner meatloaf.  Even the kids didn't like it.  My husband said they made him a little melancholy; they reminded him of his bachelor days.  He said he'll pack them for his lunches, but the rest of the family won't eat them again.  Not a keeper.  Sorry.

Fan-freakin'-tastic! I loved it!  The only thing that I did differently is added a little onion powder.  The sweet sauce is great and these came in the perfect portion.  I made them yesterday and I can't stop thinking about them.  Try this!

My momma makes this exact recipe, only we call them lil' cheddar meatloaves!I used to absolutely hate meatloaf mainly because eating a loaf of meat sounds disgusting, but after eating these, I was able to put aside the name, and actually enjoy meatloaf for the first time!This has been our standyby recipe for years now!We always make alot of little loaves too, so we can have them as leftovers,for they taste just as good when they're reheated!

This was great! My family and I loved it. The only thing was it seemed a bit runny when I mixed it up so I added extra oats and cheese and I also added chopped onions and green peppers. It was delicious and so easy.

WOW! So good. And I have used venison! The original recipe is a bit bland (hence four stars), so I do add a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce and a few Tb. of chopped onion (or a 1 Tbsp. dry minced). I also halve the salt and add about 1/4 tsp. each sage and marjoram. Fantastic. This is my go-to recipe.  ** IDEA: Make these for Valentine's Day (or any day) by hand-shaping into hearts, and spooning the sauce on in a heart shape. My sauce stayed put and did not drip!

This recipe was awesome but I did add some of my own "flavor" to it.  I added about 1/2 to a 1/3 a cup of onion to it, used 1 tsp of garlic powder and also instead of sharp cheese used the Kraft classic melts four cheese...this was AWESOME my husband loved it, my 3 year old ate it as well as my 10 month old...will definately be making again and again.

Great! I preferred gravy with tomato,  and dry white wine - cooked in the meat's sauce. And covered the loaves with strips of bacon and cooked peeled banana and potato's on the side. Nice and saucy! Perfect family dish...

I generally don't like meatloaf but my husband loves it - so I decided to give this recipe a go and it was fantastic.  The mini meatloaves are nice - and more aesthetically pleasing for serving to people.  My only change was that I shredded a raw potato into the meat mixture before forming the meat loaves and it really made them nice.  The sauce for the top is excellent.

This was quick, easy & good.  I also used a muffin tin sprayed with pam, I didn't have oats so I used italian bread crumbs and added mustard to bbq sauce for the topping.  My family loved it and this is how I will be making meatloaf from now on.  Thanks!  A keeper.  I served with Mashed Potato's, Steamed Broccoli & Rolls.

OMG!!!!! This is sooo good this will be my staple meatloaf. I used 1/2 cup of plain breadcrumbs instead of the oats and 1 1/2 tsp of dry mustard. The test was this evening when my picky 2yr old daughter ate it and said "Mommy I love it Mommy, I love it!" Whew whhooo thanks for this recipe. Will be making my meatloaf no other way.

I have made this many times.  With different people on different schedules, I make them ahead and put them in the refridgerator so I can cook them as people come home for dinner.  Add a salad and microwave a potato and you have a complete meal.

Easy and delicious.  I used 1.5 pounds ground turkey and .5 pound ground pork.  This made exactly 12 muffin tins.  I sprinkled cheese on 1/2 of them and then spooned the sauce on all of them.  We ate 1/2 the batch for dinner and then I froze 1/2 the batch for another night.

Very easy, very yummy recipe! I used bread crumbs instead of oats, added a chopped onion and used only half the brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers. Turned out great! I make extra when I make these; It's easy to flash freeze these (sauce included), then pop them in a plastic container in a single layer or layered with foil or wax paper in between to avoid them sticking to eachother. I just store them in the freezer until I'm ready to use them again and throw them in the oven to reheat for dinner another day.  My husband, who had never tried meatloaf before, loved it too. Thank you!

I have stopped looking for a meatloaf recipe....totally amazing. I love meatloaf, but my husband doesn't and I needed to find a recipe that would knock his socks off so Meatloaf would be 'welcome' more often. This is it! He was blown away and so was I. I did, like others, add some garlic powder and onion, but the recipe is awesome!

I thought these were really good, but a little greasy. I really think it needed chopped onion or some garlic mixed in with the meat to add some extra ZIP! I will make these again, but I will add some onion and make the topper with salsa instead of ketsup.

My husband really loved this, I thought it was pretty good too although I didn't care for the sauce-it was too sweet for me.  I will modify this recipe next time by adding chopped onion and decreasing the brown sugar. I also just made it into 1 loaf, plopped the mixture into a lightly greased 9" bread loaf pan and baked 350 degrees for appx 1 hour (until meat thermometer in center of loaf = 160 degrees.)

My husband told me he did not like meatloaf, but would give it a try when I told him I was making this.  One bite, and his opinion of meatloaf is forever changed!  My kids loved it too!  I added some chopped onion and a bit of worcestershire and used a muffin pan, which made 6 loaves.  My picky 6 year old son loved it so much, he ate 2 (1/3 of the entire recipe!).  He told me he wants me to make it all of the time!  I'll definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe. The things that I changed was that I added Worsterchire sauce, garlic powder, bellpepper, onion, and celery. I've never made meatloaf before but order it all the time and restaurants. This was way better than any that I've had. I also added some grey poupon to the sauce on top. I only made four out of my mixture and one was enough for each person. They are really great.

This was a terrific, tasty dish that we ate along with mashed potatoes.  My husband and kids loved it, and since I used about double the ground beef we were happy to eat leftovers - twice! I made a couple of changes, as noted in some of the reviews.  I used bread crumbs (homemade, by making toast and mixing it in a blender) instead of oats, and I added garlic powder and diced onions for more flavor.  Since I was out of have cheddar cheese, I just cut up American cheese slices instead. I also set the timer early to avoid over cooking, but found that 45 minutes was just right.  Next time I hope to try it with Worcestershire sauce.  I plan to make this often.  Thanks!

This was good and I made a few changes.  I added 2 slices of raw bacon, sliced to the mix to give it more flavor.  And instead of 8 loaf's, I made it 4, but was tasty.  I liked the sauce on top, I didn't need Ketchup.  We will have this again.

Great recipe! My husband was really excited about it and said the sauce was like the kind he's had in restaurants before -- wow! I added half an onion (diced) just to give the meatloaf the onion-y texture that I associate with meatloaf. The cheese gave it a different and tasty flavor. Was able to make five medium-sized loaves with it. Yum!

What a treat...my 8 year old decided to make dinner so he actually made these for us....it's that easy.  Not only was he super proud but these were wonderful.  Hubbie doesn't like meatloaf but loved these.  I think he remembers Moms meatloaf with lots of breadcrumbs to stretch a 1lb of meat.  Sub. Italian breadcrumbs for oats...and next time will add some onion.

These mini meatloaves are great. I've made them atleast a dozen times already. I use ground turkey instead of beef and italian bread crumbs instead of oats. Turns out great! The family loves it and the sauce on top...fantastic!

Delicious!! I added chopped onions as many members suggested and i believe it was necessary in order to add some more flavor to the meat. The sauce is very good and it's enough to cover top and sides of the meatloaves. They looked very cute and the consistency was perfect. I did use lean ground meat (97%) which i think makes a big difference in every ground meat-requiring dish. I'll be making these for years to come.

These were very good. With the sauce they taste a lot like Brown Sugar Meatloaf from this site. I think I will make these again and I might try them w/o the sauce.

Very good and easy to prepare.  The zippy sauce works nicely with the meatloaves.  I doubled the recipe and followed it almost exactly except that I used half oatmeal and half breadcrumbs.  My family enjoyed it and I'm sure to make it again!  Thanks for a keeper!

These are great!  I usually sub in 1/2 cup of dry bread crumbs for the oats and also mix in a small chopped onion for extra flavor.

Tastes just like a cheeseburger.  Really really good.  I liked it shaped in mini loaves, the kids usually won't eat meatloaf, but these looked like big meatballs, and they ate them up.  This will be a regular meal in our house!

My husband is a picky eater and was a little hesitant when I told him I was making meatloaf for dinner. I used the muffin pan and he ate three quarters of the mini meatloafs. They were a huge hit! He also asked if I could make more for lunch the next day.

This recipe was way too bland. Definitely should have read the reviews and added onions. I could even taste the oatmeal. Would not recomend. I did like the idea of the mini's though!

We aren't big meatloaf fans but I was looking for a way to use up some ground sirlon and gave it a try.  The husband and I both cleaned our plates and enjoyed every bite.  I did add onions, fresh garlic, worcestershire Sauce and colby/jack cheese.  Even if you don't like meatloaf try this one.

This is an excellent meatloaf recipe!!  My husband loved it.  Usually he slathers meatloaf with ketchup--but he thought this was perfect, as is.  I made it as one loaf in a regular size bread pan.  I shaped the loaf smaller than the pan so that the sauce covered the top and sides.  I added an extra 15 minutes to the cooking time as the loaf was bigger.  My whole family loved it!  I will definitely make this on a regular basis.  Thank you, Tonya!

Delicious! My only complaint is that the recipe certainly wasn't for 8 servings! I made 4 mini meatloaves that all turned out wonderful. I only used about half of the ketchup mixture on the loaves. And I only put a touch of brown sugar in (as opposed to 1/4 cup). Will make again!

This was so good..however while I was making it I was distracted and just added everything together and mixed it up and baked it. It turned out awesome so that is an idea too...add the glaze into the mixture to mix it up a little!!

Why did this get 5 stars? I dobled the recipe, with high hopes. It was yucky....no one in my family liked it, and I threw 4 of the loaves away. What a shame! Only different thing I did was to add garlic powder and oregano (just a touch of each). The oatmeal made it soggy or something, it was too soft in the middle, just not a nice texture. The glaze was too sweet even though I cut back on the sugar. Sorry, I won't be making this again.

Sponge-like texture. This tasted okay but not great. I'll stick to my recipe, but the kids liked the mini idea. Also one pound of ground beef cannot feed 8 people. I used 2 pounds.

Very simple, you can't mess it up. I've made this one over and over and over again and am always pleased with how it turns out. It's my hubby's favorite meal. (What is it about guys and meatloaf?) I think the best part is the glaze, and the individual loaves makes it nice that you don't have to slice it.

i just made this tonight and it turned out well, my dad said it was very good and he usually doesnt comment much. of course like most cooks i didnt make it exactly as the directions said, i made just one loaf out of it and baked it at the same temperature for 1hr and 10mins, also i didnt have any shredded cheddar so i used cheezwhiz. it was very good but i will probably add some chopped onion next time.

This recipe is AWESOME! My husband has been asking me to make meatloaf, but I HATE meatloaf. I finally gave in, and made this recipe, and we both LOVE it. The first time we ate it, I froze some. We ate it the first night, then the second, then he had me heat up the frozen loaves for the third night! Amazing!! Thank you , thank you, thank you!! One note: I decreased the brown sugar to 1/8 cup in the glaze. I also added a couple of shakes of oregano and garlic pepper to the meat mixture before I made the loaves.

My husband loved it.  I thought it was good but then I am a very picky eater.  The glaze was a little bit on the sweet side. I'll definitely make it again - just with less brown sugar the next time.  For one thing, its sure easy to make.

I have been experimenting with meatloaf recipes and can now stop my search. These were delicious and easy—my hubby said they were the tastiest meat loaves he’s ever had. I had old fashioned oats so I ground them up a bit in my Magic Bullet. Like other reviewers, I added some finely chopped onion and Worcestershire sauce; used Dijon mustard in the glaze and it was perfect!! So happy to have found his recipe—will have to double it next time so we have more leftovers. :-)

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have found on Allrecipes!  I have tried others which were ok..but not quite what I was expecting.  As others have suggested, let the oatmeal and seasonings sit for at least 20 minutes to let the oatmeal soak up the milk.  I made these in a muffin pan.  It made 12 meatballs about 3-4oz. each.  Baked these for about 30 minutes.  Finally I found the right one!

I've made these a couple of times and they are easy, delicious and bake in 30 minutes. I altered the recipe slightly by adding some pork sausage to the mix. It gives a nice texture and blends in with the beef so you don't taste it separately. I used a different topping because I wanted something more than ketchup and/or tomato paste. After reading some of the other reviews, decided to revise my review. I also added some chopped onion, garlic powder and 
some Worcestershire. I left out the cheese and salt because my Dad is on a very low sodium diet. You can also pulse the oatmeal to be more like bread crumbs.

Thanks for the great recipe!

Due to what I had in the house at the time I made a few changes. Instead of the sauce I didn't have all the ingredients for I used a smoky BBQ sauce. I only used about 2/3 of the milk it called for. And I was out of oats so I used bread crumbs. It tasted awesome the texture was great

I  sauteed (almost carmelized) a chopped red onion in olive oil to the Ground Chuck mix and used Social Crackers (Club) instead of Oats. I also used a chedder/jack cheese mix. I used seeded Dijon Mustard in with the catsup and brown sugar.  
Very moist.
Served with mashed potatoes... comfort food.

This is a great recipe as it is but there are a couple changes I do to spice it up some.

1) let the oats soak up the milk and egg before adding the meat to the mixture
2) add a teaspoon of onion powder
3) instead of regular salt, use seasoned salt
4) for an extra kick use harissa ketchup

Always looking for a new meatloaf recipe - This one was fantastic.  Followed others advice and added some garlic, worchestershire sauce and pepper.   My husband found out last minute that he had to attend a meeting, so put the prepared loaves in the fridge overnight and made them the following evening - They were moist and flavorful.  Made 3 loaves instead of the 4 the recipe called for, and it was the perfect amount!  will definately make these again.

I made in a muffin pan also; it makes 12 small servings.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 an onion & 2 garlic cloves.   I will make again.

This is the BEST FREAKING MEATLOAF I've ever had in my life!!  I've even passed it on to friends & they raved about it too.  Two things I did.... Let the oatmeal/milk mixture sit for about 6 minutes to allow the milk to absorb.  And I added 1/2 cup chopped red onion (I doubled the recipe, so just use 1/4 cup if only using 1 lb of meat).  Everything else remained the same.  Be generous with the sauce.  Use it all!  

I know, I know... the whole oatmeal thing sounds gross.  And, I'm not crazy about cheese in meatloaf either, but OH MY GAWD, you won't be sorry you tried this recipe!!  I ate leftovers the next morning for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  And I'm making it again tonight.  My entire family loves it.  It's THAT good!

My husband is very picky, even though he's sweet and never says anything bad about what I cook, unless I ask him.  He said that this recipe was "a keeper", and that my friends is a huge compliment.  I have made this several times.  I haven't changed anything, except my daughter made 5 loaves instead of 8 and so we baked it for 50 minutes.  We all love these cute little loaves.

I tripled the recipe to make 24 muffin style meat loaves. I used garlic and herb bread crumbs instead of oatmeal. I added two chopped onions, some garlic salt, pepper,  and onion powder, on top of the salt that the recipe already asked for. It was amazing. I baked them at 350 for an hour and 20 minutes.

This was a hit!  I also substituted the oats with breadcrumbs, added onion, and made in a muffin pan.  Delicious!  Next time I will add some garlic and Worcestershire sauce as others  have suggested.  Look forward to making it again!

This is by the far the best meatloaf ever!   I don't normally care for meatloaf, it's something I only ate when I had to, to be polite, but this recipe changed that!  It's a family favorite now.

The best meatloaf recipe -- I have made this recipe several time. I will always use it just slightly modified to my taste. I sometimes add a sautéd half onion, 2 garlic cloves or 1tbs garlic powder, and a diced bell pepper and add to the meat mixture. I also use 2lbs meat -- lean 90/10. I don't like all that fat in the pan. I use ½ cup half & half (instead of milk) and add the bread crumbs to the milk and egg mixture. I want to the bread crumbs to soften up before added to the meat. I use a cookie sheet or my cast iron pan to bake in the oven. DELICIOUS!

This is a recipe I always go back to. The oatmeal gives it a great texture, and I just love what the cheese adds to this. As one user suggested, I used a muffin pan, and it worked out great. Make sure to put another baking sheet underneath in case grease spills over. One night as I was making this, I realized that I did not have any eggs or milk, so I used Greek yogurt as a binder instead. It worked flawlessly and it made the recipe even easier than it already is! And no, if you use plain yogurt, you will not notice any yogurt flavor in the finished product. I will continue to go back to this recipe!

Really good, and fairly quick/easy!  I made it as written except for adding a bunch more seasoning - I threw in some garlic powder, minced onion, Italian seasonings and a few other things.  Great taste, and fairly moist meatloaves.  I used about 1.3# ground beef, and measured out a slightly rounded 1/2 cup for each loaf, and then shaped them into little ovals.  NOTE: The sauce really burns onto the baking sheet, so next time cover it with aluminum foil.  Clean-up's gonna be a bear tonight....

My family loves the meatloaf however 1lb of hamburger only gives you 2oz meatloaves and that is before shrinkage so i double everything in the recipe except the sauce. I form 10 - 12 mini meatloaves and do not need to increase the baking time. I then have enough for the meal plus a couple leftover for sandwiches.

This was a delicious recipe.  However, I added a chopped small onion. I can't make meatloaf without an onion.  Thanks for a great recipe

I scaled this down to fit the the six ounces of ground beef I had to use up, except for the egg (and thus had to add an extra TB of oats). It made three little loaves, which was perfect for my family of two. I added about a TB of onion flakes, but that was the only change, and these were yummy. I particularly appreciated the shortened cooking time, and will make these again.

Delish and Quick and easy. My 5 yr old loved it. I put them in muffin tins for slightly smaller portions. Next time I will double the batch and freeze half.

This is perfect for people who live alone. You can wrap the extras in foil and freeze for a quick home-style meal. I used seasoned salt instead of plain salt. I added 1/2 tsp. thyme and 1 tsp. ground black pepper. I did not use the brown sugar in the glaze, but added 2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar to the ketchup and mustard. I will probably continue to refine this recipe, but the basic composition of the mini meatloaf is excellent. It is also gluten-free.

My fiancé and I liked this recipe. The recipe reminded me of my Mom's growing up and she used the same topping, which I think is one of the best toppings for meatloaf (BBQ sauce, is the second best.) I like the smaller loafs, it cuts back on cooking time. I made it as the recipe states, didn't change anything and it was great the way it's written. I was a little concerned at first because after mixing it seemed too mushy. But the loafs came out moist, not dry. They were great! I will definitely be making this again.

Sooo yummy I served it with mashed potatoes and used the sauce and juices as an au ju. The sweetness was a perfect breakup of the starch. I also added chopped onion and Worcester sauce

It was great. Family scarfed down everyone of the mini loafs. Will definitely make again! I did make one addition. I added dry minced onion to the loafs.  Thank you so much for sharing....

Super easy to make! I stripped 1/4 c of onion using a cheese grate and browned it with 1 finely chopped garlic clove in 1 tablespoon of olive oil to add flavor.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written and was delish. Everyone in my family loved it except for my 7 yr old...but then again she never likes anything hahaha

Made this tonight......delicious!! I doubled the recipe with all ingredients but salt.  Just put in 1 1/2 tsp. of salt.  I didn't add the grated cheese.  I added 2 T. of minced garlic and about 2 T. of grated parmesan cheese to the meat mixture as well as some rosemary.  The sauce is very good.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Can freeze some for later if you double the recipe!!

I haven't tried this recipe but it's similar to one I've been using for  50 years.  I gave it 5 stars to counter-act Larry's rating of two.  For over 30 years I've been using oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs because one day I didn't have breadcrumbs in the house so I substituted the oatmeal instead.  I love oatmeal cookies but believe me, this doesn't taste like oatmeal cookies at all.  In fact, you cannot even taste the oatmeal, it's just a binder.

My husband and I grew up disliking meatloaf, sorry mom. However, I blame the recipe not our moms. When we married I promised not to make it. Today in a last minute desperate attempt for a meal, I found this one on All Recipes with over 1500 likes in the 5 star category. I figured, if it has that many likes it has to be good. I decided to try it. Long story short, it was a hit! My husband  said "excellent dinner" and the kids loved it as well and asked for seconds. This is definitely a keeper in the recipe box.

I recommend using bread crumbs instead of the oats, it gives it a more meatloafy flavor.  As one person put it, the oats make it taste like a meat cookie lol.  You can use a muffin pan to cook these, too, it keeps them even in size and round.

Made these as directed and it was good, but something was missing. Then I realized I forgot the onions!!  I did add Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder as others suggested. Will try again, but remember the onions and I think it will be a keeper.

This recipe was awesome I did though add a few changes.  I put 1/2 tsp of montreal steak seasoning, 2 tbsp of garlic powder, 2 tbsp of onion powder and two tsp of worcestershire sauce in the meat mixture.  Cut the sugar in the sauce to two tablespoons and a tsp of worcestershire sauce. Came out amazing there was nothing left my men devored it.  Paired it with cheesy mashed potatoes and green been casserole....Nice change to my normal meatloaf recipe.

The only way to make meatloaf!  With individual loafs, the texture is better, and the sauce is more evenly spread (which is why I like loaf over muffin).  What I like most about making this recipe is that the mixture is much more pliable than other meatloaf recipes I have made.  Actually, I thought it was going to be too soft to make into a loaf, but it was perfect.  Seriously one of the easiest comfort food recipes I've made.  In a hurry, I made this along with some prepackaged mashed potatoes (the humanity!), and a steamer corn package.  Done!  Will probably add a little chopped onion next time.  Stick with the oats over bread crumbs.  Store bought crumbs make a denser loaf.  One small warning, if you are a family of hearty eaters, you might want to double up.  2 mini meatloaves is really only a 1/4 pound of meat.  While health nuts call that the perfect size, I'm HUNGRY DANGIT!

Ridiculously wonderful. I made enough for 4 with this recipe. Big hit; Could really taste the brown sugar, ketchup mix. Marinated real nice through the meat. Served with a side spinach - strawberry salad.

AMAZING.  My husband is allergic to eggs so I used some corn starch instead. At the help of others i also incuded some worchestershire sauce and onions.  TO DIE FOR!  I think next time I'll add some hot sauce to the topping for a kick.  Overall, may be my favorite recipe ever.

I thought it was very very good. I used a pound and a half of ground beef, but I didn't increase or change the rest of the ingredients at all. I smooshed it in a cupcake pan and baked for 30 minutes because my oven runs hot. I got 12 meatloaf muffins. My family loved them! They are very rich, so I wouldn't be able to eat this regularly, but this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Made this last night.  Used mini pie pans that I purchased at TJ Max's. (Same size as the Chicken Pot Pie)  Sprayed with Pam and baked them on a cookie sheet.  Made 4 good size loafs.  Added minced garlic, onion and chopped mushrooms.  Very tasty will make again.

How do you keep them from getting burned in the bottom? This is my first time making them cooked 40 minutes and they burned on the bottom, I assume  from  sugary sauce running down.

This was delicious! The entire family, including my 4 year old and 10 month old, loved it! My husband requested the recipe be put in my rotation. The only changes I made were I added some sauteed onions, a little pepper, and garlic. I also added a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the topping. I made in an 8 mini loaf pan.

I added onions, garlic powder, and marjoram, and I also put them in muffin pans. The kids beg me to make more 'meat muffins' all the time. I've even made them with venison, added rosemary, and thyme, and used Cooper sharp for a completely different twist. Great recipe!

These were really good. I too used a muffin pan and sprayed it with canola cooking spray. They came out so moist and yummy. I added garlic and onion powder to them for a little extra flavor and i only made six mini loaves.  I will be making these again!

I am rating this 4 stars because it was probably the best meatloaf, texture wise, I have ever had. Very moist. I made it as a full meatloaf opposed to the 8 individual ones. I also added onion based on another review. Taste wise however, it was very bland, even with the added onion. I will absolutely make this again, but will add some more seasonings to both the meat and topping.....my 7 year old loved it as is....great recipe! I thought oatmeal and milk in a meatloaf would be a complete fail....I was wrong!!

I made this recipe exactly as stated except that I made it in a muffin pan instead of free formed loaves. It was very moist and an amazing texture! My only complaint is that the recipe lacks a bit of flavor. Next time I make it, I'll be sure to add a few spices and see how it turns out !! Overall a delicious recipe that I'll surely try again!

I am not a huge fan of meatloaf but this recipe won me over. It is also fast and simple. When I feel like adding a new taste to it (I make this recipe fairly often), I mix in some Worcestershire sauce with the meat. Definitely do what others have suggested, let the oatmeal soak for a short while in the milk/egg/salt mixture (I add the cheese just before I mix it up). Besides that, definitely one of my all time favorite recipes. My husband loves it as well, especially since the left overs are easy to pack up and take to work. He said his co-workers are jealous and it smells delicious!

I doubled up on the meat because we have a large family but, my husband loved it and so did the kids. We now have a new meat loaf recipe although I still have the urge to add an onion to the mix and will probably do that next time.

The cheese makes the meat a little greasy, I would definitely add chopped carrots and celery next time like in traditional recipes.

My husband surprised me with this for dinner tonight. I have to say it is delicious. My 2 year old grandson loved it. I wish I could share the mmmmmm and eye role he gave us when he took his first bite. I don't know that we will make our standby meatloaf again (and it's pretty good).

Since I am not a meatloaf fan in general, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and texture of this meatloaf. :) It was tasty, and I would make it again. I followed the recipe completely, and while I thought the meatloaf was a bit "wet" when I was putting it in the pan, it still baked wonderfully and my husband and I both liked how it turned out.

This is a super quick and easy dish that tastes great! We use Italian bread crumbs in place of the oats though for a little more added flavor.

This has become a major family favorite!!  My two picky kids (age 2 and 4) both gobble this up with no complaints.  I recently tried substituting ground turkey instead of beef, and I thought it was just as good, if not better.  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

I crave these all the time since I first made them! I put some sautéed onions in, and I use seasoned panko instead of oatmeal. And I leave out the mustard. So so good.

The meatloaves were OK, I really want to make them again with some additional tweaks because I do think this recipes is a great starting point! I did put them in the muffin tin as others suggested doing and added a 1/2 onion and some garlic powder to the mixture as well as let the milk/oats/egg/cheese mixture sit and absorb....they were still quite..."wet"....wonder if adding more oats to the mixture could help reduce that some. The meat tasted really good, regardless, though! The sauce was a little too sweet for my liking so I figure the next time I make it I should definitely cut the sugar or maybe skip the sauce entirely and just dump some bbq over the loaves!

I have tried several meatloaf recipes on this site and find each very similar but good.  I made this last night and my husband really liked it.  Very easy to prepare.  I did add some chopped onion and some pepper--personal preference. Instead of the mini loaves, I made one large loaf and cooked it for about 50 minutes which worked out just fine.  I did think that the glaze was a little too much and a little too sweet.

This is an awesome base recipe.  I added onion soup mix, carrot and peppers. Instead of oatmeal I used stove top stuffing that I ground up. I used my leftovers to make a meatloaf wrap. My kids all asked for seconds... even my 'vegetarian'child asked for more. Gotta love that.  :)

This is awesome! I used 4 mini-loaf pans. I put a little of the meatloaf mixture in each pan, then put a piece of string cheese in each (had to cut off about 1 inch of each of those), then put more meatloaf mixture on top. Our boys (ages 6 and 4) both agreed that this is their most favorite meal. Thank you for sharing this!

I made some changes to this because of what I had on hand, and it turned out fantastic.  I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of oats, and I added some garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper to the meat mixture.  I also added a strip of uncooked bacon on top of each meat loaf prior to adding the sauce.  I think the bacon really adds something special to this dish.

This is the best meatloaf I've had, including my mom's! Only change I made was to add some onion powder and Worcestershire sauce. I used muffin tins to bake. Absolutely delicious!

I tried this recipe and it was delish! I left out the cheeses and decided to make a traditional loaf.  Processed my oats in a food processor to make it more like a bread crumb consistency.  My family devoured this meatloaf and we now have this 2-3 times per month.

I was not a big fan of the topping, but my husband loved it. I would add little more salt and less toping, but it is a good meatloaf recipe.

My husband surprised me by making these for dinner, we hadn't had meatloaf in a while, because the kids didn't like mine.  But this recipe!  Oh, my!  Moist and delicious!  The kids all gobbled it up!  He totally showed me up, and I'm ok with that!  Now he's gonna have to make this for us on a regular basis :)

My PICKY kids LOVE these! I also used a muffin pan to make meatball cupcakes (the kids loved the name). I followed the recipe to a T but added garlic powder and onion powder. You couldn't taste the oats but they add a great texture, keep the moisture in and hold it all together. The cheese inside is a great addition too. This is now a regular recipe in our house. Did I mention... SUPER EASY to make! (my kids loved that this had no onions in it too. I didn't miss them either).

This is our family's favorite meatloaf recipe (originally seen in Taste of Home).  I usually make 1.5-2 times the original proportion of sauce because it is so good.  On the other hand, I also make a couple of the loaves without any of the ketchup mixture because some of the family does not like that -- and it is still moist and flavorful.  Definitely make more mini loaves (double or triple recipe) if your family are big eaters!  Leftovers are great cold!  PS - Never added the extra salt - and we have never missed it.

I love meatloaf, and this was no exception! Only changes were to sauté some onion, carrots, and green peppers to add to the mix. I also made in muffin tins. Even my 3 year old loved it and even asked for it the next day!

I originally found this recipe in a cook book.  Its my kids favorite hamburger recipe. Being from a big family of hunters we always use ground elk or deer which is the healthy alternative. I made the recipe as stated with no changes and love it! Thanks for putting it online!

My family and I loved this recipe.  I made it instead of a whole meat loaf since I wanted it to be done in less time.  I added some garlic and onion powder, and kicked it up to 375 for the last 15 minutes, and they all came out perfectly.  I could've eaten a lot more!

This was pretty good! It was my first time making meatloaves. Okay, well I made lots of mistakes because I was in a hurry to make lunch for my sister. I put in confectioner's sugar(didn't had brown sugar or white sugar)with the beef mixture instead of the ketchup mixture by accident. I also used shredded mozzarella (don't have cheddar cheese). I could really taste the cheese! It was amazing! I also used crushed crackers instead (don't have oats.

So I looked at this recipe and thought the meat mixture seemed really plain so I added a lot of flavorings. I added some chicken powder(from an Asian market), garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. 

As I was making this in a muffin pan, a lot of soup or watery mixture came out of the tiny muffin pots and spilled over. I don't know why if it's suppose to be like this or not, but overall I would definitely make this again!

Warning: Opening the oven and smelling this burned my nose like heck! The acidity from the ketchup was really strong!

My new favorite meatloaf recipe. I did make it in one big loaf and it was fine. I added an egg and some ground pork. Very good-I will certainly use this recipe again.

The family loved this, it solves the issue with regular meatloaf when there isn't enough glaze for each slice. This way the glaze is in every bite.

My favorite meat loaf recipe to date. I took the advice from another review and cooked them in a muffin pan. The bite size portions were easy to serve and fun to dig in!

These were AWESOME!  I am not generally a meatloaf fan, but my husband and I really had to control ourselves so we didn't eat these all at once!  I didn't have quick cooking oats so used old-fashioned oats and it still turned out fantastic!  Thank you!

This will be my new go-to meatloaf recipe. I have one or two other ones that I like, but this one achieves a comparable really yummy taste with less ingredients, all of which I normally have on hand, and is the simplest to make. Win win win!

This is delicious, especially the sauce on top, although I only needed 1/2 of the sauce.  I did not have oatmeal, so I used breadcrumbs and let the mixture sit in the fridge overnight to firm.  I also put it into a 6-muffin tin. I will definitely make this again.
These are better made with breadcrumbs and left in the fridge to sit overnight.  If using oats, definitely let it sit.

Love, love, love this! Super easy, fast, and the kids loved it too! I was honestly surprised how much I liked it. My 9 year old suggested I make it every night! I even added peppers and onions chopped to almost a puree to hide from the kids...never noticed.

I made this recipe as written but baked in a muffin tin for 40 mins (made 12 meatloafs).  The meat was super moist but a little bland.  I would probably add some herbs or spices for more flavor.  Also, all I could taste with the sauce was ketchup and I'm not a huge fan.  Will probably use a smoky or honey bbq sauce next time.  Overall, pretty good base recipe for meatloaf!

I have been making this for years and my family won't eat any other meatloaf.  I think it's the cheese that makes it so yummy!  The cupcake pan gets a little messy and will definitely need a soak after dinner!

Just amazing! My husband ate 3 of them! He's been wanting meatloaf for the longest time and I didn't want to make a full one. I came across the recipe and figured it was perfect for freezing if we had leftovers. Well, we had no leftovers! Thanks for sharing! I will be making this again in the future...apparently next week according to my husband lol.

These were really good.  I would definitely recommend and I will definitely make again. I followed the recipe except I cooked them in muffin cups, for about 45 minutes.  It was easy to throw together and they tasted great.  The sauce was very good.  It was a little on the sweet side but I love sweet so it wasn't bad for me.

Great Recipe, I added a pack of onion soup mix and added some bread crumbs with the cooking oats. I made in a muffin pan and they turned out moist and delicious!

Excellent! So simple to make. Was not too salty, soggy or greasy (i used lean meat to reduce the fat), and using the muffin pan suggested by another reviewer made the individual portion just right. to make it a little healthier for my kids, i added chopped frozen califlower to the mix.

This recipe was a huge success for dinner tonight!  In a pinch, I substituted about 1 1/4 cup of leftover Ranch style croutons for the oats (I left them in the bag and used a rolling pin to crumble them), and 2/3 cup tomato sauce for the ketchup.  I really enjoyed my own cooking tonight and I'm my own harshest critic! The bonus was my family loved it and wished there was enough for seconds! (Goodbye McCormick's Meatloaf seasoning packet...forever!)

Yummy - my kids enjoyed it, my husband liked it.  And it is not hard to make.  It has a tasty texture.  I sometimes leave out the mustard (my daughter and I don't like mustard).  I also bake them on a broiler pan instead of a baking dish.  Often I double the recipe (for 5 of us) because I want the left overs - the mini loaves reheat well.  Besides that, I followed the directions exactly.

This is my favorite meatlof recipe ever! The topping is so good and the recipe is simple and delicious as-is. You can also modify it to fit your family's tastes. Hubby loves it and the kids gobble it up! Have made this several times and is always very good.

Terrific!  Whole family loved them...even the picky ones.  There was plenty of sauce, in fact I had some leftover.  As some others mentioned, I did throw in some garlic powder, onion powder and Worchestershire sauce, but even without them, I still think they would have been pretty good. Yum!

This was a great recipe! I added black pepper, italian seasoning, bread crumbs instead of oatmeal, seasoning salt and a dash of garlic powder, worcestershire sauce and it turned out fantastic! I also added a little cheese in the mini loaves and made 4 small one's out of the mixture. Cooked perfectly on 425 for 45 minutes. I will definitely make this again!

I've made these several times now and it's become one of my favourite recipes on this website. A family favorite for sure! 
Sometimes I add some beef flavored "Better than Bouillon" to the meat mix, or other spices like minced garlic for some extra flavor. But if you use good quality ground beef it is not necessary.

Really good.  I soaked the oatmeal in the milk for 5 min before adding.  Used a little less salt and added pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  Also reduced the ketchup to 1/2 cup & brown sugar to 2 Tbsp for the sauce.  Made six meatloaves in mini bread pans.  Don't think I could have stretched it to eight.

This is an awesome recipe! So delicious and so easy to make! Definitely a keeper! My hubby and my son love it and it's not easy to find a recipe my hubby likes. I followed the recipe. Added 1/2 a finely chopped onion and garlic powder and placed them in muffin trays. We broiled the meat loaf for about 1-2 min at the end just to brown it. So yummy! Next time, I would add some of the sauce to the meat loaf mix for a try.

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe.  I love that you make the mini loaves & it cooks in a fraction of the time of the large loaf.  My husband likes that he gets topping in every bite.  I usually soak the oats in the milk for a few minutes while I get the other ingredients ready.  I also change it up to suite my mood, like adding diced veggies to the meat & salsa in place of the ketchup, or using bbq sauce on top & pepper jack cheese, etc.  You can even add some bulk sausage to the meat & do a sweet & sour type of topping.  The possibilities are endless.

Very good.  I've made these a few times and have baked them in muffin tins.  I usually at least double the recipe.  All except the topping, which seems to be enough as written for a double recipe. Once these are baked, flash freeze them and stick in a ziploc bag.  I put them on the Sara Lee slider-sized buns for my kids school lunches - killer!

Hmm...not great. WAY too much sauce on the top (I will half this next time) and the meat was really bland. I think I'll be adding some spices...but it is a great base recipe. Thanks!

Really enjoyed this for a Sunday evening dinner.  It's definitely a keeper.  I used a block of aged cheddar from Trader Joe's to grate 1 cup, and I only had old fashioned oats, so I used them in place of the instant ones, and it worked just fine.  I did add 1 Tablespoon of dried minced onion and about 3/4 teaspoon of crystallized garlic.  Kept everything else the same and absolutely love this!

Really good. My husband said this is a keeper after 2 bites. I added about a tsp of dried, minced onion and a dash of garlic powder. I used a mini loaf pan to bake them and they turned out great.

Love this recipe.  I don't add the sauce until the meatloaf is almost done.  I prefer to get rid of some of the fat before I add the sauce.  After I have drained it I only put a little of the sauce on top and finish cooking.  I also double the sauce recipe and put it on the side.  This recipe also works well with ground chicken.

It is very rare that the entire family will like a particular dish but this one was a win -win for the Smith family. I decided to make this in muffin pans so that I could tweak the kids from the parents. I added chopped onion and Worcestershire Sauce to the parent pan. So yummy and I dont even like meatloaf. When you make in muffin pan cook at the same temp but at the end crank up the heat until they sizzle around the edges - also use all of the sauce  - I threw away some of it because I thought it was too much but dont  - just put it all on there. You could do so many things with these - great recipe!

This is my to go to meatloaf recipe! I prefer meatloaf with the ketchup/ brown sugar topping to brown gravy. These mini meatloaves ensure that I get a whole lot of that delicious topping! At times when I have eaten meatloaf in the past, the grease would cause the meatloaf to get soggy and crumble at the bottom, this doesn't occur with these individual loaves. These loaves are very easy to make and I usually have all of the ingredients on hand. I do however, add onion to my meatloaves, and a dash of garlic salt just for a little bit more flavor. I usually make these for just my boyfriend and myself, and there's the perfect amount for dinner and leftovers!! Tastes great reheated the next day!

Yum!  I followed exactly but then added some onion soup mix (just enough to season -maybe 1/5 a pkt?) to half the meat mixture to see which we liked better - it was close but the onion side won!  With that, it is 5 stars.  Will definitely make again.

My kids raved about how great this meatloaf is. I didn't make mini loaves, but spread it out in a rectangular pan instead with no problems or change in cooking time. I'll definitely be making this again.

These are tasty, moist, tender and best of all they cook quickly and because you cook them on a baking sheet they don't sit in their own grease!  I used regular rolled oats and they turned out fine.

I havent made or had meatloaf in years. I added some sauteed onions to the mix before baking. Used a muffin tin for the same amount of time. Me and my family LOVED this recipe! So easy and soooo delicious!

Super!  Added a little chopped onion to the meat mixture.  I did not cook them in the oven because it's so hot here.  I made the little loaves, then browned one side in a med-high heat skillet.  Turn the loaves and cover with sauce.  Turned heat down to med and cooked, covered for about 20 minutes.  Yummy.

Best meatloaf that finally won my husband's taste!! He told me it tastes exactly like his Mom's which I had tried numerous recipes so this is a keeper!  I decided to use ground turkey which is almost 1.5 lbs plus 1/4 lb of ground beef and used quick cooking steel cut oats so i doubled the recipe as I followed the reviewers recommendations to soak the oat mixed with milk and egg for 15 minutes and I didn't have fresh onions so I used dried chopped onions and garlic powder and garlic salt..as for ketchup sugar topping, I used onion powder in place of mustard as the other reviewer suggested and I used bbq sauce which my husband likes on half side and homemade ketcup sauce on other side so I let it baked for at least an hr so it won my husband's taste!!!

Good recipe! Kids are more likely to enjoy any dish that is "mini" or their size. :) Made the recipe as printed the first time and my family liked it. The second time I substituted cracker crumbs (crackers that I crushed) in place of oats. I HIGHLEY recommend this change! Try any of the neat flavors of cracksers on the market these days....our favorite in this dish is a whole wheat sesame basil cracker!:)

Soooo delicious. My boyfriend said he didn't like meatloaf before this recipe! The only thing I added was some garlic powder and onions, just out of personal preference, but I'm sure it would have been delicious even without them!

Magnificent and delicious! I doubled this recipe to 16 servings (for those wondering-900g ground beef & approx 250g block of cheddar cheese shredded). Made 12 muffins (for dinner) and about 15 as patty-sized to serve as sides for a party! I made the 12 muffins the same day and put the patty-sized ones in the freezer to bake prior to the party. ADDITIONS: 2 finely minced red onions and 3 cloves garlic finely minced (both sauteed before addition to the milk-cheese mixture), after that I added the oats & salt and took the suggestion of one reviewer and allowed it to sit for a bit so that the oats would soak up some of the milk and make it less liquidy. The sauce was perfect although I did skip the mustard. I baked as instructed for 45 minutes @ 175 degrees and the aromas were heavenly! Would I make this again? Yes yes yes and then a few million times more! And I will make these both as muffins and as patty-wannabes! =D Thanks Tonya! UPDATE 18/06/2011 :: I kept the recipe to 8 servings (450 grams of ground beef and 125 g block of cheddar cheese). This time I also added 1/4-1/2 bunch chopped mintleaves and 1 tsp garam masala (found in the asian aisle), and I decided to go with 2 onions minced and 3 cloves garlic minced (both sauted in the garam masala and then cooled) for this quantity as well.I made these into patties and baked them for about 35 minutes@175 degrees. They were LOVED by ALL and everybody asked for the recipe too! I think I'll make both versions of this always! :)

This was my first time using the oven all by myself. I decided to make these mini meatloaves. There is only two things I could complain about:

1. The ketchup topping was a bit too sweet for me.
2. It's fairly high in calories and fat.

But overall, this dish is very tasty! They turned out nice. I'm very proud of myself. I give it a 3 and 1/2 stars.

This is absolutely THE best meatloaf EVER! Only change I made: I added about 1-2 t Marjoram and 1-2 t Basil, and replaced salt for garlic salt and one extra egg. The first time I made it I did the mini loaves, but now I just make one large loaf in my PS stone casserole pan. Me & my boyfriend LOVE this and could eat it VERY often. THANK YOU!

These were good. Didn't end up using the milk because I added A-1 steak marinade and some steak sauce for seasoning and I didn't add any salt. Otherwise followed the recipe will definitely make again. May be the first time i ever enjoyed meatloaf lol

without a doubt the best meatloaf i've ever made/eaten I used ground turkey instead of beef and made in muffin pan as suggested below. I have even made them as appetizers for a party in a mini muffin pan! What a hit thanks for the recipe!

These are too sweet for me personally, but I am giving them 5 stars because my husband and my two boys are in LOVE with these things.  For that alone it gets 5 stars from me.  Also, we use sausage instead of hamburger which gives it a little extra something....

these were delicious!  I added some dried onions and pepper (and let it sit for about 10 mix after mixing together all the ingredients) but otherwise followed the recipe.  The only problem was the portion size, I doubled the recipe but it barely fed 10 normal people!

I rated this 5 because my kids, husband, and I devour this meatloaf. I cut the cheese in half and it is still great. I add some onion and garlic powder and a dash of Worcestershire to add some zip. The topping is pretty sweet but it is good.

My new meatloaf recipe!! This is so easy with very few ingredients but the end result is very flavorful- love the topping.  I like the mini meatloaves as they seem easier to get cooked properly than a large loaf plus the individual servings are great for kids.

This was really good. The oatmeal was a little weird but it was all gone. I think I am still going to stick to bread crumbs though. I added crushed red pepper for spice which made it really good too.

These were pretty good ... I did use a large muffin pan like others had, since I didn't have a mini loaf pan. My loaves turned out pretty greasy, but maybe it was just the hamburger I used? I let the oats soak and only put cheese in half of the meat mixture. I do think that next time I will use Ritz crackers instead of oats, as I make a lot of cookies using oats, and the taste/texture reminded me of the cookies.

This was a huge hit at my house. I put them in the muffin tins and they were so tasty! I think that the sauce seeped into these better than making a loaf which gave them a better flavor. I used 1lb ground turkey and 1lb ground pork because that is what I had in the freezer. I also used some saltines to hold it together better. This is a keeper!

I saw this recipe in a magazine almost 10 years ago and it's been a favorite ever since.  The only difference is that the version in the mag had onions (can't imagine eating it without).  I've never used a full 3/4 c. milk (1/3?) and usually use more ground beef without having to make adjustments to other ingreds.  People who say they don't like meatloaf always rave about this one.

Another take on the all-american meatloaf. I use oats in my version, but I'm not sure how I like the cheese. It definitely makes the meat juicier. Not bad!

NEVER, have I had people rave over meatloaf before, but they did! I mean, Mmmm's and Ahhhs! Oh so good! I did like the others and added some onion and a little Worcestershire sauce. I too used the muffin pan but understand this ends up like meatballs. I suggest you double the recipe. 4 people and one 2 yr old is barely enough. NO leftovers. I will double next time for sure!

These were delicious and really straightforward.  My husband doesn't even like meatloaf and he really enjoyed this.  I toned down the cheese since he is lactose-intolerant, and I also added an onion, some worcestershire, and garlic powder.  Yum!

This was great!  My son who "hates" meatloaf ate two.  I added a little bit of minced onion to the mix.  I used a jumbo (6 count) muffin tin and they cooked perfectly in the time alloted.

Brilliant. i followed the recipe perfectly and it turned out awesome. the only thing i changed was putting it into a bread pan rather than shaping mini meatloaves because i'm just lazy.  i've made meatloaf before, but this was the juiciest i've ever tasted and the whole family loved it, even my in laws. A keeper, particularly when red meat cravings happen!

Great recipe. I used 1/2 lb ground italian seasoned turkey to try to make it a little healthy. The flavor was wonderful my husband and son loved it. A good thing about the recipe is that all of the ingredients I always have them on hand.

Delicious! I made this for the first time last night and the whole family loved it. My 2 year old daughter, who is very picky, even at it. And, my husband who initially complained about the sauce devoured it and requested some in his lunch. I didn't have brown sugar so I added a few table spoons of regular sugar. I also added a dash of garlic salt, some Wosh sauce, and a finely chopped sauteed onion. This tops my old recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely delicious! We followed the recipe exactly but we accidentally over cooked it and it still came out nice and juicy! It really doesn't need quite as much brown sugar, maybe 1/8 cup instead but it was awesome!

I thought these were good, but nothing to write home about.  The sauce was much too sweet for me. I would make again if these were requested, but I don't think that will happen. Thanks though.

This is a great base for a meatloaf. You can add different spices to suit your family.  I made it as stated except our beef comes in pound & 1/2 so I used more meat.  Next time I will add onions and some other spices but the texture/consistency was PERFECT!  It had a great flavor, exactly what I have been looking for!  I made it in mini loaves & cooked the same temp & length.  The sauce was a bit sweet for mine & my husbands taste but my kids gobbled it up.  I will definitely be making this again!  I plan to make a batch to freeze for a quick lunch or even supper.  Thanks!!!

Very good! I will definitely make this again. It was so simple to make and tasted delicious. Like some others said, the sause on top is sweet, but adds a lot of flavor and would not be the same without it! From other suggestions, I put in a little bit of chopped onion and baked in a muffin pan. Next time I am also going to add some green pepper. Thanks for sharing this!

THIS WAS AMAZING! I believe it isn't meatloaf with out a bell pepper and onion, so I added one pepper and 1/4 of a sweet onion. I also doubled the sauce, because I really like it. I substituted whole wheat saltines for the oatmeal. I made six instead of eight. I was really proud because my granny who is a great cook cannot make meatloaf. She was so impressed! Everyone loved it! People raved and raved!! I making it again tomorrow for my mom's side of the family. Served with smashed potatoes and fresh corn!

The meatloaves themselves were very tasty. But next time I will put tomato sauce on top or brown gravy. The sauce that you make in the recipe was to sweet for us. I will be making this recipe again but using the sauce instead.

I made these in the muffin pan as suggested.  I LOVE this and will only make my meatloaf like this in the future.  I also added some finely diced onion and used 3 Tblsp powdered milk and 3/4 cup water instead of the milk because I was out.  I shortened the cooking time to 35 minutes. YUMMY!

This was a very easy and quick dinner and this idea of making individual meatloaves was perfect for my on the go family.  Will be making this often in the future.

I had to cook it a bit longer (you know how it goes sometimes...) as I have a screaming baby. ;) But it still came out moist and delish! Even the leftovers where superb.

Thank you for the best meatloaf recipe ever!  I will use this one from now on.  I didn't have the problems of the other reviewers of the mixture being too wet- I probably added more meat than the recipe called for since I used the remainer of the package I had on hand.  Don't worry about the oatmeal sounding "strange"...you don't taste it at all and it is an excellent binder.  4/4 people in my household absolutely loved this recipe.  FYI:  I didn't make the mini meatloaf like the recipe called for.  I formed one large mound and placed in the middle of a jelly roll pan to allow for grease run-off and it worked wonderfully.  Again, thanks for the permanent addition to my recipe box!

I thought these were delicious!  They were so easy too.  I made them in a muffin pan with ground turkey instead of ground beef for a healthier meal, and it was great.  I added chopped onion like others.  I also ran out of ketchup so I did 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce- yum!  Next time I'll either add less milk or more oats because it wasn't as firm as I like, but it was still good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made these for dinner last evening.  My husband and I loved them.  The only thing I did different is I added chopped onion to them.  Will be making them again often.

Satisfying, quick, and easy recipe. I actually just made it tonight, with no alterations. Next time, however, I'm DEFINITELY adding an onion. This meatloaf needs that little bit of "onion oomph" to go along with the sweet sauce.   Serving-wise, it would be safe to figure 2 loafs per person (3-4 loafs for that hungry man in your life). In addition to the side dish, I ate 2 loafs and my dad ate 3.

Yum, yum, yum! This was a triple E rating: Easy, Economical, and Excellent! I added half a chopped onion to the mixture. I did not have prepared mustard on hand, so I substituted 3 tsps. of yellow mustard. The prepared is probably better; however, in a pinch the bottled mustard will do. I'm ashamed to admit that it's been so long since I've made a meatloaf (due to recipe failure), that my 7-year-old had never tasted one before. We all loved it. Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans rounded out this meal to make a classic dinner. Definitely a keeper! Happy Cooking! :o)

I made these exactly as the recipe states except I added about 1/4 c. chopped onions and put them into the muffin tins as suggested in an earlier review.  The muffin tins make them so easy to serve. My family loved them.  It's the best meatloaf I have ever made.  The mustard/ketchup/brown sugar topping really sets it apart from the usual meatloaf.

I followed the recipe as written, and as one other member suggested, I used my mini-loaf pan (I have a silicon one that makes six mini loaves, and it was just the right size).  Because one of my daughters does not like ANYTHING involving ketchup or sauce, I left one loaf with no topping, and it came out fine.  As others mentioned, this was quite moist - I enjoyed the texture, but my husband called it "slimy" and says he would much prefer my regular meatloaf.  This also had a little less flavor, and if I were making it again, I'd definitely add additional seasoning - perhaps rosemary and thyme?  And worcestershire sauce?  I do normally use ketchup as the topping on my meatloaf, but I also add about 1/4 cup to the meat before it's cooked - I think that would add a bit more flavor also.  Overall, this was what it claimed to be and was pretty good, but my family didn't like it enough to encourage me to make it again.  So my printout will not join our recipe file.

Good texture to this meat loaf.  Used Japanese style breadcrumbs instead of oatmeal (none on hand) and added minced sauteed onion. To spice it up also added 1/2 can of Manwich instead of katsup, then used the other half as topping. Check the loaves at 30 min, mine were done. This is my go-to meat loaf recipe now.

These are the best meatloaves!  I have been making them for my family for years, and I don't even consider trying a different recipe.  I have made with a variety of meats (turkey, sausage, beef or combos of two) and have never been disappointed.  I do add chopped onion, which is a must for my tastes.

These mini loaves are wonderful and I've been making them for over 10 years.  The recipe originally appeared in the Collector's Edition of Taste of Home.  I only make six from this recipe .. there's not enough for eight but I keep the same baking time.

I found this recipe about 5 years ago, and it is the ONLY meatloaf recipe I use now. They are super easy to make, the portions are already divided for lunches, and, most importantly, my twin girls eat it!

These were EXCELLENT.. I didn't have the oats, so i used half bread crumbs, and half saltine crackers. I also added mozzarela, onions, and red peppers. This made about 4 good sized, and 3 mini-mini sized..Thanks for the recipe!!!! No LEFTOVERS.

I love this recipe.  You never have a clue that cheddar cheese and oatmeal is in the meatloaf.  The end result it moist and delicous.  Plus, the glaze over top is awesome, just the right amount of sweet.  The added fiber from the oatmeal is a nice addition as well.  I like to prepare mine in my cast iron skillet in the oven.

My family loved these mini meatloaves.  Per their request, I make extra sauce to top them off.  I soak the oatmeal in the milk before adding the meat and also add a sauteed onion. I prefer the fattier 75% hamburg.   There will be more fat rendered, but I think it is more flavorful. I've made them both in large muffin tins and also in mini loaf pans.  I, by far, prefer the shape of the mini loaf pans.

Started this recipe and noticed that it only had salt for the seasonings. So I added my own basic seasonings like Onion powder, garlic powder and pepper. I didn't have mustard, so I used dried mustard seasoning with Tomato sause instead of Ketchup with a tablespoon brown sugar. cooked them in a cupcake pan (made 12 servings) turned out great. I would cut down on the milk in this recipe, it was to runny.

I changed somethings, like adding pizza sauce and not as much milk.  It was too soft for my liking, but I am  not a meatloaf fan.  Most of the family liked it.  But they weren't raving.

Like others I made only minor adjustments.  I added 1/2 lb. of ground veal and one small onion, chopped. I experimented by trying to put some of the mix into large Pop-Over pans and the rest in small 3.5"x6" loaf pans.  In both cases I put them on cookie sheets to catch the grease and poured off the excess grease 10 minutes prior to finish.  The taste is excellent, but I can understand why the original recipe doesn't call for pans at all.  There's alot of grease.  For two people the small loaf pan size is perfect.  I wouldn't do the pop-over pan again, too small and too much grease.

I'm giving this a three because although I really liked it my husband and his grandfather did not. I followed someone else's suggestion and added a little garlic powder. I think the guys would have liked it if it had onions and other stuff in it. They wouldn't even touch the leftovers.

By far the best meatloaf I have ever made or tasted.  I let the oats soak in the milk for about 15 minutes, and added diced onion and a dash of garlic powder.  Supereasy and amazingly delicious.  Will make this again and again. Great leftovers, too!

Mr. CP and the boys went crazy over this.  The flavor and texture were very nice.  You'd never guess it has oatmeal in it!

really yummy!  i, too, used the muffin pan method and my kids both loved that they had their own individual "loaves“? i doubled the recipe and then added one carrot and one zucchini (both finely shredded), two stalks of celery and one green bell pepper (both finely chopped), and one chopped onion.  besides the onion, we barely even noticed the other veggies at all.  (nice to get some veggies in there for the kids!)    loved the ketchup/brown sugar/mustard glaze!  next time, i might make some extra of this to set aside and serve with the meatloaf.

This was very easy to make and my kids and I thought it was really good. It really didn't taste like meatloaf, it tasted more like salsbury steak. I will definately make it again, as the mini portions were perfect. They were actually bigger than I thought they would be, which was great because they are only about 250 calories each!

Can you say YUMM-MAY!  I've made this recipe several times since I had first spotted it in 2008 and have gotten several compliments, usually I’m cooking for just 2 people so i cut the recipe in half, sometimes increasing the cheese and adding brown sugar (about 1/3 cup brown sugar) to the ketchup, mix well and spread on top of loaf to create a sweet glaze. -delicious

My whole family loves this meatloaf.  I do add chopped onions and peppers and because we are hunters at our house, it is usually made with venison.

These are delicious. I only made one minor change - I didn't have quick oats so I used the regular (old fashioned) kind. I thought the 8 mini meatloaves were too tiny when I formed them. I reformed them to make 4 and they were better. Yes you could eat more of them, but I was concerned about them drying out because they were so little. Next time I will 1.5 this recipe and make 4 for 4 adults.

I gave this four stars because of the modifications used to make this more flavorful. First of all, I added onion, garlic, and green pepper. I can see leaving out the green pepper or garlic, but the onion provides a lot of flavor that I think is important to any meatloaf. It also added texture. I ended up adding more oatmeal because the mixture was too wet, even after letting the oats absorb some of the milk, egg, etc. I formed into four loaves and topped with half the sauce. Next time, I will make half the sauce and use a lot less sugar. I found the sauce to be way too sweet for my tastes.

My family loved this meatloaf.  A few changes...I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I added a little garlic powder and oregano.  I also made into one loaf just to make it easier.  My pickiest 3yr old gobbled this up.  I will make this again and again.

This was good.  I followed the recipe except I added one clove of garlic.  I also only made 6 mini loaves.  With the same cooking time. I thought making 6 was a perfect single serving size.  The only thing I would change next time (because there will be a next time) is to add more cheese, and chopped onion.

Fabulous!!! "I loved them...remember how I was eating them up?"  This is from my very picky five year old.  My husband, who is not a meatloaf eater, loved them.  We used muffin tins and I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. of onion powder.  This is it!  I've found our family "meat muffin" recipe.  Thanks sooooo much for sharing.

This was fantastic. I did the muffiin pan trick. My meatloaves were super moist. I followed the meatloaf recipe exactly. On the sauce/topping I used spicy brown mustard instead of regular which gave it a nice hint of a kick and a little mayo to make it even more creamy. I used extra lean ground beef and still had a  problem with grease. I suggest using a cookie cutter cut out a small piece of bread to put on the bottom of the muffin pan to absorb the grease. It took 2 regular size meatloaf muffins per person more if you have big eaters. Next time I will use the jumbo size muffin pan.

First time making meatloaf. Made just like the recipe said except added finely chopped onion and drained all the grease out about 10 minutes before it was finished. Turned out moist, cheesy and wonderful! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was an excellent recipe.  I don't even like meatloaf!  The only changes I made was to use a beef/veal/pork mixture instead of ground beef and used bread crumbs instead of oats (I didn't have them).  YUM!

All family members LOVED IT. I followed the instructions exactly, except used muffin pan as others suggested. Turned out great. As some other reviewers wrote -- the texture was fantastic. I was a bit hesitant b/c I didn't know how the flavor of all that cheese would work, but honestly, couldn't even taste it! Just gave it great texture, along with the oats, that is. Next time I think I might season up the meat a bit more to my liking...some onion powder, pepper, season salt maybe... and add a few dashes of worstcheshire and tabasco ot the sauce. But overall -  it was excellent!

These are delicious! Made them in the muffin tins as suggested by other reviewers. Turned out perfectly moist and yummy! I ran out of ketchup so I had to use part tomato sauce and they still turned out great.  Definetly will be making these again! Thanks!

We loved this!! I added onion, tons of spices and used a muffin pan which was perfect so that I could leave the sugar topping off of mine. I did use the topping on my husbands muffins, but I cut way back on the brown sugar and he said it was still perfectly sweet. Thanks for a great recipe! We will be using this in our regular rotation.

These were good.  I liked the size of the meatloaves but there was a lot of grease on the bottom of the pan.  (Line with foil paper for easier cleanup.)  My hubby doesn't like the sauce so I only put it on half.  To me they were a little bland without the sauce but I really liked it with the sauce.

this is a great recipe. i substituted ground beef with a meatless ground beef substitute and my boyfriend said it tasted very meaty for being a "vegetarian" meatloaf. i also added some cumin and chili pepper to give the sauce some extra "oomph." I'm going to make this for Thanksgiving so I have a meatless option at the table this year!

I added some onions (we love onions in our meatloaf).  Next time I will cut back a little on the brown sugar.  A little too sweet for me.  Hubby loved it!  This one is a keeper.

These are a favorite of mine.  I've been making them for years.  The only thing I do differently is add chopped onion.  Great recipe!

I made these again tonight and they are sooo good... I did wait until the last 20 minutes to add the ketchup sauce so I could drain the fat off first... I also used steel cut oats and loved the nutty texture it added!  :)

I tried this the other night and really enjoyed it. I added garlic and also mixed some italian sausage with the ground beef. The glaze had a great flavor.

I had put off making these little meatloaves because I am so satisfied with another meatloaf recipe from AR. Surprise! These are great too.  The oats and the cheese just melt into the loaf adding just the right amount of flavour and texture. This would be a fabulous dinner for kids who love to get their own portion. No onions to worry about either. All in all a great recipe.

This recipe was great!  I didn't have any oats, so I just used Italian bread crumbs, but would like to try it with the oats the next time to see which way I prefer.  I cooked it in the muffin tin, but will try it in a 9x13 next time because the sauce mixture bubbled over and caused it to burn some.  Anyways - overall a GREAT recipe!  My family loved it!

Mmmmm first meatloaf in over a year!! I made 8 balls and put them in a muffin tin. Only took 25 min. to cook! I used saltine crackers instead of the oats.

This recipe is the best meatloaf I have ever had! It is delicious and the recipe is very easy to follow. I did add 1 onion to the recipe (in my opinion meatloaf needs onion). I will me making this again.

These were GREAT!!  My husband said "from now on, let's use this recipe for meatloaf"!!  I cooked at 350 for 1 hour rather than the 45 minutes, but it could've been the pan I used.  Delicious!

These were surprisingly great!! I was worried that such a simple recipe for meat loaf would taste okay without onions, garlic and other flavors.  My worries quickly disappeared with my first bite.  It was hard to only eat one.  My kids begged for me to make again and even my picky eater admitted that she liked them too.  Certainly a keeper!

DO NOT USE CUPCAKE PAN  I will make again but next time I will make in a baking dish. I used the cupcake pan and even put a baking dish under... It did not work well, my oven was set on fire. If this happens to anyone else close the oven and it will burn out. Just thought I would pass advice. Good recipe fault was thinking I was smart LOL

This meatloaf is great!!! This recipe would be fine the way it is, but I used old cheddar (a little more than what was called for!) and less salt.  I also used bread crumbs because I had no oats.  I added a dash of italian seasoning, black pepper, and some garlic. If I'd had an onion I would have thrown that in too! I used a measuring cup to shape them.

The sauce was really good.  iadded some spicy mustard and some worshire to it as well.  I felt the meat itself was a bit bland.  next time I would add some diced onion or an onion packet to it to give some flavor.

I only had ground turkey on hand so it was kind of bland, however I enjoyed that they were already portioned, and I believe it will be even better with ground beef next time

I really enjoyed these, but I'm giving it 4 stars because of several adjustments I made.  I added italian seasoning, chopped onions, and garlic salt (and omitted the regular salt).  I think they would be pretty bland without these seasonings.  The texture was great - I didn't taste oats and didn't really notice the cheese, but it all blended well.  I reduced the sugar just a bit, but still found the topping to be a little too sweet.  I used a jumbo muffin tin and it made 6 - they were the perfect single serving size, and great for leftovers.

BEST meatloaf I have ever had or made. Super moist. I soaked my oats in the milk, added chopped onion and garlic, and used a regular size muffin tin as others had suggested. The sauce was awesome! I will make this over and over again.

I tried this and we liked it very much. It was easy and fast. I burnt the ribs we had for dinner. I jumped on "All Recipes" and came across this and threw it together. I will make it again. From now on it goes as standard fair.

What a wonderful recipe! I was skeptical because of the oats and cheese, but it turned out really tasty. Only three changes I think are essential: add a chopped onion and two cloves minced garlic, and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce for good measure. And as a side note, this recipe works really well with ground pork instead of ground beef. Yum!

This was so good!  I added an onion and baked them in muffin cups as others had suggested.  So good!  The topping is the added touch, though a bit sweet for my taste, so I'll cut back on the sugar a bit next time.  My husband really liked these and he's not a real meatloaf fan.  I will definitely make these again!

I used mozarella instead of cheddar, and added 1 cup of finely cut onions and grated carrots.  

The muffin pan is very practical for this recipe.

These were a good starting point.  I like the use of oatmeal in them.  But they were pretty bland, so need some more seasoning.  And the sause was *way* too sweet; I definitely will use just ketchup or a little more savory mix next time.

Very easy and good. My kids are not meatloaf fans, and they ate more of this than any other recipe I've tried!

This is a big hit with my family.  I always have to double the recipe to  have leftovers for my sons the next day.  My oldest likes to reheat for breakfast!  If you're not a fan of meatloaf, this recipe could make you change your mind!

Though I was hesitant to make this dish at first since I'm vegetarian and have never made meatloaf, I am glad I did, because this recipe was amazing! My husband has decided this is his new favorite dish :)  Since I'm a vegetarian, I made it with the Morningstar griller crumbles, which worked fine in this recipe.  I took some of the suggestions from other members and added some sauteed onion and garlic, which was really good as well :)  Also, I made mine in muffin pans as well, which make the perfect sizes!  The topping for it was great, we loved how sweet it was, and it was just the right amount for our loaves.  Thanks for this great recipe, I will definitely be making this again!

This made for a yummy and quick dinner. We ate these with crash hot potatoes (mmm...comfort food!) I took someone's suggestion and let the oatmeal soak up the wet ing. before mixing everything together. I used ground turkey instead of beef and next time I will use A1 sauce instead of ketchup for the topping, just personal preference. I also baked them in a muffin pan.

Very good!  Even my pickiest eater ate these.  I used breadcrumbs instead of oatmeal and used about half of the cheese (to cut down on fat). I also cut down on the brown sugar as some others suggested.  This has been put into rotation.

I really liked this recipe. Gave it 4 stars because the topping was a little sweet to me so I will cut back on the sugar next time but other than really good and easy. I used a muffin pan and it turned out great.

This recipe is so good and has gotten so many great reviews, it doesn't really need another!! Mini meatloaves have been a staple in my monthly rotation (especially in winter) since 2004! It does need a little extra zip, so I sautee a chopped onion and a couple of garlic cloves and add to the beef mixture.

I liked this but think it definitely needs onion, and I would also reduce the amount of sauce - felt it was way too sweet.  With those changes, it's a definite keeper!

The sauce on top was delicious. I used ground turkey instead of beef (much healthier). I think I will use a drip pan next time because the meatloaves were drowning a bit in a lot of liquid when I baked it in the regular 9x13.

We love these!  And they're so good in sandwiches the next day!  I do add some onion for extra flavor - the kids freak out if they can identify pieces of onion, so I make sure it's very finely minced.  I also make these in big batches and freeze individual mini loaves without the sauce.  On busy week nights I can just throw the sauce together and pop them into the oven.  I usually don't even have time to thaw so I just bake the frozen loaves a little longer than the recipe calls for.

My family loved this recipe.  I made it for the first time last night.  I did not make any alterations to the recipe at all.  I have made made meatloaf many times, but I've never used oats, cheese or milk in mine.  I don't think I will make it another way ever again.  I would love to add onions, but my daughter doesn't like them.  I even made them a night ahead and kept pan in the fridge until ready to bake.  This is going to be in our weekly rotation of favorites.  Thanks!!

My family loves the mini meatloaves! Even my very picky teenager. My husband and son prefer it without the glaze on top, so with the mini loaves it is easy to make some with and some without. I too was skeptical about the oatmeal and cheese in the meatloaf, but it is so good! Have made twice so far, wonderful each time.

I am eating this as I type, and I love it!  The boy also loves it.  I'm glad I decided to do this instead of making hamburger steak as originally planned.  

I followed the recipe exactly, and I don't find it bland at all - the topping doesn't need competition.  Very nice!

We love these mini-meatloaves! I make them at least twice a month! I've even used ground turkey instead of hamburger, but add some steak seasonings (to taste) and dash of liquid smoke to the ground turkey.

Very disappointed. Followed the directions exactly and added a little onion and green pepper. Did not hold together well..maybe needed more oatmeal or breadcrumbs. Also needed more spices of somekind ..needed something it was blah to say the least. My family paid $30 not to eat it..sorry..   :(

Very good base meatloaf recipe. I add a chopped onion and use bbq sauce instead of ketchup. Also substituted panko breadcrumbs for quick oats. I bake these on a rack on a cookie sheet and it drains the grease nicely. Husband and I eat them on buns at least once a week.

This recipe was fantastic.  I used "meatloaf mix" instead of ground beef.  I also made them in muffin tins.  Only suggestion... if you make them in muffin tins, put some of the topping in the muffin tins before you put the beef mixture in and then top it.  Yummie!

My family loved this recipe. The only request was to not coat some of them with the ketchup mixture. Some felt it was alittle sweet. Next time I will cut the brown sugar in half. I also added garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and a tsp of worcestershire sauce. They were great, especially heated up the next day. I also doubled the recipe for the meatloaf, not the topping. It made 8 mini loaves, the perfect size for one person.

I was skeptical about using the quick cooking oats, but it turned out great.  You can't even tell the oats are in the meatloaves once they are cooked.  I added a bit of garlic salt and some diced onion.  Cooked in a muffin pan.  Perfect with mashed potatoes and peas or green beans.  Had enough leftover for one lunch the next day.

This was great! I added onions, green peppers, roasted red sweet peppers, garlic powder and beef onion soup mix.  Delicious! Loved the mixture on top.

This is a good basic meatloaf recipe as served up in a school cafeteria, but just way too bland for us, plus we couldnt even taste the cheese!However,the consistency was good.I'm just so sorry I doubled the recipe. As others have said...a meatloaf w/out onions?...what was I thinking?

I used turkey instead of beef but theses still turned out great.  The sauce on top was a little sweet, almost like a BBQ sauce.  I thought it was good but if that's not your cup of tea maybe use less brown sugar.  Delish, I will definitely make it again.

I received this recipe via the daily recipe e-mail.  I mis-judged the loaves, and ended up with only six, so I had to cook a little longer.  Very tasty.  This will definitely be part of our regular menu.

My husband does not normally like meatloaf, however this recipe he loves!  He says his favorite part of a meatloaf is the crust (sides) so with mini meatloaves you get all four of them!  I really like it too! Thanks for this one!

The sauce on these is great, but the meatloaves themselves are way too bland and the cooking time is too long.  I probably wouldn't make them again, but I would use the sauce recipe on a different meat loaf!

Very good. I forgot the cheese and it was still good.(How I forgot the cheese is anybody's guess.) I did add a little nutmeg to the topping, and substituted seasoned croutons for the oatmeal. I made them in muffin tins.

Thank you to the other reviewers that suggested the muffin pan, it worked perfectly.  My mixture was a little too runny for me so I added some breadcrumbs to it as well as chopped onion and thought they were delicious.  I cant wait to make them again!!

I made these in muffin tins and my daughter ate half of one.  This is MAJOR as she hasn't eaten any meat except chicken nuggets for over a year.  Seriously! I ground up the oats before adding to the mix, added onion powder and steak seasoning, and combined the tiny amount of ketchup and mustard I had on hand for the glaze. Perfect!

I love this recipe, I use it all the time, it's great when you want to make a nice meal for visitors.  The only thing I do different is add Lipton Onion Soup Mix  I add a whole package to the meat mixture.  It just peps it up a bit more.

Very easy and great flavor. We all loved it. I did a 50/50 mix of ground turkey and hamburger and used Parmesan flavored goldfish crackers instead of oats. Great as sandwiches the next day, too.

These are very good!  I typically find meatloaf made with lean ground beef too dry and meatloaf made with fattier beef too greasy.  I love this recipe because you can use lean ground beef and add your own flavorful, non-greasy fat (the cheese) to make it more flavorful and moist.  I'm not saying it's healthy, but these are really good.  The mini loaves are great so that you can proportion how you want and everyone gets more of the crunchy outside and yummy sauce.

GREAT meatloaf recipe!  Not normally a fan but I needed a comfort type food that evening.  Used ground turkey instead of beef to lighten it up and used 1/4 cup chopped onion in it as well.  It was a hit with me and the family - definitely making again!

Yum Yum!  Followed recipe exactly except I made into 4 minis instead of 8.  They seemed too tiny that way. I was a little concerned with how squishy they were after mixing everything together, but they came out juicy, tender and delish. Baking time was perfect and they smelled wonderful!  Served with roasted potatoes from this site and peas.

I make just one regular meatloaf using this recipe.  Use a meat thermometer to make sure it's ready when you are.  Internal temp should be 160 for ground beef.  The sauce is delicious!  I usually make a little extra  for under the meatloaf in the pan.

Really good! I had almost a pound & a half of ground meat. I also didn't have quick cooking oats (used regular) but I don't think it makes a difference. I cooked it in a 11X7 so that the sauce would not go all over the place. With the 1 1/2 pound of meat I made 8 perfectly sized mini meatloaves. Thanks!

The meat mixture is the best I've found, however, I like to use the sauce from the Brown Sugar Meatloaf recipe, which is basically just Ketchup & brown sugar in equal parts...and LOTS of it so you have some for the mashed potato's that HAVE to be made with this.

The meatloaves were good but the topping was a tad sweet for our tastes. Next time I would reduce the brown sugar to about 2 tablespoons.  I also added a 1/2 a packet of sifted onion lipton soup mix (bascially u just add the twiggy parts and a pinch of the powder) to the meat mixture as well as garlic powder.  I did not have oats so I used crushed Ritz crackers instead.  1 pound of ground beef made 2 mini loaves for me (I used the disposable mini aluminum mini loaves and it made clean up so easy.)

I've never made meatloaf before and I've only eaten it once so wasn't sure what to expect. I added garlic and onion to the mix and reduced the amount of brown sugar and added a dash of worcester sauce to the sauce. I followed some friends advice and baked them in muffin tins. My husband really enjoyed this, I liked it and even my picky daughter ate one without too much complaint. It might have been my first time making meatloaf but if hubby has his way it won't be my last. Thankyou.

Wonderful recipe! I made it with 1 1/4 lbs. of ground turkey and added 1/2 c. chopped onion and 4 cloves minced garlic for added flavor. I only made half the recipe for the glaze on top and left the mustard out. (My family doesn't like too much sauce on things.) I cooked it for 10 minutes extra since I put in more meat. The mini loaves came out moist and tasty!

Very tasty, moist, and very simple to make. Clean up was a breeze. The sauce was sweet and tangy. My husband loved this. I served it with peas and tater tots. Delicious! I will be making this again.

Instead of adding shredded cheese I add a bag of cheese crumbles instead.  Then there are tiny little bites of cheese in every bite almost!

Very tasty. Husband loved it. I made it into four loaves. I had never used oatmeal in meatloaf. It was good. Next time I'll add some grated veggies into the mix.

My husband raved over this easy meatloaf. Instead of plain salt I used season all and used bread crumbs in place of oats. The glaze was really sweet though and could use much less sugar. I only made 6 mini loaves. Good recipe, I would use this again.

I do believe that this is my husband's favorite meal!  Because they are individual meatloaves, I can customize them to the child (no sauce, a lot of sauce, etc.).

We love these. Best Meatloaf recipe ever. The only change I make is to add chopped onion, as that seems like a "must" in meatloaf to me. I even have a dozen of these in my deep freezer prepared to thaw and bake any time I want. The sauce "makes" them. - Update 01/18/12: Still in my regular rotation. We LOVE them. I tried to make them with ground turkey once. No good. They just spread out and didn't hold their shape. Stick with a very lean ground beef, and cut back on cheese if you are trying to cut fat/cal's. They are still good.

I  had to add a bit of garlic and onion powder to this (that's why it only has 4 stars), but this recipe rocks!  This is the ONLY meatloaf recipe I use now.

My husband and son LOVE this recipe.  I have made this several times and they always ask for it again.  I use less cheese and a little less milk and it comes out great!  The top is very sweet, so the brown sugar can be reduced if preferred.  Thanks!

These were great, except I made one mistake, I added a clove of garlic to the mix and must've been too much for the recipe because it was WAY too potent. Giving it 5 stars because everybody ate it anyway and loved it, I know it will be better next time, w/o the garlic.

This is the only meatloaf my husband will ask for. Even my 5yr old loves it. The only things I did different was I used bread crumbs instead of the oats, addes some chopped onion and cooked it in a muffin pan. The glaze is sweet, but very tasty.

My finally like it. I decided to make one big meatloaf, instead of mini-loaves. The meatloaf was plain. The glaze was good. Will make again, but will add black pepper.

Very good! Somewhere between a mini burger and a meatloaf, doesn't matter, they're tasty! I anticipated the sauce would be too sweet, so I cut the sugar and kicked it up a notch with some habanero sauce. Awesome. Great for portioning and leftovers.

My husband loves meatloaf and will order it quite often when we go out because I never make it.  He always adds ketchup to his meatloafs. I'm not a lover of meatloaf but thought i would give this one a try for him.  He loved it and never added ketchup to it.  he wanted it for lunch the next day and I even ate it and enjoyed it.  I had two small loaves left and he said," I have had my fill for a while."  I froze the left overs and the next day he was still talking about the meatloaf and how he could eat it.  I said too bad you said you had your fill so I froze it for your lunch to take to work. I will probably be making this quite often now!

This was good.  I didn't have cheddar on hand so I used mozzarella instead. I'll try this recipe again, but probably add onions, garlic, more flavor.  I served this with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  I love the 'mini' part of this recipe.  In the future, I will probably freeze the extra for a later meal.  My 4 year old gobbled it up, but my 15 month old ignored it.

I work full tiime 3-11 and I find it hard to find things to prepare that is easy ,simple and tasty to eat as I only have a 1/2 hour supper break. I tried this recipe and found it to be excellent and tasty. It will be on top of my food list and I will be making it often. Next time I want to double the recipe, cook them and then freeze them in serving portions ,so all I have to do is take them out of the freezer before I leave for work and pop them in the microwave at meal time.

Loved it! My husband is not a meatloaf lover and he ate three of these, and packed another in his lunch! I used ground turkey instead of beef and added onion, garlic and colored bell pepper. It was great! My husband wants me to make it again soon and cut back the brown sugar a little. Thanks Tonya!

I've made this with oats and without substituting breadcrumbs.  I liked it better with the breadcrumbs.  It's  simple and the sauce really does make it fantastic.

This recipe is FABULOUS!  Everyone that I have made this for, including my picky 14 month old, loves this meatloaf.  I did add chopped onions because, in my opinion, no meatloaf is complete without onion.  I also baked it in a loaf pan instead of making mini meatloaves.  I baked it for about an hour.  It is terrific!

I had no trouble with the consistancy at all. It was perfect meatloaf quality. I added garlic powder and finely chopped onion after reading reviews here. We were out of Worchestire :( so I just topped it with a ketchup and mustard mix. Served with baked potatos, this was a hit, and my stubborn son who HATES meatloaf doesn't even know he just devoured it!!!

Excellent.  Since I do not eat read meat, I used very lean turkey instead.  To cut back on the calories I substituted 2 egg whites for one egg; used Kraft fat free cheddar.

All four of my kids HATE meatloaf.  All four of my kids LOVED this recipe!  Amazing!  Personally, next time I will add (only to mine and hubby's) the onion, garlic salt and worchester recommended by so many already.  However, for picky kids, this is a HUGE hit.  Thank you.

This was a great, simple recipe. I added Worcestershire Sauce and onions (what's meatloaf without onions?), and they turned out well. I thought the ketchup sauce was way too sweet, so next time I'll omit it all together, or maybe put just a dab on each meatloaf.

Hubby LOVED these. I can't fathom meatloaf without onion, so I added half of a large, finely-chopped, sauteed onion. I also prefer a less sweet topping, so I cut down on the brown sugar. But that's just me. Great recipe!

I made these tonight in a 12-muffin pan and with exactly one pound of ground beef. It filled them up perfectly with just enough sauce to top each one. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer for the cooking time and 35 minutes was great - very moist meatloaf. I would have given this 5 stars, except for two things. First, the actual meat mixture was bland, even though I added some garlic powder, onion powder, and a splash of worcestershire sauce. And lastly, I did need to add about another 1/4 of oats to make the mixture workable - otherwise it was too wet, even after letting the oats soak in the liquid ingredients for 10 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer. I really enjoyed the sauce and overall, it was really good. My husband and I will both be eating this again but I will be sure to try and spice it up some more. Thanks!

Whole family gobbled them up.  Kids loved their own little loaf.  Added onion, carrot, celery and garlic (small amounts of each) for flavor and to get veggies in the meal.  Will make again for certain.

I added some onions to this recipe and since I don't have mini loaf pans, I used muffin pans, worked out beautiful and cooked them for 30-40 minutes.  The quick cooking oats were much better than using bread crumbs.  Thanks for sharing Tonya.

This recipe was a hit with my husband who never liked meatloaf. I added a little chopped onion, a dash of worchestershire sauce and garlic powder. I made it twice this week and it is so simple to throw together!!

Yum!  Meatloaf is not a family fav around here...however we all really liked these mini's. They were super moist and the sauce was great. I followed another readers advice and used a muffin pan- super easy. I added some garlic and black pepper to the meat mixture for flavor. Husband thought sauce was just a little too sweet so I will cut back on the brown sugar next time. Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I've been using the same recipe from Betty Crocker for years just because I haven't experimented much with meatloaf.  I'm glad I did.  I really liked the consistency of it - must be from the oatmeal which I'm used to dry breadcrumbs as the filler.  The sauce wa just the right touch of sweetness.  It was really good, although I didn't have any prepared mustard so I used 1/4 tsp of mustard powder instead.  I also made it in one big loaf and my whole family ate it up.  Good with scalloped potatoes and some green beans on the side.

We found these a bit mushy so will cut down oats to 2 Tablespoons. As suggested by others, I briefly ground the oats since I only had slow cooking. It was tasty and I also added garlic, dill weed and some cajun. I prepared it in a loaf and was done in 45 minutes. Will make again, Thanks.

I liked the recipe, it had an interesting flavor to it.  My only gripe (and the gripes of those who I cooked for) was that the meatloaves were pretty small.  Next time, I'll probably double the recipe.

it was the first time i ever attempted making a meatloaf. since i did not have any meat i used ground turkey and a lot more bread crumbs than what the recipe calls for. it was okay...too bland for my taste bud. also the ketchup gravy was too sweet. it would have been good if you did not use the brown ugar. overall it was OKAY.

I thought I'd make this recipie after seeing all the star reviews.  However, my family really didn't like this very much.  I tried to add more spices to it and crackers as well as oatmeal after reading other reviews.  Unfortunately it didn't help it any.  It was on the bland side but yet too sweet and way too soggy.  We thought that maybe it wasn't cooked all the way but it was.  Also, you couldn't even tell there was cheese in the mix!  I did double the recipie as I have a large family and made one large meatloaf instead of dividing it.  Not sure if that makes the difference or not.

Excellent!!  These were so tasty.  I have 4 picky kids and they loved it.  My 5 year old asked for seconds!!  I put the mixture into cupcake tins and baked for about 25 minutes.  Just the right size for smaller servings.  Will definetally make this again!!

This was very good!! My husband loved it. I used a pound  of ground turkey. I also sautéed about 1/4 chopped red onion and two stalks of celery then added them to the mixture. The sauce was a bit to sweet I will add a little less sugar next time but it gets a good rating.

This is definatly replacing my usual meatloaf recpie. My husband liked it as well, and he's not real hip on meatloaf. I added onion, garlic, worchestershire sauce, salt and pepper to the meat and garlic powder to the sauce.

This is wonderful!  And very, very easy which makes a real winner for me.  I changed it only slightly, more mustard and a little less sugar, just for my personal tastes.  I also added onion.  This is my new favorite meatloaf recipe!

These were really good and so easy to make!
I didn't have any oats so I crushed up some cheddar cheese crackers instead, and added a little more seasoning to the meat mixture.  My husband and four year old raved about them, and they are a tough crowd!  Delicious!

Yummy!!  The little meatloves themselves were a little bland, but with the slightly tangy glaze on top, was just great!  If you omit the glaze, I'd add a little onion powder or garlic to the meat mixture.  Thanks!

Very VERY good.  My family loved this recipe, and they have NEVER liked anyone's meatloaf.  The cheese is not over powering and the sauce complements the meat loaf perfectly.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!
[Edit] This is now THE dinner I make when we have company, and every time they ask for the recipe.  If I find I don't have any cheddar on hand, I have used provolone pieces and mozzarella.  It always comes out tasting great.

Easily a new family favorite!  Came out very, very moist, almost to the point of not wanting to stick together well, but did hold it's shape during baking and was just absolutely delightful to serve for dinner.  Thanks so much!

I thought this recipe was good and it was certainly easy to throw together, but my family wasn't as thrilled as I was. They didn't care for the sweet glaze. I'll make it again, but not for the same crowd!!

Everybody in my family loved this recipe.  I was a little skeptical about adding cheese since I do not like cheeseburgers, but the meatloaves were very tasty.

This was good, but a bit moist-- it might have been because I used a loaf pan in stead of the doing the mini loaves though.  It's super simple and can be put together in just a few minutes.  I'll make again for just that reason.  Hubby loves meatloaf and said that he was sold from the first bite!
#######
I made this again and did the mini loaves and it was much better, great recipe!

WOW! This was so good! I have never liked meatloaf but thought that I would make it so we wouldn't have the same old stuff and it was great. I also used someone elses advice and used crackers instead of oats.

Like many others, I used a cupcake tin to make it easier to portion out and the amount worked really well for my family. Adding some garlic and onion powder helped with the flavoring and I added a bit of steak sauce to the glaze just for taste. Overall it was good, and without the onion, it was a winner with picky eaters too.  Will likely make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly as given; i did change the serving size, as I had 2 pounds of beef i wanted to use, where the original recipe calls for 1 pound. Unfortunately, the ingredients doubled turns into a soppy mess (I knew 1 1/3 cup of milk looked like a alot of milk!) - i only used half of the wet mixture (cheese, milk, oatmeal, etc.) and even added bread crumbs to thicken up the meat and milk/oatmeal mess; It was terrible and I thought I ruined it completely! I cooked in one large loaf (big mistake!) - this recipe with this topping is meant to be cooked in individual/serving size portions!! Trust me! The taste is amazing with this sugary/BBQ like taste - the kids weren't too thrilled with this trial, but now that I know what NOT to do next time, this will definitely be a staple!
SUGGESTION _ DO NOT DOUBLE!!! Make the recipe in 2 seperate bowls if you have more then 1 pound of meat :)

My husband wanted to experiment with cooking meatloaf on the Blackstone griddle. We chose this recipe as a base to start from. Doubled the recipe, reduced the milk a bit and added some breadcrumbs. The final result was absolutely delicious. The oats and cheese make it so moist. It did not taste oaty or cheesy And making it on the griddle created a nice crispy outside. I did not double the sauce by the recipe but rather used those 3 ingredients to taste and added it after they were fully cooked.

The best meatloaf I've ever made and I've been making meatloaf for decades.  My husband loves meatloaf.  This is a great recipe.  The texture is fantastic and the taste is soooo good.  I made very minor changes.  I used some beef bouillon in the milk mixture instead of salt.  I also only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and supplemented that with some stevia.  I used regular oatmeal and let it soak in the milk mixture about 20 minutes before adding the ground beef.  Not sure the soaking is needed.  Will try making this without that step.

First time attempting to make meatloaf. it was easier than I thought it'd be! I made the meat a few days before I cooked them. it was for a potluck at work so I actually made them smaller than the recipe says. I also used Italian breadcrumbs instead of the oats. I may try the oats another day, still not sure as I feel the Italian breadcrumbs gave it more flavor. It was a hit at work and will definitely be making these again!

My husband loves meatloaf. I’m not a big fan but I do like this meatloaf. I especially like the sauce on top, I also put some sauce on my plate to dip the meatloaf in. I add breadcrumbs instead of the oats I just prefer it that way. This is my go to meatloaf recipe.

I found this to be the most moist meatloaf I’ve ever eaten! I made it exactly like the recipe except I used muffin pans instead of loaf pans. Everyone went back for seconds so I know it’s a hit.

These mini meat loaves were excellent!  Even my adult son who thinks meatloaf was only popular to "our generation" and not enticing to his, ate 3 of them.  I took suggestions from reviewers by adding sauteed onion and garlic, worchestire sauce, added extra spices  and let the oatmeal mix set for 15 minutes, before mixing with ground beef, onion and garlic.  I will definitely make this again.  Oh, by the way, the only cheddar cheese I had was a taco mix, and it added extra flavor!!!

I make these mini meat loaves in muffin tins and bake for about 30-35 minutes.  My kids love them and ask for these often!

Well this is a meal that I researched and made all by myself.  My family loved it. They were really amazed considering they thought all I ever made before was piggies in a blanket and beanie weenies. I even impressed myself.

This was awesome! 

Added about a quarter cup of chopped onion, one chopped celery stick, one grated carrot. Omitted cheese. Cooked them in a (regular sized) muffin pan. My 5-year old ate 3!

I used ground turkey instead but it was too moist so I added more oatmeal but you could taste the oatmeal.

I did as others suggested and mixed the eggs, cheese, milk, oats, & salt in a large bowl & let it sit for about 15 minutes.  In the meantime, I placed diced onions & jalapeño peppers in a bit of butter and microwaved in a bowl for a few minutes until softened. I drained off the butter & cooled.  I stirred the cooled peppers & onions into the cheese and oat mixture and then added the ground beef.  I formed my beef mixture into four loaves, added the glaze, and baked all four in a glass baking dish for 60 minutes.  This recipe was very very good, moist and flavorful.  Also very easy to put together with on hand ingredients.  My husband loved this meat loaf, & leftovers were  great!

Made exactly as Tonya submitted.  It is THE perfect meatloaf recipe and making them "mini" is brilliant.  Delicious.  Other reviewers mentioned that their kids or their husband absolutely loved them.....yup, here too.  I did let the oatmeal soak in the wet ingredients for a bit, so there was no oatmeal-cookie-syndrome as someone reported, and I will never use another recipe for meatloaf again.  Did I mention it was easy to prep?  Yes it was, and the results were wonderful.  Try it, don't change it.  It is perfectly fine the way the recipe was submitted!

The flavor was OK, but the texture wasn't quite right (yes, I'm mindful to not overmix). I LOVE cheddar cheese, so it came as a surprise that I could take them or leave them.

We really like these.  They are faster that regular sized meat loaf and "fun size".  They don't have a lot of ingredients, so they are more low maintenance.  The only problem is waiting 45 minutes for them to come out of the oven.

I have searched high and low for a delicious meatloaf when I found this and thought I'd give it a try. I knew I would't do the Mini's but keep it in the loaf pan. I doubled the recipe (freezes great!!) and froze half of it.  My family loves this one. I did add garlic, onions and mushrooms. Highly recommend and have already saved it as a "go to" for our family.

This was ok, but I made a few adjustments and will make even more next time if I make them again.
I found the meat mix was too wet, so I added bread crumbs a few tablespoons at a time until it would form with my hands. I added onion salt, (however next time I will use a cooking onion). I added about 1/2 tsp of black pepper. For the cheese, I used a 3 cheese blend. For the topping, I added about 1/2 tsp of garlic to the sauce. 
Well, the finished product was 8 mini meatloaves that kept their form. They were missing something and in my opinion, it is onion. Growing up, my Mom would melt cheese on top (not inside of the meatloaf.) I didn't mind that these had sauce on top, but oh my! Far too sweet! I am not a fan of catsup, so, in the future, I will use tomatoe paste or leave them plain. I would not recommend them as the recipe is written... with some changes it is worth trying.

I added about 1/2 package of hot breakfast sausage (pan) and some chopped onion.  My husband loves this recipe.  I have never been a meatloaf person, but this is good and I always eat more than I think I will.  I also use a small meatloaf pan, and always make enough for two meatloafs,  Good for another meal!

These were so yummy!  The only change I made was I used 1/2 cup of GF pretzel crumbs for the bread crumbs and didn't add any extra salt.  I made 9 "muffins" and I lined my tins with parchment muffin paper.  This is a keeper!  Thanks.

The whole family loved this including my picky 7 and 5 year olds.  My husband claimed it was the best meatloaf he ever had. The only change I made was that I used Bullseye bbq sauce on top because I was running out of time. Tasted great. I might use less salt next time as I found it quite salty.

Good flavor and easy. The sauce was too sweet; next time I'll cut the sugar in half. I substituted cooked rice for the oatmeal.

Love the topping - classic meatloaf! I substituted the oats for Italian bread crumbs and added a bit of BBQ sauce into my meat mixture to give it more flavor - Son and husband really loved it!!!

Great base recipe. I gave it 4 stars due to no one liking the ketchup topping. Like others I used a muffin tin and topped it with bbq sauce, A1, or whatever anyone was in the mood for. I have even changed the cheese I put in it.

I’ve made this a recipe a number of times and I’ve found that sautéing a small onion in butter and adding it in to the meat mixture makes the finished product twice as tasty. Also, I’ve always just used normal oats (not quick cooking) and it comes out great. Love the idea to use oatmeal instead of bread crumbs like most recipes call for!

Sooo GOOD!
I just made this for my family.  I’m not a big meatloaf fan so I hesitantly tried a bite and OMG, I LOVE IT!
I’m packing one for lunch tomorrow. 
I added finely chopped onions, Worcestershire sauce, garlic power.  
This is going to be my go to meatloaf recipe.
I am definitely making this one again.

Loved it, wouldn't hurt to add onion or garlic but I didn't miss it much! There is only 2 of us so I halved the recipe and used 1/4 cup of  a mixed combo between instant oats and Italian bread crumbs. Texture was good and flavor was spot on! Will be making again!

Excellent recipe.  My husband loves meatloaf, and for the most part, I don't, but these were juicy and delicious.  I was a little hesitant about using oats instead of breadcrumbs, but these mini meatloaves are delicious!

This is a family favorite.  I make at least twice a month.  Hubby loves this but wouldn't touch a regular meatloaf.  This is more like a cheeseburger meatloaf.  NO ONIONS makes hubby happy.

This is a great alternative to one large meatloaf.  Some things I changed....I didn't use cooking oats, but instead used 1 cup of plain bread crumbs.  I also added: 1 tbs steak sauce, 1 tbs worcheshire sauce, 1 cup chopped green pepper, 1 cup chopped onion.
I didn't use mustard in the ketchup/brown sugar mixture.  I put half of the this mixture on meatloaves before baking, and then the rest after it was finished baking.  I will be making these instead of one large meatloaf.  DELICIOUS!

Excellent variation of meatloaf. I added chopped onion, soaked the oatmeal in milk for 5 minutes, divided into 10 muffin tins & cooked for 45 minutes. Turned out great. Next time I will use a little less brown sugar.

This is a great basic meatloaf recipe the way it is. After all shouldn't meatloaf be able to b made with some ground meat and pantry items? I do add a couple spices and some caramelized onion just my personal preference. A+++++

My sister shared this recipe with me and I’m glad she did. I LOVE these!  I’m NCGS (wheat severe) and finding meatloaf recipes that are easily changed isn’t always easy (regular to GF breadcrumbs). I love that these are made with oats. I didn’t add my own seasoning as I would normally do; I wanted to taste it as is. It’s fantastic!  Next time I’ll add my garlic, onion, etc.

Made, per directions, except for soaking the oats to absorb the liquid and using brown mustard.   Hubby is now cleaning up after this delicious meal.  He said t to give it six stars, as it was delicious!   I am not a fan of ketchup, tomato sauce based meatloaf, so the brown mustard eased that overpowering taste, along with just a bit of Brown Sugar Splenda.  Yummy, easy and a new regular in our menu rotation.

This is our go-to meatloaf recipe. I grew up with meatloaf, but wanted to change things up. This is now my husband's favourite meal. I sometimes add some garlic, onion or spices and I use a little less milk than recommended. I also make 6 loaves, not 8 because they seemed too small for us. Overall a great, simple recipe that delivers on flavour!

I substituted the brown sugar with white sugar+honey because I couldn’t find the brown sugar I had.Therefore, I had to add more ketchup to the sauce. Also,I added a little cayenne pepper to the sauce and more breadcrumbs on top of the loaves before baking to add a little extra crunch. My hubby said that he didn’t care for any of the meatloaf he had previously tried,but i made this anyway.This is now the only meatloaf he will eat. Thank you!

Made this once and now it is a staple in our house. Our 11 year old son is in charge of making this and he can follow this recipe easily.

I made this as directed except I used ground turkey instead of ground beef (but I almost always make this substitution) and I found it bland. Also, the addition of the brown sugar in the sauce was too sweet for my taste.

This is one of our favorite quick fix recipes. My daughter found it while searching for a quick hamburger meat recipe. I have even did these meatball size and taken them to church dinners. Everybody loved them and I even got calls asking for the recipe.

Phenomenal!  I’m not a big fan of meatloaf but sometimes crave it and now after trying this recipe am a huge fan of meatloaf and will add to my regular dinner rotation.  I followed the recipe exactly however added half an onion and used my jumbo muffin pan instead of forming the meatloaf individually ( I’m lazy like that).  Same cooking time and temp, they were perfect unlike any other meatloaf I’ve ever had!  Thank you so much for sharing!

This recipe is my go-to meatloaf recipe! My family loves it and the pre-portioned loaves are perfect for packing for lunch. I like to caramelize some minced mushrooms and onions (sometimes shredded carrots too) and toss them in for an extra punch of flavor (also can’t have too many veggies!!). Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly. The oatmeal really helps to keep it from drying out along with the generous scoops of the ketchup topping that I smother around the top of  each loaf. I spread tin foil on a baking sheet for easy clean up and it works great! Sometimes I have issues with the loaves sticking to the tin foil (thanks brown sugar) if I let them cool without touching them. If you gently scoop under them before letting them cool, you’ll avoid this issue.

 We had this for dinner tonight and I really can’t sing this recipe’s praises enough! This is definitely one to keep in your weeknight dinner arsenal!

I found these underwhelming in flavor--the glaze was the predominant flavor.   I did add sauteed onions and garlic to mine before baking.  If I were to make this again, I would decrease the amount of oats and milk.

My son in law who is a meat loaf lover, said this one was great!
I made 2 small changes, made it with turkey and beef and for the sauce, I used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bar b q sauce. It was a hit.

Very delicious base recipe. I used Italian breadcrumbs. Half ketchup half honey mustard, for the sauce. Definitely enhanced the recipe from a sweet level. As well, I added onions.

Followed the recipe because I liked the idea of individual loaves. I found this very easy and fast to put together. I was surprised that the flavor was so tasty and I enjoyed the moist texture. Moms, your kids will love this one.

This was bad!  Followed the recipe to a T.  I should have known it would be BLAH based on the ingredients  (or lack of).  How did it get such high reviews?!  And even made it into the Allrecipes magazine!?  I could taste the oatmeal (weird) and it had no other flavor.  And the topping just tasted like ketchup.  The ratio of ketchup to brown sugar is way off.

I would absolutely make this again.  I made them with Flax powder instead of the oatmeal and they were just as good if not better than the first ones.  My company loved them and kept asking what the sauce was on top.  It's such a simple recipe that makes a big impact.  The draw back is that they make a mess in the oven.  I used cookie trays underneath to collect the grease runoff.

I made this however, I did not have bread crumbs so I used crushed Ritz instead. I also omitted the cheese as I had already added cheese to the loaded mashed. It was delish. Try using 2 tbsp of ACV instead of mustard, it gives the sauce a nice zing!

I followed the recipe as it was and loved it!  I split my mixture up into 4 small loaves and used mini foil pans.  The only difference I'd do is add some garlic. (I like garlic in almost everything!

Best ever meatloaf and, yes, so easy. All I added was a splash of Worcestershire  sauce and reduced the brown sugar to 1 tbsp. I made them into mini-loaves so I can put them in the freezer and pop them out  as needed.

Came out fantastic. I used urkey and followed the recipe and put it in my large muffin cups and it came out delicious. Added oats to breadcrumb mixture, chopped onions, shredded carrots, and additional seasonings. Yum, yum.

Think this would have been much better if family plans had not changed at the last minute.  I made this yesterday expecting my son and grandson for five-thirty and keeping it warm until 7 o'clock when they rescheduled to today.  Re-heating it again seems to have dried it out somewhat.  Still good but not as moist as I would have liked.

The first couple of times I made this recipe, I followed it exactly.   Both me and my husband love it and I also love how easy it is!   Now sometimes we add onion, but really, it's not necessary.   Really yummy recipe just as written.

The whole time I was making this I doubted it.  I had half a pound of beef and very little in my pantry.  I just happened to have the ingredients, and made it exactly as called for except I added a little more oats and cheese as the mixture appeared a little wet before adding the meat.  Still doubted it as I poured the glaze on top. But let me tell you - this was fantastic!  The consistency of the meatloaf comes out amazing. You will not regret making it.

I follow the recipe just like it said and I made it in little the square brownie cooker pans. So  I cooked it in my convection  roast  oven  at 325 degrees Fahrenheit  for 20 minutes . They were Tinder juicy and they had a caramelization on the outside. My kids absolutely love them. And they are picky! My daughter said, "It was great! I want to eat more than one."

I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but my family is. Everyone loved this including myself. I added onions, but I'm sure it's great as is. This will be our go to meatloaf from now on.

i gave this 5 stars because the oatmeal methods has changed my whole concept of meatloaf. I hated meatloaf until this recipe. I do like to add minced onion, garlic and pepper to my mini meatloaf. But the basic recipe is still rockin. I have also, as other reviewers have said, just made it a regular loaf shape and it was still cool. But it's kinda nice to have pre-portioned little meat mounds as well. Everyone who eats this meatloaf comments on how they always hated meatloaf and now they feel differently. It's good. Go for it!

Absolutely delicious as  written.  Only one complaint, no leftovers.  Next time I will double recipe.  It was quick, easy, tasty, and easy clean up with the aluminum foil. The brown sugar gave the glaze an exotic flavor for my family.

Made it almost exactly but used ground turkey, added onions, and split half and half with oats and seasoned breadcrumbs. Also put it in muffin tins. Recipe is almost identical to the one I already use with the addition of the cheddar cheese. I didn't think the cheese would make such a difference but it gave each meatloaf a wonderful crust that my husband loved! Was delicious and I'll make it again!

I made this in a hurry and they turned out really well.  I used Old Fashioned Quaker Oats because that's all I had.   As recommended by others, I let the oatmeal sit in the milk /egg mixture for 5 minutes before mixing in the ground beef.  I made small loaves and placed in a foil lined pan, also recommended, and topped with brown sugar /ketchup mixture.   I found the topping too sweet and didn't go well with my egg noodles.  
I will make these again but with a BBQ sauce topping.

We  didn't like the texture of the oats. And we thought the topping was very sweet. Luckily, I decided to add a package of dry onion soup at the last minute. It was the only thing that gave the actual meatloaf any flavor.

Delicious! These meat loaves were easy to make and were a hit.  My husband loved them so much, he keeps asking for more! The recipe said to make into 8 loaves, but when I was making them I felt they were too small, so I made into 5 mini loaves and they turned out perfect. It's going to be hard to go back to my Mom's meatloaf recipe after making these :)

OK, so I HATE meatloaf! Made this last night because the DH thought it sounded good. Almost cut recipe in 1/2 but, glad I didn't. We have some left for tonight. Yeah! Only changes I made were to sauté some minced onion and add worchestshire sauce. I chose to cover a baking sheet will foil and spray with oil instead of using a muffin tin I would have to scrub clean. Worked like a charm. Super good, quick and easy and will make again! Thank you for sharing the recipe, Tonya!

I followed the recipe exactly except I let the milk/oats mixture sit for about 15 minutes before adding the beef and mixing. I made these mini loaves in 6 heart shapes and had enough left for 2 muffins. I like the smaller muffins rather than free form. The topping is out of this world delicious!

I made this recipe last night exactly as the recipe calls for.  I thinks that's fair before rating.  I loved the oats and the cheese.  (BTW, if you substituted bread crumbs for the oats or left out the cheese, then you didn't make this recipe.)  I followed suggestions and let the egg, milk, cheese and oats soak awhile.  Next time I am going to try using a muffin pan just to see what a difference that makes.  I also agree with other reviewers that it needs onion and garlic and Worcestershire sauce.  But overall a great recipe.

I find it helpful to not add the sauce until three quarters of the way through cooking and after I have drained the grease. It's also more tasty after adding about a teaspoon of seasoned salt, some chopped green pepper, and a little bit of chopped onion, depending upon your taste. My family loves this recipe.

We loved it!  Best meatloaf I have ever made. So flavorful , and so easy to make. We had 2lbs if ground beef to use, so doubled the recipe but otherwise followed the recipe as-is.

I will definitely make this meatloaf again.  I gave it 4 stars because the milk should be about half the amount called for.  Like other reviewers suggested, I let the oatmeal soak in the milk for a bit, about 15 minutes.  I also added a sauteed chopped onion and some Worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf mixture as well.  For the mustard, I used Dijon. The ketchup, brown sugar, Dijon topping was outstanding for any meatloaf recipe.  I cooked the little meatloaves in the over-sized muffin tins sprayed with Pam.  A single recipe would make approximately 6 of those.

Very good, have made it twice already!  I just can't help "doctoring" recipes though.  Used seasoned bread crumbs, a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce and some garlic & onion powder.  Only used ketchup on the outside too!

Our go-to mini meat loaf recipe!  I omit the cheese but add a Tablespoon of chopped green pepper and another of chopped onion.  While shaping the loaves, if it seems a bit too wet, I sprinkle a bit more oatmeal into the mix.  There are many many meat loaf recipes out there, and this one seems the best fit.  Makes great cold meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers the next day too!

I was really excited to try this recipe after seeing the great reviews but our family thought it was just ok.  I followed the recipe exactly as written & we thought it was pretty bland.  There are much better meatloaf recipes on this site.  Not sure who was rating it 5 stars.

So I followed the recipe however instead of mini meatloaf I decided to follow another post and used a loaf pan. After 55 min baking the meat in middle was rare, the consistency was way too mushy and soft. Something is not right. Too much moisture.

A good base.  I added  a few extra spices just to give the meat a little more flavor.  I put mine in my muffin pan.  I made 10 with 1lb of meat.  I cooked mine  for 30 min at 350 degrees.  Tasty and all 3 of my young children  eat it.

I've been making these for years, from a recipe in Taste of Home.  They are delicious meat loaves, and the small size means less cooking time.  At harvest, the individual size is very convenient to take to the field. Excellent recipe

My entire family loves these, and we've got them on our permanent two-week dinner rotation. 

They make quite a mess in the pan so I like using a mini loaf pan lined with silicone baking cups. 

If you're counting calories (like I am) use a little less than 1/4th measuring cup to measure out the individual mini loaves and you'll have 12 servings at 183 calories each (exactly 1/4th cup is 11 servings at 199 calories). These are awesome served with a refreshing side salad and broccoli and thanks to the oats.. they're more filling than their diminutive size would suggest.

Tender , tasty and attractive.  Like CATALOGRRR, I also made mine in a standard sized muffin pan.  When my "muffins"  first came out of the oven they  had a lot of juice in the muffin tins, but after sitting for 2 to 3 minutes that juice was reabsorbed by the meat. 
I cooked my mini meat muffins only 30 minutes and that was perfect.  I will make these many more times and pass the sauce seperately for individual tastes.

This is the only way I make meatloaf now. My kids and husband get so excited when I tell them we are having “meatloaf muffins” (more on that). I have found that either the quick cooking or the cook oats work just as well. Because it’s soaking up a lot of the juices, they don’t stay uncooked. The cheese does not result in a stringy cheesy meatloaf, it’s more for the flavor. You wouldn’t think to add either of those ingredients but it works really well!

I make mine in muffin tins. I use the same heat and for the full 40-45 minutes depending on how my oven feels like working. If you do this method, I would wait to add the topping until about 2-3 left on cook time. Otherwise the sugar burns...bad.

My picky 2 year old ate this meatloaf faster than it took me to prepare our own plates. It was amazing!

I love these mini meatloaves. So easy to serve and look nice on the plate. I did addd some chopped and sautéed onion and some plack pepper. I have to admit, I 1st though the amount of milk was too much, and I was sure it was too much when I saw the meat mixture being runny and difficult to shape into loaves. Nevertheless, the result was a moist and tasty meatloaves.

so so so so  good! I made a few changes but overall it was so tasty. instead of oats I used Italian bread crumbs, 2% milk and celery salt. The sauce for the top was so addicting. I could eat that on everything.

So good! I made it exactly like the recipe calls except used bread crumbs instead of oats since I didn't have those on hand. My picky 4 yr old asked for seconds. That is a miracle. Pretty sure I heard angels singing at that point. Will make this again and again and not change a thing.

This was my first time cooking meatloaf and my boyfriend said he liked it better than his moms!! I changed a few things off the recipe though. I wasn't sure if id like oatmeal in my meatloaf so I used broken up saltine crackers. Also, I added minced onion because meatloaf doesn't sound like meatloaf without it. I'm not a fan of mustard so I didn't add it to the ketchup - brown sugar sauce. And lastly, I cooked them in a cupcake pan and they came out perfectly shaped!

So easy, I made eight mini meat loafs froze them and bake a couple of them when we want meat loaf, it works great for my husband and I.  I used panko and added garlic powder and sweet basil.  These were great.

My mom loves this recipe and would always make it for us when we'd come home from college. I've now taken it and made it my own by using ground turkey and Almond coconut milk. I shared with my coworkers and they all asked for the recipe! I made them in muffin tins to make the portions even.

Delicious! I added thyme, paprika, black pepper, minced parsley. In my opinion the sugar is not necessary. The ketchup is sweet enough and I even plan next time to try halving the ketchup or finding a healthier alternative.

I have never been a big fan of meatloaf until I tried this. It had such good ratings I had to try it and am very glad I did. Now instead of thinking of meatloaf as a bland dinner my family  requests this meatloaf often .

Love this recipe! 
I use 1 cup of any kind you wish stove top stuffing instead of oatmeal.  The mini meatloafs taste moist and cook better than a huge hunk of meat. The sauce is great on top, and my family enjoys this dish. 
Thank you. Will be a favorite forever!

I've made these twice and they are easy, quick and delicious. However, I  did make a couple adjustments the second time.  Since  another reviewer said it tasted like an oatmeal cookie with meat, I put in less than 1/4  cup of brown sugar and I used crushed up oyster crackers instead of oatmeal. I also put in half the salt because I felt a whole teaspoon would make it tastes too salty. Finally, I used a small can of tomato sauce instead of ketchup just because I felt like it. The refrigerated leftovers make wonderful meatloaf sandwiches!

I followed the recipe except to substitute the oatmeal with breadcrumbs.   I used a muffin pan and with a 1/3 measuring  cup filled 9 spaces.  I used 90% lean sirloin, but still the grease overflowed, my fault, I should have thought to place the muffin tin on a cookie sheet. The flavor of the meatloaf was okay, but use less brown sugar, it was too sweet mixed with the ketchup.

I made this as written and thought that it was kind of bland.  It was very moist and we liked the topping.  I will probably make again, but with some additional seasoning such as onion powder or Worcestershire sauce.  I do like the small loaves and they freeze well.  Super easy to pull out just what you need to fix depending on how many are there for supper.

We used bread crumbs instead of oats because that's what we had in the pantry. I followed the rest of the recipe as is and it was delicious! Very easy and quick enough to make on a week night.

family approved!  
very moist, used whatever cheese on hand and meatloaf meat mix with some grated carrots.
 too lazy to make the sauce, so topped with store-bought bbq sauce; some shakes of garlic powder and sugar. cooked loafs over wire rack for fat to drip off.

We love this recipe. We have made it several times. But, last night was our first time to make it with the cheese (we always forgot to buy cheese). We actually found that we like this recipe way more without the cheese. The cheese makes it greasier. So, we will continue to make this but without the cheese. I normally love cheese in most things, but, for us, this meatloaf is perfect on it's own.

We really liked it. We put the meatloaf in muffin tins.   The only thing I would change is I would add onions and maybe some chopped carrots.

I love making this meatloaff in muffin tins. I've added Sriracha or Chili Garlic Sauce to the ketchup mixture to add a kick. Easy to store and take leftovers to work. 
Oven temp and cook time is always perfect. 
I use the 6 large muffin tin and increase the beef to 1.25 lbs but keep the other ingredients the same.

This was so easy to make!  Will definitely make it again. I used half n half instead of milk and just to be bad, I cut up 1/2 cup of bacon into the mix. Perfect weeknight meal. Paired with baked potatoes. I used organic grass fed beef.

This is our favorite meatloaf recipe!!  I usually make as is but I've been known to sub out the oatmeal for breadcrumbs.

Everyone liked it.  I used a cupcake pan, and the recipe made the perfect amt. It may not have needed a whole hour though (the outsides were crispy).  It was not as cheesy as I've had before but probably healthier.  The oatmeal was fine.

This recipe is delicious as is, but the second time I made it, I made some modifications which really took it over the top.  I omitted the salt, and added a few dashes of Worcestershire 
sauce and a packet of Ranch dip/dressing mix.  Amazing!!!

I used 4 mini meat loaf pans. My family has different food allergies, so this was perfect. I could add onion to one, ketchup to another, BBQ sauce to another, and one plain topped. This helped so much when having to cook for different diets.

I am British and never cooked this before. It's not heard of home here in Wales so I though I would give it a try. It we very nice it tasted like a beef burger ( I think you call them hamburgers) The children enjoyed it and they are fussy ! We had it with mashed potatoes, cabbage and gravy.  I will make it again, but I will add some garlic and onion next time to increase the flavour . Thank you for sharing.  Diolch yn fawr ( thank you in Welsh ) XXX

I have never veered from my meatloaf recipe until today. I wanted something different and my fiance and I both loved it. I followed the other reviewers and put the mixture in a 6-cup muffin pan that I sprayed with Pam. I baked it for 50 min. and tested it to 160 degrees. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of oats so the meat was a little soft. I think next time I will try it with rolled oats.

This made about 5 mini loaves with the pound of meat but they were the perfect size. My kids are not picky eaters but they did not like the sauce, so since I made mashed potatoes and gravy next time we will just cover with gravy. These cooked beautifully in 45 exactly. I did  leave the mixture to soak for about 45 minutes in the fridge before making the loaves so I had no issues with it tasting "oaty" or anything like that. Oats do offer a different flavor than bread crumbs (of course) but it's not bad, a very good flavor.

This dish was very easy to make and was a hit. Very delicious and would recommend it. I didn't change the recipe and made it just like it was. Only thing I would change is to make more of the topping as it was a nice addition.

The consistency was good, and it wasn't dry.  It had a strange flavor that I can't really describe to it.  Not sure if it was the oats or something else that caused it.

I am not a big meatloaf fan .... UNTIL NOW!

This recipe is awesome.  I did make a couple changes (of course!)  I diced a small onion and I used breadcrumbs instead of oatmeal.  Soaking the breadcrumbs in the milk for a few minutes ahead of time makes a world of difference.  

I really like the sauce on top, but my husband prefers his sans sauce.

Make sure you spray the pan with Pam as  they really want to stick to the pan.

I will never make another meatloaf other than this one!

I made this tonight. I did not have oats, so I used bread crumbs. I will make it again with oats to taste the difference. My husband loved it. I liked it a lot. I will cut the brown sugar portion in half next time. I agree with the summary that the ketchup and brown sugar add a tangy flavor. I like tangy, and I think it will be even more so with less brown sugar. This was a very easy recipe!

This was a HUGE hit at our home of 4 boys (ages 12, 10, 6 & 3) and my Husband LOVED this recipe! Added in a mix of cheeses & a little bit of worchestire to the sauce, other than those very little modifications, we made this to the T, came out perfect. We used a measuring cup to portion out each mini meatloaf & added the sauce to the top... Very flavorful~ Thank you!

Finally! 26 years of marriage and my husband loves my meatloaf! This is wonderful! The glaze is over the top terrific. I love that it's made without onion, since I am not a huge fan.  Still flavorful and oh so yummy!

This recipee was easy to make. I chose to use a muffin pan, as others suggested. Cooking time us ~20-25 min. 

The meat was moist and tasty. The brown sugar / ketchup / mustard topping was way too sweet for me, but the kids loved it. Try substituting ketchup.

I made this with seasoned bread crumbs instead of oats (exact same amount) and it came out wonderfully. It tasted like a cheese burger covered in, well, meatloaf sauce. We paired this with roasted broccoli which really brightened up the dish. I thought the cheese made things a little greasy, but my boyfriend said he would eat these literally every single day if he could.

Very good, the family loved it! As other reviewers recommended, I used less oatmeal and more Italian breadcrumbs. This recipe makes nice sized portions in the muffin tins. These makes great leftover meatloaf sandwiches!

I will make again. Didn't make any changes except I soaked the oatmeal in the milk and egg for about 4 minutes. I don't really like meatloaf as a rule but this was fantastic.

I have made this recipe many times.  I use the leanest ground beef and low fat cheese to make this a healthy dinner.  My husband and mother love it.

It was a really good recipe! I was surprised! I didn't change the recipe itself, but I put it in 6 muffin tins instead of 8 and I had to leave it in the oven to cook for about 10 minutes longer than suggested. Probably because I put more meat in the tins than the suggested 8 tins. But that was it! It was perfect otherwise!

The family really enjoyed it, including my picky chef-brother in law.  I found the sauce too sweet so I'll reduce the sugar next time, and the chef suggested I add some smokiness to the sauce as well.  This will become a staple!
Update - I cooked it for 20+ people over the weekend including 9 kids, and everyone loved it.  New go-to crowd pleaser!

LOVE IT!!!!!! It is fast, quick and easy.  I made it exactly as stated.  You generally have all these ingredients in the pantry, so you don't have to stress as to do I have this or that.  As one reviewer did, I put mine in the cupcake tin.  It made about a dozen easily.  Making it like this is easy to serve, especially to little ones.  And keep the big ones from overeating. Will definitely make again and again.

AWESOME... Love this.  I did make a few changes tho.  I made it ground porc.  Added garlic powder and worcestershire sauce and used the Splenda brown sugar (diabetic so trying to reduce as much of the sugars).  Made 11 portions in total.

Loved the recipe.  I did not add milk and used Italian bread crumbs. Mixed the egg, cheese, bread crumbs together and added ground beef.  The sauce made the dish.

My 10-year old grandson has expressed an interest in cooking, so this was a dish he was able to  do a lot of the steps. We followed the recipe closely, but made some adjustments to seasonings, adding about 2 teaspoons of worchestire sauce, several dashes of garlic powder, ground pepper,  1/3 cup of  white onion. We will definitely keep the added seasonings. Since he said he didn't like cooked catsup we cut that part of the recipe in half-except decreased the sugar by a little more. (A good chance to practice fractions) However, after tasting his catsup mixture, he decided he liked it and added a bit more of everything. He divided his meat into 6 portions (more math) and topped with his concoction. Like others have said, the secret may be in letting the oatmeal mixture sit for a bit before adding the meat and letting the loaves sit for just a few minutes before serving. To serve the mini loaves, we placed them over some sautéed spinach. I though it was a nice touch for presentation and to get in some greens; he didn't really agree. When I asked if he wanted to keep the recipe, he said he would have to wait until after he tasted it. Needless to say, he ended up keeping the recipe. This is a stellar recipe; however, I think the meat does require additional  seasoning. This is a quick, easy meal. The moistness of the mini loaves is perfect and with additional seasoning, the flavor is good.

Good twist. I've always used oats in my meatloaf. But, never tried cheddar cheese or brown sugar. Instead of chopping onions, I use a packet of Lipton Onion Soup. Easier.

I really like it. I didn't make individuals, I made a whole pan. I added this sweet and spicy sauce from trader's joe with the ketchup and brown sugar and didn't use mustard. I also added a maggie cube instead of salt and pepper for the sauce. Everything was great.

Loved baking these; more crust per loaf! Tasty and moist, too. I used 93/7 ground beef since most of moisture came from cheese, milk, and egg. Oatmeal helped firm up the texture. My only complaint was cheese weeping from loaves--quite a messy clean-up. Next time I'll press the cheese inside each loaf and see how that works.

My family eats these a lot in the winter time.  Of course I kick them up a few notches.  Add onion, garlic, sometimes celery, green peppers and mushrooms.   And, when I have them I add walnuts too.

Love this easy recipe.  I don't add as much cheese in the recipe (my personal preference), but I add extra on top for the rest of my family.  They're a cute size and very tasty.

I made a few changes to make it a skinny version at 192 calories per meatloaf.  left out the salt, and used fat-free shredded cheddar cheese, unsweetened almond-coconut milk, lean ground beef 90/10, and Heinz Simply Tomato Ketchup.  This is a great recipe and the skinny version makes it a lighter healthier version.

I have made this many times, in the cupcake pans.  Everyone likes the edge of the meatloaf and the cupcake method gives that to everyone.  the portions are perfect and the leftovers are easy to store.
The only change I do is I double the portion and do 1 pound very lean ground beef and 1 pound mild Italian sausage.  The sausage in the mix adds the needed fat and adds a good 'bacony' flavor. 
The topping part I cut back to orig and it covers 22-24 cupcakes of this meaty heaven.  If I matched it to match the loaf, it is way too much.
I have made these as is and love them.

excellent recipe. I did put some chopped onion in but that is a personal preference.  Finally a meatloaf recipe that comes out nice and moist and makes it easy for leftovers:)

Very good! Omitted the cheese and added Worcestershire sauce. Also think the ketchup mixture was a little too much.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I've made it several times. Tonight I substituted the beef for turkey. (Just added a tiny bit more oats and cheese because turkey is more watery than beef.) It turned out great! The mustard, in my opinion, is the shining star of this recipe! It's so good!

this was extra yummy! made some changes. added one tablespoon of dried minced onion, half of a tablespoon of garlic powder and I didn't have cheddar cheese so used half cup of grated parmesan. also, used mixed the sauce to taste more than followed the recipe. like others, I used a muffin tin and the cook time was the same. everyone loved it!

I love this recipe. I had all of the ingredients already, so I whipped it together to try it out. My husband and I really enjoyed these! I used shredded mozzarella cheese since I didn't have cheddar, and I omitted the mustard. The brown sugar really gave the topping a delicous, tangy taste. I'll definitely make these again!

This recipe is wonderful! My family loves it. Used bread crumbs. Have gone to ground turkey instead of ground beef and still just as good. Leftovers make great sandwiches.

I have never made meatloaf before...I have been scared because I remember my mom's as a kid... YIKES. I found this recipe yesterday and went for it. WOW.. this was nothing like mom's... thank goodness, it was so moist and flavorful, but I was a bit of a rebel and did a few things my own way. I added garlic powder and season salt to the meat mixture. I also did not use all the milk recommended, I used just a little bit to soak my oats in before mixing with the meat (one review suggested that) I also made my own sauce for the topper. I used ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, a little brown sugar to sweeten just a bit and some mustard powder. I made the sauce suggested and it was just too much so I dumped it and played around. My husband has asked me to add this to my dinner repertoire.. and my step son told me it was awesome!! Would have given 5 stars but the sauce was just... NO.

I always use this recipe for meatloaves! My family loves them! When I do not have wheat squares cereal, I have used wheat bran flakes and they work very well. Also, I do not use mini loaf pans, but make mini meatloaves, at least six and place them on a greased cooking sheet or roasting pan and put the ketchup mixture over them before baking. They only take 40-45 minutes this way in my oven. Otherwise, I always follow the proportions in the recipe exactly. Yummy!

I have to start by saying I totally screwed up this EASY recipe because I was distracted by my 3 year old while preparing it. I mixed ALL the ingredients together! Didn't do the glaze seperate, lol. Besides being a little on the moist side, they tasted incredible!!! So yummy and I know my kids are going to love this recipe! Only reason I didn't give 5 starts is because k did it wrong and you have to like that sweet flavor to enjoy this recipe. I did, so thank you :-)

To tell the truth, my husband loved it.  I did it with ground turkey meat and low fat cheese--not cheddar since I didn't have any--and it was indeed delicious, although I would have added some pepper, which one might not need if using the cheddar. Very nice, pretty and soooooo easy!

This is a must in my house now. The first time I made it I was nervous because the only other time i had tried to make meatloaf it was an epic fail of mass proportions. How does meatloaf never loaf???

This was the simplest recipe. I added in some Italian bread crumbs, extra cheese flake onions, and parsley. Then a bit of Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup mixture. These things are inhaled by all who cross them. I look forward to making them and so do my kids!

My husband loved these!  He is hard to please and likes his country cooking so this are a new staple to our weekly dinners.  I cannot have dairy so I omitted the cheese and used coconut milk in half of these and they still are delicious.

Just perfect, with a few small changes. Add chopped onions to the mix, replace the oatmeal with bread crumbs, and add some onion powder, garlic powder and thyme. I also threw in some jerk spice for good measure!

I will never make meat loaf a different way! These were so moist and flavorful that I didn't even add salt and pepper. This is not like Mamma used to make, it's better.

Great recipe. The first time I made it I accidentally added twice the brown sugar, but that made for a sweet bbq flavor in the sauce.

For super bowl Sunday I molded the meat into football shapes and cut swiss cheese strips for the laces of the ball! They turned out great!!! I would just suggest using tomato sauce (hunts) instead of ketchup for the mixture and to occasionally drain the grease on the pan while cooking.  Put the first mixture together and wait a few minutes to let the oats soak the other ingredients so the loafs don't fall apart !!! All around a yummy recipe!!!!

My kids were very skeptical to try this. My son insisted he wouldn't like it. Well he said he was sorry and that it was pretty good. He ate 2. This was very moist and really easy to make. I'm not a fan of meatloaf. But this was ok. I gave it a 4* because everyone else liked it. Everyone also said the BBQ sauce it makes on the top was a pleasant surprise.

I followed the recipe but added some garlic powder because I've always used it in meatloaf.  We loved the actual meatloaf but thought that 1/4 cup of brown sugar made the topping WAY TOO SWEET.  I will follow the recipe and cut the brown sugar down to 1/8 cup and see if that helps.  Thanks for the recipe; it's a keeper!

This is absolutely the worst meat loaf I've ever tired to eat.  It is so sweet, it's almost like dessert.

Looking for a quick dinner these were perfect! Taste was great and they cooked perfectly. Measured out 8 loaves vs 9 which was fine.  I did add some chopped onion to the meat mixture as I had some to use. Will definitely make these again!

Amazing!  I made them in muffin tins, this recipe made 12 rounds.  Since they were smaller they only had to bake for 30 or so minutes.  We put them on small burger buns to make meatloaf sliders.  Everyone at the cocktail party raved about them.

Excellent, I added onion, garlic and alittle Minute rice. We really like, my husband bragged about the topping. Also with left overs, they would make delicious sandwiches with large buns and veggies!

Great tasting.  I put some dry onion flakes and it tasted great.  I let the oats, cheese milk sit to soak in.  It isn't going to make it any moister than not though.  I added a little extra milk because of dried onion.  The topping a bit too sweet for me though.

We made this tonight for dinner. Hubby says it's excellent . Will definitely put into rotation . Only changes I made was used bread crumbs, instead of oatmeal and baked in muffin tin. Was awesome !!!!!!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is from a 199? Taste of Home Magazine and I make every other week.  Works really well with $3 a pound ground Turkey85-15.
Original title was "little Cheddar Meat loaves". Needs some fat not as good with the ground white turkey.  Have also tried with ground chicken was okay.  Need a snack and have one left in the frig. as an edit It was the 2000 collectors edition. entered by Katy Bowron of Cocolalla,Idaho  she got it from her aunt as a teen.

Sounds good, I will try but with a reduced amount of regular oatmeal (organic) and perhaps some sauteed onion.  Also, I usually use a mini-loaf pan, which works perfectly!

I have been making this for years, my family and friends love it, we call ours "little cheddar meat loaves"
Use Gluten free oats and it's good if you have any celiacs in your family! Pair with mashed potatoes and a vegetable of choice and you have a great anyday meal.

I have always added Brown sugar and Maple flavored oats to my meatloaf and when it is almost cooked I pour a mixture of catsup, Brown sugar and Worcester (I think that's how it's spelt) sauce over top and cook for another 45 mins

The first time I made this recipe, it was too salty for my taste.  I made it again tonight, but this time I didn't add any salt.  I also added some Worcestershire sauce and a little onion and garlic powder.  It was perfect!  I'll definitely be making this again!

Love this recipe! I've made it many times. I find that to satisfy my honey and friends, I need to ad 1/2 to 1 whole onion, depending on the size, a dash of worcestershire, and and extra 1/2 cup of the quick oats.

This recipe was delicious. I used ground turkey, which is what our family usually uses in place of beef.  I doubled recipe and used two muffin pans. baked about 40 mins or less. Instead of oats I used wheat germ or bread crumbs. Kids love these! You can freeze a few if you have space, and take em to work and warm well in microwave.

This is definitely my favorite meatloaf recipe. I use chili sauce instead of making the ketchup topping and its not only easier but i like the flavor even better.  Double the ingredients while you're at it and freeze half. FYI. Line the baking dish with non stick foil. You'll wish you had if you don't.

Fantastic! I sautéed carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in some butter before adding to the meat mixture. I also flavored the meat with seasoning salt and Italian seasoning. I just used a regular meatloaf pan, that was all I had. This dish had so much flavor. I may try substituting turkey next time. My husband loved it too!

I actually made this using Bison Meat.  Something that is leaner with almost no fat.  It was delicious!!  I made a double recipe for just my wife and I thinking I was going to have some for my lunches for the week to follow, I was wrong.  It all went that evening

I have made this numerous times I love it & my husband loves it also. I always add some worstishire sauce (sp? lol) and let the egg milk oats mixture sit for a bit to absorb.  Throw chopped onion in always and bell pepper if its there if not oh well its still delicious.  I shake a lil bit of pepper & garlic powder on before I put the bbq brown sugar sauce over it. Bake it a lil longer if  wish. I like an hour to ensure its well cooked.

Loved this! At the suggestion of other reviews, I used several shakes of worchershire sauce, garlic, and seasoned breadcrumbs instead of oatmeal. Tender and very juicy.

These were great.  We used grass feed 92/8 ratio, and used light brown sugar, everything else was the same.  Made 6 small loaves.  I saw people said their sauce was too sweet, I'm not a sweet lover and I thought this was fine, so if your not a sweet lover, use the light brown sugar like I did.

The texture of this meatloaf is perfection.  I don't make these as mini meatloaves and I add onions and peppers.  My kids do the happy dance and beg for me to cook this.  It's an excellent base for what ever you want to ADD to this recipe to make it your own.  Thank you for this recipe.

Husband picked some of the green bell peppers from our little kitchen garden.  I used this mini-meatloaf recipe to stuff the peppers.  They were a big hit!

Love how easy it is! Used bread crumbs instead of oats, added chopped onion and garlic powder. Next time, I think I'll add in chopped bell peppers for more crunch and a little habanero hot sauce in the topping to add some kick.

I don't understand the love for this recipe. It was too bland to eat. I didn't eat it, but made another batch and added garlic powder, onion powder, more salt and tony chachere's. I guess that's the struggle of finding a good recipe when you're from New Orleans.

This was a great recipe, gobbled up by everyone, even the picky toddler. The only very slight change I made was to use old-fashioned oats, as I didn't have any quick-cooking oats. I also doubled the recipe and froze a pan for later. I'll be interested to see how they taste out of the freezer.

Used breadcrumbs instead of oats.  What I liked the most was baking the meatloaves on a foil lined large rimmed baking sheet so the fat from the ground beef was left on the foil.  The sauce for the topping was tasty!

This recipe was really good! Definitely will eat it again! I think that the sauce was a little to sweet, so it drowned out the taste of the meat.  Maybe you can put less brown sugar in the sauce.

The BBQ sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. I altered it by cutting back on the brown sugar and adding some apple cider vinegar. I also added garlic and onions to the mix. 
I too baked mine in a cupcake pan sprayed with Pam. Overall a great recipe. :)

Made this twice now, second time added some grated onion and let the oat mixture swell before adding the meat which made it less sticky. Third time I might try pork mince with some sage and grated apple. Definitely one for saving.

I absolutely love this recipe, although I make a few adjustments. My son is allergic to oats so I use ritz garlic and pepper crackers instead. I also cut down on the milk and double the sauce because I add some to the meat mixture. I also season my meat as well since I do turkey instead of beef. Other than that, it's been a hit with everyone I have made it for!

I made this recipe as directed. It came out nicely, but the flavor tasted just like a cheeseburger. The bites that had the ketchup sauce were better, but I will be sticking with my old stand-by recipe for meatloaf.

I made these for my family tonight and I have to say it was not a big hit. The sauce is a bit too sweet and cooking it in a pan made it taste very greasy. Next time I will try cutting the brown sugar in half and cooking it on a rack set inside a cake pan so the grease can drip off as it cooks.

This was a decent recipe except the sauce was too sweet. We substituted the oats with bread crumbs and cooked them in a muffin pan. Overall they were good enough to make again except will try less brown sugar next time.

this is  perfect. I  followed  everything almost to a tee. I didn't  have cheddar, so I  used  the  shredded itakian cheese. It  worked  just as well. Even  the sauce  to top it  with is  tasty. I  did  follow a  previous post  about  letting  the oats soak  before adding  the  meat. 
 thanks  for  sharing  your  recipe

This recipe is easy and delicious. I make a big batch of these for easy week night dinners and still-yummy leftovers for my husband to bring to work. Every time I send them to work with him, I have to pack a couple extra because all his buddies want some too. Knowing their love for this meatloaf, I once made about 40 of these for my husband's office pot luck and they were a great choice for feeding a crowd. I was never really a meatloaf fan until I tried this recipe, but these aren't like your mom's meatloaf. They are moist and flavorful and they've become part of our regular rotation.

The only reason I gave it four was because as far as ingredients I added a few of my own! I love veggies. Everything else was as is and it was great only took 30 mins because I used a muffin tin. Enjoy!

I tried this tonight and my husband, daughter and 3 grandsons loved it! I added Worchestershire Sauce, diced onion and diced dill pickles to give it a real tang. I used the muffin tins to bake and doubled the recipe. Now I have enough to freeze for another day. They heated up well in the microwave too. Served with mashed potatoes and veggies it was a real winner. Will make again and again.

I tried this on 11/11/13. My family really enjoyed this recipe!! However, i did not use oats, I used italian bread crumbs instead. I also sauteed onions in butter and minced garlic and added it in the nixtutre. I sprayed pam on the pan and the mini's came out with ease.

My son licked his plate after eating this meatloaf. I made it into one large meatloaf. I decreased the mustard to one teaspoon because he is not a mustard fan. It probably would have been fine with one and a half.

This was a great recipe, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I did give it a little tweak. I wanted to give it a little more seasoning so added minced onion and Italian Seasoning. Other than that I left it alone. My very picky kids loved it!

Awesome recipe.  replaced the oats with ground Dare Autumn harvest crackers.  Used the muffin tins as suggested too.  Only thing is next time I will cut down on the sauce as there was a bit too much of it.

This should definitely go down as a kid friendly recipe. My kids LOVE when I make this. They even ask for it. I'm not sure if its because its "mini" or because it really is delicious (or maybe because it has no onions). I always use oats in my meatloaf, but never cheese. It's a great combination and makes for a wonderful texture. This is definitely an all time fave!

Lovely flavor with my additions for the meat section I followed the same directions except I used: coconut milk, garlic pepper/sea salt, breading Townhouse Mediterranean Herb pita crackers which I had to manually crush up, Worcestershire sauce, sautéd fresh garlic, ginger, and onion w/butter.
Sauce topping all the same expert I used: 1/4 brown sugar
It's very moist and is a hit :))

I followed the recipe exactly. There was way too much of the ketchup mix to spread over the top of the meatloafs, so I wasted quite a bit. Also, the spread didn't carmelize or anything, so it just was heated up sweet ketchup. 

The meatloaf needed more seasonings too, it was pretty bland and I even put in too much salt than the recipe called for.

 

I think the meat needed worcestershire, onions, and other seasonings, and I could do without the spread on top. Just my opinion though.

Tasty enough, but the texture didn't turn out great for me. I cooked them in a muffin tin as some other reviewers did. There was a lot of meat juice running all over and clean up was awful. Not worth it.

EXCELLENT!  But as a rule of thumb, I ALWAYS add 1/2 C of seasoned bread crumbs to any meatloaf recipe.  I think it holds the meat together better!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful and easy recipe!

I'd never tried meatloaf before and a lot of my family had all these horror stories about it from when try were younger. I think some people must use a really bad recipe or just simply bake it terribly. I decided to try this one though because of all the grey reviews and I wanted another beef recipe. I'm so glad I did because now it's one of my favorite meals!! I even cooked it for my mom once and her opinion of meatloaf has since changed and she really liked it as well. Definitely better than any burg :)

I've made this dozens of times and it's always a hit. I use ground turkey meat when I make it. And my hubby loves it when I replace the egg with 1/4 cup mayo. The mayo makes it really moist and it's awesome when reheated the next day in lunches.

I have made this now several times, and my family likes this much more than my "old"recipe, made with bread crumbs.  The Glaze is the Bomb!  I like the no-vinegar glaze recipe...Make double, each batch, or you'll regret it;-) BTW, I always mix the 1 lb. ground beef with another lb. of either ground turkey or ground pork.  (And no cheese in my loafs!)

If this tastes like an oatmeal cookie with meat when you make it, then you are making it wrong.  I just had this for dinner and followed the recipe exactly.  The end result was juicy and delicious mini meatloaves.  I followed the tip of another reviewer and let the oatmeal mixture sit for a while before adding the beef.  The mixture was still wet but the egg kept it together and it turned out fine.  I don't have a cheese shredder so I crumbled slices of cheddar by hand into small chunks and ended up with nice melty chunks in every bite.

Good recipe except when mixing found that the meat was too wet.crushed saltine crackers seemed to do the trick. also used Kraft cheese slices instead of shredded cheese.

So easy and delicious.  I put them in muffin tins, and kept the baking time the same. I added a bit of garlic powder to the meatloaf part. Will be making this again.

Good recipe!  My kids and hubby liked it better than my old recipe.  I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder to season it some.  Love the little loaves....they cook up so much better than 1 large one :)

Great recipe. Easy, low calorie and delicious. It is very wet, so I can't see how it would work without a muffin tin. But it made 8 perfect portions. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, which was great, too.

you really need about 2 1/2 lbs beef.  The oatmeal does not expand enough to make eight loaves.  Surprisingly I didn't have any ketchup so I used Chi Chi's hot salsa and added about a tbs of soy sauce.  I think it added a lot of flavor.

I found the results to be - in a word - DULL.  The oats seem to overwhelm the cheese giving the meat a grainy texture.

And, the "topping" was way too sweet.  

Pass on this recipe.

Very easy and very good.  My 2 year old won't eat meat and LOVED this meatloaf.  I made it as is.  Only change I made was I baked it in 2 mini loaf pans.  Cooked a tad longer but not much.

This meatloaf was delicious.  I shaped it into 6 mini loaves instead of 8.  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the oats.  I also omitted the mustard from the glaze and added a few splashes of Worchestershire sauce.  The meatloaves were moist, but still held together well.  I just baked them on a cookie sheet with edges.  Very flavorful and great leftover too!

I followed the recipe exactly except I ended up with 6 loaves instead of 8. It was easy to mix together and the loaves held together well. The flavor was why I only gave 3 stars. I found the sauce on top to be a bit too sweet and the hamburger seemed a bit bland.

We make this all the time and is the best recipe we've found for meatloaf. Our only change is to sub out the breadcrumbs and replace it with oatmeal; it seems to be moister and hold together that way. We also make this as muffins, which is very popular with the kids!

Have been experimenting for years to find a good meatloaf recipe. This is now my go to recipe. It was very good. The only thing I added was a little bit of onion powder. Next time I think I will let the oats sit in the milk for a few minutes before adding the ground beef. I was a little skeptical when I made the loaves because they seemed very WET, but they came out perfectly!

Very very good.  I sauteed 1 small onion and added that to meat mixture. I used 1/2 cup crushed Ritz crackers instead of Oats (what I had on hand) I used a pork/beef mix for meat.  I added about 1 1/2 T of Worcestershire sauce.  I left the brown sugar out of the topping mix. I put into muffin tins and baked about 25 mins.  They were fantastic.  Will make over and over.  Will try to incorporate more vegetable into saute mix next time.

Followed the recipe but added a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder for extra flavor. Soaked the oatmeal in milk and egg as others suggested. Made mini loaves in a muffin tin and topped with sauce the last 15 minutes. Added chopped onion to my loaves but left out of the other loaves for the picky eaters. Turned out great and just the right amount of sweetness!

Love, love, love this recipe! The cheese completely disappears, but makes the meat so tender and moist! Used crushed buttery crackers instead of the oatmeal. I didn't use the topping. I just put straight ketchup on top of my loaf, BBQ on my dad's, and nothing on my mom's. All came out excellent and exactly how each of us wanted. I use the disposable foil "mini loaf" pans that you are supposed to bake little cakes in. Cook on a rack, on a pan with sides. During the last 5 minutes of baking, I stab holes through the foil pans and let the grease drain out. Perfect!

So Good!  I screwed up when reading the recipe so I just put everything in the meatloaf and didn't realize I was supposed to save some items for the top.  I used some Ritz Bits crackers that had cheese inside instead of oats.  I just crushed them up.  Used steak sauce instead of brown sugar, mixed it with the mustard and ketchup. But, even with my screw up it was delish!  I also used muffin tins.  I think I will do that from now on!

This was an easy recipe to whip up. I made a few adjustments based on what I had in the fridge. I took others suggestions and made this in a cupcake tin. Awesome idea!! I also added 1/4 cup of onions and two cloves of garlic, both chopped finely. It turned out beautifully and I will definitely make it again.

I was wanting to make mashed potatoes and I was thinking about what main dish to have with the mashed potatoes. I thought that meatloaf would be perfect, but I had yet to find a recipe I liked. This meatloaf is AMAZING. My husband and I both loved it. I did substitute bread crumbs for the oats and added a chopped white onion and green pepper. I also used a muffin pan to make 24 mini loaves with the same cooking time. They came out PERFECT! SO TASTY!!! =)

I made this recipe as it was written...no modifications except that I have a huge bag of mexican cheese I use in place of cheddar in all of my recipes so that's it.  This recipe is DELICIOUS!!!! I made it last week and my husband and kid keep asking for it.  My kids wanted seconds.  Oh I did use the splenda brown sugar so I did change that too, but that didn't even make or break it.  This meal is delicious and you won't regret it.   YUM!!!!

These were very good.  I made it exactly as shown.  It was a hit with my picky eaters, especially the ketchup/brown sugar topping. No one could even tell that it had oatmeal in it.  Next time I try it, I will add some onion and a few more spices for a little more flavor.

These bake nicely in the oven and hold together well. We loved the texture and flavor.
Like other reviewers suggested, I made these in muffin tins instead. Very easy! I was able to make 10 mini loaves that way. Beware hamburger grease bubbling over the edge and down into your oven, though. Next time I will put the muffin tin on a large cookie sheet with a lip to it.
I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because we thought the ketchup "glaze" was way too sweet. I think the brown sugar could could be drastically reduced, or even eliminated. So next time, I will experiment with that.

Great Meatloaf recipe!  I did add some chopped onion, a bit of garlic powder and a little worchester sauce to give a bit more flavor.  Was not sure how I would feel about the cheese...Loved it!  Baked in Muffin pan, great for leftovers, easily packs in lunches.

Delicious! Made it with garlic mashed potatoes and my husband did not put down his fork till the plate was cleared.
 I also used cupcake pan instead of individually shaping the mini meatloaves, made it so much easier to handle and it turned out great.

Great recipe!  Easy to follow and make, especially for someone like me who is starting to cook a little more (now that I'm married).

I had all the ingredients.  Simple instructions.  And it turned out GREAT!

My husband really enjoyed it so it's going into the recipe box as a keeper.

Made these last night and they were truly amazing and super easy to make.  I was worried about how the oatmeal would taste with it, but i found that it probably made them very moist.  The sauce on the top was delish.  They cooked in 45 minutes so therefore i used that time to prepare a few other side dishes and had dinner ready in an hour on a weeknight!!!

Excellent!  Of course I can't ever leave a recipe alone so what I did was substitue the 1tsp salt with 1tsp garlic salt; added one chopped onion; one chopped bellpepper.  I also followed the suggestions and let the oats soak in the egg/milk mixture for about 10 minutes to help make it firmer.  It was so good I was unable to have any leftovers for cold meatloaf sandwiches the next day (the horror!). Next time I will make double recipe so I have leftovers for sandwiches.

Normally I hate meatloaf, but this has changed all my thoughts on meatloaf! It was really moist and flavorful, and the glaze was tangy/sweet. Adding the oats instead of bread or bread crumbs is such a great change. Things I did differently after reading comments: let the wet mixture sit for a while before adding the meat so that the oats can soak up the moisture, add a little bit of garlic pepper, use dijon mustard, add a splash of worcestershire sauce to the glaze. I made one loaf rather than mini loaves. After 45 min I dumped out the fatty liquid at the bottom of the pan and popped the loaf back in the oven for an extra 20 minutes. My brother came out just for a taste test, but thought it was delicious so he kept eating more!

It was quick and easy, but the texture was really off. Also, it was surprisingly bland. But maybe I'm being to harsh.

Found this recipe yesterday and gave it a try.  My family loved it!  The brown sugar was a little sweet so maybe a little less, but it was really wonderful and moist!  In fact, suprisingly, my super picky husband has asked that I make it again tonight!  I've doubled the recipe and it's in the oven now!  Loved it!

This was absolutely delicious! I added 1 Tbsp. of Italian seasoning, and shaped as a single loaf, other than that I left it as is. This was so moist and full of flavor my family of 5 begged me to double the recipe next time so there would be seconds. This is going in my go to dinner file for sure!

My family loves this recipe.  I've made it with the cheddar and also with mozzarella.  Both are excellent.  I usually just make one big loaf instead of multiple small ones. It's moist and it doesn't fall apart!

This is the only meatloaf recipe I use anymore.  I use cracker crumbs instead of oatmeal and I chop up a small can of mushrooms too.  I ususally make a triple batch and then freeze them 2 to a bag and freeze  them.  Perfect for my husband to grab a bag for lunch.

This was a nice recipe, the only thing I found was that the mixture for the meat was a bit too runny. Next time I'll reduce the amount of milk and give a try. I also didn't add the salt. I rarely if at all add salt into my meals, so it was automatically taken out. This is a keeper, that's for sure

This recipe is PERFECT! I didn't need to make any changes to the recipe. With the leftover, try mini meat loaf melt sandwich. I melt a slice of Swiss or provolone cheese on top of meat loaf with pan-buttered toasts, like grilled cheese. YUM!

THIS WAS THE MOST AWESOME MEATLOAF RECIPE EVER!!  The only change that I did was to wrap them in three slices of bacon each before I put on the sauce. 5 stars all the way.

Absolutely delicious!!  My husband AND toddler loves them... I just add some fresh onion, garlic and parsley to the mix and they turn out great.  We've always used breadcrumbs before so I figured I'd give oatmeal a go and I'm so glad I did.

Honestly the best meatloaf I've ever had and my friends agreed. Just subbed in rolled oats because it's all I had and added half of a chopped onion.

I thought it was too sweet.  But, that is my preference.  Just cut back on the brown sugar.  Thanks!

Wow now this is the kind of recipe I've been looking for! Super easy and absolutely delicious!!  The only additions I made were a lil onion soup mix, garlic powder, and black pepper. And I'll make a lil more sauce next time it was so good. 5 stars all the way!

LOVE THESE! I've made these several times now and they always turn out great. I'm not a meat loaf fan, but my husband loves it so I had been looking for a recipe I could tolerate. These definitely exceeded my expectations. I used a suggestion by another user and put them into a muffin pan. Works perfectly, they stay together, and I don't have to touch the meat because I can just spoon them in. I added a little bit of dried onion and maybe extra cheese sometimes, but other than that all the ingredients were the same. Definitely a favorite in our house.

Absolutely delish!  I'm not a fan of heavy, dense meatloaf and this was the opposite of that.  The oats give it a melt in your mouth texture.  The only changes I made was that I added some pepper, fresh garlic and raw, finely chopped onion.  I recommend letting the mixture sit for about 15 minutes after incorporating all the ingredients as it seemed quite runny at first, then the oats kinda sucked up the moisture.  Next time I will cut the sauce ingredients in half as it made way too much.  I also used muffin tins and cooked for the same amount of time as the recipe stated.  Yummy!

I followed directions... but Used 1 lb pork instead of beef, added 1/2 red onion, and some parsley. I used a 4 mini-loaf pan for individual sized loaves. What a fun way to eat it! the sweetemed sauce on top was pretty tasty..but i must have left out some salt, because without the sauce, It would have had little to no taste! next time i would add more salt, and garlic powder... if i decide to try again.

These were good, next time I will add fine chopped onion and some garlic. I had to improvise the sauce, didn't realize I ran out of ketchup. I used tomatoe paste, a little extra sugar, salt, pepper, garlic. the sauce was great still.

I am ALWAYS looking for a new meatloaf recipe and let me just say, I will look no more!!!  This is the best meatloaf I have ever eaten!  It's the perfect balance of sweet and meaty.  I did what another viewer did and baked it in a muffin pan and ended up with 11 minis.  I also need to say that my husband is really the cook of the house.  He's terrific.  He took one bite, looked at me and said "This is REALLY good".  He wouldn't stop commenting on it.

This makes 12 mini muffins if you use a standard muffin pan.  Add 1/4 cup to each muffin.  I used a meatloaf meat mix from the grocery store and it was great.  I had to decrease the bake time to about 37 minutes.  Great recipe.

pretty incredible.   i followed the advice of previous reviewers and let the wet ingredients sit with the oats for a minute or two before adding the meat.  then i separated it into cupcake pans.   i added 1/4 cup diced onion, 1/4 cup chopped mushrooms, 1 tspn cardamom and 1/2 tspn black pepper.  i saved some of the sauce topping until it had about 10 minutes left to bake and then basted the tops again.  the sweet and savory together were awesome, totally a keeper.

I agree - easy and quick!  I wanted a dinner I could make quickly and then leave for awhile to cook while I got some other things done, so I tried this.  I was hurrying, so I just went with the full recipe as is and it was GREAT!!  I probably wouldn't use as much ketchup/brown sugar next time, but that's just me.  My kids actually ate it (who usually don't care for much meat) and once they tried it, actually liked it.  :)  I also used ground turkey because we rarely do beef.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I don't even like meatloaf and this was DELICIOUS!  Great texture and tangy flavor.  I made it in muffin tins and even my kids enjoyed it.  I will definitely make this again.  Easy and tasty!

We Loved this!  I added Stuffing Mix from box instead of the Oats (same measurement).  When we made the loaves we indented a small round valley for the sauce.

I haft to omit something..... I am not the best meatloaf cooker.  Normally I try too hard to hide fresh veges in them for more nutrition.  But, tonight I made this meatloaf and all I can say is I redeemed myself with this recipe!! My husband and 3 teens ate a second helping of it and said this is really good. I am so excited. This recipe is a keeper.  
I used tillamook cheddar cheese, sprinkle Parmesan, a little soy sauce, wicheshier sauce (sp?), onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and and a couple of sprinkles  of roasted chipotle hot sauce and gourmet hamburger meat seasoning.  The amounts to my liking.  mixed with egg, milk and meat. Formed individual loafs and cooked till the center was stiff about 40 minutes. 

The oatmeal makes this recipe so good!

I followed the previous comments and let the oats soak but this still came out runny with one pound of ground beef.  I added some Italian bread crumbs and only divided into four loaves and it turned out great.  In the future I plan on adding 1.5 - 2 pounds of ground beef AND some worcestershire since this recipe is still a keeper!

I made this recipe exactly as shown and even doubled it.  The ground meat I used was 85/15.
I couldn't believe how good it was without the usual onions etc....  I wouldn't change a thing.  Plus I think it is always good to make it the way stated first, then get creative if not like you want it.  So good!!!!!!!  I also used a mini loaf pan.  Made 8 loafs.

This is the only meatloaf recipe I use. Delicious! I use a "meatloaf mix" (veal, pork and beef I think) of meat instead of straight ground beef and I cut down the brown sugar by just a bit. I've used a taco-spiced blend of cheddar cheese if it's the only thing I have on hand and it always comes out great. Sometimes I'll chop up leftovers and throw it in spaghetti sauce for the next night's dinner. Love this recipe!

Loved this recipe! Husband especially loved the sauce on top. Even my two very discerning toddlers ate every bite and asked for more! My only change was adding chopped onion. I agree that there is too much milk as the meatloaf was a little on the mushy side, but that may also be because of the added moisture from the onion. I will definitely be making this one again!

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!  I am not a big meat loaf person but I LOVED this! I didnt make the mini meat loaves I just made one big one.  The sauce that goes on top is what makes this so good!  It sweet and so very yummy.  I will def recommend this recipe and use it again

I used saltine crackers instead of oats.  Baked in oven for the time listed then turned to 250 for an hour until Troy got home from golf.  He really liked them.

I soaked the oats in the milk while mincing an onion and preparing other ingredients. I made it into 3 loaves and cooked it for 45 mins. Temp reached 165, so I took it out and covered with foil until rest of meal was ready. I put the ketchup sauce on too thick. Didn't need all of it. Husband thought it tasted like McDonald's, which he said wasn't a bad thing. I like how moist/soft it was. Toddler liked it too.

The kids LOVE this meatloaf. And the idea of using a muffin pan to cook the mini meatloaves is a great idea! I have made this several times and it is always a big hit.

Excellent recipe!  Easy, tasty and NOT greasy. I've used other meatloaf recipes on here before and this is by far the best. My picky husband and pickier mother-in-law both approved...although she  whispered.."needs garlic". She has to find something! Everyone else loved them. I didn't change a thing.

This is an amazing recipe. I only subtracted some mustard since my husband doesn't like mustard too much. It converted me to loving meatloaf. I make it in regular size pans and we make this ever sunday after church. I use leftovers for sandwiches. Oh and I also double the recipe for the sauce since I can't get enough of it. Yum! Thank you Tonya. I don't know where I would be. It's so easy and cheap to make!

Loved how easy this was.  I was lazy and just put in 2 medium bread pans.  Baked for 40 minutes, turned off the oven and went trick or treating.  We came home to yummy warm meatloaf that was moist and tasty.  I like that it uses oats instead of breadcrumbs.

I was skeptical when it comes to meatloaf. But this recipe was SO easy, quick and the end result was delicious. I followed it exactly as written and was delighted with the result. The meat was tender. The topping is so delicious. Even better, my very picky son ate it up and asked for seconds. I'll be making this again!

This is my husband's most requested recipe.  These meatloaves are moist, flavorful, and delicious.  I make a little extra topping because that's his favorite part of them.  Will not ever use a different meatloaf recipe.

I thought this meatloaf was great with the exception of the super sweet ketchup glaze. Substituted turkey for beef, added lipton onion mix to the turkey for flavor, eliminated the salt (already present in soup mix), and used old fashioned oats. The meatloaf was moist and delicious. Next time I will use half the brown sugar.

These are outstanding!  I have been looking for a great meatloaf recipe and finally found a "keeper"!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added onion and garlic powder and it was perfect :)  I will definitely do it that way in the future.  Thank you for such a easy and yummy recipe!!!!!!

I thought these had very good flavor and were nice and moist.  It was nice to have them in individual portions to better control calorie count.  I really enjoyed the sweet sauce that covered the beef.

I've made this several times for my family... the non meat eating toddler DEVOURS this!  The ketchup topping makes way too much in my opinion; I usually half that part.  I use regular rolled oats and just let the mix sit for a few minutes to soften them.  I love that it's oats (a whole grain) rather than overprocessed breadcrumb 'filler'.  YUM!

Quick and easy to make...I added a medium chopped onion and a little bit of garlic powder.  I also backed these in a large muffin tin and sprayed with nonstick.  These were very tasty....the sauce really made the mini loaf.

These were good!  I didn't give it 5 stars because they had a rather strong oatmeal flavor.  AND I added 1 1/2 lbs of gr. beef b/c that's what size package I had.  I'll make these again, but cut back on the oatmeal - perhaps 1/4 cup. I love the little portions for this recipe - I froze the leftover for another dinner.  I love it when that happens!

A very yummy recipe. I made some changes so thats why I only gave 4 stars. I added about 3/4 cup of minced onion and about 5 garlic cloves (I LOVE garlic), reduced the salt by 1/2 and added in some Mrs. Dash. I only used 1/2 the amt of brown sugar and it was perfect. Baked at 365 for 45 min instead of  350. Even my picky 2 y/o ate it! Great with mashed potatoes.

flavor was good, texture was on the gummy side.  Maybe it was the chopped meat I used, I had 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground chuck.  Won't make it again.

Yum, yum... This is my first time making this recipe and I must say it has been one of the best meatloaf recipes I've tried. I did put a little sweet and spicy sauce in with the sauce mixture which added a little tang. Other than that I just doubled the recipe and used my Pampered Chef 4-Loaf Stoneware cooking it for 50 minutes and it turned out yummy. Everyone loved it! I will definitely make this one again!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I did it exactly as the recipe said except I added some finely chopped onion for flavor and used shredded colby/jack instead of the cheddar (cheddar was a little too potent for this recipe for me).  It was SO GOOD.  Everyone had seconds and thirds!  I was glad I made a double batch!  Even my 22 month old ate two pieces himself!  I baked mine on a stone (with rims) and it cooked perfectly!  That way it wasn't sitting in its own oils and grease.  I've made this several times now and it's always a family favorite (even for my non-meatloaf eating relatives).

Great!  My daughter, who never, ever would eat meatloaf tried these and LOVED them. Now I have to make them once a week.  The only thing I do different from the original recipe is - I use half and half instead of milk.  We love the richness it adds.

I love this recipe!  I have made this over and over again and have passed this on to family and friends!  The only thing that I have done differently as changed by another user, is to cook them in a muffin pan instead of the mini loaf pans.  They turn out great and the kids love the smaller size just for them!  This recipe is one of the best meatloaf recipes I have ever made!

We LOVE these and have made them several times.  We bake them in muffin trays.  They are so easy to make & taste really good.

It was soggy you need to add bread crumbs or more oats and less sauce.

Great recipe!  The only change I made to it was that I used yellow mustard instead of prepared mustard, and I also used 1/3 c. ketchup & 1/3 c. honey bbq sauce.  It made the sauce delicious!!  I also added 1/2 of an onion for taste.  I would recommend this to anyone!!  It was really fast to prepare and minimal dishes to clean.  :-)

My husband said this was the best meatloaf that I have ever made.  I made it with ground turkey and just used a little less mustard in the topping.  So easy.  I was worried that the mix was so moist so I added a little more oatmeal (used old fashion) and it turned out to be a nice moist meatloaf.

Very tasty.  DH liked as is, I thought perhaps a bit sweet on top, not what I would call tangy but sweet.  Very cute presentation.  I liked the idea of the muffin tins, but dislike the idea of cleaning them, so I placed 6 loaves in an 8x8 (?) and had one leftover that I will fry up as a burger.  Thanks for sharing.

Oatmeal & cheese really?.. Thats what I thought when I read this but WOW it was really good meatloaf I did let the egg, milk & cheese soak for a few minutes with the oats before I mixed in the meat I added a bit of grated onion, red pepper flakes & minced garlic as well... It was soooo good & moist & held together so nicely I got 5 decent sized loafs out of about 1 1/2lbs of beef!! The only reason I gave this recipe a 4 star rating is because of the sauce was the only thing me & my boyfriend didnt care for to much next time will cut the brown suger in half it was just a bit to sweet for our taste buds!! But the meatloaf was DELICIOUS this is a keeper for me for sure!! Thanks!!

I've tried many meatloaf recipes from this site and will not try another one.  This recipe was perfect.  My 12 year old HATES meatloaf and enjoyed this one.  I put them in muffin pans as other reviewers suggested, but that was the only change I made.  Delicious!

The recipe was delicious but of course I tweaked it. I added diced onion, garlic powder, some adobo seasoning, and oregano to the meat mixture as well. As for the ketchup topping I used spicy mustard and Worchestershire sauce. My husband and I loved it!!!!

I don't know if it is the oatmeal or cheese that makes this so good.  We love it and won't make our old recipe for meatloaf ever again.

This is definitely an easy and good recipe that reheats well, and the sauce is good. But not my idea of a great meatloaf. I'll have to experiment more with this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly. Like another reviewer mentioned the mixture seemed really wet.  I baked the balls in a round pie pan (that fits in my toaster oven) so the sauce covered every inch of them. I accidentally left mine in the oven for an hour after it turned off and I used extra lean ground beef....and it was still moist. The best part is I can freeze the leftovers and they won't look like the remains of a meal.  I will definitely make again and try some other sauce/cheese combos.  Next time...monterrey jack and salsa version.

Love this recipe especially since me and my husband aren't meatloaf lovers!  My 2 yo gobble it up!  I've done it twice, this time I used a bit of chili sauce and reduce the amount of ketchup plus I had fresh coriander so I put it in and it gave it a little zing!

Yummy!!!  I just tried this recipe for the first time and I must say it doesn't disappoint.  The only change I made was that I used a blend of Colby, Cheddar & Monteray Jack Cheeses and I cooked in a muffin tin.  This recipe is a definate keeper!

Only substitution I made was to use ground turkey, everything else was exactly as written.  My entire family loved them, and most importantly my 4 and 2 year old gobbled them up and ate leftovers the next day.  Oh, and I did bake them in a muffin pan for mini meatloaves.  I think I cooked them just about 1/2 hour but not positive.  Definately making these again.

Fantastic! The only change I made was coffee cream instead of milk ( only dairy I had at the time). I'm not sure if it was because of the extra fat that it turned out to have a really silky texture. My 13 month old devoured it, and hates the texture of meat! FYI leftovers turned into patty melts also amazing.

This was great, and really simple. My only recommedation would be to use a low fat ground beef. My baking dish was completely covered in fat from the meat and kept the meatloaves from getting crispy edges.

Outstanding easy weeknight recipe! I had to make a last-minute substitution - didn't have oats, so I used shredded bread that was past its prime. The meatloaves turned out great, and both my husband and my 7-year-old gobbled theirs up. It took under 5 minutes to put together and I was able to run out for an errand while my husband baked it ... now that's an easy recipe. Also, the sauce on top is the perfect complement to the meat.

I followed recipe exactly, I thought it was pretty good, as good as meatloaf can get, my kids didn't like it at all, they ate half and scraped sauce off. I think I will just give up on making meatloaf :)

I made this recipe, adding only a little garlic and chili powder.  My son doesn't like anything that resembles barbeque sauce, so I went a little easy on the topping (only 3 t of brown sugar to 1/2 c of ketchup and none of the mustard). And I made a single loaf in a casserole dish rather than the mini loaves. I have always used oats in my meatloaf but I hadn't added cheese. As other reviewers have said, the texture is very good. My son STILL scraped the topping off but we all enjoyed the meatloaf.  I think most people would eat this even if they don't like meatloaf because it doesn't have the usual onions and peppers, which many may not like. I will definitely make it again and pass it along.

This was fantastic!!! I made it with ground turkey meat and added garlic and onion powder.  Everyone loved it! I was skeptical about the glaze, but it absolutely made the meal. Finicky family members especially liked it!!! THANK YOU for such a great recipe. :)

I made these meatloaves and they were so great.  My husband is very picky so I didn't tell him that cooking oats was an ingredient until after he complimented me the great taste.  He even put one in a container to take to work the next day.  Great recipe and I'll definitely make this again.

I made this for dinner two nights ago. It was very good but after making it I would make a few changes. I seasoned the meat with onion powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, rosemary, thyme, black pepper and sazon. This gave the meat a great flavor.... If I didnt do this I know I would have been disappointed. Also, next time I will either increase the oatmeal or decrease the milk. The meatloaves were too mushing for my mom and I's taste (even though I let the mixture set for more than 10 minutes as some said) but the little sauce on top was wonderful. I made this with some mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. It was a great dinner. Thanks for the recipe.

These were yoummy and I'll definately go back for more. I tried baking in muffin tins as others suggested and won't do that again as I'm pretty lazy and washing all those little cups was a pain. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will follow the recipe and just shape in mini loves. I absolutely loved the topping!

These turned out perfect just like the picture shows!  If it did not turn out like it shows, you must have done something wrong. I doubled the recipe and only added a little minced onion because we like onions.  The sauce was perfect and the oatmeal was great!  It did not tast like an oatmeal cookie at all.  I normally add either crackers or oatmeal to my regular meatloaf, but with the cheese, it wass awesome. I will make these again and again! Thank you!

This is definitely my favorite meatloaf recipe.  The only addition I made was to add chopped onions and I made it into one large meatloaf.  Next time, I might use a bit less of the sauce.  Everyone loved it!   Excellent meatloaf!

I have been making these for years and they are a favorite. My sister has the recipe too, and makes them all the time. My son recently married and when I went to visit him, he begged me to make these and give the recipe to his wife. A favorite in my family.

This was really good. I added diced green peppers,diced onion and also a little liquid smoke and they turned out great. My family loves the green peppers and liquid smoke taste. Thanks for sharing your recipe Tonya! Will be making these again soon.

I got the recipe from Taste of Home magazine several years ago and it's been a family favorite ever since.  I usually double the recipe (minus sauce) and freeze half for later.

I have been making this meatloaf recipe for years and years, my family loves it. I leave out the mustard (our family preference) but otherwise its a great recipe and the glaze is amazing. Makes great meatloaf and cheese grilled sandwiches the next day. It is in my family recipe rotation of favorites.

This recipe was great.  Using the oats were so much better than bread crumbs both for texture and taste.  I took the advice of an earlier poster and sprayed a muffin pan then made the mini loaves in that.  A great benefit of doing it that way was that I didn't have to drain off any grease.  All my boys (husband and sons) couldn't get enough.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great!  Thanks so much!  I added some sauteed onions and Worcestshire sauce and only 1/2 the salt (as others mentioned doing); I used Old Fashioned Oats instead of the quick cooking; I replaced the Ketchup with Chili Sauce to help counter the sweet of the brown sugar, and I used Dijon mustard.  The family was very pleased and asked for it to go into our regular meal rotation!

Tried this and thought it was good but the ketchup/brown sugar topping was way too sweet.  Will make again but either cut back or eliminate brown sugar.  Otherwise great recipe, easy to make and came out just like the photos posted for this recipe (which is not always the case).

Very nice...unfortunately forgot to spread sauce on the meatloaves prior to oven. Only remembered near end - did it then. Regardless, they tasted great. Great with mashed potatos and green/yellow beans.

My family loved this recipe.  Infact, I had to make two more batches, one for my house, and the other for my inlaws.  I added a 1/2 tbl. of cinnamon to the sauce.  It was very delightful.  I will be making this again in the near future.

Absolute 5 star keeper!! My 2 picky eaters (1 & 3 year old boys) both gobbled it up and I really liked it too.  Some notes: the mix seemed VERY wet and I was really worried, but the finished/cooked product was perfect.  I made them the size that seemed right, which ended up making 6 loaves - perhaps they were larger than called for b/c I needed to cook them 10 minutes longer.  I broiled them for the last 5 minutes.  Per other reviews, I also eyeballed in some garlic power and Worcestershire sauce.  Sooooo delicious, thanks for posting!!

This got so many good reviews, so I was expecting better.  It's all right, but not great.  I'll be trying a different recipe next time.

I LOVE this recipe.  Quick - Easy - Flavorful.  I usually double the recipe for sandwiches the next day.  Sometimes I substitute tomato sauce for the ketchup.  Excellent.  Thanks for sharing.

Holy smokes, this recipe is insanely good! I used a Mexican cheese mix instead of purely cheddar. Not sure if it made any difference, but the cheese in the meatloaves really put it over the top.

Easy, delicious and cute!  I didn't have quick cook oats, so I used rolled oats instead.  I let the oats soak in the milk while I got everything else ready.  I chopped up some onion and garlic to add to the meatloaves, along with some fresh ground black pepper.  I cut the salt down to only 1/2 tsp - it was plenty.  I formed them into 4 loaves, so there was one loaf per serving.  The sauce is perfect as written!

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!! I was really unsure of the milk in this, but tried it anyway....and I think it needed it. I also used 1 1/2lbs of ground beef, and used mozzarella cheese instead of chedder(don't like cheese very much). I also put it in cupcake pans, sprayed it with PAM, it made 12 mini meatloaves.  I loved the sauce, I did put the mustard in, but I will eliminate that next time, ( I also put a little bit of butter in the brown sugar and microwaved it for 20 seconds and then mixed with the ketchup.)  However it was VERY greasy, in the pan! Trying to get it out of the pan w/out the grease splattering as kinda hard.   But overall, I will deft make this one again!

This recipe is fabulous!!!!!!  My kids (4 and 6) love it too, and they aren't huge meat eaters.  I changed the recipe a bit and added stuffing (stove top) instead of the cooking oats.  I add the stove top in uncooked.

AWESOME! who thought meatloaf could taste this good. I added 1/2 cup chopped red onion to meat, and 1 1/2 tbsp honey to sauce, and it was mouth watering! Leftovers were just as good.

So easy and comes out perfect every time.  What else can a busy Mom ask for!  As others have suggested I usually fill-up about 10 cupcake tins sprayed with PAM and still cook at 350 for 45 minutes.  Everyone in the family loves it!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I made it for my family and it was gone in moments... I made more three days later and the same thing happened. I don't particularly care for meat but with the cheese, oatmeal, and glaze it is edible completely on its own. I didn't even have to go out and buy special ingredients... everything I needed was already in the house!

These were easy to make and pretty good.  I took the suggestion of putting them in in a muffin pan and that worked pretty good.  I agree about the sauce being very sweet.  I would cut down on the brown sugar next time.  I thought they were pretty soft and moist, so next time I will add about a half a pound of sausage for flavor and consitency.

This was the BEST recipe I have ever used for meatloaf! The recipe for the sauce can be used for any meat, especially on the grill. I couldn't stop talking about how good dinner was! SOLD! This is definitely a repeat.

The best review comes from my kids.  They devour this meatloaf and take leftovers to lunch the next day!  The only change I make is that I use lean/organic ground turkey.  Still tastes excellent!

BEST MEATLOAF EVER!! I followed advice of some others and used a muffin pan (sprayed with Pam!) and made mini loaves. They were great!! I didn't expect to like the sauce much because of the mustard... but glad I left it in because it was great!!

Yummy! Got great compliments on this recipe. Used bread crumbs instead of cooking oats with lean ground beef (I let the bread crumbs soak in milk then add rest of the ingredients). Also added small chopped onion, splash of worchester sauce, about 1tsp each of black pepper and garlic powder to ground beef, mixed it first then add it to the rest of the ingredients. Made 6 small loaves. Ate it as a sandwich, yummy!

I substituted tomato sauce with 1T worcestershire sauce, and a pinch of sugar for the ketchup.  This makes it less sweet which suits our family better.  I also form them in muffin cups.  LOVE this recipe!

These are great.  The secret to not having the mix too runny is to let the oatmeal soak up the milk before you add everything else.  For the otpping we use BBQ sauce rather than ketchup, which is just based on our families preference.

Delicious! Made with 1 1/2lbs of beef, but otherwise stayed true to recipe. Baked the loaves in 4 mini tin loaf pans, for the perfect size.

Never had a better meatloaf.  The oats are what did it.  I wish I had added a dash or two of hot sauce to the glaze but my 2 year old would be eating it.  I used bison.  I can't say enough, it was delicious.

i used silicone muffin liners - way easier to clean!  i made the sauce a little sweeter and didn't use the mustard. i also did not use cheese or the oats, instead i used bread crumbs and seasonings. the last time i put the cheese in - it made a huge gooey mess

I have made this recipe several times, and it is always delicious exactly as written! The best part for us is that I almost always have all the ingredients on hand.

These are the best meatloafs I have ever had. I added a little garlic and onion powder.  Added a half a chopped onion and a dash of Worcesteshire. Will definitely be making these again. Awesome

A new family favorite.  I make it a couple times a month.  I did add the onions and a little garlic powder as suggested by others .  It is delicious either way.

these were very simple and easy! I made them in my jumbo muffin tins, they had to bake a little longer but they were very tasty. I would use less brown sugar next time. I didn't like how sweet the sauce was.

These were great.  Ground up the oatmeal in mini-food processor to disguise it somewhat from DH.  Made in muffin tins as suggested by Catalogrrr.  Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe. It didn't make 8 loafs for me though. I had about 5 mini loafs. The cheese and oats really make the recipe.

These turned out great.  My husband will tolerate meatloaf on occasion and said he these were the best we've had.  Used regular bbq sauce instead of the ketchup mix.

I had no problem with the seasoning or the oats in this recipe.  I should have used more beef, however, as they were tiny.  I used my mini loaf pan and it only made 4.  Otherwise it was a good recipe.

Hm I'll agree with other people about the oats - they really weirded me out, and I soaked them for a while as someone suggested!  I thought it came out moist but the glaze was too sweet and there just wasn't enough flavor in the meatloaf.  With some seasonings, this would probably be a great recipe.  Maybe some Italian breadcrumbs.  Looooved the idea of the mini meatloaves though!  Served with mashed potatoes and corn.

These were great! Super easy to put together, and they tasted wonderful.  They are the perfect size for making individual freezer meals too. I will be making these again for sure.

My whole family loved this recipe. My son practically inhaled his and even my picky 4-year-old ate some. I'm not a big meatloaf fan, but I thought this was very tasty. We'll definitely have this again.

These were not bad.  We liked how the mini loaves turned out, but we all thought the glaze was way to sweet.  I will make these again but use plain ketchup like with my regular meatloaf.

My usual meatloaf recipe is delicious but very time consuming. This looked quick and easy so I thought I'd try it out. I used crushed saltines instead of oatmeal, otherwise I followed the recipe. My 8 year old helped, she basicly made this herself, so that tells you how easy it is. I thought they tasted pretty good. When we make them again I'll substitue the mustard with a little vinegar. I didn't really like the yellow mustard taste in the glaze and my other meatloaf recipe uses vinegar in the glaze and it's really good.

I added my own spices but other than that followed the recipe It turned out really good a little bit more mushy then I like but I dont think I had quite a pound of beef. I also think i would make less sauce I didnt use all of it and It was a little on the sweet side. I like the muffin pan idea it worked out great.

I made these with ground turkey and despite being my first ever attempt at making meatloaf they were pretty tasty. I did make the following changes: I added diced onion and green pepper to the ground turkey. I mixed the mustard in with the meat and used tomato sauce instead of ketchup to cut some of the sugar. They turned out very moist and had good flavor. Next time I think I am going to add more veggies.

This recipe is excellent, especially the sauce.  Instead of making mini meatloaves, I spread the meat out in a pie pan and I used honey dijon mustard.  I left it out for my fiance and he ate more than half the pan before I got home!

Made this recipe today...I modified it...of course, I doubled the meat, I used 1 cup of cheddar cheese, used 1 cup of bread crumbs instead of oatmeal, cut back the milk to about 1 cup for the amount of meat I used. And I added a package of Lipton beefy onion soup and about 1/3 cup finely chopped onion. Not too much modification huh?! But, overall, they turned out pretty good :) Give it a go...really easy and tasty

This recipe is easy and delicious. I used a muffin pan, like some of the other reviewers and it worked nicely. One important change I made was using Heinz Chili Sauce (which is so delicious) with the brown sugar and mustard instead of ketchup. I also used ground turkey, because that's what I had on hand, instead of ground beef. Very nice flavor. This one is a keeper.

3.5 I made it as directed, except in a muffin pan. I used another reviewer's tip of letting the oatmeal/milk mix sit for a bit to soak up some slushiness.  The sauce was WAY too sweet, I would definitely cut back on the sugar! It also lacked spice, I will definitely add onion and spices if I make again.

This was delicious!  I however, did not use quick cook oats, rather regular old fashioned oats and soaked them in hot water for about 5 minutes. Perfect and my husband loved it.

Made this last night and it was excellent. I made a few changes: I put it in a loaf pan instead of mini loaves, so I halved the glaze and I baked it for an hour instead of 45 minutes. I also found the mixture to be extremely wet, so I added another 1/2 cup of Oatmeal (making the total Oatmeal 1 cup) and it was perfect. Husband loved it, and is already planning meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers. This will be added to our permanent rotation!

I excluded the mustard and added some pepper, some onion powder and garlic powder. Really good. Oh and I actually used turkey instead of ground beef and thought it still tasted wonderful. Served with green beans sauteed with garlic and some roasted red potatoes. Yummy :)

this was good, not great. i used muffin tins like others suggested. perfect portions when you have two. i didn't like how mushy they were and the taste was a little bland. the sauce was WAY too sweet and i LOVE sweet sauces. i will probably make this again but leave out the milk or at least cut it down.

This was just ok to me.  I did as other suggested and baked the mixture in a muffin tin.  The mixture was very bland to me.  It definitely needs some onion and other spices.

Wondeful recipe.  I used meatloaf mix--ground beef and pork.  My husband loved it and it is now his favorite.  Mine too.

These were very tasty. Great texture and flavor. We thought the glaze a bit heavy and sweet. I will stick with Alton Brown's meatloaf glaze. Made 6-4oz mini-loaves and they were just the right size for us.

This was by far THE best meatloaf recipe I have ever had.  I made a few modifications by adding chopped onions, a little bit of parsley to the meat and Worcestershire to the sauce...awesome...will make again and again.

As suggested I used a muffin tin, this made it very easy. Nothing special about this meatloaf to speak of.  The oatmeal was a different spin however, I prefer a more firm meat losf. This was a little mushy. Also, if you don't like sweet meat cut way down on the sugar in the topping.

Very good.  I left out the mustard because I don't love mustard.  I added an onion but it was a little too onion-y for my husband.  I later learned that it is better to saute the onions before adding them.  But I am a fan of these and my kids were too.  I will be making them again!

Everyone in our family loved this recipe, even the kids!  I added some onion and garlic powder but other than that it was perfect!  Seemed very mushy when I was forming them, I was leary about that but they turned out just perfect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I like putting them into an 8" by 8" pan instead.  I think I will use half as much ketchup.... and to absorb the several ounces of liquid on the bottom I will do the following:  after spraying the non-stick spray, I will also put a layer of oatmeal on the bottom... the oatmeal should swell up and absorb the water/oils.

Im not usually a huge fan of meetloaf, but i have to admit that this was good. But instead of having the mustard in the sauce i doubled the amount and put it im the meetloaf itself. I also used spageti sauce instead of ketchup in the sauce. i think i will definitally make this again.

this was great...I thought at first it maybe  a bit runny with all the liquid so I add about a 1/4 cup of cracker crumbs and put it into muffin tins. I also cooked it for 50 mins. It was delicious....an easy meal I will make again. The sauce really made them that much yummier!  Deborah

I've used this recipe at least a dozen times now, I either make them mini or make larger loaves. My family loves them, even my 6 year olds dive in.  It's a very easy to make recipe, some may find the topping quite sweet, but I really like it.

This was my first attempt at meatloaf. Having never eaten it before, I had no idea what it was supposed to taste like. My boyfriend, who has eaten it before, loved it. I made them in a muffin tin but did not tweak the ingredients at all. They came out great. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought there was way too much milk, when I had this mixed together. I had to add bread crumbs. They came out good. I liked them but my kids(4 & 2) did not, but they don't eat anything.

We had 2 couples over for dinner tonight and I tried this recipe.  I added onions (like others had suggested) and some Italian Seasonig too.  I cooked them in the jumbo muffin tins.  It is something that I think I will be making more often!

To make this a 5 star recipe I add 1/2 cup of Kroger Brand Frozen 3 Pepper and Onion very finely chopped.  Even kids love this one.  I always double it and measure 1/2 cup for each loaf.  Delicious.

This is seriously the BEST meatloaf my husband and I have ever had! I sauteed a small onion and two cloves of fresh garlic to add to the meat mixture. I also skipped out on the sauce because we were out of ketchup, and it was still excellent! Very moist and flavorful. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was absolutely amazing!  I'm not big on meatloaf, so when I do make it, I like to try out new recipes! This is by far the best meatloaf recipe I've come across!!

My kids go nuts for this recipe, even the picky one. I make them in a mini-meatloaf pan, cook for 30 minutes, then top with BBQ sauce and cook for 20 more. It's delicious!

Made this a few times & I'm not a big meatloaf person, but this is a very good recipe.  I always add diced onion, worches. sauce, & other spices to my mixture.  Also double sauce b/c it is so yummy!

Thanks for the terrific recipe! I omitted the salt, adding Italian seasoning instead. I also added 1/2 of a chopped onion. Although I'm a vegetarian, this one got rave reviews from my picky parents! My mom did mention that she couldn't really taste the cheese though, so if you're a cheese lover you may want to add some more of that. I was toying with adding some chopped green pepper - next time! I was worried about the sauce after hearing it may be too sweet - but it wasn't at all. I thought it was perfect and they had no complaints. Yum.

I hate meatloaf, but I love this recipe. It is moist and tasty and the topping is sweet with just a little zing. The whole family loves it. I also make them in muffin pans. I've done them in a traditional pan and silicone ones and prefer the silicone, but those who like a crispy bottom will not. One of the few dishes I make that my kids actually ask for and one of the few I've never had to make changes to; except for the cooking time. I only bake them for a half hour since they are smaller.

This meatloaf was awesome!  I did soak the oatmeal in milk to soften it and added one chopped onion and some garlic powder plus I baked them in muffin tins which made it super simple.  The sauce was tasty and it made great cold meatloaf sandwiches the next day (I had to almost double the recipe to get leftovers)!  I will use this ALOT! Thanks.

This is the best meatloaf I've had.  I didn't have oats so I used Panko bread crumbs and it worked fine. I also sauteed 4 strips of bacon with half an onion and a clove of garlic and added that to the mixture.  My husband, who is not a fan of meatloaf, loved it. He ate two.  My 1 1/2 year old son ate one of the smaller loaves.  This is a keeper.

I wanted to make meatloaf...my husband said he didn't like meatloaf...he has requested it at least 5 times in the 2 months since I first made this.  It is AWESOME!!!  This is perfect as is, but I have tried seasoned salt in place of regular salt with great results.  Bottom line- this is a sure winner!

BEST MEATLOAF EVER! Really thought the cheese added to this dish well so would suggest you don't omit it if you are considering that.  Very tired of reading reviews/recipes that just add cheese to anything to make it taste better - in my opinion you could add cheese to a lump of gruel and make it taste better but that doesn't mean that gruel tastes good!  This is not one of those "just add some cheese and mmm mmm mmm" but really a great addition that adds well to this dish. Thanks for sharing!

These were yummy. Let the oatmeal-milk mixture sit for about 5 min to absorb liquid. Perfect texture and consistency. The only thing I changed was added a little chopped onion in with the meat. Making again tonight!

I found the oats made the loaf very mushy.  I even added about a half cup of bread crumbs as the mixture seemed too loose to form into loaves.  I'll keep looking and leave out the oats for sure.

Reminds me of my mother's meatloaf, who was the only person I knew who used oats instead of bread crumbs (until I saw this recipe). My kids love having their own meatloaf!  I usually have to double it in order to have any leftovers for lunch the next day.

Putting the ingredients together, I kept thinking there was no flavor enhancing going on like herbs, spices, or onion, but thought the topping sauce would seep into the loaf. I made this receipt in one loaf pan. This is the blandest meatloaf ever--just tastes like meat, oatmeal, and cheese. The topping is annoyingly sweet and does not enhance the flavor of the loaf. The consistency is gooey! I'm afraid I am going to scrape off the sauce on top and give the rest to my dogs.

This recipe was pretty good. It had a nice texture and was moist. I two problems though. First all of the cheese melted out and Second the sauce was much too sweet. Any suggestions on how I can fix this the next time I make it?

This was SO great!  I added 1/2 an onion to the combined meat and a little extra oats because I could tell by the consistancy of mine that it was too wet.  It came out delicious!

This was a hit!  I did not add the cheese to meat mixture, but instead cut the salt in half added black pepper, celery salt and fresh onion.  I will be cooking this again in the future!

My husband LOVES this recipe. He thought it was odd that I was using oatmeal, but now he would rather eat these mini meatloaves then any other meatloaf. The only adjustment I made was to double the sauce for the top of the loaves. Great recipe.

I finally found a meatloaf recipe to please the entire family!  I make these in muffin pans.  My two year old loves that he gets his own little meatloaf.  Very easy and tasty!

I was wary of this recipe but the tomato soup made a delicious gravy. A great meatloaf recipe for the warmer months when you just don't want to light the oven. I served it once with mashed potatoes and another time with egg noodles.

I made these last night. YUMMMMM-O!! My kids absolutely loved these. I served them with homemade mashed potatoes, corn and a green salad. EXCELLENT! I don't know if I was being "stingy" with the size but I was able to get 12 mini loaves out of the recipe. I just put them in a muffin tin.

These were quite good just as written.  They cooked quickly and looked very nice with the bright red topping.  Will definitely make these again.  They did not even fall apart like my meatloaf usually does.  I had no leftovers so that was the only bad thing.  I will double next time for my family.

I liked the glaze part of these meatloaves. I found that the meat loaf texture seemed to be a bit too chewy for my taste but the flavor was good.

This recipe is so good!  I even forgot to add the cheese and it was still great!  I'm actually eating the left-overs for lunch as I type-lol.  Even my picky kids loved it.  The only things I did different were add fine chopped onion and some garlic powder.  I loved the sauce that goes on top too :-)

Fast and easy recipe.  I made them in a muffin pan as suggested.  The only thing I added was onion (personal preference).

My husband liked these too.
We are on the South Beach Diet, so these were great. I used jarred spaghetti sauce for the topping though instead of ketchup and brown sugar. I also put the loaves in a pam-sprayed muffin tin. Maid 8 meat muffins. Perfect.

Five stars for cost, taste and the fact that it freezes very well (before cooking). The only change was to make it into six loaves - eight were too small.

This meatloaf was great. Especially for my children. My 4 year old and 1 year ate it all and was asking for more. I didn't use the oats (bc I didn't have any) so I used italian breadcrumbs...and it still had a nice flavor to it.

These were good. I made them exactly as written except that I cooked them in the crock pot. I'm sure that they are much better when cooked in the oven, but its so hot here I couldnt bear to turn it on. So they turned out ok, but I'm sure not as good as they're supposed to be. So I will make these again but in the oven :)

These are the best! I've made them many times and they always turn out great. I do add 1 tsp of liquid smoke to the sauce. I like the smoky favor it adds to the sauce. I usually double the recipe...freeze some for my grandmother and take some to work for lunch.

I made these in the muffin pan as suggested by others and they came out well.  It's really the sauce on top of them that sets this apart from other meatloaf recipes.  All in all, it was good.

There are things that I liked and things that I didn't about this one. The sauce on top tasted great. I think that I will at least start using that on all my meatloaf recipes. The taste of the meatloaf was okay...kinda blah. (I tried to even add extra garlic...) I normally like to reheat my meatloaf for lunch the next day, but this one was NOT good reheated. The blandness just got worse and the topping lost its flavor. But it is a decent recipe overall. I will maybe try it one more time, with extra spices. (By the way...this recipe made two small loaves which fed my family of 7...ages 2 on up)

I made this as one, big meatloaf.   Maybe that was my problem.  It turned out very mushy.  It wasn't very good.  I probably wouldn't even try it again. Also, it made way too much topping.  So you could cut that down to about half.  It had so many good reviews, but most of them added or changed ingredients to make it good.  Making it exactly as written, it just didn't work for me.

Best meatloaf I've ever had, Tonya! Thank you.

[Alterations:  substituted plain breadcrumbs, threw in some dried onion flakes, and splashed Worcestershire in the loaf mix; added a few dashes of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to the glaze.]

Excellent!  This is my husband's and my favorite meatloaf recipe.  If no cheddar on hand, I just use jack or colby.  I did reduce the sauce to about 1/2 only because he's not big on sweet stuff (but I love it!)  Also, I use 1/2 turkey and 1/2 beef.

I was bored with are usual grd. bf recipes and was searching for something quick easy and delicious.  This was all of those.  I did add garlic powder, pepper and some dried parsley for some color.  This was so good.  thank you this will make my boring grd bf exciting again. I served it with mashed potatoes and for dessert creamy rice pudding from this site.

I LOVED this meatloaf!  
I did add 1 TBL. minced onion, 1/4 cup chopped bellpeppers. Someone suggested letting the mix setting for a few minutes before adding ground beef, good idea! The ketchup topping was a little sweet in the future I'll decrease sugar to maybe 2 tblsp.

Everyone loved these little meatloaves. I like to double the recipe and freeze the extras to reheat later.

I mixed and matched ingredients of this recipe with the Brown Sugar Meatloaf recipe also on this site and the final product was amazing! Even my husband admitted they were cute. The only downside I found to preparing them in a muffin pan was that the leftover grease was a little yucky. Thanks for the great idea though!

I followed someone else's idea of using a muffin tin and they turned out great. Leftovers were as good or better than the first day. Although I would recommend generously coating the pan with butter, margerine our cooking spray.

I used my one and only 6 muffin tin and really piled the meat in. I put the tray on a baking sheet to catch the juices. If only there was an easy way to pile more sauce on. Maybe next time I'll just try making some more on the stove.

Oh my gosh. It was sooo yummy. We had a ladybug birthday party for my 2 yr. old. So I made the mini loaves, and for the black spots I used small black olives, cut in half. It was a total crowd pleaser. I added 4 times of everything, and it still turned out good. It fed about 9 adults, and 12 kids and I had just enough left overs for the next night. I will use this recipe a lot more in the future. Thank you!

I made it exactly as directed.  I makde mini loaves instead of one big loaf and cooked it in a 350 degree oven for 35 minutes.  The sauce was a bit sweet and so next time I'm going to cut back on the amount that I put on the loaves.  Both my husband and kids loved it and said that they'd eat it again.

The only meatloaf my kids will eat...and ask for seconds! I've made this recipe twice now, once using cupcake pans sprayed with Pam and the other using Pampered Chef stoneware loaf pans. Both are really the same so it's just pereference.  I add garlic, parsley, onions for alittle more flavor.If you find the recipe too wet... make the night before allowing oatmeal and cheese to absorb.Then add milk and egg to mixture before cooking and it comes out perfect.I don't even bother measuring ketchup, mustard and brown sugar topping, I just guess. This one's a keeper!

I made this with lean ground turkey and also added a little ground pepper and garlic. The oats and cheese make the loaves really moist and a really good texture. Great recipe! It was really yummy. My whole family loved it. It's a definite keeper! (I know I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but this is one of those recipes that you can tell would be really good followed exactly, I just wanted less fat and wanted to add some flavor to the turkey...:)

Very good! I expected a traditional meatloaf in a different shape (which everybody liked!) and was surprised by the better-than-your-average-meatloaf taste. I'm not sure if it was the oatmeal or what, but it was a big hit at our house. I'll be making this again soon!

A friend gave me this recipe several years ago and my husband LOVES it.  I have adjusted the recipe to our taste and to make it low fat.  I use extra lean ground beef (96/4), fat free cheese and skim milk.  I also add about a cup of chopped onions.  For the topping I use splenda brand brown sugar--only about a tablespoon. And I add more ketchup and mustard--so it's not so sweet. I found it only needs to bake for about 35-40 minutes, otherwise it gets a little dry. It is delicious and so healthy!

As Rachael Ray would say, "Yum-O!"  I tried it in muffin tins the first time, but hated the clean up.  The 2nd time, I formed mini-loaves on my stoneware bar pan, and it worked marvelously.  I also added some finely chopped bell peppers the 2nd time - a neat addition!

Tasted great! I had 1.25 lbs. of meat, and should have made 12 little loaves. I did 9 in muffin tins and they overflowed a bit. I will make these again, filling each tin about 2/3 full.

These were tasty, and the combination of oats and cheese helped the mini-loaves hold their form and gave them a nice flavor.  The sauce was a little bit sweeter than I like.

I was really amazed at how good I thought this recipe turned out. I made it pretty much just like the recipe. I only added some onion to the mixture. It was very good. The next time I make it I will omit the brown sugar I didn't care for the sweetness of the topping. That is why I only gave it a 4 star rating. Very easy and very good.

These were great! I omitted the cheese and used half the brown sugar. Instead of eight mini loaves, I put them in muffin tins, for a total of 12. My 10 month old loves them!! If I were to make an "adult" version, I'd add some veggies, but for my baby, it's perfect!

I am not a fan of meatloaf, but my husband likes it.  I've searched for a meatloaf recipe we both like for years and never found one until now.  The only modification I made was to add some chopped onion.  This meatloaf was moist and very tasty.  A keeper!

I only used the ketchup and brown sugar for the glaze...it was awesome!  My mom said it was the best meatloaf she's every had.

Loved it! I am a beginner cook, so alot of the time, my meals never turn out right. However, this one did! The only think I changed is that I also feel that meatloaf needs to have onions, so I caramelized them before adding to meat mix; I also ran out of oats, so I finished with crushed saltines. I did take the advise of another and let the oat/egg/milk mix sit for a while before adding in the meat. It was really really good!

Yum Yum!  My family loved this recipe.  My 10 yr old boy made them with my supervision.  We made just a couple small changes.  We added some garlic powder and chopped onion and placed meat in a muffin tin(we were able to make 12 little meatloaves). We changed the glaze slightly by doing half ketcup and half bbq sauce.  We will definitely make them again.  These will be great to take to a potluck too!

I've been kind of sick of meatloaf while my husband has been begging for it.  I thought maybe a new recipe would be good, so tried this one.  After eating it, I decided that meatloaf is meatloaf & it all really tastes the same no matter what is in the recipe.  He liked it, I really didn't care for it & will go back to my old recipe as it's easier & less ingredients.  He didn't even know it was a different recipe, or at least he didn't say anything about it being different.

Delicious!  My husband made this for dinner, and even though he used the wrong mustard, and too much brown sugar, the overall dish was fabulous.  We will definitely have this dish again, with the correct measurements.  Yum!  ***Just wanted to add that this has become our staple meatloaf recipe.  We have made others from this site, but this tops them all.***

I don't particulary care for meatloaf, but I liked these.  Even the kids thought they were good.  I followed the advise of another rating and baked them in muffin tins.  Tasted great with garlic smashed potatoes I made to accompany the meatloaf.

Absolutely delicious! My husband hated meatloaf until he tried this recipe. I cut down on the brown sugar a bit, used unsweetened ketchup and it was still awesome. Thanks for the recipe.

Everyone enjoyed these. I did add about 1 /2 onion, which I slightly sauteed in a frying pan before adding to the beef mixture. I will add this recipe to my recipe box and use as my once a week beef recipe every once in a awhile. Very easy to make. Thank you for the recipe!

This was OK but I did make some changes.  I added 2 tsp of worchestershire sauce and 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I also added 1 cup of seasoned bread crumbs because once the mixture was very runny from the milk.  For the sauce I used 1/2 cup chili sauce and 2 T karo syrup.  I served it on sourdough bread.  It turned out fine.

I wish I had cut down on the filler--the oats. The consistency wasn't "meaty" enough. The sauce is very good. I'll make these again with half the oats and less liquid.

Wow!  These mini meatloaves are really fantastic.  I added taco seasoning, a bit of onion and topped with salsa instead.  Baked for 35 minutes.  Family loved them and I'll make them on a regular basis!

Made this following the recipe exactly, and the family loved it.  The meat had a good texture, and is mild in flavor. The glaze is plentiful and sweet, making it a hit with both my picky-eating 3 year old daughter, and my condiment loving husband.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was pretty darn good! The first time I made it, I was missing onions though, so I added them the second time I made them. I like the idea a couple of reviewers had to use pasta sauce instead of ketchup. I think I will do that next time. The ketchup was a little too sweet with the brown sugar, but overall very yummy!

OMG!!!!! These were the best.  My husband loved them and so did I.  I never really liked meat loaf and I loved them.  I added onion, cumin and jalapenos to the mixture and cooked them in the oven.  The last 5 minutes I put them on the top shelf and turned the broiler on.  They were great.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

I love this meatloaf recipe. And have been making it for some time. It's a favorite for all the family. Sometimes I make it into one large meatloaf. And other times I substitute turkey for the hamburger.

These Mini Meatloaves were very good!  But I thought the sauce was a little too sweet.
Next time I will use less sugar, and use a spicy mustard for a little added spice. Also a little onion in the mix would add some flavor.

I had never eaten a meatloaf or even attempted to make one till I was given this recipe 4 years ago. It is the best. My husband had never had meatloaf since he was a kid at home so it took us to the age of 52 to love this. I even add chopped up mushrooms to mine and some diced gr. pepper occasionally to the meat mixture.

I don't like meatloaf but these are to DIE for! I used mini loaf pans and muffin cups ... even doubled the recipe once for extra leftovers! This is a keeper for sure!

I added barbeque sauce into the meat like some other reviewers suggested.  The adults and children loved the meatloaf.  I made them into 2 bite appetizers and baked for 20 min.  Big Hit!

These were super easy to make and perfect.  I put them in a muffin pan so they were muffin sized and fun to eat!  Served with mashed potatoes and veggies.  A Fall fave from now on.

I love this recipe & have made it many times.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and always bake them in muffin tins. I also add a little minced green pepper and usually add more oats, and sometimes leave out the cheese.  I always double the sauce and serve them with rice.  These are delicious!

This is such a great idea. The kids loved having their own little meatloaf. I used the muffin tin like someone else suggested, and I didn't have any oats on hand so I used bread crumbs instead.

We really liked this.  The loaves were lovely and moist - the meat melted in your mouth.  We found the sauce a bit sweet, so might change that next time - or might not use anything.

We made these in a large muffin tin, and they were great.  Next time we'll use a regular baking sheet, so the outside of the loaves gets crispier.

I loved theese meatloaves!! I added some sauteed onion, as somebody suggested. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, and 1/4 a teaspoon of black pepper. I was not sure if I would like the sauce , but the mustard made it a little tangy , and that was ok with me!! I added a little black pepper to the sauceas well. I love having individual  loaves too. Very cute, and fun. Will be making this recipe again.**Even the leftover mini meatloaves are good. As a mother of two little ones sometimes I need something fast. The meat loaves were not unapealing to me like some left overs are.

Wonderful meatloaf. My family loved it and i have tried many different recipes over the years and this one is a keeper. I liked the individual servings of the mini meatloaf. Sauce was perfect but my husband said the meatloaf was good by itself it didnt need the sauce, just a little ketchup on the side.  Maybe next time i will add onions. I wanted to add that i have used both old fashioned oats and the quick cooking and i think they both work just as well. I would recommend letting the mixture stand for a few minutes so the oats can soak up some of the liquid.

This recipe was very good!  What I like about the mini loaves is that my son and I can have it regular but I  can put jalepenos and onions in my husband's. It was very moist and easy to make.

My husband loved it.  I liked it, but prefer more veggies.  I used buffalo and it was a great way to keep it moist without all the fat.  Very easy, so I'm sure I'll do it again when pressed for time.

Very good but I made it with bread crumbs and only added half the sugar as reccommended. Husband hates meatloaf and rated it an 8... I made a vegeterian version for myself with TVP and mushrooms. Oh I also added the french onion soup dry mix.

This was a good recipe. I really like the portions sizes for my three kids.
I thought the meatloaf itself was little on the soft side, mushy. I would add a little more meat next time, maybe 1/4-1/2 lb. I also though the glaze was little sweet for our taste.  I would make again though. I paired it with mashed potatoes and smothered green beans.

Nice recipe.  A little sweet on the ketchup end of things, would maybe use tomato sauce but that's just my taste.  ;)  I used bison and the recipe was a big hit.  Great for lunches too.

These Mini Meatloaves tasted really good!  The brown sugar glaze really complemented the beef well, and the meatloaves were really moist.  The next day, even the leftovers tasted great on toasted bread.

This was a fast week night meal and took very little prep time.  We really liked it but the meat seemed a little bland.  I think next I will add some onion, garlic, and bell peppers to add a little more flavor.

I used 3 lbs. ground beef but only doubled the other ingredients for the loaves.  Also, added 1 tsp. onion powder and 1 tsp. garlic pepper. I lined my lasagna pan with heavy duty foil to bake them.  I got 9 loaves from 3 lbs.  I made the glaze but have one boy who does not like sweet glazes so I topped 3 of them with bbq sauce and others with the recipe glaze plus a little bbq sauce over the top.  Really good.  Served with mashed potatoes and peas.

VERY, VERY good meatloaf recipe! Not dry at all, and the loaves hold together perfectly. Oh, and the sauce...YUM! My son literally beggs for this every Sunday now! We get 6 loaves out of it,and they are a perfect serving size - any more and the loaves would almost be bite-size; any less and each person would need two. I have also made this as one large loaf, but we prefer the smaller, individual ones (you get more sauce that way! :o)

This was very good meatloaf...and this is from someone who has tried A LOT of recipes looking for the perfect one.  I divided the meat into only 2 loaves...one with the sauce as written and one left plain. The sauce definitely adds a wonderful flavor dimension and covers up an otherwise odd looking loaf (looks like cheese polka dots on top!)  One mistake I made was using regular instead of quick cooking oats...and the meatloaf mix was VERY loose.  I crushed some ritz crackers as some other reviewers suggested and added it as a thickener and that seemed to do the trick.  It was firm enough when cooked and had a nice texture.  I will make this again, but will try making it into 4 or 6 loaves instead of 2.  Thanks so much for sharing!

A great "meat loaf" alternative, never have leftovers!Kids love the small individual "own meatloaf", great with potato salad, salad tossed with favorite dressing and corn on cob.Now that's southern eating simple. Thanks for this version of a great recipe.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  Considering this was the first time I ever made meatloaf... it went extremely well.  I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of oats.  I had oats on hand, but from reading other reviews I went with the crumbs.  The sauce really does need brown sugar... I added parsley, basil, oregano, and onion salt (I would've used fresh onions if I had any).  I'm not sure how you can make 8 loaves without doubling the recipe.  I ended up with 4 quarter pounders... delicious!  I am keeping this recipe and will definitely make them again.  Thanks!

Delicious and so easy.  I did substitute bread crumbs for the oats since I didn't have any oats on hand.  I also used a muffin pan instead of making individual mini-loaves.  We'll be making this one again!

This recipe is very yummy.  My husband really enjoyed it and he is the meat and potato type.  I skipped the mustard because I'm not a fan.  I will probably try this with a little onion or the onion soup mix added to it just to see how it would taste.

These were good....but eerily similar to the meatloaf my mother makes - the very same meatloaf that, as a child, I would try hard to get out of eating.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and had to sub breadcrumbs for the oats as I had the wrong kind in the pantry.  Also, if I make these again, I would add some diced onion and green pepper to the mix, and decrease the brown sugar as I thought the topping was a touch too sweet...I also chose to make these in muffin tins, baking for roughly 30 minutes.  I froze the majority of them so I can pull them for quick lunches.  Like I said, this is a good recipe, but I think I will stick to my other recipe.  Thanks!

Very, very good.  I think this will become our new meatloaf!  Turned out perfect.  I added a little onion & garlic and made 4 small loaves rather than 8.  I usually won't give 5 stars if I make changes that make it better, but I was suprised at how good this actually was & think it deserves all 5.  It is probably still excellent without the added garlic & onion.

I thought this was only okay. Not the best meatloaf I have ever had, but my kids who are really picky liked it a lot. I found it somewhat difficult to form them into mini loaves. The mix is very loose. I followed the directions actually. Not sure if I would make it again.

great meatloaf!  The sauce on top really made it great.  I also added about 1/2 cup of diced onion which made it even better.  Plus, the cook time on these is about half of other recipes :)

I make 6 mini meatloaves from this recipe.  I cut the ketchup topping ingredients in 1/2 as my husband doesn't like it, but I love it.  Instead of onion and salt/pepper, I use 1/2 package dry onion soup, and it works out perfect.

I used to make this recipe all the time, but lost it in a recent move.  Thank goodness I found it here!  My family loves this -- the kids think it's fun to have "their own" meatloaves.  These make great leftovers, too.

I am picky about meatloaf and have yet to find one that I love until now!!  This is great and I think the sauce makes it.  The only thing I did different was use meatloaf mix and added finely chopped shredded carrots.

This recipe is amazing. My family and freinds love it, and its so easy. Everyone thinks of meat loaf as boring, but not this one!  I now have been making this for over 3 years.  Every time someone is invited over for dinner, and I asked them what they are in the mood for, they immediately say "Mini Meatloaves!". I know this recipe will stay in my family for years and years.  Thanks for the kepper Tonya!

This recipe is perfect for portions. I put them in individual oversized muffin tins...they turn out perfect everytime. Meatloaf is not a big thing here in the UK but my husband loves this recipe...it is the only one I use.

These were great.  Even my kids loved it.  I didn't have quick cooking oats, so I used bread crumbs instead.

My kids and hubby thought these were great, very family friendly! 4 stars because they weren't quite as impressive taste-wise as some of the other meatloaves on this site. I think the kiddos loved it because they were mini!

My husband had a great time making this, adding onion and Wor sauce.  Mixture was a bit runny so he added 2T dry bread crumbs.  I loved it (wonderful sauce!), and I don't even care for meatloaf!  Served with KFC mashed potatoes and gravy and some canned green beans.

I made this using ground turkey and it turned out great. I had to let the mixture sit for awhile in the fridge to soak up some of the milk because it was too runny to work with, don't know if that had to do with using turkey or not. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and scooped the meatloaf into a muffin pan and it made 12 little meatloaves. They were great, my husband didn't even miss the beef!

Best meatloaf ever -- and so easy to make! I used shredded Monterey Jack cheese instead of cheddar, and the results were delicious. My husband and I loved it with the sauce, and our kids loved it without the sauce.

Because my husband does not like meatloaf...but I do, I only make it a few times a year.  I decided to try this recipe because it was totally different from the traditional meatloaf recipe, and boy was it a hit!  Maybe it is the mustard or brown sugar, but I recieved no complaints from my family when I served it for dinner the other night....and the left overs made terrific cold sandwitches the next day.

This was good, not fabulous, but good.  My 2 year old ate 2 helpings, but it was missing something for me.  It needed a little more texture or flavor.  We all loved the topping though, very yummy!

I thought this recipe was GENIUS!!! The glaze was the perfect addition to these little yummies. I liked the fact that the meatloaf was smaller than normal so that my kids weren't overwhelmed with too much meat. As a little somethin' different I added some honey to the glaze which made it taste even better! Also, instead of using oats I used lipton onion soup mix which gave the meat even more flavor!

My family loves this - - even my husband who can be a bit of a 'meat snob!'  I love it because it is easy to make, quick to bake and easy to clean up!

I loved this recipe.  It was so quick and easy and is made with ingredients you always have on hand.  I baked mine in a stone mini-loaf pan, so it took 55 min. vs. 45 min. but was well worth the wait!

My husband loves these and I'm glad because they are much easier to prepare than a large loaf and it cooks much quicker.  These have just replaced my old meatloaf recipe.  Thanks!

I was disappointed with this recipe given the high reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I added one medium finely diced onion.  I only got 6 loaves out of the meat mixture and in the end we found two things:  we are used to meatloaf with A LOT more flavour (the cheese was completely lost...couldn't taste it at all), and secondly, we didn't like the texture of the meatloaves...the oats left them with a mushy texture.

these looked more like little cheeseburgers than meatloaves, but they were super yummy. My husband is a big meatloaf fan and I really don't care for it, but we both loved this recipe!

May try to make it again, the sauce made it tasty.  Meat mixture needs more sesoning thought it was bland. Would probably double the sauce next time.

Great recipe!  I doubled it, and cooked it in my electric roaster.  I also used store bought bread crumbs in place of the oatmeal.  Came out perfect!  None of us were thrilled with the sauce, however.  We all thought it was too sweet.  In anticipation of the possibility, I didn't put any on several of the loaves.  They came out just fine.  I'll definately be using this recipe again-the leftovers were also terrific!  Thanks for posting it!

I normally dislike meatloaf so much, that it is a standing joke in family.  This was really good!  My husband and I enjoyed it.  The kids weren't too into it, but I think they just weren't hungry.  I like many other reviewers used italian breadcrumbs because I didn't have oats.  I think next time I may try broiling it for a minute at the end to carmelzie the sauce.  I know officially like meatloaf!!

This was really good and the flavors went well together.  The only ONE thing I would change is to put 1/2 the brown sugar in the sauce.  It was just a "tad" too sweet, other than that, it really was good.  Thanks!

This turned out really good.  Faster than a full sized meatloaf and just as tasty.  I wasn't sure about the addition of cheese but it was great.  I'm making this again tonight!

Very good -- nice change of pace from the "usual" meatloaf recipe.  Too much sauce--next time I'll use about 1/2.

I also use 2 T onion soup mix for additional flavor and cook it in the MICROWAVE for 7 minutes then let stand for 5 minutes, (this is for one loaf)--It is real juicy and very QUICK to make, I also save some of the sauce to put on top of it after I cut it.  My recipe came in a Microwave book with my microwave oven in 1974!

Hmmm, I tried this and reduced the cooking time by 10 minutes and they were still overdone.  I will try them again and cook for 25 or 30 minutes.  45 Is definitely too long.  I used breadcrumbs instead of oats as the oats I had were not quick ones.  Maybe this made the difference??  Also next time I will use bigger chunks of shredded cheese.  I used the real finely shredded cheese and I couldn't really tell it was there.

I have never used a "real" recipe for meatloaf in the past.  This was very good!  I did not use oats, but did add breadcrumbs.  I also added Worcestershire sauce to both the meat mixture and the sauce.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now - I orginally got it out of Taste of Home or one of their affiliated magazines.  The original recipe also calls for onions, which I do add - the whole family just loves these!

Very tasty!  I liked the "mini" idea... the fat drains away from the meat loaves.  We put left overs into hefty hotdog buns.  The sauce was a bit intense tasting... I think next time I'll put half of it on the meat loaves and serve the other half on the side.  I added garlic.

I messed up when I made these and put the ketchup and brown sugar in the meatloaf mix. So they weren't very solid but they were still really yummy. I'm defintely going to make them again-the right way!

This recipe is fantastic! Even my picky three year old gobbled it up.  I did add onion powder as well as 1 tsp each of worcestershire sauce and ground mustard into the beef mixture.  I didn't have any quick oats on hand so I used plain bread crumbs, and a muffin pan worked great for this recipe.  It's definitely replacing the meatloaf recipe that I've been using for years!

The sauce for these meatloaves is very, very nice!  However, the meatload itself didn't have very much flavor at all.  I even added onions, garlic, and a dash of worcestershire sauce, but it still came out a bit bland.  Fantastic sauce though!

I don't even like meatloaf and I thought this was fantastic. The sauce has a nice flavor and it enhances the nice, light flavor of the meat. I also added some onion and garlic powder. Great recipe!

This recipie is wonderful! My Husband loved it and he isn't that fond of meatloaf.
I did add half a packet of onion soup mix and it gave it a great flavor. I also cut the glaze by aboout one half. Will add to my favorites and make often.

I was intrigued by all the rave reviews for this meatloaf -- thinking meatloaf is meatloaf is meatloaf, right?  Not so!  This is a 5 star, outstanding recipe!  The individual loaves were a nice change from slicing off hunks from a big huge loaf.  I formed 6 instead of 8 like others, and not only was the size perfect, they fit into the 9x13 dish easily.  I added a few dashes of Worscheshire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper to the mixture before cooking, just for personal taste, and since the mixture seemed a little too wet, I added a few extra shakes of quick oats.  The texture was very light and not just a mass of dense meat.  The sauce spread was outstanding, but I didn't use it all, although my husband used it to dip his meatloaf in at dinner.  This will replace all our old recipes!

Wow. I tried this last night and followed the instructions almost to a T except that I found it kind of mushy and so I was out of quick oats and added some Italian style bread crumbs. Following other's advice, I exchanged part of the salt for onion salt, about 1/2 and 1/2. For the cheese I used a 4 cheese Mexican style by Kraft. I could smell the mustard while cooking and I love mustard; however, the mustard taste was minimal and so I think I will add more next time. I got the 8 loaves but they were tiny, I think 4 next time or 6 and I like the cupcake pan idea too. What I like best about this is how easy it will be to alter different portions (I love onions and green peppers, but not everyone in my family does)and the fact that you can freeze these little loaves and then take them for lunch to work. Thank, Tonya!!!

Added chopped onions to loaf, subtracted brown sugar from topping (I did this the first time I cooked it, based on personal tastes).  AWESOME!

This was wonderful.  Making it in smaller portions takes away from the "slab of meat" feeling you get with a bigger meatloaf. The sauce (which is delightful for how simple it is), is more generously distributed over the smaller loaves. Yummy!

Really yummy, but I would use spaghetti sauce instead of the ketcup/brown sugar mixture. The sauce was very, very sweet.

These meatloaves were a HUGE hit with my husband, 6-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter. My husband said he could eat them every night of the week. My normally picky daughter's plate was empty before I even sat down!

These mini-meatloaves were excellent!  Don't you hate trying to dig slices of meatloaf out of a bread pan?  If so, then you will LOVE making and serving these.  Every serving looks great on everyone's plate!  I did not add anything extra - I guess we like to get the flavor from the sauce.  I made six mini-loaves instead of eight, and the serving size was just right. Plus, six fit better in my 9x13 than eight would have.  This is a very good recipe!!  I will make them again!

This was really tasty, I thought. And, very easy. The third time I made these, they were even tastier because I used ground chicken instead of beef, and even hid some diced celery in them. It turned out softer than the beef version, but was very popular with my family.  I also used a "Mexican" cheese mix instead of just cheddar. I will probably make this with chicken all the time now.

My family enjoyed this recipe. It was like everyone had their own end piece! I like the simplicity of making it also. The reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is because I felt that the meat itself was rather bland. I will make again, but add some more seasoning to the mixture. I also used my muffin pan to cook them in - very helpful. Thanks for sharing.

EXCELLENT! I made this in my cupcake pan, it made 11 meatloaf cupcakes and I baked them for about 35 min. The ketchup glaze is awesome! Even my 7 year old liked it and he's not big on sweet tasting dishes. Will make many times in the future.

My husband has always raved about his mother's meatloaf, but no longer! I was very hesitant about using oats in meatloaf, but did as others suggested and let the oats soak into the liquid mixture for 10+ minutes...Perfect and has already become a staple. As the sauce goes fast, I would recommend doubling as well. Great recipe.

These mini meatloaves were fantastic. I would agree with other reviewers that less liquid is necessary.  I ended up adding additional oats and some cracker crumbs to make mixture hold together.  I will definitely make again but use only 1/2 cup milk or less milk.

We are a family of 8, some are VERY picky eaters, yet my entire family loved this meatloaf! Their only complaint was that they wanted more of the glaze... next time I will double the sauce portion of the recipe. YUMMMM!

I found the meatloaf was too wet(before i baked it).  I added about 1/3 cup of bread crumbs. I didnt want to add more oats because I've never used them in a meatloaf before and thought it might get to oaty in texture.(I should have let the oats absorb the moisture but I read the reviews after I made it).  I also added a package of onion soup mix for flavour and made only 6 loaves instead of 8.  It turned out tasting very good!

This recipe is wonderful.  I am not a big meatloaf eater, but my dad requested it for his birthday.  I tried this recipe and everyone loved it so much.  They were raving about it.  My husband and I are still talking about how great that meatloaf was.  This is going to be something I make often.  It is so easy to make.  I followed the directions completely and it was fantastic.  Thanks Tonya for sharing this.

This was very good. I added a little chorizo & chili powder for kick. Also some onion flakes, garlic salt and black pepper for flavor & let the oatmeal absorb the moist ingredients while thawing the beef 'chub' (Costco) in the microwave. I also added some chili powder to the sauce to tie in the flavors. I kept the sauce on the side (heated in a pan) in case the kids balked and made four loafs as recommended by others (8 would have been cup-cake sized). Very tasty.

I made this tonight and it was great. I had a touch over a lb of burger, used two eggs instead of one and only 1/2 cup of milk. I let the oats soak in the milk about 10 minutes. I also used seasoning salt and added garlic. I shaped into 5 loaves. My 4 year old ate two whole ones, but she's quite the carnivore anyway. I will make these again and freeze them to reheat on rushed nights.

We really liked this meatloaf, and the tiny loaves are such fun . . . besides that, they cook faster and provide built in portion control.  I did make lower fat substitutions and reduced the amount of cheese . . . extra lean ground beef (96/4), egg substitute for the egg, 1/2 cup skim milk, 1/3 cup 2% cheddar cheese, 2 Tbsp. brown sugar.  I added a little garlic salt, white pepper, and onion flakes.  I made six mini loaves at half the calories and 1/4 the fat of the original.  I love using oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs, but tonight I tried pulsing the oatmeal in the food processor just a bit before soaking it.  Worked great.  Thanks, Tonya

I am truly a meatloaf lover and I wanted to try a different recipe, I really didn't like the slimey texture that the oatmeal seems to give it.Followed the recipe to the T.Not much of a flavor either in the meat. I'm going back to my old recipe with onions, parsley, garlic, bread etc.Then top the whole thing off with ketcup!! Sorry.

Wonderful.  I always use quick cooking oats in meatloaf so this was a great version for me to try.  My family loved it!  I added half a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powders.

This tasted great!  I added onions to mine, and I mixed everything together even the topping.  I doubled the recipe and pressed it into a 9x13 pan.

Delicious.  I had to have two.  My picky eater son - three years old ate 1 and a half and that's a lot for him.  The older boy - six - ate two of them, then didn't like the topping anymore, so ate another half with the topping cut off.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  I only made one meatloaf.  I tried the recipe with turkey and with pork instead of beef.  The turkey was not so good.  The pork was better and the beef was the best...of course.  We love this recipe.

I just got married, so I am always on the lookout for quick and easy recipes that I think my husband and I will like. I decided to give this one a try, and we both absolutely LOVED it! He is sometimes pretty picky, but I went ahead and tried it anyways, and he took one bite, and said, "write this one down." That's when I know it's a winner! I followed someone's advice on one of the reviews and let the egg/oat mixture sit a few minutes before adding the meat so the oats could soak up any extra moisture, and I think this helped. I actually skipped the topping and made homestyle gravy and potato dumplings. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe! :)

We liked this one.  The cheese was an interesting change from my normal recipe.  I used leftover sauce from the Tasty Tender Pork Tenderloin recipe (on this site) in place of the ketchup sauce here.  Decent subsitute.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and I am not really a meatloaf eater.  We needed to use some ground turkey and thought this recipe sounded good, anything with cheese is worth a try! We used a 9x9 pan, loved the glaze.  I will make this again!!

I am not a meatloaf lover but this recipe is great!  I made 5lbs worth of the loaves a little bigger than what was specified and froze them.  It's easy to make the first time around and even easier to reheat and serve for a quick meal!  I also prepare the sauce as I reheat the loaves.

My husband called me a master chef after eating this meatloaf!  I'm not a fan of meatloaf and I loved it.  I took some suggestions and added oregano and garlic powder to the meat mixture.  I didn't change the glaze at all and I thought it was perfect.  Thank you for this recipe I will be using it again!

Good recipe.  I wish there hadn't been so much liquid, will cut down on the milk.  Followed the advice of others cut down on the sugar.  Guess I was expecting a lot because of its 5 star rating.

I tried to double this recipe and it turned out very wet. I couldn't shape it into mini loaves but had to put it in two loaf pans. However, the flavor was very good. I used a mix of turkey, pork and beef, added a little garlic powder and onion, as someone suggested. I did not double the glaze and it was plenty for two loaves. I think I will try again.

I have made these a few times now, and the only change I made was to add onions.  My nephew wants to be invited for dinner whenever I make these.  My 4 yr old even loves them.  I love that they are quick, easy and no special shopping required.

Slight changes I made:  Added 2 cloves of minced garlic, diced green peppers & used Italian style breadcrumbs.  I liked the idea of indivudual loaves b/c everybody wants their slice crusty all around.  Also, I really liked glaze (used less sugar as others suggested), I can't imagine making them without it.  Making them again, only with less Cheddar.

A delightful change from the ho-hum meatloaf recipe to a great meatloaf recipe. Love the glaze topping plus the meatloaf is very tender and tasty. Maybe next time I will add into the meat some sauted onions and peppers. But I WILL definately make this one again. Thanks for sharing with us Tonya!!

WOW...I hate meatloaf, but my husband loves it.  My mother-in-law gave me a special meatloaf pan for Christmas, and I had never used it.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a shot.  This recipe was easy, cheap, and delicous...what a fantastic combination.

Excellent recipe!!  Very easy, fast, and delicious.  I have made this 4 times in the past 2 months, and always got requests for the recipe.  I add garlic powder and onion powder (about 1/2 tsp each) to the meat mixture, and it's just perfect!  I'll be making this again tomorrow :)

Good Overall recipe.  It was a little soft and lacked any strong flavor.  Next I will try using bread crumbs instead of oats and a few more spices.

loved them!!! I made 2 changes- first I made 5 loaves instead of 8; second I used regular quaker oats-- didn't have the quick cooking ones, but it didn't matter.. The kids and husband enjoyed it as well-- next time I won't put as much sauce on top (I used the whole amount).

LOVED this recipe. My boyfriend said it was up there with his grandma, and boy can she cook. Loved the tiny meatloves, I actually made 5 (which I feel was more appropriate). The glaze on top was fantastic. If I could give it a higher rating I would. Next time I think I'll add onions though.

This recipe is wonderful and has been a great hit with my whole family, especially my toddler.  It's also great to make ahead and freeze.  I just let them thaw in the fridge, covered them with some fresh glaze and warmed them in the microwave.

I made these a few nights ago for a family dinner.  Everyone loved them.  They were very easy to make and I really liked the ketchup mix for the top.  I may use dried bread crumbs instead of oats in the future, just to give it a little bit more of a smoother texture.

GREAT RECIPE!! I've made this twice ... it's easy and fast (about 1 hour from start to finish) ... and YUMMY! :) Even my meatloaf-hating husband loved this meatloaf and got a second helping. I added some garlic powder and onion powder (1/2 tsp of each) -- otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Using 90% lean ground beef seems to work best, as the meatloaf does not turn out greasy at all, and tastes great.

This was prety good. The only problem i had with this is that the cheese melted and oozed all over the pan and burned a little. It could also use a little more texture like onions or something.

Everyone in my family enjoyed this and it was easy to make; don't know the advantage of making eight little loaves over just cooking it as one larger loaf but we liked it...

This is one of the best recipes for meatloaf ever!  My whole family loved it!  Delicious!  I also added onion and used dijon mustard, worked well.

Everyone loved it! Thanks for this easy and tasty meatloaf! Even I liked it, and I don't like meatloaf. I did add 1 onion and less milk.

These tasted really good.  The sauce is phenomenal.  I made mine into 2 mini loaf pans, though not as mini as the recipe intended.  Since I had less area to cover with sauce, I cut it in half.  I also was a bit short on quick oats so I made up the difference with fresh breadcrumbs.

My children enjoyed eating this meatloaf, and so did I!  It has a nice texture and a subtle flavor.  We just didn't pack the brown sugar.

What a quick and tasty recipe!  I used a mushroom gravy instead of the ketchup topping(to validate my husbands love of gravy!), but next time I will try it.  Thanks for an easy weeknight favorite!

Great idea for a quick ans hearty family meal.  I added garlic powder and a little worstishire sauce.  I have one of those picky 8 year olds who hates everything, including cheddar cheese.  He ate two loaves!!  That alone makes this one a Five Star recipe for me.

I like the idea of having mini meatloaves, but they didn't offer much for flavor. I would have rated this lower, but my 5 year old loved them.

Excellent meatloaf recipe!  I thought the glaze was a little too sweet, so I will probably reduce the amount of brown sugar next time, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!
