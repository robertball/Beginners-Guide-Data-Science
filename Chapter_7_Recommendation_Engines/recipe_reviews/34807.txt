This recipe made very good use of a jar of hot pepper jelly I've had sitting in the pantry. (Probably sweeter than jalapeno jelly, but it worked!) I used extra virgin olive oil for even stronger flavor. I tenderized the chops first and let them marinate for about 6 hours, and they held much of the moisture during grilling. Hubby gave it a big thumbs up -- I'm not a real fan of pork chops, but I cleaned my plate as well because I enjoyed the flavor so much. Since I have half a jar of jelly left, we'll definitely make this again.

I think the pork chops would be better if you just cook them without the marinade and put the jalapeno jelly on them afterward.

I agree.  The marinade lacked flavor and was too sweet the first time I made this.  On my second attempt, I substituted cilantro for the rosemary and added fresh garlic and additional lime juice, reserving some marinade to coat the chops after broiling.  It was much better with these revisions.

This recipe is fabulous! I had all ingredients except jalape√±o jelly, but red pepper jelly. In the end it was like a sweet n' sour sauce-hubby & 4 yr old picky eater devoured it all! Also, boiled the marinade w/some broth for a sauce-was a big hit as well.

Okay- not bad but not as much flavor as we anticipated.

I made these yesterday for dinner and grilled them, basting with some slightly warmed jelly and the chops came out moist and juicy with a very nice brown glaze to them. The only downside was they glaze wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped for with the spice from the jelly. But I think it was more that the jelly was rather mild to start with and next time I'll search for a slightly hotter version and maybe add some fresh peppers to the mixture as well.

The pork turned out nice and tender - I've never broiled them before.  However, they didn't have much flavor - I even used more jalapeno jelly than it said to.  I think I agree with another reviewer - I would have been better off reserving some of the jelly and serving it as a sauce.

This was very good and very easy. Only change I made was substituting cilantor for rosemary (hate it).  Next time will make them separately from the sauce as my broiler and smoke detectors did not play nice with this recipe ;)

The point in adding a glaze or a sauce is to add flavor.  This recipe didn't accomplish this.

My husband liked this a lot better than I did. It was good but not fabulous in my opinion. I wanted more flavor. He declared it was his favorite pork recipe of all time.

This was a delightful and quick weeknight dish. The next time, however, I will place the sauce on the chops rather than dotting the platter.

Essentially bland and disappointing. I read the other reviews and added red pepper flakes but still the overall the result was very ordinary. I would not make this again.
