This was delicious! I will make note to say the noodle preparation is entirely wrong. The noodles need to soak in warm water for 10 minutes. Then immerse them in boiling water for three minutes, afterwards drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. If you boil the noodles any longer than three minutes they will turn mushy.
