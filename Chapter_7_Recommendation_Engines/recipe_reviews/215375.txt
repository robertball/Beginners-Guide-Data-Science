Made this for Recipe Group and oh man, are these DELICIOUS!!!!! I maed them exactly as written, and feel no changes are necessary. I got 35 cupcakes out of the recipe and I baked them @ 325 degrees for only 14 minutes (my oven is super HOT).  The icing is VERY sweet, but it really compliments the cupcake nicely. I did add a drop of orange oil, just to get a better orange flavor. I was able to ice about 18 cupcakes, but I like a lot of icing, so if you are just gonna spread it on, there should be plenty. I decided to freeze the un-iced cupcakes for another time. I really can't believe how fantastic these turned out...I will be making these many, many more times~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this as the Recipe Buzz Group Recipe for the week of September 27th. I could NOT be more thrilled with these. The cake part is so light, airy, & soft! I was expecting quickbread muffins at best but what I got was actual pumpkin cake! (I've never tasted pumpkin cake before -- many pumpkin quickbreads, but never the light fluffiness of actual cake with pumpkin!) For the frosting I used: 1 tsp OJ, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp. orange extract (and the other ingredients as listed). This let me use less powdered sugar so my frosting isn't sickeningly sweet. It piped beautifully, and tastes like a Dreamsicle. This recipe produced ONLY 24 cupcakes for me. They baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and 35 minutes in 2 different brands of muffin tin. Lastly, when my photo is up, I used a Wilton 1M tip to pipe (outside in, concentric circles). There is just enough frosting for 24 cupcakes using a 1M but I'm sure is plenty for smaller tips or knife-spreading. Thanks so much for the recipe, I can't wait to share these! UPDATE: I tried to get out of making these this year & made apple cake instead & DH had a FIT. He came as close to mutiny as he ever would in my kitchen, so today I made these for him to take to work and we ate the apple cake ourselves, lol.

Fabulous recipe.  I must admit I used a different frosting (cinnamon coffee from this site) but the cupcakes themselves were light and fluffy and delicious.  I doubt they will last long!

Here's another five-star review for these delicious cupcakes!  The recipe made 24 regular-sized and 8 mini-sized cupcakes for me, and the frosting was spot-on perfect!  Another reviewer said hers were done in 22 minutes, so I checked mine at that time, and that was perfect (the minis took a couple of minutes less time).  For the frosting, one large orange produced the right amount of zest.  It's funny how when I buy any fruit with rind now, I always pick it out with zesting in mind!  These are delicious cupcakes!  UPDATE:  This recipe makes about 75 mini-cupcakes and look perfect using an M1 tip to squish on a dollop of the frosting!  Check for doneness at about 15 minutes.

This was one of the best recipes for the pumpkin cake itself that I've ever tasted.  The frosting was not to be ignored but the cake was outstanding!  I made them for my son's end of football party and they were a hit.  The adults enjoyed them too.  I did NOT get 32 cupcakes out of it though, I ended up with 21, I think, and I felt that was filling the cups 3/4 full.  I can't complain.  I kept a few for my family, then sent the rest.  Since I got fewer than I expected, I would've doubled the recipe but I always follow it the first time as is.    My family definitely wanted more.  I had more frosting than I needed and may make another half-batch.  Thank you for this!

These are awesome!  The taste of a Pumpkin Roll without all the work.  However, the baking time only needs to be 20mins.  Delish!!

I made this recipe as is. Icing and all. They are amazingly delicious. Not need to change a thing. I got 3 dozen regular sized cupcakes. I also topped with candied orange peel and a pecan half. These really made me fell like Fall.

I've been itching to make something with pumpkin for a couple of weeks now and these were perfect! I had to make a couple of minor substitutions- like apple pie spice instead of pumpkin pie spice (which worked just as well), but otherwise I stuck to the cupcake recipe.  I did add a bit more orange juice to the icing, plus about a 1/4 tsp brown sugar and a dusting of cinnamon for a hint of spice- yum!  My family and my boyfriend love them, and my dad even asked to take some to work to share. Thanks!

I made these for Recipe Group and they are Outstanding!! This is the best Pumpkin Spice Cake and the icing is to die for. Definately one of our favorite pumpkin recipes that we have ever tried. The cake is moist, tender, perfectly spiced, not overly sweet and best of all - you can really taste the pumpkin. The spices and sweetness do not overpower the pumpkin flavor. The orange buttercream is delicious and is a perfect match. I followed the recipe with the exception of using reg Pure Vanilla Extract (not the 100% Pure Bourbon Vanilla) and would not change a thing. This recipe will be used often, not only during the fall/Holidays, but all year. Our new favorite. Thanks for sharing!

Made these for thanksgiving.  This recipe made a ton of both regular size cupcakes (approx 16) and mini cupcakes (approx 24).  The frosting was awesome as well, especially with the orange zest.  I used pure pumpkin puree instead of canned stuff.  You just have to watch the time for baking the mini ones, they cook a lot faster than the regular sized ones.  So delicious!  This is definitely a keeper!

Just made these for the 3rd time.  Wonderful!  I, too, found that a baking time of 18-20 minutes was enough.  I must not use very much frosting, because I had enough leftover for (almost) a second batch.  The frosting is very sweet, but tasty.  Super easy to make!!

Very moist, with a nice balance of spices.  I will definately be making thnis again.  I did lighten up the cream cheese frosting by folding in fresh whipped cream.  I also swapped out the vanilla extract for maple extract.  My husband loved these!

One of my first attempts baking something other than chocolate chip cookies or cake from a box and they turned out wonderfully - super easy recipe!  I substituted Splenda for sugar and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray for butter and they still turned out perfect.

Perfect!  For a pumpkin dessert, they are very light and soft.  Delightful, really.  I did use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and also used 1 t orange extract instead of orange juice, but aside from that didn't change it.  It made 18 regular/full cupcakes and 12 mini bite sized ones.   The large ones were done at 25 minutes and the bite size ones in 10.  I used all of the frosting on the 18 large cupcakes, but I tend to load mine on fancy with big piping tips.  The mini, bite sized ones most certainly didn't go to waste because they didn't have frosting!  The orange zest is a must, and next time I might try adding more cream cheese to cut the sweetness.  I realized when I was passing the recipe on that I forgot to add vanilla to the frosting.  The orange extract was enough, really.  Took them to a baby shower and everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks!

These were super easy.  The frosting is delicious.  These do no get better the next day though.  They were almost a 5 star recipe shortly out of the oven.  By the next day, I found the cake to be kind of bland.

OMG! These cupcakes are absolutely delicious, perfectly spiced and have just the right about of sweetness. I made these using a Texas sized muffin tin. The orange in the icing definitely complimented the cupcake. I piped that over top and then sprinkled a little pumkin pie spice. These were so good that I'll most certainly be making these again - perfect with an ice cold glass of milk or a piping hot cup of tea!

This is a great recipe! I have to admit...I was out of cream cheese, so I didn't make the frosting that the recipe calls for. I didn't make any other changes, though. I only got about 26 cupcakes out of this amount of batter, not the 32 that the recipe claims. The cakes baked up beautifully and tasted perfect; tender, moist, and sweet, with a very balanced pumpkin spice flavor. Instead of the cream cheese frosting, first, I made a sour cream frosting from this site that totally flopped. Then I went with a tried and true family recipe for French Cream frosting (in my personal recipes!) and it went very nicely with the cake! I topped each cupcake with a light sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice as a final touch. They were fabulous! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These cupcakes are fantastic! I've made them once for work and once for a family event and everyone loved them. The only thing I changed was the frosting, I used orange extract instead of orange juice. It added a really fresh orange taste to the frosting.

Great recipe !!  I made the cupcakes according to recipe but didn't have the pumpkin pie spice so looked up what the equivalent is ...  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon plus 1/4 teaspoon ginger and 1/8 teaspoon EACH nutmeg and cloves can be substituted for 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. 
Very flavorful with using the separate spices .. so will do this recipe this way from now on ... YUMMY !

Just made these tonight, and hubby loved them!  The cupcake is light and fluffy, and the orange zest adds a nice depth to the cream cheese frosting.  Will definitely be making these again!

This is a great cupcake!  It is a bit more dense than other cupcakes, but that's just because the pumpkin is a heavier ingredient.  Still light enough to be a cupcake tho.  I baked mine for only 20 min's, timed it for 30, but checked after 20 and they were done!  Could've even cooked a little less.  I would check them after 18 min's.  I used regular vanilla  and made my own pumpkin pie spice.  The biggest difference was that I added at least 1 cup more of powdered sugar to the frosting.  I wanted to pipe it on the cupcakes and as written, it's WAY to thin for that!  All in all, it tasted really good!

These were delicious! I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp cloves instead of the pumpkin pie spice. I also used half brown sugar and half white. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. I made plain cream cheese frosting, cinnamon cream cheese frosting, and this orange cream cheese frosting. All were delicious! This  recipe produces white frosting, so I added orange food coloring. Beware: Baking time was around 15 minutes, not 30!

I tried this at 5280 feet (Denver) and the ratio of baking powder and soda doesn't work.  I'll fiddle with it, though, because the rest of the recipe looks divine.

Cupcakes turned out moist and flavorful.  Big hit with everyone.

I gave it 4 stars because the icing was way too sweet for my liking.  Good thing I only iced half the batch.  The ones without icing were delicious! From now on I will make the cupcakes but skip the icing.

I kept seeing these pictured on the main page, and thought I'd try them.  Wow, am I glad I did!  They were excellent.  The orange icing went great with the pumpkin flavor of the cupcake.  Everyone loved them!  I got about 30 cupcakes out of this recipe, and only baked for about 22 minutes.

By far the best cupcakes I have ever tasted.  I didn't use mixed spice, instead I used 2 tsp of cinnamon and ground up 4 cloves in the pumpkin puree. I also added 1 packet of vanilla sugar. Amazing taste, texture, everything.  I made a traditional cinnamon roll icing (just the butter/milk/confectioner's sugar) which just took this over the top.  I'm ashamed to admit I hogged most of these and only parted with a few.

Very good!  I made these for a hayrack party we had this fall and they were amazing.  I made mini-muffins and piped the icing and they turned out wonderfull.  The cake was delicious, but I LOVE this icing, and can't wait to use it for other cakes as well!

Excellent recipe!  The cupcakes came out perfectly; light, fluffy and delicious.  Instead of making the cream cheese frosting I bought Duncan Hines Creamy Home Style Cream Cheese frosting and put the OJ and peel into it.  The addition of the OJ made it a little liquidy, so I also added a few Tbs of powdered sugar to stiffen it back up.  I made candied orange peels to place on top of each cupcake.  Made 30 cupcakes and only took 25 mins to bake at 350 degrees.  Will definitely make these again!

I made these for Recipe Group while I was out of town visiting my son and his family.  I put them in the oven just as we were sitting down for dinner.  My granddaughter kept on and kept on asking for one, and she really didn't want to wait for the icing.  In fact, no one else did either.  So everyone had one unfrosted.  Later, I made the frosting and iced them.  We decided this is actually 2 recipes: a great breakfast muffin with no frosting and a really good frosted cupcake as well.  It has 2 completely different tastes.  It made 24 cupcakes. ***Update Thanksgiving 2013 - I always have a craft for the grandchildren to do. This year we made turkeys out of this recipe, using a large round blob of chocolate frosting for the body, candy eyes, orange frosting for the beak and legs, and candy corn for the feathers. I still left half of them unfrosted for breakfast muffins. ***Update Aug 2015 - My 88 year old mother remembered these from 2010 and asked me to make her some without the frosting to keep in her freezer for when she wants one for breakfast or snack.

I made these and topped them with a white depression era (not as sweet as buttercream) and they were incredible!!!  Many friends told me these were the best cupcakes they had EVER had.  

I didn't have the spices listed so I substituted 2 tsp cinnamon and they still came out wonderful!

Definitely a keeper!!!

I used this recipe right after an unsuccessful pumpkin cupcake recipe.That batch was dense with an aftertaste. So I crossed my fingers for this recipe.  First off, it's dairy free. It's light with no aftertaste. The frosting with the orange zest was a nice bonus. I thought with 4 cups of powdered sugar would make it too sweet but it wasn't. Did I mention how light it was? I used homemade pumpkin puree because it apparently makes a difference. They turned out great.

My review is according to the actual recipe with no alterations. Divine cupcakes.
I made them again with my own changes...I used a basic cream cheese frosting with the addition of 1 tsp cinnamon and a few dropped of orange oil instead of orange zest. I drizzled caramel sauce on top of the frosting and added a glazed pecan.  I made them an mini cupcakes and they were a huge hit. Picture is posted.

I just made a batch of these cupcakes and they are absolutely delicious! Moist, flavorful and light. I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice on hand so I just added a blend of cinnamon/nutmeg/ginger and it turned out great. I didn't make the icing though, I used a cream cheese icing instead.

I used this recipe in my bakery today, and everyone raved about the cupcakes!  I didn't have pumpkin spice, so I used 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. allspice, 1/2 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp. ginger and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  I followed the recipe and the icing recipe as posted, and the cupcakes were amazing.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I wasn't all that impressed with either the cupcakes or the orange creamcheese frosting - they were alright, but just that.  However, when you put these two together, they simply SING!  I mean seriously sing - I was amazed at how two ordinary products really came alive.  These babies are fantastic! (don't try them separately - I don't think you'll be impressed).  I quarted recipe and  used home-prepared pumpkin.  Note to self: make full recipe next time (or at least half) - cupcakes came out a little flat while trying to quarter...

These were really good, but a very mild flavor. They needed just a little more pumpkin and they would've been perfect.

Great recipe! I bake a lot (I sell cakes) and I am always looking for easy recipes that are light and fluffy. This one is great and has great flavor. The frosting was good as well. I did add the zest of the whole orange (about 2 1/2 T) and a bit more juice, then about 1/2 cup more p. sugar to make up for the extra liquid. Very orange-y! Yum. I also did not use pumpkin pie spice in the cake, but used a combination of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves (basically the same thing). I also added finely chopped roasted pecans to the top after frosting. All in all, a great recipe. I will definately make this again.

I made these with the kids for a home school lesson....not only did they have fun....these cupcakes were EXCELLENT!!  We didn't change a thing and just added a few orange and yellow non periels and a few chocolate sprinkles.  I did make a small hole in the cupcake to put some frosting in side the cake.  Everyone LOVED them and was asking for the recipe.....which I'm keeping to myself for the moment.  hehe!

These are SO good, moist and YUMMY!  The frosting was kinda moist though, so next time I am gonna try putting it in the fridge to stiffen up before frosting the cupcakes. The recipe make 22 large cupcakes. I made half a batch of frosting and it frosted all the cupcakes with a little left over.

Only made the cupcakes...the icing didn't appeal to me. They were SO SIMPLE! Took about ten minutes from start to having them in the oven. I filled my liners 3/4 full and got 24 very nicely sized cupcakes. Iced them with cinnamon buttercream and they made my husband very happy! His first comment when he walked in the door this evening was, "Those look really nice!"

Definitlely a keeper! I got 23 cupcakes out of the batch and I baked them for 25 minutes. Light and fluffy like others have said. Just perfect. I took them to friends with two little boys to help frost for halloween. We used store bought cream cheese frosting and decorated with candy corn/pumpkins and orange sugar sprinkles. These are delicious!!!

I've been seeing these around a lot and decided to make them, but only a half batch just in case we didn't like them.  All I can say is these are one of the best cupcakes I've ever made.  The cake is moist and delicious with the perfect taste of Fall.  And the frosting, wow, I can't wait to try it on other cupcakes.  It is amazing.  I suggest that everyone gives this one a try because you don't know what you're missing until you've tried them.

made these for the recipe group, they turned out quite dense and were too sweet for our tastes. I used my own pumpkin spice made up of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. The plain muffins were fine and I really liked the taste of the orange added to the icing. Next time I will cut the sugar in half in the muffins and use icing for all of them. I would also like to reduce the oil and add some apple sauce. Recipe made 12 extra large muffins

I made these for a wedding.  I was a little nervous as I didn't do a test run to see how they were beforehand. I got 30 perfect rounded top cupcakes.  I had to add about 1C extra powdered sugar to the frosting (I was piping it) and left out the OJ & zest , but added cinnamon.  (It's what the bride wanted). They were delicious and I received many compliments on them.

These are outstanding!  I only made one small change, and that was I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of applesauce.  I did not make the frosting just because we don't care for frosting. The spices were just right and the cook time was perfect at 30 min. :)

DELICIOUS, BUT A COUPLE MINOR CHANGES NEEDED! As written, the frosting is too runny to pipe a decent amount of frosting. You could spread it, but only a thin layer...not like the picture. This is the only reason I took away one star. (In my opinion, 5 stars should work exactly as written!) If the cream cheese and butter are softened, additional powdered sugar was needed to thicken the frosting, resulting in a too-sweet frosting. Also, For those that like a tall frosting, there was not enough. With my minor changes, it was PERFECT. 1) Do not soften the cream cheese or butter. Keep 'em cold, and beat them straight from the fridge. I have only tried this with my Kitchenaid, so I really don't know if it would work with a handmixer. 2) If you enjoy a lot of frosting, or the amount in the picture, you will need to double the frosting. As written, it is not enough to frost all the cupcakes. With those two revisions, these cupcakes are outstanding, delicious, and amazing!!! I love the orange with the pumpkin, and will be making these again! Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

I made these last night with my 3 year old.  I made some changes to make them a bit more figure friendly.  I kept most of the dry ingredients as written in the recipe.  I tweeked the wet ingredients by doing this:to the eggs, I added 1 cup of sugar.  Instead of the oil, I browned one stick of butter until it turned brown (adds an intense flavor while cooking out some of the butter fat), I added 1 1/2 cups of applesauce to the egg mixture.  The cupcakes came out moist, flavorful, sweet, and wonderful.  It wasn't dense and hard to eat.  They were moist and sooooo yummy!  I recommend the changes; I wrote the modifications on my copy of this recipe for future usage.  I didn't have pumpkin spice, so i sprinkled in cinnamon, ground cloves, nutmeg, mexican chili powder, and a pinch of salt.  WoW

Wow these are delicious!! Love the orange zest in the frosting too, will definitely make again. I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil and used all generic brand products and still turned out AMAZING!

I have made these about 6 times now. The ingredients for them just happen to appear on my table every couple weeks, my hubby says he has no idea where the stuff comes from. I am terrible at making frosting, so I always just use a can of whipped cream cheese frosting.  Also the last time I made them, I only had bread flour in the house, I gave it a whirl, and they just turned out like moist delicious muffins. Everyone I have ever given these cupcakes to has loved them, especially the kids.

Just the right amount of sweet for my taste. Wish there had been a pinch more spice to it, but was happy I could taste the pumpkin.

These were the best cupcakes I've ever made. And I do not normally bake. Rave reviews from all my friends! I didn't have cornstarch (sorry Argo) so added more flour. Didn't use the cream cheese frosting, but have another frosting that I made that was absolutely divine. Thanks!!

This was an amazing recipe! The recipe yielded 24 cupcakes and I only baked it for 20 minutes at 350. With the frosting I halved the powdered sugar and doubled the orange zest. My family is in love!

KEEPER!!! I didn't have quite enough pumpkin pie spice, but still turned out great. Also used canola oil (instead of vegetable) and only 100% whole wheat flour. Cooked perfectly in 30 min. Made exactly 24 cupcakes using about 1/4 c. of batter for each. Next time, I'd like to sub 1/2 c. applesauce for the oil to see how it turns out. Didn't make the icing this time (used store stuff), but I bet it would make them even better! I will definitely make these again!

These were excellent.  It made 28 cupcakes for me with perfectly rounded tops so that I could pipe the frosting on.  Great spicey flavor even without the frosting.  I'd make these again in a heart beat!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Can't say anything about the frosting since I didn't make it. But the cupcakes are delicious. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used heaping 2tsp cinnamon, 1tsp nutmeg, 1tsp clove and 1/2 tsp ginger instead. I love more spice in pumpkin flavored stuff. I also reduced sugar by 1/4 cup and used half white half brown sugar. Next time I'll reduce it even more since the cupcakes are very sweet for my taste. I'll even experiment with using slightly less oil. I pretty much love pumpkin anything so this is a great find.

I can't imagine a better recipe for cupcakes of any kind.  My family wouldn't even let me put the icing on for fear of ruining the perfection.  They are tender, perfectly sweet and moist.  They smell like fall and taste like heaven!!!

These are so delicious!!  I am going to make them every year.  I made them exactly as the recipe calls and they turned out incredible.  Everyone at the office loves them.  I used regular cream cheese frosting because I didn't want to take away any of the pumpkin flavor, since I love pumpkin so much.

I made the cupcakes yesterday for a school function.  I did not make the icing.  I did make some changes.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar for a total of what was called for.  I did not have pumpkin spice so I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I baked at 325 for about 15- 20 minutes - I never really time my baked goods I just keep an eye on them and take them out when they are done.  These turned out vert fluffy like a cupcake should be not dense like a muffin.  Very moist and tasty.  These were the first to go at the function.  I will be keeping this recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I think non-pumpkin eaters would eat these.  So delicious, I love the addition of orange to the frosting.  Its so subtle and cuts the cream cheese taste from overpowering the cake itself.  Going to use these for a Birthday party in November.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying this one.

These were good...not tons of flavor, very subtle pumpkin flavor. Nice and moist though. I used Caramel Frosting IV from this site instead of the orange cream cheese frosting.

These were absolutely delicious and easy to make.  The cupcakes were light, moist, and tasty.  They were a very big hit.  I got 24 cupcakes plus one mini-loaf out of the recipe.   I also pre-measured and mixed all my dry ingredients together the night before and kept them in a sealed container until I was ready to complete the recipe and bake them the following morning.  For icing, as a short-cut, I used two containers of store-bought cream cheese frosting (creamy style), added the zest of 1 orange and the juice squeezed from ½ the orange and mixed with a wooden spoon until creamy.  I highly recommend these -- I'm sure you'll love them.

Yum!  The cake part was fantastic - like others say, it was light and fluffy and moist, like actual cake with pumpkin flavor, not heavy/dense like a muffin.  I made 1/4 recipe and got 8 cupcakes on the small end of average size.  Only needed to bake for about 22 minutes.  I don't like cream cheese frosting so I used a buttercream frosting recipe from this site and added cinnamon, cardamom, and a little pumpkin pie spice.  This worked nicely with the cake flavors.

AMAZING! Don't change a thing! I made this into two 9inch cakes, frosted them w/ the orange cream cheese, stacked them & placed fondant over them, 3 days later they were still moist & soo great! I have tons of turkey day requests for this in place of pumpkin pie!

Great cupcake! we liked them a little better with no frosting-the orange sour cream was overpowering to the pumpkin. Next time I will try a buttercream frosting. recipe made 23 cupcakes and cooked for 27 minutes.

Love these!  They turned out just about of perfect. After reading reviews I made some minor adjustments: a bit heavier on the spices (rounded off the spoons, added cinnamon, and an extra 1/4 tsp salt), and used half & half white & brown sugar. Flavor and texture are just right! Can't wait to see how the frosting turns out.
Uodate: great frosting, too!  I didn't have any oranges,  so I used clementines instead. Really nice flavor with the pumpkin & spices.

SO yummy! i added chunks of cream cheese to the middle of each cupcake batter before i cooked them and they turned out AMAZING! These are delicious and taste similar to Marie Callander's mandarin muffins but wayyyyyy better! :)

This recipe is truly scrumptious!!!  The cake was so light and fluffy!  I followed the cake recipe exactly but used a cinnamon cream cheese frosting instead of the orange.  Soooooo good!  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This was my first time making pumpkin anything and this recipe was very simple and easy to follow. The only thing I changed was the amount of pumpkin spice mix but I also made my own mix with fresh spices. I just added to taste.

Win with these cupcakes.  I took them to a pumpkin patch baking contest and swept.  They were the only item that sold out - raised $50!
Executed recipe to a T (well, used some coconut sugar because I'm trying to get rid of it).  Big hit is the icing - people aren't quite sure what's going on, they just know it's delicious.
Highly recommend.

Really, Really Good!  Made 18 cupcakes that were perfect - nice rounded tops.  Frosting was awesome.  I will be making these often.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used two tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp ginger.

So good!!  Doubled the Pumpkin Pie Spice II recipe from this site for use in this recipe and it was wonderful- definitely a keeper!  I ended up making 24 regular cupcakes and 12 mini cupcakes and all were perfectly sized.

I made these cupcakes for my families Christmas dinner this year. These cupcakes were perfect! They rose nicely and the orange cream cheese icing was the perfect addition. I followed the recipe exactly with no modifications and wouldn't change a thing! I would recommend these for all the pumpkin lovers out there, they are definitely a hit!

Amazing Flavor!! I have made these as cupcakes and in a 9x13in pan. They both turned out moist and delicious! The cake takes a little longer to bake. I have made the frosting called for in the recipe and a Cream Cheese frosting and both ways are great. I now keep canned pumpkin on hand just in case I want to whip these up at the last minute. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!!

Amazing recipe, cupcakes were moist and you could taste the pumpkin.  There is no need to change a thing with recipe is perfect as is.  I didn't have any orange flavored thing, so I made maple bourbon cream cheese frosting, it was a perfect finish.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!!

They were ok, cake was a bit dry but everyone said they liked them. Maybe cut back on cornstarch or omit? I didn't add the orange zest or juice. I prefer a moister cake.

These were amazing! I made them as written, except I used a full teaspoon of salt because I read somewhere else that someone used double salt in pumpkin/cinnamon recipes and it was more delicious. These were wonderful, and I wouldn't change a thing.  Easy to make, too.  The frosting was absolutely to die for, and really made them delicious. Definitely a keeper!!!

PLEASE READ! Ok so this was a great and simple recipe. Totally worth the calories.... BUT you def don't need 4 cups of powdered sugar!! OMG soooo not yummy! I had to add some milk and orange juice as well as a tad bit more of cream cheese. My husband is not a cupcake fan....he thinks he is to "manly" to eat a cupcake lmao but those days are over. I caught him taking two to work with him as a snack lol! Thank you for finally converting him to cupcakes or at least weaning him into them. I love love love cupcakes!

Great Recipe! These cupcakes were super moist and had a great flavor. The frosting is terrific as well. Like other users I added just a drop or two of Orange Extract to the frosting which enhanced the flavor. I'll definitely make these again!

I just made these and they are soooo yummy!  They are just as easy to make as a mix but they are light and airy and have just the right amount of pumpkin, not too rich. These will definitely be re-made several times every fall!

Will definately make again...made my whole house smell like Autumn and I had nothing but positive comments from friends and family about these cupcakes. 
I did not have pumpkin pie spice so I had to improvise with cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and fresh ginger from another recipe. Also did not have Orange for the frosting. It didn't matter.  Had to adjust the time in my oven and reduce by about 10 minutes as my first batch was too browned.

Great recipe! I am just starting to experiment with baking from scratch and this was a great recipe to get my feet wet. I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned and it turned out well. Like others said, at first taste the frosting is shockingly sweet, however, the cake itself is not so they compliment each other well.Will definitely make these again!

Delicious cupcake!! I didn't use the frosting since I didn't have oranges (for zest). I used a cream cheese frosting. Very good!
UPDATE: I mades these again today and this time I did make the frosting. I'm not sure about the frosting...a tad sweet and I'm not sure about the orange juice. The cupcake is MOIST! and delicious!
Pecans in the batter will be great! Baked for 25 minutes

I have yet to meet a pumpkin recipe I don't love! SO GOOD!!!! I had to make up my own pumpkin spice recipe since I didn't have it. I used: cinnamon, allspice, cloves, ginger and nutmeg. I also used the juice of an orange instead of OJ. The frosting comes out a pretty orange. Delicious!

Made these as per recipe.  Tasted great and some even made it to the freezer for a few days.  I topped them with cream cheese maple frosting.  Nothing better for the fall!  Next time I will add some chopped nuts to the batter or do as a frosting topping.

Fantastic!  Rarely do I find a recipe on here that doesnt have a ton of suggestions to make it better.  I tried this one because all the reviews said it was good as is... it is.  Made 24 cupcakes that were just slightly rounded and 7 mini bundt cakes with my leftover batter.  I didnt try the icing - I'll use my own recipe tomorrow when I ice them for turkey day.  The cake was moist with a nice flavor - mine baked for 16 minutes at 350.

These cupcakes were so delicious. But I think next time I will cut down or omit the orange in the frosting. It was a little intense for my liking.

These turned out perfectly.  I live at high altitude so I had to add just a bit of flour, but they baked up remarkably even.  The taste was very nice and I really liked the orange in the frosting.  They were a big hit.

I made these cupcakes with fresh pumpkin puree that I did myself and they turned out phenominal!  They were so moist and flavorful.   They disappeared fast. YUMMMY!  Thanks for sharing your recipe. :)

These were so good!!!!  I was a little apprehensive about the orange frosting, but it was just a hint of orange flavor and it was a perfect compliment to the pumpkin cupcakes, which were super moist!  Took these to work and had to hide a few to take home for myself.  :)

I liked the cupcakes. The frosting was runny, but tasted really good. I think I will double the cream cheese next time I make it so the frosting will stand up on the cupcake.

I like this recipe, but I think the texture is a little too moist. After cooking these and allowing them time to be cool enough to remove from cupcake pan, I found that more than ever so slight pressure will give you a smooshed looking cupcake. How could I remedy it? Too much oil? Add more flour?

I LOVE this recipe.  I make it about once a week and it has been requested in place of a birthday cake.  The only trouble I have is that I cannot get the icing stiff enough to pipe on and look pretty.  I love the flavor and don't want it to change.

I was so afraid that these were going to be dense like a muffin, but they were light and fluffy like a cupcake. It has pretty intense spice flavor. I was was also kind of worried about the addition of corn starch. I have never used it in baking before, but whatever the reason for it, it was great. I did the recipe as is. It made about 28 regular sized cupcakes and the baking time was 25 minutes at 350.

These are delicious! I got exactly 24 but had to scrape the bowl to do so:) I did not use the frosting recipe because I didn't have the ingredients. I frosted 1/2 w/a maple buttercream(my fav) & 1/2 w/"Cinnamon Coffee Frosting" from AR(my hubby & sons fav. I may reduce the sugar a bit next time I make these but I don't think it's necessary, just personal preference.

I took these to work and I was asked when I was bringing more.  I took the suggestion of another's review and used he cinnamon coffee icing, and that was huge hit, and fit the flavors very well.  Plan on making more for this weekend.

Made these for a party and they came out fantastic. Cupcakes are light & fluffy! Only suggestion is use less sugar for the frosting as it was on the too sweet side. Also, i didn't have oj so i just used orange oil extract and it was fine. I piped the frosting on the cupcakes and used a leaf cookie cutter to cut leaves from premade sugar cookie dough to decorate the tops.

These were a big hit with Family today. Frosted with a standard Cream Cheese frosting. Baked for 18 minutes and that was perfect.  Made 27 cupcakes.  Will be making these again soon,

These were so delicious! I got 20 cupcakes out of the batter, and each batch took about 15 minutes to bake. I didn't use the frosting, and they were delicious without it. The cupcakes were very moist and had the perfect amount of sweetness! I used Splenda instead of sugar.

These cupcakes are delicious! I made them exactly as the recipe states. I can't imagine what would make them any more scrumptious. I did only get 20 cupcakes out of the batter, though, just as info.

WOW! These cupcakes came out amazing! They were super moist. I made them a day before Thanksgiving and now, a day after, still moist. The icing complimented it well. I added a little more juice and zest and half a cup less sugar. It was too sweet, even with that change, but everyone else loved it. Such an easy delicious recipe!

Outstanding recipe.  Corn starch?  Who knew?  This is a keeper for autumn occasions.  I made it exactly as the recipe reads.  I will definitely make it again!  It’s going into heavy rotation.  ;)

AMAZING cupcakes!  I cut the sugar in the cake  back to a little less than 1.5 cups and in the frosting by about half.  Still hit the spot for my sweet tooth.  I also added about a tsp of cardamom to the cake and a drop of cardamom essential oil to the frosting, and a drop of orange essential oil to the frosting instead of the oj and peel.  Turned out great!

Very good.  I made precisely as written.  These cupcakes are very moist and have a nice flavor but are REALLY sweet.   I think that may be corrected somewhat with less sugar in the frosting.  Still, I will probably eat more than my share of these!  UPDATE:  I thought them too sweet, but my family was crazy about them just as they were.  They can't all be wrong, so I upgraded my rating to five stars.

Doubled recipe for both cupcakes & icing. Got 48 cupcakes (my pan is considered jumbo) & have quite a bit (1.5 cups or so) of icing left over (not a problem bc I have a spoon)  These cupcakes are amaaaazing. Made them for my daughter's bday which is also first day of fall so added some cute leaf sprinkles! Did not change a thing, & these are PERFECT. (see pic) thanks for an easy & yummy recipe!

Me and my mom LOVED this recipe. We brought it for Thanksgiving and people actually started asking us for recipes! It was divine. The frosting is so silky and smooth. Make sure you bake it for 20-25 minutes, not 30. Our cupcakes finished at 25 minutes. We also added cinnamon on top for a decoration. Definitely recommend for Thanksgiving!

Great recipe. Only thing I did differently was use cake flour instead of regular and I used 1/4 tsp of xantham gum. Also made my own cream cheese frosting instead of the recipes.

Followed the recipe as written.  These were very good, but next time I will add a little more pumpkin pie spice.  I got 24 nice size cupcakes out of the recipe.   
Next time will try  with a butter cream frosting.  Very moist cupcakes.            
 Happy  Granny

They only needed to bake 20 minutes! They came out perfect. I used a different frosting recipe, my own cream cheese frosting recipe and I added about 1 teaspoon of pumpkin spice. I brought them into work and they were gone within the first few hours. Definitely recommend this cupcake. It was moist, fluffy, and absolutely delicious.

Excellent recipe. I did tweak it, using half brown sugar half white, but that's the only adjustment I made. The recipe made 24 large cupcakes for me. If I had used the large sized pampered chef scoop I'm sure it would have been more like 28-30 but I used a slightly larger scoop which made them puff up above the rim quite a bit. I baked them at 350 in a convection oven for 22 minutes & they came out perfectly.

8.7.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/215375/harvest-pumpkin-cupcakes/ ... E liked these, had four.  :D   I went for muffins by reducing sugar to 1 1/2c & didn't fill or frost.   I used my pumpkin spice mix (2t cinnamon, 1/2t ginger, 1/4t nutmeg).  'Think more would be okay, but I do like to taste pumpkin in pumpkin recipes; not mostly spices.   This made 24 muffins in 30 minutes, perhaps 25 next time.  Panko on top before baking is a nice touch & slight crunch.

Phenomenal. I made the recipe just as is, and the cakes were light, moist and absolutely delicious. 

I did make a couple adjustments. I made 12 cupcakes (baked exactly as the directions state) and used the rest of the batter for a pumpkin loaf (baked at 350 for 1 hour). Also, my family doesn't love orange. So instead of the frosting recipe used here, I made a cinnamon & coffee flavored cream cheese icing, which was a perfect match.

My daughter called me from work begging for something pumpkin, so I made these for her.  She absolutely swooned.  They are rich and moist and so easy to make.  I got 24 from the recipe.  She's taking some to work for her friends tomorrow.  It's a hit.  Great recipe and so easy.  Oh, I baked them for 25 minutes, rather than 30.  Perfection.

This is a great recipe. Cupcakes are moist with a lot of flavor. Thumbs up from the kids and the grownups. Made the frosting like it said but without the orange zest since I didn't have any and it was still good. Good cream cheese frosting recipe for any dessert.

I made it as directed except for the sugar - used only 11/2cups (1c white sugar, 1/2c brown sugar) and it turned out so delish! The zest and orange juice really cut down the sweetness. Baked mine for 18min @ 350 and yield 27. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe without changes and it was great. Frosting with orange zest and juice was a fabulous compliment to the pumpkin. A keeper recipe! I baked them about 20 minutes in 325 convection oven.

This recipe is delicious! The only changes I made were to substitute gluten free flour, add 1/2 tsp zanthun (needed for gluten free baking), and use cinnamon cream cheese frosting. 
I will definitely make these again and would consider adding chopped pecans or walnuts to the batter. A must try recipe!!!

What a fantastic recipe...  I can't believe how amazing it was. One of the best cupcake recipes on this site. The only thing I did differently was use a freshly squeezed orange for the orange juice in the cream cheese frosting. I used the whole orange since it really doesn't yield much, but it yields enough. Makes for a yummy orange flavor.. And I puree my own pumpkins for the pumpkin puree.

These cupcakes were moist and delicious.   I did change the icing... used cool whipped icing recipe (from this site) with cheesecake pudding instead of vanilla - and a little bit of cinnamon.   I will definitely make them again.

Delicious ! Best pumpkin cupcake recipe I've made. My fiancé loved them and he claims not to like pumpkin. This will be my go to recipe from now on. I got 26 cupcakes and baked for 18-20 minutes. Never baked using corn starch in batter before, who knew . Thanks.

This is my favorite cupcake in the world. The frosting really compliments the cupcake, I would NOT skip out on it. I add an orange slice candy to the top of mine. Really this recipe is perfect. Everyone I make them for LOVE them!!

I just made these for my son's school Harvest Festival bake sale.  I didn't notice the corn starch or the pumpkin pie spice!  (Not sure how that happened!) They were fantastic anyway.  Soft, moist, delicious.  I didn't have oranges or orange juice, so I made a different frosting: cinnamon butter cream, with cinnamon oil extract and powdered cinnamon, with butter, whipped cream and a ton of powdered sugar.  I sprinkled a touch of powdered cinnamon on each one, and stuck a Halloween decoration on each one.  They were so good, I bought one myself at the bake sale!

I've tried a couple of pumpkin cake recipes, and this is the one I'll stick with.  It was easy, and used normal ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I got 27 average size cupcakes filling papers 3/4 full.  I had way plenty frosting, even if I would have had an extra 5-6 cupcakes.  Delicious!  Thanks for this recipe.

Review from a 9-year old:
Awesome cupcakes!! But I did not use the frosting recipe because I didn't have orange juice. I just used cream cheese, vanilla, powdered sugar & butter for the frosting.

WONDERFUL!! the cake alone is perfect for a loaf without frosting! I did not have the bourbon vanilla extract. I used regular vanilla extract instead. SOOOO making these for future parties!

pumpkin flavor is subtle but overall great taste.  Didn't have orange juice so I used Apple cider.  It seemed like an appropriate choice for a fall flavor.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a hit! Even when I replaced the cornstarch with flour, the pumpkin and canola oil keep the cake soft and moist for days! (Though it never seems to last that long...)
Sometimes, I add brown sugar to replace half the white sugar with and it is so delicious with the addition of buttery brown sugar!

This is the first time I used this recipe and the cupcakes turned out fantastic; my family loved them.  I tried one without the frosting and it tasted so good, I opted not to use it. Does that make them muffins?  Also, I added chopped walnuts to the recipe for a little added texture.

Amazing cupcakes!  I have made them for kids and teachers.  Loved by all!  So easy and delicious!  I had to make my own pumpkin pie spice and added the leftover spice to the frosting.  Yum!

I made a double batch of these for a Thanksgiving party at work.  The frosting was delicious, but I found the cupcakes to be rather dry.  The oil in them soaked through the cupcake liners and onto the box I transported them in, so this could be why.  But I've never had this problem with cupcakes before so I don't know why they did that.  Might use a different cake recipe next time, but I'll use the frosting recipe again!

Great!  I made two loaves instead of cupcakes because I was looking for a loaf recipe with not so much sugar.  Love the fact that the bread is light...not packy and heavy.  Might make the icing to serve with slices.

This is an excellently moist pumpkin cupcake recipe.  However, I must stress that the baking time is extremely wrong; it only takes 20 minutes maximum for these cupcakes!  If you were using this recipe to bake an 8", 2 layered cake, then you would bake it around 25-30 minutes.  Do not overbake these cupcakes.  I also added 2 teaspoons vanilla extract; that's just my thing.

Excellent pumpkin cupcake. It has a nice mild flavor. This recipe is not overpowering with cloves and nutmeg, two spices I am not fond of. It has a great fall taste. The icing is simply scrumptious. I didn't have any Pure Bourbon Vanilla Extract and couldn't find any so I had to use plain pure vanilla extract. I can only imagine the boubon vanilla would make it even better. I may just have to order some online and give it a try. You will not be disappointed in this recipe!

I made these into a pumpkin latte! Made the cake part as indicated. For the foam frosting I cooked 2 egg whites, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp clear vanilla extract, and 1/4 cup light corn syrup in a double boiler, stirring constantly for 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer to mixer and whip until stiff peaks. Frost cupcakes. Next I used Chef John's caramel sauce as a drizzle for my latte. So pretty!

I can say that the cake and frosting is delicious and worth 5 stars!  I baked the recipe as a whole cake....but then instead of frosting it, I crumbled it up and mixed in about half of the frosting to create cake balls.  Coated with dark chocolate and orange colored candy melts to create Halloween Themed Bonbons.  Everyone loved them!

My son asked for a pumpkin cake with chocolate chips for his birthday, so I baked this recipe in 9" layers and added 1 cup of semi-sweet morsels to the dry ingredients.  It baked in the same amount of time - 30 mins., although the layers didn't look done, they tested clean.  The cake frosted very easily. Was exactly what he was hoping for - we liked it a lot!

Fantastic. These were a huge hit at my office - everyone was thrilled that they were actually pumpkin cupcakes. Light and fluffy like a cake with as much pumpkin flavor as a quick bread.

Everyone LOVED these cupcakes. They were awesome! I didn't use the orange frosting though, so I can't say what that tasted like. I used my own cinnamon cream cheese frosting instead.

with a few substitutions ie half sugar half splenda and applesauce instead of oil, this recipe was great.  The cupcakes were moist.  The only real issue was there was too much frosting left over.  4 cups of powdered sugar was not necessary; I'll try using 3 or 2.5 instead the next time I make this.

These cupcakes are phenomenal! I added a cup of chocolate chips to the batter and they were absolutely amazing! Although (as said by a different review I do believe that  cinnamon coffee frosting goes much better with this than the orange cream cheese on listed in the recipe. I made these as a test run for an upcoming event and I will definitely make them again :)

These were awesome, loved the icing also. The key is the corn starch, it turns regular flour into cake flour. Make sure you sift the dry to incorporte the con starch so you dont actually get the corn taste. Im surprised that is not mentioned in the instructions. Will make these often. I halfed the icing and it was plenty.

Best cupcakes I have made in a long time! Made the recipe exactly as written. I made 24 mini cupcakes and 17 full sized cupcakes. I had plenty of frosting for all the cupcakes and I was generous with the amount. Everyone loved these cupcakes and they disappeared quickly!

These cupcakes were good, but not as amazing as other reviewers commented.  They baked up well, but had a slightly funny aftertaste.  They also have sort of a wet/too moist top, which I don't care for.  Not a bad recipe, but I won't be making it again.

These are so delicious! I kept everything the same, except for using half brown and half white sugar (I do that with most of my recipes) and adding a bit of vanilla. I'm not a fan of orange, so I left it out of the frosting. They're so moist and fluffy! I think they'd also be great  with some chopped walnuts of chocolate chips. Will definitely make again!

This is one of the best pumpkin cupcake/bread recipes I have ever come across! Very moist and lots of flavor.  I did add a little cinnamon, but only because we love it. I made 12 cupcakes and decided to use the rest of the batter for pumpkin bread. Only because I was in a hurry that morning. Turned out excellent and will make this again.

These are great!  Fluffy & moist. I only got 27 cupcakes from the recipe. I did cut the sugar a little in the cake. I also only baked them for 20 minutes; they came out perfect. Loved the frosting however I think I would just use a plain cream cheese frosting as I felt the orange took away from the pumpkin cake.

I used 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 all purpose flour.  I was out of cornstarch, so I just added another 1/2 cup of the flour.  Also substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  They turned out great!  My kids gobbled them up!  No frosting for us.  Didn't need it! Yum!
