I tried it just as per the instructions and it came out raspberry sauce. I was skeptical because I had made strawberry jam without pectin the night before and had to keep it at a boil for about 25 minutes until it reached 220°. Strawberry came out perfect, the raspberry never gelled.

Wow!  What a great way to use up a small or odd amount of raspberries!  Just mash 'em up, mix with an equal amount of sugar, a proportional amount of lemon juice, and boil till thickened.  Came out fabulous!

I am very new to canning, and have never made a jam before. First, let me say, that this came out delicious! I may never buy raspberry jam in the store again. I may cut back on the sugar next time just to get a little more of the raspberry flavor, but it really is good as written as well. However, I did have to cook it longer. At 4 minutes, it was just saucy and I started looking at my box of pectin, wondering if I should try to add it. But, I stuck with it, and cooked for about 24 minutes. Being new, I wasn't sure exactly what I was looking for, but it may be just a tad too thick now that it's cooled. I would probably do 20 minutes next time. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

what terrific raspberry flavor - way better than the standard jams.  I cut the sugar a little ( I like tart) and it still worked out great.

Very easy and delicious. Like some of the others, I strained some of the seeds out.  Will make this again.

We have wild red raspberries and they are  very good but  pretty seedy.  I made the recipe twice and it turned out great each time.  I did cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I was concerned that  the jam would be too seedy, but it was fine.

With the exception of the cooking time, I made this recipe as is, and this turned out great! 

8-10 minutes worked out very well; everything began to thicken perfectly, and without scorching. Gave these the traditional 24 hour setting time, and ended up with a vibrantly colored, delicious and well-set jam.

This recipe needs modifications. It won’t jam up under these conditions. I let boil for 25 minutes. Also added 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch to help it thicken. Used the frozen plate method to check (freeze a glass plate in the freezer 10 mins. When jam is ready put a spoonful on. Freeze for 1 minute and if you can run a finger through without it running back together, it’s ready. Can add corn starch or lemon juice boil for 3 mins and try again until it jams up after a minute in the freezer)

I really like this recipe. I strained out the seeds before I measured my 4 cups of raspberries. It made a little over 4  1/2 pint jars. Glad it didn’t use pectin. All the stores are out right now. Jars are hard to find too. Great raspberry year so everyone is making jam.

Still in the water bath. Easy to make. I took some out before the jam stage so I will have a raspberry sauce for tomorrow. Easy to make. Tasty. I cut back a little on the sugar - personal taste.

I like the simplicity of this jam.  Very easy to make, with minimum added ingredients.  Although I find this jam on the sweet side, I still love it.

I made this using a sugar substitute..Truvia, which is safe to can with...This recipe made two to 3 pints for me.   I strained half the mixture to get the seeds out and left half with the seeds.  The jars sealed themselves after filling with the hot mixture.  I opened on recently.  It was very good.  I think just a touch too sweet so I may cut further down on the sugar.  My berries were really ripe.  It spreads perfectly and the amount of seeds in the jam is just fine.  The original mixture was just chock full of seeds.  So I am glad I strained half the seeds out.

It was excellent!
I chose to throw all my jars in the freezer, rather than processing, but the jam turned out excellent!

I reduced the recipe by half and used it to top chicken marinated in lemon and herbs. It was perfect.

Perfect recipe!  I only had 1.5 cups of raspberries so I used 1.5 cups of sugar and a little more than 1 tsp of freshly squeezed lemon juice and it came out perfectly!

I followed the recipe closely but I wish I had paid attention to the comments of the others.  The cinnamon and all spice additions leave an after taste that is off putting.  Next time I'll rely on the berries' flavor.  Otherwise an easy successful recipe
