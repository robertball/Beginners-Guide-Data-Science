Just made this tonight...Mr. P wolfed down 2 huge bowls, one straight after the other, and has already asked for it again. Made a couple of very small changes: used a hand blender to keep the base a little chunky as per Mr.P's fussy preference and added a shake of crushed pepper flakes (ditto!). Thank you very much for the recipe - most appreciated!
