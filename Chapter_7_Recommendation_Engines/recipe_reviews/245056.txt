Please do not waste your lobster.  The unusual amount of onion and the overpowering cayenne kills the flavor of the lobster.  The basic premise is fine, but I've never encountered a risotto that required cream before.  I don't think it really needs it, as the stirring during the cooking creates a lovely creamy texture anyway.  Next time I'd be more inclined to make a basic risotto and put the lobster on top, but these flavors aren't complementary.  The only changes I made were to add the lobster tail shells to the broth for additional flavor and I cut the onion to just half of one.  My family likes risottos and this is one that we just couldn't eat.

I did tweak this a bit, and it turned out fantastic! Rich and elegant, and perfect for a dinner party or special occasion dinner. I used 1 medium size lobster tail and about 7 (20-25 size) shrimp, that I had cut into smaller pieces. After cooking the shallot and garlic in the oil for about 30 seconds, I added the lobster and shrimp, and sauteed until the shrimp turned pink, then removed the shrimp and lobster to a bowl and added a bit more oil, added the onions right to that same pan and carmelized them a bit before adding the arborio rice to toast it lightly. I couldn't see dirtying another pan to carmelize the onions, and this is how I usually make my risotto (whichever kind I'm making), so I just went my normal route. For the broth, I used a combination of homemade fish stock that I had in the freezer with a bit of chicken stock towards the end (because I ran out of the fish stock). I did not add any salt, as my fish stock was salty enough. I also cut the paprika back to about 1 tsp, and the cream back to about 1/2 cup (again, using up a partial carton that I had open in the fridge). I added the shrimp & lobster back just before serving. It was SO GOOD! Would make again in a heartbeat!

Wonderful dish. Will make again. The recipe calls for 2 onions but I felt it was a typo and did 2 cups of onions. I feel this was the right call. I also cut the Cheyenne in half, not because I dislike spicy food, my stomach can’t tolerate spicy food like it use too.

I subbed shrimp for lobster. No offense, but lobster is too expensive for this kind of a recipe. I cut the onions into slices and cartelized them with a little balsamic. Then I took the onions out and cooked the shrimp, shallot and garlic together. When cooked, I removed them from the pan and put with the onions. I reduced the paprika to 1 teaspoon and cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the sherry, I used more of the same wine. I omitted honey. Once the rice was cooked, I added in the shrimp and veggies. Everyone loved it and I'll definitely make it again.

It was very good.  I used 1 or 2 cups of shrimp/lobster stock with the chicken stock.  I did not have more but I think a seafood based stock would work better.   The cream and/or honey is not necessary if you are adding cheese and the Sherry already.   It had an odd sweet taste to it that I could do without when eating lobster/seafood.   I won't add the honey or the cream next time.   The stock, cheese and Sherry made it creamy enough.

Excellent Recipe! Unlike some other reviewers I did not find the cayenne overpowering. It does add a bit of bite, which I like. I found I could definitely taste the lobster. The only drawback is that it takes a while to make, but is definitely worth the wait!

Second time was even better than the first. The key is patience with adding the broth. Keep stirring and let it evaporate fully with each cup. Like with all things, it's better when you take your time ??

Excellent recipe....the only thing I would caution people on is the cayenne pepper, even at a teaspoon,  it is really HOT.  I would cut it in half if I made it again.  I love things really HOT so it didn't bother me but it might bother others.

I used half and half in place of light cream. I will make this recipe again with very little cayenne pepper as I found it overwhelming. (I didn’t think so much as a teaspoon would, but it did.) The texture was lovely. I will rate it again next time.

Loved this recipe.  I changed it a bit.  I was trying to copy a recipe from a restaurant.  Came across this recipe which sounded like it might taste the same but I used shrimp rather than lobster and I added peas.  This is going in our favorites file.
