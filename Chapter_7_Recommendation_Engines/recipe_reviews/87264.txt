wow! I used skinless chicken breasts instead of tenderloins and increased cooking time about 5-8 minutes. It came out great! And the leftover sauce can be used as a marinade for rice. Perfect

My picky husband and 2 year old son love this chicken! I have made this twice now and I do have a couple of suggestions. Most importantly, make sure you don't use chicken that has been "enhanced with broth." The outcome is not nearly as good, but in one instance that was all that was available at the store. Both times I've used chicken breasts and used a meat mallet to flatten them and cooked them a little longer. I used Ken's Steakhouse Italian dressing with Aged Romano, it's perfect! Last but not least, we prefer it without the lemon zest, which can be bitter if you bite into a piece. Using fresh lemon juice gives it enough flavor.

This recipe was wonderful!  I made it for company, and no one could get enough!  I used 6 boneless chicken breasts, and pounded them flat so the cooking time would be shorter.  I did marinate the chicken in some of the Italian dressing and lemon juice for a few hours before baking.  I baked them in 2 pans, and so doubled the sauce recipe and divided it between the 2 pans.  The chicken was moist and flavorful!  I served it with brown rice, green beans, and french rolls.  Everyone's favorite part was pouring the extra sauce from the cooked chicken over the rice.  I will definitely make this again for my family...quick, easy, pretty healthy, and delicious!!

After reading all the five star reviews, I was expecting out-of-this-world amazing chicken.  I really enjoyed it but it wasn't THAT good.  It had great flavor and stayed surprisingly most for chicken breast.  Also, as other reviewers noted, the sauce is great with the rice.  My boyfriend is very picky and he asked me to put it in the rotation, so it must be good!  One thing I particularly liked was that it used common ingredients so I didn't have to make a special trip to the store, and it was super quick and easy to put together.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty and very easy!! We didn't have any Italian salad dressing, so we used Greek salad dressing, VERY GOOD - highly reccomend using it. Also, used (bottled) lemon juice in place of fresh, 2 tablespoons equals the juice of one lemon, zest was omitted. Such a yummy recipe, will make again. :)

My husband really enjoyed this. He can be a bit picky so it is nice to find something he likes enough to comment on! I did not have worchestershire so I used balsamic vinegar. I also added some fresh minced garlic and topped it with chopped tomato for presentation. The lemony flavor was nice. Quick and easy, I will probably make this often.

Very good!  The taste is great and the ease of preparation sends it right up to 5 stars!  I used a darker basalmic vinegar-style Italian dressing from Trader Joe's, and I feared it would be too potent, but it was great.  I didn't have any fresh lemons so I used 2.5 tablespoons of a good-quality lemon juice.  I tasted the sauce before adding the chicken, and it was strong- but it definitley mellows out during cooking.  Served with whole wheat fettucini and steamed veggies- garlic bread would have been great with it too but I didn't have any.  Enjoy this one!

This was so good.  I used three boneless chicken breasts (add 10-15 minutes to the cooking time) and doubled the sauce. I didn't have any lemon pepper on hand, but the lemon juice and zest was more than sufficient to flavor the meat, just add some black pepper.  I also added plenty of fresh garlic to the pan with the butter. With all that sauce it was wonderful served over pasta.

I made this recipe pretty much as is, except everyone was posting how good the sauce was on rice so I put the chicken (I used breasts, not tenderloins) in a 9x13 pan with the spices, sauces and added 2 cups of minute rice and 2 cups of water. I covered with foil and baked for about 40 minutes. It turned out great!

This recipe was a disappointment to us.  It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't that good.  Flavor was lacking and it seemed a little bland, so it was below average for us.  We will not be making this again.  Like I said, it wasn't bad, we ate it - there are just too many other great recipes out there.

My husband loved this recipe. I left out the lemon pepper, and even without it, the chicken had a very strong flavor. I will make this again.

This was good. I think the directions are kind of backward though- I did what others did and marinated  the chicken with the dressing, lemon juice and worcestshire sauce for a few hours. I rubbed the bottom of the pans with butter then, placed the chicken in a pan with the sauce and sprinkled generously with lemon pepper. I didn't add I onion powder or garlic salt because the lemon pepper had enough of those in it. Once it was done I transferred to a chaffing dish. It was still tender a few hours later.  I changed the serving size to 24 for a party.

This was delicious and EASY!.  I didn't have lemon pepper but I did sprinkle a little black pepper for kick, about 1T dried parsley for color, and finished each dish with a sprinkle of shredded parm cheese to mellow the lemon/vinegar flavor.

Very Good! I did use 1 tablespoon lemon juice bec thats all I had. Also used 2 chicken breast but kept sauce serving the same. I think this would be great tossed with a salad. This is a great eating healthy but with flavor meal. Thank you.

This pretty good but VERY, I would omit the lemon zest.  I would also cut down the amount of Worcestershire, as it gave it kind of a funny after taste.

Very Moist and only 5 mins. to prepare! Sauce would be good over rice.  Made as written but you don't need the butter, the salad dressing has enough oil. Will definitely make a lot.

I make this often as I usually have all ingredients on hand. I use balsamic vinegar in place of the worcestershire sauce. The leftover juice is great over rice (I usually cook the rice in chicken broth for added flavor). Broiled asparagus is my favorite veggie to round out this meal =)

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars but I really think as written it's really only 3 stars. I read a bunch of the reviews good and bad ones and decided to double the sauce/ marinade. I also used boneless skinless chicken breast but I cut it into chuncks as I have 2 kids that need it cut up so it's just easier for me to cut it up first. I made the sauce and put the chicken in it then covered and put in the fridge while the oven preheated (because my kid decided to turn the oven off ).  I didn't use the lemon zest because of the little one eating it. I wish I would have made either pasta or rice to put it over but the kids wanted mac and cheese so that's what we ate with it. I personally thought it needed something to offset the taste the lemon and dressing. I do plan to use this recipe to experiment with and try and find something to offset the taste and make this a 5 star recipe!

OUTSTANDING!!! I made this for dinner tonight, and it blew my partner away! She just loved it! I did have to make a couple of minor substitutions...using hoisin sauce in lieu of Worcestershire, and 2 cloves of minced garlic plus a heavy pinch of kosher salt in place of the garlic salt. Served over her Mexican rice, it was fantastic! This is a keeper!!

Delicious!  I made it with 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts and there was plenty of delicious sauce for both the chicken and to spoon over wild rice. Even my very picky husband said the recipe is a keeper!  Update: this is now part of my regular rotation.  I have made it 5 or 6 times, twice for company.  It is an easy dish that everyone enjoys.

I used thin sliced cutlets, instead of chicken tenderloins.  This dish was so flavorful and zesty.  Quick and easy to make.  The sauce will make an excellent topping for rice, which is what I will serve it with next time.

I must admit I didn't eat any of this but darling husband did and said it was really good.  I'm not a fan of lemon flavor.  I used bottled lemon juice (3 T) and only 2 chicken tenderloins.  Sauce was tasty on linguine.  Thanks!

Didn't really care for this recipe. It looked and smelled good but I what threw me off was the taste of the Worcestershire sauce. I couldn't even finish my piece of chicken. Doubt I'll make this again.

Turned out really good. I made this along with steamed veggies. I did marinate the chicken for about 3 hours in the fridge. I don't know if it made a difference though. Next time I will make it without marinating first to see which is better. This recipe is definitely a keeper though. It's so easy to make this for a large dinner. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 Pyrex dish and it came out great.

I'm rating this three stars because it is an easy recipe and a good basic meal. I wouldn't describe it as fantastic or serve at a dinner party as it doesn't have enough "wow."

I prepared this chicken according to the recipe, only omitting the lemon pepper and lemon zest.  The sauce seemed thin and watery and didn't have much flavor.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

I really enjoyed this. My husband and I have been trying to be more healthy and this hit the spot. I cooked rice in chicken broth and added lemon pepper, which. combined with this sauce was really good. My husband typically didn't like rice but really enjoyed these together. It will be part of the regular rotation since it is so easy and really tasty.

Very lemony and exactly what I was looking for dinner. Forgot to add Italian dressing but still liked how it turned out. Very tart but filling. I sprinkled some rosemary on top as well.

Pretty easy. I was skeptical, but everybody liked it fine. That said, it wasn't anything especially creative or surprising. Just a basic, easy, go-to recipe that will please most people (butter is like that).

I was hopeful that this would be good based on reviews, but was let down. I don't think these flavors melded at all...and the result was very bland.

Tasty!  First off, make sure you place the sauce in the dish first and if you're doing 6-8 pieces of chicken (tenders/tenderloins), make sure you use a 9x9 dish.  I used an 8x8 and it was a bit to small.  

The Italian dressing is powerful, so I used a little less then 1/3 of a cup and gave it an extra shake of Worcestershire.  I think I got every drop of lemon juice too.  I used Smart Balance for the butter and its just fine; next time I
ll use about 1 1/2 tablespoons though.  Make sure you only cook the tenders for 25mins, any longer and they will dry up.  

Serve over linguine (don't over cook it if its fresh) and pour some of the remaining juice on it and sprinkle with fresh Parmesan cheese.

My husband and children (who are extremely fussy) loved this recipe.  It is so simple to make too.  I used chicken breasts instead of tenderloins and I doubled the sauce so we could have extra for dipping.  The chicken taste even better the next day.  This recipe has now turned into my husband's new birthday dinner.

I made this for my father's birthday and it was a hit! wanting to make something similar yet different for my son's birthday 2 weeks later, I substituted the lemon (zest & juice) with the zest & juice from half a navel orange, one clementine orange and a tangerine. It was adjusted for 32 chicken tenders and was also a hit!

This was so easy to make after getting home from work at 5:30 in the evening.  I was looking for something different to do with chicken tenderloins, as I buy the kind that come frozen in the bags.  My only change was to leave out the Worcesterhire sacue and add balsamic vinegar in its place.  I poked holes through the chicken so it could soak up the flavor while baking.  This chicken was tender, juicy and full of flavor.  Whole family was happy and I made a chicken sandwich with the leftovers for lunch at work.  Will definitely make again for a quick and satisfying dinner.

This was very good.  I made my own dressing (mostly because I was out of the bottled stuff) using balsamic vinegar and that really added a nice dimension to the dish.  My 22 year old son actually came downstairs to find out what was cooking he liked the smell so much.  After dinner he suggested I try it with fish next.  This was quick too, always a plus.

Made this last night for dinner. I used Wishbone Italian-basil dressing (with romano cheese). I omitted the lemon zest and used 2 cloves minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Used black pepper instead of lemon pepper (didn't have any on hand) and totally forgot to add onion salt (but we didn't really miss it). ^_^  We made double sauce and put the chicken and sauce over wheat pasta. The sauce is very thin and light, broth-like really, but VERY delicious, especially when my garlic bread got inadvertantly soaked with it. If you like sauce that sticks to your pasta/rice, I'd recommend thickening it.   Overall, it was really good. I think next time I'll add squash or broccoli to make it more of a pasta dish since the sauce was so good that way. I'll be eating the leftover chicken and sauce with rice and I can't wait.   My only note is that you can see the oils on top of the sauce, which is a little off putting, but it IS a butter sauce, so this should really just be expected. ^_^

This was a pretty good dish and very quick to make.  I used two large chicken breasts and there was plenty of sauce to pour over the rice I served it with.  I didn't have a fresh lemon so I substituted 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice.  I also used fresh garlic instead of powder and used black pepper since I didn't have lemon pepper.  This recipe is a keeper for nights when I don't have a lot of time!

Thank you for posting this recipe! We really enjoyed it. It was so nice to have everything on hand in the pantry for a change. I used whole chicken breast, raised oven temp to 400 degree and roasted for 40 minute or less.  I think this recipe would also work great for roasting chicken for chicken salads or casseroles.

I was searching for a way to cook the chicken tenders in my fridge and finally found a recipe that had ingredients I already had.  We finished dinner about an hour ago and I thought it was pretty good but I love lemons.  As mentioned, the sauce was good on the rice.  My husband, on the other hand, wasn't that crazy about it so I probably won't make  it again.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Really good. The only thing I did differently was to let the chicken marinate in the salad dressing, lemon juice and worcestershire sauce all morning.  Great dinner!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was so good.  The only change I made to it was to add crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat.  I was generous with the seasonings so the chicken had a lot of flavor.  I served the chicken over a bed of wheat spaghetti and drizzled the sauce over both.  A lovely recipe I plan to make often.

I made exactly as directed and the chicken was very tender. I agree with others who said it had a strange taste. I kept thinking it would have tasted better if I  had left the italian dressing out.  My husband and I both ate it but agreed we didn't want to have it again.  On the plus side, it was easy to make.

Used 6 boneless skinless thighs.  Didn't have a lemon so also used the 2 T. lemon juice.  Quick, simple, no fail, no fuss recipe.  Came out tender and delicious.  Next time I'll put the sauce over pasta.  Thanks!

My husband really liked this recipe. He said that he like how light it was and how it had a pop to the flavors. I however thought it was a little shallow on flavor in the heat catagory. Next time I think it would taste a little better with some red pepper flakes in it to give it a little heat and punch. Other then that is was delicious and very easy to prepare. Everything that you would normally have in your pantry. Thank you for the recipe.

I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars. It was easy to make and the family was relatively pleased. I decreased the worcestshire sauce, but increased the butter, lemon juice and dressing because I wanted a lot of sauce for the rice. We served it with brocoli on the side and the suggested Texas toast. It was good enough to make again- give it a try.

We did not enjoy this chicken that much. It was very moist and fork-tender, but the combination of flavors (Italian dressing, lemon, & Worcestershire) just did not blend well, IMO.

I used three boneless, skinless chicken breasts and kept all other recipe quantities the same.  It was delicious.  Very lemon-y, light tasting (not really a heavy buttery taste despite the name of the recipe).  Delightful over rice.  Thanks!

Given the short list of ingredients, this was good.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt and f/f Italian dressing, allowing the chicken to marinate in the mixture overnight.  The taste of lemon was very prominent, which is always a hit with my family.  Grated some fresh Parm over top and served w/ a side of rice.  Will make again considering this recipe uses common pantry items... thanks!

I just finished dinner and couldn't wait to review this wonderful and easy recipe. I had scaled the recipe to 2 servings. The only minor change I incorporated into the recipe, was to add 1 clove of minced garlic instead of the garlic salt, and a couple pinches of paprika. I love lemons, and next time I might add a bit more. This meal was so yummy, and easy to throw together! I served it with a mix of  long grain and wild rice. Thanks Paynes!

I used chicken breasts for this recipe and they turned out SOOO juicy.. I didn't use the worcestershire sauce, because I find it can be a little overpowering. I made the Lemon Velvet Butter Sauce, on this site, and served that over the chicken and some fettucini noodles. Very tasty!

This was easy to make and tasted great. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce so I used the same amount of soy sauce instead and it came out great. I serviced it with Rice Pilaf. Thanks!

My young kids are very picky, and this was a hit.  However, I did not like it.  Maybe it depends on which Italian dressing is used? Sorry.

I make this a lot, everyone loves it even my 6 yo dtr. my only variation is that I use whatever oil-based dressing I have on hand, which is rarely a basic Italian. tonight I used Greek lemon-basil vinaigrette and it was great! also like to use ken's northern Romano Italian dressing

This is so simple and so delicious!  So much flavor, the chicken tenderloins were very tender and cooked to perfection in about 25-30 mins.  I didn't have quite the amount of lemon the recipe called for but was still awesome! I had extra sauce which was great over penne pasta.  I will be making this again and again, even planning to use it for the next big party at our house !!!!!

If you love lemon and chicken then your going to enjoy the flavor. Following the recipe it's simple and quick, and my wife loved it. I went ahead and bought the Lemon Peal seasoning instead of zesting the lemon I juiced.

We loved this recipe.  We only used 4 chicken tenderloins so there was plenty of sauce to drizzle over the rice we had with it.  The sauce was delicious and really made the dish.

This was delicious with a couple of my changes. I used about 8-9 chicken tenderloins and I used 4 Tsp butter, added a couple of cloves fresh minced garlic to the melted butter sauce. I sprinkled some dried parsley on top before putting in oven. Will make again, my family enjoyed it!

I had all ingredients on hand with the exception of lemons so I used bottled lemon juice. My family enjoyed this and I will definitely be making on a regular basis. The next time I will try marinating to add more flavor. Yummy!

I made this exactly as the recipe instructs several times now. While the oven version is good but can have a lot of liquid left in the pan, I like cooking it in a nonstick frying pan with all the ingredients exactly the same. Using a frying pan concentrates the flavor in my opinion and leaves a thicker sauce to put on the chicken or rice.  It also makes it a more appealing color as the chicken browns a little.

This was pretty good. I used skinless boneless breast because it's all I had on hand. I also used lemon juice from a bottle (2 TBS to equal out the juice of 1 lemon). The dish definitely had flavor, but I wasn't exactly crazy about the flavor itself. Not bad, and definitely a pleaser with my 8 year old daughter. Might make it again, might not. Either way I don't think it would be totally missed if I didn't stick it into my dinner rotations.

Cleaned the house, took long hot bath, put on make-up, fixed this to impress date with the suggested Chardonay and it worked. However, I did not use the lemon zest, he loved it and trust me when I say I am not much of a cook!

I made this because I was looking for something different from the usual recipes I use for chicken tenderloins.  This recipe is quite tasty and I will definitely be making them again.   I modified the recipe slightly as I wanted to ensure that I had enough sauce to put on the brown rice I made with it.  I added a few tablespoons of dry white wine to the sauce mixture then thickened it with a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed into a bit of water a couple minutes before I pulled it out of the oven.

I left the lemon zest out as suggested...but the sauce was great! There was enough sauce to use with noodles as a side.  The italian dressing I used was kraft's roasted red pepper and parmesan italian, so i don't know if that was just an added bonus, as i've never used it before.  excellent inexpensive meal!

I had to add chicken stock and more worcestershire. I had to put parmesan cheese also to cut the intensity. The only saving grace was that the chicken was tender, and the sauce was decent when mixed with the rice and with a lot of cheese mixed it.

Surprisingly good, a bit of an interesting taste and good enough to make on a regular basis.  Love the tenderloins, they are so moist and cook quickly.  I doubled the sauce and poured on linguini after the chicken was finished.  Served with French bread and brown sugared baby carrots.  My entire family, including my 3 and 5-year old children, really enjoyed it!

This was ok. There must have been an herb in my Italian dressing that was off because this had a strange after-taste and i dont know what it was. It looked very nice on the plate though--I served with wild rice and green beans. I served the leftovers over pasta the next day. I will try this again.

Excellent dish!  Very tasty!  I added a bit more Italian salad dressing to make it tastier.  I like the concept of cutting up the chicken breasts in medallions or tenderloins to ensure that the ingredients are well blended with the chicken.

This should be titled "EASY Lemon Butter Chicken".  It is the easiest thing in the world to make, and everyone loves it and thinks it took more effort than it did!

This recipe was very easy to make and had a nice taste to it. I will definitely make this again. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts which I marinated in the sauce for several hours. Since I didn't have lemons I used 1 1/2 tablespoons store-bought lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon lemon extract for the marinade.
I think the taste of the end product depends a lot on the kind of Italian Dressing you are using. I would rather suggest to use 1 tablespoon vinegar, 1/4 cup vegetable or olive oil, 2 teaspoons salt and a mix of herbs you like for the Italian Dressing. This is what I will try next time since the only complain was that a certain herb was too strong but nobody could figure out what it was. However â€“ this recipe is sure worth a try. Thanks! :-)

this was really good, me and my boyfriend really enjoyed. i sliced it on top of white rice then drizzled some of the marinate on top. get a biscut to get the rest of the sauce, clean plates all around.

This was ok.  I marinated it in the sause overnight and it was very juicy, but there was just something missing from this recipe, probably will not make again.

This was very nice. I served with linguine and my husband enjoyed it. The chicken was moist but I thought the flavors were a little too strong and I didn't even use the lemon zest. Next time I will use less of each ingredient. Otherwise, good recipe!

I add a small onion, thinly sliced, to the recipe before baking and serve the chicken and sauce on top of spinach fettucini and grilled asparagus. This recipe is a staple in our house!

We really liked this one.  It was really easy and so good over pasta and broccoli.  I may play with the proportions a bit, as there was a lot of leftover juice, but maybe I will just try as others had suggested and thicken the juice so it is saucier.  Either way, we'll be making this again!

This was really tasty, we ate it over pasta with stemaed broccoli.  I think that next time I will add more lemon, less italian dressing, and a touch of white wine.

I can't believe this isn't a 5 star rated dish- this is the tastiest chicken I have ever had! (ok, with the exception of restaurant chicken.)  It is incredibly easy and I make it all the time now- love it, love it, love it.

I was so excited about this recipe after reading the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly but it just tasted like chicken cooked in italian salad dressing and lemon juice to us. I served it with couscous. Not bad -- we ate it -- but threw the leftovers away. I would not make this again. Maybe you have to use a certain salad dressing? I used an expensive brand from the grocery store.
