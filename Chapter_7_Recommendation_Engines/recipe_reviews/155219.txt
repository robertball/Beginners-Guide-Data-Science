I cooked this recipe according to the directions. I served it as a side dish along with one of the pork tenderloin recipes.

Update: Cut back on the sugar, and it still tastes great!

Everyone enjoyed this dish.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar and see how it tastes.  I used fresh green beans instead of frozen.

This was an utter fail. I wasted all the ingredients by making this. My husband, daughter and I couldn’t even eat it. The cloves were beyond overpowering- like you’re eating a Christmas pine cone without the crunch. The result was a syrupy overly sweet mess. I feel like I’ve been punked. I’m sorry to be a downer but I need to let the public know!!!

I made this for a dinner party and was very pleased with the results.  I followed the recipe exactly (expect I tripled it), and the result was perfection!  Very flavorful and beautiful too!  This is a keeper!
