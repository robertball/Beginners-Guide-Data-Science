My husband is diabetic so  I am always looking for legal desserts.  He absolutely loved this and it could not be easier to make.  Just make sure, as with any cheesecake, your eggs and cream cheese are at room temperature to avoid lumps.

I doubled the recipe and used 12 eggs. Next time I’m not going to double the artificial sugar  it’s a bit too sweet. 1 cup would have been fine. I’m new to keto baking so I’m in experiment mode. The texture is amazing and it’s really pretty. I used 4 tbsp pumpkin pie spice. I used a 16 in glass baking dish. It’s perfect height. Just wish I hadn’t used so much sugar. Bake time 1 hour. Please note this is for the original recipe doubled. I do have a pic added above.

This is sooo good! It tastes just like pumpkin pie. It's nice to find a keto friendly recipe that actually tastes like the real thing.

I have been on a low carb diet (keto)for almost a year and this is the only keto recipe that has been delicious !! 
Also it’s so easy. I put all the ingredients in a blender that way there’s never cream cheese white lumps. 
Best keto recipe ever..!

I followed the recipe exactly. The taste was ok. Felt it was missing something. The texture was amazing!  Felt like real cheese cake. I will definitely try it again but not with pumpkin pie seasoning. I will do my own mixture , cloves, ginger  and cinnamon. Much like I do with a pumpkin pie.

Excellent substitute for pumpkin pie. When I made it I used 1/2 cup each Swerve granulated and brown so it gave it a very authentic pumpkin pie flavor. I’ve served at room temperature and right from the refrigerator. I’d say cold from the refrigerator tastes the best. I cut into 18 pieces which made calorie count 70 and net carb count 2.3 per serving.

I made it using half monk fruit sweetener and half  sucralose sweetener and I made a double batch to make a pie, cupcakes, and bars.  These are delicious.

Love these.....great low carb dessert or can even be eaten for breakfast!
I love a strong pumpkin taste so I added a large can of pumpkin to the mix instead of the 15 oz can.  Added a bit more splenda and some Cardamom (I love this spice).

By far the best Low Carb dessert I've made. I ate it while still warm with a little whip cream and YUMMMM!! I read some reviews and decided to add a little clove and ginger to boost the flavors, baked it for 34 minutes and it was perfect!

Great recipe!  I followed the directions as is.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and added walnuts to the top.  Now if I can keep my family from eating it all at once.  I will definitely make it again.

I had high hopes but I just didn't like this.  Texture was odd (not like cheesecake at all) and the sweetness was off the charts .. it wasn't good.  To try and repurpose, I froze this into a silicone mold and made 'bites' around two tablespoons each.  For a quick 'hit', these are fine.  Otherwise, I would have thrown this out.

Nice low carb alternative to Pumpkin Pie.  I added a dash of maple syrup.  You definitely do not need 5 eggs.  I used 4 and that was more than enough.  For one egg I only used the whites.  I agree with another comment that adding walnuts on top adds a nice flavour

I used 2 real eggs and 3/4 cup of egg beaters.
Very delicious. This will substitute pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.  Also sprinkled a few toasted walnuts on top when I are it. These simulated a crust, plus added flavor

I'm diabetic and I'm finally getting brave enough to make desserts.  This is pretty awesome.  Only question is about serving size.  How do you get 16 servings in an 8" square baking dish?  The pictures are OBVIOUSLY bigger servings.  Are servings 1" squares?  Isn't that just a tease for your taste buds?

The first time I made them, I was pleased, but when I made them again, my only change to the recipe was to double the amount of the pumpkin pie spice, vanilla, and cinnamon to give it more flavor since using a sugar substitute.  They were great.

Did not make any changes.  I did question the amount of eggs but it came out great the eggs made it spongy , if you will, but I really liked that.  Also loved the fact that it took a whole can of pumpkin puree not just a cup like other recipes call for.  No waste.   Will be making it a few times in the next month...

It is delicious if you put it in the refrigerator for a day.  I also added a few walnuts on top and I did cut the sugar( I used erythritol) to 3/4 cup.

I LOVE this recipe! 
(..and Im sorry a photo posted 3 times - app confusion)

I did not have vanilla - I used a teaspoon of honey instead!

I'm VERY much a fan of these! Bravo!

Excited to share and use again!

Family Loved it!  I’m diabetic so is was perfect.  I doubled the recipe using a little less sweetener (3/4 c. Instead of 1 c. Then doubled it) as recommended by other reviewers & it worked out perfect.  I also added a low-carb almond flour crust:  2 c. Almond flour, 1/3 c. Butter melted, 2 Tbsp. Sweetener, 1 tsp. Cinnamon, 1 tsp. Vanilla.  Press it to a 9x12 pan, bake in the oven at 350° for 10-12 min.  Then pour in mixed pumpkin cheesecake filling & bake at 350° for 1 hour.  Didn’t even taste sugar-free!
