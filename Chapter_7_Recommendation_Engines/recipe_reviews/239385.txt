Liked this, but found the flavor just a little diluted.  Next time, I will cut the amount of water in half which also should make it a bit creamier, and less liquid-y.  Not sure, but I might find that completely eliminating the water might work best for me (personal taste preference).  The quantities of olive oil and balsamic are balanced well, and I enjoyed this today on a lunch salad.  I do think the recipe author is correct; you have options with this dressing.  ----UPDATE 10.4.14------I'd recommend you refrigerate this dressing before using because it tasted tons better the next day, definitely more flavor!

Per other reviews, I reduced the water to 1 Tbsp, substituted honey for brown sugar and nonfat Greek yogurt for the mayo.  I used Roasted Garlic infused olive oil, so I omitted the fresh garlic.  I wanted it to still be more creamy, so I added more yogurt, approximately 2 more Tbsp.   I found that shaking it up in a cruet worked just fine, so no need to dirty up my hand blender.  I'm all about cutting down on clean up!  Mayo may not behave as well as yogurt though.

This was exactly what I was looking for! So yummy. I omitted the water like most other reviewers did, and also used Oikos non-fat Greek yogurt in place of the mayo. I accidentally used 1 tbsp of brown sugar instead of 1 tsp but it tasted great despite that! It wasn't too sweet and it's so creamy and doesn't separate in the fridge which is nice. Definitely will be making again!

Wow - this recipe is fantastic!  I'm always on the lookout for homemade dressings because store bought ones are just full of preservatives - plus they don't taste that great.  This one seemed like it had a lot of flavorful ingredients so I tried it and it is by FAR my favorite homemade dressing!  I modified it just a bit though - to reduce the fat, I cut the EVOO in half and used Hellman's low fat mayo instead of full fat mayo.  Made quite a difference in the overall calories and fat content and  the taste is still awesome!!  I also used white balsamic vinegar instead of traditional just because I think the color turns out much prettier (doesn't turn the dressing a strange off-brown like traditional balsamic vinegar does).  Some reviews recommend cutting out the water, but I left it in to thin out the dressing since I cut the EVOO in half.  Overall, a really stellar dressing - we use it for all kinds of salads and everyone raves about the "restaurant quality" dressing!  Thanks for posting it!!

Excellent....used 2 tbsp greek yogurt and 1 tbsp mayo instead.  And, didn't have Dijon so used spicy brown mustard instead and still came out great.

I didn't add water, added a bit more dijon, chopped the garlic in the mini food processor before blending the rest of the ingredients.  It was perfect!it wasn't watery at all!  
  I have not purchased a bottle of salad dressing at the store in years -- look at the ingredients, the main ingredient is usually soy bean oil - nasty.

I always find it useful to read some of the reviews before proceeding. It came in handy here. I gradually added water until I got the consistency that I wanted. I also just whisked it all in a small bowl, and it came out great. Instead of garlic cloves, I just used garlic powder. I also used honey (doubled  it for my taste) instead of brown sugar. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks!

I liked it but I was looking for a little more flavor. The next time I made it I substituted white balsamic vinegar and added a little dry oregano, basil and Romano cheese, tasted a lot like Olive Garden Italian dressing.

5 stars once you omit the water completely. Also, honey is a delicious substitute for the brown sugar.

This dressing is amazing!!!! We prefer a strong flavor to it so we don’t add the water but other than that made as is and it’s wonderful. We’ve been eating wedge salads with dinner every night since we discovered it with a drizzle of ranch and this creamy balsamic. Heaven! Thank you!

I have been looking for a good viniagrette recipe to lighten up my salads and this one certainly fits the bill. Very simple to make with common ingredients.   I didn't have an immersion blender so I substituted a frother from my espresso machine to quickly produce a smooth emulsion that did not separate. Next time I am going to try white balsamic vinegar and experiment with different herbs.

I could just drink this dressing, it's just so delicious.  I followed the directions but next time, I'll triple it at least. One thing, I have really good balsamic vinegar and it didn't need any salt, pepper or anything else.  I did have to use regular mustard.

I only had honey Dijon but it worked. I might add crumbled Feta and green onion to it next time. The dressing did not look like the picture until set in the fridge.

Minor tweaks: used Greek non-fat yogurt instead of mayo (with a touch more balsamic to compensate) and used the whey that settled on top of the yogurt instead of the water,.
For the herbs suggested in the description, I added oregano, basil, onion powder, pinch red pepper flakes and a touch of garlic powder.
This is definitely a "taste as you go" recipe and when you get it right, it's absolutely fabulous!

Very good salad dressing. I shook it in a jar to emulsify it. The tiny bite the mustard gives can be controlled to personal taste by varying the amount added.   This is not sweet, and everything combines to create a complex flavor.

It was a little strong for me but stillvery good.  I am going to try it next time with honey instead of brown sugar and maybe a little water.

Great dressing. 
Careful w/ size of garlic cloves, it can give a bite if you use too big of cloves. I strain to remove garlic bits. 
Utterly delicious. Easy and quick to make.

Made almost exactly as shown.. just used light mayonnaise to decrease calories and slightly increased water for the same reason. My very favorite salad dressing. So much better than anything bottled you can buy. Probably great as a marinade too! Thinking maybe will try honey instead of brown sugar but still delicious as is. Can use Truvia brown sugar too...

This is a quick easy homemade dressing. I used 1 clove garlic and 1 T water. Otherwise I followed the recipe. It was very good and I will make it again.

Added a bit more brown sugar to get a decent facsimile to Boudin Bakery's dressing.  For my vegan family, I subbed Veganaise for the mayo.

There is a local restaurant that I enjoy that serves a dressing just like this. I couldn't wait to make it!! Like the other reviews say, I did cut the water in half so that the dressing wasn't too watery. It's now a personal favorihe, and I was so easy to make!!!

I wish I had read the other reviews. Yes the consistency is too watery and the flavor is weak also.  I will have to make another batch before I can say how good it tastes. It is easy. This much I will say. Next time I will try not adding any water and gradually increase. I will have to toss out this batch. For that I give it three stars as I wasted a lot of expensive olive oil and vinegar.

Wonderful, better than store-bought. I would leave out the added water next time; it was unnecessary and made the dressing more thin than I would have preferred.

I made this once exactly as the recipe said, and it was delicious. I made it again subbing lemon juice for 1/2 Tbsp of the vinegar and using honey instead of brown sugar: it was still delicious, just a slightly different flavor profile that complimented the lemon pepper tilapia I baked. Try it both ways!

Mayo taste was overpowering, but the commenters left some good suggestions. After a few revisions I now leave out the water completely, use deli style boars head mustard (excellent in general) and I use a whole 5.3oz container of yogurt if I'm doubling the original ingredients. Raspberry Chobani really adds a nice flavor and I'm excited to experiment with others.

This was excellent.  I added a little extra mustard and garlic (because that's the way I like it).  But it was great as-is.  I will use this over and over.

Great! I don't use water and I use half plain yogurt and half light mayo to make it slightly healthier.

This dressing recipe is delicious and easy to prepare.  The only change I have made is to use plain yogurt in place of the mayonnaise.  This dressing is great with a green salad and as a dressing for cold pasta salad.

Followed the recipe, tasted great. However the family thought there was too much heat from the garlic. Might just use one clove next time i make it.

My family loves this dressing!! I follow recipe exactly. The immersion blender thickens it slightly(but this still tends to be a thinner dressing) I double the recipe and it lasts in fridge 5-7 days no problem.

I liked this recipe, but added a bit more brown sugar.  I used immediately and enjoyed it.
