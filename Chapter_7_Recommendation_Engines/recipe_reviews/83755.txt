I loved this recipe and it was a hit with all my in-laws as well.  I've now make it twice - the first time I used too much gelatin and it was a bit "tough".  The second time it turned out much creamier.  Word of advice - get the lemon rind as finely ground as possible and try to make sure it doesn't clump together in the panna cotta.  I liked the sauce made with Grand Marnier.  I had to subsitute raspberries for strawberries and the sauce still turned out delicious, though a bit sweeter than with raspberry.  I would not recommend trying to make this days in advance of when you'll be serving it - it gets tried out and icky - it's much better if you make it only the day before or the morning before your event.

Soooooo good. It's very simple to do so I probably make it far too much! The only thing I do dfferently is substitute orange juice for the liqueur.

made EXACTLY as written. this was extraordinary. simple, easy to make. lovely flavor (although could have stood a touch more lemon flavor). The sauce was delightful. Served this for dessert after a steak dinner and it was the perfect finish to a heavy meal. I will make this time and time again!

I'm not sure why, but I always believed that Panna Cotta was difficult, time consuming or complicated.  I could not have been more wrong! This was so easy, fast and fun to make and the outcome is fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly. We loved it. I am sure I will be making this often. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic for those who like orange liqueurs.  This is my absolute favorite panna cotta recipe and there are many out there.  Thanks for putting on this site.

Great recipe, very fresh tasting even without the carton of fresh raspberries. I added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract with the geletin, just for a little more depth of flavor.

This was good. I followed the recipe 100%. It would probably be just as yummy with strawberry sauce or other homemade sauces. I made 6 servings from this recipe, but I felt that the sauce was enough for at least 6 additional servings. I think if you cut the sauce ingredients in half, then it would suffice for 6 or servings.

I added extra lemon zest but found the sauce overpowered the lemon flavour anyway. Both components were delicious, seperately, but I don't think I'll make both together again...

Extremely nice made with Amul cream but some sort of topping is necessary. Takes many hours to set well. Raspberry sauce or caramel is needed.

I was looking forward to trying this, and must admit that I am bewildered by all the great reviews. Despite the bit of lemon rind, and the Grand Marnier, it was quite tasteless. After all, it basically was mostly heavy cream with gelatin, a little sugar and a bit of flavor. It needs more lemon and maybe some vanilla, or more Grand Marnier and orange zest. However, the raspberry sauce was very good.

Delicious, light and refreshing! A really nice ending to a heavy meal or a summer meal.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using real lemon juice instead of the orange liquer, which gave it a really lemony punch.  Will make again... it was incredibly easy and impressive looking.
