I learned how to make this when I lived in Taiwan. So easy. I usually make it with chicken (either breasts, or boneless skinless thighs). I add chunks of carrots and green pepper. Sometimes I put potatoes, sometimes not.  Always delicious!

Just want to add (since I canâ€™t figure out how to edit the recipe)
I add a bay leaf or two while the meat/onion/carrot mixture is simmering. 

I use the mild of both S&B and Vermont curry roux. 

I serve with pineapple, but others serve with pickled onions or that pink ginger. 

Can be served over rice or Udon.
