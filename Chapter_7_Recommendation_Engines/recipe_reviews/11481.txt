I had to write another review. I made these again and decreased the oil and increased the sugar. They came out so much better.I had to decrease the cooking time. These are definatly a keeper now with the changes. Really good cookie everyone loves them. The revised version is now in my receipe box.Makes a lot too. but they don't last!

This recipe calls for pecans and vanilla extract, but I didn't have any nuts; so, I substituted almond extract for the vanilla. Scarlett states that they will melt in your mouth and disappear...and boy, do they ever!!! My husband hid a whole bowl of these from our 14-year-old to make sure that he would have some after the New Year!!! I had to make a double batch to make sure I had enough to put in all of the goodie baskets to give for the holidays!! This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper!! Thanks for a wonderful, buttery, nutty flavor, melt in your mouth, easy to make cookie!!! They are light and crispy, but they stay soft and chewy at the same time. It is very difficult to describe the texture of these cookies without actually tasting them. Definitely NOT A COOKIE TO BE SHIPPED OVERSEAS!!!!! Hand deliver ONLY!!!!!! BUT make sure you make plenty and include the recipe or you will have people bugging you all year to be baking them more!! Qudos to Scarlett for a wonderful cookie recipe, whether you call it a 'sugar' or a 'sandie', it makes no difference...it is a wonderful cookie, of that there is NO DOUBT!!!!

Great recipe!  It made a great deal of dough and I froze half for another day.  I rolled the cookies in cinnamon sugar and didn't use the pecans since my hubby dislikes them.  A definite keeper!

At first I was a little afraid of all the oil in the recipe, but after sticking to the recipe, and then squishing them down with sugar on top, they were amazing! They are very airy and moist at the same time. A hint, I cooled them on a paper bag that was on top of racks because they were too fragile to just sit on the racks to cool. Great cookies!

These cookies turned out great. They are not chewy, but not crunchy. Instaed, they are soft and crumbly and melt in your mouth. I rolled the dough balls in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar before flattening them. I really like the flavor that way. They are a cross between a snickerdoodle, a sugar cookie and a pecan sandie, but they have a texture like no other. I'm sharing this recipe with everyone I know.

It is difficult to find good no-roll sugar cookie recipes.  I decided to try this one and combine it with peppermint frosting and hard candies for Christmas.  My family ate 3 dozen before I even decorated them.  They absolutely loved them!!!  I have found a new cookie recipe.  Great job, Scarlett!  These cookies rock!

We LOVED this recipe!  They taste like a cross between a sugar cookie and a pecan sandie - the texture is heavenly.  My mom even asked me for this recipe - what a compliment!  Use dark brown sugar and mexican vanilla for sweeter flavor.  I suggest baking one cookie sheet of cookies then spooning the rest (making rolls) in sheets of waxed paper.  Place the rolls in gallon freezer bags in the freezer.  Cut, roll in sugar (even colored sugar for kids) and bake as needed.  Thanks, Scarlett for a definite keeper!

I found the dough to be too oily, my hands were literally glistening with a thick layer of oil the cookies were oozing.  Although the final product was pronounced good by my roommates, I found the cookies to be more like shortbread than sugar in flavor and consistency.

Gosh, this cookies came out perfect!  I made them once to put in gift bags for the holidays for my friends, and they tasted just average.  But I made them a second time as a last minute thing for my party, and WOW, they were DELICIOUS.  I baked 50 cookies both times, but the second time, used a little less butter (well, actually, I used margarine).  Probably about 1/3 cup instead of the 1/2 cup.  They came out nice and chewy.  Everyone loved them and were totally addicted to them.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

These cookies were a huge hit- but do not expect tradition sugar cookies. They were much more like a pecan sandie, in flavor and in texture. They were delicious and I made no changes to the recipe, with the exception of excluding any decoration.

Somehow this recipe came up when I was hunting snickerdoodles.  Decided to try it.  It's a 5-star on my evaluation of taste, ease to make and ingredient simplicity.
     I prefer to mix everything by hand so I'd suggest creaming the sugars and butter before adding the oil.  ALSO after baking and cooling store for at least a couple hours, the flavors need to blend and then they taste great.
     Mind turned out to be a semi-soft cookie.  I found that I only got around 80, 2-1/2" cookies from the recipe.
     I'm going to try different nuts and flavoring, and of course colored sugar at Christmas.       
     This is a great basic simple recipe.

I followed the recipe to the letter, but these cookies tasted a bit "soda-y" and "floury".  I was told later that perhaps I should have substituted the baking soda for baking powder, but didn't want to deviate from the recipe.   Also, the cookies were very much like Pecan Sandies, the taste, texture, and level of sweetness.  Perhaps this recipe should be renamed accordingly.

The texture of this cookie is soft but crumbly, like a soft shortbread. If made with ground nuts they resemble a soft Mexican Wedding cookie. They are not soft and chewy sugar cookies, like Otis Spunkmeyer. They are a bit plain and I recommend a generous sprinkle of sugar, or frosting.

These have a wonderful flavor and do melt in your mouth but they were oily and spread wayy out. Next time I will try as one reviewer did and lessen the oil and increase the sugar.. the consistency is too thin and oily.  Will try again.

Very nice! I didn't have any cream of tartar so I just added about a teaspoon of lemon juice at the same time as I added the vanilla. Definitely flatten these cookies unless you like tall, fat cookies. Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies were very good and are similar to short bread (only easier because you don't have to roll out the dough.  The only change I made was decrease the oil by 1/3 rd as suggested by others and dipped half in red and half in green colored sugar to make them more festive. Would make these again.

These truely are the best ever sugar cookies!  I followed the recipe to the "T" and also added my own twist with the decorating.  Adding the colored sugar is fantastic, but another thing I did was drizzled homemade colored icing for any occasion.  They are always a huge hit!!!

I can honestly say these may be some of the worst sugar cookies Ive ever tasted. They didnt melt as much as crumbled/exploded in your mouth. They lack that sweet , chewy sugar cookie taste. There bland and I was very embarassed to give them to my friends.

These are yummy.  Delicate but yummy!  I changed out the sugars for Splenda (1 1/2 cups Splenda, 4 tbsp corn starch mixed in blender for 1 cup powdered sugar) and (1 cup Splenda plus 1/4 cup sugar free maple syrup for 1 cup brown sugar).  These came out really yummy!  Splenda doesn't brown so I took them out in exactly 10 min - and they were perfect!

I used a 1-1/2" scoop (like a small ice cream scoop), packed, flattened with a glass and sugar, and they turned out perfectly.  My hands stayed clean, and it was really quick.

Wow! This recipe is AMAZING! These cookies truly DO melt in your mouth. I'm 16 and this was my first time baking anything, and this was very easy to make. At first I was skeptical of the amount of oil, but I assure you that's what gives them the wonderful savory taste. I ommitted the pecans and I frosted some, then in some other I poked holes in and filled with jam. The jam-filled ones were so fabulous. My family thought I would mess up, but they raved about these cookies and are asking when I will make them again. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.

Scarlett's Best Ever Sugar cookies are good but they are really more of a butter pecan 'sandie' than a traditional sugar cookie.

I only gave it 4 because I modified it a bit - 2/3 c oil as others reccommended and used finely chopped/ground almonds and almond extract instead of vanilla.  End result: a pretty amazing cookie!

Fabulous texture--We liked them best with extra pecans added in and rolled in colored sugar before being flattened. The kids liked squirting designs on them with Wilton's Cookie Icing.  We will definitely be making these again.

A new family favourite.  To decorate for Valentine's Day I dipped a small heart shape cookie cutter in cocoa and then stamped the top of the pressed down cookie before baking.  It left a chocolate imprint that lightly baked into the cookie.

I made these using crushed candy canes instead of pecans and drizzled with peppermint icing as a previous reviewer suggested for a cookie exchange.  I had enough left over to take to a small gathering a couple days later and I recieved tons of compliments and requests for the recipe both places.

These are not sugar cookies.  They are Pecan Sandies and they are fabulous!  I was suprized at how easy they were and how delicious!  But mine didn't make 100, only about 85...and they weren't overly large.  Still, I will definately make these again and again!

I love this recipe! I did decrease the amount of oil to only 1/2 cup and the cookies were perfect.  I keep a slice of bread in the cookie container to keep them soft.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

made these and they were ok... wouldn't really consider them to be sugar cookies.. tasted more like pecan sandies. I don't think I'll be making this cookie again... atleast not as a "sugar cookie".

These cookies were just ok.  maybe its because i left out the nuts.  I expected them to be more like the flat sugar cookies I buy at the bakery, but they were not.  These were more rounded at the top and not as soft in the middle.  If you are looking for a bakery-like recipe, I'd recomend this site's "Easy Sugar Cookies" recipe.  It is more what I was looking for.

WOW! This was a cookie recipe I took on as a first for my little girl (3) to 'help'.  Since I only had one egg after a week with 2 extra teens in the house, I had to halve this recipe.  Following to the tee, the recipe cranked out EXACTLY 50 cookies, as promised!  I did the rolling, (as I am seriously anal about detail)I had my 14 y/o son help his sis with the 'sugaring'.  I followed Scarlett's advice and used one of my mother's tiara glasses that has a beautiful design on the bottom.  I threw them in the oven for exactly 10 minutes and viola!  Perfection.  They look like little sand dollars!  One word of advice...Take them off of the cookie sheets IMMEDIATELY to reduce chance of cookies crumbling.  When they were sufficiently cooled, I called the pack in for a taste test.  Complete silence and looks of satisfaction on all of their faces.  Scarlett, you are the bomb.  Thanks for a family first.  My only regret, that I will have to let my kids take one of my mothers special glasses to make these themselves when they leave the nest:).

This is a wonderful cookie. I agree it does have the consistency and taste of a shortbread cookie. My husband was eating them as they cooled! I do have a question though. Recipe says makes 100 cookies. Maybe the walnut size here in Northeast PA is larger than elsewhere but I got about half that.

I just made these and they turned out great!  Lot count of how many we ate while still baking them.  Taking them to church fellowship tomorrow morning, so they will probably last all of 5 minutes!  These are great, and they really smell great when baking, too. Yum.

The flavor was wonderful!  My cookies never "flattened" out, so they were a little doughy in the middle.  Next time I would use something to push them down after rolling them in to balls, just to ensure the whole cookie was done.  Otherwise, a good cookie!

I have tried a lot of sugar cookie recipes and this one was the best.  I was VERY afraid of the oil but it actually worked out wonderful.  This receipe also doubles very easily.  I doubled the ingredients because I was putting it in my X-mas cookie tins that I give out.  I have cookie trays that have cut out trees, stars and snowmen so I put the down in those and then spread it out and they baked up PERFECTLY.  I recommend this recipe to anyone.

This was just okay for me. The dough was fairly easy to make, but they came out on the dry side. I think I will try again using slightly less flour. They did not really taste like the traditional sugar cookie that I am looking for.

I loved this recipe.  I had to add a little more flour to the recipe so that I could roll them into balls.  Great idea about puting a glass down on them w/ sugar on it.  I made these to start our week of Thanksgiving daily treats for both my husband's and my work.  They taste wonderful and are very light.  Not an overly sweet cookie.

These cookies seem to get better with time.  I made them yesterday and they did seem slightly dry as indicated by others.  Today, however, after staying in sealed tins overnigt, they seemed to have regained some moisture and the butter flavor really came through. I made a batch with and without nuts, both are equally tasty (the kids prefer without).

Incredible tasting cookies.  I was looking for a quick and easy cookie to bake as gifts for Christmas.  They are delicious.  I left out the pecans, and added 1/2 cup extra flour, then I used the bottem of a glass dipped into red and green sugars. I actually got more than the 100 the recipe said.  More like 150, I used a 1oz cookie scoop. They are very crisp, and melt in your mouth.

I make lots of cookies and have never tried a recipe with butter and oil both.  I was a bit skeptical, but soon, a beleiver!  I love these cookies!  My husband and a friend were here when they came out of the oven and they devoured several.  I added 1/4 tsp. of pecan flavoring as well as the vanilla called for in the recipe and I think they are wonderful.  Thanks for making a "believer" out of me.  I'm sure I will make these often....sometimes you just want a plain cookie without all the chips, raisins, etc.  This is it for me.

These cookies are great! My daughter and I made them to give away at Christmas time, so we colored the sugar with red food coloring. The result was a red topped cookie that melts in your mouth. I didn't get 100 cookies out of my batch. I used a commerical cookie scoop rather than hand rolling them. It made about 50 cookies. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is outstanding. The cookies were so good. Best sugar cookie I had. Only thing different I did cause I had to was I used a stick of crisco butter shortening instead of regular butter cause I did not have anything but everything else I followed to a "t" and they came out very good. Thanks so much and will be making these again soon.

These truly are the best cookies ever! They are my family's favorites. But don't try to get 100 servings out of the recipe and making tons of little balls is just to much for me. I cut the recipe in half (50 cookies) and make the balls about the size of 2 tablespoons. That normally makes between 25-30 cookies. I use an AIRBAKE sheet and they come out great. Don't try to use a sheet that has turned brown, the cookies will also. Give these cookies a try, they're great!

Looks like a beautiful cookie and tastes really good. I used some of the advice from the other members and used half the oil and added half a cup of granualated sugar and cut half of the powderd sugar.  I also added almonds instead of pecans and it was great.  I didnt have any cream of tartar, so instead i used two teaspoons of lemon juice for every one teaspoons of tartar. and they came out great. i will keep this one on hand.

Scarlett, this is an AWESOME recipe!  Some of the best sugar cookies I've ever had.  I love looking over the reviews and benefitting from other's advice.  In this case, I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and replaced a 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar for regular granulated thinking to sweeten.  I don't know if either of these substitutions are any better than the original recipe, but I can tell you that the cookies were definitely sweet and didn't seem over oily to me at all ~ just plain GOOD, and now, gone :o).

Very good!! This is the first time I have ever made cookies from scratch, and they turned out very well. I might have one or two left if I don't eat them all when they come out of the oven. Thanks for the good recipe!

Absolutely wonderful!  My family LOVES these cookies!  I love how easy they are to make!  As I do with all my cookie recipes, I doubled this and stored 1/2 of the dough in the freezer.  It freezes very well, too!  Definitely the recipe I was looking for, definitely will make again!!

These cookies have a really good taste to them.  They're kind of dainty cookies, and taste a lot like the pecan sandies from Keebler, but better.  I used pecan chips rather than chopped pecans...I think I might like it better with chopped pecans next time.

these really are the best ever sugar cookies! i had run out of oil, so i substituted mayo which may sound strange, but mayo is whipped oil, after all. anyway, i dipped them in colored sugar before pressing. i'm sure these will be most popular on my holiday cookie tray.

I just finished making these cookies.  They are very good but just a little bland.  I think next time I will decrease the oil a little bit and increase the sugar just a little like some others said that they did.

I'm shocked they tasted so good.  They were a bit bland so I'm adding some orange juice and fresh orange peal, and of course adjusting the flour.  I'm sure both will come out great.

I thought using oil threw the taste off...they definitely needed to be sweeter.  I actually thought they were a little salty and didn't enjoy them at all.  Three stars, though, because my family enjoyed them a lot more than I did.

These are as good as everyone says they are. I did use less butter, instead of the 1 cup called for, I used 2/3 cup and the cookie still had an excelent texture. I added 1 tsp of almond extract as some reviewers suggested. Extra's froze well.

The best sugar cookies we have ever had!!!  Great recipe!!!  I love the fact that it doesn't have to be refrigerated and the diugh is soo easy to work with.  The only change I made was to roll them in colored sprinkles for the Christmas Season!!  They will become a staple in our house every year!! Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

WOW! This is the best sugar cookie recipe I've ever had! My family just loves them and I can't keep enough of them made, they go that fast. These cookies have the best taste and are so moist and chewy. This is the only recipe I use now, I don't even look at my other ones anymore. Thak you Scarlett for sharing it with all of us!!

The second time I made these they were good. But the second time, not so. They had just too much vegetable oil or something! Maybe I will cut down on the oil next time.

The first time I made this I messed up and used a cup too much butter and everyone loved them! They were difficult to bake though and crumbled too easily. The next time I made them I followed the recipe except used dark brown sugar instead of light, and made them very tiny, so I only had to cook them for 6 1/2 minutes and it made a lot more. They tasted great and the small size was nice, I brought to a house with children, and they liked being able to grab a handful of cookies. I will make again.

I normally prefer a soft or chewy sugar cookie, but these cookies are great. My office loved them and the whole batch was gone before I knew it. I tend to "grind" my pecans more than chop because I dont like big chunks of nuts. Comes out great.

These were not a sugar cookie....with that said these were great as a pecan sandie shortbread kind of cookie not to sweet a great cookie to eat with coffee. I substituted 1tsp baking powder and 1/4tsp baking soda for the cream of tartar  and baking soda in the recipe since I didn't have  any cream of tartar  Still they came out great and after making 50 yesterday I'll be making 50 more today.

WOW!! So easy and these cookies are still REALLY good! Trust the recipe...it sounds like a lot of oil/butter but just try it and you'll love it!! I made the cookies smaller thinking it would be better to have smaller servings with so much butter and oil, but now i just eat twice as many at one time!! Thanks for this great recipe!!

These cookies tasted very good.  The reason for my rating is that when I first tasted one, it was not at all what I expected.  They should really be called a shortbread rather than a sugar cookie.

Delicious!!  I've made this recipe 4 times already!
I've omitted the pecans (I rarely have them on hand), and used margarine instead of butter.  They've turned-out perfect every time!
I also by-pass rolling them into balls.  I guess I'm just lazy that way.  :-)

Very good and easy to make. Instead of vanilla I used mint extract, and topped with M & M's and colored sugar.

These are the best cookies ever! Everyone I gave these to loved them and asked for the recipe. I substituted almonds instead of pecans though. A perfect cookie! A++++++++++++++++++++++

This was a wonderful sugar cookie.  I made about 100 for my parents, and they enjoyed the cookies all week long with tea, and begged me to make more.  It has a very good flavor, and keeps well.  Thanks Scarlett. UPDATE 02/2012 - I just made these - cut back on oil to 3/4 cup, used a scant tsp of baking soda and cream of tartar. These worked really well in my cookie press, and ten minutes was the perfect baking time. I got about 50 2.5 inch cookies from the original recipe.

These cookies are so oily!  I had to drain them on papertowels for an hour before I served them!
They tasted ok, but they were definitely too greasy.
I will not be making these again!

This recipe is fabulous. Right before Christmas I was looking for a new simple sugar cookie recipe that was easy for the kids to make and hoping that they  would taste decent.  Well this is the best recipe I have  tried in a long time, and I have stopped looking. They really do melt in your mouth.

I've been looking for a good Sugar Cookie recipe forever, and we LOVED this one.  I ommitted the nuts, and used colored sugars to make them Christmasy. Just had to be sure to press them very flat, then they came out crisp and delicous-melt in your mouth!!

These were great!  I love not having to roll them out, and they tasted absolutely great!!!  But be careful, they are very crumbly - but that makes them good!  I used colored sugars to make them more festive for Christmas.

This is a Fabulous simple cookie!  It reminds me of a pencan sandie, but with that homemade flavor.  Buttery, crispy, and downright YUMMY!
I varied the recipe slightly by first TOASTING my pecans.
This is a keeper!

I don't know if I used bad vegetable oil (just bought it) but I feel like it made the cookies taste very "corporate" like they were made in a factory and then sat in a box and chocked full of preservatives.  It was my first time making them so I tasted the dough A LOT every time I started to add something.  I ended up only using a half cup or less of the vegetable oil and subbed the remainder with coconut oil.  Next time I'll be sure to omit the oil all together and only use the coconut oil.  I think that taste will blend everything together better.

My family loved these!  Don't make the mistake I did, though, and let the butter get too soft before creaming with the sugars and oil.  My batter was too thin and sticky to form well, and the pretty pattern I pressed before baking disappeared during baking.  :-D

I was expecting these cookies to be really great and for me they weren't.  They turned out very crisp and crumbly.  I enjoy a more chewy and moist sugar cookie.  My kids enjoyed eating them however, so I know they won't go to waist.  I also decided to substitute crushed candy canes instead of the nuts.

These cookies are awesome! The addition of the pecans really set them apart from the traditional sugar cookie.  I used all organic ingredients, pastry flour and unsalted, toasted pecans and these cookies just melt in your mouth!

Yummy cookies! I usually use a recipe for sugar cookies that requires rolling the dough out, and this was much simpler (and less messy).. I messed the recipe up in a couple places as I did a half-batch, and accidentally put too much baking powder and soda (no cream of tartar here, so I used a previous reviewer's suggestion of soda and powder) and we didn't have any pecans so I just added a half-cup of flour... But they still turned out really good! I made five other types of cookies and breads yesterday, and these cookies seem to be the ones that are disappearing the fastest. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are great!!! I just started making my yearly quota of Christmas cookies. I thought I would try these, and from now on they will be one I make every year! My husband just ate 6 of them, out of the first batch. I rolled them in powdered sugar, after they cooled a little bit. YUMMY!!!!

Wow!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I haven't let anyone else taste them yet, but I found them to be Y-U-M-M-Y! I think they taste like a cookie should taste--slightly crispy, not too sweet, and nutty.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I do have my dough in the fridge for a few minutes so that it might be a little easier to roll into balls.

This is indeed a Pecan Sandie. I rolled them into balls a bit smaller than a golf ball and then allowed them to cool until warm, not hot. Then I rolled them in powered sugar and allowed it to melt slightly and dry on a baking rack. My husnband really liked these. Otherwise I followed the recipe! Very Good.

These taste more like a really sweet pecan sandy than a sugar cookie.  Very easy to make.  Don't skimp on the butter or oil, they come out somewhat crumbly when biting into them.  Easy and delicious.  I needed 12 mins. for baking time and they turned out a perfect golden brown on the bottom.

Everyone raved about these cookies! They aren't overly sweet and have a nice texture. I've made them a few times now and I'm sure I'll be making more in the future.

One cup vegetable oil?!?!
I'm a resident adviser and I baked these for my floormates.  They were very well received and I found them rather tasty, but geez 1 cup oil + 1 cup butter is a lot of fat any way you look at it.  The dough is dripping with oil as you put it on the pan.  I'm sure there's a way to make sugar cookies this good that won't harden the arteries.

They tasted great, but looked a little weird.  Also, they didn't make as many as I thought.  I might have softened the butter too much, but they wouldn't come off of the baking stone I used to cook them on!  They tasted good enough though that I would try them again!

I think that this was a cross between a sugar cookie and pecan sandie, Too dry for me.  I think that they should be called scarlett's sugar cookies.

These were really good cookies and they were easy to make.  Like someone has already pointed out they are very fragile.  To save yourself some time don't press them. They melt just fine and are alot less fragile - I also added extra vanilla.  They do taste alot like pecan sandies and if you skip the pecans and add cinnamon they taste just like snickerdoodles.

These are excellent sugar cookies.  They really do melt in your mouth.  I doubled the recipe and still don't think I'm going to have enough to make everyone happy.  I did chill my dough before baking though, made it a little easier to handle.

Simply scrumptious!!!  This has to be the ultimate sugar cookie so far that I have found here.  And they are great to decorate.  My kids devoured them as they cooled...and all 100 disappeared too soon!  Will surely make again and again.

A friend of mine e-mailed me and asked if I had a sugar cookie recipe.  I didn't but came to allrecipes.com and e-mailed this one to her.  I copied it for myself and made it the same day.  This one is a keeper.  Melts in your mouth.  I love that it makes a lot of cookies because I usually double recipes.  I love this one.

Great flavor, but too fragile .. they broke apart in the cookie jar.  Because I liked the taste, I will try them again, but maybe bake them a little longer.
