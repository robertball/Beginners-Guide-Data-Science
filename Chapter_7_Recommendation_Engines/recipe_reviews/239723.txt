I really loved this recipe.  It turned out light and tasted so good my husband wants his fish cooked this way often.

I love cooking with my sidekick (son)! We followed the recipe with the only change being that we had a "white" fish. It was received from friends who had unmarked packages of fish. The little fish background I have, I figured it'd be a subtle flavor so I just tried this. I have more "unmarked packages" and don't mind using this recipe again. Thanks to the contributor!

We had a dinner party at which I was serving a pork tenderloin.  About two hours prior to when I was to be serving guests, I found out that one guest is a vegetarian, but eats fish.  I did a quick recipe search and found this recipe.  I was able to obtain the ingredients and cook the dish with time to spare!  Not only a quick dish, but the flavor is fantastic.  I got compliments on the dish by all who ate it as well as compliments on the presentation.   I'd recommend this to anyone.

Simple and tasty! I made this with talapia instead of whiting. It's very flavorful and even though I'm not great at heat control I still managed to do this without burning anything. Watch it carefully if you're bad with heat like me because butter can go from brown to burnt pretty quick. Don't be afraid to add more butter if you think it's reducing down too low and starting to burn.

This is really similar to piccata preparation, and I prefer the piccata prep instead because it's a bit more forgiving with the wine in there to keep your butter from burning and it adds more of a zing to the flavor.  But it's great to know that if you are out of wine, or you just don't care for wine in your meal, you can still make this delicious sauce for your meat!

This recipe was quick to assemble and cook. The fish was light and tasty with a flavor of the brine from the capers. To the sauce I added 1/4 cup white wine. Very good dish

This was easy to make, and so good! I used another type of white fish, so I'm guessing this be yummy with any white fish. Omitted pepper, and used potato flour to make this recipe gluten free. Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly except used fillet of sole. This was really delicious. I think squeezing lemon juice over first before cooking made it very tasty. This will become a regular on our dinner rotation.

Super easy to make and delicious. I ran out of capers though but it was still good. Quick tasty meal! Hubby loved it. So flavourful, no tartar sauce required!

My family loved it. I made the recipe exactly as written except I used rock fish because that is what I had. You could probably use any white fish.  I served it with butter garlic noodles and broccoli.

Incredible- I only used the same amount of thyme for the capers.  The fish doesn't really need the sauce!

Very good!!  I used Mahi Mahi,  I added a white wine lemon mixture after the fish was cooked then boiled it down.  Then continued with the recipe. There were no leftovers...

Very good!  I added a step and saut√©ed kale in the butter, steamed until tender.  Then removed kale and prepared the lemon caper sauce. (i used less lemon as well)  Served the fish (arctic char or mahi-mahi is good as well) over kale, drizzling lemon caper sauce over both.  Very tasty.
