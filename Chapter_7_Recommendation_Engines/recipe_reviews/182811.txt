Delicious breakfast wrap! I used a bit of milk vs. sour cream to get the eggs nice and fluffy and added some shredded Parmesan cheese at the end vs. using Cheddar. I used regular bacon and threw in some sun-dried tomatoes along with the rest of the ingredients. I put my tortilla in the microwave for a couple of seconds to get it warm. This was really good and a nice combination of flavors - very filling!

Had this for breakfast, Delicious. Pesto was a nice change. I used leftover canned diced tomatoes, egg beaters, frozen artichokes and reduced fat mexican cheese. I also used canadian bacon since I forgot to take regular out of freezer in time

We were out of many of the ingredients, so I used some garlic instead of onion, mushrooms and celery to add to half the tomato we had left, and milk instead of sour cream. Tried chicken sausage instead of turkey bacon. Delicious, and I definitely used extra pesto!

DELISH! This has alot of flavor & uses only 2 eggs,  1 slice of bacon, & low fat ingredients so the "guilt" factor is gone. Its easy to make & a great change from the usual w/e b'fast fare.  Thanks Spinn!

Great recipe.  Nothing not to like about it.  If there is something you don't like, just sub something else.  In fact, that's a good way to vary it.  Go Italian one day, Greek the next, and Southwestern the next.  Change up your cheeses, and your condiments and even the meat!    Thanks Spinn

Turned out great and very tasty. But I think I'll save my pesto for paninis and pasta.

My husband loved this dish.  I used milk i/o sour cream, canned diced petite tomatoes and real turkey bacon bits.  I couldn't remember if he liked artichokes so I left them out.  He can't wait until I make it again.

This was great! I had some leftover pesto that I needed to use up. I didn’t have the tomato or artichoke, which I’m sure would be delicious, but even without them this wrap was a winner! I topped the wrap with sour cream and bacon bits. It looked pretty and tasted wonderful.

I added some roasted poblano from my garden.  The egg-sour cream mixture cooks up nicely to a good consistency for the burritos.

I added sundried tomatoes because I had and love them.  Used real bacon.  Delicious.  Next time I would add more pesto for a stronger taste.  I might try the suggestion to spread it on the wrap.

I would have never thought eggs and pesto tasted so good together! This was very easy to make. I doubled the recipe and made enough to have wraps for breakfast each day this week. I omitted the artichokes and used real bacon and milk instead of sour cream. They came out perfect!

I tripled the recipe and made 4 wraps.   I did not use artichokes, and subbed one small chopped tomato for the grape tomatoes.  I added the pesto just before the eggs and I used real cooked bacon and chopped it in the mix.  I waited to add the cheese after the eggs were just about cooked.  Very tasty, great with hot sauce on the side.

Delicious! I didn't have any bacon on hand, so I just made the recipe without bacon. It was very filling and delicious! Oddly enough, It reminded me of this ground turkey pesto wrap I had at a restaurant once. I had extra Feta Cheese and added about a tablespoon. Will make again. Awesome vegetarian option if you omit the bacon. Thanks for a great recipe!
