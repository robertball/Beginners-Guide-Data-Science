These are pretty good.  I love lemon, but I still left out the zest.  I used about six cups of green beans and they were still a little greasy for me. I make what we call green fries which is very similar to this. I use uncut long green beans, placed in a baking dish single layer then sprayed with olive oil cooking  spray and sprinkled with course ground salt and fresh cracked black pepper. Then I bake them at 400 for about 20 min. As I remove them from the oven I squeeze fresh lemon over the green beans and toss. This is still a good recipe for a change up every now and then.  Green beans are my favorite vege (I could eat them every day), so its great to have a bunch of recipes for them.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  If you don't like lemon, like rest of my strange family then I don't recommend it.  The lemon comes off more strongly than one would expect.

I must agree with those who found the lemon a little overpowering, but can be tolerated if using a smaller amount.  I first had a recipe similar to this when visiting Spain.  The quality of the olive oil and lemon is what makes this a delightful side dish.  Some lemons are more bitter than others and nothing can replace good olive oil which can be expensive.

Don't get me wrong, this recipe is FABULOUS, but I happen to be a very strong advocate of Lemon.  I'm just afraid if you're not as fond of lemons, you may not find this appealing:).  It ROCKS for me though:).

This was a very easy recipe.  I added about 2 tablespoons white wine and 1/2 tsp chopped garlic.  I served it with Salmon w/lemon, basil cream sauce from this site and white rice.  At first I thought that it would be too much lemon, but it was good!

This had way too much lemon even while omitting the lemon zest.  I'm giving this a 4 though because I'll be keeping this recipe but decreasing the lemon just a bit.  Also I thought there was a bit too much oil used, I had to drain the beans afterwards.  But overall a good twist to an ordinary vegetable.  Thanks!

I leave out all the lemon and ad fresh garlic.  I also use about the same amount of butter as oil.  Everyone loved it, the time is right.  I also used fresh cracked black pepper.

Green beans can be so boring and this recipe gives them such a nice flavor.  I sprinkled a liberal dose of sesame seeds over top when I was finished sauteeing them.

Quick and easy to prepare. I used haricourt verts (thin French green beans). Adjusted the seasonings a bit for personal preference. Will make again.

Great receipes that got my veggie hating partner to eat veggies. I did not have lemons so I used freash limes and instead of garlic salt i used a few cloves of minced garlic at the olive oil step. I also followed the advice of a reviewer andtopped the green beans with toasted seasame seeds.

Left out the lemon zest and thought they were plenty "lemony".  Also used fresh garlic in place of garlic salt.  Cut down on the oil and butter a bit too.  Will make again.

This recipe was great! I added some water to it and then covered it to let it steam them a bit, they were warmed thouroughly but still crunchy, which was what I wanted. Everyone who had them loved them!

loved the lemon flavor-just cut the zest and keep the juice if you're not a lemon-head.

I love this.  We sometimes use orange or lime to add a varity.  Have yet to try grapefruit.  Add some sesame seeds for an added burst of flavors.
