absolutely delicious. I altered the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cup and increased the amount of lemon juice to just under 3/4cup. (I like my lemon squares tangy!) I also added two drops of yellow food colouring just to make it more visually appealing.

absolutely fantastic!

HELPFUL MUST DO TIPS: I wasn't sure which reviewer/changes to make when I first made this but after several times, the first few folks have it right.  I LOVE sugar, but you really need to cut the sugar down to 1 1/4Cups, and add 3/4C lemon for it not to be too bland and to actually taste any lemon.  At 3/4C ...it's far from too lemony.  I also think it's necessary to put the coconut the last 15 minutes and not right before baking or it will burn and not look appealing!  Lastly, I did add a nice quick squeeze of yellow food color (submitted pic) to make it look like lemon.  The women loved this.  The men of course still wanted chocolate cake.

This was not what I expected.  I expected traditional lemon squares - crust & lemon filling - but with a sprinkling of coconut across the top.  Mine came out with no real definiton between layers.  I think it's the massive amount of butter in the crust that blends the layers and gives it more of a cake-like consistency.  The more I ate them, the more I liked them - especially b/c traditional lemon bar crust can become quite crumbly - these were not at all.  Very good, I'll make them again.

I made a Gluten Free version of these by using coconut flour instead of reg. flour and half coconut oil and half butter.  I also cut the sugar like many suggested to 1 1/4c, and used 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice.  i cooked them for 13 mins, then topped them with coconut and cooked for another 6. they were perfect and amazing!!! People who aren't gluten free couldnt tell that these treats were! :)

This is fantastic.  Tastes almost like a lemon pie.  I added a tsp of lemon zest to my filling and also let it bake for 15 min before topping with the coconut.  My final product has 3 distinct layers and is very yummy.

I altered a bit, following other reviews, I decreased white sugar to 1 1/4 C and only used 1/2 + 1 tbsp butter to crust as it was all I had, 1/2 c is what I will use next time. It was very buttery, can't imagine what 3/4 c would look like. Also, I used 3 eggs, instead of 4. They tasted great! I will definitely make again! My husband who isn't a big lemon fan loved them, too!

Oh my goodness, these are just SO good I can't stop eating them.  Who knew coconut and lemon would taste so good together?  I made the recipe with no changes and it was perfect.

Hubby and I absolutely LOVED these! I have made many lemon bars, but I feel these were by far the best. I followed the recipe to the "T" and had perfect results. Sweet, tart, rich....but all balanced nicely. I find that a lot of lemon type bars are either too sweet or way too tart. This was a happy medium. We also loved the coconut factor, delicious and will most definately make again!

These were fabulous. I did as others suggested and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup more lemon juice. I would not have wanted them any sweeter. So easy and delicious. My son who doesn't like coconut even thought they were good.

quick, easy to prepare and delicious! I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 dish. The squares were a little thinner than I would like when slicing them.  will make again for sure!

These are really good- I love the contrast of the chewy coconut to the soft lemon filling- but they are REALLY rich and REALLY sweet.  I subbed 1/2 c whole wheat flour and used only 1/2 c (1 oz) coconut.  Next time I will add some lightly toasted coconut, on top of the untoasted coconut, and see how it turns out. I had to cook this for the full 25 minutes to even begin to see any golden brown, and my oven was accurate the last time I checked (not long ago.)  FWIW, with the subs I made above, the recipe is about 77 calories if cut into 48 bars. (Not sure why nutrition info isn't coming up.)  To get the 48 bars, I cut this into rectangles (4x6) and then cut those into triangles.

I'm sure I'll have more input once I have made this again.

Very tasty coconut lemon squares! I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups and used 3/4 cups of fresh lemon juice. I placed the coconut flakes on top of the squares after 10 minutes of baking to avoid burning. These were very tasty! The lemon flavor is there and that is due to increasing the lemon juice in the filling. It is not overly sweet- it is just the right sweetness and tartness! The bars are buttery soft with a lemony flavored filling and a tasty coconut topping. The coconut and lemon really work well together! I think the next time I may add some lemon zest, double the amount of eggs, lemon juice and sugar for a thicker filling and maybe a little more coconut flakes on top. I may also use an 8x8 pan instead of 9x13 because the bars were a little on the thin side. Thank you for sharing a delightful dessert!

Best homemade lemon bars out there!  I baked them a 9x9 pan, using half the crust mixture, with 1/4c lite butter, and full recipe for the bar mixutre--decreased to 1 1/4c sugar, and increased to 3/4c lemon juice (as others suggested).  Also added coconut about 15 minutes into baking time.  Bars were just the right about of sweet, lemony-tartness--nice thickness using 9x9.  Cocunut adds texture and a nice flavor contrast too!  Thanks for an addictive recipe!

A lemon lover's dream. I used 2/3 cup of lemon juice not a 1/2 cup.  No other changes.  After it cooled, I used a plastic knife to cut them.  Thanks for the recipe!

OMG!!! these are amazingly delicious. I'm not a fan of lemon, but I was compelled to make these for a meeting. They were a hit! My kids gobbled them up like crazy and now I have to make more tonight. I added a half cup of coconut to the crust which made it more tasty. I didn't put the coconut on top until the last 15 minutes of baking in fear of it burning, but next time I'll add right away. Most of it didn't brown because of it. Still delish.

I liked the idea of these bars, but I kept tasting a bad "eggy" flavor in them. I like eggs a lot, but occaisonally when desserts call for too many of them, I can taste them in a negative way. Hope this is helpful.

These were AMAZING! I brought them to a work function and my boss was still talking about them the next day. 

I added 1 tsp of lemon zest to the shortbread bottom, added slightly more lemon juice than was called for (but less than 3/4 cup because I was afraid it would be too lemony given that I added zest) and added sliced almonds to the coconut topping. As another reviewer suggested, I didn't add the coconut/almond topping until the last 15 minutes of baking.  Next time I would stick to the 1/2 cu lemon juice, but other than that would do it exactly the same. Thanks  so much for this recipe!

Delicious ! ! ! When I made these I was not paying attention so I added the coconut to the egg mixture and they turned out perfect. I would do it the same way next time. Lovely squares and so very easy. Nice strong lemon taste. I mixed the bottom until it sticks together so it won't be crumbly.

really good and really easy.  i rated it 4 stars because as written, it's only 4 stars.  if you add a bit of salt and change the sugar and lemon juice as other reviews recommend, it's 5 stars.

I made these at Christmas time and am making them again today. Loved by everyone. But instead of using lemon juice from a bottle, try using 3 large fresh lemons. Makes all the difference!  Enjoy

Really nice lemon square.  Gave 4 stars because like other reviewers, I used 3/4 cup of lemon juice. Used all of the sugar but added a heaping tablespoon of flour to ensure filling would set. Also mixed all filling ingredients including coconut and then poured over cooked base so the coconut wouldn't over brown.

These were very yummy, although the lemon flavor overpowered the coconut, so it wasn't really a new flavor. It did have a different texture than the standard lemon bars and a great crust.

These were really delicious! They were easy to make for a quick dessert! I decided to add mini chocolate chips to half of the lemon mixture before baking and they were even more delicious! I served them to friends who willingly helped out with the 'taste test' and everyone agreed that the added chocolate chips were the best! Yummy! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe tastes amazing! So yummy! I did as other suggested and used 1 1/4c Sugar and 3/4c fresh squeezed lemon juice. (3 large lemons did the trick!) I added some allspice and vanilla to the crust to add a little more flavor. I also added the lemon zest of one lemon and a tsp of vanilla to the lemon/egg mixture. I also followed others advice and added the coconut at the last 15 mins of baking time. Came out AMAZINGLY delicious! If you are feeling extra sinful, add whipped topping! Great recipe!

These bars are wonderful! I simply LOVE them. I, also, increased the lemon juice to 1 3/4 C. The crust is very delicate...like a shortbread cookie. I place the ingredients for the crust in my food processor and just pulses it til combined. Then pressed it into the pan. It did not fall apart at all. Definately, don't add the coconut until the last 10 min or so. These are new part of my all-time favorite cookie list!

I made these for a group of 150 elderly folks tonight at the retirement home I work at. Using other's advice I upped the lemon juice quantity and it was nice and tart. Also I took other's advice and added the coconut just a few minutes prior to it being done, and I threw some frozen berries and almond slivers on top too. The result: buttery, mildly sweet crust, sweet tart lemon curd, and the irresistible taste of toasted coconut. In the case of my squares, the berries lended a juicy touch and you can't go wrong with toasted almonds. They turned out great and the residents LOVED them! 
My only complaint is that even though I was cooking for 120 people, I had to use the recipe multiplier to its maximum amount (300 servings), and then double that amount (600 servings!). I had just enough for all the residents with about 5 pieces leftover (125). So unless you want the bars to be wafer thin, make sure you at least double the recipe, if not triple it.

I followed this recipe to a "t" except I added 3/4 cup raspberry jam to the baked crust before pouring the lemon/egg mixture.  Beautiful colour contrast and a wonderful sweet/bitter taste.  I'd definitely make this recipe again!

I had limes on hand and used them. I backed the sugar down to a little over a cup, and 3/4 cup of lime juice. I omitted the coconut. Refreshing treat.. yummy!

Yummy and so easy to make.  I've made this three times for office functions.  By the third time, the whole thing took less 10 minutes (not including the baking). It's easy, doesn't require fancy ingredients and can be changed to suit you.  Instead of coconut on top, I used powered sugar.  And I added a few teaspoons of mango or pineapple juice to experiment.  It worked out great!

I must say that I do prefer a traditional lemon bar over these. The lemon taste wasn't as noticeable as I was hoping for, so I would follow the suggestions of others to increase the lemon juice to 3/4 c.

We love lemon bars and we love coconut so when I found this, I had to try it out. Per other reviewers, I reduced the sugar by 1/4 c and added 1/4 c of lemon juice, but made no other changes. I also added the coconut after 10 minutes of baking time to lessen burning. The crust was thinner than we like so if I made this again, I would double the crust part. The flavor was good, but DH and I agree that the coconut doesn't add anything since the flavor is drowned in the lemon and really just flaked all over and fell off when you tried to eat the bars. I'll stick to my tried and true lemon bar recipe.

I followed the measurements exactly as listed, for my first batch, it tasted great , but seemed to be missing a little tartness, or something. Then I made a second batch with the following adjustments: 3/4 c lemon juice instead of 1/2 cup, and added 2/3 c chopped pecans I baked the crust 18 minutes at 350, then removed it, sprinkled on the coconut and pecans, then poured the egg/lemon juice mixture over top. This came out incredibly well, I think the only thing I will change is another few minutes of bake time after adding the coconut/egg mixture.

An excellent lemon bar recipe (although I have not tried another recipe or tasted one before this!), that is relatively simple..  and ends up as a refreshingly sweet/tart treat.  I did not have coconut flakes, and therefore substituted with white chocolate chips and chopped walnuts.  I may double the lemon filling next time, to produce a thicker bar.  I decreased the sugar by half, since I knew I'd be using white chocolate chips, and I also only used 3 eggs to avoid an "eggy" flavor.  Perfect!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

My hubby, who doesn't like lemon bars, loved these!  The coconut added a wonderful special texture and flavor.  My coconut must have been sweetened though, as they weren't as tart as I like them.  Next time I will up the lemon juice a bit.

Yum! These are super good. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8 X 8 pan. I did reduce the sugar a bit and upped the lemon juice. It turned out with perfect flavor...  not too sweet, not too tart. I was worried that the coconut with blend in with the lemon layer, so I waited until the last 10 minutes of baking to add the coconut.  Thanks for sharing! :)

I am sorry; we didn't care for these at all. Not lemony enough (needs more lemon filling as well as a stronger lemon flavor), a little dry, and the coconut just really took away from it. The crust had a nice texture but was REALLY buttery. I usually love coconut, but I think the texture of it just wasn't right for this dessert.

Very nice! Easy to make as well. I suggest using fresh lemon anr/or lime juice though and use a little bit less sugar (1/4 cup) for more citrus flavour.

Perfect the way it is, although I added a few drops of coconut extract to help enhance the coconut on top.  Really good!  I like how the filling stayed really moist and soft.

I made these for the first time over this Christmas. I picked this recipe because it was easy and the reviews looked great. I was not disappointed. This was one of the most popular treats I baked this Christmas. People kept asking for the recipe and each time I baked a tray of these lemon squares, there were NO leftovers.

I've actually never tasted a lemon bar before this, so I don't have anything to compare these treats to. However, for a totally new experience, I think they came out very well. I made some adjustments based on reader's reviews -- I decreased the "regular" sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups and increased the lemon juice to 3/4 cup. I also added the coconut (unsweetened, from Whole Foods) to the pan during the last 10-15 minutes of baking. I'm glad I made these changes--the bars turned out sweet enough, and there was still a strong taste of lemon. The coconut did get toasty and brown quickly, so I am glad I waited to sprinkle it on last. (I also patted the coconut into the bars a little bit so it didn't flake off as much later on.) I baked the mixture for about 30-35 minutes; I waited until the bars were almost firm to the touch, since I wasn't sure how wobbly and mushy these are supposed to be. I liked how they came out--very much like little custard cakes. I would make these again for lemon-lover friends.

I'm somewhere between a 3 and 4 stars on this. It wasn't what I was expecting. It's good, but a traditional lemon bar is better. This tastes, as DH put it, like lemon soaked cake and coconut. It didn't have much true lemon flavor, and we could barely taste the coconut. I used real lemons, too.

I followed the recipe exact, except for adding yellow food coloring as many said they had done. I liked the idea of adding coconut to a lemon bar. I thought the flavor was great, but the middle 'bars' didn't hold their shape so I'm not sure what I did wrong but they did come out messy for me.

These were absolutely delicious! :) I took the advice of using less sugar& more lemon juice which made them nice & tangy. I also HIGHLY recommend adding the coconut the last 10-15 minutes because it burns so easily. I added almonds along with the coconut& the result was a very pretty very tasty lemon bar. I made these last night& already there's only a couple left! :)

Since this was the first time I'd made these squares, I decided to follow the recipe just as written. Some things I'll probably change about these bars the next time I make them will be to add a little lemon zest, ( I love the tartness!), wait till they are almost done to add the coconut, ( or even toast the coconut beforehand), and probably bake them a little bit longer.  My oven may not bake as hot as some others, and for the most part, most of the bars were just fine.  I think that the entire pan  should have been a little firmer than they were.

This recipe is super easy to make.  I also reduced sugar to 1 1/4 cup and used 3/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice.  Probably the most delicious dessert I have ever made.  I'm definitely going to spoil my appetite on these tonight!

I thought these were delicious. I made them for a dinner and they were even a hit with the men. I did follow Chef Joy's alterations which was cutting back the sugar to 1 1/4C and adding 3/4C of lemon juice. I also used Wilton's yellow food colouring to make the yellow stand out. Adding the coconut the last 15 mins was also done as suggested by Chef Joy and it was perfect timing for the coconut to be in the oven without getting burned. Great recipe and perfect squares for dinner parties or showers.

These weren't near as good as i expected. I definitley  prefer just regular lemon bars over these! I reduced the sugar by half a cup, which made them the perfect sweetness, but they didn't have much lemon flavor at all, could definitely use more lemon!!

I liked them very much. They were pretty easy to make and the crust tasted good.  I didn't taste the coconut very much, but that was okay because I love lemon.  They held together better than I thought they would.

perfect blend of lemon and coconut, use unsweetened flaked coconut not the sweetened shredded kind.

I made these for a bridal luncheon this weekend and they came out really good! I didn't alter any of the amounts on any ingredients, but I did add lemon zest to the lemon mixture. Also, after the crust came out of the oven, I spread a thin layer of raspberry preserves before pouring the lemon mixture. Everyone loved the raspberry addition! Very good recipe!

I just finished baking these really easy to make squares.  I really enjoyed these but i gave it only 4 stars because it is just a bit too sweet for me, but i can handle it.  these are perfect for any lemon fans out there. Thank you for this great recipe. I highly recomend this to anyone.

Sweet, buttery, with a little tartness mixed in.  Pretty much can't beat that.  I mixed the coconut in with the lemon juice.  After baking and cooling, I added a glaze made with lemon juice, powdered sugar, and some lemon zest.  Perfect summertime dessert.

Phenomenal.  The sour lemon mixes so well with the sweeter coconut.  The texture contrast is also fun. As many others did, I used 3/4 c of lemon juice and also added around 1 tbsp of lemon zest.  I also decreased the cup of sugar to just a little over 1 c.  Not too sweet, not too sour, and everyone gobbled them up.

I made this recipe exactly as written. I took the bars to a cookout and ended up bringing at least half of them home. I liked the lemon taste, but I didn't feel the cocconut added anything to the recipe. Next time I'll just make regular lemon bars.

These are delicious. I made them to take to Bible study, they loved them. I had to cook the crust about 2 minute longer than the recipe. I also put more coconut on top. Great recipe and very easy

I followed the recipe as stated, and while we did like these they weren't what I expected.   Given the amount of lemon juice, I was expecting a nice tart flavor to contrast with the coconut. However, they turned out more like a coconut custard bar. In fact some people I served them to said they would never know that lemon juice was even in the recipe.  So flavor wise they were very nice, hence only 4 stars.

Taste almost just like the boxed kind. I was not crazy about the coconut on top. I'm not sure I could even really taste it.

I am sorry, too, but we didn't care for these either.  I decreased the sugar as others did and it was still too sweet - it was almost as if all you taste is the white sugar.  I added an extra 1/4 C of lemon and it still wasn't lemony enough.  The coconut only added sweetness, not real coconut flavor.  The crust was really dry and still flakey with all that butter.  The top lemon mixture did turn out really chewy, but that was the only thing I liked about these.  These taste like preserved, processed, packaged treats.  Really sorry - I wish I could say we liked them but I will not make these again.

I made these one day and they were amazing!! They are so easy to make and taste delicious and I made them for the fair and I got 1st prize!! They don't even need cream cheese which is expensive, so this is a great recipe!! I love the coconut, it gives a dash of flavour to the already sweet and flavorfull treat!

You would never think that these were so fast and easy to make by tasting them.  I had some left over toasted coconut I wanted to use and came across this recipe.  I used “plastic lemon” juice because that was all I had on hand and put in a tsp of lemon extract, they came out fantastic!  The crust was crisp and the lemon filling was creamy.  The coconut really compliments the lemon flavor.  A great spring/ summer dessert :)

great twist on a classic!  the coconut adds that little something extra.  I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 glass dish.  added the zest of 2 lemons to my filling for a great lemon taste and yellow color.  topped with powdered sugar.  very easy, thanks for the recipe!

Oh so good!  I also did as others suggested and cut back on the sugar alittle and increased lemon juice.  Also added a few drops of yellow food coloring for more color.  These are still hot from my oven but I had to taste as they smell delicious.... can't wait to have more after they are cooled or seems would be good chilled with a dollop of whipped creme.....YUM!!!!

Everyone agreed that this was a 5* recipe, even my husband who doesn't like desserts much.  My mom and I both commented that the only thing that would make it more special would be to drizzle them with a raspberry sauce prior to serving.  Can't wait to try!

These came out great!  I like them much better than the lemon squares I usually make which brown too much on top.  I will definitely make them again but will add more coconut :-)

Delicious! I read a few other user comments before making and found that the changes other people had made were helpful! Will be making this again for sure!

I have also added lemon zest to the bottom and lime zest and juice to the filling! Amazing :)

I usually never follow a recipe to the "T" however I did for this recipe and honestly I didn't like it.  Keep in mind that I do have different tastes I would suggest adding a little bit more sugar to the base crust which was fantastic I might add however, the lemon filling really needed more lemon.  I'd suggest adding a tsp of lemon extract with the lemon juice.

I made these as the recipe states and they were very good.  I had to come up with something quick  for unexpected company and this seemed to fit the bill.  So glad I found them- thanks for a great recipe!

Too much crust.  I made the adjustments suggested, lowered the sugar to 1 1/4 c and increased the lemon juice to 3/4 cup, but there was too much crust and not enough filling for my taste.  I also normally love coconut but next time I make lemon bars I will look for a recipe without.  I think this would have tasted better with cool whip or whip cream on top rather than coconut.

This was very good. It was not too tart but still had a good lemon flavor, and the crust was delicious and moist.

I did as others had suggested, reduced sugar to 1 1/4C, increased lemon juice to just under 3/4C, added yellow food colouring and 1tsp of zest to filling, also baked for 15min before adding coconut. They came out pretty good, I felt there was something not quite right with the crust though... it dominated the flavour of the square a bit too much! I made this along with another lemon bar recipe from this site (Easy Lemon Bars) for a party and this one got the least votes. Still an above average recipe though.

I'm a big fan of lemon baked goods, however these fell a little short. The coconut added definate texture and flavor to the lemon, but overall the filling was sort of mushy, and I didn't wait for the crust to cool (as the recipe didn't instruct to do this) and everything sort of melded together, there was no separation between the layers. I wouldn't make these again.

I have made the lemon coconut squares previously and they were really enjoyed by all.  I am confined to a wheelchair and this recipe is easy for me to do.  I will check into your other recipes in the near future.

These were good, but definitely add zest.  I used 1 orange and 2 limes and it tasted just like lemon.  I will probable add more coconut next time.

Texture was fine for us.  I did not mind that it was very sweet.  My issue is that I could hardly taste the lemon.  I even added some lemon rind.  Next time I'll add lemon extract or lemon kool aide which works very well in a pinch and you don't want to add more liquid. Try it sometime.

I concentrated the lemon juice by heating it and got a super lemon taste, but the coconut was lost. the base was a bit crumbly and overall the bar was super thin. will try a little less lemon next time and cook in a smaller pan to thicken a bit...overall still a good lemon bar recipe.

I was just shy of having 1/2 cup of lemon juice, so I added about 1/2 t of lemon zest just to make sure i'd get a very lemony flavor.  These are delicious!!!

Great recipe!!  I found this recipe this morning about 4 am and had it ready to eat by 6 am breakfast a men's group has every Thursday.  Simple and turned out great the first time.  I did use 3/4 cup of lemon juice as one review recommended.  I too like a little kick in my lemon deserts.

Easy recipe.  Didn't terribly impress me, but I did like the coconut dynamic.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were incredible!  I took them to a party and everyone who tasted them ate two or three more.  Yum!  Have to try this recipe if you like coconut.

This is my first time making lemon squares and I've gotta say WOW! The flavour is beautiful, a perfectly balanced amount of tang and sweetness. I did do as others suggested and upped the lemon juice a bit. Thanks for the great eat!

I have never made a slice like this before and I think I may need a little practice. My oven may have been a little too hot so next time I will have to keep a closer eye on them. Otherwise good flavour all round.

A great spin on regular lemon bars! I did everything just like the recipe said, but I added more lemon juice to make it tangy-er. It was great and they were perfect. I don't know why some people's ended up all mushy together. Mine turned out fine! I cooked them in a 9x3 dish.

These were very good! Only changes I made were that I halved it and used some whole wheat flour for the flour. The coconut on mine didnt really toast up, but they were still tasty. Lemon bars are one of my all time favorites, so these hit the spot! Yum!

These bars are phenomenal.I used a little more lemon juice,(3/4 cup) and added 4 drops of yellow food coloring,but had I not made these changes,the bars would still be good.I am taking them to a baby shower tommorow,and my only worry is that I will eat them all before I get there!
I will make these again for sure!!

It is so easy and tasty!  I like my dessert to be less sweet, so I used half the amount of sugar and increased lemon juice to 3/4 cup as a previous reviewer said.  Coconut adds sweetness, too, so it was plenty sweet that way.  Also, I added just 1 tsp of flour to the lemon mixture to make it a bit cake-like.  I will make it again!

Seriously... this recipe is ultra-yummy!  I didn't have all-purpose flour so I used what I had left: self-rising flour.  It turned out great and the 2 of us scarfed the whole thing down in 24 hours.

Absolutely loved these.  My 10yo son made them all by himself and they were perfect.  We used lime juice in place of lemon because that is what we had and we used a full cup of coconut on top because we like it so much.  YUMMY and Easy

I didn't realize until half way through this recipe that I didn't have any granulated sugar.  I substituted 1 1/4 c. powdered sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar, and they still came out great.  I will definitely be making these again, but next time I will make sure I have some sugar in the house.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved the really moist lemony flavor.  I did add the coconut to the lemon mix before I read all the instructions and it was delicious with it thru out. I lowered the sugar to 1 1/4 cups like some of the other cooks suggested.  I will be making this again and again.

I used the food processor to make the crust, rinsed, and then used it for the lemon mixture.  It worked really well for me.  On the advice of other reviewers, I used 3/4 c. lemon juice and reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 c.  I also waited until the last fifteen minutes of cook time  to add the coconut. Turned out perfectly and I will make them again.

I used less 1/4 cup less sugar and 1/4 cup more (meyer lemon) juice as suggested and one less egg (in a double batch). Its still not tart enough for me.  I was ok. Not sure I would make it again.  It did blend all together and make more of a cake.

I was not impressed with this recipe. I had to leave off the coconut, since it somehow disappeared from my baking cabinent, but I am a HUGE fan of lemon bars in general and thought it wouldn't matter. I pulled them out 2 minutes early and they were still so ugly!

Turned out wonderful and 3 layer color for some reason so pretty, cut down on the sugar as suggested by another to 1 1/4 cup was still super sweet,,  coconut yumm... i will see if i can cut down further on the sugar to 1 cup why not for a slightly lighter taste think it would be even better for all :)

These lemon squares are very tasty. I followed the recipe but made a few changes recommended by other reviewers. Cut back on the flour, add more lemon juice. They came out a little thin in my opinion, so next time I might make them a little smaller. Also, I used bottled lemon juice and cheap store brand eggs and mine were a nice bright yellow without having to add food coloring.

I tried the 1 1/4c sugar and 3/4c lemon juice that the reviews suggested and I thought the lemon overpowered the coconut.  So, I will try what the recipe recommends.  If you love a lemon flavor then the above measurements are for you.  Also, I agree to put the coconut on during the last 5-10min of baking so it doesn't burn.  Overall, they taste good.

Great recipie....thanks ladies for the tips....I incorporated several of your ideas and a few of my own and they were delicious. I'll definitely make them again. 
• Made the Gluten Free Version by Replacing All purpose flour with same amout of Coconut Flour  
• Sugar reduced by 1/4 cup 
• Lemon Juice increased by 1/4 cup (I used fresh and added some lemon zest as well) 
• I also added some 'meringue' (spelling?)…2 egg whites beaten with a little white sugar - spread over top then sprinkle the coconut over that. Then cook on broil on middle rack a few minutes (watch closely! ) 
• I also suggest reducing both the temperature and the cooking time for the  base…..mine was done in 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  
Easy to make ! :) 
Thanks!

VERY GOOD....the coconut on the top is unique and adds a slightly "crisp" top instead of just a plain top or powdered sugar.  These held their form nicely as well...I have made some recipes that are just too mushy, but not these!  I have made them a few times, and always receive compliments!  Definitely worth a try!

These were delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as written, and everyone really enjoyed them.  The lemon and coconut is an awesome combination!

Very good. I like the combo of lemon and coconut.  I think that I would like a bit more filling, so I'll do that next time.  As usual, I added more lemon.  Thanks!

Very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. The crust is very "shortbread like". The  good and bad thing about these are there is so much butter--but butter is good :) I  liked the contrast w/ the sweet and tart- i love coconut but it didn't take too coco-nutty (if that's a word) anyhow yummy and I will make this again!

These were very good. I liked the extra lemon - most recipes call for about 1/3 C instead of 1/2 C and think that I will keep that ratio for the future. I also liked the addition of coconut. If I ever need dessert with only pantry items, this will definitely go to the top of the list. Thanks for a nice recipe!

In fairness, I'm not a lemon bar fanatic, but I anticipated more of a coconut texture with the recipe and the flavor, while tasty, wasn't to die for.  Perhaps with double the coconut it might have come closer to my expectations.

yum. i over beat it though and the yolk ended up floating to the top, causing it to look like the bars had 4 layers, but it was still good.

These were pretty good.  I did cut the sugar and upped the lemon as most reviewers suggested, I was just disappointed that the coconut did not stand out as much as I had hoped.  I might try these again and up the lemon a little more and for sure the coconut.

These were wonderful.  I used a full cup of lemon juice and added an additional egg.  I left the sugar ratio alone and they turned out wonderful.  I also used a full cup of coconut and it was fine.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This wasn't as good as I expected. I made as directed, but if I were to  try again, I would add extra lemon juice and cut the sugar as suggested by other reviewers. I found them too sweet and not tart enough for my taste. Also, they don't seem to be holding together all that well.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were fantastic.  I took them to a 4th of July potluck and they were the first dessert to disappear!

These were pretty good, but I think I would have liked them more if the crust was a bit more defined.  As someone else mentioned, crust, lemon filling and coconut sort of meld together into these moist, lemony squares - there's no real definition between layers.  I replaced half the flour with whole wheat and it gave it a nice flavor, the lemon flavor is yummy but I think I would have liked a tiny bit more texture from either the crust or coconut.  Still, a nice, lemony bar that I'll probably make again!

Fantastic, and easy... I love lemon and these are just great. Makes plenty for just the 2 of us, maybe too much, so may try freezing a few to see what happens. I also added some extra coconut, otherwise followed exactly and would not change!

Very good lemon bars! I made these because my boyfriend loves lemon and he thought they were so good. I used 1 1/3 cup of sugar and 3/4 cup of lemon juice. Will make again for sure. So fast and easy :)
