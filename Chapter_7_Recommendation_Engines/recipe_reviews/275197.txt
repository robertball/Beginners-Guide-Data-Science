Super! I put the pork shoulder in the crock pot this morning and we had an amazing dinner tonight! I used frozen blueberries made my own chili sauce cut up fresh pineapple and substituted beef broth for beer. Instead of using a potato masher I used an immersion blender and it really made a delicious sauce that I added the shredded pork back into. I used King's Hawaiian Sweet Rolls to make sliders layering chopped cabbage (slaw mix) the pulled pork and slices of purple onion. The flavors blend beautifully! For the one gluten-free family member we used GF bread. I served three per plate and everyone raved!
