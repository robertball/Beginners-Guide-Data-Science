Wonderful recipe! I made a Christmas version onmitting red food coloring but adding red and green colored sugar to top of it.  So pretty and so good! Thank you Melissa!

These were nasty looking and I mean that in a good way! Vampire breath mints indeed. My red food coloring bottle was down to the end and when I squeezed I got a "blood" spray instead of a drop. It was perfect and I went with it. I'll try the gel next time so that I can mold them and make them smaller. What a fun recipe!

YUM!  I had a little white chocolate left over from coating pretzels so I thought I would give this a try.  As candy canes are not available yet, I used starlight mints.  I put them in a zip lock bag and pounded them.   I did use plain food coloring and they were not moldable.  Next time I will try gel coloring and make them a little smaller.  They were excellent!  Thank you mis7up for sharing!
