I made this recipe a couple weeks back when I saw it on Pinterest. It really does taste like a pineapple upside down cake! This also works with Whipped Vodka as well. NOTE: If you haven't had a chance to try cake vodka yet, DO. I was skeptical until I tried it. Now I'm hooked.

EXECELENT drink for the summer.
@ Anne, if you can't find the cake vodka (I've never seen it before either),  use a 1 oz. shot of each Buttershot Schnapps, Peach Schnapps, Almeretto, and 3 ozs. pineapple juice. Use a drop or 2 of the cherry juice for the grenadine.  This is the way I make it and it taste just like a liquid PUSDC

Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, it did!  I used Three Olives cake flavored vodka and it's so sweet you can drink it straight! If you can't find it, the older version of this recipe calls for "vanilla" flavored vodka.  It's also very good.

This drink was a big hit at our party.  I made it by the pitcher and pre-chilled so I didn't have to use ice.  It really tastes like the name.  More people drank this than any other dink.  This is my new favorite.  Most liquor stores carry cake vodka now...call ahead.

Wonderful light cocktail.  The only adjustment my husband made was to substitute the grenadine with maraschino cherry juice.  Big thumbs up from our friends at the last cocktail party!!

I'm drinking one one of these now, they are very tasty.  I'm planning to serve this at our Memorial Day party tomorrow, I decided I needed to try it first.  It's nice and tropical, the cake flavored vodka actually does have a "cake" flavor.  I don't often use flavored vodka, but when I do, I use Pinnacle brand vodkas.

At first I said I wasn't too crazy about this but the more I drink it the more I like it.  ;o)  Made it as a martini with vodka whipped cream (almost more potent than the vodka itself!)  Still going to try some chocolate cake recipes with it...

Easy enough to make by the pitcher. Taste just like the real thing. Though my husband wouldnt know since he claims never to have had it in cake form. Made ahead of time and kept chilled in the fridge. Done more drinking this week along with this stuff then all of last year...

Amazing! It truly tastes like pineapple upside down cake!  Very very very good!  First attemp my "splash" of grenadine was too much - turned it red and a little too sweet, second try- perfect!

I absolutely love this drink. In the past I had used vanilla vodka, which worked fine, but the cake flavor really does make it better. It's a really great, easy-to-drink cocktail :-)

Cake flavored vodka is what makes this drink!! This recipe is 100% my favorite drink, ever. I swear you can *taste* the crust of the cake when you drink this. Pure heaven.

I don't drink, but I was supposed to have a date at my house today. I was gonna cook for her and make this. Her favorite desert is pineapple upside down cake and I stumbled upon this when searching for a unique recipe. She said she wouldn't turn it down so I was gonna make it. Sadly, she forgot about the date so I made it for myself just to taste it and it's pretty tasty!

It was a touch too sweet for me.  I used La Croix pina fraise  in place of the pineapple juice and it gave it pineapple flavor without being overly sweet. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this recipe and loved it!!  I made my own cake vodka using karkov and white cake in a mason jar after letting it sit for two days... and straining it, the cake was still edible just tasty and potent.

Made it as directed. Also made it with a splash (0.5oz?) of Amaretto. My wife preferred the original, while I preferred the Amaretto version. Either way, these are tasty!

I always use whipped or vanilla vodka but I'm sure the cake vodka is good too. The big thing you are missing is a splash of amaretto. But maybe you don't need it with the cake vodka?

Made this recipe for a gathering with friends and we all really enjoyed it.  When just the right amount of grenadine is added, it really does taste exactly like pineapple upside down cake!  We used Pinnacle's cake vodka to create the recipe.

This is by far my favorite drink.  If they don't have cake vodka - the cotton candy vodka is also good in this drink.

Amazingly good. I used maraschino cherry juice instead of grenadine and added a maraschino cherry.

My Father in Law loved it. I dribbled a drop of the cherry juice into the bottom after pouring the drink, it didn't "mix" as much which added to the look/presentation of the drink.
