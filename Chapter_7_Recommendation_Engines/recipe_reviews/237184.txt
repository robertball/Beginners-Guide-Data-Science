I gave this one a try on a whim and really enjoyed it and would make it again with some variations (vegetables, please) but the only read this didn't get a full 5 stars is that I would have liked a disconnect between the flavors of the Mac and cheese and the pizza. The pizza kind of overtook the show and made, in my opinion the Mac and cheese pointless and probably could have just used plain elbow macaroni for less calories.

I made changes, but only because I didn't have all the ingredients. 

First, I used whole wheat elbow macaroni because I like it better. But I did remove a packet of cheese powder from kraft mac to use. 

I also made these changes:

1) I halved the recipe
2) I used olive oil instead of butter (didn't have it)
3) I used sour cream instead of milk (didn't have it)
4) I used part salsa and part Rotel tomatoes and chiles instead of pasta sauce (didn't have any)
5) I used Mexican blend and Swiss cheese because once again, that's all I had. 

You could almost say I changed the whole thing, but I wanted to post because this is a wonderful base recipe and it turned out great!  thanks Chad!

This was a simple, quick recipe that my family just loved. I wanted Mac and cheese, my daughter wanted pizza. We compromised and we were both happy. We will definitely make this again.

We really liked this! It's a good base recipe that is easy to adjust to your personal tastes and preferences. The only changes I made are to use 1 instead of 2 eggs (my hubby dislikes eggs, and I didn't want him to see / taste them in the filling), stirred in 1/4 cup grated parm with the mac n cheese mixture, and sprinkled on Italian seasoning and garlic powder instead of just oregano to the top. I think adding in some seasoned ground beef cooked with diced onions / peppers would be a great twist and will try it again with that variation. Thanks for sharing! :)

I made this dish with instead of a box of mac & cheese, I used the recipe called chef Johns macaroni and cheese. If you didn't know, is also a recipe on allrecipes.com    . And it was GREAT!!!

This was really good though I personally could have had more pizza sauce. It looks pretty and is really tasty and passed my picky eater inspector. It is very cheesy.

This was good - quick and east to prepare! My son and I both were a little "confused" at first (those Kraft mac and cheese days from long ago made us sure we were eating that! But then the other yummy flavors kicked in...)
All in all, a solid recipe for a quick week night dinner.

The cheeses didn't seem to be right for each other.

I'm surprised this was better than what I expected. I slightly modified the preparation of the macaroni and cheese. I whisked the egg into the milk first, and lowered the heat to prevent any possibility of scrambled/curdled eggs. I also pre-cooked the pepperoni to prevent excessive grease.

I did use spicy Italian sausage in place of the pepperoni and stirred some mushrooms and parmesan to boot. This was quite tasty and easy to put together. Gives the taste of  pizza without having to make a crust. Loved it!

I made this for my family and they loved it.  I did make a few modifications:

1) I used about 1/4 cup of extra milk than the recipe calls for.
2) I used the mini pepperoni and mixed most of them in the Mac then put the rest on top the way the recipe says.
3) Before putting the sauce, cheese, and oregano on top, I threw the whole thing in my electric smoker for about 90 minutes at 220Â° using apple wood chips.  This is the reason for the extra milk, to keep it from drying out.
4) In addition to oregano, I also added some dry basil.
