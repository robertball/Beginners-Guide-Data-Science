This was okay. I was hoping for a little more flavor out of it. I would add more seasoning next time. The meatloaf was very moist.

I am somewhat meatloaf-challenged (can't keep it together!), so I was rather pleased with my results following this recipe!
It was easy to pull together using ingredients I had on hand, and we thought it tasted great!
