If I hadnt doctored the recipe it would have been very bland... here is what i added:
Seasonings: 2 bay leaves, marjoram, thyme, garlic salt, black pepper, sea salt
I used a little red cooking wine with (extra)broth and veggie juice
I added garlic (3cloves), 2 onions, and 1lb mushrooms to the potatoes and carrots.
cooked 2hrs on 250 and an additional hour also on 250 after i added veggies...
It turned out fantastic!

I have been cooking since I was a little girl. Started off by just watching my mother, then little by little, I was cutting and dicing while in there with her. The first Pot Roast I ever made was the same recipe that my mother taught me while watching her. This recipe is almost exactly the same as hers. I have learned that even though a recipe can be exactly the same, there are always different ideas that another person has for their recipe. I never had used the V8 juice before, thought I would try it this time. WOW. Great taste to an already fantastic recipe. I also add a couple of Bay Leaves to it. My recipe had always used 1 cup of dry Red Wine instead of the V8. It does make the taste just different enough that my husband actually tasted the difference. He loves them both. Now that's a miracle. Lol. THANK YOU CAMBELL'S!

Delicious and easy. I added little white onions to cook with the vegetables.

I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I had a 3.25 pound roast and followed the recipe as written, however, my meat was overcooked, my veggies were undercooked, and my sauce never thickened - even after adding more flour.

My first attempt ever at a pot roast. It turned out wonderful. The meat was moist and cooked perfectly. Made me think of my dad's roast! Will use it again.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it turned out pretty good. I am only giving it three stars for a number of reasons. In response to one of the previous reviews, I checked the meat at about 100 minutes and it was done. I wish I had checked it ten minutes earlier. I think it must have something to do with the cut, as this bottom round roast was leaner than others I have prepared. I consider myself a beginner, and can't really speak as to why one piece of meat cooks differently from another, but it seems to need to be paid attention to. With regards to the veggies, I added them at 75 minutes, and at the lowest simmer setting they needed their 40ish minutes, nestled around the roast as they were. Also, I added seasonings to the cooking liquid... garlic, bay leaves, celery salt, dried smashed mushrooms, etc., and I think without the additional flavors, this meal might have been bland for our taste. Overall, this is a great start to a yummy pot roast, but not reliable as is.

Loved the cooking method; the house filled with wonderful aromas. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I thought it needed additional seasoning (onion, garlic powder, bay leaf; I also went ahead and added a little red wine along with the V8). Also, the meat wasn't as moist as I would have liked, so I just sliced it thickly and let it sit in the gravy for a few minutes before serving. I was busy and overcooked the veggies a bit, but the family loved it anyway. Thanks.

I didn't have vegetable juice so I added more stock and some tomato paste. So yummy!
