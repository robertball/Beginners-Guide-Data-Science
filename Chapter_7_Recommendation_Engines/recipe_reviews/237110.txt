We both really enjoyed this, though I did cut the ginger in 1/2 to 1 TBSP (and feel the full amount may have been a but overpowering).  My only real "issue" with the recipe is I feel like it's a bit too much marinade/waste of ingredients as written.  My 1+ lb ham steak was positively swimming in the marinade and I didn't detect much/any flavor from the bells/onion.  I didn't have mango juice and my pineapple juice can was 6 oz, so I used that full can.  THANKS for the recipe!

I used this marinade today on pork chops, I did not have mango juice and they still turned out great.
