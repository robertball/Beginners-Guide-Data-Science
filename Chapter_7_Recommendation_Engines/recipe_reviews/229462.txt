I too "doctored it up" a little (see pic), but the recipe gave me a great starting ground, since I didn't really know how to cook eggplant at all! Make sure you add salt/pepper after you oil them, plus I added tomatoes and garlic to roast at the same time, to put on top. Along with the fresh basil, I added some balsamic, and those two additions really made it great!

I followed this recipe exactly and it really needs something else.  It was just ok.  I would not waste the time and effort to make this again.

I made this tonight, I was very excited about it as I try to make one vegetable main dish three days a week for dinner. After reading the reviews I peeled the eggplant and salted and added olive oil and balsamic vinegar to both sides. For the topping I added Parmesan and mozzarella along with Mediterranean herbed feta cheese, bread crumbs, cherry tomatoes, garlic powder, salt and pepper, and olive oil over the tops. Put in oven for 15 minutes at 350. Topped with basil. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

I liked this meal, but like the previous reviewer mentioned, my toddler did not. It was quick and easy though, and a simple way to use up the eggplants I keep getting in the CSA box.

I really enjoyed this...WITH the addition of balsamic vinegar and tomatoes. Before cooking, I soaked the eggplant slices in a mixture of the vinegar and oil. Broiled for five minutes, then added the cheese and tomatoes and baked all together till the eggplant was soft, which took a little longer than 10 minutes for me. When I brought them out of the oven I drizzled with more vinegar and sprinkled the basil on. The skin of the eggplant was a little tough, but I enjoyed the rest. They were pretty and very colorful on the plate. I think I would prefer this with goat cheese crumbles, and may try that in the future. Thanks for a new idea!

This was great except the feta didn't melt and I had to put it under the broiler again. That turned to be perfect. Also,  I should have added garlic to the feta. We didn't have tomatoes but it didn't take away from the meal.

Very good with a few extra steps. After I cut the eggplant I salted both sides and left for a half hour, then soaked off the liquid with a cloth. I did broil one side first as in recipe then turned over and brushed with an oil balsamic mix and sprinkled chopped garlic before topping with feta and old white cheddar and one cherry tomato on each. Baked for 20  mins at 350. Right out of the oven I added the fresh basil and cracked pepper. Extra salt not needed after first salting to draw moisture. They were beautiful and delicious appetizers.

Made this last night and it was DELICIOUS!!  The only things I did differently were I put olive oil on both sides and left them under the broiler a little longer, on both sides.  I also added garlic powder and Asiago cheese.  Fabulous!!

I thought this was great. Read the other reviews and added the tomatoes as suggested, I didn't have basil :/ but used garlic and salt & pepper.
I had to cook mine quite a bit longer before the feta got bubbly, but everyone loved it!

I agree with other reviewers...something was missing.
