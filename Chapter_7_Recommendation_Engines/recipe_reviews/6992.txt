These are very comparable to the biscuits served at Red Lobster!  I however, did have to reduce the heat to 375 degrees when baking.  A wonderful aroma and tasty blend of flavors!

I made this recipe with Christmas dinner(we traditionally have seafood instead of turkey) and the biscuits were delicious!!! My dinner guests thought they were excellent too. The only thing I did differently(per other reviews) was to add the garlic powder(not salt) and dried parsley to the mix itself. I brushed the bisquits with plain melted butter as soon as they came out of the oven, then quickly placed in the roll basket covered with a cloth. Also, I just cooked these until done and had NO problems with the bottoms burning. They do indeed reheat just fine as long as you gently reheat them in a microwave on low and just until they are warm. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

Nice and quick recipe.  I like to serve these as appetizers for dinner.  I use less butter to cut back on calories.  A nice addition is some fresh chopped chives too to the batter.  It adds nice flavor and color.

I have tried several recipes in an attempt to mimic Red Lobster's biscuits, and I am convinced this one is near perfect.  Absolutely delicious (not to mention simple)!  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Although I'll still be looking for the perfect replica of Red Lobster's cheese biscuits, these were pretty good.  I too added some chives to the batter and we all thaought they were good enough to make again. Thanks Debbie and your friend for sharing this.

I’ve never eaten at Red Lobster so I don’t know if these are “authentic” or what they’re *supposed* to taste like. What I do know is that with just a quick stir of a few ingredients I had a light, fluffy, tender and flavorful biscuit.  I used an ice cream scoop to help shape them and make them uniform size.  My only criticism is that I found the dough did not come together with the amount of milk called for.  Hindsight tells me to use less.  I added more baking mix until it was the proper consistency, but it would have been better to have added less milk in the first place.  But they turned out well in the end and I’ll turn to this recipe again – there are so many possibilities for variation!

These are pretty good.  I make them for a change now and then.  The kids love them.  I usually add some extra cheese and try to use fresh parmesan rather than the canned stuff.  Sometimes I skip the garlic because dh doesn't care for it.

These were very good and even impressed my husband, who is very picky about the bread he eats.  I found that I only needed to bake them for about 8-9 minutes for them to be soft, which is how we like them.  I also omitted the parmesan completely and doubled the amount of cheddar.  They don't reheat well, so only bake as many as you will need for your meal.  I don't think they tasted like Red Lobster's, but they were very good.  I'll be serving them again!

These are wonderful!  I may have done myself an injustice by making them, because that was the only thing that would drag my seafood hating husband to my favorite seafood place.  Now that I can make them myself, I'll have a harder time getting him to go.  I doubled the cheddar cheese, added a little more of the parmesian, just a little more butter.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

This recipe just goes to show how "easy" cooking doesn't always cut it. These "biscuits" taste like cheesy (and I don't mean the dairy product), second-rate, commercial garlic bread. I'm sorry that I wasted any effort, money and especially my time by following this recipe. I recommend that you learn from my mistake. One thing is certain: If I ever find myself at a "popular seafood chain", you can be SURE that I won't be sampling their biscuits! EVER!

I first made this recipe over a year ago and my husband and I absolutely love it. We went to Red Lobster recently and actually decided that we liked this home-made version a whole lot better!!  Quick, easy, and very tasty.  The best!

I worked at Red Lobster for years. Their cheddar bay biscuits are simply bisquick with cheddar cheese added to the batter. Then brushed with the melted butter, garlic and parsley mixture when removed from the over. That's it! These are great with the addition of parmesan cheese as well!

These are very good and easy. I don't know if I agree that they compare completely to Red Lobster's biscuits, but they are still very tasty. My 10 year old son loved them.

This was pretty easy, but they didn't taste like Red Lobster's.  By doubling the cheddar, and halving the garlic, I got results more like the restaurant's.  Good biscuits!

These are the best biscuits I have ever had. These are even better that RL's! I made them this week with homemade clam chowder, and today we are having them with lasagna! My husband took them to work for lunch, and everyone wanted the recipe! Thanks a bunch!

I don't keep Bisquick on hand--what I did was used two cups AP flour, two teaspoons baking powder, half teaspoon baking soda and a quarter teaspoon salt. I wanted more of a wetter-drop biscuit so I increased the milk to a full cup and added half of a teaspoon of garlic powder to the biscuit batter. Very simple biscuit recipe that was inexpensive to make that the family enjoyed. NOTE: This made eight biscuits for me using a heaping 1/4 cup measuring cup.

This is a very good thing to wake up in the morning to !! I can't believe somethng so simple can taste so good. Instead of putting the parsely on top I put it in the biscuit itself! Very great!

This recipe is great but its basically the same as the one given on the Betty Crocker web site - http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/recipe.aspx?recipeId=36083. The only difference is the parsley which I leave out anyway.

Wow Debbie!!!! I can't begin to tell you how much we loved these! I used the cheddar but replaced the parm with asiago and used a good three quarters of a cup of each. I added of bit of onion and garlic powders to the dough and because I had just run out of milk, I used buttermilk. I made the biscuits larger and topped each with a little more cheese. The parsley garlic butter was sensational and my youngest daughter said that they were the BEST biscuits I've ever made. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These were ok.  I'm glad I only made half of the batch because only two people ate it, including myself.  The rest, we had to throw out.  Definitely not to die for.

Pretty good. I think I might use buttermilk to give it an extra tang next time. Not bad thanks for sharing this quick and easy recipe.

This was a good recipe, very quick and easy.  I followed the recipe exact except I only made a half batch.  I would definitly bake these on parchment paper as other reviewers had mentioned because I followed the recipe and used an ungreased cookie sheet and by the time the biscuits were nice and golden brown they were stuck to the sheet.  I will be making these again...just on parchment paper in the future.

I LOVE this recipe and have been making it for years! I use the Easy Biscuit Mixture from this site instead of the baking mix! So yummy! My absolute favorite biscuit!

These were pretty good biscuits.  The flavor of the garlic butter mixture didn't really come trough for us though.  Might make again but with more garlic powder.  Or maybe even add a minced clove of garlic to the batter.  I guess we were expecting a stronger flavor.  Thanks.  All in all they were pretty good.

I accidentally threw all the ingredients into the mixture instead of reserving the brush on ingred's...Still delicious. UPDATE: 6/17/07 I made it right this time and now they're amazing. I would proudly serve these to friends and family.

I did like others before me and added a little more cheese...I also added dried chives instead of parsley to the butter for the finishing touch. With 8 kids it is impossible to find something that they ALL like but this recipe did just that! Make sure that you do not over cook them.  One batch turned out to be very solid hockey pucks because we were  busy eating the first batch and let them cook a little to long...

This was a very good, easy to make recipe. Instead of parsley, I used dry chives instead, it gave it a bit more authentic flavor. Next time, I will use more cheddar, I love cheese! I would definitely be making this recipe again with my own tweaking until I get it until perfection.

My dinner guests last evening were absolutely "wowed" with the cheese biscuits along with the All Recipes artichoke chicken entree and salad of mixed baby greens/spinach/fresh strawberries/thinly sliced white onion/toasted almonds/crumbled blue cheese, tossed with a garlic/olive oil dressng.
 
Reference the biscuits, first, I used low fat Bisquick baking mix, sharp cheddar, and fresh parmesan. And, instead of 2/3 cup milk, I substituted 2/3 cup club soda + a few extra tablespoonsful. Added some onion powder and garlic powder to the melted butter/parsley topping. And, reference other reviewer comments, next time I make the biscuits, I'll add chives to the batter for additional taste and color. Also, next time I'll use only 1/2 tsp. of dried parsley because 1 tsp. seemed a bit much on top of the biscuits.

Very good but it could of used more parmasan than cheddar. I made them over 4 times the last time I used more parmesan it was perfect.

This was really good and really easy, makes a nice addition to just about any meal.  I found it easier to mix the garlic and parsley right in to the dough, and skip putting the melted butter in them.  I also added a sprinkle of paprika to give them a nice color.

We just had these for dinner and they were FABULOUS.  I decided to make them because I had some aging off brand baking mix I wanted to us up since I didn't really like it.  Also, I had some half and half going sour which I used instead of the milk.  No parm on hand so I just used a grated Mexican cheese blend.  I think these must be fool-proof.

The basic recipe is good and is quick to assemble at the last minute.    After I added a few extra touches, it  bumped it up to a 5 star recipe.  I added the garlic powder and a couple Tablespoons of  "Tastefully Simple" brand Spinach & Herb seasoning mix directly to the dough.  I didn't have any fresh parmesean so, I just added extra cheddar.  I ran out of milk so I substituted Half & Half.  I didn't brush the top with butter... probably should have to give the biscuits a glossier look but, the ommission didn't impact the flavor.  We just spilt open the steaming biscuits and spread with a sweet Irish Butter (for St. Patrick's Day).  Yummy!!

Loved this recipe! :) However, I didn't have Bisquick at home. Substituted 2 cups of Hecker's Self Rising Flour + 1/4 cup of shortening for the 2 cups of baking mix. Worked just fine! Just like Red Lobster!

Delicious!  I used sharp cheddar and fresh grated romano cheese instead of the parmesan, 1/2 cup, I assumed the recipe meant 1/4 cup of a canister of parmesan.

YUM! Made these for a family get-together and everyone...even the kids...loved them! I made it according to the recipe except baked them at 375 rather than 400. My only regret is that I didn't make a double batch. Super-easy and we will definitely have them again!!

Wow, this was sooo easy! I used self rising flour and whatever cheese I had in the fridge, which was a slice of cheddar, a Mexican mix, and a Quattro Formaggio mix. I did need more milk than what was called for and I baked at 375 after reading a review. I used half the butter and skipped the garlic powder- seriously delicious! I served it with Potato Leek Soup 1. Thanks for such a simple recipe!

This is a standard with fried ham or Autumn Spiced Ham Steaks and applesauce.  There are never any leftovers.  I use my small cookie scoop to make bite-sized biscuits, and make them on my pizza stone. It's an incredibly easy quick bread for dinner, and the results are just as good cold for breakfast (if they last that long) as they were hot for dinner.

These were awesome! I added half the butter into the dough, and saved the second half for "basting." I also added a few shakes of garlic powder and parsley, as others had suggested. They were fantastic, wouldn't change a thing!!

I thought these were very tasty.  As others had suggested I mixed my garlic powder into the dry mix.  I used a multi-grain baking mix that I get at Trader Joes.  I used half water and half soymilk.  I used mostly Monterey Jack cheese with a little bit of freshly grated Asiago as my cheeses of choice.  I used a 2-1/4 inch ice cream scoop that I had sprayed lightly with vegetable spray to scoop out my biscuits so they would be relatively the same size and yielded 8 generous biscuits.  I baked my biscuits for about 15 minutes at 425.  And  baked the biscuits on parchment paper and had no trouble with sticking.  My biscuits were very tender and moist.  What a great and easy recipe.  A perfect accompaniment with tomato soup.

MMM! So yummy. My family including my 9 year old picky eater gobbled them up.My husband said they taste better than the seafood resturants because they are softer.

Who needs to go to a certain "red seafood" restaurant anymore!?! I used a mexican cheese blend since that's all I had on hand, and less butter on top to make it healthier.  I needed to add a little more milk than the recipe called for to get a soft dough consistency, and I used the biscuit mix recipe from this site since I didn't have any at home.  I used my one oz scoop and baked at 375 for about 13 minutes (I just looked for light and golden), and I wound up with about 20 biscuits.  YUMMY!  I can't stop eating them.

these are super easy to make- I love that you just drop a spoonful onto the baking sheet. I served them with a dinner pasta salad and my hubby thought they were pretty good.  The taste is nothing extraordinary- but because of the ease of making these biscuits- i'll be hanging on to this recipe for many future uses.

These biscuits are light and tasty, and are versatile enough to go well with many sauces. The butter was a lovely touch too, though perhaps a little too parsley-heavy.

The biscuits didn't turn out to well when I tried this recipe. There were very dense and hardly brown. But I DO NOT BLAME THE RECIPE for this at all. I'm a novice cook and am still learning. Will definitely try again.

I omitted the Parmesan, and added a little bit more milk so it would be slightly less stiff, and therefore easier to get in the muffin tin. I added some garlic salt, parsley and italian seasoning right into the batter. And I added italian seasoning to the melted butter in addition to the parsley and garlic powder. Wonderful.

I have looked and looked and cooked and cooked, trying to find these. I love the ones served at Red Lobster, and have been told over and over that this was the recipe and to cook the recipe and it not be them. I thought well why not try this one and it was IT. I could not believe  it. These taste just like the RED LOBSTER cheese biscuits. WONDERFUL, DELICIOUS, EXCELLENT. Can you tell how much I liked these???LOL oh, and even my kids liked them and they like nothing. :-) I cooked them today and they were gone in like 10 seconds, no kidding! TRY THEM, TONIGHT! This recipe was really appreciated and thanks for taking the time to post it. :-)

This is a wonderful recipe.  I read the other reviews and used 1/4 tsp garlic salt and 1/4 tsp of garlic powder for the topping -- they turned out great.  Very easy to make and they look wonderful as well. I will definately make these again!

in order for recipe to taste truly authentic, you need to use garlic salt in place of the garlic powder. Other than that they taste just like the real thing!

I used all the ingredients and proportions specified. However, I went ahead and put the butter, garlic, and parsley in the mixture from the beginning. Also, I put everything in my bread machine and set it on the dough setting. They turned out perfect! Love this recipe and have made it now at least a dozen times.

I made a batch of these tonight for my mom, who loves Red Lobster cheese biscuits. They were just what we hoped for. I baked them at 425 (rather than 450) for a total of about 15 minutes Another minute or few wouldn't have hurt. I grated a small garlic clove into the butter rather than using garlic powder. Next time around (and there will be a next time), I might follow the brushed butter with a sprinkling of fine sea salt. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!   (p.s. I am editing this to add that these freeze and reheat beautifully! We thawed them, then briefly reheated in the toaster oven to warm the inside and slightly crisp the outside. The flavors must have melded a bit in storage, as they were even better reheated than fresh out of the oven!)

these biscuits are the best ---make a double batch and be sure not to need them but just pat them out and cut the with a round cutter and bake --I like the 400+ temp

tasty and easy!  we don't eat seafood so not exactly sure what they are 'supposed' to taste like, but they are good and go with anything.  My husband stopped by one day on his lunch break and took 6 back with him  and he's not a parmesan cheese fan!

Delicious!  I ended up making 16 smaller ones, and there were still only two left after my husband, 2 year old, 9 month old and I ate them!  We actually had to force ourselves to save a couple for leftovers the next day.  Thanks so much!

Perfect, just like Red Lobster's!! I did cheat and add some extra baking powder to the mix, along with extra cheese of both varieties, AND loaded on the butter mix topping. (Mine were not for those watching the waistline, ha ha.)

Really good!  I even screwed up (because I was talking to my brother!)and added the butter, garlic and parsley to the mix and then baked it.  They ended up flatter than normal but still tasted good!

My husband loved these, but I was a bit disappointed.  I didn't think they were cheesy enough -- if I make them again, I'll add more cheddar.  I used the low-fat baking mix, so this might have been some of the problem...?

This had a very good taste. I think next time I will make them a little flatter on the cookie sheet though. I used bread mix and yeast and was still very good but took away a little on the flavor. But the topping especially was delicious.

Great recipe. I'm not big on cheeses but even I enjoyed these.  My guests love them.  I was out of parsley so I just sprinkled chopped green onions over top of the biscuits.  Also, I used margarine instead of butter and they turned out great.

I totally agree with another review about these biscuits tasting like Red Lobster's. These are kind of fattening, but taste very good.

We loved these.  I now make them atleast once a week.  Very homey and comforting, especially with a pot of soup or stew.

I tried these again using 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup melted butter, added the garlic to the biscuit mix, 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt, 1/8 teaspoon onion powder, 1 cup of extra sharp cheddar and 1/4 cup Parmesan/Romano and they tasted much better.
