Wonderful tasting easy recipe! I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powdered. I also used boneless chicken breasts and only one can of coconut milk because that's all I had. And it was still delicious! Even my kids loved it... and ate the spinach. shock I'd like to try this recipe exactly the way it's written sometime. I'm sure it would be even better. I served this over jasmine rice with a side of stir-fried veggies (eggplant zucchini red and yellow peppers). Delicious healthy quick dinner.

Delicious -- please note I did not follow the recipe as written however like other reviewers have mentioned the flavor combination was a great starting point. How I cooked this: Heated 1 Tbsp butter in a pot that I could cover later browned 2 chicken breasts on both sides in the butter. After browning I cut the chicken into smaller pieces to cook faster. I added 1 can of coconut milk into the pot and also added ground ginger garlic powder and onion powder salt and pepper. Cooked with lid slightly propped open for about 20 minutes. Threw in some pre-washed spinach leaves and it was good to go.

This is my recipe submission, and of course, I love this dish having grown up eating this at my mother's table.  It is definitely rich and not for the calorie counters!  I can see why some call it a greasy dish as it uses skin-on chicken in addition to rich, creamy coconut milk.  If you prefer a lighter version (as my husband does) just use boneless skinless chicken breasts.  You won't get the same depth of flavor without the chicken fat, but it will still be very tasty and a bit lighter in the belly.  Also, some tasty additions I've found for this recipe are a bit of chopped garlic and thinly sliced yellow squash.

The flavors were good and the recipe was simple enough but this meal was VERY greasy. I followed the recipe exactly and served it over rice as suggested and I feel very bloated. Not sure if it is the chicken or the coconut that makes it so fatty.

I made this exactly as directed and served with jasmine rice. Followed another's recommendation and added sliced green onion which was a great touch. I really liked this recipe and plan to make it again. Thanks!

Put this together in my dutch oven. I'm not a fan of dark meat and my family is only 3 people large so I made this with a pound of breast and only 1 can of coconut milk. Used the whole package of spinach and all suggested ginger for extra flavor. It was still too bland for me so I shook in a healthy amount of garlic powder and ground ginger at the end (and of course more salt). Served with brown rice and the family really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again - thank you for sharing your family recipe!! Even though I tweaked it to my tastes I still really appreciate the starting point.

I am always looking for way to use foods like spinach and kale. This was good you can use two great healthy foods chicken breast and spinach but the curry adds a lot of flavor.

ok - i used chicken breasts and ground ginger too bc that is what I had- and added patis onion and fresh garlic.. what Filipino dish is complete with out Patis? I think it needs more flavor- I am going to add some other things- and that will turn it into a whole new recipe.

Cooked this for the first time last night and it was delicious! I followed another's recommendation and used powdered spices for the garlic and ginger as I get home late from work and don't have alot of time to prep fresh ginger and garlic. Recipe came out fine. One modification I made was to season the chicken while browning with salt pepper garlic and ginger. Then after I added the coconut milk (used 1 can for 2 lbs of chicken) I used more seasonings of salt pepper garlic and ginger to taste. Also threw in some sliced scallions together with coconut milk. After simmering chicken in coconut broth until tender I then threw in pre-washed fresh spinach (much better than frozen spinach). Loved it! Will definitely be making this recipe again:)

Very good basic dish... I too thought it was a bit heavy the way it's written but I re-made it based on some of the other reviews and it was GREAT! Cubed some chicken breast browned it in butter. Then simmered together the coconut milk chicken and spices (I used ginger fresh crushed garlic crushed and powdered ginger salt pepper... next time I will try adding rosemary or a bay leaf!) for about 20 minutes. Then added fresh spinich simmered for 2 minutes and served over rice.

The good: chicken cooked in coconut milk is incredibly soft and moist. I used boneless breasts. The not-so-good: I thought this was rather bland. In addition to following the recipe I used green onion parsley ground ginger garlic curry powder & cayenne. As I was tasting it it just needed more & more flavor. I kept adding spices & salt. My family liked it but I do not think I will make this again.

I added sayote instead of spinach because my family's recipe uses some kind of local papaya. It was my Mom's favorite recipe growing up in the Philippines so I was really thrilled to find this recipe! I also added fresh garlic and onion to the ginger turned out great!

My partner and I made this twice. The first time was for a friend who is Phillipina. Her whole family loved this! We did made a couple of changes PLUS made this even faster for when you're in a pinch: 1)replace the oil with Coconut oil. Makes sense since you're already using coconut milk and coconut oil has many health properties. 2)3 tbsp of oil is a bit much. Reduce to 2 or even less and its fine. 3) De-bone an already COOKED rotisserie chicken from the grocery store!!! You can then omit the places in this recipe that call for time to cook the chicken!!! Simple do the other steps and add chicken towards the end to let it simmer and soak up the coconut and ginger! YUMMY!!!

Simple. Easy. Good. Will make it again. We love ginger in our house. Threw in some squash we had in the fridge. Would also be good with eggplant.

Tasteful! I sautéd garlic ginger initially. Removed it from the pan. Cooked the chicken (cut and rubbed with all the spices below). Added potatoes red bell peppers baby corn/chestnuts. Sprinkled onion powder garlic salt ginger powder salt & pepper. Sautéd it a bit more before I added the 2 cans of coconut milk. I simmered on the stove for 20 mins before I added the spinach. And I sprinkled the above spices again and let it cook for another 5mins. Family liked it.

Yumm-o! I'm new to using coconut milk in recipes what a great introduction. Added more seasoning with an all spice blend we use at home and what a great meal was created. Ran out of spinach used a mix veggie w/ corn carrot and green beans. Complimented well. Next time will try a vegetarian twist. Thanks for sharing.

Great flavor. Don't skip the second can of coconut milk! I made the mistake of following others by only using one can. I ended up having to make a second batch of sauce to serve leftovers. You can add as much ginger as you like (fresh or powdered) I will make this again with TWO cans of coconut milk and some patis (fish sauce)- for authentic Filipino ginataang taste.

It's such a good recipe that I've made it 3 times in one week. I used skinless thighs, and fresh ginger (a lot!) and garlic. I didn't have spinach so I sauteed fresh mushrooms and added a nice handful of  spring onions. The taste is amazing. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipes packs a big ginger kick! For my family's palate we needed onion to help bring out the sweetness here--as written the recipe doesn't call for any onions. We didn't use chicken and instead used chickpeas. I also agree with the author daplo that cooks should liberally salt this dish! It needs the flavor punch.

I'm a young Filipino and have been trying to learn how to cook more Filipino food. I was happy to see that there were some recipes on this site. This was really easy to follow. My family and I thought it was pretty good. Although I personally prefer stronger bolder flavors and I liked this much more the second day after I tweaked it with additional seasonings that were more to my liking. I would also use fresh spinach next time instead of frozen. All in all a good recipe to start from. Thanks!

Very nice. I added fresh garlic shallot and fresh green chilli. Even my fussy 10yr old ate it.
