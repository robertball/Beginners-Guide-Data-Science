Good recipe. The only thing I changed was to put the dough balls after frying right into the sauce pan of honey mixture. Also added nonpareils to honey mixture...easier than sprinkling onto the pile of struffoli later.

I had to add more flour than the recipe called for. About 1/2 cup total. They came out excellent.

You don't add hazelnuts to your struffoli? Try it sometime, it adds a great crunch and it's fun trying to figure out which are the dough balls and the nut's! Also spray a glass with nonstick cooking spray and build your struffoli around the glass then pull the glass out and you have a wreath! Add your sprinkles and enjoy! I can't wait to make this.... mmm!! P. S. Also add the juice of half a lemon to the honey and sugar mixture

My mom fried them in Crisco. They are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The best Struffoli I ever had.. Definitely need 1 and a half to 2 cups of flour.

Started making this.  Read the reviews, thought I'd give it a try here is what's wrong... I tried adding more flour and I've gotten to the point where I have added already 4 cups of flour and my mixture is still way too sticky to even try and make dough balls, so either I don't have good ingredients or something is seriously wrong with this recipe.  I gotta find a better recipe at this point.
