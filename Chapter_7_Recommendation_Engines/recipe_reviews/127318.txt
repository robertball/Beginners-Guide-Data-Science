This had a weird consistency for mashed potatoes and no garlic flavor - and I doubled the amount of garlic that the recipe called for!

I used organic red potatoes and only half the amount of cream cheese called for in this recipe. I also used a reduced fat cream cheese. I did not add the extra salt but I did add fresh ground pepper. I served this with Carnation Swedish Meatballs (which is also from this site) and steamed broccoli. NO leftovers. NOTE: I suggest you saute your garlic in the butter over very low heat for a better flavor for your potatoes.

Dropped the butter, cut the cream cheese in half, added less then 1/4 cup warmed milk and used garlic paste rather then chopping garlic cloves. Much better! Oh and salt and pepper!

Almost a meal by itself! I make these for our church luncheons and they are amazing.

These were so good with just a little variation from regular homemade mashed potatoes.  I used 2 very large potatoes peeled and cubed.  I melted the butter with the garlic in the microwave.  I added 1 single serving weight watchers cream cheese and a little skim milk. These were gone so fast there wasn't time to take a picture.  Will be making these again for sure!

These are alright. I thought the cream cheese:potato ratio made it too dry, however, I may have had too many potatoes, too. It was good, but not good enough to keep around. Thanks anyway.

Delicious potatoes! I couldn't resist I added in just a little milk. I used these in my mashed potato bowls!
