I changed the recipe for the kids and it turned out that everyone really loved it.  I left out the cheese, I added a pinch of kosher salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar and added extra butter about 1/4 cup, I really didn't measure, I baked it in a buttered 9x13 cake pan for 40 to 45 minutes, I needed the oven for the rest of the dinner so I took it out about 2 hours, maybe even longer,  before we ate and just set it on the counter the warm temperature was perfect so I love the fact that I was able to use the oven for other dishes and it also free up my time since I was busy preparing a large meal.  It was a winner and since I try so many new recipes the family asked me to keep this one as a regular, it pleased every palate.

I love this side dish, it's cheap, easy and reheats beautifully.  I don't use canned niblet corn, I just fill the empty creamed corn can with frozen corn and use that instead.  I'd consider the addition of some scallions to the mix to add color.  And I swear by Jiffy corn bread mix for this recipe.  I don't use the egg called for in this recipe.  A suggestion to make life easier: I've found this casserole to be a great make ahead option to be microwaved before serving.

I haven't made this yet, but can't understand how 4 servings come out of an 8 x 12 pan. Can someone help me with this?

This corn cassrole reminded me of scalloped corn my grandmother made when I was younger!  It was wonderful!  I almost couldn't get enough during dinner and my husband ate all of the leftovers the next day!
It was 'jiggly' in the middle when I took it out of the oven, which made me wonder what I did wrong, but after about 10 minutes it sat up and turned out wonderfully!

This is a really good recipe, this is the 2nd time I've made this recipe, I had never had corn casserole until one night I said I was tired of having just "plain old" vegetables, so I searched and found this, quick and easy.  Unfortunately today, I forgot to add the cheese I just reminded myself.  I was wondering if 350 is the right temperature because both times I have made this and it doesn't seem to be done in 30min, maybe it is because I'm not using a square dish?  Also, do I need to drain the niblet corn?  I did just in case.  Well thanks for the awesome recipe.

This is the first dish to disappear at the Thanksgiving and Christmas table.  A family favorite we make every holiday - the kids will eat this up!  I use sharp cheddar, light sour cream, & only 1 stick of butter instead of 2.

YUMMO "ND"!!!! Didn't have any cheese in the house and I only used one stick of butter. Trust me, no need to add the extra calories and fat because this was absolutely fabulous!! Also used lite sour cream. I can't tell you how much my family loved this; even my daughter who doesn't really care for corn bread, muffins, creamed corn etc. She had two helpings and put some hot sauce on top to offset the slight sweetness of the dish. Thank you so much!!!!

I have been making the recipe for a few years now.  My husband's family loves it and always requests that I bring it to family dinners.  Pretty much the only thing I change is that I add a couple of tablespoons of sugar.  I also drain the whole kernel corn.  Very yummy when right out of the oven!

Yummy! Great for family reunions or get togethers. Easy to make and tastes great. Everyone will love this dish. NOTE: you need a 9x13 dish and you'll need to cook for 30-45 minutes. Also, make sure you drain your corn. This should help everyone who is having trouble getting theirs done in the center.  Using 8x12 takes over an hour and the top gets too brown but the inside is still not done.

This was the first time I've had corn casserole and I thought it was very good.  I added a dash of salt and a tablespoon of sugar and mixed a third cup of the cheese into the corn mixture and topped the casserole with the remaining two thirds cup.  I served it with Salsa Chicken (from this website).

I have been making this recipe for over 5yrs--I have doubled the recipe because it is so popular and I wanted to have some left overs. I use fat free or low fat sour cream. I do not use an egg--I just mix everything together and place in greased or pam sprayed large casserole dish--350 for 45 min and then add shredded cheddar cheese sprinkle on the top & cook 15min more--
it should be moist inside--not too dry---this recipe can be part of a Mexican meal--so substitute cheddar cheese with pepper jack shredded cheese--

Made this last night for a Halloween Party. It was a hit. I did some variations, however, which I think improved the flavor factor. I sauteed a large onion and the inner ribs of celery in pam until golden and soft, and fried up a pound of bacon until crispy. I added a tablespoon of the bacon oil to the onion mixture for flavor. Added onion mix to batter and also 5 ounces shredded sharp cheddar. When almost done, sprinkled more cheese and the bacon on top to get crusty/bubbly. It was delicious. Can't tolerate spicy, so using the bacon/onion combo instead of chili's were a nice alternative. I will make this again.

This was a very good dish. I have made it twice now. The first time I sprinkled the cheese on top. IMO it didn't really need it. The second time I stirred the cheese into the mixture. Ipreferred this way best if you are going to use the cheese. My DH really enjoyed this. It will definitely find a place on my table frequently.

I made this for the holidays and everyone loved it! In fact my husband has actually asked me to make it several times since.    What is really great about it is you can be a little lax with the amounts if you need to be and it still comes out great, for instance the corn bread mixes I had in the cupboard where larger than 8.5 oz called for so I just added a little more sour cream.  I would guess you could also just add another egg.     Another tip put some of the cheddar cheese IN the batter. 
IN OTHER WORDS---YOU CAN'T SCREW THIS UP, IT IS JUST A GREAT RECIPE !!!!

Love this dish ... but WITHOUT the cheese ... just isn't necessary, the corn flavor speaks for itself.  I prefer using a 9x13 pan for a crispier edge and Jiffy brand corn muffin mix ... its extra sweet!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!  :O)

This is one of the favorite dishes I make during the holidays. The one thing I omit is the eggs, they arent needed. I also bake for a full 45 mins on 350 and sprinkle the cheese on when it comes out. If left to bake on the casserole it turns out rubbery.

This is one of my family's favorite dishes! Every holiday, they all request this casserole and anytime I take it to a dinner or potluck I am bombarded with requests for the recipe! I follow the recipe exactly, using corn bread mix and low-fat sour cream to make it a little less sinful. It comes out perfect everytime. The ONLY change that I would recommend to this recipe is that you leave it in the oven a little bit longer than 30 minutes before sprinkling on the cheese. It is usually not firm in the middle after only 30 minutes. I leave it in about 40-45 and then pop it back in to melt the cheese. Otherwise, absolutely perfect!

I made this once and I fell in love with it. It is a very good way to make a dish of corn attractive when being served and it is delicious.I used Miracle Maize cornbread mix with this recipe. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand for whenever I wish to have a delightful corn dish in which to serve family and friends.

This has a sweet taste from the corn bread mixture.  It was great and a different twist to regular corn.

This is always the favorite dish at the party.  Recipe is perfect exactly as it is.  I use a little more than the 1/2 cup cheddar and I chose mild cheddar.  My family and friends absolutely love this recipe.

I use to make it without the cheese now tried this recipe with cheese (I mix it in the batter not on top). Love it!!! Got excellent reviews for thanksgiving, requested for Christmas. Only thing is I baked it for about an hour, 45 minutes wasn't enough for me. I used a glass casserole dish and as soon as it started to brown on the sides I called it done.  Awesome!  Thank you for the recipe!!!!

Made this recipe today to go with our Christmas dinner and the family absolutely loved it.  I did not have the corn bread mix so I made my own with 2/3 cup flour, 1/2 cup cornmeal, 3 Tbls. sugar, 1 Tbls. baking powder, 1/4 tsp. salt.  IT TURNED OUT GREAT!!  Thanks!

made it and loved it. I forgot the cheese and think I will leave it out in the future. I baked in a 2 quart baking dish. I will be making for Christmas but doubling the recipe since it went so fast last time. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!!

This is basically the same terrific recipe my mom made, with two differences. 1) Instead of sour cream, my mom's recipe called for an 8 oz container of onion dip. We loved the sour cream & onion flavor it gave the corn. 2) No cheese topping, although I can see how that might be good. With all the onion dip action going on in my version, though, I think I'll skip it. I think this is supposed to have a soft, spoon bread texture, but we preferred a firmer texture, so we always baked it for an hour, or even a bit more. Delicious in any version, but try the onion dip!

Everywhere I take this people want the recipe. I don't use cheese though. Instead I mix corn flakes with a little melted butter and sprinkle on top!

I made a recipe similar to this several years ago for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews... then lost the recipe!  We've spent years searching for the Great Lost Corn Casserole Recipe.  We tested recipe after recipe to no avail... UNTIL THIS RECIPE.  It's perfect!  I did omit the cheese on top--it doesn't really add that much to the recipe.

I make this all of the time because it is so easy, so delicious, and my picky kids love it!  I usually use a bit more sour cream then it calls for (and use low-fat, still tastes fantastic) and mix the cheese in with everything else before cooking.  I also use alot less butter and it is still creamy and delicious.  One time I didn't have corn so just used the cream corn and it still was great!  Definite keeper.

Delicious. I've made this recipe and a couple of variations. I usually add onions and green peppers to the butter and then mix it all in. Always a hit and super easy. +-

This is a must have in my family. It is great for the holidays with turkey, etc. I also love it room temperature in the summer with a grilled ham steak and spinach salad. For the reviewer who had setting issues: as I read the recipe, you bake for 30 mins, top with cheese and bake for an additional 15 minutes. 45 total. It does "set" as it cools a bit as well. Love this, many thanks.

My family has made a recipe similar to this for many years at every holiday.  The only thing that I do differently, which makes a big difference in my opinion, is saute a green pepper and an onion in the 1/2 cup butter and then add that (including the melted butter in the pan) to the corn bread mixture.  It looks pretty if you use red and green pepper at Christmas!

I made this for Christmas dinner this year because I was tired of just serving corn...  Made this and it was a hit, but I doubled the recipe because of the amount of servings that were listed... I should not have done this because we have a TON of leftovers... I really think that this recipe can easily serve 6-8 as written

Easter 2017 update... This is now a staple on my holiday table!  You won't come to our house on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter without this being served. :)

I think it was wonderful. i did change a couple things,because i did read the reviews and it was said to be bread like. i added 1 and 1/ cans of cream corn instead of 1 can and i also added some shredded cheese to the mix before i baked it. it was not really bread like at all. I couldnt get my husband out of it. thanks for the recipe.

i actualy got this recipe off the Paula Dean Cooking show and I leave out the eggs.  it is amazingly good.  I made it for easter dinner last night and then delivered some to my friends who can't leave their houses and they all called back today wanting more!....i'm actually making a double recipe tonight!  you have got to try it.  For all the southerners who don't eat sweet cornbread (jiffy muffin mix) don't knock it till you tried it! yumm!

This is very good. I made this last night. We were having a Mexican dinner. With that in mind, I added a bit of chopped jalapeno and a bit of chopped onion. They loved it. It did take a bit longer than 30 minutes to cook, I think I gave it about 40. But that may just be my oven. We'll be having this again. Thanks for sharing.

OH MY GOSH!  I have been buying this from Market Day to support the school and from here on out I will be buying something else in its place and making this recipe.  It cooked up so beautiful:)  I think the only thing that I am going to do is add a little bit of sugar to make it a little sweeter for our taste, but it is wonderful just the way it is!  I am currently on the South Beach diet and made this for the family tonight and they were ummming so much I couldn't resist not tasting it.  If you like corn casserole, this one will really please you!  Thanks so much for sharing!

we made this recipe as a Thanksgiving side and it was unbelievable! it was so good people came back for seconds and even thirds (I tripled the recipe) and a few people ate some warmed over in the microwave with a dab of fresh whipped cream as a dessert!! it goes with any type of dinner and is well worth the less than 10 minutes it takes to throw it together.

This is a great and simple recipe.  I left out the cheese and doubled the recipe.  Cooked at 375 for 1.5 hours in 9x13 pan.  Came out perfect for Thanksgiving dinner.

This dish is absolutely awesome. My company always wants me to bring for company dinners. Only change is I use Jiffy cornbread mix. it makes it  just sweet enough to give it the extra flavor it needs. Note: drain the whole corn or it will be to juicy

I didn't have sour cream so I used buttermilk. I also made my own cornbread mix; those box mixes tend to have hydrogenated oils in them.  Even with my modifications, it turned out great!

I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. I altered it very slightly by only doing  1/2 C. Sour Cream and 1/2 Cup of Cream Cheese. It came out moist but not soupy, which how we prefer our Corn bread Casserole. It looked beautiful when cut.  I only wish, I would have taken a picture of it after it was cut to show how pretty it presented. I also doubled the recipe so that it would make a 9 X 11 pan.

This has a good taste but was dry.  It was more like cornbread with extra corn added in.  I will make it again, but I will either cut the cornbread mix or add an extra can of corn and maybe some green chiles.

Rave reviews and super easy. I had the Penguin cornbread mix from Costco and was worried the measurements would be off. But not at all.  I used 1/2 of the cornbread mix bag and baked it on a 9x13 glass dish for 55 minutes. I also mixed in the shredded cheese before baking. The consistency was perfect.

I have made this casserole at least a dozen times. I  constantly receive requests to bring it to family and church functions! My husband can not have sour cream so I substitute it with one individual container of plain yogurt. We also love cheese so I use two cups instead of one.

Great side dish.  Easy to make and everyone always loves it!  You can reduce the butter - I sometimes don't put the full amount in.  I made it once accidentally forgetting the butter  altogether and it was still ok - just more dry.

I have made this several times, for family and friends, and everyone loves it! First time, I made it as written--- GREAT! But I didn't have the correct size baking pan, so I used one that was slightly larger. When it was brown on top, I tested the inside with a toothpick, and it was done. Another time, I added diced red pepper, diced onion, a 4 oz. can  of diced green chilis and a 4 oz. can of sliced black olives (be sure you drain the chilis and olives!). This was also great! Once I used half and half instead of sour cream, since I didn't have sour cream, and it also came out great! In my opinion, it is very rich and filling, and I have always gotten 8-12 servings from this recipe, serving it as a side dish. Maybe if it's served as a main dish, it is only 4 servings?

I make this several times a year - pretty much thanksgiving and any bbq. It's so easy and yummy. Only difference really is that I mix all the cheese in with the rest and bake for about 40 mins total and then let it set. It tastes better next day actually, which makes it great for make ahead events! I don't add any seasonings, just the main ingredients, love this recipe!

Very good.  I use all the ingredients except cheese and I only add 6 TBSP butter.   We are savory taste lovers so I add 1/8Tsp ground nutmeg.  I drain the whole kernel corn.  Sometimes I use frozen corn.  I have also made this with GREEK 2% yogurt - plain no flavor.  

Now - I beat the eggs then add the sour cream and combine WELL with the eggs.  Then I add the corn & nutmeg and combine WELL with the eggs  & sour cream .  Then I add corn muffin mix and mix well.  Only then -LAST- I add butter and mix well.  It goes into a  1-1/2 quart casserole dish.  Because the dish is deep it takes 1+ hour to bake at 350°F.  We don't like soupy corn casserole and -- my oven IS NOT calibrated correctly so your cooking time might be more or less.

I doubled the recipe (so I also added a little more baking time to it) and added a little more cheddar cheese to it and it came out wonderfully. I use this for mainly holidays, and the family keeps asking about it.

I found this recipe and made it because I had everything in my pantry already.  I omitted the cheese just because it seem to fit the recipe.  It turned out wonderful!  I will definitely make this again.  I could eat it breakfast, lunch or dinner, that's how much I love this side dish.

Love this corn casserole! You can easily add in other ingredients like green chile, chopped bell peppers, etc. for a variation if wanted.

Really liked this recipe, tried it for the first time for Thanksgiving.  I made it "as is" without changing anything other than making a double batch, I have a LOT of guests over for holidays.  My only hint is that if you're making a double batch as I did, make it in two separate casserole dishes... it takes over an hour to get the center cooked in a 10x14 pan. Despite the long cook time the outside didn't get burnt or dry and everyone demanded that this becomes a new staple at our holiday dinners!

Made it twice.  Liked by all w/  1 turkey & 1 BBQ meat dinner.  Easy to make & probably fine to make ahead, refrigerate & bake next day.

I wasn't sure if it was supposed to have a pudding texture. I used frozen corn n no eggs  n also baked it for 60 min at 350 then an additional 40 min at 325. I thought it would b more of a corn bread texture but the taste is great. Did I do something wrong or is it supposed to have a soufflé  texture ??

This a great corn pudding style recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and split the batter between 2 smaller casserole dishes. Both cooked in 50 minutes with a moist, flavorful result. Even better warmed the next day!!

This recipe has become a family holiday tradition! I have made it for two family dinners now, and get so many compliments and people ask me for the recipe. They tell me to be sure and make it for the next dinner.  The best thing is that the kids will eat a veggie because they like it too!!

I have been using this recipe for years. Its one of our family favorites at Thanksgiving and Christmas. I also make it for "dinner on the grounds" at church and the dish is always empty when it is time to go. I don't put the cheese in it, But if you are a big fan of cheese, you can add it. It's awesome without the cheese!!!

I just made this delicious recipe for our supper.  I only had a 6.5 ounce package of corn bread mix rather than 8.5oz.  Also, my creamed corn was 14.5oz and my niblet corn was 15oz.  I used the full can of each.  I mistakenly added the cheese to the batter.  It was not a problem!  It turned out perfectly, baked in my 11 inch round stoneware pan from Pampered Chef.  I will make this again.  My husband loved it!

I add about 1/4 to 1/2 c of cream cheese.  Crumbled bacon also gives it some added flavor.  Leftovers also freeze well.

I made this for the homeless shelter - they loved it and wanted seconds.  I quadrupled the recipe and it was enough for 35 people.  I made only very minor changes.  I sauteed a little minced onion (1/4 cup for the quadrupled recipe) in the butter while it was melting, and added a little black pepper.

This recipe works great for a crowd, but you do need to increase the baking time to about an hour and fifteen minutes total.

Well, I haven't taken it out of the oven yet...I have made several similar recipes from this site--All good! I didn't have cream corn, so I added half and half to the mixture. I also added real bacon bits, and 1/2 envelope of vegetable soup mix that I had in the cupboard. I used 1 can sweet corn and about 15 oz of frozen corn. I added cheese and sour cream, probably about about 1/2 cup so I used 2 eggs as the recipe stated, along with the corn muffin mix. I added some kosher salt, a dash of sugar and a few sprinkles of black pepper. I plan to put more cheese on top and bake until ready! My baking pan was 9 x 11.

This recipe is almost like the recipe that I had growing up. I have modified it to make it a little more healthy. I only use 3 Tbs of butter, skip the cheese, and I use 1 16oz bag of frozen corn instead of the whole canned corn. I like it to be a higher percentage of corn and less bread. Also, you can cook this in the crockpot 2 1/2 hours on high, stirring it after the first hour. Or, you can cook it in the microwave for 20 minutes on high, stirring it every 5 minutes (it doesn't get the golden brown top though). Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe. People always ask for the recipe when I take it to parties.

Good / different and was better the next day heated up!  I think the next time I make, I will try 1-2 tlbs of surgar as someone suggested.  Was "jiggly", but set after about 5 min standing time

Its the repeat offender at any family gathering. It tastes really good with stuffing or cottage cheese on my plate. My Fiance Loves it and his family adore it. So Brownie points for me!

I made this for a holiday dinner and it was a huge hit. The only thing I did differently was to reduce the amount of sour cream to only 1/4 cup and added a bit more cheese. Everyone asked for the recipe.

Perhaps it says 4 servings because it's so good that 4 people would eat it by themselves! I made it for a Christmas party and everyone LOVED it! I'm making it again today for my husband's office party.

I've made the recipe over and over.  Love it!  Only thing I do differently is not add the cheese.  Forgot it one time and never noticed the difference.  So, I have forevermore left out the cheese.  I like to add a dollop of extra sour cream on top when I serve it.

Just the comfort food we were looking for on a cool fall night!  Used mexi-corn for a bit of color, smart balance light instead of butter, and fat free sour cream, with (I believe...) equally yummy results.  Didn't have cheddar, so mixed in a bit of mozzarella, but I think this might be just as good without the cheese.  Yum!!!

This was a yummy recipe. I accidentally bought 8oz. of sour cream instead of 16oz., and it still turned out great! Next time I'll use 16oz. and see if it tastes any different...

This is a good base recipe but you have to tweak it to give it flavor.  For one, you need salt and pepper.  And you can add other things like hamburger, onion, or ranch dip (instead of plain sour cream).  But it's a good place to start.  I liked it alot.

I made this recipe with jiffy cornbread mix, and I didn't have to add the sugar as another reviewer suggested.  This dish turned out fantastic!  My husband hates scalloped corn, but he was impressed with the flavor of this dish.  I would definitely make this again for a special occasion or potluck.  It really is just a little too much for a "regular" family meal and makes way more than 4 servings!!

This was sooo good. Made it for Thanksgiving in the desert in a motorhome. I didn't have all the ingredients but made it anyway. I cut the recipe in half but used soften cream cheese in the tub, 6oz green diced chilis and sprinkled hot pepper flakes,I used 3cans of yellow can corn. I will try it the right way next time. Everyone who ate it loved it.Also for green bean casserole we didn't have mushroom soup, we used jar turkey gravy. Worked out great couldn't tell the difference. 
Thanks

This recipe was loved by my whole family.  We continued to eat the leftovers for a few days after.  It was very simple and easy to make.  My husband special requested it for Thanksgiving. I did add 1/2 an onion for something a little extra and I think it made all the difference.

This was delicious and was a little reminiscent of the corn stuff you get from El Toritos except this recipe has cheese in it.  Yummy side dish.

I have made a similar version of this for several years (only 1 egg and no cheese, with a little sugar). On Christmas day, my granddaughter helped me make this and she said that she really liked corn. I added another can of whole corn, but drained it of all juice. It turned out great and was a big hit with all the grandchildren. I will be making it that way from now on.

We made this as a side dish. Next time, we're doubling the recipe and making it as a meal. This was FANTASTIC! Anyone who likes corn will love this. I don't even think it needed the cheese, which is saying a lot. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this today for dinner and  it was good- light and fluffy.  I would recomend this as a side dish and not a main dish.  It is a cross between corn bread and a souffle.  I drained my corn and used the entire corn of creamed corn and next time I will add more salt and or seasonings for more flavor.  I was thinking how good this would be with a can of diced green chilies.

I made another variation of this last year and everyone loved it.  Used up all the sour cream early in the day, so subbed plain yogurt with no problem!  This will be a staple on our holiday table!

My family really liked this new way to fix corn. I will definatly fix it again because it tasted good and was so easy.

This isn't very good - it IS very breadlike and not as good as any other traditional corn casserole recipe that comes out of the south.
