Ok this is a really good recipe just needs a little tweaking so I started out by peeling three red potatoes and three russet potatoes and I cut them in to cubes then I boiled them till they're almost done but not quite, "to cut down on cooking time in the oven" then I cooked breakfast sausage "cause that's what I had on hand" I browned the sausage with a half onion and garlic the I cracked eight eggs in a bowel and just added salt and pepper" felt the oregano wasn't needed" so I begin to assemble the casserole I sprayed the glass pan with cooking spray and put potatoes in first then sausage, onions, garlic " and be sure to included some of the drippings from the sausage or bacon this will keep the casserole from becoming dry then I poured the eggs over the top and mixed a little and baked about 20 minutes and the potatoes will finish cooking and then I added the cheese on top and my family were eating there fingers a big hit at my house.

I've been cooking breakfast for my bf every weekend for 7 years. He eats about  near anything so I wanted to mix it up, so I found this recipe and cooked it for him. It takes a lot longer then cooking regular breakfast stuff. It smelled really good coming out of the oven. After taking a few bites we both noticed that it leaves a real eggy after taste and the oregano was not needed. I wont be using this recipe again. But it doesn't mean I wouldn't try different recipes from this website, I really enjoy this site.

I used red potatoes and did not peel them.  The one thing that I would change about this recipe is the oregano.  It was a bit overpowering just mixed in, maybe roasting it with the potatoes would be better.  Also, I would just spray the pan with cooking spray and forget the melted butter.  The bacon produces a lot of fat and stirring the potatoes a few times while they are roasting will coat the potatoes with bacon grease.

This recipe took way longer to cook. I cooked the potatoes for almost an hour and then once the eggs were added it was closer to 25 mins then ten. We didn't have bacon, so we used the little breakfast sausages instead and added Italian seasoning. Overall though...delicious and the perfect thing to have when fixing "breakfast for dinner".

I wanted to bring these into work for breakfast, so I put them in ramekins so as to make individual servings.  They were large, and I got 6 out of them.  I topped with the toppings instead of mixing in since I have a coworker who is vegetarian so I left the meat out of his.  This makes for a really nice, relatively easy breakfast casserole that reheats well.  My coworkers loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The potatoes where a nice change from the usual egg and bread breakfast casseroles. It was hard to judge what "4 russet potatoes" would equal. I must have used to big of potatoes because there really wasn't enough egg. I think next time I'll use 2 cups of diced small  potatoes. I also used Italian seasoning instead of oregano and put it in with the potatoes and bacon.

The idea behind this recipe is a good one, but the technique is lacking. I topped mine with halved cherry tomatoes and served it topped with a tablespoon of each sour cream and salsa.

I suggest par boiling the potatoes and browning them in the oven before adding the egg and cheese.

I used 1 Teaspoon of Italian seasoning instead. I nuked my cubed potatoes, braised that and the cut up pre-cooked sausage patty in olive oil, along with the clove of garlic, before baking.  I thought the dish was too heavy on the potatoes, but modifying the seasonings, it was tasty. I baked in individual breakfast dishes, cutting the recipe in half for my husband and myself.

I'm a Sunday morning, breakfast-making neophyte (husband).  This recipe was easy to prepare, and when finished, tasted okay.  I would definitely cut down (or out) the salt, and DEFINITELY the oregano.  I had no idea that oregano had that strong a taste; it actually overwhelmed the dish.  Thanks for allowing me to share.

Great easy recipe...it was a little dry so I may add some cream cheese or sour cream but overall it was a hit with the family.  I substituted the Bacon for fresh green and red peppers.
