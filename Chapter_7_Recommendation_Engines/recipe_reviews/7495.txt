YUM YUM YUM!  I made this cake yesterday for my husband's birthday.  I made a couple of unintentional changes - I put a whole cup of butter in the cake and I put a whole cup of butter in the frosting (apparently I momentarily forgot that ONE stick is half a cup!)  I also increased the peanutbutter in the frosting to 1.5 cups and added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the frosting.  I topped with chopped Reese's PB Cups and chopped peanuts and drizzled hot fudge around the edge.

The frosting was perfect - not too sweet and very peanutbuttery.  The cake was moist and very tasty.  I used a butter recipe yellow cake mix.

I highly recommend this recipe!  I almost passed it by because the photo displayed shows a chocolate ganache frosting and my husband doesn't care for chocolate that much.  I'm glad it is actually a peanutbutter frosting.  Hubby is a peanutbutter FANATIC and this recipe is a keeper!  (I submitted a picture, too.)

This was very disappointing. While the peanut butter flavor in the cake is spot on, unfortunately so is the flavor that announces, "boxed cake mix." In addition, this is a heavy, greasy cake, not surprising since the recipe calls for twice the fat as normally called for in a boxed mix or traditional 2-layer cake.  I didn't care for the frosting--again, heavy and greasy--about 1/2 c. too much fat, whether it's the peanut butter or the butter. It also requires quite a bit more than than the 1/3 c. cream called for to get it to even resemble a frosting rather than a fudge consistency. I decorated the cake beautifully with chopped peanuts along the side and a drizzle of melted chocolate over the top but even as I was doing that I knew it was a waste of time.  I should have trusted my gut. All told, between the cake itself and the frosting, there is a total of 3/4 cup more fat (butter or peanut butter) than should be in a cake this size that resulted in a heavy, greasy glob (particularly the frosting). I'm not even done cleaning up and the cake is already gone--with the egg shells, butter wrapper and cake mix box.

This cake was sold at auction for $120!  Keep the recipe just like it is; DON'T CHANGE A THING.  

When I reduced butter to 1/4 C in icing, it wasn't creamy.  Add full 1/2 C as recipe calls for in icing.

There was a family when we attended the sports banquets in high school that made this cake, they always brought one for the public and one for themselves, they guarded the recipe with their lives! My dad, a huge penut butter fan always loved it, I came across this recipe last year and decided to try it for his birthday! It's the exact same recipe! He loved it, I love it, I've made it for several picnics and there is never any left over. I am not gaurding the recipe however! Try this, you'll be happy. Quick note, make sure the cake is completely cooled before frosting, otherwise it falls aparts quickly.

Amazing. That's all I can say. Everyone went crazy over this cake...literally. I was making the frosting, look over at my cooling cakes and there is my four year old chowing down on it...about 1/4 of my bottom layer was gone...so you know he loved it. Then I serve it up for my dad and cousin's birthdays and it was seriously a feeding frenzy. My two teenage brothers were actually fighting over who got to have seconds. My husband said it is the best cake he's ever had. I love it because it's a very versatile cake, you can play around with it a lot. I made the cake exactly as the recipe tells because it was my first time making it (other than the frosting...I ended up adding a lot more cream to get the right consistancy), but next time I may play around with it a bit and maybe put a strawberry jelly layer in the middle and have a peanut butter and jelly cake or put chocolate in the middle. There's a lot you can do with it. This is undoubtedly a keeper.

This yeilded a perfect texture cake.  However, I thought that I could taste the yellow butter flavor from the cake mix more than I would have liked.  Next time I think I would use a white cake mix as a base.  The frosting was much too sweet.  I ended up adding  2tbsp. cocoa powder to tone down the sweetness, which helped, but next time I would use a different frosting all-together.

I really like peanut butter, so this was excellent!  The icing tastes like whipped peanut butter fudge.  I am keeping this recipe to hand down to my kids!

I didn't really care for the overwhelming peanut butter flavor in this cake. Maybe with chocolate frosting it would be a little more subtle.

Very good.  My husband had been asking for peanut butter cake for several year and I finally came here to find one.  I used shavings of Hershey's Peanut butter filled choclate bars on the top and surrounded it with Peanut Butter M & M's and it was a hit.  I also used 4 oz of cream cheese with the frosting just because I love cream cheese in my frosting.  Thanks for the terrific recipe. Great with some ice cream.

They put my picture on the recipe.  Too Fun!

This cake is awsome! The tast is so good, and very peanut buttery! I read a review based on fat content, this cake is a 5 star worthy recipe. I'm giving it five stars based on taste and ability to deliver as directed. it does that. I'm not sure this recipe should be given a low rating based on fat and calories. We are not on a weight watchers webite right??? Try this out, you wont regret it.

Everything was great!  I had to bake the cakes for about 10 minutes longer to make sure they were done in the center, but everyone LOVED it.  The frosting is flavorful, but not rich.  And - it makes about twice the amount that you really need... so you could definitely save it & re-use on another batch of (chocolate?) cupcakes, etc.  Also - if you have a pb&j lover, spread a layer of their favorite jam or jelly in the middle of the cake & then cover with the pb icing.  Perfect!!    As the pictures show, I also decorated with drizzled chocolate (semisweet chips melted in a ziploc bag & then snipped the end off to decorate) and some chopped mini pb cups.  It was a HUGE hit!  Also - if you make cupcakes from this, drop a mini peanut butter cup into the center of the batter (make sure it's covered with batter) before baking...  you'll have pb surprise cupcakes.  EXCELLENT!

Like everyone else stated this cake was too dry! So I made a few changes and it turned out GREAT (Very Moist)! I used 1 c. butter instead 1/2 c., only 2 eggs, about 1 and 1/2 c. of half in half instead of the water. I also put a hot fudge layer in the middle of the two layers, which I made myself(1can eagle brand milk, 4oz choc., 3 TBS butter and 1 tsp. vanilla.) Bake at 300 degrees for about 35 minutes. Use these changes and you will love this recipe!

When I looked at the reviews for this recipe, I ALMOST didn't make it based on the critical one star review. I am SO glad I didn't allow that to keep me from this cake...it has a bold peanut butter flavor and is dense and moist..it has become one of my most requested recipes...honestly, it's a cake..not health food..so yep..that does mean fat will be there..if I wanted wheat germ & oatmeal, I wouldn't be making a cake...just sayin... :)

This recipe is very good however I made a few changes to icing. I used a store bought cream cheese icing to which I added 1 cup peanut butter and 2 TBS milk. It made a very nice, but not too sweet, topping to a delicious cake.

This cake is very tasty.  The icing is very peanut buttery tasting and VERY rich.  I would make a little less icing next time.  I put strawberry jam between the layers which we thought added a nice taste.  I will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

If there were 10 stars I would rate this recipe that! This is such a GREAT tasting cake...from the icing to the cake itself. It's so rich in taste you only need a small piece to satisfy your craving! I have made this cake so many times and it always comes out awesome. I even use the peanut butter frosting on other cakes, like my favorite chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting...well except this is now my go to frosting! :-) So good. I didn't change anything to this recipe. Just make it how it says and you will have a decadent cake that everyone will LOVE!

Great recipe!  I made 21 cupcakes in ungreased liners, baked at 350 degrees for 18 minutes. To simplify, I bought a 16 oz jar of honey peanut butter and measured out 1/2 cup for the cake.  I used the rest of the jar in the frosting as well as a 1 pound box of powdered sugar (run through a fine strainer) and 8 Tablespoons of cream.  This is very close to the measurements in the recipe and turned out great.  I piped the frosting on top of cooled cupcakes and stuck a mini Nutter Butter on some, crushed Reese's pieces on some, and peanut butter cups cut into fourths on the rest.  These were lots of fun for a family birthday, I'll make again.

Made it for a friend who loves peanut butter.  She loved the cake so much she had it for breakfast the following morning.  I put fudge frosting between layers and added chocolate chips to top.

My guy hates chocolate but LOVES PB, so this recipe was a no brainer..  It wasn't too peanutbuttery and  the cake was super moist..  I didn't tweak any of the ingredients except for extra cream for the icing.  The icing was too difficult to spread with what the recipe called for, so I just added as I was blending until it was the right consistency... I also added chopped PB cups and reeses pieces to make it fun.. The cake was a hit and will definately be making it again!

I could really taste the box mix flavor in the cake. It was a real turn off for me personally. The frosting was also way to sweet for my taste but it had great texture so 3 stars for that part of it. If cake mix from a box is something you like the I say try it if not look for a fully from scratch recipe.

Yummy! I alternated butterscotch pudding and my own recipe of cream cheese peanutbutter frosting between the layers. Then I crushed honey roasted peanuts and stuck them to the side of the cake. I drizzled warm milk chocolate over the top, it was divine!! My husband loved it, he said he wants it for his Birthday every year for nowon!!

This cake is fantastic!!! I made it for my boyfriends birthday and it was a HUGE hit.  

I mixed all the ingredients with my mixer as some have suggested to give it a lighter texture, The frosting needs no tweaking as it's perfect!  I added crushed peanutbutter cups to the middle layer with the frosting and around the edge of the top as well. YUMM!

I combined this cake and a chocolate cake and used the frosting in between the layers then covered with a ganache.
This turned out so good. I wanted it to be decadent and it certainly was.

I've made this cake twice now. 
1st time it came out INCREDIBLE- made it for a chef and his restaurant staff and they are still RAVING about it.  I made a couple of minor modifications that I feel were key to its success:
1-Instead of 2/3 c water in the cake batter, I used 1/3 water and 1/3 whipping cream. 
2-I felt the frosting as directed was much too heavy on confectioners sugar, so I added more of equal parts peanut butter and butter fluffed together until I simply liked the flavor and consistency- but ended up with extra frosting! I'd say taste the frosting after you've added the 3rd cup of powdered sugar- that's when I liked it best! Add the 4th cup slowly and taste as you go! 
2nd time I made it, it came out terrible... :( Dry and way too sweet with less peanutty richness. Here's where I think I went wrong... I didn't do my modifications the 2nd time around :/ AND I used a plain yellow cake mix since the grocery store didn't have the butter one-BIG MISTAKE. Clearly the Butter Recipe with pudding in the mix is SUPER KEY to this recipe!!!  I accidentally dumped all four cups of powder sugar in the frosting... Then I didn't have my more peanut butter to balance it back out... A total disaster. 
The difference is shocking... SO! To recap. Sub 1/3 whipping cream for part of the water in the batter, ONLY USE BUTTER RECIPE CAKE MIX WITH PUDDING IN THE MIX, and reduce icing sugar in frosting OR increase combined peanut butter & butter until the nutty flavor and sweetness are b

Holy mother of peanut butter cakes (and my family are very discerning pb cake connoisseurs)! This was awesome! I did it exactly as the recipe stated. The only thing I would do next time is cut the frosting recipe in half. That was A LOT left over! It suggested 325* for 25 mins but I ended up having to bake it for about 40 mins. basically, set it for 22 mins and check every five. I know every oven is different, but mine is new (gas) and it still took a lot longer than expected.

I chopped up some Reese's cups and sprinkled them on top and stuck them to the side. Great addition.

I lightly marbled this recipe with a standard chocolate cake mix to make a fantastic Recees Cup Cake for my sisters wedding. Just put both mixes in gallon ziplocks and cut the corners to help dot the batter into the pans. Be sure to do the PB batter first because it's thick and the chocolate will fill around the PB blobs. Frost inside with PB and ouside with chocolate. Your family will go nuts!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. My husband liked it, except that it was very dry. VERY. The only change I made was using chocolate butter cake mix rather than regular butter cake mix. It would have tasted delicious if it weren't so dry. Also, I wasn't very impressed with the icing...the original recipe was too thick, and modifying it didn't give me that smooth finish I hoped for.

This is the best cake I've ever made!  It was a little bit crumbly, but it tasted wonderful.  The icing is great.  At first, I thought of using chocolate frosting instead of the one in the recipe.  I'm glad I didn't.  We all agreed that chocolate frosting would have taken away from the peanut butter flavor.  I think topping it off with Reese's cups and drizzling it with fudge is all the chocolate it needs.

I wanted a cake for a school fundraiser that was different and really "wow". This one is it. The only reason that I didn't give it 5-stars is that I had to do a bit of tweaking, but nothing major. I baked it in a 9x12" pan which required some adjustment of the baking temperature and time (followed the instructions on my cake mix box). The cake itself is very light, tender crumb, and subtle taste. I think part of that is due to using a good quality mix (Duncan Hines Butter Yellow) and then using my electric mixer to almost whip the batter until all the cake mix lumps disappeared. I had more difficulty with the icing. There seemed to be too much sugar in proportion to the shortening and liquid and I got dry crumbles when finished. Some extra milk solved the problem but now I've got really double the frosting that I would have needed. I finished off the top with a mixture of mini peanut butter chips, chocolate chips, and shopped peanuts and this cake is a winner. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

This cake was great.  I used white cake mix instead of yellow, put recess cups on top, and put chocolate frosting between the two layers.  This cake was amazing, everyone loved it.

I made this cake to have at our 4th of July cookout and what a hit, only one piece left.  To add a little chocolate flavor, I sprinkled chocolate chips across the top of the batter before baking in a 9x13 pan.  After frosting, I added 12 peanut butter cups sinking them part way in the frosting to show where each piece would be cut.

Just amazing!  Taste, texture, peanut butter flavor - wouldn't change a thing!  And i followed the recipe exactly (except using yellow cake mix - couldn't find butter).  I made it with Peanut Butter Frosting by Suzanne Stull and I did layers of chocolate cake in-between the peanut butter cake layers with the Peanut Butter Frosting - it was a total hit at the baby shower.  Yum Yum Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!  It's my new favorite.

This was probably the RICHEST cake I've ever made. I didn't like the idea of peanut butter cake AND peanut butter frosting so I made a chocolate cake and used the frosting recipe. It made a perfect marriage of two great flavors. I had my 1/3 cup of heavy cream but it just didn't seem like enough so I added fat free milk to get the consistancy I needed to decorate my cake. Worked great! I wanted to add the chocolate drizzle like the pictures and used Hershey syrup. This was no good. It was too runny and glossy. Next time I will use hard shell used for ice cream or just make some ganache. Hershey's was just the lazy solution.

Basically a good cake but the frosting definitely took more than 1/3 c cream. I would switch to milk next time and add more. decorated with chopped reeses on top, choc ganache, and pirouline around the sides. Very pretty.

Definitely a great peanut butter flavor!  Frosting is spot on for us as it is not overly sweet.  The only problem we had was the cake crumbled easily and did not slice well.  More like 3 and 1/2 stars....... shame , as the flavor was so good!

I wanted to bake a yummy unique cake for a Relay for Life bake sale so I stumbled upon this beauty. 

This recipe was great. I doubled the recipe and used one box of butter cake mix and one box of chocolate cake mix to make a delicious chocolate/peanut butter cake. I also used the peanut butter icing as a base for the cake and decorated the with chocolate icing. 

All in all this is an easy, delicious recipe! I highly recommended it.

My husband loved it, and he is a peanut butter LOVER. I wasn't nearly as impressed. It was too much for me. I won't make it again.

I thought the cake was very dry.  Some people liked it but I think they didn't want to hurt my feelings.  They raved at the "Too much chocolate cake" I made from this site.  This peanut butter cake was not worth the calories.  Sorry.

FABULOUS!  I made this last week for a birthday, and everyone raved!  The only difference was that I added an extra 1/3 cup of water, and a half box of jello vanilla pudding mix.  It was Great and not dry at all!  MUST crumble reeses cups on top!

This cake was pretty good! I made cupcakes out of it and put a frozen Hersheys Kiss in the middle, the result was a cupcake that tasted just like my favorite peanut butter/kiss cookies. The cake turned out super moist, but not too peanuty. I also made the frosting which may have been over kill. The frosting (for me) was too sweet, but everyone I served them to loved them. Thanks!

Amazing! I took 3 peanut butter cups crushed them and sprinkled over top to make it look fancy. I also added them on top of the middle layer before placing the top layer. Mmmm people are still raving about it when I made it 6 months ago! Thank you for sharing:)

This is a fabulous cake, especially for us peanut butter lovers. I made this for my son's birthday when he turned 10 and it was a HUGE hit with ALL the guests, even the adults. I did make a small change though....I used a chocolate angel cake mix instead because my son does not like a yellow cake mix at all. And you just can't go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter! Then with another cake I decided to spread straight, plain peanut butter between the two cake layers instead of icing and that blew everyone's socks off. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!

Marvelous! Thank you so much! This time I added 1/3 cup Ammaretto plus 1/3 cup of water to replace the 2/3 cup water. Also used a bit of milk instead of the heavy cream in the frosting. Awesome stuff- thanks again for sharing! I don't even care for peanut butter, and this takes the cake for me!

We didn't love this, not sure why - we normally love pb desserts. Seemed dry even after sitting for several days...I made it as a sheet cake, so maybe it's better as a layered cake? Wouldn't try again.

Yummy!! Couldn't keep my son or husband out of the frosting!! I agree with others - this would be fantastic with chocolate cake! My only comment - if I made the frosting with 4 Cups of powdered sugar, there would have been wayyy too much left over and I wouldn't have had enough heavy cream!! I used 3 cups of sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup butter and a small container of heavy cream! Will definitely make again! Thanks!!

I found this cake to be rather dry, and I did NOT think the cake had a strong peanut butter flavor at all.  I think I will try another recipe for peanut butter cake.  Also, I used the Fluffy Peanut Butter frosting from this site, and I thought the frosting was great!

Easy Recipe!  I made a few changes - I used cream instead of water in the recipe to make the cake more moist.  The cake was still dense, but that's what from-scratch cakes taste like.  The flavor was great - sweet but not overwhelming.  I iced the cake with the peanut butter icing (GREAT recipe!!) and also with chocolate icing to get a little chocolate taste in the recipe.  I topped the cake with cut up Reeses as well.  I would make this cake again - thanks!

This was agood cake not quite as peanutbuttery as I wanted. In fact I couldn't taste any peanut butter. So you might want to either add more peanut butter or try a different recipe.

This cake is excellent, and not at all dry!  It's got a great peanut butter taste that's not too sweet--when coupled with a sweet frosting it works very well!  I made a few changes to make the cake more peanut butter and chocolate, as this was my BF's birthday cake and he loves the combination.  I just put a layer of whipped chocolate frosting between the two layers of cake, and made a peanut butter buttercream frosting to frost the outside of the cake.  I then decorated with the remaining chocolate frosting.  The cake was delicious and was in fact better after being refrigerated overnight!  Try it!

Loved it!  My family all love peanut butter, so this was a surefire winner here.  I only made one change to the frosting, and that was one cup less sugar and a little more heavy cream -- I confess to not measuring it!  I garnished with chopped Reese's Cups, but I really think this would have been better without the chocolate.  The peanut butter is definitely the star of this show.
Thanks for an awesome recipe.

D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S-!  A great tasting, moist cake with a wonderful peanut butter frosting!  I did use more peanut butter in the cake mix (as well as a dash of vanilla) and extra in the frosting too.  I put a thick layer of chocolate frosting between the two layers, poured chocolate ganache over the top decorated with some mini Reese Pieces.  Most importantly, not too heavy :-)  THIS IS A KEEPER!

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday, he's a massive PB lover, and he adored it, he ate the whole thing by himself over the course of a week!  It's a very dense cake, and I baked it ina 9x13 pan as one layer, and it worked very well.  I didn't use the suggested frosting, instead I just used store bought (I know, bad!) chocolate frosting, but then I crunched up a ton of Nutter Butters, and pressed the crumbles on all the frosting to give it a nice crunch and aesthetic appeal.  I posted pictures of the final product, if anyone wants to see what I'm talking about.  I definitely recommend this recipe, based on my boyfriend's response!!

I was nervous about trying this, since most peanut butter cakes I've had in restaurants have tasted like fake peanut butter. I was pleasantly surprised how great this one tasted! It is very peanut buttery. 

The changes I made were that I only used 3 cups of confectioners sugar in the frosting and instead added another heaping tablespoon of peanut butter. I also used natural peanut butter throughout the recipe. Everyone I served it to thought it was sweet and rich.

This is a great cake; and I agree that it's better the second (and third and fourth ...) day after being in the refrigerator.  I for one, like chocolate, so I made a chocolate frosting and put it between the cake layers.  I kept the peanut butter frosting on the outside and sprinkled fresh chocolate shavings all over the top - very pretty!  I call it the Inside Out PeanutButterCup Cake.

I really liked the cake part of this recipe.  I used a white butter cake mix and added pb chips.  The frosting, however, did not turn out as I expected.  It tasted way too much like butter - I expected the peanut butter flavor to be really strong and it wasn't.  Perhaps using only 1/4 cup butter next time and a little less sugar might help.

It was too fragile to handle the thick heavy frosting. Ended up using 1/2 c. whipping cream then milk & vanilla to thin the frosting so I could spread it on cake without breaking it. My daughter is a huge PB fan and didn't care for it at all. Wished the cake was more dense and the frosting more light. Won't make again.

Great recipe. You might have to tweak it for the icing. Instead of water i used apricot nectar (you can use pair nectar too).

I made this cake for my dads birthday, and it was AMAZING! I didn't use a box cake mix because I don't like to use boxed mix for anything. So, I used a butter cake recipe and I put in a cup of better instead of 1/2 a cup. I also put a layer of chocolate fudge in between the cake layers because I love chocolate and peanut butter together! Lastly, I left the cake in the oven for much longer then it calls for because it seemed a bit doughy. The final result; melt in your mouth peanut buttery goodness!

This is an outstanding cake! I don't usually use cake mixes but after reading the positive reviews, I had to give it a try.  The only change I made was replacing 2 tbls. of the mix for 2 tbls. of peanut flour. Loved the density of the cake and the frosting is to die for. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I don't even like peanut butter (unless it is sweetened and wrapped in chocolate) so I made this cake for my husband's birthday (thought I finally found a cake I could keep my hands off of) I was wrong! I ended up eating almost the whole cake! It is not overwhelmingly peanut buttery. I iced it with the peanut butter icing, but added some decorations with a chocolate buttercream, worried that the cake needed chocolate. It doesn't. This cake is amazing just as it is. Loved it!

I would recommend this cake to anyone to try at least once. I made it for my husbands birthday and took it to supper with us. Everyone loved it and took doggy bags of it home. 
I added mini chocolate chips for decoration on the inside. It came out moist & tasty!
I can't wait to make it again!

Everyone absolutely adored this cake!!!! I added some cut up banana and cinnamon to some of the peanut butter frosting and used it as a filling. It was absolutely incredible. I only made the recipe once but people are still raving about it 5 months later!

This was an okay cake.  Not fabulous.  The icing was quite sticky and hard to work with.  The cake was dry.  It did have a nice peanut butter taste.

Was not my thing, but it might be yours. The cake turned out well. I followed the recipe exactly except for using milk instead of cream. I could see how some would think this cake is excellent. The taste just wasn't as great as I hoped. I won't make it again unless requested.

Smelled good baking, looked good as a batter, but when I baked it the centers were not cooking and the edges were done.  I had to keep adding baking time until it was burnt and no good and center STILL did not cook.  Followed the recipe to a T, so I am not sure what went wrong.  Used the right size pans and everything.  Sorry would not recommend this cake recipe.  (Oh, I am an avid baker, so it's not like I am new to baking and have no idea what I am doing, I have over 30 years in baking).

The cake was very light and moist and wasn't over all overly peanutty. It was very nice. The frosting was the same way. It wasn't overly tasting of powdered sugar and the peanut butter in the forsting was vert light. However, the frosting over all, was way way heavy. I had a dickens of a time spreading it over the cake. If I would have thought about it. I would have replaced the heavy cream with regular milk. Problem with heavy cream is that it thickens as you beat it. And I didn't think to much about it until my frosting was balling up in my kitchen aid and not whipping well like an airy frosting should be. However the taste was quite nice. And the added chocolate to the cake made it splendid.

This cake was terrible!  My son and I absolutely love peanut butter, so when I saw this recipe, I thought that it would be great...boy was I wrong!  Niether one of us liked it.  It even had a strange smell when it came out of the oven...wierd!  The frosting is good, but don't bother wasting your ingredients on this cake recipe.  There is another recipe on this site for a peanut butter cake that is really good.

If I was rating just the cake, I would give it a three. Although the flavor is good, the packaged cake mix taste still comes through. It is also dry and doesn't hold together well.   If I was rating just the frosting, I would give it a four. It tastes AMAZING, but I only needed two cups of powdered sugar and significantly more cream than called for...so much in fact that next time I will use milk in order to spare some fat calories.   If I was rating it on what my colleagues said about it as they ate it, then I would have to give it a five. They really enjoyed it and ate it all.  I will definitely make the frosting again, and the cake I may play with a little. When I figure out how to make it less dry and crumbly, it has a lot of potential.

I have to agree with others that this cake is very dry.  It has a decent flavor, but it was so dry that I definitely wouldn't make it again.

I botched the cake part because I beat it too long, I didn't read the instructions carefully.  But I wanted to comment on the frosting.  This was so delicious, I couldn't stop licking the utensils.  Some people had trouble with the frosting being too stiff but I added water until I reached a smooth spreadable consistency.  You need to add a little at a time and check it because you still want it to hold its shape and not drip.  I had made cupcakes and applied the frosting with a plastic fork.  It made great swirls without using too much frosting.  And the swirls held up and didn't blend together so it was very pretty.  I sprinkled a few bits of heath candy on the top for a little crunch because I didn't have the mini choc chips which I thought would have been good.  I never thought to make a peanut butter frosting but this was so delish.

I tried to bake this cake again since I didn't follow the instructions the first time.  I felt like the cake had a good taste but it is too crumbly and dry.  I had to have water to wash the cake down my throat.  I decided to alter the recipe and came out with a lighter cake by adding a package of vanilla pudding and 1 cup of water instead of 2/3.  It was much better to eat but the peanut butter taste is diminished a bit.  Will try to use 3/4 cup peanut butter and delete the butter next time.

Was a great recipe. I added a ring of peanuts on the top and made sections with them and then put a few different types of jellie in the sections. I had to add more butter and cream to the frosting to make it the right consistency (too dry), but overall it turned out great. Really tasty, and I loved it even better the second day after it had been in the refrigerator!

A tasty cake but I did find a bit on the dry side. Peanut butter taste is there in both the cake and the frosting. I liked it but I don't think I will make it again.

Well, I did not find the cake very good at all. It was a little dry with not much peanut butter flavor. The frosting, with more cream added, was good though--sweet--but good. I actually prefer the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting on this site, though, for my taste. But if you have a real sweet tooth this may be the one for you.

This is a great recipe, but make sure to don't bake it too long. I only had a butter recipe chocolate cake mix on hand but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Very good! I made cupcakes and the first pan I baked too long and they were a little dry. I reduced the time on my second pan and they were perfect.

I'd give this 3.5 stars.  This cake barely had a hint of peanut butter taste to it.  It was still good just not what I had hoped for in a peanut butter cake.  Will try it again with more peanut butter next time.

An awesome cake that got rave reviews from my hubby! Can't wait to share it with family and friends, this is going to be my easy, no fuss, good to the last crumb cake for all occasions! I followed the recipe exactly, and then poured a homemade chocolate ganache on top which tasted great (I'm a fan of chocolate and peanut butter). My husband was jokingly complaining the next day that I had too much cake in the house and he couldn't stop eating it. Definitely a keeper. :)

Oh, and I absolutely LOVED the icing!

The frosting is AMAZING--it has that homemade taste and quality.  But the cake needs improvement.  With a frosting like this, it deserves something more than a box-cake mix base.  Overall, very tasty & not overwhelmingly peanut-buttery.

OMG!! if you love PB and love cake, then this might be what you're looking for. I used moist white cake mix and 1 whole cup of crunchy PB, for the frosting I just got a white one from the supermarket and added PB to it, it turned out amazing! so delicious! and is done so fast. :-)

Great cake and frosting.  Definitely a rich cake and was a big hit with everyone.  The frosting was a little difficult to work with but I probably should have done a little more cream to thin it.

My daughter is a peanut butter fanatic but doesn't like chocolate.  I usually like to test recipes first before using them for a special occasion but wasn't able to do so on this one. I made it for her birthday that we celebrated with the whole family (grandparent, aunts, uncles etc...).  There is none of this cake left!!! I did use the advice of others on the frosting and added a little more cream and butter but wow, wow, wow I've never had a cake eaten up like this one.  I will make this again for the Family Picnic coming up in July!

I made this cake, which was perfect for my dog's 1st birthday party (along w/ our going away party).  I used a 9x13 cake pan.  Ended up dividing it in 1/2.  the 1/2 I made into a dog paw & did just the cake & frosting.  the other 1/2 I made into an ice cream cake.  I used 3/4 carton of Reese's ice cream, slightly melted & spread it over top.  Put in freezer til firm.  Took it out then frosted it with remaining frosting (left over from the other portion of cake).    EVERYONE LOVED IT -- whether they had the ice cream portion or the plain cake.  So many people asked for the recipe.  I did add 1/2 bag of PB chips to the batter. :)  For the dogs, we made homemade dog ice cream & the people of course had reeses!  YUMMY!    I'm a PB LOVER & this was superb!

I made it for my husbands birthday cake, he's been asking for a peanut butter cake for years! I read some reviews saying it was dry ..but they must've done something wrong because this is an incredibly moist cake, gosh with all those eggs and the oil from the peanut butter, how can it not be moist?  We baked ours in a 13x9 pan for 35 minutes. As for the frosting, we used only about half the sugar and enough milk to make it more of a glaze than a frosting. Very good ..VERY GOOD!

My boyfriend loves peanut butter anything, so I had to try this cake. He liked it, but I thought the cake part was really dry. I have been cooking for 30+ years so I'm pretty sure it wasn't that I overcooked the cake or anything like that. I think perhaps oil added to the cake mix would have made it more moist. The frosting is really good, I wouldn't change that at all. I melted dark chocolate with butter and drizzled it across the top of the cake, that worked out ok.  I would have given this 4 stars but the cake was so dry that it seemed a mediocre recipe to me.  I mean it's good for sure, but not great. Maybe I will try it again with some variations. Thanks for the recipe!! :)

Excellent peanut butter taste to the cake. I added chocolate chips to the top of cake for decoration. The frosting was very sweet, but good. Will make it again!

This cake turned out BEAUTIFUL!! However, it was quite dry!! I'm not certain as to why it did but I followed the recipe to the "T"!!!  That's ok though, we just served it with Vanilla IceCream!! I would maybe recommend maybe adding applesauce to making it a little more moist?? Just a suggestion.  Either way, it was eaten and the Birthday Girl who requested it was simple AMAZED at how it turned out and that I actually made the cake and didn't purchase it!!  Thanks again for sharing your recipe!!!!

This is a great recipe, I made them into cupcakes and they are nice and light, but cook them at 350 and don't over fill the papers, they spread out on top.  The frosting is good as well, I added a little vanilla and a tinge more cream.  Also added a little drizzle of chocolate on top with a half a peanut butter cup so people knew what they were, and to break up all the peanut butter flavor.

This cake is GREAT!!! It was a big hit with the kidz, my daughter wanted it for her birhday party.  The only reason it got four stars and not five is because I added a package of cream cheese and some vanilla to the Icing, yummy taste just like the reeses pieces peanut buter!!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have been baking this cake for years, and I must say..  everyone loves it! I'm cooking two in a few months for a wedding! Be double SURE to use unsalted butter. I made the mistake of using salted butter once and it gave the cake a dry, weird texture. Great recipe!

This cake was yummy, but the peanut butter frosting on peanut butter cake was too much.  My cake was four layers filled like this: layer, pb frosting, layer, chocolate ganache, layer pb frosting, layer.  Guests told me that they wished I had filled the whole cake with chocolate ganache to cut the sweet taste of the peanut butter cake.  Also, the cake is VERY soft.  This is good for some, but if you want a four layer cake this recipe wont do.  My cake smooshed in on itself because it wasn't dense/sturdy enough.  Also couldn't cover with fondant, but I should have known that as most box cakes aren't sturdy enough.

Made this for my husband's birthday. It was very good! After reading some reviews I added almost 3/4 cup peanut butter to the cake mix for that extra PB flavor. Also, once I poured the batter in to the pans I stuck some cut up Reese's Peanut Butter Cups all around, then called it "Peanut Butter Surprise Cake"! For the frosting I used Half & Half because I had some that needed to be used up. The frosting was light enough that I was able to use some coloring and make the cake "camo" colors since my hubby is in the army. Everyone loved this cake, especially my peanut butter loving husband!

This is a delicious cake with "peanut butter" taste. It is not greasy and neither is the icing. It also doesn't taste like a boxed cake mix (somebody must have used an old cake mix). I really think some of the reviews were written without trying the recipe. Highly recommend this recipe!!

This is a pretty, tasty cake, but the cake part was lacking.  The frosting is excellent and very peanut-buttery.  I did have to add almost twice the amount of cream to reach the right frosting consistency, and the addition of 1 t. vanilla really brought out the flavor.  The cake part, however, was a bit too fluffy and dry.  Not the rich dense, peanut buttery flavor that I was expecting.  Also, the cake tends to fall apart a bit because it was too fluffy.  I had to bake the rounds for 35 min., and be sure to grease and FLOUR anything that touches the cake well, or it will stick and crumble.  I will definitely use the frosting another time but I won't bake the cake.

I've made this recipe twice for different birthday parties and it's been a huge hit both times!  The first time I used yellow cake mix that I already had and it still turned out very good.  The second time I used butter cake mix and it made a huge difference - just when I thought it couldn't get any better, it did!

Heavenly! I made this cake for father's day, however my dad wanted chocolate frosting with it. So I made the cake, but I added 3/4 cup of peanut butter, in my second try, as the first one for me, didn't have a lot of peanut butter flavor. Also on the second try I made the peanut butter frosting and put a layer of it between the two cakes and frosted it with milk chocolate frosting, then I topped it with chopped nuts and goobers (chocolate covered peanuts). This resulted in absolute chocolate and peanut butter heaven!

All I can say is YUMMY!!!This cake is so moist and flavorful. I made it for a family reunion...there was non left afterward and I got rave reviews and many people asked for the recipe.I will make this one again. It was so easy. I made a three layer cake and drizzled hot fudge in between the layers and on top I also added chopped party peanuts to the top.

This is fabulous. It's all owed to the frosting though. The frosting is basically Buckeyes without the chocolate and thinned to be spreadable. Any peanut butter lover will flip over this.

I baked this for my roommate's birthday cake, but used the "fluffy peanut butter frosting" instead (thought this one sounded too sweet).  he's a peanut butter freak & he RAVED .. and ate every bite.  I did sneak a small nibble for myself, and I enjoyed it very much also.  I will definitely be making this one again & again.  the only thing I changed was that I used "more" peanut butter and "less" butter - don't ask about quantities, I never measure!  yummy - and THANKS for this one!!

I just made cupcakes with this recipe.  I read all of the reviews first.  I beat 3/4 cup organic Kirkland brand peanut butter with 1 stick unsalted butter. I then beat in the 4 eggs one at a time.  I then added the yellow cake mix alternating with 3/4 cup of water.  I beat this mixture until it was light and fluffy. The mixture was sticky and a tad difficult to get into the paper cupcakes which I filled 3/4 full.  I started out at 20 minutes and they were far from done.  I checked every couple of minutes and ended up with approx 29 minutes.  I tested with the old toothpick. I just ate one - hmmmm - I am going to top with purchased milk choc icing.

This RICH and SWEET cake is delicious! I served this at Thanksgiving. It was a HUGE hit. I used butter recipe mix (Duncan Hines Golden Butter Cake Mix) and added 1 tsp of vanilla w/the eggs.

I made this cake for my parrot's birthday - yes, my parrot. She's eleven and she's had a rough year, so I wanted to make a cake in her favorite flavor. Chocolate is a no-no so I was glad to find a pb cake recipe that did not include chocolate. It was a big hit with both her and the humans. The frosting isn't as sweet as I was afraid it would be, which is great. I did have to add a little more cream to be able to spread the frosting, and it was still really sticky, but that was okay. Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake is really good. I did use a yellow cake instead of butter cause that's what I had on hand. It does turn out dry, but good taste. I chopped  a few mini reese's cups on top like another reviewer. I also only used 3 cups of the powdered sugar for the frosting and used milk instead of cream cause I didn't have any. Turned out fine and I will make this again, but maybe try to find a way for it to be a little more moist. Thanks for sharing!

After the major event that making this cake turned into, I wanted it to be better than it was.  That being said, it is still really really good, but I don't know that I'd say it's GREAT!  The first attempt I made was a flop as the cakes weren't done (they'd been in the oven for at least 35 min when I pulled them....they weren't done in the middle I realized when I put them on a wire rack.  I then made the colassle mistake of putting the cakes-ON the wire rack-back in the oven.  Don't do that.).  I decided to give it a second go and baked the cakes for prob 35-40 min at ~335 the second time.  The cakes were done!  The icing was AMAZING and I could easily rate that a 5.  I only used about 3C of 10X sugar and probably slightly more heavy cream than was called for.  The cake tasted ok, it was just, as other reviewers have noted, pretty dry and I prefer a moist, stick to the back of your fork cake.  So, I would def rec trying this icing, but I will keep searching for another PB cake recipe.  TY!

I must say, this was a pretty good cake. I added cream cheese to the frosting. People kept scraping the frosting off and eating it...hehe. My husband loves peanut butter, and enjoyed this cake on his birthday. Thanks.

I made this cake for my boyfriend who is obsessed with peanut butter.  It was fantastic and moist. I only used 3 cups of sugar instead of 4 and added french vanilla creamer instead of just heavy cream or milk.  This has got to be the best cake I've ever made. In addition, I also topped it with Nestle's peanut butter and choc morsels. This is definitely a 5 star cake!

This cake was fantastic!  It was a bit dry on it's own, but once the frosting was added, it was plenty moist.  I cut each cake in half and spread each layer with hot fudge and frosting and a handful of chopped peanut butter cups.  I ended up having to make another batch of frosting since I used so much inside the cake.
The frosting for this cake is amazing.  It tastes like a peanut butter cup.  I made this for company and nobody could stop eating it.

We love peanut butter desserts and this one got great reviews. The only thing that I did differently was with the frosting I added a little extra peanut butter and had to add more heavy cream to get the right consistency. I piped some frosting around the bottom and on top. Drizzled some fudge topping (recipe from this site)and placed hershey kisses with peanut butter filling on the top. A slice and cup of coffee was the perfect ending to our dinner tonight. Thanks for sharing and I'll be making this cake quite often.

This is not for the faint of peanut butter heart.  Must drink with milk or coffee.  The co-workers loved it.  I left the batter in the mixer for a bit to make sure it didn't get too dense.  I don't know if it helped or not.  However, this was a VERY good cake for peanut butter.  Think I might try a chocolate cake mix the next time.

Excellent- I followed the advice in some of the other reviews and decreased the amount of powdered sugar in the frosting.  The cake was a big hit with both my family and my coworkers.  I also used canned chocolate icing between the middle layers, and would probably use chocolate icing to do decorative stuff as well.

This cake has a wonderful flavor. It is great without the frosting and topped with vanilla ice cream. If you decide to use the frosting in this recipe I would suggest a thin layer because it is a bit much for the cake.

I like this recipe  but thought I would "spice" it up a bit with peanut butter chips and chopped pecans.   No frosting,  and baked into a 9 x 13 pan for 45 minutes.   Very tasty

No changes. Just monitor the cream when making the frosting. Reese's peanut butter makes this even more divine.

Goodness - This recipe looks simple but is almighty powerful.    I made this for my husband's birthday and it was more than a big hit.    Moist, moist, moist, and very peanut buttery!!!   My sister n law wants me to sell them - ha ha.     I would rate 10 stars if I could.   A real keeper for sure!

I altered the recipe in the following ways:
-- I used white cake mix
-- I added a bit more peanut butter to the batter and frosting
-- I used a mixer to "whip" the batter and frosting.   Didn't change the flavor but definitely the consistency. 
-- I broke up 8 Reese's cups and stirred into the batter
-- I topped the cake with broken Reeses

If you are looking for the best peanut butter cake you've ever tasted (even over bakeries), you've got to make this!!

A very easy to make cake, follow the directions and you should have no problem. Sometimes I add a little coco powder to the frosting just for fun. You can decorate as you please. I usually chop up peanut butter cups and then drizzle with chocolate ganache.

This cake was very tasty and quite rich. It reminds me of the Nekot sweet peanut butter crackers. I reduced the sugar in the frosting by half a cup and next time I will reduce it by an additional 1/2 to 1 cup. My other modifications were to add a layer of peanut butter ice cream, drizzle with hot fudge and top with crushed pb cups and salted peanuts.

I made this cake for two co-workers who are moving on.  Everyone loved the cake and disappeared quickly!  However, I did have problems with the icing.  It took more than 2/3 cup cream to get it to a spreadable consistancy and then I had trouble getting the icing to stick to the sides of the cake.  Since I've not worked with peanut butter as an icing before, I'm not sure what the problem was.

Oh  my........to die for!
This cake will put you on peanut butter overload.  You taste the peanut butter in every bite!  The frosting is not for the faint of heart.  It is creamy peanut butter taste and really complements the taste.  I crushed up some mutterings candy bars for the top and walked away.  The cake was gone in 3 days!   For the nutella lovers, I think you could sub the umbrella for peanut butter for a twist on flavor.

So I followed the recipe but put my own decorating spin on it. I put Nutella spread between the two layers of peanut butter cake and topped the top of the cake with Reese's pieces and Reese's peanut butter cups that I cut up. This cake turned out to be my son's favorite bday cake, and some of my family that aren't big cake lover's loved it so much they requested it for them. Also I made this recipe onto cupcakes.

I made this and the kids and husband loved it. The cake box called for 1/3c butter. I ended up using 1/4c butter and 1/4c peanut butter to be closer to the fat content that the box recipe called for. It was definitely peanut buttery and still fluffy and cake like. Not greasy at all. For filling I used whipped cream and banana pudding. I topped with whipped cream and chocolate ganache.

The first time I made this everyone loved it, but like some other reviewers I thought the cake was dry.  So the next time I made it I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and instead of 4 whole eggs I added 2 whole eggs and 2 yolks (this is because egg whites can make a cake drier).  Also, watch it and make sure you don't overbake it.  Turned out even better with these changes!

This was a great great recipe.  We went to dinner at our neighbors house and I was in charge of desert.  They could not believe how delicious it was.  I piped the top and used Hershey kisses. Absolutely loved this recipe and the icing was not crazy sweet.  It was just right.  I called it my peanut butter kiss cake.  Saved to favorites for sure.

WOW!! This was so good. I threw some chocolate morsels on top while it baked. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I too 
drizzled melted chocolate on top of the icing. This is a keeper thanks.

I made this recipe exactly as stated, except after making the peanut butter frosting,I added 1 cup chocolate frosting to it. This cake was a big hit. Everybody loved it. Didn't want to give out the recipe, wanted them to think it was my own invention, but I ended up sharing the recipe. Will be sure to make this again.

Even though the peanut taste wasn't really strong, (i guess i put too much water :O) , the peanut frosting was a relish. Creamy, peanut-ish, tasty. I also used my own white cake mix recipe that i got from allrecipe.com, and that made the texture of the cake really soft and fluffy, which contributed to the success of this peanut :) I suggest putting less water, or 1 egg less (if ur using ur own cake recipe) cause i guess this recipe included the eggs needed for the cake mix already, so there isnt any more need to add additional eggs required in the cake mix. Overall, i would give a 4 for it was a success (My aunt, whos a picky eater, loves it too. My brother went ''NICEEEEE'' on the first bite, and my grandma did not criticised me for my cake this time). The missing 1 comes in for improvement to be made in the appearance :)

The frosting was AMAZING, but I found the cake to be way too dry. The flavor was good though-- I think I'll go with LADYHEN's unintentional mistake next time, and use two sticks of butter instead of one. I also chopped peanut butter cups and drizzled chocolate ganache on it and this helped to disguise the dryness of the cake a little. I'll definitely try it again.

A really delicious cake without any change in the recipe. And the peanut butter flavor was just right - not too weak/strong. On the other hand, it is a very rich cake (with the frosting) which I wan't exactly expecting. Still tastes great though.

This makes an excellent cake. To make from scratch, substitute 3 cups cake flour, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 3/4 tsp salt, 4 tsp baking powder, and 2 1/4 tsp vanilla for the box mix. Add the vanilla with the wet ingredients and mix the dry ingredients together before incorporating. Don't forget to add the water! 

I also created an extraordinary peanut butter buttercream to go along with this cake. The base is a classic french buttercream, to which 3/4 cup of peanut butter is added. The buttercream is made as follows:

Soften 2 cups (4 sticks) of unsalted butter, either by letting sit at room temperature for several hours or microwaving on defrost setting until softened. Place 6 egg yolks in a bowl and beat until thick and lemon-colored. Combine 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small pan. Heat on medium, stirring, until sugar dissolves and mixture begins to bubble. Stop stirring immediately and continue to heat until a candy thermometer registers 240 F. The mixture will be thick and gooey. Immediately pour over the yolks with beaters running. Beat until room temperature. Add the softened butter and beat until mixture is the consistency of whipped butter. To this add 3/4 cup peanut butter and beat again until the consistency of whipped butter. This could take up to 5 minutes on high setting. 

Another delicious variation is a hazelnut butter cake. I ordered Dundee Orchards creamy hazelnut butter from amazon. Substitute it for the peanut butter in the batter and buttercream. 

Enjoy!

The whole family loved this cake.  I used extra PB in the cake and frosting. Drizzled with hot fudge and crushed PB cups.

I doubled the recipe and made a 2 layer cake and 24 cupcakes. I put reese cups inside half of the cupcakes. Every person who tried any of it absolutely raved about it! I will be making this again very soon.
The only thing I did differently was add more heavy cream to make the frosting spreadable. My dad said the frosting was perfect!

Oh my gosh! This was heaven! I used chocolate cake instead of the butter cake, it was just like a Reese's peanut butter cup! Wonderful!!! Asides from using chocolate cake I didn't change a thing. I decorated it with peanut butter cups and chocolate sauce. It was pretty and delicious!!!

Was looking for a quick cake to make for my sister's birthday who is a peanut butter fanatic and I didn't have time to go to the store. This got rave reviews and I'm told it was perfectly rich with a glass of milk. I made a 2 layer cake and topped with the peanut butter frosting along with chocolate ganache and peanut butter cups. This one is definitely a keeper!

Disappointment!  The flavor was okay, but I couldn't get over the severe dryness of the cake.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  I will not make this cake again. On a good note, the frosting was really good.  Nice texture. Smooth.

I have made this cake a few times now and it gets rave reviews every time. I did up the peanut butter in the batter to one cup. Even the frosting is delicious. Use can use any flavour of cake mix and it is still so so good. This recipe will definitely stay on the top of my best cake list.

Best cake EVER!!!  I made a peanut butter and chocolate cake for my husband's birthday using this recipe as the base and I can's stop eating it.  I made the peanut butter cake batter from this recipe adding about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup more peanut butter and a little more water to thin out batter. I added peanut butter and chocolate chips to this batter.  I then made a butter chocolate cake batter (boxed) and added to peanut butter batter and did a marbled effect.  After baking in two 9in round pans I added store bought milk chocolate frosting in between the cakes and frosted the entire cake with the peanut butter frosting.  Peanut butter frosting is to die for!  I used about a 1/4 cup more peanut butter, 3 cups of confectioners sugar and a bit more cream.  I had a bunch left over.  I garnished with reeses.  The cake was most and all together it is not too too sweet.

This cake is awesome!  I made it for a large family gathering and everyone loved it.  Instead of a layer cake (I discovered I only had one round pan) I made a bundt cake and it worked great, even if the baking time at 325 was over an hour!  For a bundt cake, there was WAY too much frosting, so I am making it again this weekend for another gathering to use up the leftovers.  I added ReesesPieces around the outer edge and on the top.  The only suggestion given was to add peanut butter chips to the cake batter to make it even more peanut buttery.  This is a keeper in our family!

I hate peanut butter but my husband is a police officer and they wanted me to make a PB cake. So I found this recipe and it was a huge hit. My husband called and said that they said it was the best PB cake they ever had. I used my stand up mixer to make it, if you dont have one it may be a little more difficult to make. Other than that it was easy and delish :)

I made this for a birthday cake and used a white cake mix since that's what I had on hand. For the frosting, I used almond milk and increased the peanut butter to 3/4's cup as suggested by another reviewer. This did require more milk, but just add slowly since it's very easy to go from not enough to oops! way too wet. Only one word left to describe--AWESOME! Why some failed, I can't explain. This is one of the EASIEST recipes ever, and sooooo good!

Excellent!  I made this for a birthday party and everyone loved it, I've had several people want the recipe.  Also very simple.  I found that I had to beat the frosting longer than I expected to get it nice and fluffy -- so if you don't like the frosting consistency, keep beating.

I was forced to use a plain yellow cake mix for this one because I couldn't find 'Butter' cake mix anywhere, I have also never heard of butter cake mix for that matter.   However if anyone has a recipe for butter cake or knows where it can be found please post it here on this site.

this is my new favorite cupcake recipe.  It is fantastic!  I make them all the time! I can't wait to make a cake with it, the picture looks incredible.  I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.

Yum!  The frosting for this tasted just like my mom's peanut butter fudge, only in frosting form.  I will definitely keep this recipe around to play with.  I really want to try the frosting on brownies.  Thank you so much for an awesome recipe!

LOVE this recipe.  Super easy to make.  I made 12 huge cupcakes at the same time and temp.  I used store bought choc frosting on some and p.b. frosting on others.  Definitely the p.b. was a sweeter cupcake than the choc... but BOTH are delicious!  Also had a friend make this as a Reece's pb cake with crushed reeces cups on top.  It was AWESOME.

I put in a sheet pan so wish I would have used only half the frosting as it was very sweet.  I had trouble getting the cake to bake in the 25 minutes required - don't know what I did wrong - it tasted very undone in the center.  There was a great peanut butter taste to it.

I used this recipe to make "Reese's cupcakes" with yellow cake mix instead of butter cake mix, not realizing there was a difference. I was also generous with the peanut butter... probably closer to 3/4c than 1/2c. I also used buttermilk instead of water.  The flavor was great and they got RAVE reviews... but I am more critical of my own baking and thought they were a bit dry or overdone especially around the edges. I had them in at 350º for 23 minutes, but next time I will probably decrease baking conditions by about 10º and 2 or 3 minutes. (I wish I could ask for additional suggestions on how to make this cake a little moister!)  I used a prepared Chocolate Fudge frosting, blended with softened peanut butter.

Baked this in a 9 x 13 pan, too lazy to make layers!  Sprinkled with chopped up PB cups.  Kids absolutely go nuts for this cake.

Very, very peanut buttery but awesome. I made this for my husband on Valentine's Day because he is a peanut butter-aholic. His first response was "Wow! Mmmm... I am going to need a glass of milk with this baby."

I really thought this cake would be dry. But it wasn't at all. The flavor was wonderful. I made this for Sunday night dessert. My family didn't get around to having any, by monday when I came home from work it was gone. The kids and their friends found it and it was devoured! Telling me it was the bomb and asking if i'd make it again. I now have the birthdates of my boys friends and i'm expected to make them a cake. Great recipe, do give it a try!!!

This cake was awesome.  My husband's mother normally makes him a peanut butter cake for his birthday.  The past couple of years that has not happened as they go south now for the winter.  I made him this cake and in his words "This cake totally poned his mother's cake"  Poned=ruled in my 16 year old's language.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.  I did, like a few others have to add more cream to get the frosting to a spreadable texture...I will add even a little more next time.

This cake was great - strong peanut butter flavor, good texture, and not too sweet. I used chunky peanut butter and a butter-flavored cake mix because it was all I had in the house and the final result was delicious!

I made this cake per my son's request for his birthday and overall, this cake is excellent... the taste is perfect, but it is a little dry.  I noticed it when I was pouring the batter into the pans. I may try to adapt it, but it truly is a great peanut butter cake recipe! Thanks for submitting it

Before making this recipe I read the reviews. I was amazed at the high expectations. I think that using cake mix is a way of cutting corner. It's convenient. Unfortunately you are still using cake mix out of a box. So let's be realistic. You can not expect a half cup of peanut butter to wipe out the taste of the cake mix. If you used pureed pickles instead of  peanut butter you would still taste the cake mix. Overall the recipe was okay. I can't comment on the frosting because I used store bought chocolate frosting. I took off one star because I had to shorten the cooking time. You do not want to overcook this one.

I have been eyeballing this recipe for sometime and finally made it today. The cake itself is fantastic, but the icing to me is a little too sweet. Me being a sweets junkie, this is rare for me to think something is far too sweet. I had to scrape much of it off so I could finish my piece. It goes great to a glass of milk. I would still recommend this recipe and I would also highly recommend melting milk chocolate to drizzle on top with crushed Reeses.

I made this for my peanut-butter-loving boyfriend, and I think I FELL in love with this cake. I like dense cakes, and this one totally fit the bill. The outside came out fantastic, formed a wonderful crust. Next time I may put chocolate frosting in the middle of my layers, but the peanut butter icing was delicious too. Just the right amount of sweetness and peanut butter.

Yummy!  I made it just as directed and it came out absolutely superb!  The frosting was the BEST part of the entire recipe.  I think next time I will make a chocolate cake and frost it with the peanut butter frosting.  Yum-O!

My family loved this cake.  The icing was incredible.  I followed the recipe except that I whipped up an extra half cup of the heavy cream and then folded it into the icing before putting it on the cake.  It wasn't necessary, but I don't like my icings too sweet and the extra whipped heavy cream brought the sweetness down to a level I like.

made this today for my niece's thirteenth birthday party and it was a hit! instead of yellow cake mix i used chocolate, just 'cause i love chocolate and peanut butter. i stuck pink and green peanut m&ms around the top edge and in the center to support the candles. it was totally cute and tasted divine, especially soaked in a little ice cream. thanks for a great recipe!

I had never heard of a peanut butter cake before, until my stepson asked me to make him one for his 18th birthday. I did a search and found this one. The reviews sounded so good. It was a hit. It was just right, not to dry , wonderful flavor. It was such a hit that when our church announced a dessert contest for our 4th of July celebration, my husband wanted me to make this. Awesome cake. Thanks for posting the recipe.

I'm not a fan of Peanut butter cake but my family is.  My mom wanted one for her birthday. I never made one so I found this one online and made it. It was easy to make and everyone loved it! Thanks! I did make it as a sheet cake though.

This was a great cake!  I made a 3-D Winnie-the-Pooh that the peanut butter frosting was the perfect color for him!  Blue came out a bit teal for his hunny jar but it was just fine. My girlfriend said this was the best doctored cake mix cake I have made.  If you don't want so much peanut butter taste chocolate frosting is wonderful on this cake too.

This has a very good peanut butter flavor. I had some problems with my cake though, it cracked and fell apart. I used chocolate fudge icing in between the layers and patched it the best I could and then iced it with the peanut butter icing. 

In the icing I used 2.5c of peanut butter and 4c conf. sugar and enough heavy cream to get it to an easily spreadable consistency. 

It dosn't look "professional" as the picture submitted by another person...but it's cute.

I had been looking for a recipe for a peanut butter cake for years. I finally came across this one. I loved it!!!!!! My husband and kids loved it. I decorated it with peanut butter cups and reeses pieces. I will make this again. Next time, I might use cream cheese to cut down on the sweetness in the frosting.

This recipe turned out very yummy!I made this for my mom's birthday because she loves peanut butter, and I added chopped-up Reese's pb cups on the frosting for presentation.  It was nice and moist, and it was even better the next morning with coffee... cake for breakfast, terrible, I know! It was very rich, so there was more than half left over, but it got better with age. I'll probably make this again for my mother-in-law's birthday as well.

I've made this cake a few times now and it turns out great every time.  The frosting is great... I think you really do need the cream.  It's just not the same with milk.

I made this cake for my sister's bday, and I loved the icing recipe for this cake when you added the cream cheese, as recommended by some reviewers. It was delicious! It tasted like peanut butter fudge, and the consistency wasn't that far off either- I could've eaten the icing by itself it was so good (my friend did =) ). As for the cake itself, it was so-so. I didn't care much for the consistency of the cake that came from putting peanut butter in it- it made the cake very thick (although we did not eat the cake on the same day I made it).

I made this for a dear friend of mine.  She requested a peanut butter cake for her birthday.  We since just had another get together and once again requested the cake.  This one is a keeper for sure.

This was ok. I don't like using boxed mixes as a base for my cakes--it seems like it's cheating. That said, it was a very heavy, dense cake. The flavor wasn't as pronounced as I thought it would be with the amount of peanut butter used, and the only flavor being peanut butter made it a little boring. I'd layer the middle with some sort of chocolate or fudge if I made this again, and drizzle a bunch of chocolate over the top to make it more edible.

This cake is fantastic.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is very rich and I only ate half of one slice (I used a 9x13 pan and cut into 24 pieces).  I can't imagine eating 1/12 of that!  Flavor-wise it is a 5 star recipe and will wow anyone. I used milk in the icing and it was very easy to work with. Like others, I topped the cake with chopped peanut butter cups and drizzled with chocolate ice cream topping. I used a french vanilla cake mix, but next time will try another kind as the vanilla was a bit overpowering.

I made this and used it yesterday in a contest with my husband's battalion. It won best taste! The Marines my husband works with said that they would be happy to take anything I bake off my hands any time!

I followed the instructions but made a few changes. I sprinkled mini chocolate chips onto the layers before baking and used a chocolate chip frosting in between the layers. I put crushed peanut butter cups on top. I also put chocolate Marine Corps coins on top because it was a military event.

I thought it was really good but you need a big glass of milk. I think the cake was a TAD dry but I am not sure what to do to fix that. The chocolate with the cake is awesome and goes great with the peanut butter.

I made this cake for my father-in-law's birthday.  I followed the recipe exactly, as I am not one to experiment with recipes when other people (outside of my immediate family) will be eating it!  The cake was light and moist.  The frosting was creamy and delicious!  I will definitely make this again!

This cake is fabulous!  I did have a problem with the frosting, I ended up using about double the cream that was called for to get it to the proper consistency.  Other than that, it came out moist and delicious!!

Very good!  My husband is a peanut butter lover and he enjoyed it very much.  I followed other reviews and went for a white box mix instead and did egg whites and it came out very light and fluffy.  I used a bundt pan and increased baking time. I didn't have time to do an icing so dusted with powdered sugar it was still delicious.

This cake is awesome!  it was a hit with everone that tried it.  it is very filling so cut small pieces to serve so it has more than just 12 servings.  it tastes just like peabut butter.

i just noticed the calories in a serving so i will only be making this for birthdays.

i used my stand mixer which beats batter and gets teh air in.  so the texture was great.  imight try using just egg whites next time and jusing jam as filler in the middle. i also used a yellow butter cake mix instead of just yellow.

This cake was very dense, I was hoping that it would have melted in my mouth. I also drizzled jam on top so it was like a PB & J.

The cake itself did not taste very peanut buttery. I used store-bought chocolate frosting. Perhaps if I had made the suggested peanut butter frosting that came with this recipe it would have made a difference. Personally, if I were to make this cake in the future, I would just forget about adding the peanut butter to the cake and just go ahead and make a yellow cake topped with peanut butter frosting.
