I am a Nutrition, Dietetics, and Hospitality Administration Major @ Northern Illinois University and one of our MAJOR projects for completion of this degree is to create a menu and serve it in a buffet style restaurant ran by the students who create these menus.  I used this recipe in my menu and received nothing but good comments on it.  There were over 75 people served that day and the chicken turned out to be the most popular menu item!

This recipe is great. I've made it many times before, but with a few variations. I find that adding a touch more garlic and a bit more honey helps liven up the flavor and washes out the "ketchupy" taste. I also find that to pack more flavor into the chicken, one should let the chicken marinate in the sauce overnight rather than baking it immediately. Very tasty. My husband loves it.

Nothing special.  My husband's comment "Not your best effort!!"  I agree, it could be better.

This dish was excellent. I used the sauce and put it over bone-in chicken in a crockpot on low for 8 hours and the chicken came out moist and the sauce was great! Will make again!

Easy and delicious. I skipped the searing part - who needs the extra calories? I marinated it for about two hours and then baked it covered for an hour, uncovered for 15. My family loved it!

Tastes really good, but I cooked uncovered for an extra 10-15 minutes, to crisp everything up a bit(otherwise too watery) Absolutley an easy recipe!

I added about a teaspoon of ceyenne, 1/2 t. of chili powder, and about 1 t of Worcestershire sauce; will add more spicy heat next time.  Substituted agave nectar for some of the honey.  Used an all natural ketchup to skip the high fructose corn syrup.  Agree with other reviewers in that I will skip the searing next time; seemed like a waste of olive oil and a pan; sauce was plenty flavorful without the oil.  That step can be equaled by browning it uncovered in the oven at the end of cooking.  Very easy with ingredients nearly every kitchen already has.

Liked this recipe. I just made a mix of my own marinade. Seasoned the chicken really well and removed the skin. Made a marinade of honey, balsamic, little soy, and whatever BBQ sauce I had on hand. Let marinade for 2 days in the fridge. One day should work. I was just busy and couldn't cook it right away. Covered in foil baked for an hour and took foil off for about 15 minutes to make crispy. Worked great.
I am trying to learn how to take and cook the skin off of chicken and the this recipe worked. The chicken was still most and tender.
I had chicken leg and breast, cut and skinned turned out great. I think the flavor comes from seasoning the chicken once the skin is off. I let the seasonings sit before I put it in the marinade.
Poultry, garlic/parsley, onion, pepper, garam masala, basil. Totally good.

My children and I absolutely LOVE this recipe w/ any cut of chicken...tonight was thighs, last time drum sticks.  It is one meal of week we all agree on.  So simple, yet so good.  I usually make 1/2 the recipe, but double up on the garlic...yum!

I thought this recipe was decent, but nothing special, so I'll give it a 3-star rating. It's certainly quick and easy, but I was a tad disappointed in the "BBQ" sauce. I thought the flavor was actually halfway between BBQ sauce and sweet-and-sour sauce; the latter has its place, but I was really hoping for a BBQ sauce here. I made the recipe exactly as written, using chicken thighs (I thought I'd bought another cut of chicken too, but it turned out to be all I had on hand). The recipe didn't say whether or not to discard the olive oil the chicken was seared in, but I chose to discard it. I served this on a bed of cooked long-grain white rice, which soaked up the sauce nicely. This was nice enough, but didn't really stand out.

I read several of the reviews and added more garlic to get rid of some of the ketchup taste as others had suggested and also marinated for 2 hours prior to baking.   I also seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper since some reviews said it was a little bland. The only good thing was the chicken was moist.  But did not like the taste at all.  I still could only taste the ketchup and vinegar.  Will not be making again. I guess I was looking for a more traditonal BBQ sauce taste.

It was a nice change because it was tangy and sweet, but I wouldnt categorize it as BBQ.  Was kinda watery, but the sauce was actually yummy.  Would be good served over rice.  More like an Asian dish.

It wasn't great and I wouldn't call it BBQ sauce. It tasted more like shrimp sauce to me. I had to add a lot of things to make it less sweet. I added garlic salt, ginger, pepper flakes, soy sauce and lime juice.

Making this tonight!! I did a lot of spur of the moment additions. I don't measure so gonna just put abouts. Lol. 1 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup honey. 1/2 cup light brown sugar. 3 packs of mustard (all I had were package from Chinese last week, would have used more if I had it) 5 packs soy sauce (same as the mustard, lol) tablespoon of onion powder, teaspoon chili powder, teaspoon onion powder, dash of oregano (probably would omit this next time) a ton of garlic salt (this is my weakness, I use it all the time) and black pepper to taste. Mixed it all on the stove(the sauce taste amazing on the stove) and put over chicken breast in a 9x13 pan in 350 oven. Respooning the sauce over the chicken every 15 minutes and going to flip the breast half way through. Have it going for an hours but going to check on it every time I reapply the sauce. Probably going to make white rice and serve it over it cause I have a lot of sauce. I'll let yall know how it turns out. Posting a picture every time I respoon.*UPDATE* the sauce thickened in the last 15 mins. Still put it over rice cause it was saucy still. AMAZING.  Husband loved it.

Made this tonight, I followed the recipe exactly and it was not good. The sauce was very watery when the chicken cooked, I even tried to reduce it down, by placing it on the stove. Kids used our regular store BBQ sauce to give it flavor. I won't make this again.

Use any oil based dressing (like italian or raspberry) instead of vinegar and it can get interesting the tasts you come up with.

The tangy sauce in this recipe makes a nice change from the oft-used cream soup-based sauce used with chicken.  I don't recommend using it with boneless skinless breasts as I did, however.  It still tasted good, but the skin probably gives the chicken a nice glaze.

Absolutely amazing! I added about a tablespoon more of honey and a tablespoon of yellow mustard. I also didn’t have red wine vinegar, so I used red cooking wine. The alterations did not disappoint, so delish! Absolutely recommend!

Really good.  I added a bit of brown sugar as still found it a bit acid.  It was fast and easy.  Good to adapt for grilled chicken too

350 degrees for 50 mins wasn't enough time to cook the thighs and legs I prepared. If you are using whole pieces like that, I would recommend planning on at least an hour and possibly at a slightly higher temp.

Just made this and used pear infused vinegar ( no red wine vinegar on hand). I thought it turned out delicious. I will use this recipe often.

This was excellent! My boyfriend and I liked it very much. The sweet taste is rather unusual for us (I added more honey to loose the ketchup taste) but we really enjoyed it, and it is also very easy to prepare.

This recipe was very bland! I had to add things to give it some flavor.

From the reviews, I was expecting a wonderful dish. I am sorry, I was not impressed.  I followed the recipes as is and came out with a BLAH dish!
