I am the author of this recipe. My kids love this dish, and I created it with their young palates in mind... if you're cooking for adults, definitely kick up the spice!! I most recently made this dish as a stuffing for stuffed peppers.  I had some salsa I needed to use, so added it while the quinoa was simmering.  To bake the peppers, (I only stuffed 3) I stood them in a loaf pan, added condensed tomato soup to the bottom of the pan, and covered with foil, baked at 375 for about a half hour, uncovered and sprinkled with cheese, returned to the oven for a minute, and served with black beans.

Love this recipe! I double or triple the spices because it seemed bland the first time I made it. I also love to add a can of black beans (rinsed) and a can of no salt added corn for a heartier version. I add the beans and corn about 3-5 minutes before the quinoa is done. Great with some fajita veggies and salsa all wrapped up in a whole wheat tortilla!

This was fantastic.  It is a clever take on  traditional Spanish rice.  I used canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce to give it a little more of appeal.

Great recipe. They're delicious stuffed in green peppers. I boil the peppers for 5 or so minutes first to soften them, then add the quinoa mixture and put back in the oven to melt with pepper jack cheese. In the mixture I used 1/2 of a red bell pepper and a can of tomatoes in lieu of the sauce, but make sure you add less water (or we used veggie broth) to account for the water thats cooked off from the tomatoes.  A few things: I agree with others on increasing the spices a bit.  And for me this recipe always takes longer than the stated prep/cook time. Takes a little over an hour or more from start to finish.

My sister and I really enjoy this recipe. The only thing I do differently is add less liquid as the first time around it was a little too mushy and we add more spices. This recipe is a keeper and will be making many times this new year.

My favorite quinoa recipe so far.  I increased the spice a bit, and added some salt at the end, and it really hit the spot!

This has proved to be an extremely versitile dish.  I initially prepared this dish as a side dish for tacos.  We thought it a bit bland as a stand-alone and I was a little disappointed.  I had plenty leftover, showever, so I've used it as a substitute for rice in several other Mexican dishes from walking tacos to chile rellenos to stuffed peppers.  It has gone over VERY well!  While I wouldn't make this again as a stand-alone side dish, I will definitely make it again for a rice substitute in just about any other dish.

This is SO good!  I don't typically like Spanish rice -- it's often too dry.  This turned out moist and PERFECT.  I served it with Southwestern Pork Chops.  Even my 2 year old ate it -- and wanted more!
I halved the recipe, but I think 3/4 would have been perfect for our family of 4.
eta: I tried this with couscous tonight instead of quinoa.  The only difference was adding the couscous last, and reducing the water to 1 1/2 c. It only needed to cook covered for about 5 minutes.  It was just as tasty, but took a fraction of the time!

This was very good. I used a pobolano pepper instead of a green bell pepper. I also ended up using more cumin and garlic and salt. It was VERY good. I will be making this again! thanks for a great recipe!

Loved it!  Instead of the tomatoes I used one can of Rotele's Mexican Fiesta (drained), cut the chili powder in half, added 1/2 tsp of salt, doubled the cumin, used 1/2 a yellow & orange bell pepper, one can of black beans & I think I forgot the garlic powder.  My husband requested, REQUESTED that from now on I serve this w/all our Mexican style meals. (In the past he has wondered allowed exactly why it was that anyone thought quinoa was fit for any animal other than birds.) I paired it w/Pan Fried Tilapia w/tomatillo and red pepper sauce from this site... Amazing meal. Also followed another reviewer's suggestion and added it to scrambled eggs and cheese and served as breakfast burritos (hubby didn't even mention missing bacon which he thinks should be served w/all meals... especially breakfast).

The flavor was good, but there was way too much liquid in this. I'd reduce the water to 1 1/2 cups, and use broth instead of water.

Very good recipe, although I felt it needed a little something extra. I tripled up the spices and added some lime juice to taste, and that gave it a nice tangy kick. I also added black beans and corn. Roasted some bell peppers, stuffed them with this mix, and added some cheese.

Spanish rice is one of my favorites and this was a great substitute now that I can't eat rice. Quinoa is fairly new to me and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. The changes I made was to add extra onion, garlic, and spice. Oh, I also added some cilantro and used a couple thai chiles in place of bell pepper. I was amazed at how good the flavor turned out to be. Thanks so much for sharing!!

I had only made quinoa once before for my family of five, and they weren't thrilled to try again. But this was great! My changes after reading reviews: I rinsed the quinoa, used olive oil for the sauté, and used red, green and yellow bell peppers with onions & garlic. I added a 7 oz. can of green chilis with the liquids. I used chicken stock instead of water and Pace Chunky Salsa Medium instead of tomato sauce.  I offered grated cheddar cheese for topping, which the kids loved, but it didn't need it. HUGE hit all around. Thanks, Momi!

Wonderful recipe...so simple and easy to adjust to your own tastes.  I added ground beef and mushrooms.  This would be great (as others have indicated) as a filling for stuffed peppers or in burritos.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This recipe caught my attention immediately when figuring out what to do with quinoa. Instead of tomato sauce and peppers & onions, I put in a can of tomatoes & green chiles.   At first I thought I'd put in waaay too much water (I didn't measure) but a little simmering and leaving the lid off helped. It was a little gluey, but the flavors were good. Next time I'll be more careful (hello measuring cup).   I added a LOT more chili powder and 1/2 teaspoon jarred crushed garlic and chili garlic paste as well. Just the right amount of heat for me.  I made burritos with vegetarian refried beans and some pepper jack cheese. Would be great with a little sour cream as well.

Excellent, i had a different twist on this recipe, i used pablano and sweet red pepper, diced tomatoes and low sodium beef broth, added some cayenne for heat and extra garlic. When the quinoa was done, mixed in the black beans and rolled into wheat tortillas with low fat cheese and made wholesome healthy burritos. Thanks for the idea, it was my first time useing quinoa. Boom!

This was my first experience cooking quinoa.  I made it to go with "Addictive Sweet Potato Burritos."  I also made "Refried Beans without the Refry," but I did black beans and cooked them on the stove top (did not mash).  I had all this wonderful spiced bean broth left over, so I used 1 1/2 cups of bean broth and 1 c. water in the quinoa.  The flavor was excellent and I can see myself cooking a lot of quinoa in the future, as I really enjoyed the texture and pretty much everything about it.  However, I found 2 1/2 c. liquid to be WAAAY too much.  After 40+ minutes of simmering, there was still a LOT of liquid, and the quinoa was tender.  I didn't want it to get mushy, so I drained it through a fine mesh sieve, then reheated it over med-high heat for a few minutes just to evaporate some of that leftover moisture.  I don't know if this was caused by my use of bean broth, or if there really was just too much liquid.  Either way, next time I'll try 2 c. liquid and see how that fares.  Otherwise wonderful and everyone enjoyed it!

You MUST try this recipe!!  This was my first time making quinoa and it is fantastic!  Fast and easy too.  How good, you ask?  I made it for dinner, we had leftovers for lunch twice that week, and I already made it again over the weekend!  Doubling the spices is a must.  And I followed others' suggestions of adding black beans and corn (also a bit crushed red pepper for some heat) and used whole wheat tortillas for burritos (makes 10-12 burritos).  My husband, a huge meat eater, really likes them and doesn't miss the meat.  They travel well (to work for lunch) and freeze well too.  Perfect make ahead meal; make it once for dinner and have it for several times in the future.  Thanks for the great recipe; definitely a keeper!!

My favorite quinoa recipe yet! I added extra spices, and red pepper flakes. Stuffed in green bell peppers that were boiled for 5-10 minutes on stove, then baked in oven all together for 30 min at 375. Turned out great and the bell peppers were a perfect balance between crunchy and soft.

Yum! I've been an AllRecipes member for years and this is the first time I've been inclined to write a review! What a delicious and healthy substitute for spanish rice.  I disagree with other reviews who have said this dish cannot stand on its own as a side - we had it with tacos and thought it was fabulous! My boyfriend couldn't say enough good things - he can't wait for his brothers to try it (one of whom is a chef that owns a successful local restaurant)! I did change a few minor things based on what I had and other reviews. 1) I thought I had some fresh garlic at home, but was mistaken, so had to use garlic powder.  I added quite a bit (I rarely measure powders) to the quinoa/pepper/onion mix and did not add it again with the fluids. 2) I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil. 3) I used about a 1/2 cup of Newman's Own salsa in place of the tomato sauce to add a bit more substance. 3) I hate using water when I could use something else with more flavor, so I used about 2 cups of chicken stock and 1/2 cup water, then added a "Tomato with Chicken" bouillon cube (found in Mexican section of your grocer). 5) Lastly, I couldn't find any cumin, so just left it out! I know that seems like a lot of changes, but the base recipe is great!! Definitely a new favorite dish... I even used some in place of meat in one of my tacos! Can't wait for the leftovers :)

So good!  And good for you too!  What a great alternative to spanish rice, and it tastes just as good if not better because with the quinoa you get that crunchy texture and nutty flavor.  Toasting the quinoa prior to adding the liquid is essential!

This was great...I made stuffed peppers as suggested in the reviews. The only change was that I mixed in some shredded pepperjack cheese and half a can of corn right before stuffing.

This was very tasty! I didn't have green pepper so I just omitted it, added extra onion instead and it was still delish! I also just used taco seasoning instead of the separate seasonings, and added a bit more garlic salt and some cajun seasoning. A great alternative to rice, it was fantastic in a tortilla!!

So I created a login account just to rate this recipe!  I thought it was well worth it!  I've been trying to find more glycemic friendly recipes and quinoa is great.  But this recipe?   This outdoes anything I've tried so far!  FANTASTIC!  I did make my own revisions as most people do.  Didn't have a green bell pepper so skipped it.  I always use green onions with white onions.  I added a bit more cumin and put in some tumeric as well.  Added a bit of basil and used both diced tomatoes (undrained) as well as tomato sauce.  YUMMY YUMMY!

On many recipe reviews I read that people double or triple the seasonings/spices.  Ground spices start to deteriorate as soon as they are ground.  It may be the AGE of your spices that make the recipe bland, not necessarily the quantity the recipes asks for.  Just be careful if using the advice of others to double or triple quantities!

I double the spices, but otherwise followed this recipe exactly.  It was so delicious!  The flavors were simple yet amazing, and the texture was prefect for stuffed peppers or just eating as a side.  Nicely done!

First time ever making Quinoa and we liked it! The toddlers were not a fan but my husband, myself and the baby loved it! We don'tlike chunks so I put the onion and green pepper in the food prosessor. Next time I will add less water because it turned out slightly mushy, maybe I cooked it a little too long!!! Made it with the tofu tacos I from this site. It was an awesome  combo!!!!! Thanks!!!!

This was very tasty. I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used tomato paste. I had run out of chili powder too, so I substituted it with paprika and 1/4 tsp cayenne. For more flavour, I doubled the spices and seasoned with salt and pepper. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious. I did add a bit more seasonings for my tste, but the recipe is very good. I happened to have some extra ground turkey taco meat so added a little to the quinoa after it was cooked and a dollup of sour cream. Perfect for lunch or dinner.

This was really delicious. Doesn't need much salt. I added carrots to make it more of a side dish, then used it in a burrito later in the week!

Delicious! 

I only had tomato paste instead of sauce, but since others commented that there was too much liquid in the recipe, I kept the water amount the same and just added a heaping tablespoon of tomato paste. I also doubled the spices and added some chicken bouillon to the water.

To clean out the fridge, I threw in some leftover jalapeno and diced tomato with the peppers and onions as they were cooking and added some leftover black beans at the end. 

It turned out great and I will definitely make this again!

I thought this was fabulous. I had a little fresh tomato I needed to use up, so I diced and added it. My "boys" said it is a keeper...which is the fist quinoa dish they have said that about. While I like the recipe as is very much, I think it will also become a "base" for many other dishes to come.

I am always looking for new quinoa recipes and this was was fabulous! (A friend and I am eating some right now).  The only negative thing I can say is that it was a lil bit bland, so I added salt & pepper and it was perfect!  Another review suggested double the spice recipe & using veg broth so I will try these ideas next time :-)

I was looking to make quinoa for a healthy lunch option... I took one reviewers suggestion and added some black beans, corn, and diced up steak ... (did double the spices) I rolled it in a sundried tomato tortilla (the red tortillas), and sprinkled a bit of cheese ontop .. YUM. will make again, love this recipe..

Made this last night and I couldn't be more in love!
I pumped up the flavors adding a little more of the onion, garlic and spices (1 1/2 t garlic salt and 1 t cumin).  I exchanged the toms for a can of chunky fire roasted tomatoes and omitted the bell pepper.  For creaminess I added about a 1/2 c of Coinga cheese (Spanish Semi-cured cheese) I had from Costco.  Served as a side dish with a small dollop of sour cream.
Thank you for this recipe! YUMMMMM

Oh and this morning we made breakfast burritos with scrambled egg, Spanish Quinoa and a slice of pepper Jack cheese wrapped up in a whole wheat tortilla.  It was a total hit!

Fabulous Quinoa!  I used beef stock, spicy Mexican tomato sauce, Cardamom pods and  blanched broccoli added to the finished Quinoa.  I always use less liquid to Quinoa to get a fluffier texture.  Loved it!

I tried this recipe yesterday evening. It was the first time I cooked quinoa. I loved it, its flavourful and delicious with the tomato sauce. I threw in some leftover grilled vegetables (zucchini, eggplant, tomatoes, onions and peppers) and it was made a wholesome, healthy meal. Thanks for sharing

LOVE this recipe! It's the first recipe I've made with quinoa that I've actually enjoyed. I followed the recipe pretty closely but instead of the water I used a can of stewed tomatoes and about a quarter cup of water.

First: this is the best Quinoa I have ever had - not your typical "hippie tabbouleh" style.  Second: I added a couple threads safron, salsa as recommended below, and substituted one can 14.5oz diced tomatoes (half liquid drained) for tomato sauce. Third: omitted green pepper just cause I didn't have it. Outcome: Awesomeo! Conclusion: Safron = the secret.

very tasty, I used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce because that is all I had in the kitchen, and it turned out almost like a hearty chili. Very good.

I also used this a filling for stuffed peppers. To keep with the spanish flavor I used enchilada sauce on the bottom of my baking dish and added 1 lb. of lean ground turkey to the mixture. Very tasty!

This is my first time cooking and eating quinoa.  I thought the taste was wonderful with the suggested changes from other reviews (I tripled the spices), plus added about 1/4 tsp salt.  And although the taste was great, it was a little mushy.  I think next time I will decrease the water to 2 1/4 cup.  Still, I think it was great!

This was very easy and hands off to make. This was my first time using quinoa, but it made a believer out of me. I ate this on a tortilla with sour cream and salsa. I really liked it this way. My two year old gobbled it up on burritos. I will make again.

Loved this! Kids ate it too, without complaint. This made a great side to some sweet Italian chicken sausage links.

I wanted to try something different. I didn't have a bell pepper so I used broccoli instead…it turned out great!

Tried this today and fell in love with it. I added a small carrot too along with the veg and quinoa at the beginning. It was amazing alone, but we ate it in a wholemeal tortilla along with sliced tomatoes and green peppers. Already being requested again!

I really enjoyed this recipe and I plan to make it again.  Due to other reviews and personal preference, I did add more spice.  The first night, I used it as a filling for a stuffed pepper.  Yummy!  I had a lot left over (cooking for one, here), so I decided to add some cooked frozen corn and rinsed black beans to create a burrito filling.  I put about 1/4 cup of filling into 10" wheat tortillas.  I just re-heated the first burrito last night (after being frozen for 1.5 weeks) on high for 45 seconds per side, served with Greek yogurt, and had a delicious dinner!  This turned out to be a very economical recipe for me.  Thanks!

This is a good "base" recipe, but I did add quite a bit to increase the flavor. I only used half the tomato sauce, and replaced the other half with mild salsa. The seasonings I doubled, and maybe even tripled the garlic powder (I never measure my garlic powder). I added a can of drained, rinsed black beans and a can of diced green chiles, then piled it all into some lightly roasted red bell pepper cups, topped with cheese, baked for 15 minutes and served it as stuffed peppers. I've also added ground meat on several occasions, it works wonderfully.

I haven't tried this yet but it sounds great.  I only gave it stars because the system wouldn't let me post this question without them.  I've tired quinoa before but just haven't liked it.  This seems like it could be different from the other recipes I've tried.  The thing is I want to try it with ground beef or chicken.  Anybody have any suggestions for how I can incorporate it into the recipe?  Should I cook the meat first and then add the quinoa or should I add the ground beef or chicken at the end?

This was just "ok" for us. We are big fans of spanish style rice and other foods, and this had a similar taste. Our issue was with it being pretty bland, even after doubling the spices. I felt the depth of flavors wasn't all the way there. I will possibly make this again, with a bunch of changes.

I love this recipe!!! I also like less salt, so I thought the seasonings were perfect. I followed the recipe, and loved it. I ate this as a stand alone dish, because quinoa is a complete protein, so this is a great dish for vegetarians. This is going into my monthly rotation, thanks!

As the recipe is, this turned out ok, but quite bland.  I threw some cheese on top and now it tastes better.

Next time, I will add diced fresh tomatoes, more chili powder & cumin powder, more fresh garlic, and fresh herbs (basil, oregano) to add flavour.

So good! I've made this recipe at least 5 times. The quinoa is always a little bit more watery than I'm used to, but the flavor makes up for it, though I always add more spices. 

I also add corn kernels and a bean, like garbanzos, to make this a full meal.

Great flavors for quinoa!  I added a bit of salt and extra chili powder.  I also substited red pepper for the green pepper since I didn't have.  The red pepper was ok, but it would better with the green called for.

This recipe turned out to be very yummy. I added cilantro, cabbage, a pinch of chili flakes and left over lobster meat. I like my food a bit saucy so i added a bit more tomato sauce. Everyone loved it!

This is a great alternative to spanish rice.  I added some frozen corn & black beans and a little salt and it was great.  I'd also recommend simmering UNcovered for the last 5 minutes.

This recipe is excellent! I had to cook it a little longer than 30 minutes to cook all of the water out, but it had great flavor. I added a can of corn and one of black beans, filled some green peppers with it and baked them in the oven, covered in cheese. I will definitely make this again!

This was great!! I made a few changes. I used a can of diced tomatoes, yellow peppers instead of green, 1 1/4 C of chicken broth, I doubled the cumin and garlic powder, and a few dashes of salt and ground pepper. I stuffed green peppers with the mixture, baked for 20 minutes and sprinkled with shredded cheese. Served with black beans.

The BEST quinoa recipe ever! I gave it four stars because I used chilli pepper flakes instead of chilli pepper, and that made it really spicy! I loved it. And, my meat eating husband loved it too! But use chilli pepper if you  don't love spicy.

Very good recipe, it was nice and spicy but it needed salt!  I also tossed some cooked shrimp in a tbsp of smoked paprika and added it to the quinoa at the end to warm it up and also a half a can of corn.  Served it in green peppers (that I boiled to soften).  Hubby loved it, definately will make this again!

I really liked this recipe.  I cooked a half batch and it was good for 3 single servings.  The first I ate as prepared and the other 2 servings I added in some extra lean ground beef and stuffed it in green peppers and baked in the oven.  It was delicious!

This was great. My kids loved it, and my husband, MR. Diehard meat & potatoes chowed it down. He said it kept him full which most vegetarian dishes do not. My kids did as suggested and used it to fill tortillas. This will be in regular rotation in our family! Thank you!

Very good.  Made with homemade refried black beans.  Will make again.  Quinoa is a healthy alternative to rice.  17% protein.

Wow! This was even better than I anticipated and I went in with high expectations! I substituted the tomato sauce with salsa and upped the spices a bit. I am certain that toasting the quinoa makes all the difference in this recipe. Will be adding it to my favorite collection of recipes! 5 stars and then some!

Very tasty! Because of what was on hand, replaced the tomato sauce with medium heat salsa,and used salsa for half a cup of the water as well. Doubled the spices. Even quinoa-resistant hubs found it to be good.  Thanks for sharing

Wow, this is definitely a keeper!  I have been trying to eat healthier which doesn't thrill my husband, but he couldn't stop raving about this. Thanks so much for posting this.

I added less liquid, and cooked it per my quinoa's package direction (only 15 minutes), and added a little more spice.  With the additions, it was very good!

I made this as a side for black bean enchiladas,  and was not very pleased. It didn't taste bad... it just didn't taste like anything at all. Will try again, but with more spices!

I liked this, but it was too plain as written. I added a lot more spice, and even then, I could have done more. Will make again with some tweaking.

A little bland at first so I added a little more chili powder, garlic powder and some seasoning salt.  Then a few drops of Mexican hot sauce, some chili peppers and  and it was very nice.

This was a great recipe but I agree with many other reviews that it needed more of the spices.  I doubled almost all the spices and I used a can of chopped tomatoes and less water to make it a bit quicker.  I also served in in the green pepper.  The whole family enjoyed it.

I have never had spanish rice before (I know I must have lived under a rock all these years lol) so I'm unable to say whether or not it is a great variation of that dish. However I can attest that my taste buds were thrilled with the final product and my beau who ate spanish rice growing up as a child thought it was delicious. I keep cooked quinoa in the fridge so that I can just pull it out whenever I need it for a recipe (I consume a lot of quinoa, so I prepare a fresh batch weekly) so I just used two cups from what I already had. I sauteed the onion, garlic and bell peppers in olive oil in a saucepan, added in the cooked quinoa and heated it for a few minutes, followed by 1/2 cup of vegetable broth, then I seasoned the mixture with smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, kosher salt, garlic powder and my homemade taco seasoning. After the mixture tasted like I desired I then added tomato sauce (I eyeballed it) just added enough to give it color and then I turned my heat to low and simmered for 30 minutes...it came out very flavorful.

Hubby and I thought this recipe was delicious! I did change a few things though. I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce and a can filled with water instead of the recommended water and sauce. the next time I make this I will take the advice of others and double up on the spices :)

my daughter made this recipe as a side dish and it was delicious. Even better the next day she used it in a wrap with a little sour cream, salsa, fresh spinach leaves and sliced pickled jalepenos.....it was a fabulous lunch sandwich.

After reading others' reviews, I added mild salsa instead of tomato sauce. That made this plenty spicey, and I'll be making this again.

A good recipe, but definitely needed more spice (increase the amount of cumin for sure) for my tastes and I think salsa would work better than tomato sauce. A nice way to cook quinoa, though, and you can make it a full meal by adding black beans. Excellent for lunch the next day, and I like the idea of putting them in peppers. Thanks for sharing!

Worked out great! We tried stuffing in green and red peppers, the red taste better - the flavors mix better. I cut each pepper in half, so they were more like boats and added some jack  in the last five minutes and upped the temp to 400.  Did not change anything with the original recipe, though.

I REALLY liked this.  However, I made a mistake that benefited me but not my wife.  Instead of using chili powder, I used Cayenne Red Pepper powder.  It made it much more spicy.  It was great for me, but my wife did not love it.  Great recipe though.  I need to replace the Cayenne next time.

Love this side dish! I've made it time and time again and it never fails. It can work even when the ratio of tomato to water isn't perfect. I've used Ragu pasta sauce with a few cut up fresh tomatoes instead of canned diced tomato before and it's turned out pretty much the same, just a tad sweeter. Make up for the sweetness by adding some extra cumin. Since quinoa is chock-ful of protien, I don't feel guilty eating potatoes alongside this dish

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and added turmeric to it. Turned out great!

I thought this recipe was really good! I added one can of black beans. I always sub water for broth of some short (veggie, beef, or chicken) for all my quinoa dishes. It just makes it a little more flavorful. It paired really well with the shrimp tacos I made. I'm anxious to see how it "reheats".

I had to omit the garlic due to an allergy, but otherwise followed this recipe.  I am not a fan, but I've never been a fan of Mexican rice either, so I suppose that's no real surprise.  If you like Mexican rice, you'll like this one; it is very similar.

This was awesome!  I did make some of the same changes as others, to make is less bland.  Used Rotel Tomatoes and diced tomatoes instead tomato sauce and also used chicken broth instead of water.  Turned out fantastic!  I will probably try adding ground turkey in the future, too.  Thank you!

I love this dish. It’s so flavorful that I don’t miss that it’s not rice. The shocker...even my plain joe hubby likes it. I’ve made it a few times. It’s a keeper!

Substituted a seeded jalapeño and three small peppers, yellow, red, orange for the green pepper.  Also spiced it up by using ancho chilie powder.  Used it to stuff 3 green peppers. Came out great.

What an excellent side dish for our Mexican fiesta dinner!  With a few personal changes (1/2 of a 14 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce;  substituted red bell pepper for the green; only 1/8 tsp. cumin;  only 2 cups of water, and addition of 1 tsp. kosher salt) it was perfect for us.  A definite winner for this family!

Made this tonight to have with soft tacos. Had to use a chunky medium salsa as I didn't have jalapenos. Left out the tomato sauce. Very delicious. I also used up some chicken stock I had in the fridge instead of the water, used 1 1/2 cups. Bumped up the spices as suggested by the author. Thanks for the recipe!

I rinsed the quinoa first and drained it before cooking it. It turned out really good, I would just try to add a little bit less water next time.

This is my first time making quinoa I love this recipe it turned out great. I did not have tomato sauce so I substituted a cup of sliced stewed tomatoes (diced them up first) I also added chicken boullion and cilantro, and left out the onion and garlic powder. Thank you for this recipe!

I would give it 5 stars, but the other reviewers are correct about the ratios.  Increased seasonings, add salt and decreased liquids. Substituted vegetable stock for water and try the tri-color Quinoa for a different  color and texture.

We LOVED this side dish addition to taco night. I added green chilies to replace the green pepper, half a can of black beans drained and rinsed, extra chili powder, cilantro, and served with cheddar cheese sprinkled on top. EXCELLENT and super easy dish! My family cleaned the bowl!

Flavor was great! I cut down a bit on the liquid and used one cup of water and 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth. I also added cilantro and some cooked chicken a the end and let it all simmer for a couple minutes. Will definitely make this one again!

Unfortunately, I discovered that I was out of cumin after already starting the recipe, but it was great anyway.  Took others advice and amped up the spices.  We used yellow and orange sweet peppers instead of green  and a diced red chili pepper.   We also added black beans. We made enough to use as a taco filling with one meal and as a side dish with another.

I followed everyone's advice and tripled the amount of spices and reduced the amount of broth to 2 1/4 cups. And since I didn't have tomato sauce, I used Bertolli pasta sauce. Came out great with the edits.

I LOVE this recipe. My own spanish rice recipe is very close to this, so I used it with quinoa instead of rice. I don't use onions or peppers (like kids, I am also very picky) and also prefer mild to spicy, so this is exactly what I needed to go with my Taco Ring recipe last night. Thanks for sharing!

This was so good!  Only changes I made were to 1/2 the chili powder (family can't handle anything too spicy) and use veggie broth in place of water.  I threw in about 1/2 cup of uncooked brown lentils and let it simmer 45 minutes.  Hubby had 3 servings.  The leftovers I had the next day were even better!

It was ok, but surprisingly bland.  I had to really up the spices to get anything out of this.  I'll probably add more green pepper, and maybe some black beans or corn to add more texture.  Otherwise, it was pretty mushy.

Our family didn't really enjoy this recipe, even after upping the spices.  It worked ok IN a burrito, but not as a separate side dish.
