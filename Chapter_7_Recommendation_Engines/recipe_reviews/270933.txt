Recipe creator here....my preferred mixer is grapefruit Jarritos, found in the Hispanic section of your grocery store or international market.  Squirt or Fresca will do if you can't find Jarritos.   You can easily make a smaller amount of habanero-infused tequila in a small jar. Leave the pepper(s) til you're happy with the amount of heat. Don't forget the heat factor will mellow once mixed with the rest of the ingredients.  Enjoy!
