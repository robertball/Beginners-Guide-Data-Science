Pretty good recipe, very tasty cookies, but 375 for 12-15 minutes is too hot and too long.
350 for 10-12 minutes,,

This recipe was great!  They were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  My family loves them!

I added coconut, substituted cinnamon chips, and omitted the nuts.  I will make them again soon!

These cookies were not good at all.  I am so sad that I wasted my chocolate chips on this recipe.  I think 375 was way too hot- after only 8 min. they were dark brown.  I really don't even think they have a very good flavor.

SOooo good. I made these for a physics class party and they dissappeared in no time! My family loves them. I omitted the nuts

Excellent! Exactly what I was looking for: crunchy yet chewy. Love the chocolate chips. I increased the cornflakes to 2 cups and decreased bake time to 9 minutes. The family loves these cookies!

It's good. 1/2'd the recipe.  I didn't use canola oil, only margarine.  Added a scoop of PB, but think it's better without.  A handful of coconut, and used Honey Almond Cluster cereal (and was told that I skimped on the choc. chips)... 11 minutes.  DO NOT Over-Bake!!! Crispy outside, soft inside. It's a great "surprise" cookie.

These cookies were so good! They had a great taste and a good texture. My husband is pretty picky with cookie texture and this cookie had a nice combo of chewy and crispy. Thanks!

I've never been very good at making cookies but these turned out fine. I was even happier that everyone liked them and they all got eaten.

I knew when the batter tasted good that the cookies would be great.  The crunch of the corn flakes really adds to the cookie.

Great cookies!  They are a crispy and chewy delight.  I made the following changes:  used Earth Balance instead of butter, Egg Beaters instead of eggs, omitted the walnuts, and used dark chocolate chips.  Lastly, I baked them at 350 for 12 minutes.  Perfect!  I will make these often.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  :-)

I only made these because I had too many Corn Flakes and nobody who wanted to eat them. The recipe turned out, and we ate them all, but who wants to eat corn flake cookies over say, chocolate chip??

These are great.  I used a cup of solid magarine instead of the half and half.  Used 1 tsp of Maple flavoring instead of vanilla and baked @ 350F for 14 mins on my stoneware bar pans.  

They came out perfect, crispy and chewy and oh so yummy.  Definitely a keeper

The first pan I baked with a dark cookie sheet and the cookies spread out, so I added more flour and used a shiny pan next and the cookies stayed fluffy.  I don't know if it was the pan or the flour but they were terrific.  Crunchy but soft and chewy.  I accidently left them out on the wire racks all night and they were still perfect in the morning.  I finally found the fluffy,crunch, soft cookie I have been looking for.  Thank you!!!

Nice standard cookie.  I think I may have added too much backing powder though because they ended up closer resembling muffins than cookies.  I also think that adding some coca power to the mix would make a nice chocolately version.  I sprinkled some on one of them in the tin and it ended up being my favorite.

I agree with EJ Will.  I thought these cookies were terrible.  My husband said he would probably eat them.  Then again, he eats anything!  This is probably the first recipe from Allrecipes that I have been truly disappointed in!

So i looked through my pantry an seen the graham crackers lol so i decided to add a cup of crushed graham crackers in place of the oats It worked out quiet well lol pretty darn good cookie! You get a nice crunch from the corn flakes but yet nice an chewy im glad now i ran out of oats i will make these again !! Also I baked these at 350 for about 13 min.

Very nice! The right proportion of crunch and chewiness. I used muesli instead of oats and it worked very nicely.

I used stevia instead of white sugar and unbleached whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Also used steel cut oats. A healthier version! They're great though, and I followed what others mentioned- 350 for about 10-12 minutes and they were perfect. I don't have a wire rack so I just flipped them over once I took them out of the oven.

Really yummy, our whole family couldn't stop eating them. Amazing crunchy yet chewy texture. I got 40 cookies out of one batch so halfing it was not a bad idea though.
