It tastes much better with canned coconut milk, much more coconut flavor.  Also it works best with pre-frozen pineapple, even if they were originally in a can, drain them, throw them in the freezer overnight and make the next day. This wasn't terrible as is, but canned coconut milk tastes much more like coconut.

I thought this would be a good option for those in my family who canâ€™t do dairy.  I made two versions, one as read and one with no alcohol, using a banana for the flavor, for minors.  They were both quite underwhelming.  I wound up adding sugar to them.

Turned out great. Had to use about 4 tablespoons of coconut milk but not a problem...had to buy a quart any way. Beware  of brain freeze.
