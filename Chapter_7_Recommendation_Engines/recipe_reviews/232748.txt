Toasted the seeds in a dry saute pan on the stove top because it's easier for me to watch their browning that way.  Considering the price of tahini at the store, I thought it was fair to make it instead (Buying the seeds in bulk or in bags from the health food store is much more cost effective than buying the little jars from the spice section!) Not only that, it probably took me as long to make this as it does to stir the store-bought container when the oil has separated, lol! I feel it needed a pinch of salt to brighten the sesame flavor.  I made just enough tahini for making a garbanzo can's worth of hummus (quartered this recipe).  Look forward to making that tomorrow!

This is so simple.  I found some roasted sesame seeds, which saved all that process.  About 3 minutes in the food processor, and I was done.  I do recommend pulsing it at first, and with a rubber spatula, scooping up from the bottom to incorporate all the seeds, then just let the processor run for a couple more minutes.  I don't understand why people had so much trouble with it!  Start with the minimum amount of oil, but if it's too thick, just add a bit more until it gets to the consistency you want.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I ended up using pre-roasted sesame seeds from the asian food aisle and blended it up into a paste following the instructions above. The sesame seeds costed about $3.50 for almost a cup's worth of roasted sesame seeds. I used this tahini and Ina Garten's hummus recipe and it turned out great!

I wanted to make my own tahini to reduce sodium.  This was very easy and it tasted great!  I used it to make a low sodium hummus that also turned out great.  Thanks!

I used this to make the "Real Hummus" recipe on AR.  This was easy to make.  I needed to add extra olive oil for it to blend properly.  Also, I used black and white sesame seeds which gave it a darker color than the one on the recipe's main page.

Very easy and satisfying. I need to be a bit more vigilant while the seeds are toasting next time (they got a tad brown). The hummus I made is delicious though!

It did take a while in our food processor, but it is Awesome and fresh! The next time I used the dry saute  pan on the stove.  Stirred constantly, it took about three minutes, just until some started to pop.  It may have needed a little less EVOO.  Once again, delicious and fresh!

Taste is excellent, just like it should be.   Don't worry if it's not perfectly smooth if you're  going to use it to make hummus, it'll smooth out there. If you do want a more smooth tahini, add water SLOWLY.

Mine's way darker than the other photos. Thought I might have over toasted the seeds, but it doesn't taste burnt. Actually quite flavorful...

I  couldn't find tahini in the store so I searched online and found this. Fortunately I had just bought a bag of sesame seeds from Penzeys. Very easy to make.

I made this because it makes a small amount. Many recipes are scaled to make much larger quantities. I toasted my own sesame seeds in a dry pan, as another person recommended, and as long as you watch them, it works wonderfully. Very aromatic. Just keep pulsing the seeds until they become smooth with the oil. Tasty!

I made this in my food processor using the sharp metal blade.  Added a dash of pink Himalayan salt to bring out the flavor.  It's absolutely wonderful and stores beautifully in a glass jar in the fridge.  Just stir when you need to use it in making hummus.  Much cheaper than store-bought tahini.  Thank you for this recipe!

This is a great tahini recipe!  I do not use tahini often and it is expensive to purchase. I used this in the spicy pumpkin hummus and the tahini salad dressing! Tasted great in both recipes! I will never buy tahini again!!

This is bitter, but fills the need for tahini in hummus. Can't find tahini here in my part if Tenneessee. It does take a while to blend it up. I made a half of this recipe (1/2 cup of sesame seeds) but ended up using almost a 1/4 cup of oil to get it to blend up to the right consistency. Thanks for helping me to make the black bean hummus from AR. I really needed to use up done black beans! Thanks again! :)

The recipe was very good, but I had one major pain point.  It called for putting the toasted sesame seeds and olive oil in a blender.  I have a nice Kitchenaid blender, but when I put the ingredients in and turned it on, the seeds just splattered against the sides of the container and were nowhere near the blade, which spun merrily in the air.  I had a hunch that would happen, but followed the recipe anyway.

I recovered by carefully scraping all the seeds and oil into my mini food processor (also a Kitchenaid).  That worked fine.  I still had some splatter, which required scraping down the sides several times, but the blade was always in contact with at least some of the seeds, which turned to a paste after a few minutes.

I made 3/4 of the recipe (3/4 cup seeds, 3 T olive oil), which yielded almost exactly 1/2 cup of tahini, which is what my hummus recipe calls for.  The resulting hummus was possibly my best hummus ever, owing to the freshly toasted seeds.

The sesame seeds cost me $10.99 a pound, at the bulk spices section of the meat department of my local grocery.  That's quite a bit more than jars of prepared tahini (about $7.99 locally for a pound jar), so I'm going to be on the lookout for cheaper sesame seeds - maybe at one of the many local middle-eastern markets.

This was ridiculously easy to make. Just make sure you buy bulk sesame seeds; buying lots of little shakers of them would get really expensive fast if you make this a lot.

Since having  trouble finding tahini in my local store I decided to look up how to make it my self and came across this recipe.  I am very thankful for it and have made a big batch. Very easy and tasty.

Super easy to do and I like the fact that by making it yourself you can ensure that it is gluten free, unlike the store bought tahini.

I could have toasted the sesame seeds a little longer. It was a little thick. Might add a little more oil next time. But it worked great in my hummus.

just what i was looking for.  always have sesame seeds but don't like to keep tahini around since it goes rancid before I have a chance to use it.

Not sure if it was my food processor or the sesame seeds but it took nearly 30 minutes for the olive oil and sesame seeds to blend together.  I did roast them prior to processing.  In the end it was all good and the humus deliscious.  I will definitely do this again.

I have no idea what I am doing wrong, but I have tried to blend them in a Ninja, a food processor, and using an immersion blender. Nothing works.

If your kids don't like the thick taste of the tahini spread, add 1-2 tablespoon of honey to make it has a bit of sweetness. I won't be buying anymore tahini from store anymore!

I bought toasted seeds. Had to add over 1/2 cup olive oil, 1cup of water and about a half of a cup of lemon juice. My super fancy blender kept seizing up. By the time I was done I had a burnt seed soup. Will try again buying regular seeds.
