EXCELLENT flavor! Fast supper technique: Put up broth to boil, (I used chicken rather than vegetable) peel the sweet potatoes, chunk them up into the broth, chunk up the onion and add to the broth. Substitution for curry paste and fresh ginger: 1 t chili powder, 1 t cumin, 1 t ginger, and 1 T curry powder. Once the potatoes were cooked, puree in the blender with the lemon juice and then pour back into pan and add the coconut milk, chopped cilantro & sesame oil. I skipped the salt. VERY tasty and quick! Garnished with a seasoned sour cream/yogurt blend and we can hardly wait to have leftovers tomorrow night!

Exceptional! Will make it again and again. Substituted curry paste with 1 t-spoon of cumin, 1t curry, 1t ginger, 1t chili.) Also pureed one small bunch of cilantro with 1/2 a lemon worth of lemon juice and added a teaspoon of the mixture to each plate. The green cilantro mass against the red soup base looked very pretty!

Really good.  A great way to use the leftover sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that my boyfriend wasn't wild about the soup. 

I made the following changes to make the soup healthier and more authentic:
1. Used lite coconut milk from Trader Joe's instead of regular coconut milk to cut down on the calorie and fat content
2. I added more curry paste than the recipe called for- about 1 1/2 table spoons. I really like Thai curry flavor and I'm used to really strong Thai curries from restaurants.
3. Substituted fish sauce for the salt in the recipe and I added it while the soup was simmering 
4. I cooked it for way longer than the original recipe calls for.  After I added the sweet potatoes I simmered the soup for about a half hour. 
5. Here's the big thing.  The soup tasted bland, but I put 3/4ths of the batch into the blender and it made the soup go from ok to great.  It made all the flavor from the sweet potatoes come out. 
6. I added the cilantro, but not the sesame oil.  The soup really didn't need the extra flavor.

SLOW COOKER OPTION. Put all but coconut milk into slow cooker. Be sure to peel and dice sweet potatoes. Turn on low heat for 7 hours. Process through blender, put back in cooker. Add coconut milk and garnishes (diced red peppers, cilantro, options are endless...) serve with home made bread. Tastes even better when curry marries overnight.

i love this recipe!  I have made it twice now.  I also add vegetables with the onions so that the soup is more hearty with cubed tofu before adding the liquid.  Its great.   i never have the curry paste, so instead i use chilis, curry powder, cumin and coriander powders.

Delicious and so easy and fast.  I prefer this type of soup creamy so I peeled and cubed the sweet potatos then boiled them (faster than baking) I them added the water from boiling to my vegetable broth for more sweet potato flavour and blended.  Served with a tbsp of sour cream with diced cilantro whipped in.

I LOVED this. Totally authentic and totally thai. I boiled my sweet potato's and also added a 1 can of sweet potato's. I used 2 limes and some lemon juice. I also added more red curry paste.  I did not puree this like some had suggested, and I don't find it necessary either.  I would think that leaving it as is gives it a better texture. I also added cooked shrimp and it went perfectly. The toasted sesame oil was a great garnish, it really added a warmth to the dish. Don't forget to top it off with the cilantro... DELISH!!

This is the BEST soup I have ever made! I've been trying some coconut curry recipes on this site, and this is exactly what I was looking for. Restaurant quality. I added a handful of mushroom slices. Next time, I'll add more. 

I just made this soup a second time and I puried it after it was done. This time I didn't add mushrooms. Very good. drinkable.

I omitted the salt and sesame oil and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also peel, diced, and boiled the sweet taters until tender rather than baking them. This is very flavorful and has a nice spicy kick (depending on the heat of your curry paste). I'll definitely make this one again.

My husband and I love this soup! I made it lots of times, it's so easy, but tastes sooo good and different! The combination of the sweet potato, the coconut and the spicy curry is awesome. It's a winner to show off to friends and family. The fresh cilantro is a must. I also add mushrooms

Wonderful! I made it with canned pumpkin b/c I was out of sweet potato. We both loved it! Easy and delicious. A great way to get more sweet potato (or pumpkin!) in your diet, too.

I LOVED this soup!  I kept craving it the next day and couldn't wait to have it again.  I cooked the peeled sweet potatoes directly in the broth/coconut milk.  Then I mashed them a little with a potato masher to make a chunky-yet-creamy soup.  I loved the combination of coconut, sweet potato, and ginger flavors.  My husband thought the ginger was overpowering, but this is probably because I minced the ginger rather than slicing it, so we kept biting into the ginger with every spoonful.  Next time, I'll be a good girl and slice the ginger.

This was not our favourite sweet potato soup. I followed the recipe exactly as written. We love thai food, but were disappointed by the flavour of this soup.

We love this soup so much, we've gone through two batches in the past 5 days!  It's wonderful made exactly to recipe, and we loved it even more with these very minor alterations:  - Used powdered coconut milk (reconstituted with water, according to box directions).  It's cheaper and lower fat than canned. - Didn't care for the sesame oil the first time around so omitted it for batch #2.  Much better.  (I think the flavor of sesame oil, even just a drop, doesn't pair well with the coconut, which I really adore.) - Nuked the sweet potatoes and mashed them before adding them to the soup.  Faster/easier. - Pureed the whole shebang (in both batches).  Makes a beautifully smooth and creamy finished product.    Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It's a hit in our house, and we're serving it to company next weekend!

Flavor of this soup was well beyond expectations. Made it as written except for using beef broth but nothing needs to be changed to make this a winning soup. The nutty flavor of drizzled sesame oil gave this an interesting twist, and we also experimented with drizzling peanut sauce on hand which could create a nice variation. Other reviewers said they pureed their soup, and I imagine that being very good. This would pair nicely with a fish/seafood main dish. A definite make again.

I made this soup for the first time and it was delicious! I made a few changes. Instead of using lemon juice, I used lime (I feel this goes well with curries). I also added sesame oil while cooking which added more depth. I blended all of the veggies with the stock with a hand blender before adding the cocnut milk. I also added cilantro during the last few minutes of cooking and then removed it to add extra "thai" flavour. I will be making this again for sure! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I made this weight watcher friendly by using butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes and light coconut milk.  I thought it was fabulously, wonderfully delicious!!!!  It tasted sinfully rich and was only 1 point per cup!  I used an immersion blender to blend all the ingredients into a velvety soup.  If you don't have an immersion blender and do a lot of soups get one - they are wonderful!

I really enjoyed the soup and was pleasantly surprised with the taste.  There were a few things I omitted bc I didn't have it or chose not to use it; cilantro, sesame oil and substitute vegetable broth and used chicken broth.  I'll definitely have this soup again; however, I'll take the advice of another reviewer and be sure to shave the "hairs" from the fresh ginger or even use ginger paste to give that flavor that only it has.  I wasn't sure how the ginger would be being that it was still in the soup, but it actually had a mellow flavor and wasn't as pungent as I thought it'd be.  Oh yeah, i used my last 2 tbsp of lemon juice so the third was lime bc i like how lime marries with Asian dishes.  Great recipe in spite of the subtle changes I made..

Great recipe made even better with a little tweaking. I added some galangal root and a few kaffir lime leaves while it simmered-- that really added a lot of depth and flavor. Next time I will use lime juice instead of lemon for a more authentic Thai flavor. Would also be great with some shrimp or crab stirred in at the end.

Excellent recipe, just needs a bit of tweaking.  Use lime instead of lemon, fish sauce instead of salt.  Puree so you don't get chunks of ginger in your mouth.  Tastes fabulous!

Excellent flavor!  Very similar to a curry sauce, but with potato base.  I did not have curry paste, so as others have recommended I substituted 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tbsp curry powder.  I love ginger so the fresh ginger is a MUST.  You can really taste the difference.  I cooked my potatoes in the broth and my ginger and onion in a separate pan. I added the spices to the onion and ginger and then combined into the broth when the potatoes were tender.  Puree in blender and WA-LA! Puree 1 bunch of cilantro with 1/4 cup lime juice and use as a topping.  Or just sprinkle with cilantro and a lime wedge.

Made my own vegetable broth with what I had in the refrigerator and instead of curry paste, I added 1 tsp Chili powder, 1 tsp Cumin, and 1 tsp Curry powder as suggested by another reviewer.  I also pureed the soup in a blender, as the last step before adding sesame oil and cilantro.  Very creamy and delicious!

Everyone loved this soup. The sesame oil and cilantro was just the finishing touch necessary to top it off. It's definitely good without it, but you don't know what you're missing if you don't add it. Super easy to prepare. I too put it in the blender at the end and it worked perfectly. Will be a permanent fixture in my comfort foods directory.

VERY good recipe.  I got kudos from all of my family members because of this recipe.  
Modifications: 
1. I didn't have red curry paste, so I just added some red pepper flakes to taste. 
2. I didn't have vegetable broth handy, so I pureed some of the sweet potatoes with a bit of water and some buillon.  I excluded the salt from the recipe because there is plenty of salt in buillon.  
3. I didn't use sesame oil... don't like it.
4. I grated up some ginger so that it would match the consistency of the soup. (not sliced like the recipe says.)

Yumm!!  I love this soup!  I didn't add the lemon juice yet, I need to get some from the store but even without it, this is a 5 star recipe!  I really recommend buying the red curry paste-  Thai Kitchen brand-  it seems expensive for such a little jar, but once you use it in one recipe you will realize it is magic and find tons of other uses for it!  Powdered spices can't compare!  Yum yum I might eat the whole pot since my husband swears he hates sweet potatoes, but I have a feeling he is going to convert when he smells this!  p.s. look for lite coconut milk, it's worth saving those calories!

Wow. This soup is amazing. If you can please use the fresh ginger and red curry paste; I believe they make this dish. The only ingred. I changed was chicken broth. I microwaved the sweet potatoes and they peeled easily. After soup was done I took about 3/4 of it and blended it in blender. This left just a few pieces for texture but mostly a beautful creamy red soup. Thanks Lynn!

I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with a disappointing vat of bland unpleasant liquid. I ended up creaming it and adding a lot of other ingredients to make it edible. Not worth the effort.

Amazing recipe. I also added a small can of creamed corn and did as suggested by some and blended at least halp of the sweet potato.

I didn't have any cilantro but this will still great.  I used coconut cream because it's more flavorful, and trust me, this is quite the satisfying soup.  Very hearty!

We just had this for dinner tonight without altering the recipe at all.  It was absolutely delicious just as it is!  Some people enjoy changing things around just because they can, but I say why mess with perfection?

De-lish. I used half sweet potato and half pumpkin and it seemed to work perfectly well! I was suspicious about the lemon juice and added it very slowly, tasting as I went - but wow! It does work. Not sure about the sesame oil - it was maybe one flavour too much.

Absolutely delicious, although I didn't follow the recipe exactly.     I used less coconut to keep it a bit healthier, used extra curry paste, added about a teaspoon of garlic to the onions, used fish sauce instead of salt, use the juice of one lime instead of the lemon juice, and didn't add the cilantro or sesame oil. I simmered the sweet potato in the broth for several hours making it a bit thicker, but still with hunks of sweet potato. Will definitely make again.

This soup is delicious. I followed another reviewer's tips and used fish sauce and lime juice.  I puréed it in the blender after it had cooled a bit and did it in batches.  The soup has a beautiful colour and flavour when it's done. Definitely use fresh ginger.

What a lovely soup! It's also incredibly easy. The only tweaks I made were: microwaving the sweet potatoes (about 10 minutes for 2); adding some cumin seed to toast after the onions were soft; and omitting the sesame oil - I actually tried it, tasted it, then hurriedly skimmed it off - it makes what is otherwise a light, bright soup too heavy and musty for my taste. I am thrilled with this recipe and will use it again and again. Thanks so much!

This soup is great although I thought the sesame oil overwhelmed the soup, but I love thai curry flavor.  I blended the soup with about 2/3 of the sweet potatoes and then added the remaining chopped up sweet potatoes for a little texture.

delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was amazing.  I had one bowl, went back for a second and had to stop myself from a third!  The only thing I did differently was micro'd the potato to save on time/energy.

This was good, but I didn't find it very good thus the 3 star rating.  I felt like it was missing something, and additional curry did not make up for that.

I LOVE this soup! Substituted chicken broth for veggie, added some chunked red bell pepper in with onions/ginger, used Thai Kitchen red curry paste, and accidentally grabbed a yam instead of a sweet potato hehe.  It turned out great, though.  I'll make this again and again.

Not bad. A bit too sweet and coconutty for my taste though. One of my sons loved it and the other one did not care for it at all. I would use evaporated milk next time instead of the coconut milk.

So good!  I've just started a paleo diet and this is easily adjusted to paleo (used olive oil not veg. oil).  I used chicken broth in place of veg., lime juice instead of lemon, skipped ginger and cilantro and also added some Cajun seasoning. My husband loved it even without meat.

I followed the recipe and thought it had amazing flavor. Instead of leaving the sweet potato cubed, while in the soup I mashed it. After the soup sat for about 3 to 5 minutes the consistency was thicker. I agree that you must get the sesame oil and cilantro.

Great soup.  I made the soup quicker and easier by peeling/dicing the potatoes and adding them to the broth to boil until tender.  I threw in some onions to boil too.  I then added seasonings, coconut milk and served.  YUMMY!  Definitely somthing different to bring to the dinner table.  My kids liked it too!

I've made this a few times now varying it a little and found I prefer the original recipe and putting half in the blender so it's thicker but still chunky.  This has become a new favorite.

What a great and easy soup!  I used the super fast method and substitution for curry paste and fresh ginger shared by PAROGIRL.  I left some of the skin on the sweet potato and only used my potato masher, did not put in blender as I like a bit of texture.  Will for sure make this again.

I modified yet I am sure the original recipe will taste good. i had some pumpkin and carrots lying around, so I used those. I realized late that I was out of curry paste so I ended up puyiing Indian Masalas like turmeric, cayene, coriander powder and Garam Masala. Turned out well!

My husband and I loved this soup!  The fresh cilantro is a must.  Alterations I made were: -I added mushrooms and corn while cooking the onions/ginger/curry paste -I also added about 1 cup of COOKED brown rice to make it more hearty.   -I added some chili flakes to turn up the heat since my red curry paste wasn't that spicy.  After adding the rice, we were able to eat the soup and a piece of toast as a great meal!  Thanks for the recipe Lynn!!

I made this several weeks ago and am making it again!  It is very addictive!  Because I made so much the first time, I froze it in individual containers to take to work.  I used the blender to make it very creamy. I did not put the cilantro in before freezing, just added it when I reheated.  I was apprehensive about freezing this, but it was fantastic and still creamy, not grainy.

This was great. I actually forgot to add the oil and lemon and it was still wonderful - and rather healthy, since I used lite coconut milk. I just rough chopped the onions and ginger, scooped out the cooked potato, and pureed the whole finished product in my food processer. YUM.

WOW!!! My husband doesn't even like sweet potatos and he thought it was pretty great. I followed some of the other reviwers suggestions and pureed it at the end and used lime jouce and soy sauce instead of fish sauce to make it vegan.

I don't know what I did wrong but this was definitely lacking.  The sweet potato did not add to the dish at all and I would leave it out all together next time.  I also added shrimp and scallops. I used a combo of green and red curry paste so it wasn't too hot for others to eat but I also added sriachi sauce and did not get that hot...I added more to my own bowl.  I served over sticky rice.

I made this recipe with chicken brother and without sesame oil (I couldn't justify $8 for a tablespoon of something I'd never use again). This was definitely not the kind of food I would eat, it was a very unique taste.   However, the other person I made this dish for LOVED it. She couldn't stop raving about it and due to the fact I didn't care that much for its taste, insisted she take home the leftovers (and the curry paste)!   This was definitely a unique recipe and aside from all the prep work (chopping up vegetables), insanely easy to make. Thanks for posting it!

BAM! Great recipe!  -As others did, I did not pre cook the sweet potatoes... I just added them to the broth and let them cook.  I also added about a cup of left over rice to the mix.  I didn't have veggie broth, so I used chicken broth.  I also added chicken to this soup.  I will for sure be making this again!

OK, so I didn't have the sesame oil the ginger or the coconut milk.. but I did have coconut cream, madras curry paste and the other ingredients, like others I boiled the sweet potatoes and onion, although I can see the flavor of roast sweet potato would come throw. o n a plus side you can reserve the water for the stock

It does have quite a bite to it and a lot of people will find it a bit too hot.  Peeling and cutting the sweet potato into bite sized pieces and roasting in a bit of olive oil and salt/pepper saves time and mess.  Also for those who like ginger but not slices of it could use the grated ginger you can buy in the stores.  Then the flavor is there but not in slice formed.  I also roasted a bit more potato and puree'd it with some of the broth to slightly thicken up the soup.

So, so, so good!!!I used chicken broth, as I didn't have veggie broth.  I also added red lentils to the mixture and simmered until they were soft.  I didn't bother with the cilantro and seseme oil, and the soup was still very tasty.  The lemon juice really kicks up the flavour of the soup.  The only problem I have is that the soup isn't kid friendly.  My boys wouldn't even try it.

This was very unusual for my taste.  I wasn't sure if I liked it until about the 4th spoonful.  Then, I finally felt the heat in the back of my mouth.  Then, it made me want to keep eating it.  It's always nice to try new things.

This was pretty amazing! I used 'Taste of India'- Hot Curry Paste and some minced garlic as well. I also used diced bell peppers and than blended it all together. Then i dropped in some canned straw mushrooms. After i poured the soup into serving bowls I sprinkled the top with some diced bell peppers and a little cilantro.

This was full of flavor and easy to make. You can also blend it in a food processor if you prefer a creamier soup. I recommend more ginger!

This recipe is amazing. I made it for an Autumn equinox appetizer soup. It was completely devoured. Next time I would add some whole straw mushrooms.

weird. It was very spicy with the 1 Tbsp of red curry paste, and I like spicy food. I blended the cooked onions and sweet potatoes. I didn't love the texture, but the flavor was good. It just didn't seem like a soup.
Thus, the next day, we cooked some chicken and rice and had the soup as a sauce on top, instead. Next time I would just omit the broth and make it a true curry, and I'd keep the veggies whole.

Very good soup.  I had no cilantro or sesame oil but loved it notheless.  I did puree the soup at the end too and only added 2 cups of broth so it was thicker.

I'm a newbie, and forgot to shave off the hairy outside of the ginger root, make sure you do that!! Also, my sweet potatoes must have been small since one of them completely exploded all over my oven after only 25 minutes.  I salvaged the other one and still ate the soup, which was good but not fantastic.

This is a very tasty soup!  I didn't have ginger root so substituted with 1 T of ginger powder.  Also only had 1 C of vegetable broth so I added 2 cups of water and 3 bullion cubes.  Even my baby loves it, will definitely save this and make it again!

Super yummy with an asian flare!  I used the mae ploy red curry paste with an additional 1/2 serving.  It made it a bitmore spicey.   I put a little too much fresh ginger...I will pay more attention to detail next time.

Love this soup!  Just finished making and I may just eat the whole pot before dinner.  I did make a few changes.  Added carrots and celery with the onion.  Also used ground cumin, ground ginger, turmeric and paprika.  Also added lemon zest and lemon juice.  And used chicken broth instead of veggie broth because that's what I had.  It's so good.

very good.  I used cubes of butternut squash instead of sweet potato because it's what I had on hand and it's delish.  I also used fish sauce instead of the salt.  The crazy thing is that you don't taste the sweet potatoes (or squash) at all - it just tastes like a thai dish.  Yummy!

Maybe I need to get accustomed to the taste, but I did not like this at all.  Curry and sweet potato, not for me.  btw I followed the recipe except for the curry paste, used reviewer suggestions of using curry powder and other seasonings.  Maybe that had a lot to do with the taste.  Will not try again, though.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!!! I love coconut milk, sweet potatoes, and curry, so there was really no way I could dislike this recipe! I omitted the cilantro and sesame oil - really wasn't needed. I used a mix of white-flesh sweet potatoes and yams (what I had on hand), and added 1 tsp of cumin, chili powder, and cayanne (for that extra kick.) Ate with warm naan bread. Seriously amazing - my boyfriend loved it as well!!!

fantastic flavor and super quick.  this is definitely a keeper.  i grated the ginger and sauteed it, along with the onions, in coconut oil.  followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  tossed in some shitake mushrooms that i didn't want to go bad.  super yummy!!  and vegan!

Absolutely wonderful. My 2 tweaks: The 1T sesame oil was a bit much -- I'd probably just do 1tsp next time. I added 2 cloves of garlic. Love, love, love this recipe!

Not all that good. I belded mine with a hand mixer and it reminded me too much of baby food afterwards. My boyfriend didn't like it at all and we are both big fans of red curry and yams seperately. He said "you shouldn't have added carrots", which i didn't.

Excellent flavour. To save on time, I microwaved the sweet potato instead of baking it.  Next time I would consider blending some of the potato so that it's not only chunks. Instead of doing the onion in vegetable oil and then adding more oil later, I sautéed the onion in the sesame oil.  I was out of ginger so I used ginger powder instead, which worked fine. I might use chicken broth and add a bit of chicken next time I make this.

This was GREAT! I was looking of new ways of cooking sweet potatos and this is a great one.   Here are my changes:  -I added more curry paste, 2 garlic cloves, some cayenne pepper and shrimps.   -I replaced the salt by nuoc nam (fish sauce) and used chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth.  -I mashed the roasted sweet potatos before adding them to the soup.   Very flavourful. Thank you!

While this recipe was extremely flavorful, I am only giving it 3 stars because the flavor was not particularly appealing to me. My husband tasted it and was surprised by the "intense" coconut flavor while I felt that the lemon and ginger were overpowering. I felt that there were too many strong conflicting flavors. I followed the advise on someone else's comment and pureed the sweet potatoes, a step I regretted as it turned the soup into a very very liquidy substance.  I allowed it to simmer for about 2 hours which changed the soup into a more desirable consistency. I also added an extra teaspoon of curry paste because we like spice, which even that extra curry did not make it much spicier. It was beautiful with the sesame oil and cilantro in it when served! And I also did not have vegetable broth on hand and thus used chicken broth, which we could not taste in the soup so I don't think it made much of a difference. While my husband and I both ate the soup for dinner, we will not be making this soup again.

This was really good and I will definitely make it again!  It tastes even better as leftovers because the sweet potatoes have a chance to soak in the spices more.  Just be sure your sweet potatoes cook all the way through.  Part of one potato ended up a little crunchy, so I did my best to only put the soft pieces in the soup.

This soup is great, but only if you BLEND IT. Without blending it, you end up with bland pieces of sweet potato and chunks of ginger. Blending the soup makes a wonderful creamy soup with a great mix of flavors. I've made this with vegetable broth and with chicken broth and both work fine, but I liked the vegetable broth better.

OMG, this was so good!  What a great blend of flavors.  I pureed the soup at the end and really liked the result.  Didn't have any sesame oil but we did add some cilantro which gave it a nice tang.  But it's good without too.  Oh, and didn't add salt either.  Yum, yum, yum!

Very tasty soup!   I followed other reviewer's suggestions and pureed the soup when it was done.  Makes great leftovers too, just add some extra broth to thin the soup.

YUMMY! To make it quicker and easier I boiled 4 cups of chicken stock with 2 sweet pots and 1 sweet onion, chunked up, and the sliced ginger. Once the veggies were soft, I used an immersion blender and pureed until creamy. Then added the coconut milk, red curry, salt (I used a little less than 1 tsp) and about 1/4 tsp of cayenne 'cause I like it spicy. SUPER GOOD.

This soup was ok. However, you definitely don't taste the sweet potato with all the spices, which is what I was hoping for.  Probably won't make it again.

What a hit! This soup smelled so good while it was simmering, my husband wanted to dive right in the pot! I used low-fat coconut milk, grated the ginger on a Microplane instead of slicing it, and used a box of chicken broth instead of veggie broth. I used an immersion blender to halfway puree it, but also left some pieces of potato for a nice texture. Thanks for the recipe---we all loved it!

Great.  I made for Thanksgiving 2009.  Huge hit, except for Mom who doesn't like spicy.  I made about 3 hours early, and placed in crock pot on warm until time for Thanksgiving dinner, stirring occasionally.  Added cilantro at last minute.  Huge hit.

This was *fantastic*!! I will definitely be making this again. Next time I'll try adding some extra firm tofu.  I peeled and chopped the potatoes before roasting to get some nice color and roasted flavor. I tossed them in a very small amount of vegetable oil to prevent sticking/burning. I also grated the ginger as I didn't want to bite into a chunk of ginger.  I didn't need the whole teaspoon of salt, I only added about 1/2 teaspoon and it was plenty. And like the other reviewers, I don't think it needs the sesame oil. But the freshness of the cilantro was a nice finish.

This was fabulous!  I used leftover sweet potatos and added a bit of cayenne pepper at the end to give it just a tad more kick.  Also used more curry than called for.  Great fall "warm me up" soup.

I would give 10 stars if possible.  This is SO GOOD and easy.  Our one change was to use a hand blender to puree the soup in the pot after adding the sweet potatoes, lemon juice and salt because we prefer it that way.  The sesame oil and cilantro garnshes are a must. Makes 4 large bowls of soup.

This soup was amazing!   I didn't add the sesame oil; but I'll try that the next time.  I agree with the other reviewer; add some crusty bread to serve with the soup.   This can be a meal with bread and a salad.  DELICIOUS!

I also used the boiling method because I wanted to speed up this process. I pureed the soup with the coconut milk in the blender. The end result was creamy and had a great flavor too! Fresh cilantro is a must! This reminds me of my favorite soup from a Thai restaurant.

Very nice soup, I only changed a few things...I used organic cold pressed coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, because it is healthier & also smells wonderful! I also put in a touch of honey and some toasted shredded coconut on top for garnish. Terrific soup thanks!

this soup is perfect! i didn't change a thing. i tried it before adding the sesame oil, it definitely makes a difference. i put it in bowls then added a drizzle on top. im beginning to like cilantro, so i chopped that real small and sprinkled it in each bowl. cant wait to eat more tomorrow!

This was my first try of this soup and it came out great. I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth but and my boyfriend and sister who both love Thai food thought it tasted very authentic and delicious.

I agree with the majority that this is 5 star.  I did use lime juice, and fish sauce as recommended by another reviewer. I only had curry powder so used it and added chili garlic sauce for a little heat. Loved it.

My family LOVES this soup. It is easy to fix and is high in fiber. I used sesame oil instead of veg oil to cook the onions and I skipped the sesame oil drizzle. I also put it in a blender to make a smooth soup. It is so tasty! All the flavors blend together beautifully. This is an excellent choice to serve to company as a first course.

This soup turned out great when I made it.  The flavors combined well, and didn't overpower the sweet potato, which still came through.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, but was out of sesame oil, so didn't do the garnish.  I did use a stick blender to puree the soup after all the ingredients had simmered together for about 15 mins.  I think that was a very necessary step.

This soup is AMAZING!  I let it simmer all afternoon b/c I had the time.  I also used a submergable blender at the end.  I did add some extra curry paste, and I used powdered ginger.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.  Also, although the sesame oil made the soup look great, I don't know that it was necessary.

This has a great flavour BUT as a soup it is a no.no for me but as a curry sauce it is great.  I used 1 kilo of potatoes and coconut cream I then added 15 oz water and the stock and the result was restaurant quality Korma Curry, I sometimes use prawns either raw or cooked or marinated chicken in tandori powder and yoghurt overnight than grill and put together with the sauce.  Because it makes so much I usually freeze in takeaway containers enough for each meal this way it is an extra quick meal if you use cooked frozen prawns, a meal in a few minutes. Almost forgot I then put the whole lot into a blender to make a smooth sauce.

Delicious. I pureed the whole thing instead of leaving the sweet potato in chunks, because my kids like smooth soups.  A definite keeper.

By far the best soup I've made! Followed the recipe exactly. Exceptional flavor, and different - our guests raved over this one. The curry paste adds a lot of depth to the overall flavor. I will definitely make this one over and over again.

I made this soup and my husband gave it a 10!  I added 1 tbsp garlic chili paste, and substituted basil for cilantro.  I also added sliced carrots about an hour before I served it.  Soup simmered for about 3 hours before serving...was very spicy.  To reduce heat cut back on garlic chili paste.  Served with nice Zinfandel YUMMMMMMM

This is a 4-star recipe as written, but with a few tweaks...it was the best soup I'd had in a while! I boiled the potatoes, onion, and some garlic in chicken broth. When they finished cooking, i mashed them with a potato masher. also, didn't have curry paste or fresh ginger,so I used the spices suggested by other reviewers. it still seemed a little bland, so I added some chili paste and that kicked it up nice.it was still "missing something" until I added sour cream to each bowl as it was being served. That took it over the top! it was incredible!! can't wait to make it again :)

Great sweet and spicy flavor combination.  I made this for my vegan brother on Christmas.  He loved it.  Next time I will cut down the roasting time to 35 min. b/c my potatoes came out a little mushier than I would have liked, though they still (thankfully!) held their shape in the soup.  Also, I will use about half an onion next time.  My onion was quite large and I don't like to eat so many straight-up onions in my soup.

Delicious!  We doubled the curry paste to add more spice and also added about a teaspoon of fish sauce.  As another reader recommended, we added mushrooms and next time I'll add red bell peppers too.  Excellent!

Sooooooooo freaking good. BAKE. THE. POTATOES. Cut in half, brush with a mixture of olive oil allspice nutmeg and cinnamon, bake facedown in over, peel off the skins and you’re ready. This willl reallllllllly benefit the flavor of the soup and preserve the nutrients of the orange potato flesh.

This recipe had a bit to much tartness with that much lemon in it but I think it may depend on the sweet potato as well. I have also substituted a butternut squash in this recipe and it was excellent, much creamer. Either way it gets lots of compliments.

Four stars as written, but my daughter and I thought the flavor was too subtle until we made the following changes: boiled the sweet potatoes as a time saver, thinned it out a little with more vegetable broth,  doubled the curry paste (still could have used a little more heat), added the juice from 1/2 a lime.  We also blended the finished soup right in the pot with an immersion blender.  With the drizzle of sesame oil upon plating, we also sprinkled some sliced green onions (no cilantro on hand).   It looked very elegant and tasted wonderful with these small changes.

OMG! This is the first time I’ve left a review but this soup was that good! I didn’t have curry paste so I followed the suggestion from another reviewer and added 1 tsp each of cumin, curry, ginger and chili. My boyfriend and I both loved it and he’s asking when I’m making it again (we just had it last night!)

So, so good! I am going to make a double batch next time and freeze it for future dinners. Also very affordable. Thank you to the author of this recipe!

I forgot the lemon juice and used dried instead of fresh cilantro. Still turned out splendidly!

The recipe does not specify pureeing the soup, but the picture looks like it was pureed. I did not bake the sweet potatoes first; rather peeled and cubed them and sauteed after the onions, adding some vegetarian broth. Fresh ginger gives it a good bite. Did not have curry paste but substituted red chili, coriander, curry powder. Used a drizzle of spicy red chili tahini on the top, under the chopped fresh cilantro. Served to guests, every drop was disappeared!

I made this in an instant pot.  I sautéed the onions and then stirred In the curry paste and ginger paste (rather than minced ginger).  Added the peeled cut sweet potatoes - about 3/4”-1” - and 3 cups broth and 1 tsp. soy sauce.  Cooked at high pressure for 5 minutes, then quick release.  After the QR, stirred in light coconut milk and lemon/lime juice.

We used frozen diced sweet potato’s from Trader Joe’s to speed up the process.  DELISH!  Topped with parsley, sesame oil and chili powder.  Great mix of flavors, perfect fall meal.

Very nice.  Doubled  everything to serve a crowd 12.  It was just a bit too lemony for our taste, but corrected it by reducing the acid with a very small quantity of baking soda.  A great success for a family Father's day dinner.

I'm not even going to pretend that I followed this recipe.  I used it as a guide for the flavor profile and it was delicious.  The first change I made gave the sweet potato a more roasted flavor since I sliced it thin (1/4-1/2 inch slices) and roasted it in a hot oven with olive oil and salt and pepper.  Then, I sauted grated ginger and sliced onion in a mix of coconut oil and sesame oil. After they were tender, I added curry powder (probably about a tablespoon) and continued to cook the mixture until it was fragrant.  Then, I added the sweet potatoes, vegetable broth, and coconut milk.  After seasoning with salt and pepper, I added a hit of lemon juice.  After simmering a while, I pureed the soup and served it with fresh cilantro, sour cream, and toasted pepitas.  Yummy!

Based on other comments, I added some chilli powder. It added much more flavour. Next time, I think I will blend a portion of the mixture to allow more of the sweet potato flavour to go through the soup.

Yummy! I made it in the crockpot (everything but the coconut milk, cilantro and sesame oil), put through the blender after cooking, and then stirred in the coconut milk at the end and garnished with cilantro and oil. I also used half vegetable broth / half chicken stock because that's what I had. I had an amazing Thai soup at a restaurant in Atlanta, and this tasted REALLY close to it!

I'm not sure where the "spicy" is supposed to come from,  mine came out mostly sweet.  This soup is good and it grew on me through the week as I ate it daily for lunch at work.  I added a small amount (1/4 tsp.) of Cayenne pepper just  to test it and will likely add more the next time I make it.  The combination of flavors is really good, especially the drizzle of sesame oil and the cilantro.  I will make this again!

Spoiler:  I made changes - used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, added cut-up chunks of fish & whole shrimp during the last few minutes to make a wonderful sweet potato-coconut-fish curry.  The little drizzle of sesame oil makes it super-delicious & a more elegant presentation.

This soup is absolutely wonderful. Perfect for one of the first cold days. I added a little smoked paprika and a little Cayanne for a little warmth. I also added a few carrots cuz why not? And like many others I boiled the potatoes to speed up the process. So yummy. Will be a staple.

I'm obsessed with this soup! I've served it to friends and family, and they all wanted the recipe. I feel like the sesame oil plays a key role in the flavor development, so definitely don't skip that ingredient. In my preparation I decided to run the soup through a blender to make it smooth and creamy.

Very tasty. I cut the sweet potato and onion into chunks and simmered them in chicken broth, with powdered ginger. Used a stick blender to purée this, with the rest of the ingredients. Adjusted curry and ginger to my tastes. Added about half the lemon juice, tasting it before abs after adding it. Not sure it's necessary.

My family loved this. I had to make a few changes because of my ingredients: Chicken broth instead of veggie, curry powder + a little coriander and cayenne instead of thai paste, part lemon/part lime juice, didn't have cilantro, tried to toast some sesame oil, but it didn't really get toasted. I pureed about 2/3 of it, and it seemed perfect.

I cut the cooking time to 20 minutes by using the pressure cooker. I put all ingredients in the pressure cooker, set the timer to 20 minutes. Ran the pot in cold water to let the pressure out, and pour the contents to my blender. This was delicious. Thanks for the great recipe.

I added a pinch of garam masala to the onions. This would be good with some garlic.  
I didn't have sesame oil so I used coconut oil instead.  I feel like it needed a  little more omph.

My brother absolutely loves this soup!  I make it for him all the time.  It has become a favorite of ours :)   I don't use the sesame seed oil but it turns out just fine.

This was incredibly easy to make. I added cilantro right into the pot and prefer my soup puréed. I used a hand held mixer. The flavour was delicious and I will definitely make it again. I topped it off with a dollop of sour cream.

I did not use my oven but peeled and chopped the sweet potato and cooked with some oil in a soup pot till slightly  caramelized, then added onion etc.. We enjoyed the soup without the sesame and cilantro.  I found the sesame oil much to strong a flavor and aroma.  Served with garlic cheese flat bread from this site.

Terrific recipe exactly as written. Be sure to use the fresh ginger (2" = approx. 3T) I used the ground ginger when I didn't have the fresh on hand and was very disappointed. It makes a huge difference!  I have used both chicken and vegetable broth and both are good.  I prefer a creamy soup so put the whole mixture in my food processor, heat through then serve with a dollop of sour cream and chopped cilantro.  Delicious!

This was very good.  I used 1 tbsp coconut oil instead if butter and low salt chicken broth because that's all I had.  I will make this again.

Wow!  Sooo yummy!  The lemon tastes fantastic in it!  Not spicy though - will add spicy peppers next time. I microwave the sweet potato to make it even easier.  This is my go -to soup.  Love it.

The only reason I am giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because the lemon flavor was too strong.  I would use maybe 1 or 2 tablespoons instead.  Other than that, this recipes is very easy with only a few ingredients, but extremely flavorful and delicious.  Another nice thing about the soup is that it makes really good leftovers.  I think it was even better the day after! I will definitely make this again (just with a little less lemon next time)!

This soup is sooo yummy....I made two changes, I used chicken broth instead of the veg broth and I pureed the soup in a blender just before adding the lemon juice. Great fall soup!

I've made this many times and it is always a hit. I like a bit extra curry paste, but fantastic recipe. I roast the yams early in the day so they are cooled enough to handle and peel before adding to the pot.

Wonderful soup. I followed the recipe exactly.  I put the sesame oil on the table so my guests could add it if they wanted because I find it can easily overpower a dish.  I think baking the potatoes first added to the flavour of the soup.  I did puree this with an immersion blender.  I will make this again.

This soup is good, and everyone who tries it LOVES it.  I put it in the blender, as it looked very unappealing before it was blended.  I personally find it a bit rich and sweet, and although it tastes very nice, I can only handle a small cup of it.

This was awesome! I put less curry paste in (personal preference) and did run it thru the blender to make it more of a cream soup... otherwise made it as written and loved it. Absolutely will make it again and again..

This recipie looked SO good I just had to try it!  I'm SO glad I did!!  I tweaked it a little...  I used College Inn Culinary Broth in the Thai Coconut Curry flavor, the whole 32 oz box, even though it was 4 cups...because I'd pureed everything, it was thick enough to substain the extra cup of liquid.    I also used yellow curry instead of red, because - one I'm not a huge curry fan, and two I didn't want it to be too spicy for the kids.  I also omitted the cilantro & ginger, since I'm not a fan of either.  Everyone LOVED it!! YUMMO!  It's definately a keeper :)

My husband, father and sons hated this! In fact, the next night when my son didnt want to eat his dinner, my husband threatened to make him eat the "orange" soup...my son ate his dinner.   But I thought it was okay. wont make it again. something was off and I followed the recipe exactly. The cilantro is the only thing that made this soup edible.

This was awesome and so easy to make.  I, like another reviewer, peeled and diced the sweet potatoes and boiled them rather than baking them and having to scoop out the flesh (less mess).  Will be making again. Thanks!

This was awesome!  Changed a few things, I peeled and boiled the sweet potatoes, then blended them with the coconut milk.  Put that in with the broth and onions and then added the spices instead of chili paste. As per another review 1 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon chili powder, 1 t- cumin, and 2 t-curry.  I also put in cayanne for extra spice.  And then thickened it with 1 tablesoon cornstarch.  I wanted to make this more like a thai dish than soup.  So I made rice on the side and browned some chicken to add at the end.  It was fantastic!  But, adding the sesame oil flattened the taste so I added more curry to taste and next time I will add some brown sugar to sweeten it up.  Great!

Delicious!  The first 2 stores I went to didn't have red curry paste so I had to use green.  The soup still came out wonderful.

Very good and very different!  I peeled and cut up the sweet potatoes and onions and added them to boiling chicken broth.  Cooked for ~15 min., then pureed everything.  I also added 1 package of frozen carrots that had been microwaved and pureed with ~1/2 c. water.  Added coconut milk, lime juice instead of lemon, red curry paste, 1 tsp. ground ginger, and sesame oil.  Omitted salt and cilantro.  The lime juice was a touch overpowering for my tastes and the coconut flavor a little too mild, but maybe that's my fault for playing with the recipe!

I thought this was quite delicious. Even my husband loved it and he doesn't like sweet potatoes. I did make a couple changes, though I didn't want to make them. I had no curry paste, so I used some powdered red curry from my spice rack. It added a good flavor, but I definitely want to do it with curry paste next time. Also, I used jarred fresh minced ginger instead of sliced root because I didn't have any root. And I blended some of the potato up (I was using leftover boiled from Thanksgiving) but not completely, so there were still some lumps and stuff, for character. I definitely want to make this again, but exactly by the recipe next time.

I thought that the curry really made the soup wonderful! Instead of red curry, I used yellow and vegetable broth. I would recommend this soup to any vegetarian! Great job!

great recipe.  I boiled the sweet potato.  I substituted the coconut milk with half and half instead and used curry powder instead.  Simple, fast and easy to make.
