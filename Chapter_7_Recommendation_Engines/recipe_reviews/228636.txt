Yippee this is another time I get to write a stellar first review of a recipe! While it may have several steps the recipe is still simple enough and easy enough to follow even while you and your hubs are making a dinner together with several different dishes! And even when you scale the recipe down to two servings which necessitated not only a different sized baking dish but different baking times as well. Simply put this is excellent. First the filling cooked in advance of its going into the oven is beautiful with its little bit of butter and the maple syrup. Creative and delicious for sure. Second the crust much like a pie crust but with the unusual addition of sour cream. Tender and buttery good. And the topping which left me at first thinking it would never work. Not only does it work it s outstanding. And the three of these components together? An ethereal old-fashioned comforting curl your toes you thought you died and went to heaven dish of fresh peach loveliness. I ve written so many reviews that I wish I was a better writer so that I could effectively communicate just how awesome good this dessert is without sounding stale. The submitter suggests this same recipe can be used just as easily with other fruits. But I just can t imagine it being any better than this.

Absolutely Delicious! Experimented with guests and their reaction was "WOW is this good". Pre-prepared the crust nectarine and peach filling and the egg mixture. After serving dinner I filled the pie crust and it was ready just in time to serve warm with vanilla ice-cream. Will keep this recipe as one of my favorites.

This was excellent! The steps were easy and the recipe clearly written. I too thought the topping would be a mistake but it ended up being very tasty. The components of the flaky crust buttery peaches and creamy topping were perfect!!! Thanks Caroling.

If you are looking for something different than your average run-of-the-mill fruit cobbler buckle etc. this is it! The aluminum foil is a necessity. If you do not have it you will need to reduce the baking time as I did--keeping an eye on it--as it will burn around the corners and edges. The topping has a great texture and is excellent!

This was really tasty! I'm a recipe tweaker. I didn't peel the peaches, used 2 whole eggs instead of just yolks, used 1/4 cup less sugar, and substituted half almond flour for the crust, and it turned out great!
