Very good!  I had chicken leg quarters that I divided into legs and thighs for this recipe.  I did add a bit of seasoning to the chicken before sauteeing it in the oil (adobo, salt, and pepper).  Other than that, the only changes I made were to reduce the amount of tomato sauce by half and thicken the sauce with a mixture of 1 Tbs butter and 1 Tbs flour at the end after removing the chicken.  I served the sauce over the chicken and some steamed white rice.  I'll definitely make this again and again.  My 9-year-old daughter asked me to say she feels this is "A Masterpiece"!

Did it in the slow cooker. Ate with mashed potatoes. Browned chicken beforehand with cumin, salt and pepper. Delish!

Not quite sure what to say about this recipe. It did come out tangy but still bland. We added some roasted Anaheim chiles and used 1/2 tsp. ground cumin and 1/2 tsp. whole cumin. Not sure how much balsamic vinegar my guy put in. The sauce was much more flavorful 8 hours later after the spices had a chance to meld and assert themseves. We are going to use the rest of the chicken and sauce for enchiladas tonight. The flavors were not there in such a short cook time. Might try again.

My husband and I really liked this! I browned the chicken in hot chicken broth to cut down on calories. I also used one 26 ounce can of Hunt's garlic and herb spaghetti sauce and one 8 ounce can of plain tomato sauce. Next time I will add green peppers and mushrooms to the sauce and will use boneless skinless chicken leg meat instead of the legs because it would make it easier to eat. We had it over spaghetti. Great flavor!

Good basic recipe, but as others have said, it needs much more flavor.  I added more vinegar, doubled the garlic and began frying the chicken with salt, pepper and cumin.  I also used fresh tomatoes made into sauce...but it still needed something...I think some heat. Generally a good recipe, but not spectacular.

Excellent!  I also seasoned chicken with adobo, salt and pepper.  I added onion and garlic to near-browned chicken and then added sauce and other seasonings along with a small amount of water. I added flour to thicken and served over rice.  A nice change for chicken.

Great recipe!  The only things I did differently were to use 6 Cups tomato sauce, double the oregano, and omit the onions.  We will make this again and again.  Thank you!!!!

I did, in fact, chicken out.  The sauce was too much like pasta sauce for me to risk putting it on top of the chicken.  I ended up making a different gravy to coat and bake.  However, my son did try it with the chicken and he gave it two thumbs up.  I tasted it and it was good but as a pasta sauce base or chili base.  It needed a LOT of spicing up.  Bland.

Very tasty and easy! I added quite a bit more balsamic vinegar, about 1/4 of a cup. and went heavy on the garlic because... well I like garlic and balsamic. It gave the whole meal a rich flavor. Thank you for the recipe!

"It's not bad." he said, damning it with such faint praise... Would I make it again? Probably not.

I stayed with the recipe for the most part but instead of pasta sauce I hand-blended a can of whole tomatoes so it would be tangier and so it would not taste like a pasta sauce and I used just a small (213ml) can of tomato sauce.  I also used 3 garlic cloves and an extra tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. It turned out nice and tangy.  Makes a nice change from the usual roasted or barbeque chicken.

I made this and the only difference was that I blended up the sauce because of my picky eaters with onion. Served with mexican rice and it was a hit. Very good and what a pleasant smell.

I changed the recipe tremendously, but it was a great inspiration! I did not give it 5 stars because I did not actually follow the recipe.

This is a very easy, surprisingly easy way to prepare chicken (I used chicken quarters instead of just chicken legs because that's what I had available, and it worked out great). However, it needed a bunch of salt in the sauce because it lacks seasoning, and I will probably finish the legs with the sauce in the oven next time instead of cooking them on the stove.

I am not a big fan of bones so I went a little further by removing the meat off the bones once the chicken was done.

It was good in a pinch  or when you need to use ingredients on hand, I did need to add alot more spices. Great base sauce though. We love anything with cumin in it.  If not for this recipe I would nver have thought to put cumin in a tomato type sauce. Good though. I also suggest frying the onions up along with the chicken. It add a bit more flavor. Thanks for the recipe.
