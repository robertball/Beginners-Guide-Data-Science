I used one can of dark red & one can of light red kidney beans for color. And used fat free Miracle Whip for the dressing. Made it more Weight Watcher friendly for me. Delicious lunch to take to the office.

I followed the recipe to the T, using Miracle Whip. All of my family did not care for the taste of Miracle Whip, commenting, “It’s too mayo-ey.” I doctored it by doubling the recipe except for the Miracle Whip and added 1cup plain Greek yogurt, toasted pecans and a pinch of cinnamon. Family said they liked it! Next time I will skip the Miracle Whip and just use plain Greek yogurt. And may try adding cooked diced chicken.

11.6.17  Nothing fancy here, just a simple salad that has been around for a long time, one that I make and enjoy all year, and one that comes together very quickly.  I don't peel the apples (just core them),  use light Miracle Whip, and don’t even bother to measure it, just stir in until you’ve reached the  consistency you like.  Nothing not to like here, at least in this house.

Love this recipe. If I'm not feeding it to hubs I use lemon yogurt instead of salad dressing. Great both ways!!

Made without the beans, and with 1 large red apple (was the only kind I had), regular seedless red grapes and added 1/4 cup of chopped orange bell pepper. Also, did not have Miracle Whip so used just a few tablespoons of light caeser dressing and this was a great side! Thanks for a simple, tasty and versatile side dish (will probably be a new snack for me too)!
