Really very good.  I did make a few changes.  Cut the chicken into cubes and marinated it for about 30 minutes then placed all ingredients into a casserole dish and baked it for about 35 minutes at 350 and served over hot rice.  Next time I think I will add garlic powder and a few red pepper flakes for a little added zip.  I also may try doing it as a stir fry so I can thicken the sauce a little bit.  Regardless it was very good and super easy!

I love cooking in foil packets because it's fast and easy. This recipe is no exception! I grilled the packets and the chicken was super moist. The combination of the veggies, sauce, and pineapple is very tasty. I served the contents over rice (be sure to pour the juice from the packet over everything...yum!) This freezes exceptionally well, too.

I made this on our camping trip this weekend, and it was a big hit!  Only it took closer to 40 minutes to cook.  We didn't mind because we were having so much fun sitting around the fire, watching them cook.

These are delicious!!  The only changes I made was that I used breast strips, a sweet onion and I also marinated the chicken for an hour in the teriyaki sauce.  I was having a friend over for dinner so I cut up the veggies and stored them in the fridge along with the marinating chicken so that when we were ready to eat all I had to do was throw them together.  So easy, so good, and yet good for you.  This will definitely be a regular of mine.

Since the skies opened up today, I had to fix these in the oven which I'm sure affected the flavor at least a little. I baked them in the foil packets for about 45 minutes total at 450 degrees (checked at 20 and they weren't ready). I used fresh pineapple and that was very good with it, the best part of the dish I thought. The chicken didn't absorb too much of the flavor, I marinated it for about an hour prior to cooking as well, so once on the plate I added a little drizzle of the teriyaki sauce over the meat and rice. It was overall a good dish, I loved the veggies in it! Easy to prep, simple and tasty.

Very good and super easy.  I added sweet peppers and mushrooms to the mix and then let everyone make their own packets.  The kids even liked it!

I made this and it turned out incredible!! I used chicken tenderloins, and added a yellow bell pepper and used red onion.  Cut everything up (except the chicken) and added it all to a bag.  Drenched everything in KC Masterpiece Honey Teriyaki and let marinate for 1 hour. Put everything in each packet, added the pineapple on top and sealed them up.  Cooked on the grill for about 45 min and served over white rice. It was a flavor explosion! I think the honey teriayki was the key. Will definately make again!!

This was moist, tender and absolutely delicious! I used 1 each of the red, green and yellow bell peppers.  I also cracked some pepper over this. I marinated all the ingredients (chicken, peppers, onions, and sauce) together for an hour before I cooked it.  It took about 25-30 minutes on my grill on low setting.  Served over rice, my kids gobbled it up!  I ended up using A1's 'ginger teriyaki' sauce, which was thicker than most sauces I've used.  Awesome meal! Thanks!

I added baby bellas, zucchini & baby carrots I had to use up, tossed all veggies in some teriyaki marinade too. It was raining so I baked them in 400 degree oven on baking sheet in case the foil leaked (one did) for 35 minutes & served over herbed rice. Very easy & delicious weeknight meal!

You can't beat this recipe for how deliciously simple it is! I did grind a little black pepper over the chicken before adding the teriyaki sauce.  You shouldn't need any salt as the teriyaki sauce is salty enough.
I served this over couscous and it soaked up all the delicious juices.  Yum!
You could really play around with this recipe with different sauces/marinades and veggies.  I'm thinking BBQ sauce, onions, maybe some summer squash.  Lots you could do!

Yum! Very easy. I cut the recipe in half, added two cloves of pressed garlic a few good squirts of Saracha sauce and some pepper. I also substituted the peppers for two carrots and cut the chicken into cubes. Threw it in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, kept it covered for 20 of those minutes and served over rice.

This recipe was a great and fast one. Omitted the peppers because my boyfriend doesnt care for them, I think if we had them it would have added even more flavor. We used chicken tenders and salt and peppered before pouring in terriyaki sauce. Also added in the natural pineapple juice. This chicken was soooo moist and could be easily cut with a fork! We served with garlic mashed potatoes This packet idea opens up the door for additional great tasting and fast recipe ideas

TERRIFIC!! These came out so moist and flavorful and this was one fast & easy meal! I used chicken breasts from the family pack that you buy in a bag and I didn't cook them on the grill--I put them in the oven at 400 deg for about 20 min. I combined the teriyaki sauce with minced garlic and blk pepper and marinaded the chicken in a ziploc for about two hours before putting everything into the "packets". I also added sliced carrots and used frozen (thawed) peppers, instead of fresh (it's less expensive to buy them frozen!), and a sliced red onion. The kids really ate this up (well, the chicken, carrots and pineapple part at least), and even asked for more. Next time I'll make more than one per person, or use larger chicken pieces. This would be an amazing make-ahead meal for a family BBQ or even a camping trip. I'll be making these often in the future. Thanks!

This was absolutley wonderful.  I did change it up and instead of using teriyaki sauce, I used a Hawaiian marinade.  I thought it was a great compliment to the onions and pineapple.  I also used red and orange bell peppers and a red onion.  Served over white rice, it was DELICIOUS! Definately a keeper!!

This was tasty, quick and easy. The flavour all depends on the teriyaki sauce so make sure you use one you like.

THis was surprisingly good! I made "one big packet" due to time restraints. I used chicken tenders instead of breasts and also added ginger powder. I put all ingredients in  a baking dish and covered it with aluminum foil, then baked it in the oven.

This was a really fun dish to make. Hubby and friend recently bought a house to renovate and flip, so on my daughters non dance nights, dinners are late and pretty much have to be just about ready when he gets home. This was healthful, quick and absolutely delicious. I poured a bit of the pineapple juice in the packet too and I thank you for a recipe that Drew and the kids oohed and ahhed over!

This was very easy and very good for a quick weeknight meal.  My boyfriend gave it a 4 but I think for being how fast and easy it was, it def deserves a 5!  I actually baked this in the oven at about 375 for 45 minutes.  Served over brown rice.  I also added mushrooms in the packets.  Delicious!

This was definitely an easy recipe and I do appreciate that but I found that it was bland - if I do this again I will try a different teriyaki sauce and add some additional spices.  I also cut my chicken into bite sizes, added carrots and used fresh pineapple rather than canned.  Instead of making individual packets I used a foil oven bag and put everything into that - made it very easy for grilling and the chicken was moist.

These packets were so good and so easy!  Followed the directions to the "T" and they were great!  I did have to drain some of the juice out of the foil before pouring it over the rice.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe and the chicken turned out bland.  I don't think I would try this again.  Thanks anyway.

I must have done something wrong.  The chicken was so dry you couldn't cut it.  There was no juice in the packet when it was opened.  It didn't leak out, there just wasn't any.  If I try it again which I probably won't, I will use heavy aluminum foil and maybe add more juice as suggested and just jazz it up some.

Very fast, EASY, and quick cleanup!  You must have rice, so delicious to pour the sauce over.  I think it really matters what kind of teriyaki sauce you get, I got a kind of cheap one and I think it would have been better with a nicer one.  All in all, quick, healthy, delicious!

I did make some changes with what we had on hand. We grilled the chicken separate from the veggies. I add some of my spices to it and a little bit of soy sauce and butter. For the veggies I used red and yellow bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, pineapple, salt and pepper and butter. I made brown rice and quinoa. It tasted yummy.

This was good, but not great.  Although we enjoyed it, we didn't enjoy it enough to want it again.

Because my grill was out of gas, I had to do this on top of the stove, so I browned my chicken first, put it on a plate, then sautéed the vegetables and added the sauce.  Returned the chicken to the mixture and heated through. Served it over rice.  It turned out really good.  I kept all the ingredients the same, just changed up the cooking method.

Great, simple recipe, especially for summer. I used 3/4 of a fresh pineapple instead of canned, an orange, red, and green bell, and one onion. I forgot the teriyaki, but it was still delicious. Instead of making grill packets, I threw the veggies and fruit in my cast iron skillet and covered with foil, and grilled the chix separate. The veggie mix cooked in 30 mins. Served it over rice. Like I said, great summer recipe. Nice and fresh! Next time I will try to remember the teriyaki!

This wasn't bad, it just felt like it was missing something. It was rather blah, even after we added extra spices. Maybe it's just us...
