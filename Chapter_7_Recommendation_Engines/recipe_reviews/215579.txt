Three stars meaning "Good, but average" in my book, I found this not quite up to that. It is watery with not much flavor, and certainly not what one would expect from the title - therefore, two stars if prepared strictly sticking to the recipe.  I guess a good word for it might be "wimpy." So I made it a second time, this time substituting strawberry yogurt for the milk, adding more watermelon than called for, and a handful of ice cubes.  Still thinner, of course, than what one would consider a milkshake, but much improved - very refreshing, not too sweet  and with a lot more flavor.  Four stars with the tinkering.

Processed this using about 2 cups of melon, 1 cup milk, 2 tsp Splenda, and it tasted like weak watermelon milk...not good.  I then added about 1 more cup of melon, some crushed ice, and blended again.  I would have given this 3 stars, but in all fairness to the recipe, this watermelon did not have a lot of flavor, and I think that affected the outcome of the shake.  I don't think this ever will be what I consider a true milkshake (without maybe adding a scoop of ice cream??), but it's not bad, and really is low in calories and fat (unlike most milkshakes).

Per other reviewers, I used more watermelon. After blending I had 2 cups of watermelon puree. I only used a cup of milk and added a tablespoon of white sugar. My final thoughts: good. Especially if you're watermelon has started to go mushy. And I think that may be the only time I mix up this drink.

My 2 boys, ages 3 and 4, loved it, and even my 4-year-old daughter, who never likes my smoothies, loved it!  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is very thin. I would love to try it with frozen melon next time, or add some yogurt, and see if that makes it better.  Also, I added a splash of vanilla extract, which gave it a bit of an "ice cream" flavor that my 3 kids liked.  Come to think of it, I might have to freeze a whole lot of watermelon chunks to get us through the winter, if it means they'll drink this smoothie with breakfast to get them all additional servings of fruit and calcium!!   I am most impressed that Picky Daughter just slurped her cup empty, asked for seconds, and asked if we can have it every day!!

If you want to, add a scoop of watermelon sherbert, it adds density and sweetness. :)

Really good.  I added a tiny splash of vanilla, and only 2 cups milk.  It was really thin so i think i will try more watermelon next time.

Ok, so after reading a bunch of reviews I decided to try a few different things. 

*Disclaimer - I used a watermelon grown in our garden and the flavor was awesome....but it had lots of seeds so we juiced more than half of it*

So we had watermelon juice to start with. In order to bulk up the "milkshake" I cut two bananas into medallions and froze those. I blended the frozen bananas and milk to make the base of the milkshake. After it was the consistency I wanted (on the thicker side), I added the watermelon Juice. My son said it was like a watermelon cloud. On the plus side I didn't have to use any extra sugar since I used the bananas. I eyeballed everything so here is my best estimate:

2 bananas - cut and frozen
about a cup or so of milk (I used whole)
about 3-4 cups watermelon juice

I tweaked the recipe...I used just a dash of milk because watermelon makes it's own juice ...and little less sugar..is a very good smoothie.
