I had really high hopes for the Butterball Turkey Burgers and this recipe. I was a little disappointed in the nutrition content of the burgers, one being the sodium content. I would have preferred using freshly ground turkey. I also didn't care too much for the pineapple on the burger itself but it was great on the side. I'm not much for savory and sweet together.

We love turkey but we've never had turkey burgers before! I personally loved these following the complete recipe. The only thing my boyfriend didn't like was the sauce but that's because he HATES mayonnaise. I couldn't slip it past him either! He could taste it! lol. Other than that, these were a big hit in my family.

I'm not big into turkey burgers, but I do LOVE burgers, so I thought I'd give these a go...I was pleasantly surprised! This was a nice combo of flavors and the sweet chili mayo really made this extra tasty. I was surpised when hubby said that he thought these were good too...I would make these again! Thanks for sahring. :)

This is one great burger!  I say that and still can't believe that I don't even like Turkey burgers!  I was wrong about this one. I thought that this was going to be dry and tasteless, but it was moist and full of flavor.  The combination of the grilled pineapple and the sweet chili mayo took this burger to another level for me.  The only thing I did differently was I used fresh ground turkey as opposed to the premade frozen patties.  The frozen burgers are convenient and a real time saver, but  I looked at the label and decided that fresh was going to be a better choice for me. I am saving this recipe so I can make these again very soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked the convenience of having the turkey burgers already made up. The grilled pineapple and onion and chili mayo sauce really make this tasty burger!

I have to say first, I did not use the frozen burgers. I made my own from fresh turkey because of the sodium. Love the chili mayo.  The flavors combine really well.  Served it on homemade quinoa oatmeal hamburger rolls and with Alexa Spicy Sweet Potato Waffle Fries.

I did not like these at all. I could not eat the turkey patties. They taste highly processed and are very salty. They actually reminded me of cafeteria food. I think this would be a delicious sandwich if patties are made with fresh ground turkey.

We absolutely loved these! I never buy frozen burgers because they are always so bland & dry - Not These! The Butterball frozen turkey burgers were juicy an so well seasoned! The chili-mayo and grilled pineapple really made these burgers special. We will definitely be making them again. Thanks, Butterball!

I love this recipe the pineapple and chili mayo are excellent and add so much to the sandwich. Because of diet restrictions for family members I could not use the Butterball frozen burgers way to much sodium. I used Butterballs everyday fresh ground turkey in place of the frozen burgers. Seasoned the meat myself eliminating the salt. Much better for my family and very very tasty. Makes a great dinner and I think these burgers would impress your guest at your next BBQ.

I really enjoyed this turkey burger. I had gotten away from turkey burgers for awhile as they did not seem to have a good enough flavor. These ones were great though! All of the flavors came together great!

We really enjoyed these!  I did use fresh meat and formed my own patties rather than using the frozen ones, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly!

i do NOT like pineapple with my meat, but i determined to give this a try, and i've gotta say, i'm smitten.  so much so, that we're making it twice this week!  we did ours with a lettuce "bun," and it was run-down-your-elbows messy, but oh-so-worth-it.

I really liked the idea of this burger.  The grilled pineapple, fresh red onions and chili sauce worked very well together.  I was not a fan though of the turkey burgers.   We are big fans of turkey burgers and I make them frequently from fresh turkey.  My family did not like the texture of the preformed burgers and they were very salty.  I will try this again, but, next time use Butterball fresh ground turkey.

I've made turkey burgers before and wasn't crazy about them. I'm ashamed to say I wasn't expecting much from this product, but I was very pleasantly surprised! The burger was delicious and I especially enjoyed the Sweet Chili Mayo on it. I fixed two burgers for our dinner tonight and am really glad there are four more in the freezer for another night. I love the way it's packaged too. Separated by paper and stored in a ziplock bag for easy rezipping after taking some out to use. You hit a home run with this one, Butterball.

Unsure of whose frozen turkey burgers I used.  Probably the only drawback. Next time make my own patties.  Still spiced them up like I would for a hamburger..  The pineapple and chili/mayo were great & avocado on one of the burgers. Toasted brioche buns with butter and garlic.  Colby jack instead of cheddar.  Side of grilled asparagus    Fabulous Will make again.

Granted there's no such thing as a bad burger, only uncooked burger so rating under 3/5 is impossible. I had high hopes for this one but it let me down. The main problem is that the sauce had no taste. I made 4 of these and I put varying amounts of sauce on them and still couldn't taste it. I'm not sure cheddar is a good choice either. Pineapple is nice, but it's just a bland burger with a pineapple. There's really no flavor to this burger. After it's done you know you just ate a burger but can't remember what was in it.

I really enjoyed this burger except for the pineapple, which I was looking most forward to. I admit I'm not a huge sweets person and it definitely had a sweet taste to it. I didn't mind the pre-made patties, I loved the flavor of them. I grilled my onions (personal preference) and they went great with it, as did the chili mayo, cheese and lettuce. The pineapple just threw it off for me, maybe if I grill them longer next time I'll like them better. Had one friend brave the burger with me with all the toppings; he said it was an odd pairing but he finished the whole thing. My husband and best friend liked the burgers minus the pineapple as well.

The turkey burgers were flavorful, but a bit salty (and high in sodium) for me.  Otherwise, they had good flavor, were quite moist and convenient because they cook right from frozen.  I liked all the components to the burger, including the grilled pineapple.  I served some oven fries along side and the chili mayo was not only great on the burger, but also as a dip for the fries.

We really liked these. I left off the cheese and used baby spinach instead of lettuce, but they made a quick and tasty dinner. The chili mayonnaise and added pineapple were great! I also accidentally bought fresh Butterball turkey burger patties, and they were very good.  They weren't too salty as some reviewers found with the frozen patties.

I really liked the flavor combinations on this. I wasn't sure what to think about the pineapple, but when it blends with the chili sauce and onion it all taste kind of like one tasty sauce. I didn't have a grill handy so I placed the defrosted patties on a foil lined sheet, sprayed them lightly with PAM, and broiled them. It took about 22 minutes for them to be done on high flipping 1-2 times. I put the pineapple slices in my NuWave oven and dropped the buns in the toaster. Only change I made was using whole wheat buns and lite mayonnaise. I think, I still prefer the taste of raw ground turkey to make my own burgers. However, these were still pretty good and better than any turkey burger I have ordered out.
