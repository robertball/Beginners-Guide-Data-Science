These were really yummy!  I made them last night with a few modifications to cut back on fat/calories.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, used 4 egg whites and cut the oil back to 1/4 cup and added 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce - turned out fantastic!  Since I didn't have any lemon extract, I used the zest and juice from halI of a lemon (could use more zest next time) and also kept my cranberries (fresh) whole.  Thanks...will make again!

This recipe is the lemon/cranberry muffin recipe I've been looking for.  I got sick of buying them on the way to work so I've been trying to find a half decent recipe.  This one is just as good (if not better) than the ones at the local coffee shop.  Instead of extract I added the zest and juice of one lemon.  I like these muffins to be tart and lemony and I found that amount to be perfect.  I also added vanilla, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, and substituted the milk for buttermilk.  Thanks for sharing, and I'll be making these ones regularly from now on.

Loved this recipe! I changed it up a little by making them orange flavored.  I added zest of one orange w/ 1/2 tsp. of almond extract and about 1 tablespoon of orange juice.  I also used dried cranberries which were excellent.  Made a streusel topping.  They were great!  I'm going to try it with lemon/blueberry combo next.  Definitely a keeper!

Quite frankly, I have never made a muffin this delicious. I just LOVED these. I made an extra half the recipe since I am taking them to a brunch and now I just want to stay home and eat these myself!  They were so tender and yes, the batter is somewhat soupy as others said, but the muffins were perfect.  I did add about a third cup of flaxmeal for a nutritional boost and because I love it in baked goods.  I only put toasted almonds on a few of the muffins, but wish I had done more because it is really good.  Thank you so much Noelle for posting this perfect recipe.  I will use it over and over!

Great recipe! These muffins turned out light and moist with a touch of citrus flavor. I subbed orange extract for the lemon and turned these into "Orange Cranberry Muffins". I added a bit of fresh orange juice along with some orange zest to heighten the orange flavor which complimented the fresh cranberries beautifully. I subbed buttermilk for the milk and cut the baking powder in half to compensate. I also added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I topped the muffins off with turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven. I baked these in a Texas sized muffin tin and got 8 huge muffins. They baked up beautifully in exactly 22 minutes. Perfect for breakfast or afternooon snack!

these muffins turned out great.  Simple recipe and great results!  I didn't have lemon extract so I used lemon zest. Yummy!

I just had to write to say that I tried this recipe and absolutely LOVE it, being a fan of lemon and cranberry muffins!  I used lemon juice and lemon rind instead of the extract and the batter was just right.  What was great was that these muffins are still moist and taste fresh five days after making them!  Usually muffins go a bit stale after the first day.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I can't wait to make variations of it with blueberries and other fruit.  Thanks very much for submitting and sharing this!

Great recipe! These muffins are delicious. In addition to the extract, I used the zest of 1 lemon. It had a really light, refreshing lemon flavor. Next time I might add a bit more zest. I used dried cranberries, as I didn't want these to be really tart. Very nice, very delicate muffins. Thank you!

Excellent flavor!  I used naturally sweet dried cranberries and it may have made this recipe a little dry for me however, I will make them again adding a couple tablespoons more of the vegetable oil.  Thank you.

Very good!  I made them in my muffin top pan, for around 12-15 minutes, using 1.5 tsp of orange extract plus a generous shake of dried orange zest.  And cherry craisins work great too!  Nice and moist with good flavor.  Thanks!

These muffins turned out marvelously!  I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and changed it up a bit.  I used dried cranberries, 1/4tsp of almond, 1 Tbsp tangelo juice and the zest of one tangelo.

I didn't find this recipe "soupy" like another member did. The batter was just right and made 12 large-capped muffins. The texture when baked was cake-like, just the way I like them, and they were delicious served with my homemade strawberry jam.

I run a Bed & Breakfast and I decided to make these for my guests. They were a hit! One lady said they were the best muffins she had ever tasted. Process: I made the mix as per the recipe and baked a couple test muffins, but they were very bland, and definitely not lemony enough. So I added 2 Tbsp of lemon juice to the mix, and the zest of half a lemon. The next batch were delicious! I used full, frozen cranberries, and left out the almonds. This has now become a staple for the B&B!

I really WANTED to love this!  I am so disappointed.  I always make a test batch exactly as the recipe states, then if I don't like it, I try to save the rest anyway I can. So as is, it was sooo bland, no real lemony flavor. So i thought maybe real lemon juice was needed instead, but I didnt have any lemons so I used bottled concentrate, I also added finely chopped pecans on top before baking. NO LUCK! oh well. *UPDATE* Tried AGAIN, with real lemon juice and zest. I tried as mini muffins and as a loaf. I'm still disappointed.

These are EXCELLENT.  I used some of the suggestions others had made. I substituted a tablespoon of lemon zest and 1 teaspoon juice for the extract.... I also used applesauce and oil.... 1/4 cup of each. AND.......I used dried cherries instead of the cranberries.  AWESOME.

Great recipe! I have made it twice now - the first time I followed the recipe word for word and it was good I just would have liked a few more cranberries, so the second time I bumped it up to 1 1/2 cups of cranberries and it was perfect!

Wonderful! I did make some changes though. 3/4 c. milk + 1/4 c. sour cream, 1/4 cup lemon juice, *next time will use juice and rind of a whole lemon*, added 1/2 c each of walnuts, chopped dried apricots, and poppy seeds... ooops.. BUT... NOT poppy seeds as I realized AFTER I sprinkled... omg, they were CARAWAY seeds! I managed to scrape off some, but still had about 1/4 c. in the mix. Turned out perfect... no worries at all. :)))

These were good. However, I changed the recipe from Lemon Cranberry to Orange Cranberry.  I substituted orange zest for the lemon extract.  I also decreased the milk to 3/4 cup and replaced the 1/4 cup with orange juice concentrate.  This is a PERFECT combination of flavors...Also, I used Craisins, since i didn't have canned cranberries.

Excellent.  I followed someone's advice and added 3 T of lemon juice, 1/2 t of baking soda, and I also added an extra 3/4t of lemon extract.  I really wanted lemony muffins!  I would have added lemon zest if I'd have had it.  I blended up the cranberries a little in the blender before stirring them in.  They made the muffin, I think.  This will be my recipe for lemon muffins.  I'll probably try with strawberries, blueberries, or poppy seeds in the future.

I made these with lemon zest and one whole lemons juice. I used fresh cranberries and came out very tart but I like them that way! I would cook them a little less then 20 minutes though or the bottoms burn at least in my oven they did for some of them.

Very, very tasty muffin!  I subbed half the flour with whole wheat white flour, I used dried cranberries and increased them by about 1/3 cup (to use the entire bag) I also upped the lemon extract by 1/2 teaspoon.  These are delicious and I would not change a thing for next time.  I yielded 17 muffins.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These muffins were great!  It was nice to make a cranberry quick bread that used lemon instead of the  usual orange.

I used this recipe for the first time last night.  I made a double batch because I had a lot of fresh cranberries to use.  The only change I made was to use the rind of 1 whole lemon chopped finely and the juice of 1 lemon in place of the lemon extract.
They are PERFECT.  Just enough sweetness and tartness to make a perfect muffin.  The regular sized muffins came out of the paper liners with ease and the mini muffins popped out of the pan which I sprayed with cooking spray.  The mini muffins were a HIT at work!
This recipe is a keeper!

I'm not sure why my muffins had flat tops, but they tasted delicious.  I wait until the second day to rate muffins because some are only good fresh out of the oven, but I ate these two mornings in a row and they were equally yummy.  I had to use dried cranberries because that's what I had, and instead of lemon extract, I used vanilla and added the zest and juice of one lemon.  Very good except for the flat top.

Delicious muffins, and very quick to put together. Used the zest and juice of one whole lemon instead of the lemon extract, and reduced the milk accordingly. Needed to bake for 23 minutes, but my oven tends to be slow. These muffins did not brown on top, so they look underdone even when they're cooked, so be careful. Thanks!

I have made these muffins numerous times now and they are so yummy!! I took the suggestion of a few reviewers and made some changes - substituted the 1/2 cup oil for 1/4 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce, added 1 tsp vanilla and used the zest and juice of 1 lemon instead of the lemon extract. Tim Horton's has nothing on these tasty treats!!!

A friend of mine made some lemon cranberry muffins that were delish, so I thought I would look for a recipe. These were okay, but definitely basic. I will certainly be giving my friend a call...

These were very good.  I made them according to the directions.  There are several things I will change when I make them ag again.  I will double the amount of cranberries - there were not enough to suit my love of cranberries.  I will add more sugar because the muffins weren't all that sweet.  I will also sprinkle sugar on top.  I will add more lemon.  I couldn't even taste the lemon.  But I really did like these.

Oh my are these yummy!  I've tried these twice - once with dried cranberries and once with fresh.  The fresh are by FAR better than the dried. I used orange instead of lemon by substituting the zest and juice of one large orange and the flavor was perfect!  One tip I learned was to lightly dust the cranberries (or any berry you're added to a batter) with four so they don't sink to the bottom.  The toasted almonds make this even better!  Yummmm

I made these by the book the first time, and they were great. The second time, I made them with black cherries instead of cranberries, and flaked coconut in place of the sliced almonds. (I also replaced half the oil with vanilla yogurt).

Wonderful!  Added 1 tsp vanilla, used real 1 lemon and zest, 1/3 cup apple sauce for half of the oil, and POPPY SEEDS!  :D  I had to lower the temp to 375 because it looked like they were burning.  Will make lots more!

Yummy.  I also used a whole "real" lemon including all the zest.  With dried cranberries these have a citrus tang and are really delicious. Will make again.

Not enough lemon flavour!  But texture was awesome... not too sweet.  Next time I will use zest of one lemon along with the extract.  For extra lemon flavour, I added lemon juice to icing sugar and drizzled the glaze on the top of the muffins.... excellent.

Beautiful and delicious!!! Great recipe. I also used zest and juice of a lemon since I didn't have extract. I put the juice in a measuring cup and topped it with milk to make a cup. That soured the milk which made for an even better muffin! Variations of this recipes are lemon-blueberry, orange-cranberry (Mmmm mmm. . . my favourite!), etc. etc. Definitely a keeper.

These were outstanding!!! I wish there were more stars. I didn't have any lemon extract so I did as others did, used Lemon Juice (1 1/2 tsp). It worked out perfectly! My family loves them.

Delicious! Very moist. In addition to the lemon extract I added the zest of a lemon. I was a bit worried that it might be overpowering, but it was absolutely perfect!

The batter for these muffins was very thin and soupy, which meant for a messy transfer to muffin cups. I didn't have lemon extract, so I used lemon zest but I also added some fresh squeezed lemon juice.

Yum.

These are excellent! I omited the almonds and used the zest and juice from 1 meyer lemon instead of lemon extract. I also used 1 C dried cranberries instead of fresh. Easy to make, delicious, and really perfect texture.

Very nice muffin!!!! A simple and very easy recipe!! When followed to the letter this recipe yielded moist, slightly tangy & sweet muffin and the slithered almond topping is a nice touch. You absolutely MUST toast the almonds because they add a nice salty/nutty crunch to balance out the sweet & tangy flavors. As I said, I followed to the letter and my only addition was a dusting of powdered sugar at the end. No sweets come out of  my oven without a little powdered sugar! Goes great with a cup of dark roast coffee. Good luck!!

did not like the outcome at all. the muffins came out looking very "pale". they tasted bland and there was no lemon flavour to it, although i had added extra lemon juice to the recipe already.  will not make this again.

My version uses half whole wheat flour and the juice of a lemon and grated rind that others have mentioned.   I don't have vegetable oil in the house usually so I used melted butter.  I've used both blueberries and / or cranberries.  Delicious!

Very yummy muffins! Instead of using lemon extract, I used the zest and juice of one lemon. I also made a glaze out of powdered sugar and milk and put it on the top. It turned out very nice, but next time I will try more lemon zest and a little bit of vanilla.

These muffins were excellent! I decided to take some reviewers' suggestions and substitute the lemon extract for the zest and juice of one lemon, until I discovered that I was all out of them! I did, however, have one lime, so I used that instead. I also only had dried cranberries, but they still tasted great! I sprinkled poppy seeds on top, along with the sliced almonds. Delicious!!

Not only do these muffins look beautiful, but they are so light and moist and they taste heavenly! I used lemon juice and zest instead of the extract - it tastes very fresh! I also added in 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp of baking soda (to help it rise since it reacts with the acidity of the lemon juice) I subbed in chopped, macerated strawberries for the cranberries. I used the extra strawberry juice, a little lemon juice, some sugar, and made a glaze for the tops, which I put on during the last 3 minutes of baking. It gives the muffin tops have a tangy crispness! Definitely making these again!

This is a great base muffin recipe, something you can use with blueberries or other ingredients. However, I modify the base recipe to make it healthier.

- 1 1/2 cups of regular flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat 
  flour
- HALF the sugar, or use about 3/4 of honey
- Add generous amounts of wheat germ, flak seeds or sprinkle in some multigrain hot cereal (3 table spoons or more)

IMO these muffins are superior and offer a nicer texture than the wonderbread texture of most commercial muffins.

The perfect muffin recipe. Quick and easy to make and tasty. They are light. I changed the recipe a little, I used lemon juice about 1  teaspoon concentrate. A great way to use my fresh cranberries.

These are really great muffins! I did two batches...1 with lemon extract (and zest from one lemon) and the other with 1/2 tsp almond extract and zest from 1 orange (as previously recommended).  I added craisins in them as that's what I had, but I think next time, I would add fresh or frozen cranberries...just would be jucier I think.  But all in all...fabulous muffins!

Excellent muffin--and the recipe is very forgiving.  I didn't have lemon extract, so I substituted the juice of one lemon for the extract.  And in an effort to cut the fat, I used skim milk and reduced the oil to 1/3 cup (plus a couple of tbsp of applesauce).  Also, I didn't have almonds, so I used almond extract instead and just topped with white sugar sparkles.   I couldn't believe how great the texture came out--hearty like a muffin should be, but not dense.
They were just a tad too sweet.  Next I want to reduce the sugar a bit and substitute a little whole wheat flour for the white.
Thanks for the recipe--it's a keeper.

I thought these were very average, and that is saying something since lemon and cranberries are some of my favorite ingredients.

These were very good. I used grated lemon zest and juice of the lemon because I didn't have extract. I also used a mixed berry blend instead of the cranberries because that is what I had on hand. They turned out very well...just not as "cake like" as the ones I get from the coffee shop.

I once had some great lemon cranberry cookies... and these were nothing like that.  My daughter said they were good, so I'm giving them 3 stars.  They looked good, but the outsides got crispy, while the inside had very little lemon flavor at all, and a bit of a weird bitterness to the muffin itself.  I followed the recipe exactly, so I guess these just aren't my style.  I won't make them again.

Fantastic! Thank you for this amazingly simple and delicious recipe!!!  I made some healthful changes; 1 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour (in place of one of the cups of all-purpose flour in the original recipe), 1 cup of Rice Dream (non-dairy milk substitute), 2 tsp. of lemon extract, and only 1/3 cup of oil (instead of 1/2 called for in the original recipe).  I also used sugared cranberries that I had made the day before, and sprinkled granulated sugar on the tops of the unbaked muffins.  Magnificent :)

I pretty much add as much lemon as i want in these since i perfer them to have more of a lemon taste, but the recipe works out pretty well with the intstructed amount as well. These muffins rise bake easy, and keep really well!

We like to do whole wheat flour at our house.  To soften it up and reduce phytic acid, I soak the flour in the milk and 1 Tbsp lemon juice for an hour before mixing it all up.  I also add 2 tsp baking soda to the batter to give it a bigger rise with the whole wheat flour.  And I use sucanat in place of sugar.  Only 1/2 cup or so for a double batch.

My diet version: I used splenda instead of sugar, added orange "mush," changed the oil for applesauce, and added a little vanilla. It was still good, but I'm sure the real (not diet) version as listed is amazing.

I was actually looking for a recipe that had cranberry and orange flavours and found this one, so I used orange extract instead of lemon. It was amazing! Definitely going to try it with lemon next time.

I didn't have lemon extract so I used the zest and juice of a lemon.  For the milk, I used half heavy cream and half water.  They turned out very moist.  Thanks for the recipe.

I would use craisins as opposed to fresh cranberries.  It was a little too tart for my liking. And perhaps my choosing of cranberries was less than perfect, but the cranberries made the muffin taste weird.  The base lemon muffin though was pretty good.  I could eat that without the cranberries though.

These were delicious!  I didn't have any almonds, but the muffins were still wonderful without them. I also added a streusel topping (butter, brown sugar, flour, and pecans...all chopped together) before baking.  Wonderful!

These muffins are delicious! I changed the recipe slightly because I was short on a few of the ingredients. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular flour, and the juice from 1 lemon + the zest from that lemon. Yum!

These were great.  I used splenda baking sugar, just to cut the calories, and they turned out great :)  I also used more than a cup of cranberries, because I had extra & didn't want to toss them.  My in-laws loved them :)

I added some flax seed and added in some yogurt and applesauce in place of the oil and used lemon zest because i had no lemon extract. These muffins were very good and moist. I made 18 and 8 people ate them all.

Try these with LIME!  I halved the recipe, put 3 tsp of LSA, didn't have lemon so i sqeezed half a lime in to soak through dried cranberries before mixing them in, and a bit of zest.  Also 1/2 cup of white choc chips... yummy results, they could loose some sugar since the extra white chocolate are a good sweet complement.  But yeah i reckon these are the best muffins i've ever baked.

These are awesome! Very quick and easy.... I think next time I make them I will try real lemon zest and juice in place of the extract for a more "real" lemon flavor. Still they were excellent.

This is wonderful muffin recipe.  I made this for a Memorial Day Brunch, they were a hit.  I used the juice and zest of 1 lemon and dried cranberries.  I made a struesal topping as I did not have any alomnds. I did end up with 15 muffins perhaps I did not fill the cups enough..at any rate they turned out pretty and yummy.

Excellent sweet and tasty muffins that my boys just love to eat and they get their daily vitamin C with the added zest of one lemon and the juice too. Not too big on extracts, the real thing is so much better tasting and healthier.

I used the zest of one lemon and a squirt of lemon juice instead of the extract, added a little baking soda, decreased the salt, used yogurt in place of milk, decreased the oil, used chopped frozen cranberries, and chopped almonds on top. Overall the texture was excellent, very light but the muffins definitely needed more sugar. After adding some glaze made from powdered sugar+milk, they tasted sweeter.

Excellent! Soft, moist, and tangy. I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Instead of almonds, I used crumb topping (1/4 c. brown sugar + 2 T flour + 1 T butter cut in). Yum!

This is a great recipe im a huge muffin fan and this is a delicous recipe! I substuted the lemon for almond extract as you couldnt taste the lemon, I used real frozen WHOLE cranberries (from our local craberry farm) and I also added pecan halves and apple chunks...AMAZING!!

Amazing muffins, the amount of sugar is simply PERFECT!  I did a few modifications of my own... added a teaspoon of lemon juice, about half a teaspoon of almond extract, and sprinkled confectioner's sugar on top (yum!); despite the extra lemon juice the muffins barely tasted like lemon but they were fabulous cranberry muffins.  Also, I baked them for 1 hour at 325 F and the inside was perfectly well cooked; they're slightly moist but not wet at all.  Perfect!

This is one awesome muffin, I did use craisins because cranberries were not available at my local supermarket and they were just as yummy! FYI-for those of you using a convection oven I did have to change the temp to 325 and reduced the time by two minutes with the fan on high.

I used juice of 1/2 a lemon and the zest of a whole lemon in place of the lemon extract and it came out great! Also, instead of using the traditional muffin pan, I used a muffin-top pan and my family LOVED it!!!

I added zest of one lemon and I think it really added to the flavor.  I did not almonds but it turned out great anyway.  I don't think that anything else needs to be changed.

My kids really liked these muffins.  For the cranberries, instead of halving them I put them in the blender and pulsed them so they were smaller pieces.  And I used vegetable shortening instead of oil, so it wasn't liquidy batter.  All in all, turned out well and is now a family favorite.

I just made these today and they turned out great. I didn't have lemon extract so, I used the zest of a lemon and the juice of half the lemon instead. I also used 1 tsp of vanilla extract and I left the cranberries whole and excluded the almonds. I have always enjoyed orange cranberry muffins now I'm a fan of the lemon as well. I def plan to make again and also try the recipe using blueberries.

I've made this several times and it's always a winner. I use real buttermilk and lemon juice when I have them -- this really helps the flavor. In a pinch, dried cranberries work just fine. My mother-in-law asks for these when they come to visit and thinks I'm a great cook. That's a win!

Sprinkle some turbinado sugar on top for a sweet and tasty crunch!  My family loved these as my husband's friend who dropped by.  We made them with dried cranberries and that worked just as well!  YUM!

These didn't taste anything special to me. Maybe because I substituted blueberry craisins for fresh cranberries? I don't think that I will make this again.

This is a great recipe!  It is easy to change the fruit to make orange with blueberry, lemon/blueberry or cranberry/orange.  My family loves them and I've even made them dairy-free by subbing soy milk for the milk.  Great for lunches.

I wanted to love these muffins--but....This recipe is missing something.  It is a little too cakey and tart.  Perhaps a crumble w/brown sugar and chopped nuts on top would do it.  Or, the lemon glaze in the customized version.  I would never bother with the basic recipe again.

These muffins had a very good taste. The cranberries I used were very tart though. I wish I would have tested to see how tart they were before using them. Other than that I loved the lemon flavor in the muffins very light and fluffy also :)

I couldn't help noticing while these were baking, how pretty they looked.  These are some great looking muffins.  They rose up beautifully and the almonds on top add a little crunch to the finished muffin.  They do lack in the lemon flavor, though.  I think I probably would have added some zest, but didn't have a lemon on hand at the time.  Next time, will add some zest and then they will be perfect!

Absolutely the best muffin!! I had been buying these every morning and decided to make some as it was getting a little expensive.  Taste better than the ones I was buying.  I did make a few changes as suggested by others.  I used a real lemon juice and zest from the lemon as well I used some applesauce in place of the oil.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Never fails - awesome recipe.  I would suggest adding more lemon flavour by washing two lemons - grating the zest and adding that to the mixture.  (Just the yellow part - the white rind is bitter)  I also squeeze the juice from the two lemons into the batter.

Great tasty recipe! I made a few changes though, I added lemon zest for more flavor and I would recommend adding the flour slowly as mine turned out dry.  You can always add but you can never take it away!

My kids (especially son) love this! The recipe is easy enough that all of them can help me make it quickly. Usually I'll put 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt instead of 1 cup milk. I skip the almonds so that the kids can take this to school and I'll put a big juicy raspberry in the middle instead. This recipe is my go-to muffin recipe -- the only one my kids keep requesting.

Delicious!! I used dried cranberries, lemon zest from a whole lemon and sprinkled raw sugar on top instead of almonds.  I also tripled the recipe and used 2 c white sugar, 1 c brown sugar.  They are soft and very flavorful! Will definately make this again and again!

lovely muffins! Full of flavour! Made a couple adjustments as suggested by another person (used 1/4 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce, a little less sugar, and zest and juice from a fresh lemon) and it was VERY tasty!

Great recipe! I used fresh cranberries and I didn't cut them in half, I will next time I make them maybe it will help them not sink to the bottom of the muffin, I didn't have slivered almonds availble so I just chopped up whole almonds and barely toasted, I didn't want them to burn in the oven.

Used 3/4 c whole wheat and 3/4c all-purpose flour, 1/2c yogurt butter substitute, orange extract and peel and blueberries instead of cranberries. My very picky hubby ate 4! in one sitting! May add an extra egg for moistness next time.

Great, easy recipe with delicious results! This was definitely the easiest recipe I've followed that didn't include a box of pre-made cafe mix :) I didn't have lemon extract so I used juice instead, worked fine, or almonds so I just skipped those but will add in next time I make these. The batter was a little soupy so I thought I did something wrong but they turned out perfect. Very pretty too! Thank you for sharing.

Fantastic recipe! I didn't change a thing and the muffins came out perfect; they received raves at the Christmas party last night. I've made a LOT of muffins before and these came out the best of any. Good texture, great shape, rose well, tasted awesome.   Perhaps the only thing noteworthy was there was enough batter to make 14 and not 12, and I have a standard-size muffin pan. Not sure what's up with that.

Delicious! I followed the recipe, using the suggestion of substituting the zest and juice of one fresh lemon instead of the extract. They came out perfectly citrusy and moist.  A big hit!  They keep very well and do not dry out.  We all agree they taste like Christmas, and I will be making them again for Christmas breakfast :).

I made these without almonds and without lemon extract. I did add the juice of one lemon and a little bit of zest, also a 1/2 tsp of almond extract. They have a bright flavor, soft texture, and are tart. They pair nice with a cup of coffee, and are very unique. However tart isn't really a flavorful I go for so I probably won't make this again. I just happened to have the ingredients on hand.

These were a breeze to throw together and tasted good, but they didn't blow me away.  I subbed soymilk for milk, craisins for cranberries and topped with sugar instead of almonds (what I had on hand).  Baked at 400 for exactly 18 min.  Recipe yielded 17 muffins.

it was okay. id use it again as a base recipe, but id add a little spice or something to it (or use craisins). for us, the muffin part was plain with hunks of too tart cranberry, just not our flavor. but they made great moist muffins, so im willing to play around with it next time

This recipe is perfect for a not-so-ordinary breakfast or snack!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using dried cranberries instead of fresh; and I added some orange zest, simply because I had some on-hand and sprinkled the top with oats for a little fiber.  I'd like to try adding a few white chocolate chips for a major treat some time!  Thanks for sharing.  :-)

Really good.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added lemon juice and lemon zest.  Very tasty.  I used fresh cranberries and didn't think to test them for tartness before adding them in to the mix.  They were very tart, making the overall muffin too sour for my taste.  No problem, I just whipped up a quick lemon glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar and they were absolutely perfect!  Even my kids loved them.

This was a great recipe.  I changed it a bit since I had a can of whole cranberry sauce that we bought by mistake.  Not wanting to waste it.  I used it in this recipe.  I increased flour to 3 cups and sugar to 1.5 cups, 4.5 teaspoons baking powder and 1t salt.  Everything else the same and it was wonderful.  Will do again and this time will by the whole cranberry sauce on purpose!

Thought these muffins were great!  I chopped my cranberries in a chopper smaller pieces were better.  I also used a lemon & rinds and squeezed the juice from it this was really good too but it also was good with out the rinds/juice.\
Great recipe!

This a great recipe.  I didn't have any lemon extract so I used the rinds of two lemons, plus adding two tbsp of lemon juice.  Also, subsituted dried cranberries for the fresh.  I made a lemon glaze and brushed it on the muffins once they came out of the oven.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious muffins! I made them a bit healthier by using whole wheat flour and brown sugar. They probably weren't a moist with the substitutions, but very yummy nonetheless.

These were good.  I was curious about cranberry muffins.  I didn't like the cranberry, but would substitute dried cherries or blueberries next time. 
  I added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract.
  Baked at 350
They came out beautifully.

Very nice! I was out of milk so substituted plain yogurt with some fresh-squeezed lemon + rind. 
Good recipe.

These were good - but not quite like the lemon-cranberry muffins I pick up at the store.  I have 3 issues with this muffin. For starters, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup - this, I figured, would leave room for the white chocolate chips I so love and have been adding to most muffins I make.  Despite the sweetness of the chocolate, the muffins were not as sweet as their store bought counterparts. Secondly, the baked muffin was not of perfect consistency (not enough bubbles - too dense...and yes, I made sure not to over-stir, just until moistened). Perhaps adding a little baking soda will help lighten up the dough.  If you do decide to add baking soda, make sure you use buttermilk or use the juice of a lemon (B.S. will not react unless there is an acid ingredient in your batter). This brings me to my third point.  The muffin was not tart and lemony.  It was rather plain tasting and the only lemon flavor was a hint of extract that tasted very much like extract - that is: FAKE. I would use the zest and  juice of a lemon - perhaps even a little more.  I will try out with these modifications (using the full cup of sugar, lemon zest and juice and adding 1tsp baking soda) and let you know.

These turned out really gummy and tough for me... I don't think I over mixed the recipe  either. I guess something went wrong...

These muffins were very good. My boyfriend ate 5 in a row! i tried to make them lighter by using vanilla yogurt instead of oil. i also used dried cranberries and 2 teaspoons of lemon extract instead of one to give them more taste. mmmm!

These muffins where good but not great. The taste is sweet but a lttle bland, and the muffins did not rise much at all. next time I might add some baking soda so they turn out more light and fluffy.

Ummm a bit disappointed with these muffins, unfortunately I found that they were lacking in flavor. I will probably try them again though as I do love cranberry and lemon together.

The batter came out really wet, like another poster mentioned.  I thought that they weren't overly sweet, perhaps some powdered sugar or granulated sugar on top instead of the almonds would be pretty. I will probably use 3/4c. milk the next time around.  I also decreased the oven to 375 and increased the time till they were brown. 400 degree oven seemed to high, and I didn't want them to burn and not cook on the inside.
