Pretty good! I've made this exactly a few times, but have to say a few mods. made it even better.  Here are my changes:

-**Use only about 1/2 to 3/4 amount of suggested beans, otherwise it gets to be rather beany tasting and overpowers other flavors.

-I don't like green peppers, so I just use red and yellow.  It's glorious.

-Make sure to use fresh pineapple--cut pineapple up and leave in the fridge for a while before serving.  This way it drains a bit and you can use the excess juice in addition to the OJ.

-I also add fresh mango and a five or so baby tomatoes.  

-also very nice on crackers

This is the best recipe!!! It is a really great summer dish and has a nice fresh test. Make sure that you only try this recipe if you like cilantro and cumin...it really comes through. I've also found that canned pineapples will work if you are unable to get fresh. This also tastes great over greens, the possibilities are endless.

I love this - it is crunchy, sweet, spicy - like a CIRCUS IN YOUR MOUTH!!  I make a double batch every time I make it.  I love cilantro so I usually double the amount and kick up the cumin a bit, too.  This is great as a side salad or for chip-dipping.  We also roll it up in tortillas with seasoned meat.  I've made it several times and have even tried with mango instead of pineapple which is also SO good!

This was fantastic!  I found this recipe on my allrecipes app on my phone and had to login to review it!  I did add some fresh lime juice, but kept everything else the same.  I could eat this by itself, and did while my chicken was cooking.  It is so light and fresh and crisp and tart and sweet!  My husband tasted it and immediately scooped some in a bowl to eat with chips as an appetizer.  This is definitely something to serve for Cinco de Mayo, for guests, or just as a light and satisfying complement to a meal.  Honestly, if I was a vegetarian, I would probably eat this by the bowlful!   But I do have to say, the lime juice is what made it perfect to me.  I read the recipe four times because I thought for sure there should be lime juice.

I left out the corn & black beans.  Served it with Kalua Pork, and it was good.  I think it would be delicious on grilled chicken or fish.

I absolutely loved it. Outstanding! I didn't change one bit and it turned out perfect. When I was buying mangos, they only had the not-so-ripe ones and it actually turned out better as the pieces weren't mushy. Enjoy!

added this as a topping/side over smoked ribs with a barbeque sauce using Capt.Morgan's Rum.  Enough flavors and texture to keep you going for a month...was a rave by all that had it (nope, no leftovers at all...)

Only put beans in it if you want to completely ruin it.  I am not sure why anyone would put beans in this recipe, they do not go with the other ingredients.  Made it with the beans and it was not to my liking.  No one would eat it.  Made it again without and everyone loved it.

I loved the flavors in this, but think lime juice would have worked better.  I had already added the oj, so I just grated in some lime zest, which helped give the sharp flavor I was looking for.

Excellent.  Nutritious.  Easy.  I served over grilled chicken that was marinated in a lemon juice mixture.  Perfect together.  I used only orange bell pepper because that is what I had on hand and it tasted fine but green and red will present a little better. I did not use all of the 15oz of beans because I felt the mixture would be over-powered by them and I was right.  I used about 2/3 of the can and it was perfect.  Anymore and it would be 'black-bean salsa' rather than pineapple salsa. Perfect for summer!

We made this to go over grilled chicken, and it was very good. I think for our own personal taste I will use less beans next time (and I do love black beans). I just liked the other flavors better and wanted more of them! Hubby even said he'd like this as a side dish. Will be making again!

Made it as is.  Very fast and easy to make.  A lot of great healthy ingredients.  My entire family loved it - husband and kids. Thanks for sharing.  Made it with 'Unbelievable Chicken" from this site. (Which was moist and YUMMY.)

This is very similar to my tried and true corn slaw (minus the pineapple and cilantro.) I'll make it your way next time I have fresh pineapple and use it as a side dish. Sounds yummy--sweet, spicy, and crunchy.   My pineapple salsa has only the fruit, cilantro, red onion, and serrano chili. I serve it over fish on a bed of wilted spinach with brown rice.   Thanks for the recipe and lovely pic!

This wasn't terrible but it wasn't great.  It was a little flavorless, I had to add some cayenne.  Fresh pineapple is very expensive where I live so I used canned and maybe that was part of the problem.

Terrific. So EASY to make. I had all ingredients except black beans so I used cannellini. Also used 1/2 jalapeno instead of the green chili peppers (wasn't sure what that meant, anyway). Every thing else was followed to the letter. Nice side to Cardamom Chicken w/ Salt & Pepper Crust.

I love pineapple and I love salsa. This is divine over fish, as a side with plain rice, over plain salad. Simple and delicious.

I made this exactly as written, and it was great served over chicken breasts grilled with cajun seasoning.  I took the leftovers to work with chips, and my co-workers raved!  Thanks for the great, refreshing combination of flavors.

This was my first time making a salsa and it was really really good. I didn't use the orange juice, but instead added about 1 tsp of lemon juice. I will definitely make this again. My boyfriend liked it too.

I served this over marinated salmon and my partner and I absolutely loved it.  The sweet salmon and tangy/salty salsa was a hit.  A wonderful meal and not too heavy.  This will become a regular for us.

great salsa, however I use fresh corn on the cob and grill it first, skip the oj and just use the pineapple juice from the fresh pineapple and squease either  lemon or lime in it(to taste). avacado is also a great addition. goes great with fish tacos, and many other dishes.

This makes quite a lot of salsa, which was good as we had probably 25 or so ppl here for supper.  My only differences were canned corn, no chili peppers but I had some other kind of mild pepper.  Ppl kept going back for more.  Nothing left.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this salsa was awesome!! I made it to put on pork carnitas on this site and fish tacos. I made it exactly to the recipe, but next time I might cut back on the black beans like someone else recommended.

I used red lentils instead of the black beans.  This is a little too sweet with the orange juice and the pineapple, so I think I will use lime juice instead of the orange juice next time.  Great taste!

This is absolutely terrific! Served it as a side along with Chili Lime Chicken (recipe also from this site). I did scaled down the chili as I was afraid it woul be too hot but it turned out just great. Amazing blend of flavors, will definetly be making this again!

Sweet, spicy and delicious! Next time I will leave out the corn and black beans when pairing it with fish (or any meat). The beans and corn work well in it as a dip for tortilla chips.

Loved this!  Needed a last minute salsa for some fish, this was quick & easy.  Didn't have the chiles or green peppers, just added extra red.  Also used extra pineapple juice from the can (in the future, I just won't use the orange - tasted fine, but just easier with the pineapple).  Will definitely make again!

I added 1 tsp of lime juice to give the flavors more kick. And, I didn't have chili peppers so I used canned jalapenos instead. Very good!

I omitted the corn and beans, substituted lime juice for orange juice, and substituted fresh jalapeño peppers instead of the green chiles and it was delicious! We ate it over burgers and loved every bite!

This is good, I made it exactly as written then thought it needed "something" to zing it up so I added a little italian dressing.  We all agreed it's much better with it!  Next time I'd take other reviewers advice and cut back on the black beans.

This was just ok.  I give it 2 stars because all you really taste is all the black beans.  It was not as full of flavor as you would expect.  I have had much better than this.

I made this salsa last night and served along side Salsa Chicken and Mexican Sour Cream Rice (both from this site) and both my DH and I really enjoyed it.  I made a few minor changes (omitted the green pepper as I'm not a fan and I used picked jalepeno instead of fresh).  We really enjoyed it...it's even good as a side dish!

The black beans overwhelmed this recipe. Next time I make it I will use less when I intend it to be a salsa.  If keeping the recipe as written, I'll add cooked rice and make it a cold salad.

this was a nice light snack.. i had to leave out the corn b/c i didn't have any and i subbed the orange juice with half pineapple and half lime juice.. tripled the cumin and probably doubled the cilantro.. added some chopped tomato.. also cut the beans in half as suggested by Jennifer Juniper.. used a couple of baby jalapeno's from our little plant.. left the seeds in one of them.. it added just the right amount of kick.. me and bf enjoyed this with tortilla chips.. ty for the recipe

I didn't use corn but I did add a little garlic. Sort of lacks any real flavor overall but with a few additions of salt, vinegar, pepper and lemon juice, that seems to help. I also did a trio of peppers for color. Overall good.

This was exactly what I was looking for. It was very tasty and I will definitely be making this again. I served it over grilled chicken and yellow rice as a side. Perfect! The only thing I did different was add a chopped tomato.

I followed the recipe as stated (except I used one green chili pepper instead of two because that is what I had on hand) and I was really disappointed with the results.  I was expecting a very flavorful salsa but instead it was quite bland and the flavors hadn't blended at all - even though I prepared it several hours in advance.  I made it to pair with grilled chicken and possibly use any leftovers as a dip with corn chips.  However, we barely ate any of the salsa with dinner. 
I really like the concept so I will probably try it one more time and see if maybe it turns out differently, but for now it just gets a 2 star rating.

Wow.  Wish I'd read the more negative reviews first, as I agree with many that the black beans overwhelm the other ingredients. I may try it again, but I will definitely omit the black beans AND the orange juice and add some fresh lime juice instead.  Will probably double the fresh pineapple too.

I am not domesticated at all and this recipe was easy and fabulous. I wanted to make it as kid friendly as possible so I added a mango, used yellow instead of green bell pepper, left out cumin, onion and chili peppers and only used a speck of cilantro. In my own serving I added chili powder. My kids actually ate black beans!! I thought the beans were great, and I love that I got peppers and beans into my picky eaters (husband included!)

I made this recipe for a salsa contest at work. It went up against 5 other 'traditional' salsas with tomatoes. It won the contest. It is sooo fresh and clean tasting!

This recipe is a good start, but not great as is. First of all, the orange juice makes the whole thing taste like dessert because it's much too sweet. The pineapple is plenty sweet as is. Lime is a must and I added the juice of two. I might even add lime zest next time to increase that citrus-y element that makes salsa good. It also needed garlic because flavors this fresh need some warmer elements for balance. I added garlic powder to taste, which made this a four star recipe along with the lime. I did not add corn or beans because I don't like those ingredients in salsa. This is a good base recipe that becomes great with some tweaking.

There's no need to look further for a great pineapple salsa.  Genius mixture!!  For the person who said it was too 'beany', you need to rinse the beans in a colander until all the sauce comes off.  Don't just rinse them in the can or there will still be murky sauce discoloring the mix.  I made it as described then made the following changes: white and green parts of scallion thinly sliced instead of the onion, doubled the pineapple, and also added the juice that the fresh pineapple spears were sitting in to the mix (still kept the OJ).  I didn't thaw the corn as it immediately thawed when I stirred the mix and chilled everything.  For the chiles, I used finely minced jalapenos with the seeds and ribs removed and it was still a little spicy -not too much for me but someone thought it was too much for them.

I still prefer cowboy caviar. If I ever make this again, I will: cut down the cumin to 1/4 tsp. Fold in the black beans last. Too much stirring causes them to fall apart. I used a fresh jalapeno instead of chiles, just because it came directly from my garden. I think I might substitute mango or black-eyed peas for the beans next time.

I made this for a small dinner party and served it as a side dish.  Everyone raved and even pressed into sharing this recipe(What a delightful problem). This is so bursting with flavor, so refreshing and unigue. This will be a "regular" special dish. Thank YOU!

I followed the recipe. Used it for a fall function for a group of about 30.  
I used jalapeno instead of chili peppers and only half as much.  

The folks who tried it loved it and the left-overs lasted a week.

The amount of the ingredients of cilantro,black beans and onions in this recipe are overpowering the rest of the ingredients. I cut  those ingredients to tsp. The beans I put in was 1\3 of the can. I also put in chopped cherry tomatoes. I used lemon juice instead of oj. Use whatever kind of jar peppers you have. I used banana rings.
I gave it 3 stars because of all the changes I needed to make,but the ingredients were Good together.

I made it as is and it was delicious!  The sweetness of the pineapple and fresh squeezed orange juice complemented the jalapenos and peppers.  Great idea to serve with chips while grilling.  It doubled as an appetizer and my family loved it.

WOW. Made this as a side to grilled Salmon. Absolutely delicious, cool, refreshing and best of all easy and fast.
Added some fresh peaches which was another nice sweetness to the dish. We will be visiting this dish often this summer.

I tried the pineapple pesto for two reasons. The first reason was I had a pineapple to hand and the second reason because I am a fan of spicy food with a bite I wanted to make and try something different to enjoy and add to my repertoire.

This salsa hit the mark and gave a different dimension with the added beans. 

Very tasty and an exciting accompniment to many a main dish.

Definitely a future favourite!

This is a PHENOMENAL recipe!  I've made this using both canned corn and leftover corn on the cob rather than frozen.  Definitely a keeper!  I have served with tortilla chips and on fish tacos with a simple slaw, would also be great with chicken!  I up the cumin a tad and add a Tbsp or so of lime juice and a couple of dashes of chipotle powder, and sometimes up the pineapple.

I have made this several times now. It is a wonderful side dish, full of the flavors of Hawaii. I have had it with barbecued chicken and with salmon steaks. It's a great side dish for a potluck dinner such as a barbecue and with the jalapenos seeded, it has just the right amount of heat. One of my favorites!

This salsa is great!  I like how the cilantro really comes through. I don't like spicy foods, so I didn't make mine with chili peppers and just used a bunch of different colored bell peppers instead.

I subbed lemon juice for the o.j., used jalapenos for the green chiles and went easy on the beans and corn per other reviewers.  This looks very pretty and is perfect with Pastamore's coconut almond tilapia and some brown rice.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I love this, not so much as a salsa by itself, but I use it as a topping over chicken breasts.  So easy, delicious and healthy.  Definitely a go to for me

My husband really loved this...I like that the measurements do not have to be precise...I left out the cilantro (hate it!) and the hot peppers and used only about a half recipe...this was plenty for 2. Served it with grilled boneless skinless chicken breasts and jasmine rice.

Loved it! Made it just as written and it was perfect.
