Super fresh and clean ingredients, but I used beer instead of wine (corona) less limes as well, then i seasoned the outside with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cajun seasoning. I put cilantro, limes, garlic in the cavity and used two limes to squeeze on top and put fresh cilantro and garlic and slow cooked for 6 hours! amazing! FOLLOW THIS

My family devoured the chicken. I did omit the wine. I would have used chicken broth instead but felt it wasn't needed. The chicken produces a ton of juice while cooking. I also did not use 8 limes. For cooking I used 4... 16 lime quarters and then I quartered 2 more so my family could add as much or as little lime as they wanted.

Limes left a bitter taste.  Would be better with just juice.

Chicken is bland and too limey, but not in a good way. I would omit lime wedges and just use juice and use chicken breasts instead and spice it up with some cumin or other spices.

I really love this recipe. I have to agree with all the other reviews - too much lime.  I modified by keeping the lime juice but reducing the number of the wedge 1/4 peels I added to the recipe. I put 2 wedges inside the chicken and one outside for less than 1 full lime but all 8 limes of juice. The other suggestion I have is to rub the garlic, salt and other spices under the skin on the outside of the chicken. Enjoy!

My son ate more of this chicken than I've ever seen him eat in one sitting.  It was a bit bland, so I'll add more seasonings next time.  Used fewer limes, and skipped the broth and wine.

I love cilantro and lime, and am amazed at how good this came out after a day in the slow cooker.
