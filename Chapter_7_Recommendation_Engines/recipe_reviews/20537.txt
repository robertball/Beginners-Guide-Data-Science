Very refreshing and good for our 4th of July party.  I mixed up the juice mixture in a pitcher to make it easier to make multiple drinks.  I also used lemonade and limeade concentrate as at first it seemed to need a little more spark.

This was ok, nothing spectacular. I made up 4 drinks in a pitcher and made exactly as directed. I couldn't taste the lime juice at all so didn't think it was worth adding, and the small amounted of carbonated water did nothing for the drink other than making it seem like it had been sitting for a bit and gone flat. I would either remove it altogether and have a still drink, or increase the amount drastically to have a partially carbonated drink that didn't seem like it had gone flat. Probably won't make again and just stick to my usual vodka, cranberry juice and Sprite combo.
