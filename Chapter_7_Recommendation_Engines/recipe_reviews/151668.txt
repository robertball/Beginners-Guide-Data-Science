I had never made a jelly roll before and was worried it might be complicated or that the cake would fall apart with the slightest touch. I was very pleasantly surprised. I made this recipe as is and it turned out wonderfully. Very easy and fast! The kids loved the peanut butter and jam flavor more so than the adults, but I am looking forward to trying different fillings. This cake recipe is a perfect jelly roll texture :)

This was good.  My family enjoyed this.  I didn't make any changes trying this for the first but you could choose many different fillings for this.  The bake time in the recipe was slightly off for my oven, I checked it at 10 minutes and then added another 5 minutes to the time, this is when I took it out, but I probably could have left it in another few minutes.

This is a very easy recipe, however, I felt that the almond extract was very overpowering and I did not taste the pbj.  Next time I will delete the almond extract.

YUM! This recipe was excellent! Instead of 1 cup flour I used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup baking cocoa.

Then for the filling I used milk chocolate Betty Crocker icing. It was yum!!!

Absolutely delicious. I didn't do a great job rolling it, and it stuck a bit, but that's because I was trying out a silicone mat for the first time and used that instead of the 'prepared towel'. Had I stuck to the recipe's instructions I'm sure it would've turned out better! But it still looks half-decent, and it tastes AMAZING.

The cake recipe is fine (I subbed vanilla extract for the almond), but the directions are vague. I remembered my Aunt making jelly rolls, and rolling the cake WITH the towel rolled in it. I looked in Betty Crocker's cookbook, and got better directions (and the same recipe, minus one egg.) Also, like with anything you roll-up, you shouldn't spread the filling to the end, it'll just squish out the end and make your cake messy.

This was actually pretty simple to make. I'm not very impressed with the taste. It tasted like a PB&J sandwich

I used raspberry preserves and almond butter with almond and raspberry extracts in the filling and almond extract in the cake.  I might mix extracts in the cake as the almond extract took the lead, which I love, but others might want the fruit to be the standout flavor.
