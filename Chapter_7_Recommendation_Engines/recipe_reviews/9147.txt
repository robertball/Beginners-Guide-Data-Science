This recipe is fantastic!  The savory and sweet mix is wonderful, and I get upset when my guests eat it all (no leftovers for me).  It surprisingly freezes well.  I have been recruited to make this for my friend's yearly Canadian Thanksgiving.  I decided to change it up a little bit.  I cut the fat by only using 2 tbsp of butter, and two cups of vegetable broth.  Still tasted wonderful.  I also couldn't find any tarragon at the store, so I substituted sage.

Once a month, we get together with my sister's family and have a cooking night with a theme.  This most recent theme was pumpkin.  This recipe intrigued me, so I just had to make it.  I used Pumpkin Bread IV from this site.  I made a few minor changes, all because it was what I had on hand or I couldn't find it in the store.  I used white onion instead of red, white mushrooms instead of crimini, and used all dried herbs.  I also added more chicken broth since my bread cubes were really hard.  The dish was sweet and savory, definitely different, but very good.  I would like to make again.

I am giving this five stars for a perfect mix of herbs for the project, but I will make one change next time.  I will cut down on the sugar in my pumpkin bread recipe to accomodate this recipe.  It was INCREDIBLY good, but I feel like it was just a little too sweet for the Christmas dinner that it accompanied.  That was not the fault of this recipe-it had to do with my bread recipe.

This stuffing is amazing. I'm eating leftovers for lunch again. I mixed together pumpkin bread batter and corn bread batter to make the bread, just because everyone was out of pumpkin bread, and it tasted awesome. I think it helped make it a little less sweet also, so that might help those who don't want it too sweet. Great recipe!

I really liked this recipe.  I didn't have any mushrooms so I used some craisins instead and it turned out great!  It's a sweet and very flavorful stuffing.  I think this is my new stuffing recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I had to omit the onions per my guests request and it was still wonderful.  Next time I will make smaller bread cubes though.  I had made the cubes the size of croutons and could have gone smaller.  I'm so happy I found this recipe!

This is now my new favorite stuffing I will make if for all holiday/family get togethers.  The mushrooms make it so tasty.  If you bake your own pumpkin bread it can be pretty time consuming, so plan in advance, but it is well worth it.
