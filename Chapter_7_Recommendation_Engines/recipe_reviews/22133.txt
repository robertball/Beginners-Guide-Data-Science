Flavor was great. However, if using dry beans, make sure to soak them overnight before adding them or they will still be hard after you're done cooking (The recipe didn't say to do that). My husband raved about it - after I figured out that I needed to soak the beans first that is ;)

We love this chili and have received rave reviews from friends and family.  I substituted the kidney beans for pinto beans and added some cumin.  This chili is very easy to make.

I want to say this is a really great recipe but I made alot of changes to it. First I used a lb of ground turkey in place of the 1/2 lb of ground beef. I also added a sizable amount of chili powder and cumin, left out the italian seasoning, and added a package of chili seasoning. I left out the beef broth, I think it would have made it too soupy. I also used canned kidney beans. With all of these alterations, the recipe was awesome, my fiance and I both loved it.

For me it took about 3 hours for the stewing steak to be melt-in-the-mouth tender. I also added way more fresh minced garlic. I don't recommend cooking it uncovered - mine was covered, and I still ended up having to add some tomato juice so it didn't dry out. Anyway, this is good stuff. Thanks, Shawn and Jeff!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this chili! It was mild enough the kids enjoyed it, but not bland.  I did omit the pepper due to family preference.  I think this will be my "go-to" chili recipe!

Wow.. This is one of the best chili recipe! :) My husband and I loved it. I couldn't find dried kidney beans, so, I used a can of kidney beans instead. It turned out to be very good. Thank you for sharing this recipe :)

So much better than chili with canned beans! I used a full pound of ground beef, instead of adding 1/2 lb of stew meat. I used freshly canned tomatoes and added a little extra beef broth. Since it was still a tad thin for out taste, I added a small can of tomato paste. As per other reviewers I soaked the beans overnight in a pot of water. Oh yeah... Keep the lid on the pot when simmering (unless you like SUPER thick chili).

I liked this a lot and so did my family.  I cut way down on the chili powder for my toddlers sake and added some onion powder, garlic salt and a bit more italian seasoning than it called for.  Thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful!!!! I used buffalo stew meat and regular ground beef. I also added a can of tomato paste to help thicken it up, but those are the only changes I made and it wasn't too soupy and was seasoned perfectly.

I have been making chili from scratch most of my life and this chili beats any I have tried. I substituted soyrizo for the ground beef to give it a little extra zing.

I had to use what was on hand but perhaps I shouldn't have. I used diced vs crushed tomato's, and I used pinto beans. I am a horrible cook so I can't fix things if they don't lean in the right direction. For example, this seemed more like a bean soup vs a chili. Very tasty, but not quite a chili like I think of it. That said, I find it hard to find recipes on here that actually use dry beans! Wow. Even though I already spent considerable time, I may keep searching. I don't like looking a vid recipes so that may limit me.

It was good, but there was too much brown sugar for our tastes.  I ended up adding a can of tomato paste to try and cut the sweetness without much success.  I'll make it again, but will cut the sugar in half, add some cumin and maybe 1/2 teaspoon of tabasco for a little heat.

This was good, although not terribly memorable as far as chilis go. Admittedly, I didn't add the stew beef (I used only ground beef) but I don't think that would have altered the flavor profile substantially, just the texture. I'd make it again, but I also plan to keep experimenting and searching.

Great tomato type based chili.  It was exactly what I was looking for.
