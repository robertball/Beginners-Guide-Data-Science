Delicious! I added diced Chicken Breast and made a meal of it. Instead of chopping cabbage, I bought a bag of shredded cole slaw cabbage which made this recipe so easy to throw together on a busy weeknight. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is great!  The blend of the ingredients makes a perfect side dish.  I have made it several times and followed the recipe, it doesn't need any changes.  Thanks!,

This is a good recipe - I didn't have red onion so I used white onion.  A nice change of pace for cabbage using the soy and the pepper sauce.

Easy and yummy!  Had pancetta we needed to use. Followed the recipe, and used a little less Tamari as we did not have lite soy sauce. A little Sriracha at the table, and it was great. Could easily serve over rice to extend further. Will definitely make again, and will try variations. Thank you for helping me make dinner!

I loved this easy to make, tasty dish. This could also be made with Chinese cabbage, scallions, garlic, 1/2 c of chicken stock (Reserve 1/4 cup of  stock and make a slurry with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch).  Mix slurry to the stir fry to thicken to taste.
Either way, ...yum.

Followed the recipe exactly , big mistake, the pancetta has salt in it and soy has a salty taste so why would you add another 1/2 tsp. of salt? No one could eat it, ti was way too salty.

Didn't have red onion so used white. Added a bit of diced leftover pork tenderloin and a thin slice of Spanish chorizo, also diced. Served it over some warmed up leftover barley, was very pleased with the results. Great autumn dish!

Yummy! Liked by everyone. Clean plates and no complaints!
Simple, tasty and adjustable. Minus the hot sauce but that's just the way I like it.
