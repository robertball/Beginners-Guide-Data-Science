This refreshing salad is great on the hottest summer days. It makes a colorful and pretty presentation when put in a glass bowl. I was suprised how much young children enjoyed the dressing that goes with the salad.

A good salad.  I just made it at wrong time of the year. Strawberries and nectarines are just not very tasty this late in the season. I bet this will be delicious about next August.

I have fixed this salad for two different groups of women and all have decided it is a "keeper".

I gave this 4 stars only because my husband was so so on it.  My daughter and I loved it and will have it often. It looked so pretty in a glass bowl.

I found the dressing pungent and the salad got watery, my family hated it. I was worried about mayo and sour cream but tried it, and it was not so good. Maybe yogurt next time.

This was an okay salad. I didn't like the mayo based dressing though. This didn't have enough spices or other things to mask the mayo flavor for my tastes, but I am not a mayo fan. I doubt I'll make this again. Thanks anyway, it was fun trying out a new recipe.

we enjoyed this salad as a side dish to our easter feast.  due to the time of year, i nixed the peaches and added mandarin oranges instead (to keep the orange color), and also added blackberries.  i cut the cheese into cubes instead of using shredded cheddar, and for the dressing, used 1/3c each of light mayo, reduced fat sour cream, and fat free greek yogurt.  using the lighter ingredients did not seem to have any adverse effect on the taste, as we all agreed it was cvery good, however it may have thinned it out a bit.  overall a very delicious salad, that was a colorful and healthy addition to our easter dinner!  thanks for posting!

Followed this almost 100% and was surprised it was so good.  This was not sweet at all except for the natural sweetness of the fruit.  The only thing the honey does is make the sour cream slightly less sour which is genius because you can add or remove as you like making it sweeter or more savory.  I did add a few red raspberries on one layer having a few left which added a little more of a tart flavor.  Perfect accompaniment to chicken and steak on the grill and was delicious the next day for lunch at work.  Might be good without the lettuce though it does add great texture.  Delicious!
