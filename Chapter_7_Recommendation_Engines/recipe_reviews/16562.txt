A very good recipe.  It takes a little more time to gather all the ingredients but once you have them it is very easy to make.  It's great as a side to dinner or can even be dinner itself.

This casserole needed a little more *zing*, so I added 1 more TBS. lemon juice.  I also dusted the top with more sliced almonds.  It made it more appetizing than crushed chips.

My mother made something very similar, except I remember hers included some poultry seasoning.  My version turned out quite good considering all of the substitutions I made - a little bit of this and a little bit of that to be cleaned out of my refrigerator.  I used deli mesquite chicken, roasted red peppers, chopped artichoke hearts, green onions, and cashews, folded in the mayo/lemon juice mixture and topped with crushed potato chips & cheddar/mozzarella cheese.

I thought it was so-so. But being a single mom of 5, not one of my kids wanted a second bite so it's not worth me making it again.  I thought I had them with the chips on top but no way.

This was good - well-received. I wouldn't say I was blown away however. I roasted the chicken first with my standard method: olive oil, salt, white pepper, and celery salt. I doubled the reipce, and used slivered almonds instead of salted. Also, an orange pepper for color instead of green. It is a good base recipe to use and tweak.

I added some red pepper flakes to add a little kick (maybe 2 tsp.)  The kids did not like this dinner, but my husband and I loved it.  Thanks!

I did not add any type of pepper in this. I also added a can of cream of chicken and added extra cheese in with the chicken/almond mixture. I used cheddar cheese instead. At the end i topped it with a layer of cheese, chopped almonds, and then the chips

Very tasty.  Goes over well with everybody I've served it to.  You can change it in several ways according to your taste.  I usually skip the pimiento, and add extra cheese.  My sister makes this recipe using a cup of croutons stirred into the casserole and more on top, and she uses colby jack instead of the swiss. You can also add more onions if you like, or some different spices for flavor.  Leftover chicken is fine, or you can used canned. Even my kids will eat this one.  I never liked celery when I was younger, but I would eat this because it tasted yummy.

I used some garlic kettle cooked chips for something extra and it was delicious! I also substituted red bell pepper for the pimento. will definitely be making this again.

Made it again. Added rotini noodles and a smoked gouda potato chip. Mmmmmmm
