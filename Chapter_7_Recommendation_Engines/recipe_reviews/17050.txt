EVERYONE loved this!! From my picky husband and 4 year old son, to all my guests on Easter day. Have made it twice in the last week! Using advice from another reviewer, I didn't change a thing the first time and it was perfect. The second time, I tried it without the coconut. It is much better with the coconut IMHO! Also, 2 cups of bananas is 4 average-size bananas. This should help so you're not having to measure your bananas after they're mashed. I usually have a hard time not making my own little changes to a recipe...which is why I tried to change it the second time. Don't change a thing! This recipe is going to be my Christmas neighbor-gifts for next year! Very colorful and easy to make. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!
P.S. Added on 8/24/07, I have now made this recipe MANY times and here are a few more helpful tips (hopefully). First, this recipe will fill three of the aluminum loaf pans that you can purchase for gift giving. Also, the last time I made this I added ALOT of pineapple. That is a big mistake! It makes the bread too gooey, so if you experiment, this is not the ingredient to increase. And one last thing. At least when I bake this, it takes around 55 minutes to be done, at least. My oven is right on, temperature wise, too. ENJOY!!

OMG, OMG, OMG!  This is SO good! I've eaten almost a whole loaf myself! Gave hubby one piece, gave Daughter #1 a BITE, and I've eaten 2/3 of the first loaf all by my loansome!  So glad the recipe makes 2 loaves.  I didn't have any cherries so those were left out, and I did a cup of crushed-up macadamias in lieu of the nuts listed. Only had enough ugly bananas for 1-1/2 cups, and did the 1/2-and-1/2 on the white and brown sugar combo suggested by previous cooks.  Baked in 2 glass loaf pans for about 50 minutes. When I checked on them they passed the toothpick test so I pulled them out.  Upon slicing while still hot the middle was still kinda gooey and the top sank shortly after coming out of the oven.  I don't care!  It's too good.  Next time will add more coconut and pineapple. Oh, the only pineapple I had was the dehydrated stuff from Sam's so I chopped up that until it filled 1 cup. Will do maybe 1-1/2 cups of pineapple next time. I'm not making regular banana bread anymore, this is too dang good!

I made this twice, the first time I put in,oops, 16 oz. of pineapple and needed to bake it for an extra 10 minutes.  The second time I followed the recipe.  Both turned out great tasting and moist.  I stored it in the fridge, I think it was even better the next day.

Absolutely wonderful!!! I have been looking for a good recipe for this EXACT kind of bread! I didn't have any cherries, so those obviously got left out. Next time I'll be prepared. I made this in 5 mini loaf pans instead, and decreased the time to 55-60 min.  Just be sure to check the center as usual.  I also made a oatmeal, sugar, cinnamon struesel for the top, and it turned out sooooo yummmmmmmy!!!  Thanks again for this wonderful recipe that I will be using MANY times to come.  I'll be sure to share it with my Mommy/Toddler Playgroup too! PS. 2 Cups bananas = 4 reg. size bananas

I truly hope more people will try this absolutely 
Wun-der-ful banana bread!  I made 6 mini loaves to give as 'gifts'.  The only change I made was that I toasted my walnuts first and then I put my coconut in my chopper to make it finer.  I too think you could probably cut back 1/3 or even 1/2 a cup on the sugar and it would still be great.  My husband really did enjoy this one.

Surprisingly good.  Didn't think the coconut and banana would be good together.  I omitted the cherries and walnuts.

What can I say about this bread!  It is absolutely fabulous!  Very moist with excellent flavor.  I made muffins out of it, but I think it would make an excellent frosted cake as well.  The cherries add a festive touch.  Will definately make again

Absolutely great recipe.  The only thing we changed was, we used pecans instead of walnuts; it's a Southern thing, you know.

This is a great tasting bananna bread!! I make this about once a week for family/friends.  I actually add a whole 20 oz. can of drained crushed pineapple, use 1 1/2 cups oil (or if I want to do it lower fat use 3/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. unsweetened applesauce).  I eliminate the coconut and cherries for more of a traditional bananna bread with a twist.  I get so many requests for this recipe.  Thanks. Priscilla P.

Being born and raised here in Hawaii, I have had my fill of Banana Bread, but I came across this recipe, and at first thought, euuuu! maraschino cherries..is she nuts? HELLO, this was one winner of a recipe! My family loved it totally. So then I had to make a few more batches for my neighbors who all have the recipe now. I followed it to the letter, and didn't omit or add a thing and I used banana's that were on the verge of ending up in the disposal. The riper the better. If your bananas are turning black on the outside USE THEM! Thanks Saundra for sharing this great recipe!

I'm not much of a cook so when I saw this recipe and decided to try it I didn't think it would come out so good.  It was wonderful! My husband been bugging me to bake him something and when he tried this he just loved it.  What I liked most about this recipe was that it was simple.  It was almost like cooking for dummies!  It was also very most to my surprise.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was sweet enough for me, but then again I've got kinda of a sweet tooth.  I would recommend this to anyone!

Excellent bread!!! So yummy!!! I have been wanting to try a banana bread with pineapple and coconut ever since I was in Hawaii. It is sold on the islands. I found this one and was very happy. I made a few minor changes: Pecans instead of walnuts, and used half brown sugar. Skipped the cherries as I am not fond of maraschino cherries. I thought this bread was heavenly. Next time I will use half applesauce for the oil to cut down on fat, and probably use some whole wheat flour in the mix. I don't think it will affect the overall flavor of this  loaf of bread. If you like the ingredients in this recipe, I am quite sure you will be happy with the finished product.

I've made this bread twice.  The first time I made several changes based on what else I was making and what I thought would improve the recipe.  The bread was okay, but I thought it had greater potential.  The second time I made it as the recipe states and it was excellent.  Do not leave any of the ingredients out because they all contribute to the bread's excellent taste.  The only recommendation I would make is to use pineapple tidbits instead of crushed pineapple.  I did this on the second try because I thought the pineapple flavor got kind of lost with just the crushed pineapple.  You get more pineapple flavor when you can actually bite into a piece.

I took this bread as a snack for a church meeting last week. It was a big hit and was quickly scarfed down followed by requests for the recipe. Honestly, it's a five-star hit!! One thing though, I didn't use the maraschino cherries. I can't imagine that they would have made it any better. So moist and flavorful! Thanks, Saundra, for posting what will likely be my go-to recipe for banana bread!

This was absolutely the BEST!  It was so MOIST.  YUM!  The only thing I omitted was the coconut.  Also, I crushed 5 (Puerto Rican) Rum soaked pineapple rings in the blender to add instead of can crushed pineapple.  Fabulous recipe!  Thanks.

I've made banana bread for over 30 years and lately I've gotten tired of the taste.  I spotted this recipe and gave it a try.  I didn't have any vanilla so I substituted almond extract.  I also added a little extra pineapple and used less cherries.  This is absolutely delicious and moist!!!!!  I'm giving this as my holiday food gift to family and friends, along with the list of ingredients.  This will replace my long time recipe for banana bread.  Small loaves only took 30 min. to bake.  Won't last long enough to make it into the freezer.  Thank you.

After reading the ratings, I made this last night.  Followed recipe to a tee.  Tasted it when cooled and thought it was just ok.  Nothing more than that.  So I wrapped the loaves up in foil and went to bed.  This morning, I sliced a loaf to be served with breakfast and was I surprised!!!!!!! It was DELICIOUS !!!!!  Apparently this is one of those recipes that taste better the following day.  It is definitely a keeper and I will always make it the day before I plan to serve it. Don't make a single change . . . make it "as is".  You won't regret it.

OH MY!!!!! That's all I can say about this moist delicious bread! My girlfriends and I went to Hawaii in Jan. '06 and stopped and ate what we considered "Hawaii's Best Banana Bread" on The Road To Hana. This was a great replica of that, and they thought so to! We did omit the nuts and cherries as we are not big fans, but kept EVERYTHING ELSE the SAME! I only had one bread loaf pan, so used the rest of the batter for muffins and mini muffins. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Excellent recipe!  I use olive oil in place of vegetable oil, no cherries or coconut.  I use the small loaf pans and get 8 loaves from one batch.  The bread is moist and yummy and travels to Iraq & Afghanistan remaining moist!  My "kids" love it & always request it in their care packages.  Thanks for sharing, Saundra, you've made some very happy soldiers!!

This is really great "banana bread"!  I gave 4 stars only because its a bit messy and more involved than traditional banana bread -- but its certainly well worth the extra effort.  I did not think the bread was too sweet at all (like some reviewers) but I also realized that I forgot to put vanilla in the batter.  I didn't miss it at all until I reviewed the recipe again.  Maybe its the vanilla that accentuates the sweetness, so try leaving it out.  A wonderful recipe!!

Awesome crazy good! Bananas, coconut, pineapples, maraschino cherries and walnuts all in one? Oh My Goodness!!! This bread is everything-moist, flavorful, great texture, sweetened perfectly. The bread formed a brown color and baked up a nice shape. When sliced the specks of the bright red maraschino cherries makes for a pretty bread! (see my picture in photo gallery) The walnuts and cherries give a nice texture to the bread. The banana smell is fragrant and very tasty throughout each bite. I followed the recipe to a “T” and the batter filled two 9x5 loaf pans and baked up nicely in 1 hour. I could smell the wonderful aroma from the oven while the breads baked up. The directions, ingredients, baking time are all spot on! This was so easy to make. Even better? The results are wonderful-ONOlicious. I hope others will want to try this wonderful bread. This would make nice Christmas gifts which I plan to do this Holiday.

This was such good bread, very moist, with a lovely texture from the coconut and nuts.  To reduce calories I used applesauce instead of oil without any trouble and omitted the cherries.  I also added a little coconut extract. I used half brown sugar instead of all white. Next time I'll use part whole wheat flour and maybe some dried pineapple chunks. I've made a similar recipe with zucchini, which was equally good. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Yum!! So good and EVERYONE raved about them. I made them into muffins, baked at 350 for 25 minutes. I took the advice of another reviewer about the pineapples. I bought tidbits which were a bit too big so cut them into thirds which was perfect. I was a bit short on the bananas (takes more than 3!) and a bit short on the cherries so I just added a bit more pineapple to make sure it was moist enough and it came out PERFECT! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

We have not tasted it yet.  I just took two of them out of the oven & my house smells incredible.  I'm made banana nut bread since I was 8-12 & I'm going to be 65 this year.  But I just got tired of it.  I make it for friends, particularly during the holidays, but this would be a real nice kicked up version.  Can't wait for it to cool enough so we can taste it.  I'm going to give it a 4 until we taste it, but I tasted the batter & it was good enough to eat with a spoon.

This came out absolutely fantastically. I used toasted macadamia nuts but wish I'd used toasted walnuts like it specifies. I also toasted my coconut. I would make this again for sure, thanks for sharing!

Just not what we expected--the maraschino cherries overpowered everything, the coconut was not a good addition.

My whole family loved this. But I do have to say that I tweaked them to make them healthier. I used apple sauce instead of oil, dropped the coconut, lessened the sugar adding  only 1 cup white, and 1/2 cup dark brown,omitted the cherries, and put 4 mashed bananas. They really were great, was worried they would be dry, but not at all. Thank you for a great base, will make actual recipe for company.

I think it's good, but the consistency of the bread isn't the best I've made. My hubby on the other hand says this is his favorite banana bread, probably because he prefers the coconut in this over the chocolate chips in the banana split bread I like to make.

I have always loved banana bread and this was delicious. In fact I have made several more due to demand. People have also asked me for my recipe!!.I have made it both with and without coconut flakes,preferred without and like other suggestions I used 20oz can pineapple. I don't use cherry.Thanks for the recipe, very easy to make as most of the ingredients are in the kitchen already.

I'm going to take the advice of a fellow baker and bake for approx 50 minutes.  I just took mine out after 40 minutes and even though my toothpick came out clean, when I cut into it, it was a little too soft, almost sticky-gooey.  I've got it back in the oven with hopes it will turn out better after another ten minutes.  I think next time I make this I'll add b/p & b/s because just using the b/s makes it too dense and banana bread is already heavy that it needs a little lifting.  I hope it tastes better after a few more minutes baking but like most banana breads they always taste better after they have cooled and given a chance to sit. BECAUSE YOU SHARED I'M GIVING THIS A 4 STAR. thank you!!

AMAZING! I originally searched the ingredients I had b/c I needed to clean out the pantry. I didn't have maraschino cherries but everything else combined amazingly! Definitely NOT on my diet but I can definitely see ways to make it more figure friendly in the future (egg whites, applesauce, etc) Thank you for sharing such a great recipe - it's a hit!

Love this bread, best bread I have ever had. I use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I leave out the coconut, but a lot of review said the coconut made the cake. Make sure to use specified amount of pineapple, if you use more the bread will be mushy.

A good recipe, didn't take as long to cook, as the recipe said, and I actually lowered the temp at the last part.  I used 1 c. sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar, omitted the cherries and used pecans instead of walnuts.  Made some mini loaves that I cooked for 20 min.

WOW!  Didn't have cherries but still THE BEST flavor-even after subbing 1/2 c oat bran and 1.5 c whole wheat flour for 2 of the 3 cups of flour.  Also mixed 1 C Splenda, 1/2 C brown and 1/2 C white sugar and toasted coconut.  We made these in the heart shaped disposable tins and baked at 350 for 11 minutes-perfect.  Great healthy alternative to Valentine Sugar Cookies!

This bread was fantastic! I did make a couple of minor changes. I added 1/2 cup less sugar and did NOT miss it! It is plenty sweet with less sugar. I added 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla extract. I did not use the cinnamon... I don't care for cinnamon in my banana bread. I used pecans instead of walnuts, just because I prefer pecans. Macadamia nuts would be awesome in this as well (if you can afford them!). The consistency of this bread is wonderful and the flavor is delicious! Thank you so much for this recipe! I will be making this again many more times!

I made this recipe exactly the way it appears here.  It was so good.  When I was making it I thought I could freeze one of the loaves.  I didn't get a chance.  My family ate both loaves in 4 days.  I will definetly be making this again.  Don't make any changes the recipe is perfect as is.

Oh my goodness! This bread is fantastic!!! I didn't change a thing...and it came out wonderful! Great flavor, I don't think that there's "too much going on", or that it's like fruit cake...it's simply heavenly! I recomend that before you tweak it, just make the original recipe first, becuase I really think it's perfect as is!

This is truly one of the best things I've ever had.  I made it along with a ton of other things for a party and this is what everyone raved about.  I left out the cherries and it was perfect, and keeps good for a long time, if it lasts.
I will be making this weekly for myself and everyone who is begging for more of it.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe. :)

This is quite good. I am only giving it four stars because I don't like banana bread. 

Having said that, I omitted the cherries and made muffins out of this recipe. Since they smelled so good, I tried a small piece of one and ended up having the muffin with some ice cream LOL. The extra ingredients really help tone down the whole banana taste ... enough that I, a banana bread hater, will make this again. :)

This recipe was very easy to prepare and tasted great, ESPECIALLY then next day after the flavors marinated!  You could even make muffins instead of loaves.

I am a teacher and was teaching a unit on Hawaii.  I made this bread for my class and the students absolutely loved it.  They all actually were asking me for teh recipe.  The recipe made two loaves so I left one at home.  When I came home that night nothing was left.  This bread was a hit!  Thanks for the reccipe.

EVERYONE in the whole family LOVED this banana bread recipe......but the 4H judge told my nephew today (we had helped him mix and bake) it was too moist and too sweet and too dark??? REALLY??? Just know that we all love the banana bread and will continue to make it often!!  just one person's opinion for that day right? We ended up with 6 small loaves of the tastiest banana bread we've ever had! YUMMY! Try it, you will be glad you did!!

I've made this banana bread many times.  Sometimes I leave out the coconut or pineapple, or substitute raisins for the cherries, and it still comes out good. Great recipe!

I do not add coconut or merichino cherries (mainly because I don't keep these on hand) but otherwise I make this as is.  This recipe will make 2 loaves or 24 muffins.  I like to make 12 muffins for myself and give 1 loaf away.  This is awesome banana bread!  I have made it several times and plan on making it for as long as I can bake!

OK--I really changed the recipe--but thought others might be interested. I replaced the oil with 1 cup of applesauce. I cut the sugar to one cup. I replaced the cherries with 2 cups of dried mixed berries. Made sure the pineapple was REALLY drained, and added a little more. It was very yummy!

I am not a very disciplined grocery shopper, so over-ripened bananas are commonplace at our house. Have tried many many recipes and this is the most fabulous! Splendid! Next time, I'll will not chop the pineapple and cherries too fine. The added flavor was awesome, and I think the added texture will no doubt be as well.

The bread was very moist, and tasted just like banana bread. I couldn't really taste the coconut, pineapple, or cherries, so I was a little disappointed.

I found this very dry, I found that the ingrediants over and above the banana bread recipe just made it drier.  Will have to try it without all the extra stuff, cherries, pineapple, coconut.

I think I've found the best banana bread recipe. This bread is moist and with every bite, you get a mouthful of different textures (pineapple, cherries,bananas, etc.). It is so good. Only thing I changed is that I used only 1 cup of sugar, and it turned out great!

Excellent. I was so bored with regular banana bread and this was perfect. I omitted the cherries and the nuts though. Definitely will become my regular banana bread recipe. (I used the Ikea loaf pans- longer and narrower.)

I made a second batch for the hubby and added white chocolate chips...next time I will use macadamian nuts! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This bread is great!  Not sure I'll even make regular banana bread again. I was worried my bananas were a little over ripe, but it turned out perfect.  I also used 4 bananas.  I made one regular loaf and 3 mini loafs.  The mini loafs were done in about 40 minutes.

A really nice change from plain ol'boring banana bread.  I left out the coconut (just because I don't like it) and made it into 12 cupcakes and one loaf.  I baked the cupcakes for 20 minutes and the loaf for 60. My kids loved the cherries.

absolutely wonderful. EVERYBODY and I do mean everybody loved this bread. So many wonderful textures and flavors. The only change I made was to sub. 1 cup of white sugar for 1 cup of brown. ... I did use 2 cups of sugar ( brown/white ) and did not find the bread too sweet for me. I loved the cherries so much I may add more of them the next time. YUM...

This recipe was awesome. I switched it up a bit by adding a 1/4 cup sour cream, 2 tsp rum extract and using 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 c white sugar while also ommiting cherries. I put all the moist ingredients: eggs, vanilla, rum ext, oil, pineapple and coconut in the blender until smooth and then mixed with dry ingredients. It was so good.

Very good, I followed recipe to the T.  I did find that at 60 mins the edges were done, but the center was still uncooked, & I did use the correct pan sizes.  I will try again at the same temp, but will divide the batter amongst 3 pans instead of 2.  Hopefully that will work.  Still good though, thanks for the submission!

This was a very tasty and different banana nut bread. It was moist and delicious.  I left out the maraschino cherries because of personal preference.  I froze one loaf for about a month and it was every bit as delicious as the one we ate fresh.  This is a nice loaf to have on hand for company.  It goes great with tea or coffee.

YUM!  I mixed the wet ingredients to the dry using the muffin method (make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, pour in the liquid, and mix until just blended).  I also omitted the nuts and cherries, and used 25% less sugar.  The coconut and pineapple are a wonderful addition.  Thanks for sharing!

This is pretty darn good banana bread. Came out great with without coconut or cherries  and even with one (big) mistake...I completely forgot to add the vegetable oil.  Any of it.  It's still very moist and tasty and fewer calories, too, as a result.  Well, maybe.  I added chocolate chips. And I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar inside the loaf pans after I greased them. Nice dark outside and yummy.

I made these into muffins for my daughter;s birthday at school.  I made extra and not a one came home!!!! They are delicious and a big hit with kids---I left out the coconuts and cherries--can't wait to try it with those!!! Two thumbs up-thanks for the recipe!!! It made 24 muffins and I cooked for 45 minutes.

I was trying to get rid of alot of christmas baking 'hangerson' and this was the perfect recipe.  I just eyeballed alot of the 'extras'...I had a 20oz can of pineapple but by the time it is drained, it is only about 3/4 cup..so I squeezed it out thoroughly and added it.  I only had about 6 cherries left in the jar so chopped those, and also threw in the last of my chopped dates and dried apricots chopped.  This makes a very colorful bread.  I did not add cinnamon, as I didn't want to overpower it with a spice.  Vanilla was used along with the banana extract.  It came out like a picture and will be given away as a gift.  Nice color for christmas with the specks of red.

This is a nice alternative to banana nut bread.  I used 1 cup applesauce instead of oil  I also added 1 cup chocolate chips as well, very dessert like.  I used the left overs to make french toast, YUH-UM!  (FYI, I liked the cherries. :D)

This is an excellent recipe for banana bread.  I have made it for family, friends and coworkers and everyone loves it.  It is tasty, moist and easy to make. I did use half white, half brown sugar and left out the cherries.
Love it!!!

Great recipe but I changed it a little and I like this version even more--skip the cinnamon, use 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar instead of 2 c white sugar,  use macademias isntead of walnuts and use unsweetened coconut.

i would give this about 200 stars!  Simply divine and delish!  I added 1 cup of blueberries instead of the cherries (yuck, to fake) and probably more than the 8 oz of pineapple as I needed to use up a 20oz can that i opened thinking it was chunks.  I also used glass pans and baked it about 15-20 min longer.  So divine I had to freeze one loaf so we would not devour it like PIGGIES!  Such a flexible recipes...thanks for sharing Saundra.

I made this recipe last night and sent a loaf to work with my husband. He just emailed me and said it disappeared quickly and one of his co-workers wanted the recipe.
It was quite easy to put together. The only drawback was the mess I had to clean up after chopping, mashing and mixing. It's not the usual banana nut bread and most people will welcome this very moist and fresh tasting loaf.

I decided to make this for the teachers' lounge at the school where I work. The container was half gone before I got to the lounge! Next time I'll have to make a double batch! I had several requests for the recipe. I'll make this one many more times! YUMMY! I'd rate this a 10+

I have made this recipe several times now. My boyfriend loves this I make mini loaves for him and he takes one everyday to work. He is addicted. The first time I made I added a little more pineapple than called for it makes it very moist and you do have to bake a little longer. But I have been following the recipe exact. Will definitely make at Christmas time to give out.

I followed the directions to the letter but found it wasn't as moist as I expected and added 4oz cup of unsweetened applesauce and it was just enough to allow all ingredients to blend together perfectly. I baked it 30 min. Longer and it was delicious.

This is one great recipe. I didn't have coconut or cherries on hand so I made it without them and it turned out great. My wife said it was the best banana bread she has ever eaten. She took one loaf to work with her and past it out with only high praise on the taste and texture. Next time I'll try all the ingredients knowing that it can only be better.

The bread turned out great! Everyone loved it, but next time I'm taking out at least one cup of sugar. A bit too sweet

Wow, best banana nut bread ever. My hubby doesn't usually like banana bread, but he devoured it this evening. I only had one loaf pan, so I used the rest for muffins (12). We're saving the loaf to bring to a party tomorrow. It's only been 2.5 hours since they've been done and we only have 5 muffins left. By the end of the night, my goal is to have two leftover for breakfast! It's that good!

Wasn't as impressed with it as I hoped. My bf says he really likes it, but it made a lot so I'm hoping it will get eaten. I love all of the ingredients..maybe in a different banana bread recipe I would like it better. I usually use the banana crumb muffins recipe which is superior to this one in my opinion.

Excellent recipe.  I was a little skeptical about the cherries but it was wonderful.  I did a little different take and made muffins, finely chopped up the cherries in a chopper and filled the muffins with the cherries. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. My husband said it was the best banana bread he had ever tasted.

This is a moist and delicious bread. Have made several times. The only changes I have made are to use glacé cherries instead of maraschino, and to cut the oil to 2/3 cup and add 1/3 cup applesauce.  May be able to cut oil more and add more applesauce. Made with 2x the pineapple once. Loaf was very moist and a bit crusty.  Might try 1.5x the pineapple and see how that goes.  But very very yummy and always a hit.

I finally decided to rate this as I have been making it a couple of years now. Everyone I give a loaf to ( I make Mini Loaves) wants the recipe.  My sister in law loves for me to make her muffins as she can take them on the road with her (she is a truck driver). I omit the nuts as there are alot of people who are allergic to nuts, but they don't seem to miss what they don't know about.

I made half the recipe.  It was very good. Even my husband said it was pretty good.  It needed more time in oven. I kept checking the bread till a toothpick came out clean. I will make it again. Sent it to my daughter, I'm sure her 4 sons will love it.

Just made it.  Wonderful.  Rivals any I have tried. In this day and age cut the sugar by a third.  If you use real ripe (almost rotten) bananas, there is plenty of sweet there.

Delicious and very moist.  I might even add a little more pineapple next time.  I did need to cover the bread with foil last 10 minutes to prevent over browning.  Everyone really liked this and I will make again soon.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this bread.  It takes a long time to put all the ingredients together (longer than 10 minutes), but it is so worth it!  I get compliments on this every time I make it.  Don't need to change a thing.

Just made this recipe yesterday and the first loaf was gone in no time!  This is a delicious recipe, even without the maraschino cherries that I left out.  Excellent tasting, addicting, hard to leave alone banana bread that I'm sure we'll fight over to the last crumb.  Thanks for a such a yummy recipe, Saundra!

These just came out of the oven and are fabulous.  I made them into little mini two bite loaves.  Didn't add the cherries and used splenda instead of sugar and they came out great!

This was a pretty good recipe.  There is just nothing amazing about it.  I did use 1/2 applesauce for the oil in this recipe.  My husband really liked it but I've definitely had much better banana breads.  I'll keep the recipe but not sure if I'll ever actually make again.

I followed the instructions step by step and the bread came out great.  The only thing different I would do is use less sugar.  Instead of 2 cups sugar, I would use 1.  I too was hesitant about the coconut and pineapple, but they worked great together.  My kids (4 & 2 year olds) loved it, and they're picky eaters.  So if they like it, it definitely is great bread.

This was delicious.  I accidently forgot the coconut and decided to put it on the top (mini loaves).  It made a toasted coconut top that was EXCELLENT! 
I also substituted Macadamian nuts for a more Hawaiian flavor.

This recipe is a keeper! I've made it several times now and I learned early on that I need to double it if I want to keep any on hand for me and my hubby. Don't change a thing - it's perfect the way it is! (However, since I do double the recipe, I find it easier to first pre-mix all the wet ingredients (incl the coconut)then I spoon in the dry ingredients and add the walnuts last.) I usually bake in disposable mini-loaf pans so that I can send some home with family and friends. Mini loaves take about 40-45 minutes to bake to a perfect golden brown. This bread tastes even better after a day or two. FYI, I just recently whipped up a batch using 25% less sugar (to see if I could taste much of a difference)it was nearly as good as the original. But as I said in the beginning, do yourself a favor and give this one a try "as is". It's obviously not meant to be a "lite" recipe. I'll close with a "WARNING"...be prepared for family and friends to hound you for this bread for the rest of your days! The up side?? I've learned to barter with it. My friend is coming over to help me set-up my home theater surround sound equipment; his price..."some of my banana bread".

Made this recipe in mini loaf pans and they came out weighing more than the bricks on my patio. The batter did not even rise in the loaf pans. The only change was I used a whole can of crushed pineapple, because I was a little short on exactly 2 cups of bananas.  Needless to say I was very disappointed.

The texture for this bread is really great, and the spices were just the right amount.  However, I thought the pineapple and coconut flavors both got a little lost in the finished product.  I think I would leave out the cherries and make up the difference with more pineapple and coconut next time.

We loved this bread!  It's not the most healthy bread recipe, but it went great with my mothers day Hawaiian themed dinner.  I substituted macadamia nuts (personally imported from the islands).  I did not put the coconut or cherries because I don't care for either.

It cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful.  Thanks!

Overall, pretty good but I agree that the pineapple kind of gets lost within the other ingredients. I would try again by adding more pineapple and banana and omitting the cherries.

Absolutely amazing! The cherries, pineapple, and coconut are a nice addition to the traditional banana nut bread. I had lots of people ask for the recipe after making it. It's a pretty filling bread too as a little slice of it goes a long ways. Next time, I may add a little more mashed bananas for more of a banana flavor kick. Other than that, it's superb.

Substituting 1 16 oz can whole cranberries for 1 cup bananas worked well.

Wonderful flavor! Very moist! I reduced the fat and sugar content by taking the suggestions of other reviewers so I could enjoy w/o guilt.  Used 1 cup brown sugar only, 4 egg whites, 1/2 cup nuts, 1/2 applesauce, sub 1 cup oats for flour & 1/2 cup oil.  Froze half the batter. Baked the rest @ 350 for 18-20 min for 12 muffins. Perfect with coffee or milk!

This bread was wonderful!!  I made it in the middle of zucchini season and when I brought it to work I think everyone was glad that is did not have any zucchini in it.  Very moist and flavorful.

Excellent recipe!  It was so moist and delicious and the coconut and pineapple are a great addition.  I am thinking that I might use macadamia nuts the next time to really give it that Hawaiian flavor.

Moist & tasty w/ some more wholesome substitutions- half whole wheat flour, 1/4 c. canola and 3/4 c. plain yogurt, more banana and pineapple and fewer nuts, coconut (I use the frozen which has more coconut flavor) and cherries and I cut back on the sugar by half but I think that might be too little for most tastes. I've eaten 2 pieces while making dinner.

Pretty good!  I think the maraschino cherry flavor was a bit overwhelming so, next time, I think I'd cut the amount in half.  Otherwise, nice twist on traditional banana bread!

I made this banana bread for my family on the weekend and we all thought it was really good! I made it in a bundt pan and it turned out great! Very tasty and flavourful. The cherries made it so pretty when you slice into it. Will be making this again when I have ripe bananas in the house!

This was a very nice change to ordinary banana bread! I decided to add a thin vanilla glaze once the bread cooled that made it even better.

To make this a "healthier" bread I used:
whole wheat flour, no oil (used a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple--not drained to compensate for liquid).  I also only had 2 bananas and a few cherries.  Very good, moist, flavorful, fun bread.  Great!

Not a fan of this recipe.  I love bananas and can't get enough of pineapple, but the bread was so busy and dense.  I ended up throwing it away.  Really reminded me of fruitcake.  I will not be making again.

This has got to be a great recipe.  I personally don't eat banana nut bread, but my husband loves it.  He normally doesn't comment much on the quality of food, but he has been raving about this since I made the 1st loaf.  I'm making more today!  I didn't add the cherries to the first batch and it turned out fine.  Today I'm going to try it with the applesauce instead of oil and will be adding the cherries too.  Based on my husband's reaction to this recipe, I would definitely recommend it.

Yummy!  I bake this bread a lot!  Everyone thinks it's delicious.  Although, I don't add the coconut, nuts and the cherries; simply bananas and pineapples are good enough for us!  A few times, I didn't have crushed pineapple (I only had the diced kind) so I just mashed up the diced pineapples with a fork in a bowl and that worked out fine.  I also leave just a hint of pineapple juice and add it to the bread mixture for that extra moisture.  Anyway, it always turns out perfect and scrumptious!  Thanks for sharing with us!  :o)

Delicious quick bread!  I found it a tad sweet but my husband loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly but left out the cherries because I'm not a big fan.  Also,  I only had pineapple tidbits and decided to run them quickly through my processor.  The instantly turned to a "baby food" texture but I used them anyway.  Still quite good but I think next time I'll mash them by hand!  I will make this again but cut the sugar back by a 1/2 cup.

Very easy to make and I didn't have to change the recipe for high altitude baking. I was surprised that there wasn't more pineapple flavor to the bread. Shared with my co-workers and it didn't last very long.

This is one of the best breads I have ever made. During the holidays I sell nut breads at bazaars and this one is definitely a winner. It is so moist and tasty.

This was the best banana bread I've ever eaten!!  Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and subbed raisins for the cherries and it was phenomenal!  Will definitely make again!

This is by far the best banana bread my husband and I have ever had. I followed others suggestions and used 1/2 c apple sauce and 1/2 c oil instead of the 1 c of oil, and 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white instead of 2 c white. I also didnt use the cherries or the nuts. It freezes very well. This is a keeper. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Wonderful recipe. The only suggestion I would make would be to leave the cherries out. They do in fact give a good hint of color, the only problem is that they make the bread (when sliced) look very similar to the dreaded "fruitcake".

This taste pretty good, although I forgot to drain the pineapple :( and the center turned out mushy.  PLEASE drain the pineapple.  Very good taste overall.

Great recipe. I used 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, omitted the cherries, and used chopped macadamia nuts instead of walnuts for a more Hawaiian flavor. Very moist and flavorful.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  This is THE BEST banana nut bread I have ever had!  It didn't take much more time to make than the traditional and it was SO good!  I did use 1 cup of applesauce instead of the oil and it turned out unbelievably moist and delicious and with far less fat and calories!  I have a feeling I will be giving this recipe out a lot!  Thanks Saundra!

I took this to a Hawaiian-themed party and it disappeared quickly!  There were a lot of flavors going on and it was extremely "fruity" (my son said it was sort of like fruit cake).  I toasted the coconut first, and made one of the loaves without walnuts.  They didn't rise much; I would recommend a smaller loaf pan; this way, you will get a nice high loaf.  I would make it again.  Thank you.

I left out the cherries because I don't like them, and it was delicious.  I may cut the added sugar in the future because it was plenty sweet from the pineapple, bananas and coconut. I got lots of compliments on how moist and delicious it was. Will def make again.

Used 1 1/2 cup of sugar because bananas were very ripe. The ripper they are the sweeter. 
Very good everyone loved. Made these for Christmas gifts.

I have made this several times and it has turned out great.  I use roughly chopped canned pineapple slices, substitute pecans, and eliminate the cherries and coconut.  I know it is not "Hawaiian", but my family likes it this way.

It was good, but I expected a lot more flavor, which it had, but I could taste a lot more flour than I like to taste in a banana bread. Made it exactly as directed.

I changed the oil to coconut oil and cut the sugar by half (if I had used the 2cup it would have been too sweet) and it was great.it had a nice crust on it and the bread it's self was moist. It made 2 loaves so I added choc.chips to one loaf before baking and every single person loved it. I sooo recommend this recipe

Yes, I made some changes. I only had 1 cup of bananas so I added 1 cup of apple sauce to it. It turned out delishes! I also chopped my cherries up very fine so I had more cherries than it called for which made my cake reddish. It's not a real sweet bread so I think it is great for breakfast and my coffee.  I will try it with the correct amount of bananas the next time just to compare because I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Well deserved rating!! I followed the suggestions and only used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and replaced the other half with unsweetened apple sauce to cut the fat. I also substituted 1 cup of white sugar for brown sugar.  Lastly, I only used 1/2 cup of cocoa nut flakes, which was coco-nutty enough. It would’ve been too fibrous otherwise.  Do NOT add more or less fruit, everything as is has the perfect balance.  I would add a light glaze for presentation.

We loved it. My wife and I worked together to make it between her and I we ate a whole loaf. I asked my wife if we should give our  Neighbor's the other loaf she said no!!!! it was that good. I gave it 4 stars because I'm not a coconut fan.

Tastes awesome.  It worked at a higher elevation!
 Reduced sugar by half cup, I had only three bananas, half the pineapple and added applesauce,  no cherries. The  Recipe Made a dozen muffins and one loaf! This is now my go to recipe for banana nut bread!

I had all ingredients except maraschino cherries. I followed the recipe (sans cherries). My bake time was about 1 hour and 10 minutes.  It is really easy to make and is delicious, great texture and aroma. Maybe a bit sweeter than my personal preference. Next time, I will cut the sugar. One reviewer suggested 1/2 C less; that sounds about right. I will also put the shredded coconut through a food processor for about 2 seconds for shorter coconut strands as another reviewer mentioned. I think these changes will bring the rating up to 5.

Finally.....I found something I can't screw up!! LOL
Thank you !   The only problem is that I have had to make 3 DOUBLE batches since Christmas and now i have just put my fourth  double batch in the oven.  Great recipe!  You should be in the movies, lol!  My husband is reading this   and saying that  " I sound way too joyful".   After we make it,  we prepare for mailing 1/2 to St. Louis and the other half  to Austin.  (our kids &  their families)    It is just the 2 of us senior citizens   so we get to  keep 1 loaf. :)

I made this recipe exactly as submitted.   I didn’t measure bananas but used 4 medium, as a reviewer had suggested.  It turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

This has been one of my best go-to recipes for years.  My husband and I love it.  But then, we love all the ingredients. I would never give this away as a gift because you either hate coconut....   or you love it.  This goes for all the rest of the ingredients, but coconut is absolutely a very love/hate food.   Also, I make it in a muffin form.  It is easier to divide.   I bake for about 10 minutes or until browned.

Fantastic Recipe!!!! I used coconut oil instead if vegetable oil and dried bing cherries instead of maraschino. Reduced cooking time to 50 minutes. Grease the pan very well, mine stuck a bit. I can’t wait to make it again with maraschino cherries. Definitely my new favorite banana bread!!!

Quick and easy with ingredients most people have on hand (note to self: stock  maraschino cherries). Good bread, not too dense. I’ll try this again with the cherries and maybe pineapple tidbits rather than crushed. Dole’s crushed pineapple is almost like a paste so you don’t get that succulent bite of pineapple. Thank you from our house for a fine recipe!

The recipe worked well and tastes great. I made no changes. My only issue was it didn't get totally done at the very top in the middle after 60 minutes. I might leave it in another 5 minutes next time, or maybe not open the oven door so much lol.

I thought this was excellent and have already made it a second time.   One thing I liked about it was that it held together nicely and wasn't crumbly like some I have made.  I didn't have any cherries so added dried cranberries instead and they were good.      The second time I made it I accidentally forgot to add the oil.  I thought it would be ruined but it was pretty good without it which is a good indication that you could reduce the amount of oil if you want to....just a little dry.....so probably doesn't need all that much oil.

It turned out good but the only thing that I don’t like is the cherries as to I’m not very fond of them. If you don’t like cherries I would leave them out of the recipe. The coconut my boyfriend said he doesn’t like but I couldn’t taste the coconut. He’s the one who saw the recipe online and said he wanted to try it so he bought the ingredients and I made it for him. I’ve never been the kind of person to bake anything but this I had to give it a shot. I love banana nut bread but I’ve never had it like this one before. But also I’ve never heard of Hawaiian Banana Nut Bread either.

Made this bread as today. Followed the recipe with the exception of the maraschino cherries and pineapple. I  didn't have crushed pineapple, so I drained a 20 oz. can of pineapple slices,  processed them a few seconds and drained them again. (I ended up using 7 of the slices) My husband loves maraschino cherries, but I can't stand them, so I substituted "Craisins" for the cherries. It was delicious and could have used even more of the "Craisins!" Next time I will make it with the maraschino cherries so I don't get tempted to eat it all!

Used applesauce instead of oil - so much healthier. Used mac nuts instead of walnuts - I live in Hawaii. Left out the cherries. This recipe really inspired me. Serve it at a bed and breakfast and they always love it!

This recipe was just okay. I was hoping for much more, I was let down. My thoughts were, bananas, pineapple, cherries, that should be flavor packed. It surprisingly was not. Not sure how to tweak it to make it better.

The best bread....you can lighten it up with half the sugar and 3/4 cup oil. Also I have added a variety of spices. Very versatile.

Amazing. It disappeared so quickly I'm making more. The only thing I omitted was the cherries as we don't care for those and i used pecans as they are our favorite. So moist, yummy and tasty. My new go to when needing to use up bananas.

Followed the directions but this bread was not for us. We liked the texture but the flavor was too mild. We like sweeter and stronger fruit flavors. If I were to make it again I’d reduce some of the flour.

Absolutely delicious!! My husband said it's the best banana bread I've EVER made!!!! After looking at the ingredients, I thought that it would be super sweet, especially with 2 cups of sugar along with the natural sugars. So I rinsed the cherries and used unsweetened coconut, which IMHO was absolutely brilliant. Definitely going to be keeping this recipe in my favorites!!

Wonderful recipe! I used raisins instead of maraschino cherries, because I had them on hand. It was good, but I think the cherries would have been better and would have added color.

Awesomely delicious bread ! Could also be a cake !!
 Don't like coconut so I omitted that and added more cinnamon and more walnuts.  Will make this again and use pineapple chunks and maybe add pecans also !!

Delicious banana bread!  Give it a try.  I made a few changes for myself: a little less sugar, applesauce instead of oil and elimination of the cherries.

This is the best banana bread. I've made it several times. This time I made jumbo muffins which were done perfectly at 30 minutes. This is one for my archives.

Great I am in the process of making another loaf. This time I can follow the recipe. When I made it the first time I did not have cherries, I used fresh pineapple, did not have as many bananas so added flavoring and forgot the coconut and it was still good. Difficult to have only one piece. Suggest making small loaves to curb the obsession.

Fabulous! Husband and kids don't like nuts so I left those out. I think the ingredient list should specify that the Maraschino cherries should be drained and added without the syrup. That's what we did and it wasn't overpowering at all, just a little bit of cherry deliciousness every few bites!

This a wonderful recipe.  I have made it several times and it's always a hit.  My husband, my 4 year and even my two year old loves this bread.  We didn't change a single thing.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I substituted several ingredients just as a personal preference.  I used whole wheat flour, dark brown sugar and I doubled the cinnamon.  I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil.  I only had 2 1/2 frozen banana, so I just added more pineapple tidbits and cherries.  I omitted the nuts and coconut just as a preference. My plan was to make the 4 loaves.  (I buy the disposable tin loaf pans, so I can take it to a party or dinner and not worry about getting my pan back)  I planned on keeping one for myself and freezing the other 4 for parties/dinners BUT it was so good, I had to give one to a friend!
Whenever I buy bananas and they start to get too ripe, I peel em, cut em in half, then freeze em for recipes like this-PERFECT (no wasted bananas either)

I made this bread on Saturday and my husband and I loved it!  It's just the two of us, and I'm a bit embarased to say that there's only half of a loaf of bread left as of this Tuesday morning.  It's great for breakfast with coffee, as a snack or dessert, or just because you passed through the kitchen and it was there on the counter calling your name!  Delicious!  Didn't change a thing on the recipe.  I cooked it one hour but I may cook it 8-10 minutes longer next time as there are just a few spots that don't seem quite done.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.

The first time we made it, we made four loaves for a church function which requested no nuts. Also didn't have the cherries on hand and no time to get them. WITHOUT the walnuts and cherries this was a TOTAL hit. People raved about it. Then we made two loaves following the recipe with walnuts and cherries. Another total hit! I've had a lot of banana bread over the years but this is just FANTASTIC. A keeper for me. Thank you Saundra for posting this recipe. Note: We think our oven is possessed. First time cooked it for the full 60 minutes using dark pans and the bottom come out a touch too dark. Second time used "convection bake" and took it out 5 minutes early, probably should have left it in for the full 60 minute. Basically just watch it the last ten minutes... You won't be disappointed. PS: I'm not a fan of maraschino cherries in general but won't ever make this w/o them again.

I didn't add the cherries, I guess it's a throw back to red dye # 2 fear days. I baked it slightly longer than the time suggested-5 minutes more. The texture is good. I love the coconut flakes I used ( non sweetened) . I added a small amount of coconut oil for the nutty flavor and lessened the sugar by about a third of a cup and added  a third of a cup of honey. It is very moist, maybe a bit too moist but lasts longer without getting dry.

I made this Hawaiian banana bread go the first time and it is yummy.. The only thing I did different was a use coconut oil in stead of vegetable oil. I creamed oil, sugar and eggs before I added the dry ingredients . Before I put it in the oven I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top of the bread mix.

This was good. I followed along precisely with amounts and only omitted the walnuts, due to my Dad having dentures. I finely ground my coconut, as I like the flavor but not the chewiness of it. I added it to my dry ingredients and stirred them well. I put the eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, and oil together, mixed it w/ my wire whip, then added the smushed bananas, crushed, drained pineapple, and cherries, which I chopped in my food processor. This way, they were more consistently mixed throughout the batter and not chunky or overwhelming. Also, they looked very pretty this way.  :) After stirring all the wet ingredients together, I then added the dry ingredients, stirring them in gently and turned it all out into a greased 9 x 13 inch cake pan. 45 minutes later, all done, let cool. Basically, this made a large cake, with lots of great flavors. If I make it again, I would top it w/ powdered sugar glaze. Just a thin layer of sweet, crunchy topping would really set this off nicely. Or, perhaps cupcakes, since it appears kind of party-like, with the colors and flavors. Some cream cheese icing on them, maybe?

This was very moist and my husband loved it, but I found it a little sweet and will reduce the quantity of sugar next time since the pineapple and the cherries also add sweetness.

Made some changes to the recipe. Only used 1 cup sugar, no cherries, 3 tsp vanilla, and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Made 2 loaves and only had to bake for 40 min.

I did make a few changes.  I only had one loaf pan so used a bunt pan baking about 70 minutes.  I used 2/3 c white sugar and 2/3 c brown sugar.  I also added 3/4 c dates and only 2/3 c cherries as that was all i had on hand.

This bread is simply fabulous!  Sent a loaf to my husband's work and they drooled all over it.  I followed all of the directions except I used pecans instead of walnuts and added 1/2 teaspoon extra.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I made it a little healthier with some modifications though.

My modifications:
2 cups all-purpose plus 1 cup whole wheat flour, instead of 3 cups regular flour
1 cup sugar instead of 2
1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup pineapple juice instead of 1 cup oil
chopped instead of crushed pineapple
almonds instead of walnuts
fresh strawberries instead of marashino cherries

Turned out really well, PLENTY sweet and moist despite reduced sugar and oil.

I crave this  bread!  I ditch the cherries & coconut and use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I don't think you can have too much pineapple.  Top it off with cream cheese. Delicious!

When I made this I omitted the cherries and replaced the walnuts with sliced almonds. Also, works much better as muffins. My kids and co-workers love them!

Made the recipe this morning for the first time and it won't be the last. Very flavorful and moist. Can't wait to share this with my friends and family. I was able to get 2 nice size loaves out of this recipe.  I may have to hide the second.

My mother  in  law had made a few different recipes  over the years.  None made a huge impression but it was nice to have something a little different than banana bread and also could be festive reminding me of fruit cake. I don't like fruit cake and the other Hawaiian bread recipes were a little dry.  This recipe is the best!  It is so most and it can be left out in front of me.  It's so good I have a hard time sharing.  Good job and thanks!

To my husband and myself this one was a waste of ingredients.
We got nothing out of it other than the taste of banana bread and nuts.
Followed the recipe except for the cherries and I made my own crumb topping with a little margerine, sugar, nuts and coconut.  If it weren't for the topping I added it wouldn't be anything more than banana bread.  Couldn't taste coconut, or pineanpple at all.
Maybe switching the vanilla to coconut extract would help.  Don't know, but not worth the try for us.

This was really really good. I didn't have the coconut and I only used half the maraschino cherries, otherwise I made it exactly as written. I will definitely make again, it was moist but not too moist. It was sweet but not too sweet.Thanks for the recipe!

I omitted the walnuts, pineapple, and cherries, and added chocolate chips to make a very easy, rich chocolate-coconut banana bread.  Compared to my grandmas (wonderful) banana bread recipe, this uses more bananas (I used 4 overripe ones) and is quicker since you just mix it up (no creaming butter or beating eggwhites).  My husband isn't a fan of normal banana bread but loved this, so I will make it again!

First time I made this, I didn't have the cherries, or nuts and the family raved about it.  Complete hit!  Second time I put cherries in one loaf only and while it was good, I didn't think it was worth the extra cost for us.  As other posters did, I also used a larger can of pineapple, and even though it had to bake a while longer, it was still incredible!!  Just recently, I made the whole recipe in a bundt pan and it turned out really well.  Great way to "portion control" this yummy family fav.  Now to see if it freezes well (if in fact it lasts long enough to make it to the freezer!).  This goes in the keeper pile for sure... probably the only banana bread I'll make from now on!  Many thanks Saundra!!

I made a few changes to this recipe, mainly because I wanted to use brown sugar instead of white sugar and wanted to not have to use eggs. Here are the following substitutions:

instead of walnuts used pecans
instead of eggs used (1) 13.5 oz coconut milk
instead of white sugar used brown sugar
instead of pineapple (didn't have ;) used (1) 11 oz can of mandarin oranges
instead of maraschino cherries (again, didn't have) used dried dates
instead of vanilla extract used (1) vanilla bean

Thanks SAUNDRA for the beginnings of a non-traditional banana bread!!!!

I honestly didn't care for the combination of pineapple and banana in this bread.  We made ours into a cake to try to compensate for the flavor by putting vanilla icing on top.

I have been making this bread (or a variation of it) for several years now; everyone loves it! It think it is really good with the pineapple, cherries and nuts, but my kids prefer it without, so that is the way I usually make it. Also, I substitute butter for half of the oil and substitute nutmeg for half of the cinnamon. Thanks!

Amazing! What a wonderful twist on traditional banana nut bread. I was able to make 3 loaves with disposable pans. I brought one of the loaves to work and it was devoured and everyone LOVED it! Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe!

Great banana bread, did not change a thing to recipe. Recipe makes two loafs so wrapped one tight in Saran wrap, foil and a zip lock and stuck it in the freezer, should keep for two months. The other one should be good in the fridge for up to a week wrapped the same. My Mom gave me this advice :)

I loved this recipe, though I could have easily halved it to feed two of us for a week. I used unsweetened applesauce for all the oil and it was delicious, but uncommonly moist. I'm not sure if that's a product of this recipe or not. I'd try next time without so much sugar (maybe half?). Still delicious and easy!

Tasty, but very moist.  I substituted applesauce for the majority of the oil and did half brown sugar and half Splenda to cut down on the calories so it wouldn't be so much of a "dessert."  The bread was almost soggy the next day, but after putting it in the toaster oven, it was quite good.

I'm giving this four stars because I'm sure it's better than mine came out because I think I over baked it. It was sooooo dry! Maybe I'll try again some other time :(

This is a great recipe from the traditional banana bread. I doubled this recipe, cut the sugar in half and added more pineapple. Awesome....this goes from the freezer to the plate in no time and guest don't know you didn't bake it that day. I make this over and over.

Don't get me wrong:  this is delicious! BUT, (there's always a but!) I couldn't really taste the cherries/pineapple.  I left out the coconut, but I like the idea of the coconut cream addition as another reviewer suggested.  It just tasted like a good banana bread w/a slightly different texture.  Oh, and this is VERY sweet (this coming from a person that likes her coffee a syrup-y consistency).  I will cut down on the sugar next time.

I made this recipe without changing one thing.  I love how all the flavors blended together.  I almost didn't use the cherries, but I'm so glad that I did.  Every time someone ate a slice, they wanted the recipe...and another slice.  I'm already planning on making this for holiday presents this year.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

This recipe only needs 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup cherries.  It was waaay to sweet, even for me! I omitted the cinnamon, because I don't like the taste of cherries and cinnamon together. Other than that, it was great.

EXCELLENT!!!!  instead of a full cup of oil, I used a 1/2 cup of applesauce & 1/2 cup of canola oil.  I didn't use the cherries.  My Sunday School class and family loved it.  Next time I will try it with a full cup of applesauce and no oil.  But as the way I prepared it this time,  it was sooooo moist.

I made this for a luau lunch at work.  Everyone loved it.  The only problem I had with the recipe was I cooked it in glass pans and had to add another 20 minutes cooking time.  It was also very hard to slice because it was so moist.

WOW is all that I can say after tasting this bread.  This is one of the best recipes I've tried off this site (and I've tried plenty!)  I followed the recipe pretty closely except that I used 1/3 cup butter, 1/3 cup shortening, and 1/3 cup oil.  I used half brown sugar/half white sugar and omitted the cherries.  Absolutely delicious!

I have made this recipe many times, and it comes out perfect every time. One of my most requested recipes. Since I make alot at one time for gifts and sharing, I prepare my bananas, and pineapple ahead of time, and freeze them together. The pineapple keeps the bananas from turning black.

I made these as muffins, and though I'm not much of a chef, they turned out REALLY good! I omitted the walnuts, since I didn't have time to grind them, and I only had a small amount of cherries. I also added just a touch of the juice from the cherry jar. I added a little extra banana, too, and it turned out VERY yummy! love this recipe!

This was absolutely awesome! I made half without nuts and half with nuts.  The only problem I had was the one with nuts, the middle would not get completely cooked through. After baking for over an hour, I finally just scooped the uncooked part out of the middle and sliced it and took it to work. Noone even knew. This is a keeper.....a great change from ordinary banana bread.

LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!  I wanted to make some type of banana bread for my one year old son who absolutely loves "nanas".  I cut the sugar to 1 cup instead of 2 so he could have as much as he liked. (Couldn't tell the difference) His very picky non-fruit eating father loved it also.  I didn't have cherries so I added about 1/4 cup of dried blueberries.  Everyone loved this bread.  This will definitely be a monthly repeat for my family! Thanks for the great recipe.

I wish I wasn't in the minority here.  All the ingredients for this bread sounded great to me but the final outcome was just "OK."  It smelled heavenly while baking.  My 3 yr old was so excited to eat it from the smell coming from the overn.  It turned out very dense.  I made the recipe exactly as written.

A good, moist banana bread recipe. Instead of walnuts I used macadamia nuts, and I spread the batter out to three smaller pans (whatever size the disposable foil ones are) and still had the same baking time. Otherwise, I made the recipe as directed. I expected more chunks of taste of cherry and pineapple, but the crushed pineapple sort of disappeared into the bread and I only had the occasional taste of cherry. I will make this again, but with some adjustments.

I've been making this for the past four years and everyone loves it!  I use the large can of crushed pineapple and make sure to drain it very well (even squeeze the extra juice out) and add dried cherries as I'm not much for the sweet cheries.  I've never had a problem with it being gooie by adding the extra cherries.

Very good bread!  I made some small variations, used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil for the 1 cup oil.  Because of picky eaters and nut allergies I put half the batter in one pan then to the other half I added the nuts and I used dried cherries (we don't like the marschino cherries) I didn't use the coconut because I didn't have any (I was sure I did).  The without loaf was good but the with loaf was even better.  I plan on getting coconut for next time I make this.  One daughter saw the title and said yech, macadamia nuts.  I think I'll try those next time too, in one loaf.  This one is a keeper.

I was looking for a recipe to use up the old bananas I had, but I wanted something a little different. I tried this and LOVED it. Follow the recipe exactly.  There is nothing to change or make a little better - it it just perfect the way it is.  Sweet but not too sweet.  I have passed this recipe on to many friends now and everyone calls back to rave about it.  Just the best  - thanks!

We loved this banana bread.  The only thing I will change next time is try it with only  1 1/2 cups of sugar as I found it a tad sweet.

This recipe was so easy and fast!  I will be making this all the time.  I forgot to add the vanilla and it still tastes great.  I chopped the coconut, craisins (had no cherries), nuts, and bananas individually in the food prossesor before I added them to the mixer.  I also added 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar.  The batter was enough for 4 mini loaf pans and 48 mini muffins.

I found this recipe a while ago but am just getting around to rating it.  However, I have made this recipe countless times. My family, friends and coworkers love it! Thanks.

This bread is AWESOME! I was looking for a diffrent use for the ripe bananas and this bread was great It makes t loaves and they are moist and flavorful. My husband loves banana bread and he really liked this one. The added fruits are not overwhelming and add just a hint of all the flavors. This is definitely going to be one of my favorites.

My family flipped over this. I had to convince them that it was more than banana nut bread. What a hit. I give small loaves as gifts at Christmas. Love it!!

This bread is wonderful!  I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  I wanted a change from the normal banana bread.  I will definitely make it again.  I barely tweaked the recipe with great results...just substituted some of the flour with healthier wheat flour.  Loved it!

Absolutely awesome! A very nice change to regular banana bread. I omitted the cherries and came up a little short on the bananas so I didn't drain the pineapple. I didn't have nuts so obviously left those out too. It turned out great and even my picky husband ate some.

I loved this recipe. I made muffins and my three year didn't want to stop eating them. I pureed all of the fruit before adding and omitted the nuts (my husband and son don't eat nuts), cooked for 25-30 mins. I will be making these again.

This is the only Banana Bread I will make for my family from now on. It is so easy to make and tastes great. I substituted Macadamia nuts for the walnuts and it was great.

This recipe was sooo good!! I changed it a little by cutting the oil back to 2/3 of a cup and omitting the coconut and nuts. I tried the half white sugar and half brown sugar like other reviewers, and i highly recommend doing that. I aslo substituted fresh cherries for the maraschino. In the end this was an excellent, very moist bread. I will definitely make it over and over!

I too made a few changes...left out the nuts and crushed pineapple but added in an extra banana and a small bag of dried tropical fruit.  Also substituted almond extract for the vanilla.  It was delicious...even better the second day.  My son could smell it baking in his room and came to investigate!  He was eating  it hot soon out of the oven!  Only lasted a day here.  Thanks for the great (and flexible!) recipe.  A nice variation from the old stand-by!

This was an easy, excellent bread that came out perfectly!  The bread seemed to even get better after a day or two. Don't let the maraschino cherries scare you.  They add beautiful color and taste. It would be delicious as a cake since it reminded me of the consistency of carrot cake.  Frost with cream cheese frosting and serve as a dessert!  Yum!

Excellent, excellent banana bread ever!! The pineapple, flaked coconut & cherries give it a great texture & taste. I made this like four times already. Tried to cut back some oil to make it a bit healthier, but i would suggest to make it as directed. Although i did use the egg substitute....that's ok. Again a wonderful recipe. Thanks a lot Saundra

Thankyou Saundra for an absolutely wonderful banana nut bread recipe! My whole family loved it! I did omit the coconut because I don't like coconut but wow, it was great! I did have to bake it a little longer, about 67 minutes and I baked them in a little bit smaller loaf pans but it turned out great. It was my first time baking banana nut bread and I was a little nervous but now I will make this all the time. Once again thankyou!

Depending on your oven, you may need to leave the loafs 10 minutes more, for a total of 1hr 10 mins.

I tried this recipe on a whim. I didn't think the cherries would taste very good in this recipe, but I was wrong. They add a lot of flavor and eye appeal. I ended up being short half of the bananas so I used sour cream to make up the rest. It worked perfectly!
Good recipe!

i absolutely love this recipe, whenever i make it, im begged to make more and share the recipe. it works without the cherries and its best to soften the bananas with a spatula-like utensil before mixing it with the other ingredients!

Really Delicious. A nice to change to banana bread. Takes a little longer to prepare but worth it.

I was looking for a fairly traditional nut bread recipe when I stumbled on this one.  It sounded good so I tried it just as is.  I used a pan that has 8 little loaves, cut the baking time to 30 minutes and gave as gifts at the office. Just about everyone wanted the recipe.  I will definitely use again.

I really liked this bread, all the flavors are wonderful together.  Only thing I will change is to omit the pineapple next time, it had a "slimey" look to it the next day, which wasn't too appealing.

YUM YUM YUM!!!! This bread is delicious!! This is my favorite combo- pineapple, banana, coconut- and this bread blends them together so well and is just so tasty. I disagree with many of the other reviewers-- I thought this bread went together VERY easily and quickly. I probably put it together in the 10 minute prep time it mentioned, or less! So fast and easy! I just threw the cherries in the food processor and they were nicely chopped in a matter of seconds. I mashed the banana right in the measuring cup to avoid more dishes than necessary and it took about 1 1/2 over-ripe bananas... just what I had left to use up! *(I only made a 1/2 batch, for 1 loaf)* I will definitely be making this again and sharing it with family and friends!!

This recipe was a big hit.  I actually caught my 12 year old daughter stealing a HUGE chunk of it to take along to school.  It's just like a Hawaiian cake my Mom used to make when we were kids.  Moist, sweet, delicious.  All of the flavors compliment one another...yet can be singled out in your mouth.  Excellent recipe...and simple to make.
