I've made this a couple of times and really think it tastes great.  I omit most all of the salt.  I pour about half the sauce over the ribs and bake covered until the last hour when I uncover and sauce for about an hour (no basting or flipping).  Tender, fall off the bone delicousness!

I cooked this for Super Bowl LXII (Pats/Giants).  When I pulled them out of the oven I took a little chunk out with a fork and tried it.  I was completely blown away by the flavor and couldn't believe I cooked them.  Even cutting each rib was awesome.  The sound the knife made as it cut through the juicy meat, you just knew they were cooked to perfection.

I mostly followed the recipe to a T, but had twice the ribs and only 1/2 the ketchup.  So I made up the batch of sauce, which was runny like a marinade. I also mixed in a small amount of Famous Dave's Devil's Spit.  Covered with foil and baked at around 350 for about 3 hours.  Every 30 minutes I came back in an flipped them and poured a little Devil's Spit on or basted with homemade sauce.  After about 2 hours I took away the foil.  After removing the foil and waiting another 30 minutes, the ribs were really starting to look awesome. By the time I was done I used an entire bottle of Devil's Spit and about 3/4ths of the sauce (which started to thicken, but was still liquidy, had to drain pan).

These ribs were so juicy, so tender.  I got a lot of compliments, and with the Devil's Spit used (which only helped to enhance the original recipe), they had a little spice/heat to them.  But even two little kids who don't like spicy food were eating them.  Quite possibly the best dish I've ever cooked!

These were the best ribs I've ever had.  I used inexpensive side ribs.  I added half the sauce,  then covered tightly with foil and turned the ribs after 1 hour.  After cooking for 2 hours, I removed the foil,  added the rest of the sauce and spooned extra sauce every 20 minutes or so.

This SO exceeded my expectations! Hubby is a master griller, so I was surprised when he said he was really impressed with these ribs! It may be a little putzy to tend to them every 20 minutes for 3 hours, but it is so worth it. Who would think ketchup, water and a few other simple ingredients could produce such a luxurious sauce? Other than adding a little garlic powder and 2 tsp. of liquid smoke I made these just as the submitter intended. Every time I pulled them out of the oven to baste them they just kept looking better and better! Absolutely beautiful and finger-lickin' good.

Awesome!! This is without a doubt the best tasting ribs. I was worried at first about the sauce. Seemed a little thin..but it got thickier as time went on. Followed recipe exactly and everything blended together just right. Fall apart tender.  Very juicy.  Made double batch of sauce and was just right for two packages of ribs. Family never looked up the whole time we ate. Wish I could give it a ten.  Thanks Vicky. It's a keeper

Great flavor!!! I did cut the salt. 1 teaspoon was plenty and I didn't fuss so much over it in the oven. Basted only a couple times. Will be making again.

I made these last night and they came out really good for oven cooked ribs.
I did add about 2 cloves of minced garlic and cut the salt to about 1/2 tsp as 4 sounded like WAY too much.  Basted and turned about every 1/2 hour...not too much trouble. DH was suprised how tender & tasty they were.  Thanks for the post!

Finally, a pork rib recipe that resulted in very flavorful, juicy, perfectly cooked ribs.  

Grilling ribs has never worked well for me - this recipe and cooking instructions resulted in ribs that were cooked (without charring them), but very juicy (yet not greasy), and could be eaten off the bone easily.

I prepared about 2 1/4lb pork ribs and prepared half the sauce recipe using sweet onions.  I quickly seared the ribs on a baking sheet before basting on the meat-side only and was fairly carful about applying sauce every 20 minutes.  I never flipped my ribs and only basted the meat-side.  I baked them for approx 2 1/2hrs at 350, then turned off the oven for about 40 minutes - after which, I warmed the ribs at 170F for about 10 minutes before serving.

The amount of sauce was right on for my taste, and I wouldn't change the recipe next time as I think it was perfect.

We enjoyed these, but I'd like to keep experimenting with other recipes. These require a lot of maintenance and I didn't care for the homemade sauce. It was a bit salty for my taste. My husband didn't say anything bad about them, nor did he say anything good--just ate them (he won't eat anything he doesn't like), so I give these a 3-star rating.

This was the best ribs I have ever tasted.  The flavor was excellant.  I doubled the recipe for two pounds of ribs.  I just basted once every half an hour or so and came out very juicy and tender.  Was a hit in my house.  Family already wanting me to make them next week.

These ribs came out absolutely amazing! I followed the ingredients exactly. I noticed the directions forget to mention to add the brown sugar to the mix for the BBQ sauce, so I just added it. Also, the directions don't say whether to use foil or not. I cooked the ribs for a total of 3 hours, 2 of those hours I covered the pan with foil (I did not use 2 pans like the directions say.) I basted the ribs every half hour (not every 20 minutes) for the first 2 hours, then took the foil off and basted twice in the last hour. The ribs came out so yummy! Don't worry about the sauce looking watery. The last hour in the oven without foil thickened the BBQ sauce up nicely! Ribs were practically falling off the bone when finished. YUM!

I think the sauce is perfect, as is the temperature and for how long. However, it's a pretty needy recipe when it comes down to it...except that I never follow any of that. 
I make the sauce, put some ribs in the pan, pour the rest of the sauce over it and covered it tightly with tin foil. Only check it at 1.5 hours to turn ribs over, re-cover, and they're done in another 1.5 hours! No browning, no basting! And they always turn out delicious and tender!

I covered with foil and did not baste.  After 1.5 hours I took foil off.  Flipped and cooked for 30 more minutes.  Excellent.  I think all the basting in the original recipe lowers the oven temperature everytime the door was open and therfore extended the cooking time.  They were definetly cooked in 2 hours, and probably were even done before then.  Will make again.

These were AMAZING! I skipped the braising (I was too lazy) and added about 1/2 cup of diced celery. I didn't bother with the basting. Just poured all the sauce over them, covered and cooked for 2 hours, uncovered and cooked for another hour. This is my new favorite recipe!

I am not going to BBQ ribs ever again.  You cannot loose with this recipe.  The ribs fell off the bone.  Unbelievable.  I followed the review where I covered the ribs with foil for the first two hours.  Then took the foil off and sauced the top of the ribs.  30 minutes later, sauce the top again.  30 minutes more of cook time and take them out.  Crazy insane food orgasm goodness.

I followed the sauce recipe exactly, by half, with 2.5 lbs. of thick bone-in pork chops, and added a little liquid smoke. Delicious! The sauce is so simple. 

I cooked it at 300 degrees for 3 hours, the first hour with half the sauce, covered, then removed the cover for the rest of the time because the sauce was so watery. Added sauce at hour 1 and 2, scraping the sauce off the foil the last time because it was setting up pretty good. It did not burn that way.

The meat was fall-apart tender and the sauce was perfect thick and sticky and tasted just right, no tomato ketchup tang, which I was concerned it might have. We both loved this and will definitely make it again.

These were really good. I changed a few things though; instead of heating them in a skillet, I boiled them for about 20 mins first. You can eliminate a lot of gresy fat that way. then I baked them for 25 mins to brown them. Then added the sauce and made as directed. Tastey!

Made the additional sauce as someone recommended but found I simply did not need it so I'm going to try to freeze it.  These were like everyone said. Covered them for 2 hours then uncover for 1 hour.  No need to baste.   Fall off the bone Good. I made the California Cole Slaw Recipe to go with it along with some homemade mountain bread.  So nice to have a summer meal in the middle of winter.

Although nothing quite beats ribs hot off of a charcoal grill, this oven method produces a tender, flavorful, perfectly sauced result.  I do wish I had chopped rather than sliced the onions to avoid stringiness and removed them from the oven about 5 minutes sooner, because some areas were slightly over-caramelized. My unsolicited advice is to watch and smell carefully during  the last 15 minutes for perfection. *Update* I have used this recipe quite a few times, and on one occasion I tried to "cheat" on the frequent basting like others who have posted reviews. The ribs certainly were good without basting at 20 minute intervals, but much better with the extra "attention". The frequent basting does something magical to the sauce and improves the way it clings to the ribs. If you can possibly swing basting at 20 minute intervals, I strongly suggest doing so. The only change I've made to this recipe is to dice rather than slice the onions, because I felt the long, stringy onions detracted from the experience of savoring these delicious, tender, sweet, tangy, perfectly sauced ribs.

I tried this recipe at a slightly lower temperature and cooked for 4 hours. These ribs were very good as the meat just fell off the bones. I did not seer the meet before or after cooking. Good recipe :)

I use this as a pre-grilling receipe and it worked out great.  You can make a huge batch of ribs up in advance and then it only takes a few min on the grill.  This allows you to serve a big party with just one grill.  I will make my ribs up a day/two in advance and just refrig them, or even freeze them.  I just brush on a touch of bbq sauce and then burned them on a hot grill.

Also when baking your ribs - bake them in one of those plastic turkey bags.  This helps keep them moist.

So yummy..... I eliminated the salt and vinegar. I used a low carb bbq sauce. I baked at 400 for the last hour, cause  I wanted to thicken the sauce, and the ribs didnt seem that hot yet.

LOVED this recipe!! Searing the ribs is the trick for sure I believe in this dish. The first time we tried them we found them a bit too 'ketchupy' but they were fall off the bone delicious!! The second time we made these, we used 1cup ketchup and 1cup bbq sauce instead of the 2cups of ketchup.  We used Bulls Eye "sweet and sticky" to compliment with the ketchup - they were amazing, even better than the first time!!!  A tip - use parchment paper when you are cooking these, the clean up is little to none!!

Delicious!!! My family raved about the sauce and tenderness of the ribs. I used country style pork ribs and halved the recipe. Came out superb! I skipped braising as suggested by another review and my meat was fall off the bone tender. I also used a smaller casserole dish and did not need to baste. The sauce covered the meat. Next I am going to try a brisket. This is now my go-to BBQ recipe!

I am only giving these three out of five because although they tasted great, the recipe did NOT indicate whether or not they should be covered.  I took a chance and didnt cover them.  I basted them every 20 minutes as required but the third time i took them out the bottom of the dish was BLACK and CHARRED.  I then covered them with foil and was able to salvage them for the most part but it made a hell of a mess and didnt make me a happy camper.  Someone else posted that they covered them with foil.  I still dont know if the author wants them covered or not but next time I'm covering them from the start.

I made these DELICIOUS ribs for my in-laws last night, and they absolutely LOVED them!! I had only ONE problem following the recipe, and that's because in the "ingredients" portion of the recipe, it calls for brown sugar. However, in the directions it didn't say to place them into the mix. Soooo, I had to go back and re-mix all of my ingredients. It took quite some time and a lot of work for it to be ready. However, in the end; it was worth the wait. They were DELICIOUS!!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars for ease and taste!  I looked at various recipes that required marinading overnight, boiling, ect.  These were ready in just over 2 1/2 hours without marinading or boiling!  We loved the sweet taste of the sauce and loved the onions!  I followed the recipe except for not having dry mustard I used 4tbls of dijon.  Oh, also used 1 cup of regular ketchup and 1 cup spicy ketchup.  All in all these were delicious and so easy to a make.  I did not baste once!  I put in casserole dish, covered with half the sauce and covered with foil and baked for 2 hours.  Then uncovered and put rest of sauce and cooked for an additional 30-45 minutes.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

Beef ribs make this recipe sweet and tangy.  Pork ribs come out a little more subdued.  Try both.

This was a great recipe; my family could not stop eating! I only used 2 lbs of ribs, but the same amount of sauce, which turned out to be the perfect ratio of meat and sauce. I also added a bit of liquid smoke and some molasses. I will definately make these ribs again!

This was so excellent!! The only thing I did different to this recipe was when it was done I took the sauce from the pan and put it in a small pot stiring it on high for about 5 mins to thicken the sauce. Very Very yummy!!)

Delish!  Used country style ribs (boneless) - added 2 tsp of liquid smoke and 2 tbsp of garlic and double the recipe using 4.5 lbs of meat.  The amount of meat was perfect for 6 adults and 3 little kids.  We had way too much sauce so I probably could have gotten by with using the original sauce recipe for 4.5 lbs.  

I covered and turned the meat every 20-30 minutes for 2 hours.  Then left uncovered for the last hour.  Very tasty!!

These were excellent.  Only change I made was to add some hot sauce.   Meat fell off the bone. Beautiful tangy flavour.  This is my new rib recipe to use all of the time.

My husband and I are avid grillers, but living in Kodiak, AK makes it hard sometimes.  He is also hard to please when it comes to meat.  Well, success!!  Phenominal!!  I didn't use all of the bast since it just seemed like a bit too much.  After following the rest of the directions to a T, we threw them on the grill for about 5 minutes. (I love charred meat).  PERFECTO!!!  He was beside himself!!  Great recipe!

this got two stars for the method, not just the bbq sauce. the ribs were dry and yes, the meat detatched itself from the bone but if the meat is dry, it doesn't matter.  the bbq sauce was totally watery and what it reduced to was borderline on burning by the end of the third hour. i should have went with my gut and kept the water out of the recipe and used it in the last hour of cooking (but at 250 for several hours as opposed to 350 for three hours). and the onions were just cumbersome to the sauce itself. i should have just used onion powder. i don't know what recipe the other users were making to be so delighted in this but i certainly wasn't impressed.

AMAZING!!! no one could believe there was no actual bbq sauce. I followed the recipe exactly. I was SHOCKED. I will definately be making these again...and the flipping of the ribs every 20 minutes is sooooo worth it.

These were the best ribs my family has tasted.  I think I figured it out.  We poured just enough sauce to cover the ribs.  Then we basted with just that sauce until it rendered down and added more sauce..just enough to keep it moist.  The sauce, although was thin at first does thicken as it goes along.  We did a double batch of sauce and by the time the ribs were done we used most of it.  The last hour of cooking, the sauce was thick enough to baste with just that.  Yummy..I cut the salt in half but other than that I didn't change anything else..the onions do render down until it melts into the sauce.  I only basted to keep the ribs moist.  This is a keeper and family members are wanting me to make this for our company picnic..ten stars if I could

Holy smoke!  This was so good!  I am so making this again.  I was kind of wondering about the onions but they basically dissolve and become part of the sauce.

My husband compared these ribs to those of a local butcher who has won awards for their ribs.  I saw that someone commented that these are high maintenance.  I just dumped all the sauce on them at the same time and set the oven.  When I came home from work, I had amazing ribs ready to go for supper!  The last time I made this, I found that I had no onions.  I was able to substitute 1/2 c. dried onions and they still turned out amazing!  This is going in the recipe box.

I was skeptical of ribs not cooked on the grill but after reading the reviews I knew I had to try this recipe. They were awesome! I ggot rave reviews from the family. The sauce was perfect. I would highly recommend trying this when making ribs next time. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I made these last night and they were great!!! My boyfriend who only likes a certian BBQ sauce had them and could not get enough of them! the only thing i changed was the salt - i only used half of what the recipe calls for. Since Ketchup has tons of salt in it - i thought 4 more teaspoons would be to much. It came out perfect! Thank you for posting this - i will be using it again

These were just okay. I had never made ribs before. I did like the way they fall off the bone, but the sauce just tasted to much like catsup to me.  Don't think I'll be making again.

I was surprised how this sauce thickened up.  The only changes I made is that I replaced half the water with beer (I actually used dark beer) and I added some allspice and a small amount of liquid smoke.  I didn't cover this and did flip them every 30 mins.  They were totally cooked in 2 1/2 hours. My husband gave them a four but I think he's slanted by thinking of the usual grilled variety of ribs... enjoyed; thank you for the recipe!

The taste and tenderness of these was excellent as everyone says. I gave it four stars because I had problems with my ribs burning in the oven. The recipe doesn't say that the pans should be covered, but I think they should be (I covered with foil after an hour). Also, after the first hour and a half, I decreased the oven temp to 300 degrees. They were still done in three hours and were perfectly tender. Next time I will probably bake at 300 degrees for 4 hours and cover them. I also rubbed the ribs with crushed garlic after I seared them.

To die for!!! This recipe was super-easy and absolutely incredible. I halved the recipe for my hubby and myself, adjusting it as follows...1 tsp salt instead of four, 1/2 7-up and 1/2 water, 1/2 BBQ sauce (Bullseye hickory)and 1/2 ketchup. Also, I put all the sauce in at once, and stirred the pan every 45min or so. Mmm! Definitly a keeper!

Used baby back ribs and only cooked for 2 1/2 hours, were beginning to burn. My husband said "they were good, but not amazing." Good texture, very tender but the flavor was nothing special.

My two carnivores rated these ribs a ten!  We will definitely prepare these again! The last hour I covered them with foil - everything else was done exactly like Vicky recommended.  YUM!

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out very well!  However, I have also cooked these slightly differently using the same sauce recipe- ~4-6 hours in a crock pot and then broiled for a few minutes to crisp them.  I prefer the crock pot method because they turn out more fall off the bone prepared that way.

I've never made ribs before. These were fantastic, fall-off-the-bone delicious! They took a lot of time and basting, but they turned out great. I only basted them every 30 minutes (I'm lazy), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Yum!

I was doubtful, I mean, ribs can be had to do well, turn out tough.  BUT not with this recipe! Wow!  My husband ask for this all the time - juicy, fall of the bone and easy to make.  I'm not the greatest cook but these were my masterpiece!  Made them for Sunday football too - the guys were raving!! Asking if I could give them the recipe : ).

These were SO good !!! I did omit the salt and added 3 tsp liquid smoke, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, and accidently added molasses to the wrong dish...made no difference. I put some sauce on the bottom of the pan, then put the meat in and added more sauce . Then I covered and didn't disturb for 1 hour. I turned them over added more sauce, then covered and didn't disturb for 1 more hour. Then I took the cover off and checked them closely every 20 minutes for the remaining hour...fall off the bone, melt in your mouth goodness !!!!

Yum Yum!!  These are awesome!! I mixed and made my own sauce out of Stubb's moppin' sauce, ketchup, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne, salt, honey and Chalula.  I also let the ribs sit for a couple of days to soak in the olive oil and Stubb's spicy rub that I had rubbed on them.  Cooked covered for two hours and then uncovered for another 40 min.  Didn't even need to brown them first.  They turned out spicy and delicious!!  I will definitely be making these again.

This was the first time I ever made bbq ribs, and my boyfriend was really impressed.  Next time, however, I would make more sauce so you can pour that over your ribs.  Secondly, I would add a tablespoon of cayenne pepper, and more brown sugar, and that would make the perfect ribs!!

Fantastic recipe! This was my first time cooking ribs and although it was time consuming, it was 100% worth it. I had guests over and they couldn't stop talking about how great these were. They were juicy and tender, and the sauce was absolutely perfect. I was a bit skeptical about the ketchup, because I don't like ketchup, but it didn't taste a bit like ketchup. The only change I made was using apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. I would most definitely recommend this recipe. These ribs were to die for!

These ribs were good.  I wouldn't say great.  A little salty and the every 20 minute deal was tedious.  I ran out of sauce and I think the oven temp was too high for this amount of time.

This sauce is superb. I only had beef ribs so I boiled beef ribs for 20 minutes, poured half the sauce over ribs and bake 15 mins in 425 oven, pour rest of sauce over and bake 15 more. Fork tender lovin' from the oven. It will not disappoint.

Followed the recipe exactly for the ingredients.  I covered them with foil the first hour, flipped them, recovered for the second hour, flipped them again, added the rest of the sauce and left uncovered the last hour.  They were falling off the bone and absolutely delicious!  Great recipe!

OMIT THE VINEGAR!  These ribs were great, but too vinegary. Remember, boneless ribs don't take nearly as long to cook!

I can't give this 5 stars because all I did was use a commercial brand bbq sauce to coat the ribs and baste with. But I did use the oven temp and the cooking time! I started out with the ribs covered, but after 30 mins when I went to baste them, they were so goopy I left the foil off the rest of the time. They were fork-tender and a hit with the family. Thanks for the basic recipe!

Due to the heavy rain last night we could not BBQ outside, so this was great way to make ribs.  Only change I made was I boiled the ribs for 20 minutes in salted water,cooled and put a rub on them for one hour & baked as instructed. They were very tender & tasty! Thank you.

I did not cook the ribs like it says in this recipe.  I boiled my ribs and poured the sauce over.  I only used 1 tsp of salt instead of 4 tsp. as stated in the recipe. This sauce is one of my favorites.  well done.

Great ribs! So tender the meat just falls off the bone. I did, however, follow others' lead and cut the salt, though; also cut the temperature to 325 deg. and cooked for 4 hours. We are going to make these again for sure! Thanks!

Ok...these are seriously the best oven baked ribs I have ever eaten!!! I added a little liquid smoke to the sauce and left out the water to make the sauce thick. Perfectly tender and juicy!!!!

This is fantastic.  I did not vary the ingredients at all. I thought about using some garlic but decided not to.  I think this is perfect and would not try to improve on it.  Except I did use the recipe again but this time on chicken and it was perfect.  I will make this over and over.

I am by no means a great cook but I have to admit that the ribs I made from this recipe were fantastic! The recipe was easy to follow and execute. The meat was so tender that it was falling off the bone and the flavor was superb. These could easily become a staple of my weekly diet as they are that good. GREAT RECIPE!!

My family LOVED this recipe.  I used boneless country ribs and covered the dish for an hour like others suggested.  Then I basted every 20 minutes for about 2 1/2 hours.  Very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this.  Ran out way to fast.  Will make double batch next time. I would not recommend just dumping the whole sauce in there as last reviewer stated.  Would make way to runny.  I stuck to the way recipe stated except I too didn't baste as often because of opening oven and letting heat out.  One every half hour worked for me.  Keeping it in for two hours and half hours made sauce really thick.  Will make this again.

Tried this tonight...probably the best ribs I have ever made.  I did add a dash of liquid smoke to the sauce along with some garlic.  Thought I was going to run out of sauce so i added half a jar of Honey jalapeño bbq sauce I had in the pantry.  Little labor intensive but well worth the money.

Since I had other chores to do, I put extra sauce on immediately after browning, then covered with foil and put in oven. I added more sauce after 90 minutes and120 minutes. They were probably done after about 2.5 hours, but the family was home in three hours to devour them! Super moist and tender!

I love grilling ribs and I am pretty good at it.  Looking for an alternative to the grill found this receipe and WOW! This ones are the best!  Everyone we serve them to love them.  My favorite part is that after the preping and once in the oven, I can pretty much forget about them for a while (unlike the grill) and can take care of other bussines or just relax while getting ready for dinner.

I made as instructed.  I think it was too salty.  If I make it again, I would omit all of the salt and taste the sauce to see if it needed salt.   Disappointed.  I used just shy of the 4 teaspoons of salt.  I think I would also add liquid smoke, garlic powder and cayenne pepper next time.

I made this recipe today. DELICIOUS!!!!! My husband was so impressed !!  I just followed the steps changing the servings for 3 people. I agree, it is certainly quite a bit of salt. Add half of what it requires. As the sauce gets thicker, the salty it gets.
This is definitely a keeper. All the credits to VickyDee.

I made these last night for my son's birthday dinner. The only very minor thing I changed, was adding a splash of molasses as I only had light brown sugar. Yes, the sauce is soupy, but don't worry. They were AMAZINGLY tender. We are talking fall-off the bone juicy. Did not need a knife at all. Everyone raved about them. Definitely making again.

I tried it as-is, with one exception, I finished the ribs for 10 minutes on the grill. They were HORRIBLE. While baking in the oven, the sauce caramelized, so that I had little or nothing to baste with at the end. (And - yes - my oven IS at the right temperature.) The ribs were certainly tender (well, they SHOULD be after cooking for 3 hours) but the flavor was bland, greasy

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I used pork side-ribs. I made it exactly as directed and they turned out great! I baked for about 1.5hrs covered with foil. For the other 1.5hrs I turned and basted them every 20-30 minutes. A bit of a pain, but definitely worth it! The second time I made them, I was in a rush, didn't make the full sauce quantity and was a bit careless with the timing and basted every half-hourish. They turned out a little dry, but still fantastic! Great recipe, thank you!

My husband made these for me two years ago and I loved them (and have cooked them many times since.) We used Carolina BBQ sauce (mustard based) and thought they were delicious. The only thing was they were slightly overdone, in my opinion, so next time I'd cut down the time just a tad. Still a great dish!

Have never posted a review before but felt compelled....I have never made ribs before - always was a little afraid. These were DELICIOUS. My kids cannot stop raving! I made half the sauce for 4 lbs ribs, only because I was low on Ketchup. PERFECT.

I taught my man to make ribs with this recipe and he's been the rib-maker in the family for four years with this recipe. It even beats my mom's ribs. The only adjustment he's made is to subsitute half the ketchup for BBQ sauce.

This recipe for ribs was absolutely delicious. I used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup barbecue sauce, I also added a big clove of minced garlic. It smelled so GOOD baking too! Perfect for a Sunday afternoon, I definitely will make these again!

YUMMY!!!  I could not believe how it turned out...I tasted it before i added it to the ribs...and I was a little skeptical...however the sauce cooked down nice and thick..and yumm-E..Browning the ribs prior to baking them is an important step...as Julia Child always reminded us, wet meat do not brown...make sure u pat them dry before adding them to the oill..you will not be disappointed...also, I took one of the reviewers suggestions and added a little garlic powder to it...and a little crushed red pepper that I cant seem to not add to everything I cook...

love these ribs.  I rub them with brown sugar, kosher salt, pepper and little chili powder before searing.  Then bake covered for 2 hours and uncovered for the last hour.  Yummy!!!

I followed the other suggestions about doubling the glaze ingredients.  I liked the idea of cooking the ribs (vs par boiling) before glazing them.  I was concerned that the glaze seemed really thin at first, but it turned to a glaze beautifully!  These ribs had good flavor and the glaze was just enough.  will make these again.

Following the advice of other reviews, I cut the salt to 1 tsp. I baked the ribs, covered, for the first two hours. Then uncovered them and basted for the last hour. They were fantastic. I'm not even a huge fan of ribs, but these were great!

EXCELLENT way to cook ribs. I found this recipe by accident when our grilling plans got rained out. Since this was a spur of the moment decision, I did not have enough ketchup to make the sauce. I just went with my Stubbs sauce I initially bought for grilling, but followed the cooking and basting instructions to a tee. I believe the secret here is the searing, and the basting every 20 minutes. These were the best oven ribs I ever made. None of my other rib baking efforts came close the the taste of grilled ribs until now. Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe. Now, during the winter when there is snow on the ground we can still have delicious spare ribs on our plates. Next time I do plan to use the sauce recipes here as well.

So, so good.  I made this as stated aside from omitting the salt and adding some liquid smoke.  The 20 minute flips were well worth it!  Yummy, moist and flavorful meat! My ribs were done about a half an hour "early", but no biggie.  I was a little leery of the sauce at first - it was really super thin, but it did thicken up and stick to the ribs nicely during the lengthy cooking time.  I will definitely make these again when I am craving ribs have the time to tend to them!

This was an excellent recipe.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that I thought it should have at MOST 2 teaspoons of salt.  It was rather a salty sauce with the 4 teaspoons.  Would use this recipe again.

So good! We only had 3lbs pork spareribs, but followed the recipe almost exactly, only adding a couple dashes of garlic and chili powders, and a splash of soy sauce. It only took the ribs about 2 hr 15 min to cook. We basted & flipped them every 45 mins, and covered with foil like others suggested. These came out so tender, the meat came right off the bone! There was so much flavor in these ribs. This one is definitely a keeper.

I make this recipe as is with added "hot spices" and don't baste as much.  This is a great way to have tasty ribs while the cold winter wind is blowing and the BBQ is buried under mounds of snow.  This is a great dish for Football Sundays

This was a delicious use of some country style ribs I found lurking in the freezer. Instead of 2c of ketchup, I sub'd one of the cups for a cup of BBQ sauce. I also used apple cider vinegar since that was all I had on hand. Turned out fabulous and tender.

I was hesitant about making these because I tend to prefer my ribs grilled and/or smoked and I was REALLY worried when I saw them just sitting in all that liquid.  I used three packages of baby back ribs and doubled the sauce recipe (no onions on the 2nd batch of sauce).    I took the first batch of sauce and took all the onions out and put them on the bottom of two foil grilling trays.  I put sauce on top of that... then I started placing my ribs on that.  I split some in singles and others in doubles.    I did follow the 20 minute basting routine and agree with most everyone that after about 2hours they were nearly done so at that point, I lowered the heat to 300 and kept going.  By the end the sauce was nice and thick and I actually was able to drain off the grease and put the sauce in a gravy boat and serve it next to the ribs.  They were DELICIOUS!  I am beyond impressed with this recipe and it will be made again.    Another perk -- It makes your whole house smell DELICIOUS!

The ribs were very good.  I was not crazy about the sauce.  Will probably use regular bottle of bbq sauce next time.  It was good, just not great.

Sorry folks.  I did everything as directed.  They were quite a bit of work for not a very good end result.  My husband (who ALWAYS consumes left-overs) told me to toss the rest because he didn't want the left-overs.  I have to admit this is the first time in 3 years of marriage that he has done that.  Sorry!

Looked all over for a way to do BBQ ribs in January! This recipe is amazingly good. The onions in the sauce cook down into a thick, carmelize glaze for the ribs...without being too sweet. Meat fell off the bone after only 2 hours, not the 3 hours specified. A recipe I'll make again often now!

Awesome! I only changed a couple things. I added half ketchup and half BBQ sauce ( as previously noted). I love PC beer & chipolte BBQ sauce. I used 2 tsp of salt instead of the 4 listed in the recipe.I added some fresh ground pepper and a couple cloves of garlic. Also covered with foil , and did not baste that much, and they turned out sooo yummy! Thanks! May do them in my slow cooker next time.

I made these last night for dinner for my parents and family....they were very good except they were a little sweet...I didn't add as much water to the sauce as other reviews said it was to watery...I do think, however, if you stir up the sauce in the pan before serving that thickens it up and mixes up all the flavors...next time I will not add any water to the sauce and maybe add a little more vinegar....it was very good though!

Great recipe for ribs on a cold day. I added 1/4 tsp of chipolte pepper sauce and 1/8 tsp of liquid smoke. Covered pan with foil to help speed the cooking process.

Getting slightly impatient for 'grilling season' to arrive, I tried this recipe with hopes it would produce nearly the same results as my usual method of preparing ribs (dry rub marinade, water/beer boil, finish on grill w/sauce).  Of course, it doesn't have that same char-grilled taste, but -wow- I was impressed by how tender the ribs were.  I did find the sauce to be a bit vinegary, so I added a tbs more br. sugar, then for a bit of heat, some red pepper flakes.  Will make again when the weather isn't cooperating.  Thanks!

What a hit this was with my guys. My 14 year old didn't say a word all through the meal...just grunts of pleasure. After the meal he told me I had turned ketchup into magic.  They were awesome and easy to make.  Thanks Vicky.

This was a really good recipe I thought.  Very easy to make, and the ribs were so tender and juicy.  I baked them for less time than the recipe called for and they turned out great!  A bit different than run of the mill BBQ sauce in a bottle.  I would recommend this recipe.

Great recipe! I cooked 4 pounds of ribs and my husband alone ate most of it in one sitting! :) (and he is not a very good eater usually). I do recommend blending onions with the rest of sause in a blender as someone else posted before me. Makes it much easier to baste the ribs. 
I baked them for 2 hours though, instead of 3, and they cooked very well. The first hour and a half I kept ribs covered with aluminum foil and then removed it for the last half hour or so.

Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Place ribs, meat side down, in baking dishes. Cover the baking dishes with aluminum foil and place in the oven. If you are using small baby back ribs, take out after 4.25 hours. If you are using regular baby back or St. Louis style ribs, then take out after 5.25 hours. Drain off the drippings. Flip the ribs over using two spatulas (and an extra set of hands if you have them) so the meat side is up. Be careful, as they may be so tender they fall apart. Put a layer of BBQ sauce on the ribs and return to the oven uncovered for an additional 20-30 minutes or toss on the grill. Remove from oven and serve them up with a side of potato salad and some baked beans.

A great recipe! I did not grow up eating meat nor have much experience in baking/barbecuing any meat so I was quite skeptical about my success in making these ribs. Since my son and Hubby love pork ribs so I gave it a shot and they both just loved it. I have rarely heard my teenager praise any of my food like this. I did not have to bake it for 3 hours. They were just right in about 2h 20 min. It might be due to differences in the oven. Mine is a very new oven. I have already made these twice and and this is bound to become a regular! Thank you for a great recipe.

best recipe for oven cooked ribs I have ever tried. The only thing I added was some minced fresh garlic. I will be making this again and again, next time I will try it with back ribs.

Wrap racks as tightly as possible with good rub with a vinegar. Two days for best. Remove membrane if you can. Slice or cut with scissors between each bone.  Bake on broiler pan 2 1/2 - 3 hours on 250. Throw on grill with BBQ sauce. Preheat grill 500. Set all to low wait 10 minutes. Place ribs on grill. One burner left on place racks over no flame close lid 15 min.

Wow! What a surprise & really good. A few changes - I marinade iribs in one of my favorite sauces, use mustard because I didn't have any dry mustard and added a cup of BBQ sauce. Also,  I cover the ribs for the first two hours. The ribs was delicious and I will use the recipe often! !

These ribs are delicious! I don't bother basting them….I just cover them with foil for the first 2.5 hours and then I remove the foil, spoon some of the cooked sauce over the top and bake uncovered for the remaining 30 minutes. My entire family loves them. Sometimes I add diced green pepper to the recipe. Enjoy!

Easy to prepare. Omitted mustard, none on hand. Didn't bother with browning in skillet beforehand. Just threw in oven covered in foil at 400 for 1 hour then 350 for another hour and a half. Uncovered and flipped at the end of 2 1/2 hours and left uncovered for another 30 minutes.  These were delicious! Next time will use half the salt.

I started at 375F and after 1 hour 30 mins, I turn it down to 350F. So I get that brown and burn skin faster. Then I roasted for another half hour with foil covered, half hour no foil, and pour rest of the sauce at the last half hour, it turns out so flavorful! My hubby and kids love them. I'm definitely making this in a bigger batch next time!!

I was looking for an oven baked recipe for BBQ ribs and these were DELICIOUS!

I followed other people's recommendations and reduced the salt to 1 tsp (and I love salty food too, so can't imagine what 4 tsp would have tasted like!).  I was not really in the mood to stand by the oven and baste every 20 min, so I created an aluminum foil pouch and cooked the ribs and half the sauce in this for 2 hours, then opened the pouch, added the rest of the sauce, and cooked for another hour.  The meat literally fell off the bone, and it required very little attention!

I was a bit worried when I tasted the sauce before cooking, and even more worried when I opened my foil pouch and it was all separated.  After the full cooking time it was great tasting, though still looked a bit chunky from the onions.  I think possibly next time I'll open the pouch at the 1 1/2 hour mark instead of 2 hours, and start off with 2/3 of the sauce in the pouch.  These also reheat well, and I think the sauce tasted even better the second time around!

Made this with store bough BBQ sauce, 2.25lbs pork spare ribs at 350 for just under 3 hours. Basted and flipped every 30 minutes or so. They looked more and more amazing and were falling off the bone. Totally delicious! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!

This is was SUPERB! I didnt think it required a lot maintenance, I thought it was quite simple.   
**B/C my family is so fickle I didnt use onions. but while browning in the skillet I seasoned w/ Mrs. Dash onion & herb & a lil salt & pepper. I only light brown sugar (it didnt seem to make a difference) I forgot to buy dry mustard so I squirted about 1T of regular yellow mustard, again it didnt seem to make a difference. I used rib tips. I preheated oven for 10mins. I poured enough sauce in the baking pan to pratically cover the ribs. I turned them toat them, covered & baked.I did not turn & baste every 20 mins (who has time for that?)about 20mins b4 they were done I poured some more BB@ sauce over them. Just so you know when they were done, they did look like they were gonna be dry BUT looks were deceiving the meat was falling off the bone, so tender delicious. Oh I did cheat a lil. I mixed in almost a whole bottle of store bought BBQ sauce b/c I accidentally poured too much vinegar. I doubled all the ingredients & bottled it so I would have it the next time I make these. My 10 yr old is asking when am I fixing these again! :)  Oh yeah maybe 1/3 C brown sugar would've worked vs 1/2 C

These were pretty good. I didn't bother basting the ribs as the sauce was deep enough in my pan to half cover the ribs at all times. I just flipped them every 45 minutes or so. They turned out fall off the bone tender and flavourful. Will make again.

Seriously amazing. I did put them in a glass dish and cover them with foil, uncovering them to add the sauce. They took longer to cook but turned out fantastic and coated with gooey sauce.

Made these last night for dinner, and yes they were great, but just a bit too salty for me. Next time I'll just leave out the salt all together.

Excellent! Husband loved this! Made two half batches of sauce. Didn't have dry mustard so I added the wet stuff. One batch I added a bit of Frank's Red Hot sauce. Both were amazing! Now my goto recipe. About the last half hour I added in a can of chesnuts and they came out amazing! (Next time I'm wrapping bacon around the chestnuts then baking)

This recipe is great!! I was a little nervous but the reviews helped a lot. I pretty much followed the recipe except everyone said to cut back on the salt so I did. Next time I will salt and pepper the ribs before I brown them. Thank you for the easy way to cook ribs without a grill.

These were fall off the bone perfect. I was so surprised to find ribs this good from an electric oven! I live in France, where brown sugar is impossible to find, so I used regular sugar, and still they were perfect. I was somehow patient enough to turn and baste every 20 minutes, so perhaps that did the trick.

this tasted okay.  ribs were tender.  I like more saucy ribs though.  I think the cooking method is the key- not the ingredients.

These were tender, but we didn't care for the sauce.  In the future I'll use this same baking method with a more traditional bbq sauce for basting.

My sauce came out clumpy, and not as easy as BBQ sauce to spread, but it still tasted good.  I used 1 cup of chopped dried onions as opposed to fresh and it worked fine.  I also threw in some garlic and used galic salt and Johnny's instead of regular salt.  This recipe isn't mind blowing, but it is pretty good.

Both my husband and I thought these were fantastic! I used baby back ribs and more like 3 lbs so I shortened the cooking time to 2 1/2 hours and then took out of the oven and covered with foil.  My husband thought that last half hour out of the oven covered with foil may have made them even better. They were so tender and flavorful.  Will for sure make them again.  Thanks!

For easy cleanup I lined my dish with foil and followed the recipe to as written, I covered the ribs with foil and bake for 2 hrs and then removed foil and baste twice for the last hour. Everyone loved this ....... maybe next time I will reduce water to 1 1/2 and add1/2 CUP JACK DANIELS for a different twist.  Thanks vicky

These were delicious and a very easy recipe.  I did press 2 cloves of garlic into the sauce as I read in some other reviews.  I just poured all of the sauce in when I first started to bake them.  I flipped them a few times during the 3 hours of baking.  When they were done the meat just will just fall right off the bone.  Very good and I will make these again! Thanks!

I followed this recipes as written. I saw some posts concerned with too much salt, but I wasnt able to taste it. The only thing I would suggest is place foil on your pan because the sugars char and it is quite tough to get off. Other than that I gave it 4 stars because it was good. It is quite time consuming to flip every 20 minutes but these were falling off the bone by the end!

I didn't have any mustard, so I skipped that and we didn't notice. I cut the ribs into smaller sections before cooking, which cut the cooking time down to about 2 hours. I didn't baste and flip all the time, just poured 3/4 of the sauce, covered it in foil and baked. Put on the rest of the sauce on in the last half hour of cooking. Turned out great. I think we will definitely be making this one again.

Since I made the mistake of not reading the recipe thoroughly before grocery shopping, I had to make several substitutions: 1. no onions :( - used dried onion powder instead  2. no dark brown sugar - used light brown sugar instead  3. no dry mustard - used real spicy brown mustard instead, about 2 tablespoons  4. ran out of ketchup, so only used about 1 cup  5. Used 5 lbs of ribs and still had lots of leftover sauce  What I can say is that even with all these changes (and work), this was an amazing recipe. My advice is to just experiment and don't worry about messing up! It's going to come out awesome anyway!

I've made this recipe several times and it has always turned out tasting great!  I'm thinking about using some liquid smoke next time around to get a flavor similar to having done them in a smoker.  I've done this recipe with spare ribs and baby backs, I prefer the baby backs because they're a little leaner and come out with a slightly "crunchy" outer layer with tender meat underneath.

This was great ricipe, this as close to grill ribs as you can get. However I don't think shearing the ribs is nessesary since one side is curve. Be careful with the baking time, 3 hours is to long.

I added half the salt as suggested by other reviewers and found it to be enough.  This is the first baked bbq ribs that my family loved!! My niece, who never likes ribs, loved these and ate seconds!  There was a lot of lip smacking at our dinner table tonight! Thank you, Vicky.

The Best Ribs I have made. Fall off the bone and cut with fork tender. Great sauce flavor too. I used a roaster because I knew I would not be home to baste alot so I added all the sauce after first twenty minutes and made sure all meat was covered. Worked like a charm! Even our guests raved about them. thanks!

Whole family loved this one.  Great with mashed potatoes.  I made these on the stove in my Dutch oven.  First boiled the ribs, then drained them, reserving enough cooking water for the recipe.  Poured ribs + all other ingredients back into the pot and simmered, covered, for 3 hours, stirring now and then.  So sad that there were no leftovers, but I'll make them again!

My college son and hubby loved this. Rave reviews.  I too loved it.  I did 1/2 catchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce as many cooks said. I omitted the salt.  I'll be making for a tailgate party in the fall for my son's game!  Go Scots!

These are the best ribs I have tasted.  I have made them 3 times already and will be making again.  I had to make them for my son and daughter-in-law when they came home for vacation.  They loved them also.  The only thing I did different was to use half ketcup & half BBQ sauce and I did not use very must salt.  I will be making these again for my other sons.

It was a great way to make ribs without a gril, but the sauce was disappointing. I had to substitute light brown sugar for the dark, and I took other users' advice and cut the salt. It was still missing a "sweet & tangy"-ness that I love. Also, I made a 6-lb. rack of ribs, and they were perfect at three hours- if you're going to use only 4 pounds, I'd advise adjusting the temp or cook time accordingly.

Brilliant,Vicki Dee, the recipe is terrific.  Made it second time using 1/3 each cup of tomato sauce, BBQ sauce,honey and 1/4 cup each soy sauce and vinegar as the sauce, that was good too, your method gives the tenderest meat ever. Good on ya, from OZ

My husband said they were the best ribs ever! I had alot of sauce left over so I bagged and froze it. I did add some spicy barbeque sauce to the mix. I like more bite and tang. The sauce is perfectly versatile. Use on Elk and Venison ribs - Deelish! Thak you for a super recipe!

I don't usually change a recipe the first time I make it, but it was either that or yet another trip to the store.  I  didn't have enough Worcestershire so I used some soy sauce.  After deciding to make a double batch of the sauce, I realized I didn't have enough ketchup either, so I doubled everything but the ketchup and substituted Dave's Devil's Spit, a very spicy BBQ sauce.  Wow!  The homemade sauce and the store-bought sauce were wonderful together!  I had 14 lbs. of ribs so it seemed to take forever to brown all of them, but it was sure worth it.  Fixed this way, they were fall apart done.

These are really good - definitely a keeper.  We wanted something different from turkey so we made these for Thanksgiving - lol.  They were excellent, wonderful flavor and falling off the bone.  I covered them with foil for the first hour which I think is a must as near the end some of the sauce started to char.  A little char is good, but I think had I not covered them it might have been too much.  Also I only basted every half hour as this is what I would normally do for a turkey.  Great recipe!

These turned out great!  I used light brown sugar and only 2.5lbs of ribs so we had extra sauce.  My husband said that I have to make the barbeque sauce for every cook-out now :)

I did not have dried mustard on hand so I couldn't follow the recipe exactly - but I am sure I would have given it five stars otherwise. It was delicious even w/o the mustard. I used 1 cup BBQ sauce and 1 cup ketchup as was suggested by others.

These are amazing and simple.  The only changes I made was I used 1/2 the salt it called for and I turned and basted every 30 minutes instead of every 20.  They were falling off the bone and so yummy.  The sauce thickened nicely.  I have been telling everyone I talked to today about this amazing recipe and will be passing it on to others.  I may try less brown sugar next time as they were a little sweet for my husbands taste but I thought they were PERFECT!!!

I marinated the ribs for 12hrs in the fridge before slow cooking.  The ribs were great and I would definitely cook them again.  I did reduce the salt like others suggested.

Delicious! I used boneless and put them all in a 9 x 13. The only problem I had was the sauce being too thin, I had to drain the pan once. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing, and the guests and the fam loved them!

The whole family LOVED this, even my picky 4 year old.  I used boneless ribs and reduced the heat to 300 and cooked for 4 hours also covered for the first 1 1/2 hours.  AWSOME  and very tender!

Ribs were fully cooked after 2 hours. I also did not have time to baste every 20 minutes, so I put all of the sauce in up front. Ribs were nice and tender but the sauce was not enjoyed by my son. I too didn't really like the taste of the sauce, it was not quite as sweet I would like and it was a little runny. Not my favorite, but good nonetheless.

This was pretty good actually!  I really like the taste of the sauce.  I too blended it in the blender and I also added some Cayenne, because we like it really spicey!  I will probably make this again!  I used small ribs so I only cooked for an hour, they were nice and tender!

Before this recipe I had never made ribs. They came out amazing!!! They were finished after 2hrs. with basting every 20 min. If I would have left them in the full 3 hrs. they would have been very well done at the 350 temp. I used beef spare ribs instead of pork because they appeared "healthier". I put all of the sauce ingredients into the blender to liquify, mainly because I wanted the onions blended in.

This recipe made beef ribs taste excellent! I used 2 1/2 lbs of beef ribs instead of 4 lbs of pork and there was more than enough sauce to last the first two hours. And the meat really did fall off the bones! I also threw in some chili pepper for a kick and it tasted great. I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

So Good!!! The meat was very tender and outside had a very nice crust. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I omitted all the salt, used Apple cider vinegar and covered for the first 2 hours and uncovered for the last 1. Next time I may use a brush to baste instead of spooning over because my pans were very messy afterwards. But it was so good, everyone loved it. I will 100% make again.

I made this for dinner tonight. 

The only change I made was to eliminate most of the salt. ( I used 1 tsp of salt, not 4. I'm hoping that was a misprint! )

We all loved it. Hubby said it was as good if not better than what you'd get in a restaurant. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

Liked the flavor and the meat fell of the bone this process. I liked the simplicity of the overall process. An adjustment was to let it bake with 3/4 the sauce covered for 2 hours, then basted and allowed to cook uncovered for the last hour.

This recipe was so easy and sooooo delicious! What I did differently was I omitted all of the salt and I wrapped the ribs tightly in foil. After first 1/2 hour of baking, I turned over the foil wrapped ribs and baked for the next hour and a half.  I then opened the foil and poured in the rest of the sauce and spooned it over the uncovered ribs every 20 mins.  I do not cook much but this was so simple and everyone loved it! Definitely saved in my favorites!!

I didn't care for the dryness of the meat; although it was tender it wasn't juicy like they are in the crock pot. I won't be making this recipe again.

I added about 1 tsp  liquid smoke and I had the butcher cut the rib across the bone so I could serve as appetizers.

Definitely the best ribs ever. This will be my go to recipe. Added bonus: despite the sticky mess left in the roasting tin, after gently scraping the loosest off, the dishwasher did the rest. Perfect.

Love this! For oven baked ribs, they are excellent. I only had one onion, and only used a teaspoon of salt. Everything else was by directions. I covered with foil for the first 2 hours and uncovered for the last hour. I did turn the ribs over when I uncovered them. Sauce thickened nicely. My husband loved them.

Love it, flavor is great, falling off the bone tender, juicy, delicious!  I love grilling but perhaps the best part of it all is that once started in the oven I am free to roam around doing other chores/hosting.  This is the fourth or fifth time I make this but the first time I have all the ingredients on the list, meaning you can easily adjust most of them.  Thank you, my family gets very excited every time I suggest this option!

My family Loved These ribs! my husband and son tend to be picky but the tenderness and flavor of the meat had them both requesting me make it again. My husband is allergic to onions so I made 1/4 of these ribs without onions on the upper part of the oven and the whole thing came out great no problems.

These were sooooo yummy!!! I didn’t have enough regular ketchup so had to use half regular and have siracha ketchup which gave them a little kick. ?? Thank you for this fantastic recipe...I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I made these ribs, excited about the simplicity of the recipe!  As they cooked, they smelled like something my mother made when I was growing up.  The pork spareribs were fall off the bone tender.  The sauce was very vinegary and my family decided they liked traditional bbq sauce better.  Oh well, I tried.  You be the judge...

I didn't use any salt, ketchup has enough. A dash of red pepper flakes, gave the ribs just a little kick. 1st time I used riblets they were done in 2 hours. Sauce was tangy both  casserole pans we're gone. 
This  time I used baby backs, I also added sliced garlic about 5 cloves,  and 1/ 4tsp cumin. I don't cover them at all. I also don't flip ribs until half way through cooking.

We loved it. I have made this recipe now about four times. Each time I’ve done it a little bit differently but always used the same ingredients.   I always make twice as much sauce as it’s called for because we like the sauce so much. One time I had quite a bit left over and froze it. About six weeks later I thawed it and used the sauce with chicken and the chicken was excellent. So from my point of view the sauce is good for either chicken or pork. Thanks for such a great recipe.

I've loved it every time I've made it. Some alterations, cut the brown sugar in half, and add a 1/2 cup of honey, as well as several cloves of Garlic. Or you can replace the water with Coke, which makes the Ribs even more tender.

The BBQ sauce was quite good, but the ribs were not “fall off the bone”tender. I didn’t cover the glass casserole dish (recipe didn’t call for that) and I’m still working at getting all the burnt sauce on it today. Won’t do this one again.

Very good.  I'm always late in planning when I want ribs.  This works out surprising well.  Sauce thickened up nicely and ribs were melt in your mouth.  Maybe even better the next day!

I made these  ribs a month ago and can't wait to do it again. These were the best ribs I've ever made and/or had.  I have to admit I cheated a bit and started them out in the slow cooker.  I added a splash of (albeit, expensive) bourbon whiskey  to the homemade sauce, and I really think that made a big difference.  I finished them off in the oven to carmelize the sauce.  OMG, sooo amazingly good!

I made this today and followed the directions exactly. Mine were done in 1hour. Falling off the bone perfection. I covered for 1 hr at 350 and turned and basted every 20 minutes. Can't imagine why anyone needs 3 hrs.

This is my go to rib recipe. The only change I make is using less water, and I don't braise the meat. I put the ribs and sauce inside foil packets, and just leave it for 3 hours in the oven.

I followed this recipe and was so disappointed, I did not find it a winner. I was expecting a wow meal due to the great ratings I read. The ribs were very tender and fall off the bone. It was not as tasty as  when I use store bought B'Cue sauce and so much less work.

Easy and inexpensive. I had all the ingredients to make it except the meat in my cupboards. I will make this again and will be a favorite of the family. My husband is a picky eater when it comes to ribs, he had no complaints about this recipe!

Just finished eating these. I made exactly as written and I did not like them at all. Not very good, in my opinion. I will not make again, at least not using this sauce.

I made these Oven Baked BBQ Ribs. And even though the recipe was spot on, I thought that if I make them again I would not bake them for 3 hours. I would probably try at 2 or 2 and Half Hrs.

5 stars for ease and outcome - like many on here I haven't had a lot of luck with ribs but these turned out very well. I halved the amount of water and salt. Next time I will add a little cayenne pepper to give it an edge. I live in China and the often hard to please Chinese families who joined us both asked for the recipe. No leftovers.

I usually half this recipe as it's just my husband and I. I love the way this always comes out--no awful surprises. I use this for all kinds of ribs, usually boneless as we like those best. I have also made up a batch of just the sauce to have on hand for chicken, pork, etc. The sauce on it's own is great. I have also made this ahead of time as it does take 3 hours to take to pot lucks etc. When I do this, I simply put the ribs and sauce in a crock pot  on low for about 2 hours and off it goes, down in advance yet all heated up perfectly.

These are not the sticky kind of ribs we are used to but these were sooooo good.  The meat was so flavorful and fell off the bones.  My kitchen smelled wonderful while these were in the oven which only heightened our anticipation.  We were not disappointed.  Thank you for this recipe.

I only used 3lbs of ribs so I had left over sauce, which I will use for BBW chicken.

This recipe creates amazing ribs. I suggest sitting in a chair when basting to avoid an aching back.  Time consuming, but definitely worth it.

2tsp of salt instead of 4. 1 cup chicken broth to replace 1 cup water. This receipe is a favorite of my husbands,they are so tender. I used porkback ribs.
                   I just made these in the instant on the meat/stew setting, with the wire inset and 1 1/2 c of water. Cooked for 25 minutes. Made the sauce on top of the stove. Cooked the onions in a fry pan until they were see through and then transferred to a pot and poured the sauce in and boiled on medium heat until it thickened up. Took ribs out of instant and put them in a roasting pan on broil, turning until all ribs are browned then poured on the sauce and cooked for 1/2 hour more.

Yummy and easy way to make ribs, use disposable foil pans for easy clean up!  broil each side of ribs on high instead of browning them on stove, Cover ribs and put 1/4" water in bottom of pan cook covered for 2 hours, uncovered for last hour and baste with sauce. didn't really baste that much and used bottled sauce and it was still yummy!

After reading the recipie and what one person said, I too omitted the salt as there is so much salt in the other ingredients and I'm glad I did. It was perfect without it.  
(Since I'm  a Diabetic I used Splenda blend Brown Sugar  and Heinz Ketchup with no added sugar . Both items didn't affect the recipie but cut the sugar content.)
We only needed half the amount of sauce especially with one full rack of ribs. I also cover the pan for two hours and left it off for the remaining hour. I will add extra water as I basted the ribs every 15 minutes and the sauce became thick and drying  out  without the extra water. 
My husband said that these were the best ribs ever! 
I will definitely  make them again.

I have been BBQing for years and this is the first time that I have had every guest ask for this recipe!  Each person was literally eating every last piece of meat off the bone.  I followed what the others suggested - I covered with foil for the first 2 hours and then cooked uncovered the last 1 hour.  I basted every 30 minutes.  I was concerned about how watery the marinade was but it really thickens in the oven the last hour uncovered.  I also reduced the salt (by half).  I tripled the recipe and it all still worked really well.  It is a bit labor intensive - but worth every minute!!  These are great ribs for a special occasion.

I made this tonight and it was the best bbq ribs I have made from scratch!  I made the sauce a day before to save some time.  I browned the ribs, added half the sauce and baked for 2 hours covered.  Then I flipped the ribs, poured rest of sauce and finished baking 1 more hour uncovered.  I made with Mac and cheese and my whole family loved it!  Thank you for this recipe!!

Whoaaaa.. did not expect this from such a simple recipe! I cheated and tried a Costco Lemon Ginger Sesame marinade/dressing (normally.. I'd use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce).  I placed them on a lg cookie sheet (lined with aluminum foil), slathered with the marinade.. then sealed them in with foil. I only flipped/basted the ribs every hour.  At 3 hrs I hauled them out to the BBQ and gave them a couple min on each side to crisp up.  For sure the best pork ribs I've ever made OR served!  Next time I think I'll grill them first for a couple minutes .. then go to the oven.  They were a little tricky to get on/off the grill in one piece (because they were DONE to perfection) but I managed.  Insanely EASY and the long slow cook gives you plenty of time to make the rest of the meal.  I LOVED THIS!

I made this yesterday and it was amazing!!! It was really easy to make for a beginner. Usually a lot of food is left over after each meal but those ribs disappeared without a trace! Will definitely make this again. :)

I've been chasing tender, fall-off-the-bone BBQ ribs for a while. I finally decided to try something other than the BBQ so I found an oven recipe. My wife didn't want to try these, so I was only cooking half a rack, about 1.2 pounds. So I adjusted the recipe ingredients accordingly and these turned out very very good. I added a tbsp of liquid smoke and some Tapatio hot sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe. I baked them in a small glass casserole and they ended up about 3/4 submerged in the sauce. I also covered them with foil for the first hour and a half, but then they were done by two hours of baking. I guess you give up the "bark" by braising in the oven. The flavor was really great. My wife was jealous, she just cooked her half straight over high heat with season all, she's a picky eater and rarely ventures off. Anyway, great recipe. Next I want to try a slow cooker method, then experiment with incorporating time on the BBQ to get that true BBQ experience. I will make this again no question.

I actually followed the recipe as it reads for the most part.  The only change I made was grainy mustard for dry mustard because that was the availability in my kitchen.  It was really good.  Two messy thumbs up.

These were the best ribs ever!! I used yellow prepared mustard, 2 tsp. and baked them in a porcelain/cast iron Dutch oven.  I did baste them faithfully every 20-25 minutes.  Excellent!! I am making them for our Valentine's Day evening meal!

Holy cow, these ribs were amazing!  I made the sauce as it calls but instead of saucing every 20 minutes, I just put them meat side down in the pan and covered with foil for 2 hours.  Took the foil off for 1 additional hour, first meat side down for 30 minutes, then flipped for the last.  I sauced the top of the ribs when I flipped them, 15 minutes later and then when I finally took them out.  Covered them with foil till we were ready to eat.

Fell off the bone while I was serving it!  The sauce was just saucy enough to leave some on your fingers, but not too where that's all you taste.  I don't typically leave reviews but this was just way too good to not give it props.

Delicious flavor! I had some ribs in the fridge I needed to cook, but didn't want to do my usual. Found this recipe and I had everything I needed in the kitchen. Easy prep. I poured 2/3 of the sauce over the ribs and baked them covered for the first hour, then uncovered and added the remaining sauce and baked for another hour and fifteen minutes. The onions give it an amazing flavor and they fall off the bone. I'll definitely make these again.

Delish! I made this for my family.  The sauce was so good that it could be sold separately.  I did not embellish this recipe and it turned out fantastic.  Well I did add a little more brown sugar. It was simply off the chain delicious and my family loved it.  The next time I may skip the vinegar but either way the meat is so tender and the sauce is crazy good.  Cook with confidence with this recipe it's goof-proof and I promise you everyone who gets to taste, will be impressed.

Best ribs ever!!! I was a little worried about the 350 degrees for 3 hours but the ribs were fall-off-bone tender and the onions added so much flavor to the ribs. Everyone who ate them asked for the recipe. I'll be using this recipe from now on.

My family has gone crazy over these ribs! This makes incredibly succulent ribs and they are SO flavorful. They've been demanded again and again. The only thing I did differently was to put them in an oven-roasting bag (I use Reynolds turkey-size bags and cut a few thin strips in the bag). That way you don't have to turn them and continue basting them. I also used about a teaspoon of liquid smoke to give them a bit of a "cooked on the grill" taste. Very good recipe!

This is great. I changed it up a bit; did not add salt, used apple cider vinegar instead of white, A-1 steak sauce, and honey mustard, did NOT add water and left the ketchup as-is. It came out fantastic!

These are excellent ribs.  I followed the ingredients list exactly the first time I made it. Definitely makes a lot of sauce so you may want to cut it down.  I didn't think basting was necessary so often, I just basted every 60 minutes and took the ribs out after 2 1/2 hours. I love these so much I make them at least once a month.

This was my first time w/ oven baked ribs. This is a very good recipe.
There is a great deal of sauce but if you keep basting the ribs while cooking you will use most of the sauce. Some questions have been raised by others as to whether to cover the ribs or not. I covered (loosely) the ribs w/ foil for the first hour and then baked uncovered for the remainder of the time. This enabled the sauce to bake into the ribs and to form a nice coating on the exterior of the ribs. Also in lieu of the water I used one cup of a lager beer. The beer reduced the sweetness of the sauce which results from the ketchup.

I live in Alabama and have eaten my fair share of BBQ. There are many types of BBQ and knowing the type you like is important. This recipe is on the tangy side. And while I was skeptical of a Ketchup based sauce, it was very good and very, very easy to make. Not five stars, but certainly better than average - four stars. 

PS - I serve with mashed potatoes and use the remaining cooked drippings as a gravy.  Everyone from Nana to the kids really enjoy it.

I made the BBQ ribs tonight for dinner, they were WONDERFUL, I think browning the ribs first made all the difference, very easy to make and it was a HUGE hit with my husband. I'm so glad tried this recipe, Thank you for posting it.

I have tried this recipe many times and my family loves it especially my husband. The only changes I made were less salt and no Frying in Skillet and it taste the same as with skillet.

My mother made these ribs for me a while ago and I'm STILL dreaming about them... Decided I'd make a batch tonight, only question is... what about the brwn sugar? It's called for in the ingredient list but isn't added anywhere in directions. I'm assuming you add it with all the rest of ingredients.. at least that's what I'm doing!. Long wait but WELL worth it once there finished. LOVE THESE RIBS!!!

I was sceptical but  I can't begin to describe how wonderful they look, smell and taste. I am taking the pledge to make this my bbq sauce recipe and to never use bottled again. There is no comparison. What a delightful meal. Thanks so much. I covered them and only added the rest of the sauce an hr before its final  cooking time was over. I didn't uncover at all.  Reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon. I don't know how one could make this recipe taste any better. I did use sweet red onions.

Best ribs ever. They were a hit at home. I had no Worcestershire sauce and instead used soya sauce but reduced salt to a pinch. It worked! Thanks Vickydee...

Ribs turn out wonderfully tender, falling off the bone even. It only took about 2-2 1/2 hrs for me so I took them out then and I still couldnt get them to the plate in one piece. Wonderful recipe

This is a very good recipe!  I am all about simplicity so I changed a few things about the preparation.  I used a bottled BBQ sauce instead of making my own.  Rather than browning the ribs, I simply put them under the broiler until brown, then I covered them and let them cook for 2 hours.  During the last hour, I uncovered the ribs and basted them every 15 minutes.  They came out quite tasty without all the fuss of flipping them.  This is definitely a keeper!

Made these last night..delicious! Did not alter sauce..was perfect. Covered ribs with foil and cooked 1 hour, added remainder of sauce, covered again cooked for another hour. Removed foil basted and left uncovered basting every 15 mins for 30 more mins. Finished them on the grill, basted them there too, for 15 mins to get a nice char. Were absolutely perfect!

I made this recipe and it was great!!  I did a cup of  ketchup and a cup of bbq sauce, omitted all of the salt and I didn't miss it!  I didn't even baste like I was suppose to and the ribs were moist and fall off the bone tender!  I will absolutely make this again.

I made these the other night, and they were knee-sinking good! I followed some tips on reviews previously posted... had to dump liquid a couple times. I used red onion which complemented well because of it's sweetness. I was worried about it being too ketchupy through watching it cook over the 3 hours. But when I tried a bite when I was cutting up my daughter's, my knees sank practically to the floor.

I first did a dry rub of garlic powder, pepper, and light "Pappy's". Seared on the BBQ as I much prefer a smokey flavor. Made sauce as directed apart from omitting the salt (due to dry rub) and adding roughly 3 T of grape jelly. Added 1/2 sauce to ribs, covered for 1 hour, flipped, added remaining sauce and covered for another hour. For last hour I basted about every 25 min. Turned out very tender. Will definitely do again

put some bbq sauce instead of ketchup.  good choice.  also, decided to cook 2 and 1/2 hrs then let sit in oven that was off until guests arrived and then reheated at 180 F for 10 minutes.  awesome.

I read several reviews and I took the advice to do half catsup and  half bbq sauce. It smelled good like that but seemed like it was missing something, so I added 1 tsp of minced garlic and 2 tsps of liquid smoke with another 1/2 cup of water. I cooked the whole 3 hrs @ 350 and they were perfect. I also removed the foil about an hour into the cook time. Will definitely have these again.Good recipe, thanks.

This was my first time making ribs, and my husband was not really interested.  They smelled great in the oven, and tasted even better.  We were both really impressed and I will definitely be making this again!!!

I loved this recipe!! I usually forget to rate them after I used them, but I made this tonite and it was so amazing I had to rate it right away! I did vary just a little.  I doubled the recipe because we like alot of sauce but only used two teaspoons salt. I also used 1/2 cup baby rays barbeque sauce (didn't have enough ketchup) and added about 2 teaspoons minced garlic. I know it would have been great as written. My boyfriend loves the ribs at a restaurant over an hour away from us so much that we go there often and he said these were sooo close to tasting like them! Thanks for the post!

I marinated beef ribs in this sauce over night (since we used ribs from a dairy cow which is tougher meat) and they came out superb.  Tasted almost like a long lost recipe of my grandmothers that I love.  I give it 4 stars because its the best home-made recipe I've come across but still doesn't beat the restaurants.

Was easy to make, but took a lot of tending since the meat has to be turned every 20 minutes.  But it's worth the effort.

My husband made these a few days ago and the whole time they were baking my mouth was watering- the smell was amazing!  But when they were done the taste was even more amazing.  We will definately be making these again.

These are so good. And very easy. The meat just falls off the bone and the sauce is perfect as is.

I used 1/2 BBQ sauce and 1/2 ketchup-could have cut out the sugar with this modification they were a bit on the sweet side but otherwise delicious and fell right off the bone. I also boiled them for 20min first and seared them like directed-amazing-and the man LOVED the leftovers again.

If you let it bake long enough, the sauce thickens and the meat just falls off the bone.

Oh my god. If I could give it more stars I would! These were the best ribs I have ever tasted. For some reason though, the shop didn't have mustard powder so I had to use the store's own brand of BBQ sauce powder and they came out perfectly!

These were good, but  a little too salty.  I liked these, but I think I'll keep looking for the "perfect" bbq rib recipe.

EXCELLENT!!! Added 2tsp of red pepper, and covered for first 1 1/2 hour.  Meat did just fall off!!!  Don't know how much pork ribs I had because they came from my parent's farm, but I had a ton of sauce left over.  I can't bring myself to toss it out.  Your recipe has helped me in the mad race with my mother in law for the best recipies!!!

These were really nice.  Like others, I reduced the oven temp...to 300 and wrapped the ribs tightly in foil after basting them with the sauce.  I also first brought the sauce to a boil on the stove and then simmered for about 45 minutes before adding it to the ribs to thicken it up a bit.  I only added 3 tsp. of dry mustard and about half the required worcestershire.  Done this way they come out incredibly tender and yummy!

I made this for 2 so I bought 2 and change pounds of freshly sliced pork spareribs. I made the same amount of sauce as recipe which was way more than enough. Did exactly as recipe called for with turning and basting every 20 minutes 2-21/2 hours is enough. served with mash potatoes and corn. not nutricious but delicious.
