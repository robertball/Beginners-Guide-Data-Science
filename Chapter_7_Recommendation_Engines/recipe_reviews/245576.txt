These are exactly what I was looking for! I was nervous to try a recipe without any reviews, but I went for it with some encouragement from my five year old! 

I was craving a molten lava brownie that a local restaurant has. I'm not a fan of the lava cakes, but this brownie dessert is amazing! So, I looked on here and on Pinterest and found this. 

Super easy to make-I followed the recipe exactly adding the cup of chocolate chips and choosing to omit the pecans. The batter doesn't do the finished product justice. I was a little nervous just tasting that! 

I used 12 regular cupcake pans and they turned out perfect. They crashed in the middle and it was ideal for a scoop of ice cream, although these are so good and rich, I prefer to eat just these! No ice cream needed! 

I used the remainder of the batter and put it in an 8x8 square. Obviously that needs a little more time to cook. 

These are nice and crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside. This recipe is going to be a go-to from now on.

Tastes like a brownie. They are hard to get out of the cupcake tins without them falling. They fall apart easily. Everyone liked them but said they tasted like an uncooked brownie. Soufflés ate soft in the middle so they thought they were undercooked. Follow the directions fully and they come out great. Just that you can’t get them out of the pans without them falling down and apart. I pieced them together and presented them on a plate that was swiped with chocolate sauce and dashed with cinnamon. Garnished with a blueberry and a raspberry. Great presentation but the soufflé looked like a falling apart muffin slash brownie cupcake. If you have a soufflé pan, use that and cook accordingly. The muffin method just is horrible.

They were a little undercooked at 22 minutes, so I cooked them for 30 minutes and they were perfect!! These are so delicious by themselves but I added an Oreo at the bottom of the cupcake liner and it was Delicious! Definitely making these again!

I'm addicted to chocolate (the cravings get especially bad around exam time), and these are my absolute favorite to make when those cravings hit. I know there aren't a lot of review on here now, but I encourage everyone to try it!!
