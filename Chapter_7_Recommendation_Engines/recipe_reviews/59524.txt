Strange dish.  Don't use butter-- sub olive or other oil.  When you mix the buttery cumin and chili pepper in with the cool cuc's the butter turns solid again and resists any sort of even distribution, clumping in an unhelpful way.  My in-laws and man liked this a lot better than I did.  I wouldn't make it again, but they snapped it up, so maybe it's one of those love it or hate it recipes.

Cool and sweet, with a mild chili kick, and the cumin adds the twist that makes this recipe different from the scads of blah cucumber salad recipes out there. I'm definitely adding this one to my repertoire.

This is a wonderful summer salad, and is great with Indian food.  I added very small amounts of red, orange and yellow bell peppers for a little more color.  My husband doesn't like things too hot, so I took the seeds out of the chili before cutting it up and putting it in the salad.

I really cannot praise this highly enough.  An unexpected lovely flavor fest.  Used 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper to sub for the chili pepper, and added it to butter with the cumin.  Left out the sugar by accident, will not add it in the future, as the salad was delightful - guests loved it too!  Thank you for a terrific post!

We really like this salad.  I use olive oil, and have used a variety of nuts.  The longer it sits before you eat it, the spicier it gets!

I used 2 small Japanese cucumbers and 3 tablespoons of chopped almonds when I made this.  It came out a little nut -heavy, and I think next time I'll use 3 J-cukes (about 1.5 large cukes) without increasing the nut amount.

I thought this was awesome!  I am a huge fan of cucumbers and peanuts, so this hit the spot.  The only problem I has was with the chili...I didn't know what kind to buy or what to look for with a chili, so I didn't add it.  It was still really tasty and healthy.

The only adjustment I made to this recipe was to substitute canola oil for the butter.  It turned out delicious!  The crunch of the peanuts is a key contrast, so make sure to sprinkle the peanuts onto each serving just before it's time to eat.  I'll be making this again and again as we head into peak cucumber season!

Fabulous.  Also was leery of the butter, but it was perfect.  My cousin loves both cucumbers and peanuts and went crazy for the flavor.. Great, east, tasty, healthy.  Bravo.

I made this without cooking the pepper or adding the sugar.  It was easy to make.  Also, the flavor is good!  I garnished this with lettuce, not cilantro.  Great recipe!

i forgot to seed the cucumbers, but i think the recipe turned out okay. the flavor combination is unique. my biggest complaint is the butter solidifies and coats the cucumbers, making it look less appetizing.

I was really unhappy with how this turned out. Something is just inherently wrong about melted butter poured over cucumbers.  I couldn't stomach this at all.   Sorry!

I loved this!  I had increased the serving size to 8 so, I cut the butter in half and also cut down the lemon juice to a generous 1/4 cup.  I also didn't have real chile peppers, so I substituted powdered chipolte chili.  Delicious!

I took another reviewers tip and added onion. I think it would have been better without it. The onion kind of overpowered the salad. Otherwise it was good and refreshing.

This was interesting. I was a little leery of putting butter on cucumber, but it was very subtle. I used cashews because I don't like peanuts, and it was a delicous combination. The cumin and chile pepper gave the dish a unique flavor, and the aroma was wonderful. I may try it with olive oil, just because I really prefer not to use butter when I cook.

Don't use butter - I should have listened to the other reviewers.  It congrats in the fridge and makes the salad look unappealing.  It tastes great,however, and I'll definitely make it again, just with olive oil.

I liked the flavour that the peanuts added and my boyfriend like the spice ... but he and I both weren't overly excited about this salad as a whole. Mediocre - wouldn't make it for a family gathering - but it was ok.

This was very unique!  The flavor was fantastic.  At our family dinner, guests either liked it a lot or not at all.  I followed advice of other reviewers and used olive oil.  I will make this again, I'm sure.

Definitely unique, but just not my cup of tea. Thanks anyway.

I followed the recipe although I was skeptical about the  butter getting lumpy and it did. It tasted good but looked terrible. Next time I will used oil.

Made exactly as instructed and this was a refreshing change of pace. I will definitely be making this again.

really good. I did sub olive oil, and I also added some minced red onion. I diced the cucumbers into really small pieces so the whole thing had a salsa-like texture.
