I have to say that this recipe is quick, easy, and great for the heat of the summer.  I made it up as directed and served it on croissants.  It was loved by my quests.  Thanks for the great summer chicken salad.  :)

Very easy recipe, and easy to change to different tastes, I enjoyed it by adding apples and cranberries.  The whole family loves it!

Maybe without the sugar it would have been better. It was too sweet for my taste.

I really liked the taste of the dill with the grapes...it was a wonderful 'summery' taste.  I used cold grilled chicken that I had on hand instead of the canned chicken, which really ramped up the flavor.  I served on crackers and it was the first thing devoured!  Thanks!

Easy and delicious! Lunches are going to be such a treat this week. My chicken was canned in 9.75 oz so I used 3. To compensate, I used 1 cup of mayo instead of 3/4. Turned out perfect -  Thanks Bree!

I love this on crackers.  I didn't have white vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and didn't use the dill.   Excellant spread on crackers!  Would be good in sandwiches too.

I made this recipe for me and my husband,  and it was delicious.    I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.  I plan to make it again very soon.

I wasn't a big fan of chicken salad until I tried this. Very flavorful and very easy!

There's a cafe nearby that makes a very similar version of this and I love it. Glad to find a recipe I can use!

Omitted dill and used a little less sugar.  Delicious!  I also added cashews.
