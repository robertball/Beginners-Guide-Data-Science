It's all in the spice blend.  I used Penzey's Spices tandoori mix with plain greek yogurt & key limes. http://www.penzeys.com/cgi-bin/penzeys/p-penzeyscurrytand.html?id=fyErmhgq  Mix 1-2 TB. with 1 Cup plain yogurt and the juice of ½ lime or lemon. Pour over a cut-up skinless chicken, cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Remove from marinade, bake 45 minutes uncovered at 325°, turning and basting every 15 minutes. If I cook this in my   terra cotta CLAY roaster I bake it at 350 for 1 hour no basting. Moist & delicious!

Love it, love it, love it!!! Just the right amount of flavoring without being over powering.  I followed this recipe exactly although I did use vanilla yogurt. This recipe will certainly be used time and time again.  Thank you for sharing.

I cooked them in a oil-sprayed pan in the oven 335F for about an hr. I pour away the juice every 15mins so the chicken will look nicely baked and dried at the end. They taste good and easy to make. Oh, I marinated them for about 6 hours. Also, I oil spray the chicken surface lightly 10 mins before its out of the oven. Will be making this again for sure!

We were hoping for something a little spicier or more intriguing.  It was good but we were hoping for better.  Bought the Tandoori masala powder from Amazon (I keep a wish list until I get enough for free shipping which helps).  We did discover that plain yogurt in a marinade is just fine and we need not turn up our noses or our palates.  So it was a good learning experience.  Now if we can just find a really interesting use for the Tandoori Masala.

Just got into Indian cooking so I don't expect much of myself.  I made a couple of slight mods: I added a little chili powder and cayenne pepper, not much just a pinch and I finished the dish off with a small side of: 4 tbsps of sambal, chopped scallions, lemon juice and honey Greek yoghurt, just to give it some extra ooomph!

We just finished dinner and I couldn't wait to write our review. This recipe is EXCELLENT. What a change from ol' boring grilled chicken. This will definitely become a grilling favorite!

Good chicken - nice flavor but would have liked it to pack more punch. Will make some of the modifications others suggested next time to kick up the heat. Definitely worth making.

Really enjoyed this.  The only thing missing was the reddish coloring I was expecting but still Delish.  Couple modifications.  I cut up a whole chicken.  Changed our mind about dinner And  marinaded for 48 hrs.  Afraid yogurt sauce might make chicken mushy but all good!  Also added olive oil which just seemed right.   Increased all ingredients to compensate for 5lbs.  
Grilling bird w skin and bone can be a bit tricky. Especially when used to boneless skinless. Need to cook thru with out overcooking skin.  Go med and occasionally cover lid but keep close eye.  Also found useful to lower heat and keep bird on 2nd level to ensure internal cook temp without burning.  Served w grilled zucchini and yellow saffron rice.  Of course nan too
Enjoy!
PS really good following days cold or heated up in tortilla wrap with melted moz cheese lettuce and pesto which I learned on this site !  Almost enjoyed more !
PS regular markets didn't have tandoori powder but Google world or Indian markets which should have

I thought I would try this recipe because it looked nice and easy for a weeknight meal. This was good if you don't want to use too many ingredients/make your own masala blend, and if you don't want spiciness. The flavour is mild and not particularly complex, but still good. I marinated for probably 6 hours, and baked chicken quarters in the oven. Sprinkled chopped cilantro on top.

I think the recipe would be amazing but I did not have the tandoori spice so I used the garmal marsala instead.  I missed the red color that Chef John has on his video!  It as moist and flavorful but I am certain not the same..

The recipe is simple and tasty.  I marinated the chicken over night and then cooked it on my gas grill.  Next time I will add a little salt to the seasoning as my tandoori mix was not salty enough alone.  This may help the chicken from drying out even more when cooked.
Chicken was perfect to add to Tikka Masala sauce that I made.

I've made it 2 times. The first time, the lime was a little too much (may have been my fault) - the second time I did well on the lime and it came out pretty good. Next time will try adjusting seasoning a little bit to find the right mixture. On the whole a great recipe but as with anything, I'm not going to be afraid to make adjustments as needed!
