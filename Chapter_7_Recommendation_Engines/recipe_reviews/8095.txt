Loved this recipe! My neighbor gave me a great tip. Instead of cutting the cakes with a knife, use a piece of regular sewing string and wrap it around the center of the cake, pull it through and viola! You've cut your cake with no crumbs!

Fabulous.  The best black forest cake recipe I've tried, and I've tried a lot.  The cake baked up beautifully, the cherries were perfect, and the whole thing just came together wonderfully.

The only change I made (and I heartily recommend it)is that I made a syrup out of 1/2 cup reserved cherry juice, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup Kirsch (cherry liqueur - added after the juice/sugar simmered for a bit and then cooled).  I drizzled this syrup over the cake sections before I spread the cherries and whipped cream on.  It added moisture and tied everything together.  Yum!

A lovely cake!  It took me 3 hours from start to finish, though I also did a few kitchen chores between steps.  The cake part itself makes a very nice chocolate cake that I will probably use for other cakes.  Mine was not dry, in fact it was very moist in the center.  It had a somewhat crusty top that reminded me very much of brownies.  In response to a previous review,I used 2 cans of tart pie cherries (Oregon brand) that were 14.5 ozs. each.  The can said that the actual wt. of the cherries was 11.5 ozs. each, so it was close to 20 altogether, and to me it seemed the perfect amount.  It seems very involved, and I suppose it is moreso than opening up a mix and a can of frosting, but it just takes more time and the effort is worth it.  With the crumbs on the sides (and I also added a dusting of crumb to the top) it is a very forgiving cake for those who have trouble frosting neatly.  I agree with the reviewer who suggested starting the cherries first.  It took me almost the entire baking time to cook the cherries, and I cooled them in the refrigerator while the cake cooled.  But they were still a little warm when I started to put it all together.  Had my kitchen been warm today, that might have been a problem.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I will definitely be making it again.

Tasty!  I've never seen cans of sour cherries (only available in the USA?) so I used a can of cherry pie filling.  This cake won't dry out before it gets eaten.  Thanks Linda.

This cake is absolutely delicious!  I took the advice of making the cherry filling before making the cake part, and it had plenty time to cool down.  I followed the recipe as is, and was very happy with the results - as was everyone else who ate it!  I would suggest that if possible, try making this cake 1 day before you plan on serving it - there's no comparison on how much better it tastes.  At minimum, try to make it the morning of the day you want to serve it.  Great!!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday at his request. I modified it gently into cupcake format because I have a cupcake fetish. The cake was delicious, the cherry topping and whipped cream spectacular. My only adjustment to the recipe itself was adding an egg - a nod to the cupcakes - but I was very pleasantly surprised by this cake and found it pretty easy to make. For my purposes, I had a lot of leftover cherry topping and whipped cream - I ended up making a parfait with the cupcake tops. This cake does rise pretty well - if you're thinking about going the way of cupcakes, I would make sure to fill the cups barely 1/2 with mix.

I was feeling lazy so I used Duncan Heinz Dark Chocolate Fudge cake, and it was very tasty.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and brushed the layers with the sugar/cherry juice/kirsch mixture.  The cake was already pretty moist, so while that tasted good, it needs to be used sparingly on a cake mix cake.  I also stabilized the whipped cream by adding unflavored gelatin (directions below) since I was taking it to a party and I needed the whipped cream to hold up and not get droopy.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I will reduce the sugar a little and use the dark sweet cherries instead to see if I like that better!  (To stabilize 2 cups of whipping cream, dissolve 1 tsp. unflavored gelatin in 2 Tbsp. cold water and let sit 5 minutes.  Heat over simmering water just until gelatin dissolves; cool slightly.  In bowl whip cream and confectioner's sugar just to soft peaks.  Add dissolved gelatin and whip just a little more until stiffer peaks form.  This will help the whipped cream hold its shape for a day or two, and it doesn't make it rubbery.)

Good one. I used the fourth layer too to give cake a taller look. I also used cocktail cherries only and no sugar syrup. Decorated with shaved chocolate on whipped cream looked gourmet.

This cake is wonderful!! I wondered about the batter as it was quite thick but it came out great. It didn't take as long to bake as the directions said. 
I did use canned cherry filling instead of the homemade and in place of the whipped cream I used the recipe for French buttercream Frosting. Everyone loved it.

This was an excellent cake and went over so well that I had demands for several more.  I made two for a large party and they were both gone in about 15 minutes.

The only thing I would add would be a thin layer of chocolate syrup between the layers.

It was OK as a substitute recipe since I could not find my Oma's recipe, it baked up easy. But its not a "Original" there is no vanilla extract in a Black Forest Cake its suppose to be Kirschwasser (cherry liquor) two completely different things and key item in what makes part of the taste in this cake.  Also using canned cherry pie filling as I seen in some of the reviews is not a good sub. You just want the cherries for this recipe. If you can't find pitted black cherries go with frozen cherries thawed out of course. Also oil is never used for this its generally shortening or if all fails real butter not Margarine.   Like I said its a pretty good sub but by no means an Original and I say that because I am German and its mostly what I cook even after 20 years living in the states now.

I have made this cake several times simply b/c it is soooo good!  I brought it with for a family holiday dinner, not only did everyone love it but the presentation is beautiful.  Instead of pressing crumbs into the icing on the side, I used dark chocolate shavings.  MUCH better this way hands down.

This cake was absolutely delicious when all was said and done, but the process involved was a bit long.  I would let people know to pop the cake back in the refrigerator before serving or traveling because the fresh whipped cream likes to slide.

I made this cake for a birthday. I liked that it didn't use canned pie filling or a boxed cake mix. The cake actually has a nice chocolaty taste. The cherries at the store only come in 14.5 oz cans so I went with that size. When I was bringing them to a boil they appeared to have a dark peach/pink color but not red. So, I added a few drops of red food coloring and it worked perfect. I was worried about the whipped cream not holding up the next day on the piped part, so I made a recipe of stablized whipped cream from this site for the piping part. I do suggest using a smaller tip for the bottom piping, then the top, although the recipe does not mention that. The cake may be transported so I used a round cardboard to decorate the cake on, on a cake stand. I thought the final cake looked very attractive. I hope everyone enjoys it tommorrow! Thank you submitter.

My husband and I love this recipe. The first time I made this cake I used fresh cherries and made my own filling. It was out of this world. The next time I made this cake I used the canned cherries and it was still wonderful. Although the second time I used Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate shavings on the side rather than the cake crumbs. And so pretty.

I made the cake exactly as it said in the recipe and it turned out beautifully! Chocolate cake was delicious. I bought sour pitted cherries from a European food market, and I will NEVER buy canned cherry pie filling again! I put the 4th layer aside to dry for a bit then crumbed it in the food processor. I made the cake the day before with a crumb coat of whipped cream and set it in the fridge overnight. On serving day I finished up the sides, and decorated the top.

I enjoyed this cake but found it a bit dry the first time I made it.  The next time around I used dark chocolate cocoa powder and a cup of sour cream...that made it a 5 star cake!!

My mother made this for Christmas and it was delicious.  My mother-in-law who is German was very impressed.  She made two alterations to the recipe.  She brushed each layer of cake with Kirsch.  Also, instead of crumbling one layer, she grated semi-sweet chocolate and patted that on the sides of the cake.  The result was a moist and chocolaty 4-layer cake. This recipe is a keeper.

I think this is a great cake.  My family loved it.  It was a bit dry - even though I only baked it 30 minutes - but the juiciness of the cherry filling balances out the dryness pretty well.  Would like to try making it the day before next time, as others commented that it's more moist after sitting overnight.  I did sprinkle a cherry juice/kirsch/sugar syrup on the cakes but I guess I should have used more...

Made the cake for New Years.  As other's have stated, the cake is dry, even though only baking 30 minutes.  There are other chocolate cake recipes that are better.  What saved this was the real whipped cream and cherries!  Bought two 24 oz bags of frozen tart cherries and made those.  Outstanding.  Caution:  if you whip the cream too long you will end up with butter!!!  Don't repeat my mistake or you too will end up buying 3 more cups of whipping cream!

DELICIOUS!! It is perfect as is! Like any cake, it is more moist after it has sat covered for a day or two before it is eaten. This one of course has to go in the fridge because of the whipped topping!

A perfect cake!!  I made this for my Dad's 60th Birthday.  Tripled the original recipe to make a 4 layer 11 inch round cake.  This was served to 50 people and there was barely a scrap left in the room.  Rave reviews from all who tried it, even some people who don't usually like fresh cream.  One minor alteration that I made was to add some lemon juice to the cherry mix (about the juice of 1 lemon to a triple mix).  This made the cherry mix a little more tart on the palate to cut through the sweetness of the rich chocolate cake.  Will be making this one again.  I also chose to make the cake 4 layers rather than crumbling one of the layers for the side of the cake.  I used crumbled chocolate (Cadbury Flake) to coat the side of the cake instead.

Impressive! I made this cake for my hubby's birthday, and we shared it with friends.  A hit all around.  Nice looking, yummy and festive enough for an out-of-the-ordinary birthday cake.
A bit more time required than those "cake mix" recipes, but in my book it gets extra credit for that - I appreciate "from scratch" baking and those who still do it!
Thanks Linda!

Very good! I made the cherry filling a day ahead to give it plenty of time to cool (so it wouldn't drip). I also reserved an extra 1/2 C. of cherry juice and added 2 Tbl. white sugar and a splash of amaretto to a saucepan and let it cook while the cake was baking; after the cake had baked and cooled for about 15 minutes, I split the cakes and brushed the cut sides with the cherry juice reduction. To the whipped cream, I used both vanilla and almond flavoring. Very delicious and elegant; this makes a very impressive-looking cake!

This cake was so soft and moist! The whip cream was not overly sweet and did not take away from the chocolate of the cake itself.  I did have a problem with the cake not staying together but I'm sure it was my fault!!!!
I will definately make this again!!!!

I made this cake today for my family and everyone loved it. Home made is always best! I made the cakes last night, and made the cherry glaze and whipped cream this morning. The chocolate cake alone is quite dense, but very good! Overall, this cake is quite easy to make, and I would definitely make it again!

This was awesome! I used boxed fudge cake mix and fudge frosting (to wall in the filling, and frost the entire cake). The canned cherries for the filling while tasted good, were absolutely not pretty enough for the top, so I cooked another small batch with frozen cherries with a drop of red coloring which looked beautiful. The whipped cream was amazing, and kirsch syrup in the layers a must. I sprinkled the whipped cream stars on top with chocolate sprinkles, this presented beautifully and got rave reviews =)

I made this cake for my uncles birthday b/c it's his favorite.  Everyone loved it, but the hubby and I thought that the cake was to dry, but with the cherrys and whipping cream it was good.  Next year I will use a different chocolate cake recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I have made this cake twice and it is wonderful!  My only mistake is that the cherry topping should be as cold as the whipping cream, otherwise it runs down the sides and this is such a pretty cake.  Thankyou!

This did not turn out well for me. Too bad this was made for my daughter's birthday at her request. The cake was bland...but the whipped cream tasted good.  Another good thing was the suggestion in the reviews to make a syrup from the cherry juice and cherry liquor.  I'll probably use a different chocolate cake recipe and follow the instructions simply for assembly.  Thanks for sharing.

The first time I have ever made this kind of cake.  My girlfriend told me this was her favorite so I made it for her birthday. I used 3 cans (14 ounces each) of tart cherries-drained. It looked good and tasted great!~!

I made this cake for christmas Dinner . It was very good ,using all 4 layers  instead of braking one up .This makes a huge cake so have lots of hungry cake lovers .I added a few extra touches to the cherries after it was cooked into the filling (cherry liquor) and brushed the cakes with a combination of cherry juice, small amount of sugar and cherry liquor.

Good recipe. The cake was dry though. I changed it up quite a bit. I used cherry pie filling instead of the sour cherries with sugar and cornstarch. I used dream whip to pipe along the top, but I decided to make a chocolate icing to go on the sides and between the layers. I also added ground almonds to the top instead of using the crumbs.

BEST CAKE EVER! I made this for my sisters baby shower. I followed the directions exactly and it came out great! several people have asked me to share the recipe since then.  I did use the tip about cutting the cakein two with a piece of thread instead of cuttign with a knife and it worked out perfectly!

An excellent cake that is simple to make. As suggested by previous reviews, I used cherry pie filling. I also used 1/2 cup butter instead of oil. I mixed the butter and sugar first, added the dry ingredients and then the rest of the ingredients. The cake is very filling and some was still left over for the next day. The day old cake was better than that of the previous day because some of the moisture from the cherry pie filling and the whipping cream went into the cake. I'll definitely make this cake again - everyone loved it!

I haven't been able to find sour cherries ( in Canada) and so haven't tried this yet.  I am hoping that the sour cherries will be a fresher alternative to cherry pie filling used in other recipes.

I made this cake today for christmas eve dinner tomorrow and stuck it in the refrigerator.  When I checked on it later, it had fallen apart, cherries and cream all over the refrigerator.  Don't know what I did wrong, I even used gelatin in the whipped cream to firm it up.  The cake looks delicious in the pictures, sorry but I won't be trying this one again, too much effort.  I don't have the skill to make a cake this nice.

Fabulous and showy - always impresses.  The first time I made this, I couldn't find sour cherries and used pie filling - was very good.  Second time, I used some frozen sour cherries, and they made all of the difference.  Perfect!

I am really not a fan of cake mixes--too light and insubstantial.  This cake was wonderfully rich and just dense enough.  The whole recipe was delicious.

this review is for the chocolate cake layers only, as I did something different with the cherries and whipped cream. I thought that they turned out a little dry - and I only baked them for 20 minutes.

I'm not a Baker, but made this recipe because I love Schwarzwaelder Kirsch Torte, as a child living a Germany at the time, my Mom made it for me on my birthday and I absolutely loved it. This recipe did not disappoint. The Cake itself moist the filling fantastic. And it was actually even better on the second day.

Best recipe!! My husband has been telling me for 15 years that Blackforest is his favorite kind of cake, but I had never found one he actually liked - even the fancy bakery versions disspointed him.  This recipe was not necessarily difficult, a bit time consuming. I made a syrup with additional reserved cherry liquid - did not have kirch on hand- and basted the layers of cake with.  The resluts were absolutely amazing - everyone loved the cake - even my hubby, the "Blackforest Connoisseur". Even better on the second day - if there's any left over!

The cake was a little dry, but perhaps I over-baked it. Also, while I made the cake the day before, I should have made the whipped cream topping just before serving it. It cracked a little and turned yellow in some places.

The cherrys are amazing!  I loved them.  I had to add a little more sugar to the whipped cream, just do to personal preference.  The cake however, was terrible.  I only baked it 25 minutes at 350 and it was so dry.  I usually add sour cream to any cake I bake but not this time.  Big mistake!  A boxed cake would have been better than this one...and I may actually use that in place next time.

This is a fabulous cake recipe. Great texture and flavor. I baked mine in a heart-shape pan with butter cream icing and cherries between layers. frosted the outside with dark choc. icing and topped with cherries nestled in a piped heart shape on top. I will make it again for sure.

This was a great recipe for a Black Forest cake! It had just the right amount of sweetness in the cake and the fresh cream frosting just put it into a whole other world. I took the cherry juice and drizzled it on each layer of cake pre-frosting and it was perfect. I will make this again for sure.

Great cake. Remember to make the cake a day prior. It taste so much better. Cake was delicious but I like fluffier cakes. I covered it in ganache for an extra kick.

Made it w/o electricity at our cabin in AK. Had to laugh at "with your electric mixer on high"! Used an old fashioned hand crank mixer to make the frosting. Turned out absolutely delicious and was a great surprise for our guest's 27th birthday. He said his mom always made him Black Forest Cake when he was growing up.  It was my first time baking this cake, so I had no idea what was involved when I started out. Can be done in the boonies with a little extra effort, but I may save this recipe for the comforts of my kitchen in town.  FYI, we have a propane stove and oven at the cabin. Yummm!

Overall this was a very good cake. I found that cake was a little dry and not as spongy as I like it. Also it wasn't as chocolaty as some other recipes. It may have been because I used a different kind of baking chocolate.   The Cherry topping and Frosting were delicious. It really brought everything together. I added some red food coloring to the cherries so they were a little more flashy. I also definitely recommend waiting until the cherries are cooled until you put them on the cake. I put mine on when they were still a little warm and they dripped off the cake.   Overall, this is a delicious cake. I will make it again but I think I will add some fudge or chocolate in the middle as well.

This is a delicious chocolate cake to begin with so with the toppings it is excellent!  I was in a hurry last night and didn't want to go to the trouble to make a layer cake, so just dumped the cake in a 9x12 greesed and floured pan. We had no cherries, but had some rasberries.  I made the topping with them and added a little cool whip.  It was still delicious.  This is not to take anything away from the original, however, just wanted to try the cake in a 9x12 pan for speed.  This cake stands on its own in any shape and with any topping!

I've made this recipe a few times and every time it comes out fantastically. Sour pitted cherries are hard to find, at least I thought, so I use 1.5 cans of Cherry Pie Filling (spend extra money to get a good quality brand as it really affects the flavor and quality of finished product!). This cake is fantastic every time; looks impressive and everyone loves it! I tried taking the two cake layers and making a 4 tier (2nd time around) but I found it sort of leaned to one side (too heavy), so try to stick with the 3 tier and using the extra piece as crumbles for the outside, makes ALL the difference. I also suggest making this cake at least a day in advance; for people who said it was too dry, putting it in the fridge and letting everything come together really makes the cake moist (it also travels better!). The cherry filling seeps into the cake and its just delicious! It's also a time consuming cake to make, so doing it in advance is easier :)

This was, by far, the best cake I have ever made. It may have been the best cake I have ever eaten. I made this for Christmas because I wanted something very special. People couldn't get enough and were even taking slices home! I made it exactly as the recipe reads and it was perfect.

This recipe makes an AMAZING cake! I made it for my dad's birthday a night ahead of time and stored it in the fridge overnight; it held up great. I followed the recipe exactly and it made a delicious, moist cake with just the right amount of tart cherry flavor and sweet whipped cream frosting. Everyone raved about the presentation and taste. Would definitely make this again!

I agree with other users about the whipped cream.  I refrigerated the cake after I assembled it, and it did hold up pretty well, but next time I will try adjustments.  I couldn't get canned cherries, so I used frozen ones and they came out perfect.  Also, I used dark chocolate cocoa powder which gave the cake a nice rich flavor.  It was my husband's birthday cake, and he has already asked that I make it again!

This is my husband's favorite cake. He requests it for his birthday every year, and sometimes on Father's Day too.  It's become a family tradition. I throw in a little packet of vanilla sugar when making the whipped cream filling, but other than that, I really don't change a thing.  At my store the cherries come in 24 oz jars, so I just dump it all into the saucepan and rarely increase the sugar - we don't like very sweet desserts anyway.  And I usually end up whipping up the entire quart of cream - if I have any left over I just enjoy it in my coffee for a few decadent days.It is a bit messy getting the crumbs up onto the side of the cake...but it's worth it! Oh, and don't substitute cherry pie filling for the sour cherries, it's not the same at all.  .  German friends have told me I should poke holes in the cake and pour kirsch (cherry liqueur) over the layers, but no thanks - we love this recipe just the way it is.

My friend and his daughter both compared this cake to one they bought at a german bakery and liked this one better, even with substituting 1/2 splenda for the cake batter (he's diabetic).  Great recipe - Thanks!

The cake was a huge hit, even though mine didn't turn out very pretty (but that's pretty typical for ME).  Also -- when it says to let the cherries cool, it really means to let the cherries COMPLETELY cool.  (red faced!)  Stick 'em in the fridge and come back to 'em later.

This cake was easy to make, but time consuming. The Cake was moist, and easy to remove from the pans, and the icing is perfect. The only thing I did differently was use canned cherry filling. The end result was a beautiful and impressive cake.

I made this for dessert for some guests tonight - it is really yummy and presentation is FABULOUS. I am all about shortcuts, so I used canned cherry pie filling instead of making my filling w/ cherries, sugar & corn starch. Also, I wasn't sure about the crumb thing on the side, so I just made mine 4 layers high, frosted it all w/ whipped cream frosting, and decorated w/ a few leftover cherries on top. Colors are great for Christmas. Also goes really well w/ a nice port.

I made this cake for my Mom for her birthday, as it is her favorite.
for the Cherries, i got 2 jars of sour cherries and started them long before i started the cake,I also used shaved chocolate on the sides the cake did cook faster than the recommended 35 min, while it does take hours to make this cake(while mutitasking) this is one of the best cakes i have ever eaten in my life, even my step father who is not a big cake fan had FOUR pieces.
They are coming over again this weekend and want me to make this cake again but i think i might try raspberries for the topping... thank you so much for this recipe :)

I found this cake to be very moist and wonderful! Had just a bit of trouble with the cherries but raising the heat helped. My husband doesn't like chocolate cake and adored this one! WILL SO MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN!

Pretty sure this was the one I made the first time, better than Black Forest cake II. I just added the kirsch as arcticwoman suggested and used Choc curls instead of crumbs.

I have only made the cherry part, but it was GREAT!!! I used Dark Morello Cherries from Trader Joe's. You can top cheese cake with them, cupcakes, pancakes, tarts . .  ANYTHING! I loved them.

This was a very good recipe, but I would recommend skipping the 1/8 cup for flour and use only 2 cups if using all purpose flour.  I got rave reviews when I make this recipe for cupcakes.

I made this cake for my son's birthday. It did take a few hours to put together but everyone loved it!
The cake looked beautiful. Here are my thoughts after making it:
1. Start cooking the cherries first. They will take a good 30-40 minutes to thicken and then you need to cool them. I did this in the fridge for another 30 minutes.
2. Bottom of the cake was a bit overcooked. I baked the cakes for 36 minutes. Next time, I will pull them out 32 minutes.
3. Whipped topping was not quite sweet enough for my taste. Next time, I will add just a tad bit more confectioners sugar.
4. I liked the crumbled cake on the sides of the cake. But, next time, I will use shaved chocolate with a vegetable peeler. 
5. Do put your cake together several hours before you need to serve it and refrigerate it. I finished with mine around 11am and served it at 7:30pm.

This cake was excellent! When I read the instructions I was nervous that the layers would be messy and wouldn't look good, but I followed the advice of others and made this in advance and everything turned out beautifully. I baked the cake and cooked the cherries Friday morning and set them in the refrigerator to chill. I whipped the cream and assembled the cake Saturday morning, then let it chill all day until my dinner Saturday night. Everybody loved it! I used one 16 oz bag of frozen cherries because I didn't find canned tart cherries, and i used all 4 layers of cake and put sliced almonds on the outside of the cake to decorate- I would definitely recommend this as it gave the cake a nice crunch and was very fancy looking.

I love this recipe. I am not a baker at all, but when my boyfriend's birthday came up i decided that I'd try this. He is from Nepal and he hasn't had a black forest cake for over 4 yrs. We can't get these where we live either. Although it doesn't taste the same as one from Nepal, it was delicious!!

I didn't even bother to make the full cake with this. The layers came out of my cake pans and I tried the trimmings to see how it tasted and it was an unfortunately mediocre cake. No real moistness, no delicious rich chocolate flavour, just a generic blah chocolate cake.

Amazing!  Perfect way to use some of the tart cherries I picked earlier this summer.  Making your own filling and using real whipped cream made this cake really outstanding.

Excellent basic chocolate cake!  We are lucky enough to have our own sour cherry tree, so I used my own cherries to make a cherry topping/filling as well as our own kirsch to add to the cake while it was cooling!  Excellent recipe!

This recipe turned out great! I did make a couple modifications that added to the chocolate flavor of the cake. I dissolved a Tbsp of instant coffee in a Tbsp of hot water and I added that to the milk. I also added two grated squares of bakers semi-sweet chocolate to the mix. The chocolate flavour of the cake was nice and rich.
I decorated the cake with cherries, grated chocolate, hand piped chocolate leaves, and whip cream that was stabilized with gelatin. I did end up using canned cherry pie fill as I could not find sour cheries.
Overall, a great recipe!

Very yummy cake, I actually used chocolate milk instead of white milk.  Didn't seem to make a difference.  Everyone enjoyed the cake.  I didn't use the pitted sour cherries.  I just used the canned cherry filling and that worked out perfectly.  The taste was perfect.  I just over baked the cake.  Definitely using this recipe again, everyone enjoyed it and loved the presentation.

Really love this recipe. Couldn't find the cherries called for in the recipe so i used cherry pie filling, and it was great. I added almond extract to the icing and the cherries and it was yummy. My husband wants this cake for his birthday every year from now on!:)

My baking is jinxed, and i am horrible with cakes. I have a tough time trying to get the out of box cakes to come out well. Having said that, I had a lovely time trying this one out. I followed the recipe to the book, and the cake baked perfectly! I couldn't find the 'sour' cherries, and the kirsch liquor, i instead used the regular canned cherries (one sweet and one tart to balance out any mistakes) and simply used the syrup from the can to moisten the cake. I also did a choclate ising for the top and sides of the cake and it was perrrfect. While cutting and assembling the layers, the top layer of one of the cakes broke off, so i simply put it together in another dish and poured all the leftover can syrup and some cherries, and that was very good too. Me and my husband ate it for a week after  :)  I recieived a lot of compliments for the black fores cake and this was my very first cake made from scratch.

Myself, along with the wonderful 5 year old I babysit, like to make goodies on Thursday afternoons while her 2 year old sister and my 1 year old daughter take their naps. She wanted "chocolate cake with cherries" this week, so I found this recipe.  To save time, I made the cake and cherry filling last night, and today she helped me make the whipped topping-and gave her input on how to decorate it (looks pretty good, if I do say so myself).  The only issue I had was, like other reviewers mentioned, the cake seemed dry. I made a simple syrup and brushed some onto the three layers (not the crumble layer, as it wouldn't crumble). We are waiting for my 7 year old daughter, and her 7 year old brother to get out of school before we "dig in". Hope it tastes as good as it looks!

I haven't even tried a piece of this cake yet- but it looks delicious!! just waiting until after dinner. I would also agree with the other viewers to start the cherries first as they do take a long time to cool and need to be really cold in order to work right... ( they will drip) I learned the hard way. Great recipe!

Not a bad recipe.  The cake is a little dry and I even took it out earlier than recommend.  btw - where in the ingredients do you mention frosting ?  That was a surprise to me, while making it.  Yep, should have read through it but still, not listed in the ingredients.

This is a great recipe! I didn't change a thing except to add half a cup of rum into the cake mix, making it extra moist

I love this cake!  I wanted to make a special cake for my father-in-law's 70th birthday, and didn't like the black forest cake recipe that I had.  I found this cake and decided to try it, based on all the rave reviews it had.  I was thrilled that it turned out as well as it did.  It was time consuming, but well worth the extra effort.  My in-laws were thrilled (they both love black forest cake) and my mother -in-law said it was the best cake she'd ever tasted.  I couldn't find sour cherries, and I don't like cherry pie filling, so I decided to use fresh cherries.  The filling turned out perfectly, and I plan to do the same thing next time I make the cake.  I know that I'll be getting requests for it time and time again. If anyone is looking for a great special occasion cake, this is definitely the one to make.

I didn't care for the texture of the cake at all. Too coarse. Next time I'm going to use my tried & true chocolate cake recipe.

Lovely cake! I made it for my sister's birthday! I used tinned black cherries instead of the sour ones coz that's what my sister prefers. I had a bit of difficulty with the whipped cream frosting but I think that was to do with the whipping cream quality! Thanks for the recipe! :) ******* UPDATE AUG 2015 :: I made this again, and it was devoured in no time. I made a few changes to suit my preference. I cut back the sugar in the cake to 1/2 cup. I also made the cake in advance (about 2 days) before I wanted to serve this. The following day, I made the cherry topping (using 2 cans of pitted black cherries in light sugar syrup), along with the whipped cream frosting. I stabilised the whipped cream by dissolving 1 tsp unflavoured gelatin in 2 tbsps of cold water, and then very gently heating the mixture to dissolve the gelatin (heating for barely 10 seconds). I added the gelatin liquid into the frosting when the whipped cream and icing sugar combo had formed soft peaks. After adding the gelatin to it, I then whipped it up till it formed stiff peaks. I also ensure to keep the whipped cream in the fridge for awhile, and between layers to prevent it from liquidising. I must also add, it helps to stick the cake in the fridge between layers, to allow the frosting to set. I covered the sides of the cake with grated chocolate and not crumbled cake. Perfect cake, perfect recipe. I'm changing my review to 5 stars! Thanks again Linda! :D

I made this for a birthday celebration for my son and his girlfriend. It came out fabulous. I took another reviewer's suggestion about the stabilized whipped cream and it held its shape nicely. I didn't used the cake crumbs for the side (made 4 layers), but instead used bittersweet chocolate shavings. It worked out very nicely. I also put a 1/4 cup kirschwasser in the cherry mixture after it had cooled a bit. This tasted very authentic to us and was a big hit.

I've been learning how to bake so even as a newbie I was able to put this bad boy together with success! Don't get me wrong, it wasn't easy but I had so much fun doing it and the cake was absolutely delicious. I made it for a co-worker's birthday upon request and everyone at work went ga-ga for it. The only change I would make is the cooking time and it may just be because my oven is wonky but 35 minutes was just a bit too long. Since I'm new to baking, I had a hard time telling if a chocolate cake was done/burnt/or just right. It didn't burn but was a bit dry so next time I think I'll only leave it for 30 minutes and see if that helps. Thanks for such a great recipe and clear directions!

Holy crow! No kidding, honest to goodness, tastes like bakery quality cake!  It definitely is very time consuming and a bit tricky at times (patting the crumbs to the side of the cake) but worth the work and the time!  I used canned cherry pie filling and it was out of this world.  Also, the whipped topping/icing is a bit difficult to work with so beware of that, but the flavor was unbelievable! I will make this again for sure, as long as time affords me to ;-)

This recipe was fabulous and turned out perfect on the first go. My family loved it. I usually buy black forest cake because my husband loves it for his birthday but this year decided to try and make our own after reading this recipe. It was so easy and so tasty, would highly recommend it. Thank you

could not get the cherrys to thicken - at all!  I added more cornstarch and that did nothing. Frustrating! Just took the cake out of the oven...total flop!

I used a mix of sour and bing cherries from a can and it was great. I don't recommend using pie filling, it'd be too sweet. The cake was devoured in minutes, so def try this.

This was by far the easiest cake to make for me. However I did things differently. I followed the recipe for the cake. I bought a can of cherry pie filling (tart ones), and when I made the whipped cream I added 1/4C cocoa powder and 1/4C + 1/8C of powdered sugar. I put one cake on the stand after they had cooled, put a layer of the whipped cream, and a layer of cherries. Then I frosted the cake with the remaining whipped cream, and spread the remaining cherries on top. I then sprinkled cocoa powder and powdered sugar over the top (I didn't have the chocolate to make curls with).

This cake was really really good, and everyone that ate it thought so too!  I did make a few adjustments to it though:  only baked it for 30 minutes and it came out nice and moist; I used 3/4 cup of cherry juice and found it still wasn't enough, I'll probably reserve 1 1/4 cup and add some more cherries for next time (I like alot of cherry flavour); I added a couple tablespoons of kirsch to the cherry mixture and will probably add 3 or 4 next time (for some added punch).
I will definetely use this recipe again.

This recipe was just OK for me. I made the homemade sauce, but it turned out to still be too thin and when I put it on the cake it ran down the sides and was pretty messy. Other than that, the recipe for the acutal cake itself, was great. In fact this was the first homemade cake I made where it didn't crack after I took it out of the oven. I will definately keep the cake recipe and only used canned cherry filling mix if I make this again.

Terribly dry cake. I had to cut off the bottom, sides and even some of the top to find some moistness(not kidding).  I'm wondering if it should be baked in 3 layers instead of 2, thus cutting the cooking time and hopefully making it moister?

Delicious! But remember to do step 4 first if you are in a hurry (the cherries takes time to cool). I am not sure if the recipe meant two 20 ounce cherries (ie 40 ounces) or total of 20 ounces - could someone help clarify?

Awesome!  A little labor intensive , but overall not too bad.  I made the cakes and froze them a few days ahead of time which was hugely helpful.  On the day that I assembled the cake, I make the cherry filling early in the day so it had plenty of time to cool before I actually needed it.  Although I was a little worried about how easily the whipped cream would  pipe, it held up great.  I made it for a birthday party and I will definitely make it again!

I made a gluten free version of this amazing recipe. I used Cup 4 Cup gluten free flour and subbed equal amount of flour. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I took others advice and stabilized the whipped cream with 1 teaspoon of gelatin to 2 tablespoons of water for 2 cups of whipped cream. I also used all 4 layers of the cake and covered the side of the cake with shaved dark chocolate. I built the layers with cherries and whipped cream and did a light coating over the entire cake. The next day (day of serving) I made another batch of stabilized whipped cream (2cups of whipping cream) and iced the sides, added the shaved chocolate to the side and piped around top and bottom of cake and added the remaining cherries to the top of the cake. Finished with shaved chocolate on the top of cherries because I had extra. The recipe was a lot of work but worth it for our Christmas dessert. The cherry recipe ended up tasting like cherry pie filling which would save time and money so I may consider doing this the next time.

If you want a less dense cake separate your eggs.  Put yolks in with the milk and whip the whites. Fold whites into the mixed batter. Also, I mixed 1 tbsp vinegar into my milk.


Excellent recipe on the whole.  I went by exact directions the first time and had raving reviews. Made it the second time as a request, but wanted to address some comments on here about the batter to thick and dense cake.
Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

Added a teaspoon of instant coffee into the batter.

Made own cherry compote instead of store-bought canned cherries.

BAD RECIPE!  I followed the recipe to the letter and this cake is NOT GOOD.  The cherry filling tastes a bit pasty like you can taste the corn starch, not very flavorful. The chocolate cake was dense, a bit rigid & dry, and has a dull flavor. The whipped cream dripped and partially melted off the cake as soon as I frosted it.

I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday last night.  I followed the instructions on decorating from the video.  This was superb and everyone was totally impressed!  Only made a few changes.  Didn't have two 9" round pans so I used three 8" round pans instead and because the cakes were thinner as a result,  I only took a little bit off each to get the necessary crumbs for decorating the sides.  In the batter, I used 1/2 cup coffee and 1/2 cup of milk instead of only milk because I had coffee left from the morning.  One other change I'd make next time is thicken the cherry juice with the cornstarch before putting in the drained cherries so they would not break up as I stirred and thickened the mixture.  Tasted just great but would have looked better.  Definitely a make again recipe.

I made this as 2 B'day cakes for 2 different parties and everyone liked them a lot. I made 4 layers and I made 4 small cupcakes for each cake and used the 4 layers to stack and the cupcakes to decorate the sides. Since the cherry pie filling was tart, I took a part of it and added a tablespoon of sugar and 1/4 cup of water and drizzled on the cake halves before assembling. The cake was moist and had a wonderful flavor. Thanks for the recipe Linda. You made me a hero!

I followed the advice of arcticwoman and made a syrup out of 1/2 cup reserved cherry juice, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup Kirsch (cherry liqueur - added after the juice/sugar simmered for a bit and then cooled). I wasn't sure if I was to omit the cornstarch or not, but I did omit it and it seemed a little thin, but turned out fine.
I also used the Oregon brand can of tart cherries, two cans (14.5oz each) and I actually had left over cherries.
I also only had the cake in the oven for 20 minutes when I took it out and it was perfect. I used convection bake, at 350.
To separate the layers, I used my Wilton cake wire thingy and it worked okay, but next time, I'll probably try using a thread instead.

I made this cake for the Fourth of July, and everyone loved it! Great recipe, a "must make again" cake! I made some adjustments, including using cool whip instead of making my own whipped cream, and pie filling for the cherries. This was just what I had in my kitchen at the time, and it still turned out beautifully. I am making this cake again for my mother's birthday because she loved it so much!!! thanks for sharing it!

The cake was dry, even when I did as suggested and allow the cherries and whipping cream to soak in for several hours.

Made as is, except that I used canned cherry pie filling instead of making it myself... and it was amazing.  I layered my cake the night before and the cake held up well.  I had no problems cutting the cake with a bread knife to make the layers, just make sure the cake is cooled.  It was delicious and dense and I would definitely make this cake again!

I made this for my boyfriend's parents for Christmas, and they thoroughly enjoyed it. I did at more chocolate and just a little bit more oil to make the cake richer. I feel that it could have been better than it turned out, but perhaps that can be accounted to my novice baking skills. It's appearance is impressive, and it's also tasty.

First off, I thought the cake recipe called for way too much sugar!  I put in half (1 cup) of sugar and the cake was still delicious.  Also, instead of making the cherry filling, I used 1 can of cherry pie filling.  It was just enough for the top and the middle of the cake.  I also used 2 8" cake pans instead of the 9" and the cake was perfect.  I also would cut the heavy whipping cream and confectioner's sugar in half especially if you were to make the 8" verses the 9" cake.  I had a lot of whipped cream left over even going around the cake twice on the bottom and around the top.  I would definitely make it again!

This was fantastic! The only change I made for time and effort savings, was to used canned cherry pie filling instead of making the filling myself. It was a huge success and I used the video to make this to watch and pause at each step so I did it right. I highly reccomend this recipe, using the video along with it, you can't go wrong! Here's a link to the video: http://allrecipes.com/weblink/63382148/video-black-forest-cake-i---allrecipescom/detail.aspx

The only thing I did was use the crumble layer as a forth layer just for extra height and put chocolate on the side.  Either way it is a Great Cake!!!! I just started to get into baking and I really enjoyed this!!!!

This is not a traditional German schwarzwaltenkirschtorte...or black forrest cherry cake...I was disappointed in the turn out because I found a German recipe finally and it should be rum soaked dark cherries.

EXCELLENT!!! Made for my husbands birthday.  I did make a syrup of kirsch and the juice from the cherries (boil down) to brush on the layers.  I will use chocolate shavings on the side next time instead of crumbs and also "sprinkle" the finished cake with them for a professional look. Very good cake!

Everything came out fine, tasted alright. The cherry topping and the whipped topping where good. The only problem was cake itself. It was very dry. I even took one pan out before it was done, to prevent that. Also I think the cherry topping needs to sit for a very long time, or maybe some flour needs to be added to it, because it didn't thicken properly, so it would slide off the top!

A couple classmates and I made this cake for class the day we presented our project on Germany. Everyone loved it!

My favorite part about making this cake was keeping the crumbs that came off when cutting the cake in half; and a little of the cherry and whipped cream. It was nice to have a taste of cake without having to cut into it!

My boyfriend and I started to make the cake.  We followed all the directions only to have it implode when we tried to put the whipped cream on top of the cake.  Everything became a large, crumbly mess.  It did not look like the picture whatsoever.

Somehow the flavor wasn't as good as store-bought which seemed strange since in my experience home-made is always better.  Still delicious though.

This was a good recipe, although I would look to find a lighter cake.  The cake was very dense.  I put a bit of geletin mixed with water to help stabalize the whipping cream.  The cherries were delicious will definitely use that part of the recipe again, but need to find a lighter chocolate cake recipe to combine with this recipe!  Thanks a ton, Karm

This cake is so moist and good.  It's easy to make just a little messy when it comes to putting the crumbs on the side of the cake.  More for you if you like to eat cake.  Plus my daughter keeps on requesting this cake year after year for her birthday.  Do try it, you won't be sorry.

The recipe was really good! The cake got quite a few compliments and I would definitely make it again. Here are a couple tips: 1. I  followed the suggestion of another reviewer to use thread to cut the cakes in half. It worked well - just wrap the thread around the cake and pull. The only thing I'd do differently is cut a little notch in the cake before wrapping the thread around, because there are a few seconds when you first starting pulling the thread and the cake just squishes (the thread doesn't cut through at first), but don't worry, it bounces right back after the thread cuts through, even if you don't cut a notch. 2. I also used 2 14.5 oz cans of tart cherries. It was enough, but I wished I had a little more so I could put a full cup of cherry filling in each layer. Next time I'll use 3 14.5 oz cans, though that will probably make too much filling.

This was my first try at making a Black Forest Cake and I decided to try it because it is my husband's favourite cake. This recipe was so easy. I substituted apple sauce for the vegetable oil. My husband and son raved, so did our guests. Shall definately make it again, as a matter of fact our son has already put in his order for his birthday this month. Thanks again and God bless.

The cake was very good but it needed something to make it more moist. I didn't use 2 cans of cherries I only used one. Next time we will try adding more milk for a more moist cake.

This recipe was fantastic! I did use some of the recommendations people have listed: Since I couldn't find sour cherries, I used 1 3/4 cans of regular cherry pie filling. I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the whipped cream. And, as I was layering the cake, I poked each layer with toothpicks and drizzled a little Kirsh over it (no more than 1 1/2 tbsp for the whole thing). I let the cake sit in the fridge overnight, so all of the juices from the cherries and moisture of the Kirsh could settle in.

I was worried to make this. My only complaint was the stirring of the cherries. After having it on low for 15min and not even feeling slightly warm I bumped it up to low/med temp and was finally done in 10 min (total 25min) of stirring.     Also was unable to find pitted sour cherries but used the coctail cherries and worked just fine.    Will be making it again tonight for xmas even dinner tomorrow. Hope it transports well. BUT I think I'll be adding dowels soI can transport and remove upon arrival.    Also dosed each layer in Grand Marnier and was DIVINE

I made this cake for my wedding anniversary and oh how my 4 adult children loved it! Maybe because it really looks plush...anyway, i followed everything except that the available pitted cherries here is on glass jars but still close and more than the one stated. I just loved it and will definitely make more of this on special occasions but maybe I will try putting shaved chocolates on the sides to make it more posh. Thanks for this lovely recipe...this is even better than the commercial ones available!

Tastes great but wow, this took a long time to make.  Definitely follow others advice and start the cherry sauce first.  Looks beautiful when finished.  Not sure I'll make again because of the time and labor involved.  Husband loved it. Had plenty of cherry sauce leftover.  Would likely scale back a bit on that next time.

The chocolate cake recipe is very good. But i find problems with the whipping cream. I followed the instruction, but the cream is very soft. I think the next time i will try adding more confectioners sugar in the whipped cream for stiffer result.

I just made the cake part for my boyfriend's birthday.  I made a 1.5X recipe for a 13X9 pan and this made just the right size of cake.  I used dark chocolate cocoa powder which gave the cake a great flavor, and just put cream cheese frosting on it.  The perfect chocolate cake.

The firm texture of the cake made it easy to layer. On the down-side, it was quite dry the first day. After being in the fridge with the whipped cream icing for a day or two, it became much more moist and tasty. I'm not sure how to find the ballance between texture and taste... I would also suggest using ALL the juice from the cherries, instead of discarding all but 1/2 cup. I ended up with not enough cherry topping and what there was of it was very very thick.

Amazing cake. I did make some changes, but only out of necessity: I replaced the eggs with a vegan egg substitute and bought vanilla icing (without any milk) to use instead of making the recipe version with the whipping cream. Overall, my vegan cake was delightful! I made one for my German class and everyone loved it trememdously. It's simple and moist and doesn't require an exhausting amount of babying or expensive ingredients like some cakes.

This cake was SO good. Just what I was looking for when I had four hours to bake a cake, cook some filling, whip some cream, and decorate the cake! It was a fun morning for sure. Thanks so much for this recipe, black forest cake is my FAVE!

Very good for a black forest recipe. Made it for my birthday and was very happy with the results. Adding shaved chocolate on top or chocolate chips in the cake would make a wonderful addition.

Excellent black forest cake recipe.  Made it for my dad for his 60th birthday last year and it was great.  I substituted the cherry filling with strawberries, which worked well!!

Excellent!  We had an Oktoberfest gathering and this cake was a huge hit!  I used tart cherries which is a smaller can than what this recipe calls for.  However I used the extra juice from the cans to make extra sauce and moisten the cake layers.  This cake will definitely be on our Holiday table this year.

Great recipe with a professional look! My friends were surprised that I made it. I only made a some slight changes: I made a ganache to add in the layers to give it some textural difference and I used 20 oz can of cherry pie filling to save some time. I didn't have enough cherries to fully top my cake, so I'd recommend using a little less in the middle layers.

I was looking for a rich chocolate cake and this was not it.  The cake itself was only mediocre and I truly would have preferred a nice ganache over all of that whipped cream.  The cherries, however, were awesome and delicious.  I thoroughly enjoyed the cherries I made up with this recipe.

When I tried this recipe the cake mix came out all glutinous... I was really upset. It baked fine, in under 30 minutes but I was really disappointed with the results... need to add more milk to the recipe and mix the wet ingredients first, then add the dry... it could make the difference.

This is impressive!  Looks like it came from a fancy bakery and tastes as good as it looks.  Be careful not to overbake
the cake which causes the dryness some have complained about.  I used canned cherry pie filling (about 1 1/2 cans). I might add a little almond extract to the filling next time

This was ok.  I found that the cake was indeed a little dry and next time I would use a moister recipe for the cake part.  I gave it 4 stars cause my husband liked it and although time consuming, it made for a pretty presentation.  I added some shaved chocolate and used canned cherry pie filling like lots of other reviewers.

Overall, this wasn't a bad cake. The cake was quite dry and ended up sticking to the pans. But, overall assembly wasn't hard. The frosting was light and good. It held up very well overnight - I kept it in the fridge and then traveled with it the next day - it did great. However, the dryness really detracted from this recipe. Such good flavors really had nothing to hold on with the crumbly cake.

Everyone loved this cake. The only thing I would change is with the cherry filling recipe. Make the sauce without putting the cherries in the pan until it has thickened. My cherries were too mushy. But it was so delicious’

Great recipe! This is the best black forest cake I have ever made. I made a few modifications:
Blended in egg yolks, beat egg whites and folded in.
Used bada cherries cut in half, drained the juice and used amount in the recipe but did not add sugar. Thickened juice with cornstarch and spread on each layer, added cherries to whipped cream and spread between layers.
Reduced confectioners sugar by half
I did not cut the layers in half as the layers were not high enough; I made a third layer for a higher cake. Did not mash cake for the sides, instead frosted and put chocolate shavings all around. 
Decorated with maraschino cherries, well drained.

I made it for Thanksgiving with my grandaughter this afternoon and made wonderful memories with her. My granddaughter wanted a chocolate cake and decided to challenge ourselves in baking this beautiful cake. It was really a joint effort and had so much fun in making come together. 

The only change we made was the two cans of tart cherries it called for;  we added one can tart and the other sweet making them two different shades of red and two different sizes of cherries.  You can see the two colors together made a great combination on top.

Tip, before adding the cherry filling between the layers or on top, make sure it has been cooled off enough or they will be runny. I placed the cherry filling in freezer as I placed the icing on the cake. Gave them more consistency.

I have  been making this cake for well over 10 years.
Came back again today to get the recipe and figured it was about time I gave it a review.

Everyone loves this cake and nobody ever believes I made it.
What like a mechanic/Cattle Rancher can't follow instructions?

I don't really change much when I make it except for the cherries.
We can our own cherries so I use a couple of quarts of them when I make this cake.
Be patient, when the recipe says stir constantly over low heat until thickened they mean it, plan on being at the stove for 20 minutes and you will end up with a filling people will rave about.
I cut the dome off each cake before cutting in half and make a 4 layer version using the dome pieces to break up into crumbs to coat the whip cream on the sides.
Along with the cake crumbs on the sides I grate bakers  chocolate and use it as well.
Take your time, follow instructions, make the cherry filling  one day, make the cake the next then make the cream and assemble the following day.
Cake is best after it has chilled in fridge overnight.
Yes It takes 4 days before you can eat my cake but nobody has ever complained yet and leftovers never exist.

Great recipe.  I agree with others that I found it difficult to find the canned cherries so I just used cherry pie filling. 

 I also made mine 4 layers instead of 3 but I crumbled the cut off from when I levelled the cakes and added that to the bottom of the cake.  I then also made a chocolate ganache and made it a drip cake.

I made this cake for my husband's 39th birthday on Wednesday. It turned out really well. My 5 year old daughter had fun putting on the cherries.

It was Okay, not fantastic. I didn't follow the recipe to the exact as I'm cheap; bought cherry pie filling,  So can't comment on the cherries. But for the cake recipe the ratio of wet to dry seemed off and it was so I added a cup more of milk. That worked, otherwise the cake was average not the best but not the worst either. I was also surprised to see no Kirsch, weird for a Black forest cake to not have (but again I'm cheap so meh). If you're going to make this cake be prepared to make alterations.

I just made this cake and it is absolutely delicious! The chocolate cake has a nice vanilla taste to it which goes perfectly with the whipped cream and cherry topping. I used maraschino cherries instead of sour and I was a little worried they would be too sweet but it turned out excellent!

My  family loved it even if it looked like a Pinterest fail. I used cherry pie  filling plus a jar of sour cherries.  Spiked the filling with a little cherry brandy. Made four layers, it looked bad but tasted good. I didn’t have an icing bag to pipe the whipped cream so...

This was my first time ever making a Black Forest Cake, and it was great! I added more cocoa powder, less sugar (and half brown/half white at that), butter instead of oil, and buttermilk in place of regular milk in the cake!.Turned out nice and dark chocolatey! Yum! And for the cherries, I simply used some of my frozen tart cherries, put them in a pot to heat up, and followed along with the recipe for adding corn starch and sugar to them from there. Those worked great too! This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a cake like my oma used to make, and with this I found it. I made it for my mother and she was over the moon at how similar this was. It's been a long time since I made/decorated any cake so it could look better-and it was difficult to pat chocolate on the sides (I used shaved semi-sweet bakers chocolate), but the taste was right on. It even travelled across town well.

This cake turned out great.  I gave the recipe five because I liked the cake itself very much.  I made a few alterations like using cherry pie filling for between the layers and didn’t grumble on of the cake layers instead had four layers.  The end result was an easy cake that looked great (used shaved chocolate for a dusting over the whipped cream).  It also stored well covered in the fridge for leftovers.

This was a great cake. I liked that it did not include alcohol; I don't care for Kirschwasser. The chocolate cake is a great stand alone recipe. It was easy - love a good one bowl cake. The crumb was tender, cake moist without falling apart, and the flavor was sublime. The cherry filling was so easy and not a cloying sweet  like canned pie filling. I did reduce the amount of sugar by 1/4 - 1/3 cup to keep some of the tart of the cherries. That tart really did provide some balance to this cake. The quantity of heavy whipping cream called for was way too much. I think 2 cups, prior to whipping, would have been ample. Otherwise, the powder sugar was a great addition. It was not too sweet and was the crowning touch to this cake. It was truly a great cake - the ladies I shared it with were full of compliments  - appearance, taste, texture! I will definitely be making this again. Thank you Linda Greer for this tasty contribution!

This cake turned out wonderfully!! Perfect recipe!! I made it exactly as-is, except I used two cans of cherry pie filling, instead of making my own filling because I couldn’t find the pitted cherries - and it was still great.  Much easier than it LOOKS - and is a great presentation!

My family absolutely loved it! Sweet, but not too sweet. I was hesitant to use that much sugar first, but decided to follow the recipe and it was a good decision since the sourness of cherries balanced the sweetness perfectly. Very moist cake. I am sure it will become our new favourite cake. Thank you for the recipe!

I will definitely make it again. In fact, this was my second time using this recipe.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly. This time I needed to save time, so I substituted  Duncan Hines Comstock brand cherry pie filling and it was every bit as good.  I used the pie filling they say has 20 % more cherries and there were really lots of cherries in it.

I've made this cake a number of times and it is quick, easy and delicious . I do make a couple substitutes by using pie filling and a tub of cool whip.

Very good cake, but I was glad I checked it early...I didn't need to bake  35 minutes.  After reading comments, I substituted the vanilla with  1/4 cup Kirsch and cut the sugar in half for the sour cherries in a jar.  Also, from comments, kept all 4 layers and brushed each with Kirsch and used shaved chocolate on the outside.  Excellent and will make it again! And....did make it  a day ahead, except for final layer of whipping cream and top cherries.

Overall a great cake with excellent flavours however the whipped cream frosting broke down very quickly which made this cake hard to cut and not so pretty to serve to my guests.  They all loved the flavours, i was the one disappointed with the presentation

I’m giving this one four stars, it was good, but not fantastic.  The sour cherries have a bland color and I need to add red food coloring to the cherries to make them a pretty color.  I thought the cake was a bit dry and could have used a brush with a chocolate syrup or cherry brandy.  I also filled another reviewers tip to stabilize the whipped cream with gelatin to make the whipped cream hold up.  I choose to use all four layers in the cake and used grated chocolate on the sides of the cake, instead of crumbled cake.  Also, it serves more than 12, I could have easily served ;16, as it’s very rich

Easy, delicious and a show stopper! Very elegant for celebrations, or if you just love a delicious chocolaty cake with cherries and whipped cream.  I only added Belgium grated chocolate flakes on top. I baked the cake one day before and made my cherry sauce.  The next day I only had to whip the cream and assemble the cake.  It was great to make my cake from scratch too.  Cooking my own cherry sauce enabled me to add more cherries to the sauce than what you get in a can of pie cherry sauce.

All I did was add 2 teaspoons almond extract to the cake batter and 1 teaspoon to the cherry sauce... I'm German and it's gotta taste like cherry through and through! Your directions  were awesome!  Tasted just like Oma's!

I used real cherries since they were in season.  It was more work but it was worth it.  I boiled them for 20-25 minutes until they were cooked and then pitted them.  They were much easier to pit once they were cooked. Then I added the cornstarch and sugar.  I put much less sugar than was called for in all of the recipe since I don't like it too sweet.  I found the batter was not enough to put into 2 pans.  The batter was very good tasting and had the right amount of chocolate.  I would make it again.  If you want a very high cake, you may want to double the batter.  I would make it again.  It was delicious!

This was a great recipe! Everyone loved it. I made it for Mother's Day. My mom's favorite cake is Black Forest, and because we have children we couldn't use alcohol. So this was a great recipe for a kid-friendly cake. I made the cherry mixture and cake the day before and assembled it the day-of. I was worried it would be too wet if I did it the day before. Turns out, it might have been better to make it the day before to incorporate the moisture from the cherries into the cake. The cake recipe was wonderful - it had a fudge consistency. I also used shaved chocolate instead of the crumbled cake. It added texture. It was a big hit! I'll be using this recipe again!

Easy to make! A great tasting cake. I think it's worth the effort to find the cherries rather than going for pie filling. Will make again.

reason for 3 stars was, to me the cake was on the dry side. The changes I made, I used maraschino cherry buttercream frosting, and cherry pie filling.

Excellent dense cake!!  2 tips...Be sure to add a couple of tablespoons of sour cream to ensure moistness and heat the cherries at a HIGH heat, stirring constantly, otherwise cherries will break apart.  Also, If you don't like the whipped cream icing you could use a cream cheese icing. Family loved it!!!

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever tasted.  It was moist and people raved about it. Anybody that said the cake did not come out right or was not moist obviously didn't cook it correctly. I couldn't find sour cherries so I used sweet cherries in a can. They were wonderful. To add more depth to the cake I made a Kahlúa glaze and brushed each layer with it. Everyone that had a piece was in total chocolate heaven. It was the highlight of my Christmas dinner.

I followed this recipe to the exactly.  It turned out great! My wife loved this cake for her birthday. It was even better after it sat in the refrigerator overnight.  I recommend making this the day before the occasion you're going to use it for .  It looked exactly the way it is in the picture.

This was made as a birthday cake and was very well received by everyone. The cake was nicely chocolatey and quite dense, but the filling and frosting prevented it from being dry.  I used cherry pie filling instead of cooking the cherries as per the recipe. It was perfect - lots of whole cherries and not too sweet. I grated chocolate and used that instead of cake crumbs to decorate the whipped cream frosting. I stabilized the cream with gelatine as suggested by a previous poster, and it really did keep the cream from deflating.  I shall use this recipe again for special occasions.

Very tasty!  I had a request for a Black Forest Cake for a party my husband and I were attending.  I decided to make this recipe into cupcakes for ease while eating .  They turned out great.  They had a nice texture and flavor.  I took part of the middle out to add my cherry filling and topped with the whip cream topping. They were a hit.  I will make again without a doubt.

Made the recipe exactly as instructed except I only had 8" round pans; baked it for 40 minutes.  Super moist, delicious and full flavoured.  Duncan Hines no more, ever!

My husband loved this cake!  I made it for his birthday as I'd been promising him that I would make him a Black  Forrest  Cake "someday" for over a year.  This recipe reminds me of making baklava: it has lots  of steps but all are easy.  The toughest part  was finding canned cherries!  I didn't so I bought 2 bottles of cherries in alcohol & 1 can of pie filling.  I rinsed the pie filling bc I wanted all homemade & used the liquid from bottled cherries. I also followed the suggestion for making a kirsch-cherry juice syrup to drizzle on cake layers.  Highly recommend doing this.  I also agree that this cake tastes better if made 1-2 days in advance.  The flavors were much better over time.  I didn't like whole cherries between the cake layers.  Next time, I will reserve enough cherries for the top layer & chop the rest for between the layers.

I just recently made this amazing black forest cake. Normally the homemade cakes that I make you need to make three mixtures and add in ingredants ina certian order. I is really nice that this cake you can wip up in less than 10 minutes and it's ready to put into the over right away. the wipped cream recipe is really delicous!!

The cake itself was a little dry. The entire process is too time-consuming for what turned out to be a mediocre dessert.

I made this cake with everything except for the cherry filling, which I used the canned kind for. I received many compliments, even that it was the best Black Forest cake they'd ever tasted!  Will make again.

I had to use canned tart cherries and used special dark cocoa powder.  The cake was delicious and not too sweet.  I will make this again, it was very easy.

My husband loves black forest cake, so I decided to try this one out after reading reviews.  The only thing we didn't have were the cherries, so I used cherry pie can filling in the middle and on top as others had suggested - this worked well.  Texture of the cake was amazing - cut horizontally well with a knife.  Will definitely use this base for other cakes.  The whole family enjoyed this!

Really easy and tasted awesome.  more cherries would have been nice but thats just an opinion.  I'm in Canada and found the cherries in jars in the canned fruit section.  (SOBEY'S)

Usually when I make a cake it comes out very dense. I made this over the weekend for my daughter's 16th birthday, and it was delicious! I didn't overmix it! I didn't make any changes to the cake itself. But I layered it with a tiramisu cheesecake found on this site, so I didn't do the crumb coating part. When I made the topping I used the called for amount of cherries, didn't measure the juice (just used it all) and doubled the sugar, cornstarch and vanilla. We topped it all with Kahlua whipped cream. The result was an amazing combination that everyone loved (will post a picture of it). Thank you so much for this recipe! Next time we will make it solo. But we will definitely make it again.

I made this for Christmas and it was a huge hit! I kept thinking, "why am I not using the canned cherry pie filling" as I was making the cherry mixture, but in the end, I am glad I made it as it was written in the recipe. I also did as some suggested and used some cherry juice and sugar but I  mixed in a little cherry extract instead of any liquor and brushed it on the cakes. I will absolutely make this again.!

I did have to double up on this recipe to make this cake as tall as I wanted. But the cake was great! The batter is extremely thick once it's all mixed. Don't worry It WILL cook properly :)

Have made this cake 5 times now and every time I have made it everyone LOVES it.  The cherry filling is amazing!!  So much better than cherry pie filling or the grocery store  Black Forest cake cherry filling.  Delicious.

Made this for my dads birthday since it is his favorite cake. It was a lot of work but well worth it. Didn't make any changes to the recipe it self, just how I decorated it. I used grated dark chocolate for around the cake instead of crumbled cake. I ended up making/using four thin layers to the cake instead of 3 and in doing so I had to whip up extra whipping cream. Also the layers were all even I didn't have to trim any, big time saver!! I will defiantly make this cake again everyone loved it. It came out super moist. I give it 5 stars!

I also prepared the cherry filling beforehand so it was cool before using. I preferred to make more cherry filling that is in the recipe, or else you might get two very thin layers in the middle and on the top. 
I used grated chocolate on the side of the cake instead of crumbs, which also looked and tasted great. I have made this cake at least 3 times, and works perfectly every time. 
Quite a lot of work to make, but looks so impressive!

The cake was really good, I didn't like the cherry filling much, and will look for a replacement for that aspect, although I guess it could have been the brand of the cherries?

This is the best cake I have made from scratch.  If you can't find the cherries look in the fruit isle, not in the baking isle.  My family loves it. Thanks for sharing it.

Cakes didn't rise so I could only do 2 layers, and yes I used the correct measurements. Also the recipe would have been easier to follow if the ingredients were listed in the order of when their are in the directions

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I first made it for my German class on our food day and everyone loved it. There was one flaw though. When making the cherry filling the liquid will not thicken unless you turn up the temperature. When you go to make the filling, follow the recipe but cook on low for 10 minutes, take off the heat, then turn the stove on high. After the stove reaches it's max temp, put the filling back onto the stove and stir as quickly as possible for 30 sec-1 min. Immediately after but it back on low and stir for 5 more minutes then the filling is ready.

The cake was very yummy but i felt like it needed more cherries & next time I'll not cook the cake as long.  The flavor of the cake was very good! My family already asked me to make it again for next Christmas!

Pretty good recipe, although I found it a bit bland.  This may be due to the fact I made my own cherry filling since I couldn't find any of the sour cherry filling.  It did turn out a bit dry so perhaps adding some more liquid ingredients would help.  I also had to make a second batch of the cake mix since it would not slice into 4 layers.  Perhaps it's a fault of mine & not the recipe.  Unsure, but it was unnecessarily complicated for me.

I used the cake part of this recipe and the whipped cream part.  The cake part is very easy to make, hence why I chose it.  However I left out the cherry part as it doesn't seem very authentic.  Instead I just use can/jar sour cherries just by itself in every layer.  I use some of the light syrup the cherries come in, add a bit of sugar and kirshwasser to it and moisten each layer of the cake with it.  The fact this recipe doesn't have kirshwasser mean it is NOT the original.  Still the cake recipe is awesome, takes like 10 minutes to whip up and into the oven.

I made this for my son for his 26th birthday and he loved it! I made 3 layers with 9 inch pans. And they were done in about 15-17 minutes. I wasn't fond of the idea of crumbling cake to decorate with, that didn't sound pretty at all. Instead I made chocolate curls using a vegetable peeler and a King Size Hershey bar (it's wider than a reg. size bar). 
I found "Tart" canned cherries at Walmart. The cans were smaller than 20 oz. but 2 cans made plenty. It's not a cheap cake to make, nor was it quick to make, but for a special occasion, this is worth it. Make it all from scratch, don't cheat on any of it, otherwise, what's the point of making a cake from a recipe? 
Note: the filling does take a while to thicken! And you need to heat it a little more towards a med. temp., not on low temp. as the recipe suggests.

Made as directed with only once exception.  Added 2 shots of espresso + milk to = 1 Cup.  Simple and delicious.  Followed suggestions of others and made the cherry filling first and let it cool while I baked the cake.

This cake was wonderful and a big hit at my job. I added Cherry brandy to the cherry sauce and also brushed the Cherry brandy soak in to the cake, which added a delicious flavor to the cake. The only change I'll make is probably use a buttercream frosting for the outside frosting on the cake.

I'm a senior and self taught baker. I always wanted to try a black forest cake, but all the recipes I read were to cumbersome. So, I tried this black forest cake recipe, I Loved it!!  The only thing I have changed, I used fine chopped dark chocolate instead of the crumbled cake to the frosting. Turned out perfect and tasted wonderful. Thanks for the recipe

I followed this recipe to the 2 and made a delicious cake for my boyfriend's birthday. Read all the reviews as well and found some good tips like making the filling/topping first, baking it a day before you plan to serve it and cutting the cake with thread instead of a knife.

Very delicious, I left the cake in the oven about 5 minutes too long but it was still very yummy! Next time I will take it out 5 minutes early. I also used unsweetened dark chocolate powder for this recipe.

i went to look for sour pitted cherries, and boy was I SUPER glad I did it!!  I LOVE how the tartness cut through the sweetness of the cake, giving it an overall balanced flavor (sis found it too sour though, but I LOVE it)

oh yes, i didn't add any sugar to the cherries (don't like things too sweet), but did add the cornstarch - it caused the syrup to be very grainy and powdery (not sure if it's cos' i omitted the sugar) - so i dumped in more syrup to kindda 'wash it out'. 

in future, i will just use the sour cherries fresh out of the bottle!

This was pretty easy receipt. I couldn't find any sour pitted cherries so I went with cherry pie filling instead. This was a real time saver and I would recommend doing this if you are short on time. Apparently German bakeries are the place to go to look for cherries. My cake turned out pretty good but I had issues when I put the cherry topping on the top layer. My cake wasn't completely level so I had a "landslide" down one side. I also added some whip cream from a can (I know, I cheated a bit) but I did it too soon and had to re do it right before serving. I'll definitely try this one again for my husband's birthday next year.

I am giving this recipe four stars because I left out the cherry filling mix for this cake and did my own thing. I first scaled down the recipe to make these into a small batch of cupcakes and inserted a maraschino cherry which was soaked in cherry brandy for a few days into the center of the cupcake before baking. I frosted it like a normal cupcake and grated milk chocolate over it and used Christmas themed sprinkles to go with the season. It was enjoyed like that and the cherry in the middle kept the flavour and was a nice surprise to find. You can use your favourite alcohol to soak the cherries in. I did it again and used whiskey this time. I followed everything else in the recipe exactly. Delicious.

To save time, I used a box of devil's food cake instead of the cake recipe provided. The filling tasted great.  Although, the cake doesn't travel well; slanted a bit in my cake carrier.  Perhaps if I had let it chill longer before taking it to my family's house it would have held up better.
