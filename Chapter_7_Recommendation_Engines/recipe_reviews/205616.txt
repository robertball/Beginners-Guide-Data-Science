I found a recipe by a chef who bought the sauce, read the label for ingredients, and kept making it until he got it right. He said that the type of mayo used will affect how it tastes...I haven't had a chance to make it yet but the website is justtherecipe.com

This is THE sauce!  I've tried making it with other recipes that call for sriracha sauce, but it never came out right.  The last time we went to our favorite Japanese restaurant the chef gave us the basic ingredient list -- identical to this.  Everyone in our family loves it.  Didn't have tomato paste so we substituted with ketchup and it was still great.

You have to let it sit overnight and I'd use Hellmans Mayo. It's the best for this recipe. Don't use any other kind.

I'm confused because I have been cooking for a long time... sure do know how to follow a recipe and I followed this to the letter. I know yum yum sauce and this wasn't it.  Not sure why this is rating so well.  Sorry.  :(

Good starter recipe..

I've made this with tomato paste. It was ok, but it didn't come out quite right. I asked two of my friends and showed them the recipe, and they laughed at me. :( The pale orange color is not due to tomato paste, it should be due to the paprika. Rather than tomato paste, I now use 1.5 tablespoons of rice vinegar and 1.5 tablespoons of takara mirin (cooking wine). Though these can be adjusted to taste. Don't use the fake kikoman mirin found in most general supermarkets either. 

Lastly. If available in your area, use Kewpie mayo or any other Japanese brand mayo. It is more yolk based and will give you a more authentic taste if you've eaten at a more authentic hibachi joint.

You can also go the route of making your own mayo from a Japanese recipe. ... I've also seen sakura recipes without paprika and instead use soy sauce, mirin, garlic powder, and pepper. Experiment a little. :)

this recipe tastes nothing like the yum yum sauce at our local steakhouse. it tastes like straight mayo, and only straight mayo.

This sauce is awesome! I did cut the mayo back a little because of the reviews and I increased the cayenne pepper and added a splash of rice vinegar for a little zip. Now if only I can learn to make that little onion volcano, I'll have my own personal Hibachi kitchen.

This was pretty close to what we get at our local Japanese restaurant.  I added some pomegranate balsmic vinegar and it added the zip it needed.

I love it. It's very similar to what you get at the Japanese restaurants. I did use Hellmann's  and added 1 tsp more of tomato paste like another reviewer suggested. I will definitely be making this again. Goes great with Glo's Fried Rice from this site

I have to agree that I felt this recipe had a little too much mayo (I used Hellmans) I used about 1/2 cup less than the recipe called (which makes less sauce but Im the only one in our family who eats it so it worked out great!) for with same spice amounts and a little extra sugar and it was fantastic!! We just moved away from my all time favorite Hibachi place and I am so glad that I can make my own sauce now! Priceless! Thank you so much!

Fantastic! I added a little more tomato paste and sugar to taste and this was GREAT! Letting it sit for a while lets the ingredients blend together, this is just like what they serve at our local japanese steak house! Thanks for adding this recipe!

Tastes a little like mayo, so I doubled the spices with the same amount of mayo, that worked fine!

OK so I tweeked it a bit and it is perfect. Replace the water with seasoned rice vinegar. Double( I tripled) the tomato paste and seasonings. Perfect even right after making. Even better after sitting.

The first time I made this I did it with Hellman's Mayo.  It came out ok but was something was still a little off.  The second time I made it I used Kewpie mayo from the ethnic Isle in walmart and it made all the difference.  The smell, color, consistency,  and flavor was perfect.  I definitely recommend using the Kewpie mayo if you want it to come out lIke the white sauce in restaurants.

This tastes NOTHING like the yum yum sauce at any Japanese steakhouse I've ever been to.  It tastes just like mayo with a little kick from the spices.

Great starter recipe. I tried it as is, but found it needs at least 1-2 teaspoons more of tomato paste. YOU HAVE TO LET IT SIT OVERNIGHT before you try it. That is the key. The longer the favors meld, the better. I made another batch to use for next weekend. We also use only Hellmanns. That is a must.

Just like hibachi. Every restaurant is a little different so you can tweak this with a little rice wine vinegar or extra sugar and spices to taste. For me I just added little more tomato paste and a touch of vinegar. Money!!

This is a good recipe, letting it sit overnight is KEY!!! Even more than one day is better. For those expecting it to taste just like a Japanese steakhouse please consider they are making this in large batches and it is not freshly made each day so when it sits and the flavor incorporates it tastes even better!

Im impressed. Despite the warning to use Hellmanns Mayo, I decided against it & used reduced fat Dukes Mayo instead. Also, I added a tsp more of sugar since I like my sauce a tad sweeter. Ate this with healthy "brown rice" fried rice....AMAZING! BTW I'm inpatient so I didn't leave my sauce overnight, I put it in the fridge for about an hour until my rice was done. YUM YUM YUM.

This was wonderful however, for all of those planning on making this.. I agree with other raters.  It is all in the Mayo!  Make sure you pick a mayo that you are familiar with and like.

Very good, though I did double the sugar as I prefer the sauce on the sweeter side.  I plan on experimenting more with it when I make it again.

The trick to a correct sauce is using Japanese mayo. I've tried many versions, including using butter, and I've found that it's highly dependent on the mayo. Some recipes specify Hellmann's is the only way to go, but it's also too mayonnaise-y. You have to buy Kewpie Mayonnaise (I got it at a local Asian store, but it's also on Amazon) or another Japanese mayo for this to be right. Then it's a touch of tomato paste, sugar, paprika, cayenne, and garlic powder. I just kept editing them to taste, but you MUST get Japanese mayo for this to taste even close. FINALLY I found something close enough to work when I did this.

This recipe is awesome! I did double the tomato paste as recommended in previous reviews and it was perfect! My husband doubted that it would even be similar but after tasting it he said I nailed it. I will definitely be making it again!

I really liked this sauce, but my husband didn't. May be because I didn't wait the 8 hours to serve it. I've made it twice, and will probably continue to make it for myself if we are out of store-bought.

My husband and I loved this sauce!  We used it on rice with a vegetable stir fry and it was great.  It wasn't quite the same as our favorite steak house sauce, however, so I'll keep looking for that.  Delicious, nonetheless!  Thank you!

Quick, easy and EXACTLY how it was made in the Japanese steakhouse I used to work at. Just make sure you use regular mayo like the recipe calls for and not salad dressing (No Miracle Whip) otherwise it will change the taste. Let it sit overnight, if you can, so the flavors can marry and improve the flavor.

To the "most helpful critical reviewer" that was not sure why this recipe rated so well and went as far to say this wasn't Yum Yum sauce,  I don't know what to tell you because this recipe is spot on.

This recipe is so close & I kept making it & tweaking the mayo etc then wasnt writing down the changes like replace water with rice wine, heating it, more butter, less garlic etc. I got it to taste exactly right.

Like other reviewers have said, make sure to (1) use rice wine vinegar for the water and (2) double the spices (but not the butter, mayo, or vinegar).  I never made it as the recipe is written, but following those two tips was clutch. Gonna be dipping everything in this!!

What a terrific condiment for meats, veggies, truly YUM YUM!  I halved the recipe and just eye-balled the ingredients.  I did add a bit more tomato paste based on the reviews.  Had some simple syrup in the fridge, so I just used a drizzle for the water and sugar.  A definite do-over!  Served a dollop on asian burgers, great meal.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with AR. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Asian-Barbecue-Burgers/?prop31=1

The sauce was easy to make! Definitely use Hellmans Mayo. I'm not a Hellmans fan and my Dukes Mayo didn't taste the same, even though I prefer Dukes over Hellmans any day! Great recipe!!! If you want some additional knowledge of the sauce check this site out

Loved this! We didn't let it sit overnight. Didn't have tomato paste so used Ketchup instead and increased it by 2 tablespoons. Added quite a bit of cayenne pepper. Did use Hellmann's mayo. It was a little bland following the recipe but perked up using more ketchup.

LOVE THIS! It doesn't taste "right" when I dip my finger in it, but on chicken and rice it's perfect! It HAS to sit overnight, though, or the flavors don't mix enough. Thanks for this!

I used Hellman's Mayo with olive oil so I suppose this might not be a fair review.
I followed the recipe to a T but all I can taste is mayo.

The color wasn't right, it seemed too thick, and wasn't sweet at all. Perhaps my expectations are misplaced, or a different mayo makes a huge difference, but with olive oil mayo, I did not care for it.

This recipe is very similiar to what you get at Japanese hibachi places.  My family loves it!  I put teriyaki on chicken and shrimp in the skillet.  Then make a side of fried rice.  I serve it all with this sauce.  It saves us the $70 it costs for our family to eat out at a Japanese place and cures the craving!

This is NOT the sauce you get at the Japanese steakhouse. Maybe they add more sugar and some other secret ingredients. But this wasn't the taste I was hoping for.

My son  and his family love  Japanese steakhouse eating and cooking. Saw this recipe so had to make for his christening of his flat top grill. After reading the reviews I cut the garlic in half and doubled all the other spices. Still tooooooo much garlic and I love garlic. Next time I will only add a pinch of garlic powder and increase the the other spices to 2 1/2 times.  Still ok but too much garlic powder

Followed recipe exactly. This is not what I was looking for. Is nothing like the sauce served at our local Japanese steakhouse.   Not the same color or consistency at all.  This was like something you would put on a hamburger. Won't make again.

Tastes great!!! Although I did have to make major adjustments to the amounts in the recipe. I was successful using only half the amount of mayo, doubling the spices, and using less water. Great taste overall though!!

Simple and Yummy!! Just like the restaurants make. Really needs to sit overnight to marinate together.

Gets the job done. Here is how I avoided the mayo taste: 

Double the ketchup (tomato paste), butter, and sugar.
Triple the paprika and garlic powder.

Add spices, water, sugar and butter, microwave to melt. This will take ~25 seconds. If you forget the water your butter is going to make a mess... make sure to cover.  Put in fridge to cool 5 minutes before adding your mayo. Take out, add everything else. USE A WHISK; your mix should not be lumpy. Put back in fridge covered, gets better longer it sits.

Mayo used: Helmans light
Ketchup used: Kroger brand original 
Butter: Country Crock original 
Garlic salt and Paprika: 5th Season and Great Value

I am still trying to figure out the "zing" the restaurant achieves- I figure like most reviewers it must be some vinegar. If you use the right ketchup, you may be able to avoid using the vinegar.

I am a chef by trade and always look for something to try. This sauce is a good base. I added fish sauce and oyster sauce and my customers loved it. I wanted a spicier version and added toasted bird peppers and now I cant make enough to keep it in stock.

This recipe is good. However, I used 1 cup of mayo and doubled the rest of the ingredients. With this alteration, the sauce was fantastic!

This is the sauce. 
For those saying it tastes different:

1. It MUST sit for at least 4 hours for the flavors to blend or it WON'T taste right. 

2. Most Yum Yum sauce in actual Japanese restaurants is loaded with MSG. It's addicting and that's why places put it in their food even though it's bad for you. Maybe that's what you're not tasting and why it isn't doing the same thing for you. It's like drinking coffee or soda decaff. You can't really taste the caffeine is gone but your brain knows it's not there and tells you something just isn't the same. Same concept. I guarantee that if you go buy some msg at the store and add a little and let it set 4 hours it will taste the same but MSG is NOT good for you so I'd just get used to liking the sauce without all the addicting chemicals businesses add to keep you coming back.

This tasted like straight mayo... so sad! I would cut back the mayo and add more tomato paste, more sugar, more water and added some sweet rice vinegar to improve the taste.

Because this is commonly used with Japanese dishes, I used Japanese Kewpie mayo. It's a little sweet and subtle. Use this if regular mayo is too overpowering.

Very tasty addition to any meal! Very close to Japanese Steak House Yum Yum sauce. I used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper for flavor suited to our taste. Wonderful! I'll make it again and again!

If you add about 1/2 to 3/4 of a teaspoon of distilled white vinegar and add more sugar (I didn't measure but I added to taste) you'll get a more tangy flavor which is what I've known to be Japanese shrimp sauce. Adding the vinegar and sugar gave it the flavor I was looking for.

I left out the Tomato Paste & White Sugar -- and added Rice Vinegar & Brown Sugar instead.  Really works better IMHO.

Also for an interesting variation, thrown in an appropriate amount of your favorite curry powder.  Awesome!

I'm giving this recipe 2 stars because I had to modify it a lot in order for it to taste good.  The original recipe tastes nothing like what I get in the restaurant.  I even used Kewpie Japanese mayo like someone suggested.

Ive been looking for this recipe for years!   It is just like the white sauce at Fujis. It may not be the traditional yum yum, but I've made all of those and they weren't what I wanted,  they all used vinegar, didn't like them. This nailed it, finally!   THANK YOU!!

This tastes like straight up mayo until you add more sugar.  I think that the sugar ratio is off.  My family loved it and though it was the best they had outside of a resturant.

followed the recipe "to a tee." Hellmann's mayonnaise is an important ingredient that should be mentioned in the recipe. Other than that this is a very good copy of the Japanese Steakhouse Yum Yum Steak Sauce.  Thumbs up

I'm giving this four stars because I doctored it so much from the original.  I live in Virginia, and in my town there are two Japanese Steakhouses and about a dozen Japanese Express takeout places.  I know people who come back to Lynchburg JUST for the yum yum sauce.  I believe I've had yum yum sauce more like what this recipe produces, but, I don't like mine thick and syrupy, so, I really think it depends on what kind of Yum Yum you're looking for based on what your local restaurant serves . .. 
I did end up listening to everyone and using Hellman's original mayonnaise.  The first time I made this using Kraft Olive oil mayo and hated it, but I also followed all the other ingredients, so, who knows how much the mayo plays into the equation.
Here's what I ended up doing:
1 cup Hellman's original Mayo
1/4 tsp garlic powder
2 TBSP rice wine vinegar
1 tsp paprika
1.5 tbsp melted butter
Dash cayenne pepper
2 tsp honey (I try to avoid refined sugar when at all possible)

I felt this had a great kick, was thin enough to pour, and wasn't syrupy at all.

I doubled the tomato paste and sugar--then it was perfect. Without, it tasted too much like flavored mayo. But with the changes, it was just what I was looking for.

It is amazing , I did the blind taste test with the stuff from the local Japanese steakhouse and mine from the recipe. My 2 adult kids chose mine over the restaurant . Although I did add just a touch more sugar and definetly let it sit overnight for the flavors to marry . Will make this again but doubled .

As it is, 3 stars. Too much mayo flavor.  Double the spices, add a splash of rice wine vinegar and it's 5 stars.

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted good but I felt something was different. I went to our local Japanese restaurant and bought the sauce and compared it. What I bought was sweeter. This round I added  1 Tablespoon of sugar instead of  1 teaspoon and it was spot on - DELICIOUS!!!

This recipe was quick and easy to follow. Tastes just like the sauce in the restaurant. Definitely let it set overnight so the flavors can open up. Also, let it come back to room temperature before serving so you get the full flavor.

Really good "close second" to high end sushi restaurants. Tad garlicky but otherwise exceptional.

I thought this recipe was really close but missing one thing...I added about 1/2 tsp lemon juice and thought it made a huge improvement!  So yummy!

When I didn't have tomato paste, I substituted the same amount of ketchup and it worked just fine. My husband and brother love this and have to have it every time I cook chicken.

Yum-Yum! I have nothing to compare this to as I don't think I've ever had Yum Yum sauce, but I made a recipe that called for it as a condiment. I made it as directed (used Hellman's) and let it sit overnight. It was delicious with our meal, which was Asian Chicken Meatball Lettuce Wraps. Would make again.

Really good. I made this with homemade mayo and honey instead of sugar. By itself, the flavor is meh, but actually on food it's pretty darn tasty.

This is exactly like the recipe we get at our local Hibachi restaurant. Now, with this recipe, we've mastered Japanese Fried Rice.

Yummy! This is a nice sauce that can be tweaked to suit your taste. I am serving it tomorrow night for a little NYE gathering with bacon wrapped shrimp and pineapple appetizers. I added Sriracha sauce, and pretty much doubled all the dry ingredients. I think everyone will love it! THANK YOU!

As someone who used to run an Asian restaurant, I  can tell you we never put anything tomato based in our yum Yum Sauce. Other than that, everything else is right.

This is very close to what I'm use to. I added a little ginger and added honey.  I had my little girl taste it and asked her if it reminded her of anything. She said yeah it taste just like what we ate Saturday night at the flame place on the rice...Flame place being The Hibachi grill. Great and thanks for sharing, we love it.

This tasted great!  I halved the recipe and made it for fried fish, so I added 1 T of relish, 2 T of minced sweet onion and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and then I had a wonderful tartar sauce!

This very good! Especially good with fish and chicken.  I only refrigerated my sauce for about an hour and it was great with my grilled salmon. Thank You!
