Loved this! I can only do chocolate in small does (allergic) and this was the perfect bite for me. Super simple, creamy, and downright delicious!  I typically send stuff like this with the hubs to share at work but not these. They hold great in the fridge and I will eat them all myself ...one piece at a time. Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing sweet girl!

These are great! We made them a little smaller but otherwise followed the recipe and they're a hit!
