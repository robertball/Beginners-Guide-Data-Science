OK, I made this and my husband made me make it again the next day. It was that good. Here's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.. the time! I used the vidalia onion chopper to save time and it still took almost an hour to make. I'd love to get this flavor in a 15 min recipe.  I only used 2 jalapeno peppers instead of the 3.  Also, thought it was odd to have such fresh ingredients and then add the one can of tomato & chillies...

I followed this almost to a tee, right up until it was time to add the can of tomatos/chilis.  I decided to omit to stay with a truly fresh salsa, and it was wonderful!  The lemon/lime juice gave it a tangy flavor and the cumin added a nice zip.  I chopped each of the veggies SEPARATELY in a food processor to obtain the desired consistency for each ingredient and added it all to a bowl.  The end result was a very coarse salsa that did not have a whole lot of liquid and I was pleasantly surprised.  This was my first time using/tasting jimaca and it added a nice crunch.  I made this for the heck of it this afternoon, had several friends stop by unexpectedly and it was gone in a short time.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I served, but they loved it and I will make this recipe again (minus the Rotel!) after my next jalopeno harvest from the garden!  Give it a try!!!!

This salsa is awesome.  The fresh cilantro is to die for, and the jicama really does make the difference.  I will make this over and over as it is easy and wonderful.  THANKS for the great recipe!

This is without a doubt the best salsa I've ever had. I've made it a half a dozen times just since Super Bowl  2 months ago -  it just disappears!  Easy to make & the jicama really adds a great flavor. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

I made this via the original recipe and then made a few of my own changes.  It was much better using just 1 jalapeno, no jicama, and using sweet onion instead of red onion.  (It was still "warm" enough for my husband, but not too "hot" for me.)  I have substituted regular tomatoes (de-seeded) for the romas and it turned out great as well.  I usually just seed the jalapeno then throw everything in the food processor together instead of cutting everything up to save time.

Very good, sweet & flavorful.  I think I may leave some jalapeno seeds in next time to make it a little spicier.  Added a can of black beans and kernel corn (both rinsed) and did not use jicama.

This recipe was great! We followed directions as written, and we chopped all of our own ingredients, and it only took about 15 minutes to put together. The next day it is even better! Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe

I was looking for a recipe for fresh salsa and this one was as close to fresh as I could get. however, I didnt add the canned tomato so as to keep it fresher, just added more fresh tomatoes. I also didn't have the jimaca but this recipe was delicious without it. can't wait to try it next time with the jimaca! thanks for sharing!

Good salsa. I give it 4 stars because I consider my husbands input, & I couldn't give it 4 & 1/2. I used everything from our garden, so i left out cilantro (my husband doesn't like) & jicama (we didn't grow that). I decreased the amount of cumin to 1/2 tsp. We both thought that the cumin was a little over powering. I also decreased the amount of lemon juice to less than 1 tbsp. Without all the cumin, it seemed to make the salsa more tangy than preferred. Since I omitted the can of green chile & tomato, I used more tomato and a fresh pepper from the garden as well. After these changes, my husband really liked it. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe! I didn't change anything about it and it was so yummy! I shared with my in-laws and they loved it too!! It was a little hot so If you dont like that I would do less peppers.

I made this for a picnic and everyone devoured it. They said they couldn't go back to jarred salsa and requested for the recipe. If you have an food chopper or processor, it cuts the prep time tremendously. Also, scooping out the tomato seeds and adding the jicama makes the salsa not so watery.

So yummy! I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit! Mine didn't look as soupy as the picture. More chunky looking.

I absolutely love this recipe and reach for it often, especially when vegetables in our garden are ready!  Made it just as stated and love the incredible fresh taste it has.  The jicama really makes the difference. If there is any leftover, it is great in an omlette the next morning!  Thank you for sharing!

I used this recipe for a labor day party with fresh tomatoes from the garden. EXCELLENT! Everyone commented on it. I didn't have fresh jalapenos on hand - used them out of the can. Still amazing!

I'm pretty set in my ways on how I make my salsa, but I saw this recipe a week ago and it's been on my mind since!!  Today the husband and I went grocery shopping and decided to grab the ingrediants for this.  I was a little hesitant at first because I have never had a jimaca before.  The only thing I changed was I added everything in a blender on "chop" setting to keep the thickness of it.  I took a chip and slowly dipped it in and WOW!!  Very glad I gave this recipe a try!

This salsa was OK but not my favorite.  This is more of a garden salsa than a spicy, vinegar salsa.  I did make some changes though, so that could be the reason I wasn't a big fan.  I was lazy the day I made it so I just tossed everything in a food processor and blended.  Obviously the salsa turned out more thin than chunky by doing it that way.  The salsa itself really didn't have any pizazz for me but I had 2 avocados I had to use up so I took half the recipe and bended it together with the avocados to make a sorta guacamole and now that was GOOOOD!  I had to add a bit more salt but once I turned it into Guac, I couldn't stop eating it.  I ran out of chips and was temped to just eat it with a spoon.  I will use this as a "base" for guacamole again for sure and I may try making it again as written to see if it was chunkier if I'd like it better.

Tasty, fresh, and easy recipe. I had never tried jicama before, but had heard about it and was ready to give it a try. I think the crunch and slight sweetness of the jicama went very well with the salsa. I left out the cilantro because I'm really not a fan of the stuff, and the salsa still had plenty of flavor and went great with the tacos I was having. I will definitely make this again, maybe not so much of it the next time though unless I'm having company.

I thought it turned out well. Took quite some time to do the chopping but it was worth the effort. I seeded all the tomatoes so it wouldn't turn out watery and used an extra 2. All in all it was good. The jicama was the perfect touch

It was very good, except I felt like it was missing something.  I had to use dried cilantro, because it's all I had on-hand.  If I try it again, I will definitely use the fresh cilantro.

Very simple and delicious fresh salsa recipe.  I love canned cheats, and Ro-tel is one of my favorites.  I added a little balsamic vinegar to the tomatoes (less than a teaspoon).  This is my husband's new favorite!

This one is going in my recipe box.  I had all the ingredients except jicama, but I had a baby zucchini that added some crunch and texture.  I did drain my big red tomatoes while I cut up the other ingredients, and I think that helped keep the salsa from getting  too watery.  If you are concerned about that, use a can of tomato paste instead of the canned tomatoes.  My husband gobbled it up on crusty fresh bread like bruschetta.  Good thing I made extra!

Easy and very good. As with many other reviewers I deleted the canned tomatoes and jicama. Added a few more tomatoes and kept seeds in a few of the jalapeños .

I just love a reason to use JICAMA in a recipe, it is such a conversational food item for company.  This salsa was extremely good.  The grocery store was out of cilantro, so I used dried  instead but I bet the fresh would have put it over the top for us.  Will definitely use fresh cilantro the next time.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! It was so healthy and full of flavor! I left out the can diced tomatoes with green chilies and jalapeno peppers because I'm not a big fan of them and it was still amazing. I also bought the red onions pre-cut to save some time. I brought some in for the girls at work and they fell in love with it as did I! I will surely be making it again and again and again! All the cutting was time consuming but it was so worth it.

Wonderful! Left out the jicama, due to lack of availability. Left out green onions and lime juice for simplicity's sake. It was really flavorful and my guests and I enjoyed every bite! :) Thank you for sharing!

This was great. I added a few tablespoons of sugar and changed up the veggies a bit. I spooned it onto fajitas at dinner and served it as an appetizer. Awesome!

The only change I made was to use 1 large jalapino, and while it was not super hot it had some heat, which is what I was going for. Aside from the temperature, both my husband and I consider it to be "satisfactory". Nothing exciting here, but not bad either. It really just seems like something is missing. Sadly, We haven't figured out what.
