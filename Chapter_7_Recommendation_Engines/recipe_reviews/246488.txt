My first foray into Moroccan cuisine.  I cooked it in a tagine and it turned out beautifully.  I used my homemade preserved lemons as well.  The mix of flavors from the olives, artichokes and lemon and the beauty of the turmeric make for a lovely dish.

Absolutely delicious.  I would recommend this to everyone who wants a relaxing meal.  Prepare everything the night before, put it together the following morning, in the pot, cook long and slow, sit back and when you're ready, enjoy.  Worth every star awarded.

This was delicious! I make a few changes, however.  I used the zest of 1 lemon and placed fresh lemon slices on the chicken because I could not find preserved lemon.  I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts and chicken broth instead of water.  Be careful!  My sauce burned very badly. Maybe because I used chicken broth instead of water or maybe the hear was too high.  The optional garnishs of olives, parsley, and artichokes really make this dish.  Delicious when served with saffron rice.  Thank you!

This is a fragrant dish that I cooked in my tagine at 190°C. I didn't have any artichokes so I used bell peppers. The olives are a great addition. Thank you for the recipe.

Yummy!  This was fantastic!  Whole family loved it.  Kids aren’t fond of olives but tried them & still loved it!  Served with basmati rice (cause that’s what I had) and green beans.  My husband and I are trying to eat healthier so I did go with skinless, boneless thighs.  So affordable and flavor is complex.  This is a new staple.

Wow, this was really good. Chicken could have marinated overnight. I doubled the amount of preserved lemons and it was not too lemony. Next time I’ll remove the chicken skin because it doesn’t brown up enough to be crispy. I would also use Greek olives or similar string favored olives

Amazing flavor!  Definitely making this again. I was inspired by Anthony Bourdain's show about Morocco to make preserved lemons and Moroccan dishes and this recipe was perfect! I added red peppers during the 20 min cooking part and the artichoke hearts along with the saffron and lemons during the last five minutes. Also added corn starch to the sauce while reducing to thicken it up nicely. My family loved it served white basmati rice.
