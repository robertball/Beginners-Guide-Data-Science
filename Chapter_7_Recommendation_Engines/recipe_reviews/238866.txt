I cooked for dinner and to be honest my expectations weren't high because my cooking skills are really terrible. However, it was absolutely delicious. Even my husband loved it. Easy quick recipe!!!

Pretty good, but it didn't taste quite as I hoped (having eaten Pho out). The noodles could sit in the hot water a few minutes longer, and - if you can tolerate it - you should double the hot sauce. And don't omit the tofu! I forgot it and this dish needs it. If I'd done all that I think it would've been perfect!
