Delicious chicken recipe! I Only changed it a tiny bit. I  didn't have any thyme, so I just left it out, but I added minced garlic to the marinade, and stuffed the chicken with half a lemon, half an onion, and a few garlic cloves before tying the legs together. I also added 3 cut up russet potatoes to the bottom of the pan, to cook with the chicken, and then stirred them every time I took the chicken out. The potatoes were absolutely delicious! They soaked up everything that was good about the chicken marinade and came out a little tangy and super savory. Next time I'll have to adjust the cooking time, though, the chicken was just a tad too pink after we cut it open.

This recipe was a hit with me & my family. Next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will roast the chicken at a higher temp so it will brown better. I used fresh rosemary and thyme which gave the chicken great flavor. The wilted romaine salad under it was very good also.

I have made this recipe a few times. Both as written and with my own additions. My family prefers double the cumin and cayenne, an addition of garlic along with the spices, and a bit of cream when reducing the sauce. I always use fresh herbs (use dry to fresh conversions), and fresh ground peppers and cumin.

Made this recipe with a pre-cut up chicken.  Really tasty, though it didn't seem necessary to add the chicken broth--had plenty of juice/sauce.  I think the addition of a little garlic might be nice.  There are a number of steps, so plan ahead as far as time goes!

Loved it, and for those of you who have a convection oven and have never learned to use it (if there are any of you!) by all means learn to use the convection ROAST feature.  The chicken will come out perfectly browned and picture perfect!

Delicious! Made it for dinner tonight and it was a huge hit. The only thing I changed is that I didn't use rosemary as the family doesn't like it and I used garlic powder instead.  The chicken was moist, tender and juicy and the lemon flavor was right on!  Thanks Chef John!

It wasn't black. After cooking for  95 min. it was still pink. Sorry but maybe my stainless steel pan was at fault.

I made this with chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken so I had to modify it some but overall the taste was amazing and the entire family loved the taste of the chicken!

This is a wonderful dish and works well with bone in skinless chicken parts rather than whole chicken.

I usually don't bother to watch the videos, I just read the recipe and go from there.  This time I spent the 3 or 4 minutes to watch the video and read the recipe.  It was definitely worth it.  Very good recipe and very good video.

Delicious!  I made this recipe with chicken pieces (skin on breast & thighs) instead of a whole chicken and it was divine. I did add minced garlic to the recipe and cooked it at bit a higher temperature to brown the chicken. I brought this dish to a pot luck dinner and it got rave reviews.

very very delicious.  One tip, go light on the greens, the lemon can easily become overwhelming.

I have made this twice. Both times it came out so juicy and tasty. Not a single person has passed it up. I just don't know why it has black in its name, it is not black.
