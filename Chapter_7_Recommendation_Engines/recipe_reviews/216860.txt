I thought it was really good. Just reading the recipe sounds bland. I added sauteed zucchini onions spinach mushrooms fresh chopped garlic pinch of parsley salt and pepper. My husband doesn't eat meat so I used 5 pieces of Quorn's vegetarian chicken instead and I used the garlic flavored cooking creme instead of plain and whole grain farfalle. Parmesean cheese on top. When I boiled my pasta I added in a little bit of vinegar in the water to give the pasta a slight tang to the overall taste. With garlic bread on the side.

it was a very good dinner easy to make. we tweaked the recipe and used the garlic cooking creme and added fresh garlic to the recipe. also salt and pepper was added throughout the cooking process. it tastes even better that way. adding mushrooms and other vegetables makes it look better and also adds more flavours. you don't need to follow a recipe verbatim; mix it up some and added your own spices to give it a more textured taste.

This was just edible really. As another reviewer said it is pretty bland. If I try it again it's because of how easy it was to do but I would definitely add some fresh bell pepper and maybe onions while cooking the chicken. I think the cooking cream has potential (after all cream cheese makes everything good) but this recipe seems to have been oversimplified to prove a point by the company. Just needs more ingredients!

The cream was too abundant and lacked flavor. This recipe needs some more vegetables or seasonings to make it worth while. I don't think I will be making this again. The taste and consistency of the cream left a lot to be desired.

I made this last night and my husband and I LOVED it! I took other reviewers suggestions and used the Italian herb cooking creme (I had to ask where to find it... it was by the butter in my store). I added both black pepper and dried red pepper which ended up being a bit too much. I sliced up the tomatoes to make more bite size and added some minced garlic as well. Except for being too peppery it was great... lots of flavor and the creamy sauce was the perfect amount. I'll definitely make it again.

It was good but kinda bland. From the wonderful smells coming from the pan as it cooked my friends and I expected something very flavorful we were disappointed.

This was an incredible dish. The only thing I did differently is besides the regular cooking cream that the recipe calls for I also threw in about 5 tablespoons of philly's cream cheese with garlic and onion & it was great

My hubby just made this tonight and I had high hopes but it really was pretty bland. I added a little parm cheese to mine and some fresh black pepper and that did make it a little better. Next time (if there is one) we'll use more spices and veggies in it.

While the recipe sounds great I agree with many of the others that reviewed this recipe. The original recipe is pretty bland. I chose to use the Italian Cheese and Herb cooking creme and that gave it a little more flavor. I also added some onion powder and a dash of red pepper. This is a really quick and easy weeknight dinner. I like the idea that someone listed of adding zuchini. I think that would be a great match or even some tri-colored bell peppers. Yum.

Tastes good but could hardly be called a bruschetta. Obviously the cook here has never seen a real bruschetta and I'm insulted as an Italian that he or she would attribute this dish to the wonderful bruschetta appetizers which have zero to do with pasta. It should be called pasta with a creamy chicken sauce.

This is the best pasta recipe! My fianc√© would eat it all to himself if I weren't eating with him as well! One of my absolute favourite recipes as is. I have also made it substituting the tomatoes with store boughten bruschetta and herb and garlic cream cheese... Absolutely amazing!

This is AAAAAAllllmmost alfredo..... minus nutmeg pepper and parm cheese. I wouldn't make this recipe unless your really trying to cut the calories. Alfredo would have you medium heat boil the cream for 2 minutes then add parm cheese to the cream until melted in and thickened. Just sprinkle in a little nutmeg and black pepper to taste and your golden. Also please use garlic with your chicken as your cook it.

The fact that the entire meal can be prepared in less than 30 minutes and was a crowd pleaser makes this a meal that will become a regular in my rotation. Add some mushrooms or fresh spinach to mix it up!
