I loved this recipe.  I made it after the 2 cups of sugar were added.  I did find that the batter was very thick and hard to spread.  I also had to let cook for about 10 additional minutes.  From the moment I took my first bite, I couldn't get enough.  I think this is the most delicious apple cake recipe I have ever made or tasted.  I have made it for pot lucks, teacher luncheons, a home dessert, and it always gets rave reviews.

I was so impressed with the ingredients in this recipe I had to try it in spite of the poor reviews.  I not only added the 2 cups of sugar, but also 3/4 cup of milk.  It turned out very good.  My family really enjoyed it and I will make it again, with the revisions of course.

This was an excellant recipe.  I won a Blue Ribbon with it at our fair.  Not only a blue ribbon but Grand Champion in the cake division.  My family and friends really like this cake.  They can't wait for me to make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe before the 2 cups of sugar was added to the recipe.  I wondered why there was no sugar!!  It did not come out very well without it!!  Also, the "batter" was more like dough - it did not pour into the pan!  I do not think I will try again, even with the sugar!

Layering the apples caused my cake to be too heavy and stick to the Bundt pan. The cake split in two as I flipped it over. Also, layering the apples created layers of mush. If I make this again, I would integrate the apples.

This cake was not worth the effort.  Batter was like bread dough and very hard to spread in pan.  Cake did not rise properly and consistency was very heavy.  Ended up throwing it away.  Do not bother!!

Yummy!  Lots of people tried this one and I had great reviews.  I couldn't find the cinnamon chips so I just used regular chocolate chips (and some white choc. chips too) and then put cinnamon on the apples.  I also used 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 applesauce.  Moist and delicious!

Liked this one alot. I substituted white choc. chips for the cinnaomon ones listed - I couldnt find cinnamon ones. I mixed cinnamon spice (a few teaspoons) in with apples to flavor.

Absolutely delicious, the topping got a little crust to it  which made it hard to cut, it was very soft on the inside..I think mayble the next time I will incorporate apples in the batter rather than layering. One more thing, it did not look like the picture at all..Walnuts did not rise to the top and it looks like the put an icing on top..However, the taste was wonderful. I did not alter the recipe at all.

This isn't my favorite apple cake recipe but I thought it was pretty good.  I followed the recipe as it was written.  I made a maple/cinnamon glaze and put on it and it really made the cake.

The reviews seem to be all over the place with this recipe so I used a Â¼  size bundt pan to make a trial run of this recipe.  I think because of the smaller size, the apples made a distinct line in the cake, and as usual for me, I always add more apple than the recipe called for.    Also, I only made one layer of apples because of the size of the pan. The next time I will stir the apples into the batter.  Baking time was reduced to 30 minutes.  Also, I had no cinnamon chips so I dusted the chopped apple with cinnamon.  This worked out very well.   This will make a wonderful accompaniment with your morning coffee.
