I used feta rather than blue cheese ... personal preference. Also, I would toast and possibly candy the hazelnuts before adding. The dressing is so tart (and I love tart things) that it can come across as "one note." It needs a drizzle of honey or candied nuts.

Made this for a prime rib dinner I followed others suggestion and used honey, feta and walnuts!   It was very refreshing.  Used the honey to take off the edge of the lime.

I substituted walnuts and feta cheese in this recipe.  I added 3 tablespoons of honey and 1 cup of dried cranberries as I felt the taste needed some added sweetness to balance the savory. I recommend using a food processor or blender on shred setting  to speed up the shredding of the Brussels sprouts (Recipe takes one hour if you use a hand grater.)  Looks very pretty with the green and red colors.

Great flavor.  Light and crunchy. Used as side dish in conjunction with Beef Wellington. Only thing I would do differently is would make 1 and 1/2 times the dressing.   Felt the sprout mixture could be more wet.  Definite keeper.

What a wonderful salad! I used Parmigiano Reggiano instead of bleu cheese as suggested in the notes. A very interesting mix of flavours and textures. Thank you for the recipe.
