I've made this several times and here is what I've learned.  This tastes better the next day.  Make sure the onions you use aren't too large, otherwise the onion can overpower everything else.  Don't skimp on the cilantro, it really adds flavor.  I think less onion, and more cucumbers and radishes is a good idea.  Also -- don't wimp out and use squeeze lemon juice.  The real thing is so much better.  Also, if you are going to make this a lot, invest $20 in one of those Vidalia Onion Chopper thingies.  It cuts your prep time in half -- at least.  Plus, the thing is just fun to use.  Point it away from you when chopping tomatoes though, otherwise you will look like an axe murderer.

Loved this recipe and ceviche however I did make a few changes per my hubby's suggestions. (I am sure it is delicious as is but wanted to make the hubby happy!) For 8 servings I used 2 lbs. of cleaned and peeled medium size shrimp which I cut into 4 pieces. Due to more shrimp, I didn't have enough lemon juice to cover them so I added a half squirt bottle of lime juice. I used tomato/shrimp cocktail juice (instead of the tomato and clam juice) I omitted the radishes and used one large white onion and one large jalapeno. Since my hubby needs his spicy;but not super hot, I added a bit of sea salt and 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper and a tsp. of garlic granules. My neighbor always makes ceviche but hers is very basic and her shrimp are always kind of raw so I would pick them out and microwave them for a minute. The lemon/lime juice does a great job of cooking the shrimp pieces but I left them soaking in it for 3 hours before adding other ingredients. YUMMY!!!! Thanks!!!

I cut the recipe down to 2 servings & I did decide to give my shrimp a rough chop. Like Caroline C. I added lime juice as well as lemon. I thickened it up a bit by giving it a squeeze of tomato paste & I added a tbp. or so of tequila. You couldn't really taste the tequila... it just tasted a bit richer & more complex. I served this in martini glasses rimmed w/ kosher salt (mostly for visual appeal) & lined w/ tortilla chips. Loved it...thanks!

I've made this ceviche a couple of times & got many compliments.  I made the original & it was good.  But the next times, I ommited the radishes & added 2 limes & 1 avacado. We love avacado! lol.  I also didn't use jumbo shrimp to make it more tortilla friendly.  The way we eat ceviche is, I toast whole tortillas in some oil & then, after they've cooled, spread some mayo in the tortilla, top it with ceviche & munch away. It's great!  :)

I knew this would be too spicy for me, but it was spot-on for Husband. I pretty much just eyeballed the ingredients, and I also added the juice of two small limes (you can't have ceviche without lime juice, imo). He thoroughly enjoyed it. Thanks so much!

i would recommend leaving it in the frig for about three hours or more, blend garlic, serrano peppers with lime juice, add the radishes, tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro, onions after the shrimp or fish is cooked through and garnish with avocados eat with tostadas and add some valentina hot sauce

It was 100 degrees out and I was looking for a dish that wouldn't require my turning any heating element on. I found this ceviche recipe and, having never attempted making this, I have to say I was a bit nervous about it. OMG! This was the BEST ceviche I have ever had, hands down! We did substitute mahi mahi for the whitefish but otherwise we followed the recipe as was directed. I could live on this stuff. Healthy, low calorie and flavorful...what's better? Thanks for the excellent recipe. I have it laminated on my fridge and anticipate making it often throughout the hot summer months.

This was Awesome! It did take quite a bit longer to turn the shrimp opaque then was written. My shrimp weren't that big and I marinated them overnight to get them "cooked" in the lemon/lime juice, They were worth the wait tho! Yum Even the MIL liked them,  now That is saying something! Thanks for the great dish PhxGurl.

in every mexican restaurant they add some buffalo sauce and ketchup. the ketchup is pretty important and it needed more tomatoes. the radishes, cucumber, and garlic not so important (my mexican family members never put it on theirs)  but the cocktail sauce is. the way we eat it is with saltine crackers sooo much better

OMIGOD!  This Ceviche reminded me of the Ceviche that I get at really good Mexican Restaurants (Cha Cha Cha's is one of them)  SOOO Good.  I did make a couple adjustments, I added some lime juice instead of all lemon, I only used 1 red onion (I am not a big raw onion fan and the hubby likes Red not white) and I added Avocado because we LOVE avocado.  Got most of this advice from the reviews.  It turned out AMAZING!!  Can't wait to try it with Scallops and other sea food!

Amazing! It was huge hit and loved by all! I did make a few changes. First off I recommend serving the next day. Also I only use 1 large onion. It can become overpowering if you use too much. Also only use 1.5 jalapenos especially since they get hotter over time. Overall, phenomenal dish!

I have chronc high blood pressure and am on a constant voyage to find recipes with very low sodium content -this is a great very healthful recipe.  The citrus was a bit too - well citrusy, I think because I did not add enough tomato juice (sodium thing).  My husband loved it.  I served this in tortilla bowls made from whole grain tortillas baked with some olive oil over an upside down bowl.  Oh - and toped with some avacados.  Very fresh and healthy tasting - I have a feeling it will better tomorrow.

The sitting time definitely needs to be extended and to make it authentic you should also be adding little chunks of avocado. Otherwise it was a great recipe.

I am super picky and altered this recipe quite a bit but followed the 5 large lemons, shrimp, cilantro (basically one bunch of it), 2 white onions, 1 cucumber, 2 cloves garlic.  I added 8 roma tomatoes, 5 limes (to go with the lemon in the beginning to "cook" the shrimp") and green onions as well.  It was very refreshing and all natural flavors that way. Wanted to do it with jalapenos but the ones at the store did not look good. It was delicious!

Great recipe. I take out the garlic and add cumin, salt and white pepper to taste.  Use already cooked shrimp if in a rush. Top tortillas with ceviche and  ketchup (it makes a big difference).

I used jumbo shrimp and they took a lot longer than 30 minutes to turn opaque, so I definitely recommend rough chopping if you're using big shrimp.  I added lime juice too.

Tasted so good, but it took a long time to make.  Lots of chopping!!!  Totally worth the effort.

This recipe was good but, I think next time I’ll try half lemon/half lime juice. I would also like to try using avocado instead of cucumber.

Totally an easy recipe to make!
The closest recipe to the authentic way of making it "estilo mexicano"!(mexican style)
The only thing I did different was put the radish on the side, because I am not a great fan of them.
