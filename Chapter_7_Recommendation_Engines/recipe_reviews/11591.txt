I'll bet you didn't know you were a hero and saved my life...or at least $40 worth of glazed fruit, nuts and other ingredients.  I made an "Easy, Light" fruitcake recipe in a 20 qt stock pot. Scaled to 10 cups flour, 1 lb buter etc.  The only thing they were good for was weighing down a body thrown overboard.  I salvaged the fruit and nuts  by 'squishing' the bricks in warm water and used them in YOUR recipe.   HEAVEN!!!  They were WONDERFUL!!  I can't thank you enough.. I even substituted burgandy for whiskey in the second batch because I ran out, and they were still great.  Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

I HATE FRUITCAKE!!!!! But these cookies are absolutely delicious! I used green candied cherries and candied pineapple and soaked them in whiskey along with the raisins for about an hour. I also toasted the pecans before baking. I only baked half of the batch and served the cookies at Christmas dinner. A few days later,by popular demand,I was baking the rest of the batch. These cookies are so moist and chewy. They have become a permenant part of my holiday baking.

This was an excellent recipe!  I substituted 1/2 cup of jamacian rum instead of whiskey, a 450gram container of fruit glace instead of cherries, and a cup of coconut soaked with the rum instead of pecans.  My whole house smells great and the cookies are yummy, even though I overcooked the first batch a little crispy!

This was disgusting. A waste of expensive ingredients. I followed it to a tee and really wanted it to work because it sounded good and I actually like these flavors. But they were akward and seemed to need more of a foundation for all the "heavy" ingredients.

this is a great recipe! If you are looking for more rum flavoring try soaking the nuts too!

Wow! This is a wonderful recipe; and has been a big hit in my family (even for those who are disgusted by fruitcake). Though, instead of the red and green candied cherries, I used a candied fruit mix because that's what my husband brought home from the store (candied fruit isn't the easiest thing to find, afterall). Thanks for the great recipe!

Mixed batch on this one; they were like fruit cake in a cookie form. Some people liked them; others not. I thought they were good. Could not find the candied cherries ANY WHERE! I think they are a seasonal thing. One of my friends had some in her pantry from the holidays; so I got them from her.

My husband has been hankering after a fruit cake, but I wanted to try a fruitcake-ish cookie recipe for portion control.  (Ha!)  I didn't use the candied fruit; I used raisins and cranberries and a little chopped apricots.  The batter seemed wet (probably because I oversoftened the butter), so I tossed in a wee bit of Irish oats (to go with the Irish whiskey) for body, and the result is a very tasty cookie that isn't overboard one way or the other.  Fans of oatmeal raisin cookies would probably like this recipe if willing to try it.

The reviews here seem pretty mixed; either they love them or they hate them. If you don't like the after-taste of whiskey, you're not going to like these. Also, fresh ingredients are very important. I, and everyone in my family, loves these little gems! Soft, moist and flavorful with various textures.

This is a great Christmas cookie.  I like all the candied cherries, nuts and raisins.  My Mom made fruitcake every Christmas which explains why I like this cookie.

I am re-reviewing this recipe as I needed to make them again.  I followed the recipe exactly except somehow all of the "Jack Daniels" at my house went missing.  I searched through the liquor cabinet and the only rum I had was a bottle of hot cinnamon rum and it did not sound like it would work.  I had some brandy, Seagrams 7 and Crown Royal (but not enough of any of them to use without mixing).  I sniffed everything I had left and settled on Southern Comfort.  I soaked the raisins as directed and proceeded with making the cookies.  I cannot believe I like them better.  Since I am taking them to a wake, I am calling them "Comfort Cookies".
