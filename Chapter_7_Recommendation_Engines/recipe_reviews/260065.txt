Admittedly this is not a rating of the recipe so much as a response to it. But it gets a 5 star because you can totally make a great lasagna in an Instant Pot. Based on the other reviewer and my own thoughts, I did use marinara instead of tomato sauce and I added 2 tsp Italian seasoning to the meat as it cooked. I used ricotta instead of goat cheese and added an egg to the cheese ( also some Romano cheese). I didn't have fresh spinach so I used thawed, frozen spinach which I mixed with the ricotta cheese. But...back to my rating. I am the first to admit that I have never made more than a passable lasagna until now. This was the best lasagna I've ever made. The texture was spot on. Soft, but firm and not at all sloppy gloppy. The only thing I will try differently the next time I make it will be to use 1/2 lb ground meat and 1/2 lb crumbled sausage.

I love my Instant Pot, didnâ€™t care for this at all. Very lackluster- there are some really great IP lasagna recipes out there. Give this one a pass.

Really enjoyed this lasagna. Even enjoyed making it too. I'm on the road for 340 days of the year. It was a nice end to my day of driving. I didn't change a thing. I won't in the future either. Very nice.

I gave this a 5 star as much for the method as well as the recipe itself.
Seasonings are subjective and a personal preference, so I add what I like as should everyone without giving it a negative rating because you felt like adding something.  I'll be making this one over and over since we are a retired couple making this amount is perfect!

I made mine in a round oven proof bowl.   I used a separate to brown meat.   Drained and rinsed meat with filtered water to remove any fats.   I then mixed a  1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning  into the browned meat.
I used extra mozzarella, ricotta, cottage cheese, spinach.  I made a foil sling to lower bowl in pot on top of the trivet. 
After the instant pot,  I made sure I had a full layer of mozzarella on top and broiled 5 to 8 minutes.  I cut into wedges and scooped out pieces of it.      Delicious.   Next time I'll try pre making and then freeze it.

This is the easiest lasagna I have ever made!  I love lasagna, but I always hated making it in the oven.  I tried it in the slow cooker once and that turned out horribly.  The oven-baked version is so expensive, time consuming and there are so many leftovers that we get tired of lasagna.  The only changes I made to the recipe was using Italian sausage instead of plain ground beef and using ricotta cheese in place of goat cheese.  It was still delicious!  I will definitely be making this lasagna again!

We loved this!  E-Z, and delicious.  The tangy goat cheese was perfect.  The noodles were a bit under done, so here are my subtle changes:
Cook 30 minutes. Also, mix 1 1/2 c pasta sauce (spicy Arrabiata) with browned meat. Use additional sauce on each layer. Full 5 or 6 ounce bag of baby spinach, coarsely chopped. Broil 4 minutes.  Definitely making this again.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was DELICIOUS!   I made a couple changes to suit our palate,  I used ground beef and spicy Italian sausage, I did not use spinach,  and I substituted ricotta cheese for the goat cheese.  It was amazing,  we'll definatly make this one again.

This was pretty good but to me, didn't taste like lasagna. It was definitely Italian and it was tasty so 4 stars.  I will make this again for sure.
