Excellent! The brie cheese tastes soft and creamy. I forgot to add the dijon mustard, and I had to substitute milk instead of heavy cream (I did not have it either). It still came out excellent.

Fluffy inside, with lots of flavor! I added one more egg for a total of 4 eggs. I also couldn't find brie slices at my grocery store, so I spread mustard and spreadable Brie cheese on the bottom of the pie crust. I've made this twice now, and is a favorite in our house.
