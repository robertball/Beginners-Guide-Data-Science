This was good!  I sauted the zucchini and onion in olive oil instead of boiling, due to personal preference.  We'll make this again.

You have to try this casserole! This was the best casserole I've ever made! I was surprised at how good it turned out..it was great re-heated too! It is really good with fresh french bread and spring salad. I have made it every week so far. Thanks Judy!

This was good. There was too much zucchini (yes, I know it's a zucchini casserole!) and it kind of overpowered all the other ingredients. But I wanted to use up a lot of the zucchini we were given, so I tried it! I used maybe 3/8 cup of onion, two huge honkin' zucchini, and I chopped up 8 or 9 baby carrots instead of using grated. I diced up a stalk of celery and boiled it with the other veggies (including the carrots). I used margarine instead of butter and half low-fat/half regular sour cream. I added one can of drained, flaked chicken and I was really glad I did - next time, I might cook and chop up a chicken breast to add to the mix. I would not want this all the time, but it was a nice change in the casserole world. :) I really enjoyed the stuffing part: yummy and soggy on the bottom, yummy and crunchy on top. Next time, I might double the stuffing. Thanks, Judy!

This recipe is always a hit with my family.  I have started adding cubed chicken to it for a one dish complete meal.  It is now being requested when I attend functions.

My family loved this, even my 4 year old.  I didn't have a full 2 lbs. of squash, so I added red pepper and some frozen corn.  I also added a can of chicken breast and some jack cheese.  Rather than boil the veggies, I sauteed them in some olive oil and butter and added some salt, pepper, cumin and garlic.  Also, I only used half a stick of butter and added some chicken broth to the stuffing mix.  It was a really nice comfort food dinner with roasted beets and a salad on the side.

This recipe has great potential! My family likes a little more "kick" so I added diced red pepper, garlic, sliced mushrooms and 1/2 cup ricotta cheese. another good way to utilize an abundance of summer squash!

Added shredded chicken and had no onions.  Used Stove Top stuffing mix, and made it according to package directions.  Will make again and add more veggies and NOT skip the onions.  Very yummy and don't forget to grab a can of cranberry sauce!

Great recipe.  I changed a few things in mine: Cream of Mushroom soup and I added cut-up chicken tenders.  I also substitued chopped garlic for the onion.  Nice blend of flavors, but my grandson didn't care for the garlic, mushroom soup, zucchini or sour cream.  We loved it.  He ate Ramen Soup.

This casserole is awesome!  My 2 year old loves it too - which is a MIRACLE!  I added a littel cheddar cheese to the mix, which was very yummy too.  Great recipe, and a fantastic way to get little ones to eat their veggies.

This recipe was excellent!  My husband has been asking me to try and make a couple of dishes that he fondly remembers from his childhood and this is one of them.  He said I got this one exactly right.  The only thing I changed was I used cream of celery soup because that was all I had on hand.  Thanks Judy B!

Although grandma never made this dish, it tastes like something she would.  My girlfried is a vegetarian so I sub cream of mushroom.  I've used half zuch and half yellow squash with great results.I also saute instead of boil and add garlic and crushed red pepper to the pan.  I've made it about four times this season so I'd say it's a winner.

I've made this casserole so many times and it's always so good! I modify by using fat free chicken broth instead of butter to moisten the stuffing mix. I also add in about a cup of shredded cheese and for the topping, I mix in some crushed Ritz crackers with the stuffing. Usually my veggies are a mix of zucchini and yellow squash. Delicious!!

I really liked this and will make again!  i used both zucchini (1 lb) and 1 lb yellow summer squash manly for color and I love both equally.  I sauted the squash, carrots, onions (and I added 1 c celery).  After stirring in the soup and sour cream with the veggies, I stirred the stuffing/crumbs right in with the veggie/soup mix (I used Pepperidge Farms - fine crumbs). I did this for easy factor.  It was goey and  I skipped adding butter to the stuffing.  I used closer to 16oz vs. 6oz the recipe called for...since Pepperidge Farms crumbs are so fine.  Devoured. What a delicious idea for veggies AND a filling dinner - all at the same time.  Thanks Highroad.

I made this casserole last night and it was delicious!  I left the carrots out ( didn't have any) and substituted the onion with 1 tbsp minced onion and added it to the soup and sour cream mixture.  The crunchy stuffing mixed with the creamy zucchini was perfect and we had enough for leftovers tonight!

Fabulous! I used less carrots because that is all I had on hand. I sauteed the veggies first instead of boiling. I used more stuffing mix (more like 9 ounces) because I had to use it up (due to the additional stuffing I just added a tiny bit extra butter to it). I served this with a roasted chicken and roasted potatoes and onions. My husband hates zuchinni and he was chowing on this! I couldn't believe it. I only wish I tried this recipe earlier in the squash season!

I cut the butter in half and added about 1 c. cheese and corn.  I also sauteed the onion and just thinly sliced the zuchinni and cooked for about 45 min.

I was not a huge fan of this at all, and neither was my boyfriend.  And we're both huge zucchini lovers. He wasn't fond of the stuffing "crust" and I just didn't much like the soup+zucchini filling.

For this recipe, I used as much zucchini as I could fit into my skillet. I sauteed it in canola oil along with a summer squash, a whole onion and the carrots. After veggies were tender, I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a salt free blend. To the veggies, I added four shredded chicken breasts, cream of celery soup and the sour cream. I only used a little over a half stick of margarine to mix with the stuffing mix. I sprinkled the stuffing mix on top of the entire casserole because I neglected to read the rest of the directions. I really think that layering the stuffing mix would improve the taste. I also recommend making this casserole early in the day or the day before. It just always tastes better after flavors have had a chance to blend.

We really enjoyed this.  I sauteed all the veggies together, cooked up a few tenderloins and added them, then mixed all of that in with the creamy mixture. I also added a little more stuffing than was called for (I love stuffing, what can I say :)  
Now I like Zucchini, our garden went a little crazy and so we have had A LOT of zucchini, and we have had a lot of different zucchini-concoctions. So, I liked that zucchini wasn't a hugely dominant part of this recipe, there was a lot more to it. Will make again, maybe even tomorrow because we have a lot more zucchini to get rid of.

Mercy, this was soooo good!!!  Someone had given me tons of zucchini, so I went a-searching for recipes!  This one is a keeper!    I did make a few changes as I didn't have carrots, so I added diced yellow pepper, mushrooms and green onions in place of the carrots.  I sauteed my zucchini and onion in olive oil instead of boiling them.  I only used about 3/4 can of cream of chicken and 3/4 cup sour cream.  I also added some cheddar cheese to the mix.  I did double the stuffing as suggested and was glad I did.    My husband and I usually have some form of meat in our suppers, so this was a change.  But he loved it and so did I!  Bring on the zucchini!!

Absolutely loved this! The only thing I changed was substituting cream of mushroom. I think the cream of chicken would be just as good! I will definitely make this again! I was complaining the whole time of how many dishes were dirtied but this served as our startch and veggie so it was justified : )!

I really liked it but there is *something* missing, not sure what.  I kept wanting to have a little more flavor.  Maybe adding another 1/2 box of the stuffing would give it some zing.  I sauteed the zucchini for 5 minutes with the onion in some olive oil; it still had a lot of crunch to it even after baking for 25 minutes.  Over all, a great recipe for company!

Absolutely love this!  I use one bag of sage and onion bread cubes like Mom uses for thanksgiving with 2 sticks of butter.  Put half of the bag in a bowl with one stick of melted butter.  Put on bottom of 9x13 glass pan.  Make the zuchhini mixture.  Put the rest of the cubes in the bowl with another stick of butter.  Put on top. Bake at 350 for an hour.  or less if needed.

This was pretty good for a quick casserole.  I followed the basic recipe and then made some additions.  I used two small yellow summer squash, some chopped bell pepper, a bag of cooked frozen veg. consisting of corn, carrots, and asparagus, and a large can of cooked turkey.  I also added a little mozz. cheese along with some cracked black pepper, dill, and garlic powder.  It ended up being pretty tasty and a nice way to "hide" veggies from my b/f!  He even ate the yellow squash in this, and he HATES squash! A nice, quick, one dish meal!

I've been making this and eating this casserole made by other family members for years!  It's one of my favorites.  I omit the carrots, though, and use plain bread crumbs as opposed to the chicken flavored kind, which can be overpowering.  I also sautee the zucchini and leave the onion raw to cook in the casserole - turns out perfect every time!

Love this recipe! I didn't have cream of chicken but I did have cream of potato so that worked out well, fresh zucchini from our garden and some boneless, skinless chicken cooked and cubed into peices and it all came together nicely! Thanks for sharing this recipe! Definitely a winner with the family! ?? I will be making again!

Very tasty!!  I added 2 chicken breasts in bite size pieces, and cooked them in olive oil until cooked.  Then I cooked the zucchini just until it was barely tender.  (I don't like mushy zucchini).  I used 1/4 cup of butter (1/2 stick).  This kept it not too soggy....I also used light sour cream, and cream of celery soup because I didn't have the cream of chicken.  This is a salty dish--my husband loved it...but next time I think I will use a low sodium soup.

I followed this recipe exactly and it did not turn out great.  My family asked that I not make it again... Why are we boiling zucchini ~ frying may have been much better, although more caloric.

First, I don't know where one would find a 6 ounce package of stuffing. A standard package is 14 ounces. I had already prepared the recipe when i read the 6 ounce figure, so I scrambled to compensate for the difference. I added some chicken broth for moisture and it worked fine. It was delicious, and I'll definitely make it again. This time I'll know that "1 package" really means less than 1/2 package.

I have used this recipe or at least one simular for years. Yellow summer squash is the best, I enjoy it better then zucchini. and to even mix the two is great. I add a littleGarlic powder, salt and pepper tand the carrots in with the squash as it cooks. It is better to steam the vegetables(less liquid).

Very good, very tasty. I use it as a main dish and I was really surprised how filling and delicious it is because I'm a beef & pasta lover!  Even the picky husband likes this for dinner.

My husband loves zucchini and squash, so I am always looking for different ways to cook them. This is a great recipe. It has a real "Sunday dinner" taste. The stuffing gives it most of its flavor. You really wouldn't know you were eating zucchini if you aren't the one that made it. It is something I will make again and again.

My entire family loves this dish! I add mixed veggies depending on what we feel like. Can also substitute cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken and hemp milk with vinegar instead of sour cream to make this dish almost entirely vegan.

I used reduced-fat cream of chicken soup and nonfat sour cream, and thought it still turned out reasonably well.  I also thought, like other reviewers, that it was almost better reheated the next day.  I thought it was a pretty good recipe, one that I would keep.  My roommates, on the other hand, absolutely loved it.

This casserole is soooo good!!! My family devours it. I prefer using cream of mushroom soup, but you can't really tell the difference. It's great that most of the ingredients I usually have on hand. This is a favorite summer time side dish!

Delicious! I decided to add shredded chicken to make the casserole more of a dinner than a side dish. I added about 2cups of chicken and added an extra can of cream of mushroom. Great this way. Kids love it.

WOW!!! This was good!!!  I pretty much followed the recipe but sauteed the zucchini and onion.  I added diced cooked chicken thighs to make it a meal but, it wasn't needed.  It would have been fine without.  WARNING: The stuffing mix is very salty.  Do not add salt to the zucchini mix!

I was sure I was going to love this, but it really didn't turn out as expected.  The flavor was good, but the stuffing was really dry.  I'd probably try it again, but next time I'll moisten the stuffing mix with broth.  Too bad because it makes a lot!

I just made this as a side with dinner and my husband and I LOVED IT!!  I halved the recipe because it's just the two of us.  I microwaved the zucchini and onion with a little olive oil and garlic powder, then drained.  Instead of carrots, I used sharp cheddar cheese.  I didn't, however, half the stuffing, I used the whole 6 oz., layering half the zucchini mix, then half the stuffing, then repeating both.  Delicious!!  And there's still plenty left over for another meal.

This was really good.  I sauteed veggies instead, used mushroom soup as I was out of chicken, put the stuffing just on top.  I also added a bit of garlic to the veggies.  This is a keeper. Thanks.

This is one of my favorites.  The only change I made is substituting low fat mayonnaise for the butter.  Everyone loves this.

I used mushrooms instead of carrots and added Italian sausage, which gave the dish a very brunch-like feel. My friends and co-workers loved it. I mean LOVED it, but I found it too salty. Probably my fault though for adding the sausage. I would suggest if you add a seasoned meat, to get unflavored stuffing mix.

I made some changes based on what I had.  No carrots, sauteed the zucchini and onions, used cream of celery soup, & added left over chicken fingers.  Also I put the stuffing only on the top because there didn't seem to be enough for both top and bottom.  Thanks for the recipe--it's a good jumping off point.  Oh...low fat sour cream is just fine and I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup chicke broth for the stuffing.

My picky husband loved this.  I did not add the carrots, but added browned sausage.  As with other comments, I sauteed the onions, zucchini.  Will definitely make again.

I made some changes to cut the fat way back. I used cream of mushroom-reduced fat. Refused fat sour cream and about 1/2 stick of butter instead of a whole stick. Im sure its way better the other way but i dont like to eat all that fat. I would make it again.

I saute the onions, zuchini and add squash.  I also make a little extra stuffing to make sure there is plenty on top to get crusty.  Very good, tastes like Thanksgiving in a dish!

This recipe is delicious.  My husband is not a veggie fan and he had two servings.  I used canned chicken and canned carrots and it was fine.  We really enjoyed it and will make it lots during zuchinni season !

The flavor was great.  Alot of texture.  Kid friendly.  Not diet friendly.  I would make this again for my family.  Although I would double the amount of zucchini next time.

Good, comfort food. Nice flavors, good for side dish at a party or dinner at the table. Add a bit more hotness to it and extra stuffing to make it more filling. My dad really liked it. Thanks.

This recipe is good- and very easy.  I would cut back on the butter if I were making it again.  I also just sliced the onions- saved time on chopping and I like the presentation.

This was good and I'm not usually a big squash fan.  However, I do think that a tablespoon of basil is way *to much* and overpowers the other flavors.

This was delicious!  I added chopped celery and used cream of celery soup, since my grandma is not a fan of chicken in any way.  We both loved it, and it reminded her of a casserole her mother used to make.

I used a zucchini, Mexican squash and yellow squash.  I sautéed the squash with onions, garlic and oregano.  I added 1 can of canned chicken.  I used Italian bread crumbs and sprinkled shredded Parmesan cheese on top of the soup mixture and again on top of the bread crumbs.  Super good.  Will make again

Yes, I made it vegan. Replacing with vegan substitutes, as follows:  butter by earth balance, sour cream by Tufutti, cream of mushroom soup by Campbell's, and cornbread stuffing by  StoveTop. Delicious!

this is so good, I can't stop eating it.  total comfort food flavor.  I did the method of prep just a tad different but kept the basic recipe, adding in a few fresh chopped mushrooms I had left in the refrigerator.  used cream of chicken & mushroom soup.  didn't want to add the butter so prepped the stuffing mix to moisten and used it that way.  total comfort and a snap to prepare.  served with a turkey breast.  great meal.  this was such a quick and easy casserole.  I love it.  thanks so much.

I've liked similar recipes more than this one, but I can't point out why.  'Not  "big" on cheese with vegetables so that's not it.  Kinda bland.  'Think the most helpful positive reviewer that sauteed rather than boiled was going in the right direction.  Overnight, the flavor improved quite a bit.  'Wonder if making ahead, refriging then baking would work out better.

This was great! I had frozen zucchini, squash, and eggplant weeks before after having too much and was looking for a way to use it. I too sautéed the mixture in olive oil and garlic instead of boiling then stirred in a can of cream of chicken soup. I left out the sour cream simply because I forgot but it was plenty moist. Everyone loved it including our kids!

I had three zucchini,one white onion, and one can of cream of celery soup on hand. I only had 1/2 cup sour cream   - so I had to bring it to one cup with mayo.  I also added 1 cup shredded cooked chicken - as other reviewers suggested.  Also - as another reviewer suggested - I sautéed the zucchini and onion with some dill in a dry sauce pan  - so no draining needed! I will make this again and again - I used the broiler the last 2 minutes to crisp up the topping.  Thanks so much for the casserole idea - this is great for summer or winter!!!!

This was ok, but not great.  I agree with another person who said it was just way too much zucchini, if you agree try this: prepare another box of any stove top type stuffing mix according to the directions on the box, and mix that into the original batch; re-heat in the oven or microwave.  The zucchini, carrots, etc. blend well with the other flavors. You may find that it needs a little salt, but season to taste.

I made this recipe exactly as is and it was fantastic! I couldn't stop eating it. It was also very easy to prepare. I think I will shred the zucchini next time and sprinkle Parmesan cheese on too before baking.

I've been making this recipe for over 30 years. Absolutely love it! I usually add more veges though, corn, yellow squash, even celery and sliced carrots. I add them to the zucchini and onions when I steam those.

Used cream onion soup as sub, boiled carrots with veg, used zucchini and yellow squash.  Great way to use up the extra zucchini.  Good casserole for a potluck.

Me and my husband love this recipe. When we cook it, it doesn't last very long. We always go for seconds. It's so easy too and it's a good way to get our veggies in because we aren't big on veggies. This makes it taste delicious though!

Delicious!  Great as a vegetarian main dish.  Adding some shredded rotisserie chicken sounds like it might be good too, for extra protein.

Very good basic recipe that you can customize to your taste.  I used summer squash in it as well.  I added a little milk so it wasn't too dry.  I might try making the stuffing next time instead of just adding butter.

This is absolutely delicious! I substituted garlic for the onion and didn't have stuffing so I used whole wheat bread crumbs. We'll definitely be making this dish again!

I thought this recipe was "okay" - I followed a lot of the reviewers suggestions, which I think made it better (sauteed the zucchini and onions with some garlic for a few minutes instead of boiling - added a lot of flavor).  I think this recipe is just missing something, but I'm not sure what.

Fantastically delicious and easy!  I made my own stuffing for the bottom, steamed the veggies in the microwave with butter and put on top of the stuffing, covered with the sauce, the topped with cheese and bread crumbs since I only had a little bit of stuffing.  Perfect!

This was really great with roasted pork.  I used cream of onion soup, since I didn't have cream of chicken soup.  Next time, will add garlic.  I also sauteed the zucchini with onion and shredded carrots instead of boiling.  This is comfort food!

I didn't know this recipe existed until a friend brought is as a side dish with dinner after I had my last baby. It is my favorite casserole side dish ever. I plant one zucchini plant and one summer squash plant each year in my garden, along with carrots, and there is plenty to make this dish over and over. If I could rate it 10 stars I would.

Good base recipe, but I found it a bland. It turned out some what loose or soupy. I may try again but will do some tweaking.

My brother, who HATES zucchini, LOVED this recipe. I liked it too, but I though the flavor got a little old after a while. It reheated in the oven better than the microwave. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and also added more, bigger peices of onion.

I'm not sure how anyone can call this bland. I used Campbells cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and I couldn't stop eating the stuff! Yum yum yum

I kind of followed the recipe - i sauteed the squash with 5 cloves of minced garlic in olive oil.   I omitted the onions (since my niece is allergic to them) and added a bag of frozen mixed veggies and a half bag of frozen broccoli.   I also substituted the cream of chicken with 2 cans of cream of broccoli (since my niece is a vegetarian)while i halved the sour cream asked by the recipe.  I also added (and I'm surprised no one else did this) but i added about 4 oz of cheddar cheese to the zucchini mix and used corn bread stuffing for the top and bottom of the casserole.  All in all this casserole came out like gangbusters - I'm sure the caloric content was a bit higher - but it was dee-lish!

Fantastic recipe.  Made it for a family picnic and everyone asked for the recipe.  This worked out to my advantage because I have lots of zucchini in the garden growing faster than I can keep up with so I also sent home zucc's with everyone along with the recipe.  The only change I made was to sautee the zucchini, onion, and carrots in small amt marg and some water until tender instead of boiling.  My six year old loves this, she would pass up choc cake for a plate of this.  I will definately be keeping this recipe.  Thank you for posting it.

A solid recipe. Only changes I'd make are: Blanche the squash instead of boiling for a full 5 minutes. Use a slightly less salty stuffing mix type.

I got this recipe from one of my coworkers. It is the best! Great way to use up the zucchini. Instead of doing it in layers, I mix it all together, spray the pan with no stick spray and then bake. This would be great with some chicken in it as someone else suggested.

This is a great recipe!  I diced the zucchini and cooked it, onions, & carrots in butter.  Then, I mixed all the ingredients together (even all of dry stuffing mix) and put it all in the pan at once.  I did not layer it.  The casserole came out of the oven with a golden color (from carrots) and green speckled (very attractive look).  Tasted wonderful.  It is the best zucchini casserole that I ever tasted.  I plan on adding diced chicken the next time I make it (which will probably be this week).  Picking zucchini everyday from garden.

This was ok but I would definitely need to up the ammount of stuffing mix and maybe use some additional veggies. All in all an ok recipe that I don't think I will make again.

This is a different yet yummy recipe. I didn't use as much zucchini as it called for and added diced carrots that I first sauteed in butter. Delicious!

Next time I would saute my veggies rather than boil...as they were a little too "water logged" even after draining well...However, I will make it again!  Thanks for sharing!!

It was alright.  I left out the sour cream and added some cubed chicken.  For me, the stuffing overpowered everything else.  If I were to make it again, I would use this dish as a side, and not as a main course.

Very good with just a few changes...I sauteed the zucchini and onion in olive oil.  I also added some garlic salt because I love garlic in everything!  I skipped the carrots and used 12 oz bread crumbs but kept the amount of margarine the same.  I will make this again!

This recipe was ok.  I'm not a big fan of using canned soup but I thought with all the other flavors it would work.  I guess I'm really picky because it seems to me whenever I use canned soup, it tastes like canned soup.  I prefer fresh/dry ingredients.  The texture of the squash cooked really nice though.

This was so good!  I may add another box of stuffing to the mixture next time. Leftovers were just as good topped with cheese.   Thanks!

This recipe was just okay for me. I strayed from it somewhat, though, so maybe it was my fault! I essentially made it stovetop and put it in the oven in the pan (I have great pans!) to finish up in the end. I used a HUGE fresh zucchini and the skin was horribly tough and ruined that part of the dish. I stirred the stuffing into the mix and added bite-sized chicken breast chunks. I also added a clove of minced garlic. I put some crushed Ritz on top and some cheddar and let that melt/brown in the oven. It was good but nothing to write home about! Honestly I think it may have been better if the skins of my zucchini had been edible! :o)

Good way to use zucchini.  I liked it but my husband and kids didn't so much so I won't make it again.  Thanks for the post.

This was good - but I can't rave about it.  I did put garlic in it which I wouldn't do again.  Garlic and zucchini flavors don't blend well in this recipe.  I'll have to try it again without the garlic ;-)

My family loved this.  I wasn't as excited as they were.  It was heavy on the prepared foods flavors - I could hardly taste the vegatables - and was too salty for my taste, even with the unsalted butter.

This is a great recipe.  It makes a BIG batch and is great even as a leftover side dish.  A great way to use up that "extra" zucchini from your garden.

I put too much bread crumb stuffing, which I didn't like. Next time I'll put less stuffing. Other than that, very good and good use for veggies.
