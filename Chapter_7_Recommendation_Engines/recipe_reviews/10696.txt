This buttery bar cookie is simple to make and surprisingly delicious and addictive.  I include this cookie when I'm putting together a cookie tray - it provides a nice balance to the more complex and "heavier" cookies.

Call me silly, but I like them better made in a pie plate.  very simple, but needs a little adjustment. Mix 2/3 cup room-temperature (unsalted) butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup packed brown (light or dark). I like the almond flavor, so add 1 1/2 tsp extract. Add the whole beaten egg, except for 1 tsp. Sift 1 1/2 cups of flower and 1/2 tsp of baking powder into butter/sugar/egg mixture. Put dough in greased 9" pie plate. Mix reserved egg w/ 1 tsp water and brush over dough. I like to add some turbinado sugar on top for crunch rather than the slivered almonds, but that's a matter of taste. Bake for 25-30 mins. at 350F until firm to the touch. Comes out great!

THESE ARE INCREDIBLE! So easy and sooooooo good! I just used an average glass casserole dish, and it worked out fine. These were halfway between a cookie and a cake, but they cut very easily and held their shape. This recipe would make a divine crust. Highly recommended! So easy and quick, and the almond taste is gourmet--reminiscent of marzipan. I'll be making these again. THANKS!!

This recipe is pretty good as is, but I suggest using half white sugar, half (light) brown. In Holland we don't use brown sugar for this recipe, but a white sugar that is similar in texture to brown sugar. I have never made this using egg and omitted it this time, too, and it was still delicious. Good to know for those with egg allergies. Take this out of the oven when light brown, leave it in too long and you could break a tooth once it's cool.

Best boterkoek I've ever made. and I've tried a couple before.  I was born and raised in Holland so this is a taste of home for me. As another user mentioned; in holland we don't use brown sugar but white sugar that has the same consistency as brown sugar. it's called basterd sugar. (doesn't translate well ;-) Therefore results into boterkoek that's way darker than a typical Dutch one.
I used an 8x12 pyrex dish and baked for about 30 minutes. When the edges start to turn brown it's time to take it out even when the middle still looks very pale. it's easy to overbake these and then they'll be rock hard :-/ Also, I used parchement paper to make it easy to get the boterkoek out of the pyrex (and less mess). Let cool down before attempting to start cutting these up or they will fall apart.

I went in search of a cookie recipe for my son's project fair when he needed one from the Netherlands.  Ran across this one and tried it and WOW what a hit!  All the kids and parents were gathered around his project display and munching away.  Everyone loved them.  Hubby said the only thing he would like different is to drizzle warm honey on the top so next time I make them I might do that for him.  Excellent job, thanks for sharing!

Edited on July 1st...My son, who is on a European adventure with People to People, called me last night from Switzerland!  They will be home on Wednesday.  All of his friends that ate these cookies at the above mentioned project fair were asking him to call home and have me make some for them to have as soon as they got back.  Now how is that for rave reviews!  Didn't call to say hello, but called for THIS cookie!

Fabulous! I love buttery, melt-in-your-mouth cookies, and these didn't fail to impress me. I did ½ cup butter and ½ cup margarine (ran out of butter!) and followed the rest of the recipe, except I sprinkled turbinado (like large-grain brown sugar) on top and put whole almonds in a decorative pattern. Yum, yum, yum! Don't be concerned about the number of steps, this is a super-fast recipe! Try it! Thanks for sharing, Sandra!

These are really tasty.  I made them because my husbands family is Dutch.  My husband said they were really good.  i am going to try them out on my father-in-law tonight.  Hopefully he likes them just as much.  Thanks for the recipe.  I have been looking for some dutch baking recipes for the holidays for a few years now.

good cookie...reminded me when i was young and the dutch bakker would come to our house to bring us these cookies. The only issue I had was the time in the oven. I had them in there at least for 35 min. not 20...did anyone else have this problem???

I had to invent a pan to bake this in and I also had to cook it for about 10 minute longer.  Having said that, the biscuits tasted great.  I didn't cut them into regular sizes, but instead broke the 'cake' into pieces.  Everyone at work loved them and I'm taking some to my Dutch class tonight!!!

Delicious and buttery! My family LOVES these cookie bars. I made a whole bunch and gave as holiday gifts to co-workers and everyone loved them. They don't look that impressive or delicious, but taste great. My sister always requests me to bake these for her. I love the recipe because it's so fast and easy. Thanks for the recipe! The only change I made was cut down the sugar to 1 cup, but that's personal preference.

These are very good!! I love almond flavoring so they were right up my alley. I halved the batch and made a small pan and cooked them for about 25 minutes and they were perfect. I had made a regular batch prior and followed the instructions of others and cooked them for 30 and to me they were too done. They came out of the oven looking perfect, but after they cooled they hardened up a bit....still good though! Next time I make them I am going to double the batch and make them in a bigger pan so I get a thicker bar. I think it is going to take a few tries to figure out the perfect temp and perfect pan, but the recipe is spot on!

My workplace was having an ethnic Christmas food day and I made these Dutch Almond Boterkoek bars (cutting them in half to further feed the masses), and they went faster than anyone else's items.  Several people asked for the recipe afterwards.  I followed this recipe exactly, only using sliced almonds on top instead of slivered.  I did have to cook them longer than stated in the directions, more like 45 minutes.  I just watched them closely after 30 minutes and when I saw a slight browning I pulled them from the oven.  They probably had to bake longer because I used a 9x9 square baking dish and therefore were a little thicker than they would have been otherwise with the baking dishes suggested.  I plan to make these again very soon and I think I may try pecans this time.  These treats are a big hit!

This was a hit with our hosts and relatives! Plus it was super easy to make! I would suggest taking it out just when it turns brown, even if it doesn't seem done. The bars firm up as they cool. Try cutting them into triangles!

I made 2 batches of these for my entire class of 70 people, and they were gone instantly! The second time I made them I finally got to try one, and they are fabulous!! My fiance is Dutch and these are by far his favorite treat. Very authentic, easy to make, and highly addictive!!

Awesome!! I did the recipe exactly and it turned out really well. The 20 minutes wasn't enough so I let it go for an additional 5 minutes and it still wasn't done in the middle but I pulled it out anyway. Still super yummy. It was very greasy for me because of the butter but nobody seemed to mind because it tasted so good!

This was unbelievably good! I did make to alterations but purely out of my own taste. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond
 extract and I topped mine with sweetened coconut witch toasted beautifully for me. I only baked it for 25 minutes and the consistency was that of gooey butter cake but still held up to the cutting really well. Really easy to make as well! My two kids and hubs loved it! Definitely going to be making this again!

My sister-in-law makes this for most family get-togethers and I was never a fan.  I decided to make this myself as it's one of my husband's favourites and now I can't get enough. I cooked it for a few minutes longer and it came out with a crunchy edge that is so delicious!!!! This is definitely something I will make more often.  THANKS!

Yum yum yummy. I made 1 batch and ate half. Put the rest in a ziplock, hoping I wouldn’t hear them calling my name and saying eat me. Alas my will power is weak when it comes to anything with almonds.  Will I make it again? Of course but not too soon have to burn off the calories. Thank you.

My thoughts on this recipe are mixed. The flavor is excellent - five stars. I think it would be much easier to see when it is properly done without brushing it with egg white. As it is, mine was underbaked. Not as delicious as one would like - one star.

I read the reviews, and used 1/2 c brown and 1/2 c white sugar only. I also added some sliced almonds to the dough before pressing into my parchment-lined pan. Topped with sliced almonds and sprinkled turbinado sugar. These were PERFECT. They tasted JUST LIKE the ones I got from my local bakery!

I used the sliced almonds instead of the blanched almonds.  This is my all time favorite cookie recipe!  Easy to make also

Tastes like home! I used half&half white and brown sugar, put it in a pie dish instead as well. Of course I used sliced almonds... And I used a little more almond extract than the recipe calls for ;)

Delicious, chewy almond bars.  I made this for a program at my local library and had many requests for the recipe.  Highly recommend

So, so, so good! An old family friend from Holland used to bring us one of these every Christmas when I was a little girl, but she would never give out the recipe. I have remembered it all these years WISHING I knew how to make it, but not even knowing what it was called--we always just called it Annie's Marzipan. This is it!!! I am so happy! And it is SO YUMMY! I made it for my family this year and we all died! Thank you for the recipe!

Tastes great! Though it wouldn't bake. I had to bake it for 40 minutes until it finally was done... enough. Still kinda underdone but that's my oven's fault I suppose. Still tastes great!

Delicious!!! I made these for a Christmas Cookie Tray and they were amazing, everyone loved them! I added 1 add'l egg and separated the yolk and whites, this gave me more whites to spread. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very easy recipe to make. I added some crushed nuts into the actual dough as well as on top and this added an extra crunch. I thought there was slightly too much butter though... But my family didn't mind and loved it but I think next time I will lower the amount down slightly because it was a bit too much. Over all an excellent recipe and will make again

These are amazing! I also had problems with the almonds falling off. I switched to chopped walnuts and press them into the dough. They don't fall off! I also use vanilla instead of almond extract. I like that flavor better. I make these every Christmas and they ship very well! My son likes to crumble them over ice cream.

Incredible! Just what I was craving. Was tempted to tweak it but I followed the recipe as is and it turned out heavenly! Yum
