I made this for Cinco De Mayo. I was a little uncertain with the potato in it but it came out well. I made this in my new rice cooker...so easy! I would suggest adding some spice to it as it was a little bland. With some doctoring this could be my new Mexican Rice recipe. I am going to try substituting salsa for the tomato sauce next time and see if that helps.

We just didn't care for it, sorry. It's got about twice the amount of tomato sauce needed; it simply overpowers the rice, making it taste more like the boxed Spanish rice Mom used to make when I was a kid.

Simple and easy recipe that gives you the flexibility to make it your own. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. It came out great!

Thank you. This is exactly the same rice recipe when I lived in San Antonio 30 years ago. I do add the bell peppers and also some garlic , goya adobo all purpose seasoning in addition to the bullion in which I use the vegan version edward & sons not chicken. Absolutely delicious!

Family loved it but I can’t ever follow a recipe, I always have to add our own twist because of our taste. I added bell pepper and minced garlic to the onion and a teaspoon of butter when saluting.  Then once all was in the pan, I added some taco seasoning, pinch of salt and pepper. Next time I’ll add some chili powder at the least but this is a great starter recipe for families with picky eaters or people (like me) making Mexican rice for the first time! Thank you for sharing!

I used Rotel instead of tomato sauce. I also used Goya seasoning and salt (to taste) instead of the chicken bouillon. I will definitely make it again. It tastes amazing!

Mom makes this and I was simply trying to find a recipe using all the ingredients I remember her using so thanks. While it's not as tasty as other fancier Mexican rice recipes on this site it's tasty, easy, and with ingredients that are almost always on hand. It's an authentic working mom recipe, a staple. ;)
