I made this and was very dissappointed. It didn't rise as much as I had hoped and the topping just wasn't that flavorful. I used pecan instead of walnuts, because I like them better and they did add a little flavor, but the bread part was very bland. Maybe adding some cinnamon would help.

These were good although I did make a few adjustments. I used pecans (I agree, they are better) and I layered the whole thing. Putting a bit of dough, then a lot of topping, then a bit of dough and a lot of topping. As well, press the topping down on the top cause once it cooks not all of mine stuck but they were otherwise great warm with a bit of butter. YUM!

Super disappointed.  The cake was more like pizza dough, it didn't rise and it wasn't fluffy.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts because I like them better as well.  The topping was good but the cake itself wasn't appetizing at all.

I  had my class make this recipe and it failed in all six groups that made this recipe. It did not rise just like the other reviewer stated. It also was bland. I will be taking this one out of my recipe file. Don't waste the ingredients.

This is pretty much just what it says it is.  It came out as I expected it to, a coffee cake type cake that is not very sweet.
It did rise just fine for me, but I did make a mistake in prep that probably helped in that.  I halved the recipe but forgot to halve the yeast, so I put 2 pkts of yeast in 1/2 recipe.  I also separated the dough into 2 parts, flouring my hands as necessary to work the dough (dough is very wet).  I spread each half into a round cake pan to rise, then after they rose, put a layer of jam on top of one and set the second dough circle on top of the jam.  I know that is completely not how the original recipe is written, but it worked well and came out exactly as I had hoped - a not too sweet cake with a jam filling.  Without the jam filling, the cake by itself is almost more like a sweet bread.  It is quite good, though.  The author's description is accurate.
