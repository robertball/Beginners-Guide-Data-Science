Also my grandmothers recipe which we make all the time.  Have shared it with other members of my husband's family.  We all love it.  So good with a cup of coffee or glass of milk - not too sweet, but wonderful taste and texture.

I had to add quite a bit more flour to get the dough to a cookie consistency, in order to drop them on the pan. They also required a longer baking time than the recipe says. However, I iced them with confectioner's glaze and they turned out absolutely delicious!

I found that not adding more flour but putting the cookie dough in the fridge for half hour to hour made it dropable. Would have to add more flour to roll out though. Easy enough as long as you don't smell the ammonia before you put it in the dough!!

Good recipe.  Mine needed significantly more flour to make dough stiff enough to drop.  I also had to bake for longer, but I tend to make large cookies so maybe that is why.  They did not get golden - just browned on the bottom but they were done.  I also added a bag of mini-choco chips which I highly recommend!

As is, dough was too wet to even do a drop cookie. even after chilling Added a LOT more flour to roll out. Glazed with a peppermint glaze.  Was too much peppermint so I added chopped up chocolate on top. The texture is very cakey and for me I think it would benefit from some chopped nuts

these were my nightmare cookies. they were gooey and sticky even after following the review recommendations. i finally got the proper recipe from my husbands grandmother. unless you are using a true Mennonite recipe this isn't worth the waste of time and ingredients.
