The result is very good but only if you make an adjustment. The recipe calls for one pint of strawberries then has you puree 2 cups (the whole pint)and still have strawberries left over to put between layers. Instead, puree one cup of strawberries and use the remaining cup to put between layers.

Delicious and genuine taste.  A little too much of the marscapone mixture for me- I would have cut amount by 1/2 to 2/3, and only layered it with two layers of the lady fingers.  Also, like everyone else pointed out, you need about 3/2 as much strawberries, for the slice layer and top. The larger pieces make for nice texture- glad I read reviews.  The espresso added a lovely flavor to the fingers.  Only thing I would now have added would be to put some nice large shavings of dark chocolate on top in addition to cocoa powder.  For added wow- a few twirls of edible gold.

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner as suggested by the Allrecipes Newsletter. Even though the recipe can be hard to follow, I enjoyed it very much. The flavor was amazing and the presentation alone looks beautiful. There may be a problem with the number of strawberries called for in the puree, but still having enough remaining for the layering / garnish. I recommend setting aside 5 or 6 strawberries to use in the layering / garnish and using the rest for the puree. I highly recommend this recipe and look forward to making it for guests in the future.

Well this is the most amazing tiramisu recipe ever.  I cannot BELIEVE not that many people have tried it.  This will now be the dessert for every birthday/special occasion.  It is not too sweet, and the whole recipe just tastes fantastic - the strawberries really lighten up the dish.  FYI, 1/3 cup espresso is a little less than 2 shots at Starbucks - I like to apply it with a brush to the lady fingers.  My brother is impatiently awaiting HIS birthday now....

I made this for a dinner guest and everyone was basically licking their plates. I did double the recipe, and it was enough for 4 people with leftovers. Not to sweet and very light and refreshing, nice change....even my kids liked it a couple days later as leftover dessert. Definately a keeper.

The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because I deviated slightly from the original recipe. I used an entire quart of strawberries, instead of a pint. Also, after each layer of mascarpone mixture, I put a layer of the strawberry puree and then a layer of sliced strawberries. I finished it off as stated in the recipe with the whipped cream and sliced strawberries. For a finishing touch, I melted some semi-sweet chocolate, added a little bit if almond extract, and drizzled the warm chocolate over the tops of the dessert. Delish recipe!

I don't know if it's just me, but I found the directions hard to follow.  I ended up using all the sliced strawberries in the puree instead of saving 1/2 of them for the layers because '2 cups' for me meant all the sliced strawberries.   So I layered puree in the middle and it still tasted good that way.  Overall a good recipe and I'll probably use it again.

I was not sure how this would turn out, with strawberries. I was stuck on the more classic variation of this dessert. I am sure glad I made this, and my hubby loved it as well. He ate the whole piece, without even a word. In my house, that means it is fantastic.

This is a quick and easy recipe that was very well received... I used Chouffe liquer (Distilled Belgian Beer and coffee liquer)which worked well as it is not as sweet as other brands.

When I first tried the recipe I was going to post a bad review. I did not like the way the flavors blended. I did not eat the whole recipe. I just had 1/2 and ate the rest the next day. Then it was delicious! I recommend it to prepare the recipe one day and let it rest for 24 hours before consuming it. The flavor is very different. It tastes so much better. You will thank me later...

Thought this was so so. I couldn't get my husband or his brother to eat it. I had worked so hard making it that I ate it by myself. (well... not the whole thing!) I like the classic tiramisu much better.

I made half the recipe for the two of us and we found it just the right amount.  I used raspberries rather than strawberries because that's what I had available and I actually think I would prefer them in this dessert over the strawberries anyway.  I really appreciate recipes like this that are scaled down so that the two of us can enjoy a little dessert and not have a 13x9 pan or trifle bowl of dessert left over!

This was very rich, but very good. More refreshing than the chocolate version. Next time I may use more coffee, but besides that, it's a great recipe to impress someone special

AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. I made this for my boyfriend for Vday dessert and even though he was stuffed after dinner he at half of the entire dessert because it was so good! I couldn't find mascarpone cheese anywhere so I substituted 7 oz farmer's cheese 1/8 C sour cream and 1/8 C heavy cream. It came out great. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make it again and again!

This is one of my favorite desserts!  I made it for the first time on Valentine's Day...and several times after.  The only change I made was making enough espresso to allow me to dip each ladyfinger until they're all covered, instead of spooning it on.  I've also made it without the strawberry puree and it's just as good!  no bake and very refreshing!  it serves 4-6 nice size portions! yum :)

I was really excited to try this because I am a huge fan of tirimisu....however I was extremely disappointed. This is not good at all. I really didn't think the strawberry flavor went well with the coffee flavor and it just wasn't a good tirimisu filling. On the other hand, however I did come up with a "strawberries & cream shortcake" using the basis of this recipe and my husband really liked it. I think I'll stick to making my own yummy tirimisu. For those of you looking for small recipes you can always input your own recipes onto this site and scale it down to however small you want!

I've never had strawberries in my tiramusu before, but they are the perfect compliment! The only thing I will change in the future is to add champagne to the mascarpone cheese filling (had it in a restaurant and loved it).

This dessert was HUGE!!! To eat it in two serves my husband & I would have needed to starve for a week. (I didn't even bother about the puree to serve it on!) It yielded us six serves...Possibly because I couldn't find Ladyfingers in Australia, so I used what is customary for tirimasu - sponge fingers. Perhaps they're larger? I also would prefer next time to dip the bisscuits into the coffee, not spoon the mixture over, as the coverage was not even. Nice, but defintiely not my favourite.

I've made this several times and it's so delicious. It's time-intensive but any tiramisu is, so you have to expect that. It's a nice break from chocolate and you can't put the fork down.

Wee didn't enjoy this at all! There was way too much of the cream spread, i only used about half of it. And the strawberry puree was not sweet enough, so it was blah. Just overall kinda soso. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

I need help! when mix the mascarpone, sugar, cream, and liquor, the creme comes out bumpy (curdling?) and not smooth at all. i experimented and i think the mascarpone is the problem...is it too cold or too warm or anything of that sort? does anyone know what the problem might be?

I made this for dinner last night for my boyfriend and his brother.  They loved it.  Personally I like regular tiramisu slightly better, but they gave it 5 stars so I'm leaving it as is.  The recipe is confusing, and for personal taste I added extra booze (kahlua) and dunked the ladyfingers in the expresso mixture as opposed to brushing it.  This way they went nice and soft.  Will make again.  Thanks

we love tiramisu here and had great expectations for it. As noted, the amount of strawberries on the ing list don't mesh with amound used in the body of the instructions...but that is a minor thing. In the end...I just didn't like the strawberries with the coffee flavor together.

Tiramisu is my favorite dessert and I loved this variation.  It definitely made more than enough for two (but I don't mind!) I accidentally used regular sugar for the filling, but it turned out fine.  This was also my first time making my own whipped cream, and it was easy and delicious.  I didn't have enough strawberries to make the puree, but it was fine without it.  Thanks!

Wow! This is sinful. We very much enjoyed this recipe, but found it just short of what we thought tiramisu might be (even with the strawberry modification).

This was really good but the strawberries don't pop. The coffee flavor overrides them. I like the mascarpone mixture and would use it to make original tiramisu and forget about the pureed strawberries.

The picture does not do this one justice! It was so good, we had it for a special occasion, and now everyone keeps asking if we can make-up new occasions. Make sure to use espresso (from your favorite coffee house) and not the espresso drinks from the grocery store, because they have milk in them.

A beautiful presentation for an exceptionally easy to make dessert.  I found the taste to be extremely light...I would have preferred more richness.

This came out kind of ugly (my lady fingers fell over) but it was delliiiicious. My husband does not generally like tiramisu, but he loved this. I doubled the whipped cream to put on top since... mine fell over and I had trouble spreading it.

This was amazing.  Had the same issue with the strawberries, but used the two reserved for garnish for the layering.  Used some leftover coffee instead of espresso.  Can't wait to have company so I can make this one again!

We weren't big fans.  It reminded me more of strawberry shortcake than tiramisu.  I think the strawberry overpowered the espresso flavor.  I'll be sticking to regular tiramisu from now on.  I also wouldn't recommend pureeing an entire pint as suggested in the original recipe.  I had way too much puree and no desire to use it in anything else.

Second time making this. Great recipe for a summer twist on a classic dessert. Using 8 ounces of mascarpone made enough filling for 27 (instead of 18) lady fingers, creating 4 regular servings or 3 extra large servings. The strawberry puree gives it a nice sweet touch. I didn't have coffee liquor on hand, so substituted with rum instead. I remembered the alcohol was a little light for my taste the first time, so I added a little extra liquor this time around. Definitely a keeper!
