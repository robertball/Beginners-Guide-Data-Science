I've made this twice now.  It's very good as written, but I've also tried it with the addition of a few sprinkles of EVOO.  Both times a hit with the crowd.  Be sure to use fresh basil.

My wife makes this often and I don't think I could ever get sick of it. It's delicious and simple to make.  Great snack for when you have guests over.

It was good but I would add less balsamic.  I also added ricotta which I recommend.

We really like this recipie and it's pretty simple.  I couldn't find Balsamic glaze in the store and my attempts at making it failed miserably.  However, I just use regular Balsamic vinegerette and it works great.

This is a wonderful recipe! I have served it so many times the last two years for friends and family, and it always gets rave reviews and a request for the recipe !  And it looks pretty also.

Delicious!  I was out of pie crust so I used crescent roll dough.  Rave reviews from the whole family, including the picky eater who doesn't like tomatoes.  Will make again, often.

Love, love, love it! I made it just as is and it was perfect.  I switched out the pie crust with a sheet of phyllo dough and thought that was great too.  If you use phyllo, take a sharp knife and cut a border around it and puncture inside the border with a fork.  This will make the edges rise and the center with the "stuff" on it stay flat.  CLC

Great recipe! But I did tweak it. After reading other reviews, I decided to leave out the balsamic and use a Blackberry drizzle (recipe I found on food network). It was left over from a ham we ate on Easter.I thought it would be similar because it has balsamic vinegar in it. It added a sweet heat to the savory tart. I also added three slices of chopped Canadian bacon for protein, this added smokiness that went nicely with the other toppings. This tart is an interesting option for using up fresh basil and tomatoes when one's tired of caprese salad. I can only give it four stars because I haven't tried the recipe as is. I will def make it again.

Super easy to make - but kind of bland. I will take reviewers suggestion next time and add cheese. I secured the end of the roll using a little dab of the olive juice. I will give these one more chance before I move on - but it does need something more IMO

To me, this tastes like pizza.  The Hubs liked it. I used less cheese than called for and it was still pretty cheesy. Not really a tart.

Positively delicious and so easy to make.  I should have made two as it went too quickly and nothing left for seconds.  Great recipe.

I'm making this for a second time tomorrow for a girl's get together. I'm using my garden basil and tomatoes. The first time, I had to cook it longer for the crust to brown. This time, I'll make sure to put it on the lowest oven rack. Easy and tasty!
