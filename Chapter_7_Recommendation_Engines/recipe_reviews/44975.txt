OMG! With a little TLC, this sauce tastes just like the sauce in NYC Pizzerias! I added 1/2Tbs basil, 1/2tsp sugar + 1/2 tsp onion powder. Just popped in the blender and Viola! Perfection! Thank You for this recipe!!!

This pizza sauce, with just a few minor tweaks, was AMAZING on my pizza!  I used a couple of the suggestions made my another reviewer of this recipe (CINDY18LOU).  I only used 2 teaspoons of oregano, and I added 2 teaspoons of basil and 1/2 teaspoon of white sugar.  And with those tweaks, I made a Chicago-style stuffed pizza that was absolutely amazing!  You can go to my page to read my reviews of those other two recipes and what I did to make them.  I used the "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" and "Chicago-style stuffed pizza" recipes (with minor tweaks to the latter) to make an amazing pizza!  Highly recommended!  Also, this sauce makes an amazing spaghetti sauce!!  And with the 2nd batch, for spaghetti only, I added about 1/2 teaspoon of fennel, which added another very yummy taste to the mix!  Next time, I'm going to mix in some ground beef for what I'm sure will be a stellar meat sauce!

About reducing the acid in this recipe, a digestive concern from an earlier reviewer:  Sugar was recommended by another reviewer, but it is actually acidic.  It cuts the acidic taste, but not the effect in your belly.  (The cheese on the pizza, and the white flour in the crust also push the digestive acid levels up.)  Instead (or in addition), add baking soda.  Really.  Remember those baking soda and vinegar "volcanoes" in Middle School?  That should remind you of what you need in order to neutralize the acid.  With all the strong flavors in this sauce, my guess is 1 tsp will go without notice.  Add more, if you want.  You could probably sneak some into a homemade crust, too.  If heartburn is a frequent problem for you, do a search on "alkaline diet" for more tips.

nice easy sauce. I froze the left over sauce in an ice cube tray, then transfered cubes to zip top freezer bag so I can just defrost as many cubes as I need for the next pizza.

With modifications, very good! Based on reviews I decided to use fresh garlic (2 cloves), 2 tsp of basil, 1/2 tsp of sugar, 1/2 a tsp of onion powder, and only 2t dried oregano. Still very easy! Used with 'Grilled Pizza Wraps' recipe on this site. Delish!

We (my boyfriend and I) really enjoyed this sauce. I followed others suggestions and added a little bit of sugar. I also added some basil, onion powder, some pepper flakes and some more italian seasoning. It was really good! This was my first time making my own pizza sauce. Only have had it from the pizza places. I think I will continue to use this sauce!

Decided to try this tonight. I just got a bread machine for Christmas...and I've been baking bread all day! Since this is the first day I've had available to sit around the house and bake...i've had so much fun! I also added 1/2 tsp of basil, 1/2 tsp of sugar, and a 1/2 a tsp of onion powder. This added a lot of extra flavor!

Very simple and good. I did add basil to the dish and used fresh minced garlic. I also added 1/2 tsp of sugar per suggestions. This one is a keeper.

This recipe was better after I made some additions. I added two pinches of red pepper flakes, decreased the oregano to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp Italian seasoning. I also added 2 cloves of fresh garlic. We ate the whole pizza!

This was okay. Easy, for sure. My son made this on his own in a matter of seconds and he was quite proud of himself. This did the trick for what I needed. Next time, I'll cut back on the oregano a bit and add basil, onion powder and maybe a little brown sugar.

I'm not sure why all the positive reviews, I found this sauce mealy, bland and very "commercial".  Definitely not what I was looking for.

This was a very easy sauce, and nice because I always have the ingredients on hand. I use fresh garlic - and the second time I made it I put in an Italian Seasoning mix rather than just oregano. Will definitely stay in my recipe box, great to use for a quick sauce.

This def needs a little extra pick me up.  The sugar, onion powder, and basil helped.  Next time I will cut back the oregano to 1/2 T, it was just too strong for my taste.  Thanks for an easy recipe!

mmm!  This pizza sauce is so delicious!  Have made it twice now. First time was at my daughter's school - we followed the recipe exactly, but added about 1 tbsp fresh basil in the sauce from the kids' garden.  This second time, made it just as the recipe indicated and this pizza sauce is beyond delicious! Combined with the "Master Pizza Dough" recipe for her, fresh mozzarella and the pizza taste so yummy!

Really good pizza sauce as written, but is instantly a 5-star sauce with the addition of 1 T dried basil, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp minced onion, & a dash of crushed red pepper flakes. So simple and quick. Thanks for this new kitchen staple recipe! Will be using it often. :)

Wow!  This was so great and so easy!  I used a blender and added some extra spices and sugar (1/2 T basil, 1/2 t sugar, some italian seasoning) as some other reviewers recommended.  Because of this sauce, I made the best pizza ever!!  Makes a good amount-froze 1/2 for the next pizza I make!  Thanks!!

This sauce was amazing as a base to cook meatballs.  I made the sauce exactly to specifications and added 2 cups of chicken broth and let simmer for 30 minutes.  While it was simmering, I made meatballs and dropped them in the sauce, turned up the heat, and cooked them right in it.  After all that, I served it over pasta with some parmesan and it was devoured.  Great recipe and really, really simple yet diverse.

Awsome sauce! It's thick enough to stand up to your toppings and has really nice flavor. I added 1 tsp of sugar and was out of paprika so I didn't add that. (I couldn't believe I was out!!) Super quick..took like 2 min and I have plenty to freeze for at least 2 more pizzas..maybe more. :) I"ll be making this from now on.

I took the advise from SimpleFoods reviewer and tried the 1/2tsp. of baking soda...WOW, I had my very own volcano of pizza sauce, plus it tasted just nasty, so beware!!!  The recipe is great with or without any changes.  I did use some fresh basil and that sweetens it just enough.

I'm really surprised at all the 4 and 5 star ratings that say "but I added this, this, this and this!"  If you have to add anything, then it's not a 5 star recipe.

That being said, it's a great base.  It definitely needed sugar and salt, though.  It was way too bitter without them.  I will make it again, with the added ingredients.

I'm not a pizza sauce connoisseur by any means... I need a sauce for another recipe and this was quick/easy and I had all the ingredients in my pantry.  I would make again in a minute (literally!) if I needed it.

We loved this sauce.  So much better than a jar of spaghetti sauce that I usually use.  It tastes more like a real pizza.  I use 1/2 this recipe per pie and the other half goes in a mason jar and lasts a couple of weeks in the frige.  Excellent!

Absolutely loved this sauce.  Very easy and tastes great!  I did change things up little based on the reviews of others (even though it irritates me when people make changes to a recipe and rate it according to their changes, or how they thought it should rate as submitted).  I used 3 cloves of pressed garlic instead of the dried, cut oregano to a scant 2 tsp and added the same amount of basil, and added 1/2 tsp of both sugar and onion powder.  I am sure the recipe is great without all these changes, but I've got a thing for fresh garlic, and I prefer my sauce to not bite you back!

The bf rated this as a four based on taste.  Personally, I would rate the taste as a three since it was too strong for my preference.  However, I appreciate that it is a very easy sauce to make, using ingredients that I typically already have on-hand.

Oh my so good!!! I did add a pinch of sugar as some others did. My picky daughter wanted to lick the mixing bowl clean! The greatest sauce ever. Generously sauced one large pizza (Jay's signature crust) with a couple cups left over to freeze.

I love this recipe. I did make a couple of changes that were suggested and it turned out great! I sauted two cloves of garlic in a small amount of olive oil and then added the tomato sauce and tomato paste, 2tsp of oregano, 2tsp of basil, 1/2tsp of paprika, and 1/2tsp of onion powder. I will never buy pizza sauce again.

I made this with six medium tomatoes from the garden, peeled and seeded, instead of the canned tomato sauce and it's fantastic.  This recipe adds just the right amount of spices for a perfect pizza sauce.

This recipe came in very handy when I needed pizza sauce and was out. I always have tomato sauce and paste on hand, but not always pizza sauce. I just found the garlic was too strong, and I think the addition of a bit of sugar to the recipe would improve it greatly. Otherwise, great recipe. I only needed a 1/4 cup, so portioned the rest to put in the freezer which will come in very handy next time. Thanks!

Very good basic recipe. Will not buy pizza sauce again. The only thing I added was some basil.

This is a top notch recipe!! I did add some basil, red pepper flakes and a can of tomato puree for texture and it is so much better than anything you can buy. I like to make it a day ahead, you'll find the flavors really blend well overnight.

This is a great base sauce!  We like it with 1/2 tbs. dried basil, a 1/2 tsp. sugar and 1/2 tsp. of onion powder. We take all the ingredients and mix them in a blender.  So easy and yummy!

I did add other spices (crushed red pepper flakes, onion powder & basil) & while the sauce was ok, I think the oregano (& probably the basil) were overpowering, so I'll cut back next time. My husband said it tasted like Pizza Hut sauce and I don't think that was a compliment.

Loved it! Made the additions of the top rated review person and it's perfect! Oh, and I had enough to cover 2 large and 2 mediumish Boboli crusts- enough leftover to cover probably 2 more large ones!

I really liked this sauce. It was so quick and easy to make. The taste was great to. I did though cut the oregano back as suggested by others. Instead of 1 Tblsp. I did 1 tsp, which is a 1/3 of the original amount. It seemed to be the perfect measurement. I had no idea what dried garlic was. I have never seen that before. So, I just used an equal amount of fresh minced. I read some reviews that said their sauce was bitter. I have noticed that tomato pastes can vary by brand. I used Hunts brand and the taste is more milder. I just wish I could make half the amount for what I need. I will have to see if the store makes similar smaller cans. TY

Very easy and tasty pizza sauce for a beginner like me! A little honey or agave nectar makes for a slightly sweeter sauce. Add minced garlic or garlic salt if you like garlicky pizza sauce. This was tasty and yielded a lot - so prepare to refridgerate or freeze some for another night!

I halved quantities and followed the tips of adding basil and sugar. When I first tasted the sauce it just tasted like ketchup but i used it anyway and when it had been cooked on  my pizza it tasted lovely! almost had a bbq flavour. I would reccommend trying it but it definately tastes better after being cooked!

I have always used the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" recipe from this site. And even though I do think that recipe is delicious, I really do love this simple sauce! I took the advice of another user and added a little bit of sugar and some basil. I skipped the dried minced garlic and added 1 tsp. (maybe a tad less) of garlic powder. Thanks!

Great! As others used 1 1/2 tsp of oregano, basil, 1 clove fresh chopped garlic, paprika as listed and 1/2 tsp sugar. Will defiantly use again, just might make a little sweeter.

Excellent!! I used 1/4 tsp of baking soda and no minced garlic as  didn't have any, but subbed garlic powder instead and it was excellent! I always used sugar in place of baking soda to cut acidity, but tried this idea on a whim, and it will be the ONLY way I make tomato based sauces again! Wow! What a difference!  Excellent sauce!!

I was out of tomato sauce and paste so I substituted a quart of my home canned plum tomatoes-drained the off all juice and mixed in the oregano, basil, garlic and paprika in the blender. It was great!

Great pizza sauce!  We ordered pizza and it basically had no sauce to it so I needed something quick.  I used real minced garlic instead of dried and used 1 tsp. each of dried oregano and basil and added 1 tsp. of sugar.

Good recipe with suggested addition of 2 t. basil, reduce oregano to 2 t., add 1/2 t. garlic powder, 1/2 t. onion powder, and 1/2 t. Aleppo pepper or 1 t. red pepper flakes.  DO NOT ADD the baking soda somebody suggested.  It ruined my first batch and rendered it inedible.  I only added 1/2 t., too.   Yuk.

This was really good though on the second time I made it I cut down the tomato paste to 3/4 can instead of the whole thing. Also for the person who wanted to cut down the acid, 1-3 teaspoons of sugar really helps. I add it to all of my tomato sauce recipes, tasting after each teaspoon to make sure it won't be noticably sweet.

Excellent!  I added 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp sugar, like others have suggested, and it was perfect.   Great mix of tart and sweetness.   I used an immersion blender.  Then, I let it set for 30 minutes, so the flavors blended.  After that, I simmered it on the cooktop until the pizza crust was ready.   Delicious, this is my new go-to recipe!!!  The kids loved it so much they asked for portions of it to dip their pizza slices into.  It is THAT good !!!

Love it!  Very simple.  We make up a batch, then freeze the rest in silicone ice cube trays.  A quick defrost and there's pizza sauce!  No more digging through the fridge looking for the jar of pizza sauce, only to find it's gone all moldy...

This is my favorite pizza sauce.  Instead of the oregano and paprika, I often grind a tablespoon of italian seasoning blend into the tomotoe paste and sauce, then add my garlic.  The spice blends/grinders have alot of different spices including a red pepper flake that adds a nice zing.  Such a simple and tasty sauce!

Worked great and I was able to freeze half for later. You can't tell the difference between this recipe and the kind you buy in a bottle. Terrific!

Best. Sauce. Ever.  My family LOVED it!  The only thing I did different was add a tablespoon of dried oregano.  I made this right after I put my dough ingredients in the bread machine so the flavors had time to marry.  SO GOOD!  I will never buy take out again.

I added:
 1/4 tsp garlic powder,
 1 T oregano, 
1t basil 
 I also didn't have any tomato paste, so I just used 2 8 oz cans of tomato sauce.

(I added the garlic powder because I don't have dried minced garlic).  It was fantastic.

Very good, but modified accdg to cindy18lou.  In place of all spices, used 1/2 t garlic powder, 2 t dried basil,  1/2 t sugar, 1/2 t onion powder, 2 t dried oregano.  Whisked it up & put it in a large mason jar so I could shake it up a couple times to get the flavors to mix while chilling it for about an hour. Served w/ calzones - will use again, thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is quick and easy, which I like. I use this recipe on all our home made pizzas with one change, I add 3 teaspoons of olive oil which I think enhances the flavor. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe - I used it for pizza bagels and it was very tasty and easy. I used fresh garlic instead of dried. Then I froze the rest in ice cube trays for next time.

Tasty and very easy.  I added about a tablespoon of sugar to this recipe, just because I like a little sweeter sauce and it seems to take the "bite" out of the tomatoes.  Will make again.

My favorite kind of recipe! Quick, easy and delicious! Brent's recipe is a great pizza sauce using ingredients many of us keep in our pantries. You can make it even better by adding garlic, onion and fresh herbs. Fresh basil makes this basic sauce really tasty. If you're looking for a quick and easy sauce. Try this one.

EASY & DELICIOUS!!  I followed this recipe with the exception of using fresh oregano from my garden.  My plan was to taste and add what seasonings it needed to make it according to our likes.  To my surprise it didn't need a thing.  It just seemed too easy.   Perhaps that's why it's named "Easy Pizza Sauce" III.  I will be making my own pizza sauce from now on.  I froze what I didn't use in premeasured containers.  Thank you Brent for sharing your EASY &  DELICIOUS recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful. I also used "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" from this site and together it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this recipe. Follow the recipe as written! I think the amount of oregano is FINE. I'm surprised some people said to use less than what the recipe calls for, but I think it gives way more flavor. Just take it the sauce and if you think it has enough oregano, just don't add the rest.

I followed the recipe except that I used fresh oregano and fresh garlic.  Very good sauce, not too acidic and simplistic. I was able to savor the sauce because it complimented the mozzarella in our calzones, didn't stand out too much.

Increase oregano to 2 TBS, use 2 TBS garlic powder (instead of minced garlic), add 2 TBS basil. Use this sauce with Pizza Dough I recipe. Top with cheese, sausage or pepperoni. Delicious!

This is excellent but I recommend starting with one and one half teaspoon of oregano and working your way up.  (I thought one tablespoon was overpowering).  I'm thrilled to have the recipe.

EXCELLENT pizza sauce!  I always used canned because I didn't want the sauce to taste like marinara sauce, but for the first time I tried making it and this was an excellent recipe!!  I didn't have dried minced garlic so I used the same quantity garlic powder and it was great.  I made pizza on a busy day by making the dough in my bread machine (Pizza Crust for the Bread Machine II - this website) and this sauce.  Make this sauce!

I made this without reading the reviews..interestingly enough I did what most did. After tasting, I added tsp of sugar, minced garlic and onion powder. This is a good basic recipe, but you do need to doctor it a bit. However, in a pinch, it's a keeper and the family liked it. I would have given it a 4 star except I needed to add to it. I would use again though.

Great easy pizza sauce with lots or room to change and add things.  Thanks for making this so simple...I like a lot of sauce on my pizzas, so this recipe could cover 4 pizzas...but in my house we used so much it covered about 3.  The good thing is that it's easy to double the recipe.

We found this sauce to be a little bitter and tangy even with the sugar added.  I will try it again when I have more time to figure out how to reduce the bitterness of the sauce.  Overall a quick and easy sauce with the perfect consistency; just over powering to the rest of the pizza.

So EASY!  This is a really great sauce for how simple and quick it is .  I used only 8 oz of tomato sauce and in addition to the other spices added a tsp of salt, a couple pinches of red pepper flakes, and a few shakes of cayenne pepper.  This sauce is better than the more time-consuming ones I usually make.

Winner winner chicken dinner! Yep this has made me a believer. No more pizza sauce in a can for me. My husband even noticed that I used a different sauce. It is probably simpler to make this sauce than buy it one from the store.

This is the best sauce I've made. I also considered the review by DEED330 and added my one ingredient 1/2 tsp -Chipotle Chili Pepper. Also using diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce lowers the sodium content.    The family said it was the best they've had.

This sauce is great!  I made two changes--I used fresh, minced garlic instead of the powder, and I also took the advice of another poster and added a little sugar because tomato paste is so bitter.  This really is a delicious recipe, and very quick!

This recipe lived up to it's name.  It couldn't be any easier and it tasted great.  I did add a little basil but the great thing about this recipe is you can add whatever you like to spice it up or keep it mild for the kiddies!  This was plenty of sauce too.  Enough for 2 decent sized pies.

I pair this with the Simple Pizza Crust that is on this site and it doesn't get any better.  In full disclosure, I worked for and managed Pizza Hut for about 4 years and this is the best combination I've ever done.  (Yes, I know Pizza Hut isn't the best pizza but I thought the comment was funny.)  You will not be disappointed with this sauce.  Now my kids are getting into the pizza biz making the sauce.  Thanks for these great memories.

Very easy to make!  I put all the ingredients into a jar instead of using a bowl.  This made it easy to store any extra that was left over.

I used the same amount of ingredients. However I added olive oil to a pan, sauteed garlic,oregeno and paprika. Then added the tomato paste and tomato sauce. Let it simmer for about 5-10 minutes. It made the sauce better.
Thanks for sharing the receipe

This sauce is so easy. I used smoked paprika and it was a mistake as it took over the flavor of the sauce.  I will make it again and use regular paprika.  This is a no-fuss, easy sauce.  I will make it again.

I've never made pizza from scratch before and never made pizza sauce!  I did both tonight and was very pleased with the results.  This sauce was very simple, but I am giving 4 stars because I found in bland.  I didn't have any granulated garlic, so I used garlic powder, and I used 1 1/2 tsp, which should have been more garlicy, but I still felt it could have used more.  I left the oregano at a tbsp, plus added basil and a bit of sugar.  My husband still thought it could have used more spices.  I think next time, I'll use fresh garlic and my garlic press to give it enough for our taste.  All in all though, I'm thrilled to find out how easy this is to make!  I'll be doing so again.

This is a great recipe just as written. I have tried several others but this is the one I will use as my go to pizza sauce. Made it several times and have cut the tomato paste in half which works great because I always double the sauce so no need to store a half used can. Also I add basil, onion powder and brown sugar. Then I brown up the garlic in some olive oil, throw everything together and simmer for about half an hour. Its really good!

liked the basics of this recipe, I added basil, red pepper flakes and the slightest bit of sugar, came out amazing, also, I used crushed tomatos for a little more consistency! I have used this recipe before and used diced tomatos lightly pulsed in my food processor, and that worked just as well! LOVE home made pizza!!!

Best pizza sauce recipe so far, I think although I did alter it.  2 tsp. oregano, 2 tsp. basil, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp. sugar.  I used the McCormick garlic powder.  And of course the 1 teaspoon of paprika.

Horrible! I don't know if maybe the "ground oregano" was supposed to be oregano leaves/flakes, but as written it is extremely bitter and overpowering. luckily i had extra sauce and paste, so I added some sugar, italian seasoning and more garlic and it was edible, but not that great.

This was my first attempt at making pizza sauce and it was really good!  I didn't have dried so just used 1t fresh crushed garlic, and I used tomato paste that had italian seasonings in it but still added the called-for spices.  The finished product was a little thick so I added about 1t olive oil to thin it out a bit.  Minor changes, but I'm sure it would have tasted great had I made it exact.  I used this sauce for a pizza dip that I made, but one day will make a pizza and use it for that as well.

this was SO easy, it was ridiculous!  didn't have the dried minced garlic, so i used what i had on hand...regular minced garlic from the jar (about two teaspoons).  Also, I added about a teaspoon of sugar to cut the tartness of the canned sauce/paste.

This is a pretty excellent pizza sauce for as easy as it is. It's a winner hands down. Of course I jazzed it up a bit, but who doesn't like to use their imagination. I liked using San Marzano tomatoes. Thanks for the solid recipe!

A good quick and easy sauce.  The only change I made was to add some chopped sun-dried tomatoes and cut back a little on the seasonings.  Worked out very well on the grilled pizzas.

I don't use dried garlic, so I added some garlic powder, as well as some basil.  This recipe is titled correctly because it really is about as easy as it gets...and good.

Made this one afternoon after realizing I forgot to buy pizza sauce for homemade pizza that night. Tastes awesome. I no longer need to buy pizza sauce ever again.
Thanks so much!

I followed a review and added 1/2 Tbs (dried) basil, 1/2 tsp sugar, and 1/2 tsp onion powder. I added the full amount of oregano, but I had dried oregano only--not sure if that is different from ground oregano. I also had fresh garlic--only put in 1 tsp...Sauce tasted swell on the hawaiian pizza I made! Not AMAZING, but no need to search for another recipe!

This was wonderful!  I LOVED this sauce.  After eating this, there is NO WAY I can ever eat prepared sauce out of a can or jar again.  I heated mine up, and added some basil and some sugar.  My kids and husband thought the homemade pizza I made tonight was excellent!!  So much better than take out!  Thank you !!!

I made this recipe and since I was only making a personal size pizza, I did not measure anything. I mixed some tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, onion salt, basil, garlic powder, paprika, a dash of chili powder and some sugar together and just went by taste. Adding more of something as I went along until I was satisfied with the taste. In the end, this turned out to be the best pizza sauce I have ever had. Great experimenting sauce! For a more sweeter sauce, add a bit more sugar.

Absolutely delicious sauce, thank you so much for sharing!  I did follow other comments, and added some basil, sugar and onion powder.  This was awesome!  Along with another recipe for pizza crust, as well as loaded with toppings, we had a wonderful homemade pizza for dinner tonight!

Good!  Be sure to make this several hours in advance, so it can sit, and the flavors can mesh together.

I love oregano, but I think this recipe had too much.  I would half the amount of oregano next time.

I really love this sauce! being diabetic it's nice to be able to control sugar intake. I make this sauce and put it on Naan bread with some shredded cheese and veggies and meat if my hubby is wanting it, then throw it under the broiler until the cheese is melted and it's GREAT!

I made "as is" except I didn't want gallons of sauce AND I didn't have any tomato sauce. So, I used one can of tomato paste and 3 oz. of water. Reduce the seasonings accordingly. I'll never buy pizza sauce again.

Good with tweaking! Here is what I added or modified – changed the oregano to 1tsp, put in fresh cloves of garlic, ½ tsp basil, ½ tsp white sugar, 2 tsp Italian season, and a smaterring of chilli flakes

Wow! This sauce turned out delicious on our pizza and I love that it was so quick and easy to make.I think it was just as good if not better as most of the pizza chains I've tried.I did just make half the recipe and I added about a teaspoon of sugar.I used this sauce on Jays Signature crust recipe which I also halved and it made a delicious pizza.I put mushrooms,black olives,pepperoni red bell peppers, onion and lots of mozzerella.It was absolutely delicious! After making this sauce I will never buy store bought again.

My husband was astounded that I had thrown the sauce together because it tasted so good. The kids thought the garlic was a little spicy. Maybe next time I'll cook the garlic a little in the microwave. I added a little basil, oregano, paprika, sugar and baking soda as recommended by other reviews.

This is an awesome recipe. But instead of using oregano,minced garlic and paprika, I used WinCo's pizza seasoning. It is really good! ~ Rachel 9 yrs old

I also added some extras. Added the sugar and used garlic powder. Also added some Italian seasoning and some extra cilantro. Plus I added a couple of splashes  of red wine vinegar, red wine and a dash of olive oil. I heated the sauce because I cooked it on the grill and flipped the crust after 6 minutes on med-low. Then added the sauce and cheese (1 part parm to 3 parts moz). Added some dice ham while heating the sauce. This was the best pizza I've made to date.

I don't know if I did something wrong but this was just ok.  It had a raw, odd taste.  I thought it would improve with cooking but it didn't.  I really wanted to like this one.  It didn't have sugar in it which I liked.  I did use a dash of baking soda to cut the acid but otherwise followed the recipe pretty close.  I used garlic paste in place of dried minced.  I think I prefer a cooked sauce that allows the flavors to blend.  This just wasn't that tasty.  It wasn't awful, it just wasn't that good.

I'm not too impressed with this recipe.  I tasted it as written and decided it really needed something extra.  So I followed DEED330's (the top reviewer's) recommendations by adding basil, sugar and onion powder.  I also added some red pepper flakes for a kick.  It still wasn't as good as canned pizza sauce, so I think I'll be sticking with that.

Quick and easy!  I make several hours in advance and let it sit with my spices.  I use some red pepper, thyme rosemary and parsley in addition to the spices listed in the recipe.  Definitely my go-to pizza sauce!

I made two batches of this recipe. One, I went exactly by the recipe and the other one I obtained from DEED330's post. I have to say, when going by the recipe, the sauce seemed to lack something. It was tasteless. I then went by DEED330's suggestion and added the additional ingredients and it was superb!

Quick and easy, as stated.  After making it once as written, I made it a second time throwing in a bunch of spices (basil, oregano, thyme, marjoram, chili powder, onion salt, more garlic). That kicked up the flavor and spiciness, and didn't take much more time.

This pizza sauce is great!  It's the only kind I use now.  Sometimes I grate a little Parmesan cheese into the sauce.  You can also freeze any left over sauce for the next time you make pizza.

This is a good recipes but does need a couple of tweaks.  First 1T. oregano is to much, I would say to just do 1/2t. oregano since it is very strong. And also instead of using 1 can tomato paste just use half since that is also very strong.  And also added the extra ingredients like the other reviewers suggested, using italian seasoning, sugar, etc...

This is a great recipe if you're in a pinch for time. I felt that it needed a little more flavor, so I added a little basil and garlic powder (just a healthy pinch of each).

Well, lots of people giving 5's but only with lots of changes and additions.  I don't think that's a fare rating really.  This is a great basic, easy sauce.  I would say it's a base sauce to which anyone can taste it after putting all the ingredients in and add what they personally like or think it needs.

I followed the advice from other reviews and used 1/2 tsp sugar.  Also, I used italian seasoning in addition to 1/2 tsp dried sage and some garlic salt.  Tasted very good!  My kids loved it.

This is the easiest and tastiest sauce i have ever had!! I followed the advice from one of the reviewers to add 1/2 tsp of sugar.  It balanced the acidic.  I used fresh garlic not dried, didn't have it in stock. but, BAM it tasted good.  love this recipe!

It's foolproof - really. No matter what seasonings you add. I don't like so much oregano, so when I doubled the recipe I didn't double the oregano. Added the basil and onion powder as advised. Just plain delicious!

this was perfect!  super easy to make and turned out delicious.  I followed others' suggestions and cut the oregano in half, added 1/2 a tsp. of dried basil, 1/2 a tsp. of onion powder and 1/4 tsp. sugar.  This did make a LOT of sauce.  Way more than we needed for a 12 inch pizza.  Next time I will use a smaller can of tomato sauce and cut the recipe in half.

Based on recommendations from other reviewers I made the following alterations:  2x 8oz cans of low-sodium tomato sauce (store was out of 15oz cans).  1x 6oz can of low-sodium tomato paste.  2 tsp oregano, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp sugar and 2tsp basil.  Just made a pizza with the Crusty Pizza Dough recipe that came with my friend's KitchenAid Artisan stand mixer and this sauce.  It was amazing.  Great recipe!  I and my friends tend to prefer more spicy to less, and this works in that direction; but if you are a fan of hearty flavor and a little bit less kick, the regular recipe is probably the best you're going to see!

I love this sauce!  We add a little sugar, italian spice & onion powder to  taste and then we put it on everything that requires red sauce!  It is great w/the the grilled pizza and most recently we added it to our pizza casserole, its the perfect amount!

I didn't use this to make a pizza.  I used it instead of canned pizza sauce in a casserole recipe.  Based on other reviews, I thought it might be bland, but I followed the directions EXACTLY.  I tasted it before I poured it into the casserole, and it was absolute perfection.  I suggest tasting it as written before you add sugar/other herbs as other reviewers suggest.  Don't add extras just for the sake of adding extras.  Try it first.  It might just surprise you.  I know I was surprised.

This sauce is amazing after a few minor changes. I took DEED330's advice and I added 1/2Tbs basil, 1/2tsp sugar + 1/2 tsp onion powder. I put everything in the blender to mix. It is so easy and so delicious. I've tried the exquisite pizza sauce and it was good, but it had so many ingredients and not everyone who tried it loved it. This sauce is a winner all around! I will never use another pizza sauce recipe.

Easy but too bitter for me.  Once you begin to add more than one additional item such as 1/2 tsp of white sugar and other personal touches, it's no longer the original recipe.  I find this is the case with this sauce. But okay on the fly.

This was delicious.  I made it just as the recipe stated except that I cooked it for an hour or so on top of the stove.  I thought that this might cut the acid some.  It was really great.  Thank you.

Great flavor in this sauce. I did use 1 clove of fresh minced garlic in place of dried. I also added 1 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp sugar, and 1/2 tsp onion powder. I blended it all together in the food processor.

Personally, I loved this sauce.  the kids didn't, however, they did eat it.  I love the garlic and onion in the sauce... and I added some crushed red pepper, maybe that is why they didn't care for it. However, I will be making this again.

This is a great sauce and is very easy to make.  I did add some  dried basil, garlic powder and sugar. I also made a mistake and add 2 cans of tomato sauce, and just 1 can of paste, but it worked fine and was thick enough. I have extra so I will use it for spaghetti, I know it will turn out great also.  I have never made pizza sauce before but will from now on.

Really good. Reminds me of a pizzeria sauce. Don't add too much baking soda if you need to - you make it taste fizzy. Just add about 1/8 tsp and I did add a little sugar, ground oregano, minced garlic but no paprika - oh, and I only had a tin of diced tomatoes which I drained well before placing everything in the food processor. Thankyou for a delicious sauce.

I agree with those who felt it was somewhat acidic.  If you prefer more of an acidic sauce rather than a mild sauce, then this might just be the one for you.  It was good as a breadstick dipping sauce.  If anyone has a sauce recipe comparable to Cassano's pizza sauce, please share with me as I prefer a sweeter sauce and would be very grateful for the recipe.  Thanks!

Wonderful sauce, tweak it all you want, but DO NOT add the baking soda as suggested by a review......I did that, and it was HORRID. Someone told me this years ago for chili also, same result, AWFUL.

I needed pizza sauce to serve with calzone/stromboli and this recipe was a SNAP to make!!!  I put it together in minutes and it tasted better than the jarred sauce with sugar added.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

Followed other reviews and added extra garlic, basil, and a small amount of sugar. It was wonderful. Doubt if I will buy pizza sauce again!

Quick and easy!  I add a little sugar or brown sugar when I make this. If you can find the tomato sauce with Italian seasoning, it is really good to use for some extra flavor.   Very good!

What a simple and delicious sauce!  I made the sauce as listed in the recipe, except I did 2 tsp. each of oregano and basil and 1/2 tsp of sugar as another reviewer suggested.  So tasty!  I make homemade pizza every week. I make and freeze in batches my own pizza sauce that is so much more time consuming to make.  This sauce may replace the one I usually make because its so simple and delicious.  Otherwise, I may end up making this one, freezing it like my other sauce and alternating.

Great sauce. The best I've made from here so far. Thick and kid friendly (no chunks). Has some flavor but does not compete, you can actually taste your toppings. This made enough for 3 large pizzas. This freezes well. Thanks so much Brent, this stuff is great.

This recipe worked out well for me. I used a double recipe to top 6 really large pizzas. I served the pizzas for my mom's surprise birthday party. Didn't hear any specific compliments about the sauce but didn't hear any complaints either. That's ok, sauce should be an accessory anyway, right?

I liked this alot for flavor, consistency, and took me 2 minutes from start to finish to whip up.  I threw everything in my food processor.  Subbed Italian seasoning for the oregano, used 2 cloves garlic instead of dried, and only had Hunt's brand 'sweet onion diced tomatoes'.  The flavor blend was wonderful; just right for pizza.  I didn't add any brown sugar because it was sweet enough w/using the Hunt's sweet onion diced tomatoes.  This stores well and makes enough that can be used for later.  Used the paprika also.

Made a few changes.  Used Italian seasoning instead of oregano, 1/2 t paprika, 1/8 c brown sugar.  Forgot the garlic.  Very nice pizza sauce.  Used over french bread to make a cheese pizza.

Made this tonight for our Friday night pizza and had start fresh after tasting it.  Its nice and thick, but beyond that it wasn't much.  It was bitter, I tried to salvage it by adding a little sugar, more spice and watering it down. Too much paprika.  Will stick to my cooked version.

Well, it was easy and definately better than any sauce you would buy in a can marked "pizza sauce". However, I think it's missing something. I will try fresh basil and maybe a pinch or so of sugar because it was a tiny bit bitter. I also may try cooking it for a while next time and then letting it cool before I use it. Overall though it was good and I will play around with this one. Thank you for sharing.

YUM and easy! Can't beat that. I was a little nervous about so much oregano and paprika but it was great!!!! I used a couple of tsp minced garlic from a jar instead of dried since that is what I had on hand - worked fine. I really like the taste and texture of this sauce. It was perfect for the calzone (Bread Machine Calzone from this site) I made both inside and for dipping. Can't wait to try it on an actual pizza next.

While the oven was preheating, I added all the ingredients in a saucepan over medium-low heat. When it was time to put the (bagel) pizzas in, the sauce was great.

This recipe is awesome! Don't waste your money buying store-bought pizza sauce. This pizza sauce is so quick and easy to make -- my husband loves it!  *Note: After it sits in the fridge for awhile, the garlic flavor can get really strong.  I like using garlic powder rather than the minced garlic because it mixes in better and doesn't give the sauce such a strong taste.

This is now my to go to pizza sauce, I think the ratio of tomato sauce and paste is perfect! Personally, I don't like eating paste raw. So I usually stir chopped onion and garlic in olive oil, add the paste and sauce, then add dried oregano, basil, salt, pepper and some brown sugar. And that's it!

So easy, and I like that you can control the salt and sugar content. I had a pizza seasoning mix on hand so used that. My kids love our homemade pizza with this sauce and the amazing whole wheat pizza crust from this site.

So yummy!  I didn't have any tomato paste, but it turned out well without it.  I added the suggested spices as well, garlic, basil, and sugar.  I loved it and will definitely be making this again!

This recipe as written is very bland, so that's why I have to give it 3 stars. You definitely have to doctor it up as per other reviewers and therefore, IMHO, make it a completely different recipe. Probably won't make again  since there are so many other recipes to try.

This was very good and very easy.  I do not always have "pizza sauce" on hand but I usually have all of the ingredients so this was just what I needed to tell me how to combine them.

More like a 3.5 star. I liked it, but now that I'm reading the reviews, I realize that I should've used a little less oregano, and maybe add a little sugar.

My go to recipe. I also added fresh minced garlic, 1 tsp dried basil and 1-2 tsp sugar. A dash of cayenne pepper is also good.

Sure, it doesn't have the complexity of a long-simmered sauce, but this recipe is fast, tastes good, and doesn't have most of the unwanted ingredients you might find in a commercially prepared pizza sauce. It is also easily customized with additions of fresh or dried herbs, chopped olives, capers, crushed red pepper, etc., and I love that I don't have to add any sugar (I cannot stand sweet pizza sauces).

This sauce was actually taste.  I didn't have dried minced garlic, but did have some in olive oil also added some parsley, onion powder and a tsp of sugar.  Either way it was great did have some left over we only made 2 pizzas, but my daughters loved it!

Love the ease of this recipe! Followed the recipe to a T, and am giving it 4 stars only because it was a little tangy for our personal tastes. This recipe made enough sauce for 3 medium sized pizzas. Also, since we usually use pepperoni on our pizzas, I'll probably leave out the salt next time since it's already pretty salty from that. Will definitely use this recipe again, but I'll figure out how to cut the tang first!

I finally had to print out this recipe because I use it so much.  I use all "no salt added" paste/sauce and it works great.  I freeze any leftovers and it thaws well to use later for little pizza bagels or english muffins for lunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Here in the south most pizza sauce is slightly sweet, which I found distasteful until I grew accustomed to it. This is more like the sauce I grew up with as a midwestener. I loved it so much. Thanks.

I tried this recipe today because I started making pizza before I realized I didn't have any sauce on hand. I reduced the water to approx. 1 cup because otherwise it would have been too watery.

Hubbie liked this better than the store bought stuff I used.  I did make some minor changes according to other reviewers.  Oregano & basil at 2 tsp each; onion powder 1/2 tsp; & 1/2 tsp of sugar.  This amount made about 3 large pizzas worth, so I'll double it & keep in a large canning jar

YUMMY! I mixed this up to make mini pizzas for my kids for dinner when we were really tight on money and short on food. It tasted GREAT! I did tweak it a little. I replaced the can of tomato paste with a second can of tomato sauce, added some sugar, pepper, onion powder, switched the fresh garlic for garlic powder and replaced the oragano (and basil as suggested by other reviews) with Italian seasoning. My family actually enjoyed it more than the sauce from papa johns or pizza hut! Even my extremely picky three year old ate it and said she "loved it"! Definately a Keeper! Thanks for sharing!!!

I make this delicious pizza sauce and put it in a plastic squeeze container, afterschool my kids whip up healthy homemade bagel bites (on whole wheat bagels) or multigrain english muffin pizzas, topped with turkey pepperoni and shredded cheese, then toast in the toaster oven.

Delicious - the only sauce I use for our pizza. I usually double the recipe and put away to toss with some pasta for a quick and easy lunch or side for dinner.  With a sprinkle of cheese and pepper flakes - we love it.

I used a can of roasted diced tomatoes with garlic and basil and drained it then pureed it in the food processor along with the paste and seasonings.  I took the advice of another and added 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1 Tbsp basil and I also ended up adding about a tsp of salt because it was just too sweet after the initial taste.  Good consistency and taste overall.

To ease the acidic taste of this tomato based sauce, I recommend adding more oregano, some basil, and a little sugar and baking soda.

Sauce was delicious! SO fast to prepare. I will never buy pizza sauce again!

We are on HCG diet Phase 3, which allows no sugar, so I added about a teaspoon of Stevia to sweeten it. Like other reviewers, I lessened the oregano to 1 tsp, but found it needed more, so added another. 

LOVED it!

I heeded another reviewer's suggestion to use the _dried_ minced garlic. My kids rave about this sauce. It's delicious and wonderful on Boboli pizza crust.

Outstanding sauce! I used to use jarred sauce all the time, but DH was recently put on a low-sodium diet so I came here looking for alternatives. I had to make a couple of tweaks--I used no-salt-added tomato sauce and organic tomato paste, and I added basil and sugar as other reviewers suggested. This is DELICIOUS on pizza. Thank you for sharing!

this was too thick and not enough time for the oregano to settle in the sauce. Needs some tweeking!!

I must confess in all the years that I have made homemade pizza, I never made my own sauce. Today wouldn't have been any different except that I forgot to buy some! This recipe was just perfect and got rave reviews. Next time I might try the suggestions of fresh garlic and basil. Easy and great!!

Loved this!  Used fresh basil and more garlic and I really think that made a difference.  We will definitely use this as our pizza sauce recipe!

Love this easy pizza sauce! I've been spending nearly $3 for a canned pizza sauce that my family really likes but not any more! This is delicious! I did add 1/2 teaspoon of basil, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder as another reviewer suggested, fantastic! Thank you so much Brent!

My three year old loved making this with me! Great recipe. I didn't have a can of sauce, so I used 1.5 cans of diced, mushed with mortar and pestle drained a lot of the juice and it was perfect! Now if only I had put Pam on the cooking sheet for the crust, we would have had a great pizza lol. But very good sauce.

Great pizza sauce recipe!  This is the first time I have made my own sauce and there is no need to look further.  I used it on Jay's Signature Pizza Crust and the pizza was so delish!  I took other reviewers suggestions and added basil, onion powder, and sugar.  Also, I didn't have any dried garlic so used fresh.

I made this and let it sit overnight - I also used fresh garlic, because I didn't have any dried.  The amount of oregano looked extreme, but it wasn't noticeable in the sauce.  The sauce came out very thick, exactly the consisency I wanted, but it was somewhat lacking in flavour - but true to it's name it is easy and fast to make in a pinch.

This is a great basic recipe. I added a couple pinches of fennel seed, 1T basil, & used 2 fresh minced garlic cloves instead of the dried garlic. Turned out great! The only downside is now I can't buy the jarred stuff - my kids say it's terrible & I have to agree.

We loved how easy and tasty this recipe is. We used it in our favorite deep dish pizza recipe. We added 1 tbl dried basil, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp minced onion and a pinch of red pepper flakes.

Easy and so much better than canned! I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of dried, and Smoked Spanish Paprika instead of Sweet to give it a kick. Fantastic.

Sorry but this recipe was horribly bland.  It tasted like eating the tomato paste right out of the can.  The only reason I gave it two stars was b/c I left out the paprika, and perhaps that might make a big difference, although I doubt it.  If you are a family of cheese pizza-eaters, and don't typically pile a lot of toppings on your pizza, this is definitely not the sauce for you.

My husband is a cheesemaker and brought home some fresh mozz. Homemade pizza was on the menu, and I needed some pizza sauce. I found this recipe, and had all the ingredients. It was a hit! Thanks for sharing! We will be using this again and again.

Delicious easy sauce that doesn't taste over-processed like the ones from a jar.  It only takes a couple of minutes, and it's delicious.  I used the Hunt's Garlic, Basil, & Oregano Tomato Paste which I thought added a nice extra kick of flavor.

Thanks for such a great recipe! I was looking for a sauce recipe to make at home because jarred sauces are too sweet for my taste. This one is just right, quick/easy and freezes well as one of the components in the french bread pizza kits I assemble/keep in my freezer to make up fresh for quick suppers or lunches.

Not one of my favorites.  Most of the people giving it 4 or 5 stars are 'tweaking' the recipe to make it great.  I tried the recipe without adding anything and the paprika really overpowers the sauce for me.  Just okay for me, sorry!

As is, the recipe is not very good. You need to add a lot of your own spices and try different things to taste.

Perfect.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I threw about 10 tomatoes in the processor (skin and all) and added 2 cans of tomato paste,  some Italian seasoning and garlic powder, a bit of salt until the sweetness was tamed, and it turned out to be a slightly chunky but very zesty and flavorful sauce for my pizza!

Kind of bland first go around with handmade pizza dough. Next time used sparingly w/flat bread and used an Italian 6-cheese blend topped with fresh shaved parmesan. Baked @ 350 for 10 mins then broiled on low for 2-3 mins. Very good!! I do like the garlic flavor of the sauce.

So easy, I used it as a marinara dipping sauce, but I know it would be great on pizzas. It makes just the right amount. I rarely need marinara, so I think I'll be using this recipe in the future instead of buying a big jar that will get wasted.

Excellent sauce I've used for two years now.  But tonight, the sauce was EXCEPTIONALLY good.  I needed a quick pizza type sauce for a baked pasta dish I was making.  I used this as the base recipe, added two cloves of garlic, and then an undrained can of diced tomatoes.  SUPERB!!!!  It worked SO WELL in my pasta bake!!  Very flavorful!!  My children and hubby LOVED IT!!  Thank you for this recipe!

If you like the taste of tomato sauce & tomato paste, then this is your "sauce" - it was a tiny bit better once it had cooked on the pizza itself, but it makes a TON & there was no desire to save any for future use. Back to the drawing board...

I made a few substitutions...I used three cloves of fresh garlic, finely minced, 2 tbsp dried whole oregano, 2 tsp dried basil, and 1 tsp red pepper flake.  My husband loved it, but I thought it was a little too thick.  Next time I make it, I will cut it with a little bit of water.

I feel bad for doing it, but I had to deduct two stars from this close-to-great recipe because it's bland as is, and it doesn't have sugar in it! Oh, how tart this would taste without sugar! I had the time, so I threw the tomato sauce/paste in a pot with 1 tsp baking soda to reduce the acid (per another's review), 1 tsp sugar (started with 1/2, but wasn't enough--prolly cause of the baking soda), 3 fresh garlic cloves, 2 tsp of basil, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and only 2 tsp oregano. I replaced the paprika with 1/2 tsp black pepper. I was able to cover 2 - 16in pizzas, and froze the leftovers which will cover 1-2 16in pizzas if I put the sauce on thin.

I think I would like this better if it called for half the tomato sauce, I like a thicker, richer sauce.  This was not a stand-out sauce, but a good place to start adjusting to our taste.

This sauce is an excellent base. I added some basil as others had recommended. I also added crushed red pepper flakes to give it some more flavor and also added just a bit of sugar. It balanced out very nicely and wasn't sweet at all. My boyfriend doesn't like sweet sauce and he loved this sauce.

I have looked high and low for a good pizza sauce recipe and this one is excellent and so easy!  I added a pinch or two of sugar and a couple of shakes of parmesan cheese.  I like that this makes a big batch so I can freeze the leftovers for later.

I had a 12 oz can of tomato paste and rather than use up two cans of sauce to double the recipe, I just used one and added water until I got the consistency I wanted.  It worked well and saved me money.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and froze about half of it in an ice cube tray to easily reheat later.

I needed sauce fast, so I used one drained can of diced tomatoes, used the seasonings in the recipe, left out the tomato paste (didn't want to fight the tartness), and added 1.5 tsp of dried basil, a few dashes of cayenne, and 1/2 tsp each of onion powder and salt. I threw it in the food processor for a few seconds and it was wonderful! Thank you for the great recipe.

The name  says it all! Easy! The only change I did was to add dried basel and parsley and some salt (I used no salt added tomato sauce). It was super good! I made it with Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust here on Allrecipes. I will definitely be making this over and over again!

Good recipe.  I used Italian seasoning, minced garlic {we love garlic}, red pepper flakes to taste and always add a little sugar.  Brown or white makes no difference.  The sugar cuts down the acid in the tomatoes so you don"t have that after taste.  This is a good starter recipe to use to bring to your own personal taste and if you have time let it simmer on low heat for a while to bring out all the extra  flavors. Sometimes I make an extra large batch and freeze pizza size portions.

Great flavor and easy. Added 1/2 tsp Basil; 1/2 tsp sugar; 1/2 tsp onion powder; 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion powder, as suggested by other reviewers.  Just over the amount needed for our huge cookie sheet pizza.  Thanks for sharing.

really easy recipe. however i found the sauce a little sour. i used "no salt added" tomato sauce and paste and maybe thats why it was sour and had no flavor. i added salt and it came out better. i will buy normal paste and sauce next time. i will use this pizza sauce recipe again.

My first time making pizza sauce.  Granted, I did add a lot more ingredients (e.g. sugar, garlic powder, salt, pepper, etc.) but I really enjoyed this recipe :) My boyfriend was skeptical of my pizza sauce because he's used to storebought kinds but he was pleased! I was too -- I thought it came out very well and I would definitely make it again.

I also cook for a VERY picky eater and for the first time he took a bite looked at me and said "this is GREAT". We both ate the remainder with smiles. I "tweaked" it a little as well cutting down to 2 teaspoons of oregano, adding 2 teaspoons of basil, and half a packet of splenda.

Sauce was good, it was my first attempt to make a homemade pizza. I followed what the other reviewers said and added 1/2 teaspoon of basil and 1/2 teaspoon sugar. I think it gave it a little bit extra. I actually put to much sauce on the pizza for us ( I made a large piza) and still even had alot left over, i think i will make spagetti with it. UPDATE: since we had alittle to much left over I was going to save it and use it again for another pizza so I put it in the freezer. Today we had Papa Johns pizza and breadsticks and were going to use it to dip the breadsticks in well, while in the freezer something must have happened because today it was real tangy nobody would eat any.

while this was slightly bland before cooking it turned out wonderfully after being in the oven.  I followed other reviewers advice and added more basil, onion powder and white sugar...really yummy and super easy to put together!

Perfect!  Makes a lot and it's thicker than what you can buy, which I consider a great improvement.  Just a note: I always add 1/2 teaspoon sugar to all my homemade tomato sauces. It's not enough to sweeten, just takes away the raw/bitter taste I often find with cooked tomatoes.

I did not like this pizza sauce.  The oregano was too overpowering. I think maybe 1/4 of a tablespoon would probably work.

I gave this three stars only because the first time I made it as is.  It was bitter and the family wasn't fond of it.  However, I decided to try it again adding 1T of sugar to cut the bitterness of tomato paste.  Perfect!  The family requested pizza again that week.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was great! I realized at the last minute that I didn't buy pizza sauce and very quickly looked this up and my 3 and 5 year olds go to help make the sauce since it was SO easy. How cool is that!

Not very good! Used fresh garlic and followed the recipe. The sauce is very acidic, so I added sugar and 1 teaspoon of baking soda, to try to neutralize the acid. This helped a little, but the sauce still is not very appetizing. I will not make this again.

This sauce worked, but I think it's missing something.  I tried adding olive oil and basil, but maybe next time some rosemary and salt and pepper as well.

I just mixed this up, adding 1/2 T basil and 1/2 t sugar, as suggested, and it tastes amazing!  I have a pizza crust mixing in the bread maker and I hope it turns out because this will be an awesome pizza.  I usually buy a big gallon can of pizza sauce at Sam's club and then freeze it in 1 c portions, but I'm thinking I will buy the tomato paste and sauce in bulk and mix a large quantity of this to freeze in 1 c portions.  Pre-portioning works out handy for pizza, breadsticks, or dipping grilled cheese in.  mmmm.  The best pizza sauce I have ever had.

This is a good option when you are in a pinch or hurry. I think it would be better if it simmered a bit, but it works! I added some chopped tomatoes to it just to get a little extra nutrition into those kids!

I loved this sauce. My husband loves this sauce. He has some acid reflux problems so I tried reducing the garlic to 1 tsp., the oregano to 2 tsps and added 1 tsp of basil. He didn't get sick so I will make it that way in the future. Thank you

This gets 5 stars for easiness but 3 for flavor....it's bland/taste too much like tomato sauce.  I added a bunch of garlic and some italian Seasoning.  Not sure I'll make this again.

Very quick and tasty! I only had a partial can of tomato paste (left over from another recipe) but it still turned out fine.  Added a bit of minced garlic as well as sugar and spices per other reviews.  Nice to know I don't have to buy jarred sauce anymore!

I needed to feed 3 hungry teenage boys who wanted to make pizza and I was out of prepared pizza sauce.  I only had 2 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce and 1 6 oz. can of tomato paste.  I didn't have oregano either.  So, I mixed 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning with the tomato sauce/paste mixture.  They all ate it and loved it!  Thanks for the easy recipe.

Super easy and very good.  I did use fresh garlic and added some onion powder,and a little water to make it a bit thinner, but loved how easy and quick it was to make, and I have lots of leftovers!

Beats the heck out of the stuff at the store! It improved one of my recipes, pizza burgers, so much I couldn't believe it. I followed some of the suggestions like adding sugar. Wow, I will never buy again, it was soooo easy.

Although I liked the flavor I found it a bit too salty for my taste. My son and husband did not like at all. The saltiness really does kill it for me.

This didn't taste like NY pizza sauce at all.  It tasted ALOT like Pizza Hut sauce, which really wasn't what I was looking for.
So...the serach continues to find an authentic NY/NJ pizza sauce.

For years we have made "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" which is very tasty... but we were in need of a switch for our Saturday night pizza night and gave this one a try. It is great, but I do add garlic powder and onion powder to taste.

I gave it 5 stars because it was really fast, and it tasted a lot better than you'd expect, for being so fast.
However, I did make the following changes: pizza seasoning instead of the seasoning called for (Italian seas. would probably work just as well tho), garlic powder (I didn't have the minced garlic), salt and pepper, and sugar.  Another poster asked about cutting the acidity-sugar does that, in both pizza sauce and pasta sauce.
Probably won't be winning any taste awards, but it worked just fine for our English muffin pizzas!

This was not a very good recipe, I think it has way too much tomato paste, and not enough spice. I will not be using this recipe again, the whole family hated it.

I made this last minute because I didn't want sauce from a can, but I didn't want something super time consuming.  We had friends over and this sauce absolutely MADE the pizzas wonderful!!!  I have added this to my recipe collection.  It's proof that you don't have to slave over something for it to be wonderful!  Thank you!

A wonderful combination, makes a rich and thick sauce we all love.  I use fresh garlic not dried and more like 2 heaping teaspoons (but we love garlic) and also add a good heaping tablespoon and a 1/2 of dried basil.

This is the best pizza sauce!  I put in fresh minced garlic instead of the dried, a little sugar, and a few more spices (whatever sounded good at the time).  My husband loved it too!  I will use this recipe any time I make pizza from now on.

Wow, I didn't know making pizza sauce could be so easy!  Actually, I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a can of condensed tomato soup instead.  I also have a canister of Italian seasoning that I used (a mix of basil/oregano), and I sprinkled quite a bit more in along with fresh minced garlic.  It turned out so yummy!!

I like my sauce spicier, so I added more red pepper flakes, more oregano, more garlic and more garlic salt...plus I added alot of Italian Seasoning as well.  Very quick and easy!  I will definitely make this again!

This was a good basic recipe.  I was in a hurry when I made this and didn't have time to read the reviews.  Next time, I will probably add sugar, a pinch of salt, and some basil to more suit our tastes.  All in all, good flavor and consistency.  I doubled it and froze the rest for the next time I make pizza.  Thanks for the recipe!

The bf loved it, but I'm undecided. I added some brown sugar and used some basil/some oregano as opposed to just oregano. Maybe I'll try fresh basil next time? At the very least, its very quick/easy to make and it's semi-decent. I'd think of it as a basic recipe to be built upon.

Really good. Instead of a whole tblspn oregano, I used 1/2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano. Garlic powder worked fine in this too. Used this on Jay's Siganture Pizza Crust.

This is a great easy pizza sauce recipe.  I used 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped oregano and 2 teaspoons of chopped garlic.  I then let sit overnight.

We think this is pretty good sauce, very simple. We made homemade pizza dough in the breadmaker and needed something quick for sauce. It makes a lot so we had pizza again after a few days but that's okay cause we like pizza!!

Pretty easy to make and the taste was okay.  I still think just buying the Hunts pizza sauce is the best one I have had so far-probably not the answer you are looking for!

I was skeptical about using this recipe since in contained paprika, but it was excellent! It had a nice fresh and light taste. I added 1 tsp suger and some fresh basil from the garden as other reviewers had suggested. Thanks for the recipe..Its a keeper!

Perfect sauce. I was out of tomato sauce and paste. I used leftover spaghetti sauce (no meat) and followed directions. It was perfect for my pizza biscuit casserole! I will use again and have already recommended this recipe.

This is a very good recipe.  Much better than any homemade pizza sauce I've had before.  I substituted granulated garlic for the minced garlic.  I will make sure to have it on hand next time!  This makes a lot of sauce.

This was a pretty good base recipe. I added much more garlic and oregano. I also added some basil- and it needed a little sugar to take the bitterness out of the tomato sauce. I really liked the texture though, and overall- it is a good start to some good pizza sauce.

This sauce is so fresh tasting and infinitely better than ready-made.  I didn't have any tomato paste so I just ommited it and decreased the spices by 1/3.  Excellent!

OMG!  This is the best pizza sauce!!  I usually just buy the kind in a jar and will not ever do that again!  So easy to make.  I added a bit more garlic to mine, but won't do that next time because it would have been just right with the amount recommended in this recipe!  YUMMY and enough for a couple large pizzas.

This sauce is great!  Incredibly easy to make and the taste is better than any store-bought I've used.  I substituted Italian Seasoning for oregano, but I'm sure the sauce would have been delicious just as written.

Yum!

This was way better than I expected.  The only change I made was to use a couple of cloves of roasted garlic instead of the minced fresh garlic.  I also added a little brown sugar as another reviewer suggested.  Wonderful!

Simple but great! After trying to create a pizza sauce when our favorite pizza sauce was not available in the Netherlands, this was a great find. Paprika was the missing ingredient in all other recipes. Freezes well too!

I used another users suggestion of adding basil, sugar, onion powder, but then I heated mine on the stove to allow the flavors to heat up together.  I'm pleased with it!  I will make some others just to see what one I like best, but this is a positive start.

This pizza sauce was amazing. As someone who has never made pizza before this was a very easy recipe and tasted very good. It does not take long to cook and a great pizza sauce that tastes great with pepperoni and cheese.

We are retired so didn't need that much sauce for one 9" pizza I did not add the tomato sauce. I added 1/2-3/4 can of water to the tomato paste. I did add all the spices but cut back on them too.

It was ok for an uncooked sauce,  however  I like my sauce a bit on the sweet side, so might add some sugar next time.

I added 1/2 tsp of basil, marjoram, oregano and onion powder and cayenne powder. I used 2 tbsp of honey instead of sugar. Used 2 fresh minced garlic cloves and 1/2 tsp salt.  Tastes great. Start with 1 tbs of honey and go from there. I like 2 because when you start piling on the cheese and other salty toppings it makes for a great balance.

This recipe definitely suited our needs for making a Spaghetti Squash Pizza Pie, but we had to make changes as it seemed the amount of oregano was going to be way too much. Reduced the amount of oregano to 1-1.5 tsp and added about 1 tsp basil. Definitely fast and easy to make, but needs some minor tweaks.

The flavor was a bit strong. I doubled the recipe, not sure if that had anything to do with it.  My teenage daughter threw out her dinner.

First time making homemade pizza sauce, and your recipe was a great help! Thanks for sharing. I ended up adding onion powder, and cayenne as your recipe didn't quite have the flavor I was looking for. Next time I will also add some fresh basil.

I follow this recipe loosely.  It's helpful to taste and adjust the seasonings as you go.  I usually add a little sugar also.  I have also replaced the sauce with diced tomatoes that are blended with an immersion blender.   Really good!

I added some parmesan cheese to the sauce. It was good. It was easy. Next time I would probably add a little basil and onion powder.

I only did it with the tomato paste the smallest can,  paprika and basil. Paprika gives the spicy touch to the pizza sauce, without being too spicy making it delicious. No need of cooking makes it so much easier.  It was enough for 5-6 medium pita breads.  Top it with mozarella, then peperoni, grape tomatoes and any other desired ingredient. Healthy homemade recipe. Enjoy

I made this when my kids requested homemade pizza and I didn’t have a can of pizza sauce in the cupboard. It was so easy with simple ingredients and delicious. It made enough to cover two 12-inch pizzas. Highly recommend!

Easy and excellent!  I had some leftover so I used it to dip breadsticks in and it was so good. I did use the tip of adding a little sugar and onion powder. Will definitely be using this for now on. Thanks for sharing!

Super easy. Consistency on the thinner side of pizza sauce which we prefer. (But I used fresh tomato sauce from our fresh tomato strainer so our tomato sauce was more runny to start with). Smells good. Kids like it.

This was easy and tasted great!  When I first tasted the sauce before going on the pizza on it's own, I thought the flavor was a little too strong, but the final product on the pizza, was great and robust.  Will definitely make again!

This is a very good pizza sauce recipe.  I used it a few times and the second time I used granulated garlic instead.  Turns out perfect either way.

It's easy and looks good, but it's way too sweet and tastes of tomato sauce- do you know  what  I mean  - that odd canned tomato sauce taste?

I should have read other people's reviews so I could have added Extra things. The recipe itself is not good , it lacks flavor and it's too pasty.

This is so good, and is so easy to make! I've now made it twice.  I did add a little bit of basil and a two cloves of garlic, and ended up adding a little sugar, as well.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!  My whole family loves it.

It was really good. I added 1/2 tsp of onion powder and 1/2 tsp of sugar to cut the tomato paste. Also added 1tsp of crushed red pepper because we like the spice. My mom loved it and she is not a fan of pizza!

I didn't like this pizza sauce. I thought it was very bland and tasted more like pasta sauce. I added 1/2Tbs basil, 1 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp onion powder like another reviewer suggested and more garlic, plus salt and pepper and it didn't really taste any better.  I won't make it again. Hopefully I can find another recipe to suite my tastes. Also, this made enough for two 16 inch (large) pizzas.

I heated mine through while I preheated the crust (about 5 min). The paprika added just the right amount of sweetness to the sauce. I've tried soooo many different sauces from scratch over the years, but this will be my go-to until summer tomatoes are back!

Perfectly easy and delicious before I tweaked it. Sauteed some spinach in olive oil. Used the immersion blender to blend it in and hide it from the kids. Too much will turn the sauce brown but I figure a little spinach is better than none!

Made it according to the recipe and it was GROSS. I mind as well used straight tomato paste for the sauce. What a disappointment and my kids were looking so forward to homemade pizza.

Followed suggestions of other reviewers and "tweaked" it a bit. Used Italian seasoning instead of Oregano and added a little onion powder. Yummy and quick

I read the other reviews and tasted it before using.  I added 1 teaspoon fresh minced garlic, 1 teaspoon dried basil, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. and salt and pepper to taste.  Very yummy and easy to make since you don't have to precook it.  Look forward to making it again!!

This was an awesome, super easy pizza sauce. I added a tsp of dried basil and 1/2 tsp of sugar. I don't know if I'll ever buy a can of pizza sauce again! Plus I froze the extra sauce for the next time we have homemade pizza. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  Made it as is and felt like it was missing something.  Added 1 T of basil, 1 1/2 tsp. of sugar and 1 tsp. of onion powder.  Next time I will reduce the oregano to 2 tsp. and the basil to 2 tsp.  Very easy.  Thanks!

I cheated and used a can of petite diced tomatoes with garlic & olive oil and simmered it down then added the paprika & oregano and hit it with the immersion blender.  Awesome!

Thanks for the simple quick recipe!  I wasn't  able to find pizza sauce in my pantry so I substitute it  with a can of chopped tomatoes. It gave it a nice chunky tomatoe texture. Very good overall.

It was easy and flavorful.  I used it on a cauliflower crusted pizza with mozzarella cheese.  It tasted great and was so easy, and my family enjoyed it. I  will do it again!

Pretty good. Next time I think I'll do less oregano and do a half recipe (for two pizzas). I added some basil and a little cayenne pepper to spice it up.

I ran out of sauce and thought "All Recipes can help me" Once again you have saved the day. I did the recipe as written and enjoyed it very much. Maybe some sugar and fresh garlic next time.

Easy Pizza Sauce III Haiku: "Why such high reviews? Oh wait, now I can see why. Lots of people tweaked." I followed this recipe exactly as written and we found it gummy, artificial-tasting, and too heavy on the paprika. I used it in AR's "Pizza Pasta Bake" recipe which thinned it out and made it palatable since it was mixed in w/ lots of other ingredients, but for all the 5-stars here, I'm now seeing that plenty of additions and changes went into those reviews. If I made it again, I'd change it so much (sugar, fresh garlic, less paprika, basil etc ...) that it would ultimately be an entirely different recipe.

Found this recipe on a whim on the site. I read the reviews and as suggested added a little sugar and thyme. Also I didn't read the can correctly and bought one can of whole tomatoes instead of tomato sauce since I decided to double the recipe. No problem! I just brought out the hand blender and mashed those tomatoes. My family approved this recipe and it will be a keeper for sure!

It was very quick and easy but it lacked a little in flavor. I added fresh minced garlic to it but I think it needed some sugar and salt. Will try this again.

Not bad, but not great. The sauce was a little thick and gloppy. I was afraid a tablespoon of oregano would be too much, so I started - and stopped - with 2 teaspoons. Made the rest as directed, but it was fairly bland. Most of the taste was (still) oregano and tomato paste. I'd make again if I was in a pinch, but would doctor it a little.

I found it a tad bland. I added a teaspoon sugar and I would recommend letting it sit for an hour or so in fridge to blend the flavors.

Fantastic! Of course, every chef adds her own little thing, I used Italian seasoning instead of oregano, and minced garlic paste, (ONLY A LITTLE) plus a tiny bit of sugar! Yummy! Better than the pizza places around here!!

Wow this was great.  I didn't have dried minced garlic so I used a teaspoon of garlic powder instead.  This was absolutely fabulous, I won't be buying store bought any more.  Thank You Brent!

Easy but a bit bland.  Perfect for kids who don't like things too spicy.  I recommend putting some spices out when you serve your pizza so people can zest it up a bit if they prefer.

I was surprised at how easy and good it was. I started with Trader Joes Organic Tomato Sauce which was a first and I could immediately taste the difference in a good way.  I pressed several garlic cloves through a garlic press and sauteed the cloves in olive oil first.  Then I took the basil tip from DEED330 and added a couple of tablespoons of Costco's Pesto Sauce.  Fabulous!  I used this in my low carb pizza recipe.  It's a keeper, thanks!

As written this sauce is pretty good. I think the next time I make it I'll take the advise of other reviewers. I really liked how fast and easy it is to make. And it's made with ingredients that most people have in their pantries.

Definitely listen to the advice and add only 2 tsp. oregano. Made the sauce and put it in the fridge for a couple hours while making the dough, etc. Added 3 tsp. of sugar to try to fix oregano, just won't ever try this recipe again.

Super easy and tastes great!   So much yummier than those gross pre-made ones that can taste very strong.  Very good flavor.  This one gets Mr. Yum Yum's seal of approval!

I loved this recipe. This is now my primary pizza sauce. It was a big hit with the family. I took the suggestions of adding red pepper flakes and onion. Great taste and texture. Definitely a winner in our book.

Wow! Very good AND healthy! No nasty sugar, salt or preservatives. To turn up the health benefit I add equal amounts of pepper and turmeric with a dash of ground flax seed.

This pizza sauce is the perfect combination of easy and delicious! I did follow another reviewers recommendation and changed the spices a little. I reduced the Oregano to 2 tsp, added 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder, added 2 tsp Basil, added 1/2 tsp granulated sugar. I ommitted the paprika (didn't have any). Our family LOVES this pizza sauce!

This sauce was okay. I did a little bit of tweaks to it though. Since i didn't have tomato sauce i used ketchup and i added 1/2 teapoon of sugar (like DEED330 did).When I did this it came out good :)

I liked this recipe. I'm kind of finicky about pizza sauce - not too tomato-y, not too spicy, herby or sweet. I followed the recipe exactly and it was easy to prepare and I found it quite delicious.  Thats not to say that I'm a pizza sauce connoisseur. I just know what I don't like in my sauce.  I didn't find it too commercial tasting either. Just a good basic sauce.  And I always try to make whatever i can instead of buying.

I made this sauce the other night and took the advice of some reviews. (to add basil) but i made the mistake of not adding sugar. It was kind of tangy without. I will definitely be making this again as it is much better then canned/bottled pizza sauce. But next time i will be adding sugar.

This is a good base for a pizza sauce but was incredibly bland.  To bump it up I added an additional 1/2 tablespoon of Oregeno, 1 tablespoon of Italian Seasoning, additional 2 teaspoons of Garlic.

Awesome!!! Only word to describe it. I used it for some french bread pizza and came out perfect. I added these few more ingredients and it came out very good. I didn't have dried minced garlic, so i used regular minced garlic and came out just fine. I also simmered it on low heat for around 15 mins., continually stirring it because it pops and goes all over the place. But u did that and it seemed to bring out the flavor. Def. my pizza new sauce. Here is some of the ingredients i put in it. I added 1/2Tbs basil, 1/2tsp sugar + 1/2 tsp onion powder.

4 stars as written.  5 stars my way! :-) I also added 2 tablespoons of basil and 1/2 tablespoon white sugar.  For a spicier sauce, I added 1 tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes.  The amazing final touch was 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese (Kraft brand...not fresh).  Yum!

Great basic sauce that complimented the toppings that I chose. I would recommend this type of sauce if you have a lot of complex flavor combos going on in your creation. For instance, I prefer a more complex sauce if I'm making cheese pizza, in which case I would use a different recipe.

This makes a lot of sauce. My family agrees that it calls for too much garlic for our tastes but by reducing the garlic it tasted much better.

I really like this easy sauce. I prefer it with half of the stated amount of paprika. What a great find! Thanks for the recipe.

Wow! This is great! I didn't change anything, and I really really like it! Made this with Master Pizza Dough from this site, and it was not a mistake! Thanks! I won't be buying store brand pizza sauce again.

I made this recipe last night using the tips from DEED330. Delicious-maybe a little too much garlic. Next time I would cut back on the minced garlic and add a little more sugar. Delicious-my sisters gave me rave reviews!

use fresh garlic (2 cloves), 2 tsp of basil, 1/2 tsp of sugar, 1/2 a tsp of onion powder, and only 2t dried oregano. Still very easy! Used with 'Grilled Pizza Wraps' recipe on this site.
 DEED330   
 I added 1/2Tbs basil, 1/2tsp sugar + 1/2 tsp onion powder.

It was just OK, nothing amazing to me. It was really helpful to make a big batch for pizza, freeze it, and then use it for lasagna later in the week.

This recipe is better than store bought sauce!!  I went to make and realized I did not have the Tomato sauce or paste,  All I had was diced tomatos.  I threw the diced tomatos and seasoning in the blender plus 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp basil as others had suggested.  This sauce turned out awesome!!!

Made this sauce last night to put on my first ever home made pizza dough. I used fresh garlic, a bit of onion powder, and a dash of Italian seasoning. Because of the fresh garlic I let the sauce simmer while I was waiting for my company to arrive. They thought I'd been at the stove all afternoon cooking! Recipe is a real keeper.

Very good. Since the recipe makes much more than you'll need for one pizza, I froze the rest in serving size portions. Very good when reheated later.

This was so quick and easy to make. The flavor is really simple and works great for pizza. I definitely would NOT use this for pasta (as some reviews have stated) - no where near the flavor level that pasta needs! We made pizza dough in the bread machine, this sauce recipe with our favorite toppings. My husband asked if we could make it again two nights later with different toppings. This will be our standby pizza sauce for sure!

This is great basic recipe.  Instead of the garlic listed, I added 7 cloves of fresh garlic and did the whole thing in the food processor with a little fresh basil as well.

This was excellent, but I did as other suggested and added a bit of sugar, and used real garlic.  I'll never by pizza sauce again - this is stuff we always have on hand.  UPDATE:  I use a big squeeze of anchovy paste too.  I actually prefer granulated garlic over the fresh,  I make this every week, so I've got it down!

This recipe was wonderful.  I did make a few changes as suggested.  Instead of  oregano I used italian seasoning and replaced the dry garlic with minced garlic in a jar, I added 1/2tsp sugar and 1/2tsp onion powder.  It made a tasty pizza sauce and an even better spaghetti sauce.  The leftovers were even better.  Thanks!

This is a great-tasting and easy-to-make pizza sauce.  It’s fairly basic and can certainly be added to, but it’s wonderful as-is.  I generally add powdered or fresh minced garlic, onion powder, and additional Italian seasonings.

This was a very easy sauce to make and tasty on pizzas. I made one batch which lasted through 3 pizzas (store bought pizza crust). I froze the sauce after the first two and two months later it was still tasty.

this tasted way too strong of tomato paste.  I added the sugar and basil as others suggested, but it was still so strong all we could taste was the paste.  If we do this again we'd at least half the paste.

This was pretty bland. It was quick and easy and would be OK in a bind, but it needs more flavor. Makes a ton. To much for one pizza.

I wont buy store pizza sauce again.  This has the perfect viscosity for pizza sauce; its thicker, tangier,  and more robust than the store-bought bottled variety.  It also takes no time to prepare and I froze the remainder for future use. I added 1/2 t. sugar, 1 t. basil and 1/4 t. onion powder.

Delicous! With a few tweaks it was perfect, i will from now on be making my own pizza sauce! I added an additional 1/2 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and 1/2 tbsp of basil, and i also used fresh minced garlic instead of dry!

This comes together in a snap using ingredients that I always have on hand!  I did use 2 cloves of minced garlic along with 2 tsp each of basil and oregano and added 1/2 tsp of sugar.  Great thing is that this makes a ton, so I have frozen 2 containers for my next 2 pizzas!  Made this to put on Amazing Whole Wheat Crust from this site!

My first time making pizza sauce was a hit thanks to this recipe. I don't know if I can eat store bought sauce ever again. The garlic taste was perfect.

Excellent sauce recipe. I used tomato puree b/c I was out of sauce. I assume they're about the same. Maybe it was a bit thicker,  though. It was sweet, thick, just what I think pizza sauce should be.

I always try to grab the pieces of pizza that have the most sauce on them.  It's my favorite part of the pizza and this sauce is exactly like what I want it to be.  It's thick, flavorful and tastes really fresh!  Since I started making my own pizzas, I've been using sauce out of a jar.  Well, never again.  This sauce is just too easy and by far better.  Thanks!

I took the advise of other readers and added1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 T. basil.   I also used 2 cloves minced fresh garlic instead the dried stuff.  With these changes I give it 5 stars.  I am thinking without these changes it wouldn't have had enough flavor.

Quite a yummy sauce - tastes like pizzeria style sauce with the following modifications: Only 2 tsp oregano, add 1 tsp. basil and 1/2 tsp sugar. Don't apply too thickly as it is very flavorful. Recipe makes far too much for an average size recipe pizza crust (would probably cover two).

This pizza sauce was bland on my pizza. I used how much it said. All ingredients were measured exactly. When I made another pizza, I used a different pizza sauce and it tasted perfect. I was not happy with the results of my 1st pizza! My family and I all disliked the sauce. I personally will never try this sauce again!!!

Great sauce! At the suggestion of others I did add a bit of sugar & a pinch of basil. Have made this several times now, think it would be hard to go back to canned after this!

No tomato sauce but used olive oil instead to thin the tomato paste to the right consistency. Added some garlic powder and basil. Nice!

All I had on hand was a 8 oz. can tomato sauce and a can Campbells tomato soup.  I used that and spices as listed.  This was very good and I'm sure with exactly the right ingredients, it would be even better.  Thank you for the recipe.  My pizza was delicious.

I added 1/2 half pint of beer to the recipe and made it almost equal parts paste and sauce to make sure it was still pretty thick.  Boiled the beer for a while first.

I made this sauce tonight along with "Quick and Easy Pizza Crust".  I always like to try to make according to the recipe the first time, so I made it just as described.  I was a little disappointed, given the all the great reviews...I found this rather bland tasting.  It wasn't bad, just needs some additional flavor.

This a very a good pizza sauce but little too thick for my liking hence four stars.  I'll definitely try it again but make it little thinner next time.

Super easy to make!  I even had some left over from my pizza and used it to make meatball subs the next day!  I also used the Pizza Dough 1 recipe from this site to make very easy, amazing tasting pizza!  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this sauce. I added 1/2 tbsp. basil, 1/2 tsp. sugar and 1/2 tsp. onion powder. They were licking their plates.

This is a five star recipe if you add a tsp of sugar to cut down on the acidity. Thank you for helping me make pizza making a breeze!

This was great!  I did add the sugar as other reviews suggested.  I made one pizza, but was able to freeze enough for one more.  This will become a standard for me.

I gave this recipe 4 stars as is, but I used some of the other suggestions and made a couple changes of my own, and it is a 5 star recipe for sure!  I used 2 pressed garlic cloves instead of the powdered garlic, added 1/2 t. onion powder and a couple teaspoons of sugar.  I made it with "Pizza Crust for the Bread Machine II" (recipe also from this site) and it rocked!

This sauce is pretty tasty! I only made half and there was still quite a bit, and I added extra spices. I'm a big believer in FLAVOR. I added garlic salt because I didn't feel like mincing anything, and basil and EXTRA oregano. I also used the easy pizza dough recipe from this site as well! Pretty good basic cheese pizza! My son ate it right up. Thanks for this recipe!

I served this with Broccoli, Pepperoni and Three Cheese calzones from this site, and it was perfect. I did add a bit of water to make it thinner since we were dipping the calzones in this. It was a very zesty sauce though, and I'll be using this as my go to pizza sauce from now on.

I'd rate this a 3.5 as written but it easily turns into a 5 with the addition of brown sugar, about 2 tbsp., maybe a tad more.  Of course, this is a matter of personal taste but I love a sweeter sauce.

This was so quick and easy to make! 

Here's an easy pizza recipe: Use pre-made pizza dough in a can (find them next to the biscuit dough), unroll onto a cookie sheet and press to desired thickness, top with Easy Pizza Sauce, place fresh basil leaves and slices of tomato on top of the pizza sauce, drop spoonfuls of ricotta (low-fat works, too) onto the sauce & basil leaves, then top liberally with part-skim mozzarella cheese.  Bake according to pizza dough instructions.  SO GOOD and dinner is done in 20 minutes!

I liked this sauce a lot.  I added half a teaspoon each of basil and sugar.  Used it as a sauce for pizza casserole.  I'm definitely going to try it for actual pizza soon.  Thanks!

I'm only giving this four out of five stars because I've made so many changes.  I add some basil, oregano and 1 or 2 cloves of garlic (crushed) and 1 tsp. sugar.  With these additions, it is excellent!

Quick and easy! A little too tomato paste-y for my taste.  I followed another's suggestion to add 1/2 tsp of sugar, onion powder and basil and thought the flavor was great.  Makes enough for at least 2 12" pizzas - maybe 3 if you don't like a lot of sauce.  Great to use and freeze the remainder for another time.

This is so easy, fast and delicious. My pizzas always win rave reviews with this sauce. I've even pureed cooked lentils and ground flax in it for the picky toddler, and he's none the wiser.

I added powdered onion and powdered garlic to this recipe. I also substituted Italian Seasoning for the Oregano. It's the best sauce I have found yet.

Sauce was good, definately needed to add 1/2 tsp sugar, and was better after I let it set awhile.  Cut back on the spices and added a bit of garlic powder.  Made enough for two homemade pizza crusts.

Okay this is going to sound confusing but I'm going to try and explain anyways. I only had two cans of tomato paste (6 oz) each and 1 can of tomato sauce (8 oz) so to get the sauce mixture where it needed to be I dumped in the one can of tomato sauce, plus one of the cans of paste. Then I used the empty paste can, filled it with water, and mixed it into the sauce/paste I already had in the bowl. I hoped this would create more tomato SAUCE. It did, so I added my second can of paste as the one can called for in the recipe. Whew! I hope that made sense and can possibly help someone short on igredients. So because of all that it had a very tomato-y taste so I had to add extra seasonings, which are listed below.
Instead of just oregano and paprika I also added two heaping tablespoons of Italian seasoning, a tablespoon of sugar, onion powder, two heaping tablespoons of dried minced garlic, red pepper flakes, just a sprinkle of sea salt, and some olive oil (to make it more spread friendly).I was worried that the olive oil and water I used with the paste to make sauce would seperate but it never did, even after I let the stuff sit in the fridge all day! Man was that was some good sauce!

So easy!  Never made pizza sauce before but sure will again!  The only change to this I added 1/2 tsp sugar as others had recommended. I used this to make Pizza Casserole from this site. Delicious!

I gave it 4 stars only because I had to tweak it a bit.  I added 2 T brown sugar, the sugar cuts down on the acidity of the tomatoes.  I also added some garlic powder, onion powder and basil.  This made more than enough sauce for Jay's Signature Pizza Crust.  I'm saving the leftovers to use as a dipping sauce for some garlic cheese bread.

VERY surprised. This was great for our homemade pizza. SUPER quick... very easy... and tasted really great! I will use this for every homemade pizza in the future. It made a TON. I froze the rest for later! Thanks!

Great. Not too fancy but super easy and tastes fine. Seems a good basic sauce to tweak to your own liking. Or use as written for a sauce that is not bland, but has a laid back enough flavor to take a back seat to your topping flavor. I used it on the whole wheat crust recipe from allrecipes and some fresh moz slices and fresh tomatoe slices and it was delightful.

This is super easy and my favorite pizza sauce based on taste.  Sometimes I get frisky and add more spices, but it's great as written too.  This recipe sauces two pizzas for me. (I like them extra saucy.)

Wow do I love this sauce!!! I did juice it a up a tad, with a bit more spice, some sugar, salt and red pepper flakes, which added to the already wonderful flavor and perfect texture of this sauce! Thanks for sharing this recipe- I am forever grateful!

Um, kinda bland.  Worked ok, but I will probably find a way to zest it up or find a new recipe.  Good consistency, but so-so on flavor.

Loved it!  I too made some adjustments based on other reviews.  I added basil and sugar and left out the paprika.  I was using all the sauce that night so I added fresh garlic as well.  Will most definitely make again!

This sauce was AMAZING..the best I have ever had. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I followed the advise of other reviewers and added a little bit of white sugar and some basil.

Tasty, although the biggest critic is my husband. He thought there was too much garlic - 

Instead of tomato sauce I used a can of diced tomatoes - to make the sauce super chunky. The kids really enjoyed it, as did I.

Can't get any easier than this! I substituted Italian seasoning for the oregano - turned out perfect.  I also froze the extra in ice cube trays as another reviewer suggested.

This sauce was very bland if prepared exactly as written.  I see it more as a base recipe to add your own spices to taste.  The spices we added were: 1/2 TBSP oregano, 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 TBSP basil, 1/2 tsp white sugar, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and 1 1/2 TBSP Frank's Red Hot Sauce to give it a bit of a kick.  After the modifications, it was delicious.

This was pretty good for being so easy :)
I made a few changes....added 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 2 tablespoons of pizza seasoning instead of the oregano and added about 1 tsp of minced garlic. It was delicious and made enough to freeze for my next pizza night.
Thanks for sharing!

The sauce tasted good (if not a bit strong) and I used it to make homade pizza. My roomate and his gf liked it. However, after a couple hours I got really bad heart burn from all the acidity. Does anyone have any ideas to cut back the acidity of this sauce (ex. add water, wine, etc)?

I decided to make this for some cheese sticks I made but it didn't taste good.  I made a pizza yesterday and put this on there---OMG--was so good!  I had frozen it from before and thawed it out in the microwave and was still good.

YUMMY!!  I didn't think it was going to all that great because of the simplicity of the recipe, but I was WRONG!  This sauce is very good, it makes the pizza!  I made the sauce the day before so that the flavors had time to set in.  I also used garlic powder instead of minced and added a bit of onion poweder, as well.  VERY GOOD!

Fantastic sauce!  I have had trouble in the past with "cooked" sauces because I always cook them too long and they end up too concentrated and strong.  This is a great alternative and comes together really quickly.  I added a 1/2 tsp sugar and added a little basil without reducing the oregano.  Thanks for the recipe!

loved it! I also added just a bit of sugar and added a bit more garlic but that's just my taste. I will be using this one from now on.

I really loved this sauce.  I did add some extra seasoning to it and some sugar like some of you had said to try but other then that i followed the recipe and loved it.  My hubby cooks for a living and still was talking about how good it turned out.. Thanks.. I will be using this recipe from now on.

Very good and easy! I had enough sauce from this recipe to use on two pizzas! I would recommend doubling, however, if you like lots of sauce. Yum!

This sauce is GREAT. I wasn't expecting much, but wow--this will be my standard pizza sauce now. Just add a touch of salt to it, it's perfect.

This is good.  I did add a little salt and pepper and some dried onions.  I won't buy jarred pizza sauce again, this turned out great.  Thank you!

This was good once it was in something.  But just plain, it wasn't that good.  Kind of salty.

This is an wonderful pizza sauce for children, like mine, who do not like sauce with tomato chunks in it.  I added one teaspoon sugar to it and used 3/4 of the can of the tomato sauce.  When I used the whole can, it turned out a bit runny for my taste (but still good:)

When I use this recipe pizza sauce on my mini pepperoni pizza, my kids don't believe that the sauce is not a store bought bottled pizza sauce. My eldest son can't get enough of it. I'll say goodbye to the store bought bottled sauce. Thanks for sharing.

really easy and very good. I dont know if I'll bother with cooked method again.  If your a pizza connessieur you probably wont be happy but if you're looking for a quick fixin recipe this does the job.  I added a few more spices for my tastes (garlic etc)

I love pizza sauce, and this is a great, easy sauce! It makes more than I usually can use at once, but that's okay.
