Great recipe! Cheat, quick and delicious! I only had ground beef on hand and it was still amazing.

Easy and Delicious. I added sliced turkey pepperoni (half a bag) to the mix and it added a nice texture as well as flavor to it. Loved this!

Made this last night, just as written - no changes.  Used roasted garlic alfredo and a veggie-based spaghetti sauce.  I found it very tasty, the boyfriend also enjoyed it, and co-workers rated it as "awesome".  This was easy, quick and cost-effective!!  Thanks!!

For someone who works all the time- I really love easy dishes that are also good on a budget- this ziti was perfect, and it made so much! Before I baked it I devided the ziti mixture to 2 smaller casserole dishes so I could freeze one for later. Also, because I had precooked veggies from another dinner, I threw those into the dish- didn't change the flavor and my picky family ate everything!! Great recepi!

My family enjoyed this recipe. The addition of the Alfredo sauce really gave it a different creamier taste and texture than my usual Baked Ziti. I will make it again.

This is so easy!  I cheated even more and used homemade sauce that already had lots of mild italian sausage in it.  I cooked the pasta and than stirred in the jarred Alfredo sauce to coat the noodles - put half of the noodles in a greased baking dish, did a layer of sauce and then some cheese - the rest of the noodles, more sauce and cover the top with cheese.  Baked covered with foil so it wouldn't dry out - remove the foil and baked for another 10 - 15 minutes.  The kids loved it.

Easy weekday dinner.  My family loves pasta so when I found this recipe, I knew we needed to try it.  Can't praise this recipe enough for ease - few ingredients, quick prep, and great flavor.  The only change made was using the mild italian sausage just to cut back on it being too spicy.  I loved being able to make this and have dinner ready in under 40 minutes tops.  Bonus - the leftovers are even better b/c the flavors really meld together.

This did not taste good. I think it was the combination of the alfredo and the spaghetti sauce. I used ground beef instead of sausage, but other reviews said they also made this switch. We did eat it and I saved the left overs to eat today for lunch, but we will definitely not make this again. My husband said..."I've never had anything like it..." and he didn't mean it in a good way.

This was so easy! My Daughter is a picky eater and she had 2nd servings. My whole family loved it.  I did not have Ziti, so I used Penne. The spicy sausage gives it just enough kick!  Def a keeper in my recipe file.  Thanks for sharing, Chevyjax.

Oh.  My.  Gosh.  This is too good to be this easy.  I first tried it about a month ago, and I've made it 3 times.  The best and easiest meal to make in a hurry.  And it makes enough for plenty of leftovers!  THANK YOU!!!

So good.  I make it even easier by not boiling the ziti.  I just stir in the dry noodles and 1 cup of water.

This recipe was easy - and a huge hit with my family.  I seasoned up a pound of ground beef to be like sausage added spaghetti sauce and alfredo.  I put about half mixture in 9x12 pan then covered with provolone cheese(2 circles in strips) then put the rest of the mixture over the top and added mozzarella cheese to cover the top (because that is what I had on hand).  The alfredo works as it gives the creamy flavor and keeps it all moist.  Great shortcut!

It is baked ziti, though I wouldn't call it Baked Ziti. It was surprisingly tasty for something so simple and quick. I have to give it 5 stars for ease of preparation and economics as well. Clean up? Minimal. I boiled the sausage before slicing and adding to the pasta because it was frozen. The casserole dish I lined with foil and sprayed with cooking spray.

This is really easy and the flavor is good. I gave it 4 stars only cause it needs more meat to my family. They all liked it but they all wanted more meat. So next time I think I will use 1.5 pounds. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

Made exactly as written. So good! From kitchen to table in 30 minutes. I boiled noodles and cooked sausage at the same time. Even threw in a few garlic toasts in the oven at the same time.

Big hit with both adults and kids served with garlic bread sticks and salad. We added some leftover meatballs to make it even better.

I added breakfast sausage and layered the dish as I would lasagna.  It was great!

I made this with 96% ground beef and added a green pepper for some veggies. We loved it and saved on lots of those calories with the ground beef. Thanks for the great recipe!

So good, SO easy! It kind of made me mad at how long water takes to boil though, since that's like half of the prep time!

Used ground venison instead of sausage and still great. I've made this a couple times using ragu alfredo and pasta sauce and it's turned out well each time, also super easy to make. I'll definitely make it again
