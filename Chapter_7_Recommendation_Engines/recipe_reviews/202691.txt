I like this recipe!  It's simple, uses two sweeteners that are more healthful than white sugar, and tastes good.

Used raw sugar instead of brown sugar and it tasted great.

This was tasty. The taste is pretty good, but the effort and cost for limeade will probably prevent me from making this again.

Definitely more of a syrup-y more caramel flavor than as made with white sugar.  Good, but not as 'crisp' a taste.
