My family has been making this salad for years and we've learned a few tricks I thought I would pass on. 
1) Freeze the pretzel layer until completely cooled and hardened.
2) Add 1/3 of a packet of gelatin to the jello mixture.
3) Allow the jello mixture to chill before pouring on top of the cream cheese layer.

Hope these hints help!

Great recipe!!!  Whenever I make it I bring several copies of the recipe because people ALWAYS ask for me for it! ***Hint*** I made the mistake of crushing the pretzels in their original store bought bag and ended up with all of the extra salt from the bottom of the bag in my recipe...Too Salty!  I recommend putting the pretzels in a Ziploc bag and crushing with a rolling pin.

My cousin-in-law made this for Christmas two years ago. I couldn't get enough of it, and she forgot to send me the recipe. Needless to say, I was very glad to find it here! It's delicious. One suggestion for cooks using electric ovens and Pyrex-type bakeware, lightly cover the pan with cooking spray before baking the pretzel crust.

Good recipe - it tasted similar to a "Banana Split Cake."  ***Tip: crush pretzels in a deep bowl, with the bottom of a heavy glass.  I tried using a ziplock bag but the sharp edges of the pretzels put holes in the bag. I also followed the suggestion of melting butter and mixing in the brown sugar before adding the crushed pretzels.  Lastly, I used frozen whole strawberries which helped the jello set faster.

Very good, however, really ensure you do have your cream cheese/whipped topping layer sealed well before you add the jello layer.  I obviously did not, and some of my jello went to the bottom!  It would also help to not add the jello layer until it has some thickness to it.

The margarine & brown sugar should be melted before adding to the crushed pretzels, otherwise the crust doesn't hold.  Also, try reducing the crushed pretzels to 2 cups instead of 2 1/2.  Also, the cream cheese layer is disproportionately small, especially compared to the gelatin layer on top.

This recipe was excellent!   I made it for our daugther's first birthday as part of the menu, and everyone absolutely loved it.  The only change I made was that I pureed the strawberries in a food processor and then added it to the gelatin.  I think next time I make it, I'll make the gelatin layer first since it took quite some time to cool off.   The pretzel crust didn't get soggy, even after 3 days and we've enjoyed the leftovers.   This is definitely a recipe I'll make again and again.

Turned out great! Didn't overcook crust, didn't use light cool whip, and made sure edges were sealed so jello didn't seep to bottom. Thank you for posting the recipe and thanks to everyone else who wrote in their tips! You all helped make this perfect! Fantastic!

I had this at a party several times and now I have the receipe.  This is a dessert and the saltiness of the pretzel bottom gives it an unique flavor.  I tried raspberries and raspberry gelatin in instead of strawberry and it was superb!!! thanks.

I have made this over and over.  People always ask for the recipe.  I follow the ingredients exactly.  I have found if you make it exactly according to instructions though, the jello layer will seep into the bottom layers and the crust crumbles when cutting.  To prevent these issues freeze the curst layer before adding cream cheese layer.  Then freeze again with cream cheese layer on.  I also allow the jello/strawberry mix to set up nearly all the way before adding to the layers.  You will get a perfect, easy to serve layered dessert everytime this way.

Pretzels..who would of thought.  This is just plain yummy!  Being a gal from the South, I like my food rich and fattening...no fat free and sugar free for me.  I might get hit by a car tomorrow, so I'm  enjoying good stuff like this today!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This salad was good and passed the Sunday family dinner test...all that said I did just a few things different, I sliced the strawberries it doesn't really say what to do with them and I put the strawberry/jello mix in the freezer until the jello was almost set...hope this helps.

I don't give out 5 stars easily, but this one really deserves it!  What a perfect balance between the sweet and the salty.  I was concerned that the strawberry flavor would be left behind after the pretzels and the creamy filling, but I was wrong.  For those of you concerned about the amount of sugar in this recipe, (I will sometimes cut back), the flavors are balanced perfectly.   Despite having some rich ingredients, this salad still tastes light, barely sweet, with just a wonderful combination of flavors.  This is a terrific "multi-generational" side dish because the kids and the grandparents seem to love the jello aspect of it and I think those in between appreciate it for its delightful and surprisingly sophisticated flavor.  Try this one AS IS.... it's perfect.

A family favorite.  I double the cream cheese, whipped topping mix.  It not only adds extra zip, but stretches the servings as well.

This was indeed quite good. I made it precisely as the directions say, including all frozen strawberries, juice and a full 2 cups of water, and the jello was perfect. I ONLY baked for 10 minutes as everyone suggested and I did let the jello/strawberries sit for an hour in the frig first. Even then they still seemed to pour onto the cream cheese layer fairly liquidy so I worried that it wouldn't gel but it did set up perfectly. The jello did not seep into the cream cheese. The pretzel crust certainly does get more mushy the longer it's in your frig after making so if you can eat all of this in 1-3 days, that's preferable.

Pretty excellent. Instead of whipped topping, I whipped 1 cup of heavy cream with a tiny bit of sugar and vanilla. I also used fresh strawberries. This was wonderful. I loved the pretzel crust!

This was very good!!!  I made it for memorial day and used cran/raspberry jello and pureed 16 oz of thawed frozen strawberries instead (I don't like the texture of whole thawed ones).  To make it festive I put fresh blueberries on top of the jello before it set completely.  The tartness of the mixture worked well with the first two layers.  Perhaps 1/2 of the pretzels should be unsalted.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this!!!  My aunt always made this at the holidays with raspberries instead of strawberries and when I was a teen I would beg her for the recipe and she would always be mysteriously vague about it.  Having the recipe now to make for my own family brings me great joy and I can't wait to tell my aunt that I finally found out her secret!  :-)

I took this recipe to a 4th of July Party and it was a winner.  There were NO 
leftovers, they ate every bite.  It was also very easy to make... I was a little 
worried about the jello liquid seeping below into the pretzles, but everything 
turned out great.  I will surely be making this for every occasion in the future.  
Thanks Susan!!!

I followed the suggestions:
- spray non-stick cooking spray in pan
-completely cool crust (I made crust the night before...easy!)!
-1 1/2 times the creme cheese filling
-make sure cr. cheese filling touches all edges of pan
-added 1/3 pkg. gelatin to the jello and let it thicken some before putting it on top.

Then all you have to do is have extra copies of the recipe with you...to hand out!  Everyone wants it

Well, there were leftovers of all of the fancy, schmancy desserts but this was polished off in NO TIME!  Just a perfect recipe.  I added a little square of blueberries in the corner to make it look like a flag.  Yummy.  Perfect blend of sweet and salty flavors.

Love This! Have made this for a long time, and usually in the summer. For some reason my grocery store just ran a special on strawberries so it was a special treat! This is always great for carry-in's and get togethers especially.

LOVE IT!!  I use raspberries instead of strawberries and top with extra cool whip.  Everyone always ask for the recipe.  BEWARE this dessert melts fast and is hard to serve when it becomes too soft.

I thought there was way too much of the pretzel crust.  I thought it distracted from the rest of the salad.  I would either cut it in half, use a graham cracker crust or just use another layer of the jello on the bottom.  Other than the crust, it was great.

Not quite sure why it's called salad, but it was really good! I love the pretzel crust and will try using it for other recipes as well. I didn't really care for the strawberry Jello topping, just a personal preference because I don't much care for Jello anyway. The second time I made it, I made a strawberry topping that is more like a pie filling and I liked it a lot better! Either which way, everyone always comments how good it is when I make it.

I have had this before, but never made it until last night.  It was more work than I expected, but worth it in the end.  I followed the chilling and sealing steps carefully, as other reviewers mentioned that being important.  It turned out great.  The only thing I did differently as all, was I melted the butter.  I will try this again. Thanks for the recipe!

A little bit too sweet, I'd cut back on the sugar next time. Mine stuck to the pan big time, so theres some tweaking needed too. Mine got all runny so I think I needed to let the jello set more before pouring it over the cream cheese mixture. All in all, it was still delish!

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this.  And I wish I'd made a practice salad before making this for Easter Potluck Dinner.  I followed the directions and also doubled the recipe.  Two problems occurred:  one is that the salad sat out for over an hour before everyone ate so the topping started to melt, and two is the hostess provided a spoon to scoop up the salad and it really needed a metal spatula to pry the crust from the pan.  After reading all the reviews, I can see that freezing the crust first and also spraying the Pyrex baking dish would have been a big help.  This is has to be one of the best Jello salad recipes I've ever tasted and easy to make.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Used a little less sugar than it called for and substituted Sugar-Free Jello and it turned out great.  My family absolutely loved it.  Something a little different than the usual.

Excellent dish. I loved that it used fresh strawberries. I didn't think was too sweet at all. I may make 1 1/2 of the amount of cream cheese/whipped topping next time. I also cooled the crust completely, put the jello mixture in the freezer for a bit, and absolutely made sure my topping was sealed.  I will be making this next week.

Well, I got anxious.. I added the cream before the pretzels were cooled and then added the jello before it was set enough... the cream came up and the jello went down... soooo i have an opposite cake with probably soggy pretzels. Better luck next time, I guess.

I've prepared Pretzel Salad for years and my family and friends love it.  I switch it up using sugar free jello which saves on the calories.  Also, I use Orange gelatin and add pineapple tidbits in place of Strawberry.  This is nice for the fall and Thanksgiving holiday.  It's also great served with chicken salad and croissants. Enjoy!

I made this for a family get together this weekend.  Everyone loved it.  Instead of strawberry, I used raspberry.  One note I wanted to make that when you mix the jello, boiling water and fruit, the recipe states to let it chill until partially thickened.   I chilled it in the fridge for about an hour and it never thickened up.  I was worried that it would not thicken after I added it to the cream cheese layer, but it did.  So don't panic if the jello mixture doesn't thicken, it should turn out just fine.

Very good- made a day in advance.  Don't make the same mistake I did, however, and let the gelatin sit too long- make sure to spread it before it is too firm.

I tasted this at my monthly card club, and asked the lady who brought it for the recipe.  She told me it was on this site and I found it right away.  I went out the next morning and bought the ingredients.  I crushed the pretzels (the mini ones) between two sheets of waxed paper and bashed them with a rubber mallet (a standard cooking tool in my kitchen).  They crushed just fine that way. I know the recipe says to cream the butter and sugar together, but I figured I wasn't making a wedding cake, so I just dumped the butter and brown sugar in the bowl with the crushed pretzels and mashed them around with a spatula until they were blended. I love this dish!  It really is the perfect combination of sweet and salty.

This salad was so good that my husband just wanted to eat the whole thing. I cut the recipe in half to try for the first time.  Next time I will make a full recipe. I substituted cherry jello for the strawberry jello and it was delicious.

I made this for company and it was a hit.  I think I overbaked the pretzel crust because it was very hard but it kept well it the fridge for several days without getting soggy.  I want to experiment with the whipped cream/cream cheese filling to make it less like whipped topping and more like a cheesecake consistency.  Very yummy!

I'm not a big fan of jello, but this was a very good (and different!) dessert.  Everyone complimented me on it.  I'd make it for summer picnics.

Thanks for this delicious recipe!  I took it to a large family gathering and everyone -- young and old -- loved it.  Even my picky aunt (herself an excellent baker), asked for the recipe!  I knew I had a hit!

I don't write a lot of reviews but I have been making this treat for a couple years now and it gets rave reviews every time.  To make it a little fancier, I whipped together heavy cream and marscapone instead of cool whip and cream cheese.  It was devine!  Five people ate over half the pan last night!

I see that some of you were having trouble with the Jell-O setting. My Grandma told me to add a few ice cubes in the Jell-O after it's all dissolved. Then put it in the fridge. I was having trouble getting mine to set as well and apparently Grandma's have the magic touch because this worked like a charm!

I was not real pleased with this one.  I followed the recipe as stated and the pretzel bottom stuck to the bottom of the pan.  The middle tasted good, but the top was too much like jello and I thought it should have had a softer texture.  I will not be making this again.  What a waste of ingredients!

This was very good, the whole family liked it.  Normally when I make dessert, I take the leftovers to work with me, but this time my husband wouldn't let me.  Next time I'll add more butter to the pretzel crust, it needs more to hold together well.  I used my food processor to crush the pretzels, and that worked great.  Definitely will make again and again!

This was lots of work and in the end, I don't think it is worth it. My pretzels couldn't get fine enough, so the butter never really got through and the crust stayed a crumbly mess. As for taste it was good but not worth the hassle.

Awesome!  I added a cup of crushed, drained pineapple to the jello along with the strawberries since my husband said that is how his grandmother made it.  It was a nice addition.

This was just O.K.  I have been served this dessert before and I really enjoyed it.  However, I thought this recipe had too much of a "cool whip" taste and not enough cream cheese.  I will make this again but with a different recipe. Sorry!

Excellent! The idea kind of worried me, but I decided to give it a try due to all the great reviews, and we are all glad I did! I made this with light Jell-o, and took the advice of another to put the pretzel crust into the freezer, as well as melting the butter a bit to form the crust better. 

DH asked me to make this for his Easter pot luck at work...

I love this recipe, however is is MUCH better if you use raspberries instead of strawberries. Less acidic. You can still use strawberry Jell-O if you like. Delicious! Whenever I take this to a party, it is gone in no time and everyone asks for the recipe.

I think this is one of those recipes most people either love or hate.  Hubs loved this and ate it within 48 hours.  I thought it was just okay; however, my apathy could be because I used Splenda instead of normal sugar in the middle layer.  I thought I'd humor hubs for once, and I didn't like the aftertaste.  However, since he loved it so much I'm going to make it for him again; we have more Cool Whip and more pretzels.  We do not  have more strawberries, frozen or otherwise, so I'll try with the fruit we have (raspberries I think), and I'll just leave out the cream cheese since we don't have anymore.  I didn't use the amount of cream cheese called for since 1.  I didn't have it and 2.  we've tried similar layers with cream cheese in jello salads and have not liked it at all.  So, this is a variation for our house.  I thought the instructions were easy, I froze each layer in between, started the jello first so it had time to cool, and did not have any seepage even though the strawberries created lumps (note:  spoon in the jello layer, don't dump like I did!).  Thanks for the recipe!

This really sounds great but when I got this recipe I simply used about 1 cup pecans and 
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar and a little (1 teaspoon)
butter mixed together as the bottom layer.  Cooked it for 15 minutes at 350 degrees, let cool then added the other layers.  Wow!

I have made this before, but it's been awhile. It's chilling in my freezer but I can tell you the problems I had in preparing this. First, I tried to halve the recipe. Second, the cream cheese mixture was not adequate enough to cover the pretzel layer and the pretzel layer began to pull up and away. Third, I used fresh strawberries I had picked which were fine, but the gelatin layer did not seem to set. Furthermore, because my cream cheese mixture was too sparse, it did not seal the edges and the gelatin layer seeped to the bottom. Since I had to be at a 4th of July party 1/2 hour ago and it's still not set, we may be serving gooey, watery pretzel salad!

First of all, I made a mistake.  I didn't realize you were not supposed to put in the 2 cups of cold water that you put in when making Jello until I read someone say maybe you were supposed to do that.  I don't know that would have made any difference to my rating.  It was way too salty for me, and I didn't care for that.  I won't make this again.

Oh thank you for this recipe! Growing up, my friend's mom made this for dessert. She always served dessert after every dinner! My friend and her little sister hated it, but I loved it sooo much! I would get my friend's helping.

It came out good but for some reason this was just not a big hit with my (very large, extended) family

Yummy!  I didn't make this but it was brought by someone I didn't know.  The texture seemed a bit weird but I couldn't get over the sweet and the salty.  My daughter and I kept trying to figure out what it was when someone walked by and said they just got the recipe.  I had to go online, find the exact recipe and review it.  It is soo good.  I had seconds and shared my husband's.  I didn't want to take more than my share.  :)  Wish I could have though.

I did not like the crust on this at all.  The pretzels just tasted stale after mixing with the butter and cooking.  Next time I will do a graham cracker or shortbread crust.

I cannot believe everyone rates this 5-star!! I think they made a typo in the ingredients!  The box of jello should have been a 3 oz., not a 6 oz.   It would have been much better if the top layer was more jam-like.  I'll make it again but I'll spread a nice strawberry jam on top, then it will rate a 5-star with me!

This was really good, I just thought that there was too much crust and cream cheese mix, but not enough strawberry top. Next time I will double the strawberry topping.

I made this for a family gathering over the holidays.  Everyone loved it from grampa on down!  I usually don't make jello desserts, but this one is a keeper. Thanks!

I have always loved this dessert... but this time I used a graham cracker crust and instead of jello, I used two cans of cherry pie filling on top of the cream cheese/whipped topping mixture.  Tasted more like a cheesecake... YUMMY:P

I liked the flavors but will try to change the recipe if I make this again. The crust was delicous but very difficult to dig into with your fork. Too hard. Maybe I measured something wrong? I loved the salty contrast with the sweetness. I also thought the cream cheese and cool whip was too sweet. I would like to half the amount of cool whip and make it creamier. Lastly, I only had frozen strawberries and yuck they were too sweet. Next time I will omit them or use half the amount if I can't get fresh. I will also doubble the amount of jello. I like jello and this just was not enough for me. Maybe even the sugar free kind. Can you tell this was just to sweet for me. My son loved it. I will change things up if this recipe has another shot.

I was a little disappointed with how my strawberry pretzel salad turned out but it could be my fault.  I didn't get my pretzels crushed too fine and that might have been the problem.  Second, I used, frozen strawberries and will try fresh next time.  The frozen strawberries probably held too much water and that's why the gelatin part of the salad, was not too firm.  Otherwise, the cream cheese layer was delish.  Will try again next time and hope for better results

Yummy! Time consuming and gets a little soggy after two days but this was I nice change for dessert.  I pureed the strawberries as we don't like mushy fruit chunks in our desserts.

Everyone was raving out this in one of my MSN groups and I didn't think it had the wow factor.  My father loves strawberries and as he ate this he made a face of dissatifaction.  Being the man of few words...I knew what it meant.

This is probably my favorite strawberry dessert.  Made if for Mother's Day and everyone loved it.  Made as written and I can't imagine changing a single thing.  I made it the day before and it was perfect for serving the day of.  The flavors and textures are fun & yummy!

This is an OUTSTANDING fool-proof recipe.  I did tweak a little.  Not a huge fan of strawberries, I used frozen dark cherries and black cherry jello.  Okay, I admit I guilded the lily a little by whipping my own cream, slightly sweetening it and adding a dash of vanilla. Holy Cherries, but it was GOOD!!!

I LOVE this recipe.  The only problem is that I can only make it for events like partys and picnics becuase it has to be eaten quickly.  even 3 days later, I can still eat it because the flavor is good but soggy pretzels don't taste well.  I have made this 2 times now and took the advise to double check for holes in the cream cheese layer.  It definately helped prevent leaking.  I think next time I'll make the jello first because it didn't allow enough time to set and I used fresh strawberries.  maybe frozen would help set faster.  I even added jsut a little bit of non flavored gelatin to it hoping that would help.  I guess if i didn't make it at 1130 at night, I would have been able to allow more time for the jello to set.  also let the pan from the pretzels cool completely because the 1st time I thought it was cool enough it started melting my cream cheese layer!  didn't affect taste much but I think that caused the leaking!  yum, yum, yum.  This is a favorite in our household and at our parties!

Here's a way to get some attention with this recipe:  during the last minute of baking for the pretzel crust, sprinkle a 12 oz. bag of DARK chocolate chips on top of pretzel mixture.  When you pull it out, spread the chocolate over the pretzels and make as directed.  Your guests will be surprised at how the addition of chocolate makes this like a chocolate covered strawberry!

The proportions seemed off in this recipe, even after I added extra whip cream and strawberries on top of the gelatin layer the pretzels still seemed overpowering. Next time I intend to try it with graham crackers instead to see if the tastes go together better.

Yummy! Crushing the pretzels in the blender would be better than just crushing them with a rolling pin, as the pieces are a bit big otherwise.

Delicious! Used the suggestion of crushing the pretzels in the ziploc bag and pouring out the salt that collects. I used white sugar in the crust instead of brown. My husband LOVES this 'salad'.

This is a great "salad" to bring to potlucks or showers. I've used frozen (thawed) berries and they work just as well.

Had some friends over today and made this dish.  I used two packages of frozen strawberries (about 4 cups worth) and it came out wonderful.  Everyone thought it was de-lish.

Excellent desert, seemed like the pretzel layer wasn't enough to spread across that big of a pan. Used a 8x8 pan instead.

I have been making this for years and it always is a big hit!  What I do with the pretzels is I put them in a 4 cup measuring cup and then use a banana/potato masher thingy.  I just keep pressing them until they break into nice size pieces.  You can also easily measure how much you have that way.

Very fun and interesting salad.  Takes a bit of time, so be prepared for that.  Also, crushing pretzels... not so easy.  Even the food processor didn't want to crush them.  Mine never did get that small, but I used the skinny matchstick kind, maybe the round ones are easier?  Anyway, I still had many peices 1/3 to 1/2 inch long when I finally gave up on the crushing thing.  There were some fine crumbs... anyway, it worked so don't be discouraged if you can't get them to completely crush down.  I also added about an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the pretzel mixture.  I just felt like it needed it, and it turned out well.  But the kids loved it.  One more hint, the strawberries and bananas start getting "icky" within about 24 hours, so don't fix this thinking you'll have salad for several days.  It is best for a crowd who are going to eat it up right away.  Because of this I may experiment with other fruits that last longer rather than using fresh strawberries and bananas; my kids were really sad 2 days later when I had to throw the rest away.

Though I haven't made this exact recipe, the Strawberry Pretzel Salad that my family makes (which I am pretty sure is the exact same) is AMAZING. Very addicting, and it always gets rave reviews. Guaranteed.

I'm all for fat and sugar when they're needed, but this light summer dessert (it's funny that it's called a salad) can be much less caloric with a few modifications that don't diminish the taste at all.  First, one stick of butter (1/2 cup) is plenty, and you might not even need that much.  You can use neufchatel in place of regular cream cheese, and you can cut the sugar in that neufchatel/cool whip layer to 1/2 cup or less.  I also used sugar free jello.  I followed everyone's tips about thoroughly cooling the crust, sealing the neufchatel layer to the edge of the dish, and not adding the jello/strawberry layer until almost set.  It all worked wonderfully!

Amazing flavor!! The sweet strawberries with luscious cream cheese filling, combined with the saltiness and crunchiness of the pretzel crust, is an explosion of different tastes that is utterly sublime.  YUM!  It sounded strange when I first heard of this dessert, and it is extremely different than anything else I have tasted.  Which is why I crave this dessert SO much!  IT is definitely a crowd-pleaser EVERY TIME!!

This was deliciously amazing! I made it for 15 people, and we licked the bowl clean in no time! Whipped cream makes a great decoration for the top, and/or an addition to the cream cheese. I really like slicing up extra strawberries to put in the Jello.

excellent. I didn't change any ingredients but I did use someone's suggestion.... I placed the dish in the freezer to set the pretzels and then again to set the cream cheese layer. 
Everyone loved this dish.

All 7 of us  (age 4 to 74) enjoyed the strawberry salad.  The bottom pretzel crust balanced the normal sweetness of strawberry desserts,

I made this recipe following all steps & I really liked  the sweet & salty strawberry fresh flavor.  But, if & when I make it again,  I will be sure to make these 2 chages:  first, I plan on crushing the pretzels more finely  (the crust was too hard & crunchy), & second:  I plan on slicing the strawberries.  They're  too big & lumpy when left whole or even when cut in half.

This is our favorite summer dessert! One good tip for timing: Make the crust ahead of time to give it plenty of time to cool completely, which is a must. Don't make the mistake I did the first time, making the jello mixture while the crust is in the oven, because the crust will still be too warm by the time the jello mixture is already starting to get firm. Allow time, too, for the cream cheese mixture to chill on top of the cooled crust before then putting the jello layer on.  Unlike another reviewer, I do not like to put the pretzel crust in the freezer to firm up because I feel that this makes it soggy when it then thaws out sitting in the fridge. I also like to use a little closer to 3 cups of crushed pretzels to ensure a nice crunchy crust. I use frozen sliced strawberries (another reason the jello begins to firm up fairly quickly) and I prefer to use more than the 3 cups. Absolutely delicious dessert that perfectly hits the sweet and salty spot!

First off, I used applesauce instead of butter, honey wheat pretzels (which were one bugger to break up...put them into a ziploc bag, covered with a hand towel, and got out some frustration!), used fat free cream cheese, and sugar free jello.  I also froze the crust for ~15 min to let it cool.

Secondly, I think that this recipe grossly underestimates the amount of jello that you need.  I used TWO boxes, and after combining it with the slightly thawed strawberries (cut frozen wholes into halves), the strawberries absorbed the jello.  I was left with a frozen, lumpy, jello mix.  Instead of letting it thaw, I kind of broke it up across the top; needless to say the first and second layer became friends.

If someone can please let me know what I did wrong, as I do not think it's my substitutions, I would be very appreciative.  

This dessert looks delicious, however, chilling in my fridge.

It might just be me, but there seemed to be a few mistakes in this recipe. The primary problem was in the jello layer- maybe there should have been some cold water added after the boiling? Also, I halved the amount of whipped cream, as recommended by previous reviewers. Lots of sugar, though, so it was very tasty!

This was soo good! I followed some of the suggestions and let the jello part set a little before I put it on. I also used French Vanilla Cool Whip which gave a little more flavor. Everyone loved this!

Love this recipe!  The only changes I make are using a bit less sugar in the cream cheese and sugar free jello (2 packages) on the top.  I like things a bit less sweet.
Get rave reviews anytime I make it!

I have had the strawberry pretzel salad before that was less sweet and the gelatin a little more firm but I brought this to a baby shower and everyone enjoyed it.

We had this served to us at a ladies luncheon and everyone wanted seconds. I don't remember the rest of the meal because this was so good.
