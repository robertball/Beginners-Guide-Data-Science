Quick, easy and tasty! Also works really well if you don't have fresh fruit but use a can of fruit nectar instead. One 12 oz can of nectar replaces 1 cup of fruit + 1/2 cup of water. It also helps to add the last half of the ice cubes one at a time stopping as it gets to the desired consistency.

I too had to add more water (apprx 1 1/3c) and used frozen strawberries. Very sweet but very good and went great with our lunch of burgers from the grill!! Would make again more this summer!!

This was pretty good. I had used frozen blueberries. Maybe I just have a crappy blender but it seemed to need a lot of water. It calls for 1/2 cup and I had to have added at least 2 cups. I'll probably make this again in the summertime.

I made this for an event at church. It was refreshing for the hot, summer day. But I found the original recipe to be a bit too sweet. Ended up adding an extra half cup of water to make up for it.

loved this, and so did my grandchildren... I used the sugar free lemonade, and it was so good! A real keeper.

Its sunny and gorgeous here in the Pacific Northwest today (but chilly) I was working in the yard and wanted something other than coke or coffee for a little break. I remember that I had printed this off months ago, and asked my hubby if he would make us a pitcher of these. WOW! How wonderful! We love anything berry and anything lemon, so we really enjoyed these. They also revved up our motors so we could work a little longer! Thanks Kraft!

We had a few blueberries leftover from picking and my kids loved this easy to make slushy.  The lemonade added a nice tangy flavor.

I made this recipe as instructed the first time, and my family went nuts. I am on a diet though, and the Country Time/Kool-Aid has a lot of sugar in it. Diabetics, and weight watchers rejoice...You can use 1- 1&1/2 teaspoons of Crystal Light sugar free lemonade (the kind in the cylinder filled with tubs). The second time I made the recipe, we did it with exactly half a tub of Crystal Light (1 1/2 tsps.) it was a bit tangy, but just as good as the original version. Between the Crystal Lights, and the 6lb bag of Frozen Strawberries I got at Costco for a song, we are set for a cool summer. Thanks for the great recipe. Yummmm!

My best friend and I made this recipe tonight and she thought it was great.  It was a little sour for her, so we added some sugar (aprox 2 tbsp).  We also used whole frozen strawberies with 1 cup of water and it still came out well.

This was an okay slush but nothing great.  No one asked for seconds.
