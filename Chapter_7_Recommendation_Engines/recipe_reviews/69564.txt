We too made it just like a pizza - used pizza sauce instead of sliced tomatoes.  My kids LOVED it!  A great alternative for those of us on a gluten free diet!

This was a cute way for us to get a pizza fix without waiting forever for dough to rise.  My only suggestion is that you use sauce instead of tomatoes, which tend to get lost in the cheese and sausage.

I thought I would give this a try because it sounded interesting but I would not make it again.  It was pretty bland and the flavors just did not meld with the hashbrowns. Thanks anyway!

I made this just like a regular pizza, pizza sauce, cheese and pepperoni.  You definitely had to eat this one with a fork.  This took a long time to bake with no big bang here.

Okay I need to try it exactly as the recipe states.  But, I did follow the recipe and suggestions to use pizza sauce (Easy Pizza sauce on the site- 1 lg tomato sauce, 1 sm can tomato paste with seasonings). The visiting Toddlers in the house ate them like they eat pancakes with their plates in their hands reached out looking cute while they say "More":)

This was pretty good.  I shredded the potatoes and rinsed them in a colander- pressed out extra starch and liquids.  Added pizza spice to the dough.  I also used krusteaz pancake mix for a slightly thicker crust. Everyone really enjoyed this.  I would try with just flour for a thinner crust to see if it is crisper (my hubs is a thin & crispy pizza fan).  Overall a great recipe that is fairly quick and easy.  Didn't use this recipe's toppings though, did tomato sauce mozz sausage and olives.  Everyone gobbled it up!
