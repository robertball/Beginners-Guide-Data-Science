Tastes great, but I changed a few things. I couldn't find the Jif brand so I used a regular chocolate hazelnut spread and added 2.5 TBS of strong coffee to it, to get the coffee flavor. I used low fat cream cheese as well.Also for the bottom layer instead of wafers I used oreo cookie crumbs. My muffin pans would only take 1 TBS of crumb mixture and there was just enough for 12 individual cakes. Also I just used regular muffin pan liners. Definitely have to chill or the cheesecake is a little soft, but otherwise tastes great.

I absolutely loved this dessert.  I tastes so decadent and rich and they look beautiful.  Next time I'll try Oreos for the crust.  It made exactly 12.  The hubby was amazed and definitely wants this to be added to the repertoire.

Great recipe.  Definitely a keeper!  I made them in a mini muffin pan. Made 36 mini's. I replaced Jif with Nutella and roasted whole hazelnuts to top each bite size cake.  Baked for 13 mins. So good!

Wow!  These are DEEELICIOUS!!  One of my biggest hits with my family, friends and co-workers.  The ONLY thing I did differently was use regular hazelnut spread (my local grocery store doesn't have the cappuccino flavor).  I then added a package of Folgers instant mocha cappuccino powder to the mix.  For the chocolate wafer cookies, I just removed the filling from some Oreos, people really seem to like that flavor you can only get from an Oreo crust!  In the three times that I've made them, I had to bake for more like 23 minutes.  Tips for beginners:  cream cheese MUST be room temperature to blend and fluff properly.  Same for the eggs.  Extra vanilla never hurts ??. If you don't have the right kind of pan to make a water bath, just fill an oven safe dish with water and place it on the bottom rack of your oven as soon as you turn it on.  This last time that I made these, I added a sprinkle of mini chocolate chips to the top of each cake before serving, it added even more chocolate flavor as well as some texture.

I made this for father's day for my husband and he loved them. I used crushed oreos for the crust. I used the Nutella brand hazelnut spread since that is what I could find at my local store. I baked them twenty minutes and they came out very tasty! I will certainly be making these mini cheesecakes again!

This was very good. My crust came out way too hard, I think because I used the whole Oreo cookie, cream middle and all, and I think this was the problem. Whatever is in that cream does not bake well.  I will definitely make it again but using only the cookie part of an Oreo for the crust.

Made exactly as written, except I used Oreos for the crust (because I had some around) and baked in a 12 x 8 pan with a water bath for 20 minutes. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

these are great!  I also made some changes: used vanilla wafers and added about 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder with an additional tablespoon of butter to give the crust a hint of chocolate  flavor. Very yummy!  I also used regular nutella spread and added 1 tablespoon  of  espresso powder.  then I stopped them with crushed hazelnuts and a chocolate mocha bean.   Turned out so good. Thank you!

I used 1 1/2 cups Oreos without the filling and 1/2 cup butter for the crust. I can not find Jif mocha cappuccino spread so I used Nutella and Starbucks instant cappuccino latte instead. Baked it for 23 minutes and dashed it with unsweetened cocoa powder. My family loved it. This recipe truly deserves 5 stars.

I followed the recipe with one exception. I couldn't find the Jiff this called for, so I added some instant coffee granules as suggested by another reviewer to chocolate hazelnut flavor. I used Famous Chocolate Wafers, broke them up, and ground them in my mini-processor. The one problem I had was getting the piped-on chocolate to stick to the tops of the cakes. Maybe if it was thinned a bit with some milk it would have worked better. However, I got no complaints from my guests. They enjoyed them very much.

I made these for a fundraiser at work and they were a huge hit! I crushed chocolate oreos for the crust and I couldn't find Jif cappacino hazelnut spread so I just used Kroger chocolate hazelnut spread. They turned out great and were easy to make! Thanks for the recipe!

I made these in mini cheesecake pans that I found on Amazon.  It made 24, 2 inch cheesecakes and I adjusted time to around 13 minutes.  Like others, I used chocolate graham crackers and added 2 Tablespoons of cooled brewed coffee to Nutella Hazelnut spread.  They were fantastic and oh so decadent.

Mine turned out really good! I tried one before it was completely cooled so the cheesecake was a little soft, but, I'm sure by morning they'll be perfect! I added coffee extract to bring out more of the hazelnut flavor.

I made them in a mini cupcake pan and used chocolate graham crackers instead of chocolate cookies for the base. Jif  Mocha  Capuccino  flavoured hazelnut spread is not available in Canada so I added a teaspoon of instant espresso coffee granules in the Nutella spread.  They were delicious and everyone at the party raved about them.

I used normal hazelnut spread and Oreos. Everyone loved it. I ate the leftovers right out of the freezer. Love, love, love these.

I used Nutella for the hazelnut spread which made an excellent addition and used almost stale Oreos of which I scraped off all the cream filling for the chocolate wafers.  All of my coworkers raved about these and were sad that there were so few. Will definitely made this in the future. Crowd fave!

I made a change in that I used two boxes of no bake cheesecake mix instead, mixed with milk as on the package.  To one batter, I added the hazelnut spread.  The other batter I used plain. Then I followed the recipe, but no baking!  One box of chocolate wafers ground in a  electric mill made 2 cups of crumbs, and I added 5 Tb melted butter to that, mixed, pressed 1-2 TB into paper muffin cups, then added each batter as in the recipe.  Then chilled overnight.  sprinkle with cocoa and piping.  Delicious!

Turned out great.  I used Oreo wafers as others have and I used chocolate hazelnut spread.  I made 12 mini cheesecakes with enough left over to make 1 muffin size tester/taster.  These are tasty and pretty.
