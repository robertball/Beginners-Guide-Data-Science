I was looking for a buttery brittle like I had purchased at a craft fair.  This is sooooo good.  I made it exactly as written (except for using parchment paper instead of wax paper to line the cookie sheet - it works great).  I only had slivered almonds, I think it would be even better with whole almonds, and I think I will try it with cashews and macadamias too!  It is fairly greasy on your hands, but that doesn't bother me.  The directions are good (I didn't time the minutes, just stirred constantly until it was a good color.  Be prepared - once it is done you must pour it out immediately.  It cools and hardens very quickly (less than 30 minutes on a cold November afternoon in New York).  The biggest plus is not having to deal with massive amounts of corn syrup and candy thermometers!

Butter remained seperated from other ingredients the entire cooking process and when it finally all became one mixture it immediately burned.

Brilliant. I was looking for a butter brittle recipe and this hits the spot. I don't add the nuts to the pot until just before I pour. This can also be made with chocolate chips - just let the brittle set up and then scatter the chips over the top of the still hot brittle and spread them out with a spatula. 

For the people whose recipe separated - two possible causes are that the heat was too low or that there was too much butter added and it prevented the sugar from caramelizing. (I know this last one because I did it once myself - delicious crumbly results, but not brittle.)

No stars - I've been making brittle for 30+ years and this is without a doubt the worst recipe.  A waste of 1/2 c butter and almonds.  Maybe it's because I've never heard of using a frying pan and I'm sure that's what makes it separate.  I made a regular batch with old recipe and came out perfect  - no separation and my pan was plenty hot.

Worked great, first time I made brittle.  Will try it using other ingredients like Oregon roasted Hazel nuts & sea salt.

The butter seperated towards the end for me also. Maybe if I would have removed it from the heat a few minutes earlier it might have been fine but it hadn't browned. It looks like a mess but the taste is great!

I used a medium saucepan instead of a skillet.  Also used Marcona almonds from Spain (available at Costco), and did not use the corn syrup.  As others have suggested, I mixed the butter and sugar in the pan, medium-high heat, stirring constantly.  Once the mixture attained a caramel color, stirred in the almonds, and poured the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Once you add the almonds, it sets up quick.  Tastes great!

Way too much butter, it didn’t mix and ended up being very greasy but not in a good way. To make this perfect just adjust the butter down to 2-3 Tbls. I didn’t have corn syrup so I substituted maple syrup.  Added a splash of vanilla and it turned out pretty good. Very simple recipe but careful with the butter, reduce it and it will turn out great!

I am a baker and a candy maker and I found this recipe and thought I would try it, It does not make enough for a large baking sheet so make sure you use a smaller one. Also unless all you want to taste are the almonds this recipe does not make enough brittle. It does have a good flavor though.

Super easy and delicious. I had a tough time getting the butter to fully incorporate. Ended up just giving up and putting it on the wax paper (should have used parchment). Turned out fine -- the extra butter just flowed off.

I read the 1 star reviews first so I was careful to keep my heat at medium to avoid separation.  Other than that, this recipe worked out GREAT!  I was so keen to make brittle that I actually used smoked almonds, and guess what... it turned out just great.  I can't wait to try this with other nuts.  It's a perfect starting point and I think is going to lend itself to personalization.

I will definitely be making this again. It was fast (5 minutes) and easy (one pot) and called for simple ingredients. The brittle wasn't too hard. Tastes great!!! I used parchment paper as well because my daughter left some at my house but it worked beautifully!

I've made this twice already with 2kg almonds, both times were a great success. It is a bit oily, but I wiped it afterwords with a clean cloth to remove the excess oil. Mine also sticked big time to the wax paper so now I only spray a cookie sheet and it works like a charm. Everyone loves the taste, and it's perfect for a gift. Will definitely save this as a favorite.

This tastes really good!  I was a little loose with the recipe...and I used sliced almonds.  When I mixed all the ingredients, it looked a little dense so I added about an extra ounce of corn syrup...and another 1/2 cup of sugar.  I added a cup of coconut after it started changing color like mentioned by another review.  MY ONLY ISSUE:  It stuck mightily to the wax paper.  I have made other brittle using vegetable oil spray on a cookie sheet and had no issues.  Worth trying again.

great stuff. My son is allergic to peanuts so has never had the chance to enjoy peanut brittle. As soon as I saw this I had to make it. I burned it a little, but it was still a family favorite. Thanks!!

This was a bad experience.  I used medium high heat, stirring constantly.  It never came together properly though. Just a disaster.
