WHOA!!!!!!  huge typ-o!!  Thats reflected in the 3 star rating.  I have been making cream cheese cookies for years and it should be 8 OUNCES of cream cheese, not 3!!!!  I can only imagine why people thought they tasted like flour, look at the recipe's stated proportion of flour to cream cheese!  3 oz. cream cheese for 2 1/2 cups flour?  YIKES.  I made this recipe with 8 oz. cream cheese and cut back the flour to 2 cups, and still think I could cut the flour back some more. They don't taste too rich with the 8 oz,. trust me, it will taste the way its supposed to...like a CREAM CHEESE COOKIE and not a flour cookie!  For half my batch I pressed a fork into the cookies and sprinkled green sugar crystals on them, the other half I made thumbprints and filled with blackberry and apricot preserves.  Yummy.  Food coloring also works great with these cookies, especially if using a press!

Great recipe as is or with some variations.  After making it as submitted several times, today I managed to create "strawberry cheesecake" cookies by adding 2/3 of a 3 oz box of strawberry jello.  (I was too chicken to add the whole box, but I might next time).  This made the cookies a bright pink color, which was perfect for my daughter's class Valentine's party tomorrow.  I also used a full 8 oz of cream cheese this time, and was pleased with the results.  I chilled the dough and then put it into my cookie press to make a heart shape.  My husband said he loved them and wants me to do it this way again next time.  Imagine the possibilities...green jello mix with a shamrock shape for St. Pat's Day or Christmas trees, orange jello for Halloween pumpkins... This recipe works so well for press cookies.  I tried two or three other recipes with horrible results and now I always use this one.  Good luck!

I just tried these cookies for the second time. Te first time I followed the recipe exactly, except added more vanilla, and they tasted like flour. This time I added 8 oz. cream cheese and did them as a drop cookie because the dough was too sticky for a press. They are MUCH better this time. Soft cookies with a lot of cream cheese flavor!! I added chocolate chips to some and I made thumbprint cookies out of some. I put a bit of strawberry preserves in the tumbprint before baking. YUMMY! The plain ones are good as well! I will probably make these again. I gave it 4 stars because I had to alter the recipe.

I made these using the 8oz size Philly. I made them with "Splenda". I did not have time to bake them, so after I made the dough, I rolled the dough (I made three rolls) in plastic wrap and refrigerated them. I baked them as I needed them. They slice well, and keep well.I probably used them within 4 or 5 weeks.

Great recipes and pretty straightforward! I used the stand mixer and the cookie press to do most of the work. I uploaded a photo of the cookies.

Fantastic cookies from a cookie press--just be sure not to overbake them.  When they're done they still look pale and soft, and they'll harden as they cool.  Always a hit!

These are very rich and wonderful!  I used an 8 oz. cream cheese as suggested in several of the reviews.  I also filled some with strawberry jam, some with chocolate chips and even pressed a pecan half on some and sprinkled those with a little bit of sugar.  One review said it tasted like play-dough.  I have never eaten playdough but will try now if this is how it tastes!

I made these for my Christmas tray, and they were very good.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla (which I read in one of these reviews..thanks).  It gave the cookies a nice flavor.  I wanted to add that I made a mistake and used an 8 oz. package of cream cheese instead of 3 oz (haha)...but you would never know!  Everyone loved them, and it gave them a cake like texture...so keep that in mind!

I guess I should have read more of the reviews before I decided to use this recipe for my first time using a cookie press. Though I'm sure I could use practice, the dough didn't seem stiff enough. That said, I did manage to get a few sheets of very pretty cookies... I did put red raspberry preserves in the centers of about half of them. However, after all that work, I was really disappointed by the taste. I used 8 oz of cream cheese, as suggested by other users. They taste like a very mediocre shortbread... sorry.

This is a great recipe! Also, I just want to say that recipes are all different and so are tastes, so please don't assume that it's a typo or mistake just because you disagree. I just found the original Mirro cookie press cream cheese cookie recipe that my mom used EVERY YEAR FOR FIFTY YEARS, and it also calls for 2 1/2 cups of flour and 3 oz. of cream cheese. The cookies are fantastic. My mom is an exceptional baker as well. So, sure, add 8 oz. if that's what you prefer. However, please don't condescend to the person who wanted to share her recipe. It's a good one, even if it's not exactly to your liking.

My Mom has been making these cookies for Christmas since I was a little boy (48 now...). She always doubled the batch and made half green and half red (she used 8oz. cream cheese for each batch), then she Pressed them through cookie press in Tree shapes and wreath shapes. She used Chocolate, colored and many other type of sprinkles. She used Rum extract on a small handful of a batch. Every year everybody looked so forward to these cookies!!!! Now that she has passed I make them, but must have made a mistake with the flour when rewriting it.... they always tasted too flour-ey... but thanks to you great people I fixed it, made them and they are great!!!! Thanks!!!

This is the same recipe that my grandmother who was born in 1903 used.  It is correct as written.  The cookies get there sweetness from the sugar spinkle on top.  Instead of using a cookie press, I roll the cookies, dip in sprinkles and flatten with a glass bottom.  They look like bakery cookies and ALWAYS get rave reviews.

I've had this recipe for years, but there are just a few slight alterations to this one.  Reduce the flour to 2 1/4 cups, add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the flour, and use 1/2 cup softened butter & 1/2 cup margarine. ( I most always use Land O Lakes for both).  Chill the dough in fridge for about 30 minutes.  Use cookie press as directed.  This was passed down from my mom.  They make the best cookies and taste even better a few days after they are made.

I made these cookies today with just two small changes to the recipe- used one whole package of cream cheese (8 ounces) rather than the 3 ounces as written in the original recipe and I doubled the amount of vanilla to 1 teaspoon.  The cookies came out great- nice, delicate flavor and soooo easy to make.  I sprinkled red and green colored sugar on top before I put them in the oven to make them more festive looking for Christmas.  I will be adding this recipe as one of my regulars for Christmas cookie baking for sure!

These were an absolutely delicious base, but they are a touch bland without some decorating or interesting additives.  I dipped each in little red and green nonpareils and they were lovely but I couldn't help wanting to turn them into sandwich cookies with some chocolate fudge.  All in all, I loved them and I will be making them again!

Definitely use an entire 8oz block of cream cheese. Three ounces doesn't cut it. Also cut the flour back a bit. Makes all the difference.

Something must be wrong with this ingredient list, b/c 2 1/2 cups of flour was way too much... the cookies tasted very floury when they were finished. Either they would need more of everything else or less flour.

These are a delightfully light cookie. I love the cream cheese doesnt overpower the butter flavor. 
They make excellent cut out cookies if you chill the dough well and in small batches. They are done before they are brown. Bake only until lightly golden around the edges.

Not very flavorful. Kind of bland. Won't be making this again. I'm sure if I had not of put in EIGHT ounces of cream cheese instead of THREE, it would have been a lot worse....

I couldn't get these to stick from the cookie press at all. I tried chilling the dough, chilling the sheets, nothing worked. I ended up dropping them on the sheet, rounded but they didn't cook all the way through in 15 minutes. Won't make this again.

Five stars when using 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of the 3 ounces noted in the recipe. Because I did not have a cookie press and wanted to do something a little different (other than simply making drop cookies), I chilled the dough for about 1 hour and then rolled the dough into small balls, pressed a Hershey's kiss in the middle, and sprinkled the cookies with colored sugar. They turned out great. I will definitely be making this again. I believe another reviewer said she added some Jello mix to her batter with great success. I think I will try doing that next time--maybe use strawberry Jello for Valentine's day when I have to make cookies for my daughter to bring to  preschool.

I was confused by the reviewer who stated that the recipes was wrong using 3 oz. of cream cheese.  I don't remember using that small amount in any other recipes.  So, I used 6 oz, & that's all I changed.  PERFECTO!  Light, crisp, yet tender with no floury taste, just that nice cheese flavor.  I think this will be a keeper with 6oz.

I've tried this recipe as written in the past, and have been rather ho hum about it, it was very floury and no cream cheesy enough.  This time around I increased the cream cheese to 8 oz, decreased the flour to 2 1/4 cups and increased the extract (I used lemon) to 1 tsp.  The batter is DIVINE.  I have to wait a couple days till my teenaged girl elves come help me with the baking, and I did that on purpose so the cookie batter could get all friendly with itself.  So far so good!

This is a great base recipe! I made chocolate cheesecake cookies with my cookie press and they came out wonderful! Even my boyfriend (who doesn't like cookies, which is nuts, who doesn't like cookies???) loved them!! I used 8 oz. of cream cheese, 1 and 3/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa and at the last minute I added a splash of Kahlua so I added 2 more tbsp of flour.This is absolutely going in my recipe box at home!! Also, I only had them in for about 11 minutes and that was enough. I wanted them soft like cheesecake :)

These are very good when made with the 8 oz of cream cheese and only 2 cups of flour. The dough works well in the cookie press. With the cream cheese, the cookies will come out thinner than your traditional spritz, so that's good to know up front. The taste of these is fantastic and very soft and buttery.

I have been making these for years &  I always use  8 oz of cream cheese & only 2 cups of flour.  I usually make these for Christmas &  use the star tip on my  cookie press.  I put  red and green candied cherries on the top.

I LOVE these.  They are so easy to make and they are delicious.  I use 8oz cream cheese, 1 tsp vanilla extract (or almond if I want something different), and 2 cups of flour.  After they are somewhat cooled I sprinkle with powdered sugar.  They taste even better cold! :)

These were very tasty cookies, my boyfriend ate the whole batch!! I added extra sugar (we like things sweet) and I put Hersheys Mini Kisses on top on some, Reeses Chips on top of others, and also all different kinds of sprinkles (I think sugar crystals were best). They were very tasty.

These were so yummy!  I followed the advice of others and used all 8oz of cream cheese...how could that be bad!  I wasn't brave enough to use my cookie press...(It still scares me) But I used a small scoop and flattened them out.  Then the kids put the sprinkles on 'em.  They tasted great....Santa loved 'em!  Thanks Robin I can't wait to make them again!

These rich and wonderful cookies really hit the spot!  And they are beautiful to look at, too!  I made them with almond extract instead of vanilla, and also with 8-oz of cream cheese instead of 3.  I made them into balls, then pressed them with a small spoon in the middle to make space for filling.  I used an exquisite apricot preserve in the centers.  The cookies got rave reviews from my coworkers, who all said I was a little Martha Stewart!  Great for summer w/fruit preserve and would be great in fall/holidays with some chocolate and an almond in the center.  Yum.

I made these for Christmas trays, and filled half of the cookies with apricot preserves and the other half with strawberry jam.  After they cooled I criss-crossed each cookie with a a glaze made from powder sugar, softened butter, a little milk, and some almond extract.  The cookies are beautiful on trays, and tender and delicious.  Also easy and actually fun to make.

After reading reviews, I made these this morning. I did use 8 oz cream cheese, and 2 cups flour (all purpose flour, because it's what I had). When I tasted the dough, it did have a shortbread type flavor, so I added 1/2 c chopped pecans. Once baked (mine took 17 min to get firm enough to move), they are delicious, and have a great cream cheese flavor. I'll be making these again, thanks to the great reviews!

These are my favorite! I have the same recipe, I've made'em a zillion times, they don't need more cream cheese, my recipe calls for 1/4 teaspoon of salt, I roll the dough in the balls and press with flour dipped fork, keep them in the 375 degree oven untill golden brown( only takes a few minutes).

Very, very good! I even used margarine instead of butter. I don't have a cookie press, so I didn't try that. I basically scooped the dough out with a melon-baller and flattened each ball a little.  Then I made a dent in the center and filled it with strawberry jam.  Everyone loved the cookies. I will make them again!

I increased the cream cheese to 8 oz, decreased the flour to 2 cups, and doubled the vanilla.  Delicious!  They were all eaten in a couple of hours.

Great cookies!! Super Easy.  I used them as gifts for family this Easter.  One note: I found that adding a dash of lemon juice to the dough and using blackberry jam in the center was wonderful! Sprinkle w/ powdered sugar when cool.

Delicious, easy recipe. I used it with a cookie press from Williams-Sonoma, and they turned out beautiful Xmas Trees! The hint of cream cheese flavor is just enough to make these cookies better than the typical bland spritz cookies. I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time, thank you Robin for submitting a great one!

amazing cookies! I've made them 3x now (we had extra cream cheese), using other's suggestions (8oz. cream cheese and 2 1/2 c. flour) and they've disappeared! Note: the cookies will spread a little bit, but hold their general shape, to smooth out the edges or make thumbprints, I suggest dipping your finger in water so the dough won't stick.

I really don't know what to rate this recipe. I took the advice of others and used 8 oz. of cream cheese and 2 cup of flour. That way... they are so NOT cookie press friendly! Way to runny. But, when dropped by the spoon fulls, they are so darm yummy. I sprinkled colored sugar and spinkles on some but, found I liked them plain the best. I will be makeing these again.With modifications: Taste= 5 star; Cookie press dough= 1. So, I guess I'll rate this a 3.

I followed other reviewers advice and used 8oz of cream cheese in the cookies. I love the taste of cream cheese but I did not care for the flavor of these cookies. They tasted better after I added chocolate and walnuts but I would not make these again.

I made a batch of these without a press or anything, and they tasted great! It's a very refreshing change and individual recipe. It might be even better if you added chocolate chips or rasins, though.

I don't know what to think of these!  they held their shape well, but they were dense and filling little things.  The taste was mild; not sweet, but cheesy. I used the 8 oz pkg and jello like other reviewers.  Tasted fine, but I think if I want cheesecake flavor I'll make the real thing.  If I want cookies then I'll make cookies.  These were kind of like cheesecake biscuits.

These cookies were fantastic! like little cheese cakes!  I used 8 oz instead of 3 oz, One because i figured it was a typo and two because i love cream cheese.  They weren't too heavy, they were just perfect.  Great with strawberry and blueberry preserves!!

These cookies tasted like playdoh.  The kids wouldn't even eat them.  I baked about 3 dozen then decided to stop wasting my time and threw the rest of the dough away.

Very tasty cookie with the full 8 oz of cream cheese used instead of 3. I also added a tsp of baking soda to the mix to make them puff up a bit and opted for 1 tsp of vanilla instead of 1/2. I'm a ridiculous vanilla fan. I always double to amount. They're probably perfectly fine without the extra, too. I added semi and milk chocolate chips to the dough while mixing and dropped by large tsp. They turned out great. Both my son and husband loved them in their lunches :)

Recipe tasted great but I followed some other reviews and backed off the flour to 2 cups. Cookies were a little too sticky even after refrigerating for 1 hour. Other than being hard to get out of the cookie press- great tasting.

I took the advice of another reviewer to add a package of strawberry jello and increase the cream cheese to 8 oz.  Cookies baked 8-9 minutes only--at the recommended 15 they were burning black!

Dough was a little sticky...I probably should have used the full 2.5 c flour rather than cutting back to 2 as so many reviewers said.

Strawberry Cheesecake cookies were tasty though!

These are now on my yearly Christmas cookie list! 5 star flavor, but you REALLY do need 8 oz of cream cheese -- thus, 4 stars. Also used 1/2 cup unsalted butter & 1/2 cup margarine, for the flavor & texture. 2 1/4 cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar (filling adds adds to the sweetness, so I cut back on the sugar),  and almond flavoring.

I used the 8 ounces of cream cheese as suggested and 1 3/4 cups of flour. I also put rasberry perserves on top. But I have to say that these cookies reminded me of a biscuit.

This is the easiest cookie recipe I have ever used. I modified it somewhat and used 4 oz of cream cheese. I pressed a pecan half into each cookie and drizzled them with a glaze of powdered sugar, milk and vanilla. I will keep this recipe close for a quick treat or dessert. I'm sure it will encounter several variations, this is an excellent base for lots of flavors.

i made a variety of homemade cookies for my wedding last december, and these were amazing! i did follow the advice of some of the other chefs and changed the recipe to 8 ounces of sour cream and cut back on the flour a bit. my four star rating is only because the original needs to be altered. thank you for this recipe robin!

NOT GOOD AT ALL.  I even used the suggested changes. I put in 8oz of cream cheese and cut back on the flour.  They still tasted like bland flour cookies.  I can't believe the ratings are as high as they are.  I have never rated anything this low, but the consistency wasn't good, the flavor wasn't good, total waste.  We threw them away after we each ate one...

Recipe is fine. I add a quarter teaspoon lemon extract & yellow food coloring. Use swirl template of cookie press. Garnish with red sprinkles & half a Marascino cherry. Bake 10-15 minutes, but don't overbake. Makes a great cookie.

The Best cookies I've ever made!  I made these cookies with a splash of lemon extract.  I also filled the center with a strawberry jam that was low on sugar because this cookie is really sweet by its self.  The cookies were a hit at my holiday party.

Definately reduce the flour to less than 2 cups and they are wonderful!!!  Add some lemon extract or almond extract for an exotic flavor.

Used 8ox of cream cheese, and an extra half cup of flour but the dough was still very sticky.  Deliciously flavored the cookies taste better cold.  I'll give it another try, since humitity (or lack of it)can make a recipe stickier that usual.

This recipe is sooooo good!  After reading the other reviews, I did change the cream cheese to 8 oz and I reduced the flour to 2 cups.  Knowing the I was going to be putting chocolate on the top, I added some orange oil to the dough.  Great cookies!

I add 8 oz of cream cheese and the whole egg.  The cookies are soft and delicious.  I push the center before baking and put a lillte mount of mini chocolate chips. Great for a snack.

This was great.  I took someone's advice and used a full 8oz of cream cheese and cut the flour down to 2 cups.  No cookie press, no problem.  Don't waste the time, they'll be gone long before anyone can look at them.  I also topped each one off with a dollop of cream cheese frosting and wow!  The only mistake with this recipe is not quadrupling it!

Excellent!! Added 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of 3 oz.as suggested in a review and sprinkled colored sugar on top.....Once I tasted the cookie, I closed my eyes as it took me back to my early childhood days. I lost the recipe sooo many years ago, but here it is...THE BEST!

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter, and the texture was like a dry biscuit. The flavor was not sweet at all. I tried to underbake a batch to make them less dry, and it was still the strangest texture ever.

These cookies are delicious! Like many previous reviewers, I used 8 ounces of cream cheese and I used a little more vanilla (about 2 teaspoons - I usually add extra vanilla to recipes). I also put maraschino cherry halves in the center of the spoonfuls of dough before baking. After baking and cooling I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. I added the recipe with the modification to my recipe book. YUMMY!

Wow! 
Great recipe. I made it exactly as noted in the recipe. And the cookies were wonderful! I have an older large cookie press from Williams and Sonoma that is sadly no longer available, I used it to make these cookies and it is the very first recipe EVER that worked immediately with the press. Every single other recipe that I have used with the press goes through a bit of an adjustment period with the first few cookies going through the press. The very first cookie was absolutely perfect! And the cream cheese adds a wonderful moist texture. DELICIOUS!

I just finished devouring this recipe! I used 8 oz of cream cheese and 1/2 tbsp vanilla. I also popped in some semi-sweet chocolate chips and about 1 tbsp lemon juice and 1/4 tbsp key lime juice for some tartness. My husband loves them and I like the sweet and tangy mix.

Great tasting cookie.  I made a half batch using the drop spoon method and filled the centers with blackberry jam. I used 3 oz of regular cream cheese and 1 oz of strawberry cream cheese. Good stuff.

I think this recipe is fine on it's own. Traditionally I have used 4 oz cream cheese for every 2 cups of flour so that is the only change I would make (less 1/2 cup flour - increase 1 oz cream cheese.) especially if you intend to use some type of jelly as the flavor of cream chees + jelly can be very overpowering. Additionally you can relace the vanilla with preserves or cherry flavoring for an added touch.

I used the suggested 8oz of cream cheese, cut back on the flour too.  The dough tasted fabulous.  But too sticky to get through a press.  Just spooned it onto the sheet.  They are bland as anything.

Although my husband LOVES these cookies and has requested me to make these again, I have to say that I absolutely did NOT like them.   Shouldn't ever have to add any thing like blueberries in order to like something that I bake but...these are just not the greatest.

8oz Cream Cheese needed as other mention.  Cookies were good but I found that you need to refrigerate the dough before using a cookie press.

Doubled the cream cheese and vanilla as suggested.  Cookies had very little flavor. Very dissapointed.  Won't make these again.  There's so many better cream, ricotta and butter cookies recipes out there!

I have use this recipe for years.  I have used all of the same ingredients, only I used a whole egg and 4oz. cream cheese.  Then I refrigerate for one hour then use for roll-outs.  The trick is to roll the dough on the thick side. (a little less than 1/4") is plenty.  They are wonderfull!

Perhaps I did something wrong. At first I cut back on the flour, but the dough was too soft to mold. After I made the first batch the cookies were bland, so I sprinkled some sugar on top for the second batch. I also made a little dip in the center of the cookie and filled it with fruit jam. I'm not too sure I would make this recipe again...

No problems. These were very easy to make. I am not usually a big cookie fan, but these were good. Not to sweet. I'm not sure what size they were supposed to be, but I didn't get 72 out of the dough. (Although some of the dough was eaten by my kids)They were gone fast.

This is a good foundation for a cream cheese cookie.  After reading all the reviews,I decided to go with the full 8 oz of cream cheese but I changed a few of the  other ingredients.  I substitued one half cup of light brown sugar and used one half cup of white sugar.  I also used a full teaspoon of vanilla and added a splash of Bailey's with Caramel and I added one cup of chopped pecans to the dough and used a brown butter icing recipe that I got from Paula Deen's show on the FN.  They are rich and fabulous, try it out!

The recipe does not work with a cookie press, the dough is way too loose.  I didn't want to waste the butter and cream cheese I used in so I scooped teaspoons of the dough, rolled it flaked coconut and put a Hershey's kiss in the center then baked.  They came out fantastic...but the one star rating is because I wanted a cookie press recipe, this was not it.

I just made these and by mistake I added 8 oz of cream cheese instead of 3. I also cut the flour back to 2 cups only and added a teaspoon of salt. These cookies are fantastic. Simple recipe with great results!

In my opinion these were just alright, not great.  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviewers to increase the cream cheese and decrease the flour.  I also tinted them green for St. Patty's Day and sprinkled green sugar on top.  Cute, just not fabulous.

Five stars if you prepare this recipe my way -- which is to say that you use 4 oz. of cream cheese, not the suggested 3 oz. (Four stars if you use less than 4 oz. of cream cheese. If you use more than four, the cream cheese could make it too rich.) Also, pecan halves on top are what make these cookies especially dreamy. Make sure you put the pecans on before the cookies go in the oven -- so that they get nice and roasty-crunchy. Also, I found that I had to cook these cookies a little longer than 15 minutes. Depends on your oven, I guess. Also, I do recommend chilling the dough for at least an hour. I pinched off dough and rolled it into small balls then pressed pecans and candied cherry halves (red and green) onto each before baking.  It made about 4 dozen cookies.

I followed some of the others reviews and added some lemon juice for more of a "cheesecake" flavor. I baked them on my stone, instead of a cookie sheet. They turned out "ok", kinda buttery instead of a cheesecake flavor. I liked the dough better before baking though!! I will make these again, and use a cookie press next time! This is def a keeper!!

Thanks to the others for the reviews; it really helped make this cookie recipe delicious. I used 2 1/4 cups flour & used an 8oz pkg of light cream cheese & the taste was wonderful. They were soft and light; perfect with hot chocolate. Thanks again!

GOOD. Tastes yummy, like a cheesecake. I don't have a cookie press, and this makes me want to get one! I dropped by spoonfulls and they turned out pretty good. Pretty plain tasting unless you add the fruit as suggested though. I might try these again with another flavor in place of vanilla. Like cherry...

i also used 8 ounces of cream cheese for this recipe and i added some lemon juice and poppy seeds and it turned out awesome. Very good cookies, taste like little cheese cakes. And the bigger the drops off the spoon, the fluffier the cookie.

I am in LOVE with these cookies.  The texture, the flavor, and chewy heavenly crumbly yumminess -they were a huge hit for Christmas.  I added red and green sprinkles for a festive touch - it was a perfect addition.  Amazing, soft, PERFECT cookies!

I just made my second batch of these yummy cookies. They taste like a cheese 
cake, but in cookie form. The batter was easy to work with in a cookie press and
I sprinkled a tiny bit of red and green sugars for Christmas. This is a keeper 
recipe. Thanks, Robin.

My family loves this recipe.  It is by far the best cookie press recipe we have tried.  I have made these for several of my son's school parties and they go over great with the kids and the other Moms.

I used this recipe to use my cookie press for the first time.  These cookies were a hit!  They are so easy to make too.  So pretty with the perserve or a chocolate chip on my flower shapes!  Cheese cake flavor! Thanks Robin!

An excellent recipe.  I didn't grease cookie sheets. I used my cookie press (my yield was 115 cookies) and placed a milk chocolate chip in the center of each one.  Made them for a fundraiser and everyone wanted to know the name of the bakery.  Thank you, Robin!

A new family favorite. I did it both with a cookie press and by rolling into a ball. The ball type I rolled into some ground walnuts, placed on cookie sheet and pressed flat. In the center I pressed a whole pecan and baked. My husband RAVED about this. Same dough but a different taste from the cookie pressed kind. That's great versatility.

These were wonderful. They tasted so good, we were eating them hot from the rack while the next pan was baking. I used a flower cookie press with strawberry jam centres. Make sure you make a thumbprint for the jam to stay in or it runs down the side of the cookie, and they don't look as pretty. We had to eat all the "bad" ones right away... :)

I had to use margarine, as I am allergic to butter, so the taste was a bit different. I compensated by adding 1/4 tsp lemon juice and 1/4 tsp pink salt. I also lessened the flour by 1/2 cup because my dough was getting too stiff to use a press. For a finishing touch I added a half of a cinnamon sugar pecan in the middle of my pressed cookies. Very tasty and festive!

This is almost exactly like our family recipe.   We used a whole egg and a teaspoon of baking powder.   
I used 8 oz of cream cheese per the reviews and the cookies were really heavy.   
Didn't like the texture so won't do that again.   
Our family likes lemon, so I sub 1 tablespoon  of lemon juice for the vanilla.   
I also make a glaze of lemon and powdered sugar after baking and then decorate.  These are much bettter  if you use a cookie press.   Chill the dough a bit in the cylinder before pressing.

I love the cookie itself, it's not overly sweet.  I used all kinds of toppings, different jams, pecans, cranberries, choc chips.

I used 8 oz cream cheese with 2 cups flour and a tad more vanilla extract. Half of cookies were thumbprints with blackberry preserves and other half were thumbprints with chocolate. I did have some dough left over so I made 6 plain cookies afterwards. My batches needed a lot more baking time (they both were still raw at the 15 min mark in the oven). So my cookies had to bake for 23-25 minutes at 350 degrees but then again I used parchment paper to line my cookie sheets for quick clean up so maybe that was messing with timing. I did find that the dough  is sturdy and thick enough when raw / not very wet or sticky so I was easily able to work it with gloved hands. Easy recipe and pretty basic yet somewhat mild flavor. Reminds me of a milder shortbread flavor and the cookies were soft with a little bit of crunch. I might add some more cream cheese and different flavorings to my next batch I make.

This recipe is great!    I used a full 8 oz block of cream cheese because I love the cream cheese flavor.   I made no other changes and the cookies are wonderful!    As a side note, I purchased a new OXO Good Grips cookie press and this recipe is almost identical to the recipe included with the cookie press.   A couple of things to note:   The OXO recipe specifies Unsalted butter, and says to cube the cold butter.   I think this helps to minimize the stickiness when using the press.   This is now my go to sugar cookie recipe.

FOR GODSSAKE take the recipe down! If  it's wrong , please correct it. NOT 3 oz of cream cheese. It's 8 oz. People are making it incorrectly and not knowing it until it's too late. Wasting their time and money.

I was so easy.  I use a the bottom of a highlighter to push small "thumb print" shapes, then filled them with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  When the cookies came out of the oven, I use the flat edge of a knife to spread the chocolate in the dip.

Used 8 oz cream cheese as others had suggested and rolled them into one inch balls which I flattened slightly. Made a small indentation with the back of a teaspoon and filled with raspberry jam.  Very good cookie and could really taste the cream cheese.  Would make again.

I used almond extract in place of vanilla because they taste more "Christmas-y" to me. I would have given 5 stars except that the dough didn't work well with the cookie press. I tried to do a drop cookie instead but they didn't spread so I had cookie drops and strangely shaped  Christmas  trees.  I will use the recipe again (with 8oz of cream cheese)  but will try rolling them into balls then pressing them down with the back of a spoon so they can all be uniformed.

They are rather quite easy  and fast to make if you're a seasoned cook. I'm not into cookies but tried this recipe cause I was bored of the chocolate chip and the oatmeal cookies. I wanted something different for the family to snack on at work/school.

I used 1 block/250g/1cup/8oz. of cream cheese and 1tsp of vanilla since why not? 

The only problem was that the recipe didn't specify that if you shape them like a ball (since I don't own a cookie press nor do I want one), they would retain the shape, unlike oatmeal or chocolate chip cookies.

However, I think this is a bonus cause once they cool, you can dip them in chocolate and have them be hard shelled cookies! Soft, chewy, and puffy! It's a cheesecake in less than 30mins!

Excellent recipe. Worked perfectly on our press. Just 1 modification which resulted to a successful outcome. We added almond extract as oppose to vanilla. These babies flew.
Yummy and thanks!

Rated it on recipe as presented. I had no issues with taste or being able to use it in a cookie press.  I did lower temp to 350 deg. but only because I have a convection oven.  I do think it's worth considering adding more flavor if you aren't going to ice them or use much sugar for decorating. I've made lots of Spritz recipes, and use of more vanilla or swapping for almond, orange, lemon or peppermint extracts is common if you aren't decorating much.  I do like this recipe best of the ones I've tried.  A hint for cookie press is I don't chill the dough unless it starts getting sticky, but I do put my silicone sheet or nonstick cookie sheet in the freezer, so the cookies stick to the pan and not the cookie press.  I use parchment a lot for baking, but find it doesn't work with these.  Thanks for the recipe!

Too sweet, the cookie came out really thin so it didn't take the shape of the cookie press. Also crumbled apart easily. Followed recipe to a tee.

I put in an 8oz block of cream cheese and a small package of strawberry jello. I don't have a cookie press so I dropped by teaspoons. You must press down a bit; the cookies do not spread when cooked. I baked only 10 minutes. The are awesome and the colour is very bright.

First time using this recipe and I have to say it is really gd!! I used 8oz of cream cheese and 1 tsp of vanilla, also I used more flour on the ones in cookie press. Ones with apricot in the middle I did not use extra flour. I would make these again my kids cannot get enough of them!!

Even with 8 ounces of cream cheese the flour is way too much. 
It took way too much cream cheese to fix it...so I strongly suggest you add a cup of flour or less and check the texture...and taste...definitely taste it!!! And have others too..in case you taste it too much!! If you change the serving amount to less, definitely check.

I used 8oz of cream cheese and added a dash of salt as I was using unsalted butter. Also only used 2C of flour (but next time, I would use likely 2 1/4 -1/2C. I thought my dough was good but it ended up being a touch too soft to use in my cookie press). Great to use in cookie press. I also use the dough to make thumbprint cookies using jams, as well as just plain round cookies with a pecan pressed on top. Really yummy. For some reason though, at 325F, I had to bake my cookies for about 20mins (and even longer for thumbprints... approx 22mins). Overall, I would definitely use this recipe again.

I used 8oz of cream cheese every time.
I treated them like oatmeal cookies in that I rolled them into walnut sized balls then flattened them with a glass bottom covered in sugar.
My topping experiment was a success in that I used applesauce in leiu of preserves.  Then sprinkled cinnamon on the top. They were delicious with coffee.

Today's  experience is the same recipe, adding chocolate chips to the mix. They smell amazing thusfar.

I would recommend trying the recipe AS IS before making changes.  I altered the recipe per reviews and shouldn't have done that.  I will retry the recipe again.  I had to pipe my cookies out; the dough was too sticky for my press.  The taste was OK, nothing WOWWY.

I used the entire 8oz of cream cheese and these cookies were fabulous! Strawberry preserves pressed into the center made a delicious strawberry cheesecake-ish cookie! I made these for Christmas and they were a huge hit!

Be very careful!  These are the BEST cookies ever!  And are extremely addictive!  Once you start, you will not want to stop.  By dropping spoonfuls you will get small bite size cookies which are perfect.  Before baking I brushed the tops with egg whites then added colored sugar crystals for the holiday flare.  Be creative.  Add what ever you want to the tops.

Wow!  These were great!  As long as you add 8 ounces of cream cheese and maybe a bit more vanilla extract this works!  Be prepared to freeze part of the dough because this makes a lot of cookies!  :)

Used an 8 ounce package of cream cheese and 2 cups of flour, with these changes, these cookies are probably my favorites ever. I have done them plain and with strawberry and blackberry jam. Also tried chocolate chips but they are better plain.

I made these as drop cookies and added 8 oz cream cheese as others have suggested.  They had a very strong cream cheese flavor, so I may try to add jam and/or white chocolate chips next time.

Was this recipe suppose to have baking powder in it? The cookies came out very flat. They tasted good, I used 5 oz. of cream cheese & about 1 3/4 cup flour. I used my cookie press, worked great !

These are yummy...used my cookie press and colored them with food coloring in fall colors for Thanksgiving. I, too, added the 8 oz. of cream cheese, and it didn't overpower the cookie at all. Even my pickiest eater took one and said they were really good. Nice, melt in your mouth cookie...will definately make again. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly as shown. However, I found the cookies to be a little on the bland side. I used chocolate rosebuds in the centers of the cookies, but I'm sure they'd be better with fruit filling. A good cookie recipe, none the less.

I used 8oz of cream cheese like someone else had suggested & these came out great.  However, this is not a good dough to use with a cookie press, as it was far too sticky.  I put some chocolate shavings on top & they tasted almost like a little chocolate cheesecake!  Delicious!

I increased the amount of cream cheese to 8 oz, and the cookies still taste like flour. Don't think I will make these again but thank you for posting the recipe and afforded me the opportunity to try it. The dough worked very well with my cookie press.

I made these as Christmas gifts for our friends and neighbors.  I am gluten intolerant so I had my teenage daughter try them and she gave them a 4! 

I used 8 ounces of cream cheese and they turned out nicely.  I pressed a few chocolate chips into the tops to dress them up a bit.

I used 3 oz. for a batch and it turned out perfect!  I ended up making two batches!  Chilled dough for 2 hrs. and then rolled it out and made cut outs.  Perfect!  Best cut out cookie recipe.  This is a KEEPER!  The 3 oz. is definitely not a typo!

This recipe was great. I gave it 4 because I changed the amount of cream cheese to 8 oz. Plus I did add some lemon flavor. The other reviews helped me to decide to make the change.

I was so excited to try my new cookie press out, and even moreso when I found a recipe that called for the cream cheese I needed to use up! And then my cookie press didn't press the cookies out properly... So I just did drop cookies. I did a half-batch, used margarine instead of butter, and I used 4 ounces of cream cheese in the half-batch. Only using 3 ounces for a full batch is crazy, you want to TASTE the cheese! I used half a yolk, more like a teaspoon of vanilla, and only a cup of flour. With all the required changes, the original recipe only rates 4, but my end product was a 5. Soft, cheesy, and delicious. :) Thanks so much for the recipe, Robin!

Thanks BMALY...I came across your review yesterday and decided I had to try these w/your suggestion of the jello thus being able to color my Valentine's cookies w/the red in the jello.  I only had raspberry and was hesitant but used it anyway and it tastes like raspberry cheesecake...used 4 tbsp. of jello powder.  I am sure I would love the strawberry better and that is just a great suggestion.  Thanks to the other reviewers for straightening out the cream cheese measurement.  I used the full 8oz. but kept the flour the same.  They ran beautifully through my electric press w/heart stencil.  Press died half way through so I then used small size scoop and rolled the top in red sugar and used the heart stencil and pressed down on top flattening out the cookie and creating a heart on top...they came out so cute...3D effect.  Don't throw away your stencils if your cookie press gives out.  They smelled wonderfully baking and came out like a picture; no sticking to the sheet and have a buttery mild cream cheese flavor.  With the correct amt. of cream cheese, these are a 5.

I think these cookies taste much better and lighter after the first day. The night I baked them, they tasted mostly like flour. Perhaps a smidge more of cream cheese, a cherry on top, or a sprinkle of colored sugar might do the trick... I'm not sure. These cookies also turned out dense because I did not have a cookie press available. In lieu, I rolled the dough into little balls and flattened them a bit. These cookies hold their consistency extremely well and do not spread, so I recommend the cookie press if you're concerned about presentation. Without the cookie press, they look very plain and unappetizing. Also dropping them by spoonfuls, makes them look more like miniature biscuits than cookies.

These cookies are okay.  When you try these cookies, don't think that they are going to taste just like cheesecake.  They do have a nice cheesecake-like texture, but they taste more like flour than cheesecake.   I made these cookies with a cookie press and only baked them for 10 minutes.  I didn't add anything to them, but they would probably be great with chocolate chips.

I personally didn't care much for them but my family thought they were great.(And they are very picky.) I had to flatten them with a spoon because they wouldn't spread.

I added some chocolate chips as an experiment, and they were wonderful! Very easy cookie and very tasty!

Meh.  These weren't so good.  I'd rather save my cream cheese for something else.

My sister has made these at Christmas for years.  We put half a maraschino cherry in the middle.  Very festive looking and yummy!  Once I start eating them I just can't stop!  My kids don't like them as much (one doesn't like cherries) so I have also made them plain and put a hershey's kiss in the middle after baking while they are still hot from the oven.  This year I am going to try to roll the mint M&Ms in half of the dough and see if my daughter likes them that way.  I refuse to stop making them!!!  We will forever have some version of them for the holidays.

We even like the dough raw.  Makes great cookies.  I use a cookie press.  If dough is too sticky/ soft, refrigerate until slightly firmed.  In addition to these as is, I like to sandwich 2 cookies together with melted white chocolate & a dab of raspberry jam.

This is by Far the best Spritz recipe I have tasted! I did not chill the dough first, and had no problems..  (that takes too long!) I did add the vanilla, and also added 1 tsp of almond extract and the taste was so yummy they didn't last long! I suggest a double batch they are so good!

My husband adores these cookies. I usually don't get any when I make them, because he gets up during the night and polishes them off.

How wonderful - a simple recipe that is simply delicious!  Thank you, Robin.  I dropped by the spoonful this time but will try in a cookie press another time.  So fast, so pretty & festive- looking and will be a great gift (if I hide them).

The cookies are like little white snow flowers and they taste good too. The lighter the bottoms the better the taste.
