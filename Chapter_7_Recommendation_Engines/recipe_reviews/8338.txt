We LOVED this filling!  I drained the ricotta for two days (got busy and left it draining in the fridge longer than planned), but it must have helped because it was not runny when mixed as some others stated.  Left out the almonds, but I didn't miss them.  Great recipe, just be sure to fully drain your ricotta so it's a thicker mixture to pipe into the shells.

Excellent recipe - I have made this a few times and have now settled on smooth ricotta cheese and a touch more amaretto ;-)

I SO regret making this recipe... It is just SOOOO good!!!! I used 3/4 pint of ricotta and 1/4 pint whipped cream stirred together. I also soaked the cherries in amaretto for a few hours prior to making. This is definitely a 'birthday-and-special-occasion' treat! Thanks, Janice!

Great recipe, excellent taste!  I didn't have the runny issue that some of the others had when making....Mine came out perfect.  Word of advice, which I forgot...Don't fill the shells with the cream until you are ready to serve.  

I tried to make these ahead of time, put the mixture in a ziploc bag, so I could cut the corner and pipe it in but it looked to good, so I filled the shells.  Made the shells a bit moist.

Oh, and one other thing....I had to improvise for the shells, my market didn't have even the frozen shells, so I used the Sugar cones for ice cream in place of the cannoli shells.  

I know the real italians out there would probably run me out of town, but I think I liked them better, It filled the whole shell and was such a subtle difference in taste.  Great Recipe.

I was a little dissapointed with the original recipe. As written, it's missing alot of essentials. For example, you MUST must must drain your ricotta. If you don't, after about 5 minutes it will be a soupy mess. Your ricotta may not look watery, but when it sits it melts. Also, I added orange zest to give it a bit more flavor. Don't go too crazy, just a bit (1/2 tsp) to kick it up. Another thing I did that was REALLY, REALLY helpful when I had that soupy mess was add heavy whipping cream (one pint). I whipped it with my hand mixer till it could stand on it's own (careful not to over mix...becomes lumpy) and then blended that into my cannoli filling. It made it very creamy and even now, a few days later, its still thick. 

I would recommend adding a bit of vanilla as well (1.5 tsp) but, only if your ricotta is drained well. I feel like that's the only thing my cannoli's were missing. I got really amazing shells at Wegmans for about .50 a piece. Alessi Shells...was in the pasta section in my Wegmans for some reason.

OMG this is the recipe to keep, 5+++ stars. I used Sorrento whole milk velvetty smooth ricotta. I did not even need to drain this type. No almonds. I used 1/8 t almond extract and 1T water in place of the amaretto liquer. Skipped the cocoa powder, dusted with conf sugar and 1 cherry at each end!! I made my own cannoli shells with my pizzelle maker. AWESOME

Good recipe. I omitted the almonds and added a little more amaretto. Be sure not to stir the mixture up too much, or it will become runny. Tastes best with homemade shells.

These were delicious. I needed to use up some ricotta cheese and found this recipe. I also had some shells from World Market.  Upped the amaretto a bit and added a little bit of orange liquor as well.

Absolute wonderful.  Couldn't have asked for anything easier.  Served it at a formal dinner last night and got rave reviews.  Used Fresh Raspberries and almond slivers to garnish.

I left out the almonds and cherries and used almond extract with water instead of the liqueur. I used Sargento's ricotta and I didn't have a problem with water at all. I made them for Christmas and filled the shells right before dinner. The ones that were left were still crisp and heavenly the next day.

Excellent recipe.  Will be making this one many more times.  However, you must drain the ricotta for at least a day in the fridge.

Pretty good.  The only flaw is using part-skim cheese, hence the poor texture.  Use WHOLE MILK

This was my first attempt at making cannoli filling.  This was delicious!  Super easy but very impressive to our dinner guests!  I drained my ricotta in a strainer for a few hours before combining the ingredients.  I, too, omitted the almonds and didn't miss them at all! I will definitely be making these again!

Absolutely fabulous!  I put in 1/4 tsp of almond extract and skipped the water, I like the extra flavor and a thicker consistency.

The flavors were there but the consistency was too thin for me.  I'm not certain yet what I would do differently next time.  Maybe more powdered sugar?

I made this filling recipe (doubled it) with store-bought shells. I drained my whole-milk ricotta two days, and I used pure almond extract with water as per the tip (doubled this) and added it to taste, so the filling would not become too runny. Omitted almonds. It was delicious and a hit at my best friend's bridal shower!

Excellent, I didn't have amaretto,so I substituted almond extract. Drained my ricotta for a day before I mixed with other ingredients. I made my own shells and this was a perfect filling.

This was decent filling. I used everything the recipe said, but omitted the almonds and substituted the almond extract and water. The filling was very runny (I did not read the comments enough to learn to drain it.) but after a bit more sugar and refridgerating it for a while I got it to work. It tastes good, a bit TOO almondy for my taste, but not like a cannoli. I suggest you try it yourself

the recipe was good but it wasn't sweet enough for me.  also, i didn't strain my ricotta first and wish i had.  i made the whole recipe and used it in the center of 2 9" layer cakes with homemade frosting from this site.  it had some wow factor at a famliy dinner.

It was a huge success!! Everyone loved it!!
I could only find the mini shells, but that was all right as well...the ones who wanted a taste could have one and the ones who wanted more did so. Thanks for sharing!!

Good flavor, but the filling was too thin.

I found the consistency of this to be really off from what I am used to from a italian pastry shop.  I'll stick with buying these as a treat when I find them in a good bakery.

If I could give this zero stars, I would. This tastes nothing like any cannoli filling I have ever eaten. I used top notch Ricotta, replaced Amaretto with Almond oil (as the owner of the Italian bakery I got the shells/cheese from stated - only one drop! a tablespoon would have you gagging). I kept having to add sugar to get any hint of sweetness, going by other recipes I also added some vanilla to try and help it. Nothing I added to this even helped it come close to tasting like a cannoli. I tasted the filling from beginning to end, starting with this recipe and then trying to doctor it with others on here.
