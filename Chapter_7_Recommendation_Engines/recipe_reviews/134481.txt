Hi itz CraZee...the creator of the recipe.  I see here that a few people had a hard time getting the sauce to thicken (it has never happened to me) so I read the recipe over....there SHOULD be a generous tbsp or so of flour in the wine cream mixture!    My bad for forgetting it in the directions.  Sorry, fellow cooks!    With the flour added there should be no problem thickening the sauce.  Well except for Molly...I have no idea what she did to clog a whisk LOL.......:-O

This recipe is the best. I have been looking for a seafood/pasta dish with a white sauce. I deleted the cajun seasoning and added one tbls of sourcream instead of 2. So easy to make. My kids and I loved it.

Great dish! after reading the other reviews i was worried about the sauce thickening correctly so I poured 1/2 the milk in with the wine and then added 2 tbls of flour to the remaining milk and wisked until completely disolved and then added it in before adding the sour cream and cheese. Worked well and the sauce thickened just enough. 

Also used sea scallops and sliced in large pieces and they came out great, melted in our mouths! 
Thanks for the recipe!

I make this a LOT.  My husband and I really like it.  I dont put the peppers in cause we dont like them, but I do add crab meat and sometimes these little lobster tails I found at Aldies as well as roasted garlic.  Also there is a thickening ingredient that was left off and CraZee tells you what it is in her review on here.  Enjoy!  We do.

I thought this was very tasty!  I have experienced the hard blobs of milk/wine/cheese and found that if you start with the wine and simmer it, then once it has simmered add the cheese, then sour cream, then milk it doesn't blob up.

Very good.  The family loves it.  I don't use all the 'fresh' ingredients but even using boxed pasta and dried herbs it is still fabulous.

Macde this last night, made a few changes and it was ouitstanding.  I agree that the mixture of wine and milk do not cream well  additionally the Parm cheese does not melt.  I added a dollop of cream, a pat of butter, then dissoveled cornstarch n a litter water.  Reduced the heat and added the cornstarch.  Creamy, rich sauce!!! Sauted a fewwe sweet onion strips , red and green pepper strips, and a smashed garlic glove.  when translucent, added shrimp, scallops and crab meat.    Used thin spaghetti (that's all I had), Drained it, poured the seafood on the pasta and then the sauce on top of that.  Very Good!!! Will definitely put this in the cook Book

Just really didn't care for this. When you mix the wine and the milk together, it makes a scary-looking curdled mess; only later does it sort of come together after the other elements are added. And the wine gives the sauce a sour taste that is not to my liking. (I used a sauvignon blanc; maybe a less dry white would give a better result.)

This is the first recipe I've used off this site and I loved it. My boyfriend liked it so much, he ate it for breakfast the next day! We added mushrooms, garlic, oregano and basil, and left the cilantro out. We also added flour to thicken the sauce. It turned out great!!

d the directions and got hard melted blobs of the cheese floating in the liquid and stuck on the bottom of the pan.  My whisk got clogged. Would not use this recipe again.

Even though fresh pasta as the recipe calls for would have been ideal, it seems to be non-existent in my area so I had to use dry. And, even though we love scallops, they are too expensive right now so I used all shrimp. The flavor is good and even though I think parsley might be a better choice, the cilantro worked too. Unlike most of the other reviewers, my sauce ended up rather thick without the addition of flour. This is one I would make again and I think I'll add some sliced mushrooms next time.

The sauce is the best part of this dish. The sauce can be applied to many seafood dishes. Using pasta in this dish is fine but a bit heavy. Rather replace the pasta with a hearty vegetable.

although it did have a little flavor, i think the cilantro was a mistake; parsley would have been a better choice.the sauce dissapeared once poured over the pasta(angel hair) making a sticky mess. believe it or not, i think adding the flour caused that. i might try again omitting cilantro and adding the italian parsley and not adding the flour.we will see. if i do, i'll be sure to update my review.....

Turned out very good.  I used a little extra cajun seasoning and added cornstarch to thicken.  Very good.

I followed the recipe pretty closely.  It might not look like it but my changes were very minor...Packaged pasta, not fresh; no bell peppers, used home grown/home frozen green beans instead; parsley instead of cilantro (which I loathe).  I heated the milk a bit 1st, then added the wine, it started to look very slightly curdled but with whisking the sour cream and the Parmesan in quickly it smoothed out.  I used a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  This was a delicious dish, my husband has said 3 times already how much he enjoyed this dinner tonight.  I will be making this dish again.

It is interesting that the reviews run from great to bad. I had the same problem as Molly and Edie. The wine and milk curdled instantly when they were put together and it just got worse as it cooked. I proceeded anyway and the lumps got smaller but did not go away and it never did get thick. Will not make it again.

Didn't care for this at all. Not enough sauce for the amount of pasta. And I couldn't get the sauce to thicken either.
