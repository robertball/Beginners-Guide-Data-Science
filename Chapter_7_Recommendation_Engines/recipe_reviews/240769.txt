Good recipe, but next time I make it I will omit the sugar.  I used sweetener instead of sugar but it was still very sweet.  Also may need to use a pack of unflavored gelatin to help set.  Recipe as it is, is very loose.

Well received at family Christmas. Nice that it doesn't have to chill overnight. I used 8oz. can of crushed pineapple so it set up better. Think I used a 3 oz. box of raspberry jello and a 3 oz. box of cherry jello. Yummy!

I made it with raspberry gelatin.  Who doesn't love cran-raspberry anything?  So delicious!
