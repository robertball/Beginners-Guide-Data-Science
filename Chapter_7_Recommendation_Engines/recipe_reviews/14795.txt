Try tomato soup instead of paste I know it sounds weird but cabbage and tomato soup tastes real yum-o and (my) kids like it. I think this recipe is a keeper it's economical and I will try using the slow cooker next time any suggestions?

Easy to prepare good flavor (a little bland to be called spicy I think) Had to cook longer than recipe suggested. Next time I'll use a lot less water.

My kids loved the meat but were a bit skidish on the cabbage. The flavor of the cabbage was really good.

This was a big dissapointment for me. I didn't like it very much and neither did my family.
