Very similar to a good Gnocchi. The trick is to keep the potatoes from absorbing water which is why you have to keep the skins on the potatoes when boiling. Then, your input of flour will be lower and result in fluffier nudeln. Be careful of overmixing and/or adding too much flour you'll end up with gloppy, dense noodles. Also, a restaurant trick is to bake the potatoes in the oven, and it's very important to mix the egg in while the potatoes are still warm, otherwise the albumen won't react with the starch and it'll be harder to get a good quality nudeln

I lived in Germany for three and a half years, and after stumbling across this recipie I knew I had to make it--the final product is an extremely authentic noodle, and tastes exactly like I remember. They are also very good sauteed with onion. :)

This recipe is NOT wrong, as other reviewers have suggested. Following the prep directions is very important. I cooked the potatoes with the skin on, peeled them after they had cooled slightly, and added the other ingredients (just a 1/2 cup of flour), just as the recipe says, and my dough was fine. If you keep the skins on while cooking it keeps the water out and you'll only need that 1/2 cup of flour, otherwise they get soggy and then it's necessary to use more.

Giving two stars due to incorrect directions and difficulty of preparation; it still tasted great after I did my own troubleshooting!

The directions for the recipe do not work! I'd highly recommend peeling the potatoes before cooking as I lost half to the trash trying to peel soft potatoes!

Also, the amount of flour suggested is bogus! For 6 servings it said 1/4 cup. I needed to add 2 cups before my potato mixture would even roll out on a heavily floured surface. 

Tasted good but didn't get very good "noodle" shapes due to low flour content. I'd recommend upping the flour. My grandmother made these for years and never gave a recipe before getting Alzheimer's.

I am a fan of Schupfnudeln!!!
This recipe is quite good, I would just suggest some little changes. I would use floury potatoes and cook them the previous day, otherwise the flour is not sufficient. This also solves the problem of peeling. Also I personally always simmer the formed noodles before frying them (just like gnochi) ! Great recipe for great food...especially with sauerkraut!

Lovely!  Tasted almost exactly like I remember from the Christmas Market in Germany.  I omitted the parsley as I had none.  Also used just a tad more flour.  I added the browned nudeln to fried sauerkraut with chopped cooked bacon (similar to how they served it at the Christmas market).  Such a treat!

This was a very good recipe, "almost" like what I also remembered from the Mannheim, Germany Christmas Market.  I did make a few changes.  Like others, I had to add more flour to get it to a texture to roll out.  Probably 1 1/2 cups or more.  Since I don't like things very bland, I added just a touch of garlic powder and paprika and thought that enhanced the taste.  Other recipes had mentioned dropping the noodles in boiling salted water for about one minute (until they float to the top).  I did this, lifting them out with a slotted spoon and draining them before putting them in the skillet to fry. I made these with seasoned saurkraut and chopped bacon and onions (like in Germany).   My husband and I really enjoyed it.  I had a lot of the uncooked noodles left over, so I put them on a cookie sheet and froze them, then put them in a plastic bag for another meal.  Don't know yet how that will work out.

I cooked the wife a "German" meal for the first time after trying all the local restaurants through the years. I followed the directions as printed and didn't have a single problem. It's the easiest potatoes I have ever peeled. Probably used a little more flour than called for but just for handling and rolling. Cooked just enough for one meal and put the balance on wax paper in the freezer. Bagged them and cooked them later. Awesome. I'll probably spice the next batch a little bit with onion and garlic, but otherwise, delicious!!

Very good and fairly easy to make.  Never made them before or anything like it so I am assuming that it turned out correct.  Would have been easy to make into small patties.

This recipe works correctly to produce authentic Schupfnudeln. However, as another reviewer pointed out, you must follow the instructions exactly to get the very dry, starchy potatoes this recipe requires. You must use the correct potatoes, meaning only russet baking potatoes. Red potatoes, Yukon gold potatoes, or any other kind of potatoes won't work. You must boil the potatoes IN THE SKIN. Heavily salting the water you boil the potatoes in also helps to draw moisture out of them. Peel the potatoes while they're still hot by holding them on a fork and using a paring knife to pull the skin off, much like pulling old skin off an old sunburn (sorry for the imagery, but that's exactly what the peeling process is like). Lightly mash the potatoes and add the egg while they're still hot, then quickly mix in the flour, being careful not to over mix. I don't roll out the dough, but rather roll bits of it between my palms to make soft, rustic noodles. They taste best cooked in bacon fat or butter.

Good recipe but who still uses lard? Nasty.  Used butter instead, and they were fabulous.

This recipe is great except for one factor... you need to bake the potatoes.  I have tried twice by boiling the potatoes with the skins ON and the mixture still had too much water in it.  If you bake the potatoes this recipe is really great and makes a good noodle.  I recommend serving it with sauerkraut and bits of bacon.  If you fry up the bacon first, you can use the bacon grease as your "lard" in this recipe.  Cooking the bacon, sauerkraut and noodles over very low heat for 15 minutes will help the flavors of the three items blend.

I just made this tonight for an Oktoberfest party I am attending tomorrow.  I have never heard of this dish and made it simply for the event.  OMG...it is soooo good!  I had to threaten my family to make them stop stealing from the dish.  I fried some sauerkraut, onions, apple and added bacon bits....served the potatoes over it.  I had gotten the idea from other posts and other German recipes that I saw online.  It might not be authentic German but, it was wonderful.

I omitted the parsley and the nutmeg because when I was in Heidelburg and had this dish, it wasn't in it.  Even though it was a little work, it was worth it.  Browned them up and moved them into another pot with a little chopped onion and then added sauerkraut and sausage.

Yea!!! A "broocheban" recipe!!!! I have been searching for a recipe for years! My grandmother passed away while I was living overseas and I didn't have the opportunity to get it from her.

My suggestion to those folks that ended up with a sticky dough:  lay them out on a floured board, or counter to allow them to dry a bit before you boil them.  My grandmother made these all the time and that's what she would do so they wouldn't end up tough.  She NEVER added parsley, or anything.
We would eat these with sauerkraut, mashed potatoes and pork roast, especially for New Year's Day family get together.  She also made what she called chopped cabbage.  You grate a head of cabbage  and boil it in a big pot with enough flour to make it thick, season to taste.  YUMMM, the memories.

I followed directions (boiled potatoes in their skin) and made them "as is".  My "dough was very sticky.  I probably used about one cup and the dough still couldn't be kneaded and was very sticky.  I could not roll them out, so I formed fingers.  I let them set and fried them.  They are like fried mashed potatoes and very mushy inside.  I think onion and/or garlic is needed to perk up the flavor.  They are not at all like a noodle.

This is an excellent recipe  -- I followed it  for the exception of cooking the noodles in lard, I used butter and it was fabulous. Everyone loved it.

The browned butter on the crispy outsides contrasts nicely with the soft inside of the noodles. THey are great.
