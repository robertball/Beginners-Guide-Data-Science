Great recipe. The only change was the use of a Memphis Rib Rub in lieu of the cajun seasoning. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and the ribs turned out great!

Great recipe.  I followed the recipe as stated, but added half of a banana pepper to give it a kick and would strongly suggest doing this for anyone else thinking of trying these. I also added Lawry's seasoning salt to the ribs which added flavor.  One thing I would do differently is use some type of rib-rub because they came out a little dry.  Other than that no complaints.

I used chops as I did not get ribs from my deer. I can only imagine how amazing the ribs would be. The chops were pretty good. The apple vinegar adds a nice tartness to the vegetables and meat. Not bad, would like to do this again with the ribs. Also next time I will probably substitute the oven for the slow cooker.

The recipe is easy to follow, and did deliver on its promise of tender ribs(I cooked up a rack of mule deer ribs). I found the vinegar far too overpowering though. next time I will cut it in half or less, and make up the difference with apple juice. Finishing in the oven with a sweet BBQ sauce helped a lot with the strong vinegar taste.

This recipe works very well with deer ribs.  I've made it twice now and plan to make it my default deer ribs recipe.  My wife even likes it.

Too much work for not much flavor
