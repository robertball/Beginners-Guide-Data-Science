This was just OK for us. Have to be honest, we didn’t care for the strong flavor of paprika. Don’t know why this is called “Sicilian” roasted chicken because paprika is not a spice that is really used in Sicily or any part of Italy for that matter. More like “Hungarian” chicken. I make a similar dish to this without the paprika, but add granulated garlic, onion powder, dried oregano & rosemary, or some already mixed dried Italian seasoning. First step is to  dry the chicken pieces off with paper towels before adding seasonings so it browns up nicely and has a crispy skin. If using all breasts, give them a light brushing with olive oil first. This helps to keep the meat moister.  Then just lay it out on a sheet pan and roast for about 35-45 min at  400°, depending on what kind of oven you have. Mine is convection so takes less time. Easy and delicious.

Basically this is a roasted chicken but in parts rather than a whole chicken.  Roasted chicken is so much better tasting than fried chicken.  As for the comment about paprika ( it is a fine crushed red pepper which can be sweet depending on which you use), it is a staple in most Sicilian cooking recipes.

Simple and yummy! I have to admit that I did just eyeball the seasonings. I used a mix of legs and thighs b/c that's what my family likes the best. Really nice flavors...I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used large chicken Breasts instead of pieces and it turned out great.  Doesn't need quite the time for baking, probably 45 minutes vs an hour.   It made the Chicken very tangy, but not too spicy.  Will keep the recipe and use it again.

I used Costco’s chickeb thighs, bone-in, skin-on.  It was so easy I was amazed at how delicious it was.  Both my husband and I are still raving over the yummy simplicity.

Easy peasy, to make. I found the chicken tender, not dry at all. One review did not think the paprika was a Sicilian herb, but perhaps they chose paprika because chili pepper flakes may be too hot for this dish. We  will make it again for sure.

I have been caring for my mother-in-law for over 8 years, and she has NEVER asked for a 2nd piece of chicken until now. My husband also asked if we could make it a staple. I had legs and thighs only, and my husband usually only likes breast meat, but he said he wouldn't make any changes. I used a heavy grilling pan and set my convection oven on "Roast" at 350 for 50 minutes. Perfection!

This is an excellent simple recipe.  I followed the recipe but it would be easy to change the flavors.  I baked the chicken at 375F for about 45 min and it was perfectly done and juicy. I put the spices on a plate and rolled the chicken in them.  I found it was necessary to use more than specified in the recipe.  This is a recipe where nothing really has to be measured.

This is my go-to baked chicken pieces recipe. I usually add some lemon pepper to the seasoning since I find it gets closer to the rotisserie flavor. I put smaller pieces like wings on one sheet, larger ones on the other so I can take the small ones out a little early. All the bones get tossed in a pot for soup the next day.

I made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts. Used Tuscan Herb infused olive oil instead of cooking spray. Was very flavorful. Will try again on fish.

Made this using a cut up fryer.  Tripled the amount of all spices, ex. used 3 tsp instead of one tsp.  of each.  We eat our food fairly spicy, so this worked well for us. I also used about half regular paprika and used about one half smoked paprika. 
 This was very good and has been requested to have again.

Other than using bone in, skin on chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken I made this recipe as written. It was easy to put together and had a lot of flavor. This recipe has definitely made it to my make again rotation. Thanks for sharing. I should add that the thighs were done at 50 minutes.

Excellent and tasty way to prepare boneless and skinless chicken breasts.   Didn't change a thing in the coating.  Pounded the breasts to an even thickness, coated them as directed, placed them on the air fryer rack and cooked them for 15 minutes at 400°.  Perfect!

I LOVE this recipe! I have a shaker full of the spice combination because I make this once a week. I always use thighs and last night I was in a hurry so instead of baking, I poured about 1 Tbsp of olive oil in a skillet, browned the chicken then put the lid on for another 20 minutes or so. The chicken was falling apart and just delicious! Next time I will deglaze and made a sauce with the yummy drippings. GREAT RECIPE!

This was really tasty! Unfortunately, my children were turned off by th3 color of the paprika and refused to eat it. I won't bother making it again, but it still gets 5 stars because my husband and I thought it was really good.

Good combination of spices. My only complaint is that the flavor is a little mild for me. If I make it again I'll let the spice rub sit and marinate for a day.

We only like dark meat around here, so I used chicken thighs. I followed  the instructions exactly. It takes only minutes to prepare and was very good - although slightly dry.

Used two chicken leg quarters with the skin on.  My hubby isn't a chicken lover, but really loved this and said to save the recipe.  It's easy and relatively quick.

Put the chicken in a big mixing bowl and added a bit of olive oil and lemon zest to the mix. 

It's a #keeper!

Super amazing with some olive oil drizzled halfway thru baking
Make some pasta which ever you love and a jar of some good sauce  which ever you love and serve with a green vegi or salad. And some garlic bread!
Yummy!!

Easy, quick, and simple! I’ve made this several times. If you use smaller chicken pieces, like boneless skinless thighs, shorten the cooking time to keep it moist. Once I had no oregano, so I used half basil and half thyme. Other herbs would probably work just as well. I will keep making this since I love the simplicity and good results.

Toss some potatoes with the same seasoning mix, and throw around the chicken. Makes a good thing even better.

Very good. I used smoked paprika so it was a little spicier. I used chicken tenders so cooking time was less. Everyone enjoyed it. I made the baked Hominy with this and the combination was great. I had fresh asparagus and I made a sauce from white wine, pepper, butter and garlic.

GREAT RECIPE!!  THANK YOU!!  :)
There is someone who tried to define  Paprika, but is not quite right, close though.  Paprika is a ground spice made from dried red fruits of the larger and sweeter varieties of the plant Capsicum annuum, called bell pepper or sweet pepper. The most common variety used for making paprika is tomato pepper.  But, you are right - some varieties now have a hot, smoked, sweet, etc.  This is not a staple in Sicilian cooking either.  Paprika is Hungarian and originally from Hungary.  I hope that helps to clear it up.  :-)

We call this Mom’s Chicken.  I use poultry seasoning, paprika, garlic salt, fresh ground pepper.  For an extra treat, flour the chicken parts first, sprinkle seasonings then top with a few pats of butter.

This sounds nothing like the girarrosto I had while stationed in Sicily. That chicken was made whole and had a lot of rosemary on it.

I’ve been making this for years, with a few additions. First, I use fresh garlic, put through a garlic press. Add some olive oil to the garlic to make a paste, and spread the mixture all over the chicken pieces. Then add the other herbs and spices. 

About 10 minutes before it’s done, I sprinkle grated Parmigiano Reggiano over the chicken.  Delicious!

I've been making this dish for a long time however, I never knew it had a name.
I double the seasonings plus onion powder
and use it like a rub.  I put about 1 tbs of olive oil in my hand  and rub it all over chicken thighs, about eight of them, then rub the spices on each piece and roast.  I like this dish best with just thighs, the dark meat seems to hold up better.

Dish was amazing. Used 4 leg quarters. Entire household absolutely loved it. Family says this recipe is a keeper. Using 4 leg quarters a couple of them ended up with a lil too much seasoning making it a bit too spicy. Next time I am going to use a combination of legs, thighs and breast making more than just 6 when having more people over. Will report back when making next time.

My mother made an Italian Chicken that was very close to this but MUCH better. Cut that paprika way down to a sprinkle.  Add a full tablespoon of crushed or chopped rosemary, fresh or dried. Now broil it but don't burn it, or roast it.

This is a delicious and easy recipe, just the way I like them. I also used the seasoning on some cut up potatoes and sweet potatoes with olive oil and baked them with the chicken. Dinner was complete.

I had thin sliced boneless skinless chicken breast laid out so that’s what I used instead of cut up chicken pieces. I made no alterations to the seasonings used. I greased baking dish with olive oil and put a couple cubes of butter in dish. Considering the chicken breast were thin sliced I lowered temp and cooking time. Turned out really good next time I will use the cut up chicken pieces so I can get the roasted skin from the chicken.

The flavors were really wonderful.  I didn’t use a whole chicken but just breasts and cooked them at 350 for 35 minutes.  Perfect.

I've used a whole chicken and boneless, skinless chicken breast (reduce baking time) with this recipe with great results.  It's simple, doesn't take much prep time and the family loves it.

We used chicken thighs and made mostly as directed. We didn't measure the spices and 'eyeballed' it. We baked at 425 for about 30 minutes and reduced the heat to 350 for the remainder. Very tasty!

I made this with chicken breasts instead and followed the rest of the recipe with the exception of add 1 tsp onion powder also. It was delicious! I only had it in the oven for about 25-30 min, 165°f. I will definitely make this again!

I enjoyed this and will make it again. I used rosemary and thyme in place of the paprika, due to personal taste, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It had a lovely crisp skin and tender, juicy meat, and was very easy to prepare. Even my 18 month old liked it!

I have made this recipe many times..although I don't care for oregano so I always use some dry (or fresh) rosemary as the taste is excellent with chicken.  additionally I rub the meat before cooking with evoo and garlic powder...makes the outer skin crispy

Excellent and easy this is a great weeknight recipe. I checked temperature after 45 minutes and it was way over 165 but it didn't hurt it a bit. Still very moist and tender.

This was a great, quick prep recipe. Perfect if you are making roasted veggies because they come out of the oven at the same time.  Or if you want frozen french fries, you pop them in  half the time.

Overall Easy and Delicious! The legs and thighs were moist, but the breasts were a little dry, so next time will cook for 50 minutes vs. 60.

I added onion powder as someone suggested and used more of the spices.   It is a great dish but as often happens the white meat gets dried out.  I would use only legs and thighs next time.   I really loved how easy it was to make.

Wonderful!  Really good flavors. I used a spatchcocked Cornish game hen which fit perfectly in my 10” cast iron skillet , and made some gravy from the fond in the pan.
My wife was impressed (really!).  Give this one a try.

We loved it, BUT I could find no purpose other than color for the Paprika, so I used a salt free Italian Seasoning instead. I served it with grilled Asparagus,  a tossed salad and crusty bread. I will make it again.

I didn't know what it was called, but I've been seasoning my chicken with that blend a long time. The only difference is that I use lemon pepper. I think it lends more flavor

This is just odd.  Why is this sicilian?  Why are we talking rotisserie at all in the description?   I just don't understand this.  Paprika?  Sicilian?  Where are the italian spices?  This is pretty silly.....

This sounds like it may be OK but I have to question the calorie count, unless they're counting 1/2 chicken per serving.

We made this using chicken breasts, and the family really enjoyed it. Think of it has a home-made version of the old "Shake and Bake"- but better.  It's one of those meals that you can get started and then just let cook  while you're doing something else. (Actually my 15-year-old daughter got this started for me.) Serve it with a few veggies and maybe some rolls and you have a nice dinner that's just a little different from our regular roasted/baked chicken.  I've put it on my meal-rotation list, and we'll have it again.

I mixed all of the spices with some flour before sprinkling it on the chicken.

Just used thighs and olive oil, baked for 45 minutes. Chicken was excellent and my wife made great gravy with the drippings.

This recipe is so good and easy.   I just used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  I also sprinkled a bit of rosemary on it.

It was great, had a good flavor to it and wasn’t bland like some of the other baked chicken recipes. I was trying to find something cheap and fast to cook with little effort and found this recipe in my email. Will most definitely make again. I used chicken thighs.
