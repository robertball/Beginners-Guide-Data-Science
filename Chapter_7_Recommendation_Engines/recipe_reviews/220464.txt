4.18.18  Had just enough of a boneless/skinless chicken breast in the fridge for lunch today.  Since I didn’t have any fennel, I Googled it, and found that bok choy is a good sub, so that’s what I used.  Just really enjoyed this very different version of chicken salad which is very delicate in flavor.  The garlic flavor certainly is there but does not dominate.  I did cut back on the mayo (would do so again) and served on spinach leaves (what I had on hand), although I think arugula would be even better.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
