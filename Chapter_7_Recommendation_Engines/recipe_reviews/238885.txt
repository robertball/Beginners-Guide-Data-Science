I’ve made these cookies multiple times and they’re always a big hit! I actually just use regular flour and sugar but I do use coconut oil. It makes a really decent sized batch, but you still might want to double it if you want to give them away or have them last you a while. Because they go quickly. They’re chewy and delicious!

These turned out to be very pleasant with a nice, almost cake-like texture. I had to add a dash of milk to make a cohesive dough plus I added 2 tbsp ground flaxseed. I didn't have wholemeal flour so I used regular white all-purpose. I will be making these again.

I give these a five for texture. Flavor. And appeal. Lovely cookies. I did make 2 changes to the original recipe. I used unbleached organic white flour instead of whole wheat flour. And organic cane sugar for palm sugar. I also chose to omit the cinnamon in the dough out of preference. Rolled the dough balls in the cinnamon sugar mix and baked for 8 minutes. These turned out as close to my grandma’s recipe as possible without the butter. These are going into our cookie rotation for sure. Thank you for the fine recipe.
