I needed a good sauce for some ribs we're cooking tonight.  I made a single batch and liked it enough to triple it for dinner tonight.  I did add 1 tsp lemon juice to add a little tang to a pretty sweet sauce.  I also recommend heating the sauce prior to eating to dissolve the sugar.  A yummy, sweet sauce with just a little heat.  Thanks!

This sauce is super! Super good & super easy. You can have fun using this as a base then adding other ingredients such as honey, lemon juice, fresh garlic, etc. I like to add pureed or finely chopped fresh jalapeno for a pleasant zing. Plus it's great to find another use for one of my favorite seasonings, Old Bay. Great recipe!

This sauce was an INCREDIBLE hit at dinner last night!  I brushed it on chicken while grilling, and both my boyfriend and my brother (who heard the rumor of free food and headed over) were licking their fingers-between the two of them they devoured 3 1/2 lbs of fryer chicken!  I doubled the recipe, added a little pepper and upped the old bay just a bit, then boiled the remaining sauce after bbq-ing and served as a dipping sauce... it was a hit!

My husband went on and on about how good this was.  He doesn't often do that.  Great, easy and flavorful recipe.

Very nice -I quadrupled the recipe, added 1tsp. of cider vinegar, a few twists of black pepper and used Deli mustard  (with horseradish)- my wife loved it. You can make many changes to this recipe without doing any damage -I like my sauces with a little more tang -easily done with this recipe

Nummy! I followed some of the other reviewers' leads and did a little tweaking with the 1 t. lemon juice and some pepper. I also threw in some Liquid Smoke and hot sauce. Used it on some round steak for BBQ Beef in the Crock-pot & once I shredded the beef, it sucked up all the sauce. Great for sandwiches!

Yummy and easy! When my husband likes a BBQ sauce better than his old favorite, it's a miracle. We may make this and give for gifts.

WOW!  This stuff is terrific.  Making it because I ran out of the bottled and was too lazy to run to the store to get more.  May not be buying bottled again, we will see how the family likes it.  Thanks!

Soooo, soooo good.  Very easy to prepare.  Very easy to convert to a larger size.  The first time I made a triple batch.  Today I am made a batch for 175 servings.  I used mason jars to can what I didn't use.  I am not a fan of Dijon mustard.  I simply left it out of my recipe.  It is still delicious!

We LOVED this....only problem is we didn't make enough of it. We used it on chicken and ribs and everyone loved it. I'll never buy bottled sauce again...this is too easy and so much better!

From a cook who can't, this is absolutely delicious and the easiest sauce I've ever made. Best of all- my better half can't get enough of it.

eh. this wasn't as good as i thought it would be. i only used 2 Tablespoons brown sugar and i still thought it turned out way too sweet. it's a good base to add more too, i would start with more ketchup or tomato sauce, less worcestershire sauce (too spicy for my tastes) and some lemon juice and garlic. too bad it turned out this way, because i love old bay seasoning. i'm sure it could still be showcased, just in a better sauce.
