Wayyy to much vinegar. Made it to put on burgers and had to add a second avocado to the existing ingredients and it still was way to strong

Thanks Karen for posting this! Very yummy! I might try  white vinegar instead of balsamic next time and maybe add a bit of lemon to make it a little more reminiscent of miracle whip. Although it was very delicious as is!

We (the kids and I) liked this! I had 2 avocados to use up, so I used both but kept all the other ingredients basically the same. Really nice flavor...we dipped pretzels in this, but I can't wait to try it with sweet potato fries as the submitter suggests b/c I think that would be great. Thanks for sharing. :)
