WONDERFUL!!  I don't know how this isn't in the top 20 recipes on the entire site.  I can't believe I liked it so well because I'm not fond of crescent rolls in desserts that well. I used a glass 9x13 pan and just put the rolls in and spread them out.  I spent just a few seconds to make sure the seams were together and the edges were not to thick. Then I poured the cream cheese mixture on top and spread it around.  Adding the second layer of rolls was a teeny tiny bit harder but not much. I felt like I didn't get the seams pressed together well enough but during the baking they spread together so it was fine.  Don't feel like you have to make it perfect because you are covering the top in the cinn/sugar mix. This is fabulous.  I made it exactly as called for except I only used about 1/2 as much honey as called for at first.  I tasted it and added more and yum.  Use the full amount.  I had to bake it longer than 30 minutes and I was getting worried.  It looked way too brown for comfort but the middle was still a tad gooey.  I kept it in though and it was in no way overdone.  So cook it until the center is done....you won't burn it.  Everyone who ate it wanted more and asked for the recipe.  Try it and I promise it will become a favorite.

I have been making this recipe for years, the only difference in the recipe I use is, it doesn't call for honey.  This recipe is soooo easy, delicious and inexpensive to make.  I make it for Charity bake sales and double to recipe to make several 8x8 pans that are ALWAYS the first to go at the sales.  A true "go to" recipe anytime you have a gathering or function.

Ok. This is, undoubtedly, the most outstanding-delicious-amazing-wonderful dessert recipe I have EVER tried. Unbelievable. If you don't rush right out and pick up the ingredients for this, you are missing out ON LIFE! I have tasted a lot of desserts, I have tried a million recipes, but I can honestly say (and my family will agree) that this is the most wonderful dessert ever. It was made by the Gods. You know how every recipe you read on Allrecipes.com has reviewers improving upon the recipe in some way? Well you won't see that with this recipe. Nope. It would be absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to improve on this one in ANY way. It's perfect. Sent from heaven. And in addition to the perfect flavor is the fact that it LOOKS beautiful, even if you throw the crescent rolls in sloppily (like I did). It's also so unbelievably easy to make that I am ASHAMED I didn't know about this sooner because it would have saved me a lot of sweat and stress while trying to throw something together for potlucks. All I can ask is that you not share the recipe with anyone. It's so good it should be a secret!

Made this for a potluck and what a hit! The top was crunchy and the center creamy & sweet. I didn't have Mexican vanilla so I yelled "ole" when I poured in my regular vanilla extract. I cut it into much smaller pieces though...little bites were a better choice!

This recipe is always a crowd pleaser.  In fact, my son requested that I make this for his 16th birthday last week, and his friends loved it. I use 3 packages of cream cheese and 1 1/2 cups sugar to make the filling a little thicker. And for the cinnamon sugar mixture I use 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tsp. cinnamon. Using Mexican vanilla is what sets this apart, so don't skimp on it! For our bunch, we did skip the honey because this dessert is fine without it. The refrigerated leftovers, if you have any, are awesome!

My husband took this to work for a "Mexican Day" lunch. They loved it- gone in no time at all. I took advise of others and added the 3rd cream cheese, reduced the topping sugar by 1/2, brushed on the butter, pre-baked the bottom crust for 7 minutes and increased total baking time to 45 minutes.

Four stars as written.  I found the directions to be somewhat incomplete and the filling not dense enough.  To fix this... cream cheese must be a room temperature and mixed using the paddle attachment on the mixer.  Don't use the beater attachment as this won't get the mix as creamy.  Add 1 egg to the cream cheese mixture after the sugar is totally blended.  The egg must be room temperature or it will cause the cream cheese mixture to separate.  
For the topping, blended the butter, cinnamon and sugar using the paddle attachment.  Spreads it as best you can.  While cooking, if the dough puffs up and the butter puddles, use a pastry brush to redistribute the butter and cinnamon.  Do this again after it comes out of the oven.  
Don't skip the honey.  Don't eat until the next day (flavors need time to set up and cheesecake should not be eaten right out of the oven).
For all you haters that don't like when people post the changes they made ... I disagree. Seeing how others have adjusted the recipe helps me decide how to tailor to my tastes.  I always rate based on recipe as written, but I like to share my changes in case anyone else finds them useful.

I got so many rave reviews for this one! The only thing I might do differently is a little less sugar in with the cream cheese. It was a bit too sweet for my taste. But other than that it was fabulous!

Fantastic recipe!  I've made this several times, always to rave reviews!  As recommended by other reviewers, I use 3 packages of Cream Cheese (adds a little more filling) and only 1/2 c. sugar in the topping.  And using regular vanilla extract seems to work fine.  Also, a quick tip for putting on the top layer of rolls.  If you lay them on top of the mixture, it can be difficult to stretch them to fit the pan.  To get around this, I put 1/2 can of rolls on a piece of wax paper, roll it out to 1/2 the size of the pan, flip it over on top of the cream cheese, and peel off the wax paper.  Repeat with the other half.  Makes for a good looking dessert with no hassle!

I just don't see what the big deal is about this recipe.. I was so excited to try this, and its average at best.  WAYYY to sweet, hurt your teeth sweet! tastes like pure sugar..  The cream cheese center needs to be firmer, adding an egg would really help.. The melted butter made PUDDLES on the top crust, that's just gross, so cut down the butter as well.

So very, very fabulous!  And easy too!  I made this for a church dinner and came home with an empty pan and many requests for the recipe.  I only used a half cup of sugar with about a teaspoon of cinnamon for the topping, which was plenty, and I melted the butter and brushed it over the top of the dough before sprinkling on the topping.  I also served it refrigerated, because I like cheesecake cold.  YUM!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit with all. I thought the topping was a little to sweet so next time I make it, I will use 1/2 cup sugar instead of the 3/4 cup. So great for so little time and it was great warm or cold. My hubsand likes it warmed up in the microwave for about 20 sec. Thanks CandelB for a new fav at our house.

We have enjoyed this recipe for years (without the honey), but there is something else you might want to try.  Use fruit preserves, or cook down some chopped, fresh fruit with sugar and corn starch.  Spread this on top of the cream cheese layer, before you put on the last crescent roll layer. To die for!

OMG!!! My husband said he could literally eat this until he got sick! It is so good. I also didn't use quite as much sugar/cinnamon as called for, and I used just regular old vanilla extract. This is my new favorite dessert recipe.

VERY good (but REALLY sweet)!!! My sister has raved for years about a similar dessert she makes from this site although I am not sure it's this exact one. I hosted my parents for dinner last night. Our meal was Mexican-themed. This dessert was an AWESOME finale! I was contemplating another sopapilla cheesecake recipe, but the addition of honey in this one intrigued me. Let me say, the honey is the BEST part! It's what makes CandelB's recipe stand out from all the others, IMHO. Although many have heralded this to be perfect as is, I disagree. I have 2 (VERY minor) complaints: a) this is a tad too sweet for my liking and b) it calls for too much butter. As Mis7up suggested, I think reducing the butter to 1/3 c. would do the trick. I was afraid my dessert was ruined b/c excess butter "pooled" in the center of my baking dish. I gently spooned it off and all was fine (NOTE: it will solidify as it cools). :) I really wanted to try Pillsbury's crescent creation rolls (i.e. no seam), but my grocer didn't have them. It didn't matter tho... I just pinched the seams together by hand and all was fine. Oh, and reduced-fat ingredients are perfectly acceptable here. I even used reduced-fat crescents with excellent results! One more note: If you can find Mexican vanilla, USE IT! It has a richer, earthier flavor than the Tahitian or Madagascar varities. With a few mods to suit my personal tastes, this will become a favorite for sure. Thanks for sharing, CandelB! :-)

I agree with most everyone that this is a really great recipe.  Here is my experience when I followed the recipe almost exactly:  The only thing I did differently was reduce the amount of honey drizzled on top.  After just about two tablespoons of honey, the pie seemed to be drowning in the stuff so I stopped.   I found rolling the cresent roles to be a disaster also.  Much easier to put in the pan and press.  When I removed the cheesecake from the oven (needed 5 to 10 minutes longer than indicated) it looked like a gooey mess.  There were several small pools of honey/butter in various dips and crevices.  I used a spoon to remove most of the puddling.  At this point, it wasn't looking too good.   It seemed to take forever to cool.  My husband and I cut and tasted it when it was about room temperature.  Extemely sweet and a really sticky mess.  Agree with the person who said it tasted like a very sweet cheese danish.  We were not terribly impressed.  I transfered the cut pieces to a flat, covered container and put in the frig.   The next day, we each took a piece straight from the frig.  OMG, it was just wonderful.  No longer a gooey mess, nice and firm and all the flavors blended.  A real cheesecake taste.   So, don't get frustrated or become disappointed if you remove this from the oven and it doesn't live up to the hype.  It really does get better with refrigeration.   The next time I make it, just for fun I will use less sugar and extra thick crescent roles.  A keeper.

This is AWSOME!
I made this for a New Year's Eve Party and it was a huge hit. Every one who ate it commented how good it was and many asked for the recipe. One woman asked if she could adopt me :) The hardest part was rolling out the dough. I made 2 changes, not because it really needed it but because I wanted a thicker filling. I used 3 blocks of cream cheese and 3 tsp of regular pure vanilla (didn't have Mexican). I left the sugars at the stated amount. It was delicious. The honey is a must. I think it really heightened the flavor. Do not skip the honey. I cooked the bottom dough for 5 mins before adding the filling and I softened the butter for the top so the consistency was smooth enough to spread over the top layer. This helped create a nice streudle like crust instead of pooling in puddles. I baked it about 35 mins. Thanks for such a yummy recipe.

Absolute delicious! I roll the crescent roll to the pan to a perfect fit. I add 1/2 cup ground pecans and 1/2 cup sugar one cup of sugar  is too much I also used low fat cream of cheese and vanilla beat all that. And the top I spread 4 tablesp. of melted butter and 4 tablespoon of apple sauce 1/2 cup ground pecan, then sprinkle 1/2 cup sugar with one tablespoon of cinnamon and that turned to be a beautiful color and very tasted flavor I have done these about 40 time for friends, family and just about every week loved it! You also can do it with fat free cream cheese I also used low fat crescent rolls, these does not need that honey on the top and that much sugar that it call for. Next time I will try fresh peaches on the top.

As always when using crescent rolls as a base, I baked the bottom layer for 5 minutes in the pre heated oven first to avoid undercooking later. This also makes it easier to spread the cream cheese mixture. Personal taste, I cut down on the sugar in the mixture and also the topping can easily be cut in half. And let cool completely before you try to cut it. Easy, fast, cheap and delish!  What more could you ask for?

Well, after reading through the recipe, a few of the "Least Positive" reviews, and actually trying out the recipe, I've come to the conclusion that a few factors should be changed:
- Add an egg to the cream cheese mix, it'll make the filling a lot thicker and more cheesecake-like.
- Cut the amount of sugar in the filling by half, otherwise it tastes like a mouthful of cream cheese frosting.
- Instead of crumbling butter on top, which results in gross puddles of fat, try brushing melted butter on top of the dough, then sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. You should be using 3-4 TBSP of butter at most, not half a cup. Croissant dough is very flaky and buttery as is, any more and you'll be swimming in saturated fat.
- Nix the honey if you don't have that big of a sweet tooth. It'll definitely help; honey is overly sweet on it's own.
- Lastly, refrigerate before cutting, otherwise the cream cheese won't set and cut well.

Thus is delicious.  I just have a question.  Do you store it in the refrigerator?  Or, can it be left out on the counter?

Wife made this as written except used Tahitian vanilla extract. This is one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had! I will make this repeatedly for the rest of my life. I know it's probably terrible for me, but thanks for an awesome easy recipe!

I would rate this more stars if I could! Just finished having a piece of this and it is to die for. Kind of turned out like a cross between bread pudding and cheesecake. Absolutely delicious and a keeper. I did make a couple of changes. Per other reviews, I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and 1/4 cup for the topping. I used Splenda for white sugar and SF brown sugar for the topping. I figured it out and it has about 6 grams of sugar for the whole pan of it. Perfect for a severe diabetic like my Dad. He can have a good piece and not have to count the grams. I did melt the butter and mixed brown sugar and cinnamon in it then brushed on. I cut the butter down but was still way too much. I think a couple of tblsp would be enough. It came out nicely browned, a bit crispy, and so good with whipped cream on top. Thank you for a new SF dessert I can make for my Dad.

I quadrupled this and served as dessert to a Mexican dinner at my church. It was rated "excellent" by the group with requests for the recipe. I added eggs to mine (one per recipe), and I liked the texture. I also used Mexican vanilla. I had a bite before it had cooled as well as a little piece after it had sat for 4 hours, and I much preferred the cooler version. I drizzled honey all over after it came out of the oven, and I think it adds that necessary flavor for sopapillas. :) I see that the previous reviewer mentions the availability of sheets, and I will certainly look for those next time, as it was a little tricky getting the dough to cooperate.

Super easy. Awesome, and AMAZING cold!! I used regular vanilla (real) and since I had a ton of cream cheese I combined it with another version of the same recipe and used 3 bricks of cream cheese and 1 1/2 cups of sugar for the filling. I used only 1/2 cup sugar for the topping (plenty) and just melted and poured the butter on top and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar over it instead of softening and mixing it all. I baked 45 minutes but could have cut it by 5 minutes- the top edge of crescent roll browned a bit more than I'd have liked but as it cooled it softened up and was fine.

These are awesome!  Great for breakfast, too...with a cup of coffee.  A hint for rolling out the top:  roll/press it out onto waxed paper.  Flip it over onto the cream cheese mixture and peel the waxed paper off.

I made this for the first time last night for a school potluck. I got so many rave reviews. I made two batches and left some home with my family. They texted me to let me know it was delicious!!  Thank you!! Will definitely make it again. One of my girlfriends requested I make this for her son's birthday party.  :)

This was really good!  I baked the first crescent roll layer (I used the sheets) for about 6 minutes before layering.  I used 3/4 cup sugar in the filling, 1/4 cup butter, and 1/2 cup sugar in the topping.  I got the butter soft in the microwave and spread it on top of the top layer, then put the sugar and the cinnamon on top.  The butter did not pool like others stated.  I baked it for 30 more minutes but probably could have subtracted a couple minutes.

Sopapilla Cheesecake Pie.  Is it a sopapilla?  Is it cheesecake?  Is it pie?  Let me tell ya, it's more like CRACK.  I made this for a family gathering and it was a HUGE hit.  I couldn't find my 9x13 dish, so I used an 11x15 jellyroll pan and it worked just fine and made for more slices of cheesey honey goodness.  The few pieces that were left were quickly scarfed up by relatives to take back to their homes.  I'll be making this one for years to come.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

AMAZING.  I made this for a dinner party of six and we ate the entire thing and felt really sick afterwards.  A great dessert to have if you have any self-control.  Clearly, I do not.

This was amazing!!! Sooo easy to make and tasted so good. House smelled wonderful while baking. Per recommendations, I reduced the amount of butter to 1/4c and baked for an additional 15 minutes. Came out perfect & everyone loved it! Made 2 batches for a mexican fiesta party & got wonderful compliments! Thanks!

Made this great recipe for my son's going off to College for his fellows program. I added 8 more ounces of cream cheese, grated lemon and on my top crust I cut out the butter out all together but used spray butter. I used cinnamon, and sugar but cut the sugar on top to 1/4 cup using half white sugar and half sugar in the raw for a crunchy consistency. Because the filling has a lot of sugar, I didn't want to have the topping be so sweet. It was so wonderful... Thanks for the recipe....

WOW- talk about the best smell coming out of the oven! WOW! Used 1/2 cup sugar in cheese mixture- didn't roll out the crust just pressed the seams together- top and bottom. sprinked sugar on top to cover dough and topped with cinnamon and about 2 TBS of butter just dropped on randomly in little dollops. Was plenty sweet even with less sugar. The girls at BUNCO like it a lot.   THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

In the end, these rich little cheesecake bars turned out to be one of the best things I have ever eaten.  But when the pan was in the oven, the butter ended up pooling horribly, and I found myself scooping it out with a spoon.  I feel that the butter could be cut down considerably, possibly to only using 1/4 cup.  This also took about 15 minutes longer to cook, and I was still worried that the middle was on the gooey side, while the edges were very brown.  I will for sure be trying these again with less butter, as they were a huge hit at our mexican dinner party!

Amazingly easy and delicious!! We made this for our dinner club and it was a HUGE hit. We made a few changes though. Instead of using the Pillsbury crescent roll pastry, we used butter puff pastry (can be found in the frozen food section of most groceries) and instead of drizzling honey, we used a store-bought butterscotch caramel sauce (can be found with the ice cream toppings section in grocery store). Anyway, even if you didn't make these changes, it is still very, very good and really easy to make!!! Absolutely love it and it will be a favourite of mine for years to come!!

i LOVE deserts of all kinds but this was SO sweet it was crazy! i followed the recipe to the letter and was very disappointed. WAY too much sugar inside and on top (i did reduce the sugar on top by 1/4 n it was still too sweet!) 
IF this recipe can be salvaged i would half ALL the sugars (at least), half the butter and nix the honey altogether. Perhaps my oven is a bit hotter? cause the edges browned at 20 mins but the middle was gooey. i covered with foil for an additional 20 mins but because of the POOL of BUTTER on top, the top remained gooey throughout. :( such a disappoinment

Oh my goodness.. this was so much better than I thought it would be!! The only thing I did differently was that I used generic, regular vanilla extract. (Poor college students can't exactly spend a lot of $$ on things like vanilla extract!) I was a little worried when I took it out and the cinn/sugar butter was sort of just floating on top. But after giving it the proper time to cool it turned out beautifully! Took this to work during the week of Christmas and several people requested the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this last minute for our family Christmas party and it was a big hit!! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. The only thing I changed was I didn't use all of the honey it called for. Just a bit less. Thank you, I will definitely be making this again.

I have made this recipe many times.  It is one of my son's favorite foods!  I make some minor changes-  reduced fat cresent rolls and reduced fat cream cheese.  They work fine.  Rather than mixing the butter with the cinnamon and sugar to dot on top before baking, I find it easier to spread the cinnamon sugar on top of the cheesecake, then melt the butter and drizzle it on top.

Ok this is def a go to recipe. Rarely do the butter on top.  Use this for a cheese Danish recipe. Use it for quick dessert and it uses ingredients that I almost always have on hand.  Yummy wam or cold. Family prefers cold.

This was great and easy to make. I made this with 1/3 less fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls.  i also put only 3/4 cup sugar in the cream cheese mixture and 1/4 on top with 1/4 cup of smart balance instead of sugar.  I baked it about 10 minutes longer and used a pastry brush to spread out the melted butter mixture. I also drizzled the honey on top and brusshed it evenly.  So good. I served it at a picnic this weekend. It was a hit with everyone.

This was quite tasty and easy to make.  My boyfriend said it was "the best dessert ever in the history of the universe".  I think he was exaggerating a bit, but I did really like it.  It was a little too sweet for me, and I even reduced the sugar in the topping.  I think less sugar in the filling next time so you can taste more of the cream cheese.  I did add the honey to the top which added a nice flavor. I will definitely make this again.

This is a hit every time I make it, and now am making it by request for Christmas day! I've modified it a little over time:
- less sugar, I only used 2/3 cup
- use really good real vanilla extract...the better vanilla makes a tastier filling
- pre-bake the bottom for 8 minutes...helps it from getting soggy. This means you have to have the rest ready to fly and finish quickly and back in the oven.
- lemon zest in the cheesecake filling! It's adds depth and takes the heat off the sweet
- I use half the butter, soften it, spread it evenly on the top --- then I sprinkle half-cinnamon and half-sugar on top...again...cut the sugar so it's more cinnamony than sugary
- no honey

Let it refrigerate overnight --- something magical happens :)

This was a disappointment based on all the reviews. Was WAY to sugary. My family all thought it would be better without the cream cheese. Will not be making this again.

I have made this twice because the recipe sounds so delicious.  I didn't like it either time and neither did my husband.  And we are not picky eaters.  I love cream cheese, crescent rolls, and cinnamon, but for some reason combined this way, it just didn't taste good.  Maybe my expectations were too high but I will not be making it again.

This was absolutely divine!  I made it as is, then drizzled a little melted butter on top before I sprinkled it with the cinnamon sugar.  I also drizzled honey on top when I took it out of the oven.  Super rich, but we finished the whole pan after Easter dinner!  I will make this again & again & again!

A friend of mine brought this to a party and it was amazing!  Not a person at the party didn't like it - grown ups and kids.  My 8 year odl son liked it so much I found him on the computer the next day trying to Google Mexican desserts so he could find it!  Good thing I already knew where I could. :)

Very good.  Not really a cheesecake, but very easy to make.  Close enough to the real sopapilla's from authenic mexican restaurant's.  Defiantly use the honey after placing on a plate.  I 'painted' the butter on top then used crystalized brown sugar and cinnamon sprinkled over that.  DO NOT over bake (easy to do).

This was a big hit.  Sent some home with my son and a few days later he asked if I would make more because his roommate at it all.  This is going to remain a family favorite and is quite easy to prepare.

This recipe is absolutely amazing.  I have a slightly different version, where the bottom crust is baked 6 min and then the entire thing bakes for 20-25 min.  Either way, this is ridiculously good.  I've made it four times, and only once has it made it out of the house.  I agree with the reviewer who says you will eat it until you get sick; and then you'll eat the rest.  There are not enough synonyms for good to describe how this thing tastes.  And now they make crescent roll sheets, so you don't even have to squish the seams together!

This dessert is so easy and so good!  It makes alot of cheesecake though so next time I may cut the recipe in half for the four of us.  I didn't have any Mexican vanilla extract so I used regular pure vanilla extract instead and it worked beautifully.  Prior to baking, I melted the 1/2 cup of butter and brushed it over the dough.  Then sprinkled the sugar/cinnamon mixture (1/2c. sugar, 1 tsp ground cinnamon) over the top.  Served this chilled and my husband and I both went back for seconds!

This is fantastic, even if you're not a huge fan of cheesecake. It's a delicate dessert with great flavor. Don't try to cut calories and just sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on without the butter, though. You end up with a gritty mess.

Don't change a thing!! It's delicious. I didn't see any need to pre-bake the first crust, or to add this or that. It's amazing the way it is. I did stress about the crescent roll dough on my first attempt - it kept falling apart when it was in little pieces, I couldn't imagine trying to roll it all together and then place it in the pan! I ended up peicing it together while in the pan for the top and bottom layers. Get it together the best you can, but don't stress. The topping ends up covering it and it actually turned out looking quite nice. Thanks for sharing!

I am considered the cheesecake lady at our church because I am always making them for our dinners & such. I saw this recipe when I looked up Hispanic desserts for our once a month ladies meeting, where we were having Mexican food this month. It was a super hit! Another plus was the fact that it is so much easier to make than regular cheesecakes. What a treat and I am totally sold on this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to use 1 cup of sugar and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon with the butter for the topping. I also kinda spread it on instead of dotting it. Anyway, it is fabulous.

This is a great easy dessert... however, the instructions are not very clear when it comes to the crescent rolls.  I believe it is supposed to have one whole container of crescents on the bottom of the pan, and then the other whole container on the top.

But it IS wonderful!

Great recipe! I made these for my "in-laws" X-mas party and they loved it! I was in a hurry, eyeballed most of the measurements and threw it in the oven. SUPER EASY!!! But be aware, its more like a cheese danish and less like cheesecake.

Oh my goodness this is so amazing.  Had to bake it a little longer than 30 minutes.  Didn't add the honey until it was cut and on the plates (I don't care for honey)  Where has this been all my life.  Super super easy!  I used the crescent roll sheets and they fit a 9x13 pan perfectly, didn't really have to roll or spread them out.  Used a glass pan and sprayed with Pam before hand.

This is so good! Didn't change a thing. Other reviewers noted that it took longer to cook. I took mine out when the topping was browned to the point I wanted, even though the middle was still jiggly. Didn't matter, was perfect at approx. 40 min cooking time.

I have made this twice in the last week, because my husband loves it (he requested it instead of a cake for his birthday!). I only used 2/3 cup sugar in the cheesecake filling both times and only used 1/4 cup melted butter (brushed on top) and then sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on. I also made one with Splenda instead of sugar (1/2 cup, as it tends to be much sweeter than real sugar) and it was VERY hard to tell a difference between the two. The diabetics in the family were very happy! (I still did top with real sugar, as Splenda doesn't really have a sprinkle-worthy texture.) Both versions have baked up perfectly in 30 minutes. Also, you have to try cherry pie filling and a dallop of whipped cream on top -- yum, yum, yum!!!

This is very good! The best thing about it is that it's recession friendly. I had almost all the ingredients on hand and it was very cheap to make. It's also super easy. I didn't even need a rolling pin; I just pinched the crescent roll dough together and laid it in the pan, flattening it with my palms. I love how the butter/cinnamon topping makes it crunchy and crispy on top. It should not only be left to cool, but should *chill* in the refrigerator before serving. It is MUCH better tasting when cold, tastes a lot more like cheesecake. A great cheap and easy recipe, not gourmet obviously, but I imagine it would be a real crowd pleaser.

Awesome !!  I used regular vanilla, and it still turned out great.  Even easier now that they are making crescent rolls in sheets for baking.

This was probably the easiest dessert I have ever made, AND it was delicious. My mom who has a tiny appetite ate two whole pieces at one sitting. Believe me, that's saying something. You would never know it was made with crescent rolls. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made cookies out of these.  I halfed the trianges, rolled them into balls and flattened them out.  Then added a dollop of the cream cheese mixture, spread it out and then a generous ball of the sugar/cinnamon/butter.  Baked for about 15+ minutes.  They turned out great!  I made these for a teacher appreciation luncheon and thought they were more presentable in cookie form.  Thank you!!

Super easy and very good.  I cut the butter on the topping buy almost half and it was still very buttery.  I also omitted the honey as I made these for a party and not everyone likes honey.  This was the first dish to disappear!

Delicious!  I never, ever leave reviews because I always forget to come back after the recipe after I've made it.  I couldn't forget this time because it's wonderful!  It was really easy to make and the taste is great.  The flavor is such that you expect it be harder to make.  I used regular vanilla extract and followed the suggestion that I kept it in long enough to cook the center.

I've used a recipe similar to this for a long time, but I melt the butter, pour it on top, then sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mix on top. It's fabulous by itself, but I've also tried putting 1 can of peach pie filling (dice the peaches up in a small dice) on the cream cheese mix before putting the top crescent rolls on top. It turned out wonderful!! I think just about any pie filling would work. Blueberry would be great or apple! It has become a family favorite. So easy!

Same as bev below my comment.I too was making for a cinco de mayo theme dinner at our camp.And I came across this recipe in my box.I have been wanting to make this for a long time but never did.Wow you dont know what your missing... I made this exactly as written.I cut it into small bite size pieces ,and people were wishing I had made 2 pans.. So the very next day was my 1 yr anniv.So I asked hubby what he wanted me to bake.And he hands down wanted this again.So I made it again on sun.Shared with camp,and they were thrilled and they even got to have more that a bite size piece lol Only thing I did different was to melt butter for the topping and stir sug and cinn in and spread evenly on top  . This would be great with some grilled apples and or baked apples.Easy enough to do while at camp .

This is one recipe you really must try! Excellent ending for any Mexican themed dinner or anytime. If you use the Pillsbury Crescent Sheets it goes together really fast. I found if I melted a couple tablespoons of butter in the microwave and used a pastry brush, I could brush a thin layer of butter on the top crust. I mixed 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon with about 2-3 tablespoons of sugar and lightly sprinkled it all over the top. I drizzled a couple of tablespoons of honey on the top and it was just perfect. Thanks again CandleB and allrecipes!

WOW! Absolutely Delicious!  First, I found Mexican vanilla at a local Mexican Grocery store, not expensive at all where I live.  Second, I read many comments that said NOT to use the Honey....DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM! ha...and if they are right, I can't imagine how good this is without the honey.  Third, many comments regarding the crust/butter pool...I also noticed this happening, however, once it cooled somewhat, the butter seemed to be absorbed and the crust was fine; both top & bottom.  And finally, I have to agree with at least one other reviewer who said there was no way they could wait for it to cool completely....we did not wait either.  Yum...breakfast never tasted so good!
I followed this recipe exactly.

These were very easy to make and delicious.  My one criticism is that we thought it was a tad too sweet.  We're already planning to make this for Christmas and we're going to cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup for the cream cheese filling rather than use the full cup.  After reading another review, I decided to just lay the dough in the bottom of the pan and pinch the seams together and spread it out with my fingers to cover the pan.  It proved MUCH easier than rolling the dough (granted, I don't have a rolling pin so I had to go with a bottle of wine! lol).  These were definitely a hit and with a small adjustment for next time, I think they'll be even better!

I never ever review recipes. But I HAD to leave a review for this one. It's so easy, relatively cheap, serves a lot and best of all it is so delicious! I used 3 packages of cream cheese and that was the only change I made. Yum! The honey drizzled on top is a must in my opinion.

Yummy!!  I made this for my son's Spanish class party.  I've made similar desserts before but without the honey...it made a very nice addiction!  I spread the butter/sugar/cinnamon all over the top (rather than dotting it) and it made a very nice "crust" layer.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!!!! Very easy to make and I didn't change a thing to the ingredients.  I did bake the base crust for 5 min before adding the cream cheese and sugar to make sure the center was cooked.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  I took it to a Christmas party and did not bring any home.  This is a MUST TRY recipe.

I've made this recipe many times, but never thought of honey. Wow! Awesome flavor! Just a little fyi, I found Pillsbury crescent sheets today; didn't know about them. Saves you from having to worry about seams and such. I did have to bake a little longer than 30 minutes. Great recipe!

For me, it seemed like way too much butter for the top. The butter pooled in the center once in the oven, which left the center soggy, so I added 7 minutes to the cooking time. In doing so the edges became darker and crispier which was not a desirable result. When I took it to a card party, people avoided those darker pieces, however the overall taste was excellent!! I should have put tin foil on the top when I added the extra time. In the future I will melt the butter first and then brush it on using a pastry brush and cut the butter down to 3/4 stick. Also, I used seamless crescent rolls - makes the process easy!

Made this for a dinner party, served cold.  Found it just OK.  I would give it 3 stars, but everyone else raved and had 3 or 4 servings.  I'm not a huge fan of sweets, and this is pure sugar, but those with sweet tooths loved it.  I did put almonds on top after it had been in the oven for about 10 minutes, and to me the bites with almond were fantastic- I think the nuttiness really evened out the sweet.  In the future I'm covering the top with almonds.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly, except used regular vanilla since I didn't have Mexican vanilla.

I've been making this for every major holiday gathering for several years now.  My family and friends demand and even expect it now!  I got the recipe from a friend and it's almost identical to this one only the one I have does not call for honey.  Also, I do the butter/cinnamon/sugar topping a little different as well (I melt the 1/2 c. butter, pour it on top and sprinkle a 1/4 c. cinnamon/sugar mixture on it -I usually eyeball the sugar/cinnamon ratio).  You'd get the same results though.  This is THE most amazing cream cheese dessert I've ever had.  Tasty cold or slightly warmed.  One tip for better serving:  Let it cool and refrigerate if possible.  It really needs to set up to be cut into neat bars.  Enjoy this one!!!

These are amazing!! I got a ton of compliments on them and they were all gone quick.  Each time I make it, I melt the butter with the cinnamon and sugard and spread that on top, rather than dotting with just softened butter -- it works better for me and gets the mixture even all over. Also, the second time i made these I added a handful of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to the cheesecake mixture and it gave an added little chocolate flavor.

I followed the recipe as is and it turned out fabulous!! Very very rich, you only need a little square. Makes a lot of food, we didn't finish it before it got soggy, what a shame.

I had to join everyone else on this dish.  Absolutely the easiest and best ever!!!   I did cut back on the butter by 1/2 and was still absolutely perfect. Thanks for sharing.

This is so very yummy!  Let them cool after baking and it will get crunchy on top and the filling will set up.  Very good!  I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8X8 pan and it turned out well.  We also tried a second time with canned peaches between the layers but it turned out soggy on the bottom. We may try fresh fruit next time.

WOW! Made it as stated, and it was perfect!  It is definitely sweet but that is obvious from the ingredients. SOOO, don't make it as stated and then lower the rating because it's too sweet for you! Get a clue and use less sugar or choose something other than dessert to make! :)

A big hit! Certainly not a diet food and a little too sugary for my taste so might cut down on that next time like some people have noted but otherwise a very tasty treat that everyone loved. I found it best to just add the honey as needed when serving since some people liked it without.

This recipe is amazing, it would be pretty hard to mess up. I made it for a mexican themed dinner party and one of my guests asked if I would be offended if he licked his place. I will be making this again!!

This is the easiest, best recipe ever! The only reason I'm not going to give this 5 stars is because this isn't the best dessert I've ever had. But it is amazing and I could eat it until I got sick. I have 3 kids and don't always have time to make a real cheesecake, or the patience. But the first time I made this, my kids and husband couldn't get enough. Then I made this while on a beach vacation with my family, my 2 sisters, their husbands and all of their kids. They said it was the best thing ever! They've been begging me to make it again. I like using candied pecans chopped up in it. Also good with cherries and ice cream on top. I'm fixing to attempt a pumpkin version.

Pretty funny when you hear a loud "OMG" from someone who just had one of these and being called the Devil because you made them.  Lol!  Seriously, this is a fabulous recipe and sure to please a small group or a crowd.  This recipe does NOT need changes.  It is awesome as is.  Thanks for sharing it CandelB

Very good and easy to make; however, I left the honey off as I don't care much for honey.  Other than this, I thought it was delicious.

Very, very delicious!  The first time I made this, I thought it was just ok.  One night we hung out with the neighbors and brought it over so they could try it.  They absolutely loved it and were asking for the recipe.  A few weeks later I was sort of craving it, so I made it and almost finished the whole thing myself!  So much for my first rating, this stuff was really great!!  I've made it 10 times within 2 months.  It's a keeper.

I followed this recipe to a T, and wasn't impressed with the way it turned out. When I removed it from the oven, the cake was covered in puddles of butter and sugar! I let it dry completely, hoping it would solidify a little bit, and then cut it into pieces. When I finally tried it, it was wayyyy to sweet! Like sickly sweet! I couldn't eat a whole piece. I don't think I'll be trying this recipe again.

Great recipe! Brought it to a potluck my Ultimate Frisbee team planned, and it was finished by the end of the day. I even got asked for the recipe by one of the members, and another asked me to make it again for their birthday.

It really is simple, by only problem being that it was a little expensive (all-in-all, I spent around $9 on the crescent rolls and cream cheese), and it was too sweet.

If anybody is making this recipe, I would definitely recommend putting in MUCH less sugar. The first time I made the recipe, I heeded the people in the comments' warnings, and put in around 25% less sugar and butter into the recipe. This was still much too sweet in my opinion. Although my team members quite liked it, when I made it again for the birthday party, I put in about half of the sugar in the cream cheese mix and around a quarter of the combined topping (sugar+cinnamon+butter). In my opinion, it tastes much better that way! Also note that instead of dotting the butter on top of the dough, I melted it in the microwave and brushed it on until the top was coated. Do not over-do this!!! The crust will become soft and mushy even after baking instead of crispy like you want it to.

Overall it was a very good dish and I can definitely see myself making it a third time with the adjustments I mentioned above.

I made 2 of these because I work in a large office. Since this was the first time I made this, I did what I usually do when trying a new recipe: I made the 1st one exactly as written and the 2nd one using reviewers recommendations, such as leave in oven longer. The original recipe is perfect. You will find that after 30 minutes of baking, the center will appear to be unset, however, it will continue to set as it cools. The second was still delicious but definitely overcooked. My co-workers devoured all of it.

Delicious and very easy to prepare. A bit too sweet for me but my husband and sons loved it. We halved it, next time we'll make the full thing as it was gone in no time (I'll just lower the amount of sugar slightly.) Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This is just delicious and easy to make. As written, I found it to be WAY too rich in butter and sugar. I hate when people re-make a recipe completely and then rate it poorly so I don't want to do that here! However, just wanted to share that I made it again and used reduced fat crescent rolls, reduced fat cream cheese and cut the sugar and butter in half. Also skipped the honey. It was perfect and enjoyed by all so much. I didn't get that "I ate too much" feeling after eating a piece!

This has become the dessert that people are starting to know me for... I make it that often and everyone LOVES it! Even made it for my 30th bday as the cake. I don't change anything about the recipe and it turns out perfect. Only tip I have is to skip balling up the dough and rolling out again. I just place the crescent triangles in pan and press the edges together with my fingers, merging them together. Set that layer aside to place on top of cream cheese mixture and do it again with the other dough to keep as the bottom layer.

This recipe is great! I usually don't do the honey drizzle, and it is just as delicious without the extra sugar. I recently tried a fruity twist that was a hit - add lemon zest, lemon juice, cinnamon and sugar to the creamcheese mixture, and top the creamcheese with fresh blueberries before laying down the top crust. Yum!

ADDING ADDITIONAL TIPS DEC 2014- My changes are: A. I add a beaten egg to the first step when you're blending the cream cheese/1 cu sugar/ 1 t. of Mexican vanilla. It makes a HUGE difference in the end product! B. after you have the top layer of Crescent dough placed on I decrease the sugar for the topping. I use 1/2 cu of sugar mixed with 1 t. of cinnamon. I do NOT cut the softened butter in to the sugar mixture as recommended. I melt 6 T. of butter (not the whole cube as the recipe calls for) and drizzled it all over the topping. I bake it @ 350° for 45 minutes. PERFECTION EVERY TIME!- ORIGINAL RATING ? I've already rated this recipe once with 5 stars, but would like to add one thing.  If you're not serving it right away keep it refrigerated until you're just about ready to serve it.  I pulled it out early and then the party was delayed by a few hours.  It got a bit soggy for my liking...BUT...it was still completlely inhaled .

This is one of the top recipes when my daughter's fellow teachers have a teacher pot-luck.  I cut back on the sugar a bit and add some finely grated lemon, lime or orange zest.  Never tried the honey drizzle, but I will!

It's much easier to use the Crescent sheets since you don't have to worry about sealing the perforations.  I also use 3 packages of cream cheese and add a little almond extract along with the vanilla and then I sprinkle sliced almonds on the top.  You really don't have to go to the bother of mixing the butter, sugar and cinnamon for the top.  Just melt the butter and brush it over the top layer of dough and sprinkle with the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Try the almonds on top, it really adds a nice crunch.  I've never used the honey as my original recipe didn't call for it and it's delicious without it.

I had to "suffer" through this one.  But oh lordy.  I would have eaten the whole pan to spare everyone else in the house from how "horrible" this was!  Even as I was eating it and telling them that it tasted gross and they'd hate it.  *G*  Fortunately they didn't believe me!  Saved me from myself!  *G*  I did insist on Dee sharing the recipe.  Boy will I have fun sharing this one with others.  Easy to make and eat!  YUMMY...oh sorry- gross.  You'll make yourself sick eating it!  *G*

This recipe is as good as everyone says!  I was looking for something to make for a Cinco de Mayo-themed camping potluck dinner, and chose this based on all of the great reviews.  It couldn't be any easier than this.  Before we left for the weekend, I mixed up the cream cheese/sugar/vanilla filling.  I kept it in the camper refrigerator for 2 days before I was ready to assemble the dessert.  When it was time to make it, all I needed to do was layer the filling over the crescent rolls, add the second layer of rolls, and bake!  I made one change, and that was to cut back just a bit on the butter and sugar topping.  I used 5 T butter, melted, then mixed in the cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar.  I just brushed this over the top before baking.  People in neighboring campsites were stopping by to ask what I was making that smelled so good.  It was a huge hit, and the entire pan was eaten that evening!  Don't forget to add the honey after baking....that really finishes it.  Delicious!!

Made this last night for a Mexican themed potluck.
It was easy to make and tastes fantastic!
I did notice after 30 mins of cooking that the butter had mostly pooled in the middle and that the middle wasn't quite cooked but the edges were nice and brown.  I tilted the pan around to get the excess butter to the edges and then baked another 5 mins and it was perfect!

Made this last night for a Mexican themed dinner and it was a huge hit. No one could tell it was made with crescent rolls.  I used less sugar and baked for 10 min longer as suggested by other reviewers.  Will definitely make this again!

The first time I made this I goofed and used 2 cups sour cream instead of the cream cheese. Everyone LOVED it. Went to make it a second time and noticed my mistake so made it the correct way and everyone liked it better with the sour cream....so the oops turned out better!!

I am very pleased with this recipe. It is heavenly! Looked and smelled so good, I had to try it before it even cooled fully. Tastes like the best cheese Danish you'll ever have.

This was great and so satisfying.  I only wish it kept well.  It really has to be enjoyed the day it's made (which shouldn't be too hard to do with a crowd!).  I found that it gets soggy and not nearly as appetizing if you try to save pieces in the fridge for later.

I used refrigarated dough sheets so no rolling or stretching needed.. so easy! I used plain old vanilla too and it tasted just fine! Also it tasted Way better after being chilled overnight. Only problem was the butter pooling on the top I had to scoop some off with a spoon. Overall great recipe everyone liked it!

I messed up the recipe.  I put the butter in with the cream cheese instead of on top.  It came out wonderful anyway.  I did use half cup sugar on top instead of 3/4.  I used the honey.  Will make again.

This recipe is loved by everyone and each time I make it, I have several requests for the recipe.  So easy to make and your house smells wonderful.  Instead of the crescent rolls, I use 2 Pastry Dough Sheets and cut slits in the top piece of dough.

Delicious -- can't wait to take it to our playoff tailgate tomorrow! I used the big, flaky kind of crescents, so I had more than enough dough for top & bottom. I sprinkled some crushed pecans on top with the butter, cinnamon and sugar, just because I had them left over from the crust of a regular cheesecake I was making -- that turned out to be a tasty addition. But this is an awesome recipe as is, and I'll definitely be making it again.

Served this as a sweet addition to a tex mex small plates menu.  I thought it was much better the next day after refrigerating overnight.  Guests liked it.  I sprinkled the bottom "crust" with cinnamon before adding filling.  Also I do think the honey added another layer of flavor.

Super easy and Delicious.  Pillsbury makes crescent roll dough in sheets with no seems which fit perfectly in a 9x13.  Made as directed.  I would suspect that you could decrease the amount of butter used. 
I served mine cold.

I have made this twice now.  I added an extra cream cheese and some extra vanilla to the filling.  I also added more cinnamon to the top and halved the butter.  I also baked the bottom crust for about 8-10 minutes before pouring the crust on to make it not as gooey.

WOW!  I'm not even a cheesecake fan, but these were DELICIOUS!  I made it exactly as is.  But it says 12 servings, I easily got 25 little squares.  Which would be fine for a gathering because all you need is a couple bites.  They are very sweet because of that topping.  SO VERY GOOD though.

It's a bit annoying rolling out the dough, but this is a REALLY good and simple recipe. I left it in the oven for 36 min and doubled the vanilla (as I always do when I bake) and it came out just right.

Everyone really enjoyed this dessert.  I did cut down on the sugar on both sides of the recipe and melted the butter to make it easy to spread on top.  Lastly, I did use a little bit more regular vanilla since I didn't have Mexican vanilla.  I found that baking it in a "pampered chef" stoneware pan baked more evenly and the top was more even and little butter pooling.

What a great recipe and there are so many neat ways to modify it.  I've made it three times now and each time I have made it differently.  The first time I lined it with pealed and sliced granny apples, the second time I folded the cream filling into the croissant rolls individually and poured butter, cinnamon, and sugar over them, and the third time I added pumkin in with the cream cheese mixture.  All three times were a hit!

It kind of reminds me of a cinnamon roll, but not as good. Very rich. Will not make again.

Made this twice already. My BF liked it so much that he asked me to make it for his parents on our next visit. They loved it, too! I couldn't find Mexican vanilla, so I used a little more regular vanilla, and it was fine. I also didn't roll out the crescent rolls with a rolling pin, just gently unrolled, stretched them to fit the pan, and pinched the seams closed. The cinnamon/sugar/butter mix on top covers up everything! I needed to bake it about 40 minutes, and it was perfect--and perfectly addicting!

The recipe says, and I use the quotes very loosly or wrong, but  ... "let fully cool, before cutting into squares."  WHO ON EARTH could let THIS cool before getting some 'tiny' spoonfuls of it just after it comes out of the oven?  And then, not being able to stop!  LOL I actually had to go sneak another piece before I hit RATE on this post.  This stuff is delicious!

Very tasty, light, used smart balance and splenda, low fat cream cheese & cresent rolls. Did use honey as my husband adores it. He hates cheesecake but really enjoyed this. Go figure.

Delicious for folks who love cream cheese.  I found the cream cheese flavor a bit overpowering.  Nevertheless, it's always a hit, so I've made it at least 5 times.

Easiest thing I've done in a long time and got so many rave reviews.  Son made me promise not to take this to work (he wanted it all to himself) and also asked that I start making IT for his birthday instead of a cake.  I thought it a bit rich (cut very small squares) but tasty.  Made it exactly as directed.  Had to bake 10 mins longer.  Probably will bake about 15 mins longer next time.  Very good though.

This competes with the World's Best Lasagna recipe on this site for the best recipes on here.  Wonderful, perfect.  The only thing I do differently is use low-fat items instead of regular.  Perfect.

This is possibly one of THE best desserts I've ever eaten! Everyone who tasted it said the same thing. Very simple and quick to put together. I made it exactly as stated, but baked it for about 40-45 minutes to get it done in the middle. I think I'll experiment with swirling some raspberry or strawberry jam into the filling before putting on the top crust next time, just to chage it up a bit, even though it's perfect just the way it is. Definitely my new favorite go-to dessert!

Everyone loved this, but I would have baked it about five more minutes because a few areas weren't totally baked through. One of my co-workers doesn't like things cooked using pre-fabbed dough, but he liked it, too!

Made as directed. Had to adjust cooking time. I gauged this by gently shaking the pan to see if the cream cheese had started to set. This varies for me, but typically results in an additional 10 minutes of cooking time. Note: I live in the mountains in Utah, so higher elevation considerations. Aside from that, I reduced the amount of sugar that gets dotted with cinnamon on top of the cheesecake pie to 1/2 cup versus 3/4 cup. This dish is sweet enough as it is! Be prepared to have this recipe printed out, because you will be asked for it!

As it stands this recipe is very good, but a little too sweet for my taste. The first time I prepared this, I followed the recipe to the letter. Since then I have made these changes: lessened the sugar mixed with the cream cheese to 3/4 cup, added 1 tablespoon fresh orange zest to the cheese mixture, and lessened the sugar in the topping to 1/2 cup. Now this is an even bigger hit with my friends and family.

SUPER.  I thought it was even better day #2.  Keep refrigerated.  I made the filling with 8 oz. full-fat cream cheese and 8 oz. reduced-fat, reduced filling sugar to 3/4 c., and beat in 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice plus 1/2 tsp. lemon zest as well with the vanilla.  For topping, I reduced sugar to 1/2 c. and butter to 5 T.  Still a rich dessert, but tried to cut down a little.  People really like it.  I cut it into squares of about 1 & 1/2", so people can eat 1 or 5 or more!  Lots of friends will be making this now.  Thanks.

I wasn't crazy about this.  The cresent dough was hard to work with and it came out undercooked.  It tasted like a backward cinnamon roll only I like my cinnamon rolls better.  Wont be making this again.

This was amazingly delicious!  Thanks for sharing.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and cut the sugar down a bit.  I used about 2/3 cup with the cream cheese mixture and 1/2 cup for the topping.  It came out sweet enough for me.  I like the fact that people can adjust the sugar in the recipe to their own taste.  Thanks again!  This is definitely a keeper for my recipe box.

This is really good and really easy. My suggestions-I made half my batch by putting strawberry jam on top of the cheese filling before the topping with second crescent roll sheet. It was delicious! I can't really imagine making this again without some sort of fruit in the middle, I'm trying raspberry next time, as well as swirling the fruit jam into the cheese mixture a bit so the crescent on top doesn't slide around as much once cut. I also agree that the butter on top needs to be reduced to atleast a 1/4 cup. I may do as others as have suggested and just paint it on and then sprinkle sugar. I had to pull this out at the end of the cooking time, sop up a ton of pooled butter in the middle w/paper towels and pop it back in another five minutes to try and get the huge sag in the middle of my dessert to disappear. This was my test run before making this for a large company event. My husband loved it and I thought it was very good, good enough to move forward with making it for my party.

My husband rarely eats sweet food, but absolutely loved this one!  He and our guests said that it is one of the best desserts they have ever had.  I made some very minor changes, for convenience sake.  First, I did not know what Mexican vanilla was and could not find it, so I just substituted regular vanilla.  Also, I did not have much time, so rather than rolling out and shaping the dough, I just unrolled it from the package and placed it on the bottom of the pan.  Then, I used my hands to lightly pinch the seams together.  I did the same for the top layer.  It came out perfectly with less work.  I also continued baking it for a few extra minutes, because some of the butter had pooled in the middle.  The result was perfection.  I will be making this dessert many times in the future!  EDIT: I still make this dessert ALOT!  If you do not have time to soften the cream cheese, do not worry, it still tastes great when beaten.  Also, if you do not have time to get the butter to room temperature, you can just use your hands to mix the butter with the sugar and cinnamon.  I just keep squeezing the sugar into the butter, until it is all broken off and is gooey.  Although messy, it is a quick way to compensate for not having room temperature butter.

This is amazingly good and simple to make.  When I was shopping for the ingredients, I was pleased to find that Pillsbury now offers "single sheet" crescent roll dough so it makes it even easier to make a recipe like this.  No need to use a rolling pin roll the perforated pieces together.  Like other reviewers, I did not feel the need to put honey on after baking.  Very sweet and yummy without it.  This will be my new go-to recipe for staff breakfast potlucks!

This was a "sleeper" for me.  I wasn't impressed when it first came out of the oven since, as others mentioned, the butter was pooled on the top and not appetizing at all.  However, I let it cool and put in fridge overnight.  After my first bite I couldn't decide if I liked it, so I took another bite, then another.  I am now addicted!  Brought some to my "testers" at work and they loved it!  I used Madagascar vanilla and didn't roll out the dough -just unrolled it by hand and pressed into the pan.  This is a keeper for me, thank you!

I made this for our Cinco de Mayo celebration at work and my co-workers loved it! Several of them asked for the recipe.  I love that it's super easy to make.  I didn't have Mexican vanilla, so I used regular vanilla and doubled it.  I also didn't have butter (how does that happen?!) so I used margarine and it turned out just fine.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I wanted something sweet, easy to make, quick and what I got was absolutely amazing!  I took pix but mine look like all the fantastic pictures here so I posted one to FB.  After dinner and this for dessert last night, I just stood back and accepted all the credit!  This is delicious and I just wanted to say "thank you"!

It is still cooling. But I'm hoping someone will help me because I followed the recipe and it seemed like a LOT of topping - 1/2 cup butter with the sugar and cinnamon covered the Whole Top. Is it supposed to? I couldn't see the crescent dough through the topping. And it did take quite a bit longer to bake.

Soooooo Good! I've made this three times now by family request! I would highly recommend using the regular crescent rolls and not the seamless...when you use the seamsless the butter/sugar topping pools in the dips and is very hard to distribute evenly.  When using the regular crescent rolls the topping was able to drip through the seams, making the top much crispier.

This was very good! The only slight changes I made was to add a bit of cinnimon and honey to the cream cheeses mixture, although it is fine without it. I also melted the butter, and poured it on the top rather than trying to dot the softened butter mixture on top, just because it was easier!

A WONDERFUL dessert ... I made it for a BBQ party celebrating the visit of an aunt and uncle.  Everyone loved it.  The only change I made was to serve it with agave nectar available on the side instead of honey.  The dessert stands on it's own without the honey or agave, but a little drizzle of it does taste good!  I will make this again ... and probably soon.

I really don't understand the high ratings for this.  I made this today for x-mas dessert and I was really expecting it to wow me but it did not. It was ok-don't get me wrong but not the wow factor. I also had a heck of a time getting the top crust on, basically just pieced it together, which really did not matter since I added cool whip to each piece anyway.

It really was very good. I took it to a Xmas party and it was gone in a flash. Everyone wanted the recipe. It was a bit difficult to roll out the dough as I was making it too large, but it was nice to have a bigger piece int eh bottom because it held all the filling. The top dough pulled back a bit but it still looked and tasted good. I ued only 1/3 of a cup of butter and it was just as good and without any butter puddling in the middle. I would use a bit less sugar for the topping next time because it turned out very thick, though it tasted good. I think 1/2 c of sugar would have been enough, for sure. I also didn't use the honey asx it didn't need it and the best part was the crackly top, which would have been gone if the honey was on it. I didn't use Mexican vanilla s I didn't have any. Overall, this is my new go- to recipe. :)

Such a simple recipe with amazing results.  I forgot to add the honey but it was still as people say "The best dessert you've ever made" and I make desserts all the time.  Using the crescent creations seamless dough made this recipe even easier.

This was very tasty. I give it 4 stars and not 5 because it wasn't the best dessert ever. It seemed to be lacking a little something. I drizzled chocolate sauce over it and garnished each piece with a dollop of whipped cream and a sliced strawberry. Looked great and guests loved it.

This is an absolutelyl delicious dessert.  I made it yesterday and everyone went crazy for it.  will definitely be making this again but will make two pans next time.  I made it exactly as written with the exception of needing to leave it in the oven for a total of 45 minutes in order to get the center completely baked while covering the outer edges with foil during the last 5 minutes of baking so they wouldn't burn.  Thank you for sharing the recipe for this marvelous cake.

Highly addictive! I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup, and increased the cinnamon by 1 tsp., but it was still wonderful! I will be making this again (and again, and again!).

This recipe is AMAZING!  I heard in on the radio around Super Bowl time.  I have made it several times and it is always a hit.  You can't eat just one piece!  The only thing I do differently is melt the butter and pour it over the uncooked cheesecake.  Then I sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the top and cook.  This is one of those recipes that you'll make over and over!

LOVE this recipe and it's so easy to make in a pinch. I usually add an egg to the cream cheese filling, and skip the honey on top.  SO GOOD!

Very easy to follow recipe and it was a hit at the Mexican themed dinner party I took it too. Sweet on it's own..didn't really even need the honey, but it adds to the presentation..my cake pan was MIA, so I rolled the cresent rolls into a big cicle and patted them into a pie plate.  Used about half of the cinnamon butter topping..and could have even used less.  Great recipe overall...next time I may add some slivered almonds or a ribbon of cinnamon through the pie.  THANX!

I had high expectations for this recipe, and it failed to deliver.  My husband thought it tasted like a poorly put together cinnamon roll, and i realized it's pretty much the same ingredients, just a differnet presentation.  If i made it again, i would add another package of cream cheese, cut the amount of sugar in half, and not eat it warm.  It was much better after it had been refrigerated.  I made it for a dinner party, and it failed to impress.

I made this for a dinner club - our theme was Mexican foods. Everyone raved about it and went for seconds. Was even great the next day cold from the fridge.  This will be something I can make easily when I want a sweet dessert as the ingredients are so simple!!

This recipe was amazing! I took it to a family event and it was gone in a matter of an hour :)     I did have a little trouble with rolling the cresent rolls out, I added some flour and it was fine though.

This is a keeper!  I found the Mexican vanilla and noticed a difference- just a stronger vanilla flavor.  This will be my go-to dessert for pot lucks from now on.

These are RIDICULOUSLY fabulous! Sopapilla's and cheesecake combined, doesn't get much better! The only change I made was using 2 10 oz. cans of Big & Flaky crescent rolls instead of the regular 8 oz. cans., which made the "bars" super fluffy and oh so good! This is a must for anyone to try :)

You could make it with your eyes closed and still generate a big "WOW" from anyone who tries it! I brought it to an Easter dinner and was skeptical because it almost seemed too simple. I wasn't sure it would impress the guests. Boy, was I wrong! Even non-dessert lovers loved it! Some even had a second helping!   The only thing I have to say about the preperation is that you really don't have to use a rolling pin. In fact, I found it much easier to set the dough pieces in my pan and then pinch the seams to seal and spread everything out that way to make it fit.   These days, I'm wary to try new recipes for fear that they won't work out and I will have wasted money and time. I guarantee you this recipe will work out for you.  :) Enjoy!

I agree that this is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly, except for towards the end I made the mistake of putting the honey in with the sugar...oops.  Instead of tossing it and remaking that part, I just went with it.  The honey made a few parts a little chewy, but it was still yummy. I'll make sure to not do that though next time. As far as baking time, it ended up taking about 55 minutes for it to be cooked all the way through.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I changed it a little after reading the reviews.  I used three packages of crescent rolls....it made it easier for me to cover the 9 x 13 glass pan.  I pressed those in.  Then I mixed 3 pkgs. of cream cheese neufschatel with 1 cup of sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla.  Poured that in the crust and topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon.  rolled out the rest of the crescent rolls placed those on top.  Pressed all the edges.  Melted the butter poured it over, then sprinkled only 1/2 cup of sugar all over and some more cinnamon.  Baked for 35 minutes then drizzled honey on it.  Let it sit for an hour then cut and served.  It was an absolute rave recipe with co-workers.  Easy, easy, easy and I was told it was good.  I never got a piece!

This dessert was wonderful!  Very easy to prepare, especially now that you can buy Crescent Roll Sheets.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use a little less butter for the topping-it seemed to be too much.  Thanks for sharing this delicious dessert recipe!

I'm disappointed...I want to give this recipe a 10 star rating!!! I'll admit I added this recipe to my favorites BEFORE I tried it (just watching the video I knew it sounded yummy). O M G !!! This dessert is decadent, creamy, easy to make, delicious, and will be forever added to my go to list of recipes. Yes I followed the recipe to the T and yes when I pulled it from the oven there were puddles of butter sitting on the top (that's what makes it so incredible, besides the cream cheese). Let's face it...its a dessert people (desserts were invented to be sinful and certainly this one fits the bill). I'm tempted to make this too often but both my husband and I wouldn't fit through the door ?? If you do not try this recipe you are missing out on one of the most delicious dessert you'll ever eat. Try it!

I really don't know what everyone is raving about. This was no big deal. Followed directions exactly and just didn't care for it. Kept refrigerated since it's cream cheese and was mushy the next day. Won't make again.

I have been making this recipe for about 10 years. Over the years, I have tweeked the recipe. I now add a teaspoon cinnamon to the cream cheese mixture. This balances the sugar taste in the mixture, and also adds a lot more flavor. I also recommend using Watkins brand cinnamon. If you don't have a place that sells it you can buy it on Amazon.

This is incredibly easy to make and was well-liked in my house.  I don't have ANY of the complaints that the Most Critical Review entails; not super sweet, no butter puddles, cream cheese texture was just fine.  Will definitely make this again!

This was very good! A huge hit for my Mexican themed dinner.  I read the reviews and made the suggested changes: increased to 3 blocks of cream cheese, 1 1/2 sugar, 2 t Mexican vanilla for the filling, slightly buttered the bottom crust baked it for 7 minutes, and as for the sugar and butter on top, I greatly reduced them to just about 4T  butter and 1/4 c sugar with cinnamon.  I spread the butter on the top and then added the cinnamon mixture.  It did bake for 45 minutes, felt a tad soft, but firmed up nicely to cut when cooled.  I got 15 bars that were perfect and well liked by all.  Honey was served on the side but the dessert didn't need it. Perfectly sweet but not too sweet. My guests asked for the recipe. This was very easy!

Finally made something the whole fam enjoyed!  Now my husband wants me to make it every time we get together with, well, anyone!  Personally I would like the cheesecake filling a little creamier, just a little, if anyone has any suggestions on how to do that (I'm not much of a cook so I haven't a clue).  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

I used the given measures. The only change I made to the ingredient list was pure vanilla extract - I do not have Mexican vanilla. I do not own a rolling pin, so I simply laid the dough in the pan and pinched the seams together. I did the same for the top layer of dough. This worked well. Also, the mixture of butter, sugar and cinnamon turned out more like a paste/frosting, so instead of dotting it on top, I spread it over the entire top layer of dough. When the pie finished baking, some of the butter had pooled, so, using pot holders, I lifted the pan and tipped it in all directions until the butter was displaced and soaked up. I thoroughly enjoyed this dessert. The only change I want to make next time I bake this is bake the bottom layer of dough for about 5 minutes, then follow the recipe as given. Though I enjoyed eating this, the bottom layer of dough seemed like it never cooked. It looked uncooked after having put a piece on my plate, and I could taste that specifically the bottom layer was not cooked. If you want a cold treat, I recommend putting this in the fridge after having cooled, or cutting into squares then putting in the freezer after having cooled. I made this for my parents and husband several days ago, and they all said it was delicious. Today my husband took some leftover pieces of the dessert to work to share with his co-workers. I haven't heard their opinions yet, though someone already asked my husband for the recipe. This recipe will not disappoint!

So easy and delicious! If you like cream cheese based desserts, this is a must try. I halved the recipe which worked perfect in a 8x8 pan, with one can of crescent rolls split in half between the bottom and the top. And the crescents happened to be the reduced fat type...but couldn't tell the difference!

This is really delicious. I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut down the sugar in the cream cheese by 1/3 cup, and it was still borderline too sweet. As written, I think it would be overwhelmingly sugary. You could add another block of cream cheese to make more filling (it's a thin layer as written, in the pan size suggested) but keep all other ingredients as the same and it would be perfect I think. I also cut the butter for the topping by almost 1/2 and it was perfect, cut the sugar in the topping down to 1/3 cup, and honestly, could cut more from that as well. Then I made additional changes simply to cut fat and calories -used 1 block of Greek cream cheese (it's really good, and next time I will substitute it entirely and cut 320 calories and 48g of fat from the entire desert and add 16g of protein!) I also used low fat crescent rolls. With the other reductions of butter and sugar that I made, and cutting into 16 serv (about the size of an average brownie serving) I got them down to 255 cal and 13g of fat (as written 480 cal per!) Substituting all Greek cream cheese will drop them about another 20 calories or so. I also left off the honey so we can just put it on individual pieces. I didn't try it tonight, but I will tomorrow :-)

I wasn't sure how this would be with crescent rolls on top because it sounded odd, but I loved rhis cheesecake and so did my co-workers!  I could not find Mexican vanilla so I just used regular vanilla.  I put a little extra in (only because I do that for any recipe that calls for vanilla - or brown sugar- I never measure).  I also added extra cinnamon (another thing I don't measure).   My tip for rolling out the crescent roll dough is to roll it out between 2 sheets of parchment paper.  The dough doesn't stick to the rolling pin and you can transfer it to the pan easier by holding the paper over the pan and just letting it roll off the parchment paper.  I baked it for about 40 minutes.  After making this, I found a similar recipe with apples that I will definitely be trying.

So I've made Sopapilla Cheesecake before, but this is a MUCH better version of the recipe. I made a few adjustments, based on reading other reviewer's advice. I reduced the sugar to about half of what it calls for in the filling - I wanted to taste the cheese, not the sugar. I pre-baked the bottom layer of crescent roll dough for about 6 minutes, until it started puffing, as I remember I had to over-cook the recipe last time to get the dough to fully bake. I rolled out the top layer of crescent roll dough onto waxed paper, so it was much easier to size and place on top of the filling. I added extra cinnamon to the topping. Also, to make the topping MUCH easier to spread, I cut the amount of butter needed to 3/4 of the recipe amount, and fully melted it in the microwave; then added it to the cinnamon and sugar and spread it evenly on top. 
All-in-all, this is a perfect recipe to share, for bake sales, for school parties, etc. Thanks!

Very very sweet. I cut the sugar in half for the cream cheese mixture. Then for the topping I drizzled melted butter over the too and the sprinkled the sugar mixture on top. Otherwise there's  pools of butter everywhere. Let cool then refrigerate before slicing.

This looked and smelled delicious but the five different people that I gave it to said they didn't like it.  Some said it was too rich and they wouldn't want a second bite, others didn't like it but couldn't figure out what exactly it was that they didn't like.  Sorry, but I cannot recommend this recipe.  P.S. I made it exactly as the recipe was stated and did not change a thing.

Breaking it down - the preparation is very kid friendly so my girls were able to help out a lot and that's important to me. The recipe itself is very simple and the cost is about $6 to $8 for a 9x13 pan. It will make your house smell wonderful and it does not make a big mess. The bottom line to any recipe is the taste and this one delivers! This one will be in the bake-n-take party / event lineup. A true 5 star champ! *note* I did not use the honey so not sure what using it adds but it was fine without it. I may add it next time.

Even though this recipe has been in my recipe box forever, I made this on a whim tonight. As an avid review reader, I didn't have time to read many, so I made it pretty much as directed (odd for me). After reading more reviews, I absolutely agree that it needs the 3rd package of cream cheese (I added cinnamon to mine since I love it) and the topping can be reduced as well. I made my topping with 1/4 cup butter and half white and brown sugars, which I'd do again. I thought the honey would make this TOO sweet, so I cut the squares and added the honey to each individual piece. It was perfect!  Will definitely make this again and again with a few minor tweaks.

This recipe is amazing! Had to bake it for 40 minutes(rather than 30 minutes) and did not have to pre-bake the crust. I could not find Mexican Vanilla so I used regular vanilla and it was wonderful. They were gone fast! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I love this recipe.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  After starting, I realized I didn't have enough sugar.  I was 1/4 cup off on the filling (I think it would be sinfully delicious if I used the full cup).  I'll be sure to have all the necessary ingredients on hand when I make this again.  The only thing I did differently was that I allowed the bottom layer of crescent rolls to bake while I mixed the cheese filling. I didn't want the bottom layer to be under cooked.  I also baked at 375 because my oven usually takes a little longer than these recipes suggest.  I softened the butter for the topping enough for the mixture to be sort of creamy and much easier to spread over the top, but not enough to be a liquid.  This is a new favorite in my home.  Thank you

Well, the reviews were right!! We had a Mexican themed pot luck at work today so I made this. Followed others suggestions and cut back the sugar and butter in the topping (5 T butter, 1/2 cup sugar) but pretty much stuck to the recipe. I've never been asked for a recipe so much!! And it was the only dessert that was completely gone before the lunch was over! Definitely a winner!! And to think you can easily halve the recipe for a smaller crowd?? Bonus!!

Fantastic!  Made this for 10 people on Mother's Day.   It was gone in no time at all.  Perfect amount (and yes, we're big eaters).  Great mix of flavors and easy to prepare.  Will definitely make it again.  Several people complimented me on the perfect blend of spices.  Of course, I graciously accepted the compliment.  *LOL*

As a guy, this is by far one of my favorites to make, because it is super easy and super tasty. I modify mine though (warning, not for the calorie counters), by stuffing and folding the individual crescent rolls with the cream cheese mixture, frying at 350 for about 5 minutes, and spreading the sugar/cinnamon mix while still hot. True stuffed sopa pilla. Cheers!

This was fantastic! I wish I had found this recipe sooner. I used Truvia baking sugar for the regular white sugar, 1/3 less fat cream cheese and I Can't Believe it's not Butter. I had to use regular vanilla extract because my store did not have Mexican. I melted the stick of butter and combined with the Truvia and cinnamon and brushed the top of the pie as another reviewer had done. This was the best dessert I have ever made!

I got this recipe from my husband's family in Virginia,they call it "Williamsburg Bread". It is pretty much the exact same thing, minus the honey. I think it would be way too sweet with honey on top. It is very sweet and rich as is.

I also bake the bottom crust first, without the filling and all, until it is lightly browned, which keeps it from getting soggy. I brush the top crust with melted butter and then sprinkle with cinnamon and white sugar, generously, but not too much.

My whole family loves this, it's always gone in no time. I like it best the next day, after a night in the fridge in a plastic container.

Followed the recipe with the exception of adding drizzled honey after baking and I know that wasn't the problem. Wasn't bad but certainly wasn't great...

So I did do this different than the recipe, but the idea was great!  
I hate crescent rolls normally, but using them for this was simple and delicious.  
I halved the recipe and eye balled the butter and cinnamon sugar mixture on top.  I did not add the honey.

Read the reviews and decided I should cut back sugar.  Now wish I had made it according to recipe.  I have a southern palate.  Pecan pie, sweet tea....need I say more.

WOW this was good!!  Followed the recipe except patted the rolls out instead of rolling, and only made half the recipe in a 9x6 glass dish; 30 minutes was perfect. Yes it's sweet but super tasty, easy to make (except for that top crust part which was a bit of a pain). For the topping I melted the butter, brushed about half of it over the top crust, sprinkled all the cinnamon-sugar over, then drizzled the remaining melted butter over. YUM!

I have been making this for years.  My recipe doesn't use honey, I use a lot more cinnamon and mine doesn't mix the sugar, cinnamon and butter.  You put the cinn., sugar mix on top and pour melted butter over it all.  I have served this many many times and have never found anyone that didn't love it.  It's a must at Christmas time.  A true favorite, for sure.

LOVE these! Thank you for sharing. I added an egg to the cheesecake filling and reduced the sugar to 1/2. I mixed all that in a blender. For the topping I used 1/4 cup sugar with 2 teaspoons cinnamon and just sprinkled it over the dough after taking it out of the oven (I didn't use butter or honey in the topping). We sampled when cool and it was delish, but it was even better the next day! I definitely recommend making them up a day ahead. Thanks for an easy and versatile recipe!

Pretty good, but not amazing. The kids at the potluck seemed to like it better than the adults did. I would suggest making it the day before you want to eat it because it takes HOURS to cool & I think it is better well chilled. I won't make it again, but everyone else seemed to like it.

I love this recipe! I have adjusted it over the years and now only use 1 can of crescent rolls as the bottom crust, add chocolate chips to the filling, and after it comes out of the oven I drizzle it with caramel. You could add chopped walnuts on top for the full turtle cheesecake experience but I don't like walnuts. So yummy and I'm asked to bring it to every pot luck at work!

This is a staple for us! I made the following changes for us:
reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat crescents, 2/3c sugar instead of 1c. And for the cinnamon/sugar topping I used only a light dusting on top. Also cut the butter down to 1/4cup. We LOVE this dessert!

Best dessert out there. Phenomenal flavor, especially after you let it sit in the refrigerator for about 24 hours. I didn't have any Mexican vanilla, so I used regular.

I made this for my Spanish class and everyone loved it the crescent rolls were sort of hard to roll out but I got it to work. People in my class asked me to make it again. Instead of using Mexican vanilla extract I just used normal vanilla extract and it still tasted really good.

This is wonderful!  I've made it several times exactly as written.  It is difficult to get the crescent roll crusts smoothed out, especially for the top.  I rolled both crusts out to size on the countertop and then transferred them to the pan but they wanted to tear easily.  Rave reviews but not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.

This is VERY delicious and super easy to make! I made it exactly like the recipe. Next time will not add the 3/4 cups of sugar to the top it is WAY too much for me and my family. I think I'll just sprinkle to top generously with the sugar and spice mixture.

I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, so this wasn't my favorite. That said, the entire 9 by 14 pan was GONE at the potluck I took it to, which I consider a great success. Also fabulous was the short time in which all of it came together. Thanks for the crowd pleaser!

This was easy enough to make and I had high hopes for it. It smelled delicious in the oven. I took it out and let it cool before serving. THIS WAS ALL SUGAR. It was so sugary, I couldn't eat it. I couldn't taste any dough-just sugar and super rich cream cheese. I had to freeze half of it because no one ate it. I'm interested to see if it might taste better partially frozen or at least cold. But I wouldn't make this again unless I used half the cream cheese and sugar-ugh.

Made this for company yesterday and it was extremely well received!  I used regular vanilla and only 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 for the topping.  I would also reduce the butter a little next time, it pooled at the top in some places and I had to soak it up with a paper towel.  This is a very rich and tasty dessert.  Just a small piece goes a long way!

Just made this for a Cinco de Mayo dinner and it was fabulous. When purchasing the crescent rolls for the crust I discovered you can buy the dough that is in a solid sheet rather than cut for rolls. The sheet was just the right size for a 9x13 pan and made the recipe so easy to assemble. I also used my food processor to mix the butter, cinnamon & sugar...another time saver. This recipe will be one I definitely make again!

Very easy dessert to make and very delicious. We couldn't wait for it to cool down, so we snuck a piece warm & it was delicious. It was also delicious refrigerated too. Fresh outta the oven, there was butter pooled in the center. I took a spoon and poured it over the edges, but as it cooled off, it soakd in. I only used about 1/2 c, sugar w/ the butter, and only a little honey drizzled over the top. Very sweet and very delicious. will make again and again. It would taste great with a lemon extract put into the cream cheese mixture.

OMG!  This was so easy and super delicious!  I also used reduced fat cresent rolls, just pieced it together in the pan and closed the seams.  The cream cheese mixture was so smooth.  i also sprayed I can't believe it's not butter on the top layer and them sprinkled with cinnnamon sugar.  It was gone the same day with request to make it again!  Think it would be great with some berries!

Doesn't get any easier than this and it tastes amazing.  I made for a  mexican fiesta and every single person there asked for the recipe.. if the wives didn't want to the husbands asked for it on behalf of their wives.  Great for entertaining...seem like they'd be so hard to make, but they aren't!

Took this to a party last night and got rave reviews. Easy to make with ingredients usually on hand in my kitchen.

Excellent.  I, too, cut down on the amount of sugar.  Everyone love this and asked for the recipe.  VERY quick and easy to make.

I made this as written for a mexican pitch-in lunch at work.  It was a hit!  It is so easy to make too, just be sure the butter and cream cheese are at room temperature before starting.  Thanks!

This is a rich and decadent dessert that is just as good for a guilty pleasure breakfast as it is for an after dinner indulgence.  But because it is so rich, you eat small portions! (always a win for me!)  Easy to make and wonderful to enjoy.

The easiest and most delicious dessert around. The butter mixture on the top is a bit too much and pools in the middle, other than that yummolicious!

VERY GOOD! With chocolate syrup and raspberries - irresistable. Don't eat too much - your stomach will hurt. The Mexican vanilla I would add a little more of but good stuff!

I have made this twice in less than 2 weeks cannot get over how easy this is to make and great tasting.  I added 1/4 teas. of nutmeg and cinnamon to the cream cheese and omitted the honey.  I used brown sugar with butter for the topping and do not overmix otherwise it will turn to mush.  Loved the results!

AMAZING!! Most delisious cheesecake I've ever had! I can't figure out any way to make this better. I tried making it in an 8"x8" pan just reducing the ingrediants an it didn't taste as good. This is perfect1

Very easy to make and very good! I bought the Pillsbury crescent rolls and they unroll perfectly into the 13x9 pan. I do however have to give most of it away when I make it so I do not eat it all myself.

This was very good.  Honestly it was a Little too sugary though, and I only put 2/3 cup sugar in the topping.  I think the overall sugar could still be reduced by half a cup.  Just too my much!!

Absolute heaven! Family loved it. The only thing I did different was melt the butter a little more than suggested so that when I mixed it with the cinnamon and sugar I was able to spread it over the entire dish. Came out amazing. Definitely making this again!

I made this recipe exactly as it's written. I took it out of the oven after 30 minutes and saw two pools of butter, which I just scooped up with a spoon. Then I put it in the oven for a few more minutes. I made this with high hopes based on reviews and I wasn't disappointed! I served this still warm because my (grown) siblings demanded that I quit hoarding the dessert and serve it already, even if it said to serve it cooled. The three of us and the three others who came to dinner ate most of the pan. I managed to save a piece to taste the next day, once it had cooled. I think it tastes better cooled, but really it's great both ways. I will definitely make this again and I think it will be great to take to a potluck because it's delicious and SO simple to make.

AMAZING!  My hubby (who is a "foodie") raved about this dessert!  Our family & kids (ages 3 & 5) loved it too!  It's one of our favorite desserts.  It was incredible easy to make and not too sweet.  We thought that there was plenty of filling.  (I omitted the honey.)

OH.MY.GOODNESS. This was amazing! I read the reviews and did make some alterations to mine. Used 2 pkg cream cheese, 3/4 c sugar and 1 egg for the filling, but I didn't see how you could have too much butter & sugar/cinnamon mixture, so I didn't skimp on that! Yummy, yummy, yummy! Secret is to put it in refrigerator once it cools. So much better cold than room temperature. Whoever shared this in the first place, I just have to say "Bless Your Heart! and Thank you!" Wonderful recipe I see making over & over again to take to many things.

1/2 the recipe and made in 8x8 pan. Used  1 crescent recipe sheet and just cut in 1/2. Decreased the sugar and butter topping just a bit. Also baked bottom about 5 mins. Sweet but very good.

I don't log in here often, but this dessert is so fantastic I had to review it!    So easy to make, especially with the new pillsbury crescent sheets!  One thing I did was spread the butter/cinnamon/sugar mixture over the top, bake for 30 minutes, then took a spoon and removed the butter that pooled on the top (and prevented the topping from getting crisp in those spots), then baked 10 more minutes.   The topping gets crispy, like a crust, and the honey drizzled on top...OMG.       I brought this to work today, and it's already gone at 9am!    Unbelievably good...

Really delicious! Does not need the honey IMO, with the sweet & cinnamon-y topping. Wasn't even gone from the pan & DH asked me to make another batch really soon-which is a rare request from him with only 1 tiny sweet tooth! hahaha But in all seriousness: It's a keeper recipe & simple to make, I would most definately recommend anyone that is even slightly interested in this recipe to try it. Will try it next time in two 8x8 dishes & will melt the butter & sugar mixture beforehand & put in fridge to resolidify in hopes for a smoother topping texture (can be a bit gritty if the sugar doesn't melt well into the butter as it bakes).

This was a hit today! I reduced sugar by 1/4 in both the filling and topping. I didnt prebake the cresenct roll bottom layer either- and I had no issues. I think next time I may increase the filling like some have, but my coworkers thought they were great as is. Very yummy recipe!

I cannot say enough about this recipe - it's so easy, and it's SO, SO good!  It's sweet, but not too overpoweringly so; I took these to a holiday potluck just a couple days ago, and when I came back to get my platter, they were completely wiped out!  And the ease of making them - literally, the hardest part is unrolling the crescent rolls, and like other reviewers have said, it doesn't have to be perfect b/c it all bakes together into perfect deliciousness!  Highly recommended - and this recipe in particular, some others I've had have been a little too sweet... ENJOY!

Simply delicious!  This dessert has become a regular in our household.  1. It's easy to make  2. It tastes so darn good.  I am making it for a Christmas party tomorrow, if I can get it out of the house without someone sneaking some.

DELICIOUS!! I used "1/3 less fat" cream cheese, and low-fat crescent rolls. I also cut back on the sugar, I put 1/2c in cream cheese mixture, and 1/3c of sugar for top. I drizzeled a little honey on top 10 minutes after I took out of oven. I have a sweet tooth but it was completely sweet enough! I baked it about 38 minutes, seemed too gooey after 30. I will be making this again!

My husband made this for a Mexican Themed potluck lunch where he works. There was one piece left by the end of the lunch! This is so easy to make and way too easy to eat - he went shopping yesterday and bought more dough and cream cheese so he can make it again soon.

I made this for the first time and I put extra vanilla in the cheese cake mixure, I also added in that a little squart of hunney and some cinnamon the mixure was really good. My only problem was the cresent rolls, I felt that I didnt have enough to get it all over the bottem and the top so I skipped the top! I hope it will turn out alright!

I made exactly as the recipe describes, except with regular vanilla (I am not sure where to find Mexican).  It is phenomenal!  We had friends over for dinner and they raved and raved.  Will definitely make again (and again and again).

I love this recipe it is so easy at least for me :) I have made this on several occasions to take to different events and the folks always think this is like a gourmet dish. Then I tell them how easy it is and send them to the All Recipes page, however noone has seem to be able to get it right. IDK this has to be one of the simplest recipes on here  not sure why/how it could get messed up. If you haven't tried this one you should easy easy easy! Thank you CandleB for adding it to the site.

I love cheesecake and I love cinnamon-sugar, but this snack was extra sweet. We ended up scraping most of the top layer off. If it had aproximately half the sugar less, it would have probably tasted better....UPDATED...everyone else that tried it loved it the way it was...Something wrong with my taste buds I guess. :-)

easy to make, just added another tsp of vanilla since i couldn't find the mexican kind. everything was perfect except there was a small pool of melted butter on the top, so i'd lessen the butter the next time. this is a great recipe.

3.5 stars rounded up.  These were easy to make and fun to put together.  I made them for a friend and her children love them.  One child woke up early in the morning to sneak in a few bites before Mom caught him.  Cute.

I just finished baking and cooling these AMAZING Sopapilla cheesecake squares. I was searching for a Mexican desert to make for my classroom Mexican Fiesta tomorrow. The only part of the recipe I changed was using regular vanilla extract since I wasn't able to find Mexican at my store. This was so simple to prepare and tastes so delicious! I chose to use lowfat cream cheese and lowfat crescent rolls. This has to be my very favorite desert recipe on this site! Thank you very much CandelB! I look forward to bringing them to our Fiesta!

Very easy to make.  Used 1/2 cup sugar on top with butter.  Not sure if butter was needed.  It formed a crusty top which made it a little less appetizing.  Omitted honey also.

Great recipe! I made 2 pans for a potluck and there were no leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written, but I did sprinkle some pecans on top before baking. Delicious! I am sure I will make this again!

I loved this recipe!  It was quick, easy and delicious!  I used reduced fat cream cheese and used 3/4 c versus 1 c of sugar for the filling and 1/2 c versus 3/4 c sugar for the topping and it was plenty sweet.  I didn't measure the honey, but I just lightly drizzles it over the top.  This will be going into my recipe binder for something quick and easy to make for potlucks/parties!

I have made this recipe for several years now, with rave reviews every single time.  I have recently discovered that there are now whole sheets of the dough, meaning no seams to have to pinch together or roll out!  ????

This is AMAZING! I was turned onto this by a fellow teacher, and now want to make it for every occasion.  Because we love cheesecake so much, I took the advice of another reviewer and added an extra package of cream cheese for more filling.  Everyone who tastes it wants the recipe. I would recommend this to anyone!

AMAZING!! I love cheesecake and this hits the spot! And it's so simple to make. (sidenote: I bought store brand crescent rolls and they were tearing at the perforations before I could even get them out of the can, I was afraid it wasn't going to work but even still they cooked together to form a solid sheet.) Recipe is perfect,  I will definitely be making this again!

What a great easy and interesting flavored cheesecake.  This is not as sweet as it may sound.  The flaky crescent roll layers really puff and the cream cheese mixture smooths it all out.  You don't need  to massage the crescent dough much.  I just laid them in the pan and squeezed the breaks together.  Even had one triangle separate, just pinched back to gether and it worked great.  The combination of flavors is fantastic.  Actually substittued a bit of brown sugar for the white sugar, about half and half for a bit more flavor.  Also doubled the vanilla.  Fantastic for people who want something sweet and savory.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was so tasty!  A huge hit.  I only have a few changes for next time - I'm going to try increasing the cream cheese filling and cutting back on the butter for the top.  I had so much that there were pools of butter that I had to siphon off when it was done baking.

OH MY - FABULOUS & YUMMY!!!!!!  This is not only easy but wonderful.  Used fat free cream cheese - no one could tell - didn't have mexican vanilla so used 2 tsp pure vanilla extract - AND, softened the butter too much in the microwave for the topping so mixed it with cinnamon & sugar anyway, brushed it over the top - tasted fantastic - definately a keeper.

I love this recipe!! I did customize for my child with a milk allergy. I made his with tofuttie, just a smaller portion. I also omitted the butter on top so it didn't get on his.  I also used the crescent roll sheets!!

Wow! Delicious! Must try it right away if you are even considering it. So little prep time. So cheap to make. I hate cheesecake but this was just perfect. I still hate cheesecake but I'll make this any time. Made as is, I had issues with the crescent rolls overlapping but next time I'll cut in them in half and then layer much easier.

I had never heard of sopapilla before but came across this recipe and really wanted to try it.  I'm so glad I did b/c it was awesome!  I used a little less sugar in the filling and topping based on other reviews but next time I will use all the sugar as no one thought it was too sweet.  I made it the day before our coookout and let it is sit in the fridge all night.  It was just perfect.  I couldn't imagine leaving the honey off as others have.  The honey on top was great!

Amazing! this was so easy to prepare and tastes so good.  I did make some changes per other reviews.  I used half of the sugar that was called for, both in the topping and the filling.  It was still more than sweet enough.  Also for the topping I only used about 2 Tbs of butter and again it was plenty.  This was a hit at home and at a fundraiser!

So easy and so good! I halved the recipe (since it's only 2 of us) but now I wish I would have made the full recipe. Couldn't wait for it to cool and just ate my 1st piece fresh out of the oven- YUM! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is as good as everyone has stated. My mom made sopapilla's when I was a kid, not sweet, just the savory ones and so this really caught my interest.  I used 3/4 cup sugar with cream cheese and less than 1/2 cup for top and only several tbls. honey.  Plenty sweet and delicious. Will make again and again, already being requested.

Made these last night LOVE them! Quick to make and quickly disapeared! Easy. I did roll them out but not to exact size pieced it in was still great. Do use REAL vanilla. (mexican is best) I use it for all my "vanilla" needs. Ask anyone heading to Mexico to bring you back some but careful they to have not real vanilla

AWESOME!!! I made for a Cinco De Mayo work potluck and everyone LOVED it!! THANKS!! The best part is that it is SOOO easy!!  I used regular vanilla, baked for 45 min. stretched out the crescent dough in the pan (did not need to roll it out).  I will be making again as soon as I can.... I will not be waiting for Cinco De Mayo!!

It was yummy!  Since I didn't need 12 servings I halved the recipe and put it in an 8x8 pan.  I also just brushed melted butter over the top and then sprinkled sugar and cinnamon over the top. I also left off the honey and let everyone add it to there own piece.  It is very simple and yummy!

Easy to make and very rich. I used half the sugar it called for because I did not have enough.....glad I did because I think anymore would have been too sweet but that is personal taste. If you like Paula Deens Ooey-gooey butter cake follow this recipe to a T....if you don't because it is too sweet....cut the sugar in half.  I sprinkled cinnamon on the bottom layer of crescent rolls.  I will make this again!  I think in the fall I will put apple pie filling layer on top of the cheese layer also.

I was really surprised by this dessert!  I had never heard of or had sopapilla, and would never have thought to put these ingredients together.  This has been a HUGE hit every time I make it.  It is really rich and decadent, and so easy to make (we'll keep that part a secret).

This was ok. It is very sweet and really not at all what I was expecting. I'm not sure if I will make this again, but if I did; I would reduce the sugar and butter. Way to much. I will probably add half the topping to the cream cheese mixture as well. On the plus side it looked so good! I will keep searching for just the right recipe, unfortunately this isn't it.

Wow!  I wasn't sure about this, it seemed too simple to deserve all the stars.  I was wrong, this is so good!  I could imagine adding a fresh strawberry or raspberry to make a simple yet elegant dessert for guests.  I didn't go to any fuss when I made it because I was just trying it out.  I just unrolled the dough and pretty much slapped it in the pan.  Very easy with great results.

Was looking for an easy Latin dessert to make for guests and found this. Didn't think in reading all the reviews that it could be that good but it is definitely a crowd pleaser and so easy to make.  Next time I'd cut the cinnamon/sugar/butter mixture in half but otherwise everything else is perfect as is!

There is absolutely nothing healthy about this recipe.  It is sugar on top of butter on top of cream cheese on top of butter, but it is SO GOOD.  I made it for a dinner party, and it got rave reviews.  I highly recommend.

This is SO yummy! I take it often as a dessert to share for church potlucks and when we go to someone's home for dinner. Alway always ALWAYS gets great reviews!!! It is an easy and quick dessert to make and if you don't have "mexican" vanilla, regular vanilla extract works just fine. Yumm!

This is easy and delicious!  I used one fat free and one regular cream cheese (what I had on hand) and I didn't bother rolling out the crescent dough.  I just layed it in the pan and pressed it together and it came out fine.  We liked it way better warm than cold, but either way it is yummo!  Thanks for sharing this super recipe!

OK, here's the deal: had a get together of around 70 people, who ALL brought a dish with them.   Needless to say, it was a literal smorgasbord.  I myself made several desserts, all of which were chocolately goodness.  All of the desserts were good, but this little easy simple dessert was the talk of the guests.   Didn't change a thing except for adding another 4 oz of cream cheese and increasing the sugar by 1/4 cup.  The honey is what tops it all off, so don't leave it out.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe.  : )

Unbelievably delicious! I had quite a bit of trouble rolling out the dough enough to fit a 9x13, however. Is there a trick to this that I'm missing? I just BARELY got it to fit after a lot of effort. The taste was much more than I could have even expected. The entire thing was gone in 5 minutes top. Huge hit! Will definitely make again and again!

I can't tell you how awesome this dessert it - it's one of those things that you take a bite of and are just thinking "absolutely ridiculous that something should taste this good!"  A big hit (understatement) the first time I made it, a couple days ago. EVERYONE wanted the recipe.

Holy moly!!! Wow, it was sooo good, followed recipe to a T, and it was phenominal. I'm gonna make this recipe like every week :)....maybe i'll add an egg to the cream cheese mixture next time though, for a firmer cheesecakey texture- my husband disagrees, he says its perfect. thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious.  The hubby doesn't like honey so I will leave it off from now on but it still tasted great.

This is so yummy!  I only used about half the butter mentioned in the recipe, and I cut in the butter with the sugar and cinnamon and spread it over the top crust.  While this dessert was good the first day, I thought it was better the second day-- so delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Seems I'll have to agree with the minority on this one - it just didn't do that much for me....and I love, love , love sopapillas! Although I do have to say that, even though I didn't care for it, it was a hit at the Cinco de Mayo party. To me, it was much too fattening and sweet to eat.

This was absolutely to die for! AMAZING! Super easy, and tasted amazing. I agree with some of the reviews, it was a bit too sweet and next time I'll definitely cut back on the sugar. Secondly, I'd use less butter. I ended up having to sop up some that had puddled up on top. I know this sounds like complaints, but tit was seriously phenomenal.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party and it was a huge hit!  I had my DH try it before we left to make sure it was okay and he almost wouldn't let me take it he liked them so much. I used low fat crescent rolls, low fat cream cheese and regular vanilla extract.  I also just brushed the top crescent rolls with a little soft butter and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on top - so amazing good, definitely didn't need the full 1/2 cup of butter for the top!  I maybe used 2 Tbsp. I also omitted the honey as it definitely didn't need it!!  Fantastic recipe and it throws together so fast!!  Thanks for sharing, I will definitely be making this a regular recipe for our house!

This is an absolutely incredible dessert, and was the highlight of our Cinco De Mayo festivities, but I do have to rate it as it is written.  The butter (I think way too much) was just puddled on top at the end, so I have decided next time I will try to just brush on the butter and then sprinkle cinnamon/sugar on.  It's already too much sugar for me on top, so I will cut down on that next time.  Also, I agree with others that the bottom crescent dough should just be put in the pan and then pushed out to the edges, but for the top, I rolled with a rolling pin and then rolled it very loosley and put on top and unrolled.  It worked very well.  I used 1 package fat free and 1 package reduced fat cream cheese, as well as 3/4 cup sugar instead of the full cup.  This did not tase like it was lacking at all.  The honey, in my opinon, is not necessary, but I did think some fresh strawberries or raspberries would have tasted wonderful.  Try this recipe!  Your taste buds will be delighted!

I have made something similar (Cream Cheese Squares from this site) but loved the addition of the honey from this recipe. I did cut the topping sugar down to 1/3 cup (could do 1/2 cup~I think 3/4 is too much). This was one of the desserts at the Teacher Appreciaton Mexican theme luncheon I did for the middle school staff. Very popular...teacher's came back looking for more. I should have made more. Next week my son is taking this for his Spanish class fiesta. Easy to make and tastes awesome. Cut into small squares. Since it is sweet and rich, it will go far in terms of serving.

Sorry to be the party pooper, but I didn't really think this was anything special.  Super easy,yes.  Outstandingly amazingly tasty, no.  Maybe if you are in a pinch, maybe, this might be ok.  I won't be making it again.  My caloric intake is better used elsewhere!

I made this for my bookclub the other night, and everyone went crazy for it. My husband, 11 year old son, and his friend devoured the leftovers. That night, my son's friend's mother called to get the recipe--he begged her to make it as well. Couldn't be easier! A couple notes--I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract in addition to the vanilla. Also, next time I make, might try cutting butter back by 2 tablespoons.

This was very good, but so rich. The flavor wasn't very complex, it just tasted like fat and sugar to me. I got compliments on it at a party, but personally this wasn't my favorite. I think that maybe it needs something else, like blueberries in the cheesecake part, maybe. Also it is not elegant, and is actually a rather "ugly" dessert, which is a big problem for me.

This is great! I cut the recipe in half - I only needed one roll of the cresent dough roll that comes in sheets. One sheet was enough for the bottom and top layer. Cutting the filling and topping in half worked perfect and I was able to make it all in a 9 in pie pan. I will be making this one again soon!

OMG!!!!   this is to die for!  And one of the easiest desserts to make.  I used the crescent roll sheets by Pillsbury, which are a wonderful product.  No pressing the crescent rolls together - just roll out the single rectangular sheet and press it to the edges of the baking dish.  Very flaky and tender.   Use real butter, for best flavor.  I added extra cinnamon to the topping.  I skipped the honey on top as per other reviewers, and I'm glad I did - it was very sweet and rich and would have been excessively so with the honey.  I also followed the advice of others and made it the day before, refrigerated overnight, and it cut easily and was perfectly flavored.  Everybody raved about this recipe and I will definitely make it again!  I intend to make a vegan version for my sister, with soy cream cheese and dairy-free margerine.  This is a ten star recipe, not five!

Made this for Bunko last night and all the girls were in Heaven!  They compared it to creme brulee!  I might do the thicker crescent rolls next time as the one reviewer suggested - too much filling for my particular tastes.   I must say, this was the quickest and easiest recipe I've ever made, but everyone thinks you spent all day on it!  You can't go wrong with this recipe!!!  *We had it as leftovers straight out of the fridge tonight.  The sugar was still crunchy and the filling was firm!  I think it was even better cold!

I have to admit that I didn't think this would be very good based on the ingredients but I was assigned dessert on a Mexican dinner party so I gave it a shot.  Wow is it good!  As a HUGE chocolate fan, I'm surprised to say that this is my new "go-to" dessert.  Wonderful & easy.  I couldn't find the mexican vanilla but I just used really good quality pure vanilla extract and it turned out great.  Didn't modify the recipe a bit!  ***REVISION*** I cooked it for 45 minutes.

I made this for a mexican themed party and everyone loved it.  As someone else suggested I used 3pkgs of cream cheese to make the filling a little thicker so I had to bake it about 40 minutes. Great recipe. I will definately make it again.

this was amazing. i understand that everyone raves this recipe but i was still a little iffy about it because im not a big fan of cheescake or cinnamon. but it was truely fantastic. it is even better if u let it cool for a long time. for us that was overnight. it being in the fridge for only a few hours wont get the cheescake part hard enough. it was a little sweet for me, not my boyfriend though, so you could cut down on the sugar in some places. also seriously so easy to make! like ridicoulsly easy. and i just put the rolls down and didnt' press or anything and it came out good. so wonderful recipe and please try! i had to literally hide it from my boyfriend he was getting sick eating to much of it. very good recipe for a big group like pot luck or something,

Wow! So easy, so delicious! Instead of mixing the butter with sugar and cinnamon, I melted it and brushed the top before sprinkling cinnamon/sugar mixture. I didn't even use all the cinnamon/sugar mixture. The crescent roll dough wasn't as easy to work with as I thought it was going to be, but it didn't matter, since you'd never notice once it bakes up. I do like essayjay's idea of rolling it out on wax paper to lay the top portion down over the cream cheese, will try next time.

Wow, this is a fabulous recipe!  I tried it yesterday, and not only was it super easy, but delicious warm or cold.  The only thing I changed, as I am not a fan of honey, is drizzle carmel sauce over it as it came out of the oven.  Kudo's to CandelB for this recipe!

Wow!  This is awesome.  I didn't roll out the crescent rolls - I just mashed the seams together.  It was very quick and easy to make and smelled heavenly while baking.  As others suggested, I baked about 40 minutes and it was perfection.  I couldn't wait until it cooled completely to try it.  It was great and I didn't change a thing except the baking time.  This will definitely be made the next time I entertain.

My husband is even more in love with me now!  :)  He said this is the BEST dessert I've ever made.  I par-baked the bottom crust for about 7 minutes while I diced some fresh peaches to add on top of the cream cheese mixture.  Rolling out the biscuits was easy once I realized I could roll them out into smaller rectangles and lay them (like lasagna noodles). Mmmmmmmmm

This is insanely delicious. I've been making crescent roll cheesecake for years, but this version is different from mine and SO GOOD. I only did a couple of things different. I did not have mexican vanilla, so I used regular. I did not use a rolling pin, as I never do when I make my version of this and have never had a problem. I melted the butter, cinnamon and sugar all together, then poured it on top. This gave it a delicious, candied topping. Also, I forgot to drizzle the honey on top before baking, so I just let everyone drizzle their own honey on top of their piece. I will make this many, many times!

This was a delicious and different dessert. Like others, I cut the sugar in the cream cheese and the topping, as well as the butter. (I Used margarine.)I also used low fat cheese and low fat crescent and no honey. My family loved it.

This was SO easy to make and came out really delicious.  My husband, who generally doesn't like sweets, couldn'ty get enough of this.  FYI - they now make the crescent roll dough in an already rolled out sheets to make preparing this even easier.

I took this recipe to a Cinco de Mayo party, and it was the first to disappear.  They are pretty decadent so I cut them into little cheese cake bites, so they were the perfect size.  I made the recipe as stated except for reducing the sugar on top to 1/2 cup.  Next time I make this I will cook it for a little bit longer than 30 minutes for the filling to really be set, and will refrigerate it much longer before serving.  Thanks for the great recipe that I will definitely be making again!

I made this last week for Bunco night and it was a HUGE HIT!!! I went with a reviewers suggestion and used 1/2 cup of sugar for the Topping. 3/4 c. would have been way to sweet. I used 1/2 stick of butter for the topping instead of a whole stick (too too much).  I also added some flour so it would be a little more like a crumb cake for the topping (1/4 cup maybe, if you've ever made a crumb cake topping you know the consistency, I highly recommend this option, otherwise the butter melts in and you've got pure sugar on top).  I am going to make it next time with 3/4 c. of sugar for the filling. I thought it was too sweet. Otherwise Awesome recipe. Its so so easy to make and quick.

I made this for a dinner with my in-laws and everyone loved it.  I didn't know if it was 5-star worthy (maybe 4 1/2) - but the others were really raving about it.  I used reduced fat crescent rolls and 1/3 less fat cream cheese and they turned out great.  I also reduced the sugar as suggested by others.  I used 3/4 cup in the filling and 1/2 cup over the top. I have a huge sweet tooth and probably would have been fine with the amount in the original recipe - but they were plenty sweet.  I did cook it a little longer - maybe 5 minutes.  Rather than dolloping the butter on top before baking, I spread it out.  When I took it out of the oven, the butter was pooling a bit but by the time it cooled it was fine.  They are equally good after being refrigerator (I think I may prefer them that way!).

This was absolutely divine! I used reduced fat cream cheese and crescent rolls. Next time I'll reduce the butter to 1/4 cup - it really doesn't need a full stick.  This was the perfect ending to my Mexican dinner party.

I thought this was okay. If I make it again, I will def cut back on the butter in the topping. It made my crescent dough kinda soggy and I was hoping for something a little crisper. I will also cut back on the sugar that was in the topping... seemed a bit too much. I tossed in some chopped pecans with the topping and I thought it was a nice addition. It had a good flavor but I thought it was just average, nothing specatacular...

Awesome, simple and affordable.  I followed this recipe exactly except that I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan.  I also used lowfat crescents and cream cheese and they were still awesome.  I didn't think they were done when I took them out because the butter/sugar mixture was really wet looking.  But it dries up into a delicious crispy top.  I will make these again and again.  Thanks.

This recipe is incredibly tasty and so easy! It’s great for any time of the year and for any occasion. I’ve been making these off and on since 1997 but had lost my recipe. I was so tickled a few years ago when I found this one because it’s pretty darn close to my original I don’t even know the difference anymore. Lol!

I have made this several times, recently I stated adding an egg to the cream cheese & sugar. I also just experimented and added some triple berry pie filling on top of the cream cheese mixture, then the top layer of crescents. Came out great!

This turned out delicious! I read some reviews and took the advice to add an egg to the batter. And I also reduced the sugar to the 3/4 cup when mixed with the cream cheese as some reviews said it was too sweet with 1 cup. 
I also coated the bottom layer of the baking dish with a sugar/cinnamon mix. Got tons of compliments and requests for the recipe.

With all the incredible reviews what more do I say. 
This is a fan favorite for family l, friends and functions! I get asked to make it or asked for the recipe all the time.
I make it as is, but I mix the topping (butter, sugar & cinnamon) and spread it evenly over the top. You really don't need the honey on top, so if you don't  have any on hand don't fret. 
I will say it is very sweet and I do have a sweet tooth so 1 piece is plenty. 
I've been told it taste like the best parts of a cinnabon cinnamon bun; with the sugary goodness and the cream cheese icing. 
Enjoy, you won't regret trying this one!

I made this exactly as directed! It came out perfect. I did cook it for 35 minutes. My husband is on his second piece already! He loved it. It really is quite delicious and I would definitely make again and also for company or as a dish to take to someone’s home! Also very easy to put together. Thanks so much!

This is the 3rd time I have made these and the 3rd time I have received OMG-THIS IS THE BEST EVER results from co-workers. The past two times I have made the recipe as described, but this time I tripled the batch and forgot to put in a half a cup of sugar in the buttery cinnamon topping. It was totally fine though, I truly couldn't tell the difference. I did do one other small change and put in vanilla bean paste instead of the vanilla extract (simply because I ran out of the other) into the cream cheese mixture and oh my gosh it tasted better. The flavor was more pronounced. I never leave work with anything left. Thank goodness I have some stashed at home that wouldn't fit on my cake plate. :-)

Big hit at my Mexican themed bookclub dinner.  I made a practice one in advance and mistakenly added the honey before I baked it, was still good but better when added after baking.  I also refrigerated it the first time, the filling ended up turning gummy.  I don't know if that's because I cooked too long or refrigeration.  2nd one turned out much better.  Both times I added the extra cream cheese.  Doesn't keep well for more than a few days.

Great recipe!!  I did not have the problem of butter pooling on the top and I used the full stick of butter.  Also, it was perfectly cooked at 30 minutes.  I left it in for 7 extra minutes because so many people said it was under cooked and I wish I hadn't done that.  I used a 1/4 cup less sugar for each of the filling and topping and only used 1T of honey on top.  Next time I will use more honey but I think 1/4 c would be way too sweet.

My easy go to dessert. I don’t use the honey as I don’t think it’s necessary and I cook it until the puddles of butter disappear, probably about 40 minutes. The recipe may have an error on the cook time.

Everyone raved and thought I had slaved over this dessert when in reality it was probably the easiest dessert I have ever made! I followed the recipe exactly as directed except I added a half of a tsp more cinnamon.

Top 3 desserts I’ve made from recipes on AR, easily.  Really, really good ratio of time spent to make vs outcome.

Tremendous recipe! The dish cane out beautifully. 
So easy to put together that I thought I missed a few steps!
It tastes like it was a more involved and complex dessert make.
I will definitely be making it again.

I used 3 packages of Neufchâtel with only 1/2 cup sugar in it plus vanilla for the filling.  Also, I only drizzled 1/8 cup of honey on the top.  Would be even better served cold, or warm with either cool whip, whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

Absolutely a hit for Cinco de Mayo.  Very easy to make and the recipe is easy to remember.   I was asked for it several times. Yes, the butter did collect on the top, but I was able to reposition it before cooling.  I, also, placed the cooled dish in the refrigerator for a short time before serving.  I had no problem with the cheese filling staying with each cut piece.

I followed the recipe to the tee...it came out beautiful!  I baked mine or maybe 45 minutes instead of the 30.  
In my opinion...there is NOT enough cinnamon in this!  I would add another teaspoon or so.  Then I also decided to make a mixture of melted butter, cinnamon and sugar and drizzle it over each piece when you serve.  It really is tasty, though.

I did what others said and pre-baked with the bottom crust for about 6 min. Added one more block of cream cheese and cut the toping mix by half.  Also, I cut mine into more like bite-size squares.  People really like it.

If I could give this 6 stars I would. Hands down my husband’s favorite dessert and the one I am requested to make the most from my friends. And it’s super easy. Make life easier and get the non perforated crescent rolls. Also, after cooking it will look like it’s not set because of the delicious amount of butter on top. It will set. Just have to make ahead of time and put in fridge.

This recipe is so versatile. Loved it following the recipe but also adding any type of pie filling as a thin layer on top of the cream cheese. Plus delicious with some slivered almonds sprinkled on top.

I’ve never written a review on here, but I felt inclined to do so with this recipe. I made it exactly as instructed, it was the easiest dessert I’ve ever made and it was fantastic. I think this took me all of about 10 minutes to put together. The best part is, I made it 2 days ago and my husband is still talking about it. However he refuses to call it by its name, he’s calling it flattened out cinnamon buns with the icing in the middle. Lol. Anyways he loved them!

SO easy...SO good...;)  The only hard part was waiting for it to cool...;)  
I followed the recipe to the letter.  I have to make another one this week but I am going to change it just for kicks and giggles and add a little lemon juice or zest to the cream cheese part.
This should be everyones  GOTO menu for when you need a quick dessert!!!

If you can make a box of mac & cheese you can make this. If you want something that doesn’t require a lot of time or effort you can make this. If you want something to add a little of your own pizzazz you should make this.                Everyone can try something different with this and it makes them look like a wonderful baker.

Amazing, the only thing I do different is I add extra Mexican vanilla and sprinkle cinnamon/sugar mix on top and pour butter on top of the mix. Rave reviews!

I've made a lot of desserts in my life but I have never had so many compliments then I had about this dessert.  I made for a large get together and everyone  devoured it and kept coming back for more.  I had to make sure I got a piece of it before it was gone. I am not a huge cream cheese fan and I loved this recipe.  I making for Thanksgiving dinner by request.  So happy I found this recipe.

I love anything that involves cream cheese!! This recipe was extremely simple and they it came out great. I cut back on the sugar by a quarter and added didn't measure the honey just drizzled the top to my liking. Next time I may do a double layer of crescent on the bottom just to see how that turns out.

I've made this many times as directed and with alterations. My favorite alteration is to pour a can of apple or cherry pie filling over the top of the cheesecake filling then top with crescent dough. Quick, easy, always a hit!

This is sooooo soooo good. Actually I thought it was better the day after I made it. I put 2 teaspoons of cinnamon in the topping & I might tweak the sugar/ cinnamon a little. I also think I'll add one more cream cheese to the filling. These were all suggestions from other reviews.  You can not go wrong on this!  yummy! Oh! Also.. I used regular vanilla, have not found the Mexican vanilla yet & did not use any honey.

Do not be intimidated by the rolling of the crescent roll dough. It's very forgiving. I followed this recipe exactly. Cooking it in a very-well preheated 350 degree oven, this took exactly 57 minutes to cook. Awesome!!!!

I gave this 5 stars, even though I didn't eat it. Why didn't I eat it? Because I thought fighting all of my neighbors for a piece would be rude. I'm not kidding... I literally had neighbors FIGHTING over it. One neighbor was trying to tell everyone else it was awful so he could have it all for himself. One grabbed a piece from another neighbor and ran away with it... she's in her 60s. This recipe MUST be good if it turns everyone into savages lol!!

I've been making this on every occasions the only thing I change is I used half a cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup on top. You can also used half a cup of sugar to mixed with cream cheese to make it less sweeter .

I used a sheet of crescent dough, so no seams to worry about.  Baked in a glass dish.  I thought the dough was rather bland, not crisp, and the cream cheese mixture was mediocre.  My husband and I each had one piece and that was enough.

I thought this was very good.  It makes a lot and is very rich. I cut the recipe in half.  I felt the recipe is good as it stands. There was plenty of cream cheese ratio to dough.  It is very rich and sweet but tasty.

Made half an order(halved the recipe) for the two of us. We almost finished the entire thing. It was delicious, easy, and quick! Can't go wrong.

All the rave reviews are correct.  I don't use a rolling pen as it does not seem to be necessary - just spread out a little.  I put the first layer of crescent rolls in the oven for about five minutes and that seals the seam quite well.  I don't  measure the honey, but just drizzle all around the top.  This will hit a home-run for you!

Didn't make any changes. I don't typically like dishes that use
pre-packaged dough in a can....but these bars are delicious!!

Very easy and tasty. I did cut back on the sugar and added an egg to the cream cheese as others have suggested. Brushed the butter on lightly, so had no puddles. Drizzled a bit of honey when it came out of the oven. Delish.  Almonds on top would go nicely with the honey. Fruit could also go well on the side.

Our new favorite dessert for a crowd!  Followed advice of reviewer and cut back on both additions of sugar and did not use honey.  But make it easier on yourself:  Recipe calls for refrigerated crescent ROLLS.  Buy crescent DOUGH!  A sheet is actually very close to  size of 9X13 pan.  Best if you don't pile up extra dough on edges - remove or reshape.  But this is a real KEEPER!

I followed a lot of the suggestions mentioned by other reviewers.  

Prebake bottom crust for 6 minutes, 3/4 cups sugar in filling, 1/3 sugar in topping, butter brushed on, and just a light drizzle of honey.  With these changes the recipe was absolutely delicious, and I will make it the same way again.  Any more sugar or butter would have been too much for me.

I only had half the ingredients on hand, so I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 glass dish at the same temp for the same time.  It turned out perfectly.  This is easily one of the best recipes on this site.  The taste reminds me of a Cinnabon, so very good.

Although I made the recipe, reducing sugar amounts in cream cheese filling and topping, reducing butter amount, and just lightly drizzling on some honey, it was too sweet and rich for my taste.

I loved it, I did change a few things the second time I made it. I used the crescent roll sheets, I also melted the butter (I used less the 1/2 cup) poured it on top and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on top. Made it a bit easier.

After people at work started arguing over these, my husband offered to build a fighting pit.  We could put the tray of these in the center and sell tickets for charity as people fought for the pan. The recipe I use calls for 1 egg with the cheese and no honey, but I don't think there's a way this wouldn't be remarkable with any variation.  Seriously, try this.

Almost perfect recipe. The one and only thing I would change is reducing the amount of butter to 1/4 cup or less, otherwise the top doesn't crisp and leaves it soggy.

This is a very sweet dessert. I would cut in half the sugary butter topping. The top was very soggy with butter and sugar. The cream cheese center is fine.

WOW... was I ever surprised to run into this recipe and love it. My husband LOVES it. He claims to be a not picky eater. Yeah right! Anyhow, I will surely make this again many times. I made as recipe directed, but I felt I had to dab the top with paper towel when it came out of the oven to absorb some of the butter puddles, then I drizzled some honey on top , put in fridge a few hours & it's done.
Thank you for a simple and delicious recipe.

This is delicious and a huge hit at any gathering. I use the crescent roll dough that comes in sheets, which is a lot easier to work with than regular crescent roll dough.

Very good and very easy.  Like others said, cut down on the sugar for cream cheese mix and topping. (3/4 c with cheese, 1/2 for topping) no honey needed.  We liked it warm and cold!

I was so excited to try this recipe after seeing it in the Better Homes and Gardens magazine...but I was somewhat disappointed. However I will try it again sometime but with a few changes. The cream cheese mixture was a bit too sweet for my taste, so I will cut the sugar back to about 3/4 cup. Also there was WAY too much butter and sugar on top...so much butter pooled on top that I had to cook it longer than the 30 minutes listed! The butter pooling on top caused the top layer of crescent dough not to cook...I had to spoon some of it off the top and return it back to the oven for an additional 25 minutes! So next time I think I will oh use half the amount of listed butter and sugar. But experimenting is always part of the fun when baking new things! Definitely worth a try though!

Great recipe.  I was looking for a Mexican dessert for an impromptu Mexican dinner at my house. I had the ingredients for the recipe on hand, it was easy/quick to fix and the outcome was a hit with my dinner guests.

Overall, my boyfriend and I both really liked this desert. I did change a few things per the reviews of others. I cooked it in an 8x8 dish and the cream cheese layer was still on the thin side. An extra 8 oz cream cheese definitely wouldn't hurt. Changes: precooked the bottom layer of dough for 5 minutes, halved the sugar in both the topping and inside mixture, added half brown sugar in the topping, and halved the butter in the topping as well. It came out with the exact amount of sweetness that I was looking for. Will definitely make again!

I took it to a get together where we had a taco bar and everyone loved this dessert! There were several other desserts and the entire sopapilla was eaten. My husband has requested that I make this one often. I went exactly by the recipe other than I didn't have Mexican vanilla so I just used pure vanilla extract.

I made it in a 9x13 pan. I made it with regular vanilla since I couldn't find regular vanilla and it came out EXCELLENT! I heavily reccommend. I left the party with very little left.

My husband doesn't cook nor does he know how to cook. He made this for me as part of our anniversary dinner and it was arguably the best thing I have ever eaten. Do yourself a favor and make this. You'll thank me later.

I am giving this 4 stars because I modified it the second time I made it to cut down on the sweetness. I cut the sugar in the topping to 1/4 cup, 1/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of honey. This was plenty enough for the topping and the dessert was still very sweet and rich. Still a little too sweet for our tastes, so the next time I think I will cut the sugar in the cream cheese mixture in half and I think it will be perfect. We love this dessert. Just took to a potluck and got alot of compliments. Thanks for submitting this recipe OP. :) 
 *I think this dessert is better when it is chilled overnight.

This was amazing. After reading reviews, I added another brick of cream cheese and halved the sugar topping. I also added an egg to the filling. In the future, I would also decrease the sugar in the filling as it is still really sweet (and believe me, I LOVE sweet), even though I added more cream cheese.

Great recipe! I used 3 blocks of cream cheese and I only used 3/4 cup sugar to the mix. Also added 1/4tsp of Almond Extract along with the Vanilla. I did not roll out the dough, used pinched the seams together.  Then I brushed the top pastry layer with completely melted butter (only 1/4th of butter substitute) and then sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture evenly across (I only used 1/2 cup of sugar on top). Baking time was about 30 minutes. I let refrigerate over night and then cut in the morning. I had honey out for folks to add as they wished, but it was perfect without any honey.  Next time I would like to incorporate the lemon zest others have added.

This dessert is so delicious and so easy to make. I did use 3 bricks of cream cheese and only used 1/2 cup of sugar on the topping. I melted  the butter and brushed it on the top but did not use the entire stick of butter. It was so delicious! Will definitely be making this again! Thanks so much for sharing, CandelB!

I made this as the recipe calls for except for just lowering the sugar a little bit in the cream cheese mixture and the topping. My wife said this is now one of her favorite desserts that I have made !

The leftovers the next morning are even better! Cut down on the sugar and added juice of half a lemon, which made it really fresh. Don't care for the honey and didn't use it; as a result it wasn't over sweet but just a delight.

Wow. This was as easy to make and delicious to eat as everyone says. I did follow another reviewer's suggestion of just placing the dough in the pan and smoothing out the breaks, skipping the rolling. It was gone fast!

OMG! This is awesome! The house smells wonderful while you're baking this wonderful dessert. The only thing that I added that was slightly different was 1/4tsp of Almond Extract along with the Vanilla and it really is truly scrumptious.It's so easy to make, don't know where it's been all my life!

After reading a lot of the recipes I changed it to fit the consensus. I used 2 and 3/4 bricks of cream cheese, and added only 3/4 C sugar and 2 tsp vanilla. (it was just the right sweetness) For the bottom crust, I just rolled the crescent roll right in the pan and pressed together, and then baked 6 minutes. I just put the rolled out 2nd crust right on top. Very easy. For the topping I only used 1/2 C sugar, and after blending it with cin & butter, I put in freezer for a few minutes to get it crumbly. I had no pools of butter when it cooked for 40 minutes. I warmed the honey and then drizzled it on top. Then toasted some pecan pieces and sprinkled them over the honey. It turned out great, and loved it!! So did the whole family.

Made it last night for a party.Absolutely DELICIOUS! !!
I blended in half a can of apple pie filling into the cream cheese and drizzled caramel over the top instead of honey. Every one raved about how good it was. Will make it over and over again. And it is sooo simple to make.

I used 1/3 c less sugar in the cheesecake and 1/4 c less on the butter mixture. I might halve the butter next time because it seemed a little oily. Equally good hot or cold.

I have made this several times, always a HUGE hit. Everyone asks me to bring them to every event. I make everything as is, except I melt the butter completely for the topping before I mix in sugar etc.,  then just spread it over the top. Turns out amazing every time!

I've made this recipe three times, and each time it gets rave reviews.  Delicious, fairly easy to put together, but people think it must have been difficult.  I scale back on the butter and sugar on top of the pastry (1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter)and it is perfect.

I (tried to)follow this recipe exactly and it was awesome! Actually, I forgot the honey and it was still fantastic. I also used regular vanilla, because I could  not find Mexican vanilla. I brought it to a Mexican themed potluck and it went fast, everyone loved it and wanted more. We topped it with whipped cream, ice cream would have gone well, too. I will make it again and try it with the honey.

I loved this recipe, and I don't understand the negative reviews. I don't have what I would consider a sweet tooth, but I didn't find it too sweet or sugary in any way. Maybe some of the contributors didn't bake it enough? I did think the portions called for in the recipe were a little large, considering the ingredients. I also thought the recipe made too much, so I cut it in half. I used a 9" x 9" Pyrex dish that I had lightly buttered and pressed half the dough triangles into it. Then I spread the cream cheese mixture over that and placed the other dough triangles (that I had pressed into a square on a cutting board) on top. For the topping, I used brown sugar instead of white. I baked it for 35 minutes, and I think another 3-5 minutes would have made it even better. I drizzled the honey on top immediately after I took it out of the oven and let it cool for 30 minutes. I cut it into 9 pieces, and enjoyed a piece. It's all I can do not to eat another piece right now. This recipe is definitely a winner!

I made this for a pot luck, and other than the inherent messiness of crescent roll perforated dough (my local store doesn't carry the seamless sheets, sadly), this was way more delicious than I thought possible with the pre-made dough. It was a total hit with the party-goers, so much so that I never took a photo. 

The honey is the bit that seals it as a sopapilla-inspired dish. I believe a smidgen of honey drizzled under the served slices would enhance it more than the drizzle on top. Still, undeniably a hit and well worth the time.

Everyone who tried this said that it was the best, and my mom, who has never liked cheesecake, said that she could eat it this way. Very, Very good.

I used reduced fat cream cheese and half as much butter and it still was a huge hit among some very picky eaters.

thanks for posting

Oh my, this is delicious. Had a Mexican theme gathering for my gym friends who NEVER eat dessert. They each wanted just a bite but no one can stop at one. Good thing we are such good friends because we ate this right out of the pan! Thanks for another wonderful recipe.

I made this for our church couples ministry.  I had limited time before the meeting started, but with the help of two others we pulled it off.  I must say it was the hit of the event.

Great quick dessert.  My husband thought this was the best dessert I have ever made.  It was quick and easy and Delicious! I added a little more sugar because he likes things sweet. I also had 
a can of Dulce de Leche  around and thought if I added this it would make it a little more Mexican.  I couldn't decide if I should add it on top of the cream cheese mixture or on the top of the cake after baking.  I decided on top of the cream cheese and bake it in.  I only used half a can so it was a thin layer.  I couldn't taste it but my husband did and said it was great!  I think next time I may add the whole can if I have it in the house.  Otherwise I will just use the cream cheese.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good. I did leave the honey off and served it on the side for people to drizzle on if they wanted it. I loved them without it. This is such an easy recipe to make for as good as it is. I put in double the cinnamon since we love cinnamon.

Quite possibly one of the best deserts I've made by far! You probably gain a pound just by looking at it but it was delicious and so easy to make. Definitely will make again.

I've made this recipe dozens of times and it receives rave reviews. The only thing I do differently is I don't roll out the dough, but simply press it into the pan. This is easy to make and is a real crowd pleaser.

This was pretty good and very easy. I followed the recipe exactly. It was not done in 30 min so I did leave it in for 10 more. I will make again but next time I will use 3 packages of cream cheese and 1 1/2 cups sugar as others have suggested.

Good, but VERY rich.  Made this for family visiting from out-of-town, and they all said they enjoyed it, but I personally couldn't eat more than a few bites.  Too sweet and heavy for my tastes.

this is pretty yummy...I do however agree that you should cut back on the butter. I made it per the recipe but if I make it again I think I will use 1/2 the butter. I see some folks added extra filling which I  don't agree with. There is plenty as is. I do however think adding a fruit layer or lemon curd on top of the cheese layer would be a yummy addition. This reminds me of a cheese danish.

I brought this a Fiesta yesterday and people LOVED it! I made only a couple of modifications based on other feedback. I used 3 boxes of cream cheese and cut the sugar in the mix down to 1 1/2 cups and the sugar for the top to 1/2 cup. I could probably even cut that back more as I had plenty left over. I also brushed the butter on the top layer of crescent rolls so could cut back on the butter next time as well. It's day 2 and still tastes amazing!

This was so good. I cut down on the sugar from a cup to 1/2 cup. I added a blueberry pie filling on top of the cream cheese. I had to bake it a bit longer but it was so worth it!

I didn't need the full recipe so reduced to serving 6 and used an 8 x 8 pan. Didn't need to bother with the rolling pin - just tolled out the crescent roll package, split in half and stretched it out a bit to cover the bottom of the pan. There were 3 of us for supper and only a wee bit leftover. Super easy and delicious !

After watching the video and reading alot of reviews, I decided to go for it. I did exactly as the recipe stated with the exception of using regular vanilla because I couldn't find Mexican. The prep took a little longer because I have no hand mixer and just mixed everything really good with a big metal spoon. I didn't need a rolling pin for the crescent roll sheets either. For the honey, I didn't measure it, I just drizzled it out of the honey bear. All in all, simple to put together and tastes delicious! It wasn't too sweet like some reviews stated, and I also didn't have an issue with butter pooling up on top around the sugar mixture like others did. I will definitly share this with friends and make again just as it is.

I made this for my family last night and my hard to please brother said it was the best thing he's ever had. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and cut back on the butter in the topping to 2/3 a cup but next time I would reduce the sugar a bit too. I also didn't have Mexican vanilla so I used regular vanilla extract and it was still delish. I will absolutely make this again. Everyone loved it.

WOW!!!  This was DELICIOUS!!  My family loved it and wanted more!  It is a bit sweet but oh soooo good.  I did only use 1/2 cup of sugar for the topping and was still plenty sweet. Thank you CandelB!!

I just made this for the first time. At first I was doubtful (it took about 20 minutes longer in the oven than the recipe stated). But the key seems to have been to let it sit for a couple of hours. Wow--decadent! It even forms a bit of a brulee crust with the butter and sugar. Definitely a recipe to keep and indulge in once a year!

I tried this 2 years ago, followed the recipe exactly as it is and it became our family favorite dessert.
Since I make it every time for parties it became my friends favorite also. Everybody loves it and craves for it. Especially the kids:)
I usually make it evenings so by the next morning it will be cooled and ready to eat.
Even taste better 2 days after that...if it last:)
I cut it on small rhombus bite size shapes...

I have made this recipe for over 3 years now and it is always a hit! Agree that the sugar is a bit too much and swap it out with 1/2 cup of agave. Also prefer to cut the amount of butter, so I melt 1-2 tablespoons and coat it onto the top layer of dough. Then I sprinkle cinnamon sugar lightly on top, usually about 2 tablespoons total, just enough to leave a light brown dusting. And lastly I do sparingly drizzle honey on top when it comes out of the oven *at 30 minutes NOT 45. This is one of the best quick, easy and very much appreciated dessert!

I really loved this and so did my family. I made this twice! for Thanksgiving since I go to my parents and then my in laws. At my parents I made it as stated in the recipe although I did add 3 cream cheese bars as suggested by reviewers and I also baked the first layer of dough for a few minutes. I melted the butter for the topping and mixed it with the sugar and cinnamon. This made it spreadable over the top layer, it came out wonderful. Everyone kept asking what it was and how I made it. For my in laws I made a sugar free version since my m-i-l is diabetic. I simply added splenda to the cream cheese instead of sugar and for the top layer I only coated it with a bit of melted butter and then sprinkled cinnamon all over, no sugar that also was very tasty, everyone ate it even the kids. I only feel that the cream cheese is a bit mushy although no one seemed to mind or notice but I almost want some cheesecake consistency to it, wondering if adding and egg would help? I might mess with that a lil bit ;)

YUM!!!!  This is fantastic!  The only thing I did differently was I made my own crescent roll dough from scratch.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I tried it hot out of the oven- delicious!  I tried it cooled to room temperature- amazing!  I tried it after it had been in the fridge overnight- scrumptiously delightful!  I would not change a single thing about this recipe (although I do recommend making your own dough- much better than store-bought :) )  This is a MUST try!!!  Thank you CandelB- this is totally awesome :)

This was good. We enjoyed it for a Mexican potluck. It still tasted of canned crescent rolls, so you can't get away from that. I liked the treat better the next day as the layers melded together. I would make it again.

Followed the recipe, turns out great and is very simple! I received lots of compliments. I put flour down when I rolled out the dough to avoid it sticking to the counter.

Awesome, but I tried to rush the cooling process by removing it from the pan without loosening both sides...thank goodness you cut it into squares to serve! I cut it into 2"x2" squares. It is so rich, I couldn't imagine eating a whole suggested serving, which would be 3"x4". Also, like other reviewers, I baked mine for closer to 40 minutes than 30. Have some coffee, tea, or milk on hand for sure as well. Definitely a keeper, but don't rush the cooling.

This recipe is fantastic!  I stuck pretty close to the original recipe, however after reading a few reviews, I did cut down on the sugar in the cream cheese mixture (to taste), since I like cheesecake a little less sweet.  I used the pillsbury sheets (without seams) and it worked great.  I also reduced the amount of sugar and butter on the top layer in half.  I softened the butter and spread it across the top, then sprinkled the sugar and cinnamon on top of the butter.  The best part is the honey, so don't skimp here!  If the dessert seems too sweet, cut back the sugar in the rest of the recipe and keep the honey!!! Awesome recipe and can be served warm or chilled.

This honestly was about the best thing I ever tasted. I followed the recipe exactly with just adding one more teaspoon of cinnamon. I make it for Bunco and it was a huge hit.

I have been using a little different version for this dessert, and decided to try this recipe for a change.  I found the amount of butter and cinnamon/sugar added on the top of this pastry was significantly more than needed.  I'll continue to use my original recipe  which uses 2 T melted butter brushed over the top rather than an entire stick of butter and approximately 2-3 T of cinnamon/sugar sprinkled over the butter. I also add 1/2 t of almond extract and 2 T of plain yogurt to the cream cheese mixture.  This recipe does lend itself to many additions, though.  I've mixed mini-chocolate chips into the cheese mixture and added chopped pecans on the top, and you can also make it more like a danish by piping white icing over top of the cinnamon crust.  Any way you make it, it's a tasty morsel!

This dessert is wonderful. I took it to a potluck and had several ask me for the recipe even though it didn't seem to be quite set. Next time I will chill it before serving. Much better (if that's possible!)

When I chose to make this dessert I was a bit skeptical but I truly wanted a dessert that was centered around the "Mexican" theme.  I made this for our Mexican Sunday School Connect Group and it was a big hit!  In fact, the men and children ate so much that many of the women had just enough for a bite so they could taste it.  I literally had ONE bite just to see if it was good or if they were just being polite--it was a keeper.  I have been asked to make it again so the ladies can have some next time.  Changes:  I did use regular vanilla extract and cooked 5 minutes less.  I also drizzled more honey on it.

Made this recipe to take to a Mexican food potluck. I doubled it so I'd have 24 squares to share. I didn't have Mexican vanilla, so used regular with good results. Super easy to make. Was doubtful about how the crescent roll dough would taste as a dessert but it turns out fantastic. Tastes kind of like a donut with that nice crispness and the inside is heaven. Let's just say they disappeared quickly and I heard moans of ecstasy from those eating these...really! Several people asked for this recipe so will be sharing and adding this to 'make again' recipe book.

Great recipe, easy and cheap to make and a crowd pleaser. Brought this to a party and everyone was fighting over the last pieces. The only change I make is 1/2 a cup of sugar for the cinnamon mix you place on top bc 3/4 is too sweet for my taste. Another bonus about this dessert is it tastes even better the next day after it has been in the fridge a few hours so the left overs are great.

This recipe did not disappoint!  I took this to a Father's Day BBQ and everyone raved about these.  I increased the cream cheese to 3 packages and cut WAY down on the butter...just brushed it over the top and probably only used 2 tbsp.  Served refigerated the day after I made them and they were amazing!

I made this for a church gathering. There was a very picky eater there that does not like anything that has premade ingrediants in it such as croissants from a tube. Well she even LOVED IT!!!! I was told when i make this again to bring more than one pan. I think i will try adding fresh BLUEBERRIES to the mix and cutting down on butter. It did pool on top .

This stuff is off the hook. It makes me look good when I contribute this to any food function. Never fails, people always ask for the recipe. My only tip is to use small dollops of the butter mixture all over the top layer as opposed to larger dollops here and there. Also freezes incredibly well! Love it!!! Thank you!

Made this for my Daughter's 30th Birthday.  She and all of her guests called this "crack-cheesecake" because it's almost addictive.  I added 3 packages of cream cheese and beat in one egg as suggested by another reviewer.  This made it decadently creamy.  Also, you can buy a full sheet crescent role which made it super easy.  This is probably one of the best recipes on this site.  Thanks!

The only thing I don't like in this recipe is the crescent rolls.  There is that "processed food aftertaste" which spoils the whole thing. Would much rather have  regular cheesecake which is no more complicated to make than this recipe.

I had a Cinco De Mayo party for 30 people and made the Sopapilla Cheesecake Pie.  At least 20 people asked me for the recipe and everyone raved about it! It was all gone before I even had a chance to try it. Thanks so much for sharing.

Made this for a Cinco de Mayo party and everyone loved it. I did need to refrigerate it before cutting into squares so that the filling did not run out when cut. Leaving to cool on the counter was not enough to set filling.

Yum!!  We loved this.  I scaled it down to 6 servings instead of 12 and used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and reduced fat refrigerated crescent rolls because that is what I had on hand and it was still delicious.  Next time I have to bring a dessert to a party or pot luck I will bring this.  It is a keeper.

This dessert is AWESOME!!!!!  Best I've had in a long time - maybe forever.  I tried it at a wedding shower and had to rush home and figure out what it was.  I could eat so much of this and make myself sick.  OK, enough of that, but you should really try it!!!!!!!!

My Husband loved it!  I didnt have 2 things of cream cheese so I used a 1/2 tub of cool whip and 1 block of cream cheese and it still turned out awesome.  Tonight for my 3rd time making it I am doing the 2 blocks of cream cheese and  I am adding strawberries into the filling. and baking it..it smells wonderful in the house so I cant wait to taste it!  This is my new favorite easy cheesecake recipe!

This was a pretty easy dessert, i made mine in a pie dish, DO NOT DO THIS! LOL You must make this in a square dish and make sure you roll out the crescent prior to topping so there are no holes in the creases. I also did not use the butter on top, it cuts back on the calories and the crescents are already buttery enough i used a cinnamon/sugar mix to top it off with the honey.

My timer fritzed out and even baking almost 10 minutes too long, this still earned RAVE reviews from a big group of foodies. Definitely making it again.

I have to admit that I was completely skeptical about using pre-made crescent dough as a key ingredient, but followed the other reviewers and just tried it.  It was fabulous!!!  Most people had seconds.  It was a bit on the sweet side so I will cut down on the sugar next time, only a bit though.  Otherwise it was a perfect way to end off a Mexican meal!

I'm not a great cook but I took this to a small dinner party and everyone raved!!!  Didn't change a thing.  Even the people "that didn't like sweets" ate two helpings.  Huge hit.  The only bad thing... there wasn't any left for me to munch on later!

Super easy to make and sooooo good! I was going to take a few pieces to work but it disappeared too quick, so I making a whole one to take. Second time around I am decreasing the sugar in the topping to 1/2 cup. And no need to roll out the dough, pinching the seams together worked just fine.

This recipe by far is the best! Simply Fabulous! I have made it so many times, and everyone loves it! It is always just the right amount of what you want....a little bit of dessert [ via cheesecake ] without too much guilt, and too much heaviness that a  cheesecake can sometimes present!

I made this for the first time and was bold enough to take it to a potluck and it was a real hit. I had some left over crescent roll dough in the refrigerator from the week end and so I was able to use that up. I will definitely make this again.

AMAZING! Looks good, tastes great, pretty easy. My only minor complaint is that there isn't a lot of filling. I am making this again soon and will try doubling the filling amount.

This is a winner of a recipe! The use of the honey definitely makes this a 5 star dessert. For the crescent rolls, I used the crescent sheet and made adding the tricky top layer easy. This is a must try!

Everyone loved this, even the hardcore anti-sweet people gave in and took more than one piece!! This is extremely impressive as they can resist absolutely anything else sweet-related. The only downside to this recipe is that it's harder to make than it sounds. Especially rolling out the crescent roll dough. It wouldn't roll out easily so I just patched up the pieces on the top and bottom. It turned out great in the end anyway; it was just troublesome to handle. I also simply put the sugar and cinnamon topping first and melted the butter, drizzled it on top of the cinnamon/sugar and popped it in the oven. I ended up using just 1/2 cup sugar though as 3/4 was a lot (gave about a cm of height as the topping!). Otherwise everything else was amazing!

My boyfriends cousin makes something so similar to this that it's scary. She is known as the incredible baker of the family, and my boyfriend said this is just as good as hers. I love to make this, and I usually have the ingredients on hand so it's great for a last minute gathering of friends!

This dessert was AMAZINGLY EASY, AMAZINGLY TASTY AND AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL! I made it for a taco bar luncheon at work. I got rave reviews and was asked by many for the recipe to which I happily emailed out. This is a great recipe to let children help with they will take great pride in their creation.

I made this a few months ago! I don't know what made me try it, maybe because it was simple and I wanted something sweet. It's hard to believe that you can make a 5 star dessert at home!!! This was amazing. My husband and I ate it cooled down out of the oven, I put it in the fridge to preserve it and I decided to take a bite, and OMG it was even better cold. So PLEASE eat this cold :)

Love love love this recipe! I've made this about 10 times now! The only thing I changed was I bought the sheet dough (pillsbury) and I precooked it until
It was about half way done then added the filling. Finished cooking about 15 more minutes.  I did this bc the first cake I made the dough was kinda "doughy".

Made it for company and it was gone immediately with compliments and requests for recipe.   At first I thought the topping was too buttery as you could see the melted butter after it was done baking.   But it soon turned to a nice, hard, sugary topping.  The topping definitely pushes it over to the sweet side.   I might consider just sprinkling cinnamon sugar on top and omit the butter ... but hey, you only live once so why not enjoy the ride and indulge now and then.

This is SLAP YOUR MOTHER GOOD! I have people requesting this "pie" & every time I make it I'm literally amazed at how good it is! Try it for breakfast!

However, I wish someone would come up with a new name for it. It's not really "pie" & it's not really sopapillas & it's not really cheesecake. lol I like to call it sopapilla casserole in keeping with the warm cinnamony goodness of sopapillas.

Sooooo good. But fair warning, some people might not be able to handle the richness of it. It's really dense and filling, which might be perfect for you if you're into that type of thing! Two possible recommendations for taste: add more cinnamon and less honey.

Very good. I'd say it is a cross between a cheese Danish and a churro with the richness of baklava. The colder it is the better.

So Delicious!  I used reduced fat crescent rolls and reduced fat cream cheese and couldn't tell the difference.

I know this is no where near traditional, but I made it for a Cinco de Mayo party we had and they were gone before I even served the main course (they were sitting on the counter while I was making final preparations for our tacos). Thanks for sharing!

WOW this is great!  I don't have mexican vanilla but I just tried with regular vanilla anyway. I am sure the mexican vanilla would be excellent, but I thought this was worth trying anyway. I omitted the honey, but followed the recipe otherwise. Mine were messy - the butter on top pooled up and saturated the top so I tried cutting it knowing it was too soon but to let the butter drizzle down through it - it helped a little but it stayed messy. I would use less butter next time but the flavor was surprisingly great, everyone enjoyed these.

I made two versions of this, one as shown and the other I substituted lemon for the cinnamon and honey.  I also put fresh grated lemon in the butter topping - marvelous!!!!

Fantastic recipe! I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party at work and everyone went crazy over this stuff. I couldn't believe how stupid easy it is to make. I used cooking spray in the bottom of the cake pans. (I doubled the recipe) In the second pie I added some milk chocolate chips in the batter and the women were ecstatic over it. Many marriage proposals.....Just kidding....I will make this recipe again and again. I may use 3 cream cheese units next time for a little taller filling.

This is wonderful! Everyone loves this dessert. I've made it four times now. I melt the butter and brush it on and I've never used the entire amount of butter, only because after following the recipe exactly the first time I had puddles of butter on top. Delicious & always a crowd pleaser.

Took this to my work for a potluck--it was voted best item at the potluck! I followed the recipe exactly, and yes, the butter looked like too much butter when baking, but as it cooled, it soaked in and was perfect. My husband keeps asking me to make this for HIM instead of my coworkers. I think I'll surprise him with it this weekend.

It was amazing! My husband, who is usually not big on dessert kept walking by the pan and eating a little slice until the whole pan was gone!  I did make this with less butter as suggested by previous reviewers.  I also didn't put the honey on the whole pan, just left it on the side so people could put it on if they pleased.  I thought the honey definitely made this better, but it was great without too.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

This is fantastic!  I cut back on the sugar, using 3/4 cup in the filling and only 1/2 cup for the topping.  Already looking for a reason to make this one again!

I normally only make desserts from scratch, but DH loves sopapillas so I decided to give this a try. I did not alter anything and it turned out PERFECT. It was a little on the sweet side for me, but DH and kids loved it. Super easy recipe to put together. I'm keeping the ingredients on hand for the next time company drops by!

I made this as recipe states, but did not add the honey - it was vey good without the honey! There is no need to fuss with the crescent rolls, they puffed up and joined together as it baked. I baked it as timed and it looked undercooked, but got crispy as it cooled. Everybody asked for more! It was awseome, or as we say in Maine - "It was wicked good!"

OMG amazing! I loved this, my parents loved it, my co-workers and friends loved it.  And there was more than enough to go around (which just means that we all ate more than we should).  Sooo delicious, so simple to make.  I only used about 1/2 a cup of sugar in the filling and 1/4 cup in the glaze, as experience tells me that's usually plenty in a recipe of this sort.  The honey and cinnamon are all the sweetness really needed.  Already planning to make this again this weekend!

I just made this and can't believe how good it is!  It is very simple and I didn't even use the rolling pin to seal edges of the dough, I just carefully spread it out in the pan.  One of the easiest desserts I've ever made!

I was skeptical at first when I saw refrigerated crescent rolls in this recipe.  But, they turned out very good.  The hardest part was waiting for it to cook and cool as the butter and cinnamon topping smelled so good.  The taste of this was well worth the wait!!!  I will make these again.

Very simple to make and very good. A great crowd pleaser. Based on other reviews I decreased the amount of butter. I melted a quarter cup and brushed it on the top. For the top I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar and still didn't use the entire cinnamon sugar mixture. Before serving you can also drizzle some chocolate sauce on top.

Delicious and really easy to make!  I let it bake an extra 5 or 6 minutes just to be sure the dough was baked in the center.  We couldn't even wait for it to cool completely before we ate it.

This was awesome!  I did things a little different.  I melted 1 stick of butter and poured it over the top of the cake and then sprinkled the cinnamon sugar over it so it all came together when it baked.  I also skipped the honey-this was fine without it.  All my guests loved it.

This was so easy and good !! Only change made was using regular vanilla, as I don't have the Mexican. Took about 45 min. to cook in the toaster oven. Great, easy recipe ! Thanks for sharing !!!

This got such good ratings, but I am sorry it wasnt a hit with me.  It wasnt bad it just wasnt awesome.  It reminds me of the cinnamon and cream cheese cookies I cant think of what its called.  Give them a shot you may like them, but we didnt.

Went over really well at work for cinco de mayo.  I did use an extra package of cream cheese and an egg to make the filling thicker.

When I read this recipe, I had to try immediately.  Didn't have the crescent rolls, but I did have 2 roll up pie crusts.  They worked great!  My family loved this.  Can't wait to try again with the crescents!  Thanks!!!

I have made this with a little different amounts on the cream cheese, sugar and cinnamon.  It came out of our fire department fund raiser cookbook.  Great desert!  I haven't tried the honey over top.  I never thought a great thing could get better, but I way wrong.  Try this one, you will not be disappointed.

Very good recipe, I used just regular Vanilla extract and the results were delicious. Made the mistake of putting the cream cheese on top, so I had 2 layers of cream cheese mixture but still turned out wonderful. will make again perhaps in bite size pieces for an upcoming baby shower. Thank you CandelB!

This dessert was fantastic!  I am from NM originally and often miss the flaky, sweet pastry and I LOVE cheesecake.  As soon as I saw this recipe, I had to try it!!  I used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls to try and cut back on calories.  I did use real sugar and though it was pretty sweet, I didn't find it too rich.  I don't know how much it helped to try and cut back on calories because I ended up eating double my serving!  Oops!  Thank you for sharing this goodness!  It was the highlight of my day.

I couldn't find Mexican vanilla extract so I used plain vanilla extract.  Still wonderful!!  So delicious!  Will be cooking this for family dinners from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for Sunday dinner last w'end with my family as well as my in-laws.  For starters, this is a TOUGH crowd.  With that said, this got a ROCKSTAR response from this crew!  Here is where I went wrong....I told them how easy it was and what it was made from.  They almost turned their noses up based on that info and forgetting about the taste!  I yelled at them and told them it shouldn't matter.  They agreed and went back to their original response by stating that this was a Christmas Level Dessert!!!

Great recipe, but I only gave it 4 stars, because the topping calls for too much butter. I had to use paper towel to mop up puddles of butter after it was done baking. I will definitely make again as it got rave reviews at a party I took it too, but I will make with 1/4 cup butter for the topping instead of 1/2 cup.

Follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed.  I love this recipe because there are not many desserts that go with Mexican food.  This is perfect for taco night.  It would be nice if the directions included "chill" instead of "cool".  It really needs to be refrigerated.  We tasted it when it had cooled at room temperate, and it was difficult to cut and soft.  After refrigerating, it was easy to serve and just right.  Will be making this again.  Delicious!

I just made this for our Mexican themed Thanksgiving dinner.  I wanted some kind of a dessert.  I was a little worried because it seemed so simple.  It was FABULOUS!  I too bought the seamless crescent rolls and completely cut out the rolling step.  It fit perfectly right out of the can.  When I pulled it out of the oven, though, there was a big pool of butter.  I was a little bummed and was going to scoop it out.  My husband insisted I keep it.  I just spread it around instead.  Well, this was perfect.  It's definitely sweet, and paired well with black coffee.  Some drizzled chocolate over top was excellent too.

i wish i could give this more than 5 stars.  it is so easy to make and unbelievably delicious.  i spread the butter mixture on the top and when i cooked it, it melted and seeped through the entire dessert.  i brought this to a party and received rave reviews.  i will definitely be making this recipe again.

I had cream cheese and crescent rolls that I wanted to use up.  This was simple and good!  I halved the recipe and made it in a 9X9 round baking dish.  I also used less butter and just brushed it on top and sprinkled cinnamon & sugar on top.  I would definitely add more honey next time as I didn't taste it.  Husband, sister and mother-in-law loved it though.

This is one of the best desserts I've ever had. First of all, it's creamier than a regular cheesecake. The dough may seem a little hard to roll out, but don't be discouraged. It will look turn out fine after baking. The honey on top is what makes it. I saw several recipes like this without the honey and was glad I chose this one. Very easy, crowd pleaser.

wow!!! This recipe is sooooooooo good! Everyone went mad over it! Its so easy to make and so very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly only i used regular vanilla extract instead of the mexican vanilla extract. I dont think it made a difference.  I will make this over and over and over!!!! :P

I really hate to leave less than great feedback, but I don't believe this recipe warranted any higher than 3 stars. Maybe "cheesecake" in the title threw off my expectations because the cream cheese mixture resembled and tasted like more of a cheese danish filling. I have a major sweet tooth and I found this to be far too sweet to eat. Another reviewer put it best by referring to it as a "poor man's cheesecake"; so sorry! If you're looking for or you're a fan of thick, dense cheesecake then this is not the recipe for you.

Really great recipe! It's super easy, cheap and yummy. I can't ask for anything better than that! I added an egg as others recommended. I also reduced the butter in the topping but still had a pool of butter in the middle so the topping didn't brown in that spot as much as I'd like. I might reduce it even more next time so that will help (a little!) with the colorie count and help with the butter pooling problem :o)  So yummy, thanks a lot!

This was good, but not "amazing" as some reviews would have you believe. I halved the recipe (including the crescent roll dough) and baked everything in a small shallow dish. Used brown sugar and cinnamon on top. It was certainly easy to make, with readily available ingredients, and tastes good warmed up or cold from the fridge....all I'm saying is that it wasn't the alpha and omega of desserts as some reviews state. My husband called it a poor man's cheesecake, and that's probably about right (cheesecake-like flavor without the time investment). I'll make it again for guests and see what they think.

Soooo yummy!  I don't like honey so didn't use it.  Next time I will use less sugar as it is very sweet but definitely deserves its five star rating!  Fantastic!!!

This is possibly the most delicious dessert I have ever tasted.  I call them Cheesecake Sandwiches. I made them for a Birthday party and cut them into about 40-ish bite-sized pieces in various shapes (mostly little triangles)  They were a HUGE hit!

I've made this before on here with another recipe similar. A couple of  differences I see is the addition of cream cheese by 1 pkg and the sugar is increased by 1/4 cup in this recipe. I will have to say. That I like the addition of honey in this but I followed the recipe to a T, and I had to bake this longer because the cresent roll dough would not get past the doughy stage in the center and nearly burnt the bottom in the process, even after being in the oven 45 minutes, I felt there was too much butter that caused the top to still be doughy. Because even when I pulled it out, excess butter was still moving about in the center of the dish. Possibly decrease the butter to 1/3 cup verses 1/2 a cup, and I put 1 tbsp of cinnamon in the topping because it looked like it needed more. It's an okay recipe. Oh and I used Cresent creation cresent rolls, there is no seam to it and you don't have to use a rolling pin to join the seams together.

I made this for a party and it was the first dessert gone!  I make the filling with the ready-to-eat cheesecake filling so I cook it a little longer and I didn't have Mexican vanilla so I just used regular. Absolutely delicious!  Thanks CandelB!

I have a new favorite for potlucks.  This is great.  My husband normally will pass on cheesecake, but really liked this.  The only variance from the recipe was that I made the topping with very cold butter.  Put the butter, sugar and cinnamon into the food processor and it was nice and crumbly for the top.  Adding the honey is dynamite and really makes this stand out.

This was terrific - huge hit with discriminating gourmets! Made as written - except used regular vanilla and not Mexican vanilla as called for. NOTE: Some Mexican vanillas are toxic - read up on it before using. Super easy recipe - great as a take-along dessert. I cut into 24 pieces and that was plenty for everyone as it is a very sweet dessert.

I cut back on the sugar in the topping by half.  Very good  however, I did not try with honey.  Don't be discouraged this recipe requires the use of cresent rolls, it did'nt have that bread like taste.

I have made this a few times and is always loved. This time I made individual cookies. I used 3 packages of crescent rolls, but only half of the filling and topping. Just cut the crescent triangles in half and put some filling in the centre of each and pinch the edges together. I also put more cinnamon over the finished product before adding the honey. Leave about an inch between each before it goes in the oven...they do spread!

This recipe always gets me great compliments. They taste like a fresh cream cheese danish. I have made this recipe with Neufchâtel cheese and it turned out great! I would not recommend using fat free cream cheese, because you will get a different flavor.

Take the sweetest thing you've ever eaten and times that by 2, if not 3.  Seriously. This is good in small pieces w/ strong, black coffee.  Very quick to make, leftovers didn't hold up so well. Won't make again.

YUUUMMMMMM!!! This is not only the best tasting dessert, it's probably the easiest as well!!!  I've made it with and without the honey.  It's good both ways.  The only change I make is I use brown sugar for the topping instead of white sugar.   Makes your house smell great too!

So good & so easy!  The one thing I would recommend is using a stone baking dish if at all possible.  I made one in my stone dish & one in my glass dish in the same night.  The stone dish turned out so much prettier & much more even than the one in the glass dish.  Didn't use anywhere near a 1/4 cup of honey, either.  So sweet it doesn't need much, if any at all.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a good and easy dessert to make.  My mother thinks it is a little too sweet, but it is suppose to be.  I would take this to a potluck dinner as a nice change to the usual dishes.  I will make again.

This was so so good! It was the perfect amount of sweet and cinnamon y, lol! However we did add a little bit more cinnamon than what was suggested. My husband and my sister- in- law ate some as well and both loved it! I will definitely be making this again!

We were looking for a mexican dessert for an office party.  I chose this one for one of the girls to make.  It was great!  I can't wait to try it on the family.

Very quick to put together for potluck or casual dessert, but IMO the topping had way too much sugar, was gritty, and didn't add to the flavor.  Next time I'll only use 1/4 sugar in the topping and double the cinnamon.  Might add thinly sliced apples on top as well. Was good for a fast cheesecake fix.

Extremely easy to make. Took to a Mexican themed potluck and it was a big hit. It is very sweet, even for me and I have a big sweet tooth. I think you can definitely get more than 12 servings out of this. The crescent roll dough puffs in the oven, then tends to flatten out, which makes this an ideal dessert for a potluck, because they can be cut and eaten more like a bar than a slice of pie. Another reviewer suggested beating an egg into the filling which may be an option if you want a lighter, fluffier plated dessert.

Very good!  Very easy as well.  I did one thing differently as I didn't have crescent rolls but had some frozen puff pastry - used the puff pastry instead of crescent rolls and it was quite delicious.  I used a 9x13 glass pan and cut the pastry to fit.  I will try it with crescent rolls as well, but in a pinch I think pie crusts would also work too.  My understanding is that the honey is to be drizzled on the dessert after it is removed from the oven - not before cooking.  This may help those experiencing some sogginess.  I also melted the butter for my topping as I didn't want to rip the puff pastry top.  I found I needed to bake it longer than indicated - about 15 extra minutes, but I am high altitude and sometimes it just happens that way.  I will make this again - no doubt.  Thank you so much for sharing it!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe! Very easy and delicious. It's sweet enough on it's own but I had some left over from a party so I decided to drizzle a little bit of milk chocolate on top. I actually think it was better! Great recipe, thanks!

YEAH, THIS IS A LIFE CHANGING DESSERT!!!  I had to make a couple changes to it out of necessity though.  I ended up using a bigger pan, so I could serve more people. and didn't have enough of the cream cheese mixture, so I added two eggs, 1/4 cup sour cream and the juice and pulp of a lime.  I added the lime because other reviewers said the cream cheese mixture was pretty sweet, and I reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup.  I baked the dessert longer (about 45 minutes total) in order to let the cream cheese mixture set up.  When I pulled it out of the oven, I added more butter, sugar, and cinnamon and skipped the honey.  I also refrigerated it overnight before serving. The lime ended up being a great compliment to the sweetness on top.  It's delicious...and it's all gone!!!

Wonderful either cold or warm! I reduced the sugar for the topping to 1/4 cup to give it a stronger cinnamon flavor, and I liked it that way. I also used Neufchatel cheese that is labeled to have "1/3 less fat than cream cheese" and you couldn't taste a difference. I did not use the honey topping because I thought it would be too sweet. I actually served this for breakfast! Believe it or not, it makes a wonderful breakfast treat - great with bacon/sausage and a fruit salad! When I serve this for dessert (and I'm sure I will!!) I will try the honey on the top, but it's wonderful without, too.

Excellent! I followed a prior reviewer's tips adding another 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 c. sugar, and 1/2 teas vanilla to filling.  I melted 1/2 c. butter pouring to cover the top crescent layer, then the sugar/cinn mixture.  I baked 35 min & drizzled the honey overall.  Took to a baby shower where it was devoured and I was asked for the recipe by several different people.  YUMMO!!!!

My 28-year-old son just had his first piece of this dessert.  He said nothing but "Mmmmm" while eating it, ran to the refrigerator and had another piece, then responded, "This could be my downfall!"  He has just left to get the ingredients so that he can make this and take it to work.  This is a wonderful recipe--easy to prepare, reasonable cost, better the next day.  I just reduced the sugar in both the filling and topping.  Thank you for this incredible recipe!

I halved the recipe and made 3 small round cheesecakes with it. I liked it very much overall but I think it is too sweet. I love honey but adding it made the dessert WAY to sweet. Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar used as topping and maybe I will also reduce the amount used on the filling.

Yummy!  I made these for a Mexican theme dinner and the Sopapilla was gone.  The only change I made was I pressed the dough into the bottom of the pan versus using the rolling pin to roll the crescent dough.  I tried rolling the dough and it was a diseaster.  I had to go buy another can of crescent rolls:)  This receipe is YUMMY!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would. This recipe needs no changes and is SOOOOO easy.  I have made this several times for sharing at potluck dinners and it is such a hit! When I take something else to a dinner people get mad and me and want to know why I didn't bring "my dessert".   I can't make it for us at home or I would eat it all and get sick.  You HAVE to try this recipe.  You can get away with being sloppy with the crescent roll dough, not even rolling it out, slapping the topping on and it still tastes fantastic.    I am ALL about easy and delicious and this fits the bill wonderfully.

Holey Moley are you in for a treat if you make this!!! It is simple to assemble and even easier to eat. I made it the way it is written but used margarine instead,no butter on hand. It was just the perfect combo of creamy goodness and cinnamonie yummieness! Yesterday was a good cooking day for me:) I scored high from the family on 2 dishes from this site! Thank You CandleB Awesome and will most defiantly make again.

Loved it, I had to eat half of it before I decided....it might be too sweet.  I will have to eat the other half to decide for sure.  Yum

This is so very good! I was worried that the top wasn't cooked when I took it out but it was fine. I didn't have any Mexican Vanilla so I used regular Pure Vanilla. Perfect. I really liked the honey on it when it was warm, not so much when it was cold. And I could never decide which way I preferred it hot or cold. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful dessert for our Supper Club. Hubby couldn't attend, so he got the leftovers today - not a big dessert guy, so when he tried it and I got a "Wow..." out of him - I was floored! Then he subtly asked, "So there was only that one piece left...?" (thankfully for him, a couple more are left.) Used the extra large crescent rolls, little less sugar in the middle, and broiled the top for a couple of minutes to brown it nicely. Served cold (wasn't sure if I should - thanks for RExch opinions) - so simple, easy ingredients (used reg vanilla b/c had it onhand, omitted honey) so good, and feeds a lot!

Although I can't pronounce the name of this dessert very well, I decided to try it just the same. Had 12 guests for dinner made several desserts. One guest said she thought HER cheesecake was the best ever until she ate this one. I made as directed but did spread cherry pie filling over the cheesecake batter before I put the crescent rolls on top. THIS IS OUTSTANDING AND DO NOT ELIMINATE THE HONEY STEP AND BE SURE TO USE MEXICAN VANILLA

I made this for a neighbor's dinner party, and while my neighbor's loved it, I was not too thrilled with the taste.  Seemed more like a cheese danish to me.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I don't think I'll make this recipe again ... although 2 of my neighbors have asked for it.  (Perhaps it's just me.)

First I have to say this was WONDERFUL!! Reminded me alot of Oooey Gooey Cake...Just alot easier and so tastey!! Everyone at the party wanted the recipe and I mean everyone! Will definately make during the holidays..  I cooked the crust for a few minutes to heat up and allow the cream cheese layer to spread easier.  Also did small dollups of cream cheese all over the crust otherwise it would be to hard to spread.  Did same with the butter on the top crust...Didn't roll out crust just pressed the seems together too.  And it was easy and looked just fine after cooking...Honey made a big different for those who wanted honey...gave it an extra little something!!  Let everyone put on the honey themselves...Thank you CandelB for such a wonderful recipe!!!

Just got done eating a slice. And it was wonderful. A really great recipe. I recommend trying it. I made it just as it was, it is sweet so you can stand to lose some sugar. But still just awesome!!

I made a double batch for a retirement potluck.  Awesome!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Used 1 batch portion of sugar in filling and left off the honey.  Will double the crescent roll amounts in my next batch. Very easy and delicous.

Kinda too sweet. I decreased the amount of sugar in the topping after reading other reviews, but next time I'll also decrease the amount of sugar in the cream cheese mixture to maybe 3/4 of a cup.

If you are looking for something easy that most everyone will like and will impress your guests, this is it! It is original and delicious! A definite favorite. I already love cheesecake, but this offers a different  twist that still offers the great cream cheese flavor. I made two batches two separate ways after reading other reviews on here..some people suggested melting the butter and pouring it on top and then sprinkling cinn./sug....i did that and it was okay, hardly any different from the original way of the recipe..but i would say i like the original way best. But for ease and time sake I think I will probably contnue to melt the butter because the difference is so unnoticeable..and it is easier to get the butter mix even that way. Also I ate the first whole batch warm or room temp and it was awesome..but the consistency was definately better chilled. When warm the cream cheese separates some from the crescent. Either way honestly takes great. I also TOTALLY forgot about the honey..I will try it next time but it is great without it. I also thought it was amusing that everyone thought it was "Mexican" and sopapillas don't even exist in the hispanic culture lol (at least thats what my native-Guadalajara husband tells me). But anyone will love this dish, that is for SURE!

I made these for a large crowd and got rave reviews. Next time I will bake 10 min longer as it was still doughy in the middle. I will also use half the sugar.

Everyone loves this recipe.  I had a friend ask me if I would make and bring this to tonights church potluck. I told her I was to bring a salad, she said "I will make two salads, just bring the pie!" And it is sooo easy, my kids make it too.  I do melt the butter before I mix in the sugar and cinnamon and then pour it on, works great!

Fantastic!! Served it at a Cinco de Mayo party and it everyone asked for the recipe. The only thing I would do differently next time is use about 1/2 the butter called for on the topping.

I thought this came out a bit boring, tasted like a cinnamon cheese danish, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. BUT, my guests that I served it to at a Cinco de Mayo dinner devoured it and LOVED it so much, they made me make another batch in the same week, and they praised me for doing so and devoured that too!!!  It's SO easy to make and apparently, it impresses your friends!  So I do recommend it!

SO easy and SO good.  I made this for the first time and it was so easy to make. I cut back on the sugar in the mixture and on top by 1/4 a cup and it was so good. I don't think you need to roll out the crescent rolls at all. Just open the cans and place the pastry in the bottom of the dish and smush the dots together. I cooked it for about 45 minutes and it was yummy. I also didn't "dot" the butter and cinnamon mixture. I smoothed it out all over the whole pan and drizzled honey when it was cooling. I prefer these cold as well.

Talk about a HIT!! I made this for my work lunch fiesta, and everyone loved them. Another co-worker made this (we had no idea we were making the same thing) but instead of mixing the butter-cinnamon-sugar together for the top, she melted the butter and poured it on top, and then sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar over that. I think I will do that next time. It was just as good but better in presentation.  My father-in-law wants me to make this for all the family 'get-togethers' now!! :)

I made this for a cinco de mayo party.  It was gone in minutes.  Everyone LOVED it.  I did use 3/4 cup white sugar in the cream cheese part and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the topping.  With the added honey, it was sweet, but not so much it made your teeth ache. I chilled the entire dessert in the fridge overnight and it was very easy to cut.  It looked really nice.  Very easy and impressive.

I just put the crescent rolls in the pan and pinch the seams together.  The last time I made this, I added another 8 oz cream cheese and put a can of cherry pie filling over the cream cheese before putting on the second crescent.  I also put slivered almonds on top.  For something different, you should try this.  It was yummy!

Just as all the other reviewers have said "this is delicious." I followed the ingredients to a T and everything came out perfect! I don't enjoy reading reviews when the ingredients and preparaton are altered and then the recipe is given a poor rating--I hope this suggestion doesn't fall into that category--as other viewers have written there is no need to roll out the crescent dough-just carefully press the perforations together after putting the dough in the prepared pan: both on the bottom and top crust-saves time and looks great!

Took this to a pot luck and it was easy and delicious.  A hit with everyone, even my hubby who is not usually a sweet person.  (He's a nice guy - just doesn't like sweets).  Make sure you put them in the fridge to chill before cutting.

THIS IS SO GOOD!  I couldn't find mexican vanilla, so i used the normal stuff and other than that, followed the directions to a T.  I was worried when I took it out of the oven, it was pretty and brown and fluffy but the butter/sugar mix on top had pooled in places and seemed too wet like maybe I should put it back in for a few minutes...but I decided not to and a few minutes later, I look at it and the fluffy brown pastry on top had sunken quite a bit and then I REALLY worried that I should have cooked it longer (hubby even laughed and asked if my cheesecake was supposed to look like that!)....but by the time that it had cooled completely, it was delicious and I wouldn't do anything differently next time.

Seriously addicting! I've made this more times than I can count and it is fabulous! I didn't realize that I was out of white sugar and had already started making it, so I subed in brown sugar. It worked well, just a bit sweeter than the white sugar is. I've kept the brown sugar on top because it has a better flavour and texture than the white sugar did (I tried it as per the recipe the next time I made it). Overall, AMAZING and easy! Thank you for making me look like an awesome chef!

I made this for a mexian night at a friends house. It was SO yummy. I had to bake it a little longer than 30 min but it turned out really great!

Delicious, but too sweet and rich for us.  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar in the filling, and about 1/4 cup cinnamon sugar on top.  I was on the phone to a plumber about a broken pipe, and just forgot to put the butter on top, so I melted 3 tablespoons of butter and brushed on after it baked.  I drizzled with honey also after baking.  It still came out just great!

Absolutely Delicious Dessert!  Add fresh fruit and a dollop of whipped cream on top for a truly rich dessert.

Put 1 can of cherries or blueberry pie filling on top of the cream cheese mixture. Then top it with the second layer of crescent roll.

Absolutely wonderful! Next time i might add some fruit on top of the filling. I cut the sugar...3/4 cup in the filling and 1/2 cup on the top...and it was still real sweet. I served it with ice cream. My mom and granny both asked for the recipe.

Wow!!  This recipe is so delicious.  It is easy and a huge hit.  Every person that tried it loved it.  I wouldn’t recommend putting quite as much honey on top as it calls for because it was a little overwhelming, just a light drizzle over the top would be better.  Seriously though, you must make this recipe!!

This is a very quick, easy and inexpensive dessert.  I took it to my husband's work and it was gone in less than 15 minutes.  It's also very versatile, you could add different berries or fruit to spice it up a bit.

This is one of the most delicious desserts I've ever made. It's so good, and so easy, that I find myself returning to it again and again, often at the request of friends and family! I usually halve the recipe and cook it in a 9x9 pan, use regular vanilla, and add sliced almonds on top. Fantastic!

Incredibly easy and incredibly good. I didn't have mexican vanilla and used regular vanilla extract instead. I forgot to add the honey at the end, but it was delicious without it. I am definitely going to make this again.

I made a few changes as others have recommended. Cut the sugar that is mixed with the cream cheese in half. I couldnt imagine adding more. I also only used enough of the butter to cover the top of the cresents. I also sprinkled the sugar and a bit of cinnamon on top of that. It has a simple taste but thats what makes it so good and I wouldnt want to change that by adding anything else to this. This was great served cold!

O. My. God. AMAZING! I made this sugar free for a diabetic friend and no one else who ate it could tell it was sugar free! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I did add more cream cheese and an extra egg. A keeper for sure!

I get rave reviews every time I make this.  It's super easy to make, and I've never had anyone complain about the taste.  One modification I make is to pour the melted butter over the top and then sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top of that (instead of mixing the butter with the cinnamon and sugar first).  This distributes the cinnamon/sugar more evenly.

So simple and so delicious.  I used light cream cheese with no problems and I used 2 tsp of cinnamon on the topping as I really like cinnamon.  I brought it to a friends house who is an outstanding cook along with her "skilled at cooking" friends and everyone really liked it.
Next time, instead of vanilla, I am going to try some lemon liquor or perhaps some Frangelico, I think it would be interesting to see how it turns out.

Made it 3 times now and loved it. It presents well. Even though it's not an involved process, it pairs as a dessert for your most gormet main course. And hey, this and a mug of coffee is a nice breakfast.

So delicious and easy. I melt the butter, sugar and cinnamon and spoon it over the top then once cooked drizzle the amount of honey that looks right to you , "criss crossing"over the top. Awesome warm or cold. There's never any leftovers.

Family liked this a lot.  Used puff pastry instead of the crescent rolls because that's what I had.  Turned out great.  Even better the next day.  Thank you for the recipe!

Super easy and  delicious! I used butter crescent rolls because that's what my husband bought. Will make again for sure. This would be great to take to a pot luck. I think it would be a hit.

My family and I love this! I make this recipe as is, except that I do just drizzle then honey to taste, rather than measure. If you can find the Mexican vanilla, I recommend it.

This is a super easy, yummy recipe that everyone loves when I make it for potlucks! Always gets rave reviews and so simple. I did take others recommendations and add one egg to cream cheese mixture as well as use a "Mexican vanilla" from Walmart. The egg adds a lightness and a texture I like. I recently discovered that Safeway sells Crescent rolls that are one sheet so easier to roll out especially for the top.

Worked fine to unroll crescent dough into the dish and press to the sides.  Made exactly as written except skipped the rolling out step.  I think this might be a love it or not so much kind of recipe.  Some loved it, others not so much, including me.   Very sweet and rich, but that may be just the ticket for you.

Other commenters were not exaggerating about how good this recipe is. You know what croissant dough tastes like, and you know what cream cheese, sugar, cinnamon, and butter taste like, so you kind of expect it to taste like those things. But somehow, the mixture of all those ingredients creates something otherworldly in deliciousness and you would not think the ingredients were so simple. I halved the recipe (sadly!) and reduced the sugar though.

Perfect taste.  It was all gone after being set out.  The main argument over it was do you eat it cold because it is a cheese cake or eat it warm because it is a Sopapilla.

I cut the sugar in half, added an egg.  The dough didnt stretch to cover the pan but turns out it didnt matter.  Only needed to cook it 25 minutes.  Too sweet for me but the kids loved it.

Husband loved it!  I didn't eat it because i'm gluten free.  I did follow others suggestions of cutting the sugar on top to 1/2 cup and also found that I needed much less butter.  I just melted the butter, brushed it on top then spread the cinnamon sugar on top.  
Also the crescent rolls?  I didn't need to roll out at all.  Just take straight from package and roll out on top of cooking pan.  Then you just have to do a little pinching together.  
Hubby said it tasted like cinnamon toast with cream cheese.  Went back for seconds!

Soooo good! It might be my husband's new favorite. He took a bite and actually said "wow".  I think that's a win!

It was really good, but the cream cheese was a little heavy for me.  I'll probably reduce the cream cheese by a little next time.

Love love LOVE these!!! The only change I made is to use the crescent roll sheets rather than the pre-cut rolls. Makes the process WAY easier!!! :D You don't have to worry about trying to press seams together and whatnot. Gonna make these again soon!! :)

Followed the recipe exactly!! The only critique I have is that it took almost an hour to bake - admittedly my oven runs a little cool, but I turned up the heat to compensate like I do every other time I bake something.

I don’t add as much sugar as called for, but that’s just personal preference. Any recipe for baked goods, I don’t add as much sugar as called for. Another recipe I read says u can use brown sugar instead on top, with cinnamon for a richer flavor. (I add 1/2 cup instead to top, & then just a little bit more than 3/4 c to cream cheese)

The best! Always requested and loved by family & friends.
Only change is I add one egg to cream cheese mixture. Make sure everything is room temperature.  Soo easy, no fail, so good!

Delicious! Definitely needs to cook about 10min longer for the middle to finish. No need to roll out, just press the seams together.

I teach a food science class.  Each class group was given assignments to make a Mexican dish.  One group made thus recipe.  They really started something.  It was delicious.  One week we made this recipe 15 time as encore for teachers and students.  It's still a big hit.  Easy! Fast! Delightfully good to you but oh so bad for you!

My go-to dessert for Mexican dinners!  Leftovers are not very good due to crescent roll hardening, so scale in half if you have a small family.

Great recipe!  A huge hit at my Cinco de Mayo party, and several recipe requests. After reading the reviews, I made a few changes .  . . I used three 8 oz packages of cream cheese, plus brushing the top layer with  2 Tbs softened butter then sprinkling the sugar/cinnamon on top of that. No pooling of butter like some cooks mentioned. The next time I will also pre-bake the bottom layer for a few minutes before adding the filling. It wasn’t bad without pre-baking but I think it might help give the bottom a little more presence. I didn’t even taste it without chilling . . . Trusted the other reviewers and waited until the next day to try and I was thrilled.

It was good but beware... 

If, like me, you looked at this recipe and thought “Wow, that’s a lot of sugar,” then go with your instincts. I went verbatim and strongly suggest dialing back the sugar content to no more than 2/3rds cup sugar for cream cheese mixture, and 1/2 cup sugar for topping.  I’d probably adjust the amount of honey to preference.

Seriously, if your family rarely indulges in high sugar foods/drinks, I strongly urge for an adjustment.

I made this to take to Sunday Brunch on Cinco De Mayo and it was a hit.  I cut it into 24 pieces instead of 12 and it was the perfect size.

This turns out great every time and is really easy to make. I reduce the amount of sugar in the topping to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 as the first time I made it, a few people said it was too sweet.

If you haven’t noticed, there aren’t many recipes that generate a 5 star review. This one has it, and it deserves it!  I made this for guests and they went crazy- even the ones that don’t like dessert! The only thing I did differently is that I added 1 t Mexican vanilla to the butter/sugar mixture- it spreads nicely over the top of the crust for an even, crunchy texture.

Delicious.  After reading the reviews I added an extra 8oz of cream cheese and half the amount of sugar.  The little amount that was leftover I managed to savour over a few days and it tasted better and better.

This was delicious!  I was responsible for dessert at a dinner party.  Everyone loved it.  I did add sliced almonds to the top before I put it in the oven as I had seen in a few other similar recipes.  Also, I didn’t have Mexican vanilla so I used regular vanilla extract.  I will definitely make this again.

I was intrigued by this recipe and really didn't know what to expect.  My husband and I loved it.  Since I know it is such a great recipe and easy to make, I plan on making it and taking it to one of our church pot luck dinners.  I think it will
be a real hit.  Thank you for sharing

This is a really easy recipe to use up older cream cheese. I cut the recipe in half, and even though I had less than 8oz of cream cheese, the inner filling was still thick. My only suggestion would be to reduce the butter portion of the topping  by maybe 1/8 cup so that you don't have too much runoff. The dessert was sweet enough without using any honey. This is definitely a keeper.

This was so easy. I didn’t bake the bottom crust for 7 minutes before adding filling. It was loved by all. I will make it again but will cut all Sugar by 25% and be sure to use 3 bricks of cheese.  Yum.

I cut the sugars in half and it was plenty sweet enough for us.  Will make again and play with some fruit additions but it's good as is.  Not an authentic sopapilla but a tasty sopapilla cheesecake dessert.

This dessert went fast!   Took it to a Fiesta Party for dessert, and it was a big hit. My girlfriend described it as a mix between, cheesecake and cinnamon rolls.  My dish didn't look as great as the pictures though.  You got to be strategic about how you place the dots of sugar mixture.

Definitely doesn't taste like sopapillas, I would say filled churros, but certified and easy to make. I halved the recipe as it's only my husband and myself. Worked beautifully in a 8x8 pan . Thanks for this easy, tasty dessert.

Mode these for an event this evening.  Had the husband try one in advance. Stepped out of the room for a minute and when I stepped back in two were gone.  Needless to say he liked them.  Got rave feedback at get together.  Made per recipe except added an egg because of some reviews that filling was too runny.   Mixed melted butter and sugar/cinnamon together before putting on top.

I make this all the time. Sometimes I change it up by eliminating the vanilla and adding lemon extract and lemon zest or orange extract and orange zest. It is good no matter how you make it. Always get rave reviews and have given the recipe to  many others.

It was honestly pretty good. The filling is kind of off, it doesn't taste like cheesecake. But it's still really tasty and easy to make. I would probably make this again to bring somewhere. I would recommend cooking it a little shorter than the advised time.

This really tastes like sopapilla. The combination of the doughy crescent rolls and the cinnamon, sugar, butter and cream cheese tastes amazing. I couldn't find Mexican vanilla extract, so I used Dominican-style extract instead.

My only complaint is that it seems 8 oz of crescent rolls isn't enough to cover the 9x13 inch pan. I really had trouble getting the top layer to stretch the whole way.

this is an amazing day make ahead dish,I took it to a ladies Bible Study and a church potluck. It is always a hit! I don't put honey on top as it is sweet enough and less sticky without it,but I'm sure it's tasty either way.

This will go in my frequently used recipe folder!
Delicious treat that’s too sweet as written. I cut the sugar in half and doubled the cinnamon. Also melted the butter and brushes it on pastry, as mentioned by other reviewers. 
You’ll be happy you made this for family or for a pot luck.

Made this for my mom’s birthday and it was a big hit. Easy to make and it turned out crunchy and sweet and cream cheesy. At first I had a problem mixing the sugar and cream cheese, it wanted to keep clumping together and it was a little hard to spread but eventually everything worked. Would definitely make this again. It is sweet but not too sweet and fairly inexpensive, really. My mom loves sopapillas and this went perfectly with the chicken enchiladas I made. Are really sopapillas better? Of course, but this is a good replacement to have at home!

This was instantly a favorite and for how easy it was (especially with flat sheet dough now) I’m really happy about it! I made it right from the recipe and I agree that next time I will cut the butter in half AND melt and brush it then add the cinnamon and sugar topping because it did pool leaving gooey dough. I can’t wait to try it cold today!

I have made this for a number of years and take to potlucks.  I take 2 pans.  The 1st one I make like the recipe shows and the 2nd one I add a can of Compton cherry pie filling on top of the cream cheese  then I put the top crescent roll cover.  Awesome....you can use any pie filling.

It’s fantastic!  The only change I made was to prebake the bottom crust for 7 minutes.  It’s less likely to be soggy this way.  Everyone I serve this dessert to, loves it!

This is SO good and is super easy to make!  I brought this to a family gathering and everyone was going back for seconds and thirds.  I cut mine into 24 pieces since it's so rich.   Everyone was surprised that there was Pillsbury biscuit dough in it. It tastes like a much more labor-intensive dessert.  When removing from the oven, I did push down slightly on the areas that had puffed up higher, because the honey was pooling in some areas. That helps the top get an even coating of the honey.

Too sweet for me. I would cut back the amount of sugar and butter used on top  next time. I also omitted the honey because it was already very sweet.

Amazing.  A close-your-eyes-while-you-eat-it dessert.  My kids were asking me to make it again before they even finished their first piece!  We already have plans to try a thin layer of various fruit toppings on top of the cream cheese mixture in the future.  Amazingly easy and absolutely delicious!

This was so good! I added an extra brick of cream cheese and an egg. I cut way back on the sugar and did a jam swirl on top of the cream cheese mixture. I parbaked the bottom for about 8 min and brushed melted butter on the top and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. It was excellent and everyone enjoyed it. Will make again!

I happened to have most of the ingredients when deciding what to take to a Christmas Eve gathering. Only had 1 container of crescent rolls so I rolled out a container of cinnamon roll dough I had and put it on the bottom. Used about a quarter cup less sugar with the cream cheese and the topping. It was a hit on the dessert table.

This was the award winning dessert at my fiancé’s holiday work function! Tomorrow it will make its debut at my son’s school for HIS holiday celebration. Did the recipe exactly as written (added a 1/2 tsp more of vanilla bc I LOVE vanilla). Like other reviewers, I panicked a bit at the center not being done after the initial 45 minutes,but let it continue baking for another 10 minutes or so. Did NOT eat it after it cooled but took a taste test the next morning and BAM...PERFECTION!! Thanks for the recipe!

I’ve made these bars many times, and they’re always tasty and a huge hit when I bring them to parties.  This time I made them in a glass 9x11 baking dish, reduced the temp to 325 and baked for 40 minutes on my convection setting.  The ingredients and all other instructions were followed to a ‘t’.  I made them a day in advance for a lunch I was attending the following afternoon.   Although they’ve always been delicious, they usually ended up a bit ‘soggy’ in the middle.  I’m not sure if it was because I baked them 10 minutes longer, or because I let them sit for a day, but they were PERFECT this time!!  I think my friends licked the tray when I wasn’t looking.....;-).

Ridiculously delicious. It tastes like the best part of the cinnamon bun with a ton of tangy sweet flavour. Even good the next day with a couple seconds in the microwave. Will definitely make again!

I am the type that has to play with the recipe, so I made three, first i stiffen the cream cheese mixture with two egg yolks, and added 2 tablespoons of nutmeg. Then for the first one I added cherry pie filling between the cream cheese and the top crust, the second one I added frozen peaches in white sugar and lemon juice again between the cream cheese and the top crust, and the third one I added fresh black berries in brown sugar, corn starch, butter, and balsamic vinegar again between the cream cheese and the top crust, cooked them all off and all of them turned out amazing.

All I can say is OMG. I took the advice of other reviewers and only put half cup sugar in cheese. i also did 1/4 cup of butter and melted it like others said. One viewer recommended adding brown sugar with the sugar for the topping to add a crunch. I love this recipe!!!!

It was so easy that I can’t understand why everyone in the world can’t make this or think it’s complicated. I love this sweet simple dish. Definitely like adding the extra honey on top and letting it sit overnight. Great potluck dish

I think the next time I make this recipe I will make it with less sugar and butter in the toping for the cheesecake. To see if it makes it less sweet for my mom. But overall I loved this recipe.

This recipe is requested over and over again.  I have gone out of the box alittle by adding different types  of pie filling on top of the cream cheese layer and then topping it with the crescent dough.  So far the blueberry one is the most requested of all.   It is outstanding!!  Yumm!

I would double or even triple the filling g recipe. Bake the bottom layer first for about 10 minutes. Add the filling and then the top layer and finish baking.

I made it as written, served it when it cooled to room temp, and it was so sweet it made my teeth hurt. Put the leftovers in the fridge and when served cold (did not add honey to the cold version) was much better and addictive. You cannot tell it was made with refrigerated dough.

This stuff is amazing. I reduce the sugar A bit and that’s all I change. Every time I show up to a function, people ask me “where’s the cake?”  Lol. We always leave with an empty cake pan.

I've made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. I've never tried it with honey as I believe it's sweet enough without it. I also recommend eating it warm because it's so much better!

Just do not let cressant dough get warm or it is very hard to deal with!
Will make many more times!!!

A solid five star recipe, but for a change of pace, bake the first layer of crescent dough for five minutes then spread a can of apple pie filling and proceed with recipe as written.

I made this for a small gathering and it went FAST. I have made it with the Mexican vanilla and with regular, and the Mexican vanilla produces a result that is over the top. Delicious. If you want to take an empty dish home from the party, make this and use Mexican vanilla!

Everyone loved this recipe. I made it as directed, one cream cheese regular and one reduced fat. I may reduce the topping sugar by 1/4 cup to see if I’d miss it to save calories, but it is rich and decadent as is.

I have made this multiple times through out the years. It pairs perfectly with Cafe Rio Chicken / Pork , black beans,  and cilantro-lime rice. A trick that I've learned when rolling out the crescent rolls is to forego unrolling them into triangles, but roll them into one solid square from the cylinder shape that they come out of the can.  This helps the shape to be solid and more unified.

I did cook it an extra ten minutes as it seemed to need it. The only other change was adding some blueberry pie filling on top :) It is awesome and I will make it again and again.

Have made several times . I sometimes change it up by using almond extract instead of vanilla,I also half the sugar. I have also added a thin layer of strawberry preserves or seedless raspberry jam.  It makes for a nice change up . I am going to try a suggestion one woman did in adding ground pecans ,I think I will try just some crushed nuts on top next time. Definitely one of the easiest quick desert you can make

I made this in a half sheet pan for a graduation party. I used 5 cans of rolls, 6 pkgs of cream cheese, 3 cups of sugar and 3 tsp of vanilla. I tripled the topping ingredients but didn't use quite all of the butter mixture and freehand drizzled the honey. I added about 6 minutes to the cooking time to make sure the middle finished cooking.
It was great and there was the right amount of filling. After cooling, it came out of the pan easily. The leftovers made great snacks and breakfast.

This is fantastic. Delicious. Just make it. It's so easy, but you'll put all the other desserts to shame. I can't wait to make it again. SUGGESTION: Bake a little longer to ensure the bottom crust cooks thru or maybe bake it a little bit on its own.

UNREAL dessert!  Total party fave!  I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup in the cheesecake filling and also added quite a bit more vanilla in filling and topping.  Added chopped walnuts and quite a bit more cinnamon to topping.  Enjoy it really is AMAZING!!!!

I followed suggestions from others by using 3/4 cup sugar and an egg,  1/4 cup of butter on top and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Baked for 30 minutes and drizzled honey over the top when it came out of the oven.  This is a keeper for me!  Very easy and everybody liked it!

First time making this and it was pretty easy! Thehardest part is spreading the crescent roll so it will fit the pan! 

Because we like it less sweet and prefer pir cheesecake on the sour/tart side, I’ve cut back the sugar in filling from 1Cto 3/4C. I’ve added another 8oz cream cheese package making it 3 total instead of 2. And ive also cut the sugar for topping from 3/4C to 1/2C.

It was perfect to our taste preference!

Cut the sugar in half, added an egg and an extra 1 t of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture, used 6 T of butter instead of 8, and combined the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture into a compound... SO GOOD.  

Also added a little sugar and cinnamon to the base layer.  Don't know if that made any difference, but again, SO GOOD.

Great recipe! Very sweet! Everyone loved it, but not was it best the next day. Keep in mind it takes hours in fridge to cool completely and build that great sugar crust. Even goes great with coffee!!

Yum!! I brought this to a weekly group where we always have snacks, and multiple people said it was it was the best snack we'd ever had. The only real change I made was I used regular vanilla instead of Mexican and doubled the amount. It was delicious -- the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I wasn't a fan of how soggy the bottom crust was. Next time I would try pre-baking the bottom before assembling the rest of it. I did also get some excessive butter pooled on the top that I spooned off before it cooled off, but it was fine. So easy, too! I didn't use a rolling pin for the crescent rolls and I honestly don't know why you would because they were already a little longer than the pan as it was; it's not like they needed to be stretched out. Will definitely make again.

Excellent but all that butter just pooled up on the top - took FOREVER for it to become edible.  When I make it again, I'm reducing the amount of butter by at least a 1/3 and also cut back the sugar - it got VERY crunchy.  I like some crunch but this was just a bit much and too sweet as well.  

It was delicious after it became edible.  I'm not sure why it would call for all that butter to sit on top anyway - doesn't make sense.

I thought they were just o.k.,  maybe my tastebuds were off that day since it has a 5 star rating. I don't know if I would give them a 2nd chance, due to the fact their are so many other recipes I have yet to try that might fit my fancy.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit!  Everyone was asking for the recipe, and couldn’t believe it was so easy to make. As I was serving it, I remembered that I forgot to drizzle with honey, but honestly, I don’t think I’d want it any sweeter.

This recipe was so delicious, thank you for sharing! I followed the recipe almost exactly (just used regular vanilla though). I may sprinkle the first layer with a little cinnamon and sugar next time (can you ever have too much?) Honestly though, this was awesome and got so many compliments, why change a thing?

This is delicious!! I added 1 egg to the cream cheese mixture as one of the reviews said and the consistency came out just perfect. I also checked on it throughout the 35-40 minutes to spread out the butter/cinnamon topping so it didn't puddle too much. 
Only thing I might do different next time is I might use some reduced fat crescent rolls and light cream cheese just to make myself feel a little bit better when I want to eat more!

4 stars because I had to cook much longer than the recipe stated, the dough in the middle of the pan stayed gooey for a long time. Taste was 5 stars. Made it the day before serving, Did not use the honey, plenty sweet without it. Also could not find Mexican vanilla. Used 2 1/2 blocks cream cheese but no additional sugar.

This is outstanding!!! First time making it and it won't be the last!!  I followed the recipe as directed, but for sure going to make some tweaks next time.  This time, 1st layer of rolls, placed in pan and spread out, it was easy. 2nd layer I did roll out a bit, made it easier to cover. But I did remember, they sell crescent sheets! So I'll be doing that next time. I added cinnamon to the 1st layer of dough, just for flavor. I do think next time, more cinnamon and vanilla, and less sugar in the cream cheese. While it is good, it's a little too sweet.

This thing was delicious. I was truly surprised at how easy the recipe was to make. It was a bit too sweet though. I will try some of the recommendations to cut down on the sweetness next time I make it.

I made this recipe, but halved it.  Looked wonderful!  After it cooled I tasted it. I had went with the other reviewers and decreased the sugar and didn’t put the honey on it as I didn’t have any but other reviewers said it didn’t need it. It needed something as it wasn’t as sweet as I was hoping, so I continued to read other comments and one said she didn’t have honey so she added a different topping.  I happen to have caramel ice cream topping so I used that in place of the honey and tasted awesome!

warning:  If you take one bite, you will be addicted, and need to lock it up and throw away the key due to being  tempted to eat the whole pan in one  sitting.   This is without a doubt, one of the best-testing desserts ever.  I took this to a work function and everyone raved and raved.  I felt so silly taking compliments for something that was a snap to prepare.  I did use 4 oz more of cream cheese because I had some I wanted to use up, yet kept the sugar amt the same in the filling.  I'm glad that I did use that extra 4 oz, as the filling was just right; not too thick and not too thin.  I did decrease the amt of sugar in the topping to half a cup and it was plenty.  drizzled it w/honey.   I can't decide which was the best part; the filling or the slightly crunchy topping.  I see so many possibilities with this dessert; maybe a can of cherry pie filling, fresh blueberries, or adding lemon zest or mini chips to the cream cheese filling?   what a great recipe to tinker with.  I would suggest if you are making this to take to a big function, you make two pans.  This will be the first dessert to vanish.  thanks so much for this recipe.

I made this as written and it's good, but a little heavy on the butter and definitely too much sugar.  I think I'll try it again and reduce the sugar in the cream cheese mixture to 3/4 cup and cut the topping ingredients in half.  When mine came out of the oven, it had pools of butter which eventually soaked in, but I think it'd be better if you didn't use so much.  Don't cut back on the honey though.  The honey is fine as is.  Also, 30 minutes is not enough baking time.  Increase it to 40-45. It'll be browned on top, but that's better than mushy in the middle.

Everyone raved over this dessert! I served it with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. I did not put the full amount of honey on top because I thought it might be too much. I think next time I will make it exactly as I did this time, but I will have the bottle of honey handy for anyone who would like to add more or even a drizzle on their ice cream. Delish!

I halved the recipe and baked it in a pretty pie dish. I just pressed the dough together but next time will purchase the sheets of crescent roll dough. Still turned out yummy.

It was too sweet for me.  If I make it again, I will cut back on the sugar in the cream cheese and on the top and also cut back on the butter.  My husband and son really enjoyed it though.

Good, but I think 1/2 the butter on top would be plenty! I used one full and one low fat cream cheese and added an egg as another reviewer suggested.

Cut into Fourths and made 2 single serve my husband loved it will definitely be a go to for fast dessert as cutting down everything took so little time to prepare and put in single serve cheesecake pans but still cooked 30 minutes

This was awesome! Very sweet. If I make it again, I might reduce the sugar a bit.

Wonderful, and fairly easy to make, especially with crescent dough in a can (no pinching triangles together!).

I cannot believe how simple this is to make.  I cut it in half, using a 9" square pan as I only had one can of rolls on hand.  I will be sure to make a full batch when I make it again because the smaller pan was gone in less than ten minutes!

We loved it, it was amazing.
I also used only 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 3/4 cups.
I used 3/4 with the cream cheese and 1/4 with the cinnamon or the topping. We also skipped the honey...because I didn't see that part til now. :) 
Easy to make, a quick dessert to take to any event!

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!! I’ve made it a million times and will make it a million more times- and the pan is always empty! For a fall version I like to add another brick of cream cheese and a can of pumpkin in the filling, then some pumpkin pie spice with the cinnamon in the glaze on top. It’s even better with the honey butter pillsbury crescent rolls. Must try!!

This is AMAZING!!  After reading many of the reviews, I went with adding one big egg to the cream cheese mixture - both egg and cream cheese at room temp - just a half cup of sugar for the topping and skipped the honey.  It's sweet and rich and incredibly easy!  Made this twice in less than a week!

I followed a few tips. Added 1 tsp of cornstarch, increased to 16 oz’s of cream cheese, and baked the first layer of dough for 7 minutes. I just wasn’t willing to risk having gooey dough. I let the dough completely cool prior to adding the filling. I did have to spread the cinnamon and sugar around while it was melting. I originally put about 8 dollops of the butter cinnamon and sugar mixture and it made little pockets where it was sitting. I would suggest to mix it up as the recipe states but put several little dollops on the top. Then maybe it will spread on its own. If not, make sure to check on it about 10 minutes in and spread it around. I also added 10 minutes to the timer. Still looked gooey on top in the center. It looks perfect and I’m excited to taste it for thanksgiving tomorrow! If the site allows me, I’ll update later on the taste but it looks exceptional and my house smells amazing! The kids are coming out of their rooms sniffing and smiling.

Definitely use flaky crescents roll dough.  I used a cheap brand the first time and the next time I found a popular brand of crescents rolls (flaky buttery rolls).  Worked much better.

I did use the crescent sheets which fit the baking dish exactly. I also melted half of the butter and brushed it on -  half a stick was plenty. Following other recommendations, I did cut the sugar down and it's sweet enough. I baked it for 45 minutes and the center didn't set up properly., But, the taste is good. Will try again.

This  is an easy dessert to make and delicious. Topping is a little too sweet though. Next time I make it, I  am goimg to add some fruit to the cream cheese and half the sugar used for the topping. It's better after refrigerating. Again, it's great!

I found this to be a relatively easy dish to make with the use of the crescent rolls. I don't use them often, but it was worthwhile in this case.I found the crescent roll dough easier to work with after unrolling it and sticking it in the pan, and the freezer about 15 minutes, the top layer I put in freezer an a cutting board. I reduced the sugar by approx. 30% and increased the cinnamon in the topping. Baked about 20 minutes, and added sliced almonds to the topping. I had to cook my dish about 10-12 minutes longer to obtain the browned pastry look. Cooled and refrigerated over night before cutting. Enjoyed by all!

OMG - good and so easy!  I followed recipe exactly - but did cook for extra 5-10 mins and didn't bother rolling out the dough - just pushed seams together with fingers.  Everyone raved about this dessert - sooooo delicious.

Yep, everyone is right. This is like crack in a pan. I did not add the honey on top, I figured it had enough sugar in it. Next time, I'll take some of that sugar/cinnamon mixture that's on top and sprinkled a little on the bottom, before the cream cheese mixture goes on. This recipe is way too good, I can't stop eating it.

SO simple to make but the results are great. I added about 3/4 of the amount of sugar in the filling and about 2/3 of the suggested sugar for the topping. Any more than this would have been far too sweet, and I also didn't bother with the honey. I also used less butter,  and brushed this on separately before the cinnamon sugar mix which I sprinkled on last.  I'd say the oven timings were just about right but my dish was slightly smaller than suggested and so I used a little less mix. If using the full amount I could see how you would need to cook it for longer. I left this to cool completely before eating which I'd recommend as it was easier to slice.

This recipe is wonderful...I also left out some of the sugar because I thought it would be far too sweet. It was a great decision. The finished product was amazing!!!

I made this last night, I must say it was very easy to make. however, with only two 8 oz cream cheese the filling came out very thin, definitely not like on the pictures.

Reduced the recipe to 4 servings and used 8 oz of cream cheese and 1 can of crescent rolls.  The dough for 4 rolls covered a 9"x9" metal baking pan.  

Used Splenda 1 for 1. The bag  states baked goods cook faster with Splenda than regular sugar.  20 minutes at 350 in a convection oven was PERFECT.

Topping: cut the Splenda and cinnamon into 3 TBS of butter and spread that over the top layer.  Sprinkled a little more cinnamon on top.  The texture of the topping baked out very nicely as if it was real sugar - like cinnamon toast.  I thought it would melt away along with the butter.  I doubt anyone could tell this is made with Splenda.

This was a nice treat for my diabetic hubs.  Still got 12 small portions and this is so rich even with a glass of milk, 2 small squares was enough.

This is going to be the new potluck recipe.  Thank you CandelB.

If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  My daughter in law made it for me one Saturday afternoon after I gave her the recipe.  It was wonderful. We wanted to eat the whole thing.  She used 1/2 the sugar amount in the recipe b/c she knows I watch my sugar intake.  It was delicious. Tasted like a cheese Danish and so easy to make.  She did not roll out the crescent rolls, she simply laid them out in a 9 x 13.  A child could do this.  It's a keeper for sure

Wow, what flavors !!! The homemade taste without all the homemade work. I used puff pastry instead and added light brown sugar for the topping along with the butter and sugar.

This was amazing.  Everyone loved it, and they've requested it be my "go-to" bring for potlucks at work.  I changed it up just a bit, although I'm sure it would be just as delicious as originally written.  I was feeding quite a few people, so I wanted a bit more volume in the cheesecake layer and added an extra block of cream cheese, an extra 1/4 C of sugar and an egg.  I also didn't use quite all of the cinnamon/sugar/butter topping, leaving probably a quarter of it in the dish.  I did spoon off a bit of butter that had pooled but not much at all and since the mixture gives it that slightly struesel top, I didn't want to remove much.  Oh!  I also added just a few pinches of cinnamon and sugar to the bottom crust before topping it with the cheesecake mix.  

Thanks for a crowd pleaser!

Definitely a dessert I would make again. Recipe was easy to follow. Had issues with one of the crescent cans but was able to piece together on top and it still came out delicious. Drizzled honey on some and maple syrup on others...yum!! A dessert for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!

Silly simple to make and absolutely delicious!  I did not use all the butter, sugar cinnamon topping ,  I will make 1/2 of what the receipe call for.   Will make it again for sure - not too soon however, my husband looked up the calorie count.

FANTASTIC
This was excellent, easy and affordable. I made a half recipe in a glass pan and baked it for 35 minutes. I'm making it again and this time I'm using puff pastry. Delicious !
UPDATE 10/2/2017
I'm making this for the third time a half a recipe at a time. This time I used 1/2 cup of raspberry jam - stir it first or it won't spread well - and spread it on top of the cream cheese layer. Bake fir 35 minutes.

Are very delicious. Cooking for 30 minutes didn't seem to be quite enough. Cheesecake mixture was still a bit gooey even after cooling, but keeping in the fridge overnight made a difference. Taste great, will just cook a little longer next time.

I like to try different recipes so thought I'd give this one a try.  The only thing I did differently was add 1 egg and a tad less sugar to the filling based on other reviewers' recommendations.   The simplicity of the recipe is great; however,  I was not impressed with texture and flavor of the crescent rolls or the filling.  Family and I thought this turned out okay.

This was pretty easy to make and most everyone liked it. I didn't care for it personally but I don't really like cheesecake. I think I will make this again to bring to a pot luck or to someone's house, like I did today but I won't be making it for myself.

It's a tasty recipe but way too sweet .Next time I will try half the sugar on the top and maybe cook the bottom crust for a few minutes before adding cheese mixture.

The cream cheese filling was a little grainy with the white sugar. Maybe should have used powdered sugar? Next time I will use a third block of cream cheese.

A five star recipe as written! I make no changes and everyone who eats this is floored at how stupid good it is! Even people who don't like cheesecake were going back for seconds!  The smell as it bakes is divine and there were no leftovers from the 9x12 glass pan I made for my party last night (10 people).  It's best served chilled in my opinion.

Oh my goodness!!! Super delicious & ridiculously easy! Do cut back on sugars a tad  & increase cream cheese & vanilla to taste. Spreading top layer on waxed paper to transfer is helpful & pre bake first layer 7 min. Absolutely Fantastic. Tasters were in heaven!

I have been making this wonderful recipe for over a year and it is a crowd pleaser!! I rate this a full 5 stars just the way it is. I have made it almost a dozens times and everyone  raves about it--it is so simple to make and inexpensive. I have done one thing different  after the first attempt and that was only to bake the first layer for 7 to 8 min.--(that  was a very helpful review). This is absolutely delicious!!!

Oh la la! The first time I made this recipe was for a party at work and everyone just raved about it.  At first I followed the recipe to a tee and it was delicious.  Later I tweaked it a little and added one more package of cream cheese and drizzled the top with honey while it was still hot. You gotta try this!

I have made this numerous times and bring to potlucks etc and always get rave reviews each time and it's so easy to make. The only thing I don't do is drizzle the honey as it's plenty sweet enough without it and I had to increase the baking time to 45 minutes, but that might be due to my pan or other factors like elevation

I was looking for a recipe for a Mexican themed get together, and I chose this recipe. It was very easy to make.  And everyone loved it and raved about it! Even my husband, who is not a fan of cheesecake, thought it was wonderful :)
I will definitely make it again! Probably this weekend.

I couldn't go with the full sugar, just seemed like too much. I used 3/4 cup in the cream cheese  & cut the amount of everything that goes on top by 1/2. It's still a very sweet dessert, it needs to be cut with a tart fruit topping,thinking cherries or apples.

Super easy and turned out PERFECT!!   I followed the recipe exactly.  Don't worry about rolling out the bottom layer exactly to size ... just adjust it in the pan.  The second layer of crescent crust on top is the trickiest part.  Don't sweat it ... just put it on top and adjust .. it is impossible to mess this up.  And, I'm glad I watched the video because it demonstrated how to use the rolling pin to transfer the crust from the mat to the pan.    I did mess up the topping as I had to soften the butter in the microwave and it was more melted than I wanted.  This resulted in me spreading the cinnamon sugar mixture on the top crust versus dotting it.   I put it in the oven and pulled it when the timer went off.  Everyone loved it.

I made this sopapilla cheesecake for Cinco de Mayo at work, and it was a big hit.  I made it twice, the first time as a test almost exactly by the recipe, with the only exception being that I used just 2-3 T butter and brushed it on the dough surface before adding the cinnamon-sugar topping.  So I used less butter, because I read over and over in the reviews that the quantity of butter called for was too much.  The second time I did the butter the same as the first, but there were a couple more alterations.  My alterations the second time were to use 3 pkgs cream cheese, rather than two, plus a room temperature egg in the filling, which made the dish rise more.  
Both recipes were super good, but I think I prefer the second one best because it made a thicker dessert, which went farther. 
I think it's worth buying the crescent dough that comes in whole sheets, too, rather than the perforated sheets, as the whole sheets were a bit easier to handle.  Basically, the perforated sheets tore at least 4 or 5 times, while the whole sheet only tore once, and it was a small tear.  And if it tears, pinch it back together, it will be fine.  I did use Mexican vanilla that I bought at the nearby Latin grocery, but I didn't notice that it added any distinctive flavor to the dish.  I think regular vanilla would be fine.

Next time I want to try sprinkling sliced almonds over the top before baking!

So delicious! The kids inhaled this tonight. Four stars only though because I followed other's advice to cut down on the sugar - glad I listened. Also, I don't think all of that butter is necessary on the top with the cinnamon and sugar. Sure, a little bit helps but not *that* much. I only made a half recipe and used only about three tablespoons of butter. That being said, I'd definitely make this again.

This recipe is delicious as it is; however the next time I make it, I will use less sugar on the top.  I did not roll the crescent dough out. It's much faster to just lay it in your pan and hand pinch the seams together. It fit perfectly in my cake pan without that added step and mess.  Did the top layer the same way without pinching the seams together and it baked and looked just fine.  The hubster absolutely loved this!  Thank you!

Love this recipe. I add fresh blueberries or strawberries. I've tried canned and it makes it soggy. Fresh works best. I do cut the sugar and the butter on top a bit as well. You only need enough butter to cover it. I brush a light coat on and just a sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon to cover. This is a big for our family functions.

Yummy, delicious, wonderful!  I used 3 blocks of cream cheese with 1 1/2 c sugar for the filling.  Next time I will prebake the bottom crescent roll layer for a few minutes before adding the cream cheese and the other crescent layer.  The crescent sheets make this super easy to make!

My Name Is Jeff!! I gave this to my gay boy for his barmitzvah and he was just on the floor loving this bad boy recipe. I salivated at the moistness of these doggies, I made a smoothie with it and it broke my jaw. Truly a Mexican food, my only problem is that I can't give it 6 stars. Take these nuts on your chin and EAT PANT.

Whoever doesn't like this recipe doesn't like crescent rolls, cream cheese, sugar, cinnamon, or honey....I'm not a big sweet eater and this is definitely not too sweet.  I make it all the time and never have any problems with "pooling butter" either.  I make traditional cheesecake too, but this is Soooo much easier and way less time and don't have to worry about the top cracking and looking bad.

This recipe was alright... I probably won't make it again. The people I made it for loved it, but I didn't care for it. The best part was the crust, but the filling was just... too much.

A recipe with 1500+ 5 Star reviews doesn't need one more, but I'm giving it anyways.   This recipe is super easy to follow and it makes a delicious dessert.   I found that I didn't have to roll my dough, as the recipe said, but could place it in the pan and stretch - bonus.    I used pure cane sugar for this and that added a lot, I think.   I would not change a thing, but one pan of this goes a long ways, more than 12 servings.   I would say about 18-20 servings.   Great recipe.

Hoo boy, this was sweet. Mind you  I'm not saying that it's necessarily a bad thing, or that it takes away from the recipe at all. Just reduce the sugar if it's too sweet for your liking. Aside from that, everything else about the recipe is great!

Also, I followed another reviewer's advice when it came to the Mexican vanilla extract by simply shouting, 'Ole!' as I poured it into the mix. Honestly, I was just too lazy to wander all over town looking for it, when there was regular vanilla extract siting right in the kitchen cabinet. 

This is definitely a recipe going into the 'faves' archives.

Made exactly as stated in the directions and it was one of the yummiest easiest treats on a Taco Tuesday. I forgot the honey and now I cant wait to make them again just add that dribble of yummy to this already perfect dessert.

My family absolutely loved this dessert!  I added sliced almonds to the top, gives a little added depth and crunch.  Easy go to recipe when you have limited time!

Very Good and fairly easy but we would prefer it with half of the cream cheese.

I made this for a large family gathering. It got RAVE reviews and was gone in a flash! The best thing about it, other than taste, is the simple and super quick prep time! You can afford to back the sugar (inside and out) off a bit...and you could cut the butter back if you want by a couple of TBS. Also, to make it even easier, pillsbury makes 'dough sheet' tubes...so no need to pinch the crescent seems together. It's just one big dough sheet. ??

I had a printed-slightly different version of this recipe. I lost the recipe along with our home and most of our possessions in a recent fire. 
This version called for honey, which I did not have on hand. Instead I used honey-butter crescent rolls. 
I did not get to try the cake as I was making it for someone else. But it looked yummy & the family I made it for LOVED it!

Hate when people try a recipe and change it to the point that it is unrecognizable...This is the best bang for the buck family or friend/potluck recipe I've come across and I spend lots of time looking for that 5 star rated recipe on he web...Do not mess with this even though you may be tempted to because it is so incredibly easy...Follow the recipe to the T  you will not be disappointed.  Will for sure be my next potluck offering..  was fantastic as is for new years 2017....Having said his the cinnamon crunch from the topping and he cream cheese center would blend beautifully with a layer of apple pie filling.  It is fantastic as is...But am looking forward to trying the addition next time. Cheers!

I made it for my husband because he loves sweets!  It was easy to make and made the house smell wonderful! My only issue is that it's WAY TOO SWEET! Like sugar coma sweet! I am going to make it again tomorrow and cut the sugar down and try to find the right sweetness level! Definitely making it again though!

I made this for Christmas eve and EVERYBODY loved it!! I can't believe how simple and delicious it is. I cut it into bite sized pieces because we have finger foods for Christmas eve.  I was constantly asked for the recipe. It was so easy and so basic, I could recite it from memory. I will definitely make this again!

Followed the recipe exactly - but wanted to share a few things that I learned. 1. When I made this, I didn't spread the cheese to all edges of the dough. So, the crust actually bubbled up and was doughy on the ends.  2. Because of this, I cut into bite size pieces and threw out the edge pieces. 3. This is very sweet and rich, so small bite-sized pieces are perfect. 4. After the dessert cools, cut into pieces and then refrigerate for several hours. It takes so much better cold! 5. The honey makes this dessert simply delicious - somehow it seemed very reminiscent of a sopapilla.

The Sopapilla Cheesecake was awesome! Everyone loved it. I took other reviewers suggestions to use 3, 8 oz blocks of cream cheese and I cut the sugar on top in half. The Mexican vanilla made it perfect. I forgot to put the honey on top, but everyone said it would have been to sweet with the honey. I will try the honey next time I make it. Great recipe!

Great dessert to follow taco soup.  I substituted Fillo dough for the crescent rolls and put a little filling between some of the Fillo sheets.  It was wonderful.

Easy and definitely a crowd pleaser! I halved the sugar for filling and topping as others suggested and still very sweet.   I used regular vanilla extract and the 9x13 crescent roll "sheets".  I  baked bottom layer for 5 minutes before adding filling and top layer to avoid sogginess.  Next  time I'd like to spread topping to get a more even layer and avoid having too much sugar on any one piece.

Super easy and delicious. I never add the drizzled honey on top and still think it's spectacular.. I'd be concerned about it being too sweet with the addition of honey unless sugar is cut elsewhere

It was good. Make sure you soften the cream cheese, this makes it earlier to spread on first layer of crescent rolls.

It was super easy and delicious.  I used the single sheet crescent dough which made the layering much easier and instead of sugar I used Splenda.  It was delicious.

I am making again for a tailgate.

This was amazing! Made it for a football party today and it was a huge hit! I didn't have enough white sugar so I substituted with brown sugar (unpacked). I will be making this a lot! Oh,  I put honey on the side just in case someone didn't like honey or if it was sweet enough. But the honey was DA bomb!

This was a great change of pace, so to speak.  Next time I may try brushing the butter on top and then sprinkling the cin/sugar.  But that is all!  Will make again, for sure.

This recipe was a huge hit!!! I followed the suggestions of several reviewers and doubled the cinnamon, used 2 1/2 packages of cream cheese and 1 1/2 cups of sugar in the filling.
Everybody loved this!

Quick and easy recipe! Did make some minor changes though.  Used part skim ricotta cheese, instead of cream cheese, and cut down the amount of sugar.  Used 1/3 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup.   Lightly sprinkled cinnamon and sugar mixture across the top, again, using less sugar than recipe called for.  Will definitely make it again.

I first had this about three  years ago when a coworker brought it to a potluck.  I had to make a dessert tonight that would work for someone who doesn't eat chocolate and one that doesn't eat peanutbutter and remembered it and looked up the recipe.  I see making more of these in my future.  I kept the filling sugar the same but added an additional cream cheese.  I brushed it liberally with melted butter and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar (I made as much as the recipe called for, but didn't use quite all of it).  Baked for about 40 minutes and got great reviews.  I didn't find it too sweet at all, I thought it was pretty much perfect.  It was VERY easy to make and yielded good results.  we had a small potluck with three desserts and almost all of this was gone.

Great "go to" recipe for a quick dessert!  The simplicity of the flavors is what makes it good despite the canned crescent dough. I made it the same except for the cinnamon topping I melted the butter and blended with the cinnamon sugar and brushed it on the top. I can easily imagine adding blueberries or some kind of additional ingredient to make it a little more complex.  Very enjoyable as a morning pastry as well!

This is really really good...and I used fat free cream cheese and cut the recipe in half...since there are only two of us here.  I also used Splenda instead of sugar for the filling  and cut down on the sugar for the top.  Plan on making it for a crowd that will devour it the day you make it...the crescent roll part of it doesn't hold up well as a leftover the next day.

I didn't think this recipe measured up to the reviews...it had a "canned dough" flavor, so I think next time I would use puff pastry dough instead.  Also it was way too sweet. I would definitely reduce the sugar next time in order to increase the honey which is a classic sopapilla flavor, underrepresented in this recipe.  Having said that, my guests did seem to like it much more than I did.

Amazing. Made the first time exactly as written and found it to be too sweet - sickeningly so, and I'm a sugar fan. I cut back the sugar in the cream cheese filling to 3/4 cup and it was perfect the next time around. This dish tastes best after being refrigerated overnight. I love eating it cold straight out of the fridge.

My eleven year old grand daughter helped make this for our harvest crew. Easy Peay and everyone loved it! This  is a keeper. We didn't use the honey drizzle but cut fresh strawberries to serve on top . Yum.

Delicious Dessert! Every time with rave reviews from friends and family! 3 tips that I have found help out tremendously. 1) Pre-bake the bottom crust for 7 minutes before adding the filling. 2) Melt the butter and brush on the top crust (uses less butter and no "butter pools"). 3) Lessen the sugar in the topping to 1/2 cup or even less.

Absolutely wonderful and SO easy to make! This is going to become a regular for holidays and potlucks. I did add 1 cup of sour cream to add to the filling and tone down the sweetness. I also went a little lighter on the sugar for the top and heavier on the cinnamon.

Made this for a family party. I doubled the recipe to make 2, but added an extra block of cream cheese at the recommendation of others on here. I liked the extra filling and it cut the sweetness a bit. It was a huge hit with everyone.

Love this! I made it by the directions except I omitted the butter on top. I just sprinkled some cinnamon and and sugar on top and cooked it. I used low fat cream cheese and I used reduced fat crescent rolls. This was so good. I will definitely make again!!

Perfect! I did cut the butter down for the topping by almost half. Also, just a tip-the last 5-10 minutes of baking, spread the butter/cinnamon sugar mixture around a bit. Hells to keep the butter from pooling and makes the top look beautiful.  I also had to increase the baking time by 10 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!!

Used 3 pks of cream cheese as was suggested. Added an extra 1/4 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 c of sugar but 1 c  of sugar was enough. Baked for about 35 minutes til pastry puffed up and all butter was absorbed. Excellent and easy!

Great dessert! easy to make with the crescent roll sheets and I would not skimp on the honey as it adds a lot of flavor.  Will save recipe to make often!

I made this at work in a convection steam oven and the smell of it cooking made the whole showroom drool. It was gone in 5 minutes after it came out of the oven

I enjoyed this desert. It was easy to make and very delicious. I took it to work for a goodie table we were having, and everyone loved it. They asked for me to make it again one day soon. I would suggest to use less sugar if you are not really big on sweets. So next time I make this, I will use less sugar.

I made it exactly as written: simple recipe, easy to acquire ingredients, keeps well for a few days, and most importantly delicious! I took it to a Kentucky Derby party, cut into small bite-size pieces which everyone loved. I will use it as a dessert to have at home or take, and will try different toppings to change things up.

I made it exactly as written and it was fabulous. I did find it difficult to roll out the crescent rolls, but I used a store brand, which I will NEVER do again. Use the Pillsbury crescents - even better, use the crescent dough that isn't perforated. It was a huge hit - served it for brunch, like a cheese Danish. Because it is very rich I cut the pieces small, but people kept coming back for more and even asked if they could take some home. It was a HUGE hit.

I almost had to throw this away.  The cream cheese mixture inside was too runny, and it was too sweet. I thought it was too ugly to serve.

I switch the cream cheese to Ricotta and cut down on sugar then add an egg! What a classy dessert this makes. You could mix some cream cheese in if you like but the ricotta with egg and less sugar makes it just sweet enough and it's heavenly.

We make this all the time. All of my children can make it, even my very reluctant youngest son. We take it everywhere, and many people at the church's potluck dinner whine when we have the unmitigated gall to occasionally take something else. It's best after it cools. We have also added fruit pie filling. Yum. We keep the ingredients in the fridge at all times.

We love it and it's a constant request.  Only change I make is to melt the butter, spread over top, sprinkle cinn/sugar combination before putting in the oven.

Delicious and so easy! Followed the recipe exactly as written, though I did use the regular vanilla I had on hand. Also, I had to alter the cooking time. After thirty minutes the outside was very crisp but the middle was still raw dough. I put foil around the edges to keep it from burning and left it the over for about 10 more minutes, until the middle looked properly done. So glad I did! The edges weren't burnt at all..the crispy end pieces were just as good as the softer middle pieces! Will definitely be making this again.

Used regular vanilla (as I did not have Mexican vanilla on hand), and used a full 1/2 cup sugar in the topping instead of 3/4 cup.  Everything turned out amazing, and it was the biggest hit at work today - they told me to go home early to make more for them!  Very rich, so you can definitely cut more than 12 squares.  Will make again when I need a dessert to feed a lot.

Best desert ever. I only used half of the sugar in the filling. 
In addition I have made this with regular sugar and for the diabetics and my family I use Xylo sugar substitute for the filling, and a mixture of the Xylo and splenda brown baking sugar on top mix with cinnamon.  After the item called baking both ways as when I added the honey and I thought it was wonderful and my family raved over it.

This is standard for my Easter brunch that I make every year. There would be a rebellion if I left it off the menu. My recipe does not call for honey though.  Probably wouldn't hurt, just has enough sugar already that it doesn't need anymore after it's baked.

My family loves this dessert, and I love how easy it is to make!! It is definitley better chilled, so making it ahead of time is advised. I WAY reduce the sugar content. As written it would be sickeningly sweet. Reduce the sugar in the cream cheese to 2/3 cup. For the topping: Melt 1/4 cup of butter in the microwave and evenly distribute it over the top. Mix together 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 tsp of cinnamon, sprinkly evenly over the butter. Omit the honey. With these changes, it is PLENTY sweet!! UPDATE: this is SO GOOD served warm with vanilla ice cream.

This is OH SO Good!  Lovely warm, better chilled.  I did add an egg, as one reviewer suggested.  Truly addictive, and much, much easier to make than cheesecake, but has a true cheesecake vibe.  I highly recommend.

I don't use the honey and I top it with only half the amount of sugar/cinnamon mixture. It is plenty sweet. I've made this at least 20 times and get rave reviews every time!

Wonderful!  The only thing I did different was brush on melted butter and sprinkle in the cinnamon sugar so it would spread evenly.   It was a big hit!

So easy and a definite crowd pleaser.  Perfect for potlucks or other gatherings with lots of folks, as it does make quite a bit. Everyone wanted this recipe after they ate it!

Will definitely make again!

OMG this is fantastic!  I've never rated any recipe but I made this tonight & everyone was eating it hot out of the oven. I did take other suggestions: I used 2 & 1/2 - 8 oz cream cheeses. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also put the bottom rolls in the oven for 9 minutes, then spread the cream cheese mixture. I melted the butter for the top & mixed 1/2 cup sugar & cinnamon & brushed it on the top. It baked for 45 minutes. I'll definitely be making this again & again. Thank you!

This was very good. I made it as described except I used a copycat Pillsbury Cresent Roll dough & I didn't put the honey on top after it baked. I will certainly made this again.

This is amazingly yummy plus it is easy and inexpensive to make.  My family loved it at Thanksgiving and I am making 2 for Christmas (I only got one small piece last time and there were only 7 people eating lol) It's our families new, must have, holiday dessert.
The only thing I did differently was add a bit more filling to it so there was more cheesecake flavor.

This is great! I made it half with honey drizzled on top and half without & can't decide between the two. Both are amazing! I refrigerated it and ate it cold the next day and now I can't decide if I like it better cooled out of the oven or chilled like a cheesecake. I may be leaning more towards cold! Mine was super gooey at 30 minutes; I definitely had to bake for 40 minutes if not a bit more than that. It was such a hit I made it for 2 potlucks in 1 week. I was asked for the recipe which is always a great sign! Thanks for the amazing recipe.

Yes to both! Added mini chocolate chips, another time used a layer of carmel sheets,the kind that go on apples. Used a strawberry sauce over chip one and a dark chocolate sauce on the other .

Made for a potluck at work - got lots of rave reviews. Didn't use the honey on top though. I couldn't believe it tasted so good, when it uses canned crescent rolls... but there is no trace of that fake processed taste the rolls can have. 

I found it kind of mushy after it sat on the counter and got warm... so keep it cold if possible! It's a nice shortcut for traditional cheesecake when you don't want all the hassle. This one is going into the "keeper" cookbook!

It was tasty. Next time I'll use half of the honey because after it sits over night the full amount makes it really sweet.

I did not expect it to be such a hit. I made it to take to a party. My husband wasn't so sure about it the way it looked but then he tasted it and then said lets just keep it home for us to eat and not take it to the party :). We took it anyway and people could not stop eating it. Everybody devoured it. 
Based on many other comments I did reduce the sugar. I added a little over 3/4th cup for the cream cheese mixture and a little over 1/2 cup for the topping.  I didn't measure the honey but just drizzled some over the top to cover most parts lightly. It was fantabulous and just the right amount of sweet. Any more would've been too sweet. 
My husband was a little sad that there was nothing left to take back home.

Very good. Did not like it much at room temp, but after being refrigerated overnight...fantastic. I mistakenly only used 3/4 cup sugar in the cheesecake mixture, but was still good. I will use the full cup next time. Also didn't have and couldn't find Mexican vanilla, so had to use regular. I'd like to try it with the Mexican vanilla though. I, like a few others, had a little pooling of the butter, so I left it in the oven a little longer. Most of the pools dissipated, but the few small areas that were left I actually found to be my favorite pieces after it was refrigerated.

How can you go wrong with butter, sugar, cream cheese, and biscuits?! This was amazing!! I added a little cinnamon to the cream cheese (like 1t), I also followed the advice of another review & baked the bottom layer for about 5 min before spreading cream cheese mixture. Lastly, I used 1/4c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar on top.
All-in-all, this will definitely be a permanent recipe for me :-)

We just ate a piece. It is extremely sweet. I would reduce all sugar by 1/2. And let it cool all the way down for the cream cheese to harden back up, or refrigerate it until cool.  It really is a wonderful easy recipe to make.  If you want more of a cheesecake feel to it - you could add a 3rd box of cream cheese.  Don't forget to spray pan with Pam spray. You don't have to cook the crust seperately do it exactly like the recipe. Cook for full 30 minutes. It will shock you because it comes out really soft and you think it's not completely cooked, but it is. Just let it cool down to harden up. Give it a try you'll be pleased. My family really like it!

This was served warm with coffee after a long day.  It is a sweet dessert, but the creamy cheesecake filling paired with the cinnamony crescent roll crust was just really good.  You could tweak the sugar and honey, but why mess with a good thing.

I have been making this recipe for years for pot lucks. I have people request this dessert all the time. Changes I would suggest. Add 1 more package of cream cheese, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 cup sugar and one more package of crescent roll so that you have two layers of this dessert. Enjoy!

This was good, nothing great, and turned out very thin, I would double the filling next time. I definitely would not use "cheesecake" in the description, just because something has cream cheese in the recipe does not automatically garner being called a cheesecake! :) Also, the crescent rolls kept pulling apart, which was frustrating, but it did turn out fine. Good flavor, but like I said, nothing special, not sure I would make this again. Sorry.

My go-to recipe for parties and guests! Very simple and doesn't take much effort to make but creates a delicious outcome! I modified the recipe slightly by using 1/2 cup sugar, 3 tbsp butter and 4 tbsp sugar for topping, and occasionally two layers of crescent rolls for the bottom layer.

I took this recipe to a company picnic and it got rave reviews.  It was easy prepare, followed the recipe exactly and no need to fuss about getting the dough exactly pressed.  Came out just fine. The last piece went home with one of the guys who thought it would be great for breakfast.  I thought that was a good idea too and have made it for guests as a breakfast treat.  Enjoy.

I've made this many times and always get rave reviews. I made it for a work bake sale and it was gone within minutes. Definitely a tasty dessert for the little effort it takes to make.

Easy recipe, delicious, and a crowd-pleaser... though I hated to confess how I'd made it.  Also a bit too sweet for my taste.  A keeper, and handy in a pinch, but not fine cuisine!

If I could give this more than five stars, I would.  This is delicious!! I probably gained ten pounds from it. The first time I made it, I forgot the honey on top. It doesn't even need it, it was amazing without it!

Followed the ingredient proportions to a T! Read the majority of the reviews and I can see how people would think you would need to cut down on the glaze. But I loved it and so did my guests. You will probably need to bake longer and just make sure to get the edges! I also had some left over for the next day and it wasn't as wonderful. So definitely make the day of.

Update** I also undercooked this dish (about 35 min)  just to see and it still tastes wonderful!

Oh . I just made it and cut a little corner test piece.....and another test piece, and another.....it's absolutely delicious! I didn't add the honey, I think anymore sweetness would be too much. Delicioso!

This recipe is so amazingly easy and delicious!  I have been asked for the recipe everytime I take this to a pot luck.  I made it for dinner with some friends and one of the husband's said it was "so good he could eat it until he got sick from it".

Too much sugar and not enough cinnamon on top. I followed the Pillsbury recipe afterwards and it was almost perfect. 1/2 cup sugar on topping with a tablespoon of cinnamon. 

PS... it's really good when it has been set out of the oven for 20 minutes! Just as good chilled too.

Oh my gosh, this recipe amazed me! It was SOO easy, my 3 1/2 year old nephew helped me make it and it turned out delicious! The only thing we did differently, is instead of using honey on top, each serving was topped with a big scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, YUM!!! Everyone loved it, it was gone in no time!!

Great dessert that goes further than 12 servings at my house.  Very rich and very sweet.  Easy to make and the flavorings can be adjusted to your own preference.  I add more cinnamon and vanilla.

I hate this recipe...........because it is so easy! I love to cook, 3-4 hour recipes are a joy, but this is always such a darn hit I swallow my culinary pride and buy the  Pillsbury dough. Secret to this is to chill thoroughly before serving. Also I double the cream cheese and add an egg for stability. For the holidays try mixing in some pumpkin pie filling or swirl with the preserve of your choice.  you, Pillsbury for being so easy!!

This is the second time I'm making this. The only thing I changed, both times, was the amount of sugar. We're not fans of super sweet stuff so I only add 1/3 cup to the cream cheese mixture and 1/3 cup to the topping. Both times, my family devoured this tasty little cake. Yummalicious!!! Thanks so much for sharing this!

I've made this multiple times and everyone lives and requests this. The only thing I do that other reviews recommend, is to increase the filling to 3 blocks cream cheese and 1 1/2 cups sugar. To fix the butter pooling that others commented on, I open oven 20 minutes in and using a spoon, re-distribute over top, which fixes it without removing it. Very yummy, and good even if you don't have honey.

Sooooooo good! I have made this more times than I can count! The last few times, I added one egg to the cream cheese mixture. Gives more of a cheesecake flavor in the center & made me love the recipe even more!!!

We loved this recipe.  It was a big hit.  I used regular vanilla and it was too much butter on the top, so next time I'll cut it back to about 1/4 c.  I also found the crescent roll dough in a full sheet instead of the can for individual rolls, so that worked out great.  I've already passed this along to all my friends.  A must try for sure and a keeper.

Sopapilla Cheesecake Pie--really good if seriously sweet and sugary is your desert goal. These were still rich, sweet and sugary and I substituted Neufchâtel for the cream cheese, and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup each time it is listed. I could have eaten the entire bowl of the cream cheese layer all by myself--but I didn't. In addition to the Neufchâtel and less sugar, i omitted the honey drizzle. Next time, I'm cutting the sugar just alittle more and melting the butter for more better coverage of the topping. I live at high altitude so the next time I will bake it at 375 degrees, my bottom layer was a tad doughy so I need a higher temp or a longer baking time. This is a gorgeous looking, yummy desert for any occasion.

This has made my top ten favorites in desserts, I made this with my own crust and since I had no cinnamon I substituted for coconut flakes in crust topping. My family lived it!

This is one of the best desserts I've ever had!  Best served while warm!  I can't understand why anyone would give this recipe anything less than 5 stars!  Yum!

I've made this twice now and both times turned out delish! The second time I didn't bother rolling out the crescents, it was just extra work since it cooks together anyway! Love this recipe for parties.

Learn from my fail: make sure your cheese filling is very smooth and spreadable.   Mine was still pretty cool when I attempted to spread it over the bottom dough, and it wouldn't spread.  It tore holes in the dough, so I had to gently press it into place with my hands.  The top layer of dough covered it, and you couldn't even tell in the finished product.  This got more positive feedback than just about anything I have ever made for the family, and that is high praise, because I went out on a limb when I served this.  Serving anything other than chocolate is taking your life in your own hands with our crowd!  I will be making this one again....with a well-softened filling, of course.

I love cheesecake so I figured these would fit the craving. They were pretty good and I would make them again. HOWEVER, they seemed to have a way too much butter because after I baked them the melted butter pooled on top of the crescent dough which was kinda gross. I did half the recipe and used a 8x8 pan, so maybe this was the root of the problem, but I find that hard to believe. After the bars cooled the butter soaked in. I don't mind a lot of butter in a recipe if it fits its purpose. I would probably use half the butter dotted on top next time.  You could probably get away with skipping it altogether and just sprinkling the top with cinnamon-sugar to save on calories.

Great recipe. Only thing I changed was to omit the honey on top. Way sweet enough without it, Took it to a work luncheon and got great reviews and many requests for recipe. Does take alittle longer to cook and it will look very brown but it will not be overdone. Awesome. Thank you.

Delicious! Made this for a Cinco de Mayo dinner and it was a big hit. Like others have recommended I used the seamless crescent rolls, precooked the bottom crust for 5-7 mins, melted & brushed the butter on the top crust, and decreased the sugar on top. So good!

So easy and VERY popular! It's so popular I have a little laminated tag I put with it that lists the ingredients (for people with allergies, etc) and a QR code that links to the recipe! That way, if people want the recipe, they just scan the tag and away they go!

You can double this and make it in a half-sheet size cake pan if you're cooking for a crowd. I always use a bit more vanilla, cinnamon and honey than is called for and it's always a hit.

**HINT** use the crescent roll dough made for recipes that's uncut if you can get it. It makes this even easier. I sometimes have problems with the triangles coming apart on the regular dough.

Great recipe! Next time I make this I'll cut down on the amount of sugar sprinkled with the cinnamon on top, I think 1/4 cup will suffice.

We've been making this recipe for 30 years or more in my family and LOVE IT.  It does seem like a lot of butter on top, but after baking and eating, you'll understand why.  ****Have never used honey.

It was very, very easy to make, but I think I would leave the honey off next time.  I put it on before serving, after it had cooled, and maybe that was a mistake.  I probably should have added it while it was still hot?  but it made it too sweet and sticky.  I will make it again.

Unbelievable!  The only thing wrong with this recipe is the cooking time - I had to cook it twice as long as noted in the recipe.  It is absolutely heavenly.

Oh My Gosh!!  This stuff is amazing.  Several people asked me for the recipe.  The only thing that I did differently was brush the top pastry layer with melted butter and then sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture evenly across.  If you place pieces of the mixture on top the butter tends to pool.

Made a half recipe. Worked fine except for the pooling of butter on top. Just cooked extra time and tipped the pan to spread the topping out a couple times. MUCH better refrigerated.  Next time I will brush top with butter then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar on.

This is hands down one the best desserts I've had. And a I am repeatedly asked to make it for parties and get togethers. An absolute crowd pleaser. I think it was best after it had been refrigerated, but it really is delicious either way.

Brought this to a Super Bowl party and guests raved about it! I didn't have a rolling pin on hand so just had to pinch the crescent roll dough together - but this still turned out wonderful! Will add five minutes cooking time in the future - center pieces were too loose at the end.

Thank you so much for the recipe! i cooked a mexican meal for a friend, and it was great to have a dessert to match! I felt like the cream cheese flavor was really strong, so I would only make this if you are a big cream cheese lover. Changes: I added cinnamon to the cream cheese mix, i reduced the butter to 3/4 a stick, and i reduced the sugar on top to 1/2 cup.

I've made this a handful of times now and every time it's a huge crowd pleaser. Just made it again for the Super Bowl this past weekend. People love these and can't stop raving about them! The only thing I did differently is I didn't put the honey on top (I forgot) and when I mentioned it to my guests they said they didn't think it needed anything at all. Looks just like they do in the pictures.

I think this is so tasty and pretty simple to make.  I had heard of a similar recipe, so what I did different was to mix only about 1/4 cup of sugar and the cinnamon and sprinkle on top of the final crescent roll layer.  I also put some sliced almonds on top of that for a nice crunch. Then I melted the butter(I used salted, but think I will try unsalted next time) and poured it over top; then in the oven to bake.  Very good--got rave reviews!

Made this for a Mexican Themed Dinner Club meeting. It was such a big hit. Everyone wanted to know where I got the recipe. Have made it twice more for parties at people's request. Even non cheesecake lovers like this recipe!

I originally tried this at a baby shower over a year ago and long searched for the recipe to make it myself. I would have never dreamed that it was so simple to make!! I used low-fat cream cheese and it worked just as well as regular. The cooking time in my oven was 25 minutes and as mentioned by other reviewers this is absolutely incredible when served the next day, well chilled. :)

Loved this added Raspberry jam on top of the cream cheese filling and omg instant raspberry danish. So easy to make, these will be my new go to Thanksgiving morning breakfast. 
Recipe note:
Made it this last time with a can of apple pie filling and chopped walnuts on top of cream cheese  mixture. My new favorite way to have this. Baked it an extra 10-15 minutes.

Hubby loved this. it's delish, easy substitue if you're craving cheesecake, but don't want the fuss. It was a bit too sweet for my taste, though. I think I may omit the honey, or cut the sugar in half next time. Definitely doesn't need all that sugar plus honey. Also, I used regular vanilla extract and it was fine. I'm waiting for my new rolling pin to arrive in the mail, so I just stretched and pressed down the dough with my hands, and it turned out fine.

This recipes is so wonderful and so easy, I don't know how anyone could not like it! My go-to recipe for potlucks, teacher lunches, etc... I can't think of any recipe you could make that would be easier and less expensive that would get the rave reviews this dish gets everywhere I take it!

Grown men in my office almost went to blows over this one.  I've never seen anything like it.  Seriously, one guy sneaked out 2 pieces and hid them for later.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I wish I had made more.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I just drizzled the honey over the top when I took it out of the oven.  I'm guessing not near 1/4 cup.  Also, I had to cook it closer to 40 minutes to get the center to puff up.  OH, and I assembled the crescent rolls with the cream cheese the night before, and added the butter/sugar/cinnamon and cooked the next morning.  That worked well. DELISH!  Enjoy.

I have made this recipe a few times and there is never any left over.  I even brought it to a potluck at which there were several other really schmancy baked items from some high-end boutique bakeries.  This stuff was still the biggest hit!  Note that I have tried it with low-fat crescent rolls and it tastes great, but I don't think the dough rolls as easily/thinly so I used a smaller dish.  Also, I don't add the honey.  I'm sure that would be delicious, but I think it is sweet enough without it.

So yummy, especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Drizzle plenty of honey on top while it's still warm and it seeps into the whole cheesecake. Everyone loved it and begged for the recipe!

This was disgustingly sweet as is. In my opinion, there is just WAY too much sugar in it. And I like sweets, so that's saying a lot. I will be looking through other reviews and modifications, but I will be cutting way back on the sugar.

I've made this recipe several times now and it never let's me down! I use plain vanilla instead of Mexican vanilla extract and occasionally, I make my own crescent dough from scratch. Quick, easy, and oh so delicious! Thanks for posting ;)

Attempt #1. After defrosting I had the cream cheese with absolutely changed consistence. It was not creamy, but watery and very grainy. Thus I didn't expect that I would cook anything great from it. Anyway I determined to bake sopapilla cheesecake. Here are those alternations I made to cook it: 1. I beat the defrost cream cheese very well in order to get rid of all these grains. It was in vain. It's just impossible to get rid of them completely. It does not matter. 2. Blended it with 1 cup (120 g) of powdered sugar, vanilla, 1 egg and 1/4 cup of cornstarch. . It was still very liquid. Whatever. 3. Poured this medley on the piece of flaky pastry put in 9x13 cake pan (just regular 1-2-3 pastry). I didn't cover my pie with another piece of flaky dough, cause the filling was very liquid due to this defrost cream cheese. So I put neither butter nor sugar over it. I just threw it into the oven for about 50 minutes. In the end I got the extremely delicious dessert, my dad said he had never eaten anythng better. No doubts it was not a true sopapilla cheesecake, but it was quite a good way to get rid of this cream cheese. Will do it again with fresh cream cheese.

Delicious! I also had to keep it in the oven an extra 15min. It is so easy to make & will be a family favorite. I added extra vanilla extract & cinnamon. It turned out perfect.

It was delicious and super easy to make! I didn't have Mexican vanilla so I just used regular vanilla extract and left out the honey. Also, 1/2 cup of butter was too much and made the crust a little too gooey. I will use less butter next time.

I made this for my son's class party in Spanish class. It was a hit. It is a very tasty recipe. Someone else brought the same recipe but everyone ate mine instead of the other recipe. I think because it wasn't cut to serve. So I learned a new lesson, if you want some to bring home, do not cut. (:

I made this once for a whole-family meal, and now it is requested for every single holiday! I think the honey at the end is unnecessary, but add it if you like. It gets devoured, regardless!

Great as is! I usually make half if just for the 5 of us, a full batch is more like a potluck portion.

This is one of our favorite desserts, and so easy to make. I cut the amount of cream cheese and sugar in half. It tastes just as good with fewer calories. Also you can cut the butter by quite a bit and it's still just as yummy! Oh,and also try serving it with Blue Bunny Carmel Praline Crunch ice cream. : )

It was okay.  Based on the ratings I thought this was going to be WOW!  The crust was a little soggy and the cheesecake didn't really have much taste

I was looking for a mexican-style dessert and stumbled on this! I'm not a great cook, but this was super easy for me. Instead of rolling out the dough, I just pressed the edges of the crescent rolls together. This turned out perfectly without all the mess of rolling!

This recipe tastes amazing. I tried some when it was still a bit warm (couldn't wait!) and it tasted great! It gets even better when it's cold. I served it to my family, they don't particularly like cinnamon or honey, but they adored this cheese cake. Several friends have asked for the recipe.

All in all, this is very easy to make (even for amateurs) and tastes sooo good.

Very easy and very good!  It reminds me of a cream cheese croissant!  All three of my boys love it, which, when does that ever happen?  I will certainly make it again.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, although I didn't bother to roll out the layers of crescent roll dough . . . I just pressed the seams together.  To save time, on the top layer of dough, I spread some Land O Lakes Light Butter and then sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top of the butter (I didn't end up using all the cinnamon/sugar either, so I'll save that for next time).  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese for the filling.  Next time I will halve the filling components just to lessen the calories some more.  This was also excellent as a cheese danish/pastry the next morning.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This was pretty good.  I didn't go to all the work of using a rolling pin on the crescent rolls.  Just fit them into the pan and pinched together; did the same with the top layer.  I used all of the honey as written and it soaked in well.  The dessert looked great.  I'm not personally a huge cream cheese fan, but I did get a request for the recipe.

easy and excellent.  Better to sprinkle mixture with finger tips for a more even spread.  Also no need to roll our crescents.

I tasted this at a church potluck recently...when I saw the little squares on the table I wasn't really sure what they were, I actually thought it was some kind of bread pudding. Well, thank goodness I picked one up...one bite and I was AMAZED! I searched around asking who made this dessert, in dire need of the recipe! I couldn't believe when I heard it was made with just crescent rolls, cream cheese and a few more simple ingredients. This dessert tastes like it should have been complicated and taken a long time to make. I was thrilled to be told this recipe could be found on allrecipes and it was so simple. Thank you for sharing this amazing dessert with us! These little bites of cheesecake heaven make this world a better place...truly one of the best desserts I've ever tasted. It's perfectly cheesy and sweet, almost a mix between cheese danish and cheesecake. I can't say enough about this recipe...if anyone has never tried this just make it...now! You won't be disappointed!

The first time I made it I thought it was too much work using the crescent rolls...it was hard to roll the dough out... so I used Pillsbury Crescent Recipe Creations Refrigerated Seamless dough, it is alot easier to roll out, especially if your making more than one recipe which I always end up doing!!!
I do not use any honey because it is sweet enough!!! I also use less melted butter because it tends to “puddle” on top of the crescent roll dough.

This is so easy and so good. I took out a little sugar, and used a little less of everything. I did use Mexican vanilla, I think it changes the taste a bit.

I have made it twice now and it is one of our families favorite recipes.  I took it to work and it was gone almost instantly!
I followed it true to the recipe and it was perfect.  Some reviews recommend 3 pkgs of cream cheese but I think it would be too much filling. But you MUST drizzle the honey as it adds such nice flavor.  I find it hard to find the crescent sheets BUT I did find a new crescent roll package (Pillsbury) that makes larger crescent rolls - it's a 12 oz package VS. an 8 oz and I will use that from now on as I like the added crust volume.  No need to roll out the dough, just pat the triangles into the pan - one can for the bottom and one for the top and with the larger size can just tear any of the extra dough into pieces and just randomly place it around on top of the dough layers.

This is very good and very easy. I have 4 teenage boys and a husband so no need to take this to a pot luck - It gets devoured instantly if I don't intervene. I have used a organic raw sugar and the large crystals of the raw sugar adds a nice and noticeable texture to the topping. Thanks and thanks to those that take the time to review.

This was so easy.  There is a similar recipe, also on allrecipes.com and that  one used 3 packages of cream cheese w/ 1.5 cups of sugar.  Thinking that I wanted  a little thicker filling, that's what I did.  I also used only about 1/8 cup of honey on top.  I was afraid it would be too sweet. That worked well and I think I will continue to do that.  This is fabulous.

I made this today with my some kids in a cooking class I do.  It was delicious!  I would use just a little less butter on the topping, but that is it.  We even ate them without the honey.  We did drizzle some chocolate syrup on some of them :)

All the high ratings are true!! Made this for a potluck at work and it got rave reviews.  It was really easy to make and I followed the recipe as written, including the honey.  Will be making this again very soon.  These little squares are addictive!

I'm glad I read the reviews and let it bake longer than 30 minutes. It took a good 40 minutes and it did look very brown but was perfect. I used reduced fat crescent rolls and reduced fat cream cheese as well as light butter. It was super rich, couldn't imagine the full fat version. The honey really made it sweet and decadent.

Made this for my husband who likes to take a sweet in his lunch box every day,  Didn't know where to find Mexican vanilla so I used plain vanilla extract.  He ate the ENTIRE dish pretty much himself!  I had a couple tiny pieces as I'm very careful about what I eat.  It was hard though because this is SO yummy!!  When it got down to a couple pieces left, he suggested that it may be time to make another one. :)

This recipe was SUPER easy to make and the ingredients were very common items - nothing exotic.  I took it to a church meal last evening and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Agree that less butter was needed.  We tried honey or caramel ice cream topping and most preferred the caramel but that is a personal taste decision.

I really liked these bars and so did my kids. It was so easy. Sometimes when you use crescent rolls in recipes it all tastes the same but you couldn't tell that these were made with the rolls.  I didn't use the honey as I don't care for it and thought that it make the bars too mushy. I cut them in smaller pieces and ended up with 24 bars

I liked this for how easy it was to make (I made it before church so it was ready for lunch); minus one star because it was too sweet, but I realize that is always subject to opinion.

OMG! This is wonderful.  Just be sure to use real butter and vanilla.  Taste is everything.  I also used the Pillsburgy Crescent sheets which made it easy.  I had multiple people ask for the recipe!

Yummy recipe.  Everyone at the party last night loved this pie.  I rolled the crescent rolls between 2 sheets of waxed paper to get to the size of the glass baking dish.  I made the pie the day before and refrigerated overnight, then drizzled with honey before serving.

Made this for a large family gathering, it was so very easy and very delicious!!! I did forget to drizzle the honey on it and it was still delish! Everyone at party thought so too, got lots of compliments. I am known for my cheesecakes at family get togethers and this is one of the favorites! (happily it is also the easiest for me!!) Definately will be making again and again...

I had heard from several people at work how good this recipe tasted, so I decided to look it up and make it for our Super Bowl Party.  It was a hit!  Everyone loved it!  The only thing that I changed was the baking time.  It took 45 minutes in my oven.  This will become part of my repertoire for desserts, thank you for sharing!!

Delicious!  Made it for the first time to take it to a ladies Bible study and everyone raved about it.  So simple to make.  I used regular vanilla instead of Mexican.  And you can now buy the crescent rolls in sheets also, so no rolling is required.  Would be easy to half the recipe too because the sheets are perferrated in half.  Mine took about 10 mins longer to bake.  Best if eaten soon after making, while the topping is still a little crunchy.  So yummy!

I used seamless crescent dough for top and bottom. followed suggestions to cut the sugar and add an extra package of cream cheese in the filling. I did not do the honey on top. Delicious!

I made two pans for one party.  There weren't as many people there as I thought there would be, but the 10 people ate one whole pan, loving every bite.  The second pan I had my husband take to work the next day and 3 people at the whole thing - cold!  They loved it that way as well.  So this is a delicious recipe hot or cold.  I didn't want it in the house because there are way too many calories in it!

received many compliments!
was able to found the crscent baking sheets so i lucked out there.
i prebaked the bottom crust for 8 mins in the oven and whipped the cream cheese mixture while that cooled.
changes i made: used 3 packs of cream cheese-could have got away with 2-2.5 i thought it was too much cream cheese. i also added 1 egg to the cream cheese mixture.
i brushed the butter on the top crust them sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar mixture all over. i didn't use it all bu ti think in the end it could have used a bit more. this recipe is a winner and it can def be tweaked depending on your tastes. everyone loved it will def make again

Everyone LOVED this and its very easy.

I didn't make any changes to the ingredients - except I didn't have Mexican vanilla and used regular.

Its very rich and sweet so I think I cut this in about 24 or so pieces.

Its also much better refrigerated for awhile after it cools - and easier to cut.

I had to bake mine about 45 minutes.  At 30 minutes, there was still butter pooled on the top and it wasn't very browned.  A few more minutes browned it a little more and let the butter cook in.

Oh my gosh!  I can't believe I waited so long to make this. My husband loved it and he is not a big fan of cheesecake.  I did reduce the sugar to 3/4C and also reduced the butter used for the top.  I also added an egg.  I know I should not rate the recipe before making it as written but I really don't think the recipe can be bad any way you make it. After making it, I found that 1/2 c of butter is too much. I reduced amount to 1/4c melted it and brushed it on top. Reduce the sugar to 1/2c and 1 tsp of cinnamon. Delicious!

Fantastic. I made some modifcations. I just sprinkled the top with cinamon and sugar (used dramatically less that the recipe called for) and then I melted 1/4 cup of butter and drizzeled it on top.  Also I omitted the honey topping and used homemade salted carmel whiskey sause. It was devine. Very nice deseret. flavorful, textured, and not overly sweet. This combo is magical. Sweet salty cheesey cinamon goodness.

My family and I loved it!!! I didn't use all of the sugar mixture on top because I thought it would have made it too sweet so I only used half. I made it for Thanksgiving and it has been requested that I make it for Christmas!

This is quite a rich dish. My husband LOVED it. I followed the recipe exactly as written and when the butter began to pool on top I just tipped the dish so it went down the sides. It worked really nicely as the edges got sticky and sweet. I will make this again.

This was fantastic. I didn't have Mexican Vanilla so I doubled my normal vanilla to 2 tsp. I also bake mine longer, could just be difference in ovens, but just keep my eye on it until it is browned. HUGE HIT! Everyone always gobbles this up and asks for the recipe. Thank you!

This is absolutely simple and delicious! I have made this recipe over a dozen times and it is always a crowd favorite. My children LOVE it and even request it during special occasions. I would highly recommend this recipe. By the way, I just use plain vanilla extract (because that is what I have available in my pantry)and it tastes great!

This was amaaaaaaazing!  I added one little ingredient .... Some butterscotch apple dip.  I marbled it into the cream cheese mixture. Just a little individual portion size. I will be making this again and again.  Our guests loved it too and asked for the recipe.

This recipe is fabulous! I have made it several times, and it's now my go-to for carry-ins. Easy and I haven't found one person who hasn't loved it! I don't ever change anything exceptIhave made it with low fat ingredients and loved it just as much!

O to the M to the G!!!  This recipe leaves nothing to be desired.  Prepare it exactly as listed, watch it in the oven, and you cannot go wrong!  If using a metal pan either cut a few minutes off the cooking time or lower the temp to 325 degrees.  This was the star at our Thanksgiving dinner!

My family LOVED this dessert!! I have made it a few times now and I have made some changes since there is way to much sugar in this recipe. I used 2/3 C sugar and added a little cinnamon to the cream cheese mixture. Also I melted 1/3 stick of butter and brush it on the the top. Then sprinkle 1/4 C cinnamon sugar mixture on top. I did make a pumpkin version as well which was a hit at Thanksgiving! I added 1/3 C pumpkin puree, 2 1/2 blocks cream cheese, and added allspice. The rest was the same as above. It was amazing!

Did not use the honey - it's not needed.  This has a LOT of butter which pools down into the low spots, but that's part of what makes it so delish.  Don't cut the butter.  Seriously, cutting the butter is not going to make this recipe healthy.  I refrigerated for several hours before cutting and had no problem.  Took it to work the next day.  One of my co-workers said "I think I've died and gone to heaven."

These are great as is, but I make a few changes. I bake on a Jelly Roll Pan. I don't roll out the dough, smashing it down with your hands gets it thin enough. It does not have to be perfect! Also, the drizzled honey makes this have more of a sopapilla flavor, however, I have noticed if you allow the honey to absorb you lose that flavor. It is less sticky/messy and retains flavor if you dip the warm pieces into the honey.

AMAZING!! We are cheesecake lovers at our house and the recipe is tasty, quick, and easy. My son has requested this for his birthday cake again this year! I can't blame him. I would probably eat this all by myself if my husband and kids wouldn't protest.

Very yummy - was all eaten up at the event I took it too. I didn't alter it at all the first time I made  it and I don't think I'll make any changes next time, either!

This is very, very good. The only thing is I think you should cook the bottom for a few minutes before adding the cream cheese mixture, then continue as the recipe states. Its super good, but the bottom was a little more moist then I expected.

I have taken this recipe to many different gatherings and everyone always loves it. I mean LOVES it! I am actually on this page to print the recipe yet again for some people, I get asked for it so often it's just amazing. yum I did use 4 pks of cream cheese and pretty much the same ingredients on the rest.

Lovely treat.  Served cold.  Interestly, it cuts nicely the next day and tasted great.   I think it would be wonderful warm, will try it that way next time.   I drizzled some honey over the top, but probably only used 1.5 tablespoons, not 1/c. cup.  That seemed like plenty.

This recipe's ratings are well-deserved! I ordered Mexican vanilla specifically for this recipe. I don't know how much difference it made, but this was one of the best desserts I have ever had.  The cheesecake filling is absolutely out of this world. Thank you so much CandelB for posting this and thanks to all for rating it highly.  Now let's see what else the Mexican vanilla will be fabulous in.

I brought this into work today and I can't even begin to count the raves it received.  Easy to make and delicious to eat. I know I will use this recipe often.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. Only thing I did different was I used 1/2 cup sugar in the topping and since I really do not like honey, I did not use that.  Thank you for sharing this!

Really good recipe. I halved the recipe for the filling and it provided just the right amount. I also cut the crescent dough into circles (imagine ravioli) for easier handling at a work potluck. Everyone loved them and I would definitely make them again.

Oh my goodness!  Just wonderful!  This one is a keeper - nothing but rave reviews from everyone that tasted it! Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  Next time I might cut back a little on the butter topping as I had to cook it a bit longer to get the valleys to cook through.  I think 1/3 cup butter verses a 1/2 cup would be plenty to get the job done.  But even with cooking it longer - but it turned out wonderful! Easy enough for a beginning baker to be a rockstar!

I've made this several times now and EVERYONE loves them. This is what I call a true No Fail recipe...perfect every time!!
Great while still a little bit warm/room temp or after refrigeration.
You will want to make this for company or to take and share...otherwise...expect to be nipping away at it...til gone!!
Thank you sooo much for sharing :)))

This is by far one of my favorite desserts! I did think this one came out a bit too sweet so I'll be cutting back the sugar next time and using more cream cheese instead. And a little less sugar on top. Overall a fantastic recipe! Can't wait to make it around the holidays!

I have made this several times and everyone I have made it for loves it!  It is a simple recipe that can be pulled together quickly.  I like to serve it warm as others have suggested.  I don't add the honey automatically, I offer it as a topping option as well as the choice of hot fudge sauce and whip cream and caramel sauce is also a great addition...delish!!

Almost ruined this completely when I accidentally put double the required amount of butter.  I realized halfway through baking when there was a pool of butter in the middle of the pan.  I took out the pie and carefully spooned out half a cup of butter and managed to salvage it.  Tasted awesome.  Of those who ate it most preferred it chilled.

Awesome dessert.  A real crowd pleaser and oh so easy to make.  I had some problems rolling out the crescent roll dough but that was probably my lack of skill.

Absolutely DELISHOUS!!  No need to change a thing.  The worst part about this recipe is there is never any leftovers.  If you take this anywhere, make sure you also take some copies of the recipe because everyone will want it!

These were a huge hit at a recent party I had. Even my son-in-law, who is quite picky, LOVED these. They were all gone before some of us even got a chance at them! Definitely consider them for a make ahead finger dessert.

The first couple of bites tasted delicious, but after that it was just too rich for our tastes and I ended up throwing most of it out. It's just a matter of taste I guess and if you don't mind super rich deserts than this one is for you.

OMG! This was awesome! So easy too.  I made one small change-after reading reviews I cut butter in topping in half.  Didn't miss it a bit.  I'm wondering how a drizzle of chocolate glaze instead of the honey would be (?) next time.  This will go into my "go to" dessert file for sure!

Yum!  If you like cheesecake, you'll like this.  The cinnamon sugar topping was pretty sweet, but everyone loved it.  I liked it warm better than cold.  Tastes sort of like a cheese danish but with extra sugar on top.

This is crazy good! I made it the first time just like the recipe said and it was to die for. The second time I cut the sugar for both the topping and the filling in half and used only 1 and a half packages of cream cheese. I also cut the butter in half. It was still delicious! My husband didn't even know I made all the changes. This is hid favorite special occasion dessert. I do feel the need to run a mile after eating one bar just knowing what is in it. But it's worth it!

I brought this to a Cinco de Mayo themed party and it was the only plate that was empty by the end of the night. Followed the recipe exactly as written but just drizzled a little bit of honey (probably about 1/8 of a cup) all over the top and it was the perfect amount. Everyone kept asking me for the recipe--if only they knew how easy it was:)

OMG these bars are fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly, used reduced fat cream cheese and crecent rolls but couldn't taste it at all.  Just becareful, they are more addictive than pistachios!

Wow...I read all the reviews and couldn't wait to make this..it was so easy and absolutely delicious!!  I had just cut into it when when my 15 yr. old son came come from the movies with 3 friends.  They smelled the cinnamon aroma and asked to try it.  After one bite, all of them begged me to send this recipe to their moms to make!  This will definitely be my new signature dish to bring to gatherings. :)
p.s. I made no modifications as I believe a recipe should be made as listed to rate properly.  Only thing I will do differently next time is use a little less sugar...maybe reduce it by 1/4 cup in filling.

I cannot rave about this recipe enough. I made this as a snack for a get together and every single person who tried it raved about how it was one of the best desserts they had ever had. Weeks later, I still hear about how good it was and get asked when I'll make it again.

Brought this in to work for Cinco de Mayo.  I didn't have any, but from what I hear it was the best ever.  To the point, where some took more than their share and some didn't get a chance to sample it at all.  I did follow a few reviewers suggestions, I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, and I used 2.5 packs of cream cheese (because I had 1/2 pack leftover and didn't want it to go to waste).  And I did not use the honey.  This is definitely a keeper and will be making it again.

This was very easy and good!  People loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used regular vanilla extract.  The next time I am going to cut the butter amount in half.  It just puddled on top and was not necessary.

Yummy, do you serve these cold or cooled at room temp? These were wonderful. Once cut they look very nice as well! Great recipe, thanks!

I found this recipe last night, at the last minute, for our company pot luck today. It was super easy to make, and a HUGE hit! Everyone was asking for the recipe and now I am making it again this weekend for a different event!

HOLY SMOKES!!! This is DELICIOUS!!! I follwed the recipe closely.. I excluded the honey, and mine took about 45 min to cook.  Just keep checking after the 30 min until it is all golden and browned.  This was unbelieveable.  I wish I had made 2 to drop off at all my family members houses...but it is so easy to make I'll do that tomorrow.  Thank for the great recipe!!

Wow. I wish I could give this more stars. Lol. So easy and so delicious. I followed all the measurements exactly but used reduced fat crescent rolls, 1/3 less fat cream cheese and I Can't Believe It's not Butter Light. It still turned out flaky, creamy, sticky (from the honey) and DELICIOUS. I will make this for years to come when I need a cinnamon fix :) It will not disappoint! And I think my oven is on the fritz now because I had to bake this a little longer than 30 min. More like 45.

Excellent and very simple to put together.  This could easily serve more than 12 if cut into smaller pieces, and will still be satisying.

This is amazing, I did make two small changes though because I did not have plain cream cheese on hand I used strawberry cream cheese instead and nixed the honey! Absolutely wonderful!! I will definitely make this again!!

EXCELLENT as written!!!!! Just to mix things up a bit after making it a bunch of times I added a can of drained crushed pineapple to the cheesecake mixture, omitted the sugar from the topping, and doubled the honey drizzle. YUMMY! Thanks for a new all-time favorite!!!

This was very good but not sure if it's worth all the calories! IMO tastes much much better after spending the night in the fridge - yum! Next time might try to add less sugar and butter I think it would stil taste fine

This was very good, but next time I will reduce the sugar on top because it made it crunchy.  Or maybe leave off the sugar and just drizzle it with honey and cinnamon.

Brought this recipe to a "mexican theme potluck". The pan was cleaned out! Fantastic and super easy to make. You would think it was going to be heavy with all the cream cheese, but a small piece goes a long way! There will be people looking for seconds!!! ps / kitchen smells fantastic when this is cooking. Highly recommended!!!

I'm really sorry to disagree, but I thought the topping overly sweet and was a little too simple tasting.

I was told that this "tastes like heaven", and it does! I used reduced fat crescent rolls and cooked on a slightly higher heat for shorter cooking time.  Turned out great! Really, really good.

Fantastic flavor for such a simple recipe! It got rave reviews at our annual block party. Be sure to keep an eye on it while baking, as 30 minutes would've been way too long (in our oven, anyway).

Have know made this three times in the last 4 weeks.  Everybody went nuts for this everywhere I have gone.  I think it is a little sweet but due to the immense rave reviews this will now be a very often made dessert.  I can't get over how easy it is too.  Wish I could rate it about 10 stars.

We didn't find the "AWE" in this, but it was good. For an up to date review, there are now seamless crescent rolls that worked for me great in an 11x14. Just didn't get the wow factor for us

I was skeptical when I read reviews boasting heaven on a plate. As I served it to visiting family I thought "oh no, I never made this before. I shouldn't use them as guinea pigs!" Then, before I could sit down to my own piece, it was getting rave reviews. My bf's face LIT UP and he actually asked for 2nds! This coming from a man who doesn't really eat sweets and his idea of a brownie's serving sive (his fav sweet) is a square inch! I then took a bite and could practically see the pearly gates. LOVE LOVE LOVE this!! If i could give more stars, I would!

I made this using reduced fat cream cheese and crescent roll dough and it was still delicious. I took it to a party where the theme was Mexican and everyone really enjoyed it.

Got many compliments! Used light cream cheese, was fine.  Also didn't have Mexican vanilla.  As many others did, I cut sugar topping to 1/2 c. and didn't even use honey...it was sweet enough and very tasty.  Served it chilled.

Oh my!  Absolutely fabulous!  I didn't have to roll my crescent rolls, I used the big and flaky type and they fit perfectly into my pan.  I prefer it warm, but my husband liked it better chilled.  It is so easy to make and it tastes wonderful.  Like other reviewers have stated, there is no need to change a thing!

I have made this twice now and it is so good. The second time, I found refrigerated "sheets" and they fit perfectly in the pan - no rolling seams. I have to bake this about 45 minutes. I think the next time  I will cut back on the amount of butter and sugar on top. I had a problem with the butter pooling on top the crust.

Oh my gosh, this was so good! I will have to say I did have trouble rolling out the top crust, it kept shrinking up everytime I picked it up off the counter. I may have possibly over worked the dough. Needless to say the top crust didn't completely cover the cake. I did cut down on the amount of sugar in the recipe and like other reviewers suggested I used 1 low fat cream cheese and 1 regular. In the end the cake was a big hit at our lunch-in despite the the funny shaped top crust and I will definately make it again.

This was delicious!!! Brought it in to work and everyone raved. I did melt the butter for the top and baked for 45 minutes but that was the only change..Thank you for submitting this.

Excellent!  Made this for a Cinco de Mayo Spanish class party for my kids and it was a hit.  The other kids wanted copies of the recipe so their mom's could make it at home.  Very quick to make.

This recipe is wonderful!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  I tweak just about everything, but this time I did not.  I made it for 14 people, so I cut it into 15 squares instead of 12.  They were just the right size.  Everyone has asked me for the recipe!

This was SO good! I made this for Cinco de Mayo and it was a huge hit at the office luncheon. I ended up using regular vanilla because that is all I had on hand. Yummy! Will become a regular dessert recipe. Thanks!

I thought it was good, but not as amazing as everyone else thinks it is (sorry). I think its WAAAAY too sweet and rich. If i make this again, I'll cut the sugar in half.

I wouldn't change this recipe in any way. It was extremely rich and delicious! I made the first batch, and it was gone by the next morning. So I made a second batch and brought it to my brother who LOVES sopapillas. He said it was a perfect combination of his 3 favorite flavors: the flavors of the cinnamon/sugar, cream cheese, and honey. Wonderful recipe that I'm sure to use again and again!

I accidentally only added one 8 oz. package of cream cheese and was so upset thinking it was going to be awful and it was WONDERFUL. Everyone loved it and were still talking about it the next day. You could add apple pie filling to this too for a change up. Delish!

Great! I made this with reduced fat crescent rolls, one fat-free cream cheese (and one regular) and splenda instead of sugar, and it still turned out wonderful. Will definitely make again!

This was so easy to make.  I found Pillsbury seamless crescent dough and that made it even easier (not that the version with seams is that difficult).  The finished product was fantastic!  Even my picky 7-yr old loved it.  I will definitely make this again!

I personally think it's a bit sweet but EVERYONE whose tried it LOVES it.  It is a hit everywhere I take it.  This is one of those dishes that has people asking for the recipe.  The recipe is easy to follow.  I now make it with a tad less sugar and cinnamon for the topping and it still works out fine, I sometimes omit the honey drizzle as well.  I sometimes have problems rolling out the cresent dough.  It's due to my lack of experience I'm sure.

I live in a dorm, so cooking has to be simple. I loved how this tasted delicious but was easy enough to make with basic cooking supplies and little experience. Next time, I do think I'll use less butter though.

I have to agree with every positive review. I have been requested to make this everytime we go to a function. In fact, I'm trying to figure out a good way to make 300 servings for a function coming soon. The only thing I have done differently is to melt the butter for the topping, add in the sugar and cinnamon and pour over the top. It comes out incredibljavascript:void(0)y!

This was wonderful!! I followed the recipe exactly. I also sprinkled some sliced almonds on top; they looked pretty. As ovens vary, I had to cook mine for 40 minutes (the middle was still a bit gooey after 30). It came out perfectly and was delicious both warm out of the oven and cold the next day. It is really sweet,  but really, really, really good. I printed the recipe out for my boyfriend's mother so she can make it for her skiing friends. She'll be a hit with this recipe!!

I have never gotten so many compliments in my life! I took this to a party and every person loved it. It was really easy to make, although I struggled getting the crust right at first. It didn't really matter once it was cooked, though. I didn't even get a piece!

Delightful!!! I can't wait to make it over and over and over again ... my husband can't wait either. I'm not one to eat a lot of my baking, but I made my husband take most of it to work so I wouldn't eat the entire pan!

Oh, my goodness, this is heavenly!  We were invited to some friends' house for fajitas and I volunteered to bring a Mexican dessert. I came across this recipe and couldn't wait to try it when I read the reviews.  It is absolutely wonderful - one of the best desserts I've ever tasted!  Instantly a family favorite here!

Very very good! A nice change from chocolatey desserts. I halved the recipe in a 9x9 dish, and didn't worry about the seams - it turned out perfectly. The only change I made was cooking it longer than recommended.

OH MY WORD!!! This dessert is amazing! I was looking online for a recipe for a cooking contest for Spanish club and looked at this one. After seeing the five stars and the great reviews I thought I would try it. It was very easy to make,and cooked it for around 45 minutes. When my friend and I tried it we loved it, same with my family. Then at school we entered it in the contest and one first place! The other dishes were all assortments and we still won! This is not a wast of time to make, so worth it! MAKE IT!

This was delicious! So easy to put together. I used 3 pkgs of cream cheese though, & added an egg to the cream cheese mixture. Also, instead of dolloping the butter/cinn/sugar on top, I spread it out over the whole top. Turned out beautifully!! Will definitely make this again! :)

AMAZING! I made this for a party recently and people couldn't stop raving about how great it tasted (and smelled!). I had to leave it in the oven a bit longer than 30 minutes however, as the dough on the center of the cheesecake/pie was still well... "doughy" and it definitely needed to cook longer. After about 45 minutes, I took it out, but it was still too mushy to cut into bars.

This is exactly what I was craving!  I couldn't wait to cut into it . . so I do recommend to wait until it's completely cooled.  But . . it's even better the next day after refrigeration. Yummo!

This was wonderful!  I had a little trouble getting the top layer to stay rolled out and cover the cream chesse so the cream cheese came out over the top.  It didnt look pretty but the flavor was delicious.

I made 1/2 the recipe using an 8x8 pan and 1/2 the ingredients using much less sugar as others suggested. We love sopapilla's and cheese cake so I thought the combination would be great....and I was right, it's delicious! Will definately make many times over...but will make the full recipe from now on.

We loved this. Dead easy, fairly inexpensive. Easy to store the ingredients on hand at home. (That is a big plus) It was a tiny bit too sugary..that is what stops me from giving it a 5 star. But let me also add that we are not huge sweet eaters. SOO..likely that is why we would prefer a bit less sugar next time. Will definitely make it again. I urge everyone to try this simple and delicious dessert and to tweak the sugar to your family's tastebuds. Loved it. Great job CandelB!

This lived up to all the wonderful reviews. Before making it I thought it can't be that good, boy was I wrong! I made this for a party and it was gone in 15 minutes with people asking for more!! Reviews like this is the best thing I've had in a long time! All I could think is thank you so much for this great recipe, no one believed that it was the first time I ever made it! I can tell you it won't be the last and this will be my "signature" dish to take everywhere!! Thank you again CandelB for sharing such a wonderful recipe!!!!!

Yummy. Teenagers loved it. Next time I will reduce the butter for the topping to 1/4 C, melt butter cinnamon & sugar and brush on. Orginal recipe a bit too greasy & sugary for me. Did not last 24hrs!  I think this would be really good with a layer of fruit puree over cheesecake layer & under top crust. Will make this again!

Delicious! I made two of these for a large group and they absolutely LOVED them! I did alter the topping a bit because, the first time I made this recipe there was a layer of butter still on top after baking. This time I made the topping based on a single recipe and covered two sopapilla cheesecakes with it. It came out a little crispier than the first one I made. Quick, easy and delicious.

I made this for my daughter her boyfriend and my boyfriend. My daughter said it was her new favorite desert. If you are afraid of this because of the mexican vanilla (I was) it is easy to find. Look in the ethnic section of any grocery store. I found it at walmart! Thanks for posting this great recipe!!

Yummy. I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. I had never made/had this before but needed a dessert for a Fiesta themed party. It was a huge hit, everyone loved it. My husband took the leftovers to work and everyone loved it there too. I would recommend cutting small squares as it is a little on the rich side.

I made this tonight for the first time for a Mexican-themed potluck.  I thought that it was very good, and everyone else (especially my husband) thought it was delicious!  Super easy to make too!  I used normal vanilla extract since that is what I had on hand, and I only put 1/2 cup sugar in with the mixture spread on the top.  Rolling out the crescent rolls on wax paper was a great idea by another reviewer.  It took about 45 minutes to bake in my oven.  I served it at room temperature.

Took this to a cookout on Saturday, there were 2 other desserts - but we all had to fight off 4 teenage boys just to get a small slice.  We skipped the honey, was plenty sweet enough and added an additional tsp. of good quality Mexican Vanilla.  A+, well done!

My husband and I give this 4 stars--definitely delicious but there's a flavor element missing and I'm not sure what it is.  I'll have to experiment.  To me, this is more like a decadent breakfast treat--reminiscent of a cream cheese coffee cake (which I love).  This is a great standard recipe that will always please a crowd.

I just wish the ratings had a six star category! Not only is it easy to make - it is fabulously delicious. My husband said "I didn't think I liked cream cheese until I tried this".

Heavenly, as my daughter says just melts in your mouth. I did need to cook for about 50 minutes. And I did take out and brush the butter, sugar topping on the top. Thank you for much for the recipe. New favorite!

Oh ya..this is awesome!  Followed the recipe to a "T"..except I forgot the honey at the end lol  Anyway, great taste and easy to make.  I did as some had suggested and did not use a rolling pin.  I started out that way, and ended up just putting it in the pan and stretching the dough and sealing perforations.  Make this..you won't be disappointed!

Very simple to make.  I used almond extract and sliced almonds and it was gobbled up quickly.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  I will definitely make this one again!  Most like it served warm.

A little bit harder than fellow reviewers said.  I followed advise and put dough in the oven five minutes before spreading cream cheese, it made it easier.  I also used a 9X9 inch pan for thicker bars.  I accidentally put the honey on top before I put it in the oven which gave it a yummy candy like top.    I like it much better chilled, I don't want to admit how many bars I've eaten today :)

This was delicious!!  When I saw the recipe it looked good, but like nothing amazing.  I received TONS of compliments on it though and people have mentioned it again even since the party I made it for.  Very good and perfect for a Mexican themed party!  The only thing I didn't do was add the honey.  Honestly, I just forgot.  I could go either way next time I make it because it was excellent even without it.  I didn't realize it was supposed to have honey until reading the recipe again now to review it.

So Easy and SUPER DELISH! I had to come up with something quick for a treat to take to a gathering. I had 2 tubes of crescent rolls and found this recipe. I was in a hurry so I didn't read the recipe super close, so I ended up making a few (accidental) changes. After layering the cream cheese, I topped it with cinnamon and sugar and a bit of honey. I then layered the top crescent roll and topped that with melted butter mixed with the sugar and cinnamon. I added the honey before baking. It took 30 minutes in my oven and it was fantastic! I doubt you could really screw this one up. My new quick "go to"! Everyone raved and wanted the recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I was this for a Cinco De Mayo party at work.  It was a BIG hit with everyone asking for the recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe states (except I only had American? vanilla flavoring).  Almost skipped buying the honey but am glad I didn't.  It gave it that extra little umph!  Very Good!
