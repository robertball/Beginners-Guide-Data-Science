If this cookie doesn't come out moist and chewy, you've mismeasured something.  I doubled the amount of chocolate chips - just because that's the way I like them.  Although they're not "beautiful" cookies, these were a huge hit with my co-workers.  I think I might add a bit more flour to get a nicer shape and perhaps some cinnamon to a bit more flavor.

Hi, I'm ten years old. My mom made these cookies for me and they were very chewy and good! I loved them my whole family loved them too. I wish my mom could make these everyday!

I usually don't add my 2 cents.  As I was reading these reviews before I tried them I was apalled that people could be so unnecesarly rude!  I thought these coolies were great.  I added 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips though.  If I didn't like them I would leave my comments at that!  And it made 5 dozen good size cookies!  Thank You.  And for all those rude people that can't just say "I didn't care for them"  I'm sorry.

These are very good cake like cookies. Although I addes 3 cups flour instead of 2. With 3 cups, the dough is less runny and the cookies hold their shape better and are more "thicker". Over all an easy good cookie recipe! :)

I don't know how anyone could eat them they are hard and dry. My 4 year old summed it up when he had to soak his cookie in a glass of milk for 5 minutes to be able to bite it, and then when he did, he said, "Ew mom, not worth soaking."

I gave this recipe a ** because the cookies i made were too chewy and almost unbaked while being too browned on the bottom. I believe this was because of the thickness of the cookies that i put on the cookie sheet. I also ended up adding MORE sugar because the dough was bland. overall, this recipe would be EXTREMELY good, IF "Allison" worked on it well and it seems to have a LEAPING start!!! (:

Since the main complaint seemed to be that these cookies were flavor-free, I added another cup of white sugar, 3x the vanilla, some cinnemon, twice the chocolate chips, and no salt. I also didn't cook them as long, due to my altitude. They definitely don't need to be soaked in anything, but unfortunately, they still have no flavor. They are sweet, but no flavor. We concluded that the cookies just taste like oatmeal with chocolate chips. I gave 3 stars though, because I think I might make these again, minus the chocolate chips, as a "breakfast cookie" that I can grab on my way out the door in the mornings. PS- They did run all over the pan and had no shape, but that was ok with me. And they were doughy, but I like my cookies doughy.

This is a good recipe if you don't like a sweet cookie.  I liked it for that very reason, which happened to be the same reason my husband disliked it.  These cookies stayed soft for a week.  Soaking the oatmeal makes a huge difference.

I found this recipe over 4 years ago, and it always a crowd pleaser!  I love using this recipe because it's so easy and it tastes the best!!BTW I always add extra vanilla.  No other recipe comes close to how delicious these are.

These were good.  We used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips and halved the recipe since there are only 2 of us.

I absolutely loved this recipe. The thing I did differently was add coconut and used whited chocolate chips. I have found though, that to keep the cookies from "melting all over the pan" the dough should be refrigerated for about 1/2 an hour and then put into the pre-heated oven. This extra step keeps them from doing that melting thing. My neighbors and family all loved this recipe, so thank you.

Ally, Girl!, I dont know what planet your cooking on but these should not even be available to the public!  I should have based my decison to make these by what everyone else said.  They had a doughie flavor and the cookie batter ran all over the pan. NOT enjoyable at all.  I think the soaking the oats in milk is what interested me to make them but big mistake!

My husband just loves these cookies.  The batch size is perfect for a family of four.  Next time, I'll cut the recipe in half since there's just the two of us . . . ok, I won't!

I made these, and I was a bit worried from what people told me, but DON'T ACTUALLY MAKE THE PUDDING.  I think this was a main problem with it.  Just pour in the packet.  The batter did have a twangy taste from the pudding mix, but once you cooked them, that totally went away.  And as someone else said, they were a lot better, strangely when you let them sit a day  : )  LOL   These were absoulutely DELICOUS!!!

I've made this recipe twice.  First time I was actually out of white sugar and just added more brown sugar.  Both recipes turned out delicious!!  We all loved them!  Very moist. I actually didn't let them brown much at all out of fear I'd end up burning them.  Ha
But next time. I will try them darker.  This is a great recipe. Thanks

Not good at all. No flavor, even after I added more sugar and vanilla. Soaking the oats in milk made for a soft and chewy cookie, but there was very little texture-- not what I was expecting from an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie.

I have read some of the reveiws and am confused as to why some said it was "runny."  I suggest it is not the receipe, but the baker.  I found them to come out exactly as I hoped.  Chewy and delicious.  I can see why people added or took away for to fit your taste, but if you did the recipe correctly, they def shouldn't be "runny."

I tried this recipe today. The cookies were very soft, but for some reason very dry inside. I'm not sure what I did wrong :( They had the texture of a cupcake, which was tasty, but were almost tasteless inside.
I will definitely try again in the future and make absolute sure I measure exactly.
My coworkers seemed to enjoy them though!!

The most delicious chocolate chip oatmeal cookie EVER. Soaking the oats in the milk is the secret. I usually cut the sugar by 1/3 to 1/2 due to my own preferences, and I use milk chocolate chips.

Not very good at all.  Has the consistency of a muffin, and not very much flavor to speak of.

I think soaking the oats in milk was a mistake because my dough turned out like a thick porridge and the cookies were soft and chewy alright, if you like baked porridge.

Not a bad flavor, but totally wrong consistency for cookies.  Would probably make pretty good muffins, though ~ they had more of a bread/muffin kind of texture.

This was the best recipe.  I just went to my daughters college and made a batch of these for her, and ended up making 3 more batches for the rest of the kids in her dorm.  they all loved it.

I loved them!  While I don't disagree with another reviewer that said something along the lines of them tasting bland, I guess that I like that type of cookie!  I can't believe how soft they are and just the right sweetness and amount of chocolate.  This will become a regular cookie recipe in our house!

This recipe was great, they are perfect. I forgot to soak the oat and added it to my creamed ingrediants when i added the eggs and vanilla ( thats when i noticed the milk part oops!) but i let it sit for about 5 inutes and then made 2 and 1/2 dozen large cookies and they are awesome. I did not add chocolate chips and they are still great i did add 1/3 cup more oats instead.

My kids really liked these. We used butter, and we soaked the oats for a long time (because we poured the milk on the oats and then found we had no flour in the house, so had to wait a day to finish them).  They weren't at all runny, and they were big hit with the teen crowd.

I was disappointed in these cookies. They lack flavor and the texture is interesting. I split the batch in half and added walnuts and coconut which made it kind of better but overall not what I was expecting. (recipe makes well over 2dozen!). Thank you for posting your receipe =). Nice try.

I really don't know what the other users did that they cookies didn't turn out.  Mine turned out great!  So great in fact I had to make a another double batch again!  (the same day)  I have sent the recipe to many people and they all loved it as well.  As well as all of the people who tryed the ones that I had made already!  This is a cookie that will be made again and again in my house!  Thanks for sharing it with us!!! :o)

Not a fabulous recipe.  I recommend using about another 1/2 cup of oats and DEFINATELY add a bunch of cinnamon and maybe soak the oats in dark rum instead of milk.  I'm going to try that next time.  The cinnamon made a big difference.  Overall, I'll try the recipe one more time, but majorly tweaked, before I throw it away and go back to my original.

I thought these cookies were yummy. Perhaps bland, as others have said. I would suggest less salt. I couldn't really taste the oatmeal and I added raisins to them. They were so moist and delicious over all.

One thing that I have always done with oatmeal cookies is to soak the oatmeal in the milk before adding it to the rest of the ingredients.  I am a skating mom and now have a standing order to bring along a big batch of these cookies to every competition for all the skaters on our teams.  They are great!!

These cookies were okay at best.  They were too bland, and they were more like a cake or bread consistency.  Therefore, they crumbled and broke every time you touched them.  Overall, the taste was okay but too bland for me.

Well, for starters, my cookies wouldn't come off the sheet. Perhaps spraying them with cooking spray would help. Mine came out dry, and fell apart when I tried to move them from sheet to rack. I don't think I would try this one again.

These cookies are great!  Mine turned out moist and delicious.  I might add more chocolate chips next time, but then, I am pretty crazy about chocolate.  My husband says the cookies have a cakey texture as opposed to being flat and crispy - a positive thing we think.

These cookies did not work out for me at all.  They fell apart upon taking them out of the oven.  My dough came out really wet.  I tried adding more flour, but the cookies got doughy.  But my daughter did have a ball helping me in the kitchen, so all was not lost.

These cookies are delicious!  I made them and they disappeared practically overnight!  I definitely would recommned them.  They are soft and chewy when you take them out of the oven, and they remain that way even the next day.  Great recipe!

These cookies did best for me when I only put in half the milk and baked them at 325 for 17 minutes.  Otherwise, they seem to fall apart rather than be chewy.

These cookies are very disappointing.  The cookies were cakie and spongy- an accompanying glass of milk is a must in order to wash them down.  They tasted very bland also.  I shared them with numerous people and the only person that liked them was a pregnant woman.

Well, for a recipie that says 2 1/2 dozen, I ended up with almost 6!!  They must be really large cookies for 2 1/2 dozen! :)  I used chocolate milk instead of white milk and added extra chocolate chips.  They cooked fine, but seemed a little bland than others I have had.

They were pretty bland, really light and air-y and didn't at all taste like they had oatmeal in them. The batter was also pretty wattery even though I added 1/2 cup more chocolate chips. NOT RECOMMENDED!

These were really good.  The only suggestion I have is to use less salt.  I will make these again.

Great recipe!  I was afraid the dough was too runny, but I left it how it was and it turned out ok.  Some of the cookies kinda crumble as I took them off the baking sheet.  But other than that they are good.  Thanx

My roommates loved these cookies, and I thought they were good as well, but they were slightly dry for my taste.  Maybe the 1 cup milk wasn't enough for the 3 cups quick cooking oats.  After adding a little more milk to the dough and flattening the cookies before baking them, they were better, but I would recommend less oatmeal and/or a shorter baking time next time.  Maybe a little more butter?

I made this recipe and cooked them as bars instead of small cookies.  They were wonderfully chewy and so tasty that they lasted less than a day.  They are great in lunchboxes and as really filling snacks.

I added more chips and some walnuts and made cookie squares - they turned out great!
