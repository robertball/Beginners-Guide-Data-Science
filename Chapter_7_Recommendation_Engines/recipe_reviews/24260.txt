This is a simple and VERY delicious dish. I had the same idea as another poster to fix them in the crock pot. So thats what I did! I browned the chops in a pan after coating them with a mixture of flour, garlic powder, and mustard powder. I put the browned chops in the crock pot then covered them with the sauce. Cook on low for 7-8 hours. VERY DELICIOUS! The beauty of doing it this way is you can cook alot of chops! Thanks for sharing.

Great Company Dinner Main course recipe. A twist on the usual fried pork chops with a creamy sauce good enough to serve over rice and mashed potatoes.

This is a really good meal.  I made this for my family of 5 and they really liked it.  The ingredients are something I usually always have on hand, and it's simple to make.

Sorry, but this recipe just did not cut it - the sauce was more like a thick paste - It needs to be thinned, and the ketchup taste was overwhelming. No one in my family of 4 really liked it.   I followed the recipe to the letter, although I'm usually one of those cooks that just "wing it", not using ketchup normally in anything I cook I decided to be exact :-) 

It just tasted like a cafeteria meal, which was sort of disappointing after all those rave reviews....I would leave out the ketchup, add a bit of sherry and some chicken stock to thin the sauce, garlic, pepper, parsley, some thinly sliced red/green pepper along with the onions, and then I think you might have a winner :-)

OH MAN!!!  My mama used to make this recipe for me when I was a little girl.  It's from either Better Homes and Gardens cookbook, or Betty Crocker's cookbook... I can't remember which, but it's a very old-school recipe with a red and white plaid cover on the book.    Anywhoo, this was a favorite of mine growing up and I searched for it because I was craving it and wanted to make it for my guy.  I was so happy to see it here!  I made the following tweaks:  1)  Doubled the sauce portion of the recipe; 2) Used Healthy Request Reduced Fat/Sodium Cream of Chicken AND Cream of Mushroom to cut down on calories/fat/greasiness; 3) Used 6 tablespoons of Lea & Perrins THICK recipe Worcestershire sauce; 4) A few heavy-handed dashes of TAPATIO hot sauce -- yes, I'm serious!; 5) A generous pour from a bottle of Merlot I was drinking when I mad this dinner; and 6) Seasoned the chops with salt, pepper & garlic powder and let rest for 7 minutes before browning.  IT WAS AWESOME!!!!  Zingy, tangy, savory... tender and comforting, just as I remembered this recipe to be.  If you're debating on making this, don't!  Try it out.... the sauce is killer and is great over mashed potatoes.  I served it with a side of asparagus I marinated in olive oil, soy sauce, garlic, and sea salt/pepper.  My boyfriend loved it and I can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow.  BUEN PROVECHO!  Enjoy.  :)

I tried this recipe for dinner last night. My mom and my boyfriend both liked it. It's a very different flavor and it was nice for a change. Dont be afraid of the odd mix of ingredients. It makes a wonderful sauce that goes great with pork.I'm using the leftover sauce as a basting sauce for some grilled pork tonight.Thanks for a great recipe.

Family and I enjoyed this new recipe.  A new change of pace for tender pork chops.  I actually double the sauce, since we use it over mashed potatos with our chops.

What a great recipe! It had a very unique taste, which I loved. The meat ended up really tender, and the sauce tasted great on potatoes as well. Even my 13-month-old daughter liked it, and she can be picky. I'll definately be making this a lot.

A great little recipe!  An unlikely combination of ingredients makes a delicious sauce. I'd like to try it next time in the crock pot.

THE PORK CHOPS I BOUGHT WERE A LITTLE FATTY BUT THEY DID TURN OUT TENDER. I REALLY LIKED THE SAUCE. IT WOULD BE GOOD WITH CHICKEN.

I used the basics of this recipe and my boyfriend and I liked this very much.  I added more worcestershire sauce and used about half the ketchup, added onion powder and garlic powder.  It was really tasty and I could see how the extra sauce would be tasty over mashed or roasted potatoes.

Delish! AND made with on-hand ingredients. It doesn't claim to be fancy, just simple ingredients for a simple down-home cookin' taste. I doubled the worcestershire sauce, and it turned out perfect!

delicious! my fiance loved it. i made a few modifications though. i always season my pork chops with onion powder, garlic powder, meat tenderizer when i brown. the sauce i put together as written, then added a handful of brown sugar (about 2 or 3 tablespoons). you must add some sort of liquid to this! the sauce cooks down significantly after 45 minutes of simmering.  i added about 1/2 a cup of milk. no leftovers tonight!

Did make some changes to the recipe. Dusted the chops with garlic powder as well as the salt and pepper. Instead of using ketchup, I added a splash of sherry. Next time I will use onion powder instead of the sliced onions.

My kids asked me to go back to cooking "the old way", Guess boring is better, at least at our house.  My husband and I thought the flavor was okay, but the pork came out dry.

I thought this was very good!  It was nice to actually make a recipe that I didn't have to go and buy ingredients, because this recipe uses common items. I will make this one again for sure! I did add a little garlic powder and pepper to the sauce as it simmered.

We loved this recipe. The sauce is similar to the salsbury steak recipe from this site. The meat turned out tender and was falling off the bones when i served it with mashed potatoes. Thanks for the great submission.

Been a "shelf special" in my house since the early 80's. The family never tires of eating it, and I never tire while making it. This one's in the "recipes to be handed down" collection.

This was very good! Used boneless thick pork chops and cooked with onion and garlic, salt and pepper. Double sauce ingredients, but not ketchup. Added a little chicken stock to clean soup cans and cooked. In under 30 minutes, the pork was done. Served with corn and mashed potatoes. Everyone liked it! Smelled great while cooking too!

I originally found this recipe in a Betty Crocker cookbook in the 1970s. I was newly married and couldn't cook a thing! This recipe saved me! I still make it 40 years later. And I still get the , Wow! This is good comments . I like to saute my onions in a little oil first then add the chops and brown them lightly on both sides and then add the sauce ingredients. I always do mine in a large fry pan with a lid. Mashed potatoes are the best with this dish. Try it you won't be sorry!

A favorite of my husbands (his momma used to make it) and now we have it on a fairly regular basis. Its great in a pinch cause can make with the scrapings of your pantry.

I make this a couple times of month. It is really good! I brown the chops and then put them in the crock pot.

These are wonderful!!  I've made them a few diffrent times.  The last time I didn't have an onion so subbed it with onion powder, just as good.  My husband loves them, so do my 2 young children.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this recipe. I added a little garlic salt to taste but did the rest of the recipe as is. This was absolutely delicious. The color or the sauce mixure is a bit strange(brownish/orange) but the tast is great.Will make this again. Thanks

We loved this recipe. The chops came out very tender (cut with a fork tender) and the sauce was perfect for a gravy over mashed potatoes. Would work great over rice as well.  I will make this again because it is so easy and the ingredients I always have on hand.  I used very large, thick 'Costco type' chops and had to lengthen the cooking time a bit but they were wonderful and tasted like I'd been cooking them all day.

I didn't really care for this but I didn't really dislike it either. I think it just didn't suit my tastes. Thanks anyway Susan.

Very delicious. I used pork steaks instead of chops and i only cooked 2 steaks. It was just enough sauce for my husband and I. I served over white rice. Will definately make again.
