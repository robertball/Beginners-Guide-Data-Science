The glaze is great, but I lined my pie crust with 8 oz softened cream cheese before I added the strawberries, to keep the crust from getting soggy, and add richness.

I love to bake pies and this one is definately a keeper, the only thing I did diferently, and I could probably have done without, is I added one more tbls of jello.  This is a great light pie!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made just a few changes(used frozen strawberries rather than fresh & used 4 Tbs of gelatin mix, since I was out of cornstarch) and everyone in the family loved it, including my sister-in-law, who does not "do pies". I might make it again next week, too.

OMG!!!! Awesome! Doubled the recipe and made 2 pies. I used Keebler graham cracker crust (the crust with 2 extra servings). Used fresh strawberries from my garden. Just served to several coworkers who devoured the pies in 10 minutes. Will make again. Update: made again this week - important to let the filling cool completely. I didn't let it cool long enough (only an hour an 15 min) because I was tired and wanted to go to bed. So, the next morning when I cut the pie at work it was a bit runny. So, make sure you cool completely. Will take about 2 to 3 hours to cool to room temperature.

This is my first review, but I had to let you know how great this is. The family thoroughly enjoyed it. It was the first time I had made a strawberry pie but it won't be the last. Thanks

I've made this a couple of times, and we love it.  It's one of my husband's favorites, and he doesn't usually dig desserts!  I don't get the bad reviews.  I've made no changes, other than topping individual slices with lite Cool Whip, and my crust has never gotten soggy.  Try as written, it's great!

This was sooo good. For the crust I used the Shortbread Crust recipe from this site. I also sliced the strawberries instead of leaving them whole. Everyone loved it! My husband already wants me to make it again. Definitely a keeper!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. I didn't make a pie out of it, cause I was just experimenting with it, I just made the sauce and put the strawberries into it and put it in the frige. It was really too thick once refrigerated. It may have been ok if left at room temperature, but I don't know cause it was late and I put in the frige while it was still a little bit warm.. And to me, it was too sweet. But that may depend on the ripeness of your berries. Mine were really ripe. Maybe, if I add a little less cornstarch and less sugar, it would be ok.. another suggestion is to run a few berries in a blender and add to the sauce to make it taste less like artificial strawberry flavor from the jello, and more like real strawberry flavor. Overall, this recipe was ok at best... it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't wonderful either..

Amazing, delicious pie! While pregnant I was craving Marie Calendar's fresh strawberry pie. I finally decided on this recipe after reviewing tons of others and i'm glad I did!! Now i've made this pie about 5 times in 6 weeks, it's yummy. 
My strawberries have been ripe so I use about 3/4 c. Sugar. Also omitted salt after first pie. Had to substitute berry jello on 3rd pie and it tasted amazing too! Only thing is noticed is gets a little soggy after 24 hours

This recipe was amazing! I made it at my school for my foods class and every student and teacher LOVED it! Even the ones who weren't big on sweets. It's easy, and definitely delightful. I recommend this recipe for sure.

Yummy yummy yummy! I thought it was a great pie. I cut down on sugar because my strawberries were so sweet already and I didn't want the pie to be too sweet. Still a great recipe. :)

Not at all what I thought it would be.  Three tablespoons is a lot of gelatin!  It was more like strawberry Jello with strawberries in a crust.  Tasty, but, I definitely would not make it again.

This is the best fresh strawberry pie! It was awesome and so easy to make. It truly was so yummy and it showcased the wonderful berries from our garden.We had it with home made whipped cream. Thank You for sharing such a great recipe Glenda!

To prevent soggy crust spread a thin layer of glaze on crust before arranging the berries. This is a great recipe. I used it when out of town and unable to access my old standby.

I had to substitute 3 TB flour in place of the corn starch, and used strawberry-banana gelatin in place of strawberry. I also coated the crust with cream cheese before adding strawberries. It was thoroughly enjoyed by all--especially with whipped cream!

My husband promised one of his client's one of my strawberry pies, which any other year would have been fine...but I usually pick the berries to go in my pies and we just had a baby, so I wasn't up for it this year. I had also lost my recipe and strawberries in PA were done for the season...feeling a little discouraged I found this recipe which is very similiar to mine. I however use a bit less sugar, add 2 tsp of freshly squeezed lemon juice and two quarts of strawberries cut in halves or thirds, so that the pie appears like a mountain of strawberries. I missed PA's strawberry season, but found MA berries to be just as tasty. His client said it was the best strawberry pie she had ever eaten; she even snuck downstairs in the middle of the night to have another piece. Thank you Glenda for posting this recipe; it truly helped me out in a pinch.

I enjoyed this recipe but would cut back the sugar a bit next time for our tastes.  I have a hard time serving strawberry pie in neat slices so I made individual round crusts and placed in bottom of serving glasses.  I then topped with the strawberry mixture and topped with whipped cream.  This was a really cute individual dessert.

Whole family ejoyed this a lot. Didnt have strawberry gelatin, used raspberry instead. Yum. Followed others' idea, and put a layer of cream cheese between the crust and filling. Such a good idea!

I followed the recipe to the letter except I added extra strawberries so that the pie would be piled high.  I gotta say that I am glad that I did because it was way to SWEET!  Everything else was fine though except I think next time I will use half the sugar and try raspberry jello instead and slice the strawberries because eating whole strawberries was a bit of a mouthful, especially for my kids.

I used a purchased graham cracker crust that I had on hand, as I didn't have the time to make and bake a real pie crust but needed to use up fresh strawberries. Big mistake! Next time I'll make a homemade pie crust and this will be excellent. I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup, and I cut the strawberries in halves or quarters. Served with whipped cream on top. Because of the type of crust, it broke apart while serving, but it tasted good. My bad on the crust! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this pie was so delicious! I used a shortbread pie crust. I have made this twice already (one was requested). I added bananas to the top of the second one upon request. I did add 3 tablespoons of strawberry gelatin mix, but if you want more jello, you can add the whole box. Everyone loved this pie and I will make it again soon. Also if you are adding bananas, you can use strawberry/banana flavored gelatin mix.

The pie was really good, but can someone please help me to understand how to cut the thing?  With my sharpest serrated knife, I could not cut a pretty piece :( So, while the pie looked incredible in the dish before I cut it, the piece was broken and falling to the side and ugly. I think it was b/c the strawberries in the store look good, but when you taste them they are hard and sour.  I would make this again, but only with good quality strawberries-like local farm market berries, then I bet this would be out of this world.

This was absolutely fabulous! I made the recipe as is. The current photo that is featured does not represent what the pie will look like if made as directed.  Look through the other photos to see what the pie will look like.

I made this pie last year with some strawberries that me and my children had hand picked.  I took it to church with me that night, and they were licking the pie plate.  It was hands down the best fresh strawberry pie I have ever tasted!  It's almost time to go pick some strawberries for 2010, and all my friends at church are waiting! :)

I was pleased with the ease of making the pie, but disappointed in the flavor. The jello left an imitation strawberry taste.

I had been craving strawberry pie from Shoney's (had it as a child but don't have a Shoney's anywhere near me now).  This is exactly what I was craving!  Everyone in my family LOVED this pie.  Will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe Glenda!

I'm giving this a 3 because it got mixed reviews when I served it. Personally, I thought it was too sweet and I didn't like the taste or consistency of the sauce. But, my guests said they liked it a lot and wouldn't change a thing. The leftover pie sat sadly in the fridge. Next time I'll try a different recipe that doesn't use jello.

followed the advice of others and added cream cheese but you could barely taste it. When i cut into the pie it was so soupy it just came out as a big blob of strawberries and crust. Everyone still liked it but lacked appearance. I will continue to use the glaze for strawberry shortcake as it was great. I had more than would fit in the pie and saved some of the strawberries and glaze for later. my husband loved the strawberry mixture for ol fashiion strawberry shortcake. Overall not impressed with this recipe.

This turned out wonderfully despite my picked-too-green, sour, tough strawberries.  I used a Keebler 2 extra servings graham cracker crust, added a layer of cream cheese on the bottom of it, and added an extra Tbs. of Jell-o to the glaze to compensate for the berries.  Next time I think I will add the berries (halved or coarsely chunked)to the glaze while it is still cooking--perhaps this will soften and sweeten them.  Considering how BAD my berries were, this was an EXCELLENT recipe!

I would probably rename this "Jello Pie"; the "glaze" is just Jello.  I used the cream cheese in the bottom too, so it basically tasted like cream cheese with jello on top.  Didn't taste bad, just really really strange.

I followed the recipe almost exact, only change was I added a tbls of fresh lemon juice to the glaze mixture. It was so coyingly sweet from the jello and full cup of sugar it’s almost inedible. I actually tried using whipped cream to “cut” the artificial sugary taste. Once the pie sets in the fridge the glaze is just way too much. I ruined my gorgeous fresh berries in this recipe and will not use this recipe again.

Followed the recipe except for adding frozen wild blueberries instead of fresh.  Fastest filling for any last minute dessert.  Especially great as a filling for Meringue Nest and topped with Whipped cream. Yum!

Had I to make over, I would have added a little more cornstarch since it was a little thin. I think it's because we used freshly picked strawberries from a local farm and we've had a lot of rain this spring so they're extra juicy. Delicious recipe. I'll make it again

It was a very good recipe. whole strawberries were a little awkward so next time I'll use more strawberries and slice them up a little. I also used a base layer of 1 pkg of cream cheese mixed with 3/4 cup powdered sugar and 1 small tub of cream cheese. I had some left over so I'm gonna use it for apple dip. The strawberry filling was very easy to make and it actually tasted better after sitting over night.

Love this basic recipe.  As always I tend to tweek most.  I paint melted chocolate on the bottom of the pie or tart shells , add a layer of custard, then fresh strawberries and glaze.  The chocolate is a nice surprise.

I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site. Instead of pure boiling water, I boiled 1 cup of pureed strawberries. It came out very sweet the first time, and so the second time I only added 3/4c sugar. Also, boiling for 3 minutes didn't get rid of the pasty taste so I had to boil 5 minutes longer.

Like strawberry soup in a very soggy pie crust.  I baked the pie crust to perfection.  I cooled the mixture to below room temperature in a sink full of ice water to try to get it thicker.  I thought it might thicken in the fridge when it was chilled.  NOT.  When I removed it from the fridge the soupy "glaze" ran out the side of tin foil cover all over the floor and table.  Inedible. But salvaged the berries and washed the red soupy liquid off in the sink and dried the berries and started over with my own recipe.  Which is:  3/4 cup water, 1/4 cup cornstarch, 1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 4 dashes of red food coloring.  My recipe was excellent, made fresh strawberry pie like I had a a kid in a fine restaurant and was a lot less hassle. The glaze needs to be stiff enough so that when you pour it in it will not soak into the  baked crust and turn it to paste.  Plus the ability to cut pieces.

I am happily surprised! Mainly because I don't make/like fruit pies..at all. However my husband loves them and requested it for his birthday. It is SUPER easy and very tasty! I doubled the recipe and took the advice of lowering the sugar amount. So for a double batch I used 1 1/2 cups sugar, sliced the strawberries into 3rds and put a thin layer of glaze on the baked shell. Be sure to follow the cooling directions and let it firm up in the fridge. With fresh whipped cream this dessert is addicting!@

If you like Jello, then you will like this. A lot of reviews for this recipe and recipes similar mentioned that you had to leave this out to cool COMPLETELY before pouring into pie. I wish I would NOT have listened. I let it sit for about an hour and it was so firm that I had to heat it back up to get it back to a consistency I could pour. I used the short bread crust here on AR (delicious). I thought this pie was just "OK", but all of my kids really loved it. Also, I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and it was PLENTY sweet enough:)

I followed a few others' advice and used a cream cheese base.  8 oz blended with 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 c sugar.  Then I reduced the sugar in the gelatin to 3/4 cup.  I used just the tiniest sprinkle of salt.  I did not allow gelatin to cool fully before pouring it on (maybe 60-90 min at room temp), but the pie was perfect after about 3-4 hours in the fridge. I used strawberries from our garden, which are so cute and the perfect size.  If using larges strawberries, I would have had to chop.

Yummy!!!!!  Easy to make!  My husband is very picky about pies and he said this was the best he has had... besides his mothers who is an expert pie maker.

Not bad for a quick pie.  Couldn't keep my strawberries from floating out of place.  Otherwise not bad, not spectacular though.

Everyone loved it! My husband was afraid that it would be overly sweet with the cup of sugar but it turned out not to be.
Will make again for special occasions. A nice dessert for those hot summer days.

I was very disappointed in the wetness of this recipe. The pie looked beautiful and then we cut into it for Easter dessert and it was so runny & wet I sucked it out with a turkey baster!!
