Reduce the brown mustard, but most of all... Don't marinade for a whole hour! Shrimp (and all seafood for that matter) actually starts to cook when it sits in citrus juice. It doesn't need marinading more than 15-20 minutes!! Otherwise you will end up with tough, chewy shrimp.

I am only giving this recipe 4 stars as it is, because the mustard is too strong for my tastes.  Reducing the mustard by 1/2 brings it up to 5 stars!  For those of us who work all day long, bear in mind that if you try to marinate this all day it will not be as tender.  Shrimp are delicate, and the lemon juice "cooks" them if left in the fridge too long.  2 or 3 hours would be the max for large shrimp; stick to the one hour if you have medium shrimp.  And don't overgrill them!  Just cook them until they turn pink/opaque and curl up.  Otherwise they can turn dry and rubbery.  This dish has AMAZING flavor, and everyone loves it!  BTW, this marinade is also great on salmon.

This was awesome!  With modifications, of course.  As others suggested, I reduced mustard (Dijon) to 1 TBS, and 1/2 a lemon or 3 TBS juice.  I also used 3 TBS dried basil (remember: fresh to dried herbs is 3 to 1 ratio).  I served this with steamed green beans, and "Cheese Herb Bread" from this site dipped in olive oil, parm. cheese and black pepper.  A wonderfully filling, yet light meal.

5 stars with my changes/additions! I used all olive oil instead of butter, 4 cloves of garlic, honey mustard instead of brown, and 2-Tbsp. dry basil intead of fresh. I also added a little bit of lime juice. Since this was a last minute meal decision, I only had about 15 minutes to marinade. I cooked them on a stovetop steamer and they were SOOOO delicious! The flavors were amazing, even though I didn't have a long time for them to marinate. Perfect!

I wish I could give this 10*. I was a chef for 5 years at an Italian restaurant and we always were looking for different specials to run, too bad I did not have this. Restaurant quality. The only change I made was that I also added 2 chicken breast thinly sliced to the marinade and grilled it together over low heat on a piece of aluminum paper (sparyed with non stick spray). I also left the shell on the shrimp while marinated. My husband loved it and he is picky. A++++++

This is delicious and easy.  I marinated my shrimp in a large ziplock bag and had no dish to wash.  We added some veggies from our garden on skewers(zucchini, onions, cherry tomatoes) and some mushrooms for our sides.  We then put some garlic texas toast on the grill and had our whole meal ready with little clean up.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Loved this shrimp!  Only thing I would change is the amount of lemon juice called for in the recipe.  My husband thought it was too "lemony", so I will cut the amount called for in half (only use 1/2 lemon).  I also did not have the course mustard called for, so I substitued with the new French's Sweet Onion mustard.  Even my 13 year old, who swears she does not like seafood, devoured her skewer of shrimp! **Also, I cut down the amount of mustard called for!  I only used 1 TBSP of mustard, and that was PLENTY!!  Enjoy.

I prepared this exactly as written and we really enjoyed it just as the recipe stands. Nice, pleasant balance of flavors without being overpowering. We grilled them on an indoor grill, on bamboo skewers. I especially liked the addition of the fresh basil.

Great recipe. I used 1 Tb Dijon and placed them on the grill in one of those BBQ grill pans. I let them cool and added them at the last minute to the "Angel's Pasta" recipe on this site. Tasty light summer meal. This recipe now has a permanent place in my file. Thank you Gail.

The BEST marinade for shrimp! Goes well with mahi mahi too. For those who think it doesn't deserve 5 stars, you may want to try it again.  Here's my suggestion.  Don't use dry mustard.  I used 2 tbsp stone ground (Inglehoffer) mustard, 2 tbsp lemon, 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, 1/2 cup basil, 1lb shrimp, salt & white pepper to taste.

After fixing I was very surprised by the glowing reviews and expected a lot more from this recipe.  My husband and I are gourmet cooks--which means we cook a lot and use a lot of different--sometimes extravagant recipes. We fixed this recipe on Fathers Day.  First of all when you have butter in a "marinade"...it solidifies--which happened! Yuk!  We grow our own herbs so I was very excited about using our abundant amount of basil.  After grilling tho the flavors were way too subtle.  I expected much more from this recipe.  We have other recipes that are far superior and will put bring out the amazing taste of our basil.

AWESOME!!!!  I used jumbo shrimp, double butter, lemon pepper (didn't have a lemon), spicy brown mustard, dried basil, added a bit more garlic powder, about 6 drops of hot sauce, and a little crushed red pepper; marinated for about 3 hours and grilled on skewers with charcoal & hickory chips for approx 10-15 minutes.  Whipped up some fettucine and olive oil and seasonings for the leftovers (the few there were) and hid it for MY lunch the next day!  OH MY GOODNESS!!!  You have GOT to try this one!!

This was pretty good. I tried it at home before cooking it for a crowd. The butter doesn't seem to work. It just recongeals in the refrigerator. When I cooked it for a wedding reception, I used all olive oil. The recipe turned out great!

Great flavor!  For a twist, I marinate in a casserole dish, throw some canned tomatoes on top, and bake in the oven at 350 for 15-20 minutes.  A nice, easy base to toss with pasta or rice.

I sauteed the shrimp and it turned out wonderful! I used Dijon mustard and thought it to be a little too strong, I will half the mustard next time but will certainly make this again. Much better than anything at Red Lobster!

I thought this was spectacular!!!  I used two pounds of shrimp and it was too late and cold to grill it, so I just heated up my cast iron skillet.  When it was smoking hot I threw the shrimp and marinade in together....then served it with angel hair pasta and asparagus.  It was soooo yummy, all the kids ate it, even the picky oldest one!!  I combination of flavors was outstanding.  Careful with the salt...next time I'll even use a little more white pepper.  Definitely a keeper!!!

Only had 15 shrimp and mixed the marinade exactly as recipe offers... AMAZING. The high rated reviews stating there is too much mustard should use honey Dijon mustard. I can't say I have ever had this great of a marinade for seafood before! Will definitely use again and will try on chicken and fish. It was an absolute pleasure to review this recipe because I ran to the computer as soon as my plate emptied!

I have done this marinade many times and it is awesome! I have not always had all the ingredients and it is still OK. Dry basil works. Any kind of mustard works--not quite as well, but it will work. I like to keep a bottle of lemon juce on hand for this so I don't need fresh lemons. I usually add a few extra squeezes from the bottle. AND, because it is just a marinade, don't stress about getting the perfect amounts in. Do it to your taste, or just eyeball it.

Our favorite way to grill it is with frozed deveined, shell on shrimp. We thaw almost all the way under warm running water, then marinade them at room temperature in this marinade, shell on. The marinade does penetrate the shell enough because the shell is open on the back from being deveined. This solves the problem of the oils clumping that others mentioned. Then we grill them in the shell. This makes the shrimp so moist. They won't get all dried out on the grill. And there is no need to skewer because they won't fall through the grill with the shell on. Just plop them on and flip once. Couldn't be easier! Then we all peel and eat.

We serve this at a lot of parties and get tons of requests for the recipe. I'm glad I found it!

Loved this but hubby said only 3 stars - had to compromise at 4. Made a few changes - due to earlier reviews, only used 2 TB mustard (bottled dijon); subsituted half of butter as smart balance to decrease fat a bit; used one 3/4 oz(by weight) pakg of fresh basil; had to use lemon juice from plastic lemon (didn't have fresh!); and used only 1# shrimp. Served over 1 box spaghetti with reheated leftover marinade, an extra clove of garlic, extra fresh basil, and 4 fresh tomatoes, diced. Sprinkled with parm cheese and served with garlic bread. Thanks for sharing Gail.

We ended up putting the shrimp and marinade in a skillet and simmering it instead of the bbq.  It turned out great!  Served on top of Cappelletti pasta with olive oil and capers mixed into the pasta.  Will definitely make it again.

There is a burn ban in force in Texas right now so I couldn't BBQ these. Instead, I did not skewer them & I sauteed them in a skillet. They were wonderful! I am not terribly big on mustard but tried the recipe as is & am I ever glad I did. It just wouldn't be near as tasty w/out the mustard. Also, the store had no fresh basil & being winter, neither do I,  so I used basil in a tube (it's semi-fresh & worked really well). I marinaded the shrimp several hours, sauted them & then thickened up the marinade a bit, pouring it over the shrimp. I served them w/ pasta w/ a sun-dried tomato pesto but next time I will make more of this sauce to use on rice or pasta...it was really good.

Delicious!  It was so hot outside that we didn't want to fire up the outdoor grill, so settled for the countertop grill instead.  I put four shrimp on each skewer, using two skewers for each set of 4 shrimp to keep them nice and flat and avoid "spinning" every which way.  I adjusted them at angles a couple of times while cooking to make nice grill marks.  Meanwhile, I scraped the remaining marinade out of the glass pan and simmered it on the stove.  As the marinade cooked, the garlic and basil released their wonderful flavors. (Note:  watch the amount of salt; it seems to become more concentrated while simmering on the stove.)  When the shrimp were done on the grill, I brushed them on both sides with the cooked marinade for even more flavor.  The shrimp looked beautiful -- coral pink at the edges and flecked with green bits of basil, and the flavor was awesome.  Next time I think I'll make extra marinade, stir it into cooked rice and place several skewers on top per person for a beautiful main dish presentation.  Terrific, restaurant-quality recipe; the family (including a very picky college-aged daughter) loved it.

Gail, this was an awesome recipe. Is everyone afraid of mustard and lemon? Sometimes I think people are afraid to try things in a recipe and come up with their own ideas. The amounts of everything were perfect, and to all you people who think you know best, guess what, you all missed out. Why do you look for recipes if you change them totally before you even know what they taste like? Sometime a combination of ingredients surprise us when mixed together.

This was awesome, took the advice of other reviewers and cut the mustard in half and used about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I marinated them for 3 hours without the lemon juice and then poured that on top during the last 20 minutes. Served with wild rice and grilled asparagus -- delish!

Oh YUMMY YUMMY, these were tasty.  The only thing I did different *I think* was use precooked shrimp, so it only took 2 minutes on BBQ, and added some kosher sea salt at the end.  Oh my this was really a treat.  Definately make again!
Thanks!

Great recipe and I really liked the fact that you don't have to marinade for hours to get great flavor in the shrimp.   The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle lime juice on the shrimp right before cooking.  This avoids the problem of the juice cooking the shrimp while they marinade.

We did this grilled as a Mother's Day side dish.  Awesome reviews even from the kids!!  Served it with the Firecracker Grilled Salmon (allrecipes) a pasta salad and grilled pineapple slices for dessert.  
The last time I made this we used dried basil and I gave it 4stars, This time we used fresh and it is a definite 5 Star!!

This recipe was very good and easy.  I used large tiger shrimp and sea scallops for my husband and me, and I cubed a boneless chicken breast for my daughter, who doesn't care for shrimp and scallops.  I broiled the chicken for about 10 minutes total, and the shrimp and scallops for about 5 minutes.  I doubled the marinade recipe, and set aside about half of it to toss with cooked linguine.  This is a keeper!

This was good...a bit messy though.  I did marinate it for a bout 4 hours (like another reviewer suggested).  They turned out really good.  I also cut down on the lemon a bit for fear that it would be too strong.  Thanks for the post.

I gave this recipe 5 stars, buy my husband gave it 3 stars. He thought it was too lemony. If anything, I thought it was too garlicy. Next time I'll cut back on both. Since it was just the 2 of us, I used only 1 lb. of jumbo shrimp, and I reserved some of the marinade. I boiled angel hair pasta, adding chopped broccoli at the very end, and mixed it with the grilled shrimp and reserved marinade (reheated). I completely forgot the white pepper, but added ground black pepper at the end. Very good and easy.

I made the shrimp tonight on the Forman Grill with a salad on the side.  I rated the shrimp a 5, while my husband rated it a 3, hence the 4 rating.  The only thing that I did differently was I used a bag of fresh basil that weighed only 1/2 oz.  I can't imagine how much basil 4 oz.  would be -- there certainly was enough basil.  I also didn't mince the garlic -- just coarsely chopped it so I could remove it from the shrimp since my husband cannot eat the garlic itself.  I didn't add salt, but did add the white pepper.  He said it tasted salty -- but after discussing the ingredients, he thought a little less lemon would be better (and he likes lemon on his fish).  The salad dressing was a little sweet, so that might have affected his taste buds.  I also think cooking the shrimp on a Forman Grill gives a much different finished product regarding taste than when you do it on a grill.  I thought the shrimp were very good -- and I don't like lemon.  I will make again, but will serve with rice and vegetable rather than a salad.  Thanks Gail for the recipe.

I don't eat seafood, but I made this dish for my husband.  He absolutely loved it.  He ate two servings and was asking for a third.  I made it with shrimp and scallops  I will definitely make this again.

Yummy!!! My husband said if he'd ordered it at a restaurant and paid $25 he wouldn't have been disappointed.  I scaled it down easily to one pound of shrimp and that was plenty to feed three with leftovers.  It was also very quick and easy.

We love good food! This recipe was by far the most delicious. I was sceptical as to the amount of basil. The marinade sort of threw me as it was not exactly liquidy. I had been looking for a recipe to use an over abundance of garden basil. Can't tell you how much we "yummed....and yummed" over this dish. Served it with a simple tomato gratinne (which I will share) and a good bottle of red wine. OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!

Love this recipe and make it regularly. Interestingly we've only done it once on the BBQ. Our preference is to prepare as directed, marinate for a few hours in the fridge, then I do a quick sauté of the shrimp in a shallow skillet, marinade and all. Serve with basmati or jasmine rice and some sautéed mushrooms or green beans and its a great (and favourite) meal of ours. Enjoy!

Grilled shrimp for the first time, and we tried this and "Marinated Grilled Shrimp" on this site.  Hubby liked this one, but prefered the other one.  However, this was hands down my favorite.  It had great flavor and I thought all the flavors were proportioned perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly using original Grey Poupon, and I did not find it too lemony, or too basil-ly, or too mustardy as many other review.  And the amount of oil/butter was just right also.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this, halving the mustard as other reviewers suggested, but other than that I followed the recipe.  My main objection to this recipe is the marinade itself.  Once refrigerated, both butter and olive oil solidify, so a lot more of this sticks to the dish than the shrimp.  I think if I were to make this again I’d use canola oil, which doesn't solidify when refrigerated, instead of the olive oil.  That might help.

Update: I make this quite often. Recently I marinated and then followed "Garlic Pasta w/ Prawns" recipe on here. Holy cow, it was awesome!! ///I made this Christmas Eve as an hor' dourve for an Italian themed dinner. Wonderful! I followed exactly but I did only use 2 tablespoons Dijon as some recommended and it was perfect! I opened up my Cuisinart Panini/Grill flat and grilled them. I will definitely make these again or on the grill in the summer as part of an entree! Thanks!

Instead of grilling, I put everything including the marinade into a frying pan, added 1/2 cup white wine, and cooked on the stove top.  Served it over quinoa - delicious.

I have been searching forever it seems for a shrimp marinade that had just the right stuff. THIS IS IT! I marinaded the shrimp for 1 hour and grilled them on skewers and they were perfect. Kids and adults alike gobbled them up. Recommend only fresh basil. Thanks for sharing!

How surprisingly delicious this recipe is!!!  I am a seafood fanatic and have made so many marinades for seafood skewers, but was not prepared for the flavor of this recipe!  I used jumbo shrimp and for an additional touch, I added 1 lb of sea scallops to the marinade.  They were so sweet and certainly compliment the shrimp!!  You absolutely have to make this recipe with zucchini, red and yellow bell peppers, sweet red onion and mushrooms.  Try this recipe with the "Strawberry Spinach Salad" found also on this website, and you will have a summer patio meal!  Don't forget the chardonnay!  Thanks, Gail!!

it was good. I took advice from other users and used all olive oil. I cut down the mustard by a tablespoon. I used dried basil.  I used small shrimp and next time I will use the larger shrimp.

This is a very flavorful marinade that I use all the time.  I also cook haricot vert in this marinade and add chopped crispy bacon or real bacon bits.  I serve it with the shrimp.  That's a great combination.

I used the marinade portion of this recipe to flavor fish for fish tacos.  It turned out great.  I cut the recipe to 3 servings, which probably helped to ensure I didn't use too much mustard as other reviewers warned.  I baked the fish in the oven and served with broccoli slaw, cheese, and other taco toppings.  I will definitely keep this one and make again.  Thanks.

Based on other reviews I only marianted for 20 minutes and cut back on the mustard.  I think next time I will marinade longer and/or leave the full mustard in.  Still very tasty though.

Five stars with the same modifications others made: reduced the Dijon mustard by half and marinated for about 20 minutes (just long enough for the coals to heat up on the grill). Oh this was restaurant quality and definitely will make again this summer!

I followed some of the advice listed here... used half the butter and not as much lemon juice. Also only had dijon mustard and dried basil on hand. I think it would be 6 stars with fresh b/c I LOVE fresh basil. Really good flavor, delicious on the grill!

A friend brought this dish to a BBQ.
Wonderful appetizer, the mustard gives them just a little zing.  I added the recipe to my recipe box as soon as I got onto the computer.

I used Dijon mustard in lieu of coarse grained and loved the results.  Use large shrimp as they really shrink on the grill.

1 word, YUM!  Even my very picky kids ate this.  I cut the mustard in half but otherwise followed the recipe.  I had to saute it on a the stove, but it was excellent and the marinade made a lovely sauce over noodles.  We will definitely have this again!

Excellent, fast and easy.  I did not grill it but rather sauteed everything (including marinade) in a large skillet and served it over spaghetti noodles.  My slight modification was to add coconut oil in place of the olive oil and I used basil paste instead of fresh basil.  I also thickened the marinade with cornstarch and tossed in some brocolli.  My husband cannot eat garlic so I left it out and it still had great flavor.

I may have messed something up but I did not enjoy this at all. I felt like there was too much lemon juice and the white pepper should be omitted. I also only added 2 tablespoons of the dijon mustard. I may try this again but change some things.

Just ok....nothing special.  Not sure what could have made it more memorable since the ingredients did catch my attention.  Probably won't make again.

This was excellent.  Followed the recipe as written except only marinated for about 20 minutes before grilling.  Bought a little basil plant and plucked the leaves straight from the plant to the marinade.  Made for a group of 6 dinner guests.  ALL loved it and wanted the recipe.  Will make again for sure!  Great for a summer cook-out.

This was OUTSTANDING!!! I let the shrimp marinade for about an hour on the counter. I brushed the rest of the marinade on the shrimp while they were cooking. Reducing the recipe to serve six brought everything down to work for 2 pounds of shrimp. Use fresh basil, it is the key!

Love this sauce!  We use it over and over!  Know it by heart!  The mustard gives it a little bit of zip!  Have found that it's also good with cooked veggies and fish.

very nice flavor of basil with shrimp. easy toput together in mere minutes and marinade is easily adjustable.  I did not use all of the 1/4 cup butter. I used tons of fresh basil, lemon juice, garlic cloves and grey poupon mustard.  I thnk next time I will cut back on teh amount of mustard however so it will be more subtle among all other flavors in this dish. The marinating and cooking time is approximate. I served this over mushroom rice pilaf.

The recipe was great. i didnt have dijon mustard, so to avoid it tasting only salty and sour, i added 3tbs brown sugar.  i also mixed between fresh sweet basil leaves and dried basil. the prawns were nicely glazed due to the sugar and it have an awesome balance of sweet, sour and salty. simply delicious!

I used this marinade and cooked the shrimp on the Big Green Egg (direct heat,  no wood chips).  They turned out great -- no leftovers.  I didn't change the recipe at all, but I don't measure anything so it might have been a bit different, I tend to go heavy on things like garlic and lemon juice.  I marinated for about four hours in the fridge before grilling.

This recipe was great as written.  However, I did not add the butter to the marinade.  I did saute instead of grill and melted butter in the pan before adding the seafood.  Also, I used half shrimp and half bay scallops.  I would recommend just the shrimp.  Delish!  I will use this recipe again.

Very good, I didnt have 3lbs of shrimp, so I used 1.5lbs shrimp and marinated them in a ziploc.  Then took other half of marinade and marinated fresh veggies:mush,zucchini, yellow squash, onions in separate bag for 3 hours.  Put all on kabobs.. grilled fantastic.  Also used only 1.5 TABS of mustard.

Good recipe but doesn't taste very basil-y.  Next time we make this we will try and blend all the ingredients (double the basil) and use that for the marinade.

Delicious! I made this for some friends and everyone loved it. I doubled the mainade recipie and used half of it to marinate the veggies (baby potatoes, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, red and orange peppers, and zuchini). I let the veggies marinate for 2 hours and they really soaked up the flavor of the marinade. I highly recommend this recipe!

I found that these were just okay in taste.  Not bad, just not enough flavor.  We're definitely going to stick with the "Marinated Grilled Shrimp" recipe from this site instead.  It's MUCH better.

WOW. This is a GREAT recipe. I didn't use 3 whole tablespoons of mustard because I don't love a strong mustard taste. That was my only change to this recipe. My son put one shrimp in his mouth and his eyes got HUGE and before he even finished chewing he mumbled the words I WANT THIS ON MY BIRTHDAY PUHLEASE! Way to go Gail!

I marinated for about 30 minutes as I didn't want the citrus to cook the shrimps. I threaded them on bamboo skewers and placed under the broiler for about 6 minutes on each side. Love them!

I cut the mustard in half and followed everything else exactly.  I let the shrimp marinade for just over an hour, and yes the citrus did start to cook the shrimp, however it did not alter the texture of shrimp at all.  I had several people tell me it was some of the best shrimp they had ever had.

Delicious, put them in a grill basket because it takes forever to skewer things. Wish I had made more!! Also added a little Tabasco to the marinade then heated up the leftover marinade and added it to some noodles.

I upped the garlic, lowered the mustard and used 2 pounds of jumbo shrimp.  I tossed them onto a HOT veggie-tray on the grill for a few minutes....tossing around a bit till just cooked. SIMPLE & DELISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I must really like mustard, because I love this recipe and do not think the mustard is overpowering!  I have made this several times and have always gotten compliments.  I do use dijon for the mustard, but no other substitutions.

YUM. I don't make seafood that often, but this recipe makes me want to start! It's super easy, I just threw all the ingredients into a ziplog bag and shook it up really well. I let it marinade for about 2 hours before skewering and then grilling. I also used the jumbo prawns as it seems like they would work better for skewering, but this added to the grilling time. I served with grilled asparagus and pasta tossed with parmesan and garlic powder. Perfect summer night meal.

This is a tasty, yet simple recipe.  We have made this numerous times, but tonight I decided to omit the butter and use all olive oil.  This made it much healthier and my husband and I couldn't tell the difference.  I'll do it this way all the time now.  Enjoy!!

I made this for Mother's Day, and as others suggested, cut the brown mustand in half.  Out of the steak, ribs, salmon and all the side items, this shrimp was the biggest hit!!!!  Will definately make this again.  I bought 2- 2 lb. bags of colossal shrimp at Sam's for only $12 and this recipe made it well worth it!

i found this recipe to be quite an interesing combination of ingredients. like many other reviewers, i doubted that the diverse flavors would meld together..... however somehow they do! i used a pound of jumbo shrimp & marinated them overnight. the melted butter will solidify so be prepared to gentle pull the shrimp apart from the marinade when it's time to skewer them (with red onion & par-boiled bell peppers). i then simmered the marinade with a heaping cup of sliced mushrooms & served it over al dente angel hair. there was just enough sauce to lightly coat 8 oz. of pasta. this is a very unique recipe. thank you gail!

This was awsome! I made it for the first time to take to a gathering on the 4th of July. Everyone gobbled this down fast all the while oohing and awwing at how good it was. I did modify slightly because I do not care for course ground mustard so I used dijon and it was perfect. I have since used this marinade on thin sliced chiken breasts that I served over pesto fettucine, MMM. The fresh basil on the meat makes a great presentation. Bravo!

Fabulous!!! Made this recipe this weekend and it was a huge hit. I used only 2 lbs. of raw shrimp and thought the marinade was just enough. I did have some extra that I used to baste the shrimp while grilling. Love the taste...very easy to make, and everyone loved it. Will make again real soon. Was surprised how the marinade "thickened" as the melted butter cooled...I did, however, melt down the rest of the marinade in a saucepan and baste the shrimp for extra flavor!! Great recipe!! Thanks Gail!!

We thought the shrimp tasted too much like mustard.  More like Sardines in a mustard sauce.
Will try it with only a touch of mustard.

WOW -- excellent!  We tried it both hot off the grill (to taste) and chilled (as an appitizer for a cook out).  Chilled was good, but hot off the grill had a much better flavor -- next time it will be a main dish.

Wow- this is good! I used 2 cloves garlic and it was plenty. I marinated the skewers in the fridge for several hours and while they were grilling, a neighbor came over to the fence to see what smelled so good! This dish is worthy of company- very pretty on the plate with pasta or rice and a salad.

It turns out that I had a non-seafood eater at my table, so I shredded some chicken, marinated it in some extra basil sauce (mine was in more of a paste form, but it was delicious), and tossed it with some angelhair pasta...dust it with some white pepper and a touch of kosher salt, and I was ready to roll!  It was a great save - I wasnt sure if the flavor would work, but my guest loved it.  Party saved!!

Delicious! I used whole grain dijon mustard and marinated it overnight. I also made BBQ ribs and chicken...but when my 11-month-old son got a taste of each, he only wanted the shrimp! Big hit with everyone at my barbeque!

I've made this receipe twice with the same results- everyone loves it!!! It is soooo easy to make and smells wonderful . I used my Forman grill and it worked great -cooked in no time at all and very little clean up. This receipe is a keeper.

I had my reservations at first.  Only because I wasn't sure about the corse ground prepared mustard.  All I had was Wal-mart brand squirt mustard! :-)  And the basil I bought was not measured.  So I winged it, hoping for the best, and WOW!  this was so good.  Will definately make it again.  So delicious and impressive, I will serve for company.  Probably as an appetizer though, because feeding shrimp to this shrimp loving family got costly.  Not to mention having to count out all the pieces to make sure everyone got their fair share!  :-)

This marinade gave the shrimp a good flavor.  I added zuchini, onions, mushrooms, and bell pepper to the skewers and it was a great meal served with rice or noodles.

Yummmm! I halved the mustard and only marinated for 20 min, as recommended, and also doubled the garlic. Perfect! I served it with corn on the cob and the Orzo with Parmesan and Basil from this site. . . very nice, light summer meal:)

This was by far the best shrimp I have ever eaten. The only change I made was to cut the amount of mustard in half.  Thanks for sharing.

Meh. These were "OK." Nothing special, IMHO (sorry!). My fiance and I entertained last night. We wanted to grill (the weather was soooo nice this weekend), but because of our schedule, I needed to find something easy to prepare. The fact that this took 10 minutes to put together and only one hour to marinate sold me. Not to mention, I LOVE basil - and this called for plenty of it! Ironically, I couldn't taste the basil at all. The marinade smelled delicious, but the end product seriously lacked flavor. My fiance cooked these a little too long, but I don't fault the recipe for that lol! Served with couscous, grilled asparagus (Larry Lampert), rosemary focaccia and classic strawberry shortcakes (Bisquick recipe, also on this site) for dessert, this was a decent meal, but nothing that I'd serve again. My guests seemed to enjoy these though.... Thanks anyways, Gail! :-)

Instead of marinating and all, I simply saute the shrimp.  As per the previous discussion, I reduced the lemon juice too.  It's great tasting.

This recipe is fantastic just the way it is.  I followed it exactly but didn't have dijon mustard so I used brown horseradish mustard and it still came out wonderful.  I did not think it was too lemony or too mustardy at all.  My advice is to try it as it is written and then adjust to your specific taste if necessary.

I scaled down this recipe to serve 2 since it was only for me and my husband. I didn't change anything except the length of time for marinating it - about 20 minutes instead of the 1 hour suggested. I think that helped lessen the impact of the mustard flavor as we had no overwhelming taste of that at all like others have mentioned. I used my cast iron grill pan to cook it 2 minutes on each side. I served the shrimp on a bed of couscous with a side of asparagus and a green salad. Excellent. I will do this again.

Wow! So easy and so delicious! Tweaked it a bit and only used olive oil instead of butter/oil combo, increased the garlic because we are both garlic lovers. Definitely use fresh basil-taste is worth it. I grilled them on bbq for about 3 minutes per side on med high- perfection! Thanks for the outstanding recipe- it's a keeper!

This was the best grilled shrimp recipe ever! Very succulent and was the rave at a recent barbecue. I placed the skewerd shrimp on a slotted grill tray to prevent them from slipping off. This worked very well.

These were delicious. I tasted the marinade prior to adding the shrimp and didn't think it tasted very good, but decided to go ahead with it anyway. I'm glad I did! Served with Insalata Caprese and grilled italian bread. Yum!

This is so yummy! The only change I made was to use dijon mustard instead of spicy brown...other than that I followed the recipe exactly. At first the marinade smelled really strong of mustard, but it was not overpowering in the end result at all.  The balance of flavors was so delicious.  I was concerned because previous reviewers stated the flavor was lacking, but I thought the flavor was superb..it didn't need any additions or tweaking. My husband raved about it, and we both gobbled it up! I've been looking for a really good grilled shrimp recipe, and I've finally found it, Thanks!

This was a very good and flavorful recipe. I must have imagined or dreamed that my basil plant came back to life after the winter -- it didn't so I ended up having to use a dried italian seasoning blend (basil, oregano), and it worked just great.

This was a real hit with the kids. We served the shrimp skewers with buttered garlic noodles and a green salad.

This Was GREAT!  I used a milder brown mustard than the Gouldens...  We tried both ways of cooking... with the shell left on and with it off.  Off was best and got the most flavor during the marinating process.  This will become the hit of our next party!

Great recipe for shrimp. When I went to the grocery there was no basil, so I substituted celantro. It was decelicious. I also served it over wild rice.

I love shrimp, and I like them just in a big bowl with extra sauce and crusty bread. I have been trying several of the shrimp recipes on the website and will now add the addition of basil to all my shrimp in abowl with lemony, garlicky, paprika, and don't forget the Marsala cooking wine. I marinate the shrimp inthe oil sauces and then add a cup of chicken stock heat the shrimp remove them into serving bowls and add the Marsala. Reduce the mixture in the pan and por over shrimp. yum. I could it this everyday!

This is an awesome marinade. I marinaded for an hour and next time I probably will marinade a little longer for a bit more flavor but even at an hour there is plenty of taste. I didn't have any white pepper so I just used black pepper and it was fine. Other reviews stated that the marinade hardened in the fridge due to the butter and it did a bit but nothing that caused any problems. If nothing else you get more marinade on the shrimp due to the chunks. I highly recommend this recipe as it is simple and extremely tasty!

My wife doesn't like mustard, so we were skeptical, considering the marinade smelled strongly of the brown mustard. But when eating, she exclaimed that this recipe was truly restaurant quality! I only used about half the fresh basil called for. These were absolutely incredible!

Great recipe! I don't have a grill and since oven was busy, I cooked them on the stove. The marinade made a creamy sauce, delicious on angel hair pasta.

We cooked and skewered these delightful shrimp over the weekend and I've never had such great feedback about our cooking before.  I highly recommend this recipe and the 1 hour marinade gives it extra points in my book.  :)

I was looking for an easy recipe for grilled/BBQ shrimp and after reading reviews of several recipes here on allrecipes.com, I decided to give this one a try.  I did make some changes: used more olive oil and less butter like another reader did.  Also omitted the brown mustard altogether as my husband and I do not care for the flavor.  Lastly, after marinading for about 30-45 minutes, I sauteed/cooked them on the stovetop.  Even with these changes it came out very tasty!  Served with angel hair pasta tossed w/canned Dei Fratelli tomatoes (the version w/olive oil and herbs) and a slice of cheesy garlic toast.  This was so delicious - tasted and looked like a top restaurant!  Will definitely make again and next time I will try to grill it on the BBQ!

This is a wonderful marinade. I used dijon mustard, and the basil chopped fine. Excellent on grilled salmon and halibut - the salmon was even great cold the next day.

Excellent!  Used pre-cooked shrimp, marinated 8 hours and grilled 1-2 minutes per side.  I drained the marinade and tossed with hot penne pasta for a great side dish (didn't have to boil it because the shrimp weren't raw).

Very good.  I did not have fresh basil so I ended up using dried basil and the taste was still very good.  I cannot wait to try fresh next time I make this recipe.  It was a hit with everyone.  Thanks Gail

I wanted a good recipe to use my basil in my garden and came across this.  The only thing I changed was omitting all the butter and just using a splash of olive oil...I'm trying to watch my figure!  Even with these changes the flavor was amazing!

This was so delicious and easy to make. Next time I might try to decrease the butter a little and increase the oil to make a slightly thinner marinade. I found that the marinade stuck to the shrimp quite a bit. Which is great when its hot. But if the shrimp is not eaten while very hot, the marinade cools on the shrimp and the butter solidifies a little.

The mustard surprised me when I ate this dish.  The basil fragrance was astounding!  My condo smelled like a fine restaurant for hours!

I didn't have a grill, but I put it in my toaster oven and watched it very carefully.

I read the reviews and was really excited about this dish...however, I thought it was a bit greasy from the butter.  This could just be me, I really like my shrimp to be very light and healthy.  I did saute the shrimp, rather than on the BBQ, which probably made things a little heavier.  I will probably try it again, except this time it will be on the BBQ grill.

I mixed zucchini, red pepper and mushrooms in the marinade and cooked it all in a grill basket. I stirred it a few times as it was cooking. I also didn't use any of the melted butter in the recipe and it was delicious!

These are yummy. I marinated mine for over 24 hours, and the taste was great.  I tasted the marinade first, as I am not a great lover of basil, and felt it would also make a good salad dressing.  One Warning:  I used what I thought was 'just enough' salt, and it came out very salty.  Next time I will use no added salt at all.  I also used grainy brown mustard, which adds wonderful flavor.  A keeper for sure.

Wow, this was really good! I ended up using normal French's mustard because I couldn't get brown mustard. It still tasted great! I made this for a get together and everyone loved it! Even people that don't like mustard loved this and was surprised that mustard was even an ingredient.
Definately try this, you'll be glad you did!

This shrimp recipe is outstanding!!!  We have made it twice in 2 weeks and my husband can't stop talking about it.  We didn't change a thing except to add some peppers, onions, and mushrooms to the skewers when we grilled.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

If we could have given 6 stars!  It was SO good.  I used lemon juice instead of real lemons, and I used dried basil.  Also I only had honey mustard.  It turned out fabulous.  I will make again for company.  It would be great served with steak and chicken kabobs!

This could be the best recipe I've tried off this site.  I don't usually write reviews, but I had to for this...it was outstanding!!  Everyone loved it.  My store was out of basil (I always use fresh), so I used fresh arugla instead and it still turned out fantastic.

Amazing!!! We loved it. I served it with couscous and red peppers, a salad and some corn on the cob. I only used approx. 2 pounds of shrimp, so the marinade coated each shrimp well. 

Great recipe that we will definitely be making a staple in our household!

I prepared this on the 4th of July. I must say that I was a little disappointed after all the rave reviews. It was good, don't get me wrong, just not GREAT. Haven't decided whether or not I will try again.

Our most favorite way to make shrimp on the grill now! (we have made it at least 30 times)  We use Dijon mustard and everyone wants the recipe.

My husband in kids (4 and 1 1/2) adored it! This recipe is a keeper. I know we will make this a lot this summer. I can't wait to go to the beach and get fresh shrimp. YUM!!!

This was a hit with everyone. I used only 2 pounds of peel and eat shrimp
and served this as a appetizer for 8 people.

this was so delicious!  i cut the recipe in half and used it on a little over a pound of shrimp.. i used all oil, lime instead of lemon, regular mustard, and dried basil.. doubled the garlic by accident.. marinated for about 20 minutes and cooked the shrimp in the marinade on my stovetop.. scooped the shrimp out and cooked some cauliflower florets in the broth.. it was to die for.. i literally licked my plate clean.. ty so much for the recipe ~UPDATE: this time i stuck a little more closely to the recipe.. i cut this down to 3 servings and used 1 T each of olive oil, dijon mustard, and bottled lemon juice.. left out the butter.. used 1/2 t kosher salt (will do 1/4 next time) and a couple of shakes of black pepper.. only had dried basil so used 2 t.. would love to try the fresh stuff.. marinated for 15-20 mins.. bf grilled these on the gas grill on our Island Grillstone.. the end result tasted pretty good but i wanted an acid on the end.. i dipped them in greek yogurt.. fresh lemon would be optimal.. ty again for the recipe

I followed the recipe, cutting the amount of mustard down as suggested by another review..  Grilled both large sea scallops and giant prawns..  They were equally amazing and it would be hard to say which was best..  For someone not familiar with grilling scallops…they can be a bit tricky and it is easy to overcook..They cook faster than prawns, so remove when they are a bit undercooked..they will continue to cook on their own while the prawns finish..

Really good! However, decided to brown the shrimp in a sauce pan after marinating.

I made this recipe as directed with no changes.  I did not think that the mustard flavor was too strong, as some others suggested.  The strong mustard aroma of the marinade mellowed on the grill and I mostly tasted the basil and the shrimp in the finished dish.  This was a mildly spiced shrimp that would pair nicely with just about any side.

This was okay, not great.  I took reviewer's advice and halved the mustard but the lemon was my problem. Too strong and wasn't balanced for me.

This was really very good and a hit with my party guests! I didn't have time or money for raw shrimp, so I used already cooked shrimp and warmed them up in a skillet. Still came out perfectly!!!! My only regret was that I didn't make more :)

This recipe is very good and for those that wonder about adding the mustard, trust me it works. However, I would reduce it in half.  I also used all olive oil instead of melted butter (it doesn't need it) and increased the garlic as a personal preference.  Nice flavors!

Excellent! I made this tonight and it was outstanding. I pan seared the shrimp instead of grilling. Added a lime and only did 1 tbl spoon of honey dijon. Really was amazing, a must try!

I've made this several times.  The only reason it gets a 4 instead of 5 is because of the instructions.  Never marinade seafood for longer than 15 min.  The flavor is awesome and it is a breeze to put together.

I would make again.  First time I cut recipe in half to try it out.  I also reduced the mustard to half again per other reviewers.  Glad I  did. I think that amount gave a good balance of lemon, mustard tang, and basil.  I did use 3 garlics because we like our garlic.  If you are a seafood eater this is nice to have in rotation.

I made this last night for dinner.  We loved it!  I made a second batch of the Marinade and thickened it up with some cornstarch and heavy cream.  I then poured this on top of bow tie pasta.  What a treat! My boyfriend wanted extra dipping sauce for the shrimp so the next time I make it I will do 3 batches of the marinade.

I sauteed this. I don't have a bbq. It still turned out beautifully. Ins
 I let it marinade for about 15 minutes and then put the shrimp and marinade in the skillet. Definitely a favorite. :)

Simple, fast, delicious!  Have made several times on outdoor grill as well as on indoor grill pan during inclement weather.  Very flavorful and easy.  Substituted butter with olive oil for a healhier option. Have served the basil shrimp as entree as well as part of an orzo pasta salad-- delicious!  Can serve warm or cold for a great summer time option.  My kids begged me to pack them leftovers for school lunches!  Was just as flavorful when I didn't have an hour to marinade.

I cut back the recipe to serve 3 people and use 1 lb. of shrimp. My changes were 1 TBL. olive oil, 1 TBL. lemon, 1 TBL. basil and 1/2 TBL. mustard. It marinated half the day. I think I would increase the mustard and lemon next time; other reviews had scared me off.

So good!  I made the recipe as written and only marinated for about 25 minutes.   2 lbs of shrimp were GONE between 4 people in record time!

Winner winner shrimp dinner!  I put together a tapas style birthday dinner and this was one of our dishes.  It was so so good.  I used regular dijon, since that is what I had, and sauteed the shrimp in a pan with the olive oil, butter and garlic.  About 1 minute from being done, I added the "sauce".  It thickened up nicely and tasted fantastic!

Yum!!!  I followed other's advice and lessened the amount of mustard, not sure if it would've been too much or not.  I used this recipe for tailgating, so mixed the marinade in a ziplock and put the skewered shrimp in a different bag.  I threw the shrimp in with the marinade as I was getting the grill ready, so not with it very long.  I absolutely loved this and will be making it for our next tailgating party!

Delicious!  I tried using dried basil once when I ran out of fresh - big mistake!  The fresh is a must to get the true flavor of this dish.  I've also reserved some of the marinade and tossed the cooked shrimp in with some buttered noodles - the lemony, basily, mustardy taste is wonderful!

I love shrimp cooked any way and this will be on the top of my list,  I did not change anything in this recipe.  I served this with a cheese grits souffle (found in a grits cookbook) and green beans.  What a meal with many flavors going on.  mmmmmmmm.  Thank you for the recipe

This is the best shrimp I have made yet!! I was skeptical about having too much basil favor, but it's perfect. I did not add as much mustard and used mostly butter and not much olive oil. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

These tasted like plain, unseasoned grilled shrimp, although I did cut the marinating time as some reviews suggested. I wonder if that was a mistake, OR if the marinade cooked off as the shrimp cooked. I also wonder if the marinade would have made a better dipping sauce for the shrimp. It seemed like they needed dipping sauce...Anyway, thanks for the recipe. Will make again, but will alter it in some way.

Great recipe!  Like most people, I halfed the mustard (and I used dijon instead of spicy brown) but it turned out really great.  My mother loved it and commented on what great flavor it had.  I also only marinated the shrimp for about 20 minutes and cooked them stovetop instead of grilling, it still turned out amazing.  I served them with Herb & Butter rice, corn on the cob, and sliced tomatoes for a bit of color.  Great, light yet filling meal.

I cut the mustard to 1 tablespoon because of some reviews and I am not a huge mustard fan.  We enjoyed this but am glad I cut the mustard down.  While I was eating these I was wondering what honey mustard would do to this recipe---might try next time because I often use honey mustard in my salmon marinade.

I think it is very important to grill the shrimp directly over the flames (lowest rack on grill). This was fantastic.  I used dijon mustard because it was on hand.  Fabulous just like the recipe reads although I only used 1 lb. of large shrimp (16/20 count) I did not have alot of marinade left over. I marinated for 1 hour and cooked about 4 minutes. Perfect!

Amazing!  The only thing I did differently was use my hand blender to mix all of the ingredients together before marinating.  Sine I was doing a 'surf and turf' dinner, I cut up some sirloin to skewer as well. Marinated the beef for a couple hours and the shrimp for a half hour.  I think the shrimp was tastier, but both very good.  Will definitely make this again.

Today at Home Goods I bought a little grill for my BBQ, so off I went to buy some shrimp to grill.  This recipe worked out perfectly!  My jumbo shrimp weighed in at 3/4 lb (for two of us), so I calculated the recipe for three.  I needed to extend the marinade a little, so I added a couple tablespoons of tequila.  They were very good.  We will definitely have this again!  Thank you!

This recipe is hands down my favorite shrimp dish.  Every time I make this recipe everyone in my family gets excited.  I follow the recipe exactly as written.  I have been making this dish for a couple of years now and have tried to cheat a few times by using dried Basil.  PLEASE do yourself a favor and use only FRESH Basil, it makes a huge difference.  Also you can add a few chips of Apple wood to the charcoal for a nice hint of smoky flavor!

Recipe is simply perfect. So easy and delicious. Didn't really think the flavor would be as intense as it was. My guests were asking if I had somehow injected the shrimp with the marinade...that's how tasty they were. I used large tiger striped shrimp (deveined, kept the shell on, making them more moist after grilling. I served them with grilled veggie kabobs of cherry tomatoes, onions, green and yellow bell peppers and pineapple over saffron rice.

I made this for Father's Day.  I used honey mustard instead of brown mustard.  It was delicious. Even those who usually don't like shrimp tried it and liked it.  We used blue shrimp from Mexico and they were SO easy to clean.

Delicious.  I used Dijon mustard and extra-jumbo shrimp.  I don't think the mustard was overpowering at all.  The flavor was very good.

WOW! This is a KEEPER!  I made one small mistake in leaving out the mustard, but realized it about 10 min. after is was in the refridgerator - I added the mustard to the bowl of marinating ingredients, and mixed it up well.  This was so delicious - my family could not get enough!

MMMMMMMMMM Delicious!  A hit at the BBQ! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  I let it marinate over night.  I even remembered to soak my bamboo skewers in water so that they didn't burn on the grill!

Awesome....my husband and I loved this. I, too, left the shells on, and this made the shrimp very moist. I marinated for 3 hours. It was great.

I myself do not eat shrimp, but I made this recipe on Mother's Day, and both my parents said it was great.  I liked it because it was easy to prepare.  To keep the juices on them better, I "linked" the shrimp, kind of like they were facing each other, which made it easier to brush the marinade on them while grilling too.  I also used two skewers through each to make them easier to flip on the grill.  I'm guessing I'll be getting requests for this one again!

Why hasn't anyone mentioned that when you refrigerate the shrimp to "marinate", the oil and butter in the marinade solidify??    When we removed the shrimp from the refrigerator, we were surprised to see that the marinade was hard and stuck to the shrimp in a few places, but mostly just fell off into the bottom of the bowl.  In the end, we ended up skewering the shrimp, melting down the "marinade" and we just brushed it on while grilling.  The end result was very good (hence the 4 star rating), we will likely make this again, but will skip the marinating step.

Mmmmm. Love this!  Simmered it in the marinade with about 1/4 cup white wine as another suggested.  Shrimp only need to be in the sauce 4-5 minutes tops.  I also added a chopped fresh tomato because I had it. It made for a very colorful dish.

Do not marinade longer than one hour!!!. The acid from the lemon juice actually cooked the shrimp!  When I went to put on grill they wouldn't cook! I messed up! I will try again because I could tell it had great flavor.  I will only marinate ONE HOUR!!

Fabulous! I made this with fresh off the boat shrimp.  It is probably the best I've ever had.  I even used "smart balance light" as the butter. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Sweet! Recipe was perfect. I was a little weirded out by the butter but it was all good!  I grilled them outside on the foil sheets w/ the slits in them for the grill. It was easier to control the heat and turn them over so they stayed juicy. Can't wait to have them again! Add as much basil as you would like - this is an easy scampi like repcipe.

I used honey mustard because I thought it would be a better flavor than the yellow mustard I had on hand...and to experiement, I cooked half on the George Foreman grill and half in the skillet.  The ones from the skillet were infinitely better!  They held their flavor much better...I can't wait to try them on the outside grill!!

outstanding! Wisk  ingredients together and pour over shrimp in a zip lock bag . Grill and gobble them up! I used yellow instead of brown mustard. You would not even know mustard was part of the recipe. Fresh basil all the way though!

Great recipe! I added chardonnay and lemongrass to the marinade. My picky husband and kids loved it. Will definitely have to make more next time!  I served it in a bed of wilted spinach, and made tostones (fried plantains)with dipping mojo as side dish. This seemed to have paired off wonderfully. This recipe's a keeper in our book! :o)

i was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.....i did leave out the basil b/c i don't like basil very much, but it was still great.  My husband loved it as well.  I was unsure of the mustard, like everyone else, but it really did give it a kick.  I will be sure to keep this recipe around!

We liked these a lot.  However, even though we only cooked them for a few minutes, it is very easy for the shrimp to dry out and become over-cooked.  Great flavor, though!

Terrific recipe!! I marinated my shrimp overnight,threaded them on bamboo sticks and broiled them early in the day.  I served them with the Linguine and Clam recipe from this site, adding the shrimp with the clams.  My guests devoured everything but the shrimp tails!!!

Oh my goodness!!  This is a fantastic way to enjoy shrimp.  And by eliminating the butter or replacing it with "I can't believe it's not" we can enjoy it while on the South Beach diet!  Since we do not have a grill, I broiled them in the oven.  Gotta watch them so they don't get over-cooked, but the flavors are phenomenal.  Serve this with "Strawberry Spinach Salad I" for a really tasty treat.

Outstanding flavor! I added some other fresh herbs that I had - oregano, parsley and a little rosemary - in addition to the basil.

I made this twice this weekend, it is so good. Note: I did NOT peel the headless shrimp, but they get so crisp on the grill (at 500 degrees) in 4 minutes, that you can just eat it all (not the tails)

I loved this recipe!  I've previously used a recipe similar to this, but without the brown mustard.  I must admit that the mustard adds a great touch.  I loved the marinade so much that I doubled the recipe and used it as a sauce for my pasta.  Thanks for the post, Gail!

This was probably the best grilled shrimp I have ever made.  I cut back just a little on the mustard, like others.  I also briefly cooked the leftover marinade and we dipped the shrimp in it.  Yummy...it's a keeper!

This recipe is truly wonderful.  I've made it several times for my family.  I run the marinade through the food processor before putting it on the shrimp.  Also, for those of us who try to reduce the fat in our cooking, I cut back on the oil and butter a bit and added more lemon juice and mustard to compensate.  Again, an absolutely lovely dish- everyone enjoys it!

This was wonderful!  I used margarine instead of butter to reduce the fat a little.  I didn't have real lemons so used bottled lemon juice.  Only had 1 T left of the coarse grained mustard, so for the other 2 T used regular dijon mustard.  No fresh basil so used some dry.  I served it over pasta with a sauce I made from the left over marinade.  I put the marinade in pan to simmer and added a package of sliced fresh mushrooms.  As it cooked it got a little too thick so I added some white wine to thin it out again.  It was so good!  It was a little on the lemon-y side and my husband commented on it too.  I might use just a little less lemon next time, but we liked it still!  Thank you!  Carol

This is the recipe that hooked me on this site. The first time I met my potential in-laws I made this for 8 people. Everyone loved it. My boyfriend's mother was asked to "get this recipe" from her husband. I hope the recipe didn't go over TOO well :)

This was excellent and very easy. I cut back a little on the butter and added a little more olive oil and lemon juice.  I also eliminated the skewers and just put the shrimp in my grill basket!!  Served w/ couscous and a salad.  Will definately make again...may add scallops next time, also!  Thanks Gail!!!!

Very, very tasty.  All that basil was a bit of a pain, but worth it.  I used my grill basket instead of taking the time for skewers.  Added about 2 minutes per side.  And I only used 2 pounds of shrimp, which was plenty.

If you're serving this as one of many dishes at a cook-out, it's fine as-is, but the flavor is very strong for a main dish.  I combined it with the Lemon Pasta Sauce from this site, and it worked well.  My husband said the shrimp was too strong and the pasta was too bland, so it evened out.

They weren't great, but pretty good.  I didn't know how much basil to use so just cut up about a 1/4 cup.   I served it over butter and garlic angel hair pasta.  Definately think I'll try saving back some marinade and putting that on the pasta instead.

I like this recipe however I deviated given the fact shrimp COOKS in acid. I used a lemon pepper to marinate and added real lemon at the end. Dijon, I will adjust the amount slightly next time for my taste.

If this recipe had been called "Mustard Butter Shrimp", it would have gotten 5 stars. The flavor was really great, but I didn't get much basil in my Basil Shrimp.

Super easy and super quick!
Came across this recipe while looking for a super quick paleo - friendly meal. With no attention to measuring, I just put together as much of each ingredient as I liked and made enough marinade to coat the shrimps completely. Let it rest for about ten minutes and then tossed the whole thing into a hot pan. Voilà. Just right for my taste.

I served this at a cocktail party to rave reviews. It was so simple to make!  I didn't bother putting them on skewers, though. Instead I put them in a single layer in a grill basket and just kept turning them with the spatula.  The cook time was just a minute or two longer.

This was DELICIOUS!  I used fresh basil from my garden (it's about the only edible item in my garden the critters haven't eaten).   I'm planning on having my sister-in-law over for a BBQ this coming weekend and can't wait to serve this.  She is a phenomenal cook so I'm always a little intimidated when we have them for dinner.  I won't worry about serving this!  Thanks, Gail!  This is a KEEPER!

The whole family loved it.  I used honey mustard since it's all I had and LOTS of garlic.  I also added a drop or two of therapeutic grade lemon essential oil because I love the lemon flavor.

Delicious!  I didn't have enough skewers, so I grilled what I could and pan sauteed the rest.  I did use dried basil, only because my fresh had turned, but it still turned out wonderfully and had a great flavor.

The recipe doesn't specify, but I used medium shrimp, and had WAY too many.  Next time I will probably use Large or Jumbo shrimp.  Thanks for a great meal!

YES!!!  Absolutely an epicurean delight!  I give it 5?????.
I made dinner for my cousin tonight and we thought we were in a world class restaurant.  As for previous comments on "too much mustard"...........could not disagree more!  It was not even close to over-powering.  I also added way more fresh garlic than called for.  MMMMM  MMMMM MMM!  Also after the prawns were finished marinating I warmed the remaining marinade and basted each side of the prawns while they were on the bbq.  Recipe is correct when they stated 2 - 3 minutes per side.These were also fresh prawns & NOT previously frozen.

I didn't want to fire up the grill, so I just sauteed the shrimp in a frying pan and they turned out great. I warmed a bit of EVOO in the pan and then poured all of the shrimp AND the marinade into the pan together to simmer. Then I poured all of that onto spaghetti so the marinade became my spaghetti "sauce" with a bit of added EVOO drizzled on (I hate to throw out good marinades!) The only other thing I did differently was marinate for 20 minutes and I did leave the shell on for cooking.

Pretty darn good.  A tad mustardy, but other than that it was good.  I didn't chop the basil up fine enough, I guess, as none stuck to the shrimp.  I marinated for 20 minutes and sautéed on the oven.  As with any shrimp recipe, the better the shrimp you use the better it will taste.

Tried this out on a smaller scale as I only cook for one. Only changes I made was using honey-mustard salad dressing because I did not have Dijon and I used my George Forman grill w/o the skewers. Turned out fantastic!  Loved the flavor combination.  Will be making this again soon!

Very good recipe for shrimp that doesn't take too long to prepare.  I added more basil than called for and it turned out fantastic.  The shrimp really absorbed the marinade without overpowering it.  Definitely a good recipe for people who want to eat fish but can't stand the fishy taste - this recipe totally masks it.

Made this for dinner last night and it was a hit. It is a super quick and easy. The only change I made was to cut the mustard to 2 tablespoons because my husband isn't a big mustard fan...he said its one of his favorite things I've made lately. Will definitely be making again.

This was excellent.  I cut the recipe in third (there are only 2 of us) and reduced the mustard by half per other reviews.  Marinated 20-30 minutes and sauteed quickly on the stove.  Served with the black bean & corn quinoa recipe from this site and everything was fresh, light, and delicious.

This was a great and simple marinade that worked for me since I had a surplus of fresh basil in the garden.  I served it to a dinner guest along with rice pilaf and grilled bell pepper and mushroom skewers (marinated in a balsamic mixture) and he raved about it.  The only substitution I made to the shrimp marinade was to use spicy brown mustard instead of dijon since that's what I had on hand.  I will try it with the dijon next time since it should pair wonderfully with the shrimp and maybe increase the amount of garlic (you can never have too much in my opinion!).  Be sure you put some oil on your grill before cooking, though... shrimp do tend to stick to the hot grating.

One last note: unless you are serving a picky and not-so-hungry dinner crowd, don't expect this to make 9 servings!  I'd guess more like 4-6... you can't get enough.  Thanks for sharing it with us, Gail!

This was excellent and easy.  Could easily be used with scallops or chicken.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used a little jarred pesto.  I have also used concentrated basil in a tube.  First tried this with shrimp during the winter and sauteed the shrimp on  a grill pan.

Excellent dish! Instead of grilling, I broiled the shrimp in the sauce. My husband and I loved it served on a bed of rice as well as Swiss chard.

I used frozen shrimp since that was all I could find. Because of the time restrictions I had they ended up not being completely thawed and therefore the marinade didn't soak in as well. I do believe this would have been a 5 star recipe had I had time to do things correctly. I don't eat shrimp but my husband and a friend really liked it.

I didn't use any oil or butter b/c I can not have them right now, and this recipie still tasted great! So, if you are into more of a "fat free" type of a meal, then just add a bit of water instead of the oil and butter. Don't get me wrong, I am sure the recipie is even better with the oils, it just has to be! I loved how easy this was too. I served it with skewered mushrooms, grape tomatoes, and onions that I sprayed lightly with water on the grill and then sprinkled salt over the wet veggies to help it stick to them a bit better. The onions take about 5 minutes longer than everything else, so start them early!

Awesome Recipe... I used fresh Thai Basil cause that's what I had and I cooked the shrimp in the marinade instead of skewering it.  It turned out great on a bed of Brown Basmati.

This was fabulous!!!  I followed the recipe how it was written. I have a lot of fresh basil growing and a good way to use it up. I also boiled the left over marinade and basted the shrimp while on the grill.  I served with grilled squash and the tomato Bruschetta from this site. It was such a healthy and very yummy dinner!!!

Loved this recipe.  Used a little less olive oil and butter, and I used spicy brown mustard as it's what I had on hand.  Marinated for maybe 20 minutes and they were a hit!

I love shrimp and this recipe was great combination of flavors. Didn't do the 1 hour marinade but still fine. We too did this on our George Foreman grill which made it a breeze. A keeper for sure.

Excellent flavor.  I scaled the recipe to 2 pounds of shrimp.  I used olive oil instead of butter, Beaver brand Deli mustard (from Wal-Mart), and Dorot frozen cubes of basil (from Trader Joe's).  I did not find the mustard flavor overwhelming as others did.  I think perhaps Dijon mustard is not a good choice for this recipe.  I will do this recipe again and again.  Good appetizer, or over pasta, or on a salad.

Excellent and easy!  It poured the afternoon I was making this so I sauteed in a pan like another reviewer did and they were awesome!  My 3 and 6 year old boys asked for seconds.  i did not notice much mustard flavor...could have been the type of olive oil or mustard I used.  I also only added about 2 TBSp of butter

I used 2 lbs of shrimp, and less mustard (as recommended), but next time I would put in at least 2 tbsp - it was a little bland.  I squeezed the lemon juice on just prior to serving rather than marinating it in it (due to "cooking" the shrimp with the citrus). Great.

I have made this many times -- I even prepared the marinade ahead of time and took it camping for an added treat in the wilderness. This is great on its own or over some angel hair pasta. For anyone who likes shrimp, you can't go wrong with this recipe.

*updated*
I made this a second time and added several spices, thyme, cumin, parsley, oregano, the basil, garlic, ect ect I also used some lemon pepper seasoning (the lawreys kind). I marinaded for 35-40 min and cut down on the lemon juice. I cooked them in a pan with some mushrooms then turned the marinade into a sauce and mixed that with some white rice. The shrimp went on top. The family liked this much better than the first time I made this. They said it had more flavor, not just plain. This was a great starter recipe for us, just some tweaking and it suits our taste. My very picky fiancee gave the meal 5 stars, and the company enjoyed it also.

This was alrite, not one of the best but good. I did not use as much lemon juice and did not marinate that long. Shrimp absorbs liquids easily and doesn't need that long, especially with lemon juice since it is so acidic. It could have used a bit more flavor. The recipe is not totally bad just needs some tweaking to suit the family's taste.  Very important though not to marinate to long or your shrimp will turn mushy and chewy, no one wants that

Wow, it basically takes a few minutes to prepare, and the taste is amazing!!!  I added just a bit of white cooking wine and as much of vegetable broth, and it turned out great. I did so because I cooked it in a pan, with some asparagus.  Perfect.

Not sure what all the fuss is about, this wasn't too great to us. Now granted I did not have all the fresh ingredients so I'm giving the recipe the benefit of the doubt w/3 stars, as I prepared it was 2 stars. I did NOT have fresh basil so I used 3 Tbsp dried basil, and 3 Tbsp lemon juice from a plastic lemon and I also skipped the butter entirely. I marinated for about 30 minutes, just while the grill heated up. I also used thawed frozen shrimp. Perhaps my skimping on freshness really ruined it, but if you don't have fresh ingredients, it probably is worth waiting til you get them because it is certainly edible, but rather disappointing.

Made this last night, substituting a tablespoon of minced garlic from a jar instead of the cloves. Substituted Tony Chachere's for the white pepper. We definitely didn't taste too much mustard -- we tasted too much basil. It was almost a pesto shrimp flavor. will try it again and alter the quantities.

This was great! I prepared this for my mom and me last week, but i made a couple of changes. Used 3 TB olive oil, omitted the butter, added more garlic, a splash of white wine and just 1 TB of mustard. Also added swordfish and calamari along with the shrimp. The swordfish had a funny taste, not sure what happened, but the calamari and shrimp were extremely flavorful and delicious.

I also marinated chicken in the sauce.  very good, but next time I will take the shrimp shell off.  I wanted to try it this way thinking the sauce would get in between the shell and shrimp and have a stronger taste.  But i think the sauce is to thick for that, so for now on i will take the shells off

I really enojyed this recipe! Next time I make it I will marinade it a little longer. I could taste the flavor, but only a little. While I love the flavor of shrimp, I would have loved it if I could taste the marinade more. Once I skewered the shrimp I rubbed the leftover marinade on the skewers, I didn't have the heart to toss all that wonderful marinade. Will make this one again!

This was AWESOME!! I had to change a few things...I didn't have any lemon juice on hand, so I used white wine vinegar; also I used dried basil. I made parmesan couscous with this and a side a peas. My family was fighting over seconds!! Make this recipe, it's SUPERB!

Absolutely delicious! I used all olive oil instead of butter after reading other reviews and dijon mustard since that was all I had. Even after hubby overcooked them slightly on the grill, they were still amazing! I managed to sneak a few into the fridge for tomorrow's lunch....shhhh.  :)

My husband perfectly marinated and grilled the shrimp. It was an excellent meal served on a salad bed of romaine, sliced red grapes, avacados, chopped green onion and sweet red peppers. Drizzled with a grape seed oil and orange muscat champagne vinegar dressing.

After reading the other reviews, I cut the mustard in half. (I also used spicy brown mustard) The basil just popped and it was delicious.

unbelievable! this one's a definite keeper...the flavor is crazy! maybe it's because i've never cooked with fresh basil before, it has such an amazing savory taste with a hint of tang from the lemon juice...thankyou!

Really good. I didn't have the brown mustard, so used regular yellow. I bought the shrimp on skewers already to go. I also mixed it in the magic bullet. I had alot left over so I dipped petrale sole fillets into the mix, and then in seasoned panko breadcrumbs and cooked on the grill. Yum, that was good. I still had more of the mix left so I covered  broccolini with it and threw the bread crumbs on top, and cooked it in the microwave. What a simple and tasty dinner. Thanks for the recipe

Delicious!  I also used it to marinade tilapia and it was very good.  It's hard to beat seafood on the grill.  Just don't overcook.

Didn't have lemons, so I didn't use lime juice, and it was still very good.  I marinated the shrimp for 1/2 hour, then heated it up over med-low heat with an extra tbs of butter to create a little more liquid, and served it with corkscrew whole wheat pasta.  Loved it, will make it just like this again soon.

Not a bad appetizer! I see what people say about being a little salty (definitely next time..No extra salt!) I changed the ingredients a little: Used "I cannot believe it's not butter-spray" and I didn’t have any problems after they got cold. I used Dijon mustard and the flavor was great! I used already cooked shrimp (as I had those in my freezer!). Perhaps this is why I didn’t get the “grill-looking” appearance on the kabobs. Next time I’ll use raw shrimp. This is a keeper!

These are simple to make with easy ingredients and they tasted incredible!  I let them marinate for a little longer than suggested and then grilled them in my grill pan and they turned out perfectly! I used a mild dijon instead of brown mustard with great results.  A great appetizer before a BBQ as they cook up so fast.  Will be making these again for sure.

Totally great- wonderful summer dish serve with tomato/fresh mozz salad and and some super crusty rolls and white wine. YUM.  Or over angel hair pasta dressed with high quality olive oil, fresh parm and S&P keep the rolls and wine!  This shrimp was the hands down favorite dish at our large three day family reunion filled with good food.

A wonderful summer grilling recipe!  Sort of a scampi preparation here for grilling.  I just eyed the ingredients and used the mustard I had on hand, a beer mustard.  A great use for all of that fresh basil in the garden.  Sincere thanks for sharing this simple and delicious recipe.

Wow! This recipe does rock! I cut the amount of butter by half and it was still very dreamy. I ran out of time to grill so I sauteed them in a hot skillet. When nearly done I drizzled in the marinate and added a splash of white wine. My husband, our three year old and I all loved them!

Amazing.  I wouldn't change a thing.  We grilled these as kabobs with onions and bell peppers.  As I turned them on the grill, I brushed on the remaining marinade because it was just too good to waste.

My husband hates mustard, so I didn't tell him that it was in the recipe until after he said that he LOVED it. He wants me to make them for our baby's baptism party. I altered the recipe a bit because I didn't have any fresh ingredients: a  squirt of lemon juice, and a dash of  garlic powder and dried basil. They were delicious!

Very good!  This recipe also works well with Salmon.  I used the leftover marinade and basted several salmon fillets with it for a cookout I was having.  Everyone raved about it.  Wonderful!

This recipe was excellent. I prepared in advance for a dinner party and it was perfect. I marinated the shrimp in the sauce overnight and it turned out excellent. I have been using All Recipes for 2 years now and JUST registered as a member to put a review in for this recipe -- that's how great it was! Didn't change a thing in the recipe.

Excellent recipe....I added some crushed red pepper for Zip and omitted the butter (added a bit more olive oil).
What a hit!!!! Thanks!

Yummmm. I don't like cooking, in particular, and this is fun, fast, and easy. The flavors meld soooo well if you marinate it for a few hours. I made this in a Tupperware in the am, and by 4pm, they were ready to grill. Served with some thick spaghetti and crusty french bread. Soooo good.

This is a great recipe.  I halved the whole recipe and sauted the shrimp and marinade together and completed it by adding some fettucine noodles to it.  My husband loved it.  Served it with some warm french bread and it was a meal.  I will try it on the grill next.

So yummy! We decided to treat ourselves and have some shrimp and asparagus for dinner. Felt like I was dining at a 4 star restaurant! Only thing I did different (because its all I had)was sub lime for lemon juice. Excellent!!

I made this one evening; it is similar to Cajun Bar-B-Que shrimp.  In my mind the basil didn't really add anything.  I think I like Cajun BBQ shrimp better; just use a lot of Black pepper, Old Bay, and butter, sans the lemon and basil.  Cajun BBQ is the sort of shrimp you need a lot of crusty French bread for dipping into the sauce.  Not a calorie conscious meal.

This was amazing! It's better than most grilled shrimp I've had at nice restaurants. Thank you, thank you for this!

I got lazy and did it on my George Foreman instead of on the Weber. On the GF, I did it for four minutes at 300 degrees (I have the kind where you can set the temp separately for both sides) and it was perfect. I took some of the leftover marinade and hottened it in the microwave, and brushed it on the shrimp just before serving.

This recipe is on my short list. Excellent! Yum!

This is one of those recipes that doesn't seem very impressive when you scan the ingredients, but somehow morphs into something completely and utterly fabulous right before your eyes.  AMAZING. I cooked mine on the stove and sauteed it and it was still fabulous.  Amazing how the mustard morphs into something else entirely!  I did happen to have fresh lemon basil in the garden, but you can buy fresh basil now. You should definitely try this if you love shrimp... sooooooooooo yummy!

I cut back slightly on the mustard but otherwise followed the recipe as listed.  I have made these twice on the grill, once on skewers and the other time on a tin foil tray.  We enjoyed the few we got to sample, as my son inhalled them both times!

This recipie had a lot of potential. The marinade smelled amazing with all the basil, butter, and garlic. However, it didn't stick to the shrimp! I left it to marinade overnight and it still didn't seem that flavorful. Otherwise it was okay. Will probably try again.

Quick, simple, and tasty. My one complaint is that I did them on a George Foreman instead of a grill and I much prefer a grill. But the taste was great. I made these with a big salad and some dinner rolls and it was light and refreshing.

This was just fabulous, and very quick! I marinated jumbo shrimp overnight, and then used the leftover marinade, diluted with a bit of water, to grill some vegetables with. I broiled them in the oven and it literally took 4 minutes to cook. Literally. Was a huge hit with the boyfriend, too.

This recipe was sooooo good.  I acutally increased this to 45 servings and made this for the "special" at our church fish fry during lent. I made extra marinade and put it in the steam tray to baste with before serving. Served with rice pilaf and roasted peppers, zuchinni, yellow squash and asparagus. YUM!

Really nice. Added just a 1/2 tsp of sugar to the full recipe and kept some of the mixture to the side before marinating to spoon over the shrimp while they cooked. Only 4 stars because without the sugar it was just too tart with the lemon and mustard. It's a 5 star recipe with the sugar (if I do say so myself! ;) ).

Excellent on the grill.  I made it for my wife and daughter and we all enjoyed the shrimp.  The butter adds good flavoring to the marinade.

I made this shrimp recipe for my 4th of July BBQ.  I made them on skewers mixed with veggies.  They were a big hit.  VERY YUMMY!!! I will be making them again.

Absolutely the best!  I do cut down on mustard some.  We've cooked this for guests a couple of times and they cannot get over the great taste.

It tasted too "flour-ery".  It maybe will taste better if the prawns were bigger.  Size 10+  My family didn't care for the dish.

This was good but the family was asking for some sauce to put on it.  I used dry course ground mustard, maybe it would have been better with the mustard from the refrigerator jar.  I used the leftover shrimp for shrimp linguine alredo from this site and it was really good and everyone liked it.  I think I will stick with the grilled shrimp scampi next time.

Absolutely the best!  I have never had a 
recipe that had so many requests to pass 
along.  It's the greatest!  It is my new
all-time favorite.  I feel like a 
gourmet cook when I prepare this dish.
Thank you, thank you to the person who
created this masterpiece.

Although I really liked it, this recipe
didn't go over with my family-and we
all love shrimp! Guess we'll stick to
teriyaki shrimp on the grill.

The dish is flavorful, easy to prepare, tasty and simply delicious.  Serve with rice and a side salad.

Really nice flavor, but you can hardly go wrong when using Red Argentine! I substituted basil pesto for the olive oil and fresh basil but use everything else as called. I marinated the shrimp with shells on for about thirty minutes and added lemon juice for about the last ten minutes.  Put some chopped zucchinni, mushrooms and colored pepper between the shrimps on the skewers and it was a pretty presentation! Thank you for sharing!

Next time I am going to double the recipe so there is enough to go around!  It was just all gone.  This was absolutely delicious!  I broiled them bc I didn't have time for the grill.  I know they will be better cooked on the grill.  I will do it next time.  Served with a garlic and white wine pasta.  Yum!

Excellent. As suggested I cut the mustard to 2 tablespoons and I might have used a bit more than 3 cloves garlic. I also added a dash of ground cayenne pepper. My marinade time was about 20 minutes.

Since I only needed to feed my husband and myself, I halved the recipe. I halved the recipe amounts except I used a small whole lemon. I also used fresh basil. This dish was scrumptious. I will certainly be making this again.

Great recipe.  I used the three pounds of shrimp.  I followed other people recommendations to use less mustard.  I marinated the shrimps for 15 minutes.  And one modification that I did was to add red bell pepper and onion to the skewers.  I put a square of red bell pepper and couple of squares of onion and a shrimp, I repeat this process until I have about four shrimps on a skewer with the red bell pepper and onion between the shrimps.  My family loved it, I got so many compliments for the shrimp kabobs.

This was great!  It was too cold to grill so I sauteed the shrimp with the marinade in a pan and served with rice.  So easy to make and delicious.  Definitely adding this to the rotation.

Excellent!  I used frozen shrimp with the plan to let the shrimp thaw in the fridge in the marinade for a few hours. The oil and butter in the marinade solidified with the frozen shrimp while thawing in the fridge.  I had to let the shrimp marinate/thaw on the counter in order to keep the butter/oil from solidifying.  Still tasted amazing!  Will definitely make this again.

All things equal, I think it was just OK... the  flavor was quite muted and didn't really bring out the best in shrimp.  I wouldn't tell you to not try it... but for me, I'd try something else

Excellent! I cut back on the mustard, marinated the shrimp for about one hour, grilled the shrimp then tossed them with grilled veggies, penne pasta and sprinkled it with parmesan cheese.  This is a do-over!

Great marinade.  Loved the mustard affect though I only used 1 tablespoon due to picker eaters.  Sauteed on the stove rather than cooked on the grill.  Delicious.

Meh. I took the advice of so many of the earlier reviewers and cut down on the mustard, increased the garlic and almost doubled the basil. It still lacked for flavor. Not awful, but not worth a repeat.

Instead of using the grill, I put the marinade in a skillet to cook with the shrimp.  Used it as a marinade, so I thickened it with cornstarch and served over rice.  It was a HIT!  The only problem is there weren't any left overs :)

I actually only used a couple tbsp of the butter and a Carolina BBQ sauce instead of mustard and sauteed it.  It was great.  cooked the sauce with Basil for a couple of mins and then added the shrimp.

My Girlfriend and I made this dish and followed the ingredients to spec. However, we cooked it on the stove top and added flour to thicken it up some. Then used as a topper over brown rice. EXCELLENT!!!

I cut back on the mustard and the lemon juice, as per other reviews, and it was good - but not outstanding.  My 13 year old wouldn't eat it, as she does not like mustard at all.  I didn't think she'd taste it as I did put in less... but apparently not enough less!  I baked in a 350 deg. oven for less about 12 minutes, and served over angel hair pasta.  Probably won't do this again, though the sauce was interesting.

I agree with the other postings.  Reduce the mustard.  The basil added a nice touch, but not to die for...

Went 50/50 on oil & butter and cut mustard back a bit. Marinated for about 30-40 minutes and cooked shrimp on stovetop in skillet with marinade. Removed shrimp when done and reduced sauce a bit. Served over rice. Good stuff!!

It was ok but a little too much work for the final result; most of the marinade falls on the grill.

Really enjoyed this. The sauce was amazing. Sauce would be good on fish as well. I didn't skewer the shrimps as only a few were of the size. Cooked it on top of the stove. Used regular mustard instead of Dijon and reduced lemon juice to only a teaspoon. Marinated for 30 minutes.

Wonderful! Only marinated it for about 20 minutes and used my mom's homemade sweet/spicy mustard instead of Grey Poupon, but it was absolutely fabulous!!

Didn't have dijon mustard so used a little honey mustard and about 3/4 tsp of dried mustard.  I didn't marinate in the refrigerator, so the butter did not harden.  Then brushed the marinade over the shrimp as  they were grilling.  Nice and moist shrimp.

Note:  This is a review of the original recipe, but I did something different with the finished dish that some may like.
I did cut down the dijon mustard by half and grilled the marinated shrimp without skewers on a stove top grill.  But instead of discarding the leftover marinade:  Put it in a 10" saute pan and add 2 tbs butter, 2 tbs olive oil, (as much minced garlic as you like), and 1 1/2 cups medium chop roma tomatoes (without seeds).  Cook up 3-4 portions of spaghetti.  Heat sauce/tomatoes through, drain spaghetti and add to pan, then add grilled shrimp and mix it all together.  Serve w/grated romano, parm, etc. and garnish with whole, small basil leaves.  Yum.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great way to use my summer basil.  I cut the recipe down for 1 lb. of shrimp and I grilled them in a grill basket, since I did not want to use skewers. I served the shrimp along with some whole wheat pasta tossed with my homemade basil pesto.   Yum!

These were exceptional!  To the purists amongst us I apologize ahead of time because I did take other reviewers suggestions to cut back on the lemon and the Dijon mustard.  But I knew I would agree with those that said there too much of those flavors - I love strong lemon flavor in my baked goods but definitely not on my meat or seafood.  Since I was cooking for two and not nine I don't know if knowing my reductions would be helpful to others.but I used about a teaspoon of each.  Anyway, to continue......the first words out of my mate's mouth were "these are so good - like restaurant quality" and I had to agree.   He did a great job barbecuing them, too, as they were not the least bit overcooked.  We didn't skewer them - just cooked them in a pan designed for BBQing.  We will be making these again.....and soon!  Thank you's to Gail and her friend Elaine for sharing this great recipe!

I experimented since I had an abundance of fresh cilantro in my garden. Also used Dijon mustard and half lemon, half lime juice. Very delicious and feel this is a good base recipe for whatever fresh herbs you have handy.

I used dried basil instead of fresh, canola oil instead of olive oil, regular mustard instead of Dijon LOL! With Chinese salt, no lemon because I didn't have any.. Tossed in chia seeds before serving and used baby shrimp fully cooked . Garlic and onion . I also used 2 tsp of fenugreek powder! Omg! Amazing!! Also I literally threw all of this into a frying pan and cooked until it was really thick and tossed it with pasta, with a side of Asian veggies soy sauce and Chinese salt! It was perfect!

Delicious!! Quick, easy and tasty dinner. I prepared  the shrimp exactly as written. I did not use skewers but instead a grill vegetable skillet which worked perfectly.  Served it with parmigiana couscous, salad and grilled broccoli. Excellent healthy dinner!

Made this for my boyfriend's birthday. He REALLY liked it. I liked it too but felt the basil flavor was a bit much. If you love Basil,  you will really like it. Made a sauce with the marinade by stir frying some of it in butter.

I didn't marinate for the full hour. Also fried in a pan and didn't serve the cooked marinade with the meal. It was really a hit in my house. However, the flavor is very strong and may not suit everyone.

Sautee is the way to go on this one. I hate grilling so after scouring reviews, I found others who also sautéed this dish. I only added 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard and used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and added 1 tablespoon of red chili paste for a kick, while still marinating it in the fridge for a little over an hour. Ended with 1/4 cup of white wine and some cornstarch to finish and it was a true winner.

I followed the directions and cooked it on the stove rather than the grill. Made it one pound of shrimp so that there was more sauce. I also subbed the fresh basil with dry, fresh lemons with lemon juice concentrate and placed the dish on top of pasta. Loved it!!!! Will make this again!

This shrimp was good, but it seemed very ordinary. I had expected more flavor. We won't make it again.

Absolutely loved it. Live in an apartment where I have no grill so I sauteed them and added rice flour to thicken the sauce. Can't wait to try this next week at someone's who does have a grill. Too bad she's alergic to mustard. More for us!

Delicious!  Wonderful marinade, but next time I think I'll reduce the amount of melted butter in it; just didn't find the full amount was necessary.  I increased garlic and frankly, as other reviewers suggested, an hour is far too long to marinate the shrimp.  20 minutes max.  Be careful not to overcook.  Depending upon the size of the shrimp, it may take just a minute a side, etc.  Will make this again for certain.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was very good.  I liked the flavor. I did read some of the alterations and followed them.  I added lemon zest,increased the lemons to 2 full lemons- juiced, decreased the dijon mustard by 1 TBL and only marinated for approx 20 minutes.  One thing which I think saved it from being to lemony was the amt of olive oil did not show when I printed the recipe so I did 1/4 cup of butter AND 1/4 cup of olive oil.  It came out very good as I stated and I used fresh basil as I have a little herb garden. 

Also because I did not use the grill, I pan seared it and poured out the excess liquid.

Nice mild flavor and easy.  Followed the reviews and reduced the amount of mustard and substituted dried basil for fresh.  I'm sure it would be even better w/ fresh basil.

I don't have easy access to a grill, so I had to cook this on the stove top. I really enjoyed the flavor, but next time I will definitely cut back on the mustard, if not omit it entirely. I loved the lemon, basil, and garlic though. It was delicious!

I enjoyed making this recipe but in the end I feel like there was definitely too much Dijon mustard. I would suggest reducing Dijon mustard to 1-1/2 tbps or 2 tbps. Fun to make and pretty good beside the strong smell of mustard!

Four family members gave me two thumbs up and one said that these were the best shrimp she has ever eaten.  I had to adjust the dijon to two tbls. because I had the the warehouse shrimp that comes in frozen two pound bags not the three that the recipe calls for.

Butter in a marinade just didn't work for me.  Solidified when refrigerated and basil just didn't adhere.  May have worked better with just olive oil.  Won't make again.

LOVED IT!  It's cold here, so I didn't want to go outside to grill.  So I sauteed in a skillet, sauce and all.  Scooped the shrimp out and kept warm.  Added fresh green beans, portabello mushrooms and red pepper strips to the pan, sauteed those with a splash of dry white wine, then added the shrimp and some cooked ravioli back to the pan.  Lovely meal!  Will definitely cook this again.  Can't wait for summer to throw it on the grill!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I skipped the white pepper and used dried basil. I didn't let the shrimp sit in the marinade because we the family was hungry, which is probably why the mustard wasn't overpowering. As soon as I coated the shrimp I cooked it in the frying pan. My husband hates mustard but thought this dish was delicious. I waited until he was done eating to tell him the "secret" ingredient so he wouldn't change his mind about liking it.

We loved this. I loved using the fresh basil out of the garden and loved that it was so quick and easy. We followed the recipe but didn't have any skewers so just used a grill basket and it was awesome.

Had this last night but with one pound of shrimp. I used half of everything but I only used one Tbsp of the mustard and 3 tsp of dried basil since I didn't have fresh. Marinated for half hour. These were excellent!!

Every time I get shrimp my husband asks me to make this recipe. Instead of using the grill I always make these in a pan. It saves a lot of the sauce, which my husband always allows spill over onto his brown rice to add more flavor. I have tried it reducing the Dijon mustard, but I find it adds a lot of flavor.

I made this tonight for my son & daughter-in-law, and it was a big hit! I went light on the mustard & heavy on the basil and garlic, and I used all olive oil with no butter. Marinated jumbo shrimp for 2 hours. I think the only thing I would do next time is to cook up the leftover marinade to put on top of the shrimp. But it was very good!! Easy and would definitely do again!

Hubs and I polished off a pound of shrimp but I honestly think it just tasted like grilled shrimp.  I couldn't detect the marinade at all.  I cut the recipe in 1/3 but made as directed with no changes.  I like other grilled shrimp recipes that I've tried better.

This marinade adds nice flavor without overpowering the shrimp.  I used dried basil and it worked out fine. We thought it was excellent.

Good - though lighter on flavor than we expected, particularly after reviews of "too lemony" or "too much mustard."  Made marinade to recipe (substituting honey dijon mustard).  Used only one lb. of shrimp (instead of three lbs.), as we like extra sauce.  Marinated 30 minutes in fridge, and then sauteed shrimp in marinade, adding flour at the end to thicken the sauce.  It was a nice balance of sauce to shrimp, particularly if you were serving over pasta.  We simply like a zestier, spicier, more intensely flavored shrimp, so contrary to most reviewers, I think I would add more mustard next time around, and perhaps use standard dijon as noted in recipe, instead of honey dijon as others suggested.  It was definitely good (and a safe bet if serving to a variety of palates), though not outstanding.

Followed recipe exactly, except I missed the melted butter part. (Cooking 3 dishes at 1 time) I thought it was outstanding. I will put this 1 in my regular rotation. This is a must try.

My 7 year old grandoughter said the shrimps taste was "Amazing".  They all  like and found simple to do and deliciious.. I did them exactly as the recipe said, marinated for 1 hour may a little more, put in the sticks and cook them in the grill for 3-4 minutes.

This was delicious! I made a half recipe since it was just for 2 people. I was in a hurry & wanted to use what I have on hand, so I made some substitutions: 3 Tbs reconstituted lemon juice (the stuff in the little lemon-shaped squeeze bottle), garlic powder to taste, black pepper, frozen shrimp, and coated the mixture in dried basil. Marinated for 10 mins, then seared it stove-top in a pan on high heat for about 15 seconds to heat it through. Filled my house with smoke, though, so I would turn the heat down next time! (My fault - so the recipe still gets 5 stars.)

Wonderful!  I have never had much luck with grilling shrimp, but this recipe was delightful and very easy to pull together.

I reduced the mustard to 1 tablespoon and marinated the shrimp for 30 min as suggested by other reviewers.  The fresh basil adds a delicious flavor - use fresh if at all possible.

I purchased shrimp that was already on skewers and marinated it in a large dish - the flavor was equally as good and it made the process a bit simpler.

If you enjoy shrimp, this is a must try!

This was excellent! I reduced the mustard to taste, and didn't have basil, so I used cilantro. Obviously a different taste than the basil would have been, but it worked well and tasted delicious. I made a little extra marinade (kept far away from the raw shrimp) and used it to pour over some basmati rice to eat with the shrimp.

The shrimp turned out like a high end restaurant.  Exactly what we needed because we where having a House purchase/birthday party for our friends. I wanted something new besides burgers or steaks.  I used dried basil, and store brand spicy brown mustard, otherwise everything else is the same.  I used the same quantities for 4 lbs of shrimp.  Oiled the BBQ with veg oil.  Man that took a long time to skew.  Oh well, well worth it.

This was a wonderful marinade for shrimp. There was nothing that screamed, "5 stars!" but it is still worth adding to the colection and making again. I really liked the fresh basil and lemon which complimented the salty shrimp flavors.

Used less mustard, as per many reviewers' recommendations. My family enjoyed it, but it was not the best ever. Perhaps a touch of sweetness would have balanced the flavours more. Thanks!

I loved this recipe! Like a few other members, I left out the mustard and reduced the marinating time. The marinade had a wonderful light texture to it! Once the shrimp were cooking I boiled the marinade (that whole nasty raw shrimp thing!) and drizzled some on the cooke dshrimp. The rest I saved with the extra shrimp and made a yummy green sald which I tossed with the shrimp and the marinade. A wonderful summer dish which is sure to be a staple in our house!

Fantastic!  This had so much flavor.  I added extra lemon juice and fresh basil, everyone loved it.  It came out a bit too salty for my tastes but that is not the recipe's fault since it says "salt to taste," I simply put too much in!

This was a perfect blend of ingredients.  I made it exactly as written and cooked it on the grill.  It was the easiest and tastiest recipe ever for shrimp.  I have made it several times and each time it's just as good.  If you are short on time and still want to cook a fabulous meal just add a salad and a baked potato and viola !!!!!

Here on the Gulf Coast of Florida, we are always looking for new creative ways to prepare our seafood.  And this takes the prize! Any time we get together with our friends, they ask for it by name! YUM!  Just be sure not to marinade too long...the acids in lemon juice actually cook your shrimp...and then they will be tough after coming off the grill...  Just a half hour is plenty!

the fresh basil with the lemon and the shrimp, mixed with the taste from the grill was absolutely perfect! 
Definitely will be making again (and again and again)!

I used the george foreman grill for this, and the shrimps turned out well. The marinate definitely had a great flavor, but it wasn't a wow.

I've made this recipe several times now and each time has turned out AWESOME!!  First few times I followed the recipe to the tee, then started improvising with a variety of substitutions - have used juice from fresh limes instead of lemons, have both decreased and omitted mustard, have used dijon instead of brown mustard,have broiled in oven, grilled on the BBQ, etc - this is a fun recipe to play around with depending on your tastes.  ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS a hit with family, at parties, wherever.  Thanks for a wonderful way to use my basil and for a fun & tasty shrimp recipe!!

The flavors in this recipe were wonderful!  The butter through me for loop a little since it solidifies in the refrig and when you take it out it just doesn't look ready for the grill.  However, I think it added a nice buttery flavor and created a true "sauce" that stuck a little to the shrimp.

Everyone enjoyed this shrimp.  I prepared it just as indicated but did not put on skewers and cook on the BBQ.   I cooked for a few minutes in a non stick frying pan.   The flavour was excellent.

Absolutely fantastic!  We'll definitely make this again.  I used all olive oil and only marinaded for 25 minutes.  I almost decreased the amount of mustard based on some of the reviews, but opted to go with the suggested amount of 1 T and was really glad I did.  I was looking for a way to use some of the basil in my garden and this fit the bill.  Thanks a bunch for posting!

Oh my!  SOOO good...  And super easy.  I didn't even let it marinade for the full hour, only about 20-30 minutes by the time they were on the grill.  I offered one to my friend, he couldn't stop!

My wife and I just finished our 4th of July barbecue supper, and this is the recipe we made.  Per one of the other reviews we cut the mustard amount in half, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  I picked fresh basil from the garden for the marinade, and this is the BEST shrimp we've ever tasted.  It's absolutely excellent, couldn't be improved upon, and we recommend it!

Love the combination of flavors in this dish.  It's quick and easy too, can't beat that.  I used fresh basil from my garden and omitted the salt since the other ingredients are salty enough. Thanks for sharing.

You will enjoy!  My family raved and raved, even my father-in-law ;) I agree with other postings that marinating for too long will dry out the shrimp. The last time I made it ahead of time but waited to add the lemon juice until later(right around the time I started soaking the wood skewers for the grill) that seemed to help.

I used this for some frozen Mahi Mahi I had in the freezer. It was really good with fish too. I would go with the other suggestions and scale back on the mustard. I like a mustard tang but the amount here is too over-powering. I will use this one again though.

I don't know what I did...not what I had hoped for. Flavor was lacking. I imagine the taste would have been better simmered in a pan, that is what I will try next time.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I really didn't like the smell of the marinade,and didn't think I would like the finished product. I'm glad I saw it through, though, because the end result was really good. I couldn't find brown mustard, so I used a grey dijon. I also used sea salt. I fried instead of grilled. I would make this again.

My family loves this recipe. We have several grilled shrimp recipes we enjoy but this one is at the top of our list. Other than the fact that I marinate the shrimp for about four hours, I follow the recipe exactly.

I tried this marinade for the first grill of the season. I agree with another reviewer who stated that they could taste only the mustard. Rather than the basil being the main feature, it was definitely the mustard. I was disappointed, though I may try again without the mustard.

Made it this evening & it was yummy! I did use a dipping sauce (saucy susan) for added flavor (I'm a dipper :-).  My 5 year old (who hates everything) even liked it...amazing.  I may try it on the stove over pasta next time, as another member suggested, for a different twist.  This one is a keeper!

This was quite yummy. I did alter the recipe per others suggestions. I also cooked mine on the stove in the marinade. I served it over angel hair pasta with fresh french bread.

Great shrimp recipe. Make sure to use raw shrimp. I used precooked shrimp, and it turned out rubbery- but the flavor was still great. My husband swore He would not like any recipe better than our old grilled shrimp- (made w/cajun spices) He admitted he was wrong after tasting this.

This recipe did make for a nice flavor but the shrimp ended up somewhat dry. I wonder if perhaps using the marinade to baste would help make them moist.

I didn't have brown mustard, so I used regular yellow mustard.  I forgot to get the lemon so I had to use limes.  It still turned out great but can't wait until try it again with all the ingredients listed!  Thanks Gail for an awesome recipe!!! :)

This is an outstanding recipe. I agree with other reviewers that fresh basil is the way to go, and I used dijon mustard for the brown which gave a tangy flavour. Served with rice and a summer salad - this is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe Gail.

Unbeatable! I used yellow mustard since that is what I like and had on hand. This was so easy and fast and you end up with such a great meal. I served this with white rice, steamed broccoli and fresh pinnapple. What a great dinner!!!!

This is a great recipe, I imagine it would taste even better on the grill.  We cooked ours on the Foreman grill because it was 22 degrees outside.  We will definitely try it again come summer grilling time.

This recipe is perfect. It was a lot of hard work, thus my recommedation is to buy the shrimp that are peeled already and deveined.  Other than that the shrimp were eaten is a flash. I've made them time and time again.
Thanks

These were delicious and one of the best things I served at my dinner party. I served them as appetizers and my guests were eating so much shrimp, I was a little worried no one would be hungry for the main course. I loved them, myself, and I don't even like shrimp much! I will definitely do these again!

This is a keeper. I used lime juice instead of lemon as that's what I had. Added a couple dashes of Tabasco, too, to give it a little more zing. Not a shrimp was left.

I followed the recipe exactly but my family felt these were too mustardy tasting. They are not fans of any type of mustard except honey mustard...so I do not think I will make them again or else I will alter the recipe.

I marinaded the shrimp for about 24 hours because I wanted lots of flavor. I was going to grill them as stated in the recipe, but it was so hot today, I couldn't face it. Instead, I did them on the Foreman, and they came out great! Husband loved them. Thanks so much, Gail!

I am NOT a shrimp eater, but I made these with several other bbq skewer recipes for our bbq.  Our guests ALL loved these. But for those of us who aren't used to handling raw shrimp, it's a bit disconserting to skewer them, especially when they are coated with coagulated butter and oil. My husband ended up rescuing me from this duty, but it was worth the jokes he made at my expense because everyone raved over this recipe.

This was delicious.  I'm not usually a fan of barbecued shrimp because they dry out, but these were delicious.  Great flavor.  I made them a second time indoors, in a saute pan on the stovetop.  Delicious that way too.  I will make these again.  I did use more olive oil, less butter, but that's the only change.

I served this as an appetizer for a grilled prime rib.  We loved the intense flavor of the shrimp.  Instead of dealing with the hassel of skewers, I used a fine mesh grilling basket.  Watch peeled shrimp carefully on the grill, as they can dry out very quickly.

My boyfriend and I loved this one!  It was sooo easy and so tasty.  I unfortunately ran out of brown mustard so I substituted it with brown mustard w/horseradish and it was superb.  I made grilled asparagus and garlic bread bruschetta with lots of basil for us carb lovers to accompany the meal.  A+!

This is a great recipe that doesn't require much time.  I used black pepper instead of white pepper as I don't stock it in the house.  This was a crowd pleaser.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I ran out of propane so had to do this on a George Foreman.  I much rather having the grill for the nice charred flavor.  This was excellent on top of my ceasar salad.

Truly outstanding! Very flavorful (even with only a couple hours to marinate). Actually, I think an overnight would be overpowering.  I used cayenne pepper since I don't have any white - the cayenne added a nice & subtle zip.

great recipe for grilling shrimp!  I served this with fettucini in a very simple garlic/olive oil sauce, along with salad and garlic bread.  My boyfriend told me to keep the recipe, so I will be making it again for sure.

I love shrimp and this lemony, tangy recipe made the most out of it!  Using fresh basil is a must; I don't think dried would do much for the recipe.  Very easy to make and delicious!

Excellent recipe and very easy.  The butter/oil combination does lend a very rich taste to the shrimp, and it tastes so delicious when fgrilled on the barbecue.  I did allow it to cook a bit longer than four minutes to ensure it was completely cooked, and I turned the skewers often - enjoy!

This was easy and fun to make.  It has a delightful blend of flavors.  I think that it works well on its own, as a side dish and as an appetizer.

Fantastic, made these for my father inlaws 80th bday party and they were well received by all. You had to fast to grab one. I increased the quantity to suit but didn't change anything else. Will definatley be making again.

This was good...I almost think, though, that it would have tasted about the same if I didn't even have any marinade.  The bites that had pieces of basil on them were tasty, but the rest just tasted like plain shrimp.  My husband loved them, though, so I'm sure I'll make again with no changes.  Didn't taste bad, but wasn't spectacular to me.

The best shrimp recipe I have ever tasted.  When I order in restaurants I am disappointed compared to the taste of these.  There are wonderful.  Sometimes I add my butter because we love that buttery taste.  I have also used them as an appetizer at parties.  Believe me--they do not last long!!

My husband loved these!  I tried this in the oven and they still turned out great!  Next time I'm going to bake the shrimp in the sauce in a casserole dish and see how it turns out!

This was a very easy and good recipe. I did think the lemon was a little strong so I will probably cut back on that next time but overall we enjoyed this recipe quite a bit and will definitely have again.

I cook this on the BBQ in a grilling basket, this is much easier than putting on the skewers. Works great.  Also, I have cooked it on the stove in a sautee pan.

I can't say enouugh about this recipe! Both my husband and I loved it, and I can't wait to make it again. Next time I am going to make extra marinade, hold some to the side and toss it it in some pasta and top it off with the prepared shrimp. This was great, thanks so much!

This recipe was pretty good.  It was easy to make but I think prawns would taste much better than regular shrimp.  My family liked it but didn't "Love" it.
