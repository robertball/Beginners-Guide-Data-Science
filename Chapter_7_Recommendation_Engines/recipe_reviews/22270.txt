This is a great sauce, I did add my little changes though, I started by roasting my roma tomatoes and my fresh bulb of garlic with a drizzle of evoo. While that was going I started browning my ground beef and sweet italian sausage
with my chopped onion and basil, italian seasoning, red peppers and seasoning salt. Then I cooked my fresh mushrooms in white wine until wine reduced by two teaspoons. When my tomatoes and garlic were ready, I put them in electric chopper with a little wine, basil, oregano, italian seasoning , tomatoe paste, and water.
Then I added the tomatoe mixture to my meat that I had drained of fat. I added my mushrooms and fresh parsley and parm cheese. I let it simmer for 1 1/2 hrs stirring every 15min or so. Then I poured over my pasta Top my dish with a little jack and parma cheese and fresh black pepper and garlic seasoning blend. Made garlic cheese bread
Then we threw down eating this one up!!!!!.

This is a perfect recipe to use to get a general idea on how to make a spaghetti sauce.  I used all the ingredients but measured according to my own taste which made it great!  ADD sugar and salt. USE fresh garlic over garlic powder.

Use 1/2 T. of each herb if you don't add ground beef.  If you do add meat to the sauce use 1 T. otherwise the meat will overpower the sauce and it will be bland.  I also added 1/2 red bell pepper chopped in food processor (gives it a sweetness so you don't need sugar) and 1/4 tsp. cayenne.  I went with 1 head of garlic cloves instead of garlic powder.  To me, this tasted like high end jarred sauce which is what my 3 young kids like, something simple (and I don't like Prego or Ragu).  This is a recipe we'll add to our recipe book.  Thanks!

This, too, was my first time attempting spaghetti sauce without the jar.  It was so quick, easy and tasty!  I did take another reviewer's suggestion and doubled the tomato paste.  I like a thicker sauce, more like Prego.  I'm sure with just the 6 oz of paste it would give you more of a Ragu-like sauce.  Very good!

Made this for a Church Group for a competition.  Won first place.  I substituted 1/2 pound of Shrimp and 1/2 pound of scallops for the beef.  I sauteed the shrimp with the shells on in some olive oil to infuse the shrimp flavor, then took out to cool (later peeled the shrimp and put back into the sauce at the very end) and added the main ingredients to the leftover shrimp/oil to cook.  Used fresh herbs and chopped garlic rather than the dry stuff.

I'm giving this 3 stars.  It was good, but I think the dried herbs were a little overpowering.  If I made this again, I would probably reduce the herbs, especially the oregano, and add a couple tablespoons of sugar to mellow out the sauce.  I also thought this was a little too meaty.  I like meat sauce as much as the next gal, but this was just a little too much meat for the amount of sauce.  I would cut the meat down to 1/2 lb.  Overall, a decent sauce, but I think I will keep looking for something a little tastier.

Outstanding recipe. I made some minor adjustments like adding fresh garlic and sweet sausage with the hamburger and I like thicker sauce so I added an additional can of paste. If you play with it and make minor changes you will find a great sauce to meet your needs. Thanks for a great recipe.

Easy, tasty sauce.  You can mess around with the spices to your liking, but this is a good basic recipe.  I left out the mushrooms (hate 'em!),and it turned out just fine.

As the daughter of a 100% Italian father, I am ashamed to admit that I have never been able to make spaghetti sauce from scratch.  Thanks to you, Angie, that has now changed!  I doubled the recipe except for the meat and used ground turkey instead of beef.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes on hand, so I used petite diced tomatoes instead.  I also used fresh crimini mushrooms, which I sauteed until they were soft, instead of the canned mushrooms.  I added about 1 Tbs of salt for flavor (remember, I doubled the recipe) and about 1 tsp of white sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  The result was perfection!  I'm only giving this four stars because it really did need the addition of the salt and sugar.

I really enjoyed this sauce. I added an additional two minced cloves of garlic and a bit of sugar at the end, then topped if off with parmesan cheese. Mmmmmm. My picky husband however, not knowing I had made this from scratch, took a few bites and told me not to buy this brand of spaghetti sauce anymore. The only thing he disliked was that it was very thick, there was hardly any liquid to it. I will make this again but I may follow some other reviewers suggestion and add a second can of tomato paste with some water.

I had run out of my favorite Prego Garden Combination spaghetti sauce, so searched here for a home-made sauce. I didn't need the meat in it since I had pre-made Italian meatballs (from Costco). And WOW! Even without the meat it's an awesome recipe. Besides leaving out the meat, I followed other reviewers' ideas, and added 1/4 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp brown sugar, 1 thinly sliced carrot, and 1/2 cup chopped green pepper. Also, I substituted canned diced tomatoes for the stewed. Our whole family loved this sauce. My husband raved and raved about it, saying it was waaaaay better than our usual Prego, and has requested it from now on. Next time I'll try it with  Sweet Italian sausage in the sauce. 
What a fabulous recipe, and so easy! Thanks for sharing it!

My husband isn't Italian, but he always liked it when I made spaghetti with his mom's homemade sauce....until I lost her recipe. He pronounced this version very good. High praise indeed. It's by far the simplest recipe I've found that we like. The only thing I changed was to cut up the stewed tomatoes with kitchen shears...oh, and was out of dried basil so I used fresh from the garden. If you like your sauce meaty, as my hubby does, no other changes are recommended. I personally might add a bit more tomato paste. Thanks for submitting!

Perfect.  Alex loved it.  Must use stewed tomatoes, and it needs to simmer for at least 1.5 hours.  Used sweet Italian sausage

This is a great recipe, and easy to make changes to if you want- though it's not necessary.  I like to add some chopped pepperoni to the sauce if I have some on hand.  Wonderful!! I won't buy the canned stuff anymore!

This was very good. I started with the Recipe as indicated and added 1 tsp freah cracked pepper, 1 tbs fresh garlic and 1 tsp of sugar. I also added 1 ground up link of mild italian sausage. After cooking the sausage I squeezed it with a paper towel to get all of the excess grease out before adding it to the sauce. I then added one small can of tomato sauce. The added sauce made it more attractive to pour over pasta and the taste was great. It was too thick without it. I put in one whole carrot cut in 3 pieces and let it simmer for an hour. (Remove carrot before serving) I served it over mini penne and it was so yummy. I may never eat RAGU again :) Thank you to all who added such wonderful advice in your ratings.

Yummy and easy!!
Made a few changes though. Added veggies: chopped carrots, celery, fresh mushrooms and zucchini. Also threw in 3 cut italian sausages. Used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 2 bottles of crushed tomatoes (the italian ones, in glass bottles). A touch of grated nutmeg and simmered for 2 hours. Yummy, everyone loved the recipe, it was excellent. I made a lasagna with the leftover sauce.

I'm sure this would have been even better had I used the ground beef, but I was pressed for time and used what I had on hand.
I sauteed 1/4 cup of chopped onion, then added 4 cloves of minced garlic and cooked for another couple minutes.
While the onion cooked, I took 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato paste, the herbs (I did not use garlic powder) and 3-4 chopped mushrooms and threw them in a blender.  I added this sauce to the onions and garlic when they were tender and simmered for 15 min.  Everyone really liked it!

Pretty good recipe to start you out...I did use fresh basil and Oregano. My son learned in a culinary class that if you use fresh spices double what the recipe calls for and add them the last twenty min. of cooking for full flavor. 
I also used fresh garlic/mushrooms and cut one green bell pepper.

Using this recipe as a base I made what I thought was one of the tastiest spaghetti sauces I ever made.  In addition to the base add the following: sub ground italian sausage, sugar, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and crushed red peppers to taste......  
 .....MMMMMM......Especially Delicious!!!

I have used this recipe several times and just have not reviewed it.  I grew up in a family that always combined noodles and sauce even spaghetti so if you are looking for a sauce to cover pasta it maybe too meaty but if you are wanting to mix noodles and pasta before serving this is great!!!  I follow the recipe except i add sugar for taste.  Usually less than a 1/4 cup never over, but whatever your taste buds suggest.  I also cook the pasta by itself until al dente then finish the hour of cooking the sauce out by combing it with the noodles until the noodles are done.

I used this as my first recipe for making spaghetti sauce and it turned out really well.  I added finely chopped carrots and celery, a few bay leaves, and a pinch or two of sugar, and about a 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  My mom and finace were quite impressed!

I wasn't impressed with this sauce. It was thick, which I like, but I could've bought a can of sauce at the store and it would've tasted pretty much the same and I would've saved time. My husband and I ate it but I won't make it again.

This was my first time to make spaghetti sauce and this recipe was fantastic! I took the advice of others and added an extra can of tomato paste and a little bit of red pepper flakes to give it an extra kick. It was delicious! Thanks so much!

I loved this! This was my first time attempting a spaghetti sauce from scratch, and this one was great!  Only difference is I added 1/2 cup green bell pepper and my canned tomatoes were already flavored with oregano, garlic and basil.  Thanks!

I use this recipe as a base recipe.  I add three cans of diced tomatoes, two fire roasted.  I also add 2 T. sugar and a large squeeze (about 1T) of honey.  In addition to the spices, I add black pepper, sea salt and about 1 T of Hungarian paprika.  I omit the garlic powder for the garlic salt with parsley in it.  I also add one red bell pepper and one green bell pepper in addition to one large red onion.  My toddlers (and everyone else) LOVE this recipe!!!  Enjoy!

Good base sauce that you can adjust flavors as you like... sausage, or hamburger, or ground turkey, or mushrooms, or zucchini... the flavor combos are endless!

This was a pretty good recipe, but not fabulous, in my opinion. I made it exactly as written, using 93% ground beef. It came out fairly thick, which I like - watery spaghetti sauces are too common. It was nice, but it's hard to define what might make it a five-star recipe - maybe a little sugar in the mix, or a more robust mix of spices -  I did find the seasonings not all that exciting, just average. But overall, I did enjoy it over cooked thin spaghetti.

This is a great recipe.  I added some green peppers.  Make sure to use garlic powder and not garlic salt...I didn't have reg. powder and used garlic salt and it was too salty so I added a bit of sugar.  It was still good.  I plan on using this recipe everytime I have spaghetti instead of store bought jars.

Very tasty.  I used homemade meatballs instead of ground beef and left out the mushrooms.  I also substituted half a bulb of garlic.  Easy and tasty.

Great sauce.  I added sugar per someone else's review and it was a BAD idea.  Way too sweet.  I had to add some jalapenos to unsweeten it.  Spices are a bit overpowering, so I will half them next time (didn't put the meat in there as we wanted a meatless sauce.)  But a definite make again with these changes.

I was looking for a sauce I could use that didn't have parsley in it (allergy). So glad I found this...its delicious.  I no longer have to struggle finding a sauce when it is this easy to make my own.  Sometimes I add 3 ounces of cream cheese to it, but other than that - I follow it exactly. I like to mix it with turkey and penne and bake it in the oven on 400 for 20 minutes. It gets a nice golden top and the leftovers is just as delicious the next day.

I love this sauce!  Super easy, in fact not much harder than using a jar, and tastes MUCH better.  Only modification I make is to use fresh mushrooms, I sautee them for a few minutes in some oil before adding to the sauce.  I've also added black olives.

This sauce makes it obvious that bottled sauce is just a racket.  Less than 1 minute to prepare the sauce.  Perfect with anything added to it.

I don't know if it was the kind of stewed tomatoes I used but my sauce dried out when I was cooking it, I had to add some water later on to keep it from burning. Maybe next time I will use diced tomatoes instead, they tend to have more juice in the can than stewed. Overall this recipe was nice and simple, but back off on the herbs if you don't want it to be too strong.

Seriously, this sauce recipe is the best I've ever had, by far.  I used Tblspn of fresh minced garlic, a Whole Red onion, and fresh thickly chopped small portabella mushrooms; way better tasting, unless you like canned stuff.

I used about 3/4lb of 80/20 ground beef and skinned 2 Sweet Italian sausage links instead of just beef. Also used 2cans of tomato sauce instead of paste, because of the amount of meat I used, it would be SUPER thick. Put it all together per the instructions. Let it simmer for about 1hour. Chow down... My authentic LongGUYland Italian girlfriend said it was FABULOUS...

I like the basic recipe.  I prefer a little more heat, so added crushed red pepper and half a can of rotel tomatoes. I have a great "cook all day" sauce, but needed a quick sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a simple delicious sauce and this was it!  I did make a few changes to suit my own taste though.  I reduced the basil to 2 tsp, used 1 1\2 tsp minced garlic and added it to the ground beef while it was cooking, added 1 Tbsp of brown sugar, and 1 tsp salt.  Overall, the sauce is great as is!

Thanks for the recipe Angie. As well as the people above, I too made some adjustments. I used minced garlic and chopped an onion as well. The big thing I did though was add and andouille sausage to it which added some spice to it. It turned out very well. My brother-in-law said that was the best sauce he had ever had and he's a picky eater.

This was decent sauce, good homemade flavor, strong acidic tomato taste, but lacked a depth and richness. Not as mellow and smooth as I would have liked, maybe if I had added some sugar? I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed, fresh mushrooms instead of canned. My family liked this but I've had much better from here. This could be a good base recipe though. Thanks Angie, this was pretty good.

My family loves this sauce and so do I. I do add extra paste as others have suggested. This is better than canned, bottled, or in some cases restaurant spaghetti sauces.

I made this exactly as the recipe called with the exception that I cooked in the in crock pot all day instead of on the stove.  It was really thick, which I like, but it was way too sweet.  Probably from so much basil.  No one in my family really liked it.  We ate it, but I won't make it again.

Wow, I was plesantly surprised with this one.  Why use bottled pasta sauce when you can make this so quickly and inexpensively.  I only cooked it for about 45 minutes, added Kalamata olives and a splash of red wine.  This was a fantastic sauce.  Oh, I had to add an extra can of tomato puree because it seemed like there was way too much meat to sauce.  Try this!  It even tasted a little sweet. Probably from the wine and natural sugars after cooking down.

This is quick and still tastes great. I use a little less basil and throw in some red and black pepper! Great for recipes like lasagna too. Freezes great for later use. No store bought sauce in my house! Thanks so much.

We really liked this sauce! I didn't have time to cook it on the stove, so I threw it into the crockpot, and cooked it on low for 4 hours. I also took advice from other reviewers, and put a can of spaghetti sauce into it. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I strayed from this written recipe a bit, but it's this recipes BASE that makes it so good. I had to add one large can of crushed tomatoes along with 1 additional small can of tomato paste for our taste. I also omitted the mushrooms. Very, very good. The best sauce that I've made to date.

The sauce ended up too sweet. (Canned tomatoes have sugar) It would be better with natural ingredients - tomatoes chopped, etc.    

I added rosemary, and also a little red wine.   Some red  pepper flakes and a little chopped up jalapeno.

So great with some little changes! First, we omitted the meat in the first step (I'm a vegetarian and added boca ground beef substitute on top of meal and husband added his italian sausage at the end also) and sauteed onions, garlic (2 cloves), and fresh sliced mushrooms.  Also we pureed the stewed tomatoes in the food processor before putting them in the stockpot.  Wonderful and hearty meal! It's our new comfort food!

Very good and very easy. To add flavor to the ground beef, I added one-half of the basil, garlic powder, and oregano to it, and the other one-half went in the sauce.

This is a really simple homemade sauce.  We used it to make lasagna.  The only thing I did differently is I used fresh (well jarred) garlic, and no mushrooms.

It was ok.  It was very sour so I had to add about a tablespoon of sugar.  I don't care for picking tomato halves out of my sauce from the stewed tomatoes.  It's not a bad recipe, just not an exceptional one.

Delicious sauce, but very very thick. I added about a half a cup of red wine, and a can of crushed tomatoes to thin it out, and 3 cloves fresh garlic for depth of flavor.

This was the first time I had made my own spaghetti sauce.  It was so quick and easy, and tasted so good.  I did use some garlic instead of onions (my husband doesn't like onions) and substituted all the spices with a few tbsp of italian seasoning.  It came out wonderfully!

This recipe was really good. This was the first time ever that I decided to make my own sauce. I used 12 oz of tomato paste because I like my sauce thicker. Also I used stewed tomatoes but the only stewed tomatoes I had were seasoned with garlic and basil.. So this was really good and I plan on making it again.

I enjoyed this sauce, but changed a few things.  I used lean ground turkey instead of beef, added a whole onion, and lots of fresh garlic.  I also added additional dry spices like Italian seasoning and thyme to amp up the flavor.  As others suggested, I added brown sugar and doubled the amount of tomato paste.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Best ever.  I love the seasoning in this sauce.  I sometimes put more tomatoes to make it a little more saucy and less thick.  Either way is good though!

I made this sauce as instructed, but added some carrots as suggested by others to "sweeten the pot" and reduce the acidity (without adding sugar).  It was certainly not bad, but was not "sauce".  It's much heartier than a traditional "sauce", but lacked the rich smooth depth of "sauce"...If you know what I mean.

This sauce was simple and good. Even though it was lacking something, I will make this again because of its ease and simple good taste. Maybe the second run, I will experiment a bit more.

Thanks Angie- We happen to like the "tomatoe-y" taste, I used both sliced and diced tomatoes from jars.  Also fresh garlic and mushrooms with a splash of red wine.  We didn't feel it needed the extra paste, though. It came out very fresh and Italian tasting.  Next time I think I'll try using fresh herbs and see what happens.

My latest attempt to replicate my favorite jarred sauce, Prego Mushroom with Extra Spice.  I doubled the tomato paste to give it a thicker texture (which I like!).  I probably doubled the garlic and added some red pepper flakes for a little spice.  I used an italian herb blend instead of just oregano and basil - next time I'll try just those two spices. Also used fresh mushroom, because I had some - but I wouldn't hesitate to use canned.  All in all very good - still not as good as my Prego, but for 3 WW points for 3/4 cup of sauce with meat - it was a winner in my book!

this recipe was good and it was easy.  I have another really good recipe that i ususally use but for time sake i wanted to try this and i was good.  When i have the time i'll stick with my other recipe but when i'm short on time then i'll defiantly use this one.  Also i took the advise of another viewer and doubled the tamato paste and it was so good because it was thicker.

Absolutely loved it!  I used fresh mushrooms rather than canned mushrooms.  Adding a half a can of rotel tomatoes and a tablespoon of red crushed peppers made it a little spicier.  Thanks so much for sharring.

I thought this sauce was great - however, Im giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because my husband thought it was "too tomato-ey".

I wonder what I did wrong!  We weren't happy with this at all.  I followed the recipe to the "T".  It ended up not being very saucey and didn't coat the pasta very well.

This is the one for us!  My husband doesn't like a strong tomatoe taste, so for us this is perfect.  I used garlic salt instead of powder and added a small can of tomatoe sauce.   Thank You Angie!

This recipe was YUMMY.  I usually use Ragu and thought that I should try and make my own. I added chopped linguica and it turned out wonderful. Picky husband loved it....I will always use this recipe. Thanks!

This is an excellent spaghetti sauce.  I used fresh mushrooms, instead of canned.  I also added more garlic, salt and Italian herb seasoning

Can you believe that I'm 21 years old and I've NEVER made spaghetti sauce by myself? This was a GREAT start! I used a lot of fresh vegtables instead of the dried basil, stewed tomatoes, etc, but WOW it turned out awesome! I also let it cook longer (I let it simmer about 2 hours) and the longer I let it go, the better it was. My fiance thanks you. :)
