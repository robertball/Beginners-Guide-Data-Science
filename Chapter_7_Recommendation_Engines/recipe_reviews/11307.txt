I'm sorry, these just didn't work for us. My son and I followed the recipe exact and it though it set up, it did not set up enough like a no-bake would. You'd go to pick it up and it would fall apart. Also, what we did try, it was way too sweet. Even for my kids.

This is the recipe for the cookies my friends call "crack" cookies as you can't stop eating them.  VERY IMPORTANT-IT IS 3 1/2 C OATMEAL.  Let the mixture stand 15 minutes before spooning out.  Cool in fridge at least an hour.

Mine set up just fine-- I popped them right into the freezer to let them harden fast. They're kind of gooey, but that's okay. My problem is that they're at once too sweet and too buttery. Not usually a problem for me, I admit, but these are just overpowering. I'd recommend cutting the sugar and the butter to about 1 1/4 cups sugar and maybe less than 1/2 cup butter. The butterscotch pudding just puts too much butter flavor in-- if you use chocolate, you could add the butter back in, I guess. Maybe if you added some salted peanuts to this, it would make a cool salty/sweet treat.

First of all, I think it should be 3 1/2 cups of oatmeal.  Also, the first time I made it I used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk instead of a 5 oz can - and it WAS way too much liquid.  My kids loved the flavor and softness of this cookie!

First of all, I read all the reviews and I used 1/2/3 cup sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 2/3 cup evaporated milk (but then I realized 5 oz. was 1/2 cup + 1 TBLS). then  It said to only cook until boiling, but I cooked it a few min. on med. heat. I added the pudding, but also added 1 tsp vanilla, and 3 1/2 cups oatmeal. The butter was unsalted and I thought I could have used salt, but because the pudding has salt, I didn't. I was going to garnish with a salted peanut. After all these alterations, my cookies seem sticky and not set, but it's only been about a half hour. They are very good, kinda like a payday bar. I would make them again. As one of the other reviews, I made these to go along with chocolate peanut butter no bakes, which did set up and are not sticky. Maybe its the pudding?

The cookies never "set".  Too much liquid in recipe.

Tried these out.  Very tasty, although quite sweet.  I wonder if other flavors of pudding would work as well?  also, chilling them in the frig seems to make them less sticky for fingers while eating.

Here are some tips from myself and other reviewers: increase oats to 3.5 to 4 cups, add teaspoon vanilla, let cookies cool in a cold place (not on the warm kitchen counter), and make sure you use 5 fl. oz. of milk and not the whole 12 oz. can.  I used chocolate pudding (yes it makes it very sweet) but I think any flavor would be good in this cookie.  A very good no-bake recipe.

Yummy! I followed the reviews that said use 3 1/2 cups of oatmeal and they set up fine. Will add this to my christmas cookie line up.  I used reg milk second time instead of evaporated ( if forgot to buy it, DUH!) and it came out fine.

I thought this made an excellent non chocolate No-bake cookie.I was going to take these to work since there were so many, but my husband and I ate them all up! I plan to make regular no-bakes and these and plate them together for contrast next time.
Thanks for the recipe!!

I didn't really like the results but I had changed so many things and I really like the idea so I tried to give it a neutral rating. I only had chocolate pudding mix and even with reduced sugar, it was still too sweet for me. I did put them into a square pan and put them in the fridge making bars out of them. I'll try again maybe with the recommended pudding mix this time, or leave out the pudding all together and try with marshmallow instead as the binding agent. Will definitely have to add vanilla in that case.

While the mixture is super delicious, it is a big gloopy mess.  The recipe has far too much liquid.  After using almost an entire container of oats, I finally realized that nothing I did would absorb the liquid and help these cookies take shape.  The recipe might work if you reduce the butter and milk by half and still add an extra cup or so of oats.

made it with some of the changes I read in reviews,  hence the 3 stars.  As I did it, with changes from the reviews, I would give it 5 stars.  I made 3 batches.  I only used 1/2 cup butter and cut the sugar to 1 cup on each batch.  On 1 I used a 5oz can of milk.  That was the perfect amount.  The other 2 I used a 12oz can, split in 2, and it was a bit too much milk.  I had to add extra oatmeal to soak up the extra liquid.  I let the milk, butter, sugar, boil for exactly 2 minutes.  I let the mixture sit in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill.  Instead of making cookies out of them, I rolled them into balls.  I had no problem at all with them sticking together.

Way too sweet! I used 1 1/3 c. sugar but it was still too sweet. Next time I will use 3/4 c. You definitely need to add 3 1/3 or more c. oatmeal or the cookies will not stick together.
