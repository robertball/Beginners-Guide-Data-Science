DELICIOUS! I used grape tomatoes and added only 1/2 the bagel chips in with the other ingredients and dressing, and the other 1/2 right before serving to keep some crunch in there. I could not bring myself to add a full tablespoon of dried basil in the dressing (I'm not a super huge fan of dried basil), so I did reduce that to only about 1/4 teaspoon, and that was perfect for us. This really did taste just like bruschetta! I will def be making this often over the summer~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Unbelievably good!!  I doubled this recipe for a group of 10 tonight and it was the highlight of the meal.  I recommend whisking the dressing ingredients separately (olive oil, vinegar, minced garlic, dried basil, salt & pepper) and then mixing the dressing into the tomatoes, etc.  Chill at least 2 hours!   Don't be deterred by the addition of dried basil -- it serves a purpose of being a concentrated taste as well as making pretty little specks on the mozzarella cubes.   This is definitely one of my new contributions to any "potluck"!

I really enjoyed this which I made exact to the recipe, as always.  However, while I was eating it, I knew it could be MUCH better with just one or two slight changes.  First of all, with so few ingredients, those ingredients need to be best quality, and/or fresh!  I'm making it again tonight, and I'm using home-grown Roma tomatoes & fresh Basil.  Did you know that the more you cut from your basil plant the better it grows!!!  Two, nix the Red-wine vinegar, & use Basalmic vinegar (the best grade you can find, 5 medallions or better.  AND, use that bottle ONLY for this type of fresh presentation!).  The last change I will make is a personal choice only, & that's because I really disliked the bagel chips.  So, I'm making bread cubes using Chef John's method (see Chef John's Panzanella Salad for the technique to make bread cubes that don't get soggy!).  So that's it, for me.  Thanks Steph, for sharing a great salad, and Blessings!!!

I've been making Panzanella for YEARS (which is what this is, except it uses bagel chips instead of stale italian bread) Really good with cucumbers in it as well. I've also added prosciutto or pepperoni or other italian meats if I have them. Love it! Thanks for sharing! I'll definitely try it with the bagel chips!

Amazing, was really good.  I forgot the chips (ok, I ate them before I made it).  It was still amazing.  Will do again!  I even had a coworker say, Wow that looks great, ha

I left the onions out for my kids. I did not have fresh basil so I used Lighthouse basil which is freeze dried and very close to fresh and easy to keep on hand.
My family loved the salad and to my dismay there were NO leftovers for my lunch!??

WOW - we LOVED this salad!  I took the ingredients up to the lake and when I got ready to put the salad together I realized I had bought garlic pita chips rather than bagel chips.  They still worked great in the salad.  I mixed up the salad about 30 minutes before dinner and added the chips about 15 minutes before dinner time. We have fresh tomatoes and basil growing in our garden, so I know this fantastic salad will be made numerous times over this summer. Thank you Steph Barber, for sharing your recipe.

I added some parmesan as well...which i mixed in right before serving.  I served it with the option of sprinkling it with crushed garlic rye chips or scooping onto a baguette, or both.  I used a variety of tomatoes; Hot House, Grape and Roma.  I replaced 2 T. of Red Wine Vinegar with Balsamic.  I used Pickled Red Onion.  Added some Italian Seasoning.  It’s delicious!

I think it’s too much onion so I only used 1/4 of a red onion.  But really, how can any combination of mozzarella, tomato and basil be bad???  Does anyone know where you can get just bagel chips?  The only place I’ve seen them is in bagged Chex Mix!  I do a dried bread stick with everything bagel seasoning and Parmesan so I served those along side instead of the bagel chips.

I loved it it tasted just like bruschetta I couldn’t find bagel chips so I used pita chips and it didn’t affect the taste I’m sure but they got too soggy to save the salad for leftovers. I may have crushed them too small too. I also used fresh tomatoes from my garden. Nice and firm yum!

This is a great recipe.  Instead of the bagel chips, I used homemade garlic parmesan croutons.  You need to add some of the croutons just before serving if you want a crunchy texture to the salad.

This was really, really good. I didn't have red onion so I used some fresh chives. I couldn't find bagel chips so I subbed with Grissol Baguettes (garlic flavour).

This recipe is a keeper!  I will def. make this again and again!  I have fresh basil growing and used 6 very large plum tomatoes.  Unfortunately too early for our garden ones.  These were store bought.  I used fresh mozzarella also.  I did whisk the dressing ingredients to incorporate everything and then poured it over the salad.  Along with my husband and my parents were here for dinner...everyone liked it!  It's def. a nice summer dish to bring somewhere also. Can't wait to use tomatoes from the garden.  Thank you Stephanie for sharing your recipe!

So simple and good. I used torn italian bread, real basil, balsamic vinegar and whisked up the dressing separately.  Also sliced the onion instead of chopping so people could take them out if they wanted :) I could eat this all day.

This was very good!! I had to use buttery garlic croutons instead, once it sat in the fridge for 30 minutes the texture of this was perfect......nice summer side for sure! Thank you for sharing this:-)
