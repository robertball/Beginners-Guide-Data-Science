These  were pretty  good.  I used the mini M&M's.  I also lined the baking dish with parchment paper to prevent sticking and it made clean up easier.

I have been looking for a home made granola bar recipe for about 10 years and this is it! This is the first recipe I've had that actually held together like a bar and didn't crumble. And it is really good! I had to substitute agave for the honey because I was out. so i put in a little less oil because agave has more moisture than honey. It turned out amazing. I'll be trying it again with craisins and or nuts as well! so excited to experiment with this one.

Loved these. The only change I made was that I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. My kids and hubby enjoyed them. I will definitely make them again.

I added cinnamon and instead of the candies used chocolate chips and salted caramel chips. My family ate these up in a day. Will definitely make them again! Try with fruit and chocolate chips instead of candy.

It was ok.   Not too sweet and that's nice.  Would have liked a little more color texture.
