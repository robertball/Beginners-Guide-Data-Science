Excellent recipe: moist as can be, and chocolatey. I used milk chocolate chips since I'm not a fan of semi sweet chocolate, and it came out terrific. This is a keeper.

My grandmother has made this cocoa apple cake for years and years now and it's delicious!  She got her recipe off the back of a bag a sugar.  The only difference is that her recipe calls for 2 and 1/2 c flour and she finely dices the apple instead of grating it.  It's wonderful and will always remind me of her.  For some reason, nobody else in the family can make it quite as good as she can -must be that grandmotherly touch!  We also freeze it and sometimes just cut a slice off straight from the freezer and eat it ... mmmmmm... this recipe is worth trying -it'll always be one of my treasures!

Delicious, easy and very moist (because of the apples). Has no oil either like many of these kinds of recipes (the apples replace it) so you don't get the added fat and calories. To help clarify...2 cups of apples is about 3-4 apples depending on size.  I dusted mine with confectioners sugar for a nice presentation.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Instead of half a cup of water I used a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of rum.  I also eliminated the allspice and doubled the cinnamon.  I will definitely make this part of my holiday baking.

I knew I should not have made it, as I can't stop at just one piece.  It is wonderful and requires no icing or frosting.

Any doubt this is the best cake? I won third place at the county fair with this cake on my very first try back in 1987...and first the next year.

I made this cake in a 9x13 pan by baking it at 350 for 45 minutes.  It was indeed tasty and moist.  It had a funny, spongy texture, though.  The only changes I made were to use apple cider instead of water and use half margarine/half butter instead of all butter.  I did not frost it because it was sweet enough with the mini chocolate morsels I added.

My mother makes this cake every year for Christmas morning.  It's fantastic!  She does not think it works well in a bundt pan; I haven't tried it in anything but a loose-bottom tube pan.  Would love to hear bundt success stories, as I'd love to make the cake in my Cathedral bundt pan!

Went apple-picking, so had many apples to use up.  This cake was good...not amazing, but good.  Some changes based on other reviews:  Used both brown and white sugars (1/2 of each), omitted the allspice and doubled up the cinnamon, used 1 cup milk chocolate chips, baked in a 9X13 pan at 350 for 45 minutes.  I did think that the apple taste was not as pronounced as I might have preferred.  Very moist.  Will try in bundt cake shape next time.  Side note: I found apples to be not the easiest things to grate.

I really like this recipe, although I used a little less sugar, butter and flour and replaced chocolate chips with red currant berries. It came out very delicious and moist. My whole family loved it, thank you!

I got mixed reviews on this cake...I thought it was only okay, while others though it was divine. You either love it or are just okay with it.

Flavor was a little rich for me, everyone else thought it was yummy. Mine actually fell in the middle, so I scooped it up and mushed it into small serving cups. Sprinkled powder sugar and no one new.

This was Ok.  I followed the recipe and thought it was a little bland.  I used jonathan apples and it might have been better with granny smith.  I would also add more chocolate chips.

This cake was ok.  The taste was very good and it was very moist, but it didn't seem to hold together very well.  I pretty much ended up with a plate of crumbs.  Good tasting crumbs, but still crumbs.

I have made this cake twice now and both times I loved it! The taste changes depending on the type/sweetness of the apples. I used a simple confectioners glaze on the first one and I used shredded coconut on the second. I think that the cake was better without the coconut- it is perfect just as it is! This will absolutely be a holiday tradition in my house, thank you!

This cake is great. I have been making it since the '70's. It was originally on the back of a Hawaiian sugar box. Don't overcook it and it turns out best if you actually make it in a spring form pan.

It was very good and moist. I was wondering if the spices would go well with the cocoa and apple combo, but they just gave it a deeper, richer flavour. The only change I made was to chop the apples instead of grating them, because we prefer a harder texture. Thank you, we'll make it again!

Great recipe, a keeper for sure. I have made it a couple of times now and it hardly lasts long enough for me to get a piece. The only thing i did differently the second time was add a tablespoon more of cocoa. Excellent!

I made this cake on Saturday to bring to a casual dinner party. It fell apart trying to get it out of the bundt pan for me - just like another reviewer.  It was probably not cool enough but even so, I'll use a tube pan or springform next time. It was a Big Hit with the other couple and my husband.  Very moist and the chocolate/apple taste was delicious.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Will definitelykeep this one in my recipe box.

I've made this cake for almost 20 years, it's great. I double the chocolate and the spices, grate my apples finely. It cooks well in a standard pan and any fine fudge frosting makes it absolutely decadent!

Just ok.  Not a lot of apple taste and too much cinnamon.  I had to put a carmel glaze on top to add flavor to it.

I did add candied cherry, my son raves about it...

I picked apples yesterday, and needed to make something to start using them. This recipe seemed perfect, and, though it required only 2 apples (they were large), it was just that. Easy enough, and very tasty. Aside from chopping the apples in my food processor, I made no changes. (Now, what do I do with the other 9 pounds of apples?)

I have been making this cake for over 45 years.  I found the recipe on the back of a box of C&H sugar.  It's always been a favorite with my family.  Only problem I have ever had with this recipe was the altitude in Boulder, CO.

So nice! Light texture, not overly sweet. Used 2 macs and 1 mystery apple.. nice flavour. Omitted all spice, used barely a sprinkle of clove and used a 1 1/4 tsp of cinnamon instead and 2 rounded tbsp of cocoa. Next time will add more chocolate chips (and might try walnuts too!) I used 9 x 13 pan for about 45 min. Really happy with this easy recipe.

Delicious combination of flavours. I had to use up a bunch of farm apples someone gave me and was craving chocolate, this cake did just the trick. My husband requested it again already. 
Only changes I made is substituted the butter for vegetable oil, and the water for oatmilk. A little touch of confectioners sugar on top made for a beautiful presentation. Delicious!!! Thanks for sharing.

The combination of apple and cocoa tasted better than I expected. The cake was moist and tasty as others said. I made some changes for a healthier treat. I only added 1 cup of sugar. Since apples and chocolate chips are sweet already, the cake didn't need that much more sugar. And I'm glad I added less than the recipe stated. It was sweet enough. I also took someone's suggestion and added yogurt in place of half of the butter. It was still delicious. I also didn't have enough apples so substituted the rest with some pears I had at home and it was fine. A nice chocolatey dessert for chocolate lovers. Next time I'll add an icing.

I made this for my first New Year yoga class. Raves! I made it in two 9x5" loaf pans; came out very moist and delicious. Instead of 2 cups of white sugar, I did one of white and one of brown. I think the chocolate was subtle and didn't overpower the apples, but I love chocolate any kind of way. I also added a half cup of pecans, but next time I'll add more. I'm thinking white chocolate chips would be good too.
