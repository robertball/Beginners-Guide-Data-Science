These were horrible---so sour and dry!  What a waste of time and ingredients to prepare these.  I even added extra sugar to both the brownies and icing, still tasteless.  Nobody would touch them after one bite.  Threw them out!

I would not call this fantastic. My advise is spread it thinner next time. It took forever to cook. I baked it for 1.20sec and the people  at work still says it's not cook inside. It's too hard, and on the bitter side. I will not make it again.

I was disappointed with these brownies. They were very dry and did not taste very well. I threw the whole thing away at first taste.

My Culinary Arts students selected this recipe to make.  I wish they had read the reviews and not just the recipe name.  These brownies are very expensive to make and have a very poor texture and flavor.  The batter is so dense, the brownies don't cook all the way through and end up extremely dry on the outside and goo on the inside.  You know they are bad when teenagers won't eat them.
