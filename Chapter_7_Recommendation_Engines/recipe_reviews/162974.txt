Sparked my curiosity......  No one liked it in my family, but I am sure there might be an audience out there for this dish.  Just not our thing, I guess.

This is the recipe I was looking for...good Pennsylvania Dutch cooking. We are from Juniata County, PA, where bacon grease is saved in a jar in the kitchen and used for later! This recipe is delicious!
