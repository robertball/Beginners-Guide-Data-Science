Fabulous salad!!!  My boyfriend and I made yummy sounds the whole time eating this.  Instead of using the Kraft dressing, I made my own.  I used Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, fresh garlic, a touch of dijon, a drop of maple syrup, and salt and pepper.  As well I added some sliced Red Peppers.  I'll make this again!
