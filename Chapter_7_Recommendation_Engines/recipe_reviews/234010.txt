First things first and that is I must admit that I did not make the crust by hand. I love to cook but am not a baker and am dough challenged and I bought a pre-made one. So, my rating is strictly based on the rest of the recipe. This was different and we enjoyed it very much. I thought the Mexican cheese blend sounded a bit odd but it worked nicely. My only complaint is that I only used a thin layer of the pizza sauce as the recipe called for and I think it could have used a thicker layer and will do so the next time. I was also afraid that the beef gravy would sog up the fries real bad but it actually didn't. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!
