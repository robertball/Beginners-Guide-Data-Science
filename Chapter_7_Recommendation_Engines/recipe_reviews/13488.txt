I've made this recipe lots of times and although I would agree it is time consuming, everyone loves it when I make it. 

Just one tip to shorten the time a little. I use the microwave to melt the chocolate layers and the caramel layer. Just check your chips after every 30 seconds (stirring each time you check). Do not overcook chocolate in the microwave!

I hope this helps!

I enjoyed this.  As far as getting the bottom layer up, I found that leaving it out of the fridge at room temp for 20 minutes helped.  I also wish the chocolate layers were a bit thicker.  The caramel oozed out a lot when left out to serve at my gathering.  Maybe next time, I won't use quite as much of the whipping cream, then it will be thicker and hold its shape.  Overall, it was good.

The candy was delicious, but a bit messy.  Since it must be kept refridgerated, if it was not consumed immediately, the caramel would begin to melt if at room temperature for more then 5 minutes.  I will make again for a party at home, but not to take to work, school , etc due to  the gooey-ness.

Yummy! It is a lot of work but it is worth all of it. Next time I make it though I am going to cut back on the peanut butter.

This is an outstanding recipe.
I was able to make the bottom layer and the top layer by melting in the microwave for several minutes on defrost.   
This candy makes everyone rave and ask for your recipe !  Thanks Merry CHRISTmas

I'm not sure why I didn't get it as I was making the layers, but it was sure a tasty surprise when I took the first bite and instantly thought "Snickers!"  My mom and aunt make a recipe similar to this.  They keep the candy in the freezer until ready to be put out.  Caramel doesn't melt as quickly.  Just be carefult when you bit in!

This recipe (well, very similar recipe) has been in my family and I LOVE it! We call them "Snickers Bars." The only difference I've used is melting the caramels with water. I'll try this version next time I make them. I just wanted to note that if you are thinking of making these bars, they are delish!

Wonderful recipe Big hit over the holidays.  Had problems removing from pan.  Bottom layer would not come out cleanly.  Next time I will make a cookie crumb crust then add first layer.

I could not believe the response I got from this candy.  Everyone asked for more and talked about how tasty it was.  We nicknamed it "the Snicker candy."  It was a bit time consuming to make just because the layers had to cool but it was well worth it.  The layers looked for beautiful once the candy was cut.  I will use this recipe over and over.  Wonderful!!!

This is a great sweet and sticky candy bar.  Every year I make plates and tins of cookies and candies for the holidays to send to friends and family.  These candies are requested by all.  Well worth the time they take to make.

I thought this took a lot of time to make but everybody loved it. A lot of stirring, melting, refrigerating involved, but it's worth it.

Absolutely killer good!  Very rich so cut it into smaller squares. And keep it cold or keep ice under the serving dish when out of the refrigerator as it will get awfully gooey when warm. Made this for a snow skiing barbecue with 14 people. It was so yummy that we offered it to other skiers and they kept coming back for more. It's a keeper!

This recipe is excellent, and addictive.  I've made it several times, and have no problems with the layers, etc.  I don't think it's that much work, either - you mainly have to allow the "chill" time between layers, but I just work on other things while I'm waiting.  I make holiday tins for people, and this candy is included for everyone.
