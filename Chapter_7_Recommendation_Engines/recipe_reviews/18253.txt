Great recipe but way more work than needed. I cut up the velveeta into chunks and placed them in my casserole dish. Then I poured in the two cans of soup and 3/4 c. milk. I put the casserole dish in the oven at 350 and let the cheese melt. Once it was melted, I took the casserole dish out of the oven, stirred the contents until well mixed and added the rice, broccoli, and chopped onion..I omitted the celery. I cooked it for about 30 minutes on 350. It was a big hit.

For those complaining that this is bland, 1) IT'S BROCCOLI CHEESE CASSEROLE...not meant to be a symphony of flavors; 2) You see the ingredients. Anyone with half a brain can tell it's going to be bland and anyone with the other half would throw some garlic and/or spices in. There's no excuse for being surprised that it's bland. For those saying this is unsophisticated: IT'S BROCCOLI CHEESE CASSEROLE. Get off your high horse.

Fact is that this is a perfect no-frills recipe that is perfect as-is or dolled up. You can sub wild rice or real cheddar (as I did), add spices, etc. It's a blank canvas; you bring the paint.

I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before trying this dish!  My mom and husband are veteran broccoli rice casserole lovers and thought this dish was exactly like it should be.  It is a bland dish but that's what broccoli rice casseroles are.  The only alteration I made was using milk instead of water and it turned out exactly as it should have.  I, too, thought it was a bit runny before baking but Mom said, "it will bake fine," and it did.  Personally, I like a more flavorful dish so next time, I will add seasoned salt and maybe some garlic.  More traditional broccoli rice casserole lovers will want this recipe as is, though!

If yours turned out mushy or runny, it is because 15 minutes is definitely not long enough to cook it.  It is a typo and should read 45 minutes.  The correct cook time is noted at the top (Cook Time: 45 Minutes).

Despite several decidedly strident reviews and two rather horrific admissions of forcing the casserole down the throats of family members and threatening an 8 year old child, I still felt this recipe had promise and gave it a try.

It turned out to be a marvelous, homey side dish. I found it easy to prepare and only used two large pots for the preparation and I even doubled the recipe as I was making it for a church function. For those not cooking for a crowd or the starting line up of a professional football team, you will probably want to cut this recipe  in half.

I did find the directions  to be a little vague. It should have specified that the rice measurement listed was uncooked and will yield 6 cups when prepared. Also the recipe calls for a "bunch" of celery, it should be one stalk, if an entire bunch were used the casserole would be inedible.

The only real change I made was to top the dish with shredded cheddar. I live  in the South and a casserole isn't a casserole without a crumb or cheese topping. 

This is a recipe that I will definitely make again.

I prepared this recipe specifically because someone commented that it wasn't for the "sophisticated palate". As someone with a sophisticated palate but with a decidedly un-sophisticated budget, I found this recipe to be delicious, easy and worthy of making again. I hope the "sophisticated" person enjoys her lobsters and golf outings and leaves wonderful recipes like this one to those with "taste". :)

I didn't quite understand the reason for all the water and actually didn't use any of it, nor did I use the processed cheese. Instead, I added the soups right from the cans along with shredded cheddar directly into the rice mixture and gradually added some milk and stirred until it reached a consistancy I was happy with. Along with some seasonings this dish was really good.

I didn't plan on altering this recipe when I decided to make it... But after reading a lot of the reviews I was concerned that the finished product would be bland.  So I added fresh minced garlic, seasoning salt & paprika.  I used 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Chicken & Mushroom (I wasn't even aware that it existed until today! lol) & 1 can of Campbell's Broccoli & Cheese Soup (Next time I'm going to try Cream of Broccoli in place of).  In place of the water I used milk.  I omitted the celery.  And I used 2 pkgs. of 16 oz. frozen broccoli.  I sauteed the onion in the butter & in the same pan (on low heat setting after the onion was cooked); Then added the soups, milk & seasonings & mixed all together, next the cubed velveta stirring until it was all melted I added the dry, uncooked rice & broccoli (I heated in the microwave for about 10 min. to soften).  Made sure it was all mixed together, the put it in the bakind pan (COVERED) for 45 min.  Uncovered it & baked additional 10-15 min.  My husband loved it!  I know a lot of people are against changing the recipe & reviewing it.  But I think reviews have a lot to do with sharing tips, shortcuts & tweaks to help other cooks & ultimately make the dish even  better.   What I really like about this recipe is there is a lot of different ways to put this together & you can tweak it & make it your own easily!

Even Mexican-style processed cheese for a little kick and fresh broccoli didn't redeem this bland, boring and uninspired dish. Definitely not for the sophisticated palate, so it might just be a real kid pleaser or for those placed on a soft and bland diet (in which case, stick to the plain cheese).  Hubby and I would have much preferred a simple, steamed broccoli and a basic rice pilaf. Lots of bother for an unmemorable side dish.

TASTY! Plus, very easy and quick to make.  To make a complete meal, I added 1 lb of boiled/cooked cubed chicken.  After boiling the chicken until cooked, I then fryed the cubes with a dash of lemon pepper seasoning and a dash of garlic powder.  I then mixed it in with the rest of the casserole and topped it off with a cup of dried bread crumbs.  The result was very satisfying and it makes alot! Thank you Gina for sharing!!

I made this recipe last night using my new Allrecipes cookbook.  I wish I had read the reviews on the site before I began!  However, after making the cheese sauce, common sense told me that there was WAY to much sauce for the amount of rice and broccoli.  I doubled the rice and almost doubled the broccoli (used 2 16 oz. packages).  The finished results were okay for my family - but certainly nothing I would serve for a special occasion.  Still MORE THAN saucy and cheesy enough.  I can't even IMAGINE making the recipe as printed.

This dish is a staple in our house and at family get togethers.  It can be a side as written or a main casserole by adding chicken.  These are my modifications:  I use 2 16oz packages of broccoli, I use brown rice cooked in chicken broth (rice cooker), I substitute cream of chicken for cream of broccoli, substitute milk for the water, and add season-all to taste.  To reduce the number of dishes, I saute the onions & celery in a large sauce pan and then add the soups, milk, & cheese until melted.  I combine this mixture with the brocolli and rice right in the baking dish.

Awful recipe- very bland! Too many dishes to clean for such a simple side. I would read other reviews before trying. I wouldn't pre-cook broccoli (it was mushy). Add more cheese and broccoli. Add seasoning (and lots of it if you want any taste). Don't add as much water. Basically you need find another recipe.

I agree this is a good starter recipe. Here are my changes.
1. Thaw the broccoli but don't cook it. That way it stays crisp.
2. The recipe should read one cup of instant rice, not three. I chose to cook one cup of rice (not instant) which made three cups. This amount was perfect.
3. I also started with sautéing the onion and celery, I chopped an equal amount of celery to match the chopped onion. Took it off the heat and added the rest of the ingredients.
4. Used milk instead of water and actually used a little more than it called for.
5. Added:
two chopped cloves of garlic to the onion and celery
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne
2 beaten eggs
6. Used four cups of sharp grated cheddar instead of processed cheese.
7. Topped with two sleeves of Ritz Crackers crushed and mixed with four tablespoons of butter.
Seriously, this had a lot of flavor, wasn't mushy and my family LOVED it!

I'm still giving this 5 stars for being a good springboard recipe. It's very rare I can follow a recipe exactly :)  Instead of frozen broccoli I used fresh and I steamed it. I skipped the celery because I didn't have any. I also used regular long-grain rice which I cooked before assembling the casserole. Instead of processed cheese I used sharp cheddar and monterey jack. I also added bacon because...well, bacon makes everything better!!

Here's my take on this recipe. Yes it is kind of bland but it is creamy, cheesy goodness! I have been making this recipe for years and I gotta say I don't understand the necessity of all the steps.I make this recipe with 2 cans cream of chicken, omit the mushroom. I omit celery and I do saute the onions. Now here is where I deviate from the recipe.After sauteing the onions, I add everything together in a big bowl and mix(I don't even cook the rice)I then pour the mixture into greased 9 x 13 pan and cook for 15 minutes. I stir the casserole and then bake another 15-25 minutes. Comes out perfect each time, lots easier and I have had people complain I never make enough! P.S. I do thaw the broccoli before adding to the recipe.

This recipe SOUNDED wonderful and I think it would be.....but it really needs some clarification. I made it this week for Christmas as directed and I am stil confused about 2 parts. It took me TWO 9X13 dishes to fit it all. What is one bunch of celery? I took that to mean a "bunch" that is sold at the grocery store and also is the 3 cups of instant rice cooked or uncooked??? I read it as 3 cups and then to "prepare as directed" so I ended up with 6 cups. Maybe this is why it wouldn't fit in one dish???  Good ingredients and I know it would be wonderful if the recipe was clarified.....

Did some tweaking. Added an additional can of cream of mushroom soup. Use milk instead of water.  Mix all ingredients in one 5q pot to minimized dishes used.  So I sauted onions, then added rice and water. Let cook. Added broccoli after rice done. So it helped thaw out frozen broccoli. Added mushroom, cheese and milk in bowl and microwaved til bubbly. Added salt, pepper, parsley & pinch of garlic to bowl. Then pour mixture into pot and mixed thoroughly. Poured into 9x13 pan. Baked as directed. Added shredded cheese to top last 10 mins of cooking. I had a lot leftover in pot which made enough for a 8x8 pan. I think the directions given were not accurate or specific enough, this is where it loses a star for me. Great as a starter recipe though.

I have made this recipe several times to rave reviews and this is how our family does it: forget the water and DON'T cook the rice.  After sauteing the veggies (along with lots of garlic), add the soups and cheese and mix in the saute pan till cheese melts, then add uncooked instant rice and broccoli, add a big bunch of fresh chopped parsley, season with salt and pepper and any other herbs that grab you that day (thyme is my favorite), pour into a buttered baking dish and bake covered for 30 minutes, then uncover, top with shredded cheddar cheese and bake 10-15 minutes more.  Allow to sit for 15 minutes before serving.

Made this for company at lasts night dinner.  It was delicious.  Instead of water I used 1 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of sour cream and I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese because that was what I had on hand.  I also added a little bit of garlic powder with the salt and pepper.  I did not use instant rice, I used long grain white rice and cooked it according to the package and just threw in the frozen broccoli all in the same pot.  Thanks for this.

I am becoming dissapointed with this site or maybe I am just having bad luck with bad recipes lately. This was barely edible. We ate it, but it was nothing special or tasty. Not sure what all the fuzz was about.

This was O.K. but I've had better, the sauce was a little runny. If I make it again would do the rice in broth to flavor it a little more.

A version of this recipe has been a traditional dish in our family for years. However, we only use 1 cup of Minute Rice, 1 10 oz jar of Cheese Whiz (melt it in the microwave first), a stick of margarine melted and NO water in addition to all the other ingredients. We don't cook the broccoli or rice first - just thaw the broccoli, saute the celery and onion in the margarine and mix it all up and bake for 45 minutes. Everybody calls it Green Rice.

This wasn't my favorite dish.  The taste was ok, but the rice was dried out.  The directions didn't state whether or not to cover the dish so I didn't.  I think it might have been better to cook covered w/foil to prevent it from drying out.

I tried this recipe on m family last night.  It was a runny, soupy, very bland.  Not to mention that it makes a ton of food!  Still trying to figure out what to do with all the leftovers.

I changed this recipe a little. I don't like processed cheese, so I used 16 oz. mild cheddar. I used cream of broccoli soup and cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. I also substituted milk for the water. I added crushed Ritz crackers mixed with a little melted butter as a topping. The family liked it, so I made one for my husband  to take to work for their Thanksgiving party. The pan came home empty!

I am also happy that I read the reviews first! It sure makes a large amount. I used Tex Mex Cheez Whiz ,beef boullion in the rice and did not use onions or celery. I would add ALOT more broccoli!!! It was delicious!

This was fantastic! I used 1 can of cream of broccoli soup & one of cream of chicken soup. Added shredded cheddar cheese since that's what was in my fridge as well as a little garlic powder for extra flavor. Tasted great! I think next time I'll use some shredded chicken as well!

It was yummy but should be renamed, Rice and Broccoli Casserole as it was more rice than Broccoli.  Still very good though, my 2 year old son loved it!

I made this for my boyfriend last night and after reading all the reviews and adding my own little twist, this recipes came out great!  I omitted the celery. For all those who said that it is too bland... try adding 1 or 2 jalepeno peppers (remove the seeds and chop).  It gave it that kick it needed and my boyfriend LOVED LOVED LOVED it! Here's what I did: 1.) per review, I mixed 1/2 can of each soup, milk, and velvetta cheese in the cassarole dish and melted in the oven for 10 minutes on 400. 2.) cooked 2 pkgs of instant brown rice half way through in the microwave (about 3 minutes) 3.) sauteed broccolli, 1/2 an onion (chopped) and 2 chopped jalepeno peppers in a skillet for 2-3 minutes 4.) mixed rice and vegetables into the melted mixture, added salt and pepper and a dash of cajun seasoning, and baked at 400 degrees for 20-30 minutes  Next time, I'm definately adding chicken! Hope this helps!

Rated 5 Star on wonderful taste & approval of 2 different groups for whom prepared.  Large quantity (9x13 dish)& only deviation from recipe was Velveeta Cheese plus added a bit more frozen broccoli.  As to Salt - be careful as the soups were loaded with salt. NOTE: Last 5 minutes of cooking, I "sprinkled" grated mild cheddar cheese on top. Next time I will add pimento within for color!  Only downside (I do have a dishwasher) is all of the clean-up, so this is not a recipe one makes & quickly exits the kitchen: pot for rice, skillet for sauteeing celery/onions, pot for broccoli, pot for soup/cheese plus large pot/bowl for stirring. SHORTCUT EXISTS: - saute in a large pot, add soup/cheese to melt. Then add rice & broccoli to this same large pot. Ease in clean-up truly counts whenever time is short!

This dish is too complicated for a SIDE DISH.  You can buy this dish frozen.  I would rather spend more time on the Main Dish.

I followed the directions exactly, except did not use celery.  Was a little worried when I combined the ingredients put it in the 9 x 13 pan (it was soupy).  45 minutes later, I took it out of the oven and it was absolutely WONDERFUL.  It was worth all the extra time to prepare!!!!

Delicious!  This will become one of my top go-to casseroles.  It was pretty easy to make (although a little time consuming).  I halved the recipe and it still served about 7 people!

One of the best dishes on the table. Had a gathering of friends for dinner and made this wonderful receipe.  Of course I used fresh broccoli and Sharp Cheddar instead of frozen broccoli and Processed American Cheese. I also only used 1/2 an onion and 3 stocks of celery.  Very good side dish and lots of compliments.  Warning - makes a TON!  It overspilled from my 9x13 pan in the oven towards the end of the cook time.

This recipe was good, but not very exciting.  I used a lot of salt and pepper when eating because it was a bit bland.  Also, it makes a LOT so you may want to scale it down unless you have a lot of company or you want a lot of leftovers.

I made this for a class reunion and it was a big hit. You do need to spice it up some to get a more southern country flavior. I used fresh broccoli. I did not use the celery and I placed the onions (raw)  and melted the butter then placed it into my bowl. I added several slices of crisp cooked bacon and some garlic. I also put about 6 oz of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the mixture. I used milk in place of the water. Just before it was done I sprinkiled some shredded sharp cheddar cheese ontop. For thoses complaining about how much it makes, well it did say use a 9x13 inch pan. I will fix again for home but cut the recipe in half. 0(*@*)0

This was a good recipe for broccoli rice casserole, but think it needed some more cheese. Next time I think I'll try adding 8 oz more of Velveeta and see how it tastes.

Delicious and traditional!  I did use the reduced fat cream of soups just to help with the fat content and you can't even tell a difference!!!  I cut back on the celery and left out the onion all together cause of picky eaters (boo them).  Will use this recipe again with maybe homemade cream of soups for an even healthier version!!

Edit:  Made this again Thanksgiving 2014 but subbed milk for water...even better, plus added a good shake of each:  garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.  DEEELICIOUS once again!!

this is very good. if u find it bland, change up the cream soups and cook your rice with broth instead of water. sometimes i use a can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and a can of cambells cheddar cheese and just leave out the cheese (i dont like it to cheesey). or a can of cream of broccoli and a can of cream of mushroom and chicken. mix it up!

Another great recipe.  We leave out the onion and celery, and the dish is still amazing.  Added a little extra brocoli for presonal preference.  Don't skimp on the rice, or the dish will be runny.

Very tasty. I used fresh broccoli, regular rice cooked in my rice cooker instead of instant, and my husband doesn't like cream of mushroom, so I used 2 cans cream of chicken. I left out the celery because I hate celery. We really liked this a lot. By the way, it's not necessary to melt the cheese in the soups in a separate saucepan. I just poured the soups and the cubed cheese into the dish with the hot rice and broccoli, and the cheese melted when all was mixed together.

Turned out great!!!  I made a couple minor changes:  1)  Used broccoli florets (don't use broccoli cuts).  2)  I used only a cup of water instead of the 1-1/4 cups.  3)  I used half cheddar/half Velveeta (with some extra cheddar on top).  4)  I cut the celery in half.  5)  I sprinkled a tiny bit of garlic powder into the soup mixture.

I used a second can of mushroom soup instead of the chicken soup since I am a vegetarian - I also added a pinch of ground mustard, a hefty amount of garlic powder, and a handful of shredded mozzarella that I happened to have left over from a previous meal.  Baked for 45 minutes and it turned out fantastically!  I did make this a second time and I don't know what was wrong with my brain that day but I dumped in my rice - UNCOOKED!  Oh no!  I ended up adding a bit extra water and cooking it a little longer, and it actually turned out just fine - crisis averted!  (I used Minute Rice.)

We loved this! We used cream of chicken with herbs and we halved the recipe. I also seasoned it with salt and pepper. We will use steamed rice sometimes and we find you don't need to re-bake it after mixing everything. Also if we don't have enough velveeta we will just use some shredded cheese since we always have it on hand. So yummy, this will be be a regular side dish for us now.

Great taste, but way too much rice. I had to add more liquid as well. Too many pots and pans. But family really enjoyed this. I used chicken stock instead of water with the rice, and crumbled some Ritz crackers on the top for the last 15 minuntes.

Recipe is great with a few crucial additions. FIRST: Add 1 cup of sliced baby carrots and 1 diced yellow pepper to the onion mixture before you saute. SECOND: this is crucial- when you add the ingredients to bowl for mixing add in 1/4 cup of Mrs. Dash original blend spices (the yellow one) and 1 tablespoon of salt, this makes it taste sooo much better. THIRD: Add 4 cups of cubed chicken breast for a more filling meal. FOURTH: Top with sliced cheddar cheese for the last 10 minutes of baking. Dish was delicious and my very picky son even loved it and just a bonus that I was able to fill it with some extra veggies and protien for him :)

Great casserole! I did make a few changes due to family preferences. I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken, chicken stock instead of water and omitted the celery being I used the celery soup. I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and crumbled buttery crackers. YUM!

Really good recipe for Easter lunch.  I had everything except celery (which we don't like) and cream of chicken soup.  I used chicken enchilada soup that I had in the pantry (so I cut the water down by 1/4 cup) and it made such a great flavor.    I also always use dried minced onions because my family doesn't like the texture of cooked onions.

I made this recipe recently for my daughter's birthday. It was a huge hit! I loved it, my husband loved it, as did everyone at the party. I doubled the recipe and used one can of cream of mushroom and one of cream of onion along with the cream of chicken. I also used velveeta. I will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks!

I used one can of cheddar cheese soup and one can of broccoli chese soup instead of the cream of mushroom and cream of chicken. Entire family liked it much better... Just a variation depending on your taste.

This is very similar to the casserole that my grandmother had made for holiday meals and I made it her way. Only 2/3 cups water in the broccoli and do not drain. Omitted the cream of mushroom and used 2 cans cream of chicken soup mix. 2/3 cups milk in the soup/onion/celery/velveeta mix. Absolutely wonderful.

As is, pretty bland.  Thank goodness, I tasted it before I stuck it in the oven.  It needs ALOT of seasoning.  I added tons of salt, pepper and garlic.  Received a lot of compliments.  Next time, I'm going to consolidate steps .... used way too many pans!

Basically, I just followed the advice of Kristina (another reviewer) to the letter. Which means, I put the two soups in my baking dish and the cut-up Velveeta and let the oven melt the cheese. Then I stirred it together well. I omitted the celery but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter, mixing in the rice, onions (sauteed with salt and garlic for more flavor) and broccoli in my baking dish. It was SO much easier that way. Because some reviewers complained that it was bland (though Broccoli rice casserole isn't really known for its bold flavor!) I added in a lot of fresh cracked black pepper and some red pepper flakes in addition to salt. I also sprinkled cheddar cheese on the top. It turned out FANTASTIC! Everyone loved it, and I was a little bummed that I didn't have more leftovers because I loved it too! Will definitely make again. The addition of chicken sounds intriguing... Thanks for all the good tips y'all!

We didn't really care for this.  Maybe it would be better to use regular rice and cook it in chicken bouillon then add to the mixture, could also use some garlic for our taste.

Tried this for the second time tonight and still love it. I made my own adjustments and listened to the reviews adding for adding more flavor...added granulated garlic. I put 1/2 the amount of of cheese and as one reviewer I read had done I added subbed milk for water. I used cooked wild rice instead as well. I agree that cooking instructions are way too much work and it comes out just as good if you just throw everything together! Great side dish served with chicken!

The processed cheese, soups, and milk came together really well and did a great job complimenting the vegetables which I could distinguish in taste.  The rice added great texture.  I would describe this dish as a gooey meld of subtle flavors.

I made this last night with a couple of changes. First, I did what another reviewer had said- I cut the cheese into blocks and melted it with the cans of soup in a baking dish. I also used sharp cheddar and pepper jack cheese. I added a can of cheddar cheese soup to the cream of chicken and cream of mushroom mixture. I sautéed the onions, added the broccoli for a few minutes. I didn't have instant rice, so I boiled the rice I had for about 3 minutes in salt water. After the cheese and soup was melted, I added everything else and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes. I got great feedback! Thanks for this easy recipe.

This was quite good. I think what would have made it better was to add crushed butter crackers on the top and baked it that way. Also, to make it vegetarian, I think I will add a can of cream of celery soup instead of chicken. I didn't add celery, so that might be a good way to get it in there, regardless. Nice recipe! Hubby went back for seconds. :)

The key difference is to add parmesan cheese...WOW! I also used medium cheddar cheese.  No wonder so many people think this recipe is bland, american cheese and velveta are nasty and bland.  I used fresh broccoli since the store was out of frozen florets, and  I steamed it first, but should have steamed it longer because it was crunchy.  I used 2 bundles and that was to much broccoli.  I also used 1 can of cream of mushroom and chicken soup combo, and 1 cream of broccoli soup, 3 cups jasmin rice cooked in rice cooker, (makes more than 3 cups) and added diced chicken breast.  I cooked the chicken about have done in a skillet with garlic powder, white pepper and Tony's Seasoning. Cooking the chicken until done, and then cooking the casserole for 30 minutes would overcook and dry the chicken. I didn't use celery, added about a cup of milk instead of water, and sprinkled the top with italian bread crumbs. Don't forget the Tony's cajun seasoning mixed in the final casserole.  Delicious!  The 5 stars is for my version.

Tasted great and not bland at all. Substituted wild rice for instant, used a mixture of fresh steamed broccoli and cauliflower and added nutmeg and garlic to the cheese/soup sauce. Will make again.

My family wouldn't forgive me if I didn't make this for every holiday.  I use a small jar of cheez whiz instead of the chopped cheese, add fresh mushrooms and chopped water chestnuts for a crunchy texture.  Also, I only add 1/4 cup of water.  Use a food processor to roughly chop the celery and onions - makes it easier.

This is a great recipe.  You have to customize it to your taste in order for it to turn out right.  For instance, I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of American processed cheese.  I added seasoned chicken broth to both soups instead of water to give the dish some dimension.  Also, I sometimes add skinless dark meat chicken.  Everyone can't get enough of it.

I found this very bland, it needs a LOT more flavor.  It would be a good base or starting point but needs something added.  The unfortunate thing is now I have a LOT of this casserole and I don't really like it.  Hopefully my daughter will eat it for me!  UPDATE: My daughter really liked this casserole, and I found after two days in the fridge, I liked it a whole lot more myself.  I will probably make this again but experiment with flavorings.

This is a wonderful recipe to use for a crowed of people feeds plenty. and you can make it the night before and put in frig then take out of frig 1hr before cooking. thank you

I have been making this dish for years, we use to go to a restaurant here in Kansas City called Stephenson’s Apple Orchard, they called it Green Rice.  I use cream of celery soup instead of the cream of chicken and skim milk instead of water, I omit the butter and onion.  I mix all the ingredients together in a casserole dish, cover it and cook in microwave for and hour stirring every 15 minutes, you may need to cook longer if you need to, and you can also add more cheese depending on your taste, my family likes it cheesy.  This dish is requested at every family get together and is easy to make while you are finishing up last minute details and doesn’t take up room in the oven.

This was excellent. I decided to switch it up a bit by subbing one of the soups for broccoli cheese -- turned out great. I also added a little shredded cheese on the top for the last 3-4 minutes and let it brown a bit. An awesome recipe -- I was immediately asked to make it again (and I will)!

I was surprised, but this is really a very nice recipe.  I cut the recipe in half because there are just the two of us, and used leftover long grain rice from the previous night's dinner.  I used the cream of mushroom soup and some Kraft classic (mix of American and cheddar) grated cheese in a two cup bag. I topped the entire casserole with sliced tomatoes I was trying to use up.  The rice is creamy and tastes like an Italian risotto dish.  Easy, quick and flexible recipe.  Husband loved it!

I made a few changes due wanting to use the just using the stuff I already had on hand. Substituted cheddar cheese soup(campbells) for one of the soups, and added 2 cups of shredded cheddar instead of Velveeta. Added most of it into the casserole, just sprinkled a little on top. Also used regular rice that I had precooked, just added it into the soup mixture before throwing in the oven. Great recipe and a keeper!

There are problems with this recipe as written!!!!  Step #1...Watch the video.  You do not precook the rice....that is why it calls for the water. This is the reason some people had problems with the recipe.  I always substitute something else for water also.......milk, chicken broth....whatever.

I liked this recipe since I had a ton of fresh broccoli growing in my garden I needed to use. I did add garlic, shallots and milk. No fake cheese for us, only fresh cheddar. I made a cheese sauce like you might for au gratin potatoes and put panko crumbs on top. Tasty!

We used this recipe and really enjoyed it! I didn't use instant rice, but made my rice ahead of time in my rice cooker. I used block cheddar cheese instead of the processed stuff. *shudder* :) I was going to make my own cream of mushroom and chicken soup....but I'm very pregnant with my fifth and was too tired to do that, so I just cheated and bought the cans. :)

I will make it again, but next time I will use a sharp cheddar, some fresh garlic and green onion instead of yellow onion to add some additional flavor.  The casserole was creamy, but just needs a bit more of a kick, in my opinion.

I made this recipe tonight after work and my family adored it.  I have made BR casserole before and it came out very mushy, but this set up great.  Only alteration I made was to use only 3 stalks of celery and used an 8 oz pkg of velveeta plus 8 oz of cheddar cheese.  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

We're a bunch of fat people in the South and I'm pretty sure I've never used water in a casserole.  Sub 3/4 c half and half for it or heck, go for full on cream.  We all know this cass is best eaten with a spoon!  Merriest Christmas, MZ

the recipe was very easy, however, I found it to be a little bland.  I replaced the water when cooking my rice and broccoli (which I do together) with half chicken stock.  And I added grated cheese to the top with french fried onions

This is great!  I left out the celery and onion and just used onion powder and a little Cajun seasoning to add some kick and it was a huge hit.

A tasty comfort food, but next time I would add more cheese (regular grated cheddar would be fine). I left out the celery and my husband loved it. Any way I can get him to eat broccoli is a win!

Followed this recipe exactly. Seemed like a lot of rice to me. I don't see the need to cook the rice beforehand. That way it won't overcook in the casserole. What do you consider a bunch of celery, the whole thing? I didn't use all of it but about six stalks. I have made a similar recipe in the past but wanted to try this version. I didn't think it was that bland. Just use more pepper and perk up the cheese a little bit with something sharper. Probably a better flavor for kids if it is a little on the bland side.

Loved the recipe; it tasted fantastic!  I used cream of celery instead of freshly chopped celery.  Of course I added extra cheese!

It was really good but it is a little bit sloppy. Not to say it was bad my two year old ate it and loved it so did my wife. It is a lot of work. We ate it as a meal I know there is not any meat but it was worth it.

I'm pretty good in the kitchen. I knew it was alot of excess cooking with the oven so I changed it from casserole to  an much easier, faster dinner. I added grilled chicken chunks for celery and garlic instead of onion.  I added grilled chicken with garlic to the cheese and soup mixture, and then I added all the broccoli. It made a nice flavorful chicken, cheese, and broccoli sauce which we poured over rice. It was perfect! I never seen 6 kids clean their plates so fast.

Loved this as a side dish.  If you use celery salt and onion powder instead of the celery and onion then you don't have to bake it for 45 min.  I mix everything and baked it about 15 min. and it was still delicious!

I made it exactly as is (except celery, I don't like that in food), and I'm glad I did. Measurements were perfect, and I never thought of making this casserole with American cheese, PHENOMENAL. I take it to our weekly cookouts and (sadly) never have left overs.

This was pretty good, but i thought it needed some extra flavoring.  I halved this, put it in an 8x8 pan, and it almost overflowed, so it makes a ton!  I also added a shredded, cooked chicken breast.

This didn't taste like I expected.  It was good but maybe  I needed to use Velveeta cheese instead of American.

Yummy! I doubled the recipe to feed a crew of hungry men (15) who worked for my boyfriend. They loved it and went back for seconds. I followed the recipe, except for the water. I used milk instead.  I misread the recipe, and microwaved the cheese and milk till melted and smooth. Then I realized I am supposed to add the cream of soups. So, I added them last, after the cheese was melted. Didn't really affect it. :)   This is a keeper!

On the first try, yes it was a little bland, but a good basic recipe to play with. After following some reviews and making other adjustments for taste, this was wonderful. I used fresh broccoli cut into 1/2 inch - 3/4 inch pieces, not cooked. This made the broccoli more cooked than tender crisp, but not mushy in the resulting casserole. I used 2 cans cream of chicken soup (instead of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken)and added garlic powder, parsley, and pepper. I omitted the celery, butter, and replaced the onion with dried onion flakes. Then I tossed the raw broccoli with the hot rice and hot soup mixture, and placed in preheated oven for the full 45 min. My cheese-disliking, and broccoli-kinda-liking DH had seconds! That alone makes this a winner in my book. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for a party I attended last night. It was a hit. I was asked for the recipe by several people. 
I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding a beaten egg, to make it a little more firm or custard like.  I tempered the egg before adding it to the ingredients. Very, very good. Will be making this for one of my sides at Thanksgiving this year.

I made this for a family reunion, and was a little disappointed.  After reading the rave reviews I expected something awesome, and this wasn't it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very bland.  I wish I had added cheese topping of some kind -- shredded cheese, crushed crackers, etc.  I doubt if I'll make it again.

Very good -- I used fresh broccoli (steamed it but added to the dish while it was still a bit crispy) I also diced up two chicken breasts - sauteed them in olive oil and seasoned with lawry's seasoning salt before adding to the rest of the dish -- makes a "Meal-in-one-Wonder"!

I do love this recipe and someone always brings it to family functions.  However, I think that the celery and onion are too much and take away from the broccoli and cheese.  If you do add the onion, only use half of what is called for or you wil only taste onion.

This was terrific!  To save some time cooking on Christmas day, I prepared the dish the night before, with the exception of baking.  Then in the morning, all I had to do was pop it in the oven.  I also saved time by preparing the rice and broccoli in the microwave.

I've read all the reviews, all 400+, and decided to chime in with a couple of comments. I have made this casserole at various times for the past 3 years or so. It has always gotten rave reviews, regardless of what little "tweaking" I might've done to the recipe. There have been times I've needed something in a pinch and have been forced to use whatever was in my freezer and pantry. I've tried double mushroom soup, I've used cauliflower and broccoli, and I've experimented with the seasonings. Once, I even had to omit the celery because of a very picky eater. Bottom line is that I've never made what I considered a failure. Some of the end results were a little tastier than others, but the less tasty versions were still good, especially as a common side dish for the main courses of turkey or ham. Be creative and try things that are appealing to you. This recipe is very good as is or with modifications.

Thanks to the other reviews on this recipe I changed it up a little and it was great!  I halved the recipe and it still made a lot! I cooked the rice in chicken broth, deleted the celery, and didn't put in most of the water.  I think that I could have put in more water and it still would have been fine.  I also added some seasoning and it was really good. Thanks for all the suggestions!

Delicious!!! Took a little longer than what it says for prep time, but to see my man eat almost half of the entire casserole dish made it all worthwhile, Lol.  I did listen to some of the changes in regards to replacing the water to milk, and hearing that it could be bland I opted for Monterrey Jack cheese to give it that kick (also not a single grocery store here in Canada has cheese called "American processed Cheese", its unhealthy anyways to eat food that even has a label such as processed).  I also didn't go the lazy frozen route with the Broccoli, I got it fresh then steamed the vegetable - Yum Yummy!

Taste is good but amount of rice is overwhelming and overflows the 9x12 pan.  Will be using again but with much less rice.

This recipe made lots of this for our pot luck dinner.  Misread recipe and made 3 cups of uncooked rice.  Should have been 3 cups cooked rice.  Otherwise it was good.

Very thick cheese, next time maybe less velveeta and more shredded cheese. Kids loved it.

I combined all ingredients ( no melting beforehand) in microwaveable casserole dish with lid, and cooked on high for 15 minutes, stir and cook 10 minutes more. This is also good with chicken added. This is a military recipe passed around the wife's. Great for when the hubby calls to say he's bringing company for dinner.

This was really good. I didn't have cream of chicken, so I used 2 cans cream of mushroom, plus a chicken bullion cube.  Also used some American cheese instead of Velvetta.. No celery either. Added a dash of garlic powder. It turned out really good.  I agree with other reviewers: what do you expect? It's broccoli casserole and tastes like it!  Go to recipe when farmbox brings broccoli (again)!

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner, and my family loved it. I did make a few adjustments to the recipe after reading several other reviews: I used 3 cloves of garlic with an onion (omitted celery) and sautéd the frozen broccoli with the garlic/onions; I used 1 can of cream of broccoli and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom; I used 1 1/2 cups milk instead of water; and I only used half a block of Velveeta cheese and supplemented the remaining cheese with 1/2 cup Gruyere and 1/4 cup Parmesan. I began by sautéing the garlic/onion in some olive oil for about 5 min and then adding the frozen broccoli. I added about 1/4 cup of chicken stock to the pan and put a lid on for about 10 min to warm the broccoli through. In a separate pan I added the canned soups and milk, and once dissolved, I added the Velveeta. Once all of that was combined, I added it to the broccoli/garlic/onion mixture and added my three cups rice (I used brown rice that I cooked with some chicken stock and butter). I mixed in the Gruyere and Parmesan at the end and then baked everything at 350 for 45 minutes. The casserole came out great!

Great! I substituted two medium size fresh broccoli heads, and also used 1 cup regular brown rice (cooked 30 minutes for rice)., and subbed milk for water.  Very good recipe which can be modified

Good recipe. There were no leftovers on Thanksgiving. Because I don't like cream of mushroom soup, I substituted cream of celery soup. Also, I never use processed cheese in a recipe. Used shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Will top with Ritz crackers next time.

I actually made this recipe, i used 3 cups of uncooked jasmine rice, left out celery, added the chopped garlic.  substituted 1 can of chicken broth, used velveeta.... and i didn't cook the broccoli either.  baked it lightly covered with foil for about 2 hours, or until the rice was aldente, and took the foil off for 10 minutes to brown the top... it was sooooooo flipping amazing... !  yummie.

I fixed 2 cups of brown rice with 4 cups veggie broth instead of instant rice and used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and otherwise followed the ingredients and instructions (I used 3 large stalks of celery and thought that was a good amount). I did think the flavor was pretty mild, and might add in a little garlic powder and seasoned salt along with the pepper next time, but I really enjoyed the creamy texture of the cheese/soup mixture in this.

I used 2 cups of cooked rice and left out the instant rice and water. It sounded like a little too much cheese for my taste so I used only 8 ounces of shredded cheddar cheese instead. Also left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand.

Great!  Even my hubby, who doesn't like rice, asked for seconds.  Next time will finely chop the broccoli so it's easier for my toddler to eat.  I cut the recipe in half but accidentally added the original amount of water, and it still came out great.  Didn't saute the onion and celery, just tossed a little chopped onion in with the soup and omitted the celery.

Very yummy and the instant rice was a time saver, I added only half an onion because I didnt want so much, I used sandwich slices of cheese and it was wonderful and creamy.

Excellent dish...I do not cook the rice or broccoli..I use mix everything together and pour boiled water over the mix and pop into oven.  I used 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix instead of the onion and it added just the right amount of onion taste and saltiness.

Delicious! Great comfort food. Recipe should read 3 cups UNCOOKED rice. This overflowed my 13x9 pan. But really, really, really good!   I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes and garlic powder. And, instead of messing up two pans, I sauteed the onions and celery first THEN added the soup and cheese to the same pan to melt. It worked wonderfully.   Can't wait to make this again!

I steamed & chopped fresh broccoli & since I used brown rice instead of instant which changed the prep time quite a bit. I also changed the Velveeta cheese for a can of cheddar cheese soup & omitted all of the water since the rice was already ready when I combined it.  It came out great.

Very good.  Instead of frozen broccoli, I used fresh broccoli and steamed it first. I steamed it until I could bite through it, but still have some crunch, because it did get softer as it cooked in the oven.  There were alot of separate steps with this but it was worth it.  Husband and daughter loved it.

The reviews I have read on this recipe make absolutely no sense at all. It came out perfect for my fiance and I when we just made it for this Thanksgiving dinner and it was my first time making it. I think people are just too impatient and really don't know how to take the time to sit and read something. If you stir the cheese slowly into the soup and stir it until completely melted and then stir everything together for about a minute or so it is perfect. Learn how to measure!!! Everything comes out just as it should if u bought the right amount of the ingredients. This recipe is simple and great for those who like these kinds of dishes. Follow directions instead of just throwing it together however. That is what recipes are for .  They are meant to be followed.

Tasty but too heavy and mushy for my liking. My 15 month old loves it though!

Delicious! I used a mix of sharp and mild cheddar and added more than what the recipe called for.  Also, I only added 1 c of water and 1/2 c of milk to make extra creamy and I used Liptons french onion soup mix to add flavor to the cream mixture.  Great dish and not hard to make.  Next time I'll use half broccoli and half cauliflower.

I have been looking for a good broccoli rice casserole for awhile and this is the best one I've found.  I add cooked cubed chicken and shredded sharp Cheddar cheese to mine to make it a meal. The one thing I didn't like was using too many pans to prepare this dish.

I have been making this for years! It is always a hit. You can play with this one too.
I have subbed spinach for the broc. I also have added ham (cut in to cubes) Also used chicken in here before. I added meatballs to it once (make sure to drain oil!)
great recipe

I changed this a little by using a package of Lipton Creamy Rice Mix prepared as directed on package. Sprayed bottom of 13x9 ceramic dish with olive oil spray and layered the rice mixture, cooked broccoli spears (large frozen bag 22oz, boiled 5 mintues and drained). Topped with a large can of cream of chicken soup, shredded cheddar chesse I had on hand (about 8 oz) and topped with the buttered crackers.  Baked 30 min at 350.   Added no salt as the rice mix is already seasoned..... it was GREAT! Thanks for the idea!!

I left out the celery (I don't like celery) and used only Cream of Chicken soup (because boyfriend doesn't like mushrooms). I thought it was a little bland, so I added extra cheese and then it was perfect.

Just put this in the oven and  i couldn't help but try  more than one "sample". Terrific! I know it will be well received at the Thanksgiving feast I'm about to attend. There are vegetarians among us, so I substituted cream of celery soup for cream of chicken and also cream of broccoli for the cream of mushroom since some guests dislike mushrooms in any form. Also used shredded sharp cheddar in lieu of american - so much better. Turned out extra tasty!  Expecting raves and no leftovers here! Thanks for the recipe.

This was a very tasty recipe, my dinner guests all thought it was very good. This recipe DOES make a large amount. Since the only meat we eat is fish - I substituted 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken soup. I also used and extra 3/4 cup of rice which made the casserole a nice, thicker consistency. Leftovers the next day were almost even better!

A GREAT recipe for pot lucks!I add cooked chicken;use chicken broth to prepare the rice;put everything in the crock of my crock pot and bake in the oven until browned on top.Then put the crock back in the base and set on "low" to keep everything warm.I always get lots of compliments and everything is eaten up, even if I double the recipe!

This was a very good casserole that I brought to Thanksgiving dinner at the relatives.  I did not cook the brocolli first, because chopped brocolli cooks very quickly.  I read a few other reviews about how the casserole lacked "pizazz".  It's brocolli, I don't expect it to have pizazz, but I like it to be cheesy :)  I added shredded cheddar cheese to the top in the last 10 minutes of cooking, and it was wonderfully, deliciously cheesy.  Everyone ate it and liked it, so I'm assuming it was a hit!

I am certainly glad I didn't read any reviews that stated this dish was bland before I made it. I come from a family who LOVES spices and I was very leary to make a dish with none and I did. Eveyone loved it. I thought it was watery but it bakes down to goodness!! My family and my in-laws loved it! (Also, it makes A LOT...I seperated into two casserole dishes and took one to each family. I also garnished with a little cheddar cheese and breadcrumbs! ENJOY!

This is one of the best Broccoli Rice Casseroles ever!!! If you happen to have any leftovers, be sure to heat them in the oven, otherwise it will not be creamy.

Made this for Christmas dinner yesterday.  It was quite good.  When I first put it together, I thought it was going to be way too watery since the rice had already been cooked but when baked for 45 mins, it turned out fine (solid).  I don't think I can say it is the best Broccoli Casserole I have ever eaten (mostly because I think mine is)but I will definitely fix this recipe again.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it an 8.

I read some of the reviews on this and was a little relunctant to try.  I made it last night and it's fabulous!  I cooked the rice with chicken boillion cubes and used the spicy cheez whiz instead of the regular.  Because I'm not a big fan of celery, I also substituted cream of celery soup for the cream of chicken and omitted the bunch of celery.  It's wonderful.

I SERVED THIS AT OUR COUNTY CLUB.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!  SOME ASKED FOR THE RECIPE.  SEVERAL  HATED BROCCOLI, BUT LOVED THIS!  MY KIDS EVEN LIKED IT.  I USED THE RECIPE TIMES 4 & IT WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO SERVE TO 55 PEOPLE WE HAD.  

IT IS EASY TO FIX.  I USED A 16 OUNCE JAR OF CHEESE WHIZ INTEAD OF THE CHEESE THE RECIPE CALLED FOR.  IT WAS FASTER TO MELT & TASTED GREAT.  

THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!!  I WILL BE USING IT AGAIN.

Delicious. My completed dish in the 9x13 bubbled over in the oven so I had to transfer it to a larger baking dish. We all enjoyed this recipe  and I will make this again. My mother in law asked me for the recipe. Yes!!

I disagree with the common reviewer comment that this casserole should be bland because it's broccoli rice casserole and that you can fix the blandness with a little salt, garlic, etc.  I used sharp cheddar, milk, and additional spices, but for me the blandness came from the ratio of broccoli and cheese to rice.  When I eat this casserole, I want to taste 2 things: broccoli and cheese.  There is so much rice that you can barely even find the broccoli! Now it does taste like a yummy creamy casserole as written, just not the broccoli casserole of my dreams.  Next time I make this, I am going to double the broccoli, use 1.5-2 times the cheese, and use 1/2 the rice and liquid (milk in my case).  Maybe it will be overkill but I will definitely taste the flavors I require. :)  **Update** Yes, this worked wonderfully with half the rice!!  The other ingredients are flexible; I even added 2 chicken breasts (shredded) for a one-dish meal.

I tried this recipe  for Thanksgiving about  6 years ago and now my family asks for it every year as part of our traditional Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loves it, including the kids.  I do add some seasoned salt, but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly as written. I usually assemble it the night before,  refrigerate it overnight and then just bake it the next day.

This was absolutely AMAZING! Seriously, restaurant-style good. I did make a few small changes, however. One--I do not like mushrooms, so I used cream of broccoli soup instead. I was worried that doing that may have made it too broccoli-ish, but it really didn't at all. Also, I did not use that much cheese because that's just so unhealthy, haha. I used about half that amount and that was perfect. Truly, the whole thing came out beautifully. Definitely became a staple in our house!

i added chili powder and paprika (just a sprinkle) as well as crushed garlic and a bit of olive oil to my onion & celery mixture. it gave it the extra kick it needed so it wasnt bland at all (as others have noted). Aside from being an extremely high calorie meal/side dish, this recipe is delicious, easy and not too time consuming. It took me about 30 minutes to prep everything and then another 35-45 in the oven. and you spend that 35-45 washing the dishes you used to prep so before you know it your food is done.

Pretty good.  I made it with sharp cheddar, rather than Velveeta to create a richer taste.  I would have used celery, but ours had gone bad.  Husband loved it.  I will make this again.

Good "base" recipe I did make a few of my own additions that made this amazing!! I cut the recipe in half and had a good sized casserole. I added a minced garlic clove and 2-3 diced jalapeno slices to the celery and onion. Then a little bit of the jarred jalapeno juice to the cheese and soup mixture. Used 1/2 frozen and half fresh broccoli. I would have used all fresh but did not have enough. I also used half of the cheese it recommended. Casserole was very very good!! Will definitely make again, especially for gatherings b/c it's so easy to throw together and refrigerate until ready.

Great staple recipe as is. To add flavor i used block of pepper jack cheese, reducing velveeta to 1/3 block, and cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic soup. Increased broccoli to two 16 oz bags, with 3 cups (cooked, not raw!) instant rice. We prefer broccoli to rice, but if you don't, reverse it (less broccoli, 4-6 cups cooked rice).

As with any recipe, you must tweek it according to your preference.  If it's too watery the first time, or too bland, cook it again with less water, but add heavy cream.  Use cayenne, parsley, onion powder, cilantro and a dash of thyme. Yummy, Mommy.

We didn't have processed cheese, but block cheddar worked just as well.  Just be careful to stir frequently and watch the pot.  The taste was even better the following day!

We hadn't eaten this casserole in years when I saw this one on your site.  I made a few minor changes (milk instead of water, some jalapenos and a touch of garlic).  Excellent and tasty dish.  Thanx!
This site is just the best due to all the reviews from "regular" folks cooking in their kitchens.

Added 3 sauteed boneless chicken breasts (cut into bite sized pieces). Substituted a mix of brown & wild rice and it was wonderful. This adds a significant amount of prep time but if you know you will be making this recipe the rice can be made a day ahead and stored in the fridge.

Fixed this for church lunch today. Prepared it yesterday and baked it today. Yummy. (Used whole grain rice instead of white and it worked fine.) None left in my casserole dish so I am hopeful that everyone who got a spoonful enjoyed it as much as I did.

I really love this recipe.  I add a pound of boiled, pulled chicken, and use 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery, mixing with milk instead of water.  Also use fresh brocolli rather than frozen, but I don't precook it.  I chop it up very fine.  Then saute the onion and celery in some garlic olive oil instead of butter.  It makes for a lovely entree casserole rather than a side dish.

This recipe is delicious!  I shredded a block of sharp cheddar cheese instead of the Velveeta (I don't like Velveeta).  Will definitely make again.  I will add fresh mushrooms the next time.

My while family loved this recipe.  I did make a couple little changes:  I used fresh broccoli, no cream of chicken soup, 1 c. milk, used real cheese (i can't stand processed stuff), and used previously cooked rice.  I always make a big batch of rice and then freeze portions to make different dishes, it works out great.  This will always be in my recipe box.

This is wonderful...BUT, I can never remember each time I've made it whether I've used 3 cups COOKED instant rice or 3 cups instant rice (which would be measured into an equal amount of water, thus producing 6 cups COOKED rice, which is an awful lot of rice). I'm getting more forgetful lol and I get rave reviews for this dish, but I hate that I don't write down how I do the rice! From other recipes, it looks like, given equal portions of other ingredients, they would use 3 cups of COOKED rice. The only other thing I do differently is I cook the broccoli in the microwave with no added liquid (frozen broc. makes its own liquid) and I reduce the amount of liquid added to the soup sauce by a little; then I mix everything in my largest possible sauce pan, stirring everything to make sure the velveeta melts. I add garlic powder and onion powder and let that stand awhile. Then I place that in my large metal lasagne pan slightly greased and top with grated sharp cheddar cheese and bake uncovered for 45 minutes.  My husband LOVED this!

Great! I made some modifications though. I made this a one dish meal and added 2 chicken breasts which I baked first and seasoned with pepper and garlic powder, then diced. I halved the recipe, used fresh broccoli, one can cream of chicken, no processed cheese and subbed real shredded cheddar, still used 1 onion, no celery. I boiled the broccoli until it was tender and to make everything easier, just tossed that, the sautéed onion, rice, soup, water, cheese, salt and pepper and chicken in a bowl and mixed well. Then I melted some butter and mixed in Panko breadcrumbs to make a crunchy topping and sprinkled it over the top once it was in the casserole dish. This was spectacular!

I am so Glad I found this recipe. Made it tonight for dinner. This recipe is my MIL"signature" dish. she brings it to every pot luck or BBQ. My kids love it and she won't give out the recipe. This is it. I left out the celery because I wanted it to be just like hers and she doesn't use it. Now I can make it anytime. thank you for a great recipe.

I don't know what some of you people are talking about.  A lot of people said this was bland, but common sense should tell you that you will need to use salt and pepper, as broccoli and rice tend to be quite bland without it, especially in large quanities.  This recipe is the best broccoli rice casserole I have tasted.  I used 3/4 cups of milk instead of water and it turned out perfect.  I also did not use the celery.

This was ok. I followed the reviewers suggestion of putting milk, cream of mushroom & cream of chicken, and cubed velveeta into oven to melt so that was a wonderful tip. I also added 1 tbsp of curry. Needed a bit more salt but I used Healthy Request soups. The reason for the 3 stars was for my personal tastes, broccoli was too mushy and I did NOT precook! It was edible and might try again using fresh, barely steamed broccoli.

I didn't read any of the reviews before I made this, but I also didn't notice the water but i mixed the soups on the stove with almost the same amount of milk and used real cheddar because that processed stuff isn't allowed in my kitchen.  It turned out good and almost all of it was devoured much to my disappointment for leftovers.  Still seems it was missing something will play with it next time.  Maybe a sharper cheddar will help.

for those who claim this is a bland recipe, try replacing about 1/3 C of the liquid with cooking sherry.  Really adds to the flavor.  Otherwise, the recipe is just fine.

great traditional recipe. i didnt use instant rice but regular rice, not sure why it calls for instant. i cooked 3 cups of reg. uncle bens rice and i eliminated about 2 cups for i felt it was too much rice. and i accidenlty use only about 3/4c of water.  dish was still good, i think i did miss the water for it was thicker than it should have been but flavor was great. i WILL make this again and keep in mind this makes a large dish.

Broccoil & casserole is always a good dish and great for vegetarians like myself! I did alter the recipe a bit by using milk instead of water, adding garlic powder and sauteed portabella mushrooms. Like one of the other reviewers, I cut the cheese into little cubes and dispersed them throughout the dish. Yum, yum, yummy!

Made this with my Easter ham...great tasting!  Was a big hit with the family and a plentiful side dish.  Prepared rice ahead of time and set aside.  Let large bag of broccoli thaw on cabinet top.  Later everything went together in a snap!  Will definitely make again!

I don't understand the negative reviews.. I did have to half the cheese and I actually forgot to put salt and pepper and it still tasted fine. I added water chestnuts too. We really enjoyed this dish, and the flavor was spot on. (mine coulda used a lil salt tho) ;-)

Love this recipe. We use the jar of Cheese Whiz instead of the block of Velveeta. So much more cheesier. Warm it in the jar and then mix in. Delicious!

I brought this to a potluck at my work.  Personally, I did not care for it.  However, several people told me that it was good, and three asked to take home the leftovers to eat later that night, and I take that as a pretty good thing.

I must say I was worried when reading reviews about it being bland, but this was great! I changed only two things. I used milk instead of water and used Velveeta cheese. Is also good with cauliflower! I will be making this again soon.

I had chicken rice that I had left over from the night before. (White rice cooked in chicken soup broth and a box of Rice-r-Roni chicken rice mixed in for color/flavor). Had broccoli, one can of mushroom soup, and Velveeta, butter, and onions.  No celery. Went looking for a recipe and found this one. What a great find!  The rice mixture from the night before had a lot of pleasant spices in it, so didn't season it more than pepper.  I certainly reduced the Velveeta as my version didn't look anywhere near as cheesey as the pic on this one. (I eyeball ingredients when I cook, not follow recipes to a "T"). Now the secret ingredient made all the difference in the world!  I sprinkled a thin layer of Durkee's fried onions on the top for flavor/texture.  Served this at Easter. 15 guests and family members went NUTS for this recipe and I've made it several times since then on request from family members and guests.  Remember to use the recipe as a foundation, then go from there. No need to complain about it being bland or whatever else. Kick it up with your own variations! Great recipe for that! Five stars for sure!

I followed Kristina's advice- Cut the velveeta into chunks and place them in a casserole dish.  Pour in the two cans of soup and 3/4 c. milk. Put the casserole dish in the oven at 350 and let the cheese melt. When cheese is melted, remove from oven, well and add the rice, broccoli, and chopped onion. I omitted the celery. I cooked it for about 30 minutes on 350.

This is bland as can be. This is one instamce where you can really taste the condensed soups unless you add in enough spice. Add in 1/2 tsp each of the following: garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, mustard powder in addition to colby/monterey cheese and milk.

Yummy! It seems like the kind of dish you bring to a potluck. It makes a whole lot! I can see where some of the reviewers have said it's bland. I'm ok with that. It's a cheesy, creamy side dish. Add some salt, pepper, and cover with a cup of cheddar. What more do you need?

I followed this recipe and added garlic powder and a little cayenne pepper to the onions and celery while they were cooking, and added a thin layer of buttered bread crumbs to the top midway through baking and it turned out just fine.

This is an excellent, creamy, cheesy and all around delish side dish!  I made this because my husband's mom always makes one at Thanksgiving and I was trying to duplicate hers...he loved it!  I used milk instead of water and used what I THINK is the Australian equivalent to Velveeta cheese!  Be sure to add plenty of salt and pepper for seasoning!

I used this recipe for a reference. I wanted to make a casserole using chicken, broccoli and rice but I had some other ideas as well. The overall ingredients, flavor and consistency of this recipe in particular are great. I just added a few of my own touches to use up some produce.

I made a few changes here....used left over cooked white rice from last nights Chinese take-out(great way to use it up), I made my own cream o'soup, used some milk instead of water, eliminated the celery, and used real shredded cheddar. I also topped the casserole with crushed buttery crackers. This was very good and like I said a great way to use up leftover rice. Kiddos liked it too...will make again.

This was very good!!  I halved this recipe and it turned out just great.  I made a couple little changes, I put the broccoli in raw, no need to pre-cook as it cooks while in the oven, also I topped the dish with grated cheddar cheese.   I will make this again!  Thanks

This was delicious. I couldnt find the amer chz cubes at the store so I had to buy the sliced sandwich chz.  I just folded it up and made cubes that way.  Im not really sure if it matters if they are cubes anyway.  I added the salt & pepper in with the soup as i was cooking it.  It made it easier than having to stir it in with everything else.  I aslo added a handful of shredded cheddar chz to give it more flavor.  I will definately be making this one again.

Very good. I used low fat Velveeta and low fat soups. I also added in diced, cooked, chicken to make it a meal. It was simple, creamy and rich. A good "home style" dinner.

My family is really not "Casserole" but I told them this was just plain broccoli and rice and it worked!

I made for 5 servings, using 3 cups cooked white rice, 1 1/2 tbl butter, sauted half an onion and 2 stalks of celery.  Used 1 bag of frozen broccoli, partially cooked.  Then put into pan with onion and celery.  1 can of cream of chicken, healthy request soup, with 1/2 can milk, and 8 oz of velveeta.  Mixed all together in a smaller than 13x9 pan and cooked following directions.  Last 10 minutes added some shredded cheddar on top.  I thik this came out great and everyone had seconds and there is STILL some for tonight~!

This is a great and simple recipe. However I did make a few changes.Instead of mushroom soup,I used broccoli cheese condensed soup. In addition to the velveeta cheese in the recipe, I also used about a 1/2 cup to a 1 cup of shredded blended cheeses and seasoned to taste while the cheeses were melting - came out Glorious!!!

VERY GOOD! Left out the celery - added a 1/2 jar of cheez whiz to the 16 oz. of velveeta (reviews said - may need more cheese). Left everything else the same & it was SUPER. Thanks for sharing!

Several changes, but I think the original intent of the recipe is still "there."  I used brown long-grain rice instead of instant white.  I used 1 cup of raw rice because the package said it would yield 3.5 cups cooked; the finished casserole was more like a soup (albeit a DELISH soup!), so next time I'll up the raw rice to 1.5-2 cups.  I cooked the rice seperately and then mixed everything together in the casserole dish (no pre-cooking of the broccoli or the cheese / soups / milk mixture).  I did not have any fresh veggies on hand, so I used cream of celery in place of the cream of mushroom, and mixed in about 1.5 tablespoons of dried minced onion.  I split the casserole into two 8x8-inch pans, baked both, and put one in the freezer for later use.  I know it's generally advised not to freeze recipes with cream soups, but I went for it anyway -- I hope it turns out OK because my boyfriend and I both thought this was AWESOME!!  I will make again.  (By the way...I added about 8 oz grilled chicken strips.)  This was an easy weeknight meal, and it TOTALLY hit the spot.  UPDATE:  The frozen casserole defrosted and cooked up just fine!

I have made this for years and what I found was that if you like a little heat use cheese whiz instead of the cheese recipe calls for. Hot or salsa style which ever you find. I cant tell you what a kick it gives this dish it is addictive sooooo I only make it on Holidays soooo im glad its time lol

Holy Cow, was this incredible!  My 2.5 year old daughter LOVED this, but even more of a miracle is that I did, too!  I'm not a fan of brocolli, but I'll eat it so that she won't end up a picky eater like me, but I LOVED this!  She asked for more twice, and I even had a second helping.  Followed the recipe almost exactly, but left out the celery (didn't have any).  Will try adding chicken next time, as suggested by another reviewer.  I think I'll make this for a potluck next weekend because I know it's going to be a huge hit!

I'm so happy to find this recipe as it truly brings home a delicious restaurant favorite.  I halved the recipe using campbell's 'creamy chicken mushroom soup' in place of the two that are called for in the recipe.  Also, I used chicken broth where the recipe called for water and then eliminated the additional salt.  Decided to put 1 1/2 cups of cheese though in my halved recipe.  I used one fresh brocoli floret, just one stalk of celery, and a med onion.  Will hang on to this recipe.  No need to keep searching.  Thanks for the recipe and to all who take the time to share suggestions after cooking.

Very good recipe! Everyone loved, but what I did was cut the onion down dramamtically as well as the celery. I did about three stalks of celery and 1/4 a cup of chopped onions..Worked out really well

Fabulous recipe. Three adults ate 2/3 of a 9x13 pan (and it was only a side dish!) A couple changes I made: I didn't have celery, so I left it out. I used brown rice (two bags --4 cups-- of the frozen brown rice from Trader Joes, and I cooked it as directed first) and substituted 12 oz. sharp cheddar cheese for the processed american cheese. I reserved the water that the broccoli was cooked in and used it as the water called for in the recipe (lots of nutrients!)Finally, I topped it with Trader Joes Fried Onion Pieces 10 minutes before it came out of the oven. The crunch was necessary and really, really good! You could easily add chicken or turkey and have a one dish meal. Definitely a keeper; thanks SO much for sharing!

YUMMY! I follow most of the recipe, however I subbed cream of celery for the cream of mushroom and I added some cajun seasoning. I thought the Velveeta would make it too cheesy but it didn't. THANKS!

I halved this recipe.  Since I didn't want to use half cans of soup, I just cooked my rice in chicken broth and used 1 can cream of mushroom soup. We didn't care for it, but the recipe itself was good.

I brought this dish with me to a dinner party and it turned out great.  Like others, I made some modifications.  Instead of white rice I cooked brown rice in chicken broth so that it would have more flavor.  I used 1 can of low-fat cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of low-fat cream of broccoli soup.  I also chopped up my own fresh broccoli and added it to the soup/cheese mixture without cooking so that the broccoli had "bite" and wasn't so mushy.  I used low-fat shredded cheddar cheese, adding about 1 cup to the soup and another cup on top of the dish before baking.  Finally, I crushed up some whole wheat saltine crackers and sauted them in some margerine and added it to the top of the dish.  I omitted the celery.  I covered the dish with foil for the first half hour of cooking, then removed the foil for the other 15 minutes.  I found that I didn't need to add salt/pepper.  No one could even tell that it was a "low-fat, healthy" dish.  Thanks for the great recipe to start with!

great recipe! i didn't use celery bc i didn't have any.  i made jasmine rice bc we dont have instant rice (be sure to cook it with a little less water than usual bc once you add the cheese/soup mixture, the rice will expand a bit). this was a fantastic side.  will make it time and time again.

This is one casserole that never fails. I made it a few years back and lost the recipe. I was happy to find it again and made it this past weekend for a Christmas party. The only change I make is that I add a touch of minced garlic to the onions and celery when sauteing. The adults enjoyed it and the children flipped for it. My young stepson would have eaten the whole dish if I hadn't stopped him!

Made a few changes, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I enjoyed it, however, the other half didn't care for it.  I ended up eating it for a week, so I didn't mind.

I liked this a lot, so did my husband.  However, I did make a few changes.  I don't like instant rice, so I used Uncle Ben's and boiled it ahead of time.  Also, I used cheddar cheese instead of american and I left out the celery.

I love this recipe... it's my idea of comfort food. I've made it several different ways, depending on what I had in the refrigerator. Most recently I made it with cooked fresh broccoli instead of frozen, used 2 cans low fat, low salt mushroom soup and decreased the cheese to 8 oz. (I used cheddar). It was great and no one seemed to notice the difference. I've also made it w/o broccoli, just celery, onion and some sliced, steamed baby carrots for color... very good, too! Thanks Gina for a keeper!

Use VELVEETA cheese unless you just simply don't like the taste of it. When a recipe calls for 'processed' cheese, use VELVEETA. This recipe is a big hit, so give it a try :)

Excellent! Took it to a carry-in dinner at church and everyone loved it. This is the same recipe my husband's aunt use to make every Christmas. I never had it just right, until now. I did change a few things after reading the reviews. I used milk instead of water and I only used two cups. I also omitted the celery. I would also suggest not putting all of this into a 9 x 13 dish as it was to much and ran over a bit. Try putting about 4 cups in a smaller baking dish and the rest into the 9 x 13. Won't be as messy in the stove. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful comfort food recipe!

This was very tasty, but I'm going to leave the water out next time I make it.  It was very soupy and I had to cook it a lot longer than called for.  This would also help the recipe to fit into the dish.  By the time the water cooked out of mine the baking dish was only half full.  I also used two cans of cream of mushroom soup b/c I'm a vegetarian and it was delicious.

Good broccoli rice recipe.  I used the Tex-Mex velveeta as suggested by others and cooked my rice with chicken bouillon (but still added the salt, which was a mistake as made it just a little too salty). I used 3 (10 oz) boxes of chopped broccoli which gave it just the right consistency.  (Otherwise would have been too "soupy".)  I only used about 5 stalks of celery, which was plenty in my opinion.  The only thing I would do different next time would be to add some chopped up ham or maybe some extra shredded cheddar cheese on top.  Thanks so much!

The sauce was too runny and it didn't taste cheesy enough. I don't think I used enough rice. My boyfriend really liked this; he's been eating the leftovers for days!

We loved this recipe! We had my in-laws over
for dinner and served this with roast chicken.
I had never tried the recipe, so I was a little
nervous, but found that I had no worries...it's
delicious and easy, and a definite crowd-pleaser!

After sorting thru every broccoli and cheese recipe and reading all reviews I made this one. Every review was spot on. I used a 32 oz bag of broccoli thawed...not cooked tho...added a green pepper, mushrooms, and several of each color red orange and yellow mini peppers. Used brown rice and healthy choice/reduced fat soups (had to make it as diabetic friendly as possible). Cooked the veggies in olive oil not butter. It was runny going in but came out perfect. Made the 9x13 inch pan and one the size of a pie pan full. Will definitely make again. So yummy. Oh and yes def add some garlic or whatever your taste buds desire.

My family loved this. I omitted the onions because my husband doesn't like them but put onion powder in along with salt and pepper. I also did not have processed cheese so I used medium cheddar and used fresh broccoli. Turned out very good, will definitely make again.

DELICIOUS!! I couldn't stop eating it.  For anyone who felt it was bland, heat the 1 and 1/4 cups water this recipe called for and then dissolve 1 or 2 vegetable bouillon cubes in the hot water. So very tasty!!

This is a great dish. I brought it to my office and it was demolished in a few hours. It does make a lot, so be prepared to feed many. 

Opt for milk instead of broth, and go with about half what is called for. I also seasoned my rice with Landry's seasoned salt, and substituted Velveeta for the American cheese. One of the commenters made a great point: this is an empty canvas. It's up to you to make it great.

I love broccoli so this was a priority! Although I skipped the cooking on the stove steps, the onion and celery and just threw everything else together in a 9x13 dish. Put the rice, soup and water in first and stirred it well then added in broccoli, cheese, seasonings and also chicken then popped it in the over for about an hour and it is amazing! Minus the fact that I let it cook a bit too long and the rice is super chewy, it is definitely something I'll make regularly!

I did try this recipe,  but used it as a base. I only had one can of condensed soup so I made thickener with butter flour and milk added some chicken stock some basic spices and added some cheddar mixed with the one can of condensed soup, i also added about 2oz of cream cheese that i had on hand, mized in with the rice and broccoli. I also topped mine with cheese and buttered bread crumbs, it was delicious and flavorful. I guess i didnt really use the recipe at all but it just goes to show you that items can be substituted and altered, for the same or an even  better result! Enjoy!

Thanks to the other cooks who shared a few tips like adding milk instead of water and those who mentioned that the dish was on the bland side, I decided to add my own magic to it.  I mixed the soup, and cubed cheese with salt, pepper, thyme and baked it in the oven until the cheese was melted. I then mixed in shredded cheese and allowed that to melt in the oven for about 2 minutes. I melted the butter, onions and added the broccoli. After the veggies were warmed up I seasoned the broccoli with salt, pepper, adobo, season salt, creole spice. In the last 5mns of baking time I mixed chicken stuffing, rits crackers and melted butter and sprinkled that across for a little crunchy texture.  It was a huge hit with both my family and a houseful of kids.

Great recipe.  Our family does not like mushrooms so only used cream of chicken soup.  Also, we used yellow rice instead of white.

I cut the recipe in half.  Used 10oz chopped spinach instead, one can chicken soup instead of wasting a half can of each, and grated cheddar.  I added a little more water to make the sauce a little thinner. All else was the same.  While in the oven, I browned six spinach asiago chicken sausages.   Served two browned sausage links on top of a serving of casserole.  It was out-of-this-world delicious!

We left out the 1-1/4 cups of water and added 2 cans of rotel. We used 1/2 the velvet cheese in the soup mixture and cubed the other half and put it on top of the casserole.  Very good.

It was fabulous! I can´t say that I followed the directions to the letter but the changes I made were because I didn´t have all of the ingredients or I wanted to make things easier. I didn´t use celery. I steamed fresh broccoli. I only used 1 cup of uncooked rice therefore the liquid is necessary but I used milk instead of water. Shredded cheese on top and not melted with soups (didn´t heat soups). Seasoned salt, black pepper, paprika, and the onions cooked in butter is vital. Baked covered for a while and then I uncovered, added cheese, and baked for about 15 additional minutes. Good stuff!

This recipe was absolutely delicious, everyone at the party loved it, wanted the recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of water, and used the cream of chicken soup with herbs and cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic (from Campbell's). Put ALOT of pepper, not to where it made it spicy, but just delicious.  I didn't cook the broccoli beforehand, I just added the frozen broccoli when I mixed everything all up at the end, just before putting it all in the oven to bake.  That way, it doesn't get so mushy and overcooked.  Everything else I did just like the recipe says, and it's superb!

I made the recipe as directed except for the instant rice part...I just cooked regular long grain rice in a pot...I disagree with another review that said it was a waste of time to melt the cheese in with the soup before mixing with the broccoli and rice...it perfectly blended everything..I also used a little milk instead of the water...over all a yummy recipe my family loved.

I compleatly destroyed this recipe due to the fact I wanted to use up some leftovers, but it turned out so good. I used two heads of fresh broccoli and alittle over a cup of leftover rice. I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I just used one can of cream of mushroom with a can of milk added. To that I added a bowl full (about 1 cup) of leftover rotel cheese dip (I only used a little over 1/2 of the mixture as it was to much). Added garlic salt, pepper, and minced onion to taste. Then I added a little over a cup of leftover taco meat to it all. Put it in a 8 x 8 glass dish and put 4 slices of american cheese on top, baked @ 350 for 30 min. It turned out very flavorful and creamy cheesey. Thank you for the basic recipe.

Super cheesy and delicious!  My whole family is sick and we felt very comforted by this wholesomely good recipe.  I used real uncooked rice (not instant).  I cooked it in my rice steamer first.  I also used a regular 16 oz block of cheese (cubed it myself).  I only used 16oz of frozen broccoli.  I did use a whole stalk of celery and that was fantastic.

This was a good recipe to start with.  I did make a few changes. I used one cup of white rice and two cups of Uncle Ben's wild rice (microwaveable package) which brings a lot more flavor to the dish. I completely omitted the celery and onion. I've made this a couple of times and found that it doesn't matter if you use milk or water it still comes out great! Finally, a 16oz package of American cheese slices works just as well. Just add a few at a time to the soup mixture.

Honestly.. I had to change this recipe completely. I used fresh broccoli stead of frozen. I used 1 cup of parboiled rice stead of 3. I chose to use make a white sauce of flour,butter,milk, salt and pepper and red pepper flakes.

Before making the white sauce, I sauteed bacon and onions and 2 gloves of minced garlic to add flavor. 

I then added the cheese to the whole mixture and baked for half an hour at 375 degrees.

Good comfort food but kinda bland for my taste. I will probably make it again and add seasoned salt for some more flavor.

I thought this was really good!  I'm not a fan of celery (at all!) but it added a really good flavor to the rice.  Next time I might make it a little less creamy, but other than that it was delicious!

I was surprised at how this actually is.  I made with the kids in mind, but my husband and I loved it as well.  I used cheddar and monteray jack cheese because that is what I had.  Yum.

Wonderful, healthy, simple recipe that my dinner guests loved.    I used cream of chicken soup rather than cream of mushroom soup because I like the flavor better. I ommitted the celery.  Subsituted the american cheese for shredded mild cheddar cheese which I spread only on top which allowed the cheese to melt to a delicious chewy texture.  Lastly, I highly recommend the Uncle Ben's rice pakets that heat up in 90 seconds in the microwave.  I used three of them in this recipe.

This was a crowd pleaser at my last family get together and received rave reviews.     I sauteed onion, celery (used about 3 stalks)and green pepper (to kick it up a notch)in butter with a little garlic while cooking the rice and put the frozen broccoli in a strainer in the sink; you might need to run a little cold water over the broccoli before adding it to the baking dish..next, combined the soups with chicken broth (instead of water) right in the baking dish and added the cubed cheese (used Velveeta instead of American)to the soup ...then put the soup/cheese mixture in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes to soften the cheese ... stirred the melted cheese into the soup after taking it out of the oven....then lastly, I added the sauteed onion/celery; cooked rice and thawed broccoli to the soup/cheese mixture.  Some folks claimed this was bland or that the cream of chicken soup overran the other flavors...but I thought it had full flavor.  MMMMM !!!!!

I made this once for myself and then again later for a Christmas party. The changes I made between the 1st and 2nd times really made the dish. The 1st time, all I could taste was the cream of chicken soup. It really overpowered the whole thing, and it wasn't cheesy enough. So the next time I made it, I substituted a can of cream of celery for the cream of chicken, used 1 1/4 c chicken broth instead of water, and a few handfuls of shredded cheddar jack cheese. Everyone at the party loved it.

This tasted better than I thought it would because some people kept saying it was bland. This is how it is supposed to taste. This is way better than any Broccoli Rice Casserole I have had at a potluck. Thanks for the great recipe. The only thing I changed is I added some cut up chicken to make it more of a meal.

This was just ok. It was bland, tasting mostly like velveeta and not much else. I've certainly had better and will try a different recipe for this next time. But, if you can't get enough of Velvetta, you'll really enjoy this!

This recipe was delicious. I took it to a Holiday Dinner Party (I was in charge the vegetable) and received rave reviews.   I sauted the onion and celery with two cloves of garlic (since other reviewers said this recipe tasted a little bland).  Added S&P then followed the recipe completely and this dish turned out perfectly.  It makes a huge amount but there were no leftovers. I didn't think it was time consuming at all.  Just take your time and keep stirring the cheese (I used velveeta) until it melts.  You will be pleased.

Very good recipe! I used 4 cups of rice - as it was too runny with only 3 cups.  Only 1 cup water (rather then 1 1/4C), I cooked the rice using roasted herb chicken broth and I did not use celery/onion mix - since I didn't think it was necessary!!! I also did not cook the broccoli - it is just fine running it under hot water for a few minutes. I through it in the crock pot on low for a few hours and it turned out very good! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

I thought this was a great recipe.  It made plenty of food with leftovers for the next day which was wonderful!  Like some of the others that wrote reviews I agree that it needed more salt and pepper, but I would definitely make this again.

I read most of the reviews before I decided to make this but I didn't go with what anyone else did.  I know what I like so I decided to leave out the onions and celery.  The few alterations I had to make are the reason I gave it a 4 rating.

I cooked 2 cups of rice (yielded 4 cups), added a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken.  I cut up a small block of Velveeta and mixed it all together.  I got the 1 pound microwaveable bag of broccoli cuts by Green Giant.  Threw them into the mixture and added only one cup of water so that it was smooth but not too liquidy.  I added garlic salt and black pepper to taste.  This fit perfectly into a standard 9x11 baking pan but is about 2 inches thick.  You may want to use a bigger pan. I sprayed a little Crisco olive oil around the pan first then spooned the mixture.  I spread shredded cheddar cheese and a little colby jack cheese on top.  Let it bake until golden brown.  

It was good enough to eat as an entree even without meat!

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because I changed a lot of it - because of what I had in the pantry.  I used 3 cups brown rice (uncooked).  I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup, so I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery.  I also didn't have any velveeta, so I used a can of nacho chz soup, added some shredded cheddar and the water.  I added a can of sliced mushrooms (didn't drain) and a 13oz can of chicken (not drained).  I didn't cook the broccoli, just defrosted it in water in the microwave and then drained it because we like it crisp.  I left out the celery and onion all together.  After about 35 min. in the oven, I topped it with more shredded cheddar and some french fried onions.  It made a ton -  close to 2 full 9x13's.  It was awesome!

I thought this was a great recipe! I made the recipe serve 5. I used one can of cream of chicken/cream of mushroom soup. This was enough to fill a casserole dish and will be plenty for my husband and I to eat for the rest of the week. I added some pepper and other spices...I just did it "to taste".

I'm a southern girl and have always been reluctant to try casserole recipes other than my grandmothers... but this casserole is DELICIOUS!  I made it as described but skipped the mayo and celery (because I forgot to get them at the store), and it was divine!  Perfect consistency -- not too thick, not too thin.  I'll definitely be making again soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe. I have made it twice and my whole family loved it. I would suggest cutting the recipe in half, though, if you have a small family. I made half and it was enough to feed 4 adults with lunch leftovers!

This is a great crowd pleaser. I took it to my work thanksgiving luncheon and my in-laws christmas dinner and they were all asking for the recipe. I'm a begginer and it was still easy to do.

My fiance's family has a recipe I think is fantastic.  He loves it, too.  He loves this recipe more!  It was so easy and turned out perfectly.  I used fresh broccoli, not frozen, and it was fantastic.

Very tasty side dish - my husband and child loved it!  To make it a bit healthier I substituted brown rice and 2% cheese.  Still delicious with less fat and more fiber.

This was a very nice complement to our Thanksgiving dinner: I used broccoli + cauliflower and it turned out perfectly,along with the freshly baked Gourmet Sweet Potato Casserole.  My neighbor said hands down this was "The best broccoli rice casserole I've ever eaten."

I sauteed the onion and celery first then in the same pot added the soups and cheese.  It really didn't dirty too many pans.  I prefer casserole recipes that have you cook the rice first - better safe than crunchy!  Thanks for the keeper!

This was a quick and easy dinner.  I cooked regular rice and placed it in a 13 x 9 pan.  Then I topped it with 16 oz frozen brocoli, 2 cups cooked leftover turkey meat, 2 cups shreaded cheese, sauteed onion, celery, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup (didn't have cream of chicken or american cheese) & homemade bread crumbs.  I just layered it all in the pan and baked it til heated through.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Just like what I grew up eating.  I added shredded chicken breast to make it a meal.  Used Cheese Whiz for the cheese.  This isn't a 5 star meal but it is good, kids love it, it feeds a lot of people and it's fairly inexpensive.  It makes so much that I froze half.

This was pretty good, will make again, do recommend getting it eaten quickly, as it doesn't keep really well as it dried up. And it does make quite a bit. Will make again but cut in half.

My roommates and I loved this recipe!!  I followed the suggestion of putting crackers on top and that added a nice crunch.  I made it without celery and it was still very good!

It is a good recipe. However, I used regular rice instead of instant rice. I recommend soaking the rice for a few hours in warm water before putting it in the casserole. Also, I skipped adding the onion. It turned out great! I also added a bread crumb topping for a crunch! Very tasty, Thanks!

Yum!!!!!  A big hit for Easter!  Did like some previous reviewers and added 3/4c milk only.  Used medium cheddar, semi condensed organic crm of mushroom, and organic cream of chicken (no msg).  Also, used a family sized 30 ounce broccoli.  Make sure you cook the whole 45 mins.  Dh requested I add chicken and try it as a main dish.  Will definetly make again!

I liked this recipe a lot. I changed three things: 1. I only used cream of mushroom, 2. I cooked the rice in chicken broth, and 3. I used cheddar cheese instead of the cheese called for in the recipe.

Great recipe, but next time I won't cook the broccoli all the way before putting it in the oven. It was a little 'over' cooked for my liking. But, the dish was empty. Thanks for sharing.

I've eaten this at restaurants, but this is the first time I've made it.  I'm glad I did.  We really liked it, and  my toddler did too.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and cooked it in an 8X8 pan and it turned out fine - and it still took our family of 4 three days to eat it.

Excellent;  I used recommendations from another and put 1 can cr. mushroom soup, 8-12 oz. processed Am. cheese, and 3/4 cup milk in casserole and put in 350 oven to melt. I then sauteed onions and celery, cooked broccoli. I mixed everything in the casserole, stirred and baked. I also topped with 1/3 cup bread crumbs mixed with melted margarine before baking.  Will make again--it was like our favorite restaurant side dish!  It was very easy and very tasty.

I doubled the recipe and it made enough for two 13x9 Pyrex dishes! I subbed the white rice for brown rice. This was very cheesy and simple to prepare. It was a hit for Thanksgiving Dinner!

This was pretty good. I omitted the celery b/c we don't eat celery, and used half of the cheese. It was very creamy. I could have probably left out the milk.

Yummy. Halved the recipe and it still made a lot. Used 1 can cream of mushroom, 16 oz broccoli, 1 boil in bag of rice and 8 oz of the cheese. I didn't have celery and didn't feel like chopping an onion but don't think they were missed. Served with Gina's Lemon Pepper Chicken. Nice meal.

This was great.  I did a few things different b/c I was low on cheese.  I used about 3/4 cup shredded cheddar and 1 packet of  powdered cheese sauce from mac and cheese.  I also used  cream of chicken, no mushroom.  I had fresh broccoli that I steamed well b/f hand and left over rice from supper the night b/f.  I really liked this, I may experiment more later.

I'm not a fan of broccoli at all, but this was actually pretty good.  My aunt makes a great broccoli casserole, and it's the only way I will ever eat broccoli.  This isn't quite the same as hers (I'll have to get her recipe and post it here!), but it was pretty darn good!  I did substitue cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom soup, and used 1 celery stalk.

This tasted fine and got compliments at Christmas dinner.  I found it too fluffy and I still prefer the denser recipes.  I like the recipes where you don't pre-cook the minute rice.

Made this for a potluck and it tasted way to strongly of celery. I will use about 2 stalks next time I make it. I also used a large jar of cheez whiz instead of American cheese. Otherwise, kept the recipe the same.

Followed the recipe pretty close.  I used shredded chedder cheese,(instead of American) 2 cans of cream of mushroom, and sauted onion.  I left out the celery.  As other reviewers stated-it took alot of time to prepare and lots of dishes to clean up.  Otherwise, it was tasty and my family liked it.

My Mom use to make this. It was great Classic comfort food. You could even use less cheese if you want. I also used more rice ( brown). This recipe made a huge amount so I froze half. Also I used chedder cheese.

Delicious and easy to make!  I used aged cheddar (454 g) and it was very tasty.  Also used real broccoli and leftover brown rice from last night. Would certainly make it again.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!  I used chedder instead of American cheese because chedder is better - and it turned out very good!  This recipe isn't that easy to make because you have to do a couple things all at once, but it is definitely worth it - I will definetely make this again!

Great basic recipe, I left out celery & onions - casserole was very creamy and tasty. I crumbled mild chedder chunks in there as well making for a cheesey delight... Also added some french fried onions on top; makes a great alternative to the typical green bean casserole.

I halved the recipe, using cream of mushroom only.  Didn't cook broccoli, just thawed it in a colander.  Only used 1/4 cup of water, not sure why the recipe calls for so much.  With these alterations, turned out great!

My new favorite for broccoli rice casserole!  I took a few short cuts; skipped the celery and onion, and mixed all the ingredients together in the casserole dish as soon as the rice was cooked to save on dishes.  It turned out just great!

This recipe is indeed tasty.  The only problem is that I'm not sure if all the work needed to make it is worth the benefits of the final product.  I was getting so tired by the end of the process that I forgot to sautee the onions and celery.  It still came out fine though.  Another thing is that I'm not sure if the celery is necessary.  Whatever you do though cut the recipe in half.  This recipe makes entirely too much. For every container I used, I eventually ended up having food running over and out of it. Also be careful not to let your cheese stick.

I love it!!!  This is my new favorite dish.  I cut the recipe in half since it's just me and my husband.  He loved and my mother in law loved it too; and they are both picky eaters.  I'm making it again for Easter, one for my family and one for my in-laws.  Thanks so much!

This was a very yummy casserole, even my step kids gobbled it up and they are very picky eaters. We ate just the casserole with some cream corn, and it was a complete meal. I lessened the water and added extra broccoli. I didn't cook the broccoli all the way because I didn't want it to be mushy, but it was a touch undercooked, and I like my broccoli fully cooked. Overall it was delicious, and I will definitely make it again.

I cut down the recipe a little and used only a 15 oz. package of broccoli.  Also used milk - about 3/4 of a cup.  I topped this with some grated cheese and crushed up Ritz.  I also added some dehydrated onions, about a 1/2 t. of garlic powder and pepper.  The salt from the soup was enough for the dish.

This was a great recipe!  My family loved it!  It was pretty watery...I used 6 cups rice instead and it was prefect!  Also, I mixed it the night before so all I had to do was cook it the next day.  It worked great!

This was very good.  I substitued a large chicken buillon cube for the cream of chicken soup.  I also used just one pot (and the baking dish) adding the ingredients in stages to minimize the clean up.  I would definitely make this again.

I skipped the sauting onions and celery bit and added dehydrated onions.  I also added garlic and mushrooms.  I believe next time I would double the broccoli and add a bit more garlic and onions.

I KNOW IF YOU DO THIS RIGHT IT WILL NEVER FIT IN A 13 X 9. WONDERFUL RECIPE BUT IT RAN THE DISH OVER AND MAKES A PRETTY GOOD MESS BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT IS WORTH THE TROUBLE. I WOULD CUT THE RECIPE TO 5-7 SERVINGS TO FIT IN A 9 X 13. YUM YUM!

I made this with velveeta sans celery and onion.
I thought it was good but I was a little disappointed. My picky teenager seemed to like it a lot, but she likes more bland food. Next time I will use american cheese.

I thought this was yummy, a great blend of flavors, but my husband thought the celery and onion was too strong. I only made half the recipe, and it still filled a 9 by 13 inch baking dish! Fortunately the leftovers were good also.

This was very tasty.  I made a few changes.  Didn't use celery or water, didn't heat soup and cheese.  Just made broccoli and rice to instructions, then mixed in bowl with soups and onion.  Added cheddar, put in casserole and heated for 30 minutes.  It was quite good!

This was great!!  I didn't have American cheese in the house so substituted Colby-Jack
and it was very good with that.  Sure makes a big casserole, plenty to go around

This casserole was very good.  It was a good variation of an old recipe I've had for years.
Thanks!

First off- absolutely not bland!
This is a holiday staple and there are a ton of variations out there but this recipe is as close to perfect as it gets.
The three cups if rice is three cups if cooked rice, not raw resulting in six cups. That mistake would truly make it bland.
The trick with this casserole is that it should be soupy before baking so that the final result is not dry. The only essential that I add is a can or two of  diced water chestnuts.
I saute the celery and onion in butter in a huge skillet, then add in soups, cheese and water. Nuke the broccoli a little, cook the rice in an instant pot. Then mix in the broccoli, rice and chestnuts and pour all in to casserole dish and bake for the 45 minutes. Top with cheese and sometimes some panko bread crumbs. Great recipe that has nice flavor without being overpowering.

I have made this several times someone Complained that this was too complicated I think they need to get out of the kitchen because obviously they don’t know what they’re doing this is so easy and takes very little time to throw together the only thing I don’t like this recipe is that through using Valvedere cheese and other recipes again to use the processed cheese instead of real cheddar which I would prefer to just put 8 to 16 ounces of sharp cheddar grated in this

I made this recipe, and I used brown rice instead of the white rice and since canned soups have a high salt content, I used 1 can of evaporated milk instead of the cream of chicken soup. My family loved it and I will make it again for Lenten suppers. Thanks for a great website and the easy navigation it is to use.

I always make broccoli casserole but decided to check out some recipes. Saw this one and decided to make it for our family Christmas party. I went by the recipe and it was delicious! Not understanding those reviews that said it was bland. I had so many compliments that this recipe is a keeper. I will be saving this recipe and using it for all my holiday meals.

Disclaimer- I don’t like broccoli rice cheese casserole. I was asked to make this for a thanksgiving meal. I omitted the celery, put in a little less water than it called for and added more broccoli just bc one bag was 16 oz and one was 10oz, I didnt want 6 oz of leftover broccoli. This was really good!  Broccoli wasn’t mushy as other have said. I think it’s flavorful, though I did make the rice in chicken broth instead of water.

We used 8 oz pepper jack cheese and 8 oz mild cheddar. We also used 2 packets of uncle Ben broccoli cheese minute rice and 2 10 oz packets of frozen broccoli florets steamers. We baked ours for only 40 mins.

This dish turned out delicious! Just replaced grocery items with organic foods and added garlic parsley salt and pepper for added taste. I substituted water with the chicken broth from boiled  chicken. I used mild sharp cheddar cubed cheese instead of American processed cheese just because. After I lightly cooked broccoli I chopped it in the food processor for a nice chunky blend.

I made it this way, 2 cups of white rice, 2 packages of frozen broccoli florets, onion and celery, cooked in 4 tablespoons of butter, added 3 tablespoons of flour, cooked that 4minutes, then added 2 1/2 cups of half/half and cooked until thickened. Added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, whisked and cooked 4 minutes, then added 1 package of shredded sharp cheddar, stirred until combined. Micro waved the broccoli in the packages while cooking the rice, then drained and added to a large bowl. fluffed the rice with a fork added to the broccoli, tossing until combined. Sprinkled the broccoli and rice with original Mrs. Dash, then poured the cheese mixture into the bowl gently tossing it all. Also I seasoned the onion and  celery with a little salt and pepper as it was in the pan. Baked at 350 for 35 minutes. It is very good.

We used 2 cups of rice and it was great. Also used 12  ounces of Colby cheese and a 16 ounce bag of chopped broccoli. It filled the dish up and between 3 people, we had several servings left over. We think we might use 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup next time instead of the Cream of Mushroom. This would be a great dish for your next church or social event.

I steamed the broccoli, celery & onion in the steamer portion of my rice cooker while the rice cooked to perfection.

I chose to use Rico's spicy nacho cheese sauce 'cause the dish is a 'bland' dish and i prefer spicy and it worked out great!  I also added a chopped red bell pepper for color, by the way.

The next time I make it I'll use brown rice for more fiber and less bland; however, in either case it's a great side dish.  I may also try it as a main entrée with chicken breasts chunks and a bit of teriyaki sauce to spice it up a bit too.

As many stated, it is bland.  For God's sake, look at the ingredients.  As this is just a side dish to be served with something spicy or tangy, the only thing I would change is the cheese.  Why do people use processed cheese?  For this recipe a nice Jarlsberg would add just the right amount of taste to lift the flavors for your palate.  But processed cheese?  Never!

The biggest problem with this recipe is it's made with water.  I used canned milk.  In fact, I've been making something almost like this for 30 years but I used jalapeno cheez whiz or mexican velveeta for cheez.  If I can't find that I use velveeta and add a little hot sauce.  Add a little worcestshire sauce to it also. This just isn't the best reincarnation of this dish.  Why in the world would you make this with water?

I likes this because all the ingredients were cooked before assembly of the casserole. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Thumbs up all around.

I make as is, except adding a couple cups of shredded cheddar to the top before baking. It turns out great and provides left overs for a couple days.  Great as is.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  Very good, however, we only needed to use 1 1/2 cups uncooked rice.  Also followed others reviews, and seasoned very well with garlic, paprika, and seasoning salt.

It makes a broccoli and rice casserole, indeed. But if you want it to taste good please add about 2 tbsp each of salt and pepper, garlic powder, crushed red peppers and about 4 cups of shredded mild cheddar. Then it will be both broccoli rice casserole AND tasty!

This recipe was delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it was the first to go. I omitted the celery and onion and used 1 can of cream of broccoli and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 16oz of Velveeta cheese. I will definitely be making this again. Yum Yum.

I love it! Made it twice as it (reduced the celery, one whole bunch) I just made it for a third time with some changes just for variety. I minced a load of garlic and sautéed it with the veggies in butter. I only used 3 stalks of celery. And I seasoned the veggies while cooking with salt, pepper, blackening seasoning and just a dash of beef bouillon. Melted the velveeta and cream soups in the microwave, then mixed in! I also used 8 cups of cooked rice. The cheese sauce makes a lot! Also, using broccoli florets only, not "broccoli cuts" makes for a heartier and more attractive looking casserole. I may try to make a "Fiesta" version like another reviewer suggested!

I left out the celery and used 2 packages of shredded triple cheddar cheese. I also topped mine with crushed townhouse crackers that I had combined with melted butter and a little extra cheese was added in the last 10 minutes of baking.

I used whatever grated cheese I had in the fridge and added sautéed chicken tenders. Comfort food for sure. I honestly needed to go grocery shopping but, eh, didn't feel like leaving the house! A pantry dish I'll make again.

I thought this was a yummy recipe. I added one can of milk instead of water. I also added some garlic and seasoned salt. I did not melt the cheese  either. I boiled the frozen broccoli according to the package instructions and in another pan I cooked the stalk of celery, whole onion and some garlic in the butter. Then I just mixed one can of broccoli soup and one can of cream of chicken soup and 16 oz of shredded sharp cheddar together and the milk. I stirred in the broccoli and the rice that I cooked in the rice cooker. I popped it in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes and it was hot and amazing....not runny or bland. I will make this again for sure.

I'm taking off two stars because the amount of rice is way off. I used 2 cups of uncooked (I don't cook a lot of rice so wasn't sure) and it was WAY WAY too much rice. Wish I'd had the foresight to know even 2 was way too much. But the way this recipe is written makes it sound like the ingredient amount is uncooked.

Other than the rice amounts, this was pretty close to what I was looking for.  As it is I wasted a lot of ingredients.

Great recipe exactly as it is laid out. To make it into a full dinner instead of just a side dish I browned boneless pork chops and laid on top of the casserole while it cooked. One dish wonder.

This turned out great! gave 4 stars as I modified just a little. I omitted the celery and added minced garlic instead. substituted chicken broth for the water. I used Velveeta cheese pouches and added smoked chicken. topped with French onions for the last 15 mins of baking. delish!

I made this exactly as listed. This needs a little more water than is in the recipe. Maybe 1 1/2 cups of water or a little milk.  I will try that next time I make it.  Other than that a great recipe!

I didn't actually make it as directed (lol). It's a great framework for those of us who don't much know about how these kinds of dishes come together. I made mine completely in a 20" skillet. No cooking as directed on the side. Started with caramelizing the onions (which gave some really great flavor), to cooking the broccoli and rice through in the soup and watery ingredients. Came out good that way. Like I said, great framework.

This recipe turned out great! I did a few things differently. First, I did not pre-cook the rice. It's minute rice and cooks fine in the soup in the oven. I also omitted the onions. Finally, I crumbled Ritz crackers on top for a crusty buttery topping.

This was excellent. I added salt to the pot when making the broccoli and I added salt when making the rice. It made all the difference. I also used less broccoli than it called for and I used 4 cups of instant rice .  It turned out wonderful!

This dish is  a hit with EVERYONE! Adults & kids alike! It's a staple in my home & A MUST at potlucks. I always omit the celery & onion because I'm lazy. I also use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and NO chicken soup (didn't have chicken soup the first time I tried this recipe & it worked, so I stuck with it), and lastly, I top with sharp cheddar cheese, which sends this already rich dish over the top!

My family loves this recipe.  Over the years, however, I've modified it a little.  I don't cook the frozen broccoli, but thaw it out, and squeeze out any excess water.  I also switched out the instant white rice for instant brown rice.  I think that leaves a little bit of texture to the dish, and it is not so mushy.  Still tastes great!

This recipe was very good after a few changes do to our tastes. Did not use cream of chicken soup. Did not use water. I used the milk and chicken broth. Used 1 cup quick cooking rice. Used cubed velveeta cheese. We ate it as a side dish and as a dip with tortillia chips. I cooked this in a slow cooker for about 6 hrs.

Favorite recipe ever! Husband & I make this about once a week! Usually follow to the T (minus celery, not a fan), but this time we left out the butter/onion all together, still love it! We use 2 bags of broccoli (one full pieces, one chopped pieces) to give it more texture. We also use American & Colby Jack cheese! Seriously love this stuff!

It's a different consistency from the baked casserole of my childhood. It is creamy deliciousness and was much faster and easier in the microwave. I used a small bar of velveeta  for the cheese. I made 2 cups of minute rice. Since everything was basically pre-cooked I only heated it for 5 minutes after I mixed it all together. The French fried onions are a nice touch. I added them for the last minute and a half of my 5 minutes.

I love this recipe.  Will definitely make it again.  I made 20 servings for a family reunion so the bake time was longer.  I also added cooked chicken breast which made it more filling and added some protein.  Really tasty!!!

I was craving a good home cooked casserole and came across this one and it was perfect! I used provolone, Swiss and American cheese and topped it with cheddar in the last 15 minutes. I also added a couple cloves of garlic and a spice melody. Omitted the water and just used 3 cans of cream of mushroom instead. Full of flavor! Will definitely be making again!

I have loved this recipe all my life. Since I was a small child and my aunts brought this dish over for our holiday gatherings. It's my favorite holiday dish and just isn't a family get together without it. If you like cheese and broccoli, you'll love this dish. It makes a wonderful filler dish and is versatile by adding rotel, or other spices to kick it up a notch or two.

It  was really tasty but the recipe calls for 3 cups of rice and it was too much and came out a little dry.   I made it again with 1 and 1/2 cup rice and it was perfect.

I'm not a cook,  so I strictly followed the instructions in this recipe. It came out looking good, smelling good and tasting good. Although, the texture is bland and texture is everything for my kiddos, so I'm deducting 2 stars.

This was my first time making this. I did change a little. Instead of adding the whole amount of American cheese, I used maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of it and the rest apple smoked Gouda. Everyone loved it.

This is a family favorite now - it's delicious and super easy to throw together.  I cut down on the number of dirty dishes by sauteing the onion and 2 sticks of chopped celery in my large  frying pan and then adding the soups and cheese straight to that once the onions are soft.  Meanwhile the rice is steaming, and the broccoli is in the microwave.  It looks like a lot of food when it all comes together, but it does all fit in the 9*13 baking pan!

Was a great dish, i didn't add the onions because of personal preferences around the household. I will make this again during the holidays for years to come. I recommend this dish to anyone who needs a tasty, low-cost meal for a large family.

I read many of the reviews and edited to what I read. I also made twice the amount for Thanksgiving. I added seasoning salt, garlic and pepper when sautéing the onion. No celery. I used both cheddar and Colby jack cheese. Then, I also sautéed the broccoli in garlic and olive oil before adding it to the cheese soup mixture. I cooked it all to the above and then put it in a crock pot. Once ready to serve, I crushed up 2 pouches of Ritz crackers and spread it on top!

I did make modifications just per my taste. I used fresh broccoli and steamed it, though i'm sure if you want broccoli with some texture left cooking before hand could just be skipped.  I cooked jasmine rice in the rice cooker. Celery isn't the biggest hit for my family but it helps add flavor so I diced two small stalks and 2 medium carrots instead. I used Mexican shredded cheese and left about a cup or so out to top the dish with. I added some seasoned salt to the sauce mix.  And to make this a main dish I added about 2 cups chopped cooked chicken. Whoever said the sauce was to much is a bit wrong..unless it affected by the kind of rice used. I almost could have used a little more of the sauce. As for the flavor...it's broccoli casserole. It's normally not a super flavor filled kind of dish. But you can always play around with seasonings! We usually add additional seasoned salt or creole seasoning to our individual dishes. My family enjoyed it.

Yum!  Made this as the number one reviewer suggested (apologizes to the author,) and it was a complete hit at our house!  Added small chunks of ham which was the reason for searching for a recipe to finish up my leftover ham.  Really good!

I totally agree with many of the other reviewers. Overall, this is a very good base recipe for adaptation. I didn't have a lot of the ingredients so I substituted 8oz. Cabot's Seriously Sharp Cheddar and 8oz. Kraft American cheese.  I didn't have celery so I added a cup of fresh corn to the onions and a few cloves of minced garlic just because I like garlic! I used a combination of fresh broccoli and cauliflower (20oz. total). I substituted (cooked) Basmati rice (2c dry plus 3 c. water= 6 cups) instead of instant. I cooked the rice first. Then in a large skillet, cooked the onions, garlic and fresh corn in butter , adding  2 cans soup per recipe.  I slowly added about 1 to 1-1/4c. 2% milk until I liked the consistency, gradually blending in the cubed American and cheddar cheese. I folded in the rice and finally the cooked broccoli and cauliflower into the soup mix in the same large skillet. I used additional seasoning  but it needed much more than the recipe called for. I suggest seasoning as you prepare each element of the casserole-the rice first then onion-corn mixture. After adding the soup, milk and cheese to onion mix, taste and adjust seasoning. Adjust seasoning a final time if needed, after blending in the rice and finally the broccoli/cauliflower.  I agree with the other reviewer who added cheese to the top-it's a must!!! Cook covered for the first 35 min, then uncovered for the last 10 min. so cheese  browns slightly.

I thought it was sooo yummy...I used Jasmine rice instead of regular white rice and I cubed up chicken breast to make this a full dinner dish...I'm a simple country girl, I'm not fancy and love full flavored hardy meals and this dish has been a favorite since I was a little girl!!..enjoy!!

I made this today. I made a few changes as some of the other reviewers did. I actually used 1 1/4 cup of milk instead of water, I used green onions instead of celery, I added Tony Chachere's More Spice Seasoning, and after it cooked I added finely shredded Colby Jack cheese for additional flavoring and mixed it well. I then put it back in the oven for 8 minutes. It turned out great.

This is very good and as long as you season your chicken properly it's perfect!  I poached my chicken beasts well seasoned and diced after cooking.  The broccoli I let live meaning I steamers lightly "no cover" so that there was still life.  I did not have American cheese so I used the same amount of cheddar.  My family (adult) felt it was great comfort food perfect for a early spring raining day in Michigan.

I make this recipe every year, except I usually use Cheez Whiz or shredded Velveeta. I also do not add water, just a little milk if it needs some. ! I would not consider the dish "bland", but it does not have a lot of seasoning (as one can tell when they read the recipe). But that is an easy fix--- season to your own taste. It is comforting, and a staple at our holiday table.

I love this casserole, though I have made in slightly different in the past to yield a stronger flavor. For those of you complaining you might want to try yellow rice (I always precook mine and X the water in the recipe). Another tip is adding in a spicy cheese. This could be a hot cheese dip that you would use for chips or a spicy velveeta cheese.

This was delicious! I've tried similar recipes but this one has been my favorite.  I followed another reviewers advice and just heated the wet ingredients in the oven in the casserole dish then stirred and added the rice and broccoli, fewer dishes;) I'll be making this again at Christmas.

I used boil in a bag instant rice and frozen broccoli for this. I didn't heat the soups and cheese in a skillet as directed, but instead threw everything in a big bowl along with the rice and broccoli and mixed. I had to add quite a few spices to give it some flavor. Baked for 35 mins at 375 degrees. It was a big hit!

I've made this multiple times and it's always a huge hit! I especially like the flavor of the onion and the celery in this recipe.
The casserole extremely cheesy!

This was good but a little too soupy.  I should have made more rice and added more broccoli to tame down the soupy flavor a bit.

For those of you considering making this, please take just a moment to watch the embedded video...it will clear up any confusion as to cooked or uncooked rice, etc.  As a long-time Allrecipes user, I have found it quite beneficial to watch videos offered.  I believe that had those reviewers done their due diligence prior to making this casserole, their rating would have been higher and their dinners better!

This is delicious!  The only changes I made were that I cooked the onions and celery first and I used jasmine rice because I like it better than instant rice.  I cooked it first, so i only baked it for about 30 minutes.  My family loves this!  Thanks!

Good dish, easy to prepare. I added some cooked chicken to the mix. It lacked flavor but I kind of like bland dishes. It was a nice change.

Very good recipe.  I did make a few changes based on preferences and what I had on hand.  I used brown rice, omitted celery & onion, used shredded cheddar & casserole cheese blends and used cream of celery and cream of chicken with herbs soups.  Also like Linda mcclean I added all my ingredients ( including fresh broccoli vs frozen) right into the pot I cooked my rice in and added milk to get to the right consistency instead of water. To add the onion flavor back to the dish dice I didn't use any, I also added onion powder.  I think I will make this one again.  My 3.5 yr old ate it so that is always a huge plus!

I made this dish for my boyfriend and friends, and we all thought this dish was delicious! Very cheesy, and very good. I did add some crushed red pepper (personal preference) and I used crushed Cheez-Its on the top of half, which added another dimension of cheese flavor. All together a delicious recipe that I will definitely make again!

I was worried about this ending up soupy because what I poured in to the casserole dish was very thin, but it ended up with a great consistency.  It could have used a little more flavor, next time I will add more salt & pepper.

Although I loved this dish, I feel that I cannot give it five stars due to all the changes I made.  Using what I had on hand, I made 1 cup of rice (not instant).  Then I quickly sauteed some fresh broccoli, half an onion, and a stalk of celery in olive oil in a skillet.  I stirred the veggies, rice, 1 can of broccoli & cheese soup, some grated cheddar cheese, and 1 can of milk together in an 8x8 casserole dish.  I baked it as per the directions.  It is really good, but since I just used the recipe and directions as a basis for making the dish, I am only giving it 4 stars.

I made the recipe exactly as is except for the following changes: omit the cream of chicken soup and celery and add a can of sliced mushrooms and a tsp. of minced garlic to the onion. I also added some season salt because reviews were saying it was too bland. I really enjoyed this dish with my changes! It was a huge hit for dinner with my family as well.

This was just the recipe I was looking for. Even my picky eaters went back for more. The only thing I did different from the recipe is season the brocolli and rice as it was cooking and I omitted the celery. I only made 5 servings but will still have leftovers and plenty to freeze for another meal.

I liked this a lot.  I cut the recipe in half.  I used 1 can of cream of celery soup instead of using celery.  Milk instead of water.  Also added some garlic powder.  Topped with half a roll of crushed ritz crackers mixed with a half a stick of melted butter.  Worth trying.  A great comfort food type of side dish.

Very good and very creamy.  I used milk instead of water.  I cooked the rice in the microwave and then mixed the soups into the same bowl when ready.  Mixed the thawed broccoli in (uncooked).  Poured it in the dish and put the cubes of cheese on top.  Cooked the rest per instructions.  No celery or onion just cuz I'm lazy.  ;)

I thought this was great!  I did accidentally grab a can of broccoli cheese soup and hid it pored in before I noticed, then added a can of cream of chicken.  I thought it was great .  I put in 4 cups of cooked rice and only one 16 oz package of broccoli.  Will make again, it was a family favorite!

Took it from Great to OVER THE TOP! I added 3 cooked, cut-up breasts of chicken.  I used celery salt & celery seed instead of fresh celery.  I topped w/ more cheese & sprinkled w/ regular bread crumbs.  Everyone LOVED it!  Said it tasted like an awesome Hot Pocket - that is good, right? :)

Used this as a great base for a broccoli casserole, then added chicken, used mozzarella instead, and added sauted onions. Pretty different, but really appreciated the general recipe. Thanks!

Great recipe, especially when almost all these ingredients are already in your home.  I omitted the celery and halved the recipe for only two of us.  We'll have leftovers for 1-2 more meals.  (I also cooked it in our toaster oven to save on space since the oven was being used--it turned out great).  This would be great at a holiday/large family meal if not halved!

I found this to be a delicious, tasty recipe! We cut the entire recipe in half and baked it in a 8x8" pan except we cut the cheese by three quarters and only used 4oz. It was still creamy and delicious. I plan to make this again!

Middle of the road.  Got pressed for time and took some shortcuts. Used Wild Rice I had as left-over. Used 1 can Cream of Chix Soup and Chix broth instead of H2O. 2 bags frozen broccoli, S&P, dash of garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, dry mustard. Used Velvetta cheese.  Mixed everything together and put in the casserole dish w/o any precooking.  Like most recipes, it is just a jumping off point.  The plus, not a bit left-over.  Even our picky veggie eaters ate it.

This was very delicious.  My guests enjoyed it.  Personally, I did not like the consistency of the instant rice, which I had never tried before.  I will try this whole thing again with regular slow cooking rice, lol.

Very good recipe.  My teenage kids loved it!  This really is a side dish, not a main course.  It was easy and will not last long in the house!  It's also nice as a snack later if you have leftovers.

Very good. I made a couple of changes...I used 1 can cream of mushroom with garlic and 1 can cream of chicken.  I also cooked the rice in chicken broth and I used Cheese Whiz.  I got tons of compliments on this dish.

I made this today for Thanksgiving and it was very good. The only thing I did different was to to add a garlic spice mixture (Goya's Adobo...which I pretty much add this to everything because it adds garlic, salt, pepper and some other spices)to the celery onion mixture because some of the other revies said it was bland.  Per the other reviews I only used two or three stalks/ribs of celery and I don't even remember tasting it.  This was a BIG casserole so if you want to feed a bunch of people use the whole thing, but cut it in half if you don't need as much.  I only gave it 4 stars because I was actually looking for more of a "casserole-y" type of dish.  But this was a delicious broccoli and cheese rice dish.

Good!  I have a similar recipe to this that I think might be easier.  I cooked the broccoli and mixed it with (1) 8 oz. jar of cheese whiz and a 1/4 pkg. of shredded cheddar cheese.  I then mixed one can of cream of potato soup with the cooked rice and then mixed both batches together.  Placed in casserole dish and topped with additional cheddar and baked.  I also added french fried onions on top for the last 10 minutes of baking because these are a must for casseroles in my opinion!

Fabulous!  My husband, who is very picky, loved it.  He picked at the casserole until dinner time and then ate his portion. My kids loved it as well.  I added chicken breasts on the top before I put it in the oven and I used left over rice from the night before...YUMMY!!

It was good.  Everyone liked it.  Next time I'll add some chicken to make it a main dish.  And I sprinkled shredded cheddar on top for extra cheese flavor.

This was great! I made half of the recipe and had a couple of changes...I was planning on using california blend veggies, but realized that I took out the bag of broccoli stir fry veggies to thaw instead, so I put those in it! I used cream of mushroom soup only, used milk instead of water, added chicken to make it a meal.  And put bread crumbs on top...very yummy!!!!  My picky 5 year old is even eating it...kind of... ;o)

All my favorite things in one dish.  Fantabulous!  This is a keeper. Alittle time consuming but worth it.  I did add fresh broc and mushrooms and omitted the celery.  And used minced garlic from traders Joe's. Not really one for measuring and I love garlic so the more garlic the merrier!  I served this with pork chops in a asian marinade that I through together just before walking out the door for work. Excellent.  A must try.  enjoy!

This was so good. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and it still turned out great. Also i left out the celery because i didn't have any and the onion because i was talking to my daughter and forgot it. The tip about melting the cheese with the soup and water in the same pan was great worked nice. Also I used leftover rice and turned out great. My 5 yr old loved it.

Awesome!  I make one similar (less steps)but this was worth every step.  I think I could cut some back with the same results. I used my mini processor to finely cut the celery...we don't like just diced. I did sprinkle sharp cheddar cheese on top....excellent.

Excellent as-is! As others have done, I just toss cheese, soup, butter and water in the 9x13 and warm in the oven until broccoli is thawed and rice is done.  Then I toss it all together and chuck it into the oven for a little over half an hour (my oven is hotter than others).  I'll also throw in a pound of ground turkey at the same time as the cheese and soup mix to make it a well rounded meal.  You could probably also add a few slices of sharp cheddar to kick up the cheese flavor, but it's great either way.  I can't stop eating it. Fantastic leftovers. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for Christmas, at the request of my husband, and everyone seemed to like it.  I did what someone else suggested and chunked the cheese into the soups into the casserole dish and put it in the oven to melt.  It was taking too long, so I put it the microwave to speed it up, then I added the celery/onion, and rice broccoli.  I used frozen broccoli florets and steamed them in the steamer as I fixed my rice.  My sister-in-law said that she liked it because the broccoli wasn't mushy.

Wow!  I do not usually take the time to rate a recipe, but I had to share with everyone how good this one is.  I made it on Christmas, and everyone LOVED it.  I will be making it again tonight for a party.  Finally, a broccoli rice casserole that is wonderful! Two thumbs up.

Tasty recipe.  I added chicken breast that I cooked in a skillet with olive oil and seasoned with garlic pepper.  

I modified the recipe a bit by adding only half the amount of broccoli and only a small amount of processed cheese.  I added shredded monterey jack on top.  I also used brown rice, cream of broccoli soup and healthy request version of cream of celery.

I will definitely make it again.

My recipe for this is similar, except I use 1/2 white rice and 1/2 original rice a roni.  I also add the velveeta cheese chunks while the rice is hot....makes everthing easier to blend.  Everyone begs me to make this year 'round!!
happy thanksgiving all

This is just like my mom's tried and true recipe.  The only thing I do differently is use a 16 oz jar of Cheez Whiz instead of the Velveeta.  I don't know if this makes a big difference in the taste, but I don't have to worry about cutting up the Velveeta and melting it.

This recipe is absolutely delicious; even my husband ate & LIKED it, and he avoids anything green (just like a little kid)!  However, I prefer recipes that aren't so time consuming and mess up that many dishes.

This is a great recipe. To add a little crunch I topped the casserole with crushed potatoe chips before baking.

This casserole was really good. I will definately make changes next time though. The celery and onion seem useless, I will use fresh brocoli, and cheddar cheese. It seemed to take forever to prepare, but I do think it was worth the effort.

This dish gets five stars from me because our 15 month old twins loved it.  Right now that's hard to find!  I used 12 ounces of Velvetta and less onion and celery and it turned out great.  I placed foil on top for the first half of the cooking time.  FYI-I did forget to look at how long the prep time was...it took at least 30 minutes or longer to prepare.  I added a 10 ounce can of chuck chicken and made it our main dish.  I also used fresh broccoli from a local farmer.  I will definitely make this again.  My husband and I also enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is great!! I doubled the original recipe and made two pans for a party, it was a hit!! Everyone loved it and I've had several requests for the recipe. The only change I made is that I didn't add the celery and onion and I used all cream of mushroom soup instead of using half cream of mushroom and half cream of chicken soup. Awesome!

This was just what I was looking for, very creamy. I didn't use two packages of broccoli though, I had a 16 oz. package on hand and it worked out fine. My husband loved it.

DELICIOUS!!!! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I never usually do, so that's okay. I used cheddar cheese instead of American and I added cooked chicken breasts with mozzerella cheese sprinkled all over it on top of the casserole and I cooked the rice in chickn broth. And everyone LOVED it. It was a favorite at Thanksgiving yesterday. It came out just right. We were all VERY pleased.

This recipe had good flavor, and pretty easy to make.  I have read the reviews, and don't see where it is too watery.  It baked up nicely.  The consistancy wasn't exactly what I expected, thought it would be a bit creamier.  Overall, a good recipe, and will probably make again!

Excellent casserole, I changed it the last couple times I have made this by adding a jar of Ragu™ Cheddar cheese sauce instead of cubed cheese. YUMMMMM !!!!! But the original recipe is also excellent, I just prefer the cheddar sauce.

This was O.K. but maybe would have been better had I not changed a few things around. First off, I cut the recipe in half (was only me and the hubby tonight), I used fresh steamed broccoli and cauliflower (wanted to used what was left in the fridge before it went bad), just used 1 whole can of cream of mushroom, used garlic intsead of celery (personal preference) and used some chedder and swiss (only cheeses I had on hand). Next time I will follow the recipe exact and see how that comes out. Thanks Gina :)

Very very good.  My boyfriend who hates everything that I cook ate it up and told me that I could cook it again if I wanted. :) I put it in the crock pot to keep it warm for him when I went to work.  It worked great, was a bit mushy but that's how I like rice.  Gonna make this one again.

This is a great recipe.  My husband, who is not easily impressed, loved it.  I added left-over chicken pieces to make it a meal.
