Really great! I couldn't get any thai chiles, so I substituted red pepper flakes (to taste) and I thought that worked really well.  The cilantro is what gives this recipe something special.  I also threw in some watermelon radishes and purple carrots.

As a recipe, I found that it fails miserably.  1 Daikon Radish - Really?  They weigh in at 7-10 pounds and would fill a gallon jar.  Even the small 6 inch X 3 in diameter piece I used filled a quart jar, it took 2 cups of pickling syrup to cover them.  

For something that big, a weight or practical way to measure it is needed.  The size of jar would be a good thing to add as well, that would help cooks to know what to expect.

I made the recipe, it should turn out fine, as its pretty standard.  I boiled the syrup to kill any bacteria, just heating it will shorten its shelf life.

I made this by the recipe the first time. I love it so much that I just have to play with it! So I've made a few variations. The last one I made is my favorite so far. I added thin slices of red onion to the carrot mix and while I was warming up the vinegar and sugar mixture I added 1/4 cup more sugar a 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and a 1/2 cup of whole cranberries. Not only was it a dish of delish but it was absolutely gorgeous! The cranberries turned the onions and marinade a lovely pink that looks lovely on a buffet next to luncheon meats and cheeses, rolls and other sammie fixings. I will make the original recipe but I will also continue to have fun playing with it. Thanks so much for posting it!

its a tasty recipe with few ingredients.  The problem I see is that there is not enough liquid to cover the radish and carrot juliennes.  Double the liquid for approximately 3 cups of daikon and 1 cup of carrot.  I used purple and orange carrot.  Save time and spiralize the veggies and use a scissors to cut them about two inches long as they come out of the  spiralizer

I worried about all the sugar, thinking it might taste  too sweet,  nope,  the sugar amount is correct.  I did another jar with only half the sugar.  Too tart.

I changed this up a little but the changes are subtle enough that I can still give it two thumbs up! I only had red radishes and jalapenos so that's what I used. Pretty, healthy and TASTY!  My kids even liked it so I think ill keep it on hand for an easy snack. Thanks for sharing with us!

This is delicious atop a banh mi sandwich. I double the liquid mixture for 1 medium sized daikon radish + 1 large carrot. And instead of a chili I add a very thinly sliced fresh jalape√±o.

Love it! Kids liked the carrots more, but I enjoyed the daikon radish most. I used some rice vinigar (1/2 & 1/2) simply because I ram out of vinigar and it turned out well both ways. Also put in green onion.

These are so good!  I doubled the liquid and used red pepper flakes because I had no fresh chiles.  Will definitely make more!

A little too sweet, but easy to make and yummy. I added roughly chopped garlic, peppercorns, and jalapenos.

This is very delicious. I made 1/2 batch yesterday to try and when i came home it was all gone!  I didn't have cilantro so i used flat leafed parsley, and didn't have the pepper, so i used read pepper flakes. Thank you for this recipe.

We enjoyed this at our last sushi party, but seems like it was missing a bit of something.
