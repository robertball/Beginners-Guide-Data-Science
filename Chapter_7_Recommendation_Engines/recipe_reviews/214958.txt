We used our own plants to make this on a hot June day. It was delicious. I didn't want to run the ice cream freezer so I just put it in a ziplock bag in the freezer and smashed it to mix it until it was frozen. Turned out fine.

Definitely refreshing and surprisingly delicate. The wine gives it a unique flavour. I thought it was too sweet, but I don't really care for sweet things.  It needs some time in the freezer to be a scoop-able consistency, so keep that in mind when preparing it. I ended up adding 1 cup of lemon and lime juice in the end but as is, my family liked it. Thank you for your recipe.

The sweet wine balanced out the sour lemon nicely. I used a bit more lemon than was called for because I'm a lemon fan. Perfect treat for summer and a good choice option for the season's herbs!
