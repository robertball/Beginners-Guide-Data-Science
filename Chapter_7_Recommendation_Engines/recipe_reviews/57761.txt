Probably one of the best pork roast I've ever made.  I took a glass baking dish about the size of my roast and spead the dry ingredients in there.  I added way more than called for because I like my roast to be crusted on the outside, not burned.  I also added garlic salt.  Then I rolled my roast in the seasonings.  No need to add oil to the roast before coating.  I placed the roast in one of those large black roasting pans with a cake rack on the bottom so it would not sit in it's drippings.  No need to cover it with foil.  I cooked mine for 2 hours & 45 minutes at 325 degrees and it did not burn.  I also used a meat thermometer.  Definately double the sauce.  I combined all my ingredients except for the cornstarch and got it warm first.  Then I had a whisk on hand when I added the cornstarch slowly so it wouldn't clump up.  If your sauce gets too thick just add a little more vinegar.  At 2 1/2 hours I took the roast out and drizzled about 1/2 cup of sauce over the roast.  I did not brush it because I didn't want to rub off my seasonings.  I put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes and it was perfect.  I will use this sauce with other meals.  It reminded me of the Chinese BBQ sauce on hula beef.

This was an amazing dish!I used balsamic vinegar, and was a bit worried since the mix of soy sauce and the balsamic looked so dark on the roast, but the flavour was outstanding. I also doubled the spices and garlic, mincing the garlic; added a bit of olive oil to make the rub stick to the roast better. I cut slits in the top of the roast and inserted more garlic slivers, and I also put a tent of foil over the roast for the first 2 hours to keep it moist. The sauce has a bit of a teriyaki taste, and no one I serve this to can seem to get enough of it! Awesome! My husband said to make sure I put the recipe in a "safe place" for repeated use! :)

This is an excellent recipe. I normally use a 1 ½ to 2 pound pork tenderloin but I still DOUBLE the herb rub and TRIPLE the sauce. For best results do not substitute for the sage. It makes this recipe. I also use prepared minced garlic out of a jar. Much easier and I think the garlic flavor is better.  Not sure were the 3 hour cooking time comes from, but it doesn’t matter. I bake in a convection oven which goes much faster. Simply use a good meat thermometer and take it out at 150 and rest covered with foil for 15 minutes. I cut into small medallions and serve over jasmine rice. Drizzle some extra sauce over the pork and rice before serving.

Can you rate this higher than 5 stars was the question my brother asked when I served this to his family last night.  we did double the glaze and used brown sugar and balsamic vinagar as suggested.  I also jazzed up the rub a bit by adding onion powder and some garlic powder to the mix as well as the fresh garlic and rubbed sage.  We had a 3 lb pork loin and it took about 1 1/2 hours to cook.  I use an instant read themometer and it was reading 160 at the thickest part of the roast when I took it out. Don't forget to brush your glaze on during the last bit of cooking!  We made gravy from the pan drippings by adding about 1 cup water and corn starch as well as adjusting the flavor with salt and pepper.  You will not be disapointed!

This roast literally fell apart before the 3 hours were up!!! So tender. I used a roaster with a lid. I didn't have a rack to fit so I just cut up an onion in big chunks and placed under the roast. I didn't have soy sauce so I used teriyaki and I also used red wine vinegar instead of the white. I had to stop my husband from devouring the entire roast! **Note from my BH&G Cookbook** Pork cooked with bacon, spinach, tomatoes or onion will sometimes remain pink even when well done so use the meat thermometer to ensure doneness.

delicious!  my roast was 2 lb. and took about 1 hr. 45 min. to cook.  i used the same amount of seasoning for my small roast, doubled the garlic, and doubled the sauce.  i also substituted brown sugar for white, plus a little honey until just the sweetness i liked, and some sesame seeds.  the BEST addition i made was to add some sriracha (asian chili sauce) to the sauce, and that seemed to balance it perfectly- sweet, sour, and spicy.  our 2 lb. roast was gone in about 15 minutes, with 2 adults and 2 kids.  i will make this over and over again!

This was by far the best roast I have ever had! It was soooo juicy and the flavours fit perfectly!

I did make some changes though just for my personal taste and for what I had onhand:
- added some rosemary to the rub
- used 2 tbsp. of flour instead of the 1 tbsp. of cornstarch (Betty Crocker's suggested substitution!)

And I let the glaze boil a little longer so it was quite thick- I prefer a really thick glaze as opposed to a runny one!

I recommend this recipe to anyone- so easy and SOOOO delicious!

i'll admit that i was skeptical at first, but it actually turned out great!  even my pork-hating husband enjoyed it.  a tip for using up the leftover pork & glaze:  chop up the pork, throw in a can of pineapple chunks and some chopped green pepper.  add the glaze when everything's warm and then serve that mixture over cooked jasmine rice-- so good!

I've cooked this as a roast and as tenderloin.  Tenderloin is much better!  I used 1lb tenderloin, kept the sauce and herb measurements the same.  Changed with brown sugar and balsamic vineger.  Cooked 1hr at 325.  To die for!  Especially over white rice!!!

This recipe is a good template, but has a lot more depth and flavor if you use brown sugar and balsamic vinegar. Also double the water in the sauce. With those adjustments 5 stars

Wow!!!  This takes the place of my former favorite pork tenderloin recipe "Maple-Garlic Marinated Pork Tenderloin".  I used balsamic vinegar but this is the only substitution I made for the glaze and I'm glad.  I also used 2 pork tenderloins (2.5 lbs. total) instead of a pork loin roast which significantly reduces the cooking time.  The glaze is absolutely delicious.  I cooked it in 9 x 13 pan lined with heavy duty foil.  At the end of the cooking time I poured the remainder of the glaze over the meat.  Once it was sliced, I returned it to the cooking pan with the glaze to serve.  I will make this one again and again.  UPDATE: I've made this MANY times and have found that the amount of sugar can be reduced to just a little over 1/4 cup and it is still wonderful.

The rub and sauce are delicious!!!  I doubled the rub (except for salt/pepper) and the sauce, and then followed all the recommendation of the most highly rated review. S/he has some good suggestions, like rolling the pork in the rub etc. Spooning instead of brushing the roast with the sauce so as not to rub off the spices... BUT!!! DO NOT put the roast on a rack!!! Pork loin tends to be dry and NEEDS to roast in it's own juices.  I have made this twice, the first time I baked it on a rack, and it so SO DRY! the second time I followed the recipe exactly in regard to cooking method and it was AWESOME. Everyone thinks they are a culinary wizard on this site, and many times the tips are great, but I have ruined to many a good recipe following others advice. I will make this again... but ignore what the reviewers have to say on this one!!!!

This was AMAZING! I used a 2lb roast, doubled the rub, added some onion powder, and minced garlic, and doubled the sauce as suggested. I also used a ladle to pour glaze generously over the roast 3-4 times during the last 1/2 hour of cooking, as opposed to brushing it on so as not to lose any of the rubbed seasoning, as suggested in a previous review. After taking the roast out I grabbed about 1/4 cup pf the drippings and added them to the remaining glaze mixture with a cup of water and heated on stove top for about 8-10 minutes for a delicious and light "gravy" to use on the potatoes I made as a side. This was SOOOO delicious that my husband and I couldn't stop picking at it the entire night - even when it was cold from the fridge! With the right knife to cut this thin, this meat would make EXCELLENT sandwich meat!!! Definitely a keeper for my family!

So this was the first time i have ever made a pork roast and it turned out amazing.  But i did make a few minor changes.  First i used a 2lb roast.  I doubled the sage (wish i would have tripled)and doubled the sauce.  I also added about 2 tbls of minced garlic to the sauce as well.  I cut slits in the meat and put garlic in.  I rubbed sage on and let sit in the fridge for about an hour.  Then i cooked it at 325 for an hour in a 9 X 13 pan covered in tinfoil. then i took off foil and basted every 10 minutes for another 40 minutes.  Turned out EXCELLENT.  Even had extra sauce for dipping.  I highly recommend it.

Outstanding!  Super simple and the entire family, including two preschoolers, absolutely loved it.  The sauce is just delish and would be great on chicken or beef, too.  I poked holes all over my roast and really covered it in the rub before roasting, then followed the rest of the directions exactly.  Since I fixed it for a week night, I cooked it two hours the night before, then finished off the third hour with the sauce prep on the second night and served it.  Pretty enough and yummy enough for a company dish.  THANKS for a great recipe that will be a family favorite!! (Update - life intervened tonight and I had to serve the pork roast without making the sauce at all.  It was still delicious and moist with the meat juices drizzled on top when I plated.  This is a no-fail recipe!)

I just finished eating and it was delicious! The glaze is really amazing and it makes the pork not so dry; this is not a boring pork roast, very casual and versatile. I ate with potatoes and green beans, but this a recipe that would also be amazing with fried rice and egg rolls sice it has an teryaki taste to it. I recommend it; cheap and easy if you're a pork roast rookie like me.

Amazing!!!  My hubby raved about this!  The whole family loved it.  The only thing I did different was cook it in a slow cooker for about 8 hours.  Put the glaze on with about 3 hours left.  Delish!!!

Everyone at the table gave this 5 stars! I had a 3 1/2 lb roast so I had to shorten the cooking time a little, I used the amount of sage/salt and pepper as per the recipe but I used 3 cloves of garlic in the rub--not sure if the spices would have been enough for a 5lb roast. I also used balsamic vinegar in the glaze and low sodium soy sauce--I doubled the sauce so we would have a little extra to dip in.

I made this for the second time tonight. The first time was for my in-laws. I ended up not having white sugar, so I used brown sugar. It was amazing. They raved about it and I reluctantly shared the recipe!! This time I didn't have plain vinegar, only malt vinegar. Used that, and it was still amazing! Both times I just threw the pork in the crock pot, rubbed seasonings on it, then drizzled the sauce to cover. Let it cook on high for about 6 hours, turning once half-way through.. fall-apart delicious! My picky daughter even loves it!! Don't think I'll ever try a different way to cook a pork roast. This is it!

This pork was GREAT!  Very tender and very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar.  I had a 4.5-lb roast and it took only 2 hours to get to 175 so take note!  I would definitely make this again.

I give this 5 stars for two reasons: Ease of preparation and great flavor.  This recipe includes staple items and takes hardly any prep at all which is great for a busy mom with 2 toddlers tugging at my legs (literally :-).  Tip: I agree that you should double the sauce and pour over after slicing and I used honey instead of sugar per another reviewer-it was great. Oh and I used balsalmic vinegar instead of plain.

Great recipe! I didn't have sage so I used oregano and I used red wine vinegar for the vinegar.  It was delicious.  Makes a lot though.

This recipe was a winner!! I had to alter some ingredients based on what I had on hand so I used poultry seasoning in place of sage and ponzu/teriyaki sauces in place of the soy sauce. I also only used a 3 pound roast. I doubled the glaze recipe and added quartered apples in with the pork. I also lined the bottom with sliced onion so the roast could sit on it and cook.  Oh, and I cooked it for about 2.5 hours and it was a perfect medium and so tender. It was delicious!!! My toddlers all asked for seconds and thirds and every plate at the table was empty. That NEVER happens! I will definitely be putting this one into the rotation.

This made an exceptionally good meal.  I prepared the recipe as-is.  I did find that it cooked much faster than anticipated, and seemed that it transitioned from approx 140F to 170F in a matter of minutes.  Suffice it to say that I did slightly over-cook the pork loin, but it made no difference in the flavor, and with the extra sauce, was plenty juicy enough.  Next time, I will monitor it more closely once it approaches the 140 mark.

I would advise preparing extra sauce for the table as it, alone, is a big hit.  I added approx 1/4C drippings to the sauce before serving.

I make this at least twice a month.  Very good.  I do substitute brown sugar for the white and I use apple cider vinegar. I also cut slits all over the roast and insert garlic slivers. I double the seasonings since i like a well seasoned roast. Be careful of the cooking time.  I used a smaller roast and it was done in 1.5 hours.

Fabulous flavor! Cooks way faster than 3 hours so keep that in mind and use a meat thermometer.

My husband, son (2 1/2yrs) and I loved this recipe.  The only change I did was used a 2lb roast -since their are only 2.5 of us.  I made the full amount of rub and sauce.  I loved the sauce and the leftovers was GREAT over rice.

I gave it four stars because the herb rub and sauce were awesome and I will totally make it again, but the cook time is way off.  I followed the recipe exactly (my loin was 5 1/3 lbs.)  and it reached 145 degrees after 1 hour!  It put me in a bind as I had company coming and it was done WAY too early.  I turned the oven way down to 'warm' and hoped it wouldn't over cook.  It did, but not by much.  Still edible, but dry.  Beware if you have company coming.  Use a meat thermometer and keep an eye on it.

This was fantastic.  Per reviews, I doubled herbs and rubbed over a 4.4 lb. tenderloin.  Then I browned it, cut it in two crosswise, and put it in the fridge overnight.  I woke up at 5 a.m. so put it into my slow cooker on low.  I also doubled the sauce but it was not necessary.  By noon, it was cooked to perfection and sliced nicely.  I filled a pitcher and served the sauce as au jus.  Company raved about it.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.

Oh yeah, this is fabulous!  My roast was small - only 2 pounds - so it was ready in 1 1/2 hours.  I used others suggestion of using brown sugar instead of white, and balsamic vinegar.  I made the full amount of glaze even with the smaller roast and we used it to dip.  Absolutely delicious!

Nice and easy, but looks impressive when served.  The vinegar gives it an interesting flavor you don't get every day.  I used a white wine vinegar, which seemed to work well.  I also used a much smaller piece of pork (1.5lb), as I'm only cooking for two.  It was ready in about 2 hours.  I used the same amount of the other ingredients though, so it was nice and flavorful.  I almost think the herbs wouldn't have been enough for the suggested 5lb roast.

Incredible....very good! Cooked to 160 deg F and it was very moist and thoroughly cooked. Smells wonderful while roasting. Used brown sugar in my glaze/basting and it was excellent.
Got rave reviews from our guests! Will do again soon.

This recipe was fabulous!  The sage/garlic mixture gave a very nice flavour - but not at all overpowering.  The sauce was good, but I added a bit of ground ginger to it for a bit of an extra kick - it was delicious.

This was the best pork loin I have made to date.  The sauce was awesome.  You could even shred the pork and use the sauce as more of a pulled pork sandwich...it was great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this Pork Loin for Christmas Day at my In-laws. I was a little intimidated because my Mother In Law is a WONDERFUL cook but this pork loin was gobbled up. I will definitely use this again. I did tweak the recipe a little bit, I used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar in the place of white vinegar and white sugar for the glaze that I doubled.

Yum! I used a 3 lb. loin and it took about 1-1/2 hrs to bake. I added extra garlic because we love it and cider vinegar because I was out of the regular. So easy and delicious!

I made this for dinner tonight and my family loved it. I decided to try it in a slow cooker instead of the oven. I also made a few changes to the recipe after reading the other reviews.  I used balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, and 1/4 cup white sugar - 1/4 cup brown sugar. I browned the roast first, mixed all the ingredients together and poured it over the pork.  I also sliced a medium onion and added baby carrots as well. It cooked all day and the house smelled great, the taste was wonderful and the pork was sooooo tender!! Great recipe - it is a keeper!

Sooooo good, and easy too! I used a 1 1/2 pound pork butt, changed the corn startch to flour and went with brown sugar over white. Kept the sauce and seasoning amounts the same. 

The combination of sage and that sauce is just magicical. YUM! I'm eating the leftovers as we speak.

I used the ingredients of a recipe for 8, but used a 2 1/4 pound roast instead.  I doubled the spices, rubbed it, then let it marinate in the spices for 5 hours.  I made 2 batches of the sauce, both with only half the sugar, but the first without the cornstarch.  I would soak the herb-crusted roast every 1/2 hour it cooked.  The thickened batch was set aside, and each sliced piece of meat was dipped before being placed on the plate.  AWESOME!!!!!

Very good! Don't bother marinading it! I have made this several times and I now just cook the pork with the seasonings and make the sauce as stated-minus the marinade step.  Instead, I use the sauce as a dip for the meat.  Had leftover pork and sauce.  Used it to make sandwiches by thinly slicing the meat and topping with provolone/swiss cheese.  Heated until cheese was melted.  Used the reheated sauce to dip the sandwich. Will make again (and will double the sauce for the leftovers).

AMAZING!  I followed the advice to use brown sugar and balsamic vinegar in the glaze and used a meat thermometer to determine when the loin was done.  The result was fabulous-tender, flavorful and it looked nice on the platter as well.  I will be making this again for sure.

This is a fantastic recipe. I read MANY MANY comments before I started and this is what I did: I had a smaller (2lb) pork top loin roast and I doubled both the rub and the glaze. For the glaze I used balsamic vinegar instead of regular white. I had dark brown sugar so I did half and half with the white sugar. I also took a little (maybe 1/4 c of the water and added the cornstartch to that to make a slurry. Then I added the slurry to the mix in the saucepan to avoid clumps. My roasting time was about 1.5 hours total, due to the smaller cut of meat. That's it. Oh, and I covered the pan with foil until I was ready to start glazing, in order to ensure that the meat stayed moist. I then finished the rest of the time in the oven uncovered. SUPER YUMMY!!!

I followed this recipe, using a 6 lb roast and it was wonderful fixed this way.  It was ready in a little less than 3 hours.  The sauce is so good, I'm glad I followed the advice of some other reviewers and tripled it.   I will definitely be making this again. Next time, though, I will line my baking pan with foil because that sauce really sticks!

This is good. I did a 1.15 pound tenderloin. Ended up being in the oven for exactly an hour, temping out at 155. I am not an experienced chef and this one was really delicious and fairly simple for me to do. I can't wait to make it for my mother to impress her. :-D

wow-nice pork roast-hubby and I really liked the glaze. Will make this again and also try it on chicken. I doubled the glaze-used brown sugar instead of white, a bit of honey,325* for 1 hr and 20 min-2 1/2 lb roast.Let it rest for 15 min covered in warm oven-200* while I waited for hubby to get home. I rolled the roast in the herb mixture,but next time will use the same casserole pan.It came out moist,and that was uncovered the whole time-nice- crusty a bit. I even sprinkled a drizzle of olive oil on the herb mix. very good meal.

I doubled the ingredients for the rub. Also, I love garlic, so I put two sliced cloves in slits in the meat, and two minced cloves on top. I also added garlic powder and a bit of onion powder to the rub. The glaze was just really sweet, nothing spectacular. I don't know why people raved so much. I doubled the recipe for that too, using brown sugar. and I added 2 tsp of chili paste. That made it sweet with a bit of zip. More chili paste would have been fine. All in all I was quite happy with it.

Amazingly good.  I waited until my pork reached 170, and it was so moist.

This was absolutely wonderful!! I actually ate half of it myself before I even served dinner (my husband wasn't home yet...shhhh). I used rice wine vinegar and it melded perfectly with the other flavors. My tenderloins totaled a little over 2 pounds, but I used the rub and sauce quantities as listed for the 5 pounder and it seemed perfect to me. My cooking time was between 1 and 1.5 hours for mine. I checked it a little late and it was already over "done" temp, yet it was still moist, juicy and delicious! Would not hesitate to make again, serve to company or recommend to a friend!

A favorite in our house! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and use balsamic vinegar for the sauce instead of regular vinegar and I also use fresh sage and insert it in to slits along the top of the pork loin. Yum!

I tried the balsamic vinegar substition suggested by another reviewer and we did not like the sauce that way at all.  We did really enjoy the spices on the meat though (I served the sauce separately).  The kids each had several servings!

The best pork roast I have made yet! I tried it in our crock pot, adding a watered down version of the glaze (minus the corn starch), and it worked very well.

This is an AWESOME recipe - probably the best thing I have cooked in a long time!!  I did make a few changes.  I let the roast sit in the fridge with the rub for about 6 hours.  I doubled all of the spices and used Garlic Garlic by Tastefully Simple instead of a garlic clove.  I cooked the roast with foil until about the last 45 minutes and then basted with the glaze every 15 minutes.  I think the total cooking time was about 2 hours & 20 minutes (the roast was just under 3 lbs).  I doubled the glaze and used apple cider vinegar vs regular vinegar.  This was the most juiciest/moist piece of meat I have ever made!!  The whole family raved - thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe!  I too used balsamic vinegar and brown sugar.  I also added 1/4 cup of ruby port wine.  My wife, who normally does not like sweet sauces with meat, thought this was a "keeper".  Next time I will probably cover the roast to keep it more moist.

Made this last night and couldn't believe how well the flavors worked together.  It was delicious!

I used a 4.5# pork loin and only cooked it for 2 hours, then added the glaze and cooked for an additional 30 min.  It was completely done but still tender.

I also took the advice of others and doubled the spices & the glaze (I'm glad I did because it's excellent over rice!) and substituted brown sugar and balsalmic vinegar.

Extremely good!  Thank you!

This was wonderful! My husband and children loved it. I've made it twice now and last time I substituted teriyaki sauce for the soy since I was out and it was just as good, gave it a little asian flair. I will definately make this one for years to come.

My family enjoyed this for dinner last night.  I changed the vinegar to apple cider vinegar, and I didn't have any sage so I used poultry seasoning instead.  It was amazing.  I was so tired of pork before this,  you see my husband is allergic to chicken.  So it is pork night around here a lot.  lol.

This was FANTASTIC! I would double the sauce recipe, I have a daughter who likes to "Dip" things and I myself am a sauce person. This was a quick throw together meal for me after work. Keep in mind you have to cook your meat for 3 hours though. I served this with sauteed green beans with mushrooms and parmesan cheese and rice. Great combo! Will make this again! Thanks for the AWESOME recipe!

This was super simple to put together. Used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar to make 2x the sauce. The pork was put in a slow cooker for 6 hrs but think I'd like to try the oven next time. I like the leftover suggestion of adding pepper and pineapples.

Simply delicious! You can't mess this one up! I used a pork shoulder roast. I also seared the roast on all sides before baking. I seasoned the roast after searing. I did not use the sauce in the recipe, I had a spicy orange glaze that I wanted to use instead. The temp was 160 when I removed. The roast was very juicy and tender.

Well worth the 3 hours! I had run out of sage, so instead used mediterranean spiced sea salt instead. Also did not have cornstarch for the glaze, but used your standard 2 table spoons to 1/4 cup cold water, and all turned great! My guy defiantly loved it.

In my 22 years of marriage, I have never prepared a pork loin because we just don't care for any we have tried.  I was surprised when my wife brought this one home and asked me to find a recipe and cook it for her.  It is the best we've had and we will make it again.  Next time I will double the rub just because I didn't get the coverage I wanted to, but it was still great as written.  Perfect!!!

Really good.  Took the advice of a few others here and doubled the sauce and used it over rice.  My roast was about 2.5lbs, and it took about an hour and a half to cook from start to finish.  The sauce is REALLY sweet, so next time I make this, I will probably cut it by half, but all 4 of my kids ate this, and the hubby raved.  Thanks Wendee!

This was a very moist and tasty pork roast.  I used Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar instead of plain vinegar and it added a great flavor.  I didn't have a rack to put under the roast so I wadded up some foil to set it on.  I couldn't stand the dry pan so I put a can of beef broth into it and covered the roast during the first 2 hours of cooking.  I then turned up the heat to 375 and did several basting's with the glaze during the last hour.  Great flavor...WILL make this again=D

This is the BEST pork roast i have EVER made! I made a few changes suggested by others, i doubled the rub and tripled the sauce (i had a 3lb roast). I used balsamic vinegar and ,splenda instead of sugar (to make this South Beach Diet Friendly!). Im a little leary of roasting pork because i do not have a meat thermometer and i often overcook it because i'm paranoid about under cooking it :) So, i decided id try it in a slow cooker instead. I rubbed the roast and then seared it well in olive oil. i placed aluminum foil balls, halved onions and some whole garlic cloves in the bottom and placed to roast on top. I then drizzled it with the leftover oil from the pan, and put just enough chicken broth in to cover the bottom of the crock pot then glazed with about 1/4c sauce. Every couple of hours i glazed with another 1/4c sauce. I just cut off a tiny piece to try it and it is SOOO good i ended up eating 2 slices! i dipped it in the extra sauce..mmmmm...i cant say enough about this roast. I was a little worried about using balsamic vinegar (i'm not normally a huge fan) but its amazing! I made some sticky rice to go with it for my kids and hubby, i can only imagine how good it would be over rice. I'm definitely gong to add this to my dinner rotation!

This recipe has been the best pork roast recipe that I have come across yet!! Thanks so much, it was a total hit with the entire family. The only change I made was instead of using regular salt, I used sea salt, only because that is my husbands favorite spice. I will definitely use this one more often and even pass it on. It is also one of the easiest I have encountered as well! KUDO'S to you!!

Wonderful!  Even my husband who "wasn't hungry" ate more than half the loin!  I will definately double the sauce next time. I followed a previous review and took the loin out when it reached 150 degrees and let it sit for 10 mins.  Perfect!

I did really like this recipe. The garlic was really good. I was worried because it looked like the seasonings and garlic were getting really burnt. But it all came together nicely. This was also my first time making a glaze and I was really surprised by how nice it looked and how simple it was to make.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  It was fantastic!  I have never tasted better pork.  It was so moist and tender!  I served it with the Creamy Twice Baked potatoes from this website.  I followed the advice of previous users and put a small amount of water in the bottom of the roasting pan.  I used brown sugar instead of regular sugar and balsamic vinegar instead of regular vinegar.  I covered the roast for the first hour and then uncovered it and started basting it with the glaze during the second hour.  I knew I did a good job when my mother-in-law complimented me on the recipe and even asked to take home leftovers!  This recipe is a real keeper and I know one that my family will ask for again.

This was really really good!  I've never done any kind of pork roast but got one for a good price and had to do something with it.  The glaze and the rub combined wonderfully and the results were so good!  I used a 3.5 pound bone-in pork roast and cooked it for about 2 hours.  The result was tender and very flavorful.  Will definitely make this again.

My three year old dumped in an entire cup of dried sage, but the recipe still turned out great.  I'm looking fwd to trying again with a more reasonable amount of sage.

It only took 1 and 1/2 hours to cook, glad I kept checking the temp, in the last ten minutes it jumped from 135 to 175... delighted it still turned out juicy and tasty after all my mistakes.

my wife loved this dish, I would definitely triple the rub next time. I wouldn't use olive oil in the rub next time though because the glaze didn't stick as well. I cooked it until the temp was 150F which took about 1hr 10 min for a 2.75 lb roast. I also used balsamic vinegar

I made this for my family for my fiancé's and brother's birthday dinner, served it with apple sauce, scalloped potatoes and garden salad, and everyone loved it. The plate was empty! People were fighting over the scraps on the plate!!

I made the recipe as is the first time, but I used 2 tbsp of flour instead of cornstarch, and I kept the cover on until I started basting it in the sauce. It was nice and moist, even after 3 hours in the oven.

I am making this again today, but I rubbed all the spices on the roast, and then put it in the fridge for the day while I went to work. Also, this time I am going to use brown sugar instead of white, and use some dripping in place of the water in the sauce.

Very good recipe, that is definitely a keeper!

This was sooooo good.  I was afraid we would not like the sauce - but I was wrong.  We loved it.  I made the brazilian rice recipe to go with it and the sauce was wonderful on the rice too.  Make sure to make extra sauce.

I used a 2# roast, doubled the pepper (personal pref.).  Didn't have fresh garlic so used 1 t. garlic powder.  For a 5# roast, I might double all the spices.  As another suggested, rolled the roast in the mixture right in the glass dish I used.  I did double the sauce using brown sugar and cider vinegar.  I only had 3 T. soy sauce so used 1 T. fish sauce (I know that maybe doesn't sound good but it was!)  We just kept going back for more.  Had to stop so we'd get a second meal out of it!  The sauce is to die for!!!  I was afraid it would be too sweet but it was slightly, perfectly sweet with a great tang to it.  Served over rice.  A very easy, fantastic keeper!  Thank you!

Fabulous! I got nothing but raves with this dish. Only changes for me were, I used balsalmic vinegar (it is what I had on hand). I doubled the sauce (smart move as the sauce was devoured). I also used my rotisserie on my gas grill and cooked about 20 minutes per pound. Thanks for a great recipe.

Quite good. Like other reviewers, I found this was only enough sauce for a 1-2 lb loin roast. I also substituted dark brown sugar for the sugar and 2 tbsp of flour for the cornstarch. I used my convection oven rotisserie and it came out lovely. I am going to use this  sauce/glaze as a base to experiment a bit. EXCELLENT start.

Delicious!  The sage gave the pork a very nice flavor.  I used balsamic vinegar and the sauce got very syrup like after cooking for a few minutes.  My roast was 2 1/2 lbs and I ended up throwing away a little more than half the sauce.  I cooked it for about 1 1/2 hours using a meat thermometer to avoid under or over cooking.  The glaze stayed on the roast nicely and it didn't really need basting more than 2 or 3 times.  I added a little white wine just prior to basting for the first time so my pan wasn't too much of a mess.  The wine, along with the glaze and juices from the meat, made a nice gravy.  My picky husband even liked it, so this one is a keeper!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the best pork roast recipe I've tried. I followed the other reviews and used brown sugar and chicken broth instead of water. I added carrots and would have added potatoes but I was in the mood to give this an asian flair so I made fried rice. It was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I will make it again.

We had this for dinner last night and it was wonderful.  I used balsamic vinegar and brown sugar.  I also used fresh sage and an extra clove of garlic.  I loved the sauce!  It has a similar taste to the sesame chicken sauce that I order from our local chinese delivery.  Next time I may add a little ginger and some sesame seeds to make it a little more chinese.  I bet this sauce would be good on chicken dipped in tempura and fried as well.  Mmmm...Thanks a bunch for the recipe!

I used this as a base for cooking a 5 lb. "pork loin rib end" (rib roast) my sister had bought for a family Easter dinner. Because people had reported varying cooking times, and because it had to be tender enough for my 90-year-old mother to chew, I opted for the slow cooker.

I doubled the spices, as most recommended, rinsed the roast, patted it dry, and applied the rub.  When the roast was liberally coated with spices, I had half of them left over! If people double the spices, I don't know what they do with them. No olive oil; a dry rub worked fine. I braised the roast, as I always do for the slow cooker.

For the slow cooker, several observations.  Unlike when basting the roast with the sauce, the slow cooker cooks the tang out of the vinegar; instead of a sweet-and-sour sauce, you'll end up with a sweet sauce.  If that's not what you're after, cut the sugar in half.

I used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar (half).  I diced a large onion in the bottom of the pot, then diced two large apples over the onions, added the pork, and poured the sauce over it. After removing the roast, and while it was resting, I mashed the apples into the sauce, which didn't require further thickening.  Since it's more of a sauce than a gravy,  I served it over Near East Herb Garlic pilaf rather than potatoes.

It was a huge hit.  Everybody wanted the leftovers, and an hour after cleanup, my mother was still muttering about how delicious it was. Only 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe.

This recipe simply ROCKS! (I applied this to a regular roast, not a loin)and fantastic results ensued.   I advise checking your temp at 2 hours.. depending on the size of your roast.

This was a great base recipe. I made this twice, the first time as the recipe was written but found it too sweet. The second time I made it I cut the sugar back to two-thirds of what was called for while I mixed white and brown sugar. In addition I added minced onion extra garlic and crushed red pepper.

This was amazing. Used my slow cooker to make a pork roast. Then added the glaze for the last hour. Everyone loved it and asked for more. Used the extra glaze to make my gravy!! Delicious. Making it again with a pork tenderloin right now.

I followed the directions. Great flavor. Cooking time is about 30 min too long for internal temp.

EXCELLENT recipe!   This is a keeper!!!!   I used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar and used vegetable stock instead of water.  Then I cooked it in the crockpot.    I will, however, halve the vinegar next time so that I can make gravy as it was too strong.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I thought this recipe was excellent! The only I changes made was using a 2.5 lb roast and tripling the amount of spices. Cook time for my smaller roast was 2 hours. Served it with buttery mashed potatoes. Delicious!!!

This is an excellent recipe for the family or guests. I used a 2 1/2 pound roast and baked it at 325 degrees until the meat thermometer registered 145 degrees. I basted it frequently and the color was beautiful. Note: a foil liner will save you a lot of clean-up time as the sugary glaze will really stick to the pan like melted candy! I did increase the garlic to two cloves, but kept everything else in the rub the same.  For the glaze I used a raspberry balsamic vinegar but kept everything else the same. The flavor was fantastic. Just a warning, this glaze when used for the "gravy or sauce" is extremely sweet. Although delicious, I would recommend caution in just pouring it on your finished meat, a drizzle on the slices is all you really need. Yum, yum. I served this with Pecan Rice, a recipe from this site, and green beans - Looked beautiful on the plate.

followed recipe exactly.  I doubled the sauce, no need to. Boil it for a long time until it is thick.  Made with roasted potatoes.

I loved this pork roast. It was tender and tasty and easy to make.  I doubled the sauce but other than that I made it exactly as the recipe stated.

I have made this twice now. I didn't alter any of the ingredients; only the cooking time the second go around. The first time I went by the recipe, but it was too done. The second time at 1-1/2 hours the themometer was already at 140 degrees, so I just turned off the oven and took a nap. After the oven was cool, we took it out and cut it and it was heaven!

I don't think that it was the recipe's fault, but we couldn't eat this.  The meat had a really weird, soft texture to it.  The glaze made for a very pretty presentation, however.  I guess that I would try it again on a different type of roast.

OMG good - my loin was only 3 pounds but I made the full rub and sauce recipe.  it was fantastic.  this is definitely a keeper!!

just a note - I don't have plain soy sauce (never do) my "basic" soy sauce is Tamari Soy Sauce, has more flavor.  It is in the Asian section at Kroger.

i wish i could give this 10 stars!
i made this last night when i was having my church's youth pastor and his family over for dinner. bro mike (as we all call him) told me i'm not a cook but a chef. that's the first time i've ever been told that! and his 2 children cleaned their plates too!
i made some changes (as i usually tend to do). i probably tripled the recipe for the spice rub. i used a pork shoulder as that was what i had on hand. i used ground sage for the same reason. i also added a packet of brown gravy mix, some water and olive oil to make a nice paste. i didn't make any changes to the glaze. this pork roast was fork-tender, juicy and extremely flavorful! i served it with cinnamon glazed sweet potatoes (found here in the website). made a great combination! i will be making this again for sure!

So good! I doubled the dry rub for my tenderloin. I've made this twice now and liked the glaze better with brown sugar as some other reviewers recommended. Also, if cooking a tenderloin, you only need to cook for around 30 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice.  I did use more of the rub ingredients than the recipe called for but I wanted a depth to the flavor.  I also let the pork loin rest for about an hour after applying the rub.  I really enjoyed the tangy sauce.

Wonderfully tender and tasty!!  I couldn't find a pork loin roast so I bought 3.5 pounds of carnitas, which I first seared in a skillet with canola oil, and which baked in the oven just a bit overdone in 1.5 hours.  Next time I'll bake for 1.25 hours. The sauce was excellent. I did use brown sugar instead of white, as other reviewers suggested.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Excellent! I did make some changes. I brushed the roast with olive oil then rolled it in a pan filled with double the amount of seasoning (plus I added garlic salt and onion salt). I cut up two extra cloves of garlic and inserted pieces into slits I made in the roast. I then lined the roaster with foil and put in the roast, fat side up. I cooked it until it was 120 degrees F, then poured half of the sauce over it (I did not brush it on) and put it back in the oven until it was 155 degrees F. I then poured the rest of the sauce over top before serving. Like most reviewers, I had doubled the sauce - I also used balsamic vinegar instead of regular, and used brown sugar instead of white. I cooked the roast with the cover on for the full cooking time.

All the rave reviews had me excited to try this recipe, but I was disappointed with the end result. Because of several reviews, I doubled the sauce, but the sauce was too sweet and greatly camouflaged the pork. It would have been better with just the pork drippings.

I doubled the seasoning (personal preference) and baked @ 350 until meat therometer read 145.  I also doubled the sauce for basting and to drizzle on top for serving.  Let the meat rest for about 30 mins, sliced and served with rice.  This was simply delicious.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.  This is definitely going into our dinner rotation.  My husband wants me to try the sauce with chicken as well.

5 Stars!!! Awesome receipe, love the flavors! My roast was just under 3 lbs and only took 2 hours to cook. I cooked it to 160 degress but will do to 150 next time, but it was still awesome! I doubled rub seasoning and sauce seasoning. I put a little water in bottom of roasting pan which made for an awesome base for a dark brown and tangy gravy I made when it was done.  I started basting with sauce after first 1/2 hour and did it several times.  Will make this over and over!!!

Definitely a FIVE star recipe...I bravely prepared this pork roast the first time for Christmas Dinner, everyone raved! I quadrupled all of the ingredients, and we used every bit of the sauce left over from basting...my guests requested MORE SAUCE, and  spooned it on like gravy. Next time, I will serve it with rice....yum!

I was never a big pork fan until now! Bought a sliced pork roast on clearance and didn't know what to do with it. Tried this recipe and was impressed, a Monday night run of the mill dinner tasted like an expensive celebratory meal. I doubled the rub and added some vegetable oil to make the herbs spread better. I rubbed the herbs on each side of the pork slices, put each slice in a single layer in a 13X9 baking dish, covered with foil, and baked for three hours. As for the glaze, I used brown sugar in place of white, and used red wine garlic vinegar because it's what I had on hand. I served the glaze on the side because my daughter didn't care for the glaze but it totally made the pork loin special. Will pull her slice of pork out next time and glaze the rest as called for! Served with scalloped potatoes and onions from this site, along with simple green beans. So GOOD!

This was my first attempt at cooking any type of pork, and it turned out great! In my past experiences, pork has been dry and flavorless- not this recipe! I had a little over a 2 pound pork loin, so I doubled the recipe. I followed everything exactly with the exception of sneaking some extra garlic in there. My roast was done after about 1hr 45min. I also didn't have a roasting pan, but my glass casserole dish seemed to do the trick. Picky husband loved this too! Can't wait to make it again.

Absolutely fantastic!!!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  It is definitely a do-again recipe in our household.  The meat is also excellent on buns.

I cooked to 145 degrees and it was sooo tender.  Loved the loin but didn't care for the glaze.  I had a 3.4 lb. loin and cut it into 3 pieces and trimmed the fat leaving me with three 1 lb. pieces.  
Went a bit light on the sage to be on the safe side.  But used the same portions of rub and glaze for the 1 lb.  Not overpowering, just right.  A keeper.

This a killer recipe. I too multiplied the ingredients by 3 and it was perfect. Cooked at 350 for 1 1/2hrs for a 2 lb. I added onions and carrots to the bottom and put the roast on it. So good.

This one is a keeper! I've made this several times and it always turns out nice. The spices are great and the meat is tender and flavorful!  45-90 minute cook time. Thermometer check your meat.

I'm not one to measure when it comes to spices, but used an ample amount of sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder and sage on two small tenderloins.  For the sauce, I used balsamic and brown sugar per other reviews, and added siracha sauce for a little kick.  Roasted the tenderloins uncovered on a broiler pan for 45 mins, basting with the sauce the last 15 mins.  Then basted them with more sauce and transferred to a warming drawer for a few hours before serving.  Excellent!

I used Butterflied Pork Loins because it's just two of us so I cut the servings to 2.  Excellent!  Added a little onion powder to the rub and chopped green onions to the top.  I LOVED THIS RECIPE!

This was delicious!  I cooked mine in the crock pot  (high for 2 hrs. then low for 6) and it turned out wonderfully.  Thanks for the best way to cook pork loin - I've been looking for a long time.

My pork finished in about 1 hour.  I turned the oven off and left it in the warm oven covered for the next 2 hours- it was for a dinner party.  15 min before, I turned the temp back up- still came out warm and moist.  Best pork I have ever eaten.

Delicious. Cut up an onion and embedded all I could in the meat. I put the rest in the rub and it tasted great. Next time I might fry some mushrooms and bake them with this as well.

Very good roast.  I used a 5 1/2lbs. pork loin so I doubled the rub and the sauce.  The sauce would make a good stir-fry or teriyaki sauce.    The cooking time does seem to be a bit off.  It only took about 1 1/2 hours at 325 to get to 155 on the meat thermometer.  A good rule of thumb for pork roast is 20 minutes for every 1 pound.

Absolutely delish! Had to make my mothers  birthday dinner and had a huge cut of pork and no idea how to make it special. The sauce is a hit! Everyone took seconds. Like others did, I used apple cider vinegar. its always been moms way to cook a roast by cutting a few cloves of garlic and stuffing it into the meat about half way. Salt and pepper the meat and mmm mmm good. Thanks for a sucessful family dinner! This dish will go into my rotation.

OMG!!  For time restraints and only needing to feed my husband, my 15 month old, and me, I made a 2.5lb roast... but I wish I had made a 5lb.  It was fabulous!!  We loved the glaze soooo much! I used the full amount of rub (using 2 garlic cloves, instead of 1) and doubled the glazing sauce (using half white sugar and half brown sugar), based on what others have said.  I'm sure it would have been great as written, but we would have missed having the extra glaze!  Definitely a keeper.  Can't wait to make it again.  =)

Fantastic. I didn't have any sage, so I ground up some rosemary. I used apple cider for the vinegar. I used a 2 pound tenderloin and it roasted about 1 hour and 45 minutes...probably about 15 minutes too long because it turned out just a little bit dryer than I prefer. When I fix it the next time I'm going to double up on the sauce amount.

I didn't have cornstarch, but it wasn't a problem. This was amazing. First pork roast I"ve ever made and it was so juicy, the meat fell apart.  I made with colomban coca cola rice with raisins and a red cabbage slaw.  Very happy table.

This pork is so very good!!!  I think the 3 hrs at 325 would have dried this out so I cooked it 25-30 minutes at 450 and it was perfect and juicy!  The  sauce is amazing!  Loved this!

Followed the recipe for the glaze and rub exactly. The rub was good and the pork was tender and juicy however the glaze was too sweet. It's something I will try again with adjustments to make the glaze not as sweet.

Oh my!  I LOVE this glaze on this pork.  I didn't get mine glazed the last 30 minutes of cooking, so I glazed it as soon as it came out of the oven and  made sure I had enough to have some as a dipping sauce and I'm glad I did.  It is delicious!

I tripled the rub which made it a little strong. Next time I will only double it. I followed the recipe sauce exactly and it was wonderful. I will make this again and again.

5 stars - great recipe.  I didn't have sage so I added rosemary and tarragon.  It was still fantastic.  And the glaze was perfect!  My method of cooking is fast roasting at high heats.  I cooked a 3.5 lb. loin at 500 degrees for 45-50  minutes.  The meat thermometer reads a perfect 160 when the meat is done. the short quick time means the meat doesn't have time to dry out; stays so juicy and tender.  I've learned to cook all my roasts this way and will never go back to slow, 3 hour+ cooking (except for cheap, tough cuts of meat).  I highly recommend that this fast cooking method with this recipe and you will have a loin you can cut with a fork.

Made this last week, I used a 5 pound roast as suggested, however I did add onion powder,poultry seasoning, basil, oregano, and parsely (all dried) and a couple of dashes of red hot pepper. I also doubled the sauce and seasoning and added a hefty squeeze of honey to the glaze. No need to baste or add any form of oil or fat. After the pork was done I poured 1/2 of the glaze on (not wanting to disturb the crust from the seasoning) and turned my broiler on Lo and let the glaze get hard and caramalized (but not burnt!!!), then I let it sit on the counter fot 15min to cool down and poured the remaining glaze right over it. Slice and serve. Spectacular!!! I am going to culinary school and I plan to use this dish for one of my final exams, if I could have given this a much higher rating I definantly would! My family of four adults (39,38,21, and 18 {I am the 21 year old}) ate the whole thing and I couldn't stop eating the glaze while cooking it!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, God bless!   P.S.- I used this on chicken breast tonight and it was almsot as good as the pork and again I kept tasting the glaze over, and over... Delicious!!!

This was great. I did double the rub. The roast came out very moist and tender. I made a sandwich for lunch the next day. Yum! I may try using balsamic vinegar next time.

This turned out absolutely wonderful. My husband and brother were in love! I used balsamic vinegar but other than that followed the recipe. I don't eat pork, but everyone who tried this loved it..even the kids!

Ok people if you're gonna change the recipe then don't give the recipe a bad review! I loved this. It was incredible. My kids and husband ate it and I will make this again and again and again. Do not change a thing!

Outstanding roast.  Made it last night for a dinner party and everyone absolutely loved it.  They said it was like a pork prime rib.  It was so juicy I couldn't believe it.  I wish I had taken a picture before I cut it, the roast itself looked mouthwatering.  I did make a couple changes, I didn't have any sage so I just used poultry seasoning since it has thyme and sage in it.  I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the glaze.  Took it out 15 minutes before cutting into it and let it rest, OMG we'll be making this again and again.  You won't be sorry.

This is the second time I have made this, and it is absolutely wonderful!  There is a package at Costco of three sirloin tip pork roasts that suits us perfectly; each roast would serve between 4-6 people, depending on age, etc.  I followed the recipe exactly, using balsamic vinegar (which I highly recommend).  The only thing is that I only cooked it for an hour and a half because of the size; you only want to get it to 150 degrees so it doesn't dry out.  I think that next time I'll cook it at 350 the first 45 minutes and then turn it down to 325 when starting the basting the last half hour just so it browns a little and doesn't burn the sauce.  Ohhh, so yummy!

I followed this recipe to the letter with one exception.  I put the roast in as I went to church figuring I would be back in time to prepare the sauce and baste the roast.  As Murphy's Law would have it, I didn't get home until late and the roast was well done and it was too late in the evening to make the sauce.  The roast was pretty darn good with just the rub.  Two days later I decided to try the sauce with the leftover roast.  Oh my, that put this roast over the top and then some!  If this recipe can be this good with a two day delay for the sauce, I can just imagine how good it will be when I make it the way it was intended to be made.  Definitely a five-star recipe.  Will be making this one again and again.

The first time I made this, I may have overcooked it and it came out dry.  I liked the flavor so well that I decided to try it again, and it came out perfectly the second time.  This is easy and tastes GREAT!  It is great even without the glaze, but awesome with it!

Wonderful roasted pork recipe!  I did use 3 1/2 lbs rather than 5 lbs without modifying the recipe (except to bake it for only about 1 1/2 hours), and the rub and glaze were just enough to go around.  We will definitely make this recipe again and again!

I admit that when I was making this I thought it would just be a so-so, one time only dinner. I was very surprised when I tasted it. I will definitely be making this again.

I was not impressed with this at all. I followed the recipe exact and it was very bland tasting. I did follow somebody else's review and cooked less than the 3 hours and glad I did because it was borderline dry. I will not be making this one again unfortunately.

This was great!  Before putting in the oven, but after putting the herb mix on, brown all sides of the pork roast in a skillet to trap in moisture and give it a yummy, crusty outside.  I used miced garlic out of a jar and added some balsamic vinegar to the glaze.  Yum, yum!  It was the best pork roast I've ever had.

This is delicious! The only thing I did different is I place the pork on a wire rack over a water bath. Into the water bath I added liquid smoke (amount depends on the persons own taste, I like the flavor of the liquid smoke) I also took the advice of others and doubled the sauce recipe, and I rubbed the pork really well with the dry rub and left it to merinade on the counter top for about 2 hours or until room temp. before cooking it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made this dish as my New Year's Day meal and it turned out wonderfully!! Like previous reviews suggested, I used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar and tripled the sauce ingredients. I 4X the herb rub and used bottled minced garlic. I had a 4.5 lb. pork loin and it took around 2 hr 15 minutes to reach 170 degrees plus. I covered it with aluminum foiland place it on a rack so that it wasn't resting in its own juices. Next time I think I'll make a pan gravy with the mixture of the sauce and meat drippings using a little cold water and cornstarch. Even those picky non-meat lovers loved this dish. I'm looking forward to pork loins going on sale again:)

A very good recipe.  Like many of the others I doubled the rub.  The cooking time was much shorter than listed so the glaze went on just as the loin came out.  I rubbed the loin, wrapped in seran wrap and put it in the fridge for a few hours before.  Seared it before putting it in the oven.  Put apple juice in the pan at the start and added water mid way through.  Once the loin was out I moved all the delicious juice to a pan, added sliced onions and some corn starch slurry and made a great gravy to but over basmati rice.  It was delicious.  My 2 year old had three helpings.

I made this for New Years' Dinner and it was great. I doubled the rub and it was very flavorful. My roast was about 4 3/4 pounds, and it was done around 2 hours, and was very moist! Great recipe!

I used a bone-in pork roast because that was all that was available, and it was fantastic.  I made it for a huge Christmas party and everyone loved it.  I put the rub on the night before.  When I make it again I'll try doubling the amount of the rub.

I have to say this was by far the best pork roast recipe I've ever tried.  I think even with only a 4lb roast I would have doubled the glaze it was marvelous we couldn't get enough of it. Served with hot buttered egg noodles and fresh green beans.  The flavor was outstanding.

After reading all the glowing reviews, I was a bit disappointed in this one. The meat was just okay to us. It is super easy. I baked a 2 pound pork loin. I used the same amount of spices as the recipe calls for if doing a 5 pound loin. It took between 1-1/2 and 1-3/4 hours to bake.

You can not go wrong with this recipe. WOW!  I took the advice of others and used b.sugar and balsamic vinegar.  I also used fresh sage and rosemary. I made extra rub and rolled the pork loin in it and then seared the outsides in a skillet with some olive oil, before puttin it in the convection oven.  It only took about an hour to cook two 1.5lbs loins. They came out fabulous!  I didn't put the glaze on until the very last min. since I had an herb crust on them.  I just stuck them under the broiler for a few mins.  The glaze is to die for!  The meat was so moist and tender.  I will definitely making this often.  I decided to try this recipe with the Balsamic Roasted Potatoes and Broccoli with cashews.  It was a great valentines dinner. So Gourmet!  TY

We used dehydrated sliced garlic and put all the spices (doubled amounts) in a processor, made a powder of it, coated the roast, and refrigerated it over night in a plastic zip bag. In the morning, we injected the roast with half of the marinade. LINE THE PAN WITH FOIL-IT SEEPS OUT AND BURNS IN THE PAN! A little water or wine in the bottom would have made a tasty addition to the marinade. The balsamic vinegar suggestion was wonderful! Bake and baste as directed, but watch the meat temperature...it did not take 3 hours in a convection oven.

for the meat we used 2 lbs. of pork tenderloin. we doubled the sause mixture like other reviewers suggested and this recipe turned out great i think next time the only thing that i will do differently will be to double the mixture and cover the meat and whatever sauce i have left i will add a tablespoon more of water so that it will be more thin so that it will be better for dipping

Very good!  I used poultry seasoning because I had no sage and the roast was VERY good.  I made the basting sauce and realized I couldn't really use it because I had potatoes in the bottom of the roaster- so we used it as a dipping sauce.  While the sauce was good, it REALLY needed to have gone over the meat because it needed the savory seasoning from the meat to be SPECTACULAR.  So, next time, I'll roast the potatoes in another pan and baste the roast with the sauce.  I can't wait to do that!  All in all, everything was very good, but I think with the glaze it would be AMAZING!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for a cooking party at my house and everyone loved it. Several guest said they had always hated pork.
I tripled the seasonings and doubled the sauce.

This was so good. Next time I will make extra sauce. I made pork fried rice with the leftovers. My husband didn't like it, but he does not like anything sweet or sweet and sour. I will definately make again. It is the first pork roast I have really liked. Thanks Wendee.

I give this 5 stars because the sauce that actually roasted on the pork in the oven was a wonderful flavor.  The sauce I had left in the saucepan, however was terrible--I can't imagine using it for dipping or pouring it over the pork right before serving.  The pork was very tender and as I said, the sauce and seasonings added a perfect flavor.

I looked everywhere for a pork roast recipe.  When I came across this one I decided to try it.  My (grown) son loved it (so did I).  I finally had to stop him when he went back for his 4th helping!  The one thing I did different - we are saucy people so I doubled the amount of sauce.  Needless to say, I will be cooking this one again!

This one is a keeper!  The rub really brought out the flavor of the meat, and the glaze was perfect - golden brown, shiny, and great-tasting!  I expected it to be too sweet or too tangy, but it was just right, and really addred to the flavor of the spice rub.  I'll make this again, and may even try it with other pork cuts.

Pork was very good, but the glaze was way too sweet for me, which results in the loss of a star for this recipe.  When I fiddle with the glaze a bit, this may be a 5 star.

This recipe made for a very moist roast. You can even get gravy out of it if you pull the juices from the pan before you start basting it w/ the glaze. I stabbed the roast repeatedly w/ a fork so that the flavor would penetrate well and it really did. I hate when you make a recipe and the flavor is only surface deep.  I did however use brown sugar instead of white and balsamic vinegar instead of white. So slightly modified but overall stuck to the recipe (sugar for sugar/vinegar for vinegar) I also slide it under the broiler for just a minute or 2 to get a little charring on the glaze, mainly for looks :)

We loved this. The glaze, with a few suggested enhancements, were excellent. I used garlic powder, salt, pepper and sage on the pork rub. I wound up adding balsamic and I used teriyaki instead of soy sauce in the glaze. I will be making this again ASAP.

I made this for Easter dinner for my family of six.  Even my pickiest little one liked it.  I'm glad I read the. Reviews, though; several raters suggested doubling the sauce.  I did, and was glad.   We used it to dip Brussels sprouts in, and even my picky little guy gobbled them up!

Delicious! Doubled the spices and the sauce. The pork loin was a little more than 4 lbs and took about two and a half hours with the last half hour finishing up quickly. I added about a half cup of water to the roasting pan. The family loved it. Fed five men aged 6-60 and they all gave it two thumbs up. Will definitely make this again.

A MUST MAKE!  Awesome recipe.  Because of the reviews I made this for Christmas dinner for my family.  Instead of vinegar, I used balsalmic vinegar, it tastes incredible!  Everyone loved it.  I will be making this again.  I am so glad I found this recipe!

I rarely take the time to review recipes although I rely heavily upon them.  This was the most delicious pork roast I have ever had.  There were no modifications made to this as I got called away on an emergency and left my husband with the roast, recipe and ingredients. He said he followed the recipe exactly only he didn't know what the rub part meant so basically mixed everything together from the start and just put it in oven and basted occasionally.  It was honestly so delicious that we didn't have our normal conversation while eating, we both just kept saying, "oohhh  yummm."  Don't be afraid, it's s keeper.

We tried this tonight for the first time and it was a hit!  We don't care for sage so we omitted it from the rub.  I should have listed to the other reviews and made extra glaze. It was delish! I didn't have cornstarch on hand so I used flour instead and it worked great.  Will definitely make again!

The flavors of this recipe are spot on. I prepared it exactly as described, but used a pork loin that was just under 4 pounds, and roasted it on a rack. My only criticism is that the seasoning mixture was only enough for the top of the roast. Next time I will double the amount. The glaze, however, made more than enough. Three hours seemed way too long for such a tender cut of meat. Mine was done before 2 hours.

Amazing! Instead of a 5 lb pork loin, I had a 1.5 lb pork roast. After reading several reviewers' suggestions, I didn't adjust the recipe to the smaller amount of meat so I had about 3X more ingredients for the meat. I adjusted the bake time for the amount of meat, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Freakin' delicious. I mostly picked this recipe because it was the best-looking pork recipe that didn't require hours of marinading (I did not plan ahead) so it was a nice surprise that it turned out so incredibly well.

Fantastic!  I tripled the sauce as suggested and it was great to have some to spoon over the slices.  It was also great on carrots!  I used a combination of balsamic and red wine vinegar, because I didn't have enough balsamic.  Will definitely make again

This has become a family favorite at our house. It is one of the easiest recipes that can be made with pork tenderloin (which is what we prefer to pork roast). The combination of spices is perfect. Make this just as the recipe directs and you're sure to hear a lot of muffled compliments through happily chomping mouths.

I love this recipe but the cooking time is far too long. Mine is just shy of 5 lbs. but is almost done after one hour and fifteen minutes, done enough to turn off the oven.

I followed this recipe exactly yesterday for Easter lunch and it turned out perfectly.  Everybody really enjoyed the flavor and a couple said it was the best pork roast they had ever had.  I agree.  The 5-1/2 pound roast was moist and juicy cooked to right at the 3 hour mark.  Thank you for this recipe.

Wow, so good! I used red wine vinegar and my roast had a fat pad on it that I left on and up so as it cooked the fat would melt through the pork. The kids and I really liked this and the sauce was good over our rice too.

This was a hit! I did add oregano and I omitted the salt. The glaze during the last part made it even better. It was excellent and we would make this again.

This was AMAZING! My roast was about 2.25 pounds and it cooked for 1h30 min approximately. I put more herbs than called for and it was oh so good! As suggested by other reviewers, i substituted the vinegar for balsamic and it was perfect! Perfect combination of sweet and sour!! this recipe is so easy its almost unbeleivable it tastes this good after!

This was really good. I used balsamic vinegar and a ribbed pork loin. I also doubled the recipe.  Sauce is on the sweet side  but good. II may try a little less sugar.

Fantastic aroma filled my house as it baked.  I doubled the garlic! And it does not take 3 hours to bake!  Start basting after 1 hour.

This was probably only of the best roast pork receipes I have ever made.  I did however, double the rub and the basting sauce.  I also had read other reviews and a long cooking time was needed as it is a slow cook.  The receipe is a winner!!!

I'm in the minority and actually didn't care for this recipe. The sauce that everyone is talking about how delicious it is, just wasn't to either my husband or myself. I had doubled th spice rub, it was OK but nothing really spectacular. I wouldn't bother to make this again.

This pork roast came out juicy!  The rub and the glaze were complimentary.  I used a 3 lb. pork loin, rubbed in the rub (with extra garlic) and tied it up with string.  Used the tip from another reviewer and placed the pork on slices of onions in the pan.  It cooked for 1 1/2 hours.  I brushed the glaze as the recipe goes.  I made glazed pearl onions and buttered boiled red potatoes to go along with it.  Mighty fine!

Delicious! I roasted on top of 2 quartered onions at 325 for 2 hours. I added whole potatoes 75 minutes before the pork loin was done- rolled in olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper after I microwaved them for a few minutes each (8 minutes for 4 potatoes). Delicious!

I made this using pork loin chops, and since I had a lot more surface area to cover, I used 3 times the herb rub.  I can't rate these for myself (vegetarian), but my husband and in-laws LOVED them.  Seriously loved.  I made 11 chops and they were all gone with only 3 people eating them!  I was shocked.  Thank you so much for a foolproof (vegetarian-proof, even) recipe. =)

I made this without sage and no other substitution for sage and it came out really good everyone should try this recipe because its good for people that don't like a   lot of different spices. I'm a young kid and i made this and my parents were amazed!



Thank You Allrecipes

I'll have to say, I was amazed at how delicious this was!!! When I read the ingredients I was a little concerned about how it would turn out. Also, when I made the glaze, I tasted it alone and I was nervous about putting it over the loin. Once it cooked over the loin, I'm so happy I decided not to throw it out! This was one of those "I shouldn't eat more, but it's so good I have to" meals. Also, I made only a one pound loin and cooked it until the middle was 165 degrees. It ended up only being about 1 hour. I will be making this again, very soon!

This is an amazing dish, and for those of you who are, like me, trying to lose some weight, it is low enough in calories that it doesn't have to be for special treats only! Fabulous! And the sauce goes so well with green beans that I actually crave them!

This was amazing! I loved the flavors and will definitely make this again. I omitted the sage because I don't like sage but otherwise baked as directed. I put a 3.5 lb roast in the oven for 3 hours and it was perfectly tender. Thanks so much!

Just wonderful! I used a meat thermometer; cooked to 145, took out of the oven and covered with foil for about 10 minutes. I took the other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce.

This recipe is AWESOME! My family couldn't get enough of it and couldn't say enough about it. The glaze is a must. I did what some of the other reviews suggested and I doubled the glaze mixture and I quadrupled the rub in order to create a nice thick crust. The roast was extremely tender and juicy. I put it in for 3 hours and when it was almost done, I checked the temperature with a meat thermometer and the temp was much higher then the recipe called for. At first I was worried, but my worries were over when we ate it because it was perfect. This recipe is a keeper!

This was moist, flavorful and delicious.  I served it for Easter lunch and it was wonderful.  Next time, I will use low fat soy sauce as I found it a bit salty.

Yum!  Used 2 1/2lb loin.  Doubled sauce except sugar.  Used brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, and low sodium soy sauce.  Also added a few squirts of honey to sauce.  Only basted once, then served the rest of the sauce on the side.  Can't wait to try the sauce on chicken. . .  Pot stickers. . .  Egg rolls. . .  Very good!

Delicious! The only thing I did differently was to use pre-made Sweet and Sour sauce instead of making the sauce in this recipe (out of laziness ;) )...but I left the herbs the same.

This was outstanding! Even my 11yr old son loved it. I don't know where the 3 hour cooking time comes from because mine was up to temp in 45 minutes. I took some of the suggestions and used balsamic and brown sugar. I also quadrupled the rub and added about 2T of olive oil in it and made a paste that I applied to all sides of my 24oz Pork Tenderloin. I poked my roast several times with a sharp knife then covered the baking dish with plastic wrap and let it marinate for about 5hours in the fridge. I doubled the glaze (but not the sugar) since many commented on the overly sweet flavor. The glaze was pretty much the blasamic reduction I've made in the past. It would not have been necessary to double it however. This is definitely a keeper.

Doubled the herb rub and the sauce.  Perfect.  The leftover sauce and pork would be great transformed into a Chinese dish with broc and other veggies over rice.

This was fantastic.  I made it a few weeks ago and am making it again tonight.  I switched out the white sugar for brown and the vinegar for balsamic but kept everything the same.  Also I used a convection oven and an internal thermometer that my oven has and it was done in under an hour.  I will definitely make it again.

This was so good! Very moist and flavorful. I didn't double the sauce and wish I had. Will be sure to at least double the rub and sauce next time. Picky husband really liked it too.

Made this again and doubled the rub and tripled the sauce (using balsamic vinegar). Cubed the leftover pork the next day and added chunked green pepper, onion, carrots and pineapple chunks to the remaining sauce with a bit of  pineapple juice. Served this over jasmine rice. Better than takeout!

My new go-to recipe!  Scaled the recipe for a large crowd on New Years day and everybody loved it.  I basted the roast with the juices every 30 min of cook time and watched the roast so it would not be overdone.  Also made a gravy with the drippings for a choice of sauces.

This is an excellent recipe.  I embellished it by cutting several sprigs each of rosemary, thyme, and oregano from my back yard, finely mincing the leaves, and adding it to the rub.  I also used a few tablespoons of olive oil to help the rub coat the pork loin.  I believe this substantially enhanced the flavor of the meat.  The glaze was a wonderful addition and was surprisingly compatible with the rub.

Delicious! I didn't have sage but instead used italian seasoning. As others suggested, I doubled the amount of herbs. I mixed everything on a plate and rubbed the mixture into the roast, then put it in the oven for 3 hours. Boyfriend kept going back for second helpings! Will be using again. :)

great recipe. i used thyme, rosemary, garlic, olive oil, and pepper. i use a lot of rub, and cut slives in the meat and shove some rub in there too. it's great! i also covered the meat with tin foil so it was very moist.

Not sure what I did wrong, but my roast barely picked up any of the flavors of this rub.  Certainly wasn't impressed and doubt we'll try this one, again.

LOVED IT!!!! I used the baslamic vinger, brown sugar as others suggested for sauce. I also sprinkled granulated garlic over top of roast. I only made 1 lb roast and put in oven at 350 for about 40 mins. Turned out super tender. Hubby loved it! Definite addition to my recipes.

Delicious!  I made a pork tenderloin and it was ready in a little over an hour.  My family of four devoured almost the whole thing.  I added the garlic powder to the rub and extra sage, as well.  I also doubled the ingredients for the gravy and used flour in place of the cornstarch adding extra to thicken it.  I only poured a little over the tenderloin during the last 15 mins and served the remainder as gravy.  The family loved it and it will definitely be served again!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Not a big fan of cooking with vinegar... the smell burns my nostrils. The next day, after the smell cleared out of the house I could enjoy the mellower taste.

WOW!!!  Hubby picked it and we loved it!  He actually said it was a recipe to make for guests.  The only thing you have to remember is to double the rub and sauce. (I only used a 2lb loing so if I was using a four quad the rub and sauce.)  I think this would also be great for chicken.

The BEST pork I've ever cooked! My picky brother RAVED about this and hubby,who hates sugar in food devoured it! I doubled the recipe (the boys are big eaters) and thought I had to add a little butter afrter I took it out if the oven, it looked a little dry inside. I shouldn't have worried. It was tender and succulent... beautiful! I'll be making this frequently! BRAVO!

Highly recommend. Pork-hating fiance even loved it.  I used a 1lb pork loin and baked for 45 min at 350.  I'd recommend even slightly less time for more tenderness.  Definetly double the seasoning though.  I used the same amounts for 1lb and thought it was just enough.  Will def make again!

This was so good! I doubled the rub recipe (I used a 2lb pork loin) I just love what the sage adds to this. I followed the recipe as it's told and my picky 4 year old who refuses to eat anything with "sauce" ate his entire plate while telling me how good dinner was. The sauce was the perfect touch. I was a bit hesitant to add the glaze but it was fantastic.

The glaze was good.  But the roasted loin was not.  It was a bit dry and lacked a lot of flavor.  Sorry, I usually do not write bad reviews.. But I was going to make this for a holiday and I'm glad I didn't.  I did follow the directions perfectly!  I'm confused why so many others gave it 5 stars.  Maybe its me?  But anyways thanks for sharing...this one is not for me.

OMG Love this.  Have made it several times.  Usually double the sauce recipe as family likes plenty for dipping.  Also, smaller roasts won't need near so long in the oven so keep an eye on it.

This recipe was awesome.  I did what some others suggested and added asian garlic chili sauce to the sauce recipe and it was fabulous.  I did inject the roast with some of the sauce mixture towards the end of the cooking time.  It turned out really juicy.  Great over rice!

This recipe is the reason I joined  allrecipes.com.  I had to sign up so that I could share that I agree with so many of the other members that this recipe is FANTASTIC!  I have made it a number of times for my family or at larger extended family dinners. So either this recipe is amazing, or the rest of things that I have cooked have been terrible and my family just politely compliments me...because when they ate this they LOVED it and could not stop telling me so.  It is good even cold but better warm. The only thing I changed is that I used garlic powder rather than crushed garlic.  It was easier to spread on (used as a rub with the sage, salt, and pepper.

I usually don't add sauces to pork roasts/tenderloins, but this one seemed simple and it got good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try.  I wasn't sure what kind of vinegar to use, so because it didn't specify I used regular white vinegar.   I was skeptical, but it actually turned out really well.  It was a good combination of sweet and tart and went with pork really well.  It was really easy to make (very fast!) and I didn't mess it up.  I'm not that great in the kitchen, so I was happy that the glaze turned out well.  I used gluten-free soy sauce.  I recommend this recipe, especially the glaze.

I doubled the rub and the glaze ingredients.  I substituted balsamic vinegar for regular.  I also cooked it in the slow cooker, laying onions on the bottom first, and adding the glaze immediately.  It was fabulous!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled the rub and the glaze as others suggested.  This was excellent...the whole family loved it.  My husband said this was the best dish I had made in the whole 8 years we've been married.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes--perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I used half the sugar since most reviews said it was too sweet, and used brown sugar for the extra flavor.  Definitely double the glaze.  I also used red wine vinegar, although balsamic would be good as well, and sprinkled some cayenne over the meat before baking.

This was great, but at 2 1/2 hours my 5 lb. pork roast was at 160 degrees so I wasn't able to cook it in the glaze.  I simply poured the glaze on it and let it rest for about 15 minutes.  Be sure to watch the temperature of the meat!

GREAT RECIPE!! Cooked it for a firehouse full of men and they loved it.  Plus I got the loin on sale and it was a super cheap meal.  I followed another suggestion and rolled the loin in bread crumbs after rubbing it.  I also made extra sauce, mixed it with the drippings and thickened it to make what can only be described as yum-yum sauce! I actually licked the bowl and was not ashamed.

It was "okay". I don't know what was missing, perhaps it was too much sage and the glaze was a tad too sweet. I just don't know. It wasn't bad though, just okay.

This was VERY good!  Couldn't stop picking at after I was full!  I modified a few minor things:  After rubbing the sage mixture (using a HUGE clove of garlic) over my 2.4lb pork roast (it's what I had in the freezer) I browned it before putting it in my crockpot.  I just poured the glaze mixture (using 1/4c white sugar & 1/4c brown sugar & everything else the same) over the roast and added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the crockpot for more liquid.  Cooked on high for 4 hours and it was fantastic!  Nice and juicy and very very tender. Thanks for the recipe WENDEE_H!

This was my first time ever attempting to make a pork roast. It turned out FANTASTIC. My "picky eater" husband and food critic mother raved about how tender, juicy and flavorful the roast was. I used a 2.5lbs roast and followed the directions exactly, except I added minced onion,  subbed garlic salt for regular salt and added a  2 chopped cloves of garlic to the rub. Baked for 1.5 hrs on 325. Perfection! The glaze was awesome! I made another batch after the meal to keep on hand to use over chicken, rice...pretty much everything!

It was too sweet for pork my 12 year old usually raves over my cooking, but he said the pork was awful, this would be good maybe on a ham but way to sweet for pork chops.(followed the recipe exactly)

This was my first pork roast ever & this sounded good so I figured I'd try it! I am sooo glad I did! It was delicious!! My hubby said it was really most & better than his mom makes hers....so I know I did good!!!
EDIT: 1 1/2 lb pork needed about 40-45 mins at 350

These are wonderful. Make sure to salt to your own taste. I made the mistake of adding the cornstarch to the liquid after it had begun to boil in the pot. OOPS. I wont boil after that. The pork loin is better the next day. I want to try this on chops and maybe fowl.

I LOVE this recipe! It's my fail-safe special occasion dinner.  The only change I make is that once I coat the pork with the seasoning, I marinate it for a few hours. You won't be disappointed!

Absolutely loved this.  I have never cooked a pork loin in my life, but it was on sale at the grocery.  Now I want to buy pork even when it's not on sale! I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce and the rub.  This was so good. My husband would have eaten the whole thing if let him - but I made him stop picking and save some for his lunch the next day.  We loved it.

This was one of the best roasts I have ever made.  Not only did it taste great, but it was simple to prepare.  All of my family enjoyed this one, and I will definately make it again.    Make sure you make extra sauce.

This recipe was easy, simple and delicious. It's the first time I've ever tried this recipe. I didn't have sage on hand so I used 1/2 tsp of rosemary and 1/2 tsp of thyme. Also added garlic salt to the dry rub. It was great.

I used a 3 lb roast, and it was barely thawed when I put it in.  I used all of the cooking time- it took 3 hours and 10 miuntes to hit 160 degrees.   To make the sauce not lumpy I disolved the corn starch in the COLD water before adding it to the other ingredients.   Very, very good!  I tripled the rub and the sauce, used balsamic, honey, and brown sugar in the sauce.  There weren't many leftovers and we're just a family of 3.  My toddler son LOVED it, including dipping his roast in the sauce. Will defintely make again!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used pork chops instead of the pork loin so I could see if I liked the flavor of the sauce (I was thinking about doing a pork roast for Easter).  First of all, I didn't have enough rub for the pork chops, much less a roast, so I would definitely double the rub if making a roast. I did like the flavor of the sauce, but the recipe is not good enough that I would make it again.

The glaze was INCREDIBLE. I couldn't stop licking at it. My pork turned out a bit dry though so I am not sure where I went wrong. Will likely try again on a smaller type of meat - perhaps pork chops.

This is a wonderful, stress free recipe!  Since I already had a pre-made pork rub from the grocery store on hand which looked similar to what this recipe contains I did use that.  I did use a meat thermometer.  I doubled the glaze so to have a bit more for drizzling on served meat.  I did sub a good quality Balsamic Vinegar.  The glaze was really good.  I boiled a bit longer than recipe seems to indicate, just to reduce it to make a thicker sauce.  I served this with baked yams and my husband said he felt like this was a special holiday meal, not just a regular old Sunday!  I will definitely be making this moist, flavorful roast again.

BEST TASTING PORK EVER!!! I made this for New Year's dinner and had to meet my Polish Mom-in-law's approval! Passed with flying colors! Everyone loved this recipe! I took advice from a bunch of reviews and doubled all the ingredients - added garlic & onion powder, rosemary, flour instead of cornstarch & balsamic vinegar, brown sugar & injected slivers of garlic to the pork also.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it got rave reviews.  I followed other users suggestions and used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar in the glaze.  I doubled the rub and also added thyme and rosemary.  I only used a 3 lb pork loin to feed 5 but doubled the glaze ... turned out to be way too much glaze and I have about a pint of it left over.  I would double the glaze if I were using a 6 lb pork loin next time ... we will absolutely be having this again as it's a different approach than I normally take (usually a spicy rub and cook on the grill).  Thanks for a wonderful pork loin recipe!

I just ate this meal and it was very good. I usually do not like cream of mushroom, but the onions changed the flavor and it was fabulous.

I will do this again. maybe next time i would serve with green beens...

Excellent! I've had a 4lb pork loin in the freezer for I don't know how long and finally had to cook it due to a power outage.  I thought the sauce ended up looking like molasses, but it tasted great!  I added potatoes and carrots in the last 1/2 hour and it all tasted great. Don't think the kids will eat it strictly because it's pork (silly kids)...looks like I'll be having it for lunch all week!

I doubled the rub recipe and it was just right for a 2 1/2 lb loin roast. I tripled the recipe for the sauce and it was way too much. But I think doubling the sauce would be good. I did some stir fry frozen veggies and added a little sauce and water and steamed them. And I put a tiny bit of sauce into some white rice and still had a ton left over after we finished the meat. The meat was tender. The sauce is a bit sweet, too sweet. I didn't taste the sage rubas much as I hoped I would. It was the sweet sauce that was the strongest.

My husband and I were also slightly skeptical...but this is DELICIOUS, the glaze has such a wonderful flavor after it has been brushed onto the roast!

I did not cover the roast at all and seemed to have no issues with moisture (and that is the main reason my husband won't typically eat pork!).  I used garlic powder in the rub and used one garlic glove to slide slivers into the roast.  I also drizzled a little oil over the top (as I don't have a roasting pan) and cooked in a shallow corningware dish.  I also followed someone elses suggestion to used balsalmic vinegar.  I basted the roast with the glaze 3 times.  The remainder still had a very vinegar flavor (most of which baked off of the glaze when basted), so I did not drizzle over the top after the cook time was over.  I poured the remainder into a dish to use as desired.  DELICIOUS!!!

This recipe was awesome.  My husband said it was the best pork roast he has ever had... and he doesn't give comments like that liberally.  I used a 2.5 lb roast still doubled the seasoning and the sauce... (I didn't end up needing all the sauce though)  And I used white wine vinegar instead of regular vinegar.  It was delicious... I might try lining the roasting pan with foil next time... Burnt sugar is a huge pain to clean!!!

This turned out wonderful, and the smells in the kitchen were mouthwatering!  It didn't take nearly as long to cook as stated, only about 2 hrs total.  The flavors worked well together and the roast was nice an moist!!

Fantastic. One of our favorite dinners (with nothing but brown rice and broccoli- but make sure to double the sauce as you'll probably want more!) I hardly ever even remember this is supposed to be for a loin- I use the recipe all the time for little butt roasts and picnic cuts- I do them in the slow cooker and they finish in just a few hours since they're usually less than two pounds... I follow the other dir's in terms of the rub and using the sauce during the last hour to baste.... Someday I'll even buy a loin to use it on but right now I only cook for 2.5 humans so I'll have to keep it in mind for later... plus I'd have to actually roast that- it would be too big for my slow cooker! Great recipe, we love it!

This is a wonderful recipe, I served this for guests and they loved it. The roast came out super juicy and tasty, and the glaze is really great almost a Teriyaki taste to it. 

Watch the roast closely though, mine cooked much faster than I thought so I had to put on some glaze and let it set under the broiler for a minute or two which made for a nice crispy crust though!

This was a big hit with all of my family including my husband, who typically doesn't like pork.  I followed others advice and used balsamic vinegar. It makes it have so much more flavor.

This has got to be my favorite dish, EVER.  It is soo delicious.  I must say, I've always used terryaki instead of soy and I TRIPLE the glaze.  You must use more than this recipe calls for.

Fantastic Recipe!!! I doubled the glaze and used it as directed in the last 1/2 hour of cooking and then served the remainder with the loin. I also used balsamic vinegar and though it is dark, it makes a wonderful glaze! This is a definite keeper! I may try adding rosemary next time, but only for a variation. This recipe needs NO changes - it is great as is! As for the dryness issue that some Reviewers have experienced, I have learned that using an "oven cooking bag" and following the directions for cooking temperature and time as indicated for the bag works great - moist every time!

This came out way too dry, and I only cooked it two 1/4 hours.  However, the sauce was incredible, and the rub was perfect.  I will try it again, but tent it in foil and cook it for a shorter amount of time.

Outstanding!!!  I tweaked the recipe a bit using balsamic vinegar (it's all that I had in the house).  My husband loved it.  What a compliment because he's not that found of pork.  Now when I say we're having pork for dinner, he always asks if I'm going to make him some of "that sauce you make.  "I also use it when I bake pork chops.

VERY good!  I also added a little powered ginger and some lemon thyme from my garden to my rub, and used balsamic vinegar in place of reg. vinegar.  Wonderful taste!  This roast also made excellent sandwiches the next day.  :o) I will make this recipe again!

It is rare that my family of five can all agree on something, but we all LOVED this dish. I doubled the dry ingredients and garlic, used foil to make a tent during the first two hours of cooking, and cut slices to add minced garlic inside it.

Made this last night, it was dry, dry, dry and had no flavor except for the glaze. Probably should reduce the cooking time but I won't be investing the time to try. Life's too short to eat bland food.

I just want to say thank you for this recipe it is wonderful! I made this for my husband's business meeting and everyone loved it. I did not use the sage because I don't care for it, I used salt,pepper,fresh garlic and olive oil,brushed it over it and put it in the oven. I just can't say enough about it Great Recipe! this is a Keeper.

Easy and delicious.  I managed to screw up a couple times: I used poultry seasoning once and italian seasoning another time because I did not have anything else.  One time I didn't glaze it during baking, but only after it was all done.  It still turned out delicious and moist every time.  However, I've never bothered with a roast larger than 2 pounds and I bake it to an internal temperature just shy of 170 degrees because I like my pork roast well done.

We loved this recipe!  My husband and I are watching our sugar and carb levels, so I used Splenda instead of sugar, low sodium soy sauce, and omitted the corn starch. Still tasted fabulous.

OH SO GOOD!  I wanted something different for our Valentine's Night Dinner and this was AMAZING!  I played it safe, and picked this recipe for all the good reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly... only doubling the sauce.  It was amazing and I got many praises from the hubby!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe.  I will make this again and again.

I was not in love with the herbs on the roast (but didn't think it was bad either), but the glaze! mmm made up for it.  I will be making the glaze again (doubling the recipe) to serve with pork again.  Very tasty!  Thank you for sharing.  The pork is also great in a crock pot.

I've made this several times now and everyone who has tried it has loved it - even my grandchildren (ages 1 and 3)!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  I must say I liked it better the second time, substituting brown sugar for the white and adding a pinch of crushed thyme to the rub mix.  Both times I used balsamic vinegar as the recipe didn't specify what sort to use and many other reviewers had used it with success.  Great recipe!

I made this roast for my in-laws a couple nights ago and received RAVE reviews...from the moment they walked in the front door and smelled it! I followed the first part of the recipe, but never even made the glaze. Just dry roasted it for 3 hours...it was mouth-watering! Making it again tonight with a few different herbs to mix it up a bit. Tossed potatoes and carrots in the pot for the last 40 minutes or so. Mmm Good.

Love this pork roast!  I followed the recipe as written but added fresh rosemary.  For a 3 lb roast, I had plenty of glaze.  Very tasty and great for our New Year's feast!  This would be wonderful for a dinner party, the house smelled so good while it was cooking.  Happy 2008!

The glaze is so simple, but quite tasty! This was a big hit at a dinner party--it looked pretty on the plate. One thing--I used two smaller boneless loins that added up to almost 5 pounds, and they were done in just 2 hours.

Tried this Xmas day and everyone loved it.  I had a 2.5 Lb boneless loin.  I doubled the rub and made the sauce as it was stated in recipe.  My first cooking w/Sage and it was great.  Beautiful presentation, very flavorful.  Served the sauce on the side - everyone had the sauce and seconds on servings!  Thanks for sharing.

This was an awesome recipe!  I cooked it in the Showtime rotisserie and it worked great!  My only contribution was that I made twice the rub to make sure there was enough for the whole roast and and I put sprigs of Rosemary under the twine I used to tie it so that for flavor as it was turning on the spit rod. It was absolutely beautiful with the glaze.  I'm going to use the glaze for other it meats, it was so delish!

Totally enjoyed this recipe.  Very tangy and flavorful.  The roast was very juicy and tender.  I made the sauce exactly as written, but I doubled it.  It would have been skimpy otherwise. Looking forward to making it again.

This was awesome!! I hadn't intended on making this, but I was looking up how long to cook a roast and saw that I had everythign on hand for it. I only subbed Apple Cider Vinegar for regular vinegar, and I also added a teaspoon more cornstarch to make the glaze a little thicker. I think this will be my default pork recipe. My 4 year old had 3 helpings!!

Good, but I've certainly had better basting than this recipe.  It sounded much better than it actually tasted.

Delicious!!  I doubled the rub and the glaze for my 4.5 lb pork loin and it was perfect.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of regular, but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  It cooked way faster than I thought it would, so I only was able to put the glaze on the last 15 minutes or so while it was cooking.  After it was done though, I poured the rest in the pan and spooned a little on each plate as I served it.  Great recipe!

I didn't have any sage so I just used garlic, salt, pepper and rosemary. Turned out great. Baked it with some yams, potatoe, onion and apple. The sauce really helped. Will make again and again!

Liked the rub, loved the glaze!  Served with jasmine rice as recommended by another reviewer; the match was perfect.  Now that I bought the rubbed sage, this will be a convenient recipe to make since I'll have all ingredients on hand and just have to pick up the pork loin.  Will make again, thanks!
Update Nov 09:  Doubled the sauce... it was a bit sweet... maybe cut down on the sugar?  Husband LOVED!  Thinking of adding some spice to the sauce to make it more like General Tso's.  Used the small loin from Meijer (1+ lbs) and cooked for about an hour.

This cooks up a very moist and flavorful roast. If you are lucky enough to have leftovers, it is great sliced thin for sandwiches!

This was fantastic. The only thing I would do different next time is pour the sauce over the roast at the very end. It got too sticky when I did as the recipe suggsted. Most of it came off when I cut off the ties that were around the roast.

The only change I made was using apple cider vinegar in lieu of distilled vinegar. This recipe was wonederful. My husband is VERY picky and he liked it! The roast cooked a little quicker than I had planned so I just sliced it up, wrapped it in foil along with the juices and put it in a crockpot on low until dinner time.

I incorporated two recipes from the site for my roast pork.  I used the herbs from this recipe and roasted the boneless loin of pork with a apple cider. An hour before finishing, I added a bag of sauerkraut to the roasting pan, mixing it well with the juices from the roast and the cider.  The roast was moist and tender, the kraut had a bit of bite to it.  I didn't make the sauce as I had made fresh apple sauce earlier and used that with the pork.

I made this for a group of 25. Tripled the rub and the sauce. All I can say is WOW! Huge hit, had to print out the recipe for all the women! The sauce is incredible. Served with a corn relish, twice baked potatoes and caramel apple dumplings and diabetic pumpkin rolls for those on restricted sugar intake. Will have to attempt a sugar substitute at home as I do serve many diabetics. Will use this recipe time and again.

This was so good there was no left overs... The most tender pork roast I have ever eaten. A must try. I did what a couple of readers suggested and changed sugar to brown sugar. Some of it splenda brown sugar. Trying to make it alittle more healthy. Really good. Will make again.

I cooked the pork to 140 deg F as recommended by Americas Test Kitchens and let it sit for 15 minutes, which raises the internal temperature.  The pork was very moist.  I thought the sauce was too salty when I doubled the recipe. In the future , I will not double the soy sauce.

Excellent. I only had a 1 & 1/2 pound loin. I kept the sauce and spices as is and had plenty for this weight. I also covered with foil until the last 1/2 hour. I only had to cook for about 1 and 1/2 hour to reach 150. Very good and easy!!!

I have made this twice now- it is a favorite at our place. My only suggestion is to double the glaze recipe, it is a great dipping sauce and you will want some with the leftovers.

Made this on a whim with Pork tenderloins and it was very good.  Ratio was probably off because of the tenderloins so the sage came off really strong, but the recipe was still really good.  I think there might be a little too much salt in the recipe and will cut it down the next time I make it.

Did make changes that others suggested so gave it a 5 star rate because of those. Need to use the brown sugar & balsamic vinegar. It makes the house smell great!!!! Remember to shorten the baking time if using a smaller pork loin.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  Even my picky 5-year old son ate every bite.  The sauce really makes this special.  I did double the sauce, and I'm glad I did.  I also changed to balsamic vinegar and brown sugar.  It was a very dark, rich syrup/sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

This was terrific.  It has quickly become a family favorite.  My grocery doesn't have  pork loins this large so I get about a 2lb loin and roast for 2 hours.  I also increase the amount of the glaze so we can add more after serving if someone wants it.  My family is not very fond of meats, but they've really taken to this.  I plan to experiment with adding cranberries or bourbon to the glaze.

This is a great recipe to use on pork lion roast just remeber to adjust your cooking time to Lbs (2 to 21/2 was about an hour). Picky dad love it and nephew ask for a copy of recipe. Made with Roasted Potato Medley from this site.

This is fabulous !!! Full of flavor, I cooked it for about 5 hours ( i covered it last 2 hours). I used brown sugar instead of white and also packed a little of the sugar on the roast as well. Thanks for the great recipe !

I made this with a pork butt roast and it was so good I just can't describe it.  I did double the glaze and it was perfect for a 7# roast.  I also went off the cooktime instructions on the roast, not on this recipe.  But I didn't change any of the ingrediants and it was wonderful.  I have since used the rub and glaze on just regular pork chops.  Turns out so yummy. I have made this recipe at least 10 times and have never had a bad review yet.

It was different... I liked the herb rub part, but adding the sweet glaze made it taste too "complicated".

I went with the other suggestions and used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar.  This was totally awesome.  Really enjoyed the flavor.  Will definitely double up rub and sauce next time. Can't wait to try it on chicken wings.

We did this on beef and my mother in law (who is practically martha stewart when it comes to cooking) said that she really liked it and it had a full flavor to it.  It had a sweet taste to it that I had never had with roast beef.

Used a 5 pound loin roast with bone,it cooked in 2 hrs 45 min, so I wasn't able to brush the glaze on the meat the last half hour and it was still delicious.  I couldn't believe how phenomenal it smelled while cooking.  I made double of the seasoning rub and the glaze so had plenty to use for dipping.  As suggested, I used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar.  The only change I made was using Wondra instead of corn starch (I had it but couldn't find it in my cabinet).  This was so good I'm considering making it for Easter.  Thanks so much for this excellent recipe.

Don't be fooled by some of the other reviews that didn't like the sauce. It was so OMG, I really should have doubled it. I followed others advice and used balsamic vinegar and brown sugar for the sauce.  A fabulous recipe!! Thanks for sharing.

This was awesome! I used a pork shoulder, since it was on sale, and it came out tender and moist. I used balsamic vinegar and brown sugar, and I doubled the glaze ingredients, as suggested. This is definitely a keeper.

this is absolutely fabulous.  I had a tenderloin that was only 1.6# so still used 1 clove crushed garlic and kosher s/p to taste.  I am not a fan of sage so used it lightly but it compliments the flavor of the pork without being overpowering.  1/2 the recipe for the glaze which is scrumptious!  Used balsamic, and subbed honey for the sugar. Added some dehydrated orange zest to the glaze for another level of flavor.  This glaze would be great on chicken wings, as well.  Thanks for this recipe; it is divine.

This is fabulous!! I have made this recipe twice and it is a restaurant quality entree.  I accompanied it with red-skinned garlic mashed potatoes but it would be good with a rice dish as well.  The sauce is excellent!

This was OK. Very easy recipe. I doubled the sauce for dipping as some suggested and it was a good glaze for the pork, but it was not good for dipping-too sugary sweet.  I think I will try this again, but instead of sugar I will use honey.  I think it will make a much nicer,  thicker glaze and better tasting dipping sauce.

Very easy roast to prepare and very tasty, I doubled the sauce.  I added red skin potatos and carrots for the last hour of cooking.  My kids really enjoyed this recipe.

I've made this quite a few times for company, and it never fails to get compliments. I always double the glaze, which goes great with rice.  The past few times I've made it, I skipped putting on the glaze while the roast was cooking.  After slicing the pork, I simply pour it all over the arranged platter. That way there's sure to be juicy flavor on every bite!

Excellent dish !  The glaze/sauce was absolutely delicious.  Because of how yummy it was, I will double the amount of sauce I make next time.  I used a 3 lb. pork loin that was done in 2 hours. I definitely agree with the "asian" flavors and the sides should complement that.  I will add sesame seeds to the glaze next time.  A definite do again.  Thank you.

I followed this recipe exactly and thought it was very simple and delicious! I drained the juices from the meat prior to adding the sauce, but think I will leave some next time to increase and thin the sauce.  I can't wait to try this on ribs!!

This was such a wonderful recipe! The glaze was perfect, the whole process went beautifully. I added some fresh rosemary (just a few sprigs) and following previous reviews, I also used balsamic vinegar & inserted garlic slivers. I served with rice and   veggies. Very delicious. Thanks!

Check your cooking time. I had a 4# roast and it was done it about 1 1/2 hours. I cooked it in a cooking bag which made it so moist.

An amazing recipe!!  I was worried that DH wouldn't like it because it is sweet-but he loved it & so did everyone else.  I added the ginger & rosemary, too.  I also added 1/2 amt of sugar called for & added a small can of mandarian oranges & juice.  I served this with rice & steamed carrots.  I really like the flavor of this BUT it was SO moist & jucy & not dry one bit~Perfect meal-Thanks for recipe!!

This was one of the best pork roasts i have ever eaten. My family loved it, we did not have left overs. I made it again, let it cook a tad longer, added more sauce and made pulled pork sandwiches. What a hit!

Definitely a keeper recipe. Made a regular pork roast into something tasty and droolicious. My boyfriend said the flavor reminded him of char siu pork, a sort of Chinese-flavored dish he orders from a local restaurant, and one of his favorites.

I must have done something wrong because this was not a good dish.  I asked my grocer to give me a pork loin.  It was around 3 1/2 pounds.  The cut looked the sames as pork loin chops but in an uncut version.

I even brined the meat for 6 hours, but I found it to be way too lean and flavorless (even though the spices were doubled).

I might try this again but with a different cut of meat.

I made this recipe last night following the instructions to a "T".  It was amazing.  The hubby and all the kids absolutely loved it.  Then the leftovers on a sandwich with mayo today were great as well.  I typically do not like sugar in recipes involving meat, so I was a bit concerned, but I'm very glad I went with it.  I've been searching for a great pork roast recipe for years and now I have one.  Thanks alot Wendy for this recipe.

My husband liked the sauce, but that was the only positive comment. We ate it, but it's unlikely I'll ever make it again. The combination of flavours just didn't agree with us, I guess.

I have no complaints.  I followed the directions exactly, it turned out wonderful.  A great recipe, maybe not so kid friendly though.  I guess that would depend on the kid.

I think this could have done without the garlic.  The sauce was good, but for a 5 lb roast, I would have liked more of the sauce than what it makes.

Hey now, this  should  be a 5  star recipe  IMO.  It  was totally great for  pork loin. The  sauce  gave  it  a special  touch.  Give  this  a try  for  a special meal. I served  it  with  baked  sweet potatoes and  green beans. Hubby LOVED it! Thanks Wendee!

Delicious! This is the pork loin recipe I was looking for!!! I changed the vinegar to balsamic vinegar as was suggested, and the water to 1 full cup for more sauce. I also used some brown sugar instead of regular, and it came out amazing! So tender and moist and flavorful!

I made it exactly as the recipe and we loved it.  My husband doesn't really care for pork roast but I like to make it because I like the leftovers.  I use it to make tacos, barbecue pork sandwiches, etc.  He loved it  made this way.  This is the only way I'll make pork roasts for now on.

Roast turned out great.  I made double glaze as suggested.   5lbs was way too big for me, but I will absolutely cook again with a smaller roast.

Easy to make and delicious. I used infused balsamic vinegar and brown sugar. I also roasted potatoes and carrots in the same pan. I used the pan juices and the remainder of the glaze to make a nice gravy. Yummy. Hubby really enjoyed it too.

This was delicious! I made it in a small ínstalos, for 40 minutes on 3P pressure and let decompress prior to opening it. I used about 1/4 c of sugar and apple cider vinegar, which worked nicely.

Delicious!! The glaze was sweet and really complemented the rub!! Cooking time varies - my roast was ready in 2 hrs and was beyond the temperature for pork so adjust the time as necessary. I followed the recipe as is otherwise and loved it!! Will def try again!!

Awesome recipe. I used a ton of fresh sage and 6 or 8 cloves or garlic, and made the glaze as suggested. Totally awesome flavour.

The glaze is the winner here. The first time I made this was with pork shoulder. I used red wine vinegar and left out the sage. I baked it in the oven and enjoyed its tender flavor. The second time, I slow-cooked a ham for 5 hours in water. I cooked the glaze on the stove. I emptied the water from my crockpot and spooned on the glaze. I minced a clove of garlic and dropped it on top. Like the recipe stated, I applied glaze 3 more times over 30 minutes. On ham, my dinner had a holiday feel. Quite good.

Made almost exactly as written, but added a few touches like Worcestershire and dried basil to the sauce. Also substituted brown for white sugar. Definitely use white vinegar not balsamic as many reviewers state. Also added a little bit of brown sugar and paprika to the rub. Fantastic!!! Will be making this a lot. Thank you sooo much for this recipe.

I have to say I follow the recipe with no changes and it was the best roast pork I ever made! And that sauce can be used with so many different things. 

Made chicken wings and used that sauce with a touch of cayenne pepper and the party couldn't get enough of them.

Thanks so much for this simple amazing recipe!

Made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it.
 I doubled the seasoning mixture and added some olive oil to it. I rubbed it into the roast, wrapped it in plastic wrap and let it sit in the refrigerator for 4 hours.  Longer would have been even better, I think.
For the glaze I used balsamic vinegar and reduced the sugar by about 2 tablespoons since balsamic has sugar in it. I increased the cornstarch to 1 1/2 tablespoons.
The roast only took 1 1/2 hours to cook at 350 F. When it reached temp I had not even made the glaze yet, so I quickly made it and used the broiler to carmelize it. After a couple of coats I flipped it and did the underside.  Sliced it, drizzled additional glaze over the slices, and served. YUM!

I used a boneless, lean pork loin, about 2.5 pounds. I substituted Apple Cider Vinegar for the vinegar.  This turned out so good, it's going to be in our regular rotation.

This pork was fantastic. I cooked mine to 145 degrees. and it was perfectly cooked after sitting/resting for 10 minutes. It was wonderfully delicious and juicy. I made this recipe exactly as shown except for I didn't have sage. My family likes sauce so I doubled the recipe for the sauce for extra dipping on the plate.

I doubled the sauce as others suggested and made it with half brown sugar, half white, half balsamic vinegar, half cider.  Rave reviews from the family.  Prompted me to leave my first review after years of using Allrecipes!  Simple and delicious.

it looks very appetizing and pretty, but was too dry.  I think the time was either too long or the oven temperature was too hot.  The meat inner temperature was 170 degrees.

4 stars for my first try but I'm already thinking of improvements for next time!
Definitely double (or triple) the sauce but don't use all of it for the glaze, keep some to pour on the sliced pork after it's served! Especially if you only cook it as is with no foil or oil and it comes out a little dry. (Which happened to me)
I also tripled the amount of water used for the glaze.
Added in some potatoes later in the roast and then some green beans even later and it was a perfect meal!

Loved it. Used brown sugar but cut it in half. Increased the water to make more juice. Always bury chunks of fresh garlic in my pork which adds to the aroma and the flavor. Cooked it with chunks of red potatoes. Beautiful presentation. Will definitely make it again. (served with parmesan crusted asparagus - also on Allrecpies).

The flavor was great. My only issue was that I cooked it too long and it got a little dry. I used a 4 lb roast and 3 hours was too long. I should have checked the temp around 2 hours. I will make it again - just not cook at long!

I cooked a 2.6lb roast for 1 hr and 45 minutes and it was perfect and juicy. I didn't have soy sauce so I subbed Worcestershire sauce.  Worked great!

We loved this recipe. I, too, used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar. It was a huge success. I rubbed the roast down with herbs and then covered it with the prepared sauce in the crockpot. Cooked on high for three hours. It was falling apart and delicious!!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe with the substitution of balsamic vinegar in place of white vinegar. I put the pork in the crockpot and then rubbed it down with the herbs. I made the sauce and then poured it over the pork and cooked it on high for 3 hours. It was tender, juicy, and delicious!

Really tasty.  Accidentally cooked the remaining sauce too long , so it was a thick sticky syrup.  Still tasted delicious mixed with rice.

I didn't want to get the house all hot in this summer heat, so I tried this recipe on the grill.  I seared it on top and bottom first, then turned the heat down to 325' to cook.  It was great!!  Took closer to 2.5 hours to fully cook.  The kids loved it; they drizzled the extra glaze over their plates.  

While not an Asian recipe, the flavors went  great with a pre-chopped Asian salad I found at Costco, making this one of the easiest dinners I've ever made!

Great flavor and easy enough to make during the week. Sauce had good flavor, I might add a little more vinegar (apple cider) or perhaps some sour cherries to brighten it up even more (for my taste). Cooking time was too long. Perhaps the original recipe is from a time when pork needed to be cooked medium to medium well. Will definitely make it again.

Wow is all I can say! take the advice of others use the brown sugar & balsamic vinegar blend in the glaze. I easily double the rub and cut the sugar, using only about 4 heaping Tbls with 1/3c balsamic vinegar, 1/4c water & about 3 Tbls supreme soy sauce. This was perfect as any other time I've tried to do a loin roast it's always dry ;-( But this was beautiful, tender, and moist! Added cut carrots in last 30 minutes to gather the flavors of the juices. What a meal!

I made this for friends and everyone loved it! I doubled the rub and the sauce and subbed balsamic vinegar and brown sugar in the sauce as recommended and it was delicious! I cooked the pork loin to an internal temp of 145 and it was perfect for us (we like it with a slight pinkish tinge in the middle). I will definitely make this again

It was very good! I had two tenderloin that equaled 2.35 Lbs. I cooked for 70 mins and wish I would've check it earlier because it was at 157 degrees at that time. This issue was an operator error though. I made double the sauce (using balsamic and brown sugar) and then added 1/2 cup water after glazing was done and made a sauce for it. My husband, boys and I loved having the extra sauce! I made it with Jasmine rice and asparagus. Yummy! My boys asked if I would make it again so this will become part of our regular schedule of dinners. Thank you so much!

I will definitely make it again. I followed the recommendations of a couple of other reviews and used balsamic vinegar and doubled the glaze and spices. Cook time was much too long for the loin roast I had. My cut was long and narrow (not a tenderloin though) so I should have used my better judgement and started it MUCH closer to suppertime!

I've tried only a couple of pork loin recipes, most of which were crockpot.  I'll never use the crock again!  After I sliced the pork I then poured the remainder of the sauce over the pork loin to absorb.  The best!

As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the rub and tripled the glaze. I rubbed the roast with the spices and set it in my crock pot with the intention of letting it sit for awhile before cooking. I didn't realize that the crock pot was turned to low when I plugged it in so it began to cook sooner than I expected. Panic sets in once I realized this (an hour later) so I hurried and made the glaze, tripling it as some have suggested. I began adding glaze right away, (brown sugar and balsamic vinegar substituted) and it turned out perfect! My company raved about the flavor and I really don't think you can mess this roast up! No leftovers is always a good thing!

I do not give many recipes 5 stars but, this is very easy and taste very good.  Made this again and we all loved it.  Only wish I had a 5lb roast and mine was only 3 lbs.  I used brown sugar and apple cider vinegar.

so good.

I used apple cider vinegar in the rub mix and slightly cut the top and bottom of the roast and then put it all together in a shallow oven safe dish with some shallots and a bit of water. 

I changed the spices on the rub as well, but only because that's what I had here. I made with gnocchi. so good.

Perfect.  That was the most delicious roast I’ve eaten.  The only change next time is I would cut back the sugar by 1/2.  We are not big on sugar.  The roast was so tender and juicy too.

Made it exactly as the recipe said and loved it. Next time I will double the sauce it was very good and it made amazing sandwiches and pork carne asadas for those of us that are thrifty and make a new  twist on an old recipe with leftovers.

I also substituted balsamic vinegar for the white that was suggested and used a lot of herbs for the rub to make a “crust”. This is an awesome recipe and so easy to make! This was my second time making it and I’ll continue to make this! My whole family loves it! I also use fresh rosemary from my rosemary bush, and the whole house smells amazing!! Great recipe!! You must try it!!!

The 3-hour cooking time is way overstated; I cooked a 4 1/4 lbs roast and it was done in about 1 1/2 hrs.  Luckily, I had a meat probe in the roast for the entire cooking time, and could see when it neared 145 degrees.  Maybe this accelerated cooking time was because I cooked it in a Green Mountain pellet grill, which acts somewhat like a convection oven  The basting sauce was really good, and I received several compliments on it.  Am planning to do again

Very good "platform" for oven pork roast.  I suppose like many, improvised tried and true off the shelf rub stuff rather than worrying about these.  My one reservation is that a 1kg roast done on foil in an open-top roasting pan, was done to perfection in two hours.  In fact I'd thrown in some yams that were underdone when the thermometer signalled the pork was ready, and had to be microwaved separately.  A three hour recipe tempts followers to leave the house or do something time consuming, and the caution would be about returning to overcooked, dried out meat.

Since I don't like sage, I used rosemary. I also agree with some of the other reviewers,  use brown sugar instead of white sugar.

I'll be making this again.

I believe in following the recipe the first time and then tweaking it to your liking after that. But I sliced my roast before cooking for more flavor throughout. It was wonderful.it took less time to cook as well. I finally have a second recipe to use with pork chops or roast. Thanks

This was a nice recipe.  I really liked it and so did my son, hubby was lukewarm because he doesn't like sweet sauces.  It was easy to make and follow this recipe, I didn't change anything.

This was an awesome dish didn't take to many ingredients and was full of flavor. I didn't cook as long,  after an 1 hour 45mins/ 2 hours i took it out. I didn't have a roast pan but used a glass baking dish aligned with foil came out moist and tender , I also double the glaze it. Everyone cleaned their plates!!!

It was delicious, I followed the recipe with no changes. My husband made it a point he liked the roast and would like me to repeat the dish. Nice sweet tangy roast flavor. At first I was fearful about the sweet ingredients but it really did blend well, not overpoweringly sweet. I enjoyed and would recommend trying it out.

I will definitely make this again. I did make some changes because of our schedule today. I  had two 1.5 lb pork loin roasts, I did the rub as the recipe suggested, then I put them in my cast iron dutch oven with a drizzle of olive oil and cooked them in the oven, covered, 275 for 3 hours, then I upped the temperature to 400 and cooked the glaze on them uncovered for about 15 minutes and basted the pork in the glaze before serving. 
Every one of my four picky eating children ate this, my most reluctant pork eater tonight told me after I finally got him to try it, "You could drink this (glaze)  in a cup!" My husband and I both loved it as well. Delicious! I will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe a number of times in the past and went with the recipe at written, plus made more sauce for dipping.  The ONLY correction I would make is about the roasting time and needing much less time, in my experience.  Just did a 4.6lb roast and took it out of oven after 2.5 hours and the temp was about 160.  Super dry by the time we ate.  Next time, if I remember, I'll start checking temp at 1.5 hours.  Otherwise this is such a delicious and simple dish to make.

I cooked this in my electric pressure cooker that also has a saute setting. I did not make any changes and it was delicious. I don't know if I've ever had a better tasting pork in my life. It was moist and juicy and super succulent. My mouth is watering just describing it.

When I made the glaze I inadvertently used brown sugar instead of white.  It was amazing that way.
The roast was tasty and you could taste the herb rub right through.

Great, but double the amount of dry rub,  and liquid quantities. Reduce the roasting time by an hour as well.

Yum! I also used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar  and this was so delicious. Since I was using a tenderloin, I left it to cook in its juices and it only needed an hour. The spice crust was perfect, but if I were using a whole loin I would definitely say to triple it, same with the glaze. This is absolutely replacing my previous balsamic pork roast recipe, plus I love that it packs a ton of flavor without having to marinate. I always forget to start my marinades in time. Paired well with roasted rosemary red potatoes and a simple green salad.

Great recipe. The hubby asked me to save the recipe.

Uhm,  I'm not sure where things went wrong, but I did not enjoy this.....at all.   I made exactly as written but ended up tossing out the sauce.  The spice on the porkloin was mediocre at best.  Sorry, won't be making this again.

This is absolutely delicious. The glaze that is poured over it is fabulous. Only change I made was I didn't use sage (cuz I didn't have any). We love this and will be using it for pork loin from now on. Thanks for the recipe.

I accidentally purchased a bone in loin, so after cutting it off the bone I rubbed with the herb mixture and tied it back on the bone.  I also pocked holes in the meat and stuffed the herb mixture into the holes.  Like others, I tripled the herb rub and doubled the glaze.   I recommend using balsamic vinegar! This roast came out both tender and flavorful.  This is a keeper!!

T I  did , first of all I injected it with homemade garlic butter  then criss crossed the fat side with a knife. I added to th herb mixture herbs du province and a touch of garlic powder, onion salt and pepper for the first 2 hours i wrapped it in bacon then removed it. Then followed the instructions from there except for the last ten minutes I broiled at 450° to caramelize and crispen the top, this came out fantastic! Try it this way and let me know what you think ?

Here's the deal. Use about  4-5 tablespoons of crushed fresh garlic, equal amounts plus of EVOO, S&P to taste. Poke holes in a 4# pork roast, rub the meat, marinate 6+hours. Get to room temp (I left it out for a couple hours) , cook at 350 to a temp of 130. Turn up heat to 400 for a couple minutes. Take out at 133, rest 15 minutes and you've got a slightly light pink in the center, 142 deg, moist, tender flavorful and beautiful carmalized top fat roast!  Took about an hour to roast total. Serve with roasted new red potatoes with fresh dill and a good butter (used KerryGold),  steamed fresh green beans (steam uncover until hot but still snap), and a big mixed salad.   Leftovers for a few days including sandwiches and another dinne!

Had several friends over for dinner and chose this recipe for a 5lb roast.   Great choice because this was the best pork roast I've ever served.    Extremely moist and the flavor was enjoyed by an age span of guests from 10 to 54 year olds.   I do want to say that I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce and used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar, which is a flavor we enjoy in other dishes.

This is the best pork roast I've ever made. I followed the recipe, but only had a 2 pound roast. It was unblievably tender. The favor was excellent. This is a keeper.

Made by the recipe. Doubled all the ingredients. HOWEVER, I tried something. I butterflied the pork roast and layered in stuffing. I would not do that again. I preferred the bites of pork without the stuffing. It was good, but the flavors didn't complement each other. Pork recipe does get 5 stars. My addendum of adding stuffing was not. Pork roast was exceptional.

Easy quick and tasty.  Pay attention to the meat temperature so that it stays moist.    This is the second time I made it and will make again.

A very good bone-in pork roast recipe.  Easy to prepare w/ ingredient on hand.  
I will try this on pork loin in the oven and possibly in my slow-cooker.

Very good recipe! The sauce complimented the pork and made a delectable meal.  For an extra twist by  slicing some mushrooms  and adding them at the end of the baking time .

Hubby gets grumpy when I say pork loin because he had never had a good one before. I made this recipe using a 1 pound pork loin from Trader Joe's and cooking at 325 degrees for 1 hour.  I kept the spices the same, but substituted brown sugar for white and used balsamic vinegar, coated the entire loin on all sides with sauce after 30 minutes of cooking and poured 1/4 cup of a good red wine over the top in the last 15 minutes. Amazing!! Hubby said it was the best he has ever had. Thanks so much for a keeper.

Great recipe, so easy to cook and clean!  The meat turned out super tender, moist and tasty. 

I pretty much followed the recipe, only replaced sugar with honey.  I marinated the meat overnight, then put it in a roasting pan baked at 375 degrees F until meat thermometer reached 150 F degree.   

One reviewer suggested 'do not skip Sage'.  It was a good advice.  Sage gave the wonderful flavor.   

I will keep this recipe and make it over and over again.

Best pork roast ever.  Guest are still remarking on the roast 2 weeks later. Highly recommend and very easy. The video was most helpful. I followed the video. The roast did cook in less time than indicated. So check earlier and you made need to start glazing a half hour earlier

Delicious!  Did use balsalmic and brown sugar.  Added a little EVOO to make the rub more of a paste.  Definitely should have doubled the sauce recipe! And 1/4 cup brown sugar was plenty.

I personally prefer savory over sweet when it comes to meat, however, the big guy likes the occasional sweet glaze so this was for him.  I followed the recipe with the following exceptions, I substituted brown sugar for white, used balsamic vinegar and instead of oven roasting, I used the crockpot setting it on high for 4 hours.  I seasoned the roast, poured in the glaze, set the timer and forgot about it.  Hours later mouthwatering aromas were drifting from the kitchen.  Four hours was perfect timing in the crockpot, the meat was juicy and fork-tender.  I used the glaze-meat dripping mixture to make gravy, thickening with the cornstarch.  Oven roasting makes for a more elegant presentation, crockpot makes for easier preparation, both great options.  The big guy raved about it, so give it a try!

Made this for dinner with the family turned out great! I did double the garlic and the sauce and I drizzled the sauce over it instead of brushing it on, so I didn't brush off any of those delicious crusty herbs :)

This was lovely. I used the extra marinade glaze as a gravy base.  Wonderful. My roast was 3.22 lbs so based on the directions in the recipe I set the timer for two hours. Well the thermometer read done at 1:10, but my guests had not arrived so I had to let it set for a half hour.  The glaze was amazing. I will cook this again.

I made it tonight for my three female Scorpios, all were very pleased with the results.  I'm not a fan of Sage, I substituted with Rosemary.  I read at least one concern about the Corn Starch clumping.  I mixed it with the sugar and there was no clumping.  I'll be making this again.

This turned out great!  My pork roast was about 2 ½ pounds, but I used the full amount of seasonings, adding about 1/2 t. of EVOO to make a paste, then rubbed it on all sides of the roast.  For the glaze, I made the full amount using brown sugar and balsamic vinegar as suggested, but I cut the sugar and cornstarch in half.  It turned out plenty sweet for us, but by cutting the cornstarch it didn’t get quite as thick as I’d like.  But, that’s an easy fix and next time I’ll start with 2 t. and increase it to a full tablespoon if necessary.  Rather than do this in the oven, Hubs grilled it over indirect heat set at about 350 degrees, basting with the glaze during the last twenty minutes.  The roast took an hour and ten minutes to reach 140 degrees, and I let it rest for ten minutes without tenting it, before slicing.  The roast was perfectly cooked and still very moist.  I drizzled on some of the extra glaze when serving.  Both Hubs and I agreed that we’ll do this one again!  And I also think the glaze would do beautifully on a pork tenderloin and maybe even chicken.   For our roast I could have made half the amount of glaze and there would still have been enough for us.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was the most delicious pork I have ever made!! I did double the rub and instead of putting it in the oven I grilled it. The herb crust on the meat was awesome. I also doubled the glaze. I only put that on in the end.. This will be made again and again.

I cooked this dish for my boyfriend today. He loved it. But the problem was I use the wrong kind of soy sauce which made the pork look soooo dark. Inside of the pork still good though.

I made this for my son and daughter in law. It was the best pork  
loin I ever made. They are always dry and tasteless so I never make them. I always use Pork Shoulder but it's too time consuming for weeknights. 
This was fast, moist and delicious. Just doubled the sauce.

Absolutely a 5 star plus!! Love the glaze only substituting brown sugar vs. white and using red balsamic vinegar in place of the vinegar.  This is by far the juiciest, most delicious pork roast I had ever made in my 30 years of cooking.  Thanks for sharing

Just finished making this and my family loved it! I used a loin just under 3 lbs. and per a previous review, doubled the glaze recipe so we would have extra to dip it in. I used red wine vinegar as I did not have balsamic on hand and figured it would be better than apple cider vinegar. I used about 1/2 tsp. of ground sage,  because I didn't have rubbed and I used about 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder because I didn't have fresh garlic. I cooked it for an hour uncovered as called for, adding a small amount of water, then flipped it fat side up and covered it for an hour, worried that it would dry out, prior to adding the glaze. The internal temp went to 180 before adding the glaze. Needless to say, I was worried the additional 30 minutes of glaze time would completely ruin it. I basted it with the glaze for about 15 additional minutes and then poured the remaining glaze over top as called for. I had no reason to worry, it was delicious and moist! This is definitely going in my recipe box!

I made this for my wife for dinner and we both loved it.  I followed the recipe to the tee and it came out very good.  The only issue I had was that I cooked it too long, I cooked it for 2 1/2 hours, the roast was only 2 1/2 pounds and probably would have been cooked in 1 1/2 hours.  The glaze reminded me of Teriyaki sauce and made the roast perfect.  I am going to try the glaze for a few other recipes.

This glaze tasted to much like vinegar to me. But I kept going and it ended up tasting great after it cooked on the meat. Next time I will use just a Tbls of vinegar so I can use the extra for dipping.

I bake this in the slow cooker. While the roast is browning, I pour various seasonings into the slow cooker, then roll the roast around to coat all sides.

This was a great recipe. I changed a few of the directions.  I doubled the pork rubI put the garlic sage, and salt and pepper in a plastic bag and added the pork. I tossed it around until the roast was covered. 
Then I added in the remaining ingredients  and covered the pork on all side with the marinade and left it in the fridge for 4hours. I cooked it on the rotisserie and basted it it a couple of times with the marinade until it was gone. It came out tender and delicious.

This was really, really good! My husband absolutely hates when I do pork roasts because he says I usually dry them out. Not this one, he had seconds! I made it exactly as written, I did double the rub and sauce as another reviewer suggested. I also covered with tin foil and it was fabulous!

This was delicious! I used a 1.5 lb tenderloin and kept the rest of the ingredients the same so I had plenty of sauce. I thought it was a little salty though, so I'll reduce the amount of soy sauce next time.

Made this with the changes recommended by others. Used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar. My roast was about 2 1/2 lbs. cooked for 1 1/2 hours and then another  1/2 to baste. Was a little over cooked will reduce the time down. Was very good and would make again.

The roast was very juicy but the flavor was quite bland. The meat closed to the surface touching the glaze was good but the rest of the part didn't have much flavor. Maybe marinade the roast overnight might help. Probably won't try again. No one liked it at the dinner table.

I made this roast exactly as the recipe said and cooked it in the oven.  It was wonderful, moist and very tender.  My husband said this recipe is definitely a keeper.  Next time I will double the glaze because it was so good we topped the slices on our plates and quickly ran out.  Easy to make more, though, so I'm making another batch to go with our leftovers.

I followed the suggestion of other cooks and used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and balsamic vinegar instead of regular vinegar.  I also doubled the glaze ingredients.  Hubby isn't fond of pork but he had two servings of this dish.  Served with fried potatoes (the glaze was delicious on the potatoes!) and green beans.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is a bi-weekly go-to. Cheap, easy and awesome. Between myself and teenaged son, there is hardly any left. Definitely double the spices and almost triple the sauce. Don't bother with a brush, or you will take the rub off. Pour it and let it drip into the pan below. Then add some cold water corn starch slurry and you have an awesome gravy. I use a probe thermometer and set it for 135F. Take it from the oven and cover in foil for 15-20 minutes and you have some moist, delicious pork! Well done, OP. Oh yeah, as others have stated, use brown sugar and balsamic vinegar!

I followed the receipe step by step. I had 3lbs of pork loin and after 2 hours I added the glaze. The meat came out juicy, sweet and tangy. Simply delicious. It's a keeper for sure. I have also used drippings to make gravy.

Used two smaller roasts (2lbs each) and cooked it for 1.5 hours covered with foil and it was super juicy and delicious! My husband said it was the best pork I have ever made. :)

Adding the brown sugar and balsamic vinegar like many others mentioned took this from three star to 5.  Kids loved it and they normally don't eat pork roasts.  Will be making this one again for sure!

I never rate recipes,but this one is just fabulous and the best I have ever made.  I followed the recipe as written, except for the cornstarch, because I didn't have it.  I will definitely make this again and make sure I have cornstarch.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

Best pork loin I have ever made! Came out tender and juicy and the glaze is amazing! I have made this 3 times so far.. twice for my husband, son, and I and once for my mother and father in law, they all raved about it and ended up emailing the recipe to my mother in law! Thanks for sharing, it has definitely become a favorite in our home!

My husband described this  the best thing I've ever made. it was so easy with 20 minute prep then enough time to watch a movie while it roasts. let them think you slaved over a hot stove four hours, I won't tell!

I was surprised the sauce went with this dish.  It really made a difference.   I would and had to cook the loin just a bit longer even though i took it out and we sliced from both ends.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is easy, and simple.  Sage upsets my stomach so I omitted it, and just used basic salt and pepper.  The glaze was very good.

I  cooked this exacting by the recipe. I also brine it for 4 hours, which I do most of the time. My family thought it was excellent.  The sauce is wonderful.

My 5 star rating is for the glaze! We substituted balsamic and brown sugar as recommended by previous people. We took the pork out of the oven because it was already cooked after 2 hours but we hadn't started glazing it yet,  so we just served the glaze on the side. I would do it this way again because then you can put as much glaze as you want on your pork. We even drizzled it on our Caesar salad it was to die for. I was licking the spoon I'm not kidding! It tasted like tangy molasses....

I only made a couple of minor changes. I did double the glaze as others had suggested. I also started the roast at 315 degrees, for 2 1/2 hours and then when I began basting, increased the oven temp to 330 to get a slight brown on the roast. It was tender, juicy, and wonderful. Even my picky 9 yr old said it was awesome!

I doubled the sauce but used half the sugar and it was absolutely delicious. 5 stars all the way. I may sear the pork loin before placing it in the oven next time.

This is a great start!  I added brown sugar to the rub and just a little white sugar to the glaze.  My husband who has Southern roots and loves pork, and says it is the best baked pork loin he has ever had.  I eat pork reluctantly, but *I* also enjoyed this.  I think putting brown sugar in the rub and making sure that you pull the meat between 140 and 145 degrees and cover with foil for 10 mins before eating are key!  I also used Balsamic vinegar, as suggested by others.  It is now ok to eat pork less than well done and makes it so much better.  I only took one star off because there is no brown sugar in the rub.

This recipe was amazing. Absolutely delicious! I used this for a bone-in pork roast and added onion, carrots and celery to the pot. The flavor of the roast and the veggies was fabulous. The leftover pork made wonderful fried rice the next night. I added some of the leftover sauce in the rice. Yum! I will be making this many, many times.

I was in a hurry and threw ALL of the ingredients into one giant bowl on top of the already waiting pork roast and mixed then threw it straight into the oven.  YUM, YUM, DOUBLE FRICKIN YUM!  My good Lord this is one delectable dish. Big thanks for sharing your idiot-proof(that's me) recipe so I looked like a champ when my hubby came home. :-) We ate the entire thing down to the last bite.

Hands down BEST pork roast EVER.  Of course there is ample room to give it your own touch - I added a few more fresh herbs since I had them on hand.  Spectacular.

I had left the next day, but was so glad when I returned that my husband had saved me some of the leftovers.

We enjoyed this, though I did double the seasoning mix.  I significantly cut back on the cook time since my pork loin was much smaller- I just cooked to 145.

I used raspberry balsamic vinegar and put some water in the pan. I minced the garlic instead of crushing it.  I will definitely make it again. It turned out moist and juicy.

Very juicy and easy to make.  I had about a 3.5# roast so it only took about 1.5 hours.  We packed it up and ate some after a concert.  It was still very moist. I took some direction from other posts and made a double batch of sauce but it wasn't needed.  I did spread double the seasonings on it before I baked it and I'm glad I did. By the way that was no hashtag kiddies.

Wondful recipe with tons of flavor. I made a 3 and 1/2 lb sirloin that took about an hour and a half to finish start to finish. I highly recommend a meat thermometer because remember pork does not always turn white even after done, and relying on color alone could lead to overdone meals. I loved this dish and will make it again!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I too used balsamic vinegar in lieu of white vinegar.  The roast was so moist it fell apart.  Next time I make it I will be making a double batch of sauce!  The family has asked me to make it again today; they inhaled it yesterday, no leftovers!

Basic rub with a yummy glaze. I would reduce the baking time though, unless you want your meat to be dried out. Rule of thumb is 20 min/lb, give or take. 3 hours was too long. I pulled it out much earlier and it was still over cooked, in my opinion.

Victory! Everyone in the family enjoyed it. To be exact, 3 out of 4 LOVED it and the picky one didn't complain once! Had it with salad and a side of rice cooked with beef broth and minced onion. Would have loved to toss in mushroom but didn't want to take any chances. :-) So tasty. This roast pork recipe is a keeper for sure!

OMG this was so good. I used a bone in pork roast (had it on hand) and added some fresh thyme and crushed rosemary. I didn't change anything else and it was soooo good!  The glaze really made this recipe.

Wonderful!  I did have a change that some may like.  I only had a 3lb pork loin because I was only cooking for two and I kept the same measurements for the rub and sauce.  I like big flavor and I thought this turned out great.  If I had used a 5lb I think I would have been a little disappointed with the amount of seasoning.  Because it was so small, I only had to cook it for about an hour and a half and it came out very tender and juicy.

Made this for the family this week and it was AWESOME. I did cheat and used a rosemary herb rub but the sauce was fantastic. Simple straight forward recipe that ended up better than expected.
Served with Orzo and spinach.

Loved it.  Made it with all kinds of pork.  I do adjust the amount of rub and sauce based on the amount of meat.  Never any leftovers.

I made this for the first time this evening. My husband & I both loved it. I took one of the suggestions & made double the rub & glaze & am glad that I did. It was perfect that way. My husband has made several comments about how much he liked it, both during dinner & since - all of about 45 minutes, so obviously we will be having this again!

Tried making this with balsamic vinegar and brown sugar as other reviewers suggested, it was amazing! 5 stars with this slight change.  We especially loved it with creamy noodles as a side.

Loved it! Moist and flavorful. Used Brown sugar and balsalmic suggestion.
I had a 5.5 lb roast which took close to 3 hours at 350. Delicious.

This is hands down the BEST pork I have ever made or tasted.  It may even be the best thing I've ever made.  I use a 2 pound tenderloin and triple the spice rub (just double the garlic).  I also use brown sugar and balsamic vinegar in the sauce.  I also roast it on a rack, just so air can circulate around the meat.  Just be very careful and don't overcook it--nothing worse than dry pork!

I added the olive oil like in the video,  it was wonderful and the glaze (I used apple cider vinegar) and it kept the roast moist. I paired it with Herbed Scalloped Potatoes (recipe by Autumn Pumpkin on Allrecipes) really good together.

Seriously, this marinade rocked my face off.... I did as the other reviewers recommended and doubled the rub, tripled the glaze (serving it in dishes on the side for my diners), and it was awesome.  So good, in fact, that I saved both the sauce and the leftover pork, and turned it in to sweet and sour stir fry the next dy ( with some fresh pineapple, green beans, chopped carrots, and broccoli over rice - a perfect use of leftovers, and two incredible company worthy dishes... Kudos

I made this the other night using a 3 pound boneless, center cut pork roast. After rubbing the sage, etc. mixture over the roast, I placed it into a plastic bag and put it in the refrigerator for 1 hour. I also used brown sugar instead of white and good Balsamic vinegar in the glaze. When the roast reached 125 deg., I started to baste it and took it out of the oven at 135 deg. I tented it with foil for 15 minutes, then sliced and served it with extra glaze on the side. It was so juicy, we really didn't need the extra glaze. We had leftovers 3 days later and it was just as delicious and tender as the first time. I will definitly make this again.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe but am putting it to the fact that I did not use a pork tenderloin but rather the very large pork loins from Costco. I substituted flour for corn starch and the sauce may have been a bit too starchy. I added some chili flakes to spice it up a bit but it had an overwhelming balsamic taste. At any rate, the MOST important helpful hint I can offer is to use a digital meat thermometer. Remove the roast at 138-140 and let it sit. It will continue to cook. If you cook it to the recommended 170 (Food Code) it will be inedible. It was juicy but not very flavorful. I doubled the spices but could have used more salt. Might make it again with a much smaller piece and use a true tender loin. Also, I seared the hunk of meat with a bit of olive oil to hold in the moisture prior to placing in the oven.

Wow. This was so good and tender. I was skeptical about using the rubbed sage because I don't like the flavor but it was barely noticeable.  It gave the pork a nice flavor. I used the amount of dry spices on a 1.5 lb pork loin and doubled the sauce. On the vinegar I used white balsamic and only used 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons.  Used 5 cloves of garlic. I cooked it for 1hr and 10 minutes.  The basting is a must. Also placed the loin on a rack so it did not sit in the juices.  Next time I may add the juices to the sauce.  Thank you for the recipe. This is a keeper and I will make this again for New Years.

My family LOVED this!  I used a 3 lb pork sirloin, and it was done in about 1 1/2 hrs (145 degrees).  Doubled the herb portion, used brown sugar instead of white, and Apple juice instead of water for the glaze.  Used my small turkey roaster pan (no cover or foil).  Excellent, will be making this often!

Fantastic recipe, but like some others have said triple the sauce and next time I'll double the rub. It didn't take 3 hours so use a meat themometer

Ok, I overcooked my pork, but the sauce is sooo good, I didn't even care!  This is a keeper, and the glaze would be yummy on chicken and fish as well.  Try it!

This was delicious!!!  As one reviewer suggested, I subbed the white vinegar for balsamic, and the white sugar for brown, and the results were fantastic!  My husband and 6 year old son request this stay in the regular rotation. They both went back for seconds.

Very good but yeah, I tripled the seasonings. Slow roasted the pork, poured out the drippings and then poured over the glaze-- it reduced itself into a sticky goodness at the bottom of the pan I used for sauce. Not enough for the leftovers so I had to make more. Instead of water in the glaze I used cranberry juice, half the amount of sugar, and half balsalmic/half apple vinegar. Really yummy! I also cut up garlic and placed clove slivers into slits in the meat while it roasted. So delicious. I will be making this again. My family went nuts over it. Thanks for making me look like a gormet chef. :-)

Awesome recipe! Simple and delicious. A neophyte can make this and impress even the most finicky diners. The glaze works well with the spices and can be used to coat vegetables, like carrots and potatoes.

Really great taste.  I did as others mentioned and doubled the rub, then used brown sugar and balsamic.  Great flavour with those changes.  Used a pork loin and a tenderloin.

My entire family raved about this one! I made a double batch of the sauce and they poured it on the rice & the veggies that I served as sides. I did use apple-cider vinegar and brown sugar as substitutes. My roast was a half a 5 pounder. I don't know the exact weight, but it only took about 1.5 hours to reach the correct temp. Absolutely fabulous!!!

So moist, juicy, delicious and easy to make!  My pork loin was small, and I baked it for 1 hour.  For sugar I used brown sugar and the vinegar was apple vinegar.  
Great recipe, my family loved it!

I made this recipe with a 3.5 lb. pork loin and it came out great! My husband and father both loved it. I did the same recipe the next day with bone-in skin-on chicken breast and it was also delicious! The sauce is amazing and so easy! I did add a little olive oil to the seasoning and rubbed all over the pork which may or may not be needed. Also used a Pyrex baking dish and set oven temp to 350. Roasted for about 2 hours.

Excellent! I followed the recipe almost exactly - reduced the amount of soy sauce and increased the brown sugar. It was tasty but I will add more herbs next time and reduce the soy a bit more that way the herbs are not overpowered. I will make this again.

My husband has always said he does not like pork loin.  I don't eat much meat, but I took a chance on buying a pork loin in the hopes that my husband would "endure" it because I got it at a very good price.  Having followed this recipe as written, I then placed sliced portions on his plate and froze the remainder.  He did not complain (okay, he isn't a complainer anyway)!  He did not "endure" his meal!  He devoured his meal and complimented my cooking skills on making a pork loin taste this great!  He even for a second portion and if there was more so he could take a sandwich to work the next day.

I used a packet of Weber garlic and herb seasoning to make a rub (added a little lemon juice to it so it made a good rub).  Rubbed the paste into the pork loin, added all the ingredients listed above also and marinated overnight.  Placed in crockpot on low the next morning, added 1/2 cup white wine to the bottom of the crockpot and let it cook for eight hours.  Drained the liquid,  made the sauce and poured over the loin and let it cooked another thirty minutes.  It was fabulous.  Everyone raved and my three granddaughters (ages 2,2, and 6) loved it.  There were no leftovers.  My roast was 5 lbs.  The roast was very moist, tender and full of flavor.   I was a little unsure about the sage, but followed the advice of other posts and increased the amount.  It was wonderful!  I used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar.

This is my ultimate "go-to" recipe for pork. I cook it low and slow in the oven or sometimes in my crock pot. I serve the glaze in a gravy bowl separately so people have the option to add it or leave it. To each their own, but I personally love it with the glaze! Excellent recipe. Going to keep this in my recipe files forever!

I rarely make pork tenderloin but thanks to this recipe, it'll go on our menu frequently. This recipe was delicious! My picky husband loved it and couldn't stop complimenting it. The flavors were outstanding between the rub and the sauce. We served it with rice, broccoli and sautéed mushrooms. I didn't have sage so I substituted poultry seasoning instead of the sage. Definitely a keeper!!

Delicious.  I've never attempted to make a pork roast before, and I'm very glad I came across this recipe.  Made this for my friends and hubby and everyone loved it!  It turned out super moist and the flavours were extraordinary.  I used apple cider vinegar and almost doubled the amount of herbs.  I had a 2 lbs roast in the oven for 2 hours and 15 minutes before drizzling the glaze on (I didn't want to chance scraping off the herbs.)  And I did that once every ten minutes for the last half hour.  Anyway, it was perfect.  I can't wait to make this for a larger family gathering!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a truly amazing recipe. I always get lots  of compliments on this dish. Like everyone else, I at least double but usually triple the sauce.

Had this dish tonight for dinner & it is a winner!  We loved the tangy/sweet sauce.  I did use flour and waited until after it was boiling before adding.  Again, excellent and a keeper for sure.

Not really much of a pork loin fan so I like to try different ways to enhance the flavor and this recipe did the trick! The juice from the glaze kept the meat nice and tender. I also added a little water at the bottom of my roasting pan to keep it from drying out. I'm not sure if that's what should be done always, but chances are if I use my roasting pan, I always put water on the bottom. I will be using this recipe again.

Awesome. Delicious flavor! Served for Christmas dinner and only one tiny slice left. I doubled the rub and glaze as per some suggestions but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Will definitely serve this again!

This recipe makes the best pork loin! So tender. I add about 1/4 cup brown sugar on top of the pork loin as well, and usually put the pork loin in the freezer for about 1/2 hour before cooking it. I get compliments from family on the flavor and tenderness each time I use this recipe.

Next time use balsamic vinegar.  Also double the spices for the rub since there wasn't enough.  Otherwise it was really good and moist.

The pork was so tender! The glaze is to die for! I used a lot more herb rub, but next time I'm going to try a Cajun style rub since my husband and I both love spicy food. This is defintely going into the dinner rotation!

Made this for my in-laws last night and it was a major hit!  I followed directions exactly (I only cooked for 2 hours and took out and covered with foil for 20 mins or so).  I do think that 3 hours is way too long ~ cut a little and look inside at 2 hours to see if you think it is done ~ so it doesn't get dried out. Perfect and will make again!

Was wonderful!  Double the sauce.  Be careful with the cooking time.  The recipe calls for a 5 lb roast cooking for 3 hours.  I had a 3 lb roast, and it was done in under an hour.  So just keep an eye on it.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I read other reviews where people had switched out white sugar for brown and switched out the white vinegar for balsamic and that was definitely the way to go. I actually found an orange blossom balsamic vinegar that gave the pork a hint of fruity flavor. I also added a tablespoon of sriracha as someone else recommended and it was just the perfect amount of zip. I served it with roasted Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, potatoes and tomatoes. Rave reviews. I will definitely make this again

Loved this recipe. I also used balsamic vinegar, doubled the spices, and doubled the glaze (except for the sugar). I didn't have minced garlic so I used garlic powder in the rub. My 3 1/2 lb. pork roast took about 1 hour and 45 minutes. I drizzled on half the glaze about 15 minutes before the end and the other half about 5 minutes before the end of the cook time.  I served with mash potatoes- kids and grownups all raved. My new favorite way to prepare a pork roast.

This tastes so good it could come from a restaurant :) I have never made a pork roast that tasted this good before! Cooked for about 30 min at 350 and tented with foil for 10 minutes and it was juicy, tender and pink inside.

I thought it was fantastic, but my husband didn't care for the glaze. He said it tasted too strongly of vinegar. I thought it was a perfect balance of sweet and tart.

My husband loved this.  Since we tend to eat early due to our work schedule, I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of using a pork butt with a bone and put it in the crockpot with a 1/2 c of water and let it cook on low while at work.  When I go home  I took it out of the crockpot and let it rest while making the glaze.  When the glaze was ready I poured it over the pork after having pulled it.  It had a great recipe and considered it a great success.  It was different than the same old pork roast that I usually would fix and will do this again.

Very good recipe but the sauce was a bit sweet for me.  I used balsamic vinegar, and added 1/4 cup of red wine to the glaze to make it less sweet.  I also topped it with onion.   The glaze would be great as a base for a beef jerky marinade !

The most amazing pork I've ever had. I used this for pork chops because I never like pork chops. I think they are always too dry. Disgusting. But this was SOOOO fantastic! I used brown sugar instead of white which I think added more to the flavor. If I could give this more than five stars I would in a heartbeat!! A go to recipe, for sure.

This recipe is fantastic! I only made 2 alterations: I used pork chops instead of pork loin, and I tripled the spices and sauce (so that I could accommodate for the extra surface area of the pork chops).  I will be using this recipe again, and soon! The sauce is good all alone. It tastes a like teriyaki and I think I will use it as such in the future for other recipes. There were no downsides to this recipe, I absolutely loved it.

Fabulous.  Made for company the first time.  Everyone loved it.  I tripled the seasonings and rolled the roast in it.  It only took two hours to cook.  Was happy I had a meat thermometer.  Great recipe.  Easy recipe.  Thank you!!

Everyone really really loved it, I was not to fond of the glaze, it just really didn't match the rest of the recipe. But the pork alone after the herb rub was amazing!

Good stuff! I thought I overdid the seasonings at first but it it turned out well. Ended up only leaving it in the oven for 2 hours, leaving the meat soft on the inside.

This was awesome.  I am usually a slow cooker person for roast, but I am converted to the oven.  It fell apart, but stayed incredibly moist, and had a ton of flavor.  A big keeper

GREAT recipe! We LOVED it. I actually made mine in my slow cooker (10 hours on Low) since I work all day and it was a total hit. My husband loved it and has been talking about it since. I used balsamic as well, but I am sure it would be fine with whatever you have on hand.

Pretty good flavor. I removed most of the fat from my roast, so my pan was pretty dry and I had trouble with the glaze burning on the bottom of the pan. Since it didn't specify what type of vinegar, I used balsamic. May make again and play around a bit. Might actually be better in a slow cooker.

The pork itself was good- I had to use a few different seasonings due to what I had on hand. However, it was the sauce that did it for me. Love this! THANKS!

Excellent flavor!  I also doubled the rub & doubled the marinade, but kept all proportions of ingredients the same.  The only thing I added was sliced garlic inserted into the meat.  My whole family loved it!  Thanks for sharing it.

The best roast I've ever cooked! I did it for company my first time trying the recipe. Even tough thats a no no it came out fantastic. I was very happy with it. Truly sweet and sour tasting. Delicious! I'm cooking it for the third time in a month tonight.

Great dish with a couple revisions. I rolled in Italian bread crumbs per another review. For the glaze, I used Ken's Steakhouse Raspberry Pecan salad dressing instead of the recipe glaze.

I have given up trying to slow roast a loin. I now start every roast at 550 degrees.   As soon as my remote meat thermometer makes the first move I drop the temperature to 425 degrees. When it reads about 138-142 degrees depending on the size I pull it and tent with foil.   Let it stand at least until the temperature is no longer climbing, longer is better and slice thin.   Never misses and I find I can serve it with a thin sauce thats hot and get a good bit of flexibility on the time

My family loves this roast and asks for it every Xmas.  They think it's difficult to make because of how good it tastes.  Really, it is super easy!  My only suggestion is to double the rub and glaze; the flavor will be amazing.

I have a jar of sage that I had buy for just for this recipe- totally worth it. Its hard for me to find recipes that my whole family will eat because my boyfriend and I like SPICY but my dad likes his food as plain as possible. Although he's gotten better as he's got older, but god forbid you do anything other than boil or bake the Irish man's potatoes! **I recommend making extra sauce if you are a sauce person- I like to use the extra as gravy for mashed potatoes.

I make this over and over.  Amazing.  It never takes 3 hours though.  Take it out of the oven when the temperature reaches 150-155 and it will be super moist.  LOVE this!!!  It usually takes me about 1 hour and 15.  Do not overcook or it will be tougher and not as moist.

I think the rub is key to this recipe.  I doubled the rub ingredients, and used some in the glaze.  I used low sodium soy sauce, and had to use a little more constarch because the glaze wasn't "sticking" to the roast well.

I am going out of town, and I had a pork loin the the fridge that I needed to cook before it went bad. I just located this recipe this morning and followed nearly completely. This is my first time make a pork roast, but it is absolutely delicious. The only changes I made were to (1) double the rub, (2) added minced garlic, half a tbsp of butter, and dashes of sage and onion power to the glaze, and finally shortened the cooking time to around 2 hours. My meat thermometer read 160 well be for the 3 hour mark.  Thanks!

Incredible!  We ate ourselves silly tonight!  I only used a 2 lb. pork sirloin, but as some reviewers mentioned, we still doubled the rub (so it was like a crust) and doubled the sauce, as well.  Addictive!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!!

What a great recipe. Followed recipe exactly but doubled the glaze. Was skeptical when reading recipe but after preparing WOW! What great flavor combinations. The glaze was excellent and even went well with garlic mashed potatoes. Kudos!

This tasted very good. I did not have a roasting pan. So I cooked it in a slow cooker on high for 4 hours. I added some water ans worcestershire sauce because I did not have any broth. It tasted great. I also doubled the glaze like others suggested.

I add a little more garlic... and sometimes leave out the sauce to make a pork fried rice. Just chop up the cooked pork and add it to cooked rice, peas, carrots, and scrambled eggs. Awesome! :)

This was really good. I doubled the sauce and the rub and cooked it to 160F - probably overcooked it a little bit but it was still delicious. Thanks for the tasty recipe.

Easy and delicious! My family loved it. Do double the sauce. I made the mistake of trimming as much fat off as possible so I had some dry ends. Next time I will probably put foil over for the last half hour to prevent this. I found pork loins at a dollar per pound and bought four not knowing what to do with them. Best deal I have made this year thanks to this recipe.

I've never cooked a loin of pork before so I was really worried about it coming out tender and tasting good. Well, this recipe exceeded my expectations and I just went to the store and bought 2 more pork loins to cook because everyone loved this recipe! I pretty much followed the recipe except I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce only because I didn't have any soy on hand. It still came out amazing and added a little bit of a different tang to it that I don't think the soy would have added. Instead of brushing the sauce on little by little I did what another reviewer said and poured it on all at once. Well, next time I'm definitely going to take the time and do it right because I think it would have tasted even better because it only had a thin coat of glaze and that sauce is too good to just sit at the bottom of the pan. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent!  The only things I did differently were:  Used 1/4 C brown sugar and 1/4 C honey Poured the glaze over the roast and let cook 30 minutes instead of brushing it on - came out great!

I made this the other night for dinner.  It was DELICIOUS!  The flavors were wonderful together.  I used a 2 lb. roast and it was a perfect amount of sauce.  So I would for sure double the sauce if your roast is bigger.

The best roasted pork recipe I've tried. Just go ahead and double the sauce -- it's so good that you'll hear complaints if there's not extra for drizzling on the plate.

LOVE this recipe!  My husband is crazy about it and tells me how much he likes it between every bite.  I have made it with bone in and boneless pork shoulder and both work well (I think the bone in should be cooked to a slightly higher temperature though - mine came out pretty rare).  I browned the roast in a pan first and then followed the recipe.  Thank you so much!

Delish! This recipe was fantastic and my husband and I had to make ourselves stop eating it. :) I too used the balsamic vinegar, doubled the sauce and found that it cooked in far less than 3 hours. I served it over rice and sauteed some apples on the side. Would be great with pineapple too.

This was fantastic!  I had a few minor "accidents" in making it - almost 1/4 cup too little sugar, cooked 50 degrees higher than intended, couldn't put on the glaze due to it being done an hour earlier than expected.  Despite these "accidents," it turned out wonderful.  I poured the glaze on top while serving and everybody raved.  One minor intentional change: I added about a tablespoon more of the soy sauce because the glaze was a tad too sweet for our tastes.  (And I use light sodium soy instead of regular.)  I served this with a standard salad and basmati rice.  The glaze was also great on the rice - almost like chutney.  Definitely a keeper!

My wife and I both enjoyed this recipe.  I used a 5 1/2 lb. loin and the cook time was way too long.  I give this five stars because the overcooked meat was still delicious.  It was my fault for not checking the temp. sooner.

Lots of great flavor and tender. I did brine my pork loin prior to cooking. The sauce is great...I doubled it and I tripled the spices along with cutting the loin and inserting the garlic slivers.

I made this with 2 one-pound pork loins.  I used the brown sugar, basalmic vinegar, and garlic salt in place of regular salt according to the suggestions, as well as added honey and a bit of ginger to the glaze.  I confess I mixed the glaze, including the cornstarch, and let it sit by the stove until I was ready to cook it.  I cooked the pork uncovered for 1 hour and set the glaze on for 1/2 hour.  Oh, yummy yum yum!  I was skeptical when I smelled the glaze, but my doubts were laid to rest when we ate.  I will for sure make this again! Thank you!

Thanks Wendee for sharing this really great recipe!  I didn't have any vinegar on hand, so I used red wine instead and it worked fine.  I tripled the amount of sauce (as recommended by other reviewers).  I think I would double the amount of spices if I used a larger cut of meat too. I used a 3 lb pork shoulder instead of tenderloin and it was still great.  Just remember use a meat thermometer to ensure doneness.

Really, relly good.... I followed the recipe, with the exception of using balsamic instead of white vinegar, also used about 1/4 cup of apricot preserves with the herbs for the rub. I marinated it overnight. I also used some chicken broth in the bottom of the pan as I basted it..in an attempt to deglaze a bit..I was looking for a sauce I could used to pour over the meat once cooked.  I thickened the pan contents with some cornstarch and water, and it made an awesome glaze. The meat was soooooo tender, and had a great sweet, crispy crust. I cant wait for sandwiches tomorrow...great recipe..a nice change from the plain old crock pot treatment I usually give to pork loin.

This was a very good recipe, but I'm not giving in 5 stars b/c I wasn't too crazy about the combination of the sauce with sage. I made this for Valentine's Day dinner w/ my hubby. I used a 2 lb. pork loin, so I cut the cooking by about half. I still made a full recipe of sauce & it was just enough. I'd really like to try this with chicken, so if anyone has already tried it, let me know how it turned out. :)

This one definitely made it to the "keeper" list.  I followed the recipe to the T with the exception of the size of the roast.  I added garlic roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts as sides and got rave reviews.

I doubled the spices. Coated roast in evoo and then rubbed. Let it sit for a little while before roasting. Covered loosely until the last half hour then removed foil and basted frequently with glaze. I added balsamic and worcestershire to the glaze and I think a little brown sugar too. Anyway... used a four pound roast and cooked for about 2 hours. Came out PERFECT!.  I also made a basic brown gravy with beef stock and after the gravy was done dumped all the pan drippings into the gravy boat and stirred it up. Was delicious!

I liked this recipe, it was a change from the old sauerkraut pork thing... I took a reviewers advise and doubled the sauce, but it was not necessary for me as I did not pour the additional sauce over roast. I gave everyone the option to brush on extra sauce if they wanted to by keeping it on the side.

Great Roast!!  I used 3 1/2 pound pork roast.  Baked @ 250 for 3 hours and then glazed for another 1/2 hour @ 350.  Definately double the sauce and use and gravy over steamed rice.  It is also really good with a bit of fresh ginger in the sauce.

I made this for dinner tonight and it got big raves. I followed the recipe and the only thing I did different was to take the drippings from the pan and make a little gravy to drip the meat in. It was wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing this terrific recipe.

Although I am not a new cook there just some things I've never made before, pork loin is one of them. I was looking to find an easy no fail recipe. THIS IS IT! Since I made it the first time my mother keeps showing up with pork loin and asking if I will make it again. I used garlic powder after the first time because the crushed garlic moistens the spices and makes the coating uneven. We had this for company and got rave reviews. Lovely, simply lovely.

This was hands down the best pork roast recipe I have tried.  As other reviewers suggested, I used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar.  The only change I would make next time is to double the basting sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We just made this tonight for our New Year's day meal. I thought it was very delicous and a great cut of meat, especially for the price. The seasoning was very good and made the edges a bit crispy/crunchy. The presentation was beautiful. We did NOT take people's suggestions of brown sugar and balsamic vinegar (because didn't have these things), and I do think this would have made it better. We doubled the sauce but didn't end up using so much of it. If I were to make it again, I'd try to find a healthier sauce for it - I think this was too strong, overpowered the pork, and no need to be so heavy. Other than that, delicious!

This recipe is one of the best pork dishes that I have ever made (or tasted)!  Even my fiance, who is a very picky eater, loved it.  I used a smaller roast, about 2.5 lbs, with the same amount of sauce (only cooked it for about an hour and a half, and it came out perfect!  Great recipe to share!

This recipe was delicious! I added ginger and garlic to the sauce and doubled the rub recipe. I didn't have sage so I used italian seasoning and it came out great. Pork was sooo tender and juicy and YUM.

I figured this would just be a 4 star, however using pork tenderloin and apple cider vinegar made this a great meal. I added some white pepper to the sauce to distract from the sweetness in the sugar. Turned out great.

I made this for the second year in a row for a holiday gathering.  This time I used tenderloins and cooked less time according to the directions on the tenderloins.  The flavor was wonderful and they were excepionally tender.  The dish is BEAUTIFUL and everyone was very impressed (and this is so easy),

This was really tasty! I made it with a pork loin I had lying around. I used low sodium soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. Skipped the cornstarch since balsamic thickens nicely when boiled down and used 2 tbsp of brown sugar instead of white. I also added some thyme, rosemary and onion powder to the rub.

Awesome.  We like crispy edges, so we actually cut the roast into slices and rub each one individually (double the rub ingredients).  It cooks a great deal faster, as well.

Delicious! Pork can be blah if it's not dressed up with some fun flavors and this recipe does it! I cut slits in the roast and stuffed garlic slices inside. I also doubled the garlic and added an herb blend and olive oil to the rub. Roasted it in the oven and then basted with the sauce..I used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar like another cook suggested and it came out great! Served with baked potatoes,cranberry sauce and sauteed brussels sprouts. Awesome!

I would really give this a 3.5 rating but wasn't willing to bump to the 4.  Made this with the changes that most reviewers made in that I at least doubled the garlic, one clove isn't enough to justify the peeling and stickiness nor does it do any good in my opinion! I subbed brown sugar for the white and balsamic vinegar and also doubled the sauce.  The sauce was pretty good, my husband and son loved it, I thought it was good but don't really think people are rating things properly when giving 5's.  That in my opinion is and should be saved for those special dishes that are absolutely something so magnificent you can't believe you made it yourself.  so, with that being said, the pork is GREAT but anyone can make it and I won't be raving and or craving about it! Oh, served with rice on the side and also baked it at 350 for about 1.5 hrs and it was just right.

My mom first tried this recipe a couple months ago and has been on me about also trying it because she said it was so good.  Well, I finally tried it, and Moma was right - this pork is sooooo good!  I can't even write a good enough review that would do this pork roast justice.  It is that dern good!

I doubled the herbs, included suggestion of adding thyme, rosemary and red pepper flakes. I did baste it with sauce over the last half hour or so.  It is truly
AWESOME. My husband said he will definitely eat it again. A different 
pork roast recipe with outstanding flavor.

This was the best pork loin I have ever made.  Even my mom who hates sage said that it tasted like something you would get at a restaurant, and she gave it a 5 out of 5! My 4 year old absolutely loved it, he ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. I will definitely make this again!

This is excellent!  I followed other's suggestions and I doubled the ingredients on the rub. I pushed crushed garlic into holes in the meat. I covered it for the first two hours and cooked it at 300 degrees.  When I basted it, I first took a knife and stabbed it so the sauce would seep into the meat better.  My family loved it.

This is luscious!  The first time I made it my husband said  - You can make this anytime!  I substituted the balsamic vinegar (as others did) and also at least double the spices.  It has fantastic flavor and with the balsamic vinegar, the glaze is really delicious!

This recipe was EXCELLENT - but I did make the minor adjustments suggested others. I doubled the spice rub, added rosemary, thyme and red pepper flakes, and pushed slivers of garlic into small slices I made in the pork. The sauce was divine, I didn't change a thing - it complemented the flavor of the pork perfectly. I tented the roasting pan and and cooked the loin for about an 1.5 hours (my loin was only 2.5 lbs). Perfection!

My husband liked this more than me.  The glaze was nice, but I wish I would have cut up the pork or something, so the flavor could get on the inside.  I also tried to cut little holes to push some garlic inside the pork.

This was good. We had to go somewhere while the roast was in the oven (about an hour) so I had to put it into the crockpot and threw in the sauce ingredients plus a little more water. Came out great!! My husband liked it and he usually wont eat pork..

Easy dish. I too doubled the sauce. I thought it needed a little more "umph" so I added red pepper flakes to the glaze. After the glaze was off the heat I added crushed garlic. A very nice dish served with Jasmine rice and fresh green beans.

This pork was a winner with my family.  I sliced my pork loin in half to season.  I used garlic salt, garlic powder, season salt and pepper.  The sauce was great!  The kids loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely wonderful! Works well with pork loin or tenderloin. Very simple, economical and flavorful. This dish has become a regular in our household -- satisfying small children and a finicky husband. Great week night meal.

Absolutely excellent.  However, there were 2 things I will adjust next time. One, I will shorten the cooking time because this was a bit dry (still tasty though!). Secondly, I doubled the sauce/glaze but I either added too much vinegar or something. So, I will adjust that. No matter though, this is a pretty forgiving recipe. Wonderful flavor.

This was unbelieveably good.  It smelled fantastic while cooking and tasted even better.  Like other reveiwers, I doubled the sauce recipe.  The kids loved it and my husband, who usually doesn't say too much, just raved.  It was also easy to prepare.  I can't wait to try the leftovers.  I will definitely make this again - OFTEN!

Superb!  I used balsamic vinegar and 2 tbsp of flour instead of cornstarch.  The roast was very tender and flavorful.  This is certainly a keeper.

Very simple and so much flavor. Next time I would double the rub, but otherwise perfect.

My husband wanted to know immediately when we were going to have this again.  Since I found this site we rarely ever have the same dish twice!  I promised it would be "soon" ;-)

I wish there were more stars to give this recipe.  This roast pork was absolutely fabulous!  I took the advice of a few reviewers and cooked this under tented tinfoil.  It was extremely juicy and flavorful.  It did have a bit of a teryaki flavor, must be the soy sauce.  Anyway, 5 stars and more.  My husband absolutely loved this!  I will be sure to make it again and again.

This was a great recipe.  I used red wine vinegar as it was all I had on hand.  It was a little bit overwhelming, next time I will try something different, but it still turned out great

Delicious!  My husband is typically the cook of the house, after I made this he decided that I should take things over.  The glaze is awsome without being too tangy or sweet.  We will definitely make again

I also doubled the sauce, and used a boneless pork roast (not a tenderloin)and it was moist and tender.  Used the balsamic vinegar and it was soooo tasty.  Husband loved it.

I pretty much followed this recipe to the letter, but I did use just plain red wine instead of vinegar.  It came out great and I had no leftovers even though I had five pounds of meat!

We LOVED this. I didn't like the sauce by itself but when put on the meat it was awesome. Hubby also loved it on his rice.

I did do a couple things different though. I took some of the other peoples advice and doubled the spices.

Then I put the meat in tinfoil and put it in my roaster with some water on the bottom. Turned out very moist!!

Some people on here mentioned they used balsamic...so I tried it and yuck. My advice follow the original for the sauce.

Outstanding!  After reading the reviews, I used fresh sage and crushed it with my mortar and pestle.  I also used a 1# pork tenderloin, but the full amount of herbs and sauce.  This is my new favorite roast pork recipe.

I just made this dish and I got rave reviews - even the picky 5 year old asked for seconds! 
I only had dried sage so I added two teaspoons of it and used balsamic vinegar as suggested in a previous review. I also used the juices and glaze in the bottom of the pan with a brown gravy. This is a keeper :)

I'm anxious to try this recipe after reading the reviews, but I am concerned because alot of the reviewers used pork tenderloin instead of a pork loin roast.  In my opinion they are as opposite as apples and oranges.  Pork tenderloin tastes good no matter how you cook it (within reason).  A roast is a little harder to get right.

This was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly but used a meat thermometer to determine if it was done instead of cooking it for a certain amount of time.  I also let it rest for a decent amount of time which made it wonderfully moist.  Will definately make this again!

I hate to be one of the few people not to give this 5 stars but we just weren't crazy about the sweetness and soy sauce in the glaze.  The pork came out great and very tender.  Could use a variation of this recipe again.

probably the best pork roast I have ever cooked.  Mine usually come out so dry, but this was moist and very flavourfull... and I loved the sauce!  A perfect match for pork just as is... I might try with balsamic next time though.

Unbelievably good!!  Followed some other reviewers advice and doubled the rub and the glaze. I fixed it in a Nesco electric roaster and it turned out perfect.  I put it in a casserole dish, covered it tight and let it sit for 15 mins after baking and I think this made it extremely moist. New family fav. Thank you!

This was a hit!  My pork loin was only about 2 1/2 lbs but I made the full amount of sauce.  Unfortunately, the loin got done so quickly I didn't get a chance to baste it, just drizzled the sauce on before serving.  Looking forward to trying again!

This was amazing, the sauce and the rub makes the dish incredible. Added some drizzles of olive oil over the loin, then used the rub. I doubled the sauce (with balsamic vinegar) for plating and used flour instead of cornstarch.  The whole family loved the dish, and the rub (with added rosemarey) made the house smell unbelievable. I cooked it a little longer because the rest of the family is a little weary of pink pork but still it came out GREAT!! THANK YOU!

I used a 2lb pork roast but the same amount of ingredients for rub and glaze. Turned out wonderful, and left enough "sauce" for brown rice as well. Very good flavor, but I did add some balsamic vinegar as suggested by others. 

Will definitely make again :). Great recipe!

This is the BEST pork loin recipe I have tried and it is SO EASY to make!!  I recently made this for our family's Christmas celebration and let me tell you, it was a HUGE it!!  Everyone RAVED about it!!  I always double the glaze/sauce and add a bit more garlic to the rub (I personally love garlic).  I insert my meat thermometer until it reaches 170 degrees and one trick I have found that REALLY makes it SUPER MOIST is that I "tent" it with foil - LOOSELY - for about 20-30 minutes after taking out of the over and it just seals in all the juices and makes it SO TENDER!!  The glaze/sauce is SO flavorful - not too sweet but has just the right amount of flavor to complement the meat.  YUMMM!!!

Now I understand why this recipe has maintained its five star rating!  I doubled the rub seasoning (used minced garlic instead) and the sauce (used red wine vinegar as it was all I had on hand).  I was afraid the sauce would be overpowering considering how flavorful the rub was, but it really made the dish.  Served with southern greenbeans and cinnamon apples (always a nice alternative to apple sauce with pork dishes), although the apples weren't really necessary because the sauce was nice and sweet.
Thank you!

I gave this 4 stars only because I didn't have sage on hand and substituted a few other things.  I used fresh grated lemon pepper and savory in place of the sage.  We love this, it comes out great, and the whole house smells fantastic.

I made this recipe with high expectations but was a little disappointed. Maybe it was because I followed some other reviewers suggestions and made some substitutions. The only had a 2.5 lb. roast and I doubled the amount of rub and sauce. I used brown sugar instead of white and it was VERY sweet. I used flour instead of cornstarch and I used balsamic vinegar instead of regular. The garlic taste was overwhelming. I cooked it for 2 hrs. to 160 degrees with a foil tent for the first hour and it was tender and juicy. My husband didn't care for the rub or the sauce. He said he would rather have it plain. I will try it one more time only this time I will follow the recipe to the tee and hope for the best.

I used a pork tenderloin and roasted to 160 so cooking time was pretty quick. I used rice vinegar and just a little ginger.  This was delicious!  I loved the savory sage flavor combined with the slightly sweet sauce.  Really yummy and would be nice for company too.

This was excellent and out of the 5 people we had for dinner that night- every single one commented on how much they liked it. I doubled the salt, pepper, garlic and sage and used balsamic vinegar rather than white vinegar and it was excellent. I only needed about 2 total hours for a 5 lb. pork loin.

After reading all the raving reviews on this recipe, me and my family were anxious to try it out. I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted balsamic vinegar as suggested by many. Maybe that was the problem, I don't know. All I know is that neither I nor my kids, even my teenage son who eats EVERYTHNG, cared much for it at all. My  husband is the only one who finished his but even he said it wasn't all that great. Rather disappointing. I wanted to like it but just couldn't. Sorry:(

Excellent!!!  My husband and I had this for supper tonight.  This was the first time I used this recipe.  I modified slightly, using half white vinegar, half balsamic and I added a little rosemary.  I had a 2 lb roast and doubled the rub.  Next time I will triple the rub.  Great flavor, very moist.  I basted 4-5 times with the glaze during the last 45 minutes of cooking.  Overall cooking time was about 1.5 hours.  I removed to a platter and tented with foil for about 15 minutes prior to slicing and serving.  I will make it again!

This was WONDERFUL! I used a just over a 2# loin and the sauce recipe as listed.  It was very tender and juciy.  I did tent it with foil for the first 2 hours as someone mentioned and added a cup of water to the pan while roasting.  I did sprinkle with poultry seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder and rosemary.

Super easy!  Great flavor.  Sauce was a little sweet.  I doubled the rub and sauce for an almost 2 lb roast.  Next time I will triple the rub.

I liked the sauce for the pork, but my pork came out dry even though I covered it with foil.  I think it needs a marinade to keep it moist.  I will probably use the marinade for other meats.  Thank you.

This was outstanding.  I didn't have any sage so I made a paste out of olive oil, chopped garlic, fennel seed, Thyme and the salt and pepper.  It was wonderful but I'm definately going to prepare this again with the sage next time.

Oh my goodness, this recipe is amazing.  The glaze was just DELICIOUS; tangy and full of flavor!  I forgot to add the glaze during the last 30 minutes of cooking, so I only got to add it about 10 minutes before it came out of the oven, but it was still marvelous.  It will be even better when I do it the right way!

I made this for dinner this evening, because of the rave reviews on this site.  Sad to say that none of us liked it.  Did not care for the mix of savory and sweet - perhaps next time I'll try to make it using one set of seasonings or the other.  Will definitely try the glaze over grilled chicken come spring - tastes almost like jack daniel glaze from TGIFridays!

We made this for Boxing Day (day after Christmas) and it was really good!  I made this with just the seasonings on the pork (sage, pepper, garlic) and wrapped the pork with strips of bacon.  I did not do the glaze and I served the pork with warm applesauce.  It was moist & had lovely flavor from the sage.  Mine did take longer to cook but maybe that was because of no glaze.

Loved this recipe! I made this for a holiday party and got wonderful reviews. I am making it again for Christmas Eve by request. Even my 7 yo picky eater loved it.

I followed a couple of the other suggestions like covering it for the first couple of hours and making twice the rub but otherwise followed the recipe. It was amazing! It does cook a little faster than the recipe says. I had a 6 pound pork loin and it was done in 2.5 hours.

Before this, I have never made a delicious pork roast, but now I have broken the curse!  I used a 4 pound bone-in shoulder roast, from Costco and baked it for 2 1/2 hours and it was perfection!

I really like this recipe and plan to use it again. I actually began to make it before realising that I didn't have sage after all, so in fear and trepidation I took a gamble and substituted it! I dusted ground coriander very lightly over both sides of the pork, before rubbing in the salt, pepper, and garlic. By very lightly, I mean I probably used about 1/8 of a tsp or less. Its flavour came through very gently and worked well with both glaze and meat. I don't like a strong herb flavour and this just gave it a gentle hint that was quite pleasant, I will definitely do it again. I followed the suggestion of an earlier reviewer and substituted the 1 tbsp of cornflour for 2 tbsp of flour was pleased with the result. As a little extra, I sliced up a fresh red apple into thin segments, leaving the skin on, and roasted it in the oven beside the pork for the last 20 mins or so until nice and tender. I then served this with the meal and it gave a nice fresh, sweetish flavour which complimented everything else. Like other reviewers, I also found my meat cooked much faster than suggested. My 3.4lb roast took about 1 1/2 hours at 300degrees.

Very Juicy.  Very Easy to make. I used a 2.5 lb. roast so there was plenty of glaze for a sauce afterward.

This pork roast was the best.  I was a little skeptical about the 3 hour cooking time but every minute was necessary.  Also was not sure about cooking it without a cover but that too worked out well.  The outside crusted over a little keeping all the flavor in.  I definately would serve this as a  main entree for guests.

This was delicious!  We didn't have any sage so I used Savory and cooked the pork loin in beer.  Then, we brushed on the sauce to cook with it the last 30 minutes.  Turned out great!

This is great. My family loved it, even my picky 3yr old. Didn't have the sage and I added 1tsp of ginger. Absolutely great. Added a little cornstarch and water to pan drippings to make "gravy". Makes a great company dish when you really want to impress.

As with the other reviewers, I took the advice to sub brown sugar and balsamic vinegar. Doubled the rub, which was excellent, but my roast was a small one, and I had no cornstarch on hand, so I took someone else's advice and subbed 2 TBs flour, WITHOUT taking into consideration how I had scaled down the other ingredients--as you can imagine, it was waaaaay too thick, so instead of adding H20, I added chicken broth and just a tad bit more soy sauce, and it was amazing! I think next time I'll add some asian hot sauce as another reviewer suggested--just to spice it up a bit. Served with jasmine rice, and everyone devoured it--no leftovers. Next time, I'll buy a larger roast! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an awesome rub and glaze sauce. I followed the recipes as is. I am going to make again for sure and I will be trying this glaze on other pork cuts too!  My family (even my boys (6 and 4)) loved it too! Thanks for the great recipe!

delicious!  I took the advice from others and did cover for the first couple hours of cooking, removed tin foil and basted with sauce for about 45 minutes.  Great recipe!

Used a 3 lb roast and a meat thermometer to know when to baste. Moist and tender meat, but I might cover it next time for the first hour. Didn't have any sage, and used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar.  The flavors in the glaze mixed with the drippings from the pork were fabulous. I might thicken the leftover glaze with the drippings with some corn starch next time.  DH loved it.  It is beautiful - and would be fit for company. Will make again, definitely.

this is the second time I am preparing this wonderful roast.  I too, used balsamic vineagar.  When I first made it the vinegar smell was so strong I wasn't gonna use the glaze. I got the nerve to taste the glaze, and it was absolutely wonderful and mild. I steamed some sstir-fry veggies and mixed them with the glaze and brown rice. Just excellent!!

My husband and teenage daughter loved this! I browned it on the stove first, and added the Knorr pork gravy packet to the glaze (with 1/4 C more water) and it turned out amazing. Very easy too. I will make this often! My roast was about 2 3/4 pounds and it took about 1 1/2 hours.

I used a pork roast that was already seasoned from the store. It turned out GREAT!! I doubled the sauce recipe and used a little in some green beans to flavor them, they were awesome!I have 2 teenage kids and they still have not stopped talking about it! They are even telling kids at school how good it was. Thanks for this one, it is wonderful.

Delicious. And easy.  Take out the loin, use a salt/pepper/garlic rub,  sear it on all sides to get a flavorful crust, then throw it in the oven.  White waiting for your thermometer to beep, make double the glaze.

When I found this recipe I was amazed and i thought i would try it.  My husband who hates pork saw this and begged me to make it.  I tripled the spices( I had two roasts ) and when I got to the sauce I looked in my cabinet and realized I had no soy sauce.  so I added a teaspoon of sage, a teaspoon of pepper and a 1/4 teaspoon of rosemary to it.  It was sweet but amazing.  the next day i used the leftovers and made a bar-b-que pulled pork mixture that was amazing!!!!

My family and I thought this was Great!!!!! I made it just as written with the exception, That I Mixed all the spices together early in the morning, and Rubbed the roast in them And saran wrapped back in the fridge for 7 hours, to let the flavors soak in a little more, I also like other people doubled the spices and the glaze, I was nervous at first because, After I mixed the glaze I went back and started reading reviews, and everyone had used Brown sugar instead of white, But I thought it was awesome completly as Is with no changes, The next time I make it I might try brown sugar, But now I am scared that might taste different.

I would definitely make this again.  I used a smaller piece of pork and doubled the herbs and tripled the sauce.  I was happy with the glaze I could add to my dish as I was serving it.  It was delicious.

I did what one reviewer suggested and cut a few slits on top of the pork and inserted small slices of garlic.  This was absolutely superb.  With extra sauce, it would be fantastic over white rice and steamed vegetables.

We really enjoyed this. I actually covered the roast for the majority of the cooking time then broiled on high after applying the glaze for aprox 8 min. There wasn't much of a fat-cap on the roast so it didn't produce a nice crispy "skin" like we would have liked. BUT, the roast was so moist and tender. We are considering this recipe for a holiday meal and that's a big deal in my house:)

This is better even than doing the roast on a rotisserie.  It is moist flavorful and the glaze is great.  Next time I will make a little extra glaze for dipping.  The cook time was a little long so you have to watch your meat thermometer other than that...fantastico!

This is the first time I have bothered to write a review in over three years. My husband is a not a pork lover and made me cut his portion by two-thirds. He actually went back for seconds and told me to keep this recipe! My kids loved it too. I used a rib roast and cut out the ribs afterwards for another tasty treat. The sauce makes delicious teriyaki ribs as well.

I didn't think I would like the sauce in this recipe, but it is delicious!  Next time I will make more sauce as others have suggested.  It really adds something to a plain pork roast.

I am sure that I did not get the texture right as I cooked in the crockpot with 1/2 cup water and then poured the glaze and froze. Just reheated in the  oven. 

delicious. the glaze was a great compliment to the spices.

I can't really personally rate this because I am a vegetarian but I did make this for my family and they loved it. My mother said it was the best pork roast she has ever had! I had a three pound roast and baked it for about an hour and a half till the temperature reached 155 degrees. Also ad recommended I doubled the rub and tripled the glaze. Everyone enjoyed it!

Couldn't find my sage, so I used poultry seasoning, added a cup of water and covered half way through cooking because it looked dry. Used balsamic vinegar, didn't add cornstarch because I wanted to keep juices more like au jus. Wonderful flavor, entire family raved!  Definitely adding this to our usual rotation.

A new household favorite!  This was wonderful. I actually used a 5lb Pork Shoulder Roast.  Rather than the sage rub, I used NapaStyle's Fennel Spice Rub.  All other ingredients were used without modifiction.  This had a wonderful flavor, and the meat was extremely tender for this cut.  Great results with little effort...my kind of meal!  Even the leftovers, thinly sliced in a sandwich, were a big hit!  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was fantastic.  Even my 2 year old gobbled it up, which is rare!  I used balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, and two 1 pound pork loins. Cooked at 325 for 1 hour.  Doubled the spices (except the salt) and doubled the sauce.  VERY GOOD!

Excellent.  I doubled the sauce......it tasted great with the baked potatoes we had with it.  Also, the cooking time was a little long.  We ate it at about 2 hrs. rather than 3 and I think 3 would have turned it into sawdust.  Great recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

I've made this several times and it always turns out beautifully.  Every time I seem to forget to baste the loin before finishing the cooking time, but it still turns out delicious every time.

The sauce is excellent.  I can't seem to get the pork right though.  I  overcook it every time I make it.  The rub adds a good flavor and when it mixes with the sauce it is a really good dish.

Very good sauce/glaze.  I used raspberry balsamic vinegar, which added a nice sweetness.  The pork was quite good, but not that memorable.

This had wonderful flavor.  Next time I would rub on less salt because the tenderloin I used was already injected with broth/salt.  Made 1 1/2 times amount of sauce.

Amazing!! I used boneless pork leg, more tender after 3.5 hrs of cooking. Made double the sauce and add the drippings from the pork roast to it and drizzled the whole thing on the roast. gave it another 5 mins in the oven. Perfect....

I can't begin to tell you how easy and delicious this recipe is.  The glaze is to die for!  I used 1/2 balsamic vinegar and 1/2 red wine vinegar, which gave a terrific flavor.  And the sage, though subtle, really makes the recipe.  I made a 2lb roast and doubled the glaze (as suggested by many others).  However, I found that it was way too much glaze with such a small roast, even after using extra for dipping.  That's just fine with me, though.  I put it in the fridge and will be trying it on pork chops later this week.  I HIGHLY recommend trying this one!

This was my first time making a roast and I really loved it. My boyfriend really isnt a fan of roasts but he really liked it even had to take leftovers to work. I made the same changes as everyone else added some ginger to the glaze, some extra garlic, and double the seasonings and glaze. It was perfect. Next time I might quadruple the glaze so there is extra for dipping. Thanks so much for the recipe will be sharing with family and definatly will make many more times.

Delicious and easy!  I did substitute brown sugar and used balsamic vineagar as per other reviewers.  I also doubled the sauce and I did not think that was necessary.  I will make only the recipe amount next time.

My husband and sister both say they don't really like pork, but they both LOVED this recipe! I too used a little balsamic vinegar and it was delicious! I also seared the roast before baking. This was a great recipe and I will definitely make again and again!

Made this last night and it tasted great, also smelled great.  Used balsamic vinegar and doubled the sauce. Hubby likes lots of gravy.  Maybe I'll cut down just a touch on the sugar next time.  Was a big hit around here.

Loved this!  Nice combination of salt and sweet.  My teenage daughter who rarely eats pork, had 2 servings.  My 4 year old even raved about it, he loved the sauce.  Definitely a keeper.

Amazing!!  I had a 3.5 lb roast and used the same recipe and I thought it was perfect!  I loved the sage and garlic rub with the sauce -- the entire thing was perfect and super tender and I didn't even use a pork loin -- I had another type of pork roast in the freezer!  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and it did come out tender, but I felt it needed some other flavor/undertone... I just can't put my finger on what I would add if I made it again - maybe citrus?  Overall, though, it was good.

Wonderful!  This is the best pork loin roast I have ever made.  Family including small kids had seconds and thirds.  The sauce is very sweet which for me is a good thing.  We really enjoyed this recipe!

We like this and will make again. I think the name is misleading - was more sweet and tangy than I expected but very good. My husband does not like sweet sauces, I was thinking it would be more savory, but he did like it and so did the kids. Victory!

My family loved this recipe.  I haven't been successful in finding a good recipe for pork, but this one was a winner.  Almost a sweet and sour taste with a hint of garlic and sage it comes together nicely juicy with a delicious glaze.  My husband said "don't lose that recipe".

Fantastic! I used a smaller Pork Tenderloin, so I had to reduce the cooking time, but it turned our great!
Tried second time in the crock pot. Just as good!

Fantastic.  I combined the glaze with pan juices and served 'pulled' on Italian rolls.  My family demanded that I save and cook this again and again.

EXCELLENT! 8 STARS! I followed the recipe to a T, except that I cooked it on the routiserie (spelling?) I am experimenting with certain recipes to get my holiday menu's in line. My father loves for me to cook for him when he and my Mother visit for the holidays and this will be one on my list! Thanks!

I have to say that this was excellent! The last time I made a pork loin no one enjoyed it. This was very flavorful and the juice was perfect for dipping. I also used a timer/thermometer and my roast only took 2 hours and 15 minutes to hit 160. If I had left it in the full 3 hours it might have been too dry. I also sliced and poured the juice across the roast about a half an hour before serving. I would definitely consider serving this at a dinner party. My boys ate it up too..so kid friendly to boot!

This was absolutely delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I followed others reviews and added a little ginger in the glaze.  I used a 2 lb. pork and my boyfriend and I ate the whole thing.  We felt quite sick after from eating WAY too much, but it was so good we couldn't stop.  I brushed the glaze on the cooking pork during the last 1/2 hour, but ended up throwing the rest of the glaze away.  There was plenty of flavor on the pork without the extra glaze.  Will definitely be making this recipe again!!!

This was AWESOME!!!  My husband loved it and he is VERY picky.  It was simple and delicious - I followed the recipe exactly and would do so again.  I cooked to 170 degrees and it was still very moist and tender.

I was a bit skeptical as I started to bast the Pork Loin I used for this meal, but the results were fabulous. Made it for a dinner party of 6 and everyone raved about it. The Pork was extremely tender and sooo moist!! I used Balsamic vinegar as this was the theme of my meal and it turned out fabulous!! Will certainly make again. Thanks

Tasty and realatively easy.  Be careful not to dry out the meat.  Watch the internal temp carefully (it may be done sooner than the allowed time).  I allowed the temp to reach 170 degrees which was too much for my taste.  Next time I will go to 155.  Good luck.  I impressed all of our dinner guests!

I was pleasantly surprised by this meal.  I had never cooked a pork roast before and was looking for something good but not too "adventurous."  Well I found it in this recipe.  The meat was tender and the sauce reminded me of a sweet and sour sauce recipe I have.  Yum!

I'm new to cooking, and this is the first time that I've made a pork loin. It came out good. I used red wine vinegar because I wan't sure. But the sauce is really great. Thanks. I love this web site!

Perfect!  Hubby loved how moist this roast turned out and we both loved the sauce.  Will use that sauce for a variety of dishes!  Only one of our three picky eaters turned up their noses and we think he's a vegetarian, so don't take that negatively!

Rave reviews by all!  And fairly easy, too.  Used rosemary instead of sage and used extra garlic.

Average.  Taste of the garnishments around it was excellent tho.  I think my roast was just a tough one, but the sause, etc WAS good.

It was something different.  A little too sweet for my tastes, but not bad.

An extremely easy dish that amply rewards the little effort it takes to make. I served it with steamed rice and vegetables, and all were satisfied.
