I just saute in olive oil in a big skillet and skip the blanching part to save washing a pan. First I thinly slice the stems and add them first to get a bit of a head start on the leaves then slice the leaves in thin strips (the bunch at a time). When wilted it is ready.

I had never had beet greens before and I thought this was a very good, easy dish to prepare. I did not use the red pepper flakes as I have an 8 year old who does not like anything spicy, but it would probably be a good addition.  I plan to make this again and I think I will try adding some crumbled bacon to it next time for a little twist.  Thanks for the recipe!

Outstanding. I had never thought of putting the greens in cold water after boiling. That really kept them fresh. I used more olive oil. Forgetting to season the green while cooking I put kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper on the greens as I served them. My dinner guests loved them.

This was delicious - we were scraping our plates.  I added more red pepper and added the juice of 1 (small) lemon as the greens were sauteing.  Added a little crumbled feta to the top.  So good, I'm going to have to go out and get more greens.  I think this would be equally delicious with any kind of green - chard, kale, etc.

I omitted the crushed red pepper but added two slices of sliced and chopped sweet onion in with the garlic and olive oil before adding the beet greens. Very good and this will be a staple in my recipes to cook. LOVED and ususally I do not like beet greens. Five stars.

This recipe is a great place to start. I put the greens in unsalted boiling water for 60 seconds. I had a big bowl with olive oil, fresh pressed garlic, and salt ready. With a slotted spoon I transferred the greens directly to this big bowl and stirred it around. If you cook it for 1 minute you can skip the rinse and cool step. I cook spinach the same way and now I know beet greens do well with this method. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this and I loved them as well. If you boil fresh greens for longer than 1 minute their nutrients will start to leach out into the water; you don't want your greens to shrivel up, they should still be leaf looking and not in a mound.

Super good.  Super easy.  I sauteed some shallots and added some beets (I love cooked beets), along with some shrimp.  What a great, easy meal.

Good.  I prefer greens to be baked up crispy with olive oil and salt or seasoned salt and eaten like a chip.  My husband was a fan of this recipe.

Delicious is the word to describe these greens. I followed everything except I used some of the lemon juice in the greens. I think fresh lemons and garlic make a big difference. I love these! I'd eat the whole pot, but I need to share.

I used the stems as well, because why waste!  I sauteed the garlic in the oil with the red pepper flakes, then added the stems (chopped in advance to 1/2" long pieces) and sauteed them for 2-3 minutes.  I didn't boil the greens ahead of time, but just cut them into ribbons and added them with the stems and sauteed for another 3 minutes/til wilted/soft.  At the end, I stirred in some salt, pepper, and the juice from 1/4 of a lemon.  Delishe!

Delicious!!!  I used ground cayenne pepper and 4 cloves of garlic (the more the better) and it was a huge hit at the dinner table!  We will definitely use this recipe again.  We'll try this method with other greens as well.  It's a keeper.  THANK YOU!

Instead of blanching, I stir-fried with garlic and shallot. Finished with a dash of chicken broth and balsamic vinegar. Yum!

I made this tonight (just sautéed the ingredients instead of blanching and also included the stems chopped small) and my 13 year old ate the entire pan before it even made it to the table. He doesn't like beets but he said the greens smelled so good he couldn't help himself. I guess this will be a keeper ;)

Good stuff.
I've been able to get beet greens cheap or free at farmer's markets. Ask! The guy told me they were just going to give them to a pig farmer. If your greens look sad, crisp them up in cold water for a little bit. Then refrigerate. You'll be surprised how they perk up!

This was the best! Blanching them first makes themsweeter. Carmelizing the garlic and onions also adds to the sweetness. The capers adds a nice balence to the sweet. I didnt have capers so I used green olives which worked well.

Loved this. I had bags and bags of beet greens from the garden.  I made one batch and ate the whole thing myself. I skipped the blanching and added half a vidalia onion, served it with a small side of mashed potatoes. Delish.

First time having beet greens and definitely a winner.  Followed the recipe except for a few changes.  I did not use red pepper flakes.  Cut the stems into small dice and sauteed with minced garlic and spring onions in olive oil until tender.  The lemon juice is a must!

sauteed stems in pan with garlic + oil for ~5 min, added chopped up greens, salt + pepper, then squeezed lemon over it as well while cooking and put a lid on so it steams in lemon flavor --- awesome flavor afterwards

Yummy.  I added some chopped onion, squeezed the lemon juice in while it was  sautéing, and topped it with some feta cheese as another reviewer suggested and it came out great.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe for healthy eating.  I sautéed some onion along with the diced stems in olive oil for a few minutes, then added the garlic.  I tossed in some real bacon bits I had in the refrigerator, then added the chopped beet greens along with the red pepper flakes.  After about a minute, I added some apple cider vinegar rather than the lemon.  Just like the extra kick it gives.  Great recipe!

I got a bunch of beet greens in my CSA box and was anxious to try them out so I decided on this recipe because it sounded so easy.  I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of preparation and the incredible flavor this dish had!  I left out the red pepper flakes on accident and it was still great.  I used some green garlic that also came in the CSA box but followed the directions exactly.  They almost tasted like sauteed spinach without leaving the "spinach film" on my teeth which is AWESOME!  This might even been good with some shredded parmesan, but why mess with what's a tasty, easy, and healthy dish.  Thanks for this recipe!

I skipped the blanching part, chopped up the stems very small and added sliced fresh mushrooms and some fresh onion plus a dash of garlic powder and black pepper, Sauteed the mushrooms, beet leaf stems and onion for about 10 minutes, then added the chopped leaves. Cooked under a cover for another 10 minutes, added a dash of white vinegar and served over a little brown rice. Delicious and filling .

Loved this recipe.  The lemon makes it!  After the garlic was done I added 1/4 cup of water and the stems cut to about 1 inch.  I popped the lid on the pot and let them cook until tender.  Then I added the rough cut beet greens and another 1/4 cup of water and covered the pot again.  When the greens were wilted and the water had cooked off I removed from the pot from heat and squeezed on the juice from 1/2 of a lemon and stirred in into the greens. I served the greens with additional wedges of lemon.  (Just because I had them in the frig. I tossed in some carmelized onions and sauteed mushrooms with the beet greens.)  That addition was compatible and we thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I'm thinking I'll try this recipe again using kale.

I bought some beets at the local farmers' market.  The leaves were so green and fresh (unlike what I buy at the grocery), I didn't want to waste them.  I am so glad I found this recipe.  I doubled the garlic (we love garlic) and added a small chopped onion.  I also chopped some of the beet stems and sauteed them with the onion and garlic.  Thank you for a great way to use the beet greens!

I have never eaten beet greens in my life (even living in the south) but I had grown some in my garden and picked them today.  I, too, like another reviewer added onion -- two green onions to be exact.  These are delicious!!!!  Thanks so much for the lesson in cooking them.

This is a simple and delicious recipe.  No need to blanch the greens prior to sauteing them, they cooked up perfectly straight into the pan.  I added a touch more garlic than called for, and then squeezed the juice of half a lemon over the cooked down greens just before serving.  It was all devoured and my son was dipping bread in the remaining pan juices while I cleaned up the kitchen.

Delicious!  I tossed kidney beans in at the end and sprinkled salted roasted pumpkin seeds on top.  I ate this with a thawed frozen corn side for a delicious breakfast.

Love beet greens, and this is how i usually cook them, I would just add trying replacing lemon juice with cider or rice wine vinegar for a great variation.

Fantastic.  I never cooked beet greens until tonight, but I had read that they were very nutritious, so when I scored a huge bunch of beets in my CSA allotment this week, I wanted to try cooking the greens.  Your recipe is truly "simple & delicious".  I especially liked that I could blanch them while the chicken was roasting and then saute them last minute as I was letting the meat rest.  Thanks for sharing!

Good just as it's written! I didn't change a thing and my picky husband loved it.  Definitely going on my "repeat" lists.  And even better because you can do the bulk of preparation beforehand.  (We ate it too fast to get a photo!)

I really liked the lemon before serving. Took the bitterness out of the beet greens. Served with Artichoke Spinach Lasagna and Roasted Romanesco, Broccoli, and Cailiflower.

I just tried this recipe.  It was easy and the result was very tasty.  I bought the beets at our farmers' market so the greens were fresh and pretty.  The next time I use this recipe I will use apple cider vinegar in the place of lemon.  I find beets to be a bit pricey so I am glad to have a recipe for the greens.  Actually, I would buy beet greens without the beet if they were available, I liked the results of this recipe so much.  It tastes a bit like Swiss chard.

This was delicious and super easy.  I used a combo of beets, swiss chard and some weird green from the farmer's market.  Didn't use the lemon and it was still great.  Thanks!

I really liked this recipe. I combined some other suggestions and sautéed onion, mushrooms, shrimp and garlic before adding the blanched beet greens. I also topped with parmesan cheese. Very tasty. Next time I'll serve it on pasta to make a heartier meal.

Pretty much exactly what the review says: simple and delicious. I used minced garlic as I didn't have any cloves on hand. Even my 7 year old daughter eagerly ate them (and they smelled marvelous, too). Will make again!

I buy red and golden beets quite often, but I'd never kept the tops until I read this recipe. 
I didn't blanch, but I did clean them well, just like I would any other greens. I sautéed them with chopped garlic, diced onion,  and a touch of garlic oil. It was magnificent....! I'll never throw the beet greens away again...!

I made this for my lunch today and it was wonderful.  I made it just as the recipe is listed.  You can adjust the taste with some salt and the lemon.  I am making it again soon because I have more beet greens.  Delicious!

Delicious! My wife and I made it and enjoyed it so much that we used the same olive oil and garlic to make the flounder, which I caught, and paired with it and added more lemons from our Meyers lemon tree.  Thanks for sharing!

Stuck to the recipe but decided to use a vinegar flavored with hot peppers instead of pepper flakes. Greens are more tender and milder that other greens. I would make this again.

Tasted great! No need to boil the greens though. I just added the raw greens to the pan after sautéing the garlic and red pepper flakes, stir fried a few minutes until the greens started to wilt, then covered and cooked on low a couple more minutes.

The recipe turns out fine, but I think that all that blanching and washing the leaves will rob them of much of their soluble vitamins.  I prefer to chop them, including the tender stems, and saute in olive oil then adding the garlic and pepper flakes and perhaps a splash of vegetable broth.

I skipped the boiling part.  These were quite the pleasant surprise.  I was expecting them to be bitter.  These were so good that they will be getting fixed regularly in our household.

The beet greens are surprisingly tasty. I would recommend adding sautéed heart of palm. It made a massive difference for me.

I didn't boil them first, just sauteed them in bacon grease. I wasn't excited about it.

I blanched the greens using chicken broth. I then added some of the broth to the oil and garlic sauté to keep it a little moister. Delicious!

Was nervous as I bought beets with the greens attached. I cut greens off the beets & rinsed them then chopped the stems.  Sauteed the stems with garlic then added the leaves (didn’t boil first) & red pepper flakes & cooked til the leaves wilted. Super yummy  but, like spinach, these greens give your teeth a dry funny feeling. So be sure to add lemon juice (which I forgot). Will make again.

Delicious greens from our garden!  I sautéed some chopped red onions, chopped small  red peppers  & chard leaves from our garden with  the garlic and then added the greens after cooking them per the instructions.  Had a little left over that I scrambled  into my eggs the next morning.

I've made this several times and enjoy the basic recipe.  I do not skip the blanching.  Typically skip the lemon and serve for breakfast with a bit of crumbled feta and eggs over medium. Thank you for sharing this. 
I harvested beets from my garden I had an abundance of greens so my picture is of a variation of the recipe.  Sauteed garlic, red pepper flakes, onion, bit of leftover bell pepper and mushrooms. Added chopped (blanched) greens and what was left in a bag of spinach.  So yummy!

All these years I threw the greens in the compost.   I followed this recipe exactly and they were delishous.  I did add some sliced almonds for protein because i eat a plant based diet.  Whoever made this recipe is a genius.

This is a great recipe!! Tastes delicious and is so healthful. I omitted the crushed red pepper, and added the lemon juice as the greens were mixing with the garlic and oil.  Hubby loved it too.

I made beet greens once before and did not like them. This recipe called for boiling the beet greens before sautéing them and I like them very much. We were able to use the beet greens my husband trimmed from our beets in the garden.

You need to use the greens shortly after purchasing them.  They wilt quickly.  This was good and I'm glad I tried it.

I'm not really into too many greens but, being the first time I've ever had beet greens, this is very good. It will keep me coming back. I really like beets so am happy to not waste the greens now.

First time making beet greens and I wasn’t sure what to expect, especially having grown up eating (choking down) canned spinach. This recipe is delicious- I loved the spice the red pepper flakes and garlic gave. I didn’t have any lemon, but I didn’t think it was missing anything!

Good!  I had some left-over home-grown fried potatoes that I had made yesterday with sliced onions.
Mixed them all together in the olive oil, yum lunch!

This review is going to sound a bit whinny, but this was a lot of work.  I used one cutting board, knife, boiling pot, colander, bowl for ice to cool down, skillet and large spoon.  I just couldn't believe how many dishes for one side dish.  It was just too much work for me.  I did enjoy the tiny bit of greens it made, but I will not make this again.  Oh! well more for others.  I will just stick to the beets.

Satisfying and good for you!  I also chopped the stems, and sautéed them first with a little garlic before adding the greens.  I would add some crumbled bacon for a little flavoring.

I wanted to use everything in my fledgling garden so I tried this. Easy, quick, delicious!!  Will make it again tomorrow when I harvest more greens.   I plan to incorporate some of the suggestions from the other reviews.

I just cleaned the beet/kale leaves, cut off hard stems and tore into bite size pieces. I used olive oil and sauteed them slowly, skipping the blanching part. I added in diced onion and bacon crumbles. I will omit the red pepper flakes when I make them again today and use Mrs Dash Spicy instead. I added lots of pepper and some salt. It was a very yummy recipe, my 15 year old couldn't keep his hands out of it!

First time to fix beet greens and have to say I hit it lucky with such a great recipe.  Put a good taste in my mouth....literally!  Halved the recipe, but otherwise made it to recipe as written.  Thanks, Daryl Gerboth, for such an easy, but tasty (and healthy!!!) recipe.

I loved it! Texture in a dish is very important to me. So I cooked this as directed except I added about 1/2 cup of sliced red onion to the pan with the garlic. I also put a bit of lemon zest, and finished the greens with a  squeeze of lemon juice into the pan instead of on the plate.  Will definitely make this again.

Boiling for a short time releases some of the acidic quality in the greens, do not cover.  I loved this as written, but would leave out the red pepper flakes for those that don't like it spicy.

I just sauté the greens. I did not blanch them. I used limes instead of lemons. This was a tasty way to use the greens from my garden.

Skipped blanching but sautéed the stems before adding garlic and then after a minute, the greens. Also added a splash of balsamic vinegar or lemon juice.

Steam like you would spinach. A bit of salt pepper to taste better added at the table. Butter if you like.
Don't over cook, five minutes or less. Remember "Rush makes Mush"
Better than kale or spinach. I grow Beets just for the greens.
You won't be sorry!!.  You can thank me later.
. FYI, slice and pickle the red stuff.

I had some fresh beets in the garden, so tried the greens today as written on this recipe. I don't like cooked spinach and that is what this reminded me of and I tried this dish, but I just could not eat it and had to dump my serving in the garbage.  My husband ate his portion and said a two star rating is all he would give for this recipe.

These were good! Mine came out a little oily I guess because the blanched greens absorbed a lot of it. So next time I will lower the amount of oil.

I grew up in southeastern KY and although these aren't just like the ones my Mamaw made, they might be better! I love the spice and texture of these.  They have a nice bite, are cooked perfectly vs overcooked, which I feel is the fate of greens too often.  Thanks for sharing!

I used cayenne instead of red pepper flakes because I had no flakes in the house. Also I used a big thumb-size shallot with the garlic, all finely chopped. I happened to have tops from 6 large beets, used them all.
So tasty that I ate the whole thing for supper!
This recipe is so easy to make. I'll keep it in my bag of tricks, though my husband won't go near it. Oh well.

I've never like cooked beet greens but ate them for nutrition, so I wasn't expecting this to be so delicious! I did add about one teaspoon of maple syrup (because I added too much lemon juice) but it was so good I will eat them like this again soon.
