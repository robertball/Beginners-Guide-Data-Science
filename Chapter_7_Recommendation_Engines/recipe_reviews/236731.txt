This recipe is super versatile and easy to make. I have made it in the crock pot on days I had to work and couldn't babysit the stove. Just cook it with the lid off for the last hour to thicken up the stew a little.

This was great! I threw everything in the crockpot and used all the veggies suggested. Turned out to be a really great stew and then we added a cup or two of rice, which turned out good too. I'm not into spicy, so will have to play with the seasonings a little bit in the future. But great recipe. Will make again.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I did make changes, used bone in porkchops with some fat, I fried them alone, took them out then in pork juices cooked onion garlic and the spices, then added the porkchops back in with all the other ingredients.   I did not add all the vegetables, added two 4oz cans green chili.  Once meat was done I took out each porkchop, shredded it up and put back in pot.  I think i will add a couple of potatoes next time and I did use knorr beef cubes for the broth.  everyone loved it and now it is requested all the time.

This was great. I thicken it with corn tortillas, but it wasn't entirely necessary. I doubled the spices, but I am not sure it was necessary. You have to try this!

We made it as per the recipe.  We enjoyed it ; loved the texture and a bit of crunch left in the late addition veggies (carrots, corn & edamame).
We had it with rice and plan to try some of the leftovers, drained and thickened in a saucepan, wrapped in tortillas.  We expect the leftovers to be even better as the flavors meld together..
The dish  is well rounded and a nice blend of healthy veggies and a lean meat protein.  It  was easy to put together and most everything we keep on hand.

Excellent.  I added more broth, half a can of tomato paste, doubled the spices, added some hot pepper flakes and worchestershire and cooked it in the crock pot.  Don't forget to bloom your spices in a little oil to get the maximum flavor.   It was more like a soup and my husband loved it.  I will definitely keep this in my files since my husband is a soup lover and it made 6 nice large leftover servings for the freezer.

I made this Super Bowl Sunday, and it is great! Turns out my kids all went to parties and it’s just me and the wife. I did do some exchanges. Like where does one get frozen edamame shelled? Only found in pods and I’ll be dog gone if I’m shelling soybeans frozen. So I used Lima beans and turned out great. Also I overloaded the chilies a little. I love spicy but it was too much for the wife.

This is a great recipe!  I had to change it a bit to use up some canned goods and also because I didn't quite have all the ingredients.  So instead of corn, carrots, and edamame, I used hominy along with diced onion and red pepper.  Also poured in drained canellini beans at the end instead of kidney beans.  We like spice so I upped the chili powder and added a small pour of chipotle hot sauce.  To make it less soupy, I cut back on the broth.  I cheated and used the instantpot to pressure cook the seared pork quickly and then added that to my other ingredients on the stove.  Husband loved it a lot!

I used black and kidney beans. Edamame and sweet potatoes in place of corn and carrots. Extra green chili’s and it was delicious. Will make again.

I made a few modifications with this one. I made it on the stovetop and because I had less pork lessened the rest of the ingredients a bit too. It still turned out amazing. Will definitely make it again.

It was delicious and very tasty! Even my hard to please husband like it. The only changes I made because I didn't have the ingredients were not using the frozen shelled edamame, and using fresh sliced carrots instead of frozen. I also used can corn  (didn't have frozen), and I used one can of kidney beans and one of pinto beans.  Next time, I would love to make this recipe  just the way it is written.

Made as directed, slightly time consuming to babysit my he stove, but I might try it again in the crockpot. It was delicious, everyone loved it, even the kids. I adjusted the serving size to 6, and still have enough in leftovers to drain the liquid and use as full in a tortilla. Definite make again.

BIG hit at our recent fire pit party on a cold fall evening in MT!
Changes:  skipped edamae as husband dislikes 'rabbit food'. Doubled recipe and added cooked chicken I had defrosted, I liked the two meats.  Used light and dark kidney beans, and pintos too.  Used whole kernel corn.  Will make again, and again....

I was surprised at how delicious this was.  Luckily, it made a lot, so I was able to freeze some for later.  It froze really well and made fantastic leftovers.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using pork shoulder roast instead of tenderloin.  Next time I'll leave out the carrots because I felt that they were a little out of place.  Otherwise, it's perfect.

Great! I made this with what I had on hand; pork stew meat, no edamame, canned corn (thoroughly drained), no carrots, less onion (we always do that for our tastes), green pepper, and red beans. I also didn't use the beef broth, as it was plenty juicy. We ate it with rice and IT WAS TERRIFIC. I love a good meal that may take a while to cook, but is actually pretty simple, nutritious, and SO tasty! I wonder if this would also bake well in the oven (I did use my cast iron dutch oven)?

The quantity of pork listed within the recipe is a bit confusing.  I set the servings to 4 and used 1.5lbs of pork tenderloin.  Only change was that I added 8oz sliced mushrooms per another reviewer because that sounded super tasty and it was.  I suppose another change would be that I used green bell peppers in place of red because that was what was available.

I followed the recipe with exception of not having the beans in the recipe.  Used white kidney beans and black beans.  It was a good soup to use for left over pork tenderloin.  Had good flavor, especially second day, and my family liked it but not enough that would go out of my way to make it again ..... unless I had leftovers.

I made it with about 1-1.5 pounds of leftover pulled pork but kept the rest of the ingredients (and amounts) the same. The flavors are delicious, and my family loved it. I liked it with crusty bread to soak up the broth. Other family members enjoyed it in tortillas.

I added sweet potato, cubed 3/4 " size with the corn but forgot to put in the edamame beans, have a huge frozen package and meant to use some. I reconstituted and simmered cannelloni, red kidney and navy beans which I added, didn't have chilies abandon used instead my home grown hot pepper and jalapeño dried and ground mix. A good recipe.
