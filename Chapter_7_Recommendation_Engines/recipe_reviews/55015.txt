YUM! This is REALLY good. I only breaded and fried the eggplant and used leftover baked chicken instead of what the recipe called for and it tasted fabulous! However, make sure you thoroughly drain your eggplant on papertowels... I thought I did but had a pool of grease at the bottom of the casserole dish.

This recipe turned out fabulous. We pretty much followed the recipe as is except that made our own alfredo sauce and reduced the baking time by about 15 mins.  We loved this recipe!!!

It was very good and my husband liked it a lot.  I made my own Alfredo sauce using evaporated milk instead of cream. I also panfried the eggplant and chicken   hoping it will be less greasy than when deep fried and drained them well but it was still very greasy after baking. I have to skim the grease before serving. However, my husband  wants me to make it again. I have to admit it was really good.

This recipe is flavourable but a lot of work and greasy, that's why 4 stars. I goofed and cooked chicken breasts as is. Just one tweak - the Alfredo Sauce.  I made a roux then added a bottle of Alfredo Sauce, milk to thin, crushed garlic, pesto, cooking white wine, mustard, fresh chopped mushrooms red pepper and green onion.  Salt and pepper. Simmered sauce for 15 mins or so.  As others suggested I soaked up the grease from eggplant & chicken.  I used a lot of papertowel!!  When I served this hot from the oven, the egg plant seemed to disintegrate.  Perhaps from the weight of entire chicken breasts and eggplant cut too thin? Next time I won't deep-fry. Perhaps simmer strips of chicken breast in sauce to pre-cook, layer eggplant as is.

My Husband loves this.  I had to tell the kids the eggplant were green noodles but they ate it.  This one is a keeper.

I find jar Alfredo to be rather bland so I added garlic powder, nutmeg, and dried basil after pouring in the sauce. I was too lazy after working w/ that eggplant so I just fried the chicken strips in the same pan and the leftover bits of bread crumbs browned into the chicken nicely. Kind of a heavy meal, but sneaks a vegetable in nicely for the kids. Thanks :-)!

This was awesome!! I probably added way more cheese than was necessary, but we love cheese. I was a littel nervous with eggplant as I've never made it before and my hubby doesn't really like it. but he even thought it was delicious!!

The texture came out really soggy.  This was deterring from the overall dish.

I try a lot of different recipes, but itâ€™s not that often that I come across a recipe I absolutely love.  This is one of those recipes.  I cut the chicken breasts into medallions, brined them for an hour, soaked them then in buttermilk for approximately fifteen minutes, before coating them in the flour mixture.   This is a keeper.

I halved the amount of chicken, eggplant and sauce. It still made a large casserole full and was wonderful. Also, I made a corn casserole of the leftover bread crumbs from dipping, egg & milk mixture, and the cup of crumbs left in the Italian bread crumb package as well as a tablespoon of sugar and a drained can of corn--- some salt & pepper, into a small casserole dish, and popped it into the oven with the alfredo casserole. No sense wasting 4 eggs and all that milk. I didn't bother with the changing oven temps. Cooked both casseroles for 40 minutes on 350 degrees. Delicious!

it was pretty good - next time just going to make the chicken tenders and eat those as an appetizer. My husband ate it, but he eats anything.

I probably wouldn't make this one again.  To many steps for average results.  I even made my own Alfredo sauce, but this just wasn't a recipe that we could enjoy.  I love eggplant parmesan, but this...not so much.

Tasty, but certainly not healthy.  My husband didn't like how cheesy it was - and I reduced how much was called for!  Prep was an hour because I made my own alfredo sauce.  Baking time was right-on.  Even with halving the recipe, I have leftovers in the freezer now; then that's it for this one.

Crazy good! Even friends who don't like eggplant loved it! Only change I made was salting the eggplant after slicing it. (Breaks down the chewiness) and I dipped the eggplant and chicken in flour before the egg and breadcrumbs. So delicious, making it again already!

Honestly, with all the screw-ups I did, I still got rave reviews with this dish! I didn't have mozzarella (almost NEVER happens!) so I put slices of provolone in the first layer...didn't have enough eggplant, so I made the 2nd layer slices of onion....I made my own Alfredo sauce and made it too thick so it just laid on top instead of trickling down. Other reviewers tipped me off about the grease, so I used paper towels right away to sop up what bubbled up.  It was GREAT!
