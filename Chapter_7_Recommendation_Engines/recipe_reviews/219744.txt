Instead of turbanado sugar, I used honey in it's place. I also used old fashioned oats only because that was what I had on hand. I shared this with my oldest son--we both thought this was very good. My banana was quite ripe so the honey might not even be necessary next time I make this.

Chocolate for breakfast - what could be better? This not only tastes delicious, but happens to be good for you too! Since I didn't have any almonds on hand I subbed walnuts and vanilla extract which proved to be a nice flavor combination.  I cut back on the sugar a bit (personal preference).  I topped this with a little sliced banana, toasted walnuts, and coconut.  Thanks for a great recipe *~Lissa~*!

I would make a few changes to this recipe as I found it quite rich and sweet. The almond flavoring also put it a bit over the top. I'd replace that with vanilla extract and reduce the sugar (how much you use depends on the ripeness of your banana) and cocoa. I would also use toasted almonds. This could possibly be a good way to get oatmeal into my kids, so I'll try it out on them. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved the combination of flavors.  I used steel cut oats so I had to modify the cooking times slightly but it came out great.  Hubby stirred in some peanut butter in his bowl.

I enjoyed this. I've been trying to eat breakfast more often and I'm a fan of the hot cereal. Was looking for a new idea when I came across this one. Mmm chocolate and bananas in oatmeal? Fantastic idea. I used old fashioned oat because that is what I prefer and made mine a little thicker since I like to pour a little cold cream over my hot oatmeal, real healthy right? I will make this again! Thanks for the recipe Lissa!

This was an awesome recipe, but my mom thought it was too rich.  I'm 11, and I would have given it 5 stars.  We didn't have turbinado sugar so we used white sugar instead.  We also didn't have almonds so we used pecans.  I'm guessing you could use any nut.  This was the best oatmeal I've ever had.

I gave this 3 stars because I think a recipe should be rated AS IT IS, and as it is it's too sweet and rich for most people. I tweaked it a bit and thought it was great, and if you want to make it healthier, you can make these changes: reduce the sugar to 1 T as it is really way too sweet otherwise, and sub the sugar for artificial stevia-based sweetener; reduce cocoa to 1 teaspoon and add a scoop of chocolate whey protein. That will give you the right macronutrient balance between carbs and protein, in case you are like me and oatmeal without more protein will leave you with low blood-sugar or hungry within an hour or two. Use skim milk or almond milk ---- it works just as well. 

In sum, here is what worked for me: old-fashioned rolled oats: 1/2 cup with 1 cup skim milk, mixed with 1 teaspoon cocoa, the almond extract, and 1 T Truvia (Krisda is the same thing if that's what you have in your area). Mixed together and microwaved on medium for five minutes. Stirred in 1 scoop of chocolate protein powder and the banana afterwards, along with the almonds. If the oats seem watery add a bit more whey protein. 

Ate with 1/4 cup almond milk and it was soooo good.

I am a chocolholic, and this recipie is FANTASTIC!!!!  I made it for my kids for a special SUnday breakfast, and even my picky son ate a whole bowl of this.  It IS really rich, but if you like rich, then it is perfect!  Tastes like warm chocolate pudding.  Would even be a good dessert.

This is a really good recipe, but I also found it rather rich for breakfast. I do love all the flavors but I think I'd cut back on the sugar and use less almond extract (or maybe just use vanilla instead).  The cocoa powder is also a bit too much for me in the morning so I'll cut back on that as well.  This is definitely a great recipe, I'll just tweak it for my personal tastes. Thanks a lot for sharing!

This oatmeal was really good, and an awesome source of potassium! I expected it to be bland, but it's great. I cut the recipe in half because I only wanted one serving, and it still worked out great. I also left out the almonds. If you don't like bananas, and you want to try to find a way to eat them to get that potassium in your tummy, this is a great thing to make! That's why I made it.

I made this for myself and my sister... we liked having chocolate for breakfast, but the almond extract was a little too much. I used brown sugar since I didn't have turbinado. Still, I would try it again minus the extract if I'm craving chocolate! thanks :)

I thought this was pretty good. The amount of cocoa could be divided in half, as well as the sugar, and that would be plenty for me; but that's a personal preference. I liked the almond extract and crunch of the almonds with the banana. The only difference in cooking is that I put the banana in first and cooked that for a couple minutes before adding the quick oats for just another minute more. Cooking quick oats for 5 minutes would make it too thick for me. This recipe was a yummy and interesting way to have oatmeal.

Pretty good! Works with any kind of nut. I would recommend using half as much almond extract, a little too much of a strong taste for me

This was pretty good! My only critique is maybe use less almond extract, it seemed to over power this a little bit. It does work out if you use regular white sugar (I didn't have turbinado sugar). It made the house smell really good too :)

I can't decide what I think of this...I felt like I was eating No Bake Cookie "batter" for breakfast (which made me want to add peanut butter).  I skipped the banana because I don't care for them and I think it needs banana to add a but of sweetness.  If I made this again, I'd probably add cherries to replace the bananas.  THANKS for the recipe, Lissa!

Made this once as written and it was bitter, but I could taste the potential. The second time, I used half a frozen overripe banana and a few dark chocolate morsels, plus the oatmeal and water. It was fantastic this way! Thanks for the inspiration!
