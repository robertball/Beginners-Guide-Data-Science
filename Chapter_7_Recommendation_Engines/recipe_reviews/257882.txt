Over all a very good cookie, i gave it four stars only because for me they are WAY too sweet. if you have a sweet tooth, these are definitely for you. i didn't chill the dough, so i came away with a thin, crisp yet chewy cookie. just the way i like them! The cookie itself would be very good on it's own, they're quite delicious. The filling is good too, but just way too sweet for me, but i know people who will just LOVE these! Thanks for the recipe!

I will be rating only the cookie part as I did not make the filling. The taste was great.  The first time I followed the directions exactly. they came out flat, very crunchy and fell apart. I even froze them before I baked them.  The second time I made the change of adding a total of 2 cups oatmeal and 1 cup flour. they were great!!

For the filling I used buttercream instead of cream cheese
