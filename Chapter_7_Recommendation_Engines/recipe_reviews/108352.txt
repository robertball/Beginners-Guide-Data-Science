In the months that I have used this site, this is the first time I felt that I absolutely had to give homage to a recipe.  I served this to for a party a while back and the feedback was amazing.  This was a bunch of twenty-something year olds and by the end of the night I had given directions on how to get the recipe at least a dozen times.    I did make a slight change.  I left out the chopped mint on accident, as I was rushed to get it out on the table.  However I'm not a huge fan of mint anyways and the salsa still went over amazingly.  Also I used Tostito's Hint-of-Lime Tortilla Chips and I think they complimented it nicely.    One final remark:  Don't skimp on the Red Onion or the Jalapeno.  I don't handle spice very well but if you de-seed the jalapeno well it won't be an issue and the two, especially the red onion, give the salsa a necessary "bite" to it that you need in order for it to be a salsa and not too fruity.    Huge rave and will definitely be using this for parties more often. Make sure to make it the night of if you want it chunky, otherwise it gets liquidy within a few hours.

This Salsa is so fresh!
I left out the Jalapeno as I was looking for something to cool down my jerk chicken.
It was perfect, can't wait to have it again.

I made this upon request for my son's 14th birthday. It was a huge hit with the adults, but those pesky teenagers would not even try it. Well, except for my son and he LOVED it. Perect combo of fruitiness and spicyness. I quadrupled the recipe and ended up not having quite enough mango, but it didn't matter. And I had to use canned pineapple because no fresh was available. I used the exact recipe and at first it tasted a little salty. But by the next day, it was perfect. I think it could have even used more jalapenos. This will be on my go to list from now on.

This is a great fruity salsa to serve with white fish. Canned fruits can be used too without lack of flavor. Easy to make and delicious.

This salsa is so awesome!  We just used half the salt (kosher salt).  We have already made this twice in a week!  Super duper recipe.

I absolutely loved this salsa.  I served it with tortilla chips.  The event I took it too, gained me and the recipe a lot of great compliments.

Great salsa! For those looking for a little more heat, I substituted a habenero pepper instead of the jalepeno (DO NOT use more than one). I also grilled the fresh pineapple slices and the red onion before dicing them and tossing them into the mixture. Once chilled, it got rave reviews at our Cinco de Mayo party.

My husband really liked this.  I thought it was OK, just not worth the effort it took to dice everything.  I used it over some grilled chicken and rice.  It made for a healthy light dinner but I won't be running to make it again.

This was great! I put it over grilled chicken for dinner and mixed it with cottage cheese for lunch. A little too spicy to use for breakfast like recommended, but perfect for other meals!

I just made this and it is absolutely delicious.  My grocery store didn't have the papaya, so I just used extra mango.  I can't imagine how much better it would be with the papaya!

Added some more spices (Indian chat masala) and fruits were based on what I had.
