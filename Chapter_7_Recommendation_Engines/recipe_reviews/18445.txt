Love this recipe.  Second time I made it, I toasted the cashews in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes so they would stay crunchy in the salad.

I was striving for a "healthy" recipe but settled on this one.  With slight modifications, it was the hit of the office potluck!  I don't think celery adds much in taste so I used zuchinni, used real mayo (ugh on Miracle Whip!), added red grapes and left out the green peppers (too many people don't like peppers).  My husband and I ate the salad the day I made it and it was only okay.  However, after sitting 24 hours, it was truly great.  Even though it was sweet, I had no complaints.

One of my new favorite pasta salad recipes! Very tasty! I also added a 1/2 bell red pepper for some color and I cooked the chicken by frying in a pan with 1 TBLS of butter and lightly seasoning it with lemon pepper. Even my PICKY brother-in-law (age 15) was impressed and helped himself to seconds. Plan to make many times, esspecially this summer!

I LOVE This! I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and lemon pepper and then placed them in a plastic bowl and covered with water and then placed a chicken bouillion cube in. Covered with plastic wrap and microwaved for 13 minutes. After this was done and cooled I cut into cubes for this salad. I was out of Miracle Whip so I used 1/2 cup of low fat Marzetti's and 1/2 cup of low fat mayo. I used 1/2 onion and sliced a green onion for color. This is so so so tasty! It is very sweet and oniony. Thanks so much for this recipe, my oldest son and I can't get enough of this!

I really liked the idea of this recipe and made a few modifications.  I wanted to make a salad for sandwiches, so I omitted the pasta.  The cashews were substituted for pecans, which I toasted.  It was delicious, and I am making it again right now.

everybody loves this one...i'm not crazy about onions, so just put a bunch of onion powder in there.  i've also made it without the peppers.  i've taken it to parties/poker nite, etc. and have learned to take the cashews with me and put them in at the last minute...they get soggy if you don't.  definately a winner.

great recipe and easy to make. I took out the celery but added sliced red grapes. The grapes are a great addition to the recipe. Will make again!

THE BEST!!!  Looking through the old recipes in my recipe box I see that I started making this in the summer of '03.  And I still make it often today.  I'm not a huge fan of pasta salad but this is really really good.  The only change I've made is that I usually leave the cashews out.  Don't want to risk someone at a party having a nut allergy. For the chicken, I usually use the "Cajun Chicken" recipe from this site and grill it on my foreman. I make it the day before and have even made quadruple batches on a Friday night to cover all the BBQ's over a long holiday weekend.  It's expected of me to bring it at summer gatherings and people actually seem disappointed if I don't.

I always get compliments on this salad.  Sometimes I substitute halved purple grapes for the celery, or sometimes still keep the celery in the salad.  I think you can twist this many ways, but 5 stars for the original recipe.

Really interesting dressing.  I'd say measure carefully as the sour/sweet could get out of balance without care.  Leftovers disappeared quickly!

Have used this recipe on several occasions. Always a hit. Most times, we omit the chicken and have it as a side dish with almost anything. Haven't tried it with grapes as others have suggested but it sure sounds good!

Loved it!  I used light miracle whip, red bell pepper, omitted the onion, grilled the chicken, added pineapple tidbits, fresh mandarin oranges, and a little seasoned salt. I left the rest the same as original recipe. Next time I will stir in some chow mein noodles!

Wow, this is a fabulous salad. Both my fiance and I truly enjoyed it! I actually didn't have any cooked chicken, and so I roasted some chicken with rosemary, olive oil, lemon, salt & pepper  and then added the chicken into the salad. The taste was phenomenal! Will definitely do this again.

This in a excellent salad.  I loved the dressing.  The first time I made this I did exactly what the recipe said.  The second time, I left out the grapes and cashews just to see the difference.  Both types were incredible!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was quite tasty as the recipe was written except that I used lite mayo instead of Miracle whip. As I read it, that was simply an example anyway.

Because I don't like chunks of chicken, I always use my food chopper to finely chop the chicken and the chicken is like an accessory to the salad - it's really good and I've received a lot of rave reviews for the salad.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  If you are looking for added color, I use rainbow rotini pasta, adds texture and color to the salad.  Also add red or green halved grapes, let sit overnight and enjoy!

This recipe was very good.  I put a sundried tomato garlic rub on the chicken and cooked on the grill - for extra flavor.  I also added some dill because the salad seemed to be lacking some flavor.  I recommend leaving out the salt in the recipe because of the cashews already having salt on them.  Also, just for reference....4 average size stalks of celery equals about 2 cups.

Everyone loved this salad at our last party. I wanted to make a large batch, so I used a one pound box of the large seashell pasta and doubled all of the "sauce" ingredients. Didn't use all of it initially, but added some just before serving and the next day.  Next time I may try some adding some red grapes. Thanks for sharing!

Great chicken salad!  I followed other's suggestions and modified my recipe as follows:  1/2 regular mayo 1/2 light mayo, added 1 tbl of parmesan salad dressing, used two green onions chopped (i thought one whole onion would be too strong for our tastes), substituted bell peppers with broccoli (as that is what we had), halved red grapes, grilled chicken with lemon pepper seasoning, toasted cashew in convection oven for 8 mins, mix all together.  It was delicious cold and even better the next day!  Will certainly make for upcoming picnic.

I am not usually a fan of cold chicken salad, but this changed my mind.  Very good served on a bed of shredded lettuce.  Thanks, Mary.

Very good.  I added bacon and used green onions.  Think it might be good w/sunfower seeds - might try that next time.

Awesome salad! This is our new family favorite.  This also tastes great with apple cider vinegar instead of distilled.

This was really good.  I made it for lunch today after church.  I didn't have brown sugar so I used white and also used mayo instead of miracle whip.  I used a red bell pepper instead of green and liked the taste.  I also added craisins which just made the salad.  I would like to used grapes next time- I think that would taste great.  Great recipe!

This is Deelicious!! Since I was in a big hurry, I used "Marzetti Slaw Dressing",which is very similar in taste to the mayo/vinegar/sugar recipes and canned white meat chicken. My picky eaters even gobbled this up! Thanks Mary!

Yummy.  My only alterations were based on personal preferences (e.g. more mayo, more cashews, less onion, more vinegar).  Great salad.

My husband and I found this cashew chicken pasta salad to be a little on the bland side.  I added lots of freshly chopped basil and chives from my herb garden, some sliced kalamata olives, and a heavy hand with the Salt & pepper.  I still needed to add some white worcestershire sauce for some zing.

first taste i wasnt so sure but the more i ate the tastier it was, although i made a few changes. to start with im from AUS so the mesurment in cups are smaller so i just getimated.haha
i didnt add capsican(bell pepper) i used a tiny bit of brown vinigar as it was all i had adn used spring onions instead of onion.
for the dressing i used mayo and added an extra 1/2 cup of sour cream as it was a bit sweet. next time i reduce the sugar and only put in 1/4 of a 1/4 cup. but was still yum and will make again

I left out the green peppers because we don't care for them.   It tasted good but something was missing, haven't put my finger on it yet.  Maybe next time I make it i'll try adding some grapes to give it a little more color.

This salad is perfection. When store was out of purple grapes, I used green. (I cut them in half to add to salad) I needed color, so I added shredded purple cabbage. I thought it added good crunch and color to the salad so now I add every time. This is a good salad to treat girlfriends coming for lunch. Everyone enjoys it.

We loved this recipe.  I didn't have distilled white vinegar to played a chance and used apple cider vinegar.  I omited celery & bell pepper, also, and instead added halved grapes.  It was great and I'll definitely make it again!

Great tasting chicken salad.  I used halved red seedless grapes and red wine vinegar in place of the green bell pepper and white distilled vinegar (only because I didn't have those ingredients on hand).  It tasted great. I will definitely be making this for the next potluck!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it was excellent!  I was a little unsure of how the combination of ingredients might mix but the flavor was very good.  It was just slightly sweet and I liked the crunch the bell pepper and cashews gave to it.  A definite repeat at our house.  A very easy dinner served with mini croissants that I made ahead of time so no rushing around at dinnertime.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy! I used 1 cup celery. I also added 1 1/4 cup champagne table grapes! I found these at Whole Food. They are the cutest things! They are purple grapes the size of baby peas. This addition, in my opinion, made this salad. I might use more cashews next time. Thanks for sharing!

A friend was looking for a recipe of this type. I decided to try it for an office potluck to see if she would like it. I brought the recipe for her and ended up making 10 copies to share! I omitted the green peppers and used less onion (for those that are fussy) and added halved red seedless grapes. Yummy! Some were suprised that the dressing was made with Miracle Whip. A dash of pepper would be a good kick to the dressing, and one reviewers idea of red bell pepper would jazz up the color. Will try that another time. Love this recipe!!

I made this for a summer BBQ and it was perfect.

To add some color I used green onions instead of regular and red bell pepper instead of green.

Not only was it delicious, but pretty.

Next time I'm adding a little freshly cracked pepper.

Don't add anything to this recipe!!  It's perfect just the way it is.  It's a refreshing change of pace from the ordinary.  I like to get the precooked, packaged Italian-Style chicken (Short Cuts) when I'm in a hurry.

This salad is absolutely delicious.  I have made it for 3 parties and it has been requested several times after that.  It is a huge hit, especially in the summer with grilled items!

This was very good and my whole family loved it.  A really nice change from the oil and vinegar dressings we have been having lately.  I tried it without the chicken and added more cashews and some mandarin orange segments like suggested.  I also used a mixture of red and yellow peppers in place of the green because that's what I had on hand.  Definitely will make this salad again and again.

This is a great salad. I substituted ranch dressing for the mayo. Also, I used rainbow rotini (corkscrew) instead of the shell pasta. It adds some color. This was very good. I will definately make it again.

This is the BEST!  What wonderful flavors.  My family loved this and I plan to take this to my next family cookout.  Allthough my little ones picked out the celery.  But they don't care for celery anyway.  I can't wait to fix this again.  This will be served often.  Thanks for this recipe Mary!

Use chunks of pineapple in this salad instead of celery and it tastes just like sweet and sour chicken cashew salad.  Really good.

I read the reviews and was intrigued by the unusual combination of ingredients in the dressing for this salad. I, too, must agree with the majority of the reviewers. This is an absolutely delicious salad. I intend to see if it tastes as good with light Miracle Whip and Splenda brown sugar blend, but this first time I used full calorie ingredients.

Excellent recipe! I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 miracle whip, used a little less brown sugar, used a sprinkle or two of celery seed as my family doesn't like the crunchy celery in salads, and sprinkled the chicken with a half packet of Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing mix (the powder)before baking it. Tastes great already and I just made it 2 hrs ago. Can't wait to see how it is tomorrow as others said it tastes better the next day!

This was good but not great. I too left out the celery, onions and pepper and added grapes. Maybe I should have followed the recipe and not substituted.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I really thought it was going to be great with all of the 5 stars it got in the reviews.  I thought it was very, very bland.  It's a good start, but I definitely think it needs some seasoning.  The cashews were very good. Thanks for sharing.

I had not made this dish before I served it at my bbq and and one guest commented that she would just have seconds & thirds of this dish and no dessert. It's very good.  I used one box of medium size shell pasta, red pepper, and green onions.  I didn't add the celery because I didn't have any.

This is a great salad.  Got good reviews from many.  I used a small amount too much of pasta, but still loved it.  (Plus it had refregirated over night so it absorded some of the dressing)  I used red bell pepper instead of green.  I was a little nervous about the dressing because prior to adding it to the pasta I didn't really like it, found it too sweet and strong tasting, but once on the pasta with the veggies and cashews it was tasty.

This review is a little late.  I made this for a barbecue last summer.  A nice change from the usual chicken salad.  I left out the green peppers, used green onions, and mixed in some chopped red grapes.  It was a hit at the party.

I loved the taste - but my husband and 4 year old thought it was "too oniony."  I would make it again and leave out the onions.  I would say the prep time is more like 25 mins because of all the chopping.  I ground up the cashews instead of leaving them in halves.

This absolutely fabulous.  Gets eaten up quickly at potlucks.  I would make this all the time if my husband wasn't allergic to cashews.  I wonder if almonds would taste just as good?

Nice tangy/sweet flavor- I used 1/2 amount of brown sugar called for and only 2 chicken breasts. I found that any more sugar would of been to sweer. Need to eat with the cashews to appreciate the flavor- don't leave them out. I thought it was pretty good- a bit different but I do have other salads we like better. I think it is more of a side dish then a main dish because of the sweet flavor.

This was phenomenal; I left out the celery, just b/c I didn't have any on hand, and used only two chicken breasts....but everyone who has tried it so far has loved it.  It is very creamy, so if you like your pasta salad a little on the lighter side, I would suggest adding a little more pasta.  Overall - absolutely fantastic - I will make again and again for summer BBQs!

I made this recipe to take to a potluck at my brother-in-law's house and everyone loved it except my 6 year-old.  (He doesn't like cashews) I also added in red grapes. The sweet/salty mixture was great.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Yes!  I just took this to a community brunch and got compliments galore, and several requests for the recipe.  It tastes great.  It looks a little bland, because there is no bright color, so maybe the red onion would be a good idea, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks, Mary.

This is one of the best recipes I have made from this site.  It's a great tasting salad and was a big hit at a family picnic!  I added mandarian oranges as another reviewer mentioned and it was the cherry on top!!!  Thanks Mary!!

Yum, this one will be a staple for summer meals.  I used grilled chicken breasts and light mayo instead of miracle whip and it still tasted fantastic.

I can't even tell you how much I liked this recipe! It was great and I'm so glad I found it! I LOVE THIS WEBSITE! My boyfriend didn't get any because I served it to some of my girlfriends who came over and we all ate this up. Two girls left with the recipe. I know this is suppossed to be a side dish but it worked well for a main course for us! Will make again, and again, and again....

I made this salad and served it at a luncheon.  Everyone loved it and it was so easy to make.  Even my super picky daughter was poking throught the fridge the next day looking for any that was leftover.

I just made this for dinner and my family really liked it.  I didn't have vinegar, so I used Italian salad dressing instead and it tasted great.  I also left out the green pepper as I don't really care for them.  Very good recipe and will make again.

This is a great recipe, very fresh and tangy.  I did not use any cashew nuts, and it was still excellent.  I used the Louis Rich chicken strips for my chicken and it was delicious, also saved some time.  Overall, I think this is a recipe that is worth saving.

I added a few more items: Green onion, black olive, and carrots for color. Family like itand voted to 'let's do this one again'. Son thought there was too much dressing, so he only picked out and ate the cashews! Everyone else enjoyed it!

I recently made this pasta recipe for a luncheon and it was excellent. I've had several requests for the recipe. People wonder what the "secret" dressing is! I know I'll make this often.

I'm not a big meat eater but I thought perhaps hiding the chicken in the pasta would allow me to get my protein in some way. Didn't quite work out. With that being said. When I picked around the chicken and just ate the pasta I found it to be good. It was a neat idea to put some brown sugar in it. It added a nice sweetness with the combination of the vinegar. The cashews sprinkled on top was a perfect add on. I might add nuts and brown sugar to all my pasta salads now. Thanks for sharing.

Add water chestnuts, and served over chow main noodles for even more crunch. Left out the pasta as I am cutting down on that!

I wanted to try something a little different from the traditional potato or pasta salad to bring to a bbq I was going to, this Chicken Cashew Salad was such a hit I got asked to bring it to every bbq's after that. Everyone loved the creamy sweet and salty flavor of the dressing and cashews.
