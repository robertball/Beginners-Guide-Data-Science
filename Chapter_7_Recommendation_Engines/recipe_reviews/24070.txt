It is extremely time consuming to paint the chocolate into the little cups, but they are good I will make them again for a special occasion.

The best chocolate peanut butter candy recipe around. Every time I make them, they are gone within minutes!! Painting the cupcake cups take a long time, so I use a chocolate cup mould which makes perfect bite sized cups!! Thanks for the great recipe!
