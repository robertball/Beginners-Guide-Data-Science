We had a Hawaiian themed dinner. This was good for the theme, but I prefer traditional sweet potatoes. I don't care for macademia nuts, but in this dish, it was pretty good.

I liked it! I added some leftover coconut milk (about 1/2 cup)and mixed it with the pineapple juice instead of orange juice. I also added cinnamon. I prefer it over the traditional marshmallow yam casserole.

This is really good. I used 1/2 cup pineapple juice and 1/2 cup coconut milk. I also always use the stick blender to blend sweet potatoes/yams to smooth them out. This is divine.

I made this for our early Thanksgiving today and it was really good! I would probably up the brown sugar and lower the OJ blend next time but it was very tasty. I used canned sweet potatos (shh...).

I made this for the requested yam dish at Thanksgiving.  This was simple and light.  I'd make it again.
