I submitted this recipe and am glad to hear that others are enjoying it. I have two tips. I find that using a frozen banana imparts a more intense banana flavor. Plus it chills the pudding instantly so you can eat it sooner :) Also, add a tsp of vanilla if you use regular cow's milk.

Oh my gosh, I am in love with this.  It feels absolutely DECADENT.  I used firm tofu because that's all I had on hand, but it worked just fine.  Amazing recipe!

I think all the right flavors are in there and the tofu gives body to the pudding but since tofu doesn't have much taste the overall flavor is very subtle. Couldn't really taste the banana either so I would say either use a very ripe banana or throw in an extra. Think it'd taste better served with something else, like fruit. Will try playing around with the proportions next time but all in all, great way to use up extra tofu!

This is delicious! Very creamy and smooth; better texture than regular pudding imo. Not too sweet; the chocolate and banana flavors are really highlighted. Served with additional sliced banana and sprinkle of cinnamon. Also got five stars from omni hubby and picky 9 and 12 year olds. Thanks for the post!

My husband accidentally got some soft tofu, so I was in search of some new recipes.  I tried making this pudding this morning.  I used frozen banana and milk with some vanilla, but, otherwise, I stayed with the recipe.  It thickened up really well.  I served it to my 2 & 4 year old's at lunch with some blueberries and a dollop of whipped cream.  They loved it.  It does have just a little bit of a powdery aftertaste.  I think this comes from having so much confectioner's sugar and cocoa powder.  I will definitely keep this one and play with the proportions.  I think I might try some simple syrup instead of the powdered sugar.  I might also try some melted dark chocolate to replace some of the cocoa powder.  But, this is an awesome base recipe to jump all over from.

YAY for healthy pudding!!!! I used extra firm tofu because I wanted the pudding to be more firm. It set great like a pie filling. I used 7-8 SweetNLow packets instead of confectioners' sugar to make it as low-cal as possible. Don't leave out the cinnamon it adds the perfect flavor. Next time I will not put in as much Cocoa powder. I mixed in 1 cp chopped bananas, blueberries and strawberries and it was AMAZING!!

This is really good.  I don't love tofu, and really made this so that my son could have a sweet treat that had some nutritional value.  I used two bananas, a bit more than a pinch of cinnamon, skim milk, and a little over a teaspoon of vanilla.  MUCH better than any other recipies I've tried.

Simple. Easy. Delicious.  It is Vegetarian Festival here in Thailand during the period 15-23 Oct 12.  I shared this dish with some friends at the office.  They would not believe it's made of tofu.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  Even when it's not Vegetarian Festival here, I will surely make this again and again!

Oh my gosh! I have tried a few pudding style recipe with tofu but this came out perfect. It has to sit in the fridge to thicken and blend flavors. Don't judge it right after you make it. I did leave out the cinnamon and didn't miss it.

Neither my husband or I was fond of this (though to be fair he's not a tofu fan like I am) but our toddler really seemed to like it with extra banana as a dessert.   The problem was not the tofu because I couldn't tell that it had tofu in it at all.  It just wasn't rich enough for my taste.  Perhaps someone who is more used to vegan recipes would enjoy it more.    I think I might prefer this recipe if it was made with dutch processed cocoa or even melted chocolate chips.

OMG I can't believe how wonderful this recipe came out! I wanted to lick the whole bowl. It had no "odd" taste (even though I would have eaten it anyway) I made it according to some of the other reviews: I used two medium bananas for flavor (not frozen), the silken tofu 12 oz., no sugar, so I used 4 (you can taste) artificial sweetener packets; 3 T of the unsweetened cocoa powder; 4 T soy milk (not even vanilla); 1 t cinnamon. I did add 1 T peanut butter because I love it. Spun it in my cuisinart and then put in some pretty glasses. (made 4) and topped with a few chopped walnuts. Beautiful and delicious. No wheat, no milk. Yummm

This recipe is great for what it is, which is a low-calorie, vegan, tasty chocolate treat. However, you certainly will not be deceived into thinking that it is real cream. The tofu, in particular, leaves a bit of an aftertaste. Next time I make it I will use less tofu and an additional banana.

Not to my taste.  I had some extra silken tofu and wanted to use it up.  Fortunately it was only enough to make 1/2 of the recipe.

Since I am doing Weight Watchers I converted this recipe by replacing the sugar with sugar subsitute. It wasn't Splenda so I had to  use a cup to sweeten it. The 5 T. of cocoa powder was very over powering. I think the next time I make this I will start with 2 & go from there. I also froze my bananas like someone suggested but didn't find that made a difference. I also used another fresh banana. Still couldn't taste them since the cocoa was so strong. I took this to a friends house for dessert since she is also doing W.W. We put sliced strawberries & some whipped cream from a can on top. It ended up being a 2 pt. dessert for about a cup. I will make this again...all in all a good, lite dessert.

So awesome. I admit I was the only one in my family was impressed...no one else could get past the uncooked tofu part, but it's so good. And I followed it exactly. I used the frozen banana as suggested, but it definitely would be a good idea to first chop the banana before freezing so it's easier to blend...and try freezing the pudding itself, yummy:)

This was pretty good taste-wise.  I made the mistake of trying it out as a pudding pie, and of course it doesn't set up firm enough for that.  But it's a great way to use up tofu.

This is a great idea. Like other reviewers, I used firm tofu, skim milk, and vanilla. The consistency takes a bit of getting used to but definitely worth it for such a healthy desert. Great way to use up tofu!

Good for what it is...a dessert substitute.  Taste is bitter; I decrease the cocoa by 1 tbsp and increase the sugar to 1/3 cup to make it more palatable.  It does have a nice mousse consistency and is good with granola.

I loved this vegan pudding! To make it a little better for hubby & I, I added 2 Tbl of natural peanut butter, 1 1/2 Tbl of soy protein powder & 1 Tbl turmeric. Delicious! On top of hubby's I put a vegan dark chocolate covered strawberry.

Very easy and tasty. I used two overripe bananas and that worked nicely. My tofu package was 14 oz, so I added a little extra of all the other ingredients, too. Added maybe 1-2 tbs of vanilla also.

I liked this very much, but it really needed to be bit sweeter, so I added about an eighth tsp. of Stevia and liked the taste better. I'm happy to find a low fat, healthy dessert! Thanks for sharing this, Mirby.

Great dessert!  I used about 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, and added 1 tsp vanilla.  Served mini marshmallows on top.

YUM! I modified a bit because of what I had on hand, etc. I'm sure it would be fabulous as-written though! Here's what I did differently: used leftover tofu so only had about 8oz, used evaporated milk, no cinnamon (yet, may try in my next helping). I didn't really measure anything--did it more "smoothy-like", rough estimates of milk, cocoa, and sugar until it tasted right... Nice way to use up a bit of tofu!

Great fix for a sweet tooth. Super easy to make. I added chia seeds which gave it a great texture and garnished with dark chocolate chips. Will use less cocoa next time, as I think it was a bit overpowering.

Amazingly rich.  I, too, only had firm tofu on hand, but it's so decadent, I'll definitely use it again!  Wonderful!

I am not vegan or vegetarian but I do like to cut on my consumption vof animal products and I must say that this chocolate pudding is AMAZING! This recipe is everything I want in a chocolate pudding it is thick and creamy and super chocolate. I was worried that the pudding would watery and just have an overall weirdness to it but it does not at all.

Great recipe, very simple. I used lite firm tofu but added two tablespoons of fresh ground peanut butter.  Yum. Calories per serving, 148.

I'm not a big fan of banana, so I thought this recipe was just okay.  I probably used too big of a banana though - 9 inches is plenty!  I used skim milk, so I added 1 tsp vanilla extract to the recipe.  I especially liked this frozen!

fantastic, I love this recipe.  I used regular milk just because I didn't need it to be Vegan. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  My only wish was that I could find tofu in 12ounce packs.  The one I had was 14 ounces and because my family is not big on tofu I had wasted tofu.  Thank you for a great dessert recipe that I can feel good about feeding to my kids.

I was looking for something non-dairy to take to Thanksgiving as I have a family of vegans attending!  Well! I just made a half batch of this to try out for me lol and looks like I'll be eating it all myself!  DELISH!  You can certainly play around with how much cocoa or cacao powder you use...I used 2 & 1/2 tablespoons and it is pretty chocolately...I only used 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar but really it's still very good and almond milk as it's all I had.  Will be serving it in small 2 or 3oz plastic cups with little spoons...and maybe add a topping of some kind..even a fresh raspberry or something!  A keeper!!   :)

I only added an extra half a banana and about a half tsp of vanilla...plenty sweet (bananas were very ripe), and tasted like chocolate banana pudding, very tasty!

I found that this had a very powdery taste from the cocoa powder.  After some research i have found the following: To mix cocoa powder with a liquid (or really, to mix any powder with a liquid - salt and granulated sugar aren't powders), you need to make a slurry by mixing a small part of the liquid into all of the powder. Then you can dilute the slurry with the rest of the liquid.
So by just putting all of the ingredients in the blender at once,  you will ruin batch after batch unless you use the slurry method for the cocoa powder.

Very tasty, quick and easy! I will be making this again, as soon as I get some more tofu!

I left out the soya milk and sugar as my banana made it sweet enough for my taste. I prefer a dark chocolate taste. I also ate it straight away without chilling it and  for me, it was perfect! 

Seems like quite a forgiving recipe and next time I'm going to try adding a bit of rum or coffee and some semi blended chunks of banana. 

Could also turn it into a smoothie / sports recovery drink, by blending with more soy milk and ice...

good.  No, you cannot taste the tofu. All the tofu I had was extra firm and it came out with a perfect texture. Also, use a fozen banana (if you are like me and keep frozen bananas) so you can eat it right away. I omit the cinnamon,  it tastes better that way....chocolate and banana yes, but chocolate,  banana and cinnamon -- maybe for someone else but not us. Great pudding.  Thank you very much for the recipe!

It had a great texture but I found the tofu taste overpowered the rest. I topped it with some raspberries, whipped topping, and almonds.

This was so good. Now this  is the recipe I'll use.  I'd never know tofu was in it if I didn't make it. Pudding has nice consistency and keeps it for several days in frig.  Thanks for sharing.

SUPER yummy if you like a little soy after taste. Yum! My mother and sister did not like it, but I certainly did.
