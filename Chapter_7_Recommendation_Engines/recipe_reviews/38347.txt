Bland, bland, bland.  

There are MAJOR problems with this recipe.   After prep, the burgers are like runny mounds of slop...good luck holding them together.  Because of their runnienss, they stick to the grill and spread out like pancakes.

After cooking, they come out extrememly dry! And the spice amounts...in 2 pounds of ground beef, what the heck is a 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil gonna do??  

The only good thing about this is that the vegetables add a but of a snap and crunch when you're eatin' em.  I'm not trying this again.

Well, I'm on a diet - so I thought I'd try these with ground turkey instead. 

It was really nasty - i do NOT recommend you use the low fat ground turkey with these.  

But, it seemed that these would be rather bad even if made with ground beef.

This recipe is awesome! My husband and I love them.  They are very filling.  The only problem we had was that the patties fell apart a little.  But they were still great and will become a regular for us!

I have to say, I was a bit skeptical of this recipe because it seemed like a little salad on a bun...but it was really good!  Even those of you who don't like vegetables will like this recipe.  What I did is scale the recipe down to 2 servings...that way if they turned out horrible, I wouldnt' have wasted too much food.  Turns out, I would have been fine with the entire amount!  My roomate really liked them, too.

I have had this recipe in my RB for 3 years! Finally got around to making these babies! Interesting flavor, black beans are so healthy for you! My grill wasn't working so I cooked them on the stove. I really liked the flavor! I served them on onion buns and onions inside, never enough onions! YUMO! LOL Thank You Rookie Wookie!!

I really enjoyed this recipe! They've got a little heat to 'em and overall looked and tasted great. 

I made some minor changes. I doubled the beans, halved the size of the patties, used serrano peppers instead of jalapeno's, and cooked them on an electric indoor grill. I finished them off with slices of cucumber to balance the heat.

This one, is going in the books! I imagine it will become a household favorite.

I've made it with and without the beans, It tends to be a sloppy meal with the beans.

Recipe was delicious!  I made a few changes instead of fresh pepper, I used crushed pepper flakes; I also used some cracker crumbs to hold them together, but not enough to make really dry.
