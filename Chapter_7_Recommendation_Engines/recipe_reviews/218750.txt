This was good, but if I didn't tweek it, it would have been bland. I added some italian seasoning and red wine to the ground beef as it cooked. I used gouda cheese instead of jack or mozzarella, and asiago instead of parmesan. This brought the flavor up and we really liked it. Be sure to drain the beef well, or it could be watery in the end.

We used a 9 x 13 baking dish. My only problem with this is I want to find a way to put a crust on the bottom. I think adding a bottom crust would be awesome. We kind of jazzed up the meat mixture using: Italian suasage, sliced black olives, chopped pepperoni, a good amount of Italian seasonings and more onion. It was wonderful and if you let your imagination run amuk, the possibilities are endless. I think it would taste great with a Mexican flavor. We will centainly prepare this again and do some serious thinking about alternative ingredients. Someone said it is such a great basic recipe just begging for jazzing up. Great!!

Very easy to make! I added green peppers & mushrooms to the beef/pasta sauce to add a little something extra. I also had a garlic butter spread that I melted & added to the parmesan for the top. This got 6 thumbs up in my house - a rare achievement!

This is one of those great jumping off recipes. The ingredients did not offer enough for our taste so I tweaked it with good results. I added a couple links of sweet italian sausage to the ground beef. I also added my homemade pizza sauce to richen the pasta sauce. I then added a generous 2 cups of mozzarella and skipped the sour cream because I was out. Sparky said it taste like an upside down pizza. Have fun playing with this.

I don't like beef too often, so I used spicy Italian sausage as my meat. I saw a few other people comment that it was bland, but with the spicy Italian sausage, it was flavorful and had a nice kick to it. The sour cream really added a nice, cooling touch. I'd make this again.

This was suprisingly very good. I will make this again because this is a great base recipe to tweak. I did add sliced crimini mushrooms and 2 cloves of minced garlic, because, in my mind, Italian screams garlic. Instead of parmesan on the top with the butter, I used grated Reggianito because that's what I had on hand. The variations that you can come up with using this recipe are completely endless. Thank you, Pillsbury...you guys have a winner with this one!

I really needed to add more spices for my family. Garlic, red pepper flakes, seasoned salt and more pasta sauce (used our favorite). Still didn't help very much. No raves, sorry.

Again, a very nice foundation recipe to build endless options. I added lots of chopped bell peppers, some garlic seasoning, red pepper flakes, and a little cumin...very nice!

Very tasty! I used homemade spaghetti sauce with tons of meat so this was an easy dish to make fast! I bought the "FLAKY" cresent rolls and this was probably not the best choice for this dish...a little too greasy, but the Flaky dinner rolls are my very favorite for rolls! I did make it in individual pie plates...it shaved a few minutes off baking! This reheats wells at 300 degrees wrapped in foil, then remove foil to crisp up the crust the last 5 minutes or so.

After reading the recipe and the previous reviews, I knew for certain that I would have to doctor this dish. I used Italian sausage, 4 cloves of garlic, half chopped green bell pepper, 6 oz. sliced mushrooms, one can sliced black olives, seasoned with dried basil, oregano and 1/4 tsp dried pepper flakes. I also subbed the mozzerella for provolone because that's what I had on hand. Baked a full 25 mins and did not experience undercooked crust. i will probably make this again for a quick lunch. Made per the recipe, it would be very kid friendly. Thanks Pillsbury!

This was easy to make and a great place to start for lots of different kinds of meat. I used ground beef, but like another reviewer said below, Italian sausage would be great or left over turkey or chicken. My family thought it was good. I'll make again, but will probably tweak some. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm a brand ambassador and this is one recipe from Pillsbury that we could choose to make.  I made it simply b/c I had the ingredients on hand.  This is a good starting off point but needs some tweaking.   I add 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp granulated garlic, and 1/4 tsp of Oregano to the meat.  I also sprinkled a little bit of Italian seasoning on top of the cresents.   It's simple enough,and I will likely make again.

Overall, this was a pretty good dish, but like others, I added a few seasonings to it. When browing the beef and onions, I added 2 cloves of garlic, salt & pepper to taste, and a sprinkle of seasoning salt. I used a store-bought pasta sauce with onions and mushrooms. Everything else was followed as written. The crescent rolls I used were the buttery flavor, but I think next time I'll just use the regular. I wasn't too fond of the sweet buttery taste. Thankfully the sour cream layer really helped to balance out the flavors. Hubby really liked this dish and asked me to make it again. It's very quick and easy!

I thought this was very good.  The flavors went together very nicely and you couldn't ask for an easier recipe.  This is a great meal for when your short on time but still want something hearty.

I would rate this five stars if it had more vegetables in it...that was the only downside to this dish.  I had a pound of ground beef that I needed to use and was looking for something fun and innovative that wasn't meatloaf or sloppy joes.  This was it!  I had all the ingredients in the pantry and fridge.  It was super easy and my husband loved it!  Not only did he have seconds, but he ate the leftovers the next day...definite winner!

This is excellent....I used Parm, Mozz and Jack cheeses along with half of the pasta sauce and added a small can of tomato sauce.  Of course, tweeked it green peppers, garlic and oregano like everyone else here.  My company loved it, thank goodness, since I made it for the first time tonight. Great comfort food and easy too!!!

This is the FIRST meal EVER that my entire family has agreed was awesome! The plate is empty with my 3 kids arguing over who got the rest! I'm so happy, I could dance around the kitchen! I used onion powder (no onion), shredded cheddar (out of mozz.) and 2/3 cup cottage cheese (no sour cream either!), pureed in blender. Forgot the Parmesan/butter for the top too! So, pretty much my own concoction, but still a hit. Thanks Pillsbury, I'm a happy Momma:)

Since I've made an effort to cook more naturally and less processed the past few years, I was a little apprehensive about trying this recipe for the Brand Ambassador program. I was pleasantly suprised however. I used the reduced fat cresent rolls, grass-fed beef and organic pasta sauce. I added a couple of cloves of garlic while browning the beef and some salt and pepper (about 1/2 tsp. each) to the beef-tomato mixture. I used shredded Colby-Jack cheese. With my doctoring, I give this recipe 5 stars and hubby says I should make it again!

My husband really liked this! I just made a few tweaks for our tastes: skipped the onion, browned the beef with a big clove of garlic and added oregano, parsley, onion powder after draining the beef. I also chopped up some mushrooms and added them to the meat/sauce mixture. Instead of sour cream I used fat free plain Greek yogurt, which worked very well. I did have a problem with some of the dough not cooking, but I know it was my own fault... I let some of the triangles overlap eachother in spots, so they couldn't cook all the way through. My bad.  Thanks Pillsbury!!! :)

This is what you call comfort food!  When my kids were little, this is exactly what they would have liked me to fix.  I made this using Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site which added lots of flavor to this meal.  I did have a hard time getting the middle of the top to brown--maybe because my dish was too deep for the ingredients.  It would have worked OK had I been a pie baker and had those gadgets that keep the edges of a pie from burning before the middle gets done.  The parmesan I used was a pellet-type Kraft cheese that made mine look even paler.  But I took pieces of this to work to heat up for my lunch and enjoyed it.  This is an easy dish for busy moms!  Thanks, Pillsbury!

Made the Pillsbury recipe, Zesty Italian Crescent Casserole for dinner with my adult kids... we all loved it. I made the casserole in my cast iron skillet, right from the stove top to the oven. So easy! The kids Amber and Mick's comment was that it tastes like really good Lasagna. I'm not sure I'd take it that far... but I will make it again... and looking forward to lunch left-overs tomorrow.   Just between us?  It was good cold at midnight by the light of the half open fridge. lol!  Really a good recipe, inexpensive, as much flavor as you want to give it and fast too. Five Stars!!!

This was super good!  We use dehydrated onion and added 1 1/2 italian seasoning to the meat.  Also followed a reviewers advice of adding 1/4C butter and 2tbsp minced garlic to the cheese and sour cream mixture.  My girls (5 and under) said it was fantastic.  We'll probably do 1/2lb italian sausage and 1/2 lb hamburger next time!  SOO good.

We really enjoyed this! I am only giving it 4 stars because as others have said, as written, the meat mixture was quite bland.  I ended up using pizza sauce because I already had an opened jar in the fridge, and added garlic and salt and pepper. I think this would also have great w/ maybe some green pepper, mushrooms, pepperoni or black olives. I do agree w/ Marianne that the center underneath part was a little underdone, but other than that it was tasty! I would make this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I think this recipe had potential.  However, I had to keep putting it in the oven because the crescent rolls just would not fully bake.  Eventually I had to give up.  I'm sure the error is mine but I'm not going to attempt the recipe again.

It's rare for me to make something all 4 of my kids like, rarer for me to get my oldest to eat something with tomato sauce but he had 2 pieces. I did make this with ground turkey due to a beef allergy and used my own pasta sauce. I forgot the parm on top but it was fine without it:)

Well I really liked this, but the finicky eaters in my house turned their noses up. But usually that means the dish is Awesome! I will make it again (and eat it all myself) Thanks!

I made a double batch in a 13"x9" pan (which was just right for 1 can of crescent rolls) and fixed it close to "as is" for the first go to see what we needed to tweek, but used Mario Batali Arrabiata pasta sauce because it sounded a little plain. It wasn't much more expensive than the other sauces available, and I think it gave just enough flavor to keep it from being bland. The dish turned out great and I was asked to make it again soon. I'm thinking about using 50/50 spaghetti and alfredo sauce next time, which is what we use for spaghetti at our house. I think I'll also add some Italian seasoning and spicy Volpi sausage (from St. Louis) since one of our local stores carries it now. I've also been dabbling with the thought of using ricotta instead of sour cream. One thing to note is that I would brush on the butter, then sprinkle on the parm, so you don't end up with soggy spots in the crust.

4 stars because it needs so many changes, but it was a big hit at our house and may become a regular!

This was delicious! The crispy crescent roll on top was amazing! I think next time I will add some more seasoning and maybe some bell peppers, mushrooms, and olives to give it that little something extra! Awesome recipe!

I changed this around quite a bit. My daughter has reactions to tomatoes so this is what I did.
I did the gound beef and onion, seasoned to my taste. Instead of tomatoe paste I used Broccoli and cheese soup! I used everything else this recipe says to do. I also put 3 cheeses on this. 
My 1 year old loved it and it was easy for me. Ill def make it again

My 11 year old VERY picky eater loved this.  It is definately a keeper.  I seasoned it to my family's liking with garlic, italian seasoning, salt and pepper.   Someone suggested adding a little wine to hamburger mixture.  I definately want to try that next time.

Family loved it! I did make some changes. I didn't have crescent rolls so I used a recipe for pizza dough and it worked fine. I also didn't have mozzarella cheese so I used 2 slices of Swiss cut up instead. I also added a small bit of cheddar cheese. In the sour cream cheese mixture I added a little pasta sauce so it spread better.  To the beef mix I added a can of diced Italian tomatoes along with cumin and garlic. Finally to top it off I brushed butter on top with some cheddar and set it on broil till it was nice and crispy. Definitely making this again!

I found the crescent rolls really rich, especially with the sour cream and cheese mixture.  My cousin loved it though, he ate about 3 helpings for dinner.  A good quick dinner, which may not be a keeper!

I read the reviews before I made this and added Italian seasoning and half a pound of sausage for flavor. I also added a cup or so of cooked small shells pasta and raised the pasta sauce to 1 1/2 cups. My family thoroughly enjoyed!

OMG this is delicious.....and sooo easy! I used a square baking pan because I don't have a circular one, but that didn't matter. This smells amazing while it's baking, and tastes just as good the next day! I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

This was great. I read the recipe wrong and put in a jar of tomato pasta sauce instead of a cup, but everyone raved about it and said for me to make it again. When I told them what I'd done, they said so, the more sauce the better!!! Will make again.

My husband loved this!  Will be making it on a regular basis.  I made a few small changes - I added onion, garlic and Italian spices to the ground beef while cooking and then additional Italian spice to the casserole with the sauce, just because we like the added spice.  It was so quick and easy, a great, hearty weeknight meal.

Very easy to make, and tasted great! I made this tonight for pretty much a no-brainer weeknight meal. It took just a few minutes to brown up the meat and onions, and then put it in the pie plate to bake. The taste of the sour cream with the cheese was wonderful - added a nice, gooeyness to the dish. Yum! The tomato sauce that I used was pretty watery after this baked, but that was my own fault, and I will try a different sauce next time. Both my husband and I liked this, as did my 7 year old, but my almost 4 year old and two year old were not too thrilled. I'm sure I will make this again though, and see if they like it any better.

I always add diced zucchini, squash, and red bell pepper to this dish since I think it needs veggies.  I usually switch up the spices I add, but Italian seasoning and garlic powder with some crushed red pepper make a great addition.  I also add less sour cream and more shredded cheese then called for, the extra sour cream makes the result too soupy.  After doctoring it up it's a great recipe!

Used ground turkey instead of beef!  Family LOVED it!!  Putting this in the weekly rotation!
