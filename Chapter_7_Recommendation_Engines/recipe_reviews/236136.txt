Very good in the end, but I had to play with this a bit.  First, for me this needed garlic and fresh herbs (and a good glug of red wine).  Second, I found additional broth preferable to the water called for.  I also chose to use baby spinach rather than kale.  Finally, the potatoes need only about 15 minutes to cook thoroughly, not a total of 37 (!), while the pasta needs a good 10 minutes to cook, not a mere five (!), so I adjusted the cooking time accordingly.  As this recipe's first reviewer I'm pleased to report that overall, this was very good.  I had planned to serve this with salad and bread, but found both unnecessary as the soup on its own was very hearty and satisfying.

This is seriously one of the best meals I've ever tasted! Will be in heavy rotation all year round and am sharing the recipe with all of my friends & family. Kale didn't look fresh at the store when shopping for ingredients so it was excluded this time; will add it next. Also, I stirred in some leftover vegan "ricotta" from a different recipe and it made this soup out of this world!

This is really tasty.  The only thing I would do differently is add the zucchini with the pasta, so it doesn't cook too long.  I personally prefer it with a little snap.

I absolutely love this recipe. I made a few changes  based on others suggestions and my own taste. Added garlic and fresh basil, swapped frozen spinach for kale...and a splash of red wine. My husband and I loved it!
