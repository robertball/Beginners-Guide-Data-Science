Soo Bloody GREAT! This was a  Brilliant recipe. I followed the recipe  to a T, added nothing, left nothing out, & this was fast, tasty, & better than any  restaurant. .  Me boyfriend LOVED it. For 2019 me New Years resolution I made, was to make, a new recipe, a  totally new recipe every month. This was mine for January.   I had to make a NEW batch immediately, after me boyfriend ate the 1st batch, The cracker I used was  BIG Taco  Chips from Ortega. . Worked like a charm. I split them in 1/2, then  put this Tartare on each 1/2 . The taste really worked. Thank you, soo bloody much for a wonderful start to 2019. Cheers & GOD Bless. From N.V. living in  Manhattan New York City, & Happy New Years.
