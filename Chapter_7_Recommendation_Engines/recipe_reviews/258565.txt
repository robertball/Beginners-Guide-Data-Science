This was excellent! So good in fact that my guests devoured it before realizing that I wanted to take a picture of it. That's okay though because  I only got the scraps so I plan on making it again. I agree with the other reviewer and the Sriracha is a must. If you are wanting to impress your company, make this! This one is a keeper and 5 stars all the way!

This was really good! The flakiness of the puff pastry, the crispy corned beef hash and the bite of the Swiss cheese marry perfectly with an egg cooked on top that melts its yolk over the entire concoction to help bring everything together. The sriracha sauce is a must on this dish! It is an eggs best friend and shouldn't be skipped. Try this one out for your Sunday brunch, you won't regret it.

I made this for a family get together and put it down on the table and watched it disappear like a magic trick!
I will make it again but I will make triple what I did and I will also set aside some for myself!
