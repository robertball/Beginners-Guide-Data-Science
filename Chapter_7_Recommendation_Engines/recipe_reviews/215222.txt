I made this for the Recipe Group.  We liked this, but thought it needed to be jazzed up.  I added a red jalapeno from the garden instead of the pickled jalapeno nacho slices, but because I seeded my jalapeno it didn’t contribute much heat.  I also added some green onion, including the green tops to add a little more color to this.  I made 1/4 of this recipe (for just the two of us) using 1/2 can of black beans (froze the rest which works really well), Pace chunky salsa, and frozen corn, rather than the Goya products.  I served this with Mexican Grilled Chicken (also from this site) which went well with this salsa.

Only difference was 1 can reduced sodium black beans, 2 cans drained RoTel w/green chilies, sliced jalapeno peppers, hot mexican chili powder, 1tsp dried cilantro, sliced green onions and a few squirts of lime juice.  Did not use Goya products.  Definitely has a kick!

I made this for Recipe  Group.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I did not use Goya products because my grocery doesn't carry them.  I liked it so much that I made it my entire dinner!  I omitted the jalapeno nacho slices because I knew it would be too hot for me if I added them.  My husband, on the other hand, added a jalapeno ring to every bite!  I served this with Baked Tostado Scoops.  The salsa filled each little cup for a perfect bite of deliciousness.

This was delicious! I think next time I'll add some lime juice. This would also be great in a tortilla as a healthy wrap.

Made this for Recipe Group and we really enjoyed it, though I knew we would because I make something similar to this that we just love! I made tacos for dinner last night and thought this would go well...it did! I halved the recipe and was not able to use Goya products, but made it exactly otherwise, also using the jalapeno slices. I would definately make this again, maybe adding a little lemon or lime juice next time! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this for Recipe Group 9/10/10.  I started with dried black beans and fresh corn, so my measurements weren't exact, but I tried to keep it proportional.  I had never used pickled jalapeno before and wasn't sure what to expect.  After refrigerating overnight to blend the flavors this was quite tasty, but hard to eat as a dip.  It will, however make good filling for tacos and it would be good over rice.

The longer this sits, the better the taste comes together. My boyfriend really enjoyed it with tortilla chips. I added in diced jalapenos instead of the slices and wish I would've added more. Really good though!

This recipe has entirely too much cumin in it.  I will make my own recipe next time, with less spice and some fresh tomatoes instead.  The pico de gallo is fine if you don't have fresh, but I prefer a fresh salsa recipe to this one.

The taste was phenomenal, better than I expected. I did add some sweet red and orange peppers along with some onions for crunch and color. I will be making this again.

I liked this recipe but felt it was missing something taste wise and was just boring with Tostitoes. I baked a tortilla shell in the oven at 350 for 8 minutes or until it was a little brown and crispy then topped the tortilla with homemade plain hummus. I then layered the black bean salsa on top and cut into four pieces like a pizza and it was delish!!!

I made this *almost* according to the recipe. I used fresh tomatoes & jalapeños instead of canned. It was great & gone in minutes!  I made a 2nd batch for the Super Bowl tomorrow and added my own twist on this recipe. I diced yellow, red, green & orange bell peppers & a small white onion and to give it an extra kick a cubed an 8oz brick of pepper jack cheese. So far getting a ?? from the taste testers!!  Great recipe & a great one to make your own based on preferences!

I thought it was very good, though I made some changes.  I only made a half batch, which was plenty.  I used fresh tomatoes, though would probably opt for the ease of canned next time.  I omitted the green onions and the bell pepper; the half red onion I used was still a bit overpowering, so next time I would use less.  I skipped the avocado because I didn't think it would hold up well; I made this the night before so the flavors could blend and I though the avocado would turn brown and mushy.  I also added cumin and pepper.  It looked beautiful and had a nice kick.  I served it with baked chips; a much healthier alternative to cookies and other party goodies.

I couldn’t find Goya Salsa Pico de Gallo at my market so I improvised and it still came out wonderful.  I also made it a few hours in advance so the flavor has a chance to meld and develop.  Served with tortilla chips, this makes a delicious snack.

This is a nice easy to throw together snack/appetizer.  I didn't have Pico de Gallo, so I subbed prepared salsa. I agree that the cumin could use toned down a notch, but that should be done according to your personal preference.  I'm not a canned corn fan, so I used frozen instead.  THANKS, GOYA!

I really liked this. I was surprised, because I have not been a fan of other corn and bean salsas. I made 1/2 recipe and followed everything except I also made 1/2 recipe of Allrecipe's "Ex-Girlfriend's Mom's Salsa Fresco (Pico de Gallo)," and used all of that in place of the container of pico de gallo. I had the ingredients to use up anyhow. For the corn I defrosted some frozen corn in the microwave for a minute and measured it using the bean can to get 1/2 can. Lastly, I left out the jalepenos, as I just don't care for the added heat. I could eat this with chips or a spoon. I definitely recommend homemade pico de gallo, if you have the time. The two together made this perfectly seasoned.
