The peppers and onions were too crunchy in the cooked burger. I'd pop them in the micro for a minute before combining them with the meat mixture.

This was a great, easy, and quick recipe for a burger. It reminds me of a specialty burger you would find in a TGIF or Applebees. I added a tomato, and subbed American cheese for my kids. Thanks so much for posting this delicious recipe. Next time I plan on trying the Southwest Roasted Corn Salad. ;)

Very good! Added Worcestershire, garlic, salt and pepper to mix. Used Red Bell Peppers since we don't care for green. Also skipped the salsa since we don't like much heat. Made the two-year-old's with American cheese---he didn't care for them.   Hubby and I enjoyed them very much though.  We served them with nacho chips and canned  cheese sauce. Yummy!

This was a good burger.  It had great flavor, and was a good change from the standard.  I thiught that it was a bit dry so next time I will put the salsa in the meat instead of on top.  I added a clove pf garlic to the mix and a frw splashes of worcestershire sauce.

This recipe was okay but I found the burgers very dry and the taco season really overpowered them.  If I were to make again, I might subsitute green onions for regular onions and use less seasoning, it was just too strong.  Not sure it's a repeat though.

This recipe was really flavorful and different from ordinary burgers. I substituted regular onions with green onions, and added a 2 little cloves of minced garlic; it turned out great. Thanks for sharing :)

LOVED these!  I served it with the Southwest roasted corn salad, YUM!  
We put jalapenos on the burgers too.  I used regular jack cheese for the kids, pepperjack is too spicy

My husband I LOVED these.  We love to grill.  So, I have been making these for the past 3 years now.  It's a nice change from your ordinary burger.  If you like tacos, you will love these burgers.  My only recommendation would be to chop up the peppers and onions really fine otherwise your burger may fall apart.  Either that or use less green pepper as I tend to do sometimes.

These are great! We had them at one of our tailgates and everyone raved about them! They grilled up real nice, didn't crumble and fall apart. They were really moist too. Perfect! Since then, my husband and I have had them at home several times. They have become a favorite of ours. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

We loved these. The only thing I did differently is that I didn't have pepperjack so I used a shredded mexiblend cheese and I also added lettuce. These were perfect and I wouldn't change a thing. I look forward to trying this with pepperjack as called for.

Pretty good. I'd chop up the green peppers and onions finer next time, they made the burgers crumble some. Good flavor though, nice twist on ordinary burgers.

These hamburgers were very moist and they tasted fine, but I was disappointed that they were as mild in flavor as they were.

A nice alternative to your run-of-the-mill burger.  I used lean, green, grass-fed beef.  The spices complimented the flavor of the natural beef.  I loved the idea of topping my burger with the sour cream and salsa.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe just as written, except I didn't have access to my grill, so I cooked on the stove.
I really had my doubts, but was looking for a good burger recipe; well I found it.   These guys were amazing!!  My husband and I both loved them!! They taste like a taco, but eat like a burger.  Great for a change of pace.

This was fantastic! The only thing I did different was top with avacodo and lettuce along with the sour cream and salsa. My husband ate two of them, and on the second one I used a large scoop of avacodo, which he said helped cut down on the strong taco flavor. This would also be good if you add black beans to the mixture!

We don't eat spicy foods so I swapped the pepperjack for Mexican four cheese. This is a tasty way to change up your boring old burger.

My wife and I have very different tastes, I felt it need more flavor maybe even a bit more heat.  My wife thought the taco flavors where a little strong.  What it boiled down two neither one of us really liked them much for different reasons.
