Oh boy were these cookies a hit! I generally do not alter recipes-however I did add a little cinnamon to my cookie dough. Amazing!

My friends really enjoy these.  They are so easy to make and easy to roll. The coffee really adds to the chocolate taste. You can add chips or nuts. Fun to experiment !  Make them soon. I used decafe coffee granules in case I am tempted to eat later at night. The cocoa alone has lots of caffeine !  Worth it!

These cookies are very good. If you feel that the batter is too sticky, you can put it in the fridge for a few minutes and you should have no trouble making the balls. Next time I make this, I might add walnuts. Bake them no more than 10 minutes long and you will have a slightly crunchy cookie on the outside with a chewy inside. Will definitely make them again. Update: I made this recipe again and decided to add about 1/2 cup of black walnuts bits and pieces....OMG! These are out of this world in deliciousness!!!
