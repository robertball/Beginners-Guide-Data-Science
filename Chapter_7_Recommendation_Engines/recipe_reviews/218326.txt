Amazing and for those who complain about the spiciness of this recipe, cayenne and ancho chiles are hot and this is well known so just don't add them or minimize the amount. You can even substitute your favorite taco seasoning for the seasonings in the recipe to avoid it being too spicy. It seems very rude to give a low rating because you don't comprehend the heat index of specific peppers you are working with.

These tacos were AMAZING! Typically, I use recipes with not only more stars but with more reviews, so I felt compelled to write a review voting for this meal! I added half a fresh jalapeno, which gave it a nice kick, but would have been too spicy for children. When all the taco shells were gone, my husband and I used the remainder of the meat to make supreme nachos! Was definitely a great dish & will definitely be used again in our household!

So deliciously yummy! Loved this. I couldn't find ancho chili to save my life, so I used ground chipotle instead. Only thing I can say is that I found this amount of caynne and chipotle pepper to be too much as a base. I loved it but it was too much for my kids and they like spice. Next time, I will halve the peppers.

I made this when I had a group of people eating and I didn't know when they would all show up. People loved it.  I could not find tri tip so I used another less expensive cut of beef. I suspect you could use most any beef. There was way too much liquid for tacos so about an hour before people showed up I drained  off most on the liquid into a sauce pot of and reduced in on the stove top. When it had cooked down to a pretty think mix  I returned it to the beef and let it all cook on. The sauce is wonderful and it seems a shame not to concentrate the flavors. This was great for a casual party.

I could tell this would be spicy so I halved each of the peppers, but even with that modification, 2 bites in and I felt like I was gonna choke.  It was almost like someone took a Q-tip and swabbed the back of my throat with cayenne.  I admit I'm not a big fan of spicy dishes (I like bold flavor, not super spice), but I honestly thought with my modifications it would turn out okay.  I don't know how anyone could eat this dish with full amount of peppers.  The one star is for the fact that it is simple to make.

This is wonderful.  Easy, kid friendly for my kids if I leave out the peppers.    My family doesn't like saucy meat such as BBQ beef etc. so this worked out well.
With the leftovers I made a machaca & scrambled egg type dish the next morning.  I liked that just as much as the original dinner.

Turned out great! Used leftover meat AND sauce to make delicious enchiladas the next night! The sauce tastes almost like the La Victoria stuff I normally use with enchiladas (Medium red sauce). I add a bit of chocolate powder (Nesquik or in a pinch hot chocolate mix pkg) to make it less spicy...yum!

I was excited to try this, but was very disappointed.  First, I cut the spices in half (having read the reviews).  My husband and I love hot and spicy foods, but my kids do not.  Even with the spices halved, this meat was spicy and the sauce FAR TOO spicy to use in any way.  Secondly, there is too much sauce.  If I were to make this again, I would cut the tomatoes and wine in half, too.  Finally, my roast was not tender after 6 hours.  This very well could be that I had a tough tri-tip, but it was very disappointing.  I will try to salvage the leftovers in a soup/chili of some kind (with the meat only....I'll have to toss the incredibly hot sauce).

The flavor was wonderful and the meat was so tender I just pushed on it and it fell apart. I didn't have white wine so I used merlot which makes more sense. It is beef after all. Delicious!

This is AMAZING! I have tried a few other similar recipes, but this one far outshines. I am all for simple so I made a few changes using what I already had on hand in my cupboards. I did the rub with Costco's steak rub (because it is so peppery) and garlic, browned the meat, in the Crockpot I put the roast, tomato's and wine. I dumped in a small handful of dehydrated onions and peppers, a few dashes of hot sauce and then let it simmer. YUMMY! Most def. a keeper. So easy, thanks!

I simply did not like this.  There was way too much sauce and way too much wine.  I will not waste a wonderful tri tip steak like this ever again.

Seriously awesome!  I didn't have any white wine, so I substituted the same amount of Sake.  Home canned tomatoes instead of store bought.  Didn't have any ancho chili powder so I used a Chipotle flavor mix and threw about 3 T. of dehydrated jalapenos.  Simply wonderful AND super easy!

This was great.  I couldn't find ground ancho chile peppers in the spice aisle, so I ground up the dried ancho chiles in a coffee (spice) grinder.  The heat was perfect.  Both kids ate seconds.  The left overs were spicier the next day.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have cayenne pepper or ancho chili pepper so I substituted some chili limon stuff. And I would use 1/2 as much wine and crushed tomatoes. If u want you can add ortega chilis or something sililar for an extra kick.

Made this last night and it was SO good!  I read the reviews about spiciness and knowing my kids don't like spicy, I substituted the ancho chili and cayenne for taco seasoning.  So, so yummy - it was a hit with all 3 boys and husband - a tough feat.

Great flavor but did make some changes so it wouldn't be too spicy for my kids..  Seared meat then rubbed with a package of taco seasoning mix.  Used 1- 10oz can of Rotel cilantro lime tomatoes & 1 - 4.5oz can chopped green chiles.  Also used 1/2 the amount of white wine.  Made more than enough liquid.  This will become a regular!

Delicious!  I was worried that it would be too stringy, but it actually turned out great.  I used two 4 oz. cans of mild diced green chiles and half of the called for cayenne pepper so that my kids could eat it.  It was great, lots of good flavor without being too spicy for them.

Tastiest tri-tip tacos I've had in a long time. I substituted the white wine with about 12 ounces of Dos Equis beer, only used one onion, added a 4 ounce can of green chilies, skipped the  cilantro (didn't have any), and used Costco Montreal Steak Seasoning and some Kroger Garlic Powder instead of the garlic seasoning recommended. LOVED IT. This recipe is going in the weekly line-up.

This was very good! I could tell the recipe is spicy so I cut way back on the cayenne pepper. I also modified the recipe by using fresh tomatoes and jalapeno, and I cooked it in a dutch oven at 300 degrees for about 4 hours The white wine was a nice touch.  Very easy and tasty.

Perfect and easy. I make a lot and freeze for later use. Good for taco,enchiladas, chimichangas... I don't use the ancho and add my cayenne toward the end , as the slow cooker intensifies heat. I also add a spoonful of purebred chili in Adobe sauce.

Great recipe! Though instead of all the beef I only added half and the rest was chorizo.  I also added one green pepper and fresh tomatoes rather than canned. Came out perfect! Thank you for the great taco recipe! :)

Delicious and easy to make We. drained the excess liquid. We used this in tacos for dinner and then made yummy breakfast burritos with eggs, potatoes and cheese added to the meat. Definitely a keeper. I agree that people shouldn't give it a low rating because they don't understand the spices they are working with.

One of my favorites!!! We make this for camping every year and also to take on the boat. So easy to reheat! Of course we have all the typical sides for the tacos. I do cut all the peppers in half and do a bit more chili pepper than cayenne for flavor. (Just because my children and I cannot do very spicy!) I also rub the roast generously (with about 1/2 the container of mccormick roasted red pepper and garlic spice.

Way too much sauce, was quite thin & runny.  I reduced it on stove as suggested by other reviewer, but that completely killed the heat, and it turned out rather bland tasting.  May give it another shot with about 1/2 - 2/3 wine & tomatoes.  Was quite spicy before I reduced it.

I couldn’t find tri tip so I used chuck roast and replaced hot chilies with green chilies. We had a taco bar for New Years and there wasn’t any left. I will definitely make this again!

First time using a slow cooker. Sort of combined two recipes so I added in a package of frozen corn, 1 red bell pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper, and 4 jalapeños since I didn't have any ancho. Also, I used dry vermouth instead of white wine since that was what I had.... came our amazing... only thing I didn't like was that when u shred the Tri tip it shreds long ways so you have strands of beef almost a foot long. Maybe I'll try cutting the Tri tip in half before cooking it next time

This is amazing.  My daughter made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it! I made it once since and am about to make it again.  It comes out perfectly tender and moist with just the right level of spice.  Good for tacos, burritos or sandwiches...even over rice.

Pretty tasty, could be pretty spicy for some. We added cheddar and fresh tomatoes to the finished beef and put on top of a pair of corn tortillas. It passed the hungry husband test too!

Amazing! I did a few different things tho...I used carne asada seasoning Fromm the Mexican market. Then used chipotle powder. ??also after sautéing the onions and garlic seasoning mixture I deglazed the pot with light beer and poured it over the tri tip. I didn't add the tomatoes- we prefer fresh on tacos as apposed to stewed in the meat.  I use beer in all my  Mexican dishes when it calls  for broth or wine or any liquid.  Seems fitting ??!  Will make again and again!!!!!! Thanks for this recipe idea!

I used  just over 1/4 of the pepper spices and it was still at my max! I quickly pulled some meat to the side out (prior to shredding) so my teenage son could have something for dinner too. Additionally I also made some plain rice to serve this over instead to cut the heat. Guess I'll use the tortillas I bought for this another night.  WARNING: season to taste - SPICY!!!!!!!

Great Recipe, my wife loved it and wants to use the sauce on pasta. I will give it a try and see how it works out. There were so many flavors and I love slow cooker recipes.

This was so yummy!!! We had lots of leftovers too so it really stretched this meal! It was a tad spicy, but I loved that! I didn't have any onions so I had to use dry but it was still delicious!
