Wow! This was so good I couldn't stop eating it! I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! Maybe next time, I'll use light cream instead of heavy cream to lower the fat content. I wouldn't change anything else! Update: I tried it with light cream and it just didn't have the same thick texture needed for this recipe. That's ok - it's definitely worth the calories!

I made this for a family reunion and everyone liked it.  I didn't add the coconut because my family doesn't like it but I think it would be good because it lacked the sweetness from the coconut.  I will make again but will add more pineapple for a sweeter flavor.

YUMMY!!!!!!!!!
I made this for 4th of July and it was sooooo good. We didn't have any leftovers. I made it again about two weeks later because I liked it so much and it's a great desert for hot summer nights. The second time I added in some chopped walnuts and it added a great crunch and texture.

This was delicious! But I did add more powdered sugar, you can adjust to how sweet you want it. You can get really creative with this recipe and add whatever fruit you want. I've already made it twice, the first time, exactly how recipe is except more powdered sugar, the second time with just strawberries and bananas and of course the marshmallows.Definately A keeper!!

This is very good but boy it makes a lot. Better have a crowd around for it. I served it at a July 4th barbeque for 17 people and we're still eating it.

This ambrosia wasn't quite sweet enough for my tastes. I added more marshmallows, and it really did the trick.

Loved this recipe.  Left out the coconut and increased the sugar, and added toasted pecans as others have recommended.  "sauce" tasted a bit like sour cream out of the bowl, but after the dish mellowed it was perfect..and I think the sour cream made the cream stable (even the next day it wasn't watery).

This isn't the type of dessert I typically eat, but it tasted alright to me and I got lots of compliments at the picnic I took it to for how great it was.  I didn't have much left over.  It is pretty costly to make compared to other items, though.

I made this for the 4th and it was perfect!  I did leave out the coconut, my little one wouldn't have eaten it.  Perfect combination of sweet/tart/sour.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last year for 4th of July for a large crowd and everyone loved it>>> and now I have been requested to make it again.  The cream mixture is too much for the amount of fruit - I added 2 cans of mandarin oranges, more marshmallows and toasted chopped pecans.  (or next time maybe just cut the cream mixture in half?)  For 14 people I could have easily cut the whole recipe in half the way I prepared it, but the leftovers held up really well and were wonderful.

Soooo good. I only made it because my boyfriend LOVES ambrosia - I'd never even had it! But it turned out so well I keep making it again and again for no reason at all! Instead of just the strawberries and blueberries, though, I add whatever I have around the house. No watermelon because there's just too much liquid there, but it's great with small cantelope balls, frozen blueberries, fresh chunked peaches or anything!

Very good! The fruit is what brings out the sweetness in this dessert. My strawberries were not quite ripe so this actually tasted better the second day once they ripened. I think chopped pecans will be a nice addition - will try that next time.

A summer favorite from now on! A few modifications: I only added the cream, sugar, sour cream, pineapples together and refrigerated for 4 hours. When it was time to eat, I spooned some ambrosia and pushed in some marshmallows. We went black raspberry picking today so I added those around a big blob of ambrosia. Then I topped with some strawberry slices and blueberries. I heated the coconut flakes on ths stove for a few minutes to bring out a toasted coconut taste. Last but not least, I sprinkled some turbinado sugar for looks.

This was heavenly! Made it exactly as shared. Typically, I change up recipes a little because either I don't have specific ingredients or don't care for some. For this one, I bought the named ingredients so there was no excuse. Dee-lish! Made it for a 4th of July party and it went over well. I'd like to try it a tad sweeter, so next time will leave out some of the sour cream and add more powdered sugar. I will also taste some of my blueberries before piling them in -- some of mine were a little tart.

Ambrosia should be sweet. This was not! Would need to add more sugar if I made it again. Which leaves me questioning all the sour cream in the first place.

This was very refreshing and good. My grandchildren have some special dietary needs and can't eat all canned fruit, and sugar only on special occasions. I made this because it had lots of fresh fruit and used real whipped cream. They loved it and so did I.

I have this recipe saved because my family loves it so much! We don't change the recipe often unless there is a request for more coconut. We have learned to make sure the fruit is sweet before folding it in. I also make this for Christmas and add 2 drops of green food coloring. The red and green are festive and it tops off pound cake beautifully.

I made this recipe exactly as is and it turned out fabulous.  Brought it to a 4th of July barbeque and it didn't last 1 hour!!!!  Next time I might add a bit more strawberries and blueberries.  But otherwise, got so many compliments on this.  Thank you for the recipe.
