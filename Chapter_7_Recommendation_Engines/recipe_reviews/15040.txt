I was disappointed in this recipe the first time I prepared it. Last night I made it for the second time, and it turned out wonderfully! I added some salt to the recipe, extra mushrooms, some diced canned tomatoes, and a TON of chopped spinach -- I served it to friends, who immediately asked for the recipe, including my variations to it!

I did as the previous reviewer suggested and added the following:  Lots of extra virgin olive oil, about 1 pound of mushrooms, lots of garlic, 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, salt, 2 8 oz. cans of tomato sauce and 1 can diced tomatoes with onion & garlic.  Add spinach second to last and beans very last.  This made a large amount and was even very good warmed up the second time around!

Four Stars but you have to modify the hearty basic recipe if you want robust flavor, too. 

I read a few reviews and made my version (this rendition, at least) by adding diced tomatoes, shredded red cabbage, pre-cooked pasta (left over linguini cut to 1 to 2 inch lengths), chopped hot peppers and replaced vegetable broth for water.

Next time, I am going to use frozen cut okra and rice.

After that maybe I'll add canned black beans (drained and rinsed) and extra cayenne for a south-of-the-border version.

This recipe is excellent if you use 3 cups of water with 3 (Maggi)vegetable bouillon cubes instead of plain water as the recipe calls for.  I also added 1 pkg of frozen spinach & about 6 to 7 cloves of garlic instead of just 1.  I also used 1 1/2 cans of tomato sauce.  These changes give it wonderful flavor.

It was easy to make  and delicious. I only gave it 4 stars because I made some alterations to the recipe. I used vegetable broth instead of water, more garlic and tomato sauce

I have not tried this recipe as is but it gave me lots of inspiration to add to it! It came out as more of a stew than a soup but still great! I used one whole yellow onion, four cloves of garlic, one and a half bell peppers, and 1/2 cup of oil to saut√©. Then I added one can of chickpeas, one can of tomato sauce, one can of corn and one 32 oz package of veggie broth. About 12 mins through simmering, I added one package of medium firm tofu cubed up. I also added all purpose seasoning and cayenne pepper to taste. And then I added one bunch of fresh cilantro leaves at the very end. It was amazing!!!!! :D

This was very tasty, and quick and easy to make.  For me personally,  I prefer thicker soups.  We really enjoyed the flavor, butIi think next time I will probably puree some of the veggies and chickpeas to thicken it just a bit.

I'm new at this. Very easy recipe. It was excellent, delicious, amazing. Best soup of the 4-5 I've made in the past month. Instead of 4 cups water, I used 2.25 cups of fat free chix broth, 1 cup of water, instead of parsley I used cilantro, I did not use red pepper, used 0.5 of a bell pepper and 0.5 of an onion.

I was generous with the olive oil, didn't have a green pepper so I added more mushrooms, amped up the herbs.. it needed it.  Also, use any kind of broth instead of water, no tomato sauce in the house..I added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.. simmer for 1/2 hour.. for a finale I squeezed some lemon juice in.. gave it an incredible tang and north african flare!  YUM.

I followed some of the suggestions I read... I added tomato sauce, more mushrooms, and lots of spinach.  Plus I then ended up adding some pasta.  To be honest, I felt that where I ended up was completely diferent than the original poster's recipe.  It was good though!
