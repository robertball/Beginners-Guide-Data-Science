I liked this recipe...I had something very specific in mind so I made a few modifications :)

I was making it with my five-year-old bundle of joy so we made some kid friendly changes, and I was looking for a replication of a peanutty pumpkin soup I'd had years ago.

I started with dried minced onions and jarred minced garlic, added the broth, and then a can of pumpkin puree.  We let that get all happy, then added WAY more peanut butter than the recipe called for...more like 1/2 a cup.  We omitted the red pepper flakes but did add some tabasco.  We also used evaporated milk in place of the cream, and topped them with home made croutons...we cubed up some whole wheat bread, sprinkled on some olive oil, cinnamon, and sugar, and toasted them in the oven for a little bit.

YUMMY!

This recipe was so fun to make. I tried it once by the book, and once substituting in half and half and veggie broth and both times it came out great. When I make this for kids I cut back on the onion and blend this on high for a super cramy texture. They love the peanut butter! five stars!

I followed instructions exactly and soup came out far too thin.

Something is not quite right with this soup, which resembles another recipe I prefer for Squash Soup.  It could be my fault, for using organic low sodium chicken broth, because it needed some salt to offset the sweetness.  I have never added salt to a recipe from this website.  I also felt that it could have done without the nutmeg.

Very good soup.  Followed other recommendations and reduced broth to 2 cups, increased cream to 1 can evaporated milk, and doubled peanut butter to 2 tbsp.  Also switched a can of pumpkin for 2 1/2 pounds listed.

I loved this soup! I had my own pumpkin puree on hand and scaled this recipe down for just 5 people. I used 2 cups of pumpkin puree, 3 cups of boiling water and 4 bullion cubes in place of chicken broth and replaced the nutmeg with allspice (my own preference). Use as much peanut butter as you like. This recipe lends itself well to improvisation. I whipped this up in about 15 minutes for a delicious rainy-day soup. Talk about comfort!

I think this was a great main dish, but I could tell that the 10 cups pf chicken broth was going to turn the results into a super thin soup. I subbed for 6 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of half and half. Delish, but will try next time with heavy cream and canned pumpkin (peeling two pumpkins was exhausting!)

Good but used 3 large garlic cloves, red onion and canned pumpkin. 1 teas. curry powder, 8 cups of chicken broth (was low sodium so added sea salt to taste), 3 tbl. peanut butter, 1 can evaporated milk and some chili paste for red pepper flakes and pepper. Just right!

I loved this recipe. Although,  I would use pumpkin from a can, it's considerably easier . I peeled, seeded and cubed two small pumpkins. So much  work, it was worth it, but will not do it in the future. 

I also put in a jalapeno and mushrooms, extra curry, extra cayenne pepper (instead of red flakes), milk (instead of cream because I didn't have any) and crunchy peanut butter.  I only used two cups of broth, ten cups is entirely too much. The cream adds enough fluid as well. 

I probably would not puree it so smoothly, but more  chunky instead.  This soup was delicious and lived up to its expectations and will make it again.  A fantastic Autumn soup.

Followed this recipe precisely and love the spicy rich flavor. The thin consistency was lovely as is. The pumpkin I bought weighed about five pounds at the grocery store and was just slightly more two and a half pounds when I had it cubed and ready.  I served with and without cilantro.  Being a huge fan of cilantro, I somehow preferred it without it. I'll make this again and again.

We do not recommend this recipe. The proportions are incorrect as it is a very thin broth, not a creamy squash type of soup. Try a different recipe.
