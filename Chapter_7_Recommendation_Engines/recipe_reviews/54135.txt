This was the best seafood pasta we've had in a long time!  I did add a few things like fresh diced tomatoes and mushrooms as someone else had posted.  I also used a shallot along with the green onions, added extra garlic and thickened sauce with cornstarch.  I will never buy store-bought alfredo sauce again.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

MMM, I really liked this recipe. I added Fresh chopped clams, tomatoes, and Portabella mushrooms. I also added a bit more Garlic, and used the corn starch. I Like my sause a bit thicker. I don't think you need quite a table spoon though. I will use a bit less next time, you can add some more if you still think it is to thin. I can't wait to have this recipe again, and the wife was in heaven with it. Goes great with some Garlic bread, and ceaser Salad. MMM A+++++

Delicious.  Used 5 Tbsp butter, heavy cream in lieu of half-and-half, added snapper pieces and sea scallops with the green onion, added shrimp a couple minutes later.  Steamed mussels on the side in wine and garlic, and added them on top of the finished dish.

This is the perfect "basic" sauce to build upon. Since moving west from New England, I've been on a quest for culinary zest. I added the following ingredients, giving the dish a bigger personality and a good kick: white wine, sauteed onions, chopped and seeded tomato, crushed red pepper, garlic pepper, fresh chopped basil and spicy oregano from my garden.  Hoo Hah! It was a big hit.

OH MY GOSH!!!!! This was outstanding.  The only things we changed per other reviewers was a 1/2 cup wine, and some sliced mushrooms with the onions and garlic (maybe one or two more cloves of garlic) everything else the same soooooooooooo good thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This was pretty good, but it required quite of bit of salt to pull out the flavor.  The sauce was very thin, like pouring milk over cereal.  After re-reading, I see there is a footnote that says to add cornstarch to thicken.   If I had it to do over, I would just use cream instead of half â€˜n half and not worry about the sauce being too thick or thin.  Plus, cream provides a much richer flavor.

I used the same amount of sauce for a serving of 4, and used shrimp only. This is an excellent recipe, and so fast and easy.

This recipe needed a bit more zing..I added a few seasonings to spice it up.  I also halfed the amount of seafood, adding only half pounds of each and I thought the amout was just fine.  Very easy and delicious!

This is an excellent base to work from. I made several changes, and we fought over leftovers the next 2 days. I added mushrooms, green pepper, 1/2 cup white wine and a squirt of fresh lemon juice. I reserved liquid from thawing sea scallops and added this, which I reduced before adding heavy cream.  We had a lot of seafood, so the extra liquid was fine. I used the cornstarch. Perfect thickness for such a rich sauce.  Served over penne pasta with Caesar salads, fresh green beans and garlic Parmesan toast rounds.
Tempting to gorge, but the richness calls for restraint...which leads to leftovers! Reheated without needing to add liquids.

Wow, this made me feel like a real cook!!  I looked over the ratings and changed the following:  heavy cream instead of 1/2 and 1/2.  I first sauteed red onion, green onions, mushrooms and garlic.  I then added the shrimp and scallops, then the rest.  I had the big sea scallops, so they took longer to cook, but it turned out DELICIOUS!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made according to the recipe and cooking on medium low took forever for my sauce to get thick.  When I turned up the heat to medium or little above it finally got thick.  My family and 2 dinner guest liked it.  We had leftovers after feeding 7 with salads and bread.  Good recipe.

I am not very good in the kitchen and tend to follow recipes to a tee.  But based on all of the reviews to this recipe, I followed it somewhat and incorporated things into it like tomatoes for color, basil and Old Bay for some extra flavor and it turned out fantastic.  This was the first time we opted not to do turkey for Thanksgiving and I am so proud of myself for pulling it off.  Thank you!!!

Very good start for this recipe.  I used a little more butter spread and substituted the scallops for a 16 oz can of crab.  I also used precooked shrimp to save time.  I did have to add the cornstarch to thicken, but still very tasty and gave me a fix without ALL the calories that come with normal alfredo!  Very good flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

This is an awesome, restaurant quality recipe! I added a tad bit more butter, 3 garlic cloves instead of 2, Baby Bella mushrooms and I used heavy whipping cream instead of half-n-half.

I didn't have green onions so I used shallots.  I also substituted grilled salmon for the scallops.  I used only 1 tbsp of cornstarch.  At the end, I also sprinkled with Old Bay seafood seasoning.  Excellent dinner!

This was yummy!  I made it according the the recipe the first time.  I would probably halve the pasta next time... I felt like there wasn't much seafood or sauce compared to the whole box of pasta.  And will probably spruce up with a few things.  But overall, very good!

Another great addition to my recipe box.  I used 1% milk instead of the half and half.  Shrimp and pollack, extra garlic, red onion instead of green - fantastic.

This was pretty good but next time I will add some Blackening seasoning and also will season the shrimp to our taste then grill them; will season the scallops and pan sear them.  I just thought the seafood needed more flavor also by grilling and pan searing I feel the presentation will be more impacting.

I followed the recipe exactly and I haved to say, I am disappointed. It was very bland and even with the 2 tbsp cornstarch it just doesn't get creamy at all. I won't make it again.

Instead of 2 cups of half and half, I used 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of butter.  Instead of 1 cup of onions, I use 1/4 cup of shallots. I used snow crab instead of scallops, this time around, but either work well.  At the end I add the zest of 1 lemon and the juice as well.  If you let the warm pasta sit in the sauce (without the seafood) for about 10 minutes, the pasta will soak it up and make it creamy.

This was a huge hit at our house a few weeks ago. I'm making it again today as our daughter is home from college.  I doubled the recipe and used chicken and shrimp.  Everyone loved it!

I am going to use this recipe to make the sauce and add the scallops, zucchini, and tomatoes from another recipe.  Can't wait to try!  I am also going to use heavy cream instead of half and half

Good recipe!  I modified by using 1/2 cup of butter, a dash of crushed red pepper in with the garlic, and some fresh lemon juice for brightness.  I also used heavy cream (and was thankful that I did because it wasn't watery and there was no need to thicken with the cornstarch).  *It's not an alfredo sauce with regard to thickness; it's more like a parmesan-butter-cream sauce.  So don't be alarmed.*  Quite tasty.  

After the shrimp and scallops were cooked, I wilted some arugula before adding the heavy cream.  (We like the peppery flavor.)  *I would recommend using scallops that are at least 1/2 inch in diameter lest they become rubbery while the shrimp are cooking.*

I garnished with some diced roma tomatoes and some of the grated parmesan, and it looked beautiful on the plate.  This is quite a lot of food but is definitely "company" worthy.  Especially if served with a salad, garlic bread, and your favorite white wine.

I think you could modify this recipe to suit your own tastes without any difficulty at all, even for those who haven't cooked a tremendous amount of seafood...or just haven't cooked a tremendous amount.  If you follow the recipe you'll yield spectacular results!  

Happy cooking!

Great recipe!! My family loved it!
I left out the scallops and used a 1/2 lb of sausage instead, only used a half cup of green onions, put a bit more parmesan in the sauce, and included the corn starch. It was delicious, but I felt like something was missing; I think I will experiment with other cheeses in the future.

This was really rich and good. I could not find green onions in the stores so I used onion, fresh mushrooms and green pepper. I couldn't find half and half so I used coffee cream. I had to thicken it with flour because I didn't have cornstarch. Also added parsley and chives.

This is a good recipe and I did make it as stated with the exception of using some dried basil for a little flavor.  I think next time I make it, I will use more garlic, the dish was a little bland for my taste.  A little tweeking and it will be delicious.

This dish was quite good!  I didn't have any green onions, so I just cut up a small tomato to put in it's place to add some color and flavor.  In place of the shrimp, I used leftover grilled salmon.  It was delicious!!  You can substitute any veggies or fish, and this will still taste great.  Will use this recipe again, for sure!!

I had to improvise based on ingredients I had on hand and it still turned out great. I reduced the green onion to approx 1/2 cup and I used 3 teaspoons of minced garlic. I used a cup and a half of 2 % milk plus 6 ounces of plain yogurt. I used about a 1/2 pound of shrimp.  I did use flour to thicken the sauce, I prefer cornstarch but I was out of it.

I tweaked this a little. First off I made it for 4 instead of 8. Then I added less onions because no one I was cooking for likes a lot of onion. I also added about half a cup of wine to the sauce. I did let the sauce boil near the end of the cooking process, which the recipe says not to. nd I added extra cheese. But this turned out really well. I had to let me sit and cook longer that the recipe said, which was fine. I added extra liquid (the wine) and I'm not the best at sauces. Plus I had my wisdom teeth out the day before and cooked this while taking a good amount of Lortab. The only bad things I would say is I was worried the scallops wouldn't be done (and they wouldn't have been if I just cooked this in the time the recipe said and that the sauce was on the bland side...which I take responsibility for as I added less green onions and only moderate amounts of salt and pepper. Next time I will add more salt, more pepper and perhaps white pepper. We liked this a lot and all of it was eaten. Its a great base to tailor to your specific tastes and really, really easy to cook. Also when its done it looks lovely and very Olive Garden-ish.

Most excellent. But, as usual, I had to play with it some.  I used 1/4 red-1/4 green onions, and whole tomato (chopped & seeded).  I deglazed the pan with white wine before I added my scallops.  I did not use shrimp.  I used large scallops chopped in 4's.  I also used heavy cream.  I seasoned with salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and oregano.  It was a little rich.  I think that I will use less parm next time.

I use 1 can crabmeat, and frozen shrimp, but the rest pretty much the same and serve it over angel hair pasta with toasted french bread. My husband loves it because now he doesn't have to take me to Red Lobster. When I get a craving for seafood, I just make this. It is excellent!

This was ok.  I used cornstarch to help thicken the sauce but it still seemed to sink to the bottom.  I also fried portabella mushrooms to add flavor but the sauce was still pretty bland.  Hopefully next time I can find a way to add some more flavor to the sauce.  It is always worth another shot!!

I chose this recipe because it listed both shrimp and scallops in the ingredients, and I had never cooked scallops before.  Result---ABSOLUTELY MOUTHWATERINGLY FANTASTIC!!  I used half-n-half instead of the heavy cream, and perhaps that's why the sauce took a while to thicken, even with adding corn starch.  Regardless, kudos to the chef and thank you!

Absolutely loved this recipe.  It was quick, easy and delicious.  I added lobster to mine and also tried it on rice instead of pasta the 2nd time around.  It was a hit with the family!

This was easy and awesome! The sauce was lighter than traditional alfredo sauce, but still creamy and very tasty. We love garlic and onion, so I added 6 cloves and doubled the onions. We like our onions crisper, so I added them at the end so they wouldn't wilt.

Very good recipe.  Did add red peeper flakes, mushrooms and zuchini.  Also didn't have corn startch so I just sprinkled in a little flour over the seafood mixture before adding the cheese.  Also went a little heavier on the Parmesean.  Served over fresh fettucini.  Who knew a a fettucini dish could be so easy!

This was just okay for us.  We weren't too keen on the fish flavor with the creamy sauce.  Was a bit too rich.  I don't think I'll make this again, but it wasn't horrible.  Just not something my family liked.

EXCELLENT! I halved the recipe, except the garlic-remained the same, and added fresh mushrooms and a bit of cayenne pepper. I utilized the optional cornstarch to thicken. My daughter is a connoisseur of the dish at any restuarant she comes across that serves it: Olive Garden, Chillis, etc. She said mine was just as good as her favorite at Olive Garden....if NOT better!

I found that sometimes the sauce comes out a little thin... more corn starch helps a bit.  But, in general, it's pretty good!  You can also substitute the seafood with chicken.

This was a very good recipe for a simple fettuccine sauce, it could have used a bit more flavor though so I added a 1/2 tsp more garlic as well as a 1/2 tsp of parsley and 1/2 tsp of old bay seasoning.  I also cut the shrimp/scallops in 1/2.  In doing so, I cut the sauce in half which was a mistake because I thought that it could have used more sauce.  Next time I will make the full 8 servings of sauce with 1/2 of the meat/fish.  Overall great recipe!

This the best Fettuccine sauce I have ever had. I have made it the way recipe says to and have made it my own way with fresh garlic. It is also great with Chicken, green onion & mushrooms. Play away with the fillers but, stick with the sauce it is to die for. Thumbs up!!!!!

This dish was fantastic!!  I also added a can of clams and mushrooms, as others had suggested.  Instead of the 1/2 & 1/2 and cornstarch, I used sour cream and added a good splash of hot sauce.

YUM!!  I didn't follow this recipe exactly.  Instead of half and half, I added two cups of heavy cream.  Also, I didn't need the cornstarch at all.  This recipe was wonderful.  My husband said it was the best seafood fettuccine he has ever had! :)

I did make a few changes based on previous reviews...I added 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained), 2 cans of drained mushrooms & I used bay scallops & angel hair pasta(this was last minute & I wasn't going to the store).  The cornstarch worked for me, but for the missing ingredient I added Dry Sherry.  That did the trick!!!  I'll definitely make this again.

made the cajun seafood fettuccine by accident thinking it was this recipe that I had made before.  We prefer the seafood fettuccine way better.  The cajun was way too peppery, almost ruined the dinner for us.  This version is very good.  Want to try it with crab legs and shrimp, which is what we did with the cajun version but could barely eat it with all the pepper.

This was very good, a good building block to start off then use your imagination to make it more fancy if desired.  I omitted the scallops and just doubled up on the shrimp.  I thought it was great and so did the neighbors who came by.

I loved this recipe.  It's better than some I've had in restaurants.  Even my boyfriend, who's not a big pasta lover, went back for seconds.  We used scallop and shrimp, but I may try it today with chicken breast.

This dish is DELICIOUS!  Though it only took a few minutes to prepare, it tasted as if I had spent all day on it.  Because we love garlic, I added a little bit of roasted garlic to it, which was awesome.

I used everyone elseâ€™s suggestion and used heavy whipping cream. I had clams and crab meat on hand so I added that as well (scallops weren't available at the grocery store) to the shrimp. It worked out very well with the children too.

I added sautÃ©ed mushrooms & a few cherry tomatoes to the sauce. I used a little bit of flour (didnâ€™t have corn starch) to thicken it. Complete Yum-Fest!! Iâ€™ll be making this again.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. My only variation was preparing gluten free and some of my favorite spices which added a kick!

I made a few small tweaks to suit our tastes. Omitted onion, because we didn't have it. I did add a little nub of cream cheese that was nearing the expiry date. I also replaced scallops with krab. It was very tasty, and I will definitely make it again.

We used 6 cloves of garlic and kept adding Parmesan cheese until we got the sauce to desired consistency.  Weâ€™re on a ketogenic diet, so substituted heavy whipping cream for half-n-half and used zucchini noodles for pasta.  Delicious!

This was so easy to make and delicious to eat last night. I've only omitted the green onions since I didn't have any. I didn't need to add the cornstarch either. I would make this again.

I agree with others that the sauce is very bland. I added 1/2 cup white cooking wine and some garlic salt in addition to the salt and pepper. Also added broccoli, tomatoes, and spinach

I added Asiago cheese - I did add 1 tbs cornstarch to thick but in retrospect I think I should have waited because the sauce thickened too much I need to add more water and cream - I also cooked it all too early before my guests arrived and it went cold so had to reheat but everyone enjoyed it  - had to add a bit more salt and one guest had 2 servings !! So it was very good in spite of my mistakes

Made this for my fatherâ€™s birthday, after he raved for months about a dinner exactly like this that heâ€™d had at a local restaurant. I doubled up on the shrimp, as Kroger had given me a free bag. (Sadly, no free scallops) This makes a simply stunning amount of food, but that is in no way a complaint - it freezes beautifully! Definitely making this again soon!!!!

This recipe is a keeper, I did tweek it based on some comments so I added a shallot, a half a cup of wine and a 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes. I did use cornstarch because I prefer a thicker consistency. So delicious!

This recipe was delicious! I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. I would definitely recommend adding the cornstarch. It gave the sauce a perfect consistency and was very creamy. Will add this to my favorites.

With some changes in the cooking instruction it's a solid 5. I cut the portions back to 2, lunch tomorrow...can't wait! I can only get frozen scallops where I live so I soaked them in milk for 20 minutes to remove the "fishy" taste. While the pasta was cooking I pan seared the scallops and then the shrimp, scallops are too delicate IMHO to risk over cooking. I cooked the pasta for exactly 8 minutes and retained 3/4 cup of the cooking liquid before draining.  Add the pasta and cooking liquid to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes. The corn starch is unnecessary, the starchy water replaces it. I then added the scallops and shrimp and cooked it just enough to warm. I had about a cup of extra clams and mussels so included this for the last minute. This will be a repeat, thanks for the recipe.

Easy and delicious.  The scallops give it an air of eloquence, but it would probably be good with just the shrimp also.

This is a great recipe. I tried to follow the instructions verbatim, with the exception of extra garlic and cheese. I used dried cilantro cause I mistakenly thought I had no fresh on hand. As recommended, I added some corn meal to thicken the sauce. I used some monster shrimp and sea scallops. I'm not a pasta afficianado, but this was very tasty and apparently lighter than most recipes. A real crowd pleaser.

This was truly the best seafood pasta I have had. My husband loves it and requests it once a week. I added roasted lobster tail, scallops, calamari rings and scaled back on the amount of shrimp. It was perfect! Thank you so much for the recipe!

First off I used heavy cream and added mushrooms, but those were the only changes.  I used Shrimp and Scallops it was very flavorful.   The wife likes seafood and thought the recipe was very good.  Everything came together well in this simple recipe.  I will be using again and with different combinations as well.

Really enjoyed making this dish. I substituted the scallops with crawfish.  Making the alfredo sauce was a little challenging but realized that the corn starch was a must instead of optional to thicken up the sauce. My family really enjoyed me using the recipe. I will be using it again.

VERY BLAND! I was looking for a recipe for seafood alfredo. I added more salt, pepper and one more clove of garlic than it called for and STILL lacking taste. I won't be using this recipe again but thank you for posting. I'm not sure what I could've done differently to give it more flavor.

Prepared the Seafood Alfredo Fettuccine for tonite's dinner; it was fantastic and quite easy.  I tweaked it a bit by adding a few extra ingredients:  a splash of lemon juice, a few shakes of crushed red pepper and two chopped snow crab clusters.  I had to substitute one tablespoon of finely diced onion and chopped parsley for the chopped green onion.  Will make sure there are green onions in the fridge the next time I make this recipe.  Yep, received positive comments from hubby (not atypical).  Thanks!!  Sorry there is not a picture, but it was quite colorful and looked terrific.

I made this for a repast and it was delish.  I did switch it up a bit.  I added several veggies, OK a bunch of veggies (squash, zucchini, asparagus, carrots & broccoli)to give it a healthier twist (plus I love them), white wine & Dijon mustard.  A friend recommended the last two ingredients.     I cooked the scallops & shrimp as directed and added about 1/4 c wine and used the left over juice in the cream sauce and addes the Dijon mustard into the sauce also .  Fantastic.  Just made so much that there wasn't quite enuff sauce but it was soo good.  Next time, more sauce.

Great!  I followed the recipe closely but did not bother with the corn starch.  I also used garlic salt instead of garlic as we don't like an overpowering garlic flavor.    I added capers which were wonderful.   I served broccoli and baby spinach with it.   It could have been added in.   All in all the meal was delicious and I would make it again.

Made this dish for my family and added a few extras .  After rinsing the scallops and shrimp ( which I added) I seasoned the seafood with the salt , pepper, red peppers flakes and parsley.  The seafood was then sautÃ©ed in the butter/garlic.  When I added the cream ( used light cream) I also poured in some white wine.  I felt the cornstarch amount was great and added the right amount of creaminess to the sauce.  I will most definitely make this dish again.

My family really liked it!  This was super rich even with using half and half instead of heavy cream.  I added some heat with red pepper flakes.  Great recipe!

This is a good starter recipe but it needs flavor. I added an extra clove of garlic, chopped bell pepper, onion and canned sliced artichokes. I also added a few tablespoons of cooking wine and used a fresh seafood mix (squid, octopus, shrimp, scallops and lobster). And at the end season liberally with salt, pepper and old bay.

This is a great base. I gave 4 stars as i added a bunch of stuff, lemon juice, hot pepper flakes, and used whipping cream instead of half and half. But it gives you the right idea of portions.

Not a great recipe. It lacked flavor and the sauce was soupy and thin.  I was surprised it had such great ratings after I made it and I'm a really good cook.  I'm sure you can take the basics and add more flavor and make it better.  But I won't be making this again.

This was so easy, my 20 year old daughter actually made this, and it turned out great. We followed the recipe with two exceptions. We substituted chicken for the seafood.  I'm looking forward to making it myself with shrimp and scallops.  We also added some mushrooms, they were in the fridge.

I tweaked the recipe a bit as our family likes more flavor, after adding butter to fry up scallops & shrimp I added white truffle oil and chicken broth powder mix, garlic powder. I also used more parmesan cheese, and had to use constarch to thicken the sauce. Turned out amazing, I made enough to feed 10 people. There was 3 adults 2 kids eating, I only had 1 plate leftover!

Seriously restaurant quality with just a couple tweeks.   I added chopped roasted red peppers (from a jar) to the very end of the cooking process.  I didn't want the sauce to turn pink!  I also added fresh mushrooms to the green onion saute along with a splash of marsala wine to the sauce and divided heavy cream with half half & half.  DELICIOUS!

Absolutely delish. I substituted whole grain penne pasta added 5 gloves of garlic, red pepper flakes and red cayenne pepper to taste and a cup of spinach.  Only 1 T of cornstarch needed to thicken.  Yummy!!

I cook the seafood separately so as not to overcook. My take: Saute a bit of garlic in a pan with a stick of butter. Pour in a pint of heavy cream. After it starts getting good and hot add in a pinch of chicken boullion powder (flavor boost) and then start adding the cheese in a handful at a time til incorporated stirring continually and careful not to boil. Throw the cooked seafood in when its done (or keep separate) and serve with the pasta. No fail, perfect alfredo and tastes just like the good restaurants make.

Excellent!  The half and half made it lighter than recipes that use whole cream. As others have noted, I added some sliced baby portobello mushrooms and a dash of white wine with the onion and garlic step.  I also added a can of baby clams and a drop of clam juice with the fish step. For the cornstarch part, I spooned some sauce from the pan into a coffee cup. To this cup of warm sauce, I added 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch and dissolved it before adding it back to the pan. I waited to see the sauce consistency, then did the step one more time. It was perfect and no lumps of cornstarch.

Loved this recipe. We were pleased with the great flavor. I used the full cup of Parmesan cheese while cooking and then added more when it was served.  Also, made this with shrimp, King crab and one small lobster tail. Delicious!!!!

Excellent recipe. Very easy to make and very flavorful. The sauce was creamy and had the right consistency.  I used the tablespoon of cornstarch and once mixed with the pasta it was perfect. I added Portabella mushrooms. I used the 4 serving recipe instead of 8 and still had leftovers.

This was really easy to make and quite tasty!  I added chopped red pepper when I added the onion and garlic into the pan, and omitted scallops.  I had no idea how easy it is to make a white sauce seafood pasta dish.  Will definitely add this into my usual dinner menus!  Want to try chicken next time.

This recipe is soooooo good!  The family ranted and raved about it. So easy, I can't believe that people pay big bucks for alfredo when it's so easy! Definitely in the rotation.

Very easy & tasty.  I halved the recipe since there are only 3 of us & I used bay scallops instead of sea scallops, since that's what I had on hand. I did include the corn starch to thicken the sauce & it came out great.  Next time, I'll add a bit more garlic and maybe a little white wine just to take it up a notch.  There will definitely be a next time!

Fairly easy and quite tasty. I made it a bit healthier by substituting yogurt and a little water for the half-and-half.

Just made this. I followed the directions except added 1/4 c of white wine to add flavor. I let it cook down after I added the cornstarch for about 10 minutes. I plan to toss with broccoli and pasta. thanks.

This a simple wonderful recipe that every seafood lover will enjoy. I make it just as the recipe states and serve it with garlic cheese biscuts and a caesar salad. My niece has asked me to make this so much I finally just gave her the recipe!

Awesome seafood fettuccine!!!!  A total keeper!  I loosely followed the recipe.  I probably used more garlic!!  I added cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce.  Next time, I will definitely add mushroom.  Plenty of flavor!!  Nice, thank you for the recipe!  A new favorite!

I loved the ease of this sauce. I did add to this dish steamed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. I doubled the recipe and added 2 cups of cheese. I did thicken as suggested with cornstarch and it turned out awesome! This one I will be making again.. and again. My husband raved about it!

OMG! This was so good. I made it for my family for my sister's birthday and it was such a hit. I added some cooked salmon, baby shrimp, prawns, and scallops (was feeding a few people) and it came out better than I thought it would! Every needs to try this!

To me this was just okay.  It seemed as if it were missing something.  I kept reading over the recipe to see if I had left something out because all the other reviewers were raving over it.  I will try again with a few modifications to see if I can get it to suit my taste.

I made 1/2 the recipe and used 1 lb bay scallops only.  I also had chives on hand vs green onions and that worked.  For the cream, used 1/2 C milk and 1/2 C half and half and fresh parm.  As it cooked, I added some flour to thicken it.  Finally, added some chopped fresh spinach along with diced tomatoes.  Great color and good flavor.

Better than I've had at restruants!  I used heavy cream because I had some.  I cut the pasta & seafood amounts in half, but left the sauce the same.  I increased the amount of garlic and added fresh seeded, diced tomatoes at the end.  This is an amazing dish, not for the calorie conscious, but well worth the splurge!

This was absolutely delicious, and I can't believe how easy it was! I was a little worried because there was a lot of liquid in the pan after cooking the seafood, but it thickened up once the cornstarch was added, plus I let it sit for awhile before serving. If you don't like garlic that much, maybe cut it down a little. It was pretty overpowering, but I still thought it was fabulous! Would be good with crab meat also.

It was just ok, a bit disappointing.  There was way too much parmesan cheese.  In all fairness to the recipe I omitted scallops and added chicken, that might have taken a way from it a bit.  If I made this again I would make some changes.

Hubby made this tonight for supper. Said it was easy to make. I'm not a big seafood person but this didn't taste fishy. It was very good! Next time around he will cut back on the cornstarch.  Excellent with white wine!
