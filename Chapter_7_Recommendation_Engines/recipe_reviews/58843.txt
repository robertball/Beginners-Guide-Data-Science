This was scrumptious - I grew up in Alaska and have eaten halibut cooked many, many ways - so I truly enjoyed the flavors.
Changes I made are:

Used 1/3 cup of each 3/4 cup ingredient. Grated fresh lemon zest and sprinked cracked pepper on halibut instead of lemon pepper. For the salsa, I used some leftover homemade tomatilla salsa...wonderful - can't wait to make it again.

Neither hubs nor I enjoyed this. The topping is rather flavorless, and serves only to keep the fish kind of "wet." A sauce should enhance the food it accompanies, not dominate or bury it. Some ideas to improve this would be to bake, grill or broil the fish separately, then serve the sauce on the side. As for the sauce itself, it needs some flavor additions - chile powder, jalapeno or bell peppers maybe?

Really enjoyed this recipe. Have lots of Halibut from an Alaskian fishing trip and tired of the traditional way of cooking fish. I will be making this again only I think I may use just the cracked pepper instead of the lemon pepper or maybe cut down on the lemon pepper.

Used orange roughy. Per other suggestions I changed everything that was 3/4 to 1/3 and the amount of sauce was perfect! No garlic oil so I substituted about 2 cloves of minced garlic. FH and picky teen devoured it! It is a keeper. TY for the recipe!

great recipe!  We added about 1/2 cup of cheese and once it was cooked, it was great over fettucini noodles :)  I think we might add some crab meat to it next time.

Yum!  Would be good with chicken too.  Makes a lot of sauce, so you could cut down on the sauce, or add more fish or chicken.  I think the sauce served cold would make a good dip.

I agree with Naples 34102. There were some problems with this recipe - nothing exciting about, generally. The only positive thing that I can say about this recipe was that the fish was moist. I may try this recipe again with some changes, as my husband seemed to like it. Suggestions: I would suggest reducing the general amount of marinade/sauce mixture, as it thinned out considerably when it cooked, and didn't seem to reconstitute, even with resting. It seemed to work better as a 'leftovers' dish. I added some roasted garlic, onions and julienned red bell peppers. Next time, I would also leave out the butter, as the recipe seemed to call for an awful lot of it, and it didn't seem to really help the overall outcome. I would also suggest using this as a marinade, rather than a sauce. The next time I make this, I am going to try it 'en papiotte'. I am hoping that the next time, this will be a more successful dish. I am willing to give it another try.

Delicious and easy to make. I had some sauce leftover, so we put it on our salad as salad dressing. It tasted good there too.

This turned out great, although I did make some changes and served it with warm tortillas!  Both my 6 & 3 year old boys loved it and said "this is the BEST"!  The sauce is really yummy!  LOL  
We used a white fish filet similar to tilapia (comes frozen; called Swai) & seasoned with Badia Complete Seasoning, garlic & onion powder, plus lime juice and sea salt.  Let sit 15 mins.
For sauce i used heaping 1/3 cups of mayo & sour cream and 1/2 cup mild salsa.  added 2 chopped green onions and a handful of fresh chopped cliantro, some lime zest and another squeeze of fresh lime juice.  
my filets were thinner than halibut, so it only needed 15mins in the oven & then i topped it with crumbled Queso Fresco & put back in hot oven (turned oven off) and left about 8 mins.  It was perfect!!  :-)
Since we are pretty regular with the lime/cilanto flavored foods, we just knew this would be perfect with these added items and of course some fresh Mexican cheese!  OH...and the best thing was eating it with warm mini tortillas!  We had our own yummy fish tacos!  
thanks for the recipe and ideas!  This will be a keeper in our house!  :-)

So easy and simple to make. I left out the garlic oil and used non-stick butter spray instead of butter. I also used fat free sour cream. I will definitely  make this again.

This was a big hit!  I did cook up some chorizo and then placed it under the fish while it cooked (making the dish less healthy but very good).  I also added a little hot souce to the sauce mix and served with some black beans and corn tortillas. Wonderful!

Simple and tasty. I used Nile Perch, a thick, white fish fillet. To cut calories, I used only 1/2 c. mayo, yogurt instead of sour cream, and garlic powder instead of garlic oil. I served it with rice and a salad for an excellent supper.

Five stars on this!  I have a similar recipe (which we love) that does not have the salsa as an ingredient...but we enjoyed this just as much.  Incidentally, I made this with salmon, rather than halibut.  Terrific recipe.  Thx, Candie!

I made this with haddock instead. I only used a pound. I used 1/2 cup salsa and 3/4 cup fat free sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo. It was good. I made too much sauce and the sour cream taste was a little strong. Next time I will try using 1/2 cup salsa and 1/4 cup sour cream and no mayo and see how that works. I served with yellow rice which I added some chopped veggies to. Good overall.

Really disappointing.  Tasted like thousand island dressing on top.  Tried adding extra chili powder, no help.  Perhaps some green chilis would do the trick.

I did find the sauce mixture to be a little bland and we used a good variety of salsa.  I think to highlight the salsa more, I would try halving the mayo and sour cream amounts, leaving the salsa the same, the next time I would try this.  I also didn't really care for the lemon pepper with the salsa.  Next time, I would just use regular pepper.

Spicy salsa is the key to this recipe. "Fresh" halibut should not taste or smell fishy. Excellent dish-will make again!

We did this with tilapia and really enjoyed it...despite the fact that I was rushing and put the melted butter in the sauce, rather than in the baking dish. I also subbed a little olive oil for garlic oil, since I didn't have it. It went well with Black Beans and Rice (by Bonnie Baumgardner) from this site. We'll definitely have this again!

I cut the mayo, yogart and salsa to 1/3 cup each.  The yogart and mayo were both "light".  To the mix I added a little dill and paprika.  I added slivered almonds to the top.  It was delicious.

This was awesome!  Just the right amount of zip!  If you like em spicy, you might want to add hot salsa.  I also used low fat sour cream.  My husband loved this one!

This is an excellent and simple recipe. The flavor will go with almost any vegatable. You can substitute chicken breast pre-cooked in a little butter, for the fish.

Based on some of the other reviews, I spritzed my halibut with lime juice before adding the lemon pepper.  I also added some chili powder to the sauce.  As indicated by other reviewers, this does make a LOT of sauce, but it was really the perfect amount for serving over rice.  My toddler and I enjoyed it (he went back for thirds!) but my fish-hating husband wasn't a huge fan even though the sauce covered any traces of fish-related flavor.  Still, I'm sure I will make it again.  It was easy and tasty!

My wife and I really liked this dish. You should really pay close attention to the cooking time because mine was done in ten minutes probably because my fillets were not as thick. Also I think the addition of some crab to the sauce would be a good addition. Will try that the next time I make this recipe.

The fish is very good, I added some jalapeno on the top to give it some extra flavor. But I can't give it 5 starts, the sauce is really fattening. It is not something you can enjoy often.
