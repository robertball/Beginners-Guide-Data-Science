I am the poster of this recipe. Thank you all for such nice reviews. You can CUT CALORIES CONSIDERABLY by spraying them with a mister or PAM(TM). I use a "Misto"(TM) filled with olive oil. Also, you can decrease the salt and add additional seasonings. Enjoy!!  UPDATE: The timing of the baking, as others noted, is critical. Baking too little results in limp kale pieces and baking too long causes a "burned" taste. Be sure to use the "curly" kale variety as it tend to be less bitter.DO NOT EXPECT them to taste like potato chips... that was just an expression I used in the description. Kale is a nutritional powerhouse and rich in calcium and other vitamins. GREAT way to feed yourself and your kids!! ENJOY!!

I've tried a LOTS of versions of kale chips with LOTS of different results. I've found that the success of the chip depends on three things: how you cook them, how curly the kale is and how much oil you use.   This method has been, by far, the best: I've tried lower temp with long cooking, higher temp with quick cooking, convection methods, different sheet pans and all the rest. This recipe works (IMHO) by using a non insulated sheet and cooking at 350 for 10 minutes. I rotated my baking sheet 180 halfway through.   I also made a point to use ONLY just enough oil to BARELY coat the leaves otherwise they'll stay soggy. When I arrange the pieces on the pan, I place them like little upside down "V's" so the curly side is down: I think this helps the air circulate around them better.   Other than that, after you coat them with the oil, get creative with the toppings!!! I squeeze a little lemon on mine with sea salt or will do some garlic powder with chipotle pepper powder.   Hope you'll all enjoy these as much as I did...Thanks Lucy!

My hubby looked at me like I was crazy when I started making this! LOL We both really liked the finished product. I used butter flavored cooking spray because it seemed easier than spreading the oil around and also used garlic salt which we really liked! The only hint I can offer is to watch this very, very carefully toward the end of the cooking time because I think just thirty seconds past "crispy" is another term..."crumbly" Into tiny pieces that are messy to eat :o)

These were really neat.  They did have a similar taste to potato chips.  I made mine a little too salty but they were great.  Even the kids ate them, which is saying something for kale.

I got this recipe from a local blogger who writes about our local box. She used soy sauce instead of the seasoning salt and they came out heavenly.

So. Very. Good.

I've been looking to an alternative to munching chips in front of the TV at night, and these are awesome, especially when you've had enough hummus for the week:). 

For those who were concerned about the ultra-crunchy crumbliness, (which in truth I kind of liked) I found that those Kale leaves that were folded in two (as it tends to do by itself if you don't unfold it as you place it on the pan) were a little more crunchy on parts and chewier in parts, if that's what you're going for. I had a mix of both and loved it. 

I kept a close eye on these and ended up happier with a tad lower temperature (around 330-340) and set the timer for 6 minutes and checked them, the first batch ready in 7 min, the second in 6 (hotter oven I guess). 

Halfway through eating these, I called my sister in law and HAD to tell her about them. Definitely a find. I will make these at my next family gathering. (My nephews and nieces have come to expect my unusual 'hippie' food:) )

I was very excited to see this recipe, but disappointed by the finished product. It was definitely not a hit with my kid. They were difficult to cook evenly. It was a fine line between crispy and burnt. My husband and I thought they were ok, but not something we are excited to try again. You end up with a lot of chips and they really don't keep - you need to eat them right away or they are quite unpleasant. I did make a vegetarian lasagna with kale a few days later (we have a lot of kale these days) and that was a big hit.

I love these. Important tips: Wash and thoroughly dry. If possible, dry the day prior. I place the kale in a extra large bowl, add oil and shake until each piece is covered with oil. After laying them out on a cookie sheet, I lightly salt. Baking time is crucial. If unsure on time, go with low and slow. Brown make bitter! I do 325 for about 15-20 min, depending on moisture. 
For extra flavor, sprinkle parmesan cheese, crushed red chili, dry ranch mix or during shake process add vinegar of choice for tartness!

These are indeed a good conversation item.  They all got eaten, but it took a few days.  I'll make these again, and this time will not stir in the middle of the baking time (it seemed like a good idea, but the kale stuck together).

This sounds crazy, but it is very good!!  All of the kids liked these.---Which NEVER happens!!  I will experiment with different seasonings.  Make sure you drain on paper towels after cooking.

Very creative!  I didn't quite understand how these could turn crispy instead of limp...I was wrong!  They were crispy, but mine had a burnt taste.  I baked about 12 min.  They sort of broke up and disolved on my tounge like dried herbs...  I think I over baked them.  I used garlic salt, but a little too much (my fault).  I will try them again becaue we really love kale and I think this idea is the coolest!  I didn't want to ruin the review with my mistakes, so I gave 4 stars for what tasted like 3!

Trying hard to eat healthier, and kale is just so jam-packed with nutrients that I was determined to get this right. It took two tries, though, and here is what made the difference. You barely need a teaspoon of olive oil for every two fistfuls of kale. Too much oil and they don't crisp up. The second time, I put it all in a big mixing bowl, put a tiny splash of extra virgin (and two drops of truffle oil!) and tossed it well using metal tongs. Kept my hands clean! Then sprinkle lightly with sea salt or seasoning salt, and a small dash of garlic powder, and mix well again, tossing with the tongs. Remember the fluffy kale bakes down and shrinks, it is really easy to go overboard on seasonings. Then I spread it out on a non-stick sheet and baked at 300 degrees. Five minutes into it, I took it out and used the tongs to "fluff" it up and scrape it off the pan. This helped dry it out tremendously. I put it back in, and kept taking it out every couple of minutes to shake the pan. As it more properly dries out, the kale will start to freely slide around on the pan when you shake it...that is how you know you are close to done. I put it back in for just a couple minutes more, and man, they came out sooooo lite and crispy it was almost like eating air! My three year old was shoving them down as fast as she could because she thought they were "chips". Big contrast to the first time I made them, they came out too chewy for my kids because I had used too much oil.

One important tip: never SALT before the oven, it draws in water and makes it soggy and not nice and crisp, so salt as soon as the come out of the oven. Also for a twist add some sesame seed oil with the EVOO. Good tastes!

I found that using the temperature suggested in this recipe resulted in unevenly baked kale - some pieces burnt, some still soft.  I found another recipe that baked at 250 for 25 minutes (I ended up going for 30) and it worked out much better.

These babies inspired me to sign up on recipe.com and begin a recipe box! They were that good! I tried different seasonings: mustard seed (okay), chinese 5 spice seasoning (good), garlic salt (great), cumin with a pinch of salt (excellent!), BRAGGS seasoning (superb!).  I'm in the same boat as all of these reviewers - completely surprised on how enjoyable they are.

Delicious! I was very surprised at how much I liked these. You HAVE to make sure the kale is dry otherwise you'll end up with steamed kale instead of crispy kale. First batch for me was WAY too salty, second batch not enough salt. So I would suggest tossing the olive oil and kale together, spreading on the baking sheets - then sprinkling the salt (or whatever seasoning you are using) over the kale. I also add a little garlic powder and onion powder! To make it even a little bit healthier spend your money on organic kale, it is quite a bit more expensive, but it has a lot less pesticides!

FYI - To each his/her own BUT.... although cooking sprays may be quicker at times PLEASE take a look at the ingriedient list - they contain butane and propane! Why ruin healthy kale with that yuck (even if the amount is minimal)....just saying! ;)

I would give these 20 stars if I could. I eat 2 heads of kale a week ever since I discovered this recipe. I probably only use 1 teaspoon at most of olive oil for a head of kale and just the barest sprinkle of sea salt and pepper. Best idea I've come across in years!!

I got this recipe from a Jacques Pepin cooking show.  It was awful in that it was bitter. There are ppl who like bitter but it's a bad word to me.  I do strongly suggest you try it once however, as the health benifts would be awesome (in regards to snacking), if you lucky enough to like them.  The need for crunch is so hard to meet with a healthy option.    I'm completely baffled by the person who says "similar taste to potato chips.".  Taste buds are funny creatures tho.   To help keep the kale cook evenly and be crispy, cook on a rack (I think that's what it is called) on top of a cooking sheet. That way the air circulates around the kale.  Baked chicken should be done this way too.

So wonderful and healthy, and even my preschool-age children love it!  

Based on other reviews, here are my modifications:
Turn down the oven a few degrees to 340 or so.
Tear the kale into 2-3 square inch pieces (discard the thick center stalk).
Arrange in a single layer on a cookie sheet (no need to line with parchment paper).
Spray with Pam.
Sprinkle with garlic salt or another favorite seasoning.
Keep in the oven for only about 7 minutes or so. Monitor the cooking time to prevent them from becoming dark or burnt.

Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

If I wasn't on Prozac I could shed a tear, this recipe is so good.  I made it exactly as written and I couldn't believe something like kale- KALE, people!!- would be so delicious.  I plan on making this for my diabetic parents.  THANK YOU for this recipe, thank you so much.

I make these daily! The trick to never having burnt or too soft Kale is to bake at 325-350 for 7-10 minutes (before the edges turn any shade of brown)then TURN OFF YOUR OVEN and let them just sit and crisp for another 10-25 minutes depending on your location. They will most likely still be soft when you turn off your oven- don't worry-(you can even forget about them)! Perfect and all crispy-crunchy every time!

I find that baking at a lower temp for longer eliminates the burnt taste. I tried 20 mins at 300 and they turned out great!

These are amazing. They last for about three minutes in my house before we consume them all. I've made it a couple of times and the trick to ensuring nice crispy chips seems to be making sure that the leaves are dry before you bake them, so if you wash the kale, be sure to dry each leaf thoroughly. It takes a little extra time, but it's worth it.

Was surprised, very tasty!  A hint for the preparation, my kitchen shears made it easy to remove the spine-and speedy.  I baked at 340, and tasted a piece every so often after 6 min., turned out perfect around 8 min. I tried a plain sea salt and a cajun seasoning-both very tasty!

I made these as is and found them to be very salty. After a little research on the nutritional value, I discovered that Kale has about 35 mg of sodium, so a made a second batch without ANY salt or topping except for a few sprays of Olive Oil Pam. We ate with our Asian meal of Orange Ginger Chicken and sticky rice. We like them very much..... but only when they were naked.

We love this recipe but instead of the oven, I simply use my dehydrator.  No worries of overcooking/burning the "chips" that way!  I find I can get away with 1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil if I put the leaves in a BIG bowl and toss thoroughly after drizzling the oil over the kale.    We grow kale in our garden and this is a great use for it!

Very yummy! Couple things though, dont use cooking spray, it takes some of the flavor away, instead I tossed the peices in a little bit of olive oil and used sea salt. I also cooked it on a pice of foil and turned the heat down to 325, this helped keep them from burning alothough I kind of liked the slightly overcooked flavor. I will definately use this recipe often!

These are very good. I placed my very dry kale in a plastic bag and poured the oil in and smushed the oil all over the kale . Make sure to only bake a single layer of kale at a time or it won't crisp right.

I am a potatochip fiend and a friend recently informed me of the pesticide use in potatos, and low quality oils used in frying.  So in my search of salty crunchy alternatives I checked this out.  The only problem is they are so good, I ate them off the cookie sheet and had to make more.  They didn't make it to the table.  BTW, I didn't have kale on hand so i used collard greens.  I also had no salad spinner so I dried them with a towel.  It worked perfectly.  Also good with cayenne.

I LOVE these. I first tried them and even though I followed instructions they had burnt - and tasted awful.  I didn't make them again for a couple of months.  But now to prevent them from burning, I place parchment paper on my cookie sheet and bake at 200F until dried out.  They're super tasty!

These were really good. BEWARE TOO MUCH SALT. I used only a dash but because the kale shrinks up in the oven, it becomes very concentrated. Watch the end time of cooking.  I look forward to trying this again with VERY LITTLE salt and/or different seasonings!

For those who felt it was bitter, try Lacinato kale. It's a milder, sweeter kale than that of traditional green kale and I find it lends itself a bit more to chips. You'll need to get it in an organic market or a Whole Foods type place. You can also try some other seasoning like Spike or Old Bay or something with a medley of seasonings. It'll really jazz up the flavor.

These exceeded my expectation! I picked up a head of kale that was so big it had the whole seat compartment of the cart to itself! Lol! It worked out as they shrink quite a bit after baking. I agree with others that very little oil and salt is needed. I was surprised how gentle the flavor was from such a big curly leaf! Note: These need to be eaten the same day. I tried them the next day and it was like chewing on a rubber band.

I either use garlic infused olive oil or add garlic to the oil. I find if you really rub and massage the kale with oiled hands you can get away with using less oil. I can eat a whole batch of these by myself!! but my kids like it too.

Fabulous.  These lasted about 30 seconds with my skeptical hubby, who ate them all!  I give it four stars because I cooked the first batch for 8 minutes...burnt.  Second batch for 6 mintues...perfect.  10-15 minutes would have been way too long, maybe because I had them in a single layer.

Three tips: (1) It's a lot easier to get good uniform results if you cut into 1/2" wide strips. (2) Don't cram too many on a cookie sheet -- give 'em room. (3) Turn them over about halfway though cooking to prevent getting burned tops and soggy bottoms.

I was skeptical about these, thinking they would be soggy, but I was pleasantly suprised!  I followed the directions and just eyeballed the salt.  I will definitely add less salt next time because once the kale shrunk up, it was too salty.  I still enjoyed it, though, especially with a squirt of lemon juice and a sprinkle of parmesan.  I'll definitely make this crunchy treat again!

I got 2 bunches of Kale in a bountiful basket and had no idea what to do with it. I made this recipe and they are delicious! My 2 and 3 year olds even loved them. Use very little salt because the salt intensifies when baked. They are crispy and airy and I dont feel guilty after eating them. If you don't like brussel sprouts, I dont think you will like these.

I read many of the reviews and cooked my kale chips this way: I  tore the leaves off of any major or larger minor stem completely and used about 2" square or smaller pieces. I used dry kale leaves and tossed them all thoroughly in a bowl with 1 T extra virgin olive oil slowly drizzled while tossing. I laid them out in the bottom of my baking tray that came with my toaster oven and placed it on the bottom rack. I set the temperature for 270, as it tends to cook a bit hotter. Time was set for 15 minutes. I watched carefully and they were done perfectly, dry and not brown. Tossed with sea salt and munched. I wouldn't say they are like potato chips, but a fun veggie chip, as I can taste that this is a vegetable. I guess more like veggie chips in some place like Whole Foods. They are extremely fragile, disintegrated quickly in my mouth. Can't say that they taste like anything substantial, but something fun and less calories for sure if you need a salty/crunchy fix in a hurry. Different seasonings might make them more interesting. I will do again, but just not a home run in my mind.

This is similar to the way I like to prepare broccoli.  It totally changes the flavor.  I really like the crunchy texture bc it leaves me feeling satisfied.  I don't enjoy dragging out the salad spinner, so next time I think I'll towel dry it.  Some leaves may still be a little wet when it's done cooking, but if you let it continue to sit on the cookie sheet, it will evaporate off.  I topped mine with Seasoned Salt.  Fun way to eat your veggies!

Instead of olive oil, I spray both sides of the kale with Pam prior to removing from stalk (it's easier than doing each piece individually). Works fine.

Couldn't be easier to make and a delicious snacky godsend for dieters like me. Kale is one of the most nutritious veggies there is, inexpensive, and this recipe makes the most of it. It's very versatile, as I imagine you could play with a variety of spices and seasonings to your taste. I prefer these with a very small sprinkling of salt and a sprinkling of balsamic vinegar before popping the tray into the oven.  These will likely become a regular feature in our household. Even my non-dieting junk food loving better half loves them!  I find that the trick to cooking them just right is to bake them for about 10 minutes, check to make sure that their color is turning just a little, and then cook for another 3 minutes. I have had better (and lower fat) results with using cooking spray instead of regular olive oil.

Try adding the oil and salt after cooking.  My Kale was pretty wet and I couldn't dry the curly stuff with a paper towel, so I put it in the convection oven on 200 degrees for a few minutes to dry it, but forgot about it.  By the time I got it out - about 25-30 minutes or so, it was perfectly cooked.  So I just sprayed on the olive oil and added the salt and they were perfect with no soggy spots, which I have had problems with before.  I think I will always cook them this way from now on.

I baked mine at 350 for about twelve minutes then turned off oven and left them in there for a few hours to totally dry out. Then I put in plastic bag and crushed to use in spaghetti, on pizza or in anything you desire. Today I made potato salad and mixed some in that. Kind of use like Oregano or any dried spice.

I have a suggestion for people who do not like vegetables, like myself. Just TRY this! I seriously worry about my health because, there are extremely few vegetables that I like. This is a super food and, I looked it up, baked kale retains it's nutrients! Yay! After reading about kale's nutrients, I thought this MIGHT be a way I can actually eat it. And it was DELICIOUS! It really doesn't need anything else except for whats in the recipe but, I may experiment with this superfood now. I still don't have the courage to try raw kale, tho. I can tell by looking at it that I won't like it! LOL Also, it's important to not get any stems! They taste bad!

I've made these a half-dozen times now--first exactly as written, and then following some of the tips in reviews. Here's what I've found:
They really shrink down if you toss them in cider vinegar. 
Use spray olive oil and toss them on the baking sheet--less calories and even coverage. 
Another reviewer suggested poultry seasoning, and that was delicious! 
Onion powder is a great addition, too, as is flavored popcorn seasoning. 
Whatever salt-spice combo you use, go easy, as other people have noted. You can always add salt after they're crisped. 
Watch carefully to make sure they don't scorch. I don't mind bitter, but the second they start to brown, they become much more...kale-y! They don't hold the heat, so you can feel a piece in the oven and tell if they're dried/done.
Delicious and addictive!

Love kale chips. These are great. I didn't use the parchment paper and they were fine.

Made these probably 10 times now. It's official. I am addicted. My best tip - they dry out faster if you spread them out and give them space. Otherwise, it takes longer and then some get burned. I usually make a full bunch of kale in 3 batches. I make them basic but I also like them with a bit of garlic powder. Oh yeah - and if you put them in a plastic container - MAKE SURE they are 100% cool first or they will not be crunchy the next day.

This is a fun, simple, tasty snack.  (To me these seem reminiscent of seaweed, without the strong salty flavor.  The chips come out light and airy with the kale giving just a subtle flavor through the texture.)  I think the prep time is longer while the cooking time is much shorter.  On my oven the batches were getting crisp at around 5 minutes.  I'd take them out just as they'd become dry and crunchy.  I followed earlier suggestions to use a spritzer to lightly coat the chips with olive oil.  Also I began by using regular seasoning salt or a Cajun seasoning blend; however, I find the kale is so light and doesn't really have a strong flavor so it lends itself to whatever spices you may like.  (My bunch of kale was too much for one baking sheet, so I made several batches.  One flavor combo that I tried that I thought worked well was a light dusting of cinnamon and sugar; it's kind of like kettle kale chips.)  My teenage brother liked them- I didn't tell him they were kale, just chips- and my two and a half year old kept sneaking more chips into her bowl.  I think this would be awesome for parties.

I don't usually like kale but this recipe is very tasty.  I used Mrs. Dash extra spicy seasoning and just 1/4 t. salt since I try to watch my sodium.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Simple recipe. I used sea salt instead, I would recommend waiting until they're done to sprinkle with salt. They were a bit salty.

This works BEAUTIFULLY with a food dehydrator.  I kept burning my kale with this method, so I went to the local thrift store and dropped $5 for a 3 tier dehydrator and have kept it in use ever since... I follow the same directions (using spray olive oil on kale) add garlic salt, then put them in the dehydrator for the better part of a day and voila, they're done.  They store nicely in a zippy bag, and my boys love to take these to school for lunch snacks!

Great tasting. 4 stars as written. 5 with a lowered baking temperature for a slower (longer time) bake resulting in crispy chips all the way through without burning.

I don't like Kale but I LOVE these. I buy bagged kale ( already cut up) the curlier the better. spread out on baking sheet lined with foil. spray with butter spray like a pam or crisco on bottom and on top of spread out kale then sprinkle generously with parmesan cheese. was setting at 400 degrees in toaster oven for about 10 minute but the key is first they will turn a bright green color and they will be soggy - not done you want them to be a very dark green almost black/green without burning (a few darker edges are fine and good so don't be scared). I tried 350 for longer( watching color as my indicator and they worked nicely. home sick 7 year old loved them. wow that is saying something- if you can get them crisp u will love them too just leave them in long enough without getting to burnt. dark blackish green is key. can re sprinkle with park cheese for extra taste.

Delicious - you really can't stop eating these! Rather than drizzle the olive oil over the kale I added the olive oil and kale to a bag and shook it up - this helps distribute the oil more evenly.

I didn't put the olive oil or the seasoned salt on it and they turned out wonderful. I didn't spray with anything either.   The taste was great.  I think if I wanted a bit more, I would use something like Mrs. Dash in different flavors as the mood strikes.    And you can't beat 34 calories a cup .5 grams fat 29 mg sodium.  And the flavor was much better than a greasy potato chip.

One Word - YUM - These are so good!  I used the Mazola Olive Oil spray and just quickly sprayed the leaves and then only use 1/4 tsp seasoning salt with 1/8 tsp garlic powder for one bunch of Kale.  Delish ONE BIT OF WARNING THOUGH.... IF YOU ARE ON BLOOD THINNERS YOU SHOULD AVOID KALE AS IT IS HIGH IN VITAMIN K AND CAN CAUSE ISSUES WITH YOUR BLOOD!  So Hubby can't have them, but he loved them till I googled Kale and found that out.  In the mean time - more for the rest of us.

This sounds a little bizarre so I had to try it!  They were great and my 2 year- old loved them!  Instead of sprinkling the olive oil and seasoned salt on I put the kale in a bowl, poured a mixture of the two over it, and stirred until the leaf pieces were coated.  This seemed to ensure that the application was even.

Yum, yum and yum.  What a great twist on an appetizer for guests or to offer around home.  My husband and 4 year old LOVE them!  Must make sure none of the chips are moist or your whole bowl will go limp as they sit together so I toss with tongs a couple times during cooking and increased cooking time as needed.

I have to give credit where it's due... I took this recipe & the tips from reviewer Jennie and was able to NAIL kale chips on my first foray. I did as the original poster Lucy said, I also(as Jennie suggested) put the pieces peak up & rotated my baking sheet(I know my oven cooks unevenly, as most do) half way through. I did wish the recipe was a little more detailed as to how much oil & salt to use per piece so I will offer this: I barely touched the tip of the brush to each piece, they were certainly not fully "covered" in oil, just lightly brushed. I think I dipped the brush 4 times for an entire standard cookie sheet. I ground some sea salt and used just a few pinches (4?) for the entire tray, that is certainly a "use to taste" measurement but there really isn't much needed. My husband who is very remiss to sample any of my health food ventures really liked them. My 3 year old boy wasn't gaga, but still ate them. My 2 year old girl housed them & asked for more. I have to guess the negative reviews are due to operator error? All in all, DELICIOUSNESS!

These were great! The only thing I did differently was turn the oven down to 300 degrees, skip the parchment paper, and then after cooking the 10-15 min, turn the oven down to 200 degrees and cook for another 10-15 min to get them crispier.

I love this stuff! It's sooo simple and quick, a great replacement for potato chips, with endless potential variations (vinegar, minced garlic our garlic powder, different kind of salt....). It can take a little practice to get the perfect ratio of oil to oven temperature to time in the oven, but it's worth it: this fall I was able to make kale a staple because suddenly I knew what to do with it! Tip: the kale chips are easily stored in an airtight container in a cool dry place. You can try to get them extra crisp by popping them back in the oven, but they burn even faster the second time around! Do not refrigerate or they will get soggy.

My husband and I both enjoyed these- the kids didn't, but they are fussy, so they don't get a say...haha-  these are yummy and healthy :) Thanks for the recipe! Kale is a new veggie in our house and so far, it's a keeper.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked eating them.  They're crispy and just kind of melt in your mouth.  That along with the taste of the yummy olive oil (I just drizzled, so I'm sure I used more than 1 Tbsp.) and salt (I used kosher). What you're left with is the after taste of having just eaten collard greens, which is to be expected...I mean, it's kale!  And I like collard greens.    On the down side, your kitchen will be pretty stinky while they're cooking...which I didn't read in any of the other reviews that I read...so be warned!  I got a few interesting comments from my teen-aged son!  Let's just say it's very "cabbagy" smelling and leave it at that!    So, my take away...I'd make them again...but not quite a 5 star recipe.

I'm kind of iffy about these. I made them for a picnic -- I baked them the night before, and they were crispy (in a paper-thin, crumbly way) when they came out of the oven, but by the time they were served, they had lost their crunch. on one hand, it was a blessing because they didn't crumble into dust after taking a bite, but they were a lot less like "chips" than when fresh out of the oven. they also had a somewhat bitter taste to them, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. they were eaten, but not devoured, and my fellow picnic-goers seemed equally iffy about them. I'm not sure how helpful this review was, but that's how the kale chips worked out for me. I don't think I'd make them again, unless they were requested.

I didn't follow the exact amounts of ingredients I just eye balled it and substituted the salt with seasoned salt and added garlic powder. . They were the perfect snack to crush my chips cravings... A girl friend of. Mine says she puts her chips on a wire rack on the baking sheet so that they crisp the whole chip and there is no need to flip them.  I haven't tried that yet but it seems like a great idea :)

I love this as a base recipe for my kale chips.  I'm trying to eat more paleo-style food and this works well.  I usually shred the kale leaves from the stem by hand first, put in a bowl and mix with slightly melted coconut oil by hand.  I then add garlic powder, onion powder and either liquid smoke or chipotle powder (a little of each of these goes a LONG way and you don't need to add both, chose just one or the other).  I cook at 350 for about 8 minutes and then check on them.  There's a fine line between too soft kale chips and burnt kale chips.  You'll know they are just right when they are a dull dark green.  Shiny and they are still soft.  Brown/black and they are burnt.

I don't put the salt on (Himalayan Pink Salt) until I take them out of the oven and they are still hot.

Addicted! Why haven't I made this sooner? I made this twice. For my first batch, I didn't dry my kale thoroughly enough so it ended up steaming. I left it in the oven a bit longer to crunch it up more, but it was still half soggy half burnt. For my second batch, I dried the kale overnight; skipped the parchment paper; rubbed the oil into the leaves with my fingers. Baked for 10 mins. Absolutely perfect. Nice and crunchy.

Have to add my 2 cents here! Read all the reviews last nite. Washed dinosaur (lacinato, tuscan) kale ahead of time so it was completely dry, tore into potato chip size pieces, tossed with 1 t (not 1 T)olive oil, couple pinches of creole seasoning, and a healthy amount of nutritional yeast (for the cheesy umami flavor). Squished it around with my hands to coat everything evenly. Using insulated pans, first batch took 12 min; once the pans were hot just about 10 min at just slightly below 350. Perfection! My garden is giving me kale like crazy, so I made 4 2 pan batches. At $6 for a small bag of kale chips at the store, I have about $60 worth!

Since I was using the salad spinner to wash the Kale, I poured in the oil (after washing) and spun it around, great way to evenly coat with oil!

Enjoyed by everyone - from the 2 year old grandkids to their great-grandparents!
After rinsing the kale I use a salad spinner to dry it. I tear the leaves into fairly large pieces and toss them with a very little bit of oil in large bowl. My trick is to arrange the leaves on a wire cooling rack set into a cookie sheet. I sprinkle them with a bit of seasoning salt and bake at 350 for 8 minutes and then check frequently, taking them out of the oven just before I think they're done. I serve them in a wicker basket while still warm and at their crunchy best. They must be eaten immediately but it's fast to pop another pan into the oven.
I've also served these alongside main dishes.

I love Kale chips! The first time I made them I tossed them with olive oil. It was way too much. Less is more with this recipe. I bought a Misto and tried again. They came out perfect. I like to sprinkle a little cheese (Parmesan, Asiago, Romano blend) on top before cooking and just add a little salt. So good!

These are a great, healthy substitute for potato chips!! The only problem I had with this recipe is that it calls for way too much salt. The first batch I made came out extremely salty. On the next batch, I used only a pinch of salt. They turned out perfect for my tastes. Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious! I've been buying the kale chips from health food stores for a while now but they run about 7 or 8 bucks for a small bag so I decided to try and make my own and this recipe worked out great! The first batch was a little burnt because I wasn't watching them close enough but since then they have all been perfect. I also add some nutritional yeast to give them a cheesy flavor yumm the only problem for me is that they're addicting!

My sister told me about this great new healthy snack she's been making and coincidently it was the recipe of the day a couple of days ago.  Figuring there is something to this I tried it and WOW! The only thing is changed was used very minimal sea salt in place of the seasoned salt because I didn't wanna cover the flavor of the kale.  My hubby and step daughter who don't touch green vegetables with a ten foot pole fought over the last few pieces. I made another batch the day after because they were just that good! 4/25 update: I have made this over a dozen times now.  I find it helps to add the salt to the olive oil in a big bowl so you have better control of how much salt you are using. Then add kale to the bowl and mix with your hands to help evenly distribute the oil and salt.

I made these as  "halftime snack" for my husband and I and we loved them! Try spraying hemp or flaxseed oil and using sea salt to make them even healthier. You'll have a bettter result if you ensure the pieces are about the same size and mix the leaves 1/2 way through cooking time.

I grew up hating kale. Now I look forward to eating it, if it's made this way. The texture is really nice, with such a light crispness that it shatters and practically disintegrates in an instance. My 4 yr old would eat all of the baked kale chips if we let him. My 1 yr old with only 2 teeth gets mad if we don't give it to him quickly enough when he points to it. These are great "munchies," perfect for snacking or accompanying burgers or sandwiches. I use more seasonings than the recipe calls for, "eye-balling" it rather than measuring. I also hand-toss the kale with the oil and seasonings in a bowl, before placing on the pan. My whole family loves this stuff.

I loved this method of cooking; my kale chips turned out great. I just suggest to all to make sure when putting these away in a container to allow a little bit of air to still get to them. They stay extra crunchy! (:

Per another reviewer's advice, I upped the temp and turned the oven off halfway through. They were crisp and perfect. I have trouble sharing them after.

Did first batch exactly as recipe calls for except sprayed on the olive oil rather than drizzling (per the poster's follow-up review). After 9 minutes, I had ashes. Kale-flavored ashes. Next batch was for only 7 minutes at 340 and only a few were burned, mostly the smaller pieces. So I guess that is what I will stick with and just be extra-sure that pieces are uniform in size. Flavor was pretty good; might try some other seasonings to spice it up next time.

I've tried this recipe, but my husband likes things spicy. So I put the kale in a large bowl, drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle lightly with seasoned salt; black pepper; onion powder; garlic powder and red pepper flakes. Toss well to distribute seasoning. Then I bake it till crispy. He loves it!

Always on the lookout for recipes my kids will like...my 14 year old son tried one then asked for a plate full! I tried them with salt the first time and my 10 & 12 year old boys said "pretty good", but after trying with seasoned salt they liked them better. My 8 year old tried one then shoved a bunch in her mouth. Her response: "they taste better one at a time!" SO easy and healthy. IMPORTANT: PUT THE SALT ON AFTER BAKING for a better result!!! Thanks for a great idea LucyDelRey! UPDATE!: I'm not changing anything, just realized that I forgot to mention how I put the oil on: I drizzle just a little olive oil on the leaves, then using my fingers I rub it around on all the leaves. This way you don't get too much oil on them making them soggy. Put them on parchment paper on a baking sheet for 10 minutes, sprinkle with salt and whatever else suits your fancy and...voila! Super healthy and very addictive snack - guilt free!

Everyone in my house loves these, they barely last a day every time I make them! I find that it's best to go easy on the salt, as using the amount given in the recipe can be a little much, but everyone's different and the kale itself always turns out perfect :)

I am a potato chip and anything salty addict.  However I made my first baked kale chips today and I have found my new potato chip.  They are fabulous and are crisp and salty and good for me.  I made the whole bunch of kale into kale chips and ate them all.  The next time I will purchase two or three bunches of kale and just bake chips.  They are wonderful.  I baked them for 12 minutes and it was perfect.  Love these..

I made sure Kale was very dry, added a little oil, shook in bowl & then tossed with my hands to ensure even coverage.  Sprinkled with salt & garlic power (will try many other suggestions from here next!) and baked on COOKIE COOLING RACKS to ensure air flow.  I baked at 340 for 8 min 1st batch, 7 min second batch. Amazing.

To remove stem from Kale, hold 1 leaf in left hand, fingers lightly around leaves near the base where leaf ends on stem, almost to stem. Grab stem with right hand & pull.  wal-la!

Hmmm. I enjoyed the crispy ones, but they didnt come out "even", so some were not crispy and some were, and the ones that weren't crispy were not good. I would reccommend using a spray oil...I drizzled oil and it was soggy in places and dry in places. I am going to try again and perfect it a little more next time.

Rather than using scissors and "carefully cutting" the leaf from the stem, I learned this quick trick:  Grasp the base end of the stem, and with the other hand, 'choke up' where the leaf starts and push the leaf up the stem to the end.  At the point that the stem becomes too weak, it will break, and you'll have a lovely ruffled piece with just a bit of tender stem.

These are tasty, and a creative way to use up kale from the CSA box.  I've had better luck baking at 300 degrees for about 15 minutes, and also using a perforated pizza pan or putting the kale on a cooling rack on a sheet pan.

This is quite yummy as is, but I like it even more with grated parmesan cheese sprinkled on top one minute before it's finished cooking.  My 7 year old eats this like it's candy!  You seriously cannot imagine how good this is until you try it.  You can play around with spice combinations too.  Chili powder and garlic powder are both good on it too.

Be SURE to line the cookie sheet.  This seems to be the trick to getting it to crisp up nicely.  You can try silver foil if you don't have parchment paper.

I make this all the time.  It's good warm and cold! I cheat and use pre-packaged/cleaned kale.  Have also done this with other strong greens (mustard), and good too.  Kale, however, rules!

I made these today.  They only took 8.5-9 minutes in my oven & you have to really watch them because they are not good when burnt.  You can actually take them out of the oven at 8 minutes and let them cook for an additional minute or two on the pan.  I have found that this works brilliantly!  I also used garlic salt for seasoning & my thirteen year old gobbled them up!

did not like these. the texture was weird (to me); the "chips" are so frail that if you are not really really careful, they shatter between your fingers before you get a chance to throw them in your mouth. Another word of caution: do not use too much salt (although it might not seem like you are using a lot, keep in mind that the huge pile of green kale leaves you start with will become veryy little after they dehydrate)

My family tried this last night (four of us) and they were great!!!!
I used sea salt instead of seasoned salt (NO MSG) and they were a huge hit! Some us tried a bit of spray on balsamic vinegar and love those too (tastes a little like salt and vinegar potato chips. I will be making this many more times. I didn't have any parchment paper so I just used my cookie sheet. I did cut them with kitchen shears  soaked them in cold water for about 10 minutes because mine were a tad wilted then into the salad spinner and set out on paper towel until thoroughly dried then mixed the olive oil and sea salt to the kale in a bowl. They did take approximately 20-25 minutes in a 350 degree oven watched carefully. They are FANTASTIC. there was not one left over!

I liked these a lot.  I used a cookie sheet and placed a cooling rack on top to enable even crisping.  Tore the kale up in bite sized pieces, sprayed both sides with Pam and lightly salted.  Oven temp 375 for 8 minutes and they were just crisp.

Fantastic! Even my super picky boyfriend who claims he doesn't like kale gobbled these up! I don't find the need for the olive oil though. All I do is spray a pan with some organic olive oil spray, place the torn kale on the pan, then sprinkle with a generous helping of ground pepper and himalayan salt. Mine are perfect in 11 minutes at 375. However, ovens are finicky, my bfs oven they are ready in 10 minutes at 350. If you have an oven light, turn it on and keep a close eye starting around 9 minutes. This is so healthy and delicious, I make these at least twice a week. Thanks Lucy!

I didn't use salt. I also used regular ol' cooking spray. Ho-ly goodness! These are so deliciously addictive; why do we even buy potato chips?!

I gave this 5 stars because this is my new favorite snack. I ran into a few problems but will make this again. I used kosher salt and it turned out WAY to salty. Next time I will season it differently. I had this once with garlic and crushed macadamia nuts on the kale. I will try that next time. I was surprised that a tablespoon of olive oil coated the entire bunch of kale. I used my hands to toss the kale. That helped. I also had to bake this a little longer than 15 minutes to make sure there were no wilted damp parts. KEEP CHECKING when baking this, sometimes the kales looks wet and it's dry.  I can't wait to make this again.

Made these for the first time tonight after seeing a TED rx series on how important Kale is to your diet. Should eat three cups a day. I dried them with a paper towel, tossed in olive oil not quite a tbls. in a quart bag then lightly sea salted and added garlic seasoning parchment paper on a cookie sheet. I cooked for 6 minutes turned them and then 5 minutes @ 310.  The first batch went within 5 minutes by my two kids, 11 & my 13 year old who does not eat anything green. My son begged for more and helped make them and my husband and I ate just as quickly.  Easy way to get three cups of kale in you. Super fast, super easy.  Highly recommend.

Tried a different recipe on my first attempt at kale chips. This recipe is much better.  I washed the kale the night before & left it to air dry on the counter (from the 1st attempt I realized the kale has to be as dry as possible). Then the next day I trimed & cut it to size. Sprayed it with olive oil (using an oil spritzer) instead of drizzling with the oil; this coats the kale evenly.  Used a whole kale bunch and cooked them in three batches.

These were inedible...yes, there's a good chance that I messed up the recipe, but nevertheless, the taste was so bland and so burnt.

Absolutely delicious!! The only thing I did differently was to drizzle some balsamic vinegar on when I drizzled on the olive oil, and then I sprinkled them with sea salt.  YUM!!!  These are even better than potato chips and it makes me want to go pick some more Kale!  Maybe my family will get some of the next batch...

Delicious but watch the bake time. Mine take 7 - 9 minutes with about a 30 second window from perfect to burnt. Also try different flavor combos like sea salt and vinegar, parmesan or cayenne.

Sooo good.  Joined a CSA and was looking for ways to try veggies that I didn't normally eat and was delighted with this one.  Who knew I liked Kale?!

In an attempt to find more healthy snacks for my family I decided to give these a try.  I can't imagine how people say these taste like potato chips...they had an aftertaste & tasted nothing like potato chips.  My two year old kept trying to eat them, I guess she thinks anything called a "chip" must be good.  I'm not sure if it was the texture or taste, no matter, we will not be trying these again.

Localfoodmama took the words right out of my mouth. They go from crispy to burnt in seconds and come out unevenly. I tried other seasonings as well. Sea salt on one batch, onion powder on another. The onion was pretty good but my kids hated them all and the after taste was not all too pleasant. I'm going to try my dehydrator before giving up on this one and see how that goes. I may add them to soup..or something, but not a very good snack item.

These were very good, but they have to be eaten warm and fresh out of the oven (which is what I did).  As they cool, they become chewy (which is what my fiance came home to).

These were very good. I made three batches. One with the seasoned salt (I over salted but still good) one with soy sauce and one with balsamic vinegar. The vinegar one was my favorite but they were all wonderful!

I was really hoping these would be good. I can tolerate a very wide range of foods (from durian to eel!), but these were definitely not appetizing for me. The texture was just off. At first I thought maybe I baked them too long, but I made them two more times and they still weren't appetizing.

Loved this!  To evenly coat the leaves, I put the leaves in a bowl, added the olive oil and salt and shook it up in the bowl after placing a lid on top.  Throughout the cooking time, I "sampled" a piece every couple of minutes to check it's progress and had no trouble finding the right cooking time.  I added a bit of balsamic vinager in my second batch and really liked the result.

I read all the wonderful reviews for this, and thought they'd be awesome!  I'd never tried cooked kale before, only raw.  I didn't find the taste pleasing at all.  It reminded me a bit of cooked spinach.

I don't have a salad spinner so I did my best drying the kale- laid it out on paper towels squeezed most of the moisture away from washing. /I put the kale in a large bowl and tossed well with olive oil.  Spread it out on pan patting it down to get it even- sprinkled with garlic salt.  I didn't have any trouble with the baking time- I started checking it after 7 mins per other reviews but it didn't crisp until 15.  I was surprised but the kiddos LOVED it- ages 6 and 9!  Great salty snack.

So easy, so amazing. I crave salty snacks, especially when I watch TV. This is a guilt-free snack that tastes great and satisfies my craving!  The only thing I would suggest is actually tossing the kale with your hands in order to really coat them instead of drizzling. I've also put it in a ziploc bag and tossed it that way.

It's a little wasteful-- ANY stem part comes out chewy instead of crispy-- but delicious.  My one year old and I gobbled up an entire batch.  (Those I brushed with olive oil were tastier than those I sprayed with cooking spray.)

I'm in shock right now. Shock. So good.   They just came out of the oven - they crumble in your mouth and the seasoned salt totally hits the spot for that salty snack craving.   I just put more in the oven with a little bit of garlic powder as well.   Awesome!

Holy Cow! We joined a CSA and get fresh produce delivered to our home each week. Somewhat random, the box this week came with Kale - a food I have never purchased nor eaten. (I think I have seen it used as a garnish in restaurants). We tried this recipe, and even my super-picky eater ate it! If a ten-year old , who lives for mac-n-cheese and chicken nuggets willingly eats a veggie, and asks for more, I call this recipe a WINNER! I had a small amount leftover, kept in a Ziploc baggie and it was (barely) edible the next day. Defiantly best hot and fresh from the oven.

I just made these and ate the whole tray! My 14 month old daughter, surprisingly, liked them too! They are fun to eat, crunchy, and if you add salt give you the same satisfaction as popcorn or potato chips... Love it!!

Made this for the first time today and it turned out great!!! I didn't have a salad spinner so I just blotted with a paper towel and that seems to have worked just fine. My chips are crunchy not soggy! Cooked for 12 min. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I only had enough parchment paper for one cookie sheet. So one of my pans didn't have any on it. I tossed the kale in the oil & seasoned salt, as the brand new mister I bought does not work, despite reviewers tips :-/ I thought the seasoning salt was too much salt. The kale chips on the paper were definitely better. Next time I will make sure I have enough parchment paper but I think I will season the chips after they cook instead of before.

Yumm! I felt like I was eating junk food but it was just super good greens! My kale was done at 7 minutes, in my oven.

I have no shame in saying that I literally scarf these kale chips and no matter how much I make it is never enough and I can't shove them in my face fast enough.  I love lacinato (dinosaur) kale in my juice recipes but I had so much this year I didn't know what to do with the rest.  I found this recipe and these chips have been on my lunch menu for a straight month.  It took two times for me to perfect my salt preference.  I mastered the taste by adding Trader Joe's South African Smoke spice blend.  Exquisite!  Thank you for the recipe!

A co-worker brought kale chips to a potluck office picnic and I was looking for the recipe! (These definitely got me off of my potato chip cravings...so yummy!) Everything about this recipe is great but I would definitely check the 'chips' at around 7 minutes (I have an average electric stove, no bells or whistles).  I kept them in for the 10 minutes and some had gone brown (not tasty at all).  Also just use your fingers to pull the weak leaf part (the part for the chip) away from the veins.  This made things quick and easy and for the chips that weren't overcooked, they were yummy.  Also, I used Lowrey's seasoning salt.  Yay I can eat well and still think I am eating junk food this recipe is so good!

Wow! So easy and delicious! 
I didn't have parchment paper, so just placed directly on the cookie sheet. It still worked well for me. 
I used organic kale and organic olive oil. I put my olive oil in a spray pump so was able to evenly distribute the oil, on both sides of the kale. Overall easy and tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

Way better than I thought they'd be. Nice and crisp. I added pepper & roasted ground cumin to the recipe. Baked for 10 minutes in a convection over and they came out perfect. Husband loved them, kids not so much...but they are very fussy eaters.

I have made this recipe twice. The second time was a real success. The best tip I can give is to first mix the kale (already cut into bite size pieces) in a big bowl, add the olive oil and then use both of your hands to mix in the oil. This will ensure that all kale chips have an even amount of oil, and they will also be evenly cooked.

I am all about a good ol bag of chips, the first batch did not make it to the serving plate. I llike how you can add your own flavor to it. My favorite our my sour cream and onion seasoning and my wise garlic salt seasoning. Definitely remove the stems ??

Very good. Best when eaten right away while still crispy. They don't keep well in airtight container, this rehydrates them. Mine were done in 8-9 minutes. Why 425 degrees? Might 350 work just as well and lower the chance of burning? Mine began to turn brown at the outer edge of cookie sheet after 9 minutes (at 425).

Made them just like the recipe said…cooked for about 12 minutes and they came out perfect! So good to satisfy the crunch you're craving. I added some salt and garlic salt both times I made them and they're delicious!

This recipe far exceeded my expectations! I've tried prepackaged kale chips before and did not enjoy them, so I was pretty skeptical. I made a very small batch, tossed them in olive oil as suggested by previous reviewers, sprinkled with garlic salt, and baked at 350 for about 9 minutes. They were delicious! Be careful with your seasoning though, a little goes a long way! Thanks for the awesome recipe! I will be making these again!

Surprisingly good!  I'd never had kale before and it had a pleasant 'green' flavor. I added white cheddar popcorn seasoning to the kale along with the salt and oil. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of baking on a wire rack at 250 degrees for 20 minutes which worked great. The kale was still a pretty green color, not browned. I put most of the kale on the wire rack but I had some extra and just put that on the cookie sheet.  The kale on the rack did indeed cook/dry much better.

I've bought kale chips before at the store but hate that 7-8 dollar price.  Finally got the nerve to try these and SHAZAM!! 1st tray was so amazingly good I ate it in 30 seconds.  That was only 1 big leaf though, more is being baked as we speak...  My husband liked the taste, just not the texture as they are VERY light and crumble easily.  300 degrees for 11 minutes was perfect.  Use the parchment & make sure to salt AFTER so they aren't soggy.  I used a mix of 2/3 EVOO & 1/3 EV Citrus and Habanero Olive oil in my Pampered Chef mister (I get it from Sapori Oils - you can go online for multiple flavour varieties)  I just wish it took up less space in the oven so I could do the whole batch of kale at once.

Not that it is the best thing in the world - the reason I gave this a 5 is because I HATE kale and I really really enjoyed these chips!!  Doesn't have a kale taste and it is crunchy and I love crunchy.  I sprayed with miso olive oil and used sea salt, garlic & onion powder.

Yummy

First time I ever made this. From the reviews of my guests, making sure it was completely dry before baking was the key to crispy kale. So good! I added chili pepper flakes. I love the simplicity, tastiness and healthiness of this dish!

These are so light & airy, they seem like they could just dissolve in your mouth! I used the recipe submitter's suggestion and sprayed pam on the leaves instead of using oil. Love them! Will make again.

This is a nice recipe. It is a very healthy and creative idea to make leafy greens into chips, and it tastes great as long as you are careful. For one, make sure you use FRESH kale, because it will go bad in a few days, and you don't want that to happen. Second, be sure to cut the kale into small enough pieces that will bake up crispy. The texture is important. Be sure you have "seasoned salt", because it's pretty hard to substitute. This recipe would also be a lot easier if you had a salad spinner to do all the washing for you. Nice recipe!

My teenaged daughter loves these as much as I do. We split a tray when we  make them and they don't last long between us. I've never had any leftovers so I can't speak to how well they keep.

Only thing I changed was that I use a sprayer for the olive oil. It coats more evenly and I avoid limp spots. I also recommend filling the tray so that there isn't any open areas. And, place the kale curls up. I bake them for exactly 10 minutes and never get soggy or burnt chips.

I also recommend trying different seasonings. I like non-salt seasoning mixes and they taste great on these chips.

So I made the first batch, followed another reviewers suggestions and turned my dish 180 degrees for best crispness.  I had to make another batch for my family to try.  OMG DELICIOUS!  I can see how adding different spices will enhance them even more.  Look out potato chips!

Very surprising!! Tastes a lot like a potato chip. I used an olive oil spray and seasoned with se salt, garlic powder and onion powder. These are a GREAT substitute for those following low-carb diets! Thanks!

NOM. I borrowed a trick from another recipe and used a bag to shake the kale in the olive oil. In addition to Vegesal (salt-type-thingy) I used some garlic and parsley granules (from the Latino section of the grocery store) and it was fantastic.

These had waaaaay to much seasoned salt! I had thought about starting with 1/2 tsp. I so wished I would have. I couldn't get passed all the seasoning salt to the taste. They do have a neat crispiness though, I can say, even though they evoke no taste. They almost melt in the mouth. The kale I have came pre-chopped. If making into chips make sure to remove the hard stem parts. Also, the size of the chip or snack will be about half the size of each one after cooking. Start with 1/4 tsp of salt, more can always be added. Not something I would make again, but at least I can say I tried them.

These are sooo yummy. The Kale pieces should be on the bigger size and really watch them in the over, because they go from limp to overcooked in seconds.

I've been wanting to try this for a while! I drizzled mine with olive oil and mixed the kale pieces around with my hands until they were all evenly coated & I checked the texture of them in the oven every five minutes or so and ended up with crispy chips... no soggy or burnt spots! I've never had kale before and I will say these are a healthier option than a chip, you def get your salty/crunchy fix with this, but I'm not sure if I liked these enough to make them again. They tasted almost like broccoli. Id consider making them if I wasn't eating carbs and needed something salty though.

I tried out this recipe thinking this was going to be a great substitute to chips at my house and my husband warned me that kale only belongs in the buffet display. Well I wanted to prove him wrong and so I set out to make this and added Parmesan cheese, lemon pepper seasoning, and dash of salt. I gently tossed the cut up kale in the olive oil and thought how wonderful this will be!  After baking two trays of it I had to toss it in the trash! I could not stand it! Don't think I don't like healthy veggies, I love them but this left a bad taste in the mouth and I was very disappointed,

Wonderful easy, healthy snack. Careful not to overcook and go easy on the oil. Just until they are shiny.

Didn't think I was going to like these.  Boy was I wrong - loved them!  Super easy to make and the crispy taste is wonderful.  I'm making again this weekend.  Thanks Lucy for sharing your recipe.

This is now a staple in our house. We buy kale often and it is such a quick easy snack but so healthy for you, you never have to feel guilty. We have made these with so many different toppings- garlic salt, Parmesan cheese, soy sauce, cayenne pepper, cumin and curry powder- the options are endless. Just make sure they are spread apart well on the parchment and that they are crunchy to the touch. It is easy to burn them if you have softer kale, but nice fresh crisp kale come out perfect every time

In an effort to find more healthy snacks we tried these. If you eat them expecting a broccoli taste you will be o.k. Don't expect anything close to a chip. It's like comparing a steak to a vegetarian substitute. Imagine something totally unexpected.

These are amazing! 1 teaspoon salt was too much for me, so I dropped down to 1/4 teaspoon and they were really wonderful. I shake it all up in a gallon ziplock bag so everything coats really well.

Yikes!  Waaaaay too salty!  Also I kept checking on them and they didn't look burnt or even brown really but when I took them out after 15 min, they were totally burnt.  I'd like to try them again, but next time I will probably only bake them for 5-8 minutes and I will use only a pinch of kosher salt.

The easiest way to cover the kale with the oil is to put the prepared kale in a ziploc bag with olive oil, close the seal and "massage" the oil into the kale. Sprinkle with whatever seasonings you enjoy after removing kale from bag

Tried the kale chips and I did not care for them. All I can say is that anybody that thinks this is like a potato chip has never had a potato chip. They have a salty taste but just kind of fall apart in your mouth.  I made them several ways different kook times and seasonings, Still did not work. My wife liked them.

My family gave this a try with the hope that we might like it and it would be good for us.  Even my husband who eats many green vegetables did not like it. It has a very strong dark green aftertaste.

I'm hooked!!!  I baked mine for 10 minutes and they turned out perfect.  Lightly sprayed with olive oil using my misto sprayer, and then drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  I waited until after they were done to sprinkle with sea salt.  They tasted like a salt and vinegar chip!

This is an excellent treatment of kale!  So light, crispy, and delicious.  I ate the first batch by myself.  After I took a second batch out of the oven, I sprinkled some powdered vinegar over the still-hot chips. I had ordered the powdered vinegar online a while ago for homemade potato chips. The kale chips had a great zippy salt-n-vinegar taste.  It's difficult trying to stop eating them!

I loved these and ate the whole pan.  However, based on others reviews I didn't salt them enough and found myself salting them more after they came out of the oven.  I think I also was worried they would be over cooked and took them out too early.  My kids didn't like them at all...they are still vegetables.  My hubby said they were okay and wouldn't mind trying them again if he had to.

I came to allrecipes to find a fish recipe.  As the website came up, the Baked Kale Chips recipe was right on the front page.  I clicked on it right away because I bought a ton of Kale yesterday for my green smoothies (and was glad to know there was something to use kale in other than my smoothies).  I already made the chips as a side for lunch and they were SUPER.  I warned my mom in advance that lunch was all experimental and she shockingly enjoyed the chips, too.  I washed the kale, shook it out and dried with a paper towel.  Because I didn't have parchment paper, I just put them right on a cookie sheet.  They were done in about 11 minutes.  The kale is easy to over salt so be careful.

The first batch went for 10 minutes and burned, and the second batch was in for 5 minutes and came out perfect. I used butter flavored Pam to coat them evenly, and pepper to taste. I think next time I'll use a different spice.  I hadn't realized kale was so strong, but I enjoy the flavor. We'll see what my family thinks. This is definitely something I'll make more often for a snack.

Followed the recipe and the advice to watch the chips closely toward the end is right on. I thought they were an interesting vegetable "adventure" and my guests ate them up.  But I think in the future I'll cook kale in the more traditional ways.

Mine turned out great.  I tossed them in a bowl with olive oil and spices, just enough to coat, not soak.  I placed them on a greased cookie pan, and baked at 330 degress for 10 minutes. They were not burnt at that time and temperature.  I sprinkled them with some seasoned salt at the end also.

Oh my!  I can't believe how addicting these are!  I never even had Kale, but just started looking for recipes to try it since it's just so darned good for you.  I stumbled upon this recipe and figured it would be a good way to introduce myself to Kale.  Didn't have parchment paper, but they crisped up just fine right on the baking sheet.  Kept a close eye on them to make sure they didn't burn.  Perfect.  THANK YOU!!

The first time I made this my children could not believe that it was kale.  This is a favourite in our home, my daughter now makes it all the time.  She works in a grocery store and someone came through her till with kale and commented on it, the customer couldn't believe she even knew what kale was.  As soon as she said what we make with it, she was so excited and wanted the recipe from my daughter.  It turns out that this person pays a lot of money buying it in the health food store.  She even went home and came back with a sample.  My daughter likes this recipe better than a store bought.

I'm not sure what to say about these.  They taste alright, kind of like roasted pumpkin seeds, but I didn't care for the texture.  I would say they are more brittle than crisp.  I'm glad I gave them a try, but I probably wouldn't bother making them again.

I cannot believe how awesome this is! It has quickly become a weekly favorite for me and my husband, and I've made it for guests and gotten rave reviews. I was skeptical at first but this is now the only way I make kale.   I have found a secret trick though that makes the preparation much easier. I have a spray bottle of grapeseed oil and meyer lemon oil that I use and when that runs out I will refill it with olive oil because the spray bottle makes it SO much easier to distribute the oil evenly without oversaturating it. Plus it's really fast! My mother in law loved this idea and bought a little spritzer to fill and does the same thing. She said she also tried this recipe with spinach and it worked great.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great snack!  Love this very basic recipe.  My kids said the results were a little like those salty nori sheets you can buy.   After drizzling the olive oil I rubbed it in a bit with my hands before tossing with salt.  I tried it without the parchment paper and had no issues sticking, even with a non-nonstick baking sheet.  Ripping the leaves from the stems is also a quick way to separate the two.

Just being able to snack without the guilt makes this a worthy recipe. These chips are delightfully crispy when baked the right way. My first batch I baked for 10 minutes - all the small leaves were baked well, but the larger ones remained limp, chewy, and bitter. After a couple more batches, I found that with my oven I needed to leave them in for a good 20 minutes. I find that the bitterness is barely noticeable with enough baking. When there is more moisture left behind, I found the chips to be more bitter - though I didn't mind the bitterness too much.  I added a sprinkle of garlic powder, salt, and white pepper. I'm excited to try other flavors!  This recipe is definitely worth a try.

Wow, this was very interesting, and surprisingly good!  I thought the flavor was kind of a cross between dried seaweed and roasted pumpkin seeds.  I sprayed the kale with olive oil cooking spray and lightly sprinkled with salt.  Most of them ended up crumbly on the edges but still chewy in the middle.  I would prefer them to be crisper in the middle but don't know how to do that without burning the edges.  Still, a yummy snack.  You can eat a whole bunch of kale this way without realizing it, because when it loses so much of its water content it isn't so bulky.  Kale is chock full of lutein, which is great for our eyes!

It's tough to make kale into something that just about anyone will eat - but this is it!  I baked them without the parchment paper, just because I didn't have any and found that the ones in direct contact with the cookie sheet actually came out tasting closer to potato chips!  GREAT recipe!  Thanks!!

I LOVED this idea! I tried it with spinach leaves though and garnished with some sea salt and a bit of garlic powder and they turned out delicious! I will definitely be experimenting more with this.

Tried it once per the original recipe. Now I make these all the time with some changes. I don't use parchment, lower the over to 280, spray them with plain or butter flavored cooking spray, then (and most importantly) grind cashews in a coffee grinder mixed with nutritional yeast, I then generously sprinkle it over the kale.  Have also tried it w\ just the yeast which was good also.

Wow!  Talk about satisfying your crunchy, salty, craving, this is addicting. I didn't drizzle the oil over the top I kind of tossed it through with a bit of sea salt, garlic powder and cayenne. Make sure you watch and taste periodically:) so it doesn't crumble on you.  Healthy and a great snack.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

My kids love these and I do too. Light, airy, they kind of melt in your mouth. I don't know how well they keep because we never have leftovers! I follow the recipe as written and make sure that the kale is totally dry before adding the oil and salt (I use sea salt). I also spread them on two pans in biggish pieces, with lots of space in between, and they get really crispy.

I am finishing up a batch of these now. I've had kale chips before but not like these, where it really is like eating a potato chip. My technique followed that of Gatorkidd's, who tossed the kale in a large bowl with tongs. She's right: it's so easy to overseason so use a light touch. I'm storing my chips in a container lined with dry paper towel and a tight-fitting lid. NOTE: Three days later, I find the stored "chips" are not crispy like they were fresh out of the oven. Since I had the oven on this morning, I stuck a cookie sheet with some of the chewy chips in the oven for two minutes and they got crispy again. Delicious and so satisfying!

I tried this receipe and loved it. Instead of drizzling with olive oil, I mixed the oil and sea salt in a container and dipped them to get full coat of coverage. Everyones oven is different so i get a crispy effect at 8 minutes. Still a great easy recipe that was a yummy snack. Enjoyed it with some home made blackbean and chickpea humus. Yummy!

I despise vegetables and all things green.  I dread eating them.  I forced myself to try these as part of a healthier eating effort.  I am shocked to report they are absolutely addictive.  I ate an entire pan of them.  They are not chips.  They do not resemble chips in any sense.  But they are really, really good if you want a crispy, salty snack.  The recipe works equally well on broccoli, another vegetable I used to despise.  Just make sure you cook them long enough that they're crispy.  It should feel like you've overcooked them a tad, but they're better that way.

Made this and was delicious. Key, I made mistake thinking the recipe called for too little oil. Was wrong, added more and should not have, but still was very tasty. Used as part of snack tray. Was a hit.

Wow!  What a great discovery.  you can tear the leaves off the stems and rip them into bite sized pieces, so utensils aren't even necessary.  Use a salad spinner to get the pieces dry dry dry. MGo light on the olive oil and salt when you toss them, it's easy to overdo it, especially the salt.  I use the convection setting on my oven and after the first 5 minutes I check on them frequently.  It's best if they are in a single layer so they all get crispy at the same time.  I've found that the smaller tender leaves crunch up the best.  When I think they're done, I turn off the oven, open the door half-way and let them sit a couple more minutes.  These heavenly chips will satisfy your crispy crunchy salty cravings every time!  Would love to know the nutrition value!  Thanks for a great idea!

This is the first kale chip recipe I ever used, and it is just a terrible recipe. The temperature is just wrong as is the time. You will always get soggy or burn chips. A much better recipe is kale very lightly coated in oil and only a light sprinkle of salt. bake at 300 degrees for 10 minutes, rotate the tray and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes.

This recipe is simple and delicious. I have best results if I tear, wash, and spin dry the kale on one day, then stick in the fridge for 1-5 days before I'm ready for chips. They continue to air dry in there. When I wash and dry then bake, they always have residual moisture and bake very unevenly.I don't find they keep well; they get soggy in a tupperware.

Such a great snack!  I used Pam olive oil to coat the leaves, I think it is much easier and you're able to coat it more evenly.  You can mix up the seasonings to your taste.  I found it easier to cut the leaves off last by taking the knife to go up and around the stem.

This is perfect snack for sitting on the couch and watching TV. Believe it or not, they are super addictive. Be careful with the season salt, it's very easy to over season and they may become a little too salty.

I used too much salt the first time but - wow! If you're looking for a healthy alternative to your usual snack items, these were great. Even my 14-year old munched on them. I will make again and again!

First time to try kale chips, so wasn't sure how it would turn out.  I dont like kale in a salad because of the bitterness....so was skeptical.  However, I love this recipe and thought they were absoloutely delish!  i added garlic powder, smoked paprika and some black pepper. put in for exactly 10 minutes then moved them around a bit and put back in the oven for 5 more minutes and every piece, every bite was absolute crispy deliciousness!  big hit for me!!

these were very good! I tried them once before and they did not turn out well at all. I tried again lowering the oven temp to 320, also using spray evo. The first batch I used ranch dressing mix, then sprinkled with parm. cheese. The second batch I used salt and cumin. They both turned out very good, hard to say witch ones I liked better, probably have to say the ranch and parm!! Will defintly make these again

I made 3 different flavors of these with: Tastefully Simple Seasoning Salt, Garlic powder, and Garlic powder with parsley.  Got people to try them that made faces until they tasted them then they were pleasantly surprised.  I think when I get down a bit more I am going to crunch them up to sprinkle on soup, stew, scrambled eggs, baked potatoes, and whatever else I can think of.

I loved the delicate crispness and good flavor, and it only took 20 minutes! My only warning: there is a bit of an aftertaste and you might want to brush your teeth after eating.

The first time I made them, they were too salty for me so I adjusted the salt the second time around and regarding salt, they were much better. The problem I experienced was trying to get the Kale dry enough to get crisp,  and then found it a lot of work to continually monitor it in the oven and turn them so they were crisp enough. It just wasn't worth the effort for the end result.  I didn't find them tasty even those that were crisp.  I do enjoy Kale soup however on the package of the pre-washed Kale.  Update as of May 2018,  the  review given by gatorkidd dated Feb 5 2013 had the best instructions for this recipe and they turned out much better however, they still aren't that tasty to me, they aren't attractive to serve and they don't stay crunchy unless eaten immediately. I really tried with this as I heard so many positive comments on how good kale is for you but I won't be making kale chips again.

Loved the result.  So so so good!  I used the really curly kale because i'd read the reviews and i checked the kale often in the oven.  I ended up baking them for 6 minutes at 350. The larger Pieces were crispy on the edges and softer in the middle, the smaller pieces were crispy and both very delicious.  4 stars because of the cooking time but everything else was fantastic!  I used the authors later recommendation of spraying with Pam instead of drizzling with oil, and i baked them on a rack so the air could circulate.  These are so delicious and i'm so glad their healthy!!  They do not taste like potato chips, so don't let that let you down, but they are very good none the less.  I can't wait to experiment with new flavors!!

This is my first time ever having Kale.  I bought a bunch to have in a soup I made and had leftover Kale, so I decided to try Kale Chips.  I am so glad that I did.  I loved them.  As the poster of this recipe suggested I sprayed them with Pam.  I also just sprinkled a very small about of Kosher salt on each one.  I baked for 10 min. on a parchment lined baking sheet. They were perfectly done.  They tasted like potato chips!  I will be making these again!  A very inexpensive and healthy snack! :)

I love the recipe, but prefer to use sea salt instead of seasoned salt. They are really tasty, and very different than other chips. Great for a gluten free snack! My husband wasn't really on board... so more for me! I used green kale, but hear that red kale (in Spring) is even better.

I had never even tried kale before I made this. I'm trying to eat healthier and I had lots of friends and family recommend trying kale chips. I used about 1.5 tbsp. of balsamic vinegar and kosher salt with the olive oil. I also have a food dehydrator and it came out perfectly and evenly, light and crispy without any issues of sogginess or burnt taste from the oven. I highly recommend using a food dehydrator. I probably salted slightly more than needed, but still yummy. I enjoy the  "nuttiness" from this snack. Next time I'm going to get a little more creative.

Be sure to use the right kale!  Use the thick leaves on the stems and don't make the same mistake I did by using the baby leaves from a bag.  Overall, it's great!

Instead of baking at 350 degrees, I set my oven on the lowest temperature (170 degrees and left them in for about three hours. I checked them each hour and gently rearranged them for even doneness. Perfect, no limp pieces and no burning!

Oh - this is going to be my new favorite obsession! I tried the first batch at a lower temp (based on reviews) Second batch I put back up to 350 as the recipe states - perfect!  Garlic salt, or garlic powder and cayenne (spicy) or just plain salt. Wonderful!  I sprayed with generic PAM instead of tossing in oil.  Awesome snack - super food good for you and a GREAT low cal (zero point) snack!  Thanks so much!

I bought two small bunches of kale, figuring I'd need both (and I did, but only had room for one of the bunches on my large pan).   I lined the pan with foil, spread out the pieces, sprayed lightly with olive oil, used a garlic and sea salt grinder to season them, and ended baking them about 20 minutes, using tongs to move them around and turn them every one to two minutes after the 10 minute mark.  My whole family was amazed at how (good) they tasted.  My 8 y.o. wanted to know how I could make them taste like tortilla chips!  Will make again soon!

I've made lots of kale chip in many different ways this is a good start but kind of plain. Try adding some nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor or honey and sea salt. If you have access to a dehydrator they are better but if cooking in the oven becareful they will burn very easily. I also use coconut oil instead of olive. One more thing make sure you use curly kale and not flat, the flat kale tends to be quite bitter. Bet you can't eat just one

Ok, I have heard a lot about Kale Chips, so I picked up some Kale today at Trader Joe's (they had a suggestion posted right beside them to use Coconut Oil and garlic salt).  So needless to say when I got home I searched Allrecipes for a good recipe and came across this one!  After reading some of the comments, I played with the temp just a little. I also used Trader Joe's suggestion and used Coconut Oil, drizzling just a little bit onto the Kale after taking off the center stalk and tossing them in a large bowl to make sure it was evenly covered.  After laying them out on the cookie sheet I lightly sprinkled them w/ Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt and put them into the oven, cooking it for 10 minutes @ 250, then turning up the oven to 350 and cooking them for another 10 minutes.  They turned out perfect.  I experimented with the seasoning, sprinkling a little section with garlic, another w/ smokey paprika, the third w/ cumin, and then the last one with cayenne pepper.  My favorite was the smokey Paprika and the Cumin.... I will be making these again. One thing I will do different next time is to make sure the pieces are larger, because they do shrink down.  Thanks for all of the comments, they were very helpful!!

This came out really good, i cooked at 375 for 15 minutes and used sea salt instead. I also added Parmesan cheese and a tablespoon of  cream with balsamic vinegar, came out sensational!!!

These are really good but you have to be careful and really watch them they can be fine one minute and be burnt the next.  But great recipe, yummy and a healthy alternative to chips if you have that craving.

This recipe turned my fiancé and I onto kale! Definitely take the time to dry the kale leaves after rinsing to obtain the perfect crisp in the oven. Usually I drizzle oil over the ripped kale chips on the parchment paper, but I think I will try the technique where I toss the olive oil and kale chips in a ziplock bag to get a more even coating. I also dust my fiancé's half of the baking sheet with cayenne pepper, since he likes it spicy. I've made this dish for football parties and it's been a hit every time.

These were enjoyed by all at my picnic. I would recommend keeping your pieces larger than smaller and spray olive oil lightly. Drizzling was hard to keep consistent.

Somewhere I read that putting these on a wire rack worked better.  I tried that and WOW!  Much better for the way I like chips.  I don't like some soggy and some crispy -- I want them ALL crispy!  I put the parchment paper over a deep-dish broiler and then the wire rack over that to ensure clean-up was a breeze.  When using the wire rack -- they're a little more difficult to remove if they're very curly leaves!  I also prefer the green kale because the red is even more bitter.  However, the red kale is a tad bit better for you than even the green.  Since I like mine crispy, I left them in for 15 minutes at 350.  Worked like a charm!  Whoever wrote that they need to be eaten the same day is correct though -- they're definitely better the first day.

Be sure to take time to massage the oil into each leaf of kale. I like to mix a little balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, and minced garlic twith the oil before massaging it in. Mmmm!

Perfect. The only thing I've played around with is using sea salt instead of seasoning salt, and I like to mix the kale with the salt and olive oil in a bowl before spreading it on the tray. I've also thrown in a tablespoon of Parmesan cheese before mixing it together.

I just made these today!  The texture is so delicate, and the flavor is a bit like brussels sprouts.  My husband and I enjoyed them with lunch.  I just used a seasoned cookie sheet without the parchment paper (since I don't have any). I had no problem with sticking or crisping.  I turned them around halfway through and they were done in 10 minutes, as papery thin little leaves of deliciousness.  I sprayed olive oil on, sprinkled seasoned salt, and added a few dashes of garlic powder for flavor.

I just made this tonight as an experiment and I can't stop eating this yummy recipe. It's  really good !! I made a promise to myself to try new foods and veggies in 2013.  This is my favorite snack so far. I can't believe what I have missed all these years and healthy eating is so easy. I love junk food, this is the best snack i have tried so far.

Awesome, simple and healthy. I didn't have parchment paper and looked for subs but didn't use anything.  Turned out great!  I cooked it for only 7 minutes and tossed in between.

I so wanted to like these. I really did! I had hoped that they could become a staple in our house as a healthy substitute for crunchy snacks. But I was very disappointed. To me, the taste was unpleasant and so was the texture. It was like eating delicate, wafer-thin, kale flavored paper. I have to say honestly that I'm not a big kale fan (no matter how it is cooked). I don't think it's a bad recipe, it's just not for us. But it's always good to try new things. So if you're curious, give it a try. Heck kale is pretty cheap and it doesn't take long to make a batch. And you never know you may like it. Lots of people do.

These have a beautiful deep green color when done in the dehydrator.  I will probably add a little spice to it next time but it is interesting and the flavor grows on you as you continue to "nibble just one more".

I actually didn't have any kale, so I used some leftover beet greens and radish leaves. It turned out delicious!! I also didn't have seasoned salt but used some sea salt instead. They were as good as or better than potato chips. I will definitely make again.

This is our favorite way to eat kale.  I make this every couple weeks with dinner. The cooking time on here is good- 12 minutes exactly is perfect for my oven, you just have to really watch it during those last 2 minutes as it will go from not quite done to burnt in the blink of an eye. My only change is we prefer using salt and garlic powder to season it instead of the seasoning salt.  I also find using the olive oil cooking spray to spray the kale is easier than drizzling the olive oil and keeps a fine, even coating over the leaves.

I love, love, love kale chips. But, I use far less oil, and I toss these in the dehydrator for a few hours, instead of the oven. You retain far more of those fantastic raw nutrients by using the dehydrator, and it turns out JUST as crispy, crunchy, yummy.

I used this basic recipe and, after the kale chips came out of the oven, very lightly sprinkled lemon juice over them (emphasis on Lightly - too much as the chips become soggy) and then greated fresh parmigiano-reggiano cheese over the chips.  Delicious!

First time attempting a recipe like this. I think we added waaaay too much oil and seasoned salt (we made some with sea salt too). They were drenched after being cooked. They did taste pretty good nonetheless. Will definitely cut down the oil and seasonings though.

The problem is I can't make these chips fast enough!  I have reduced the amount of salt I have added to these chips without harm to the flavor.  I have also added powders including nutritional yeast and garlic or onion powders.

I finally made Kale Chips today and they are really delicious!    The pictures are really not appealing but, honestly, they are good!   I followed the tips from Jennie and she was spot on about controlling the amount of oil you use.  It makes all the difference. I only read her hints while my first batch was in the oven so my next batch was much better. She also had a good tip regarding putting the kale curly side down allowing the air to bake the kale more thoroughly.  My suggestion is to use a kitchen spritzer to apply the olive oilve . . . . really helps in not over applying the oil.  Also, no need for a knife or kitchen shears - just pull the kale away from the stem with your hands . . .  so easy!  Grab the stem and pull the kale upward! For anybody wanting to give it a try, please do . . .  it's a wonderful way to add healthly food into your diet!

LOVE THIS!!!! Even my 6yo loves them!! :)  Our new favorite recipe!!!  I found that using fresh, organic bunch of kale tastes best.  In a hurry one day, I grabbed a bag of the prewashed kale at supermarket and it wasn't nearly as good.  Was bitter.  Will definitely stick to the fresh organic kale!

These were absolutely delicious! The kale itself actually imparts a savory, almost nutty flavor on the final product.  I had to cook my chips a little longer (about 17 minutes) because I didn't do a very good job drying them.  My roommates (even the one who thought they looked gross when I was making them) said they were excellent and that they'd like to make their own.  Who needs $7 bags of kale chips from Whole Foods when you can so easily make it at home?

I have made these twice now - once I think I undercooked them (they were still 'leafy' and not crispy) and the other time they got burnt. So my advice is to watch them carefully while they cook. It's worth trying to get it right because it's a delicious and fun way to enjoy kale. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these yesterday and loved them.  In my estimation, I don't feel like seasoned salt is a good addition to the kale chips.  I also think that whatever salt you use 1 tsp is a bit too much.  After I dried all of the kale, I put it into a plastic bag with the olive oil and salt and shook it until everything was evenly coated, and then put that on the baking sheet.  Very tasty, but I will be using less salt next time around.

Awesome flavor and texture (but waaaaaaay too much salt! Should be just barely a pinch dusted over the entire pan.) I also lightly dusted with garlic powder. Great alternative to potato chips while satisfying that crunchy/salty craving. I'm going to experiment with different spices like zahtar and maybe even a touch of cayenne pepper.

Great!  I used coconut oil instead, it was all I had on hand but it was wonderful!  We always have so much kale around the house from our local CSA so I'm excited to have a great use for it!

Raw kale is rough and chewy with a distinct seaweed-like flavor, but roasting the kale in this manner results in a mellow flavor and crispy, crunchy leaves. The ratio of oil to kale is just perfect here. Be sure to mix well to distribute the oil evenly or use a mister. The four stars are because I thought there was far too much salt for--although I used regular table salt and not seasoned salt. I realize salt is a very personal thing in recipes, so I think a range of suggested salt might improve upon this recipe. I used 1/4 tsp with 1/4 tsp cumin and was very pleased with the results. And yes, even my picky eaters enjoyed them (especially the kid whose only vegetable is broccolli). Thanks for this recipe! I will be experimenting with different seasonings like wasabi, curry, miso, and honey soy.

Part of the problem with bitterness relates to the quality of the kale used in the recipe. Old supermarket kale will be bitter. Shop local farmers markets or harvest your own and you will love them!

So I just heard about Kale Chips and had to try them. I didn't know where to get a recipe and I googled and this was the 1st one that came up. Reading the reviews I was super excited to go for it. I did exactly as the recipe told and I think they came out pretty well. Though not ever have tasting kale I wasn't sure what to expect and It turns out I don't think I like kale very much haha. It tastes more like a crispy broccoli chunk (I don't really like broccoli either) But if you do, you might like them.  My mum didn't mind them, but my dad is still laughing and saying that I forgot the potato part. I had fun trying to make them but that is the last time.

ADD SOY SAUCE!! I took another reviewer's advice and tossed in a little low sodium soy sauce, omitting the salt. It was FABULOUS! I am all about the salty/crunchy cravings so this is a wonderful substitute! Adding in  low sodium soy sauce replaces the sea salt, and leaves each "chip" with a little more flavor.

My alternations:

After breaking up the kale, I put it in a bowl, used spray olive oil to lightly coat, tossed it, sprinkled it with soy sauce (~2 tbs), tossed it, and followed the rest of the recipe. 

They turned out great! I can see how they aren't for everyone, but so easy they are worth a try. I ended up finding my new favorite salty snack food!

I saw this recipe a little while ago and was intrigued because I want to get more Kale into my diet.  When I saw a tiny container of it being sold at my grocery store for 5.99 I decided to make it at home starting with only 3 Kale leaves instead of the whole bunch if I didn't like it.  This recipe is awesome.  I pulled them out of the oven and immediately popped one into my mouth.  I proceeded to eat the entire pan!  Just made a second pan and my husband is devouring them as I type this.  One chip fell on the floor and even my cat snatched it up.  I added a little cayenne to the first pan and added garlic powder to the second pan.  YUM!

My boyfriend and I just made these and used juice from about half a lemon, salt, olive oil, lemon pepper, and garlic powder.  The combination of flavors were good (maybe some more garlic next time).  However not all of the kale was baked, and we were afraid to overcook the kale if we left it in any longer.  It's not a replacement for potato chips because they don't taste like them at all and they are a lot thinner than a potato chip. How it tastes just depends on what spices you put on the kale.

AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS way to eat kale!!! I always loved them at Whole Foods but they had too much flavorings like cheese, ranch, and bbq that increased the calorie count to almost 160-200 calories per serving. They have plain salted but they add so much sodium that its just too much for my taste. This recipe is easy, simple and fool proof. I baked it for 11 mins and they came out perfectly. When I baked the first batch at 13 mins, some came out a bit brown but those were just slightly bitter but still delicious. I love how they're so crispy and just crumble. I'm going to have to buy more kale now!

I was skeptical of such a dish, but lately had been hearing rave reviews online and on tv about kale chips. The only things I regret is that I added more season salt than was called for. Boy was that a mistake!!! As the kale dried, the season salt ended up clinging to the leaves A LOT!!! Lesson learned. Very good with spicy ranch that I had on hand.

Imagine eating tree leaves in October. Great if you were a squirrel, not pleasant for a person. I'll get through my kale crisps only because they have nurients.

Total hit in my house! I use an oil mister with olive oil in it, a mix of garlic and sea salt and they turned out fabulous. When I used the seasoning salt the first time they were much too salty for us. I find in our oven 8 minutes is more than enough, where as my friends oven took 15.

These are really good and both my kids (NOT fans of kale) sucked these right down.  I sprayed mine w/PAM (Olive Oil) and sprinkled some garlic powder and kosher salt on them.  Cooked for 10 min. and voila, no problems, turned out great!

Super easy to make and really good! I love kale to begin with but this is a totally new way to enjoy it. I didnt have "seasoned salt" so i just used sea salt and a little bit of chili powder, garlic powder, and of course - parmesan! I will definitely be making these again, and playing with more spices. I think there's a recipe for salt/vinegar kale chips - - which  sounds amazing!

Surprisingly good! One warning...one bunch of kale may not look like much, but it makes a TON of chips!  The good thing is, they seem to keep very well. I made these last night and purposely didn't cover them overnight to see if they would get soggy, wilty, nasty, etc...but, today, they are just as crispy and tasty as when I made them. Maybe will try garlic salt next time. A new way to get veggies in my family..Yea!

These are really pretty good!  I wouldn't say that they reminded me of potato chips, but I did enjoy the crunch of them.  Even the kids couldn't get enough.  I will be trying these with different spice combinations often.

Delicious! Just took these out of the oven and had a hard time resisting them. So good and healthy. I used a no fat/no calorie olive oil spray, seasoned salt....just a sprinkling and some pepper. I also was able to find a triple washed kale already cut into small pieces. Thanks!

Kale chips are amazing and even healthier if baked at a lower temp for a longer period of time ... plus you won't burn them. Set your oven as low as it will go (my lowest is 200, and I use convection...). I massage the olive oil, coconut oil or avocado oil into each leaf, sprinkle with sea salt (herbamare), and sometimes add chili powder...my kids love them and I can't stop eating them either! :o)

My sister-in-law told me about kale chips and I about gagged; nevertheless, I took her advice,  bought a bag of Glory Greens Kale pre-cut and tossed them with some apple cider vinegar, olive oil and sea salt and they were great!  Never ate kale prior to kale chips.

This was pretty good. I dont' think you need the parchment sheet, but maybe that's just me. Mine cooked fine without it. I think I'll experiment with different seasoning next time like garlic salt or maybe even vinegar. Thanks for the reciple.

Good starting point. Too much salt. Next time I'll skip the salt all together & try cayenne. Also, you don't want any pieces touching each other or they won't be as good. Well spaced out they only took 6 minutes per batch. One bunch took 3 cookie sheets. My pieces were irregular sizes so they didn't all cook evenly. I would aim for a standard size :o) I just ate 2/3 of a bunch of kale...

Yum! I've heard a lot about kale chips, but just made them today. They are fabulous! I used sea salt, and accidentally oversalted but they are still great.

I made these with sea salt instead of seasoned salt.  They are a good low carb crunchy treat.  Thank you LucyDelRay for sharing your recipe.

Oh  my!  These are soooo good.  I nearly ate the first batch all by myself!  Thank you for posting this recipe!
TIP:  Toss the prepared kale pieces with the olive oil in a large bowl, instead of drizzling the oil on them.  I think it gives the kale better coverage and perhaps uses less oil.

OMG Just made these for the first time. Wonderful crunchy salty flavor. I let the kale dry completely like other reviewers said before adding the olive oil and sea salt.  I used some garlic and onion powder. Turned out perfect. Will definately make again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe !!!!!!!!!!

My friend gave me the secret to excellent kale chips ... olive oil and soy sauce with parmesan cheese sprinkled in! If you have nutritional yeast (I didn't) then you also sprinkle that in. Also, I used a lower oven setting 300deg F to get them crispy but not burnt. I couldn't believe it but the whole family loved them! A keeper.

AWESOME! This tastes too good to be healthy! I am a major "salty snacker," and these are fantastic. I could almost eat them just for the texture. Like other reviews i got creative with the spices and since I love chex mix, I used the same spices (onion powder, garlic powder, season salt, and ground red pepper for a kick) It was super! I gave some to Hubby to try and he tasted a few - wrinkled his nose and said yuck. Ten minutes later he was eating them off my plate saying... "Okay these are addicting." Can't wait to try again with other spices!

I liked these, but you need to keep an eye on them. Some of mine were burnt (or they tasted that way, at least). I made two batches at the same time. The first one I used olive oil and cajun seasoning, and the second batch had olive oil and sriracha. I hardly ever buy kale, so I probably won't be making these again, but it was fun to try something different. Thanks Lucy.

More, please. Two tips: 1. Use a mister (like the Misto brand) to apply the oil lightly and evenly to the kale and 2. If you have a convection oven use that mode and cut the temp down 25 degrees to 325 (some ovens will do that conversion for you automatically when you set them for 350).

I have never had kale before.  Frankly, the dark, leafy green was a bit frightening to me.  There must have been a reason why I've never eaten this highly nutritious vegetable before (it probably tastes terrible).  One of my friends tried this recipe for me (she loves kale) and raved about it.  I was skeptical as I put the first batch in the oven.  It gave off an unappetizing aroma as it baked.  This is going to be terrible.  Then we tried it.  It was delicious.  Crunchy, salty and with a roasted sweetness.  We ate two batches that first day and made another two batches a few days later.  Thank you Lucy for introducing us to kale.

Was really looking forward to trying these--had heard a great deal about kale chips.  I did not care for them at all.  Took them to work and had co-workers and volunteers give them a try and everyone disliked them.  Reminded me of seaweed.

By the time the 2n batch was done the first batch was already eaten.  I took the advise and baked at 300 degrees for 15 minutes and it turned out perfect.  I used sea salt, garlic powder on one batch and smoked paprika on another both excellent!

Very tasty!  I cut the center vein out leaving two sides of kale leaf because the stem is a little chewy.

These are really great!
I baked mine 11 minutes, and they came out crisp and wonderful.

I had made different batches, one with spicy Creole seasoning, one with soy sauce, and both were delicious.
Only thing I might change next time is to cut larger pieces. I like that the seasoning can be varied, according to your preference.

My daughter ate the equivalent of 4 whole kale leaves, I could never have made her eat that much "green stuff" any other way.
Thanks for the great recipe!

These are easy to make and really good, esp. if you have a 'spray' olive oil or drip very carefully -- otherwise, some will be too 'wet' and not crisp up and others will burn.

These are Awesome!...don't even question this:
Triple the batch! (use multiple cookie sheets)
& sprinkle w/nutritional yeast for a "cheesy" flavor.
But here's a tip, I put my oven on convection 350* 
"tossed/turned chips" @10 min & baked another 3.
>>> then Turned Off the oven!
&  I left them in it overnight,
Absolutely Perfect! & not one scorched!
& even a triple batch will last very long.

Ohhh my!!! This is  just fantastic!  I have cooked this twice, the first time following the recipe.  The second time I was curious to see if I could get the same flavor using just a spray to cut fat as I can sit and eat the entire batch ;)  Just as good. And then...I made a discovery.  I had put some of the kale  chips on a chopping block that I had cut rosemary on...and talk about awesome!!

Yep, a really simple recipe for a great use of Kale! As recommended by another reviewer, used Pam's Olive Oil spray instead of trying to pour on the oil. Seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. YUMMY!!!

These aren't for me!  I found that baking them like this brought out the bitterness of the kale.  My husband ended up eating them all so they wouldn't go to waste, but he politely suggested that we find another way to prepare kale from now on.

Kids and I thought these were great.  I used a generous amount of olive oil and stirred the kale for several minutes so that the olive oil covered it as much as possible.  I sprinkled salt on the kale chips after they finish baking.

These were amazing!!  My husband and children ate the whole bowl within 30 min.  What a great way to get your greens! The only change I made was that I used Kosher salt and garlic pepper instead of seasoned salt because I'm not a fan of seasoned salt.

I thought these were GREAT!!  Much better than I had originally thought they would be.  This was of my own fault, but I'm just warning others so they won't make the same mistake I did....don't put in plastic ziploc bag after making.  They make the leaves wilt and taste horrible!!  Straight out of the oven they taste GREAT and are nice and crisp!  Thanks for sharing!

Terrific!  I lowered the temp to 320 with convection for 7 minutes, used the Garlic & Wine seasoning from The Melting Pot instead of regular season salt, and immediately removed to a wire rack so no moisture was retained during cooling.  This is a terrific way to use up large batches of kale from your CSA :D

Since discovering this wonderful little recipe, I believe we have become the biggest buyers of kale in our town.   My family is addicted and that includes my vege hating son who can eat an entire batch by himself.   We use salt, cracked pepper and garlic powder usually.   Thank you so much, it is delicious.By the way, we use the chips as a topping for vege pizza.  When you pull the pizza out of the oven and the cheese is still soft,  add a few kale chips and press on top.  So good.

Very salty!  Really have to watch to make sure you don't overcook it.  If cooked perfectly, it reminds me of roasted seaweed.  Halfed the salt but it was still quite salty.

This is SO delicious.  The first tray I made was devoured within 5 minutes of taking it out of the oven!  Even my husband, who needs to be convinced of nearly anything healthy, told me he liked these better than the Lays chips he was eating just minutes prior...  I am SO making these again!

I used sea salt for added healthiness and
drizzled the olive oil over the torn pieces
of kale...then tossed like a salad till all
the pieces were coated with sea salt and oil...definately watch for the last few minutes
Do Not Overbake...lower oven temp helped
kids and hubby come running when I say they're
ready......

A solid snack! Loved the flavor, but it was a bit too salty, so I'm thinking our bunch of kale was on the small side. Go with your instinct on the salt amount. We also had some consistency issues (some leaves crispy, some still a bit limp). The key for next time will be to make sure the leaf sizes are as uniform as possible, to spread evenly, and to dry completely.

Try turning the oven temperature down.  i made this at 275 degrees for 20 minutes, tossing half way through.  Big hit with the kids and the big kids as well, thank you!

delicious and so easy!!  Took one persons tip to put it all in a bag to mix it.  I did add too much salt but that was my fault.  The only change was added cayenne pepper and when the 15 minutes was done I opened the oven door and let it sit 5 minutes then shut the door and forgot about them.  3 days later they are still super crispy.  SO GOOD.

I am a flight attendant, and eating right on the road is NOT an easy thing to do.  I love this recipe because I can just whip it up, throw it in some tupperware and take it with me when I fly, for a low calorie snack.  I've found that the best way (for my taste) to make these is using dinosaur kale, following the rest of the directions as stated, and adding in a few dashes of Cayenne Pepper for some zip.  THANK YOU for sharing (my waist line thanks you too)!!  :)

I've also heard some folks have success at 425° for 5-10 minutes; just don't go all the way to 450° (paper's flashpoint)!  These are great. Try some baker's yeast as part of your seasoning, which doesn't actually require salt.  I'm enjoying this the best with that very curly kale.

OMG...these were SO AWESOME!!!  I was a little hesitant when I first heard about these.  But my family and I love green veggies so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Boy am I glad I did!!  These did not last long at all...they were gone in a flash.  My 13 and 15 yr olds LOVED them, which surprised me because my 13 yr old can be very picky.  My hubby, who said "I don't know about these" was heard in the kitchen crunching on seconds and thirds!!  I used a buttery "Pam" spray and sprinkled some garlic herb seasoning and a little salt on them.  Wow, I am craving them right now!!

I saw this recipe on the television one day it sounded unique and an alternative to potato chips which I love, found your recipe and tried it, all I can say disappointment! unusual texture but that didn't bother me as much as the bitter aftertaste it's not a thing to replace the good old potato chip's

Excellent! Even the junk food loving kids like this! I tried different seasonings: Old Bay was pretty good, garlic salt was not too great but my favorite was Parmigiana cheese a bit of "Butter Bud" type buttery sprinkles.   As stated elsewhere- you have to watch those cooking times! Well worth the effort though!

I would give it six stars if I could.  This is my new favorite snack of all time.  I did not have parchment paper so I put the olive oil on the bottom of the pan and baked for 8 minutes.  First batch I did too salty, second batch better.  Go very light on the sea salt a tiny bit goes a long way on these chips.  So glad I found this recipe!!!

I accidentally had my oven on the broil (not bake) setting despite being at 350 and they almost burnt in 8 minutes! But I smelled them in the nick of time and they were yummy green chips! So unique, and an unusual combo to be tasting your greens but in a light and crisp form. Perfect recipe, I used spray oil and eyeballed the sprinkling of seasoned salt. Wonderful recipe, wonderful idea! Thank you!

Wow....this is a great alternative when you need something to munch on!!!  I used olive oil cooking spray and it worked great.  I'm sure that real olive oil would have been even better but I figured if I try it this way and like it I can save on the calories!!! I agree with many other reviewers.....watch the salt.  I am on vacation and only have table salt....and it was too much.  For the 2nd batch (yes, I ate the first batch in a matter of minutes) I put some salt in my hand and sprinkled it sparingly.  The only advice that I would give is that they are very delicate, not for dipping :)

I was curious about this recipe.  I thought I would like it, but wasn't sure about my children.  They LOVED it.  I had to make another batch right away.  I turned the temperature down to about 310 because of the smoke point for olive oil and just baked them longer.  I also put the kale in a ziplock bag with the oil and coated it that way.  This is very easy and delicious! Thank you!

Surprisingly, this is very good.  My 3 year old picky eater actually likes it.  I tried baking the kale in food dehydrater for 5 hours, and they came out perfect.  Sometimes the edges burned when cooked in the oven.

This is a fantastic way to eat kale (which I have a lot of in the garden these days!). I did not use as much olive oil and salt as the recipe called for, but instead just sprayed olive oil on until covered and salted to taste. Delicious. I will definitely be making these again! And 10-12 minutes was plenty of time to make them nice and crisp.

Fantastic!! I sprayed mine with olive oil Pam after layering on the cookie sheet, and I very lightly sprinkled a bit of low-sodium salt on them. They came out crispy and surprisingly salty.

This recipe is one of those recipes that you come across and go WOW!.  Like the other readers I had a bunch of kale/chard that I was trying to find new recipes for and found this one.  My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  I got worried that the chard was ruined as it was cooking but it got crispy in an amazing way. I actually used habanero salt to add some heat but this would be amazing with any spices or for kids.  LOVE IT!!!

These are amazing! I ate half the chips by myself while the rest were baking! I baked these on a weeknight and having to get up in the morning, I didn't have a lot of time... so, rinsed, and hand-patted each leaf until they were bone dry. After laying them on the baking sheet, I sprayed with Olive Oil Pam, flipped the leaves and sprayed the other side. These baked at 350 for 11 minutes, and then sprinkled them with 1/4 teaspoon garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Yum, Yum.
Update: I've made several batches of these, and they are yummy each time. Just make sure you catch them before the leaves start turning brown!

These are really hard to comprehend until you make them. I wasn't sure what to expect but they're terrific!  I didn't follow the instructions properly the first time but they still turned out well enough that I was hooked. The second time I followed the instructions properly (completely dry kale, remove all stems) and they came out wonderfully.  Follow the instructions and enjoy!

Loved the chips.  Put the oil and the kale in a ziplock type bag, close it with lots of air in the bag and shake it until the kale is covered in oil.  Spread the kale on the baking sheet, add salt and bake.  They were perfect and very easy.

I just made these! They were delicious ... I put the kale in a baggie with salt, pepper, garlic, and a little parmesan cheese and shook it up really well.

Excellent, I also do this with fresh spinach, just a little less cooking time but delicious if you can't find kale.  Great as a side to fish, when serving I sometimes drizzle with aioli or a honey mustard, yummy

these are great!  don't store them right away in an airtight container - they can get really soggy.  also I cook them to the point of being almost charred, the crispier the better (I start watching them at 15 minutes and let them go just a little longer until the ends start curling).

INSANE!!! Yummmy!!!!  I watched a You Tube video and followed this recipe (same as the video I watched) and they came out crunchy and delish!!!! The trick is to make sure the leaves are dry before putting on the olive oil otherwise they dont get as crispy.  I cooked them for 15 minutes exactly and they were yummy.  My 3 year old and I just devoured an entire bunch.  We used only a pinch of salt too because I think a teaspoon is too much...

This recipe was a delightful surprise. If it hadn't been for a friend of mine who brought some organic store-bought variety to a party we hosted, I'd not have tried this recipe. These baked up as quick as the recipe indicated and mine stayed crisp for a week...till they were gone. The tip about not baking too many at one time worked nicely. I brought these to a recent party and they accompanied a kale quiche (instead of a spinach quiche) and the chips were indeed a hit. Try them and enjoy.

Reheating keeps them crunchy!  These are really tasty. Like others, I noticed that they lose their crunch rapidly. I decided to try reheating them in the oven to restore the crunch which worked great (just a few minutes on 350) but to my surprise the crunch stayed for days after that second heating!

I really enjoyed these - my family would not buy into it, but oh well for them. If ever there was an occasion to eat dehydrated kale, this would be my recipe.  I would make sure that the spices were represented because without them, they are not as tasty

A new favorite! Didn't use oil, just didn't dry the kale after washing. Added 1tsp sugar and three shakes of cayenne and tossed by hand in a bowl. Baked 9 min at 400^F on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. On the menu!

The are really good! I used spray extra virgin olive oil and steak seasoning. The trick is to cook them just right. They are really good when cooked to perfection. I will make this again soon as the kids even like it!

I had to create an account JUST to comment on this recipe!  This is BRILLIANT!  I had bought a bunch of kale to make green smoothies with, and ended up hating the taste.  I was desperate for recipes in order to just get rid of it all without tossing it in the trash.  But I loved this recipe so much that I'll buy more now.  PERFECT!!  Delicious!!

This was very yummy!  I put a bit too much salt on mine, but it was still pretty good.  I would recommend two things; use sea salt for an extra crunch, and if your bunch of kale is kinda big, do two batches!  I threw all mine on one baking pan and some came out deliciously chip like while others came out semi-chip like! Spread 'em out so that they all get evenly baked.  My husband and I ate the whole pan and he even asked me to make more!  I also made some hummus, threw it in a bowl for individual servings and topped it with some of the kale.  My husband gobbled it up!  Will be making more!!!

I love these!  They're quick and easy, and very tasty.  I snack on them while everyone else is eating chips and popcorn and it takes care of my "need to crunch something."  I make these kale chips all the time now.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fun and yummy! I had a bag of pre-cut kale, and those pieces are not cut in very even sizes, so I picked out the larger pieces for this. I used a spritzer with olive oil. Also, any pieces with a stem did not work well. Still, I loved this and have a lot of kale left in the bag so I'll be munching on this all week!

Excellent recipe.  And a great inspiration for many, many variations.  My main variation (other than flavor) is to not bake them.  Instead, I put them in a dehydrator. Takes a bit longer but never, never, EVER burnt.  Temp does not matter.  The lower the temp the longer it takes. I do mine at about 115 degrees and walk away to do something else, but if you are not that patient set the temp higher.  I love that I can get a potatoe chip crunch without having all the guilt.

This is by far the best health food I've ever made!  I have to say I am surprised since I was only expecting something edible.  It satisfies cravings for something crunchy without the high GI rating of potato chips.  I'm following the South Beach diet right now and this recipe will make it a lot easier to stay away from junk food now and after I am done with the phase 1 and 2.

It's pretty easy to go to heavy on the seasoned salt.  I think less is more for this recipe; or just leave it off.  I did one batch without salt and still thought it tasted great.  I also used spray oil in order to cover the kale easily.

I burnt my first batch.  Other than looking really bad they still tasted good.  You just have to make sure to take them out when you notice the edges starting to brown on some of the kale.  There isn't a very big window between starting to brown and very brown.

That said, I don't think I'd take this to a party unless a lot of health conscious friends were attending.  The chips don't really look like they would taste good.  I don't think the average person would be willing to try them unless they were looking for a healthy alternative to potato chips.

They were ok... don't know if I would ever make them again, but I did really want to try them.  The texture was a little... interesting.. kind of like it explodes in your mouth, which some might enjoy but I found to be a bit odd.  I tried 2 varieties of kale- the curly one was much better.

Mmmm Yummy!  These taste nutty and are really crisp!  Delish!  I used regular salt instead of seasoning salt.  I was surprised at how easy it was to coat the leaves with olive oil... just toss and rub a little in a bowl.
Thanks for my new favorite recipe!!!

The time and temp did not work at all for me. I wasted a bag of kale trying to get it just right. Either they were still limp or just a few seconds longer and they were burnt and inedible. It's prbably my oven that doesn't cook consistently. These would probably be good but they're just too easy to mess up. Perhaps I will try slower and lower next time?

I was really nervous to try this "kale kick" but this recipe was amazing.  It satisfied my craving for chips and dip when paired with 1 Tbsp zero fat roasted red pepper hummus!

I really enjoyed this recipe, kale chips are my favorite thing to make because it's easy and affordable. I buy a bag of kale from the store instead of using fresh kale and I also have come to love using parmesan cheese, pepper, salt and paprika on mine. I love kale chips because you can make so many different kinds. Great recipe.

My family loves kale chips and eats them all up. They taste like roasted seaweed, which I love but I'm allergic to. I've been making various versions of kale chips for several years now but this was the first time I made them using parchment paper.  The paper keeps them from burning up too quickly. Thanks!

I discovered I didn't hate Kale three months ago so I thought I would try this.  Excellent! I found that with small dry pieces seven minutes was perfect. Used Pam, Garlic salt and onion powder for the season. Not too much time to just cook some up for a TV snack. I am trying to diet so these are the perfect recipe for me,since I love to snack.Thanks so much for posting!!!

I was skeptical, as was my family...but we all loved them.  My 12 year old said the flavor reminded her of the pumpkin seeds we bake in the fall. The first batch I made just as the posted recipe called for, then I began trying things like lemon pepper (from a grinder) and then cayenne pepper. YUM!  My problem is making enough of them fast enough.

I thought these were great. Just keep an eye on their color, everyone's oven is different. Just when I start to see them browning on the edges I pulled them. They're delicious! 

You do need to plan to eat them while they're warm though. When the get cold they're not only not as tasty, but take on a nigh unchewable texture. But as long as you eat them fresh, they're terrific.

So delicious and addictive! I am totally making these again. There also quick and so berry easy. The timing does have to be precise though. If  they cook too long they burn. I do like them crunchy. But if they don't cook enough they are all limp and wilty. One of the key things in this recipe is drying the kale off as much as possible. Using a salad spinner is probably the fastest way. I definitely would serve these at a party if I could. They're also pretty low on calories so I've heard wich makes them even more delightful.

Oh. My. Gosh. These are just as good as I expected. They shrunk a lot more than I expected, so next time, I'll make bigger pieces. And they're very fragile, so I have to use a light touch to get them to my mouth in one piece, but all 3 of my kids and I just devoured an entire bunch of kale... That has never happened before! Yum....

I liked the texture, but the aftertaste, yuck!  To me, it was almost like that canned spinach taste.  We didn't get that aftertaste with the soup, so maybe it's the cooking method we don't like, which is of course no fault of the recipe itself.

I followed this recipe twice! Once using parchment and once using aluminum foil. They were both the same. Some cooked evenly and the rest about half done. It was hard to get them all crisp! The crisp ones were tasty but be prepared to chew because they don't dissolve on your tongue. Won't try this recipe again. Kale goes back in the Bullet with smoothies.

Actually way better than I thought they'd be.  Would give 5 stars but it's a lot of prep for the amount of finished product since the kale shrinks so much.

I tried what Jennie said.  To apply my Olive Oil I used a pump spray bottle and did so very lightly added a sprinkle of Sea Salt and PERFECTION was attained!!!!!!  I still have a couple of leaves left and I am going to try a cajun seasoning and maybe some with garlic salt.  YUMMMMMMM

What a surprise! Turned out just fine without using parchment paper, so not really sure why that's needed.  Definitely use a salad spinner for drying after washing, works great. If there's any extra moisture, dab with paper towel. I used Crisco 100% Canola Oil Spray, (which has ZERO calories!), and just a little salt, onion and garlic powder. (We didn't have "season salt.")  The chips turned out light and airy, with a crunchy, yet melt-in-your-mouth texture! ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RECIPE!  Next time I'll try some Mrs. Dash to make this treat even healthier!  :)

P.S. I tried making the kale chips without salt and it's just not the same. :(  I think the salt (besides greatly enhancing the flavour) must help to crisp the chips by drawing out any remaining moisture from washing as well as what's within the kale. Next time I will try arranging them like little tents, as one other reviewer has suggested.  Also, don't crowd the chips, they'll need space so the heat can hit them from all sides!

UPDATE:  It's now three years later since I submitted this review, and my now two-year old grandson LOVES these kale chips, and he usually turns up his nose at anything green!  We are all so happy to see him eating this healthy treat!  Thank you to whoever came up with this idea!!!

Also, I now use parchment paper, just because I have some now (although it turned out well without it previously.)  
Another trick for drying the kale before putting it in the oven:   while the oven is heating up,

I'm a college student, so I was looking for something quick and easy to make. I got a bunch of garden fresh kale from a coworker this week, and though I've heard of how healthy it is, I've never eaten kale before...so I was kind of at a loss. Needed to find a way to use it before it went bad. This recipe was perfect! Definitely pocketing it for next time too! Who knew lettuce could be so light and crispy and DELICIOUS!?

Made this today with curly kale and it was wonderful! I used a rosemary garlic spice rub and safflower oil. Instead of drizzling the oil I rubbed in on the leaves with my fingers to have more control of the oil application. Finished with Parmesan.
Been a while since I had the chip experience. Just in time for football snack season, GO GATORS!

Excellent basic recipe.  For a savory and delicious twist add a tablespoon or two of Nutritional Yeast.  Easily found at whole foods or any health food store.  If you are not familiar, Nutritional yeast has a cheesy, nutty flavor, is low calorie and healthy.  I believe some of the store brands of kale chips use it.  Good luck and enjoy!

Some suggestions.  If the kale comes out bitter - or kale is "ever" bitter, try organic.  The chemicals they use for these crops affect the taste. I use bagged kale with carrots and broccoli - why? Because you are assured that all the pieces are pretty much the same size.  I use pistachio oil, Tejin seasoning and that is all. If they do come out a little too crispy, use them as a topping for a salad or baked potato. I use a special little grate, it has a small weaved texture, to bake them.  I use a thin cookie sheet, put the grate on it and heap the kale on it.  I have a Breville oven so it takes about 11 minutes at 350

There's a learning curve with making these kale chips. Knowing the amount of olive oil and salt to use comes with experience since "bunches" are different sizes. I got mine too salty this first time, but next time I'll know better. A fun, good conversation piece!

This was a good recipe. I did add a teaspoon of ground cumin and fresh lemon juice (1/2 of a lemon) and it turned out fantastic. Thanks!

I have made this recipe several times and usually cook them too long and they have a burned taste to them. I thought that was just how they tasted. Made these today and was very careful not to over bake. They turned out fabulous, crispy but not burned! I used two sheet pans lined with parchment paper and baked for six minutes, rotated the pans and cooked only 6 more minutes and they are perfect! Thanks for sharing!

The chips tasted so burnt that even I couldn't eat them. They also crumbled as soon as I picked them up. Not eager to try again.

Wow - my kids ate this!!!  I used a pre-washed kale and cut out the thick stem parts, blotted dry with paper towels.  I used a Pam-type spray (think it's canola oil), garlic powder and seasoned salt.  I went light on the salt and it could've used more.  I left them in for about 8 1/2 - 9 minutes at 350 (did check after 7 minutes) and they were wonderful!

This recipe is very easy to make.I did not have any trouble with the kale cooking evenly..it did. Actually they looked beautiful when I took them out of the oven. They were crunchy but we did not like them. They left a strong after taste that was not pleasant.. I wish we did like them because they are a healthy snack.

So simple and delicious. Great way to add some extra veggies to your day. I use 1/2 tsp of Himalayan salt to keep down on the sodium. I've also used garlic salt which was delicious as well. Keep an eye on the oven while this cooks to prevent burning since all ovens cook slightly different.

My first kale. .. Really good  although I almost lest it in too long. 10 minutes must be the number.  And didn't measure the seasoning salt and got too much.  But they did crunch like a potato chip!

I just made these however,, only made like 15-20 of them. Didn't want to waste my Kale if I didn't like them. OMGOSH !!! I forgot to look at the clock and I set my timer wrong. Opened oven tried one. Pulled them out and to my DELIGHT. I LOVE THEM. Only used what was posted and they were perfect. Thank you Lucy as I'm 98 percent of the time a very healthy eater. Ps...I didn't even get them in a bowl I gobbled them down. :D

This was our first time trying kale. My husband and I have read all the hype about  kale and wanted to try making something with it. My husband is addicted to potato chips, so I thought making kale chips would be a nice, healthy alternative. I made the first batch with olive oil, salt, soya sauce, and Phil Robertson's Cajun seasoning. It was good, but a little too salty and too burnt tasting. Next batch I omitted the salt, used balsamic vinegar instead of the soya sauce, and kept the touch of Cajun spice. I also took the kale out sooner. It was almost perfect. I think I may have over loaded the pan a bit too much. I suggest baking 1/3 of a bunch at a time to prevent any soggy bits. My kale was done in around 8-9 minutes a batch.

OMG, these were awesome!  Not sure why this recipe did not work for others? This was my first attempt and they came out perfect!! I put the olive oil in a big ziplock bag with the cut up Kale and shook it then poured them onto the parchment paper and put salt; pepper; onion powder and garlic powder!!!  YUMMO!!!  the last 5 minutes I brought the temp up to 375 degrees but kept on watching them to perfection!!

I tried this recipe as written, except for the fact that I sized it down to only 1 serving just to try it out (I'll admit it, I was skeptical). Oh My! This was delicious! I'll forever keep kale in my fridge drawer to make these when I want a good salty snack. I have to say however, these are not like potato chips at all. They're better! (And I even cooked them a little too long. My oven cooks hot I believe.) Although you should beware: Once you start eating you CAN NOT stop! :) Enjoy!

This was the first experience my family had with kale, and it was amazing!  

My kids - 2 and 4 - both helped tear the leaves and arrange on the baking try.  And, at the dinner table, the chips were gone in minutes!  Even my husband liked them!  

My only recommendation is to be careful not to overbake.  I preferred the chips that were almost all green, or green with a hint of brown.  Most of my chips were all grown or just a touch of green; though still tasty, I preferred the chips that were more green.

If on the fence, I definitely recommend trying this recipe!  :)

Oh my goodness. These were freaking fantastic. I was super nervous that these were going to be bitter and bland. I salted them before AND after cooking to prevent bitterness. Turns out, I didn't need that much salt! They were *too* salty if anything. These are delicious. I made a whole batch this afternoon and I'm going to bake up another batch for my boyfriend to try. Delicious. The second I tried these I compared them to potato chips. Amazing!

I tried this last night and I love these "chips".  I have never tried kale, but thought this would be interesting.  I am trying to eat healthier and lower fat - so this was a good idea.  I was dubious at first, because I tasted the raw kale, and wasn't sure I would like the flavor.  I used garlic salt, and may have overdone it for some people, but I like a lot of seasoning.  This came out tasting to me just like potato chips, and I was pleased.  I want to experiment with other seasonings as well.  I won't use as much olive oil as I did, and I won't put in the fridge to keep - it limps up the chips.  Overall this is a great recipe and a great, healthy idea.

Tried kale for the first time.  My husband thought it was amazing and couldn't believe something so healthy tasted so good.  I tossed my kale in a plastic bag with the olive oil and it coated it all quite nicely.

I originally got this idea from a woman I met in the supermarket when I was buying kale for another recipe.  I love trying new ways to get green veggies into my life so this recipe worked for me.  Even though we are not big salt users in my house, sea salt on these is a must.  The first time I made them, I didn't use enough salt and they were bitter and just not tasty. By adding a bit more salt (but not a huge amount), they were tasty. Let's face it, they're not going to taste like potato chips but are a tasty alternative when you are craving something slightly crunchy and salty.  I use a Silpat to cook them.

Used a little less oil and experimented with flavors like garlic salt, cayenne, etc.  Made a HUGE batch to take camping with us.  Loved them until the raccoons figured out how to get into our tightly shut food storage bin and took off with them.  Hahaha

I used 350 degrees but cooked 5 min., checked and turned with spatula, leaving leaves flat, and cooked another 2 min. until some edges had started to darken. I like the chips, but a bunch of kale makes a lot so I store on my counter in a small brown paper bag, clipped closed. They stay crunchy and fresh tasting for several days.

Really enjoyed these.  I used an olive oil mister and that worked well.  Put seasoning salt on all and add cayenne to some.  Really tasty.  I put the leftovers in a plastic bag and that was a mistake.  They all wilted.  Next time we'll just have to eat them all!  :)

Misting lightly I think would have been a better choice and I had to bake closer to 20-25 minutes @375F. But the kale did turn out quite tasty, I will add it to my snack list. It does have almost a Norri flavor. The bunch I baked did last a few days, but that was my choice.

Wow! Aside from the fact that Kale is so good for our health and I can't stop eating these as is, how about layering on a pimento cheese sandwich, baked potato, or as a soup or salad garnish. Here is how I had to change the recipe: I prepared the Kale as directed and started out doing the oven thing, using convection setting, but after 12 mins, some of the edges were close to burning, while much of the underneath leaves were hot and soggy. So,I set aside the few that were already crisp,and finished the rest in the microwave. I put a good handful on a paper towel-covered plate, took about 25-35 secs, depending on the size of the handful. Since they were already shrunk from the oven part, it just took four plates to get them done. I noticed the pieces kept their green color better too. If you are going to stick with the oven method, leave the cookie sheet in the drawer, just carefully slide the parchment, or maybe foil onto the rack.  Next week, I'll try to cook completely by microwave and share the results.

This recipe was perfect. I used lemon pepper instead of seasoning salt and they were fantastic. I've heard that sometimes it's hard to get kale chips to turn out right, but I followed the directions and didn't have any problems. These will replace potato chips in our household for sure.

I have a convection oven, so I cooked them at 325 for 7 minutes and they were just right.  I used spray olive oil as the poster recommended, and this was just the right amount of oil, I thought.  I hadn't tried to make kale chips before due to fears of soggy or burnt-to-a-crisp chips, but I was pleasantly surprised!  What a fun way to eat green leafy veggies!

Absolutely delicious.  Do not put in a plastic bag to take to work.  They get soggy but still taste great.  Use a paper bag for traveling.

After seeing recipes for these several times, we finally tried them. The ingredients we used were the same, with the exception of using Olive Oil Pam, as noted by the submitter, for two reasons - much less oil and more even coating. My preparation varied a tiny bit - I washed and shook the water from the whole bunch instead of already cut-up kale (just thought it seemed the easiest)and I didn't think to use scissors, so I just tore the leaves from the stems. It worked okay, but the scissors would probably be easier next time (wish I'd thought of it lol). We liked these and will look forward to having them again. Also saw a suggestion elsewhere about crumbling these and mixing with popcorn and whatever spices sound good - we're going to try curry!

This is oddly good.  I like to coat the kale with olive oil in a plastic bag, rub it around, and throw that kale into to salad spinner to get any excess off.  Love my kale chips with kosher salt and garlic powder.  350-degrees for 10 minutes perfect!

WOW, that was a total shock!! I had a bunch of kale given to me so I decided to make this recipe and WOW...even my 6 year old loved them.  I took another reviewers advice and put them in an upside down V shape, I sprayed them with an olive oil mister and sprinkled some garlic.  I watched them like a hawk to make sure they didnt burn and I turned the pan around half way through cooking.  I will make these again for sure...maybe tomorrow!  Thanks for the post!

Such a great way to get your veggies, and stay balance. This morning, I returned from the farmers' market with intentions of making Kale chips from the 2 bunches of fresh kale I got. However, I had a revelation of sorts. I al came back with bacon: natural, uncured and preservative free (for bacon). I cooked 2 strips and used the bacon oil rather than olive oil. My wife, the non-kale eater, is now saying we should have this dish weekly.  Thank you for the recipe! It's so easy and can be done so quickly! Now, if there was only a way to do this in summer without re-heating the house...hmmm. :)

This is one of the better recipes for kale chips, though I hope I am never invited to a party where, as the OP says, any kale chips are "a good conversation topic."

Loved it! My 19 month old daughter and three year old son inhaled them. I sprayed the kale with olive olive and sprinkled with salt. Popped in the oven for five minutes. Rotated the baking sheet. Left them in for another five. Checked to see if the chips were done. Put them back in for two more minutes. That was almost too long. Wonderfully crispy. Big hit with my honey, too!

Read the reviews, set the oven temp to 320 x 8 min, gently  scraped them off the bottom of the pan and tossed them a little bit, then back in the oven for another 2min.  
Perfect!  Now, however, I am addicted and will no doubt try to sell everything I own to buy kale to feed my addiction.

Ditch the chips and hail the kale!  Preparation is much easier if you use a "Misto" filled with olive oil.  It's a must have in the kitchen to replace the nasty PAM spray. These are quick, easy, healthy and delicious...my kind of snack!

Makes your entire house stink and makes your breath stink for hours. Tastes great though, but it's VERY easy to over-salt.

I've found that parchment paper helps crisping significantly, and 1tsp of salt is way too much for a half sheet-pan of chips. Maybe 1/2tsp at absolute most.

Six of us were playing cards and I thought that Kale chips would be a nice healthy snack. No one liked it. Maybe I did something wrong, but it tasted very bitter. I rarely follow directions so maybe if I add something else to it, we will like it. I love many other Kale recipes so it isn't that we don't like Kale.

Thank you for posting this recipe. We tried it out but didn't dry the kale all the way :(
On the upside the dry parts tasted fabulous ! This is something we will be making often.
Thank you again!!!!

I just ate the whole bunch of kale as it came out of the oven and no one else even got to try them! (on my way to buy more kale in a minute...)
I used several of the various tips together and got great results on the first try:
~oven at 340 degrees

~line the pan with foil

~blot each leaf dry

~remove thick stems

~turn curly side down, like a tent

~mist with olive oil (I didn't have a Misto, so I used a cheap water spray bottle, like a hairstylist would use. Came out kind of spurt-y, but it worked.)

~sprinkle LIGHTLY with sea salt, garlic salt, Old Bay Seasoning...

~bake 5 minutes and then rotate pan 180 degrees, bake 5 minutes more
(no need to drain on paper towels, as there was so little oil to begin with.)

Light and crisp, like little green clouds, only yummy and loaded with goodness!
 
I also tried it with purple kale, thinking my kids would find that entertaining...worked okay, but not as well as the green. Purple kale is less curly, so it lies down on the cookie sheet more and doesn't get as crisp (it seems air flow it crucial.) Also, it loses some of its lovely color in the baking process, so the chips come out more brown than purple. Not tragic, but not outstanding, either.

I didn't like these at all, and I usually like kale.  I read all the reviews and followed others' advice, but I just didn't like the flavor.  My husband ate them, but told me he wouldn't ask for them again.

this was absolutly great. Super tasty, quite addictive really. Hard to cook evenly, but worth it for that crunch, Doesn't keep very well though :S (not if you pack them, they lose their crunchiness

Shockingly good! Nice crunch and great, healthy alternative to potato chips. I also used collard greens which are cheap and easy to find and they were equally yummy. Thanks for the recipe!!!

These are awesome! My first time making kale chips. I put sea salt, garlic powder & a few of them I sprinkled some cayenne for a kick. AMAZING! I have a double oven with a little oven on the top so things tend to cook a lot quicker in there so I cooked for 15 mins at 325. They came out perfect! I can't wait to try different combinations! Parm cheese will be next! :)

Okay, I was skeptical...Kale is bitter.  But after tasting these crunchy little vitamin packed wonders I was hooked.  Absolutely no bitter taste what-so-ever!  I will never eat store bought chips again.  Next time I will try olive oil spray instead though. Too much oil makes them soggy.  Family loves them too!  Thanks.

Loved this!  Note that although the bunch will appear overflowing on your cookie sheet, it wilts down considerably while baking.  I think I will cut down on the seasoning salt next time - not measure, but just sprinkle throughout and toss.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these and in addition to olive oil, I tossed the Kale with garlic powder, red chili flakes, black sesame seeds, homemade rosemary sea salt and freshly squeezed lime juice.  I baked these on a silicon mat.  I burned the first batch but the second batch was amazing!  

In the future I hope to experiment with other ingredients such as curry powder, black pepper, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, grated parmesan cheese, etc...

So easy and tasted great!  I was out of parchment paper so I used tinfoil rubbed with a little bit of olive oil.  I used kosher salt as my seasoning.  I will be making these again!

I washed and spun dried the kale, mixed bite sized pieces in a tsp. good olive oil with my hands and tried seasoned salt on some, Kosher salt, Fleur de Sel, and sea salt on others. I tried salting before and salting after and nothing worked. Too salty a taste no matter which way. I also cooked two batches so to not overcrowd the pan. Kale shrinks when cooked so some pieces came out the size of a quarter. They were crumbly and dissolved upon biting. I baked them at 350 on my top rack and watched the timing, about 8 minutes. My husband and I did not like this recipe at all.

This has become a real favorite of mine.  When I'm hungry between meals, I find that this is an excellent snack and satisfies my crunch and salt cravings.  At $1.99 a bunch in my area, this is a very economical snack, as well as being a power house of nutrition.  Thank you so much for an excellent idea.

I thought these were wonderful.  Easy to make and very good for you especially for those who love potato chips.
The only thing I would really watch is the salt, even though I love salt I think 1 tsp was way too much.
Can't wait to make my second batch.

1 teaspoon of salt is too much.  We tried 3 different types of seasoned salt.  All had a nice flavor but just too much salt.  If I do this again, I'll half the salt.

These were awesome! I only used half a bunch of kale and it was more then enough for 2-4 people. I also didn't drizzle with olive oil - I just sprayed some canola oil cooking spray on. I found 11 minutes to be the perfect cooking time.

All I do is hear wonderful nutritional things about Kale in all the health magazines and cookbooks.  This recipe is amazing!  I just made it for the first time and used extra virgin olive oil from a spray can along with sea salt.  I ate the whole batch myself.  I am now making another batch and spicing it up with red pepper flakes.  I like it crispy and used the curly kale and baked it for 11 minutes.  Definitely worth trying especially if you are into health food!  Enjoy and thank you for sharing!

This time, I used poultry seasoning and regular salt which definitely gave the chips a great flavour, and was quite happy with the end results. It is an ALTERNATIVE to potato chips, and although the flavour isn't bad, I find the consistency of baked kale to vaguely resemble that of paint chips (I imagine, anyway). The other downfall is that your teeth will end up with bits of kale on them, which is fine if you have a toothbrush on hand, but may not be ideal on the go... otherwise, though, this is five stars on flavour and a great healthy option recipe!

YUM!  I used Olive Oil PAM and lightly sprayed them in the pan, stirred, and lightly sprayed them again.  I added sea salt and freshly ground pepper.  Cooked at 335 for 7 minutes, and I think I should have done 8, but definitely no more!  I put hella sea salt on them, and they turned out too salty - my mistake!  I will absolutely make these again, but with less salt.  We ate them ALL.

One more thing.  I drizzled mine with olive oil in a storage bag to evenly coat them and sprinkled the seasoning on them after I put them on the parchment paper.

LOVE the kale chips!  Delicious recipe!  We tried several variations:  1) tossing with lite soy sauce, 2) tossing with oil and seasoning salt 3) tossing with oil and Lowreys Seasoning Salt with Tabasco 4) tossing with oil and sea salt then tossing with grated Parmesan cheese after removing from oven and allowing to cool for 10 minutes.

What is the recommended storage for left-overs?  Is it necessary to refrigerate?

These are EXCELLENT! I had a very large bunch of kale so I used the convection setting on my oven and spread it out on three cookie sheets. It took about 8 minutes. I sprinkled them with wild garlic sea salt flakes. I would actually equate these to potato chips. They are just as addictive with their crunchy texture and salty taste. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Hubby and I just ate an entire pan-ful of these little yummy treats!  Sprinkled each oil-covered piece of kale with a little sea salt (go easy on this), toasted sesame seeds, and parm. cheese.  Baked at 350 for 14 min.  They are FANTASTIC!  (Now I have to make some more because we ate them all!)

My little one loved these! I added finely shredded parmesan cheese! Lovely...I'm still amazed that they come out crisp! It's so weird!

I used olive oil spray, and some garlic/parmesan seasoning I had.  Delicious!  Baked per instructions and they came out perfect!

So good and so healthy! I told my picky three year old that they were "green chips" and he liked them! This is a side dish that everyone should be making.

I love Kale Chips!  I haven't tried making them with just cooking spray, but I love tossing them in olive oil.  Also playing around with different spices is fun too, but they are just as good with ordinary table salt.  My fiance is very picky when it comes to vegetables and he absolutely LOVED these when I first made them.  Now he asks for them when I haven't made them in a while :)  They are so good for you and are so easy to make!  Watch your cook time though because they can be tricky, you definitely don't want them to burn.

While I would not  say these are  a true replacement for potato chips, they definitely fill my craving for "fried, salty" food; but this has the advantage of being much healthier than standard potato chips!

Truly crispy with a yummy flavor.  I'm always looking for foods that are South Beach friendly and these chips fit in perfectly.  I did use the olive oil cooking spray - super easy.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are so easy to make and so delicious. You just have to make sure to watch them closely in the oven to achieve optimum crispness.

This is a fun recipe and a great way to eat your veggies, not to mention a veggie that can get overlooked, too. My only criticism is they are way too salty and I'm a lover of salty foods. You could cut it down to 1/4 to 1/2 tsp and be fine.

I believe I just consumed an entire bunch of kale on my own. Beware!  They're like eating a whisper. In order to save on calories, instead of all out olive oil, I used the organic olive oil cooking spray which worked great. Tried 3 different versions of chips: without salt (Kirkland's no salt seasoning), seasoned salt, and garlic powder and salt. Preferred by far the seasoned salt version. In my oven, they took only 9 minutes - watch them. You don't want them to get too brown. Just barely on the edges.

I prefer to use Lacinato kale, otherwise known as Dinosaur kale, due to it's texture. I do NOT like using the precut kale with the stems. I wash and then run a knife down one side of the stem and then the other side and remove it. I leave the stem at the top where it is very fine. Tear into pieces and then toss in my salad spinner to remove all water. Then I put into a large bowl and add about 1 TBL of olive oil and "massage" the leaves with my hands. It insures that they are covered and works better than just drizzled, in my opinion. I use a 13x18 baking sheet lined with parchment paper and try to lay them out as single layer as I can and follow the baking instructions. Don't take them out too soon or they won't be crispy. I don't add any salt at all. Kale is very high in sodium as it is and we're not used to using much salt in my house anyway. If you do add some though be careful because it is naturally salty anyway. Enjoy and thanks for a great recipe :-)

Ok so after hearing how nutrient dense kale is, I decided to give this a try because there's no way I can eat kale raw, it's not good.  For this recipe, I used fresh organic kale (green), cut it up like instructed here, sprinkled olive oil but added a twist, I also drizzled white vinegar then topped it with sea salt to taste and baked.  Like salt and vinegar potato chips!  Great taste for baked kale!

This was a really surprisingly tasty and fun new way to eat your veggies! Its crispy and with a good pinch of salt tastes really good. I bake it at 425 degrees for Exactly 9 minutes and they come out perfect. I also dont have to watch the oven which is great...just set the timer.

YUMMY!!. You have got to try these. I made mine with garlic salt and parm cheese and then ate the whole bunch. Make sure you go easy on the oil though. I mixed it in a bowl and was able to massage the oil around. A little goes a long way.

Excellent with broccoli, too!  Bake a little longer. After cooking, try squeezing fresh lemon juice over all and sprinkle with nutritional yeast flakes (NOT the same as active dry yeast), which are a goldmine of B vitamins, zinc, protein, and other nutrients.  Yeast flakes have a nutty flavor that also goes well on popcorn.  Kids have no idea...

I was looking for a recipe to make as I have heard that dogs love kale and that kale chips would be a great treat for them! How fortunate to know that we both get to enjoy them! His will have to be without the salt, however!

I'm sure these are healthier than potato chips. But we don't eat too many potato chips. We thought they were just okay. If I make again will try soy sauce. The salt was a little too much IMHO.

Way, Way too much season salt.  Next time I will use less and I think it will turn out much better.  Also had to do it in two batches, the first batch had too much seasons salt and took a long time to cook at 350.   second batch I did at 375 and it went much faster.

Oh. My. Goodness.
I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about these but they are EXCELLENT! They are crunchy and salty and satisfy my potato chip cravings!
I baked them at 300 because I was scared of overcooking and I think it was a wise decision.

omg...so perfect!  recipe is written very well and just like the writer says-the key is to watch for when the edges turn brown.

i used kosher salt, and lots of it.  I think this makes a big difference over regular salt.

This is a great recipe. Like many others I altered mine a tiny bit. Heres how: I made my kale pieces very small so I can use the crispy "chips" as an adjunct to my salad! I think it is very important to make sure the kale is very dry after rinsing/washing. I patted dry with a paper towel & had no problems. I used an infuser to spray a small amount of olive oil over the pieces on one side only. Then I used Johnny's seasoning as many said theirs turned out too salty. I barely put any on.

After baking exactly for 10 mins, I took it out of the oven & tried a piece of the center of the sheet to make sure it was crispy. It was so good I ate my entire first batch before the second was done. I think 10 mins for me with the kale being evenly spaced was perfect. I used the same sheet of parchment paper between batches which gave some olive oil & seasoning to both sides of the 2nd & 3rd batches. My boyfriend can't stop eating them & my friends love them!

These are fantastic! I could make these everyday, and I might being that they are full of good vits and mins :D Didn't have seasoned salt on hand so I had to season with salt, pepper, and turmeric. Note to self: go get seasoned salt...

These were AMAZING!  So crunchy and addicting!  My seasoning salt is very salty and I used too much the first batch, so be careful over-salting them.  Just a little is all you need the flavor of the kale is what really sings by itself!

This recipe shines in it's simplicity. The only change I made is in the baking instructions. Bake for 9 mins, remove the sheet, stir the kale chips around, turn the oven OFF and stick the sheet back in the oven for 8 mins. The chips crisp up wonderfully with no overdone edges. Fantastic to have at hand when the munchies hit you.

Great use for Kale.  Have made this twice now and everyone loved them.  The second time I used creole seasoning instead of seasoning salt to give it a little more kick.

Yummy !!!!   I have had Kale chips made in a dehydrator and loved them, so I decided I was going to try to make my own at home.  I am so glad I found this recipe!   These chips taste just like the ones made in the dehydrator - yet took 1/4 of the time to make!    I used garlic salt on my first batch, and will use Chili Lime popcorn seasoning for my next batch.  Cant wait !

I loved this recipe - it was a perfect thing to munch on during the football game!  Crisp and full of flavor, the chips nearly dissintigrate in your mouth - light as air!

Instead of seasoned salt, I used nutritional yeast.  It added a lot of flavor without the sodium.

I would suggest cutting the kale into small pieces and doing your best to no have any folded over.  The added thinkness of folds makes it seem to dry slower.

These were really tasty, but I'm only going with 4 stars because I agree with what some other people said - it's tricky to get the texture just right.  Keep a close eye on them after 10 minutes.

Honestly, these barely made it out of the oven! I love Kale and was searching for recipes and I came across this. I did spritz them with olive oil and used a garlic and herb seasoning that is salt free. The crispy texture is just DELIGHTFUL! Just yummilioushious!

This is a great way to eat something super healthy, making it taste good and be fun for kids to try. Super easy to make - I used a seasoned speciality olive oil I had on hand and it was delicious.

FANTASTIC, even if you're not a health NUT! I decreased oven temp to 325 degrees, used cooking spray instead of the olive oil, and a bit of sea salt the first time. The ENTIRE family loved it! Trust me though... you can add whatever spices you are craving and it will be wonderful. (have since used on different occasions garlic and onion powder, lemon pepper, cayenne pepper, etc...) Try this - You'll LOVE it!

They really do taste sort of like potato chips if you close your eyes!  First time trying these and they were great!  I skipped the parchment paper.  Spray the pan with olive oil, lay dry kale down (with some space between pieces) spray the top of it with oil and cook for 7 minutes at 350 (according to my newish oven).  Sprinkle with season salt and eat!

After encountering the problem that other reviewers had of some leaves being burnt while others remained soggy, I added a step by finishing these off in my food dehydrator! This is my secret to getting them completey crispy and dry without burning any edges. I use olive oil spray and Penzey's Northwoods Fire seasoning.

OH YES.  I made these for my family and my little sister (who will not eat anything green) devoured them.  The first time I made these, I put way too much salt on them. 1 Teaspoon really means 1 teaspoon...max. Throw a little lemon juice on them to help your body absorb the iron, or just eat them as is.

Wow! These WAY surpassed expectations. I would prefer these over a bag of chips any day! After reading reviews, I was very careful to watch for when they were just perfect, because a little bit of chewiness is by far better than the strange burnt taste they can acquire quickly. I rubbed mine with a bit of olive oil and layered them on the pan. I played around with a couple different flavours but my favorite was Salt and Vinegar. I used a Kernels Popcorn seasoning and just sprinkled it on top as it baked. 
I also tried soy sauce(in a bowl first to get on the leaves.. then on the baking sheet which was a close second favorite), garlic powder, cheddar cheese and just salt. 
I am definitely looking forward to trying out additional flavours. =)

Great snack!  I tossed the kale in a ziploc bag with a smidge of olive oil, sea salt, and a splash of balsamic vinegar, lowered the temperature to 300 degrees, and baked for about 30 minutes.  Perfect, evenly cooked chips with a nice tang from the vinegar.

Excellent healthy alternative and is a good way to get the kids to eat this super food. I took other viewers advice and set the oven to 340. Leave in oven for 7 minutes then watch them closely checking them every minute. I made both the chewy and crunchy. I goggled a seasoning salt recipe and prepared it with sea salt. Great recipe! Thank you

Tasty!  I baked mine at 325 for 15 minutes and they were perfect!  They are light and crisp at first but as you chew them they get a little chewy but we all liked them.  These would be great as a side to a sandwich and my kids even ate them!

I made it with purple kale according to instructions.  Both my husband and I like them better than potato chips.  Timing is touchy that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

Great health-wise, not as good as potato chips taste-wise.  

These chips are more crumbly than the fried potato kind. I had to get used to the taste at first.

They ARE addicting though.  I've made them a few times, and found that 350 for 10 min was the MAX I could keep them in my oven.  I tried them at 335 degrees for 10 min,  and I liked that better.  You might have to play with the temperatures a little.

Maybe it is just me - but I found that the bitterness comes out more when you bake these - any way to prevent?  Great idea and low in cal but nasty taste

excellent. i used my hands to massage oil onto leaves to use less. I made 3 batches with different seasonings. Old bay, then carribean jerk and one with chicken seasoning lightly sprinkled on. they all tasted good. i think you can use whatever flavoring you like. baked 10 minutes, took out and tossed them around and back in for 6 mins at 350

This is such a great, healthy alternative to potato chips!  I don't just drizzle with olive oil...I use about 1/2 tbsp and massage it into the kale.  You don't need so much oil and the more you rub the leaves, the less bitter they become.  I sprinkle mine with a little sea salt and some chili powder.  They are VERY good!  Also, in my area you can buy bags of kale that are pre cut without stems.  This makes the chips even faster to prepare!

As bizarre as they sounded I found them strangely addicting!  I really like these.  My husband didn't want to have any part of them so sadly I don't make them very often because it is just me eating them.

I tried this recipe a few days ago.  What I ended up with was tasty, but I am wondering what the final result should look/feel like.  Some of my kale was quite crispy, and some was very limp.  I believe I did not get my kale quite dry enough before I started, and I also think I had too much oil.  Any tips?  I have more kale, and would love to try again.  Thanks.

I have heard of Kale chips for a while but like many of the other people who reviewed, was skeptical. WHY did I wait so long?!?!?! I am addicted to these! They are my favourite TV watching companion :) 

Thanks so much for sharing!

I also find I get better results using PAM olive oil spray and sea salt. I know many of you would think I'm crazy but I literally WATCH my bake b/c I find the window btwn perfect and burnt to be extremely small. 

If you don't like this recipe - try it again b/c you most likely burnt them ;)

These were delish :) I think I kept them in for about a minute too long...as they had a slight burnt after-taste, so watch them closely.

Wow! Thank you so much for giving me a way to get my 22 month old daughter to eat a green vegetable! I wasn't sure what to expect but they are delicious! I followed another reviewer's advice and used butter flavored cooking spray. Talk about easy.

Some were done after 10 minutes, others after 17 and still others after 22. some never got crispy, but they were delicious! I, too, don't think I'll be able to save leftovers, but what a great way to eat kale! Thanks for posting!

My husband and I both enjoyed these chips.  I salted them well and they had a nice crunch.  My seven year old thought they were o.k., the two year old spit them out.  As for cooking time, my batch was done in 11 minutes and cooked perfectly but I watched them like a hawk like other reviews suggested.

I am not sure what went wrong. I followed the recipe, but after 7 minutes they were burnt and disgusting. I check my oven with a thermometer, and know it is calibrated ok. The Kale was fully dried before drizzling with oil. I will try it again to see if I can get a different result.

A friend of mine who has Celiac's disease made these and brought some to work for me to try. They are very good and crunchy. The only problem I found, was they were a little bitter after you chewed them a little while.  I dont' know if it is me or that is the way they are supposed to taste, or if it was the Kale itself. (Seasonal). I thought the recipe was easy, and healthy. I enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Yum! I had leftover olive/oil& balsamic vinegar from marinating veggies to be grilled, so I put the kale in the same container, shook, spread them on the cooking sheetsprinkled the first batch with Lowry's salt and the second with Old Bay.  We liked the OB ones best.

Better than I thought they would be.  I didn't care for the aftertaste, but I felt healthy eating it! It really doesn't take much olive oil, and go light on whatever spices you put on (we liked seasoned salt, but got a bit much on it).

Good way to prepare Kale. Just don't eat too many or your stomach will be mad at you. You also have to find the proper balance with the salt....too much is overkill but too little makes them a tad bitter.

The bitter, green after taste is not representative of the bitter green you get with some cooked greens or salads,(and I love all kinds of greens).  They are crispy & salty, but that's all you can say for them.

Unfortunately kale is not a cheap buy but this recipe was worth it! The kale has an odd but addictive flavor.  1 tsp of seasoned salt goes a long way.  I made the mistake of oversalting mine.  My 11 year old son chowed this down.  I will definately make again but when kale is on sale.

Holy kalenoli! This is my first time eating kale and I love it! It tastes just like the Lays I used to eat! The batch I made had soy sauce on half of it (a suggestion made by another reviewer) and it was delicious. I actually forgot the timer, so I just occasionally checked the ends if it was starting to brown or at least crisp. Anyway, I will never buy chips again. Thank you Lucy!

Baking 10 minutes was spot on for me.  Salt after baking for extra crispiness.  Be sure to spin extra dry before coating lightly with olive oil and rub the oil in with your hands.  Came out perfectly!

I thought this recipe was wonderful! It is so easy to customize as well. I tried using some kosher salt and "Spike" seasoning and it was delicious. My oven is electric and the original temperature and baking time was perfect. Thanks so much!

So delicious!  My 3 and 5 year old grubbed these up.  And my husband and I loved them.  For ease, I just sprayed them with canola oil cooking spray on both sides, sprinkled with kosher salt and baked in with our french onion soup.  A delicious side.

It's a good idea, and it tastes great but the kale felt a little scratchy on the throat.

I used Olive Oil spray instead as it was MUCH easier and quicker.  The taste of these is great, but the smell of your house after is not-so-great.  As other reviewers suggest, watch these things very closely.  Mine were super crispy (not burned) at 11 minutes.

These are fabulous. Used Pam instead of oil, tried seasoning salt, garlic salt and truffle salt. All great but be careful not to over salt or over cook. Great option to potato chips for a salt snacker like me.

These were excellent! They took a little longer to cook than indicated, but worth the wait.  Instead of seasoned salt I used fresh ground salt and dusted with a little bit of ground mustard, and a pinch of crushed red pepper.  We served them with burgers, so it was a perfect low carb side dish.

they had a good taste, but they were so fragile.  the first pan I cooked for about 8 minutes and they  are burning, and the second pan I cooked for about 6 minutes, and they were better.  I'm not sure that I'll be attempting these again...

Seriously, these are quite good.  You have to really like kale though, that bitter green kind of flavor.  After trying the standard recipe, I used about 1/4 teaspoon of seasoning salt on the next batch and used my handy little oil sprayer from kitchen store.  Good.  I baked them at 300 for about 18 min.  Just watch em so they don't burn at edges cause that tastes nasty.  Really gets you past that tater chip craving.  My 12 year old won't come near em, my eight year old has to be be diverted or she will eat them all.

Thanks so much for the recipe! Next time, i think I will try adding a little honey or agave for the bitterness.

Thanks again for sharing!

I am so addicted to these - a great alternative to potato chips. I love these with a little bit of white vinegar sprinkled over the top.

Very good. I baked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes and then checked and removed the crispy ones and baked the remaining leaves for 2 more minutes in order to get them all crispy without burning them.

Simple and delicious. My only changes were to use a spray bottle of olive oil and to turn the kale a couple of times while it was baking. Kale will be on my grocery list again this week so I can have more.

I haven't been able to get my family to eat kale, but this did the trick.  My son who seems to have an aversion to leafy greens actually snacked on these quite a bit.  The only modification I made is sprinkling hickory or mesquite powder on the kale before baking which makes these really tasty with a barbecue flavor!

Interesting.  Made these for myself as a healthy snack.  After the first few bites, I thought they were pretty good but I got tired of the flavor real fast.  Not likely to make again.

Kale chips seem strange but they have a great crunch!  Even my little sisters (ages 8 and 12) liked them!  They do have a definite kale after taste to them but if you don't like that you could mix them with other vegetable chips and that would probably make it less noticeable.  Just make sure to watch them so they don't burn!

I am liking these more and more.  Try a sprinkle of 'Sazon Goya' on them! Also used a little butter-flavored cooking spray in place of some of the oil.

Very good!  It is a great healthy alternative to potatoe chips.  It has the crunch, the salt, but not the calories or fat.  Will make this my healthy snack choice!  Easy and quick.  I baked at 350 for 10 minutes and checked every minute after.  Total bake time 12 minutes.  Perfect!

Followed the recipe exact but next time will either cut salt to 1/2 tsp or not at all.  I could not stop eating them, even though they were way too salty for my liking.  I will make again and try with no salt at all.  What an excellent snack!

Wow!!! I am so surprised at how light, crispy and bright green they were. I was watching them when they were cooking and for some reason I decided to try one, but I didn't think they were done yet because they were still so green. Well, I am happy that I stopped and tried one because they were done! I took them out immediately and let my roommates try and they were really surprised that they came out sooo.... good! I am definitely going to make these very often. Just don't cook them too long! I can definitely see why the author of this recipe states that timing is critical. Thank SOOOO much for the recipe. I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!

Soooo good and soo easy!! I baked mine at 330 for between 6-8 mins (the drier kale was done at 6; the kale that wasn't completely dried off took 8 mins, probably could've gone for another min or two). The trick is to make sure your kale is absolutely DRY so that it crisps up nicely. I tried one batch with garlic salt (eh) and one batch with soy sauce (yumm!!). Will definitely make these again, thanks for the recipe!

My husband doubted this would work, saying there was no way the kale would get crispy. It did work! And he liked them. We followed directions exactly and baked 11 minutes. Thanks for a great healthy snack!

amazing, truly. I made some with season salt and some with sea salt, love them both. I'm going to play with vinegar now since I love salt and vinegar chips, but due to low carbing, have stayed away from chips for 2 months and counting. THANK YOU for sharing this awesome and easy recipe!

I bought an entire bunch of Kale for holiday meal decoration and was about to throw away the majority when my DIL mentioned this recipe.  It was amazingly good, and so easy.  I will remember this especially for dieting!

Yum! The timing is a bit tricky, but I'm sure it will get better with time. I baked the kale for about 11 minutes at 340, and it was mostly all crunchy. I think I would let it go for another or minute or two next time, but I was so worried it would burn based on others' comments. Still, recipes don't get much easier than this...will definitely try again!

I made this with flowering kale because the grocery store was out of green kale. Very good, easy to make but very fragile so you can't really store it. Make your serving and eat it then. Will definitely make this again.

I am seriously addicted to these! It's so sad to get to the end of the bowl... It all happens so fast.. I could eat them everyday. And I have for the past three :) If you like dried nori you will probably like these too. I've found that I like them better when they are slightly underdone so some of the pieces are not completely crispy but they taste more like a potato chip when they are slightly overdone. They look amazing, taste amazing, and are healthy!

These are really easy to make and tasty! I didn't think they would be so good! I used olive oil in a spray can and that made it super easy! Just spread them on a cookie sheet, sprayed them down and added a bit of salt!

These were (surprisingly) delicious! 10 minutes was enough in my oven. Kids liked them. I used regular salt instead of seasoned salt. There was no bitterness at all.   I'm pregnant, so this was a great way to get in a serving or two of dark leafy greens!

These are wonderful! My kids ate them up. I liked them just as is but they really liked them when I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. Either way they are delicious and super healthy.

These were tasty.  I'd liken the flavor to that of toasted, salted pumpkin seeds rather than potato chips.  My 11yo son (who's not too picky) said, "These are good-- it doesn't even taste like kale.  Too bad you can't do this to eggplant."  We'll be making these again.

I give this a "baked kale chips... heh.... go figure!"  They're very good!  Wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm definitely pleased.  I used Pam Olive Oil because I figured I'd get more of an even coating, and save calories.  And you're right, I couldn't eat just one.

I love kale chips and this is my favourite way to make them. I've tried different seasonings and even added garlic, but the simple way is the best way to go!

These were great!  I took them over ot my neighbor's house and he absolutely loved them.  I added crushed red pepper flakes and a very small amount of sea salt.  The key is on the cook time.  Too long and the disintegrate too little they are limp.  Mine were just right!  I hope yours are too!

After the first bite, I thought "these are okay." A few minutes later, I'd finished an entire tray and was wanting more. They might not seem like much at first bite, but these are surprisingly addictive. They were sort of tricky to eat since mine crumbled into pretty little bits, but I thought the flavor and crunchiness were just right.

Wow these actually did crisp up!  I sprayed with Pam and added sea salt.  Mine did take exactly 10 minutes, but start checking at 7.  And check them by touching them -- they look the same when they are undercooked as they do when they are perfect.   OH and its VERY easy to oversalt these since the flavors condense: go sparingly on the salt.

Just about the silliest thing, but they were pretty yummy! The kids thought they were yummy too. I used olive oil and just regular salt. They shrunk up into little wafer things.I'll be making them again :)

Excellent!  Great trick for using up all that CSA kale.  Other reviews I read said that the ashy taste some people mentioned comes from overcooking - to be on the safe side, I reduced the oven temp to 300, and baked for 15 minutes.

I made these in my dorm last year and they were a huge hit! I prefer to eat them as soon as they're cool...it's a melt-in-your-mouth texture. I didn't like them as well the next day, but my roommates gobbled them down, so I can't speak for everyone. I love that they were so easy to make I didn't have to buy any ingredients to try to find space for, which makes this a great recipe for a college student.

Unbelievable. I planted kale for my chickens and they aren't eating them.  I have at least 30 full bundles of kale and had NO idea what to make with them.  I tried this.  O-M-G.  This is FANTASTIC.  I went a little heavy with the salt first time around.  We tried salt on some, garlic powder on some and lemon pepper on some----garlic is the best so far.  Trying a batch with soy sauce and a dash of Worchestershire sauce.  We'll keep experimenting.  GREAT RECIPE!!! THANK YOU!!!

I'm not a kale fan but I keep wanting to eat it for health. Tried these with sea salt and they were terrific.  The kids like them, too.  Gone in 5 minutes.  Important that they get crispy!  Made a batch of beet greens the next day with no salt and they were okay, too.  Not as good, but a good way to pack in those veggies.

These are excellent exactly as the recipe is written!  I came home from the store with a huge bag of Kale to which my husband, replied, "Don't think I'm eating that if you make it, I hate Kale."  Of course he then ate 3/4 of the batch of Kale Chips that came out of our oven!! The second time making these I did find that it was easer to coat with oil if I put it in a tupperware container with the lid on and shake it around with a drizzle of olive oil...if you're unsure, take the chance and make these!!

This is a great recipe.  a very delicious and healthy snack.  My 3 year old twins and I love the kale prepared this way.  I don't have to worry about it losing its crispness, it doesn't seem to last long enough to have a problem with that.     Thank you.

COOL!  I, who have have never cooked with kale before, bought a large bunch for another recipe and had 2/3 of the bunch left over.  I searched allrecipes for kale ingredients, and this was simple and interesting so I gave it a shot.  My proportions were off so it was really salty, but these are great and fun! I had to keep opening the oven to let some of the smoke out, but they weren't burnt and were crispy and perfect.  A few pieces were limp, but I think they were not completely dry. Now I'll buy kale just for this recipe!

I used the cooking spray. What a great idea. I also used a heavy seasoning salt, not a great idea. next I am going to try sweet potatoes.

I just tried these. WOW - are they good! I used too much olive oil and just a tad too much salt - but they still were great.  Who would believe that the Kale would crisp up like that?! I am a 75 yr. old vegetarian widow and I live alone.  Does anyone know of a way we could keep these stored so they retain the crispness?

YUM! SO tasty! I love these so much more than chips for munching! Next time I'll remove stems and leave whole, then brush each with olive oil and test spraying some with Pam... following the recipe you get some soggier pieces so I'm hoping to avoid that. But they are still so tasty! --As far as seasoning, salt is great. I might try shaking some seasoning on AFTER baking next time (kind of like how they don't season fries until AFTER baking/frying). I'm so glad I tried this! The wonderful flavor of kale is great in this snack food!

These really did bake up nicely with a crunch like potato chips! I made one batch as the recipe is written and they turned out great. I made another batch and added more spices and they did NOT turn out so great...the spices ended up burning! So just stick to the recipe and only use salt and olive oil!

I love this alternative to potato chips.  When I made a batch for my husband and myself, we had a few left over that became limp overnight.  I decided to put them on a plate and stick them in the microwave to crisp them up.  Not a good idea.  They caught fire.  Kale obviously has some metal in it.  Better to warm them up in the oven.

My 8 year old loved them. I called it old fashioned potato chips and she about ate them all. Make sure to lie the bunches flat and I placed on aluminum foil instead of parchment paper. Next time will buy 2 bunches.

Very good. Easy and fast. Healthy. Use sea salt it's better for. Extra virgin olive oil also. Replaces chips when you need a crunch but melts in your mouth. Also crumble and add to salad or on top of grilled chicken.

These were great!  I tried them with both lacinato and curly kale and the curly ends up with a lot more of an interesting texture.  It's also easier to fit more on the pan as they can stand up.  I used the ziploc baggie method and used half seasoning salt and half Penzey's Sunny Paris seasoning.  I also tried doing the same thing to spinach, but the kale is much better.

These sounded like a good idea, but were not great.  I found them to be WAY too salty!  They're just not for me (and I'm even a Vegan!) but they're an interesting way to cook kale, so I would still recommend it to people who already like kale.

I had some kale leftover from a soup recipe and was looking for something quick and easy to do with it. I found this recipe via Google and was immensely delighted with the results-- the light, crispy texture is like nothing I've ever experienced. It is true that you have to watch the cooking time closely. I ended up taking some out when it looked "done" and cooking some for a bit longer. Since I have a convection oven, the first batch came out at 7min and the second at 9min. Thanks for such a creative treat!

I was amazed by how flavorful this was.  I ran out of season salt so used "Old Bay" seasoning with some sea salt.  I also sprayed the kale with olive oil.  Next time I'll make bigger pieces since they shrink a bit when cooked.  Delicious and healthy!

My mom made these for me and between the two of us we literally just ate 3 lbs of fresh kale from the garden.  This is FANTASTIC!  Doesn't taste like potato chips, but it doesn't taste like kale either.  I like how you can very easily control the salt/calorie content and be able to gorge on a very nutritious vegetable.  Great recipe.

I used a little more oil, and a little less salt. Could have cut the salt some more. I also set the oven to convection and cooked the kale for 18 minutes. Nicely brown, no black. The results were superb. I ate the whole tray.

Super easy recipe.  They all disappeared in one sitting between my man and I.  I did find, however they do get stale if you make them ahead of time.  Great way to fix all that abundant kale form the garden!  Lots of vitamins and fiber!

My 10 year old loved these.  I made them with a little bit of roasted sesame oil as well as olive oil.  I seasoned with garlic salt and black pepper.  They were great.  I made this with the unsavoyed kale- looks kind of like spinach.  I kept the pieces small, and they all dried uniformly and were almost too flaky: but delicious.

We have a bumper crop of kale, so I was looking for a way (other than soup) to use it.  I was leery to try this, but after reading the reviews, I gave it a whirl and I'm not sorry I did.  Interestingly yummy!

Neat way to use up kale. Mine was a little too salty though.  I went by another review and used soy rather then salt. Maybe that is why. I also sprayed with olive oil mister and didnt have parchment paper so it stuck to the pan.  But tasted neat!

This was wonderful! Tossed in olive oil and sprinkled with old bay. Baked on one side for 8 min, flipped, and did 7 min on the other side - I didn't use parchment paper.  Each "chip" was crispy.

I bought some kale thinking I would try to cook something different and found this recipe onlne. I'm afraid I wasn't really fond of the chips and my husband wouldn't eat more than one. I found them to cook unevenly, some being done while others were still chewy and limp. Not something I'll try again.

Amazing! I made these in 10 minutes. I tore off kale leaves, rinsed, spread on a cookie sheet, sprayed with olive oil, sprinkled with smoked sea salt and baked at 375 for 8 minutes (tossing with spatula once). They were the best "chips" I've ever eaten. Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous, quick and easy way to eat this superfood!    Only make enough to eat right out of the oven.  I'm going to try Trocomare (organic leek/celery) salt next time, instead of sea salt, just to compare.  These are already one of my favorite snacks and sandwich sides.

Kale has the most nutrition per oz of any vegetable out there and NOBODY EATS IT! This was a wonderful way to get kale into my diet! I added a few pieces of shredded cheese on top of them for my sisters (they are more picky about their vegetables) and they loved them! I also used grill seasoning instead of season salt. Very delicious!

You really do need to watch the oven because it browns really quickly, and too much brown causes a major taste difference.  I tried this with collards and mustard greens too, and collards were much more successful because the mustard greens just were too thin and got stuck to the pan. Take it easy on the salt!  And I tried to make this by cutting up the leaves, putting it in a container with vinegar, oil, and salt, and shook it up.

yum!! this was my first time trying kale and ever since i saw this recipe i knew i had to try it. I halved the recipe adn only baked it for 6 minutes or so.  although these don't equate with potato chips, they're a super yummy way to get your leafy green vegetables! have made them three times in the past week and just bought some more kale today;)

Very tasty, not one left at the get-together I made these for!  They're best when very crispy, I was a little scared to overcook them b/c of other reviews and my first batch wasn't great. When they're not done enough, they're a little bitter but as long as they get crisp enough they're great!  I make them all the time when I'm craving a salty snack.

I, too, was skeptical.  After all, I'm not the biggest fan of kale, although I try to eat it from time to time because I believe it's super good for you.  
The chips are a great idea.  They are quick and easy to prepare, and I enjoyed eating them.  Thanks for sharing!

Didn’t seem to be enough oil. So tried using more. Not good idea. Make sure you coat all the leaves in a bowl then bake.  My convection oven worked best.

Loved these kale chips! I read reviews from others and here are the changes I made: lightly toss kale in a bowl with a tablespoon of olive oil mixed with a few drops of sesame oil (great recommendation!). I sprinkled garlic powder and baked in a 300 degree oven for 18 min, checked for crispiness, and then 6 minutes more (total of 24 min in oven). When I took them out, I sprinkled sea salt and Parmesan cheese on them. Delicious! Will definitely make again!

The husband bought a gigantic bag of kale leaves I didn't know what to do with and I found this recipe. It worked well!  Of course, I was too zealous with the seasoning salt but we still finished the whole sheet in minutes. I didn't have parchment paper so I used aluminum foil without any problem. Will make again and experiment with different spices. I like that it was quick, un-fussy, tasty and a little different from our general repertoire.

Simple to make and delicious!  These disappear as soon as they're done at our house.  Some tips, wash and dry the kale the day before so that it's not still wet.  Be sure to cut out all thick stems, as they won't dry and will result in soggy chips.  Watch them like a hawk when they are close to done, you don't want to burn them.  Try getting creative with flavorings.  A simple favorite at our house is using sea salt and garlic powder and then sprinkling with finely shredded Parmesan when the chips have just a few minutes left in the oven.  Yum!

I am eating them now; as I watch Sunday football. The recipe is easy and quick. I went with the posted recipe...just olive oil and salt....but you could season with whatever you prefer. 
   I will be making them again.

We made these based on the video and the recipe.   I think this is a "try to make it several times until you get it right" recipe.    We made them too salty the first time- used pure sea salt- so will salt less next time.  They are yummy. but strong tasting as expected from kale.     The recipes did not say leaf up or down so we tried down facing based on another review.  (I would have tried leaf up) Leaf down worked well.  12 min in 350 degree oven

I was skeptical, even though I've heard about these for  while.  But I needed to do something  with our kale.  Like many others, I was pleasantly surprised.  I have crisping cookie sheets, so I turned the oven down to 250 degrees, and they took about 30 minutes.  I also added a touch of salt after they came out the oven.  They were SO good.  My kids, who eat kale all the time, thought they were OK.  My husband, who does not prefer "fake" versions of foods, liked them as well.  Great way to use up kale.

I love Kale chips!  They smell a bit funny, but taste great.
A few tips...
*Drop the cooking temp to between 275 and 300 (or even lower) and cook for 15 to 20 min.  This will help to dehydrate the kale without burning it.
*Cook on the top rack of your oven, or as far away from the heat source as possible.  Sometimes I open the oven for a bit help things dry out.
*Make sure that you have a thin, even layer of kale on your baking pan, and check the chips every 5 min or so.  Give the pans a shake a time or two during the cooking process to make sure the chips aren't sticking, and to help with even cooking.

I've been looking for a crunchy snack to fit into my healthier eating plan. These are great! I used Avocado Oil Spray (no flavor, chemicals or additives) to lightly coat the DRY leaves, then sprinkled sparingly with lemon pepper and garlic powder. Bake @ 200 for 7 minutes, checking them often. I then turned the oven off and let them sit for about 10 min. They came out perfectly crispy. Getting ready to make a second batch, and am excited to experiment with different seasonings.

Just used vegetable spray on the kale pieces and a very light  touch of sea salt and freshly grated black pepper. Crispy, delicate and tasty! 4 stars because mine were done in 8 minutes. Glad I shook the pans when I was going to rotate them as those crispy chips were freely sliding on the pan and done! 10-15 minutes would have been way too long.

I made the kale chips, they turned out absolutely fantastic!! I used the misto with olive oil like LucyDelRey suggested, only a teensy bit of oil was used and it was distributed evenly. I'm pretty sure the people who complained about burned-or-not-crispy chips just weren't patient about drying their leaves first, or used too much oil. Mine were pretty darn dry, and they all came out crispy and not burned at all. 

One itsy bitsy critique though, in the recipe it suggests using a knife to get the spines out of the kale leaves. In my experience, it's way easier to just tear the leaves away from the spine. Thank you for the awesome and simple recipe! Time to make these again...

My husband and I love these. I start with kale from farmers market. I make sure after washing kale that all is completely dry. Toss with olive oil and I season with savory nutritional yeast flakes. Delicious!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE these kale chips. They are certainly not potato chips, but I like them better I think. So easy to make, satisfying crunch, and healthy! Give it a try! 
I did make them for my in-laws because they eat chips every day, but they turned their noses up at them. I think they just don't like healthy food, though.

I'm trying to get healthy, so I hope these have a good nutritional rating.  Even my picky grandson likes them, so they must be kid-friendly.  Sure I will make them again-probably instead of popcorn for the next movie.  A bit labor intensive to make a bunch though.  Don't find they store too well.

I have wanted to try kale chips for a few years but they're SO expensive!  So I decided to make my own and this recipe was WONDERFUL!  They were just the right amount of crisp but next time I'm going to try something other than salt.  The salt was great on them but I just want to experiment.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

It was the first time I had kale.I made these but sprayed with cooking spray instead of using oil.Instead of seasoned salt,I use some garlic salt(I put that on everything) and some pepper.I loved them. I just bought 2 bunches of kale today to make more.

Awesome!!!   I use lemon pepper or lemon herb seasoning and it is really refreshing from the standard seasoning salt.  Chips are light and crunchy, at 13 mins (depending on size of kale)

First of all I have tried kale a few times and I hated it. But I am trying to go healthy and gave this a shot. I have to say you have converted me in to a kale lover and not a hater. These chips were really good and easy to make. Even my kids loved it I cant believe my 3 year old who never wants to eat salad ate all this up and wanted more. That's amazing. Cooked well in 10 minutes. The only bad thing I have to say it was too salty but I can fix that in my next batch. I'm off to make more.

I used this recipe mainly to figure out how long I should cook the kale chips (I've never done it before today), so what I did after cutting the kale from the stems was drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, cover with an even layer of garlic powder, sprinkle a tiny bit of seasoning salt for flavor and then put a layer of bread crumbs for a little extra crunch. Cook for ten minutes or until crispy (they won't be hot) and enjoy! I couldn't believe how amazing they were!

Baked Kale Chips Haiku: "These were too salty, mine were done in 8 minutes. Leftovers were blegh." I like salt, I really really like salt, but these were crazy salty. I did as mentioned by the recipe submitter's review and used Pam to cut calories, and as others mentioned, aimed for using only the curliest of the curly pieces. I was neurotically checking on them even after 5 min., poking and stirring, and finding them crispy and done in just under 8 min. The crunchier of the pieces just crumbled into papery shards that flew everywhere when you took a bite, so clean-up around the table was laborious. The high salty factor had us lunging for our drinks, and what were leftover later on took on an unusual, displeasing texture. I thought they were good enough to make again as I love all things leafy and green, but I'll 1. use less salt, 2. bake less time, 3. leave them in larger pieces rather than cut into bite-size.

Super good. First time trying Kale and this is a really good basic recipe. I used lemon pepper salt instead of regular salt. Super easy to burn though, next time I'll probably reduce the heat to 300F and do them in batches. Deff want an atomizer for your oil, it's easy to use to much.

These were great.  Drizzled with olive oil and lightly salt/peppered.  350 for 10 minutes on my pizza stone.  They were crispy with a little bit of chew on the bigger pieces.  I did not preheat the stone.  Day 39 of an extended Whole30 and I was needing something that resembled potato chips.

I make these all the time! Great recipe as is, but you can also add other spices or flavored to your taste. I sprinkle a little garlic powder. Just don't over-bake or chips will taste bitter.

Was excited about trying these but not for us. My husband compared them to gathering dried leaves from the woods and sprinkling them with seasoned salt. I have to agree.

Made these exactly as written. My problem with them is they do not keep. They are crispy to start but if you dont finish them they soften up. I will make them again just in a smaller batch.

I have done these three times now.  The first time, they came out as if you walked in your yard and picked up a leaf in 100 degree weather and tried to eat it.  I trudged on.  The best way to do these: use cooling racks, dried kale in large pieces, toss in bowl with 1/2 to 1 teaspoon olive oil, squeeze with your fingers, pile on cooling racks.  The little amount of olive oil is enough and gets around. Squeeze, if you don't want to use your fingers, put in plastic bag and squeeze.  Cook at about 200 to 250 degrees only 8-10 minutes and then turn the oven off.  Look in on them every fifteen minutes.  At my high altitude I'm surprised they take less time.  Every oven and every location is different.  Season with Anything you like.  Of course, I used garlic powder and sea salt.
One time I added that adobe seasoning.  I will make again and again.  I love them once I found the right temp, time and size of kale.  LOVE THEM.  I suggest a timer to make sure you don't forget them.

I love this recipe! I prefer salty savory snack and they usually are not very healthy. But this is a keeper! I didn't use oil, just sprayed them down with PAM. Sprinkled half with season salt and the other half with garlic salt. I found at 10 minutes they were a bit soggy still, so I turned the oven off and left them in another 5 minutes. PERFECT CRUNCH! Next time I am thinking of adding a little Parmesan cheese. Thanks, delish!

I liked this. Simple enough to make. Instead of drizzling the oil over the kale, though, I thought it worked better to just pour a small amount of oil in a separate shallow bowl and quickly dip a bunch in--not so much that every bit is covered, but so that when you cook the kale in the oven, oil doesn't pool, making the kale extra greasy requiring you to paper towel the grease away.

Delicious as written.  Next time I'll leave the pieces larger as they're very fragile.
Only took 11-12 minutes.

I made a batch as described in this recipe and a batch with sesame oil and sesame seeds. Yum! Thanks for a good base recipe--you can do a lot of variations on this.

Delicious. I DO use curly kale and prefer it. I season the chips with garlic salt and a Tunisian spice mixture.

Figure out where is the best place to put your tray.  I put mine too low and they baked too fast and be careful with the salt.  It grabs the salt easily so mine came out salty since I didn't measure.

They cooked (in my gas oven) really quickly. Much quicker than the 10-15 minutes. I also made my a little too salty. I would try garlic powder/garlic salt next time. Not bad for a low-cal snack. I used olive oil spray.

Nope, not a fan of Kale. I know its very popular right now, and if I liked Kale, this would probably be very tasty, with the seasoning giving it a nice touch and the crispy kale having a good texture. I gave it 4 stars simply because I think others will enjoy. I just don't like kale.

10 minutes was just a little too long for my oven. The first batch came out slightly burnt, though still edible. I did about 8-9 minutes for the second batch and it was much better. For seasoning, I just did garlic salt and pepper and it was good.

Turned out great. I tossed them in a bowl with evoo and garlic salt and a little onion powder. I baked them for 10mins turning the pan halfway. I discovered they were crisp at first but later turned chewy so I put them in the oven at 225 until all the moisture was gone. Go easy on the salt, I added a little too much but they're still relish. My 16month old loves them!

These are delicious and so healthy.  I put in a bowl with the olive oil and tossed first to distribute it without using too much.  I think the misto would work great too.  Another variation I do for a side dish is same recipe, sautéed in a skillet on top of the stove.  One of my favorites!

Based on other reviews I lowered the temperature of the oven to 325*, shook the dry kale in a gallon zip lock bag (with air inside) with the oil and light seasoned salt and cooked it without the parchment paper for 6 minutes, shook rhe pan and rotated it in the oven for another 6 minutes. It was good... adding a sprinkle of Parmesan and Romano Cheese made it really tasty for us! Something different and much better for you then other munchies!

Great idea! I am on the Dr. Oz diet and so this is a great snack. I used a large bowl, mixed olive oil with sea salt, Mrs. Dash and pepper, spread the mixture all over the bowl then tossed in the kale, tossing gently, making sure all the pieces were lightly covered. I don't think there is an even coverage just by drizzling the oil and spices on the kale on the cooking sheet. 10 minutes at 350F was perfect, great flavor!

Great and easy recipe.  I ended up baking mine a few minutes longer, though during the last 5 minutes or so I would check them periodically and toss them to make sure they were crisping evenly.  I also added some nutritional yeast instead of the salt - delicious!

I'm a huge fan of kale and kale chips, so when I found this recipe a few years ago I was so happy! I've made kale chips using this basic recipe so many different ways I love to change up the spices for different flavors. I've also tried it with baby kale, mind you, if you try baby kale it cooks much faster, like five minutes or less so you have to watch them or they'll burn. I love this recipe because it makes kale chips actually an accessible snack for me to eat. It is so easy to make and I can eat them right out of the oven if I want to (usually I do).

So easy and so healthy! Instead of using oil, I sprayed the kale with Cooking Spray and it made the chips much less wet.. thus more crunchy!

I have made these before and the are SO good.  They melt in your mouth. I love how you can control how much salt you want to put on these.  I just do salt and pepper.. you could ever toss with some cayenne pepper to make a little spicy.

I bought Kale for the first time to make a salad - and had quite a bit left over. I found this recipe and thought I would try it !! My husband was skeptical -but guess what. They were a hit. I would put less salt next time !!! Delicious :)

I made three batched and didn't love them. I preferred the one sprayed with butter flavored spray. Put on a very little salt.

Simply amazing! Cannot make enough of it for my family. Each person will easily eat 2 bunches. I usually try and buy organic kale because then I don't have to worry about cleaning as thoroughly, risking really wet and soggy kale.i find there is typically less waste too. As other reviewers mention, go really easy on the olive oil to get the crispy kale. In my oven I do two trays, two levels for about 8 minutes, then I switch the trays and leave them in for another 2-3 minutes. Watch carefully - perfect to burnt is about a minute! Quick and easy treat for movie night!

This recipe is perfect. I use a really good olive oil and himalayan salt.....delicious and healthy. You can add any seasonings you like to meet your needs. Ive used fresh lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, red wine vinegar, garlic powder, cayenne pepper.....just about everything!

These are SO good.  My kids turned their noses up when they saw it but tried it and asked me to make more.  I've been eating Kale in a salad and didn't know it was so yummy baked.

These are great! As the original poster of this recipe mentioned, I do add spices to my kale. Sometimes it's a curry powder mix, chipotle powder, smoked paprika, or just plain sea salt. I also melt a bit of coconut oil and toss the kale in a bowl with my hands while drizzling some of the oil on top, followed by my spice of choice, then popping the tray in the oven. Yummy! Thanks for the great healthy snack recipe!

personally, i'm not a fan. the "chips" turned out having a burnt flavor to them (which was probably my fault) and cooked unevenly. half way through the baking time, they started smelling horrid even though they still seemed limp and raw. then, when i decided to take them out, they were way too salty and crispy. the number one problem was probably the size of the kale. in contrast to buying a bunch of kale, i used the bite sized bag of kale i already had and ended up with some really small, burnt, and shriveled chips. stupid me, all my fault yada yada yada, but i will not be making this again. however, i will mention that my beagle took quite a liking to them. (ate up the whole bowl of them) :)

I love this. I've never eaten kale before. I snacked on it right out of the bag in between cooking batches. I can't keep my hands off the kale cooked or not. BIG HIT! I used balsamic garlic olive oil.

Simple and delicious. I used Meyer Lemon olive oil and herbamare seasoning. Next time I'll fill my misto with the olive oil as someone suggested to cut down on the amount of oil on the chips. I made my first batch crispy and the second batch I let remain a little chewy. Both were great!

I need to play with this more to get it right. The pieces shrink a lot, and I tore them too small. Timing on the cooking, as mentioned by many others, is tricky. It is hard to get all the pieces to the same level of crispy. I used a half packet of ranch powder instead of the seasoning salt... I could probably have done a 1/3 of a packet. Overall, this recipe has a lot of potential. I like the taste of the crisps, and they are pretty easy to make. Plus my dog likes to gnaw on the kale ribs!

My daughter made these in her Pre-K cooking class and loved them so I decided to give them a try.  I totally over salted them, but will change that next time.  I also have a convection oven and they got very crispy in 8 minutes so I will lower the temp next time too.  That being said I loved them, and my kids like them too so they will be made frequently!  I am am salt and chip lover so this is a fantastic option for me!

I just didn't know what all the buzz was about Kale Chips. I bought a bunch of Kale, followed the recipe and LOVE them!
 I made mine in my convection oven and found about 7 min. was perfect. What a great snack! Who knew?

I don't have a salad spinner so I used a blow drier (like for your hair) on a low setting to dry the washed kale! Tossed the kale in the olive oil, baked 6 minutes, turned the kale and added salt and cracked pepper, and baked for 6 more minutes. perfect.

Followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results.  Hubby didn't care for, but he's a little less adventurous.  Next time I'll add a little heat with a dusting of cayenne pepper.

We love this healthy recipe snack!  We make this with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt.  We eat a mostly Mediterranean based  diet since all the recent medical research has shown extra virgin olive oil has so many health benefits.  Thanks!

This is AWESOME! I try to make it once a week at least. My 9 year old likes it too. I bake it for the full 15 minutes. They don't last long!

Ive made this twice now. They're addicting, I put a bit in small zip lock baggies to take on the go & have a bunch on hand as snacks. I use pam & also a bit of chili powder but I stick to the original recipe other than that.

I used the suggestion to add fresh lemon along with the olive oil and sea salt and it was delicious.  Definitely a must to ensure the kale is dry.  I baked for 20 minutes and it was yummy!

I buy so much Kale that it was finally time I tried to do this recipe. The directions are very simple and and you can add the seasonings that you like, which is what I did. I added garam masala and a bit of turmeric. The first time I did this they came out okay but a bit soggy. I think I didn't dry the Kale all the way. Second time was a charm. I made sure my Kale was dried all the way through. 15 minutes in oven and I had some nice cheap delicious chips. Will be using this technique often.

I was excited to try these but the results were poor. They didn't really crisp up and I tried a few batches. Someone said there is a fine line between them being uncooked and burnt and I found that was true. They didn't dry out crispy, they just stayed soft and soggy until they burnt :(

So quick and easy! Delicious & lightly crunchy :)
I used triple washed, already sliced kale. I tossed with less than a tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkled with Spike seasoning salt. Spread the kale on parchment paper on a large aluminum cookie sheet without sides. It took 10 min. at 350 degrees.

2 out of my 3 kids loved these. My oldest hated them, but I think he must just be a crazy teenager because they were good! My middle loved the BROWNEST ones (I would have called them slightly burned, but he might have stopped eating them) and my daughter liked the crispy but less brown ones. Adults preferred the "still pretty green" ones with a slight bit of chew left in 'em - we got all varieties on each pan. BTW - we used kosher salt (not seasoned) and tossed it all in a bowl to coat evenly. They were all gone in 20 minutes. I got a tip from someone that the leaves need to be completely dry before starting the prep work or they will end up mushy. I still can't believe we even tried this recipe, (thanks CSA for forcing us to go home with kale) but glad we did. Do not listen to people who say "they are EXACTLY like potato chips!". As good as these are, the taste in not the same; don't believe the hype. They ARE however, an excellent alternative (I think I might actually prefer these, but I don't want to admit that yet!) Thanks for posting!

The trick is not being tempted to use more oil; I pour oil and mix the kale in a bowl with my hands before spreading on the baking sheet. I don't use the parchment but have a nonstick sheet. Every week I try a different seasoning, but like Old Bay the best. We make these every Saturday while preparing dinner so we have our "popcorn replacement" for movie night later.

Instead of seasoning salt I used course sea salt and sprinkled sesame seeds over the top. I baked at 350 for 4 minutes, flipped, then baked for another 4 minutes and they came out just right.

I substituted the seasoned salt & used pink Himalayan salt instead & they still came out great!  Excellent healthy snack. This was my first Pinterest recipe & definitely won't be the last. (Thanks Trish for your getting me into Pinterest)

I don't have a salad spinner, and I might have taken these out too soon, but they were still great. I salted them after baking, as suggested in some of the reviews. Two of the kids liked them, but my husband thought I was trying to poison him. I wound up finishing the batch myself.

Very good considering I don't like kale.  My five-year-old who isn't as picky as I am dove right in and stuffed his face.  I didn't have a baking sheet (just moved, still packed) so I had to squeeze them in a baking dish, eat the crispy ones off the top and then put the rest back in the oven a few times. I could tell by touch which ones were done so it was easy to do some flipping part way through.  I will make these again since they are so healthy.

This was superb. I will have to play around with how much salt to use, as my first attempt, I over-did the salt, but absolutely superb. My hubby and I both loved it, and will definitely be making again!! Thanks for such an easy and fantastic way to make a great super-food!

This recipe made me realize that I really like kale!  I am always happy to find a new vegetable that I like.  Just a note because I messed it up the first time... a bunch is like the whole bunch you would buy at the store.  I misinterpreted a "bunch" the first time as "whatever looked like a lot to me" but they came out too salty because the ratio of seasoning salt to kale was not right.

I had to bake mine for double the amount of time in the oven the recipe states in order for them to come out right.  It is a little tricky.  Too much time in the oven and they have a slightly burnt flavor, too little time and they are soggy, or under cooked.  I am going to give it a try in the dehydrator next to see how that works.

A bit to salty for me, tossed the kale w/ olive oil and seasoned salt then baked ~ after 15 minutes took a few out that seemed done and then put the rest back in for another almost 10 minutes~ TAH BAH DAH~ CRISPY!  I will cut back on the salt next time but do like them.  instead of a salad spinner, I put paper towel around the inside of a large bowl and my colander and shook!  worked really well!  
thank you!

Made these the other night and they were delicious. Even my 7 yr old son had some and now everyday he wants to make more. What I did discover is NOT to put them in a sealed container and eat them the next day. They are not good at all. Make what you are going to eat the same day.

These were pretty good.  Reminds me of flash fried spinach.  For the people saying that they don't taste like potato chips, the description says that they are addictive LIKE potato chips.  Not that they taste like them.  I love my flash fried spinach with lemon juice squited on top and a sprinkle of freshly grated parm.  That made these perfect.  Great choice for a healthy snack.

These are great. I have tried them both with curly kale and with the Russian red kale. My boyfriend likes the curly better for the crunch; I kind of like the red Russian better because there is more flavor. They are also good with a little paprika or cayenne pepper. The one problem I have is that regardless of which one I make, I can't get them to stay crisp by the next day. At first I thought it was because I had put them in the fridge, but they still went soft when they were at room temperature

These were amazing, I was so shocked! I had never eaten kale before so I really had no idea what to expect. They are so crispy and light, and I love how they taste a little nutty, too! Even my husband liked these, which honestly surprised me. ;-)

These Kale Chips were just as good as the majority of the other reviews suggest; my husband was very doubtful, but after trying them, he is a believer!  Even my four year old liked them.

When baking them the first time, you might be like me and UNDER cook them for fear of burning them... then they don't taste as good (they just taste like heated kale, lol).  You definitely want them crispy, so I suggest just checking them every few minutes the first time.

Also, I found it helpful to put the washed, cut pieces in a bowl and toss them with the olive oil to ensure even coating.

Thanks for posting such a fabulous recipe!

I do like kale and was looking for a new way to incorporate it into our diet. I gave these a hearty attempt, but in all honesty, I did not like them at all. I made sure they were crisp but not scorched by watching them carefully. Still, the texture made it feel as though I was eating dried herbs. They have an aftertaste, but since I like kale that didn't bother me too much. My kids did not like them at all. Not one for waste, I crumbled them into a stew I had going.  I know many people seem to enjoy these, so I certainly think it's worth a try. Just not my cup o' tea.

I thought it was very good, but the amount of the seasoned salt was way to much even when I used a 1/4 teaspoon. I'm going to make it again this week, and use very, very little salt. The olive oil gives
it a very nice flavor so you really don't need all that salt.

Loved it !!!! Delicious...easy to make - I sprinkled them with some melted coconut oil and nutritional yeast instead and they were gone in seconds. Yum !!! Thank you Lucy. ( I also sprinkled some with red chili peppers for the spice lovers in our family and they raved too.

WONDERFUL!  I made these just as written and it was PERFECT.  I know there's lots of room for variation and I expect we'll try lots of ideas!  But if you're looking for an easy way to make great kale chips, this is a great way to go.  I baked mine for about 14 minutes and used Montreal steak seasoning.  As others have noted, the key is bake time -- if much of the leaf turns brown, they taste like charcoal.  The batch I made probably isn't perfect -- only the edges are really crisp, and I probably wouldn't serve these at a party because the middle of each leaf is so oily that it might be awkward to handle in a less-than-casual setting.  But maybe I can practice this recipe again and take care of that.  As a snack, this absolutely cannot be beat.  My results were excellent on the first try, after deciding on a whim to give this a shot and without paying much attention to the process.  I'm excited to think of how good they'll be once I've tweaked the recipe a bit for our tastes!  I'm so pleased, and so is my husband -- we have a garden full of kale that we now know exactly what to do with!

My wife and I actually really like kale, and have been meaning to try out kale chips for some time. We tried this recipe. We only baked them for 10 minutes. Some were burnt. We'd try them again, but other reviewers who did this ended up with the same bitter, burnt taste.

This was great! I picked up red kale, which made my chips LOOK super burnt, but they tasted great! We have a low tolerance for salt here, so, I will probably change to no salt seasonings and garlic when I make this again. Kale chips are a great sub for potato chips!

Yum! I had a big bag of pre-washed, pre-cut kale so this was super easy. Tossed it in a salad bowl with the olive oil and salt, then spread it out on a cookie sheet over parchment (super easy cleanup after!) In 15 mins I was chomping away on delicate and crispy kale chips, it really did taste a bit like potato chips. Be careful not to over-salt! There is a lot of shrinkage when you cook kale, so the salt will intensify. Try it, it's fun, delicious, and nutritious!

Be careful how much salt you add! Mine were too salty for my liking. Also I completely agree that you have to REALLY watch the cook time. My first batch turned out sightly singed - definitely doesn't taste great eating burnt kale. I did 8 minute at 275 on each side. Too much for my oven. I was very surprised at how good the crunchy textured ended up being.

A good introduction to kale in our house. Not super mind-blowing awesome, but definitely delicious and worthy of making again! I gently massaged a few handfuls of baby kale with garlic-infused olive oil and used onion powder and Lawry's to taste. Some chips were chewy and some were crisp, which was a nice contrast. I'd like to play around with spices, but this is a keeper and a good snack for this Super Bowl Sunday!

Weird -- but good!  I was afraid to try it and my hubby even more so...but had some leftover Kale and gave it a try....  surprisingly good!  BUT!  I put mine on a rack over the cookie sheet so heat could circulate...and mine was done at 350 in about 7 minutes...glad I read previous reviews and kept a very close eye on it...I imagine the smell of BURNT kale wouldn't be too great throughout the house.

Very good! Parchment paper is critical for making them crispy. I shook the kale in a zip lock with the olive oil to evenly disburse it. Worked much better than drizzling, which I did the first time I made them.

Amazing way to eat leafy greens! My husband and I both loved these chips. I did a big bunch of kale and found that, scrunching lightly to evenly cover the kale pieces with oil, I only needed maybe a teaspoon of oil for all that kale. The kids would not touch them, but they are veggiephobic so we settled for setting a good example by eating them all ourselves!

Great success!!
Delicious and healthy 
I used Misto to spray the olive oil, little salt and just a touch of Badia Tropical Seasoning (no MSG added) for flavor. 
Thanks for this awesome recipe

They are okay, just don't add too much salt or oil to them or they are terrible. My husband and I eat them as they are healthy and not bad if you go light on the oil and salt but they are certainly not something my kids would eat. all and all they are not bad.

A great and easy way to get your greens! esp for toddlers....that they are called "chips" helps and kids gobble them up every time.  I toss the kale with olive oil and sea salt before placing on the sheet, coats all of the leaves evenly and gives me greater salt control.

Kids LOVED these!  They have a taste similar to pumpkin seeds.  I put the kale pieces in a bowl, drizzled the olive oil then stirred to coat the kale.  I salted before cooking.   They were done within 10 minutes and gone within 2 minutes!  Thanks for sharing!

We like this recipe.  The kids ate it right up.  We did a batch with Seasoned Salt and they liked that one the best.  i thought it was a bit labor intensive for such small results.  But it did taste really good while it lasted.  I will definitely do this one again.

i LOVED it - so easy to prepare  .. such a GOOD flavor ..  could have eaten the entire bag by myself (no joke) ...  i did NOT use parchment paper - i just sprayed a pan with pam - then tossed with the oil - spread out - used a salt grinder over top - and it was PERFECT

These were super crispy and lovely! Thanks for the great recipe! (I will mention that, although I gave them 5 stars, mine actually didn't taste all that great because I read "salt" instead of "seasoning salt" and they were super salty! I know this is totally my fault, but I hope nobody else makes this mistake because it really isn't nice!)

OMG this recipe is awesome!!! It's so hard to create such a healthy snack... and so easy.  I cut the kale in pieces as instructed and tossed the kale with olive oil and sesame seed oil.  Once I placed the kale in a single layer on parchment lined cookie sheet I sprinkled some sesame seeds on the kale then baked it for 10 minutes.  It turned out perfect.  The second batch got a little too brown in spots so turning the baking sheet half way through the cooking process is probably a good idea.  This is a recipe I will make all the time.  I am so glad I tried this one.  What a great treat!

I have never been a fan of kale. However, my boyfriend (who is insanely healthy) has talked about trying these in the past and since he always cooks for me I figured I could make these for him. Easy enough and definitely delicious. I am now considering going back to the store to buy another bunch of kale so I can eat the ones I made for him ... easy AND delicious! 

I will update once he has tried them.

Really great...I guess my oven must be really hot because my first batch burnt to a crisp after 8 minutes.  Ended up going with about 5 minutes at 350 in the end.  You really need to watch them like a hawk the first time around to see where your oven is at...they go from perfect to burnt in a matter of seconds.

Soooooo addictive!  Be careful to have just one layer of kale.  When using an entire bunch, I use 2 cookie sheets.  My favorite seasoning so far is just garlic salt.  But a little bit goes a long way, so I only use about 1/4 tsp.

350 is too hot, I did mine at 275 for 20 minutes, stirring them once.  SO good that I am giong to have to start growing kale so I can make it more often.  I nearly inhaled the entire bunch.

Can't get enough of these.  

I customized them to include about a teaspoon of red wine vinegar or maple syrup in addition to the EVOO and salt.  Increases cooking time to 18 minutes but the results are awesome.  I had four bunches of these today and we ate all of it for dinner.

EASY to make-was our family's first time.  We grew our own Kale and making a fun treat like this really helps encourage my kids to eat healthy!  Tasted fine! :)

I make this all the time! Sometimes with PAM, or I add garlic powder. Do NOT over salt these. They will be gross! And you want them crispy. So yummy!

Simply delicious.  I too, cut back on time and temp.  Adjusting for high altitude in Costa Rica.  EVOO and garlic powder, yummy.

Who would have known?  These are AMAZING!!  I would never, ever, think of eating Kale prior to making these.  They are crispy, salty, and deliciously good for you :)  BEWARE of adding too much seasoning...these can get overs-alted easily.  I love salt, but I heeded other's reviews and only lightly sprinkled them, which was perfect.  I also used olive oil spray for ease.  I have a convection oven, and at 350 for about 8 minutes, they came out super crispy.  These are a new favorite - even my veggie-hating 13 year old son loved them :0)

Never having eaten kale before, and having seen this on Dr. Oz, I was so in hopes that I had found a nutritious alternative for my crunch needs. Unfortunately, I don't like the taste of kale and dousing it in olive oil and seasoning, I used a teaspoon of BAM (recipe found here) didn't help. However, if you like kale to start with, then you should love it.

I can't figure out how to keep them from turning into paper. The taste was okay but it was like eating tissue paper. Definitely not dippable.

These are wonderful! Instead of regular salt I used garlic salt and it was even better.  Some of them turned out soggy, but still delicious and nutritious.

Suprisingly good.  Tried making these for the first time today and they were surprisingly good.  They did taste like a light and fluffy chip.  I used olive oil cooking spray vs. drizzling olive oil for a more consistent (and lighter) layer of olive oil. Go light on the salt. I also saved the stems to use in my juicer so that nothing goes to waste.  I will definitely be making these again.  Plan to feed some to my husband tonight.

I had kale for the first time last weekend at an organic farmer's market. They did a demonstration of sauteeing it. It took about 2-3 minutes and was sprinkkled with sea salt. I was hooked and now I find I can do it in the oven also. The trick is to get the kale evenly coated with the olive oil.

This recipe couldn't be easier!  Well, except for spraying them with non-stick cooking spray (canola in my case) instead of using oil.  I can't believe how close to potato chips they actually tasted!  I could eat a whole bunch of kale myself!

YAY!!! I have NEVER tried kale but due to its amazing nutritional value decided to buy some. This was the first recipe I tried, so, I followed it to the letter and LOVED THEM. My husband would like a little garlic in the mix, but that's personal preferance. THANK YOU for the AWESOME recipe!

The curly kale was still bitter.  It was also too salty.  Perhaps 1/2 tsp of salt is more than adequate?  Will recycle this batch of kale chips into a tomato based soup.  Waste not want not!

I tried this with the family last night and they loved it! Even my "picky" Granddaughter was disappointed when they were all gone. I used kosher salt instead of seasoned salt. It doesn't get any easier than this!

Thank you so much for sharing this! I have NEVER even tried kale before this and I love these chips..I was craving salt today and instead of reaching for my hubby's high fat chips, I made these! I broke off lots of pieces from the main branch of the kale and lined my pan with foil, sprayed the the foil with Pam and spread out the kale chips all over, I then sprayed them with olive oil Pam No fat or calories(well if any, very little) and sprinkled some kosher salt(very little and some garlic powder and baked for 7-9 minutes in a 350 electric oven...so YUMMY!!! my new snack;-)

A little hint about buying Kale.  Make sure it is fully green, and make sure that you don't overuse the olive oil because it will make the chips really soggy!

I was just given some kale and have never had it before. SO I looked up some recipes.  I was not sure about this but it sounded good so made just 4 leaves using butter flavored spray as suggested in another post, just a quick "Fly-over" of salt and some Italian seasoning.....WOW from me and the granddaughter... not so much from the hubby so only a 4 star!!!

I thought they were just okay, but my kids loved them!  I was raised on Doritos and Pringles, therefore my expectation may have been too high.  My kids rarely eat potato chips so they were totally content with crunchy kale.  I'll definitely make it again for them, but may need a few more trials to get used to them myself!

Easy and surprisingly delicious.   This will definitely be my new go to snack.  I did not use parchment paper and they were perfect to me.   Even my particular about everything, husband, likes them!  I am waiting to see how long they keep, to see if I can make large batches.

AWESOME... 
The texture was amazing!!! Crispy for the first few chews and then soften into complete deliciousness!!! 
To avoid uneven cooking toss half way through, don't over oil drop the heat to 325 and keep an eye after 10 minutes.
The salt recommendation was a tad too much for me. I thought it distracted from the natural flavor of the kale. Unlike potatoes, kale has a brilliant flavor when roasted.
Will be making constantly!!! Thank you!!!

My husband gobbled them up! I followed the recipe to a T and they were fantastic. I will continue to play around with different seasonings for a change of pace. We already enjoyed dill, and chili. The curry was a bit overpowering! Will definitely make again!

I thought these were really good as soon as they came out of the oven, but after about 20 minutes of sitting in the pan they became soggy- I was really dissapointed because I thought this would be a great way for my kids to eat their veggies... Boohoo! Wouldn't make again

I still have kale growing in my backyard and this is a great way to use the last of my fall crop. My 6 and 3 year olds love these and the 6 year old even wants them in his school box!  Adding Apple cider vinegar reminded of us eating salt and vinegar potato chips...but much better and healthier for you!

Used Johnny's Seasoning yum!

I was pretty disappointed with these. I'm not too familiar with kale, so i was surprised and how bitter mine was. I also oversalted the first time, like many others. Less is definitely more! Will not make these again.

I made these too salty as well, but they were still AWESOME! I was thinking this was crazy, but when they came out and hubs and I crunched into the first couple we were sold. Will most definitely make again. 11 minutes in our oven was perfection.

Wow!  Used PAM olive oil spray as suggested and sprinked with seasoning mix of sea salt, chili powder, and ground freeze dried garlic.  Can't wait to experiment with other seasonings.  Anyone ever try a little balsamic & EVOO on them?  wondering if that will be too wet...

Wow....I'm not sure what potato chips you guys are eating, but these aren't ever going to be a suitable substitute.  They do cook unevenly, and I did 3 pans full, varying the time each time.  Some ended up crispy and some limp.  You must have to eat the entire batch in one sitting because the next day, they were limp.  Just not my cup of Kale.   This recipe makes me sad for vegetarians or people trying to cut calories.

Very good, my 5 year old has just ate a whole bunch of kale. I did half the bunch with olive oil and Braggs Amino Acids, and the other half with olive oil and BBQ sauce. I found that I had to turn the pieces over so that they wouldn't cook to the pan.

So quick. So easy. I used sea salt instead of season salt. Took them to a diner party with children, and they ate them up. Who knew Kale could be this good? This will be my new go to snack...

These were awesome and super simple.  I brought some to my sister who is a raw eater and buys kale chips at WF's religiously.  She is going to make a batch in her dehydrator - since that would be the "raw" way to make them.

Five stars for an inventive recipe that's healthy and guilt free, yet yummy!  I put too much kale on the sheet the first batch, but second batch was better.  Used a bag of clean and cut kale.  Next time I'll cut out the stems as they didn't really dry out enough to be crunchy.

Really tasty, but WAY too much salt at 1 tsp.  1/4 tsp would probably be fine.  Also, to get the proper crunch, I needed 15 min at 350, plus another 10 at oven cooldown; this could probably be reduced to the 10-15 at 350 if I'd not only spun the kale but patted it dry.

OMG, a must try.  Just make sure you bake it enough, you can even go over the 15 min, I did 20 and it was perfect.  You can even drizzle a little less olive oil, it was just perfect!

Really tasty, and really easy. You can add any seasonings you want (I added a bit of seasoning salt and a bit of grated parmesan). I couldn't get all of the kale pieces to cook evenly but I didn't mind to much. My boyfriend didn't like them but I will definitely be making them again.

My oven wasn't even up to 350 degrees when they started to burn after 6 minutes.  I took them out and was able to eat some of them, but they weren't anything I'd want to eat again.  I used organic baby kale and washed and dried the kale leaves.

OMG!  I was soooo skeptical, no way it's like a chip I thought.  Well I was wrong.  the timing is the most important thing.  Making sure they're as dried as possible before baking.  My kids didn't go for them, but I loved them! I used Pam butter spray, NoSalt, and garlic powder.  yum

These are great! Most recently I sprinkled w/a generous amount of nutritional yeast (to give a cheesy flavor), salt, and a little bit of cayenne pepper. Delicious!

not bad, I jazzed them up with Mrs. Dash, some cayenne, some garlic powder.  They're good but will never put Pringles out of business!

I've never eaten kale before this recipe and I'm shocked that I enjoyed these. They are very light and I couldn't stop eating them. I went a little over-board with the seasoned salt and olive oil. Next time I may just use plain sea salt and toss the leaves in a tsp of olive oil. I caught my three year old snacking on them after turning his nose up when I was in the room. ;-)

Wow! This surpassed my expectations. Super easy to make, healthful, and delicious! I didn't have parchment paper but Reynolds non-stick foil worked like a charm. The edges started looking extremely brown right at 9 minutes, so I took the first batch out and they were very crispy. I did the second batch for 8 minutes and they turned out perfect. Crispy, but none of the pieces tasted charred. I can't wait to make them for my hubby. He loves Kale and will be very surprised at this new way to eat it :)

What a great way to serve Kale.  My 10 year old now requests that I make this dish.  He will eat it with a meal or just as a snack.

I LOVE kale chips and I love this easy recipe.  Other variations I use are sprinkling 1 TBSP of ranch powder or 1 Tbsp of cheese (popcorn) powder onto kale and bake.  These both make fabulous flavorings!

Just as the others said, this is a great recipe.  Very yummy, and easily adapted to whatever seasonings you like.  I think the trick is to really watch closely the chips after 7 to 8 minutes.  Keep pulling the tray out and as they crisp, pull off those that are ready and put the tray back in the oven.  I did that 5 to 6 times before they were all done. It's a little finicky, but well worth the results.

This is a healthy, easy-to-make snack. My husband LOVES these! Since we can buy bags of pre-cut kale at the market, it's a matter of spraying with olive oil and blending your own seasoning. At several occasions we have added the following seasoning in various mixes: curry, cayenne, cumin, and/or chile. (Hmmmm...a little cooking alliteration!). Very good. Crunchy, healthy alternative to  crackers or corn chips for accompanying soups or stews.

I don't love kale, but I try to eat it because I know it's so healthy.  This is definitely the best way I have found to prepare it!  I used olive oil in a spray can instead of drizzling, which worked great and is less oil.  It says it serves 6, but I just ate an entire bunch of kale!

Delicious and easy.  Make sure you cut off the tough stem - this works well with kitchen shears.  I sprinkled some Sharp Cheddar powder from Land O Lakes over them and they were fantastic!

I just made this and they were awesome. No bitter taste as some reported. I made a small batch so took the time to massage olive oil on each section. Sprinkled with sea salt and a little ground jalepeno and they were absolutely awesome. And talk about healthy..will make these time and time again when craving something salty...

I thought these tasted great with just sea salt sprinkled on. I tried them with 2 kinds of kale, one curly, one not and they were both pretty good. I tasted them warm and though they would be ok stored in a plastic container. Hopefully the kids will like them too.

Oh My! These were delicious!! I was skeptical at first, like many others, but I tried it and it was amazingly good! My husband loved it as well and wanted to know if I could pack him "kale chips" him is lunch for tomorrow. I did use cooking spray like others suggested and I think next time i will use garlic salt. Over all, Kale Chips were a hit!

Thanks for the easy recipe! I baked these directly on a cookie sheet. Sprayed them with Pam. Salted lightly with sea salt. They were tasty and everyone loved them. I'm not exactly sure how long they cooked, because I was in the middle of a dinner party- so kept setting the timer for 2-3 minutes to be sure I didn't forget them. I will watch the clock better next time. 
Thank you! Taste just as good as the kale chips at Whole Foods. :-)

These were great, had to stand in front of my oven to keep checking on them as my oven has one setting "hot as hell."  As I am quite the novice cook so wax paper=parchment paper.  Overall really good, wish someone had some flavor ideas to get some more flavor like chip flavors; BBQ, ranch, spicy, etc.

Absolutely amazing.  I made the chips to your specifications with the exception that I used Mrs Dash and paprika to season. I am on a low low carb, no salt diet.  Next time I will use garlic powder or onion powder.  Thank you for the recipe.  I was really missing my potatoe chips.

These are so yummy!  I watched them closely, and I'm glad I did--they only took 7ish minutes in my oven at 350.  Made some with garlic salt and some with cayenne pepper, too.

I'm going to be honest I was very skeptical about how good Kale chips were going to be. I needed something that fit into my Paleo diet & this met the standards. WOW! I was seriously blown away at how good these really were. I highly recommend everyone to just try them out. Delicious!!

These are awesome! My husband also thought I was nuts when I first made these, but now to his surprise, he likes them too! I had to experiment with the salt a bit, too much for me at first, but adding the Parmesan added a lot to it!

Kale was everywhere at the Farmer's Market today, so I picked up a bunch and tried this recipe. 

I cooked the kale as directed, but the chips were still a bit limp and wet. I transferred the soggy chips to a baking rack, turned off the oven and placed the rack in the oven. After about 30 minutes (I had forgotten about them!), I returned to find the chips perfectly dry and crisp without being browned or burnt. They are great! 

My 13 year old just came home and tried them and asked if I would make them again. 

Thanks for posting this recipe - a full five stars from me!

These are AMAZING!  What a great, nutritious snack for my two year old and I!  And very easy to do.

I think I used a lil too much salt and oil, so my suggestion is to use less than you think you should.  You can always add more!  I baked mine for ten minutes exactly.  They turned out perfect.  

Thanks for this recipe!  It's a keeper!

I have never tasted anything like these but once I started making the and eating them I can't stop. In the past two weeks I've fixed and eaten 14 servings. My only complaint is at myself for not trying them sooner.

My kids finished the whole tray in an hour.  I hadn't been able to get them to eat greens until finding this recipe. I used an olive oil mister and sea salt.

Wonderful idea. I followed the tips and used olive oil spray, garlic salt, onion powder and paprika (I did not have any season salt) I baked the bunch torn up small on two cookie sheets with the parchment paper and it was perfect at about 11 minutes. Yummy and great use for kale when you don't want hot soup in the summer! Thank you!

These are yummy!!  I did tweak it a little with different flavors, but it is great to find a extremely healthy "chip" that won't make you feel disgusting after eating.

Wow! I loved these! Thanks for the receipe Lucy! It is always great to find a HEALTHY snack you can make.  To save myself chopping, I bought pre-washed and pre-chopped (use half the bag, probably a little more expensive than bushes of kale, but less work for you).  I did a 1/4 teaspoon of low sodium soy sauce and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and came out great in 12 minutes! Some of my kale could have been a little more crispy, so i may try 14 minutes next time.

the cook time was too long and my first batch burned.  My second was cooked just perfect but they were still extremely bitter with a nasty after taste.  maybe i used the wrong kind of kale but they were almost unbearable.

I think these came out like they were supposed to but I wasn't thrilled.  They were very fragile and had a strong Kale taste (which is to be expected) that was a bit much for me.

This is UNBELIEVABLE! Who would have thought that kale could taste like potato chips?! I oil-coated the leaves individually with my hands. It was more even that way and I used less oil! Great recipe! Thank you for sharing! :)

These are so good. I prefer them overcooked a little, as they don't store too well if they are chewy. I baked them at 300 for about 15 minutes. I also just sprayed parchment paper with canola oil, then sprayed the tops of the leaves as well. I added some cavendars salt free seasoning. Make these in bulk, because they disappear quickly.

These were GREAT!  We all loved them including the kids.
A local TV show had the recipe with higher heat at 425, and it worked fine on an aerated pizza pan and stirring.
We used high quality olive oil and sea salt.
Love it.

Very good.  I use kale in my homemade soups and always have a lot left over and don't know what to do with it.  I am hooked on these chips.  Just watch them closely in the oven, look at them after 7 min. and don't put too much salt on them.  I can't stop eating them.  Now I need to run out and buy some more kale!!

I made this 3 times to see if it would improve.  I had a hard time getting it crunchy so I left it on longer. It burned.  It really shrinks down to nothing. I liked the few that got crunchy. My family would not eat it. It tasted like brussel sprouts to me and that is one of my favorite vegetables. I will try it again, I just need to tweak it to get it crunchy. It may have something to do that I am at a high altitute, or perhaps I put too much olive oil on it. Will keep trying.

I'm really into "super foods" but I have two very picky young eaters at home, so I was anxious to try this one. I tried three different flavors in one batch to see which was best. I used soy sauce on some, salt on some, and parmesan and salt on the rest. I took them out at exactly 10 minutes and not a minute too soon. The soy kale was the only one not slightly overcooked. The parm kale was the most overcooked. They were all tasty (and I'm not much a green things eater), but my fav was the parm. I thought the soy was a little strong tasting, but I could have just used too much. As for the picky eaters verdict: my four year old liked it, my one year old wouldn't touch it simply because it was green. We'll try her again later. :) Big thumbs up!! My advice is to practice with this one a little to get the flavor you like and the cooking time just right.

These were very good if they came out ok, but some burned if you didn't catch them in time.  Some cooked before others, necessitating  my checking them constantly after 5 minutes and taking some off the baking sheet and letting others stay a  minute longer or so and then checking again and again. A complicated process to catch them just right at a crispy stage before burning. They tasted great and I am not a kale eater. I am not sure it is worth the trouble of it all. I made it from a large prewashed, organig back because the other kale is said to be high in pesticides.

I followed the recipe to a T twice in a row and it burnt twice in a row!!! They weren't even in the oven for 5 minutes before they were ruined. I have no idea what I did wrong or what needs to be tweaked. But something about this recipe is off.

Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!  I don't know what I expected, but it certainly wasn't this crisp and light treat!  I have a "salty" (vs. sweet) tooth, so I'm constantly looking for healthy snacks in that area.  I just found it!  You put one thing in the oven...and out comes something totally different!

YUM!  However, a word of caution (and this may be from over baking) but I choked on them and so did my daughter.  It got stuck in my airway and I struggled to get it out.  My daughter (3) ended up vomiting in an attempt to remove it. But, they taste good! :)

I only remove the large stems, the rest stay with the leaves. I pat dry with paper towel. I don't use parchment paper- don't seem to need it, just spray sheet with oil. I also spray the leaves with olive oil and sprinkle with seasonings based on my taste- sometimes garlic salt, or sea salt or cajun- an addictive, can't stopping eating them snack!

These were delicious!  Taste was awesome - next time I will use less cayenne as I made them a bit too spicy to please all my guests, but they were gobbled up by those who could handle the spice.  Going to the store to buy more Kale to make again!  Oh, I just sprayed with olive oil cooking spray and they were not greasy and still delicious!
Thanks for the healthy snack!

As expected, these got mixed reviews at my house. Surpisingly, my pickiest eater seemed to enjoy them the most and my "foodie" actually spit them out! It's best to prepare and eat them immediately. They're not so great the next day.

My family LOVED this.  I even got my 2 year old son (who has refused to eat anything other than PB&J lately) to eat lots of it.  I tried it with crisco butter flavor cooking spray for one batch and olive oil for the other.  The spray actually tasted better to us and was easier.  I did not wait for them to get brown on the edges, just dark green and tested for crispness.  My husband who normally snubbs my healthy twists on dishes even admitted this was very good.

I was skeptical, but had a big bag of kale from the wholesale club.  I used wax paper, salt & pepper, and sprayed the leaves with cooking spray plus drizzled a bit of olive oil on them.  Baked at 350 for 10 minutes.... SUPER GOOD!!!!   Thank you!!

Delish!  I baked mine for about 7 minutes in a glass dish at 375.  I agree with some others that spacing the leaves out a bit and not stirring while cooking gave the best results.  Also, use a little less salt than you think you should.

We have never ate kale before and friend at work recommended this recipe.  After reading reviews, only springled a little bit of seasoned salt and also added parmesan cheese.

Very simple and good!  I used a combination of seasoned salt and garlic salt and sprayed the pan with olive oil, sprinkled it with salts, placed the kale on the pan then sprayed the kale with olive oil and sprinkled with the salts.  My husband thought they had a weird after taste, I liked them!  Great simple snack.

These are great! I did a variation on the recipe and set the oven to 300 degrees F for 25 minutes. Also I used cooking spray and Mrs. Dash. This is going to be a snack staple in my 1200 calorie-a-day diet.

I came across this recipe randomly, saw the number of people who rated it so high and HAD to try it! I sprayed with buttery flavored "Pam like" spray, and used seasoned salt.They taste very light, airy and it takes a lot to get the taste of the kale. I  think one would eat them (and I will again) for the benefits of kale which are many.  My husband ate them and said he'd eat them again. They were delicious warm. We don't have any to taste cooled!

This is sooo good! Just be careful with the seasoned salt. I felt it was too much for the recipe.  Great way of getting your vitamin D.  I'm going to crush it up and sneak it into the kids foods.

Delicious! We used just regular sea salt. These come out tasting and smelling a lot like popcorn. They do burn easily, so keep a close eye on them.

This is definitely a healthy alternative to potato chips. I tossed in olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt. Mine were ready at 10 minutes, nice and crispy. Just don't expect to be able to dip them in anything, they are fragile. Next time I will try with sesame oil instead of olive to mix it up.

I get a box of "whatever's fresh" organic veggies from my local health food store weekly and I always hope kale is in there.  I rinse it, spread it out on a baking sheet, sprinkly chili powder and seasoning salt all over lightly and bake at 350 for about 15-20 minutes til crisp. I eat the whole batch in one sitting. Someday I may even share this with my husband...but hasn't made it that far yet. Don't you love eating healthy when it tastes like it came from the junk aisle??!!

As good as you can get for a low calorie snack.   I did not have parchment paper so I just sprayed the baking sheet with cooking spray.  After the first batch I ended up following the advice of others and reduced the temperature and cooking time.

A couple times a year I make a soup that calls for some kale, but I never end up using it all.  So I tried this recipe, and it turned out great!  My husband and kids didn't like it, though.  But I probably will make them again just for myself the next time I have left over kale.  Thanks!

Nutritious and tasty snack, and a great alternative to chips. I like to use different seasonings for variety. Like other reviewers said, watch them closely, because too much time in the oven will leave you with kale crumbs.

Simply amazing! However, I love spicy chips so I prepared olive oil infused with jalepenos (I let it stand in a cool, dark cabinet for a couple days for full flavor) Had some for lunch the other day and they were the ultimate munchy-curber!  I'm curious how long it would store before becoming rancid. I usually eat them all but what if I wanted to make them the day before or a special occasion?

these were...different....but I ate the batch I made.  I guess I have to say I liked them...I used sea salt and truffle salt on them.  While I will say I liked them, I would not serve them at a party because they are just too "different".  but I might do them again for a snack for myself.

I made one tray of these, and ate them by myself in about 3 minutes. I couldn't stop eating them! Used sea salt instead of seasoned salt. I'm definitely making them for a party tomorrow night.

Wow! I made these for me because I have Candida- had store-bought tortilla chips for everyone else, but they ate mine instead! Daughter-in-law even asked to take leftover chips home with her! Sooo easy! I used the olive oil in the mister instead of liquid-form... Fabulous!!!

Surprisingly delicious.  It has a nice, nutty flavor that reminds me of roasted pumpkin seeds.  I didn't have parchment paper and used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil and it worked great.

Very good! They taste almost like a rustic potato chip. Not exactly, but close enough. Especially  when on a diet! Thanks for a great recipe that im sure to repeat over and over again.

Really good.  Keep a close eye, as others have said, or they will get crumbly.  I tossed the shredded kale in olive oil and sprinkled it with garlic powder and a little salt before baking.  It turned out great!

What a great way to eat kale!  I used the olive oil Pam spray and they turned out great.  This will be my main way to make kale now since my husband liked it as well..he wasn't too fond of steamed kale.

Disapointed. I followed directions to a T, and these were nasty. I had company and nobody like them. I rechecked the recipe after 1st batch and other recipes online because I thought I did something wrong. Directions were followed to a T. I do admit it was the 1st time I ever tried kale, so wasn't sure what it tasted like to begin with. Maybe it's just an acquired taste. I did like the crispyness & texture. I may try this again with spinach.

Really yummy alternative to regular corn or tortilla chips. Kids will love them and get their greens. My 14 month old son kept asking for more. I used a bit too much sea salt and oil. Less is best or the kale gets a bit soggy.

The texture to me is reminiscent of very tender popcorn. I really like the delicate crispness. The seasoned salt didn't lend much flavor to this so next time I think I'll try All-season and sea salt, or maybe sprinkle on some butter flavor popcorn seasoning.

Delicious! I can't believe what a wonderful snack these are (although, it's kind of like eating air and I wouldn't expect to get filled up by them at all - they more fulfill the snacking craving). Like others, I found it difficult to get these to the perfect crispness. However, we preferred them a bit under-cooked as opposed to the crumbly, slightly burnt over-cooked version, so we erred on the side of taking them out too early. A delicious snack that I will definitely make again!!!

Very good snack.  I used Russian red kale, which is a flat kale.  It was done in 10 min and was very tasty.  I only got to try a couple because the kids devoured them so quickly.

I LOVE kale chips. What a great way to eat your vegetables. I made these for my 8 and 11 year old cousins and, while they made horrific faces when I showed them the kale, they wouldn't stop eating! These are my go-to snack. So easy and yummy!!

My 2 year old (who doesn't like cooked kale) keeps on asking me for more kale chips!!! I'm not a nutritionist, so I don't know if baking means less antioxidants, minerals, vitamins.... But it's surely more then not eating them at all!!! Thank you so much!

This is good! Obviously it's could never replace potato chips, but it's surprisingly delicious. I made it with burgers and a garbanzo bean salad for a healthier bbq night. They were great!  My only complain is they are difficult to store. I thought I could make a bunch a head of time, but they are so delicate it's almost impossible to store them.

SO EASY! Incredibly tasty too.  Skipped the parchment paper and sprayed a sheet with Olive Oil PAM.  Sprayed the kale with more PAM and sprinkled with garlic salt, pepper, and salt.  Baked for about 8 minutes.   Turned out PERFECT!

Love these! My Kids Loved them! So easy and versatile.  I added a little garlic and skipped the seasoned salt. Used Sea salt instead.

Who is a clever girl? LucyDelRey that's who! These were fabulous! Thanks to the other reviewer's suggestions on cooking time & oven temp, mine turned out just right. This is the perfect way to get your crunch on without any guilt at all. Applause, applause! :o)

Yummy, crispy deliciousness. Mistakes I made - forget to put kale through salad spinner adding olive oil. Because of that I think it made cooking time longer and consequently chips a little crisper than they would have been otherwise. Afterward, tried using beet greens I had on hand. Kale is much better. Beet greens too delicate I think. Will definitely try this one again.

This recipe is ridiculously simple and delicious! I bought Kale at the grocery store at the suggestion of a physician, and had no idea what to do with it! This was the first time I've cooked with kale and I felt a little guilty making "chips" with it, but they are so healthy and delicious. I read the tips others had written and baked for 9 minutes at 330 degrees.  I also decided to use the spray olive oil sprinkled the kale with a little seasoned garlic salt! One thing I would suggest is to make sure that some of the bigger thicker leaves are cut into smaller pieces. The bigger pieces were nice and crisp on the outside but still needed more time on the inside - while the smaller pieces were perfect. Don't over season. You can always add more salt at the end if they aren't salty enough for you. After making these I wished I had more Kale!!

I actually think this is a PERFECT potato chip substitute. Yes, it doesn't taste exactly like them, but it is surprisingly similar. Also, just be careful w/ the amount of salt you put. The Kale bakes to be very thin. And I think you can have fun with all sorts of "potato" chip seasoning. I used the curly kale, and I thought it was great. Put some garlic powder and salt. Will try different things like Paprika, etc. Wonderful for when you've purchased too much Kale!

A tasty way to eat kale! I followed other reviewers suggestion and baked at 340 degrees, and started checking after 7 minutes. Mine needed just 9 minutes total. I used the Misto with olive oil, and lightly sprinkled with sea salt. Very good, thanks for sharing such a clever idea.

I liked the crispiness of the kale, but 1 tsp of seasoning salt is way too much and makes it taste bad. This could be good if the seasoning complimented the kale.

Great use of extra kale without compromising the nutritional value.  My husband, two-year-old and I devoured these one night with dinner, and they give the salt and crunch that is often all you're looking for when you reach for chips.  We'll be having these regularly!

Great idea.  We got 5 bunches of kale in our organic delivery and this recipe saved me from wasting!  I love the flavor.  I used Mrs. Dash's no-salt SPICY mixed it with the olive oil.  Thanks!

Yum!  I was very skeptical because I don't like kale in other dishes, but these were really good!  Great for satisfying that crunch/salt craving.  The only problem is that they're not very filling (but what can you expect from a bunch of dried leaves right?!).

These are delicious!  I baked them on 330 (as another reveiwer suggested) but it took my kale just under 8 mins to be perfect.  They are a wonderful snack, they taste a bit like veggie chips only lighter in texture of course.  Great recipe for left over kale.

You have to like Kale to like this recipe.  I made several batches.  Like the recipe mentions, there is a fine line between crisp and burnt.  Even slightly browned they can taste quite burned.  These are a very good alternative to potato chips.

Yummy!  I used frilly red kale from the farmers market, and cut the entire stem out of the leaf.  I didn't bake as long as suggested - I checked on these a couple of minutes before the suggested time, and they were done.  The consistency is kind of chip-like, and the flavor is interesting.  It makes a nice salty TV snack!

These were good but I couldn't get all of the pieces to crisp up.  Next time I'll try making it in smaller batches.  Seemed to crisp up only when there was just one layer of kale on the baking sheet at a time.

Very good.  I seasoned with adobo one time, sea salt the next.  Need to watch closely because they burn in an instant- but they're still tasty.

These have a light, crispy texture....but taste quite bitter (even with all the salt). I would say that these are only for people who really like the taste of kale.

This is very good.  I sprayed the leaves with Pam (cooking spray) and sprinkled garlic salt and pepper.  I put it in the oven for 10 minutes.  It was nice and crispy.  I'll definitely make it again.  Besides, it's so easy to make.

Yummy, healthy. and so simple! My toddler couldn't get enough of them - she kept calling them potato chips. Yes, there is a slight kale aftertaste (it IS kale, after all), but they do in fact taste like potato chips when you bite into them. What do chips taste like other than oil and salt, anyhow? We are going to be making more of these right away tomorrow!

I never write reviews but this recipe compelled me to do so.  Outstanding!!  So yummy!  Quick!  Easy!  Nutritious!  Even the ones that didn't get quite as crispy were still delicious.

Interesting, different and tasty.  I did sprinkle a little garlic powder in addition to the seasoned salt.  Sprayed the kale with "Olivio" spray instead of using the oil called for.  The recipe submitter's review states that spraying them is a good way to do it.  I agree.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again!

Suprisingly delish! Light, airy, crispy. I shake kale with oil and seasonings in big ziplock bag. Love these!! Very unique idea!

Use cooking spray, and these are the dieter's potato chips! Great recipe. I use salt and garlic powder instead of seasoning salt. I like them better that way. They are hard to get consistently crunchy but not burnt. However, a little burnt will be covered up by the deliciousness of the non-burnt parts. So, don't worry if they're a little overcooked.

If my husband asks me to make it again,you know it is good. He vowed as an adult no one would make him eat veggies again. It is very hard to keep though.

I'm really not sure how to rate this recipe; at first taste, I absolutely loved these, but as I continued to eat them, I didn't care for them as much. I was surprised that many of my very picky siblings were eating and liking them as well! They also got tired of them quickly, though. As suggested, I sprayed the kale with oil spray. I also feel that this recipe  calls for a little too much salt; some of my chips were VERY salty. Thanks for sharing; it is certainly a very interesting idea!

These were ok but didn't cook evenly and most fell apart. They tasted good overall but not worth 5 stars in my opinion.

Wow....I was understandably skeptical but this was a great way to cook up kale!  I used parchment and sprinkled on olive oil and adobo seasoning.  I didn't measure anything I just spread the kale til the pan was covered. My husband was as amazed as I was at how yummy the result was!

These were fantastic!!!  I used Olive Oil cooking spray on my cookie sheet, put a single layer of kale leaves and lightly sprayed the top of the kale.  Baked at 340 for 9 minutes and they perfect!  Sprinkled some salt, onion & garlic powder lightly when just taken out of the oven.  This will be made ALL the time in our house!

These were delicious!  Watch closely when baking - I had a smallish batch so they only took ten minutes.  The only suggestion I have would be to salt them either before or after they're done, right out of the oven.  Mine came out too salty, so next time I'll skip salting them before baking, as I like the flavor of things salted at the end of cooking.  They're meant to be served relatively quickly, too, as others have mentioned.  Very tasty snack!

The first time i made these my son (13 months) went nuts over them and I make them ever other week now.  They are super easy and I even got my husband to eat them (he doesn't like Kale...supposedly) My mother in law tried them and went to the store that night so she could make them the next day.  Instead of getting the flat kale i get the rippled kind and it makes for a better chip.  YUMMO!!!

Yummy!  I took another reviewers suggestion and added some soy sauce.  Tossed the kale leaves with the soy, oil and a little salt. It is a great way to get your vegies!

You know, I did not like this recipe much at all. Of course this was my first time trying Kale so I opted for a recipe that seemed very "kid friendly"  I'm just thankful I only used  1/2 a bunch so I can continue to experiment with the other half.  Thanks for No Thanks on the Kale Chips.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but I wanted a low fat, low cal snacking option, and boy am I glad I gave this recipe a try, these are DELICIOUS.  It is very difficult to get the saltiness level correct.  I think next time I'll make them with no salt at all and see how they taste.  As with other reviewers, I would also say you should eat them right away, they definitely don't keep.  But don't hesitate to try this recipe, you won't regret it.  Thanks!

This is the most exciting discovery!  I love these and make them regularly now. I really want to try spraying them with a little vinegar to make them taste like salt and vinegar chips. I do reduce the oil by a little bit when making them.  My 5 and 2 year old love this stuff!!!!

Delightful and creative! I had hugh bag of kale left over from some soup so I tried this. Some pieces of mine was more crisp then than others, but even the chewier pieces had a nice roasted flavor. It had a deep fried brocoli taste.

Delicous!  Tasted like real potato chips and it a great way get in some healthy greens while feeling like you are sneaking in potato chips!  Only problem I had was some got really done and some not done enough... I think key to avoiding this is making torn pieces approx. same size and not packing them to close together! I will make this again.

These are so good.  I am slightly ashamed to say that I nibbled on them while reading and managed to somehow eat the entire batch.  *blush*  It was like eating potato chips, but with much less guilt.

Surprisingly, everyone loved this.  The kids especially! I initially had them taste it with their eyes closed so they wouldn't  be  put off by the appearance.  The only thing I did different was to use a canola oil cooking spray to mist the leaves instead of drizzling with olive oil.  The texture is much more thin and delicate than potato chips, so it requires a gentle touch.

What a great alternative to potato chips, super healthy and low fat. I have tried them two times now. 1st time seasoned them with sea salt and balsamic vinegar and a bit of pepper. 2nd time used cajun seasoning and salt. Both worked out great and I think you could use just about anything for seasoning.  Also cooked at a bit lower heat and mixed them around a couple of times to get more areas crispy.

Interesting flavour.  Be careful not to overcook.  I take them out just as the sides begin to brown.

I have been making this for years and find that I don't need to add salt at all.  I think the kale is naturally salty and adding extra can be too much.  So for those of you that find it too salty, try none and see what you think!

very tasty.  I will make again, but with a few changes.  I needed to bake mine longer, at 15 min they were still soggy in the middle.  I had to almost go to 23.  I will also use less salt.  I found them very very salty and i love salt.  I appreciate the recipe.  It a great, fun way to eat a healthy vegetable that i usually cringe when eating.

This is a very clever recipe.  I was a little skeptical at first but the end result turned out really good.  I'm trying to be healthy so I made turkey burgers last night and the kale chips were a great substitute for regular greasy potato chips.  Thank you very much for posting this recipe!

WOW!  This was unbelievably good.  Even my 2 year old loved them!  We used Pam to lighten it up a little and sprinkled a little sea salt over them.  I used all my kale making these! Thanks for a great idea!

I found the taste of these to be rather acrid without much flavor beyond the saltiness. It's entirely possible I overbaked them a bit, but they came out matching the description in the recipe, so it's hard to imagine that they'd taste much different slightly less cooked.

These tasted great (even to the kids!) but only gets a 4 star rating because they didn't keep as well as I had hoped. The next day they were still delicious, but kind of chewy. Best to enjoy right away. Also, I would not recomend taking these to an office party or similar, because everyone will be roaming around with little green bits in their teeth!

Surprisingly good.  I tried it both by mixing the kale in olive oil and also spraying with canola spray.  I think I liked the flavor when I mixed the oil in the bowl, and the coverage was better, thereby preventing burning.  Be careful not to put on too much salt.  I gave this a 4 because it was a little tedious to prepare the kale leaves, but they were indeed tasty and the kids ate them without turning up their noses (a sure sign of success!).

So-so. An interesting twist, although I felt like I was just munching on crispy, salted lettuce. Fort some reason, I was expecting more.

Very hard to back just right, either I burned it or the Kale was uncooked, I tried two batches.  I am probably doing something wrong.

Use a flavour infused oil! So yummy! Make sure to space the leaves out and use coarse thick fresh kale.

This recipe is okay. I'm not in expert in baking kale, but it needs to be cooked longer than 10-15 minutes. I kept adjusting the time, but the texture never stayed even. The outer leaves were crunchy, but the inside part just became soggy and chewy. Next time I might try to use the airfryer.

I made these and followed the recipe. Turned out great until I put them away in a container. They turned soft and lost their crispness. Not sure what happened.

I will make it again, it was great! I only baked it for 5 minutes instead of 10-15 because the edges were turning brown. I also added too much salt, so I would recommend paying attention to how much you add.

Keep the stems,  and bake them separtely, they are a bit chewy,  but delicious!
Will add the seasoning after laying them out on the partchment to avoid over salting.

I perfected this on my 3rd batch and learned to not saturate with too much olive oil. To my surprise, both my kids love this snack. 
The 1st batch had double the amount of oil, so I set aside to rest. After I finished my 3rd batch, I went back to the 1st batch, added some shredded parmesan cheese, and baked for another 5 minutes. The kale crisped and my kids gobbled these up too.

We made several batches because the kids were eating them as fast as I could take them out of the oven! I used a large bowl with a tight fitting lid to shake the kale with the oil for best distribution.   Just salt on most batches except for the trial batch with cheddar cheese popcorn seasoning. So yummy.

Best kale chips I've ever had or made.  Took a reviewer's suggestion and coated kale with olive oil and salt in a bowl; I chose garlic salt.  Then baked at 325* for 15 mins.  Addictive.

Only used about 1 tsp. olive oil and  added about 1 Tbsp. nutrition yeast flakes.  Massaged the kale a few minutes before spreading on baking sheet.

First time I made Kale chips. The recipe worked well but I used more salt than recommended making the chips too salty. I'll reduce the salt next time.

It was really good! I used MCT oil, mrs dash, and some sea salt. I burnt the first pan due to not keeping a close eye on it. I cooked mine for about 7-10 minutes depending on how full the pan was.

Oh yum! I have heard so much about kale chips but never tried them because I thought they sounded weird.  It took my best friend to convince me to try them so, I did.  I did as recipe said but added a little garlic powder and these were fantastic!  My all new go to snack!

I am a chip freak. I would eat chips every day, I couldn't get enough! I didnt think I would like kale chips at all in fact I only made them for my 10m old son, thought he might like them. I was very surprised to find out I absolutely like kale chips!

This is just about the best thing I've made in a while. Thanks for this simple, cheap, and healthy recipe. Instead of seasoned salt, I used a combination of Garlic Powder and Chili Powder. Tastes pretty darn awesome. Came out perfect. Also I put about a tablespoon of olive oil in a bowl and went hands on and literally pressed the olive over the entire surface of each piece, dipping it as one does for french toast, until each piece of kale was coated evenly, but thin, all over.

Absolutely delicious and healthy! Hard to just have a few, but unlike chips, who cares!? Also, I'm a student looking to cook meals and snacks that last the week....unfortunately the kale chips are "no bueno" after about a day. Any ideas on how to keep them crispy for longer? That's probably asking a lot. Thoughts? Thanks for the post!

I used Mrs. Dash garlic & herb salt free seasoning instead of salt, I didn’t expect them to be good, but I loved it! I usually eat a ham sandwich for lunch at work, I’ll be eating kale chips with my sandwich tomorrow

My husband loves these! It's best if you make the pieces small and lay them on the side so that there is some air between the kale and center of the piece (holds itself up - if that makes any sense). I believe using the spray olive oil works much better as to not weight it down.

These kale chips tasted great. I added more oil than the recipe called for so that every chip had some. The chips also fall apart so easily that my husband and I ate them all straight off the pan.

Loved the easy recipe, I used to rub each leaf, which took forever. I used  pink Himalayan salt added garlic powder. Made sure everything was coated  nicely laid a single layer down so they all be evenly. Delicious!

These are quite addictive to say the least.  I used a variety of different spices on mine and put it in my convection oven.  They turned out crispy and wonderful!  I am not vegetarian at all, but these are a healthy alternative to potato chips or any other chip that is loaded with preservatives, salt and so many other nasty chemicals.

I saw your finished product and that is not kale chips. You used the wrong kind of kale as not all kale is created equally. Kale chips work best and look like actual chips if you use a flatter leafed kale such as red or black kale. After cooking they are shrunk down into a flatter chip. That's when you salt them as well.

Wonderful! Just made for the second time. I sprayed it with olive oil spray and sprinkled seasonings on it.  Convection cooked at 325 two sheets of the kale for ~8 minutes.  Turned out great.

These are delicious! Sadly I ruined them, but I learned from my mistake. I put the lid on the storage container before they were completely cooled. I went back for a nibble later and found them to be soggy. I had even put a slice of bread in there to avoid that. It would have been fine if only I had let them cool first. I microwaved them in hopes of crisping them up again. That didn't work, it ruined them. My brother came in from outside and asked why the house smelled like skunk cabbage! Like I said, I learned a lesson. I'll definitely try again!

I made this recipe with a group and everyone loved it.  It was a big hit even with the skeptics who didn't want vegetables.  We found an important step was to dry off the kale before putting on the oil.  It would crisp up better in the oven.  Yummy.

Had some left over kale I wanted to use rather than toss, and this recipe makes even yellowing kale palatable. A little salty but tastes good.

I never tried kale chips so I didn’t expect them to be so light and brittle. I didn’t think I liked them until I realized I couldn’t stop snacking. Weirdly addicting and definitely can take the place of potato chips when you’re craving something a bit oily, salty and crunchy!

I used garlic salt. After I washed and dried the kale, I placed it in a large bowl and drizzled olive oil over it. Then I sprinkled on the garlic salt and used my hand to mix it all, taking care to coat all the pieces. My mistake was trying to fit too many chips on the baking pan. I'm not a fan of kale. I find it very (unpleasantly) strong. But I know it's good for me, and this recipe gives me an option I can enjoy. I will make this again and experiment with other flavors...

Super tasty and crispy! I agree with other reviews that you really have to watch them right at the end. A fine line between when just right and over done. I added my salt after cooking but put on salt-free seasoning (Pensey's spice mix called Forward) during the cooking time. Delish!!!

Excellent dnack. After reading numerous reviews, I took the following path. 
Spread olive oil on the inside of a bowl.
Lightly urubbed both sides of leaves indide the bowl.
Placed leaves on a rack above the pan. 
Sprinkled sea salt on leaves.
Baked at 350 deg. on convection for 8-minutes.

Baking on rack on convection made an even, great crisp. Olive oil reduces bitterness. Go easy on the salt as others mentioned. Small bitesize pieces are best. Too large to fit in your mouth makes a mess.

Kale is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth. That being said, they were indeed crispy.

The stated temperature for this recipe is much too high. They burn! I reduced the temp to 125C and they turned out much better.

I thought these were somewhat difficult to make. I don’t have a salad spinner so I tried drying one batch with paper towels and the other batch I let air dry. Both turned out still soggy though the air dried batch was better. I also made these to have for the week but you should probably eat them all not long after making them (cause they will be soggy). They weren’t bitter which was great because kale can be super bitter I think. It’s definitely not a substitute for chips (I love chips!) but they are healthier! This was also my first time trying to do this so I’m sure more experienced people’s have turned out fine.

Got a very large bag of rainbow kale from our local help center/food bank. These came out very well and the picky kids actually liked them. Following the recipe we learned that it is really, really important to remove the leaves completely from the stems. This is what makes this recipe work. The ones that weren't as crispy got put back into the oven. We'll make these again.

Excellent!
I've sprayed kale with cooking spray, add some salt and pepper and after 12.5 minutes we got amazing crunchy kale chips!
Finished them in 2 min! Great alternative to expensive kale chips from the store.
Thank you!

I love having this option when I have an excess amount of kale from the garden to use. I love the salty crunch, and it's quick and easy to make.

Excellent! I piled 1/4 of a large bunch of oil-salt coated, curly kale onto a small cookie sheet, lined with parchment, in the toaster oven at 350 for just under 15 minutes for a perfectly cooked-batch of  delectably crispy, air-light kale chips. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Made as stated, but added sesame seeds. I think it’s going to take a few tries before I get this just right. Some chips were crisp and some chewy. Also, I put too much salt. Next time, I think garlic salt will be really tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

It was my first time making kale chips! I found this recipe and it came out great! I used very little olive oil, but I think next time I would use even less. Also I added garlic powder for a little extra goodness and it was delicious! I will definitely make it again!

My youngest can't get enough of these. I use plain sea salt instead of seasoned. She dislikes the flavor of most store bought kale chips, but gorges on these. I like to make a bunch & store them in a vacuum container to keep them crispy.

Delicious and addictive! Best batches were made with curly kale baked on my non stick cooling racks set on a cookie sheet. They stayed rippled and did not flatten out like those just baked on cookie sheet. I lightly sprayed with olive oil and lightly sprinkled with seasoning salt. Be prepared to eat the first tray that comes out of oven! They go quick! Thank you for posting!

Loved these!  I didn’t use a whole head of kale, so I cut down the olive oil to 1.5 tsp and used garlic salt, since it’s my favorite, cooking for 10 minutes.  They were excellent!

This turned out great, tasting kinda like the salty crispy seaweed you get from the Chinese. I had some right away and they were amazing and put the rest in a sealed bag for later, but  they stunk out the cupboard and got soggy. I would make again knowing that you have to eat right away.

They were WONDERFUL!! I used a little paprika, garlic powder and salt to season them and they were tasty. If you have a “quick bake” convection setting, use that! Perfect!

Super easy recipe.  Used Lawry's seasoning on half the batch and garlic powder and cayenne pepper on other half for more spice.  Delicious. Try to avoid over sprinkling seasoning. Have made 3 times this week!!!

Excellent recipe!! I have made these a few times and this past time was my best attempt. The key is to have the kale very dry, not having a salad spinner this was my downfall in the past leaving to much water on the kale causing it to burn. I took a paper towel and dried off the kale then massage in the oil. I used a seasoning salt recipe found on this site (copycat Lowry seasoning salt).  I brought these to my sister n laws for a celebration and every one loved them! Definitely will be making these again!!

These are addicting!  I prefer all of the chips to be crisp throughout which can be tricky.  After I bake several batches I turn off the oven and crack the door slightly to let it a cool a bit.  Then I pile all  of the chips back onto a pan a put in the oven to finish crisping  without worrying that they’ll burn.

perfect!  never thought I'd like these. I had a taste for something crunchy & salty & whipped these up instead of buying potato chips. I used olive oil drizzle & dry ranch powder. knocked my socks off. crazy how good they taste cooked & crisp versus raw....that's why I never thought I'd like them but the flavor & texture was amazing. I  can't post a pic because I ate them all while writing this review :) give em a try!!

My husband and I were eager to try this recipe since we are trying to incorporate more kale into our diet. Instead of oil I sprayed coconut oil spray on the kale after I sat it out on a cookie sheet. Then, I sprinkled the kale with Lowry’s seasoned salt. Put in the oven for twelve minutes. Awesome! Most of my kale chips were a little brown, but we decided we preferred them that way. My seven year old daughter said they tasted very good. That’s a score!

I luv this recipe and have made several times.  I used cayenne pepper for a little kick or  lightly sprinkled Ranch Dressing, which was a big hit with the boys

Well, I was GOING to take a photo of the finished product, but I tried one and next thing I knew, they had all disappeared... This recipe must be magic or something. Hahaha

But seriously, this was the first time I've ever done anything with Kale, so I was kind of flying by the seat of my pants. They turned out SO good! I'm actually mad at myself for not trying these sooner. 

-I found that it didn't really make much difference if the leaves were still wet, or not. Since I am 25, single, and still learning how to "adult", I don't own a salad spinner, so I just took the chance and they were fine.

When making this the first time I noticed that it was a lot of salt going into this snack. The first match came out too salty but for the next batch I added half the salt and it came out scrumptious.

I have found using garlic salt to the recipe adds amazing taste( not that it needs a new flavor) and as well I take the time to later every nook and cranny with oil so it looks better over all! I actually got my husband to eat veggies!

I love this recipe! It is so easy to make and it is so healthy! My 14 year old son even likes it. We make it together and snack on it while watching tv. This is a favorite at our house! I have tried different spices and found that the sea salt is the best by far. Chili powder works well too. Happy munching!

I would ditch the salt. I added an all purpose season with garlic and onion and drizzled with lemon juice. The result was a crispy, savory  chip with exciting flavor.

Yummy, but does anyone know the calories in a batch? We tend to eat them because it's kale and a superfood but it's easy to forget the oil and salt!!

these turned out great! i don't have a salat spinner so i rinsed the leaves in a collander and covered it with a dishtowel before shaking dry. then added the olive oil while they were still in the collander and mixed it all with my hands and ahook off excess oil. i turned the heat down a little bit on the oven and put it on fan, and i also put the baking sheet on a wire rack instead of a tray so the heat would distribute evenly.  first time trying kale chips and they turned out perfect!

I just made these but instead of a parchment-lined cookie sheet, I sprayed a vented pizza pan with Pam and used that. I figured it would allow the bottoms to get cooked more evenly. I sprayed them with a light layer of Pam and then sprinkled with Cavenders Greek Seasoning. I baked them at 340 for about 6.5-7 minutes. They turned out delicious! I love these and will continue making them over and over again!

First time having kale chips. Had way too much kale in the fridge that was going to waste, so I thought I'd try this. I over seasoned it with salt, expecting the kale to taste bitter and bad, but I was really surprised at how crunchy they were, I never expected vegetables could get that crisp. Tasty, and I'll probably make again!

Timing is so critical. I turned the temp to 325 even though our oven heats accurately. This helped me. I used spray coconut oil and no salt seasoning. I am going to try the spray butter flavored.

Five starts are not enough! Love how it's versatile because this is a basic start up I used Costco Himalayan pink salt and garlic /dried onion (but very light) and if you use olive oil make sure it's fresh however I used organic 100% avocado spray the taste was so much more in flavor and no after taste I always and maybe this is a given but I used organic kale so no pesticides and washed already so all I did was a light wash and pat dry cut down on prepping..like I said this was AMAZING! so simple yummie healthy vegan eat all the time picky eaters...thnx for sharing Lucy del Rey:)

As others have mentioned, I used cooking spray on the kale. That worked really well, all my kale was crunchy and not soggy. I baked @ 350 for just five minutes and it came out just right!

The baking time varies due to the kale, the humidity, the alignment of the stars, whatever. I wash mine, blot really dry with paper towels. I drizzle the olive oil but massage it in so that every tiny bit of the kale has oil. Makes a difference! At 10 min I check it, some pieces will be done, but some won't be. So I stir it all around, pick out the crunchy ones and go for another 10 min. After 20 min the kale is usually crunchy but sometimes I have to repeat, stir around, take out the crunchy ones. Some batches have taken up to 30 min. This is something you have to watch but it's worth it! My 6 year old grand daughter loves kale chips. After they are done we devour them! They don't keep real well, so eat them up! Thanks for the recipe!

Great, simple, and best of all healthy! I used the suggestion from another comment to place the kale in a ziplock to coat with the olive oil. Definitely liked how that worked over trying to evenly drizzle over. Thanks for posting! Will make again!

I'm not a kale person. I used to work in a fast food restaurant as a teen and we used kale to cover the ice on the salad bar, the stuff stayed green and fresh looking for weeks, it was never something I ever considered eating. Then it hit all the trendy hippy places and everyone was eating kale, it only made me more resistant to eating it. But I like to try new things and all I needed was kale, salt and oil, only one of which I don't normally have in my kitchen. I've made this a few times and it is awesome. My husband likes it too. I'm still trying to find the perfect temp and time for my oven because I'm not convinced the thing is accurate, but even the mistakes are delicious,

Personally I loved it. The hubster is a committed anti-vegetable guy. He tried one and was not a fan.He won't eat commercial kale chips either, so it's him, not the recipe. I tried this with PAM cooking spray--it was pretty successful that way, though olive oil is the best.

I grow Kale in my garden. My toddlers loved these kale chips. None left for mom and dad. They took less time in the over for me on a lower oven rack (less than 10 minutes) so watch them. Thanks!

I've made these several times. I sprinkle nutritional yeast instead of salt. Kids love it. I also find it easier to rub the olive oil on first, then de-vain it. Turn it over about 1/2 way and take it out when the kale looks dry or feels dry to the touch. Can take one out to sample. If not crispy enough, add more time to the rest. I store in a glass container with one of those anti-humidity packets that I get out of my seaweed packets. Storing in zip lock bags makes it go soggy within a day.

They were very good! I used this recipe but used garlic salt as I didn't have seasoned salt(whaaat?). I also put them in for 10 min, will time for around 7 min next time. Probably just my oven. Thank you for the recipe! I'm glad I can make my mother and I  kale chips now!

Absolutely loved it but I would strongly suggest you turn down the heat to 275 in the oven. You have to watch it carefully or it will burn before you can blink. Otherwise It's absolutely perfect

Oven environments vary, which could make this challenging. I sprinkled powered ranch on mine prior to baking. They turned out great. Do not store in a snack bag or they moisten and soften up again.

They turned out great. Agree with the comments that you really have to watch. One batch I had too close to the bottom of the oven and even though it was in the same oven with a batch on a higher rack, it clearly tasted more burnt than crispy.  Trial and error. Used the last of my winter kale which was nice and sturdy for these "chips". Great healthy snack!

I used olive oil spray and season salt.  Stirred them about half way through for more even baking. Easy and delicious.  Will definitely make again.

I made this and used the lacinado kale variety and cooking spray instead of pouring on the olive oil ... watch how much salt you add - the spray covers the kale very well and holds the salt. A quick and fast snack!!

Really surprised about this one...I made it for my aunt who is on a strict diet because of diabetes.  I sprayed the pieces with pam, topped with sea salt and baked for 10 mins, rotating half way as suggested.  They came out crispy and holy cow, they taste like potato chips.  This is a keeper.

Made the mistake of placing kale in a big bowl and adding too much olive oil and too much salt, but I could tell from the end result that they would have been great if I'd followed the recipe more closely. I used the convection roast feature on my oven, and the chips baked at 350 for about 8 minutes. Great way to use up kale!

I've made these kale chips few times now. The whole family likes them. I wash, spin dry and leave on paper towels on the kitchen counter for couple of hours before baking. And BTW, no baking sheet, is going to be big enough to hold a whole bunch of kale, in a single layer ! That's why, I use about 2 well packed cups of kale leaves, spray with Pam and eyeball the seasoning. You need to watch these closely, after the 1st 10 minutes. They can go quickly from brown edges to burned.

Great recipe. As others have stated, there is a fine line between chewey and burnt, and that's right where you want to be. I recommend portioning this out into a few batches for the oven the first time you prepare it so you can establish a good cooking time without losing too much kale.

I followed the directions except I left it in a little too long.  I also wasn't sure how how the "drizzle" thing would work with the olive oil so I put it in a Ziploc bag and shook it up.   I really loved it...even the pieces that were slightly scorched.

I really wasn't expecting much from this recipe, but it turned out so good! I like adding kale to my smoothies but wanted to find another way to eat kale since it's so good for you. I followed the directions but also added a little pepper to them too. They were so tasty I ate a whole bunch in one sitting. One thing to mention: they do shrink considerably after they've been cooking so I'd suggest adding more than less. Will definitely make this again!

Tips:  Line a gigantic lasagne pan or a 1/2 sheet pan with heavy duty foil.  Spread some oil on with a pastry brush.
Prepare the leaves: Get a huge bowl, put the kale in the bowl, pour some of the oil and sprinkle part of the seasoning mix you will use over the kale, then toss with salad tongs or a wooden salad spoon/fork set.  After tossing, add a bit more oil and the rest of the seasonings, toss again, then spread into the pan.
I like to use a 275 degree over and mix the leaves after 15 minutes then let them roast for another 10 - 20 minutes after that.  Yum!

I've made this recipe many times and appreciate how nutritious it is in comparison to other snacks.  My biggest success was the last time when I took another commenters tip to start the chips curly side down, which I did for 10 minutes, then turned them right side up for another 3-5 until they were nicely browned and crispy.  I mixed garlic powder, salt, pepper and lime juice into 1 tsp olive oil, then folded into kale pcs  until evenly coated, as recipe recommends.  Finally, no soggy chips at all, and so delicious. Yumm!

I love this recipe as it is simple in theory. It is really important to watch them once they are in the oven because they can burn easily. I don't know if my oven temperature is accurate or not but I found 350 degrees too hot. I lowered the temperature to 300 and baked for 10 minutes, checking every 4 minutes or so and rotating the pan. The first time I used this recipe, I used way too much oil. This time, I used a brush in a dabbing fashion to lightly cover the leaves. For 3 trays, I used about a tablespoon in total. I used Himalayan sea salt which adds a nice flavor. I have found that the older the leaves, the more sensitive they are to burning.  This really is a healthy option for snacking.

Don't know if anyone else suggested just turning off the oven when the chips are done and
leave them in there, door closed, for about 30 minutes to really dehydrate them and bring out their crispness. This technique works well when roasting pecans, walnuts ,  and raw peanuts , too.

One way to get chips that are consistently crispy is to follow the recipe as posted, then remove the chips from the oven. Allow the oven to cool down to 200'F. Return the chips to the oven for 30 minutes.

We have also  used the recipe but substituted the leaves of the Brussel's sprout plant ("Brussel's greens") and they come out just as well as with kale.

I never met a kale chip that I liked until I made this.  It took two attempts to get it right - I made 2 changes. Set the oven at 330 and cooked for a total of 15 minutes (with a good shake of the cookie sheet every 5 minutes), and I also put the olive oil in a bowl and tossed the dried kale in the oil before I put it on the cookie sheet. 

Less is more with the salt since the leaves shrink up quite a bit.

I tried these for the first time at a friend's birthday potluck party. I asked what was in a bowl, next to the potato chips, and then shook my head in rejection when she told me. She said to try one > they grow on ya! So i did... a small piece...and then another to make sure I got a legitament taste... and then smiled, as I scooped more on my plate! 
  I have never liked kale, nor have I ever bought it....until yesterday. I Googled this recipe and read several reviews for all the tips.(I don't like Oops when I want something Now!)??
  This turned out PERFECTLY the first time, thanks to you all for your tips!  I'm eating them right now. Warm and lightly crisp!
  I air dried on paper towels last nite and fell asleep.... kale was fine (it never made it to fridge...so there was no temp change to wilt the leaves) Whew! 
  I removed leaves from stems and tossed them onto my baking sheet. I'm not physically careful with foods, like most cooks.... so, with my fingers, I tossed and fluffed the leaves while i drizzled with (odorless, unflavored) organic coconut oil. I forgot about the parchment paper til after the oil....so I just lifted leaves and Slid the paper under them.(Once again) I placed kale upside down, without overlapping. I decided to season with garlic salt and a mild Fiesta blend I make and keep on hand. I baked at 300° for 5mins, then turned off oven. I personally shuffled leaves with a flipping action within the pan ,and returned back to the oven for 3more mins.

I doubled the batch and made as directed. We love them fresh from the oven. However, I was amazed how good they were after sitting at room temperature. Crunchy, tasty and health, I ate all the leftovers.

Make sure the kale is really dry so it gets crispy.  I tossed the kale in the olive oil and laid it on the baking sheet before sprinkling with sea salt. There's a fine line between burnt and crispy.  Make sure to watch your kale!  I tossed it about 10 minutes into cooking to make sure it didn't burn.  My 2 year old LOVES this recipe.

So good!  You can also make it in the microwave which I find much faster, easier and cooks even better.  3 min on high, then stir around, and another 3 min on high in my microwave gets it evenly crispy.  Results differ depending on the microwave so test out a little to see what amount of cooking time works best.  Also a big bonus not to have to put the summer on on hot days.

I just harvested some kale from my garden and was online looking for ways to store it. I found this recipe and thought, why not.  I have gone through two batches in one hour.  Oops.  :-D. 
I don't think I have enough kale to keep me in chips.  So what did I do?  Well, I soaked them in cold water, dried them real well, then with my fingers, brushed olive oil on the front and back.  I laid them curly side down, because of some ones suggestion,  and sprinkled a little garlic powder, basil, and kosher salt, then topped it with a little lime juice.  Baked at 350 for 10 minutes, no more, they will burn.  Then carefully remove from pan as they will break apart.  AWESOME.

We made this with the Kale from our CSA that I didn't have time to cook or freeze.  We were pleased with the results.  I made with Sea Salt because I didn't have Seasoning salt.  It was really good.  The chips lasted a few days in a plastic container.  I will make this again and may play with seasoned olive oil and different salts.

Super easy and delicious. I made salt & pepper, garlic salt, and a tray of seasoned salt. Warning - easy on the salt. I pretty much WAY over salted but they were still good. Also go easy on the olive oil. I think I overdid that a bit too.

Good! 

1. Kale nutrients are lost through longer cooking. Better to cook at the higher temp for a short time for most nutrition. 

2. I tried with and without oil,  and couldn't tell the difference, so I prefer to skip the oil. 

3. My favorite topping is a very light spritz of Braggs liquid aminos and garam Masala.

I made it with kale grown in flower boxes on our deck. It was pretty easy to hold the folded kale leaf and gently pull off the stem along the middle of the leaf. The folded leaves stood up on the pan and that made them cook up nice and crisp.

I traded the seasoned salt oit and instead sprinkled them with lemon zest, pink salt, and granulated garlic before baking. Real food snacks you don't have to feel guilty about. These are so addictive!

I've made these numerous times now, and just realized that I never reviewed it! We love these! They just melt in your mouth, and are such a great alternative to store bought snacks.

Kale chips can be very easy to make and good for you. To get them dry, spin in a salad spinner.  I sprayed Coconut Oil organic on one side and then sprinkled with Garlic Bread sprinkle. I baked mine for 10 min, 300 degrees, then rotated the pan for another 11 minutes.  Yummy and super easy with spray oil.

I put just a little salt and about a teaspoon of sugar. I can accidentally eat a whole bag of kale like this.

I read in one of my health magazines that kale is rich in Vitamin A which is great for your skin and keeping a youthful look ;). With this in mind I bought a bag of precut kale and decided to try this baked kale chips recipe.  Delicious and lightly crunchy!  I was careful to watch it in the oven.  I rotated the baking pan and also mixed the kale halfway through cooking time so it would evenly bake.  So simple and a yummy nutritious snack!  I gave my boys (ages 8 and 11) a plate of it.  Wasn't sure if they'd like it as they've never had kale.  I came back to check the plate and it was all gone ;).  I'll definitely make this recipe again :)

I was very pleased with this recipe as one of my go to snacks is kale chips.  I have used this recipe twice and  now this is my go to recipe.  You can always change the amount of salt/seasoning you put on top, remember you can always add but you can't take off.  I tend to use a little more olive oil then the recipe calls for because I find that it is not enough.  I like how simple this recipe is.

I made  no changes  to the recipe and will absolutely make them again! I will use my oil mister next time because it not allow any of the pieces to get a little soggy. These are yummy! I wonder how many calories are in them?

I made these for people to munch on while I finished cooking dinner @ thanksgiving. They disappeared in no time! Everyone loved them, and they weren't sure what they were until after they ate them. I used an olive oil spray for more even coating. Thank you for the great recipe! I've made them a few more times since then. A great way to get greens into the grandkids ??

Watch them carefully so they won't burn. I left the first batch in just a couple minutes too long and some pieces turned brown. My second pan was much better. It might be a good idea to rotate the pan half way through baking. I don't like fresh kale very much but these chips are much tastier.

The only changes I made to the recipe were accidental. We put a bit to much oil and salt. We also put spinach in ours as well. Our nutrition team made them for our school science night. They were super easy and quick to make. Overall I loved the final product, very tasty and healthy!

Delicious!  We found that using one kale leaf per person makes an appropriate amount.  I also dry each leaf by hand since I don't own a salad spinner.

I just don't care for Kale prepared this way. I only used 1 teaspoon of oil and they were perfectly crisp.   I just don't care for the green slightly bitter taste of them.

Love kale chips, but drizzling them with oil makes them cook very unevenly.  Put the kale pieces into a bowl with a little oil and mix together.  Spread them on to a cookie sheet and watch them cook perfectly! Add seasoned salt, spices, or a little grated cheese on top to add some extra flavor

Trying to make healthier choices. Recipe was easy to make. An acquired taste but not that bad at all. Will make again. I made half with just salt and the other half with salt and parmesan cheese.

Honestly, the taste of kale reminds me of brussel sprouts ( though maybe not as strong tasting) i went a little too heavy on the season salt but otherwise these were pretty good :) i baked about 12 min. but watched them carefully and they turned out fine :)

Great the way they are, but I added a little cayenne pepper to the other batch and the kids liked it both ways.

Not a 'healthy' eating family but trying to be. Took everyone's comments into consideration like placing in  A zip lock and shaking in the oil and using different flavors. Well I think we can say success! Teen is eating them faster than they are coming out of oven.

Mine turned out good. A bit too salty, so, next batch i'll try powdered seasoning instead, but they were so light and crispy, Very delish!

Sooo good. I used coconut oil Pam and sprinkled them with Sour Cream and Onion popcorn seasoning! Next time it'll be Dill Pickle!

After reading all the comments, I hovered by the oven. No regrets.

I pondered the cooking time suggestions and realized that it may be a similar situation to some baking tips due to elevation. We are at 3500 feet so my cooking itme was exactly 10 minutes.  I usually use my children as an indication as to whether a recipe is a rave hit. My children ASK me to make these which for a vegetable a healthy snack is sometimes unheard of. Thank you for a very healthy and tasty snack idea.

I turned the temperature down to 275 about 5 minutes before and then left them at 200 degrees for another 15 so they will be totally crisp. I sprinkled aged Parmesan cheese instead of Salt and sprinkled Chia Seeds for Fiber. Also I used Lemon infused Olive Oil. YUM. Love these.

Found the "chips" cooked very inconsistent ending with some soggy and others perfectly crisp. I like that crunchy effect that reminds me of dried seaweed which quickly softens as you chew. However the salt was overwhelming all the kale flavor. I saw the reviews about using a dehydrator and would love to know if it worked. I can always slash the amount of salt and try sesame oil.

ok, I did a cook test and after 5 minutes I cook 2 min's at a time till I get them crunchy. Some might get a bit  dark on the outside. I also shook the sheet a couple of times.

I used the olive oil Pam and they came out amazing. I set the oven at 325 and watched them closely after 12 minutes. Thank you so much for this. Chips are my weakness and this just made my bad eating habits so much healthier!

Massage the kale with the oil, that way you won't have as much burning on the ones that don't get oil when you just drizzle! 
I also used a lime infused oil, definitely delicious

It's still kale...but I feel healthier lol! A friend suggested that after using the salad spinner to let the kale air dry, which I did overnight, and it made all the difference in the world! They are light and crisp :)

It's not bad at all but I prefer potato chips.  I used an Olive Oil spray to keep it light and it was more like 7 minutes so keep any eye on them after five minutes.

My family LOVES these kale chips - I wish I had a video of my kids faces waiting in anticipation for the kale chips to finish for lunch today...=)  I think I've finally learned the perfect way to make these for me.  I put the kale in a large bowl and stir the oil in to coat the kale evenly.  Then, I place them on a cookie sheet in a SINGLE layer, sprinkle them lightly with seasoned salt - so it's not TOO salty, and then bake for 8 minutes.  The single layer thing does add time, but it pretty much eliminates the chewy/burnt issue.  Evenly cooked.  Evenly delicious.  Awesome.

Really good! The cooking time worked perfectly for crispy chips. The only problem was I found 1 tsp of salt to be way too salty. I'd recommend 1/2 tsp (taste it while it's raw before putting in the oven, and adjust if you want it saltier)

My second batch I mixed in some paprika, and it was nice too

MAGNIFICENT, SUBLIME.."(Gulp).. I must saith therewith this recipe which is ever-so much more with the molecular compounds thereof energy within the Kale itself yet WITH the way it is described therein making it superb delicate dish.. Moreover a tasteful snack devoured therefrom the all outward nutritional value therewith this tantalizing treat.. Ergo I applaud this scrumptious smashing simplistic recipe! Thank you!"

If you lower the oven to 250 and switch racks 10 minutes in, and let bake another 10 to 15 minutes, and let cool at least 3 minutes before removing from sheet, they turn out much better.  I also sprinkled with granulated onion and garlic powders to the salt after oiled and I sprayed a squirt of truffle oil in with the oil (used avocado) ( was 5 bucks at Sprouts).  My son wanted more and I cant get him to eat anything green at all.  He said they tasted like french fries.

Thanks for the new way to get my kale in. My not veggie eating hubby said he would try one and he went back for more!

Love these, but so time consuming.  You take all the time to make the chips from one bunch of Kale, then eat them all in one sitting!

I've made this. My daughter who is learning to expand her tastes - aka picky eater - loved it.  I've made it with olive oil, Asian peanut oil but best has been butter spray. Its so much crispier. We also added accent and salt. She loves it gets some real green in and I'm happy.

PAM instead of olive oil and season salt (lots). Baked 350 for 11 minutes and they were perfect.

I found a way to make the chips crispier totally by mistake! After my kale chips had baked for 15 mins, I took a look. The kale leaves were a little soggy so i was resolved to try another batch. 
I turned off the oven but left the chips in the oven while i went to run an 30 min errand. When i came back I realized I had forgotten the chips in the oven! I opened the door and they were crisp like potato chips! I'm addicted!

I can eat a whole pan myself... don't go too crazy with the salt... and you have to watch it as it can go from crispy to burnt very quickly... A great healthy treat!

I used precut kale from Publix.  Worked great and really saved time.  My husband and I loved the light delicate and healthy chips and rated it a 5.  However, we had some guests who often like healthier options and basically they ignored this option.  Except for what we snacked on, no one seemed to touch it.  We were so disappointed no one would even try it, but went for the heavier options we had.  I still make this for us.

I used cleaned kale in a bag from the supermarket, and olive oil Pam spray. Seasoned with sea salt and a little onion powder. I ate the whole tray myself and need to make more for the fam to try! AMAZING.

I tried this recipe after one of my friends had me try hers. It was very difficult to evenly spread the salt and pieces came out with chunks of salt on it. I would say 1/2 tsp would work for the salt. I never add any salt to any of my foods so if you are like me, don't add much salt to this as well!

Great alternative way to prepare kale.  I love it, but it does not remind me much of potato chips, beyond the salty flavor.  The texture is more crisp and verges on crumbly, in a melting in your mouth kind of way.  I used a very large bunch of Russian kale from my garden, which has just a bit thinner leaf than the lacinto or dinosaur kale that I often see at the store, so this may well influence the texture The thicker leaved varieties may result in chips with more heft.  I was concerned that the T of olive oil wouldn't be enough, but it was plenty, and I just lightly salted with garlic salt and a dash of Trader Joe's everyday seasoning - I think any such seasoning mix would be nice.  I really think it would be easy to eat way too much kale in this format!

So, I love it, it would be great with a meal or as a snack, but, I don't think most people will feel like this is a one for one substitute for those starchy potato chips!  (sweet potato or other root veg chips seem more similar to me)

I've never made kale chips before but I have so much kale in my garden I thought why not?  They turned out great.  I cooked them a bit to long(10 minutes) so they were a tad burnt.  I will reduce the cooking time to 8 or 9 minutes next time.  From one Lucy to another Thanks!

The cook time was spot-on for me! To make things easier I used a cooking spray instead of olive oil to coat the kale. I experimented with using seasoned salt and other spices and they turned out very good!

I'm not a fan of kale but this is a way for me to eat it. I added way too much salt as I didn't think the teaspoon would be enough (free pour to be honest) but I still enjoy it. I cooked mine in an electric oven at 350º for 14 mins (two sheet pans, with a rotation and level change at the 7 min mark). Some got a bit brown, the others stayed nice and green. It's a good flavor and I can see how I can build upon this. I used two different kinds of kale since that's what I had and both turned out extremely well.

My first attempt at kale chips. Super easy, and my carnivorous husband is sitting here eating them with me! Great way to roast. Already thinking of what variety I can add to my next batch! even though they are delicious as written. Thanks Lucy!

We love these. I have to cook for about 20 min but I do a large batch. Sometimes at the end I turn up to 375 for 1-2 min if they're not crisping up- but that might just be the large batch or my oven. Absolutely delicious and addictive.

Finally another way to enjoy kale. I love it in green smoothies, but in can't stand it raw. I sprayed mine with olive oil. I added fresh thyme, parsley flakes, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic and onion powder, and a touch of sea salt. They were delicious. Does anyone know if cooking kale this way lowers the nutritional value?

I made this twice today. I bought a bag of prewashed/chopped Kale. The first time I was a little heavy handed with the oil and season salt. I cooked them for 10 minutes. The second time for 12 and they were so good. I like kale salad but making these crunchy kale chips was great treat. I will be making these again.

These were AMAZING and i will defiantly be making them again but the reason i only gave it a 4 is because i found they were a little over cooked for my liking and a bit to crispy. I only cooked them for 10 mins but net time i will be shorten that time. I also used hemp oil instead of olive oil with coked out perfectly!

I LOVE kale and these were okay but I think I'm going to stick with more traditional kale recipes. They had an interesting texture but left a lingering taste (not sure how else to describe it)

Mine turned out much too salty(and I like salty), not sure if it is just a personal taste thing or if my bunch of kale was too small, it made enough to fill a large cookie sheet so I think the bunch should have been big enough. I will definitely make it again but with maybe 1/3-1/2 tsp salt.

I have often made kale chips and just was looking to refresh my memory on the oven temp... made the chips using  red russian kale from my garden.  What a disappointment... In the past I have always used lacticino or dinosaur kale - which produces great results - really crispy, easy not to burn but my flatter russian kale didn't crisp up and didn't have the flavor as a chip even though it is great in salads.  So in the future it is back to Wegmans for the really crinkly kind of kale!

I sprinkled the kale with juice from 1/2 a lemon, seasoned with garlic salt, used about 2 tsp olive oil, mixed it all together in a bowl, then laid it out on a cookie sheet.  I cooked it at 300 for 20 minutes (Instructions from another website) which was too long.  The ones that weren't burnt were very good! Next time I'll cook it for just 10 minutes. :)

if i would have followed the recipe as it is written, without reading the input of reviewers, it would have failed. i was able to achieve a light, thin and crispy chip consistency. on separate trays, i tried old bay, salt, and just black pepper as seasonings. i learned that no matter what seasoning you use, you can't cover up the flavor of cooked cabbage. if you don't enjoy the flavor and aroma of cooked cabbage, you probably won't enjoy these not very potato-like chips.

Oh sooooo good.  I've never had kale before & someone had given us a plant for our garden. Didn't know what to do with it except use in a salad, but hadn't even done that yet. I doubt now I'll even go that route because these are so quick & easy.  We'll be planting kale next year for sure. I already told several others about these & we just tried them yesterday.

I made these using organic curly leaf kale from my garden. Baked them at 325 degrees for 10 minutes and they were perfect! I made 3 different flavors: Chipotle, Lawry's seasoned salt, and garlic salt + vinegar. The ones with vinegar didn't all crisp up because of the added moisture but they were all amazingly delish!

I am pleasantly surprised by these. I am not a big fan of leafy greens and am always looking to sneak some in my diet. I made these and they were rather tasty. I did not have parchment, which really helps prevent burning. Some of the smaller pieces were over done. You also should remove them from the heated pan ASAP so as they do not cook further. The MISTO sprayer is Awesome! Think I will make these again! TY : )

I really wanted to like these, but they were very bitter. The texture was okay, although some were a bit crispier than others. The key is to really watch them so they are not overcooked.

I used salt and vinegar powdered seasoning the I bought at Buffalo Wild Wings. I baked at 350 for 7 minutes, and as others recommended, I kept a very close eye starting at 5 minutes. They were really good, we ate them all the minute they came out of the oven. But, here's my issue with them... My husband and I both burped kale for the rest of the night. We said it was going to be a long while before we make them again. But they were good going down so still giving them 4 stars.

This recipe helped me fix problems with my other attempts. Previously my chips would crumble but baking them on wax paper for 10 minutes (turned 180 degrees at the 5 min mark) helped.

I took the advice in another review and reduced the temp to 200.  The bake time was around an hour, but that's not critical - just check it and if they're not done, reset the timer. Beyond that, I took a tip from the original recipe poster's review and used Pam spray.  That was great - just spray, sprinkle with the spice mix and bake.  On the spice, I didn't use one with salt but whatever you use, use a "light hand" to sprinkle.  The volume of the Kale will be reduced by something like 90%.   That means the spice (being spread over that much smaller volume) will be concentrated many times.  My kale was curly - it also said it was "triple washed," so I skipped the wash step on the second batch. This was my first experience with kale.  The 'chips' did have a broccoli aftertaste, but it wasn't extreme.  I readily agree that I'm no expert, but I'd think that's a function of the kale.

This is a very easy recipe.  Mine came out perfect, not burnt, at 15 minutes.  I ate a ton of them and now I don't think I ever want to see another kale chip again....at least not for awhile.  My hubby did not care for them at all, but that's just him.  I will say don't use alot of oil, don't let them burn, eat warm, they aren't as good when they sit, and don't overdo it like I did.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a spur of the moment choice. A guest brought over precut kale pieces. And as you can see everyone loved them. Added fresh grated Ramona cheese.

I was a little skeptical of all of the positive reviews, but these were really good! I followed the recipe and read the hints in the reviews. My husband and I were both impressed. They turned out really well, although I think I could have used a little less salt. Will definitely make them again. Great alternative to chips!

We made several different batches.  The first with just Sea salt, second with garlic salt and the third with with ground chipotle and sea salt.  All where hits with the whole family.  A good late night alternative when you have the crunchy salty craving.

Just made these for the first time, I used a bit too much oil and salt, but regardless it was very tasty.  A simple yet tasty treat, will definitely make up a big batch to have to snack on.

It  tasted like broccoli. I managed to get them to the right level of crispness but I didn't really like the flavour but then again I hadn't tried kale at all before so I didn't know what to expect. The texture meant it was more enjoyable than broccoli - which I hate - but I doubt I'll make it again.

I'm going to need to buy MORE kale.  These were delicious.  Even my kids loved them.  Used ingredients as listed, but did change the process as I don't have a salad spinner.  Prepared kale, dried with a dish towel.  Placed kale leaves in a single layer on cookie sheet.  Then misted with olive oil and sprinkled with Lawry's Season Salt.  Next time I will cut back on the salt, just a touch.  Thank you for posting this!!

I did 10 minutes at 300 degrees on a rack, which worked well. I tried 3 different spices: sea salt, onion powder, Spike. You really have to go light on the spices as it can be overwhelming.

These were awesome.  I baked for 8 minutes on an insulated cookie sheet with no parchment paper.  I used 1 teaspoon of olive oil and lemon pepper seasoning on one batch and sesame oil and 5 spice powder on the other batch.

This is a good recipe for kale chips, but I changed some things.  I sprinkled seasoning salt instead of using  the entire amount. I also added harissa paste (ethnic hot sauce), fresh ground pepper, garlic flakes and sunflower oil because olive oil turns into "bad fat" at hot temperatures.  I'll definitely make these again using my modifications, of course!

This is the best kale chip recipe of the three we have tried.  I found it helpful to space the leaves so none overlapped on the baking tray - this made the cooking more even but did result in the total time being longer than advertised.  If I pulled a tray out and some were not crispy yet, I put the tray back for a minute or two (and lather rinse repeat) until all were crispy.  We didn't have any trouble with burnt edges like some other reviewers, but I was checking on them frequently in the final minutes, and also we use an electric oven which may not run as hot as gas.  We found the final result to be crisp, melt-in-your-mouth, and delicious (as far as kale chips go).  There was still some of that signature bitter kale flavor, but this definitely made the kale more palatable.  If you want kale that doesn't taste anything like kale, try using it in a pasta recipe or something where it isn't the main ingredient.  Enjoy!

We were very excited for this recipe but were very disappointed with the results. Followed recipe exactly and can't seem to figure out how anyone would like these. We even made a few batches thinking we had done something wrong.

Super easy and yummy! I did the alternative idea as posted - used spray canola oil.  I am at 6500 feet elevation and baked them at 350 for exactly 10 minutes and they were perfect.  I recommend buying more kale than you would ever expect to like bc it shrinks down a lot!  Even super picky bf like them a lot.   Kind of like a really airy paper that disintegrates into yummy when you close your mouth.  Aroma of roasted broccoli while cooking. Yum!

My only question is what is the best way to store them so they don't lose their crisp?

I possibly didn't use the right kale. I used the 1 tbsp olive oil and prescribed amount of sea salt. 
Baked them at directed temp for amount of time given. 
Not as I expected. They were tough to chew, didn't smell right to me. 
Perhaps it is my faulty taste buds, but it may have been my error somewhere. I am not a big fan of kale chips. I had high hopes. Will stick with seaweed chips. Those I like, even after making just the one time. 
I am sorry and apologize to the original poster. But, just not my thing.

I've heard these are great, but didn't believe it until now. We liked them just before they were completely dry, which in my oven took about 13 minutes. If you save them though, make sure they ARE dry -- otherwise, you'll lose all the crispy ones! Whole family ate and enjoyed this!

I had frozen kale. I baked it at 300 degrees. I added nutritional yeast and Braggs seasoning along w olive oil. I checked on it periodically. moved it around due to moisture. I pulled it when it was chewy...not crispy.  Hubby and I devoured it in 10  min. Good earthy taste

Just tried making these for the first time. First batch I burned (oops!) but the second batch turned out just fine except for the taste. I prefer not to cover the taste of food with salt so that left them utterly bland even though the chips had a great aroma.

WOW!!! I have a secret...one fell on the floor and I picked it up and ate it anyways! These were great. I bought a huge bunch of curly kale at the local farmers market this weekend and couldn't wait to make these. I used organic coconut oil instead and drizzled it on. I seasoned with a Cajun seasoning mix I had and they turned out amazing. A hint of nutty flavor with some kick! Seriously, melted in my mouth!

This was my first time making kale chips and this recipe was great!! My oven does tend to run hot so I lowered the temp a teeny bit and checked on the kale every 5 mins. or so. They were ready after 8 minutes and sooo delicious! Even my 6 year old ate them and he won't normally touch kale.  Thanks for the great recipe LucyDelRay!!

OMG so yummy!! I used a little too much olive oil on my first try but overall the recipe is simple and tasty. 350 degrees for 10 minutes, leafy kale, olive oil and sea salt.

Taste fine if you eat them within a few hours. They lose crispness really quickly. Makes me sad.

Just made these for the first time. So YUMMY that my picky 6-year old even loved them! Per one reviewer, I held off on adding the salt until they had finished cooking, and then per another's I seasoned with cumin and a bit of Kosher salt. Will definitely try again soon.

After throwing away tons of the kale that comes in our organic box, I figured that I would try to do something with it and came accross this recipe.  They came out great!  I made sure to dry them individually with a paper towel, and then I mixed them with a small amount of extra virgin olive oil in the pan by hand ensuring that each leaf had a light coat of oil.  I added a pinch of sea salt before baking, and kept checking so they wouldn't over brown.  Delicious!  Next time I will try adding other spices and parm cheese that other reviewers mentioned and see how that comes out.

First the ime making kale chips..Delicious..my daughter and I finished them in just a few minutes.  I used vegetable spray, and Epicures Maple, Bacon Sea Salt..just a touch of sweet.  So good. Next time I will use two trays. Had too much for one, and I had to remove some part way through as they were done.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will be making this at least weekly!

Made half a batch with harissa olive oil and the other with lemon olive oil. Both were delish! Didn't have any burning edge problems. What a great idea. Will make these on a regular basis. What a great idea.

These were Great, right after I made them and tasted them, I had to make another batch.  It calls for seasoned salt, I used garlic salt.  I'm sure seasoned salt means your favorite kind of seasoned salt.  Next time I may try a different flavor.  Love, Love, will definitely make again and again.

This is a new favorite! I actually found a huge bag of prewashed kale leaves at the store and used them so it was terribly easy! I made them last night with dinner. My husband texted me as he was leaving work tonight "are you making kale chips tonight?" My son and I loved it too. Great new way to get veggies into our meal!

Not a hit in our house.  Some of the pieces were dried and disintegrated like puffs, others tasted burned and the rest didn't seem to be fully cooked and were still moist and somewhat chewy.  There doesn't seem to be a way to cook them evenly.  It's a creative idea but these will never be an alternative to chips.  I won't be making again.

Update:  I tried again,carefully watching the time.  Although we didn't have the wet limp areas, still not a hit.  We just find the kale too bitter.  Probably nothing wrong with the recipe.  The only thing really a conversation piece was how many people spit it out.

Some pieces were great but some were soggy and had no flavor. I want to attribute that to inadequate drying and seasoning. I will try again but similar results will make it a loss.

I love the originality of these and at first the crunch was great, but then I got a bite that was somewhere between a crunch and a squeak -- odd texture that made my teeth hurt and a sensation like scraping nails on a chalkboard...but probably just my own hang up. I say try the recipe anyway. It's low cal, healthy and unique.

Loved it- new way to eat all that awesome kale in our produce box!  Curly kale definitely worked better, gonna experiment with different flavors.  Way healthier than typical evening snacks!

These were soo good, I was skeptical because they don't look like they taste that good, but they taste much better than they look.Great alternative to potato chips!! I used garlic salt and cumin. Just doke sure you dont overdo the salt. Next time I will try them wih some parmesa cheese. I baked them at 320 for about 9 minutes :) will be making again soon.

I was disappointed. I really like kale in other recipes but I guess I'm not a big fan of kale chips. They turned out fine - the recipe was perfect for getting them dry and crispy - I just find them a bit too thin to be satisfying.

Kale isn't at the top of my favourites list but I know how good it is for you so if I have to eat it this is the way to do it. So crunchy and light. Yum! Thanks LucyDelRey.

A lot better than expected. I used baby kale because that's what I had, but it still turned out good and crispy. Only cooked it for about 7min.

Made this for the first time.  I drizzled grape seed oil instead and seasoned with cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and seasoning salt. Very tasty.  They taste the best hot out of the oven.

I've made these twice now, both times were a hit (hubby, friends, even my pickiest eater of a friend loved them). Coworkers say they cook theirs at a lower temperature and for longer but this works just fine. Definitely a recipe worth keeping.

OMG YUM! I've been trying the paleo diet but I find myself cheating more than following it. These chips will make a significant difference in my success! I used some baby kale and clipped the excess stems off, tossed them in oil and sprinkled a little sea salt on them. They baked faster since they're way thinner than regular kale. They had an almost identical texture to Lays potato chips! Oh and I didn't just drizzle the oil, I used a spoon to swirl them around and cover them completely.

I got a split decision from my kids on this recipe. My daughter loved it and I did too. I would definitely reduce the amount of season salt the next time I make them. Super easy semi-healthy snack!

Cannot even believe that I like these...but I do. Very light in your mouth. Don't move away from the oven after 8 minutes or you might get burnt kale! The very hesitant kids ate up the whole pan. I also served these to teenagers at a sleepover. After eyerolling from my daughter, and tentative nibbles from the other girls, they finished the bowl.

Excellent!  I had some timing issues with my first batch and a couple burned, but they are a great healthy alternative for a snack.  It is ESSENTIAL that the kale be as dry as possible.  I tossed the kale with the olive oil in a bowl so that the oil would be distributed more evenly and added parmesan cheese and salt.  Can't wait to try more combinations.

I enjoyed this recipe, but have to remember to make it in small batches because it went stale before I could eat it all! I also will tear the kale into much smaller pieces next time...about half the size of a chip. Pieces that were too big were a tad soggy. As some other reviewers mentioned, the curlier the kale, the better the crunch! I just used my hands to tear up the kale and mix the oil into the kale. Overall, a healthy, guilt-free and tasty treat!

Delicious and addicting!  I found between 8-9 minutes to be the sweet spot, and don't put too much kale on one baking tray.

Tried this today with kale from the garden. Make sure the thicker veins are removed to ensure drying evenly.  Used a baking stone preheated in oven for about 5 minutes. Baking is much more even. Delicious!

These were quite tasty next time I am getting creative. I am thinking drizzling them with sesame oil instead of olive oil, adding sea salt, and some sesame seeds would be quite tasty!

Always wanted to make my own kale chips and finally had the chance to.  Very simple and healthy alternative to chips, this is my go to snack when I want that crunchy/salty taste (besides roasted seaweed).  I have an electric stove, so 10 minutes was a little too long and burned a few chips slightly.  But still totally edible.

Oh My! One layer curly Kale, used the mister to apply the evoo. I was so paranoid about salt after reading the reviews that I had to add more after baking.lol  What a wonderful thing! Mine cooked perfectly in 8 minutes at 350, just keep an eye on them. I washed the kale yesterday, used salad spinner then left out for about an hour. Put the kale back in the fridge til tonight and it was nice and dry.

Absolutely will make them again and again.  Ate almost an entire bunch of Kale.  Addicting. Added some nutritional yeast, too.

Turned my make and one of my greyhounds finished off the chips. Sigh!  Guess I'll have to make some more.

This is fantastic! My oldest son came home from school and initially refused to try them, claiming, "They sound awful!" When I finally got him to try a small crunchy one, he paused, then proclaimed, "These are soooooo good!" He then proceeded to eat 1/3 of the bowl! I would give them a five star rating, but I'm having trouble getting the proper crunch to all of them - which seems to be a common problem based on reading reviews. I'm not sure if it's the recipe or me, so I may go back and revise it to a five after a few more attempts. I used cooking spray instead of drizzling it with olive oil.

I made this for the first time today because our kids were coming over for dinner and I saw this recipe and thought they would like something different to snack on. It was a huge it! The Kale was perfectly crunchy and you can add whatever flavor you like. I added a bit of garlic salt, then the next batch I made with onion salt; don't add too much salt because when you bake it with the olive oil, it tends to add its own salty taste, so try it lightly first and then add more salt per taste. I used garlic virgin olive oil. Wonderful healthy snack! I will make more to take with me to work for when I get the munchies and snack on those instead of chips! Just be sure to "check your teeth" afterwards!

My family and I were looking for a healthier alternative to potato chips and found this recipe. Thanks so much to everybody who posted concerning baking and watching them to keep from over/underbaking them. Our first batch came out fantastic and were an instant hit for our whole family. Love these chips!

These are really good when done right, but if you add a tad extra oil, or bake for too long, they will be soggy or burn.

I actually don't like kale very much.  That is, until today.  I absolutely love these baked kale chips.  I sprinkled them generously with gourmet salt and pepper, and I thought they were just wonderful!  What a great way to indulge in such a healthy vegetable!!

These were yummy and very easy.  My only concern is the use of olive oil at high heat as this oil has a low smoke point and could create unhealthy compounds if cooked too hot or too long. I'm wondering if this might account for the smell another reviewer referred to.  I baked mine as low as 325F and still had the last batch smoking.  Maybe canola oil would work?

Delicious but a little too salty/greasy for me. As is makes a great substitute for potato chips, but I am looking for something a bit healthier. Luckily it is an easy fix to decrease the amount of oil/salt. Hopefully they will still crisp properly (yet to try it) I also used garlic salt and some ground peppercorn and they were seasoned great :)

They were a hit with the daycare children. So light and yummy. I have never worked with kale, and I enjoyed making and trying something new and different with the children. Every week we "Try something new". Thank-you,

I've made these before with salt and parmesan cheese, and also mesquite seasoning and parmesan cheese.  The cheese adds an even more addicting flavor than just the salt by itself.  They're good any way you make them tho!

I also like this recipe best as to baking them at 350 degrees instead of lower temps.  I bought a bag of pre-washed, pre-torn kale at our Piggly Wiggly and I see that I will have to cut back on time to maybe 9-10 min.  The pieces are much smaller than when I break them up.  I also use an olive oil spray and I don't salt them until the kale is done baking.  Even when I sprinkle the salt sparingly before baking, they just taste too salty.  We love kale chips!

Simple and tasty. I did make one change - I used Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute (no salt) along with the olive oil. I used pink sea salt at the end. They did not last long. Will make again for healthy kale.

I bought a bag of kale at the grocery store not knowing what to do with it and then I discovered this recipe.  I made it and it was sitting on top of the stove cooling off.  My husband came through and grabbed a couple before I could tell him what it was.  He promptly proclaimed "this is good - what is it?"  Then I told him.  I'm baking more as I write this.  It's a keeper.  Healthy chip style snack.  Thanks

These are SO YUMMY! I baked them exactly as the recipe states, and they turned out absolutely perfect. Next time I will use a little less salt (the only thing I didn't do according to the recipe, I just sprinkled from the shaker) and add some garlic powder. This recipe is a definite winner, and couldn't be easier!

Extremely pleasantly surprised!  I've never had kale this way before and it was seriously good.  My 6yo even liked it.  I used too much seasoning salt, so I'll adjust that next time.  I would serve this at a get together in a heartbeat.  So good!!

pretty good.  A little finiky too make.  I had a hard time telling the difference between burnt and crisp.  Kids thought they were good - in small batches.

Had leftover kale from another recipe and we made these more as a joke then anything.  We liked them though.  I would probably make them again.

So easy and SOOO delicious. If you are watching your carbs and you love potato chips, this recipe is for you.

Just go light on the seasoning. Kale has such intense flavor on its own it's easy to over season them.

I was so excited to try these but they just weren't what I was expecting.  One batch was way too salty and another, with light salt and some garlic powder, wasn't great either.

I had high expectations based on the reviews.  these taste nothing like potato chips, they taste exactly like kale.  They edges were crispy but the centers were chewy.  I tried cooking them a little longer but then they tasted a little burnt and were still chewy in the center.  My pieces were pretty small.

sorry, but these kale "chips" are not good. I know, I was warned by the submitter not to expect "chips", but still . . . they just didn't even have a good flavor. Now granted, I am NOT a kale fan, so perhaps that is the reason I would not have liked them in any case. Just was hoping that the basic flavor of the kale could be masked by baking and flavoring.

I really wanted to love them... after watching youtube videos and looking up recipes online.. 10 min was too long in my oven and my first batch burnt.  Second batch was done in 5 min and tasted like dried herb :(  The texture is quite nice, like fried spinach, really brittle.  I won't be making them again.

This just was not very good. The first batch burned after 10 minutes and I didn't like the seasoned salt taste. The next two batches I cooked for less time and used sea salt instead, and we just didn't like them at all. I tried!

Holy cow, WAY salty! And I really felt like I just put a light dusting of seasoning on them. Interesting texture, but would definitely not make again, even with different seasoning. Well, off to find another way to enjoy kale!

It's interesting, but really, I think the salt is really what it is all about.  I cannot give it a rave review, some pieces were bitter.  Texture is not really a chip--it dissolves like cotton candy.  Weird.

wow! i have never bought kale but today it was on sale so I thought I would try the Kale chips. I'm doing the Blood type diet and Kale is recommended!
I prepared and cooked 1/2 a bunch (just in case it was gross) but as soon as I tasted 1, I got the bunch back out and cooked the rest! This is a snack that will be around -diet or no diet!

Tried this recipe yesterday and was thrilled with the result. I put a mixture of salt, pepper, chili powder,garlic and a pinch of cayenne on the cleaned, dried and olive oiled kale. Spread the coated kale in a single layer on a cookie sheet and bake for 15 - 20 minutes.  They really took about 20 minutes to crisp totally. My family just loved them. I guess I have to head to the store for more kale.

Delicious, healthy, and super simple! I sprayed mine with a butter flavored cooking spray rather than drizzling them with olive oil because it just seemed easier. Sprinkled with sea salt. Mine baked for about 11 minutes. I've been munching on them since they came out of the oven. They were by far my favorite part of dinner.

Absolutely fantastic. I've only just started down the path to eating healthy and literally every health fanatic I've spoken with highly recommended kale as the king of healthy foods. Unfortunately, I detest the texture of greens usually, so I've been looking for new ways to prepare them. I love these though, enough that I registered just to five-star this.  It's great experimenting with seasonings too, I even took prepared some before work and took them in to snack on, and a couple of colleagues had to admit they're delicious. So much so that I can no longer eat them at my desk, as it's guaranteed half my chips will go "missing".

I've always loved the idea of kale because of how healthy it is, but this is the first recipe I've tried that I really loved! I used the top from someone about adding a bit of soy sauce instead of salt before baking and I really loved the flavor!

These are great with sea salt though I made some with the rosemary garlic seasoning from Sam's and they were irresistible!  I think even garlic powder or fresh garlic would be good or pretty much any seasoning you like if you want variety!  As others have mentioned, bringing these to a party is definitely a conversation item!

I am a very healthy eater and very used to the sometimes bland taste of healthy foods. My husband is a marginal eater,very glad to eat anything I prepare, but horrible left to his own devices. I was thrilled to try this recipe, trying to find a way to get some of the less traditional leafy greens into our diet and find something to sub for his potato chip craving. These chips are crispy,salty kale... Tastes bitter like kale, overly salty and with a bad aftertaste.

Not sure if my Kale wasn't as good as it should've been but I found these to have a bitter taste that stays in your mouth.   My girlfriend liked them but I think the closeness to potato chips is only from the oil and salt but the main taste isn't too good.

These are so delicious...I took the advice of another poster and used my misto to spray on the olive oil. I also added some chili powder which gave a nice spice to it. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to store the kale chips to keep them fresh? After letting them cook I put them in a tupperware, however they were on the soft/chewy side the next day...thanks for any input!

Wonderful.   Even my husband loved these and he isn't a big Kale eater.   Do wash the kale very well if not organic though.

I was not sure what to expect but, quite pleased with the outcome.  I took them out of the oven just before they browned and they were crispy, salty like a potato chip should be.  I'll be making this again.

Fantastic way to use Kale!! I grow my own Kale and am always looking for new ways to use it. These "chips" look a little weird but taste absolutely wonderful and they even store well. Kale is so good for you and I feel good about setting out a bowl to munch on. I was pleasantly surprised when my 6 yr old granddaughter asked for more. I haven't found anyone yet that doesn't like them. Great recipe!!!

Great Recipe! Instead of salt, I used a little soy sauce. I also added a few tablespoons of pure maple syrup and some tahini. So good and so addicting!

I love these! I made 1/2 with olive oil and season salt, other 1/2 with olive oil and soy sauce. They are both good, but they came out crispier with just olive oil & season salt. My son even ate them, I think these can take the place of regular chips.

These are what they are...no way are they potato chips.  That said, they were very good.  They were crunchy and tasted good. Hubby didn't like them but he doesn't like any potato alternatives.  He wants the real thing.  I enjoyed them.  I would suggest you make them yourself and try.

Love this recipe!  Remember not to crowd the kale and go light on the Olive Oil ( I went a little heavy the first time) and for added flavor I tossed the kale with garlic powder and red pepper flakes as well as salt and served this with Tzatziki or (any yogurt sauce) for dipping on the side.  DELICIOUS!

These turned out very tasty, but a bit salty. If I make them again, I will only use about 1/2 a teaspoon of seasoned salt.

I was EXTREMELY skeptical when I made these, I expected to throw them in the trash. I was blown away. They are really good. Nothing like chips but I am not a chip person anyway. Go easy on the salt, I over salted my first batch. Will be making these all the time.

Good recipe however I found it way too salty.  Recommend to reduce salt or add other non salty spices such as the various 'No more salt' spices.

Pleasantly Surprised! 
I had never heard of kale chips before today, and have no recollection of ever eating kale before. I was pleasantly surprised! Even my kids ate them and liked them! They do not taste like potato chips. They are what they are....kale. But, Don't let that discourage you. Easy to make and full of nutrition! Will make again, probably often. I used garlic olive oil, kosher salt and baked the full 15 minutes. Turned out perfect.

This is such a great idea! I added olive oil and worchestire sauce which turned out great. It was a mix of the crunchy and the chewy - I cooked them for 10 minutes then 3 more, watching. My kids (7 & 4) ate them within 5 minutes! Definately going to make again.

I absolutely love these.  My very very picky kid loves them too.  I crave these things.  I use very little salt but they are still delicious.

awesome!  my kids, who aren't picky and love barley and kale soup and cauliflower couscous, didn't jump up and down over it, but i LOVE it.  this will be a great salty/crunchy fix that also handles my veggie cravings.

I bought kale for the first time at the farmers market today and didn't know what to do with it.  Decided on making the chips and it turned out ok, definently not a replacment for potato chips.  Will find another recipie for the rest of my kale.

These are great! My 3 yr old loves them. I baked them on my Pampered Chef stoneware and increased the time to 15 minutes, they turned out great. I also used, on the second batch, the Smoky Applewood Rub from The Pampered Chef and they were amazing!!!!

These were wonderful...and addicting!  I just loved the crunch however they were a bit salty (but I can have a heavy hand at times). I tried two different kinds...this one with the sea salt and olive oil and another batch with soy sauce and olive oil. The soy sauce batch was the favorite of everyone.  I took the advice of other reviewers and drizzles oil in a bowl before adding the kale then tossed...it got nicely coated this way. Then drizzled with soy sauce.  I also lowered the oven temp to 300 degrees and made sure to watch it closely...also do not stir!...it was perfectly crispy around  the 20-25 minute mark.  What a great way to serve kale!

Not spectacular tasting but darn right addictive! I used less oil by drizzling around the edge of a bowl adding the kale and a sprinkle of sea salt then mixing everything until it was evenly coated. I was on the phone describing them to my husband and before I knew it I had eaten half a bunch of kale! They remind me more of toasted seaweed then potato chips

These are so good!!! I dont know if my oven runs hot, but mine were done in 6.5 minutes. They have the flavor of a potato chip crossed with pumpkin seeds, and definitely satisfy my salty snack craving.

These are a great way to satisfy a potatoe chip craving without guilt! I used garlic salt, but I'm sure seasoned salt will be great too. The only thing I would change is the cooking time. I put the leaves straight on a cookie sheet-no parchment paper- and they were crispy in 7 minutes. They would have burned in 10 minutes. I let them cool on the countertop for a few minutes, I think that helped crisp them up too.

So tasty, delicious and healthy! I added more oil (not needed) and more kosher salt (not needed); don't do like I did and try and fix what isn't broken.  Despite my screw-ups these were tasty (albeit too salty) and addictive.  I'll make them again -- and often -- following the recipe exactly.

Wow, these are really great!  I used a prewashed/cut bag of kale which make it super easy, though I think it'd be nicer with larger sized leaves prepped by hand if you have the time to do so. I used a Misto with olive oil, and plenty of sea salt, and it took probably 12-13 minutes in the oven.  This is will definitely be a new "go-to" when I'm craving a salty snack. It's amazing how mild these taste after baking despite the strong flavor of kale.  Thanks for a super idea!

I love these baked with olive oil and low sodium soy sauce.
I have a convection oven, so I set mine to 325. 9 minutes in my oven is perfect.

I was looking for a healthy alternative to my chip cravings when I found this recipe.  When cooked correctly I found that kale chips are highly addictive and I would eat the whole batch in a sitting.  However when cooked incorrectly they taste pretty gross.  I messed up in two ways; firstly I did not completely dry the kale so they came out of the oven soggy and bitter tasting.  Secondly I kept the kale chips in the oven for a little too long and they tasted burnt.  You really have to check on the kale a couple of times while it's in the oven.  If you do cook the kale correctly you end up with a tasty treat.

WOW!! Never would've believed Kale could taste soooo good! Make sure your leaves are dry and I seasoned mine with a natural chipotlet black bean dip packet..omgosh soooo delish. I also did some with just sea salt and they were great as well. You have to try this recipe!

Really good! I used an olive oil mister, a tiny bit of sea salt, and cooked for about 5-7 mins. There is a slight brussel sprout taste to the kale, but not enough to be offensive. My husband liked them too.

This is very very good! I didnt have seasoned salt so i sprinkled a little Tony's for added flavor. It took only 12 minutes to cook and was already very crunchy. My husband and I were not expecting it to be delicious but now it's one of our favorites!  Thank you so much for sharing.  A delicious way to eat vegetable!

Had heard about these from a few friends so decided to give it a try.  Was a little skeptical but once I tried it I was sold!  These were delish!  My hubby who is a professional chef even asked for the recipe!

If there were 6 stars... it would get it!  I just came off of a 21 day detox/cleanse/fast & as I was researching healthy snack options that would be easy on my stomach as I introduce food back into my system, I found this exact recipe in a magazine... then found it here!  WOW!  They are great!

After reading some of the reviews, I set my oven at 330-340 and let them cook for only 6-8 mins!  they came out amazingly!  I did a small batch at first for trial and error... no errors!  Perfect! I love salt, so this has been a joy to my taste buds!

Thank you for posting!

I made these last night after seeing them on a blog. I was not expecting much, honestly, but they were delicious. Some of the chips were done before others, so I just took the crispy ones off & put the rest back in the oven for a couple minutes. I do think I overbaked some of them just slightly which left an aftertaste I was not fond of, but I will definitely make these on a regular basis. My 8 year old loved them, and my boyfriend who is probably annoyed by my more "healthy choice" options lately said they weren't bad either.

I overbaked my chips, but they were still pretty good and a great way to satisfy a salt craving!  I do think 15 minutes is too long, at least on my oven.  Next time I'll check around 10-11 minutes.  I used garlic salt (thanks for that idea, other reviewer!) on half and just salt on the other and both were good.  Next time I think I'll also make them a little bigger; I tore them into small pieces and think that had something to do with the overbaking, too.

What did I do wrong?  Maybe the kale wasn't fresh, but I wanted so BADLY for these to be good!  It made our kitchen smell awful - like bad broccoli, and that's what it tasted like, too.  Did I do something wrong?

I would cut down on the seasoned salt next time....start with 1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon and do one pass with the salt.  I used a recipe for Copycat Lawry's Seasoned Salt.  I used tinfoil instead of parchment. These were done at 12 mins.  I served with Cucumber Sandwiches off allrecipes.

My husband and I are always finding healthier options and so when I came across this recipe, I knew I had to try it.

Sooooo easy to make.  I like to keep olive oil in a spray bottle, so all I did was spray the kale pieces with olive oil, and I sprinkled with himalayan sea salt.  (just estimated salt amount).

I love love love these chips.  My husband always requests for me to make these. 

An excellent alternative to potato chips.

I love these kale chips! Sometimes I season them with a cajun spice mix but really anything makes them taste great. I added pepper to this recipe.

Wonderful snack Lucy! 
You won't miss potato chips when you replace them with this healthy version. Great way for children to get more vegetables.
I season mine with garlic salt.

I love the fact that I finally got some greens down. I'm not a big fan of greens. I'm not giving 5 stars because...it was really bitter. I'll have to find a way around that. And though I cut the amount of salt in half, it still was unbearably salty. I'll cut that down even more next time...because there WILL be a next time!

What a wonderful healthy chip 'appetizer' to nibble while prepping weeknight dinners!  From now on, I'll keep cleaned kale leaves in the fridge so I'm always only 10 minutes away from this nutritious snack.

Wow...who knew?  Mine were a bit too salty so I may have had a smaller bunch but other than that they were great.  I used garlic and chili infused olive oil to give a little spice and since I only have stone bakeware they didn't crisp as much as I would have likedb ut the taste was still really good.  I may have to go out and buy a different baking sheet just for this recipe.

This is hands-down my favorite winter food.  I've eaten it using different seasongs:  just sea salt, garlic salt and grated parmesan cheese, italian seasoning, garlic salt and a sprinkling of balsamic vinegar...etc.  You can't go wrong.  I crave it!

mmm, delicious! i baked mine for 11 minutes and they were perfect. I added too much seasoning so they were a bit salty, but still tasty. I also added some roasted garlic olive oil that i always keep on hand and it added a lot of flavor. i dipped them in some homemade hummus and could probably eat them for an entire meal. :)

These chips are GREAT!  My family would never eat kale but loved this.    I sprayed the kale with olive oil and just sprinkled with seasoned salt. Very easy to make and a healthy snack.   Thank you LucyDelRey for sharing this excellent recipe.

Really good - my kale was a little wet when it went into the oven so it took an extra 10 minutes or so to get crispy.  Even the hubs ate them.

Was skeptical but these were sooo good.  I add cayenne to mask the kale taste more and use less oil and salt.  Cook in one layer for even crispiness.  For the record, I hated kale until I had these.

Very, very good! Don't be tempted to add too much salt. You just need a sprinkling.

Good for the WOW factor and conversation topic.  Definetly use soy or garlic to give flavor and make sure the kale is crisp and dry when you take it out of the oven.  One layer works better.

Honestly I thought these were going to be disgusting But oh my goodness they are SO Good!!! I honestly just cant get enough of them when I make them. My local grocer has been out of kale for the last week and it is killing me since I want to make these Kale chips again! Ive also tried putting different seasonings of my own, kind of making a mix of my own, and they are just as good. make the first set as the directions say and then go from there

perfect!  i eat a lot of kale, but my kids generally don't touch it.  My 16 month old is chowing on these right now (3.5 year old won't try them, but he had fun helping to make them!). I used precut, bagged kale, drizzled EVOO, pepper, sea salt, garlic powder and a smidge of chili powder straight on the baking sheet, then stirred and baked for 16 minutes.  Will probably make again tomorrow!

So good! I love vegetables crispy crispy, so I'd just reccomend to be careful not to undercook them. The kale is chewy if you do. But other than that, this recipe was amazing! Better than any potato chip I've had in a long time, and so much healthier!

You could definitely turn this into a fun crispy salad, or play around with seasonings (though how can you go wrong with olive oil and salt?)

As odd as this sounded I decided to give this a try. I sprayed with olive oil pam spray & sprinkled salt on them, baked for 10 minutes. My husband hated them, I thought they were ok.

I really liked this. I didn't have any seasoned salt, so I used a tiny amount of sea salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Very good results, and a neat new way to eat healthy food!

Baked 8 mins at 350.  Just dry.  Brown and they are a bit bitter.  Ditto to all reviewer's high marks.  Had kale left over from Zuppa Tuscano with NO idea what to do with it.  I tried both sesame oil w/season salt and olive oil with garlic salt.  Excellent.  NOT potato chips and probably wouldn't last for trasport (at least not in a lunch bag) but great way to use extra kale and get a good green veggie boost.

These are EXCELLENT!  I finally found a great substitution for my husband's potato chips.    I didn't bother with parchment paper 'cause it's not something I have lying around the house.  I made half with olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt and half with low fat cheddar cheese.  Both were great!

These were great!!!!  What a wonderful option for Kale!  I do agree that the cooking time is crucial!!!!  Watch them like a hawk..... too brown is bad and limp kale needs to be cooked a tad bit longer.

This recipe seemed a bit odd at first considering kale is usually served raw or sauteed, but it was strangely good. It's nice having a salty treat that is actually healthy! Instead of salt, I used Lawry's seasoning salt to give it extra flavor. It is really easy to over salt this, so be careful. I will definitely be making this again.

Wow, these are good but it calls for so much salt! And I'm a salty kind of person. So take that as a hint and maybe half the amount required.

Very different than I expected, but in a good way.  However, the kids were not fond of them, and I could only eat a few before I didn't want them anymore.  May suggest trying to flavor them a bit differently before cooking.

These were very easy to make and sort of a fun alternative to snacky foods. Both my 18mos old and 6yr old tried them and ate a few more after that.   I liked them best drizzled with olive oil, and then sprinkled with garlic salt and chili powder. Will make again.

I just made these tonight and my husband and boys (ages 9, 7, and 5) ate them right off the pan as fast as I pulled them out of the oven. Thanks for sharing this tasty and nutritious recipe. Now I know what to do with all that kale I get from my CSA.

These taste great when freshly made! I'm struggling to find a way to store them that preserves the crispyness though.

Not sure if I got this one right.  Got the dried herb feeling when I put it in my mouth like another reviewer said, and then it kind of turned chewy and hard to swallow.

Yum!! Skeptical, but lovely! Added some garlic, gave 4 stars because only needed 7-8 minutes in the oven. If I'd put it in for the full time it would have burnt.

Who knew kale could be so tasty?!  My 13 month old loved these - they kind of crunch but also melt in your mouth, so they're great for the less toothy members of the family.

Baked up nice and crispy, tasted alright(different) but once cooled I put them in a ziplock bag to store and just since last night(when I made them) they are now (some of them) not as crispy and the smell is horrible in my pantry now. It's really not worth it, plus WAY oily.

WOW- these were surprisingly good! They were easy to make too. I ate some right out of the oven and I put the rest in a tupperware container and they were still good two days later. You might try putting the fresh kale in a bowl and tossing them with olive oil and salt in the bowl instead of trying to drizzle it over when the kale is on the cookie sheet. I added some fresh ground pepper to mine and it was delicious!

These were absolutely delicious. I also used soya sauce instead of salt. Lowered the oven temperature to 325 and set timer for 6 minutes, checked the chips then set the timer for 5 more minutes. Placed on paper towel and they never even made it to the chip bowl. Thanks for a great recipie.

Surprisingly good! Only change was that I added my own seasonings (garlic salt, onion salt, parmesean) and on the 2nd batch, I only used olive oil spary, no oil. Have to keep an eye on timing, I stuck with 10 min. These little treats melt in your mouth. Best if eaten within a couple of hours after baking, otherwise they either get soggy (too much oil) or stale.

Really simple and good!  Dont' put the baked chips in a closed Ziploc bag; I did and the moisture from the oil on the kale chips caused all the chips to become soft again.  Yummy!

I bought a 16-oz bag of kale cut into bite-size pieces. This is a scrumptious way to fix kale, and I will be making it again in the future.

Yum Yum! I love this recipe and so does my 14 month old! I do use a little less seasoning than the recipe calls for to cut down on the salt.

These were so yummy and a great way to use up the kale I had from the garden.  I have a hard time getting my little guy to eat green things unless they are peas and he loved these.

This was great! I added a small amount of soy sauce for a little extra flavor.  I'm very impressed!  Thanks for the recipe!
