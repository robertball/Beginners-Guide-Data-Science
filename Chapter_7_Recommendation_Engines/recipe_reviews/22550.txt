I tried this recipe when I couldn't find my standard marshmallow-topped recipe for 
sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving. I actually like this version better than my own! 
It is very easy to throw together, and the orange juice really compliments the flavor
well! An added bonus that is a family tradition in my house - the little ones are given
the responsiblity of putting the miniature marshmallows in PERFECT rows on top of 
the mashed sweet potatoes. It gives them something to do, makes them feel as if
they helped prepare the Thanksgiving meal also (what smiles when you tell them what
a great job they did!) and it keeps them out of your hair for at least 15-20 minutes 
while they are busy at the table! My six year old son loved doing it! I am 45 years old
and this has been my job at Thanksgiving since I was about his age. Some family traditions
never change- just the recipe gets better!

I used raw honey and brown sugar substitute instead of sugar.  My husband said they were the best mashed sweet potatoes he's ever had and he had some a week ago that he loved at the Grand Lux Cafe (that's why I wanted to make some).  This was my first time ever making home made mashed potatoes of any kind.  I loved them.  Easy and delicious.  My husband thought they were better than candied yams too.

I thought 1 cup of orange juice was too much. Next time I'll only add half a cup. And maybe a tablespoon or 2 of brown sugar. The orange flavor overpowered the potatoes too much.

My husband wanted to know what the special occasion was!  I used honey and brown sugar in place the white sugar.  I did not have any marshmallows though.  Still, it was great!  I can't wait to serve this at the holidays to family!

Tastes as it should.  Orange juice is a nice touch, and I found the 1 cup to be about the right amount.

This was fantastic!  I've never eaten sweet potatoes until I met my fiance, and I'm trying to make the things that he likes - and boy did he like these!  Said they were better than his mom's!  I substituted the honey and brown sugar for the white sugar.  I would use less OJ next time.  And be careful where your oven rack is placed...marshmallows go up in flame!

I made this for Thanksgiving. There's too much OJ and not enough sugar. No one ate seconds and most didn't finish their first serving.

I didn't care for the taste of the orange juice with the sweet potato. It was a little too mush and took away from the yams.

i love the opportunity to maximize my veggie co-op!  i baked my sweet potatoes at 400 for 50 minutes so the skins came off easily, then mashed with brown sugar and fresh-squeezed OJ.  cut the butter in half.  and in a rare moment of good behavior, skipped the marshmallows.  flavors complement well, would've been AMAZING with the marshmallows!

Wonderful recipe!  I cut down on the OJ, and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Other than that I followed the recipe as is.  I use this as my staple side dish for the holidays!  Thank you Milena!

These were yummy but next time I'll beat them rather than mash them and I'll add a little brown sugar.

My hubby who loves sweet potatoes thought this was as good as the candied yams we have for Thanksgiving and my picky kids also loved it and asked me to fix it again.

Simply delicious. Love the hint of OJ flavor. I substituted brown sugar and honey instead of white sugar. Next time, I probably won't blend the potatoes as much; I like a thicker casserole. Also, I may add some cinnamon.

Really very good. I adjusted the seasonings a bit, I like cloves and nutmeg with sweet potatoes, but the orange juice was very nice, and the marshmallows on top made it a hit with the kids

Never making these before, I wanted to make a small casserole dish. I used three large sweet potatoes/yams and less than half of the OJ, butter, and sugar, smoothering the mix with marshmallows on top. They loved it. I'll save this receipt and make the full amount next time.

I was trying to mimic a recipe from a restaurant my husband and I go to.  For some reason I couldn't get them creamy enough.
