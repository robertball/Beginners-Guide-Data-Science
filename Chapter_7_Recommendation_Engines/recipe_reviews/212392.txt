These were ok, but I found the dough was pretty bland and not at all sweet. Next time I will definately increase the sugar in the dough- maybe to 1/2c? Also I added the cinnamon to the honey syrup as it cooked, rather then sprinkling it on top. This made it easy to evenly coat the loukoumades with cinnamon. I found that 2 tbsp of dough was to much for one, so I decreased the size to 1 big tbsp instead.

Great!!!It is one of the most famous dessert, especially at holidays, Christmas and New Years eve. In Corfu, it is the most favorite dessert at Saint Spyridon's day, which is the most glory day on the whole island! They could be even without the eggs. And without putting on the honey surop but some powdered sugar with a lot of cinnamon!!!Delicious!!!

mine weren't perfect circles, but they were delicious. I also mixed the cinnamon right into the honey syrup when it was boiling.

They came out great but I had to make a few changes. The dough wasn't sweet and drizzling honey on it wasn't enough for us. What I did was add the honey and water to a pot and add about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of sugar to the pot along with a cinnamon stick. I let it come to a boil then I lowered the heat and let it simmer about 5 minutes. When the mixture was done I took the balls and put them in the syrup for about 3 minutes and let them soak up some of that flavor. DELICIOUSLY PERFECT!!!!

Recipe was really good. I just added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the dough and it had a good flavor.

These were delicious.  However, I was hoping they'd be a little lighter with the egg.  I had syrup already prepared with cinnamon already in it.

Definitely tasted good. I followed some suggestions in the comments to add the cinnamon and some sugar to the honey syrup, then let them soak in it. I would suggest using maybe half a teaspoon to a whole teaspoon of dough per puff; mine puffed up big while frying. It also made so many that it took me 2 hours just to fry them all 0.0

Wow delicious amazing recipe as is! I personally j
didn't change anything about this, everything came out beautifully and delicious. If you're not an experienced doughnut maker though just remember the only trick is keeping it at a good temperature not too hot or too cold. And for goodness sakes use anything except soybean based vegetable oils and you will be good.

I love this recipe , the only thing I changed was that I used rapid rise yeast to decrease the amount of time it took to rise.

I only used one tablespoon of batter instead of two, because otherwise they were too big. I put the lid on the container I put them in and shook it around to distribute the syrup.

My friend and I made these for a project we did on Greece, everyone loved them and we got an A. We  added a little orange extract to the dough for some flavor and they turned out really well.
