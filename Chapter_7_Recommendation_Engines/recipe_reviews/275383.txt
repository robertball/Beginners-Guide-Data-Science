LOVED this recipe! The CAULIPOWER crust baked up so nice and crispy and the flavor combo of the toppings were spot on! Who knew a cauliflower crust could turn out this good? This was far superior to any I've tried in the past (even my own homemade). My local grocery store chain has these on sale right now and I will be stocking up so that I can make this sprouts/onion/bacon topped one again soon.

I can't  believe this CAULIPOWER doctored up pizza is gluten free!  I made this recipe exactly as written. I think it's perfect.   The cauliflower crust bakes up crispy and the added toppings make it a gourmet treat!

I absolutely loved this pizza! The CAULIPOWER crust was crispy after cooking, so you could pick up the slices (not an experience I've had with other cauliflower crusts)! The flavor was exactly what you'd expect from a cheese pizza - so the base was just right. What you do with from there is up to you, though I enjoyed the bacon & brussels sprouts combo since I like those things. This recipe says each pizza is 4 servings, but the box says each pizza is 2 servings and I have to say that's probably more accurate, although I did make it work by serving a lot of salad and fruits on the side - everyone was left wanting more! I really couldn't be happier about this product, I even craved this dish again the following week!

I am absolutely making this again.  Like, a lot.  I used a frozen CAULIPOWER margherita pizza (instead of the 3-cheese) and I think the tomatoes gave it a nice bit of color (plus: tomatoes!)  The only other change I made was to leave off the bacon to make this vegetarian.  It's absolutely delicious and I can't believe I've never put Brussels sprouts on a pizza.  I have clearly been living life wrong for 37 years and today I saw the light.  
No more.  This was really quick and better-for-me version of my normal go-to frozen pizzas on busy nights and I suspect will make a good lunch tomorrow (keep you updated!)   
My oven set at 425 took about 16-17 minutes to get bubbly but I left it in about 20 and the edges of the Brussels sprouts got just a little charred and really brought out their flavor.  I also finished cooking my pizza off the cookie sheet, directly on the oven rack and will probably forego the sheet entirely next time.  
Seriously.  So sad I've just now discovered this combo.  But onward I must go, armed with new, delicious knowledge.

I made this CAULIPOWER pizza exactly by the recipe. My husband and I felt like we were eating a gourmet, delicious-tasting pizza! It comes together quickly, and delivers big. While the crust isn’t as crispy as regular, it definitely doesn’t give away the secret that it’s cauliflower.

This CAULIPOWER recipe is a great weeknight option!  I made it exactly as written, and it turned out so delicious-tasting - the whole family loved it!  The crust baked up nice and crispy, with the perfect result of cheesy yet good-for-you!  I served it with a side salad to complete a healthy gluten-free meal.

No doubt a Brussels Sprout lovers pizza!!!  We loved it and it is so easy to make!  Using the better-for-you CAULIPOWER pizza as a base make this a quick dinner and the pizza was crispy and delicious tasting.   I love Brussels Sprouts and this was a great change for them, and bacon?  Well you know it doesn't get better than that!
