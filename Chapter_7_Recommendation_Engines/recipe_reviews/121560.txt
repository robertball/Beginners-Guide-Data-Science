This was a delicious meal, and very easy too.  I added more spices to the salmon and the yogurt sauce though--whatever was in my kitchen (more dill, basil, parsley, garlic powder).  The sauce could have been thicker, but it was still great.

I made this tonight for my me and my boyfriend as a party of a healthy dinner.  He LOVED it which says a lot as it's hard to get him to eat healthy food.  Definitely give this a try...super easy and quick.  I added a little more dill than the recipe to called for to add some flavor, but overall yummy as written!

SUPER EASY and very tasty.  I used Greek yogurt and Truvia to cut the fat and carbs even more, and the taste was fantastic.

Loved it! We had some salmon that wasn't very good, but everyone loved it with the dill sauce!

Yum!  As another reviewer said she did, I added a bit of Old Bay Seasoning.  Wonderful recipe!

FAbulous!!!! I seasoned the salmon with a little Old Bay and Garlic Plus as well as the dill. I accidentally put more sugar than called for, and one daughter complained the sauce was too sweet but my other daughter and I polished it off. I'll make this again, next time I'll start with the requisite amount of sugar ;) and take it from there. Thanks, Janet!!!

Dang Good.  Easy to put together with ingredients in the house.  I subed lowfat sour cream because that was all I had.  But still, very good!
