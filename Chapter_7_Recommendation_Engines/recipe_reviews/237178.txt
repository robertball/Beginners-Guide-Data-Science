So I made this hot instead of cold, for dinner, by cooking the shrimp in the dressing in a pan, and it was the best allrecipes meal that I made all week!  We loved it and will def make again.

8.9.16   This is a really nice summer meal.  I did use lemon bow tie pasta, and  I didn't add fhe shredded  cheddar cheese garnish,  just couldn't see cheddar on a nice shrimp salad like this (personal taste preference).

Perfect served either hot or cold.  Farfalle (bow ties) is the perfect pasta for this meal.  Serve it with a side salad and its a delicious, attractive dish to serve for company!

Very nice light tasting pasta salad! I made a few tweaks though. Instead of chicken broth I used mayo. And instead of cheddar cheese I added feta cheese. Topped it off with fresh dill because it pairs so nicely with lemon. Yum!

Wonderful pasta salad.  The combination of the peppery dressing with the bright lemon and the Luscious shrimp really made our whole family happy

Easy and tasty, I was inspired to substitute by boiling the shrimp shells as a substitute for the chicken broth (thinking clam juice next time) sub’d Romano for the Cheddar, and I’m waiting to see what fresh basil will do. Easy and fun to experiment with.

I thought it was okay. I used the rainbow rotini and double the dressing to make it less dry.  No issues with the pepper, I thought it tasted fine. Not quite sure if I will make this again.

Great recipe except for the pepper??  I was doubling the recipe but did not double the pepper.  It was still waaay too hot.  I like spicey, and  was still too hot for me.  Since I was brining this for a pot luck I knew it would be too hot for most folks.  I added a small amount of mayo and lemon juice to cool it down but still very hot.  Will make again with 1/8 tsp. of pepper.  Wondering if the 1 tsp of pepper was a misprint??

I didn’t have green onions but subbed with green peas. (My kids love peas, so why not) I also used fissuli pasta. I’m a lover of lemon so I loved this dish. Light, tangy and just delish. I also subbed the cheddar with Parmigiana cheese. Seemed more fitting for a dish like this. We will make it again.

I decided to serve it warm, only adding the dressing at the end and letting it get heated up by the pasta and shrimp. Not a bad dish, but seemed a little off; too much sour, not enough other flavor. It's an easy recipe, so I'll try it again, maybe keeping it cold this time, or cooking the dressing with the shrimp, as one cook mentioned.

Simple and tasty.  I made it hot and cold.  I liked it better hot.

I really wanted to like this, but it was bland, and the cheddar cheese was just wrong.

This was good, although I served it hot over fettuccini and mixed things up a bit but I did use the basic recipe except no yogurt.

Never will I waste $10 on this simply awful recipe. Sour, peppery. shrimp way over salted. Absolutely boring. So sorry I spent so much money on the ingredients. Better off just boiling the shrimp. Making a pasta with mayo, greek dressing, fresh dill. capers, grape tomatoes and crunchy celery. Better than this travesty of a dressing. Ghastly.

Family voted it a “keeper” , but commented without the cheese.  It just didn’t seem to fit.  Doubled the sauce, too.

Didn’t use all of the sauce, though it might be a bit too “saucy”.  My husband and I loved this dish very much, and will definitely make it again - :)

I don't follow any recipes exactly because i like to use just what i have in the kitchen already. I omitted the scallions, Subbed the yogurt for milk and a little flour and swapped the cheddar for parmesan. It was a little tangy but my fiance and i like tangy!

I would probably not  add as much garlic. The garlic taste was quite strong for my liking. I also prefer a thicker sauce. I made this dish for Christmas and no one ate it. I made a double serving and I ended up throwing it away.
