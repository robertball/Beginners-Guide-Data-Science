WOW! Just WOW! I'm not going to lie, pork is my least favorite meat and while I eat cooked carrots, I don't love them. With that being said, this recipe was excellent! The carrot romesco isn't the prettiest thing to look at (think baby food) but the flavor is incredible and really compliments the pork. Pork tenderloin is bland to me but not in this recipe. The one change I made was in the salad. My little store doesn't carry watercress or the baby mustard greens that the recipe submitter said it could be substituted for so I used baby spinach instead and that works just fine too. The salad isn't the star of this recipe in my opinion so you could use whatever you wanted or had on hand.  If you want to impress your guests, this is the recipe to do it with. 5 stars all the way!
