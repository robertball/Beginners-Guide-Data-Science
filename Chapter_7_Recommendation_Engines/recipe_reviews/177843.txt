Really simple, really quick, I may use regular Italian sausage next time for more heartiness. I added a little salt and pepper with cayenne and it tasted great. Definitely think the salsa 1 cup ingredient needs to be like 1 1/2 or 2 cups, thats the only change I did and I did 5 cups of swanson instead of 4, overall good recipe, will cook this again

My 15 year old granddaughter and I tried this recipe. We replaced the kielbasa with some sweet Italian sausage balls I had in the freezer.  We both liked the taste and I really appreciated the ease.  Will absolutely make this again.

I was skeptical of this as the salsa/kielbasa combination sounded a little odd to me.  But, when the kielbasa was thawed and the bag of kraut I thought was in the regfrigerator wasn't actually there, I was kind of in a bind.  I used the Pace medium salsa, tossed in about a half of an onion chopped that was sitting in the fridge and a little garlic along with the turmeric, and only used the kielbasa - no shrimp, no chicken.  It turned out great!  It had a nice heat level and the kielbasa and salsa really did go well together.  This is definitely one of those 'in a pinch' recipes that delivers a lot of flavor for a really minimal effort.  Toss a green salad while this is cooking and you have dinner in 20 minutes.

This was extremely tasty, considering how easy it was. I'm giving it five stars because of this. My whole family loved, loved, loved it. I used smoked brats for the sausage, and only measured the ingredients by "eyeballing" rather than being super careful, indicating how flexible the recipe is. Thank you soooooo much for sharing this recipe!

Whole family LOVED it!!  I used a medium salsa and Tyson's ready-grilled chicken strips.  Also, turkey sausage for less fat.  Super easy and made a TON!!  Looking forward to leftovers for lunch!!

Not really in anyway traditional paella or very reminiscent of the flavor of paella. It was good, quick, and easy but the flavor profile wasnâ€™t really there.

This recipe was delicious.  I am only giving it 4 stars because I made some modifications in order to cook it correctly and get that great flavor.  First, the recipe calls for long grain rice which can take 45-60 minutes to cook, not the 15 min indicated in the recipe.  Luckily my company was running 30 min late so I was able to let it simmer longer.  Also I made a paella dry spice mix of tumeric, saffron, paprika, garlic, onion, cayenne and mixed Mediterranean herbs and added that while coating the rice in the oil.  Finally, I felt the dish needed some brightness so I added fresh parsley and some lemon juice just before serving. Even with the modifications the recipe was simple and easy to cook.  It came out perfect.

I had to add more liquid because the rice was  not fully cooked. Another 2 1/2 cups of broth took care of that.

This was the first paella I've ever made and it was such a fun recipe! My dad loves spice and my boyfriend is a carnivore so everyone was pleased with the dish. We all went back for seconds (Dad went for thirds)

I used hot and spicy Italian Sausage because I don't care for kielbasa. I pretty much followed the recipe after that and we liked it a lot.  It is easy to make and very flavorful.
