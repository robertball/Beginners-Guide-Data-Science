This was great! I didn't have anise seeds so I used extra fennel. And used poultry seasoning instead of sage as I added this sausage to a Rice and Sausage Dressing for Christmas dinner.  I put the herbs and spices in my mortar and pestle to crush the seeds. I will make this again and try it for breakfast, but with less red pepper flakes for the kids. :)

Love this recipe.  I used all fennel seeds as well, really delicious.  The basic recipe that you posted is excellent, I did add a little marjoram, just because.  I used 1/2 tsp of the hot pepper.

We we're in the middle of making homemade sausages tonight and since my boyfriend's mom loves breakfast sausage and maple syrup that I decided to make this homemade recipe for her, I was in a rush that I didn't have the time to look further. I was surprised to see that garlic powder, onion powder and pepper was used for this recipe since it's supposed to be a sweet flavor, but I did it anyway. Hoping for the best. I made the recipe to the T and even though I added the maple syrup to it, it was basically a regular sausage patty with a very slight hint of maple. I added more syrup to it after it was cooked and it still didn't taste like a breakfast sausage. I'm sorry, I won't be making this again.

Loved the maple flavor.  Only had a pound of pork sausage, but still was able to make 12 patties.

I always tweak to my own preferences, which in this case means less salt and less pepper flake ( I do like a kick, but since I was cooking soon after blending, I added some cayenne- the pepper flake is better if you give this time to rest and then re-mix before forming and freezing or cooking), otherwise this recipe is nicely balanced between sweet and savory, which is the point of breakfast sausage. To everyone who has made comments about fennel not belonging in breakfast sausage (or anise, or garlic, or whatever) and/or not being important- you don’t get to enjoy a whole symphony of flavors in sausage if you only have a string section with one violin. People don’t create recipes to address just your preference, and neither yours nor the author’s is wrong but you don’t ding a recipe because of your misguided ideas about food and cooking. Try it, even if you think you won’t like it. You might surprise yourself. 

I didn’t have star anise on hand so I used fine ground allspice as a little substitute and reduced  it, I added paprika for color and some marjoram because I like it. Worked well.

I put in 1/3 cup of Maple Syrup. It turned out great. I think next time I'll try 1/2 cup. I also used dried Sage that I ground just before using. I thought that the amount of red pepper would be a little too much, but  I think a full tablespoon would actually be better.

Like others I didn't use the fennel or anise, just doesn't belong in a "breakfast" sausage. Next time I'll double the syrup and use half of the red pepper flakes. Pretty darn good.

I omitted the fennel and anise because I do not like the taste of them, but I made the recipe as written otherwise.  I used grade B maple syrup which gave it a very nice maple flavor. This is way better than any sausage from the store.

excellent! I love making homemade sausage and this is the best breakfast version I've found so far. I used ground Turkey instead to keep it light and substituted five spice powder because I didn't have any anise. wow so good! ever wondered what's on those chicken wings from the Asian resturants? it's five spice my friends.

my wife and I just love this. Give it a try you won't be disappointed. The maple flavor really comes out use a high grade maple syrup if possible and will make all the difference especially from a local Farm.

I made only 1# of sausage and scaled seasonings accordingly.  My family absolutely loved it.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious recipe.  I only had 1 pound pork so I scaled  back the other ingredients and I couldn't find anise at the grocery store so I used anise extract.  I loved the combination of sweetness from the maple syrup and the heat from the red pepper flakes.  I will never buy pre made breakfast sausages again!

Made this recipe with venison and it turned out great! However, be sure to go easy on the fennel and crushed red pepper. It turned out to be pretty herby with an overpowering kick from the red pepper.
I love a strong maple flavor with venison, so I doubled the maple syrup. It cooks out of the meat and caramelizes the outside while pan frying. Delicious!

Too much fennel for me along with the garlic powder and onion powder. Found them all overpowering. If the wife doesn't like it it's gone.

I enjoyed this.  Made it as the recipe stated.  I will make this one again provided my boys like it when they try it!  It isn't a strong maple flavor but a subtle hint.

This is great! I made this with 1 lb of ground pork shoulder/butt because I think sausage needs some fat. I had to ask the butcher to grind it up. All pre-packaged ground pork I see is very lean. I scaled the recipe for 5 servings to scale it for 1 lb of pork. I used 1/3 of the fresh measurement for dried sage. I also didn't have anise, so I used more fennel + all spice to make up for it. I used a little less red pepper and salt, and I added a little marjoram (1/8 tsp for 1 lb) as recommended by some other reviewers. I have no idea if it needs it, but I won't change a thing next time! This helped make the BEST biscuits and sausage gravy along with the "Sausage Biscuits and Gravy" recipe by chrisser27 on this site. Thanks very much for the recipe.

This recipe was so sweet.  Next time I will only put half the maple syrup in it.
