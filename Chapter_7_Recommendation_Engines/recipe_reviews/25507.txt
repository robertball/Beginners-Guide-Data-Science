Sorry but this isn't even close, but then I'm very spoiled having a White Castles within a mile from my house. But I was curious when I saw the recipe. I should have known when you spelled slyders with an "i". My husband describes this meal like a Rueben sandwich without the Rueben. The sandwich is just slightly runny after nuking it. The taste is nowhere near being even slightly close. My mother-in-law made wonderful "mock slyders", but they were made from ground beef and cooked in the oven amidst tons of shredded onions. I will have to dig up her old recipe and add it to this site. But I can definitely thank you because this recipe has now put my worst ever prepared "married" dinner in second place.

i honestly wasn't expecting an authentic "slyder" taste to this recipe, but the recipe did look  look interesting, so i gave it a go. and it did turn out really yummy! slyders they're not, but a very good little appetizer or snack. maybe the title should be changed? anyways, they were tasty, thanks peg! =)

The recipe is simple to make. It is very rich, so is best suited to cocktail-sized sandwiches rather than normal ones.

Okay, so I couldn't find plain ole corned beef in a can anywhere so I used a can of corned beef hash. This was working good for me until I added the sour cream and then everything started to curd up and stick to the skillet. The taste was alright but it wasn't very appetizing to look at. I ended up browning it as good as I could to get that crunch on it and that made a huge difference. You definitely do not need an entire jar of pickles. In fact it you chop them up as I did, it helps distribute them throughout the sandwich.
