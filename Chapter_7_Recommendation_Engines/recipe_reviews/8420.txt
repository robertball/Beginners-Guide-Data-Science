I loved this recipe! We could NOT stop eating it. I read all the reviews before making it and ran with a lot of the other reviews ideas.

I used whole wheat flour instead of regular. 
1/2 cup white sugar the rest brown.
egg whites instead of eggs
1/2 cup oil & the rest applesauce
1 cup mini chocolate chips dusted in cocoa powder 
double the cocoa powder and used dark instead of regular.
added 1 cup low fat sour cream
a little bit more than 2 cups zucchini
and omitted the cinnamon.


I made 1 loaf 6 muffins and 1 square pan  the kids kept asking for more "cupcakes" and were just going for them I froze the loaf and take slices out they are the best!

The mini chocolate chips are perfect not too chocolatey so good I love this recipe!

This was absolutely delicious. You could see the zucchini, but it didn't bother us. I didn't know what sour milk was, so in case someone else is wondering too, you just mix 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar with enough milk to make the 1/2 cup and let it sit for 5 min.

My mom has been making this one for years. Same recipe with the addition of 1/2 tsp ground cloves, and grated zucchini instead of diced. I stopped by her house the other day and she was baking 7 (yes, 7!) of these to put in the freezer. They freeze great. You can dress it up a little by sprinkling on some powdered sugar after thawing. A definite winner!

Excellent recipe-very moist. It only took about 30 minutes for the cake to bake to completion, so I think 45 minutes is a little too long (it could have been my oven).  I also made a powdered sugar glaze with a little cinnamon in it to drizzle on top.  Thanks!!

My mom used to make a wonderful chocolate zucchini cake when I was a kid.  Unfortunately, she lost the recipe.  I believe I just found it here!  Absolutely delicious!!  Brings back memories!

Delicious, a nice, moist, chocolatey cake. I grate my zucchini instead of chopping it and I also put half the choclate chips into the batter because I like the extra texture in the cake.  If you have picky eaters, noone needs to know there's zucchini in this cake.

Very good with a few changes. First off, I knew 1/4 cup cocoa would not be chocolatey enough, so I upped it to 1/2 cup  (I would use a couple of tablespoons more next time.) I added the chocolate chips to the flour mixture, shredded the zucchini, used a little less sugar, used unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and baked it for about 45 minutes in a bundt pan. Very moist! I didn't care for the cinnamon in here, so will leave it out next time!

Great recipe my grandmother used to make this and it is a great way to used up all of that extra zucchuni. I doubled the cocoa next time I think I will add even more to make it extra chocolatey.  I also cook it in a bundt pan which makes it look really nice.  Silicone bakewear.  It makes it almost crunchy on the edge and fudgy on the inside.  I didn't give it a five because I altered the recipe.

Oh my goodness, this is heavenly. I have an abundance of zucchini in my garden, so am always searching for good zucchini recipes. This one is outstanding along with a nice buttercream frosting.  Went out on a limb and reduced the sugar in this cake by 1/2 cup, and I completely replaced the vegetable oil with applesauce -- all with fantastic results.  I used sour cream in lieu of sour milk.  Added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter, and sprinkled about 3/4 cup on top.  (Definitely squeeze the water out of your zucchini, as other reviewers have said.)  Give this a try!

Oh, this cake was wonderful!  Moist, and not too sweet.  A great recipe!  I fixed for a co-workers birthday celebration, and everybody loved it.  Next time I might do a light coating of cream cheese frosting.

This is the first cake I've made "from scratch" in years... A neighbor gave me some zuchini, as he had last year. I was unsure what to do with it, since I've got picky eaters. Last year, I'd made zuchini bread, which was awesome, but only DH and I ate it. Decided to try this recipe, and it was a huge hit! I sort of shredded the zuchini in my Magic Bullet, so nobody would see it. Also, I used baker's chocolate instead of chocolate chips, stirring them in rather than sprinkling on top. Lastly, I mixed up a chocolate powdered sugar glaze to drizzle on top. We'll make this again and again!

Very moist but not too chocolatey.  Diced the zucchini and added more chocolate chips on the top instead of the nuts.

This recipe is really good.  My husband does not eat zucchini at all and I told him it was a "Chocolate Cake".  He finished it is 2 days!!!!  I shredded the zucchini, mixed the chocolate chips in and it did take 60 minutes to cook.  I will definately be making this cake again - another way to get veggies into my husband!!!!

I made this for a BBQ and everyone who tried it liked it and they were surprised that there was zucchini in it.  I shredded the zucchini as others had suggested and I used mini-chocolate chips in the batter instead of putting them on top.  To reduce the fat content and up the nutritional value of this cake even more, I substituted applesauce for both the vegetable oil and the butter but I found the texture a bit chewy (as opposed to cake-like) so I am not sure that I would do that part again. I think that next time I will substitute the applesauce just for the oil to see what happens.  I used buttermilk in place of the sour milk. I will likely double the cocoa next time as well so that it tastes more chocolate-y. I baked it in a glass pan for 40 minutes and it was baked completely in that time.

I love this recipe! I bake for a diabetic family member, so I adapted it to make it low-carb. It turned out great, even with the changes. I used Splenda granular in place of sugar, switched out 1 1/4 cup flour with 1 1/4 cup almond meal (or flaxseed meal or a blend of the two), increased baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp., and decreased choc. chips to 1/2 cup, but added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, both mixed into the batter. I used a 9x9 in. pan, as the amount of batter is always less with Splenda, and baked for 25-30 min. The original recipe is delicious, and still quite tasty with the low-carb revisions. Plus, my family loves it. Thanks Sandi, for sharing this recipe!

This cake was so moist and yummy.  My family really liked it.  I substitued 1/2 of the butter and 1/2 of the oil with applesauce and added the chocolate chips into the batter.  I also frosted mine with chocolate frosting.  It was a hit!

I used 3 cups grated zucchini, regular milk, and mixed 1 1/2 c chocolate chips into the mix and frosted these with chocolate frosting, for a triple chocolate delight.  Sadly, I was out of pecans.  This is a very moist cake.

I would prefer more chocolate flavor. It doesn't taste very good in the areas without the chocolate chips. Add more chips and it's pretty good!

Very good!  I shredded the zucchini with my food processor, so there was no 'chunks' of zucchini.  I forgot that I ran out of vanilla, so I actually used maple syrup instead - the real stuff.  The kids wanted the chips stirred in and not on top, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  Great way to use up some zucchini and satisfy my sweet tooth at the same time.  :)

WONDERFUL CAKE! I made with 1 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3 ounces of bitter sweet chocolate shaved and folded into the batter. I also made a butter cream vanilla icing, which was perfect.  Moist and delicious. The 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon is perfect. Thanks for sharing .

Excellent version of a recipe I'd tried in the past.  I took this to a picnic in slices from a bundt pan and it was gone within minutes!!!  Extremely moist and the zucchini was well hidden from the watchful eye of my kids!!!

I can't believe it--I ahve been using this recipe for years but couldn't find it and HERE IT IS!!  THE BEST chocolate cake EVER-mine is only slighlty different --I also add 1/4 tsp cloves and zest of half an orange (I usually make two cakes at a time).  You don't need to look further for any chocolate cake.

I always make a recipe for the first time as written.  And this cake gets 5 stars as written!!  It was delicious.  However, I'm always looking for ways to make a dessert on the "healthier" side so I added a few changes.  First I used 2/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce (I tried the 1/2 & 1/2 and it made the cake to dry).  Then I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  The third change I made was to use 1/2 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  These changes did not change the texture or the flavor of the cake (a tiny bit less sweet, which we preferred).  I then took the suggestion of a few other reviewers and drizzled with a cocoa cinnamon glaze.  I've made 4 this way in the last 2 weeks both family and coworkers gobbled them up with nary a crumb left over.

Made this exactly as written.  It is very moist and delicious!  My only problem was I didn't quite have a full cup of chocolate chips for the top - but it was great with just that as a topping instead of frosting.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe.

I used to make a chocolate zucchini cake that was pretty good, but nothing compared to this delicious, chocolaty cake!

Wonderful!  Moist and delicious but not too sweet.  I used milk chocolate chips on the top and sprinkled chopped pecans on top as well.  The chips melt into the cake.  Can sprinkle with powdered sugar if you like before serving.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was made and baked into three smaller contrainers, as they were going to different people.  The cake was devoured by everyone that received a pan of it.  They could not believe that something with zucchini could taste so good, and one party that received some, that won't touch vegetables, didn't know it contained zucchini :)    I just made it it yesterday...all is gone, so I'll bake another batch tomorrow for them all...

I added chopped walnuts and doubled the cocoa.  Perfect!  Exept it took 60 minutes before the toothpick came out clean, but I think it's because I used one of those metal insulated pans.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Bf told me his grandmother used to make a chocolate zucchini cake.  I showed him the recipe search results and he picked this one.  I finally made it today and he LOVES it.  He's already eaten 3 huge pieces.  I was lazy and chopped the zucchini in the food processor.  I'm a bit weird about cakes:  I don't like sheet cakes unless they are decorated, so I opted for using a bundt pan.  Either it's my oven, the fact that I used a bundt pan, or there was too much zucchini (any of those are possible!), but I had to bake an extra fifteen minutes.  Bc I used a bundt pan, I layered the chocolate chips instead of putting them all on top.  Worked out well.  Thanks for the recipe!

My kids LOVE this cake, especially for their birthdays! I found a low-fat version where you swap out the butter for low-fat mayo and use canola oil instead of vegatable. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup semisweet chips & 2 tbls. finley chopped pecans, then bake. Awesome!

Great recipe! Turns out very moist but crumbly. I used crushed chocolate squares instead of chocolate chips and baked it in 2 loaf pans as another user has suggested - good idea.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. Everyone loved the cake. I'll make this in the future, with possibly a couple of amendments: I'll shred the zucchini, instead of finely chopping it. I think that it's a lot easier to shred it, and it would then be less noticeable, too. I'm kind of up in the air on nuts and frosting - it could be good with a cream cheese frosting, but it was fine without, too. The cake is very moist.

Have made this recipe before and my family loves it ... so moist and tasty!  Didn't have buttermilk, but making the sour milk was so easy, it wasn't a problem!  I, too, grated the zucchini, rather than chopping it .... just an over all great recipe!

Have made this several times. shredded zucchini works the best, the batter is more uniform and bakes more evenly and the moisture is even throughout. This is one of our favorite late summer desserts.

This cake was very simple to make.  I used buttermilk and shredded the zucchini.  It was chocolatey, moist, and had a crunchy top with a hint of cinnamon.  I liked it without frosting...it would go great with ice cream!

My mom recommended this recipe. We shredded the zucchini. We also added slivered almonds on top along with the chocolate chips. The recipe is a fast easy keeper! I brought it in to work and ended up forwarding the recipe to a couple people.

I really thought this cake was exceptionally good. Nice and moist, but not wet. I also really liked just putting the chocolate chips on top so no need for frosting! It's ready to eat straight out of the oven!I have made this twice already with my garden zucchini and this recipe will be added to my keepers.

If you could see the look on my husband's face when he tried this, you would know why I gave it 5 stars! Very, very good. I threw in a little extra zucchini and I would probably blend in the chips next time but it's a chocolate lovers dream plus the bonus of veggies (which you would never know were there)! YUMMMMM!!!

This is really an excellent recipe.  The only change I made was replacing the butter with apple sauce and also grating the zucchini.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

This is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe.  Makes great cupcakes if you don't bake them as long. I used only a cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet for us.  I grated the Zucchini and used half whole wheat.

This is just like what my mom used to make.  Moist and chocolate-ty.  I add the chocolate chips into my batter (stir them in with the zucchini).  YUMMY!!!  Eat fast (or freeze) because it will spoil rather fast due to the moisture.

This cake turned out beautifully.  Dicing the zucchini instead of grating kept it from getting mushy.  Baking for 35 minutes was just enough time.  I chopped semi-sweet baking squares for the topping and it melted right into the cake.

This was a nice looking cake but I would never make it for guests.  The zucchini shows up in the middle of the cake and your guests might be wondering about your cooking skills.  If you want chocolate cake just make chocolate cake. If you have too much leftover zucchini just throw it out, don't hide it in this cake.

just made this yesterday and it's great! did make some changes though based on others reviews.  I used some brown instead all white like one of the main reviewers, doubled the cocoa, majority whole wheat and added some plain yogurt but I also instead of omit the cinnamon I added double and added a about half teaspoon (or more) of pumpkin spice. For some of the mini cakes I made added a ganache on top. Next time to make it just a bit healthy I would have used some applesauce instead of oil (and more zucchini) but I did substitute one egg for soaked flax meal (mostly cause I was running out of egg).

I agree with those that said it just doesn't have enough chocolate flavor and I even added extra chocolate chips. Not very sweet either, but I do have a sweet tooth. Great moist texture. I think a chocolate glaze would help.

I will definitely make this again.  I baked this in a bundt  pan.  Added half the chocolate chips to the batter and used the rest on top of the batter.  I used 2 leftover egg whites and 1 whole egg .  Instead of using fresh zucchini, I defrosted 2 cups of shredded zucchini.  That added a lot of extra liquid to the batter and I had to bake it for an extra 5 minutes.  It was really moist and my company loved it.

I guess my expectations were high. Although it is an easy cake to make, I thought the texture rather spongy. Was hoping for a fudgey texture. Not as much a chocolate flavor as I was expecting either.

As fool proof a recipe as can be! I'm a 37 year old guy who has never baked a day in his life and this turned out fantastic!! I had some zucchini left over from a friend's garden and nothing to do with it so I found this recipe and gave it a try. I didn't have sour milk so I used 1/4 cup 2% and 1/4 cup sour cream. Other than that I followed right along. I used a bundt cake pan so ot took a little longer to cook than stated. This has gotten rave reviews from everyone who has tried it.

Excellent!!
Made it with xylitol, instead of sugar and 1 1/2 c whole wheat and 1 c white flour.  Also, added some pecans.  Also, doubled the cocoa powder to 1/2 c.

GRATE/SHRED the zucchini -  Better texture.  I've been making this same recipe for 30 years and haven't found one better.  SUPER moist, not too sweet.   If your zuke is extra juicy, squeeze out some of the liquid, unless you like it almost like pudding like I do!

Made it as directed because I had no applesauce. I could taste a touch of cinnamon in the first bite which was yummy. This is a good use of the abundance of zucchini in our backyard.

Very nice, moist cake and easy to make. However, it's still chocolate cake with zucchini. If you want chocolate cake, this mostly satisfies. If you want to hide your zucchini in something yummy, this is wonderful, but you don't really get enough zucchini in any serving to allow it to "count" as healthy.

I made this for the first time yesterday and we all loved it,  The only modification I made was to put less sugar I put 3/4cup instead of the full amount indicated. Next time I will probably put just 1/2 cup of sugar. Other than that the cake is super  moist and very tasty.

I have had this recipe for many years. The only difference was instead of 1/2 tsp cinammo its 1/2 tsp salt. Best zuke cake ever for chocolate lovers.

This was an excellent cake.  I made a few changes per other reviews and my own preferences therefore the 4 star rating. Replaced the vegetable oil with coconut oil. Used raw sugar.  Added an extra 1/4 C cocoa powder and 1/2 C chocolate chips:  3/4C chips went into the batter, 3/4C  went on top. Omitted the cinnamon. Next time will substitute applesauce for the butter.

Excellent. I used a heaping 1/4 cup of Hershey's  dark cocoa.  Also increased the zucchini and chocolate chips by 1/2 cup each. I also increased the cinnamon to a Couple of teaspoons instead of just one. Result: flavorful and moist zucchini cake/brownie.

Doubled the cocoa powder (and reduced the flour by 1/4 cup), used half brown sugar and half white, also subbed some of the white flour for ww flour. Added 2 mashed bananas as I only had 1 cup of zucchini and replaced the butter for apple sauce, used Greek yoghurt instead of sour milk and added dark chocolate chips. Turned out well considering all the changes.

Really enjoyed this recipe, it produced a nice moist cake. I left out the cinnamon as I am not a fan and as I didn't have any cocoa powder I substituted it with the same volume of melted chocolate chip (which probably helped to keep it moist). I will definitely be making this again!

I used sour cream instead of sour milk and baked this for 45 minutes at 325 degrees in a bundt pan.  I also upped the chocolate chips to 1.5 cups.  The taste is great, and you can't tell that there's zucchini in this.  It is highly moist, so I can see why the instructions state to bake in a 9x13 pan .

I followed the recipe except instead of using sour milk I used liquid yogurt, and instead of diced zuchinni I used cooked mashed zucchini.  That may have been a deal breaker, and why my cake was a little on the heavy side.  It tasted good, but it didn't have the moist light texture I prefer.  It came out more like chocolate zucchini bars, which is OK too! :)

This chocolate zucchini cake is heaven!  I only used about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips on the top, and I found it was plenty.  I also just used regular milk (rather than sour milk) and grated the zucchini. Next time I will try replacing the oil with applesauce.

I baked it in two loaf pans, easier to manage with just two people in the house.  I also topped the batter with a handful of mini chocolate chips.

I just made 2 of these–had a HUGE zucchini, and only shredded half of it! The house smells great! Instead of making them in a sheet pan, I made them in bundt pans and baked for 55 minutes. I left out the chocolate chips but added finely chopped pecans. Very moist and dense, the way I like a chocolate cake.

I dismissed previous reviewers opinions of lack of flavor etc and went ahead and made this cake. They were right. If not for the chocolate chips, this cake would not be recognizable as chocolate. Odd choice of cinnamon made it taste weird. It was moist, though. Would not make again.

I made this recipe hoping to give to a friend who had surgery. I split the batter into 2 8x8 dishes and baked it. It had no flavor, bland, so I tried adding frosting but still blahh. I mean I could eat it but really disapointed, not going to give it to my friend.

I made this cake tonight and found it to be nothing special.  It really lacked flavor.  If I closed my eyes I doubt I would have known it was chocolate.  The chocolate chips helped with the flavor, but they didn't even bring the flavor up enough.  Sorry - I just thought it was blah and boring.

This is AWESOME and by far the best zucchini cake.  I didn't have sour milk, so substituted sour cream instead. My son (who wouldn't touch zucchini unless bribed) ate almost the entire think.  I'll remember to keep it out of reach next time if I want to ever get a piece!  A million thanks for posting this!

Really moist and delicious.  I used soy milk (soured with vinegar) in place of dairy milk.  
The only change I'd make would be mixing the chocolate chips in, instead of sprinkling them on top.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I think it's a good recipe, but it wasn't the best cake in the world. However, to be fair, I used one large zucchini and one light green Mexican squash that resembles zucchini. In cooking, these are interchangeable in my book, but this might not be the case for baking. I was able to taste zucchini/squash throughout the cake and it was kind of weird. The rest of the cake was delicious, but the unmistakeable taste of vegetables wasn't the best thing. I will try this one more time using zucchini only because the reviews are mostly positive. For now, I'm attributing the strange taste to using the other squash, therefore I'm giving this 4 stars.

We all loved it.  I had to substitute unsweetened baking chocolate (2 blocks)because I didn't have the unsw.cocoa powder. I kind of guessed at how much to use and it gave a very nice chocolate flavor. I melted it in the oil and then completed the recipe as follows.  I also stirred in some chocolate chips as well as putting them on top.  I will definitely make it again!

This recipe was wonderful.  My son who will not go near a vegetable let alone eat one, ate the whole thing himself.  It was very moist and delicious.  I'm just not sure about the chocolate chips on the top.  They didn't go into the cake and they didn't melt very well on top.  But still a fabulous cake.  Thanks!
