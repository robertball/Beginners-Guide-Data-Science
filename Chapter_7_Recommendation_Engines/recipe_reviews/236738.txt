Fabulous!  I added 1/2 C. of very finely chopped walnuts to the batter.  The cake came out exactly like my mom's old recipe from the 70s, which used a much larger box of cake mix.  Thanks very much for the recipe.

This is almost the exact recipe of the cake I used to request for my birthday when I was growing up!  I just made it for a dinner party, and my kids loved it, too!  My version adds 1/2 cup chopped nuts (we always used walnuts, but pistachios, almonds or pecans would be good.)  This time I decided to forgo the DreamWhip and made my own whipped cream mixed with pistachio pudding for the frosting.  It turned out great and I'll make that substitution from now on.  My handwritten recipe is looking a little grungy, so I'm glad to have it here, as well!  Thank you!

Delicious moist cake  I added finely chopped maraschino cherries, and a tsp of almond extract, and omitted the frosting , but added a powder sugar drizzle .Wonderful!! I also tried it with Lemon cake, lemon pudding  a TBS of lemon juice , and some lemon zest.Even better than the pistachio in my opinion . Excellent recipe that you can substitute flavors and still get a moist devious cake .

I LOVED how moist this cake is. I used coconut oil because I was out of vegetable oil. I also used a cream cheese frosting only because it's my favorite icing. Amazing and easy recipe! Thank you!
