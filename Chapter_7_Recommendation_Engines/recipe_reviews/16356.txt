Being that I have lived in the Finger Lakes region of NY for 29 years (minus one year in Savannah, GA), I really WANTED to like this.
HOWEVER, it tastes NOTHING like the "famous bbq sauce" that the Finger Lakes is known for. This is missing many spices and came across very, very bland. My family and I were very disappointed.

The chicken really didn't have much flavor.  I was disappointed.

Tasty and very moist. The vinegar adds a nice tang to the chicken. I do think it needed a bit more seasoning to it so next time I'll add a little  red pepper or something.

Tastes almost just like spiedies, but so much easier.  Cut the chicken into pieces and wrap in buttered Italian bread for a great taste!
