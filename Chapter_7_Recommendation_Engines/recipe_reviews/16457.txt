Even my picky roommates love this one!  It's easy to substitute a variety of veggies to please whatever crowd.  If I don't have time for roasting the veggies or don't want to heat up the kitchen by using the oven, it's easy to chop the veggies and throw them in a frying pan with some olive oil.  I use a bit of cumin and some chili powder for seasoning and it comes out great!

Good starting recipe!  All five in our family loved it.  We used lavash bread (flat bread) b/c that's what we had on hand, and I made it as a casserole - super easy and good!  We are vegetarian - almost vegan(dh has high cholesterol)- and haven't been able to enjoy a casserole type dish for several years now.  This is a great way to get that creamy, cheesy type taste without all the fat that you usually find with cream soups and lots of cheese.  Homemade enchilada sauce is easy to make and I think it added lots of good flavor that would have be lacking with store bought.  We'll definitely make this again, however we will add some seasoning to the veggies - taco seasoning perhaps, or just salt, pepper, cumin like others have suggested.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

This was very good! It should be called a Mexican knish. I used 2 leeks, 1 red pepper, 1 green pepper and 3 large cloves of garlic, because my kids don't like the ones named in the recipe. You could use any veggies that you like. I'm glad I read the reviews, because blandness would of been a problem if I didn't add cayenne pepper, chili powder and cumin, along with the salt and pepper stated in the recipe. I sprinkled these seasonings on the veggies before roasting them. I used homemade mashed potatoes. Also, this recipe calls for 8 oz. shredded cheddar, but that is only enough cheese for 8 enchiladas. I would use 12 to 16 oz. of shredded cheddar. There is a lot of prep and mess when making this recipe but it is surely worth it!

This is awesome!  I've had potato enchiladas at Mexican restaurants but was always afraid to try them at home.  I used less veggies and mashed potatoes than called for, omitted carrot (had none), added onion and green pepper (roasted).  Also added cumin to veggies before roasting (I mess with every recipe I get my hands on - It's nothing personal).  Hubby loved it, as well.  VERY good with refried beans, sour cream & Chi Chi's salsa (my fave).  THANK YOU for sharing this!!

Good.  I followed the recipe except I made fresh mashed potatoes instead of instant, blanched the carrots for a couple minutes before roasting so they veg would get done quicker, and made it a casserole.  I think it needs more mexican spices because the enchilada sauce we used didn't do the trick.  I'd add some taco seasoning to the mashed potatoes and maybe some cumin and chili powder to the roasted veg next time.

Wonderful - even picky husband ate (& went back for seconds!)  I cut and roasted veggies the night before to save time making dinner (we get home late and have 2 small ones - I often do food prep after they go to bed).  Also - made into layered casserole instead of individual servings - also to save time.

Yum-Yum.  This is a nice change from my regular cheese enchiladas.  I included broccoli, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, onions and red peppers.  I also used homemade mashed potatoes.  I seasoned the veggies with salt, pepper, garlic powder and cumin.  I will make this one again. (smile)

My husband and I thought this was really good - a great mix of flavors.  I used leftover mashed potatoes and stir fried the other veggies to save time, so they were ready for the oven in 20 minutes - pretty quick!.  Next time I'll roast the veggies because that will probably add more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW WOW WOW!  Were these ever good!  I took the advise of other reviewers and sprinkled an envelope of taco seasoning on my veggies before roasting.  My husband was eating them hot out of the oven.  I also added chunked onion and whole garlic cloves to the veggies.  I might add a can of green chilies or a poblano chili next time for some added heat.  But this was a FANTASTIC dinner.

Absolutely delicious!!!  Substituted the mashed potatoes with quinoa.  That way you get the protein since quinoa is loaded with protein.  I think the texture is also better with the quinoa.  Also make sure you make enough sauce to smother the enchiladas and add a little sauce to the filling.

I served this with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce on the side (spicy and good!)and everything was delicious.  I also made the Sangria! Sangria! recipe.  Honestly, enchiladas are always a lot of effort but these were worth it.  Tip:  Make sure they're room temp when putting them in the oven and cover them with tented tinfoil when baking to keep them from drying out.  Yum.

This dish is GREAT! I read a lot of the reviews and decided to make a few modifications: I used a package of taco seasoning as I stir-fried the veggies: onions, garlic, mushrooms, red pepper, yellow pepper.  I roasted the carrots and broccoli and folded that into the stir-fry.  I then poured some enchilada sauce in to moisten.  I layered the potato/veggie mixture with tortillas and cheese in a casserole dish. Poured the rest of the sauce on the top and sprinkled with cheese.  Fabulous!!!! A great way to "sneak" in a LOT of vegetables.  And the mushrooms are the perfect meat substitute.  This goes into the rotation! (Next time, I will try to reduce the fat).

My husband just adores enchiladas.  I've been trying to skip the meat and up the vegetables once or twice a week.  This was the recipe we chose, and I was not disappointed.  Husband has me figured out with the no meat and uber veggie recipes, and actually stated "I know, there's no meat, don't bother telling me, it's so good I don't care".  Honestly, one of the best vegetarian recipes I've tried thus far.  I do prefer chicken enchiladas, but this is a very close second, and healthier.  Definitely will make again.  Additionally, these came out prettier than a standard batch of enchiladas.

I just want you to know that this recipe is FANTASTIC! and versatile, and a great one to make when you have a mixed group of vegetarians and carnivores.  You can follow the recipe exactly and it WILL be yummy, or you can substitute almost anything for almost anything else.  

The last time I made this I didn't have mashed potatoes or zucchini.  You can just use 2 tbs grated cheese in place of the mashed potatoes and it will still hold together okay, not as well, but okay.  I used broccoli, carrots, and green peppers and was sure to put plenty of enchilada sauce and cheese over the top.  EVERYONE (all six from age 12 to 46) in the family loved it!

This recipe is fantastic! I truly recommend it! We made a 1/2 recipe, and it made 6 very large tortillas! We didn't have enchilada cause, so I put a jar of salsa through the blender to smooth it, and used it exactly as the enchilada sauce - tasted great!!!!!

This recipe turned out pretty good... I'd make it again, but the only downside is that it kind of takes a long time to make and uses a lot of pots and pans. The cleanup and prep are kind of high for this one, though it turn's out good, not amazing though.

I used this more for the idea of mashed potatoes in an enchilada than for the recipe itself. I had leftover mashed potatoes, and I decided to pan-brown my veg instead of roasting, and I used items I had on hand rather than the items called for in the recipe. The method was good and the result was what I wanted. 

I rate this 4 stars because of the mashed potato flakes rather than real mashed potatoes, but the rest would be quite yummy. I used the ten minute enchilada recipe from this site, which worked out beautifully.

This was yummy! I estimated on the mashed potatoes and maybe overdid it because it was heavy on the mashed potatoes, I thought. But it was delicious. Don't skip the extra sauce on top. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe came out really good.  I used "real" mashed potatoes, only because I like them kinda lumpy.  I served it to my guests with some spanish rice and red wine.  What a hit!

Okay, I just can't give enchiladas filled with mashed potatoes a 5 star rating; but for a wacky throw-together dish this was a family pleaser.  SHORT CUTS to save time and clean up:  I used fresh carrot shreds, 1 head of fresh broccoli, a mix of frozen zucchini and onions, and frozen mushrooms.  I also bought ready-made, micowavable mashed potatoes.  I put all the veggies, olive oil, salt and pepper in a lg. ziplock bag and gave them the "shake and bake" treatment.  Then I BROILED them for about 15 min., turning halfway through (cut cooking time in half).  While they were cooking I headed the tortillas in a microwave tortilla warmer for a min. and the mashed potatoes in the microwave for three min. I added a can of chopped green chiles and a small can of chopped olives.  Once the veggies were heated through and the broccoli started to get a little brown on the tips (don't burn it), I set up a quick assembly line.  Put about 1/3 of can of sauce on the bottom of a microwave (glass or pottery) 13X9 pan.  Then I spooned in a large heap of potatoes and mashed the broiled veggies into them and added a little cheese.  I rolled them (sort of, they are fat, so I put the seams on the side, more like a soft taco), and put them in the pan tight.  This made about 12 enchiladas.  I topped the whole thing with the rest of the sauce, the chiles, olives, and a layer of cheese.  Cover and heat in the microwave for 6 min. until the cheese is melted.  Serve right away.

Used real mashed potatoes & homemade enchilada sauce. Time consuming but delicious. Made as a casserole (didn't roll tortillas).

The taste was good.  BUT, I would have liked better quantity calculations.  For example:  2 Cups broccoli florets vs 1 head broccoli, cut into florets.   I don't have packages of instant potato flakes so I had to guess again about how much to use from the box.  Numbers and quantities are more user friendly for me since I don't go to the store to buy the ingredients for the recipe.

Excellent dish!  I come from a mexican-american home where enchiladas make a weekly (if not more) appearance on the menu.  I love all varieties of enchiladas but this one is close to the top of the list.  Hubby says its his favorite.  I loved the use of mashed potatoes as the base instead of some can of soup like a lot of recipes call for.  I think I might even try that with my chicken enchiladas.  Do yourself a favor, though, and make the mashed potatoes from scratch.  No Flakes, No Way!!!  That is my all-time pet peeve. :)

Added some seasoning to the vegetables (garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, chili powder), made as a casserole.  Delicious!

These are really good!! What a great way to use up veggies in the fridge, you could use a great number of variations for what you have on hand. I used much less oil for roasting, but then the broccoli burned.  Next time I will take them out before the others are done roasting. Really yummy comfort food, thanks for sharing!!

I made this recipe for a private school lunch - had to be meatless.  The kids loved it and the parents raved!  I was asked for the recipe many, many times - even years later!  I used flour tortillas instead of the corn just to make each serving a little larger.

It was all right, extra cheese made it better.  I would actually consider making it again if my husband hadn't refused to eat it after just a couple bites.

I made this over the weekend for my vegetarian sister in law and it was great! I used broccoli, onions, zucchini, assorted bell peppers & mushrooms. I also made my own mashed potatoes with red potatoes and it really gave it a great taste. I thought this would be an odd combo and not be that good, but it really was great. I made some and left out the mushrooms for my husband and even he loved them. The roasted veggies alone were really tasty and I hope to find another way to use them.

This was right up my alley!!! Perfect for my skill level!!! My husband is Jewish so I have a difficult time finding recipes  on here and this was perfect for us. It is time consuming. It took me about and hour and a half but it was so worth it!! The only thing I changed was I added a half cup less water for fear that the potatoes would be too watered down!! And I added some onion powder and garlic salt to my vegetables before I roasted them. I will definitely will be making this again!!!

Sound delicious and I plan to make them for dinner next week. However, I will substitute sauteed red and green peppers, onions, and mushrooms for the other vegetables. These veggies are less bother to cook and make this dish more like mashed potato fajitas, and I love fajitas. I might even put fajita seasoning on the sauteed veggies. Thanks for posting this great meal inspiration.

For the time and effort invested, these are fantastic! I made all the veges the night before which made prep the next day super easy, although I forgot the broccoli, I will try to remember next time, I think it would be very good.

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the carrots and added an onion and some peppers. I used low-carb tortillas and made my own sauce from a different enchilada recipe (equal parts salsa and fat-free sour cream). As I was assembling the enchiladas, I realized when I got to the last one that I had forgotten to include the mashed potatoes in the filling, so I ended up just spreading them on top and then pouring the sauce over them, and they were still amazing. Will definitely be making again, and often!

Great recipe! I made my own enchilada sauce, substituted "cheddar" cauliflower for the carrots, and made mashed potatoes from scratch (not the flakes). A mix of Daiya pepper jack and mozzerella cheeses made this vegan delight!

A very heavy meal. I used the veggies I had on hand: carrots, onions, broccoli, green/red sweet peppers, half a hot pepper, and mushrooms. I made fresh mashed potatoes with garlic, milk, margarine and taco seasoning. The veggies didn't take too long in the oven since I Slap-Chopped them small. I used wheat tortillas since it is hard to find corn ones where I live, wheat are soft already and didn't need any heating in a pan to soften. The meal was well received by my family. The kids all ate 1/2 a 10 inch tortilla. It was an easy recipe and only took an hour to make, including the potatoes.

This was so good.  I made a few changes and made about 1/2 the recipe into a layered casserole, but the basic recipe is what made my dinner tonight a big hit. I used cauliflower, mushrooms, red bell pepper, and carrots. I also boiled a potato and lightly mashed it.  Roasted veggies and enchilada sauce plus cheese is a great combo!

I mostly followed the recipe but I added a pack of taco seasoning and some cumin to the veggies before I roasted them. Also I threw in three big hunks of garlic to get roasted and later mashed them with my homemade mashed potatoes (fake just don't do it for me). I wasn't able to find corn tortillas so I used flour and they came out great. This is an awesome recipe that I will definitely make again!

These were incredibly easy and delicious!  I did everything as written, except that I omitted the mushrooms.  I used an organic instant potato that had less "weird" ingredients than the traditional instant potatoes.  Husband loved them too.  This will be added to our regular rotation.  I made the during my toddler's afternoon nap and then just heated them in the oven at dinner time.  They tasted even better reheated for lunch the next day.

Quite disappointing!  I had high hopes for this dish.  The flavors/combination just didn't mesh well.  The potato/veggie filling was delicious, but was ruined with the addition of the mexican flavor components.  Would have been much better in a crepe vs. tortilla with enchilada sauce.  I was bummed that we spent the money and time on this dish.  Would never make again. :-(

I skipped the broccoli and zucchini and added black beans, pineapple salsa, & rice (I used a mix of red, brown, and wild).  I also cooked the instant mashed potatoes with just water-they turn out just fine.  The two cups of cooked rice really, really brought a "meat" texture to the party!!  My husband really thought that there was hamburger in this (recently switched to vegetarian)

I loved this, but I did make some changes.  I roasted red pepper, yellow pepper, red onion, mushrooms and zucchini seasoned with my homemade taco seasoning.  Then I used leftover garlic mashed potatoes and green enchilada sauce.  I topped it with salsa, avacado, and green onion.  This was such an easy, comforting food!  And no cheese necessary because of the creamy potatoes.  Thanks...I never would have thought of potatoes in an enchilada.

An inexpensive meal that we were sort of 'eh' about. I didn't have zucchini but did add sauteed onion. I added a can of green chilies which I do not recommend. Usually green chilies taste so good in enchiladas but it was a bad combination with the broccoli. I made mashed potatoes using 2 large russets leaving the skin on to add a little extra nutrients. I think garlic would have added a lot to this dish.

I really liked these! The only changes I made were that I halved the recipe, used homemade mashed potatoes, added some red onion to the veggie mix, and also used some monterey jack cheese aswell as the cheddar. I will definitely make these again!

Tasty, unique combination.  I made it without cheese this time, but will add some next time.  Also, the enchilada sauce is very important.  Go with a brand you know and trust.

It has a good flavor, but way too much mashed potato.  If I make it again, I will significantly reduce the amount of mashed potato.

I'm a vegetarian, but I love to throw parties for a diverse group of friends.  This was a great recipe that satisfied the health conscious as well as the "burger and beer" element.  It was nice and hearty, and  was great with a side of slow-cooked black beans for some added protein.  Rave reviews from all, and great the next day as well.

I made this one night and my non-veg boyfriend literally couldn't stop talking about them.  I used whole wheat tortillas to make them a little more healthy and they were great!

This is one of my favorite recipes! I used ready made mashed potatoes to save time. Next time I might substitute something for the zucchini because it gets soggy when roasted and I don't care for the texture. I used 2 cans of Hatch roasted garlic green enchilada sauce. Its a spicy sauce but it really complements the roasted veggies and mashed potatoes.

This is a great recipe that I make often. I add other vegetables that I have in the house,  like peppers or cauliflower. I sprinkle the veggies with Goya Adobo too, for a little extra flavor.

This makes a ton! I definitely had 12 very full burrito-sized enchiladas that I had to use two baking dishes for. However, everyone I served them to really seemed to enjoy them. I don't like mushrooms so I did two heads of broccoli instead. I also added one medium onion, coarsely chopped. I made my own mashed potatoes (used red potatoes) and made my own enchilada sauce using a recipe off of this site. These were very filling and tasty.

I roasted the vegetables the day before, so there wasn't too much to do the evening we were having these for dinner.  I especially liked the vegetable/potato mixture, but the enchiladas were good as well.  Next time I would halve the vegetables and potatoes, since less than half were used.  The enchilada sauce you use is important to how they come out (I might try homemade next time rather than canned).

It was good.  I cut my veggies a bit to small, i would leave them bigger next time.  Also added some salsa jack cheese.  I didn't think it was hard to make at all.  We freezed the remaning and it tasted better when we ate them again later in the week.

At first this recipe looked kind of hard, but my fiancee said it sounded good so I made it and it was easy and very yummy! Left-overs were good, too. (Just reheated @ 350)
This makes a lot... you have to use a dish bigger than 9X13, and each time I've made this, there is extra filling which can be saved by it's self for lunch.
I made this a few hours before company (so that I wouldn't be in the kitchen the whole time) and wraped in foil until baking.

I used the idea of this recipe, But I made it sort of like a vegetarian sheppard's pie.
I cut up 1 large zucchini then salted it in a strainer, I let it sit until alot of water came out, then I rinsed it with warm water and squeezed it tightly with my hand so all the water/salt can come out, Then I chopped carrots and mushrooms and added to the zucchini with some oil, salt, black pepper and chilli powder.
After awhile I roasted all the veggies in the microwave until they were tender, I then put a big glop of home made mashed potatoes on top, spread it out with a fork and broiled it in the oven just to get abit crispy on top!
It was really good, Me and my mom ate it, the mushrooms were so good and the zucchini wasn't full of water since I salted it, I made 1 pie plate and have a very tiny bit left (Can't wait to eat it today!!)
Thanks!

FAN-FRICKIN-TASTIC!  Both my husband & I loved these.  I've made these twice now, once with instant, once w/home made mashed potatoes.  This recipe is MUCH better if you use home made, and don't completely mash the taters (and leave the skin on!).  It adds great texture.  We eat these with a Hot & Sweet sauce & ALWAYS make double batches and freeze for a quick lunch (or snack!).

We are by no means vegetarians, but my fiance absolutely loved it.  I've made this twice when we had company and everyone raved!  Each time, I've made the mashed potatoes from scratch and used fat free cheese.  The second time, I added a small can of green chiles to the mashed potato mixture for a little extra kick.  Definitely allow yourself enough prep time, but it's worth it.

Funny how everyone was complaining when I was cooking because it didn't have meat, but everyone was fighting over the left overs.  Even my 2 year old ate it all.  I was so hesitant that they wouldn't eat this, that I made a backup dinner just incase but certainly didn't need it.  I followed the recipe exactly as described and wouldn't change a thing next time.  It took a long time to prepare the vegetables but everything else went quickly.  It would have been a breeze if I had a food processor!  I liked the mashed potatoes in it the best.  They didn't taste like enchiladas to me (they weren't dripping in grease), but they made a tasty vegetable wrap!

These enchiladas were absolutely delicious!! I will definately make them again.  I took some left-overs to work the next day and a co-worker tried it and loved them as well.  I can't wait to share this recipe with my mother who is a vegetarian.

Muy bien!  This recipe is a favorite for sure.  It goes great with either red enchilda sauce or the green chile enchilada sauce.  Used ground dried Pasilla Chiles since I could not find poblano chiles in the grocery store I was shopping at.  It worked really well though I cut down on the amount to 1-1/2 tsp.  It worked out really well.

These weren’t bad, but I doubt I’ll make them again.  The mashed potato filling is just mushier than I like.  I used different vegetables than called for, roasted them for less time at 375, and used homemade mashed potatoes and enchilada sauce, but I don’t think any of those changes affected my opinion of the texture of the dish.

I didn't plan to make any changes to this recipe beyond using garlic salt on the veggies instead of regular salt.  As I was chopping all the veggies, the pile got really large, so I left out one of the zucchinis.  The 7.6 oz of mashed potatoes made 4 cups worth!  The closest to a 12 oz package of tortillas was a package of 8 tortillas 8" diameter each.   My potato - veggie mixture must have had at least 12 cups to it... I decided there was no way to get all that in 8 tortillas, so I built a layered casserole instead.  It just barely fit in the pan.  I thought it was tasty and really liked the enchilada sauce on it.  Next time, I think I'll just leave out the tortillas since they didn't add much.  I used the same pan to roast the veggies and bake the potato mixture.

I always love a new enchilada recipe, and especially a vegetarian one. I love the idea of these, but there were some issues with the recipe and I definitely made some changes. I don't ever buy instant potatoes and I had extra sweet potatoes so I used those. Since I wasn't using a dehydrated product I didn't add the water. The sweet potatoes go really well with the veggies. I recommend adding some of the cheese right to the potatoes. As to the veggies I really hate cooked carrots so I used an orange bell pepper instead. I agree there weren't enough meixcan flavors so I cooked the veggies with garlic and onion powder. Next time I would add about 1/2 or 1 onion to the veggies. After roasting I coated them in cumin, cayenne pepper and a dash of chili powder. I think I will add them or taco seasoning prior to roasting next time. This made a ton of filling so in addition to a casserole dish I made a pie tin with some large flour tortillas I had on hand. I also used not only cheddar cheese but also a mexican cheese blend. I will totally make these again!

So good! I'll definitely be making this dish again! Next time I'll probably add more enchilada sauce and use less or completely eliminate the carrots. Love them, but not so much in this dish. Maybe I'll add onion next time instead.

Add a packet of taco seasoning along with the salt and pepper before roasting veggies.  Makes a WORLD of difference in the flavor. A friend of mine used the leftover potato/veggie mix to make calazones. :)  Also, you can use a bag of thawed broccoli florets to cut down on time.

Delicious!  Made this with homemade mashed potatoes and a taco cheese blend. I also sprinkled taco seasoning over the veggies before roasting and put the carrots in for about 15 mins before adding the other veggies.  Will definitely be making this again.

Super delicious! I used fresh garlic mashed potatoes, as I am a scratch made kinda woman. I used roasted zucchini, broccoli, onions, and mushrooms in them and they turned out great. I actually had much leftover filling, so the next day I made enchilada pie. It works really well with just two tortillas, a packet of sauce, and the leftover filling. To this I also added black olives and Daiya mozzarella cheese. Totally vegan, totally yummy.

My husband and I both loved this. The mashed potatoes give it the feeling of something really sinfully unhealthy, but it's also more satisfying than something full of cheese and cream that will probably make you feel queasy later. These were nice and filling, too, and as many have said, easy to alter to whatever you have.

I just used the veggies we had on hand and since there are just the two of us, I just used an envelope of mashed potatoes, rather than a larger package. It worked out perfectly.

I also cooked it entirely in a skillet—cooked the veggies with some spices and added some chicken, then mixed it all in with the mashed potatoes and filled the tortillas, then grilled the wrapped enchiladas on the pan. I heated the enchilada sauce in a small sauce pan and spooned it over the enchiladas after they were crisped up a bit.

This was delicious.  It was my 1st attempt to make enchilada sauce.  I prefer not buying them, too processed, too much salt.  Even my father who doesn't like "new" food and is a meat and potatoes guy went back for seconds.
I just used a few shakes of sea salt instead of the measure 1/8.  I used asparagus instead of broccoli as well.
Also the Red Enchilada Sauce recipie was from this site by sal

I really enjoyed this recipe, very tasty! I made mashed potatoes instead of using the instant packaged kind (I don't think they taste nearly as good as real mashed potatoes) & I used green enchilada sauce.  Next time I want to try half with green and the other half with red enchilada sauce. I topped the enchiladas with olives and sour cream. Yummy!

Wow! The roasted vegetables have so much flaver! I wanted to make it more spicy, so I added peppers and onions and skipped the carrots. Also, I'm not big on packaged foods, so I mashed some potatoes and used the "Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce" recipe. Delicious!

I've been making this recipe for a couple months now, and it is fantastic! I'm never going back to making traditional beef or chicken enchiladas. You can sub a variety of veggies depending on what's in season, or to suit your palate. The only thing I do differently is make the potatoes from scratch and add a little melted butter with garlic and a touch of milk to them. It makes them a little creamer. Plus I love garlic :)

My whole family loved this dish, including a very picky 4 year old boy who scarfed it down. Ok, ketchup was used to help. I followed the directions except used flour tortillas and didn't do the warming them in the pan thing and they still came out awesome. Were even better the next day as leftovers! Will make again for sure!

Best eaten the day you make them.  I was looking for a vegetarian main dish that my family would like.  I liked them... the rest of the family did not.  The leftovers weren't nearly as good after re-heating.

Delicious! I used green chile sauce instead of red, homemade mashed potatoes, and I made a cheese sauce with: plain yogurt, cream cheese, butter & rice milk instead of cheddar. It was really good! I like the technique for the tortilla's- dipping them in the sauce make them more pliable.

Very delish, healthy, vegetarian meal.  I would definitely make your own enchilada sauce (I used the store brand- and it wasn't very good) Even with the enchilada sauce mishap- was very good- will be even better next time with the homemade stuff.

This was OK.  If I were to make it again I'd want it to be less heavy on mashed potatoes, and I'd leave room for a lot more cheese in each enchilada.

This recipe has the potential to be wonderful, but I had a few issues with it.  The mashed potatoes are completely overwhelming and the delicious roasted veggies get lost in them.  I would recommend skipping the mashed potatoes altogether, or just spreading a VERY thing layer on each tortilla and then a nice big layer of veggies before rolling them up.  Great concept though!

Very tasty and flavorful, as is anything with roasted veggies.  I did not feel like going to the trouble of rolling up enchiladas, so I made enchilada lasagna out of this, layer the tortillas with filling, cheese, and sauce alternately.  Worked great and tasted great, easier and didn't have to dirty a skillet!

A really good stick to your ribs kind of meal that's healthier with the addition of all the veggies!I was thrown off by the small amount of potato flakes called for (barely a cups worth) and figured out quickly that I needed to add double to triple that amount to equal the liquid ingredients for the mashed potatoes.  Maybe it's just a typo.

This recipe taste ok, but I don't think the taste was worth the effort.  It was kind of bland for my taste and could have certainly used some more spice and seasoning.  Again, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the work.

Mine ended up being too dry, I even used an extra cup or so of enchilada sauce.  The filling was very good but a little bland.  Maybe a can of green chilis and some of the sauce mixed in would have helped.  Pepperjack would have been a good cheese to use.  I did substitute red and green pepper for the carots.  I also didn't like the corn tortillas I used the flavor was a little overpowering, I'll try again with flour.

I made these for a couple who just had a baby as an easy casserole dish for them to throw in the oven.

While I didn't taste it, they said they loved it and it was the perfect comfort food they needed!

I made this on the weekend.  It took a lot longer than suggested for me to prepare for some reason BUT it was awesome.  The first night everyone had two at supper and whatever was left was gone in a couple of days.  I'm sensitive to the spice of the enchilada sauce.  Sour cream helped me.  My husband and son loved it as it was, probably could have stood more spicy stuff but it was something we all could enjoy as is and great that it was healthy!

Too much potato, and very salty.
I gave it a three, because I asked my family to vote on it too.  May make it again, but would definitely make some changes.  Instead of boxed mashed potatoes, I will make my own.  I will use
other vegetables, like peppers and onions.

The enchiladas looked and smelled amazing, but the taste was not as good as I expected. They have a strong vegetable flavor because of the choice of ingredients. It might be better with roasted peppers, corn, beans, etc. and go with a traditional mix. That said, I still gave this recipe a 4 star rating because when I topped it with jalapeños, shredded lettuce, and salsa - I did enjoy it.

EXCELLENT.  My sweetie is a vegetarian and I am not, however, I cook our meals for the week on Sunday and I am always looking for great meals for us both to eat.  This was easily our favorite meal of the week...we LOVED it. We argued over who got to take the majority of the leftovers.

I used the veggies I had at home (leeks, green peppers, mushrooms, onions, sunchokes and broccoli) and I used fresh potatoes but the recipe was a good base and my vegetarian husband really enjoyed them. Nice.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  It turned out GREAT!  My toddlers and my husband ate these like crazy.  I used real mashed potatoes instead of instant (much better!), and I put some monterrey jack cheese in with the cheddar cheese, and sliced regular mushrooms instead of button ones.  Tasted wonderful.

Great recipe--we are a family of four, and one recipe lasted us for two dinners and my lunch!  Highly reccommended.

I cooked this for one of my personal chef clients. It was rather bland. Had a funny texture. For vegetarians, this might be your recipe. Kind of messy.

It was good, definitely not a quick meal.  You could do shortcuts, such as getting frozen vegetables instead of fresh. We didn't like it the first night, but had loads of left overs, so I added more cheese the second night and also added sour cream..........Now it won the family's approval!  Would make again, but, will take shortcuts, get mild enchilada sauce and sour cream for sure!

My older brother and his friends liked it, i still have to wait and see if my parents like it, but It's a GREAT recipe. next time i'll leave out the mushrooms i don't really like them.

This recipe was simple and easy.  I used flour tortillas instead of flour and they turned out great.  I had a lot of the veggie mixture left over and I used it in my omlettes the next morning.  I will definately make this again.

This was very good There is absolutly no excuse to not use REAL potato's for it takes max 20 minutes for them to cook till they are mashable,  I used real potato, asparagus( which was much better and tastier than zuchini), boccoli & mushrooms. I ade my own enchilada sauce off of this site and it was very good & I will be making it again!!!!

Yum Yum!  I love this recipe! It is quick, nutritious, and absolutely delicious.  I added a clove of garlic(minced) to the potatoes, and I used three medium sized potatoes (instead of the instant). My 3 year old son loved it too.

I made the Banana Cake. Positively delicious!! I made it gluten free as my daughter and I are allergic to wheat. I substituted King Arthur Gluten Free Flour and you could not tell the difference. My family loves it and asked me to bake it again!!

We really liked these.  We weren't sure how well we would like them.  But the veggies with the mashed potatoes to keep it together was very tasty.  It is a great alternative to the meat based enchiladas that you find on the site.  We will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used the ideas of the recipe but changed a lot. I used real potatoes instead of instant and i used all left over veggies i had in my fridge. Then i made home made enchilada sauce for the first time. I used cotija cheese instead of cheddar.

Yes I used real mashed potatoes because I had some leftover from another meal. Yes I would make it again! We have three vegetarians in the family so I’m always looking for something new for them that we all would like.

I tried it out and loved this recipe. I used green enchilada sauce and added a bell pepper and a can of hot Rotel to make it spicy. Next time I may try it with homemade mashed potatoes.

Big hit for when we are not eating meat (nor dairy). Choice of sauce is very important since it is the strongest flavor. Added a little oil to the tortilla softening.

I actually only tried this because I let meat go and needed an alternative. It turned out to be friggin' delicious! I had extra mash potatoes and roasted vegetables, so I made potato pancakes (with the vegetables mixed in) the next day for dinner. Finger licking good! I added leeks to the mixture, and follows all other steps provided with recipient!

Excellent!  I omitted the mashed potatoes and used roasted onions, red peppers, mushrooms and carrots. I added chili beans for protein and used red and green enchilada sauce and lots of cheese.  I layered the ingredients for the casserol-effect. Served with slices of avocado on top.  Delish!

Yum! I absolutely adored these, but my hubs wasn't a fan. Admittedly, he is not fond of broccoli (he hates this vegetable above all others...), but in my defense, I DID give him the option of assembling his enchiladas WITHOUT it.... :) That aside, I just don't think my hubby was thrilled with the overall concept. And while I really enjoyed these, I do have a couple of suggestions for improvement. First and foremost, you MUST use HOMEMADE mashed potatoes (I just couldn't get past the processed taste of the instant ones). I think it's also IMPERATIVE that you up the amount of zucchini and carrot called for (both seemed non-existent, IMHO). Because I was only serving two people, I halved everything and used larger (corn) tortillas to compensate. I made 4 GENEROUS sized enchiladas and that was more than enough for my husband and I. Because we hate mushrooms, I left those out altogether. I used 2 small zucchini, 1 c. of carrots and a little more than half a package of pre-cut broccoli florets instead. I whipped up a batch of Bill Echols taco seasoning and added ~ 1 1/2 T of it to my veggies PRIOR to roasting. I'm soooo glad I did this! Without the additional seasoning, I'm afraid our enchiladas would have been very bland. Mexican rice, homemade guac and beer margaritas completed our meal. Thanks for sharing this unique recipe with the AR community, JUSTLETTY2! :-)

As recommended I added cumin and Chili powder to veggies, and since I do not like instant potatoes we substituted homemade mashed potatoes. Flavor seemed off and I loved nothing about it. Likely will not make again.

These are fantastic tasting and simple. My kids and husband loved them. I didn't dip the tortillas in the sauce, instead just dumped it over them before baking. You can change this up however you like, and with whatever  veggies your kids like.

I made instant mashed potatoes and should have known they would taste weird. I also expected more flavor from the roasted veggies but the end product was pretty bland and lack luster. I feel like this would be a great recipe if I had taken time to make the mashed potatoes from scratch and added more seasonings and homemade enchilada sauce but I aint' got time for that magic, y'all.

Absolutely delicious! I used a little less cheese than it called for, and seasoned the mashed potatoes with salt and pepper before adding to the vegetables. We will definitely be making this again!

Really good; we found a low salt taco sauce (couldn't find a bottled enchiladas sauce) and we'll definitely make again.

I did not enjoy this dish very much at all by itself. I had already planned to serve with Spanish rice, re-fried beans, and a nice whopping dollop of sour cream. When all these came together in one bite, it was amazing. For the rice I used remainder of roasted veggies & salsa and just heated with leftover rice.

this was awesome, it was a hit, though add taco seasoning before roasting the vegetables and instead of using mushrooms which my husband doesn't eat i substitute it with cauliflower for sure in order to improve the blandness of the taste but other than that it was very good.  this will be a part of our meal now.  thanks for sharing.

These were really good!  Though I admit that I changed things a bit . . . used zucchini & peppers for the veggies, coasted them with oil, salt, pepper, chili powder and crushed garlic before roasting.  Used the flavored oil in the mashed potatoes instead of butter (made my own potatoes) and added green onions to them.  Fried the corn tortillas before filling and used green enchilada sauce.  They were wonderful!!

I don't think I'll be making this again.  It was just an ok tasting recipe with a lot of prep work.  I was disapponted when my enchiladas turned out soggy and bland.

My husband LOATHES vegetables and said "Please make this anytime". Yay! I loved it. I confess I strayed from the recipe but only because I had already made roasted veggies and was looking for something to do with them. The vegetable mix already had potatoes in them (asparagus, red bells, onion, garlic and cauliflower, too) so I just tossed them with a bit of the homemade ench. sauce (also from this site). It really is a great meal. Thanks!

This was a great recipe! I would have never thought it would be so good except my sister told me about it. I followed the recipe exactly except for making mash potatoes from scratch. My kids loved it too and it will be put into the collection of our favorite recipes.  Thanks!

Pretty good and easy to make. Will make again, but it will be a weekend only recipe since it takes so long.  I did make it both with real mashed potatoes and the flakes.  Since you have to roasted the vegetables for the same amount of time as the potatoes take, I suggest doing this.  Also, I roasted the vegetables the night before while eating dinner.  Did make it easier to just put together and cook the next night.

One of my favorite recipes!  As a vegetarian it is great to make when non-vegetarian company comes for dinner.  I make it with real mashed potatoes which adds a little work, but it is worth it.  Thank you for this recipe.

Sounds weird but is great. My daughter is vegetarian so I am always looking for recipes that will please both my carnivore husband and my vege daughter- both loved it. I did not have any mushrooms but did have a red and green bell peppers that needed to be used so I substituted.  I also added some cumin, garlic powder and a little chili powder to the potatoes which worked out well.  The only thing is that it made about 18 enchiladas and I used the large corn tortillas- no one complained about the leftovers though.

Just as good as the first time. I added onions, red peppers, and garlic this time. Perfection. 1/8/2009 These were absolutely delicious. Next time I will add even more veggies, especially onions.

These were very delicious. I thought my husband might not like that they were veggie only, but he liked them a lot. I used spinach instead of broccoli. I used bottled taco sauce for a ranchero topping, along with cheese and cilantro.

As strange as this recipe sounds, it really is delicious. As a novice cook, I found out that the veggies do shrink a lot so even if you think you have enough veggies you might want to cut up a bit more.

This recipe tasted okay.  It was a lot simpler than I expected based on the ingredient list.  I really liked the vegetable/potato mixture by itself, but it resulted in weird flavor with the enchilada sauce. The amount of vegetable/potato mixture was double what fit in the tortillas.  I will probably not make this recipe again.

Delicious! I added a few more spices like red pepper and paprika and a litle salt and garlic and I threw in some black olives I had laying around. Otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely and the fam loved it. My bro brought some to work for lunch and his co-workers loved it too.

This was amazingly delicious and easy.  I had extra vegetables left over from a gathering and figured I'd try this before they went bad.  It was yummy.  My family loved it to.  Only thing I'd change is more veggies I like better (not a big mushroom fan).  I used butter & herb instant potatoes with the seasoning packs and lots of mexican mix cheese.  Really helped give a nice flavor.

This was unbelievable!  My fiance is a vegetarian and I'm always looking for new recipes for when I cook for her every weekend.  I substituted green chiles, red peppers, green peppers and onion for the broccoli and mushrooms and it still tasted great!  We did have quite a bit of filling left over, and I made 8 enchiladas, but stuffed them with enough filling that they were more like burritos!

This was an absolute hit.  We did have quite a bit of extra filling, this made us about 30 enchiladas and no one minded eating these for more than one meal.  Great!!!  We will definitely make these again.

This is now a family favorite.  Delicious!  I get my youngest daughter to help me roll the enchiladas, giving us some great "mother/daughter" time.  I've learned to cut back a bit on the stuffing, because I always had so much left over after filling all my enchiladas.  These taste even better reheated the day after!

DELICIOUS!!  My normally picky husband LOVED them.  Will definitely make this again and again.  Do have a nice kick to them even though I used mild sauces, that was really nice.

UBER-yummy!  Kids would have a great time helping mom or dad making this because the enchilada assembly is very messy.
