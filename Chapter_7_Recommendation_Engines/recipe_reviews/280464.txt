We add golden raisin, even though I hate them.  We chop the broccoli very fine and use toasted, chopped walnuts or pecans instead of sunflower seeds.

Very good. I made it low carb by substituting Swerve for the sugar. Flavor was still excellent. This is simple, easy to prepare and a crowd-pleaser. What leftovers?!

I’ve been making this great salad for many years. Be sure to make the dressing first, let the sugar dissolve well in the vinegar first, then mix in mayonnaise and set aside. I use at least 4 broccoli crowns, add 5-6 thinly sliced radishes, half a pkg. finely grated cheese (I like 6 cheese Italian or whatever ‘mix’ available) and pine nuts. Stir altogether with dressing and refrigerate a few hours, then fold together again just before serving. Keeps well & still great the next day.

Delicious! Even my raw broccoli disliker loved it.
