Good basic recipe that is quick and easy to prepare and can be customized to your liking. I'm not a big fan of lemon pepper except on seafood, so used fresh ground pepper instead. I used mini-bella mushrooms and a red bell pepper since that's what I had on hand, as well as yellow and red grape tomatoes. I loved the addition of the grape tomatoes. My wine was leftover chardonnay from the night before which added just enough sweetness to work nicely with the pork chops. I served with a rice pilaf that had slivered almonds in it (yum!) and sprinkled all with chopped fresh basil before serving, which added to the taste and visual appeal. Would be great with boneless chicken breasts or mild white fish like filet of sole or tilapia, though you'd have to adjust cooking time. Thank you Spencer & Serena for sharing your recipe!
