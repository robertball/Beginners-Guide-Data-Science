I cut this recipe in half and didn't find the need to use a stand mixer. I just stirred really well for several minutes. I like mixing it up ahead of time and then having it ready to go in the morning. It tasted good. My only issue is that I'm not really fond of cold oatmeal in the winter, so I heated mine in the microwave. I'll keep this in my recipe box.
