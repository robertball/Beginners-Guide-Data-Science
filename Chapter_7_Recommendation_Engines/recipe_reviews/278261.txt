Excellent! A little time-consuming to get everything together, but well worth it. Next time I might use thinly-sliced Gruyere to make things easier to roll and less messy. I think they addition of some finely diced pickles would had a nice touch too. A flavorful dinner that is totally company-worthy! I'd say this is 4 servings, not 6.
