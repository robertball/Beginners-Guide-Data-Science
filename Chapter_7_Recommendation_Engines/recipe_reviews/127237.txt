All in all this is a very rich, luscious and wonderfully satisfying cheesecake experience to be savored any time of the year.  My folks went absolutely gaga over this recipe on Christmas night ... especially when we added a nice-sized dollop of Cool Whip on each slice!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks, Baker's Chocolate!

This was very nice. I used 25% fat reduced cream cheese also used semisweet choc chips. Will make again with full fat and bakers. Will update when I use proper ingredients!
