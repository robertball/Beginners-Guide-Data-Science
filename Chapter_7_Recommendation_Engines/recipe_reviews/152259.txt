I needed to use up some pumpkin and ricotta cheese so imagine my delight to find this recipe! My pumpin was pre-cooked so I fried the onion in a pan with olive oil (instead of butter), spread it out ontop of the pumpkin and then poured the cheese mix on top and baked for 20 minutes. I had a bit less than the 3/4 cup of ricotta so used parmesan to make up the difference. It was not runny (I was worried as another poster made that comment) at all (I'd already considered trying it with bread crumbs next time but don't need to). It had a nice flavour but next time I'll cut the pumpkin pieces smaller. Mine were about 1.5" square and that was definitely too big. It looks much nicer than the picture by the way.

Very yummy savory recipe. This recipe is a keeper. I added 2 Tablespoons chopped fresh sage and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg to the egg mixture before pouring over the pumpkin. Also mixed 1 cup panko crumbs and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and sprinkled that over the top before baking. It was most delicious.

I sauted the onion and increased the salt to 1 tsp., the white pepper to 1/2 tsp., added 1/4 tsp. Rosemary, 1/2 tsp. Savory, and 1/4 c. Parmesan cheese. Yum yum!! Will make again! baked for 40 min, still somewhat watery, but just use a slotted spoon to serve.

This was a good but not great recipe. It was a nice change to use up that extra pumpkin from our garden as a side dish instead of a pumpkin dessert or soup. Both my husband and I like this but it turned out rather watery. Will probably make again.

I made this recipe as written and no one cared for it.  It was bland.  I took the left overs and mixed in garlic salt then topped with Italian bread crumbs and Parm.  It turned out GREAT!

I thought this was pretty great, but my kids were not impressed. I sauteed the onion with some garlic in the butter first, and I think this really made the dish. In fact, I will add more garlic next time. Skinning the pumpkin is a pain, and my friend who is a chef said to try cooking it right in the pumpkin halved. I may try that next time.

I expected sweet, but got savory.  I had fried the onions in the butter before adding the pumpkin. Very tasty when you get over the fact that this isn't sweet!

This was amazing- I used a pumpkin fresh from the garden so it did have a hint of sweet.  I used monterey jack and parmesan cheeses since it was what I had-- I will do the same next time.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly minus salt and pepper to taste rather than measuring it.

I made this last night and my husband could not get enough of it!  I had some herb butter on hand and gave the onions a very quick sautee in the melted butter before mixing with the pumpkin.

I took this to a pumpkin party and no one really enjoyed this, I think it needs more spices, but don't know just yet what I would do to spice this dish up some.

Great recipe. Thanks! I used red kuri instead of pumpkin, upped the butter content to 1/4C, increased salt to 1 tsp., seasoned the squash and onions with fresh rosemary and marjoram leaves, and topped it off with parmesan cheese. I think if I make it again (which I probably will) I'll cut down on the ricotta and add some gorgonzola or bleu cheese in its place -- the squash and onions were very flavorful, but the ricotta filling was a little bland for my taste. Totally worth making, though.

This was good, but the baked onion was too strong for me. If I make it again, I'll saute the onions first. I added fresh sage and rosemary, and some pecorino romano. Nice flavor and good texture, and easy to make (aside from peeling the pumpkin).

Followed the recipe (I think that should be a requirement for the first go if you want to review, quite frankly). It is a lovely option for a savory pumpkin dish. Will certainly make it again!

Subbed marscapone cheese for the ricotta just to use what I had in the house. It made for a lovely texture. Based on others' reviews I added 1/4 fresh grated Parmesan .... IMO this is absolutely essential to this dish; it made the dish.  Also added a small pinch of thyme, fresh ground pepper (I don't like white pepper) and an even sprinkle of ground garlic before adding the topping. Recipe turned out great. I don't think that it's necessary to cook the pumpkin and onion quite that long before adding the topping so there's a little more firmness to the pumpkin. I would try this again. I think sage would be nice too or Rosemary but I was out of both.
