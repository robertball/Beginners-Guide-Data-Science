If I could give this ten stars I would. I have just made this recipe with two minor additions, I added a few dashes of tobasco and as another reviewer has done I added a dash of vinegar. This is absolutely fantastic and I seriously doubt I will purchase store bought barbeque again. It is fantastic with pork, chicken and steak. Thank you for this recipe

Too much soy sauce!!  The first time I made this, I used 3/4 cup of Kikkoman's regular, and it was still overly salty (and I like salt).  I would recommend using 1/4 - 1/2 cup, tasting as you add.  Once the salty soy is reduced, this sauce is excellent, especially over meatballs as stated.

I finally got around to trying this and could kick myself that it took me so long to make this incredible sauce. Like the previous reviewer stated: This is the perfect balance of flavors. Loved how the fruitiness from the wine prevailed (used a St. Helena Zin). Great with pork tenderloin and I will try using this with frozen meatballs from Sam's Club as well. Really that good.

This recipe was absolutely awesome!  Very flavorful tasting.  Served it as a barbeque over beef and it was delicious.  This is a keeper folks!

I would have rated it a 5, but the soy sauce made it WAY too salty.  In the future, I will probably use a mix of half soy sauce, half water.  Otherwise, it was really tasty, unique, and definitely NOT your typical BBQ sauce.

Loved the flavors in this sauce.  I opted to reduce the soy to 1/2 cup and was glad I did.  I also needed to add a sprinkle more brown sugar to take away some of the saltiness from the soy. I think it's all in personal preferences but it would be a good idea to use less b/c you can always add more if you would like!  My husband loved it.  I grilled bone-in chicken ( yes, w/ skin!) for about 10 minutes and then placed in a 9 x13 &  poured the sauce over each piece and covered with foil.  I baked it at 375 until the pieces were done- approximately 25-30 minutes.   I think this would also be great over pulled pork.  A gourmet sauce!

Sauce was very tasty, but the soy sauce needs to be reduced.  It was really fruity from the wine.  I like mustard, so the amount in this recipe was fine for me, but my roommate doesnt like it so she reduced it by half the second time we made it and it turned out much more to her liking.

This is good,it's definately different than any other barbeque sauce I've ever had, but still very good. I added about 2 Tbsp vinegar b/c I like a tang. Hubby added (behind my back) 4 shakes of Tobasco. He said it could use more. He is our barbeque chef, so, I let him pick the star rating.

This one is a keeper. Intense, dramatic flavor; everyone liked it. I read the comments and added only about 2/3 the soy sauce the recipe called for. I'm glad; it could not have used any more.

Great Recipe! I followed it pretty close all though I doubled it for a party and added an entire bottle of chianti. I let it simmmer down also for a few hours then used it on chicken and put it the chix and sauce in an oven bag and 35-40 minutes later rave reviews!

This is a good base for a barbecue sauce, but I felt something was missing.  I felt myself wanting to put something in like Worcestershire sauce or horseradish or garlic or hot chili sauce.  I did have a little leftover, and I'll try adding one of those.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this today with pork tenderloin.  I thought it had the perfect balance of flavors.  This one is a keeper!
