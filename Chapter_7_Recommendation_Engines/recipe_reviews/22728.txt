I made a mistake and purchased hot fudge sauce rather than regular chocolate syrup. Though I don't know how it would have turned out using the syrup, the hot fudge sauce was a happy mistake. Very rich and smooth textured. I thinned the mixture a bit with some chocolate syrup because it was quite stiff after mixing with the peanut butter but it still wasn't easy to spread. I think the earlier reviewer's suggestion of putting the chocolate/peanut butter layer onto the ice cream sandwiches first, then the whipped topping would have made my assembly MUCH easier if I'd thought of it! Everyone loved this and it was so simple to make. The possibilities of other combinations of sauce and "sprinkly things" are endless and I am sure I'll make this again!

Quick,easy and Yummy! It looks and tastes like you slaved over this dessert. My ice cream sandwiches must have been the perfect size, because I used 19, just as the recipe called for. I used (Dove) milk chocolate topping and crunchy peanut butter. As suggested by another reviewer, I put the syrup/peanut butter mixture on the ice cream sandwiches first,(plus I drizzled some caramel topping onto that) and then spread the cool whip, it was easier to spread, and no one would be the wiser, because when sliced, it had nice layers. I probably added about 1/2 of a jar of the caramel (for both layers) and will more than likely add more (all) next time. I used chopped pecans in place of the peanuts and dusted the top with cocoa. I wanted to add toffee pieces in place of the nuts, but my stores didn't have them. I will try that though when I find them again. I passed this out to all the neighbors..thumbs up from everyone!

Yummy!  The fudge/peanut butter part was very good!  Used peanut butter cups like others suggested b/c the kids don't like nuts.  I halved this recipe and it took 11 ice cream sandwiches per 8x8 inch pan.

UNBELIEVABLE! This was so easy and very good. Thank you so much for this. Everyone that has tasted it has thought is it great. I think the secret is the peanut butter in the chocolate sauce. Yum! My only problem was finding a 9X13 dish that was deep enough to hold all the layers. Super recipe.

This was AWESOME! Quick and easy to make!! I used No Frills No Name Ice Cream bars and they were the perfect size. Used NO Frills No Name chocolate syrup. Took previous advice and layered chocolate sauce first then the whipped topping! Big hit at party! Definately make it again!

I made this for company and served it to 8 kids...they all LOVED it!!! (which is an absolute miracle because my kids are extremely picky)  I have already been asked for the recipe twice!!  The only thing I will do different next time is put the chocolate sauce on first and then the Cool Whip, as I found that it made a big mushy mess on top when I tried it the other way.  5 stars for this recipe!

This is a great and easy dessert.  I combined caramel and hot fudge together instead of chocolate syrup and peanut butter.  It was great for a summertime dessert.  Our guests and my whole family loved it!

This recipe has already become a favorite at our house.  It is a wonderful dessert if you are working with little chefs as there is no real heat involved.  I don't make any changes, other than maybe to increase the number of ice cream bar used.  It may just be the brand I use is smaller.  Really, the dessert is much more impressive than it should be since it is so simple, but even the pickiest of critics give it rave reviews at our house.

I switched out the choc. syrup for hot fudge. I mixed the hot fudge with the peanut butter without needing to heat anything. That way I didn't have to wait for any cooling before assembling the dessert. My pan had enough room for 24 ice cream sandwiches. DEFINITELY spread the chocolate mixture on before the Cool Whip. I added some caramel on top of the Cool Whip which made for a nice presentation. Since this was being served to a party with kids, I feared they wouldn't eat it with nuts. So, I used 8 crumbled Reese's cups in place of the peanuts. Next time I'll use more Reese's cups because everyone wanted a piece of the dessert with lots of the cups on it. When beginning the second layer, make sure you push down on the ice cream sandwiches to eliminate any air pockets in the dessert and to give yourself more room in the pan. I used a 9x13 cake pan, which is deeper than my 9x13 Pyrex dish, and the dessert filled it to the top. This is a super easy recipe. It's easy enough for beginning cooks and kids to make. The options for different tastes are plentiful. Well done!

Very quick and very good.
A hit with both kids and adults.  Might experiment with adding caramel?  Used chunky peanut butter and also loved the whole peanuts.

I've made this more times than I can remember! I use a big jar of HOT FUDGE (not syrup) and mix it right out of the jar with the peanut butter - I don't heat it. Ice cream bars on the bottom, then the chocolate mixture, then some nuts, then coolwhip, then repeat. Little taller than the pan. I pop it in the freezer overnight and bring it out about 20 minutes before we eat. Incredible. Tastes like a peanut buster parfait from Dairy Queen. YUMMO!!!

I made this cake as written last year and felt is was okay but nothing special, thus a 3 star rating.  I decided to try it again this summer after reading dozens of ice cream cake recipes - and incorporated some of the other recipes into this basic idea.  The new and improved version is a 4.5.   I made a home made chocolate peanut butter fudge sauce, used lots of chopped up salted dry roasted nuts (sprinkling them generously over the chocolate fudge layer) and made sure to use a deep pan to accommodate the layers adequately.  I also put a thin layer of the chocolate fudge sauce on the bottom of the pan before starting the first layer of ice cream sandwiches.  These changes improved the cake immensely in my opinion.  It feeds a lot of people - a 13x9 pan can definitely feed 15+.  You can definitely make this a week or more ahead of time, just cover very tightly in the freezer.

I did read through the many reviews and since many said this was way too rich and my family doesn't eat a lot of sweets I decided to tone down the chocolate syrup, feeling 16 ounces was quite a lot. This is what I did and it was easier than the directions. I used a metal 13 X 9 pan and lined the bottom with the ice cream sandwiches, only had to cut one in half and they fit perfectly. Then I smeared a layer of peanut butter on top of them, not very thick, then just drizzled some chocolate syrup over that, added the peanuts and then drizzled caramel syrup and then the whipped topping. Then the next layer ice cream...and so on, topping with whipped cream and chopped peanuts and drizzled caramel on top. Let if freeze for about ten hours. This was such a hit at my Mom's 75th birthday party and certainly sweet enough. I used 24 of the cheap ice cream sandwiches from Walmart (2 boxes) and they all fit perfectly. The only change I'll do next time is to make sure it freezes for at least 24 hours.

Substituted half Mrs. Richardson's Caramel Topping and Hot Fudge for peanut butter and chocolate syrup, and crushed Heath Bars for the peanuts. INCREDIBLE. The layers make for a lovely presentation when sliced. No one will believe that it was assembled with all purchased ingredients! In our house, this is called "Better Than Sex Ice Cream Cake." Wonderful summer dessert.

Fast & easy for sure.  Tasted good, like an ice cream sundae. (FYI the chocolate sauce makes it kind of messy/sticky) I took it to a kids pool party and it went over very well.  Kids loved it and parents asked for the recipe.  I used caramel topping instead of the peanut butter & added rainbow sprinkles to the top.

As other reviewers suggested, I used hot fudge sauce, heating it right in the jar in the microwave on 3 power for 15 second increments until it was easier to spread. Don't let it get too hot or it will liquify all the other ingredients in the recipe when you use it. If you accidentally let it get too hot, just stir it until it cools a bit. I spread the hot fudge sauce over the ice cream bars, then drizzled the carmel over the top with a spoon, heating the caramel the same way as the hot fudge so it would drizzle easier. I added Heath bits  over the first layer of fudge/caramel, then again over the whipped cream on the top. It was delicious and looked great, too!

This recipe is DELICIOUS!!!  Instead of the chocolate syrup and peanut butter, I used hot fudge on one layer and caramel topping on the other layer and I also used pecans.  The basic recipe was there, I just made it with my preferences.  I took it to an inside picnic and it was GONE in no time.  Like the others, this was a simple dessert and it looks like you've spent tons of time preparing it.

This was great! Made it for my daughters 13th birthday. I actually cut the ice cream sandwiches in half and put a layer of white cake in there. I too used caramel on top. It turned out GREAT!

Everyone liked it.  I made it in a large glass bowl because it didn't look like it would fit in a 9 x 13 pan.  However you combine these ingredients, they work!

I do not like this desert.  Too much chocolate, not enough ice cream for all the extras.  I spent about $15 for all ingrediants. Did not set up in 1 hour. Was all mush. Everybody said about the same concerning the chocolate. Maybe cut back on chocolate and only do 1 layer or add an extra layer of ice cream.

Awesomeeeee.... My husband, daughter, 3 sisters, and 3 brothers LOVED it and it was soooo simple. I made it for everyone for their first day of school. I added a little more peanut butter and also put the choc/peanut butter mixture on before adding the kool-whip

We've made this numerous times now and *love* it.  It's so easy, my kids usually make it in less than 10 minutes.  We always use hot fudge in place of the chocolate syrup and top it with crushed peanut butter cups.  Amazingly easy and delicious!

Do yourself a favor - make one of these and eat the whole thing by yourself!  Very easy to make, but looks like a fancy layered ice cream cake when cut.

This is absolutely heavenly!! As a different twist, i omitted the ice cream sandwiches and instead used peanut butter oreos crushed up  as a layer, then topped with softened vanilla ice cream. It was fabulous!

This dessert was super simple!  I had company coming and I made it up in about 15 minutes and everyone loved it!  If you need a peanut free version of this dessert it is also very good with caramel and chocolate topping and skor bits in the middle layer with caramel drizzled on top. My family would highly recommend this dessert!!

Super easy, rich and delicious! I halved the recipe and it still made way too much for the 6 of us to finish. I ended up cutting the leftovers into individual squares, wrapping them in foil, and freezing.

This is the best dessert I have made in a long time.  Everyone ate it up and there are a TON of leftovers!  The folks at work will be so happy!  I put the chocolate/pb layer on first then I put a thin layer of chocolate cool whip and white cool whip.  I crushed up frozen Reese's and put them on top with some rainbow sprinkles.  The one kid at the party that NEVER eats ANYTHING actually asked for 2nds!!!  Huge hit!  Thank you for this recipe...it has definitely become part of my permanent recipe box!

Wow! This is ridiculously simple and delicious. Rave reviews from all my guests.  I used Jiffy extra-crunchy peanut butter and omitted the peanuts. 24 Publix brand ice cream sandwiches fitted my pan perfectly. Make sure you use a deep lasagna pan and place it on a cookie sheet to catch any drips. STRONGLY recommend freezing over night.

This is soooo good! If you like peanut butter, do yourself a favor and do NOT make substitutions for the chocolate/peanut butter and peanuts. That's what makes this dessert awesome! I used hot fudge sauce instead of chocolate syrup. I had to thin the hot fudge/peanut butter mixture a bit with milk. I also drizzled Mrs. Richardson's caramel sauce on the top layer. Everyone scarfed it down, then asked for the recipe at my family's Easter dinner.

Yummy.  Everyone loved it.  It's very rich.  I'm not sure of the exact number of ice cream sandwiches I used but I know several more than what the recipe calls for.  The only thing was that when the second layer was added, it was too tall for my pyrex 9x13-inch pan so I couldn't add the final layer of chocolate sauce.

Very good.  Extremely easy.  It reminds me of the peanut buster parait or the buster bar at Dairy Queen.  My pan was a little bigger than the one in the recipe and took 24 ice cream sandwiches. It looks very nice on the plate.  Will definitely make this again.

This was great!  I made it in a 9 x13 Pyrex dish and had a little cool whip left over.  Everyone thought that I made the chocolate wafers from scratch then layered the whole dessert.  They couldn't believe I used ice cream sandwiches!

This is an awesome dessert! I made it, but I omitted the peanut butter and peanuts.  On the top I sprinkled marachino cherries, the chocolate sauce, butterscotch sauce & chopped walnuts.  I also served sliced bananas on the side and called it "Banana Split Dessert"!

Yum! And how easy to modify! Add mint choc chips to fudge sauce, and crushed peppermints to soft ice cream. What a neat cool and minty treat!
And of course, caramel with the chocolate nuts! Delish!

I made this for my birthday and it went over great! I used peanut butter chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches and chopped up reeces pieces instead of peanuts.  Will try this again maybe with mint ice cream bars and york mints...lots of creative ways to change it.  Very rich.

everyone freaked out over this at the party i made it for! it did take more ice cream sandwiches to fill the pan (probably about 24) and also took the advice of others and layered the fudge/pb before the whipped cream so my layers were: ice cream sandwich-pb/hot fudge-whipped cream-peanuts. i repeated this and then topped it with chopped up reeses peanut butter cups and caramel sauce. froze it overnight (which i would recommend)! wow--tasted just like a snickers bar!

I made this today for a family barbecue with all my kids and grandkids. Received rave revues, even from the non-sweet eaters. I did use crushed Heath bars instead of peanuts because my daughter can't eat nuts (but she can eat peanut butter, go figure). 2 pieces left over, and I bet they'll be gone by morning. I also used hot fudge sauce instead of chocolate sauce. Next time I won't be so lazy and I'll make my own hot fudge though.

This is amazing. I made a couple changes. I put coolwhip first on the sandwiches, then put  it in the freezer and let freeze, while I made chocolate peanut butter mixture. When mixture was blended I put it in the fridge for about 15 min, poured half mixture over the set layer of coolwhip and then added the next layer of sandwiches, topped it with coolwhip, let it set for 15 min in freezer, chopped up 15 mini reeses and put on top then drizzled the remaining chocolate mixture over that. It looked like something you pay top dollar for at Coldstone and was amazingly yummy. Must try

This dessert is AWESOME! So easy, yet people think you slaved over it. And talk about yummy! There are many variations you can use with this recipe as well. The fist time I made this I left out the peanuts (for the kids), added 1 jar of caramel to the chocolate/peanut butter mixture, and sprinkled toffee bits on top. I'm sure this would be great with peanuts, or with hot fudge sauce instead of chocolate syrup. I would caution mixing caramel and hot fudge sauce as substitutions though- it is too sweet that way. Since I love chocolate and mint together- I think I will try mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches next time- using hot fudge sauce and leaving out the peanut butter and nuts. I will mix some mint extract in the whipped topping and I will crush some candycanes or andes mints on top. Oh- and like the other reviews say- spread the chocolate layers on the sandwiches before the whipped topping layers, it's much easier that way. Yum!!! Will definately make this over and over for family/friend get-togethers.

I like the taste of hot fudge better so I used it instead of chocolate syrup.  I microwaved it for a really short time just enough to make it spreadable but not hot.  DO NOT put on the cake until cooled - it will melt your ice cream.  I also spread the chocolate mixture over the ice cream sandwiches first and then the whipped cream -much easier to spread. The peanuts are a good contrast to the sweetness.  I will make this over and over again - and it feeds a ton of people!

The recipe worked great, I added a little extra peanut butter because my friends and I love it. I made the regular recipe for them but made a lower fat version for myself using low fat ice cream sandwiches and banana slices instead of whipped topping and it too came out delicious, try it! Perhaps next time I'll use crunchy peanut butter to cut out a step.

Wow!  This was awesome!!  I used half chocolate syrup and half hot fudge to make it a little thicker, before adding the peanut butter.  I also drizzled the chocolate mixture first, then the whipped cream like others have suggested.  The only other thing I changed was using english toffee bits instead of peanuts (personal preference) and it was fantastic!!!  I couldn't believe how well the sandwiches were hidden.  No one I served it to had a clue it was made from sandwiches.  They thought I slaved!  Great Recipe!!

Thank you for the great recipe. I used it as a baseline idea for a dessert for our holiday party at work. Instead of peanut butter, I use a layer of thick caramel sauce and hot fudge instead of chocolate syrup. It's so easy to make, and everyone loves it.

amazing! Wasn't too excited about thiz one after reading the recipe, bug decided to try it anyway because of review, and boyyyyyyyy am i glad I did! I used a smaller dish, so cut all ingredients jn half. I whipped some fresh whipping cream instead of cool whip, used Hershey chocolate sauce with chunky peanut butter, and topped with chopped reeces cups. My hubby went crazy ovrr this one!

Pretty good! Very tasty. I didn't give it 5 stars because i thought there was a little too much chocolate syrup. It made it a little too sweet. Next time I will cut down on the chocolate syrup. I think  the peanut butter really made this recipe. I don't think it would taste nearly as good without it. As others have stated i also had to use more ice cream sandwiches - approx 24. You should make this in a deep pan so you don't have to smash the layers down. I will definitely make this again.

I made a smaller version of this for my sweet tooth S.O. for V-day and it was certainly a highlight! A lot more peanut buttery than I had expected and we both really loved it! In addition to crushed peanuts, I added crushed fudgeeo cookies which was a very welcome addition! Very easy and I am already planning to make again. Who doesn't love an ice cream cake??

I have made this recipe many times and always get compliments and requests for the recipe!  I make mine in a round glass bottom springform pan.  I do one layer of sandwiches (cut where needed to fit the pan), the whole tub of whipped topping and then about 3/4 or a little less of the chocolate sauce...topped with crushed peanuts.

I usually make the sauce as per the recipe and choose how much I want to use and pour the rest back in the bottle for later use on ice cream :) 

It cuts really easily out of the round pan and looks great on a plate with some caramel sauce zig zagged overtop or anything to your liking to decorate the plate!  I've pulled this off at some nice sit down dinners and had great reviews!  The wonderful thing is I always make it the day before!

This is one of my family's favorite quick desserts. It's almost like a Peanut Buster Parfait, flavor-wise. Hot fudge topping can be used instead of chocolate syrup, too.

HUGE hit in our house!  This is super easy to throw together and tastes great!  The first night my daughter tried it, she said it tasted just like a snickers bar!  The only thing I did differently was spread the chocolate/PB mix on the sandwiches first..then put the whipped cream on top of that.  It helped it to spread easier!

Do chocolate layers before whipped cream layers.  I added nuts only to top and left them off on a corner for Caroline.  Would also be good with chopped peanut butter cups.  Don't bother with caramel sauce like some reviewers recommend.  It's not necessary.

Sooooo easy to make and so darn good!  We added the chocolate layer before the whipped cream layer, and we drizzled some caramel sauce on top of the peanuts (make sure you use salted cocktail peanuts and not dry roasted).  Phenomenal recipe.

This dessert was amazing...very chocolatey and rich.  My boyfriend LOVED it.  Instead of using peanuts, I crumbled up Reese's peanut butter cups...it tasted great.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Amazing dessert! Butterfingers are definitely the way to go. I omitted the nuts and crunched up a whole bag of mini Butterfingers. I also used chocolate cool whip. I recommend making this the night before and letting it freeze together over night. It really became fudgy and cake-like. I thought it would just taste like ice cream sandwiches, but it really didn't. It is huge though. Next time I will cut the recipe in half and use a smaller pan. Although I can't complain about the leftovers, YUM!

This was very easy to prepare...and it was sweet.  Make sure that you get the "good"  ice  cream because it truly makes a difference.  I know I will make again with only one change...reduce the amount of peanut butter just a little bit.  Thanks for a delicious dessert.

Personally, I prefer desserts dripping in chocolate, but EVERYONE at the gathering I took this to requested this recipe, hence the five stars.  My best friend said it was like Dairy Queen's Peanut Buster Parfait, and she'll double the peanuts to make it more so.  I'll wait and see how that turns out.  Meanwhile, definitely a "recommend".

YUMMMMMY! This was so easy to make---and with such professional results! (Once you cut into it, the layers make it look as if you spent hours preparing it!) I "cheated" by using chunky peanut butter instead of creamy, and then omitting the cup of salted peanuts ;-) Based on other people's comments, this recipe looks as if you can create your own variations. Crushed mint Oreo cookies might be good as one of the layers (minus the peanuts/peanut butter, of course!) The possibilities are endless! Thank you, Connie!

So simple! It was a big hit at my Labor Day BBQ.  I also added some chocolate chips and mini marshmallows with the peanuts.  Adults and kids loved it.

This was excellent!  I fixed it for my Dad on Father's Day and everyone thought I slaved over it for hours.  So easy to make.  The most time-consuming part was unwrapping all those ice cream sandwiches.  I will definitely make this again.

This was such an easy and tasty recipe.
I used carmel instead of peanut butter, which was really good.
I also must of had smaller ice cream sandwiches because I fit 12 in each layer.

Delicious and easy recipe that everyone loved regardless of age!  I used Hot Fudge instead of chocolate syrup and it was great (recommend adding a little hot water to thin it down so it will spread easier).  All my friends want this recipe!

Great tasting & easy to make!  I sent this with my fiance to work and even though it's pretty rich tasting, people loved it.  I think there's a typo in the recipe saying to use 8 1/2 sandwiches for each layer, it actually should be 9 1/2 for each layer to equal 19 bars and cover the pan completely.

I made this on a family vacation and it went over really well.  I only doubled up the sandwiches (two layers) and made it in a 9x9 pan.  I did that because I didn't have enough sandwiches for a 9x13 pan but it turned out better because the sauce was nice and thick between layers.

Holy cow! This recipe is EASY and delicious!  I used about 19 sandwiches to fill my 9x13 pan.  I didn't use peanuts, because I didn't have any, and that didn't impact the dish at all.  Everyone LOVED it - even my sister who does not like peanut butter together with chocolate loved all of it.  I would make this again and again.  This is a great recipe to have in your back pocket when someone asks you to bring a dessert (as long as they have a freezer). I also did make one change. I layered the ice cream sandwhiches, then the chocolate/peanut butter mixture and then the cool whip and repeated that. I thought it would be too difficult to try to smooth the chocolate/peanut butter mixture on top of the cool whip.

I mixed fudge, and caramel instead of the peanut butter, and syrup. I also used crushed up Heath bar bits in place of the nuts because we are not fans of peanuts. This was HEAVENLY!

Easy, rich and delicious. I did end up using two jars of hot fudge and only added peanut butter to the middle layer. Instead of topping with peanuts, I topped with Heath Bar bits. Everyone really enjoyed this.

ok so if you like DQ icecream cakes - this is for you.  My family liked it but it was not 4 or 5 stars.  I did substitue 14 chopped reeses pb cups for peanuts.  I would hover rate the hershey syrup pb connoction with 5 stars.

Meh. Very average. I hate to admit it, but I have to agree with riblet on this one, albeit not for the same reasons (I have no problem using pre-processed foods every now and then). This sounded really yummy, but the end result didn't meet my standards at all. Surprisingly, I could barely taste the chocolate / PB sauce. All I could taste was ice cream sandwiches and Cool-whip. On the flipside, my hubby could ONLY taste the sauce and didn't like this because of that (he thought this would have been superb without the PB). Having said this, I think a caramel / chocolate layer would have been MUCH better. I layered in reverse (in a large cake pan) as many have suggested, so my dessert was covered with Cool-whip. This (I think) drowned out the chocolate syrup layer because it soaked into my ice cream sandwiches. For spreading purposes, it makes total sense to layer this way, but it does change how the flavors meld together, IMHO. Oh, and I think the peanuts would be much better chopped (I didn't care for the bites of whole peanuts - it was too much for me). 
Drizzled with chocolate syrup, this definitely "looked" pretty, but unfortunately, looks can be deceiving. I'm gonna pass leftovers off to my parents in hopes that they'll enjoy this enough to finish off. It's a shame to let everything go to waste and a real bummer to have found a SUPER easy recipe not worth repeating. Thanks anyways, JONAR. :-)

Super easy and cheap dessert that tastes delicious. Easy to customize to your tastes too. Only change, put the chocolate on BEFORE the cool whip.

I baked a cake for a potluck & it fell apart when I turned it out.  Yikes!  On to Plan B.  Found this awesome recipe & threw it together using Alton Browns yummy chocolate syrup that I happened to have in the frig.  So quick and easy & there wasn't a smidgen left.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for this great recipe Jonar!

I love this recipe.  Instead of putting the dessert in  a 9 x13" pan, I have put it into mini loaf pans, cover them and put them the freezer.  One loaf pan is perfect for just the two of us I also take them to our area's shut-ins.

OMG!  This was a huge hit at our party!  I felt a little guilty serving it, as it was soooo easy, but EVERYONE wanted the recipe.  I did use Smuckers Hot Fudge topping (two jars) instead of chocolate syrup.  Just my preference.  One note, you really need a pretty deep pan to make this.  I used the deepest 9 x 13 pan I had, but still had to kind of squish down the I/C sandwiches.  If you have a lasagna pan, that would probably be perfect.

I mixed caramel, peanut butter and Hershey's syrup together (heated to melt Peanut Butter). Used store bought bakery PB cookies crumbled in between layers. Topped with more cookie crumbs and drizzled the remaining sauce as a garnish! Out of this world!

I made this for out 4th of July celebration and it was awesome!  We will be making this one again!  I used more cool whip as recommended and used both hot fudge with chocolate syrup to thin it out a bit with the peanut butter.  Also I think I used around 22 sandwiches, I squeezed them in there, I did not want any spaces in my cake.  SO GOOD!

This was wonderful!  I could have used a few more ice cream bars (maybe 23 instead of 19) to fill the 9 x 13  pan completely (my ice cream bars were a little thin), but other than that this recipe was easy to do and it was gobbled up by everyone!  Make sure you have a cake carrier to transport it in because if you use foil the fudge might stick to it (it happened to me) but it was easy to fix.  It was a great treat on a hot day and it held up really well!  Thanks!

Very very easy to do, but sure messy to put together.....licking fingers is just as good!! LOL, but that's okay, all in good family fun. I did take the advice and put the syrup mixture down 1st, but my only problem was I didn't wait long enough for my whip topping to thaw, so note to self if you chose not to wait for the whip topping to thaw, put that down 1st, otherwise you're good. But all in all, I chopped the peanuts up when it was timed to use them....especially with little ones. I will make this again. My kids gave serious thumbs up with mouthfuls of ice cream goodness!!!

Very delicious and easy to make.  You do need to have a deep pan though.  I placed my cake in the freezer for about 1 hour to freeze the top; this made it easier to cover it with plastic wrap, without making a mess of the top.  I also sprinkled it with skor bits.  Before serving, I drizzled caramel/ butterscotch topping over it.  Yum!

I had my doubts as I was putting this together but was pleasantly surprised by the end results.  I crushed up cocktail peanuts and put them in between layers and used crushed up reeses pb cups on top.  I loved the contrasting saltiness from the peanuts.  And  I drizzles caramel topping on top with the reeses. Very very good. Halved recipe and 5 of us ate it, with more than half remaining!

I personally didn't really care for this dessert because it was too rich and had more peanut butter flavor then I care for, but everyone I served it to ranted & raved.  They all loved it and ate every last bite.

I made no changes and followed the instructions exactly. I know that some people had a hard time with the chocolate/peanut butter sauce. i just used a large spoon and spooned it over the whipped topping. I didn't try and spread it evenly. I worked perfectly. I will make this again and again. Thanks for the easy recipe.

Although I haven't prepared this recipe exactly as written, I will give it 5 stars!  As a test, before serving to a dinner party, I made a 'one serving' sample using one ice cream sandwich cut in half, (& ingredients on hand...)Hershey's Chocolate Syrup, Smucker's Caramel Syrup, Cool Whip, Heath Toffee Bits.  Using my own ingredients, I followed the recipe for assembly.  This was AWESOME!!  When the 'sample' passed, I chose to make this dessert for my dinner party using the exact ingredients that I used in my sample.  It was a HUGE HIT, very rich and very good!  I suggest cutting very small pieces OR...next time I make this (and I will make this again!) I might make it a one layer dessert.  While two layers are awesome for presentation and makes it a 'bigger' dessert...the top layer seem to slide around when cutting, serving and eating.  This dessert is so good and so rich, I believe one layer would  be just as good and you wouldn't have the 'slippage' you do with 2 layers.  I don't know though...this was just AWESOME prepared as instructed!

This was DECADENT! So rich-looking (and tasting!). I read that some people had trouble layering, but don't switch the order! Just spread your thawed coolwhip over the sandwiches, then DRIZZLE/pour the chocolate mixture over. It comes out so pretty and swirly looking - see my picture! Having the coolwhip on top (vs the chocolate) is not nearly as visually appealing. Easy and delicious! Thanks!

This was very good. Noone raved over it, but it was an older crowd. I think that it's a great recipe for a group of children. I didn't fool anyone into thinking I slaved over it. The first person who bit into it asked, "Is this just ice cream sandwiches with peanut butter inbetween them?" If I could review her I would give her a two.

Instead of using chocolate syrup, use chocolate chips, melted with peanut butter and milk- or if you are going to use syrup, use good chocolate syrup; the hersey's standard type didn't cut it.

WOW!!WOW!!  What a treat!!  Prepared this dessert for a large family BBQ and got nothing but rave reviews.  The 9 X 13 pan isn't quite deep enough, so I put it on a sheet pan before putting it in the freezer.  The small mess is certainly worth it.  Definitely a KEEPER!

I was a bit skeptical with this one, but after seeing the positive reviews - I decided to give it a try. I make it just as written with a can of Hershey's chocolate syrup & Jiffy creamy PB & it was good. I have had better ice cream desserts. Our friends over for dinner wondered how I sliced cake so thin & I had to give up the secret ingredient. They enjoyed it, and I made it a second time, using real whipping cream, but it was not much better.

This was ok. Made it for Christmas Eve dessert and everyone said it was ok, but nothing great. Not enough ice cream for my family. I like the idea of this and I like the pb/choc. sauce, so maybe a pie of chocolate crust, ice cream, sauce, peanuts and then another layer of ice cream, etc. I will play around with my idea, but won't be making this specific recipe again.

Very rich but tasty. Wasn't my favorite dessert, but the recipe was fine. I might try it again with different chocolate and ice cream sandwiches. I used less peanuts to make that flavor less overwhelming. I definitely should have waited till the whipped topping had softened first, still kids and family enjoyed it

Even though my family liked this dessert, I thought it was just OK.  The peanut butter chocolate sauce was a bit overpowering.  I made half with peanuts and the other half with chopped mini peanut butter cups.  Most everyone liked the side with the peanut butter cups.  I probably will not make this unless my family requests it.

This is extremely rich so cut small slices.  I ended up using 22 ice cream bars, and I froze it overnight.  Easy to assemble and very nice presentation.

Using ice cream sandwhiches and cool whip makes it faster. But is better if you make a choc. gram cracker crust for bottom, or lay down crushed oreoes, then layer with bryers ice cream, dark choc. hot fudge, real whip cream, and peanuts.

LOVED this!  I used 12 ice cream sandwiches and cut the top layer into halves longways. Doing it this way, 12 sandwiches fit a 9x13 just fine. Be SURE the chocolate is room temp before using. My top layer stuck to the tin foil, and that was a sticky mess plus a sad loss of some delicious chocolate sauce!

Well, the family has all agreed and they told me that this recipe is far better than the buster bar dessert. The buster bar dessert is just too hard to cut through and this dessert is alot easier to make. Thanks Connie, this recipe will be around in our family for a long time!!

Oh Heavens, this is scrumptious!!!  I accidentally bought hot fudge sauce instead of chocolate syrup, so the sauce ended up too thick (I thinned it with some milk).  I used crushed butterfingers instead of peanuts.  This was so easy and wonderful....got RAVE reviews!

This is so rich and good! You need lots of time for it to firm up but its very FORGIVING! It doesnt matter about the  ice cream sandwiches, just shove them in any way they will line up! I had ti break a few up n shove in the corners then just do the same for the next layer and you'll be good to go!!!!

Served this to a group of friends, and everyone loved it!  However, I am a little puzzled ... I used a standard 9 x 13 glass pan, and there's no way it would all go in - the pan was not deep enough!  I followed other suggestions and put the chocolate/peanut butter layer on before cool whip, but could not fit on the top layer of cool whip.  Was good without out, but I don't understand why no one else had this problem!

This is so easy to make.  The most time consuming thing is unwrapping all of the ice cream sandwiches.  But the result is amazing.  Easy to make and when cut up and served all of my friends think that it looks like it came from a restaurant.  They always think that I made the "cake" part and are amazed at how it is made.  It is pretty rich for most.  My guests always feel VERY special.

Excellent! Made this for the first time this weekend for a potluck at church. It was THE dessert everyone was talking about. Hafta say it didn't look exactly like the picture, but was still delicious. I'll work on the appearance, but wouldn't change the actual recipe at all...it's perfect!

This recipe is fabulous.  I did make a few changes for an adult only party.  After the first layer of sandwiches, I drizzled Kahlua over the top.  The rest of the recipe remained the same.  I also thought that it would be pretty with creme de menthe.  I'd eliminate the peanuts though.

I made this recipe for a family cookout.  It was a huge hit!  Everyone raved about it and several asked for the recipe.  I wasn't as crazy about it as everyone else.  I thought it tasted like ice cream sandwiches with chocolate/peanut butter sauce but I was obviously in the minority!  I followed the directions as written, using 2 boxes of a store brand mini ice cream sandwiches that fit the pan perfectly.  I wish I had followed the suggestion of prior reviewer to put the chocolate topping on before the whipped cream but it still worked out.  It is easy to assemble, and because everyone seemed to like it so much, I will definitely make it again!

Everyone loved this!  I didn't use peanut butter or peanuts.  I layered without warming the hot fudge and put pecans on top.  It made this easy dessert more "adult".  I've also made this with just one layer for a lighter dessert.

I made this for my husband’s birthday and was so tempted to alter the recipe and make it with caramel and pecans but made as is and we all loved it!  I will definitely make again and might even try it with my caramel and pecans next time to see what that taste like.  It makes a bunch so if I ever make it for the two of us I will cut the recipe in half or just do one layer of everything. Thanks for the recipe...I had been searching for an ice cream dessert and this is a great one!

I won't make this very often because it's very rich and high in calories, but when you need a yummy, no-fail dessert that's guaranteed to please, this is the recipe to pull out. My parents drove 4,000 kms to visit us last week, and when I served them this hot fudge ice cream bar dessert they were very glad they came!

A wonderful & easy recipe! The hardest part was unwrapping all the ice cream sandwiches (I needed 22)  The only change I made was to double the peanuts.  Took this to a 75th birthday party and it was simply GONE.  I'll definitely make this again!

We all loved this. Lots of ways to "customize" to suit different tastes. They even sell Neopolitan ice cream sandwiches which would give an added dimension. Thanks for an easy and delicious new favorite!

This is amazing!  I would say it needs a bit more whipped topping for my tastes though.  I also replaced the chocolate layer with caramel sauce trying to make a Snickers cake and it was soo delish!  It wasn't as pretty since a lot of the caramel sauce oozed to the bottom, but it tasted so good it didn't matter!

I made this recipe for a dessert contest at work. I did a few variations as other people suggested.First I used 1 box (pkg of 12) of ice cream bars & put them in the bottom of 8x8 glass pan. Then I drizzled carmel syrup on top and then topped it with a layer of cool whip.Then after mixing the warm chocolate syrup & crunchy peanut butter together layered it on top.I then layered it all again but I added a layer of cool whip after the chocolate syrup mixture. After that layer I cut in half small reece cups and put those on top. I put it in the freezer overnight. Ready to serve the next morning.Very rich but good!! Will make again!!

Amazing!! Made this for my sister's birthday per her request. Family and company raved about it!! One guest called his wife and compared it to an ice cream cake from Coldstone Creamery. A compliment for sure!! I did make a couple of changes to suit our tastes. I used chunky peanut butter and doubled the amount called for. We are peanut butter lovers!! I also omitted the peanuts and used chopped up Snicker bars instead. Definitely would recommend that you freeze overnight for a nice, solid texture, and that you pour the chocolate sauce over the ice cream sandwiches for easier spreading. The peanut butter makes this recipe so add plenty!! This dessert is a keeper for sure. Everybody was fighting over the last couple of pieces!! Will be making again soon:) Thanks for sharing!!

Another keeper! I made this last year and forgot to rate it. I made this for the kids and a cheesecake for the adults and quess which one went first? I used hot fudge and spread that on before the coolwhip. I left out the peanuts because most of the kids aren't fond of them. I did serve chopped pecans on the side fot the adults, along with a little pitcher of caramel sauce! Talk about overkill! What a wonderful summertime dessert! *Update* I have made this several times since I have posted. I thought I would remind everyone that it's ok to "wing it" with the ingredients. Since I last made it, the ice cream sandwichs I use have gotten much smaller. It took 11 & 2/3 sandwiches per layer in my 13x9 pan. I'm sure we will have to adjust to the times. The time may come when there is no longer  a "large" box of Jello (5 1/2 oz) the same as there is no longer an 18.25 oz cake mix. I guess I will adjust some of my recipes if they need it.

This dessert has made it into my favourites folder (to make often) I am a big fan of ice cream sandwiches but dressing them up like this is even more heavenly. I didn't have chocolate syrup but used hot fudge sauce which I thinned with some cream. I also added chopped peanut butter cups between the layers for even more peanut buttery goodness and I finished the top layer with the fudge sauce first then the whipped topping. It looked gorgeous when I cut into it - like a layered cake. Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent. I have made it twice already for company and everyone loved it.  I did add the cool whip after the topping and on top of the cool whip I drizzled caramel topping.  It tasted almost like a snickers bar.  This is a keeper!

Delicious!  The only thing that would improve it is if the ice cream sandwiches fit perfectly into the pan without a gap along the side.  I also put the chocolate/p.b. mixture on before the whipped topping.  The top layer looked a little boring so I drizzled more of the chocolate mixture over the top.

I made this dessert with hot fudge sauce instead of chocolate syrup and almonds instead of peanuts. It was SOOOO GOOD! I took it to a family get-together on Memorial Day and everyone loved it! You could even do just one layer of everything and it would still be great (and a little easier to eat).

Made for Easter Dessert.  Very good.  Mine took 2 pkgs of 12 ice cream sandwiches, but I used a large looking 9x13 pan and they were generic cheap sandwiches from Aldi.  Actually the whole thing was made from Aldi products.  I wasn't sure if it meant hot fudge or chocolate syrup, but I used the thick hot fudge that comes in a jar.  It was phenomenal.  I also added Reese's peanut butter cups chunked up on top.  Very good.

Dessert doesnt get any better than this. This is AMAZING! A little bit goes a long way so you can make one batch of it and cut it into small pieces. It also lasts a logn time in the freezer.

This was a BIG hit. I used my round ice cream cake pan so I had to cut and fit some. Instead of using peanuts I used almonds but only on the top. I used toffee bits in the middle and some along with the almonds on tops. WOW! It is a rich dessert but soooo yummy and easy to do. Thank you so much for sharing!!!! :))))

I made this for my husband's goody day and was asked for the recipe, however the little bit that I tried needed something more. It needed caramel in the mix. I will try it again using the peanut butter chunks instead of nuts and drizzle a lot of caramel sauce on top too. But it is an easy fun dessert. Just needs tweaking.

Very good and very easy. I put more peanut butter in than it called for and it made it too rich. Will follow directions next time and will make again often.

Quick and easy recipe. Everyone seemed to enjoy, but very rich so make sure to cut small pieces!  I served 6 adults and didn't even use half of the 9x13, will definitely cut the recipe in half next time. I used hot fudge with the pb instead of chocolate sauce and drizzled that and some caramel directly on top of the ice cream sandwiches, then added cool whip layer. Topped with crushed oreos instead of peanuts.  Looked great and tasted even better!

Here's what I did: crunched up fudgeo cookies (2 layers from the bag - put them in a ziplock bag and mashed them all up), made a layer using them in a 9 x 9 pan, but that pan in the freezer and took my homemade ice cream out of the freezer at that time so it would soften a little bit, then I only had 1/2 cup of chocolate sauce so I added half a leftover milk chocolate bunny rabbit from Easter and melted it in the microwave for 1 minute -stirred all that, stirred in 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter. Left everything for about 20 min so the choc/pb mixture had time to cool a bit. Then I took my pan out of the freezer, put on a layer of ice cream, layered the pb/choc mixture on top of the ice cream, topped with about 2 cups of dream whip (just like cool whip basically), added on a few more crunched up fudgeos to the top and now it's in the freezer. It looks delicious and I can't wait to eat it. Just thought I'd share how I compensated for a lack of ingredients! Update: it ended up being delicious!

Very easy and quick to make and is delicious.  The peanuts add a nice crunch and saltiness that goes well with the chocolate peanut butter flavors. It does make a very large amount and could be halved.

I made this dessert for a little get together with some college friends and everyone absolutely loved it! The layers were definitely intense - we call this dessert "The Diabetic Coma." So I highly recommend this recipe for an event. I also used Cookies N' Cream ice cream sandwiches rather than plain vanilla and it was awesome!

It was a big hit with everyone. I think it needs to set up for a couple hours. And I needed one more ice cream bar to fill my pan. So I would have 20 ice cream bars instead. It is very rich and small pieces are better.

It was very satisfying, yet I thought of ways I liked it better and tried it with success! I put the chocolate sauce on the bars first and then after chilling in the freezer, I added slices of banana followed by whipped cream, walnuts, and caramel sauce. Super yummy

This recipe is perfect as is....a little expensive to make, but you can serve 20 people with a 9x13 pan of this....it is very rich, so they will only require a small 2in by 2in square and be blown away!  The best I ice cream desert I have EVER had!

This is a good dessert!  I halved the recipe, using an 8x8 pan instead of 9x13.   To layer it properly, I needed 12 bars.  Everything else was halved.  Substituted hot fudge ice cream topping for the chocolate syrup, since that's what I had.  I put the choc./p.b. layer on before the whipped topping, it just seemed easier.  I didn't have peanuts, but had some peanut butter cups to use up, so I put those on top instead of the peanuts.  It was a hit for my sons birthday, since he doesn't like cake!

I made this dessert for my fiance for Valentines day, and he LOVED it... he had 3-4 slices!! (and he's a healthy eater)!!! I switched it up a bit and added 1/3 cup milk to the chocolate syrup/PButter sauce because it was a little too sweet for my taste. Also... once I heated the chocolate syrup and added the peanut-butter I let it set in the freezer for 30-45 mins, then started layering the sandwhiches, choc/PB sauce, whipped dream, (added drizzeled CARAMEL), peanuts, and repeated! It was soooo! Definatley making this again!

This was great!! I also put whip topping on the sandwiches first.
 It reminds me of a peanut buster parfiet you get at Dairy Queen. I think the next time I make it I'll leave out the sandwiches and use soft ice cream then put whip topping, peanut butter/chocalote mixture then peanuts on top then repeat layers. I also crushed the peanuts before putting on top of mixture. IT WAS GREAT!!

Everyone at Memorial Day BBQ loved this.  People who didn't initially want dessert had a piece after seeing everyone else enjoying it.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I left off the peanuts (I only had salted cocktail peanuts, not dry roasted.) Next time I may just use crumbled reeses pieces instead of putting PB in the chocolate syrup.  The hardest part of making this is unwrapping all of the sandwiches!

This recipe was a hit at my dinner party! Everyone loved it! I ended up using 24 ice cream sandwiches instead of the 19 the recipe called for. I took some suggestions from other reviews and used fudge sauce and instead of chocolate sauce and reduced the viscosity with a bit of milk. I also used Reese PB cubs instead of the whole peanuts as one of the reviews suggested, although, I think that the peanuts would have added great texture to the dish. I also used real whipped cream instead of frozen. This recipe is so easy and versatile. You can pretty much put any spin on it and it will taste great. Thank you for posting this recipe! I am sure to make it again.

This recipe is awesome.  It is my most requested recipe for every function.  The only changes I make are to use a jar of Hot Fudge Sauce melted in the microwave instead of the syrup and peanut butter (have also tried with caramel sauce) and to use real whipping cream with powdered sugar...  This should be 10 stars if possible!

I made both the peanut butter version and the caramel version. The peanut butter was by far the better. The caramel and chocolate sauce did not harden in the freezer as did the p.b. and chocolate and therefore it was messier. But my church loved both and both were devoured in about 20 minutes. I put chopped up Reese's P.B. cups on top of the p.b. and drizzled caramel on the other. Next time I'll try melting caramel squares instead of using caramel syrup, maybe that will help the chocolate freeze. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best dessert & really easy.  I take it to all the dinners at church & there's always a line when I bring it out of the freezer.  I usually do a swirly pattern by drizzling the chocolate from a wooden spoon over the top & it looks very pretty.  It sounds cliche, but no one ever believes how simple it is.

TO DIE FOR!!!  Would give it 10 stars if I could!  Easy to make and everyone LOVED it!  Can be made a couple of days ahead of time, if needed, just wrap well with saran wrap and foil and store in freezer.  Will definately make again.  This would also be a fun dessert to make with kids!  Thanks!

I made this for Memorial day party we had and everyone loved it. It was easy. I didnt have a 9x13 pan so I used 2 smaller ones, one with peanuts and the other with M&M's and it was a hit! I will make this again this summer!!

This was very yummy and quite the frozen treat!  I didn't change a thing (since it was the first time I made it) and it received high praises from all of my guests!  Just be sure to make the chocolate peanut butter mixture ahead of time just so it has time to cool (I threw it in the freezer for a little while.)!  If you're a coffee drinker, have a fresh pot ready to enjoy with this frozen delight! In fact, this dessert might be yummy with a little bit of Kahlua drizzled over the top!!!

I prepared this dessert exactly as the recipe stated and then drizzled caramel over the top.  It was DELICIOUS!!!  My husband's firm had their company picnic recently and there was a dessert competition.  I won the grand prize with this recipe!  I felt a little guilty because this was SO EASY to make, and several desserts there were very complicated and took much time to prepare.  Nevertheless, I won, and I highly recommend that you give this one a try!!!

This is awesome!  I made it for a church group and it was rated a 14 out of a 10!  I followed the suggestions to put the chocolate layer on before the whipped topping and that worked great.  To make the top of the dessert look a little more fancy, I topped the whipped topping with crushed peanuts and maraschino cherry halves and then drizzled some chocolate syrup over that.  Great recipe and will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I inverted the final layer of choc/pb and whipped topping so the top layer would be white w/ peanuts on top.  Great recipe!!!

This recipe was quick and easy. However, make sure you use good quality ice cream sandwiches. I didn't, and it didn't taste to swell, even the young children turned it down.

Although I used more icecream sandwiches than the recipe called for, it was truly delicious.  I made this for a birthday, and everything was devoured.  Instead of the whipped cream layer I combined half softened ice cream with whipped cream, giving it a uniform sandwich pattern.  I also used crunchy peanut butter in the middle layer, which tasted great!  I can't wait to make it again!!!

Great, rich recipe loved by the whole family.  Followed the recipe exactly except used fewer sandwiches to fit my smaller, but deeper dish. Also took the good advice of using the chocolate sauce BEFORE the whipped cream.  We served caramel sauce and cherries on the side.  Can't wait to go off my diet so I can make this again!

VERY GOOD AND VERY SIMPLE.  I THINK THIS RECIPE WOULD BE A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO A BIRTHDAY CAKE, OR A GREAT DESSERT FOR A SUMMER PARTY.  I OMITTED THE PEANUTS AND SERVED IT TOPPED W/HOT FUDGE.  IT WAS A BIG HIT!

DELICIOUS and so easy to make!  I had to omit the peanutbutter and nuts (due to allergies)and instead drizzled thin lines of hot caramel sauce next to the hot fudge lines and then swirled them a little. Everyone loved this dessert and it disappeared quickly! Will make again!  THANKS!

I made this in a loaf pan, using only 4 sandwiches per layer, that STILL was WAY too much for our family..this is TOO RICH and for ME to say that, thats really something.  A one inch square would be plenty for anyone, this is TOO much of a good thing...also I omitted the peanut butter and used hot fudge with peanuts on top.

Delicious!! I made this for a summer birthday party and everyone thought it was refreshing and delicious.  I highly recommend it.
I took the advice of one reviewer and I used the crunchy peanut butter instead of peanuts to save some money without changing the great taste.

This recipe has been made over and over again to everyone's delight. For those with nut allergies, I use hot fudge sauce and cut up maraschino cherries instead of the nuts and peanut butter sauce - still great. Should be frozen for at least 5 hours to keep it from going soft too fast.

THIS WAS A VERY TASTY AND SPECIAL-LOOKING DESSERT.
I DID AS ANOTHER SUGGESTED AND LET THE COOL WHIP
FREEZE UP BEFORE STARTING THE NEXT LAYER.
I OMITTED THE PEANUTS, JUST A PREFERENCE. 
I SIFTED COCOA POWDER OVER THE TOP LAYER OF COOL
WHIP, MADE IT LOOK FANCY. IT TASTED PRETTY GOOD,
THE KIDS ALL LOVED IT AT EASTER. THIS WAS "GODDESS
APPROVED", IN A HO-HUM SORT OF WAY.

Oh yeah this was definitely fantastic.  We explained what it was before we served it, and after the explanation people were drooling.  This is really really great.  Very sweet though.  It was really mushy when we served it, this needs more than an hour to freeze, I think.  THANKS!

I made this the other night and although it was nothing to rave about...is was something that you could throw together fairly easily. Instead of using the peanut butter and chocolate sauce...I used hot fudge. I will definitely continue my search for a throw together type frozen desert.

I had a party to go to today.  I needed to make dessert that was quick and easy.  Once again, I turned to Allrecipes for help.  
The Hot Fudge Ice Cream Bar Dessert is so easy and delicous.  Everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe.  I used carmel and chocolate sauce.  Next time I will try the peanut butter.  
What a big hit! This dessert is incredibly and I am looking forward to making it again.

This was easy and delicious summer-time dessert!  My ice cream sandwiches must have been a bit smaller since I easily used 12 in each layer.  I'll definitely make this again (and again).

Delicious! Everyone at our dinner party thought it was a time consuming fancy dessert but it was a quick delicious recipe. I will be making this again and again! (I did use Oreos because that is what I had and the kids loved it!)

Update:  I make this a lot.  I've found that a four bar cake (2 on the bottom and two on top) is a really nice manageable size for a smaller group.  (up to 8 people cause it is really rich.). I pass these little cakes out as treats for my friends and they love them.

Older Review:  This was an enormous hit at an office party I brought it to.  I used a total of 16 sandwiches.  I put down a layer, spread the natural peanut butter right on top, then drizzled chocolate syrup, then another layer of sandwiches and froze it in a Tupperware container.  Just before I served it I turned it out onto a platter, iced it with cool whip and drizzled  it with more chocolate syrup and crumbled butterfinger.  I iced the sides of it with cool whip too, and you could not tell it was ice cream sandwiches.  When you cut it, it looked like an intricate layered dessert.  People went nuts for it, there was not a bit left.  I even had people asking me where I bought it and others were like, "wow how did you do that?"  It totally cracked me up knowing how easy it was.  It took about 10 minutes, I made it right here in the office kitchen.

This was an ABSOLUTE hit and will most likely become a birthday tradition. I made this cake for my husband and son who have their birthday on the same day and both wanted an ice cream cake. Instead of whipped cream in the middle layer, I used vanilla ice cream and mixed it with OMG clusters(chocolate, toffee and almonds clusters)and mini rolos. For the top layer, I used vanilla ice cream and whipped cream (about 1/2 and 1/2) and mixed crushed oreo cookies to it. I did drizzle chocolate and caramel sauce on top when serving it.  This ended up being crazy rich, so you might want to do modification to only one layer, unless your crowd has a sweet tooth like mine.  Thanks for this GREAT recipe!!!

Love this recipe. Cool dessert for a hot day. "Kids" (young and old) loved it... Another variation that we love is to crush Butterfinger candy bars and put between layers and on top of whipped cream in place of peanuts and peanut butter.  We use several to get plenty of crunch and flavor. We then drizzle the chocolate syrup over top of whipped cream and drag knife through to make it pretty.  Then add your crunched Butterfingers on top of that. Can also use the Neopolitan ice cream sandwiches.

VERY delicious, easy, summer dessert.  I halved the recipe, using a deep 8x8 dish.  It took 11 ice cream bars.  I took others' advice & bought hot fudge topping instead.  I used about 3/4 jar of that & mixed it with 1/2 cup reduced fat pb.  It was somewhat stiff but spreadable.  I'd probably work on smoothing that out for next time.  Finally, I also ditched the peanuts & chopped up mini peanut butter cups.  Everyone really enjoyed it.

This is super yummy and really easy! I have made other ice cream sandwich based desserts, but I would say this is my favorite. If you love peanut butter & peanuts this is for you too. I think that is what really makes this recipe so awesome. Great on a hot summer day!

This was super yummy! Everyone liked it and it's a great easy dessert to make. I'm not crazy about the taste of chocolate syrup so I used milk chocolate instead...harder to spread but delish!!!

This was good, but extremely rich!  I think I would have preferred chopped toffee bits instead of peanuts, however, so I'll do that next time.  I did follow other reviews and put the chocolate-peanut butter mixture before the whipped cream, and would definitely do that again!  Be sure and let the individual servings thaw about 5 minutes before serving, otherwise, it's just too frozen to enjoy all the flavors.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this!  I lined a loaf pan with saran wrap so dessert could be removed easily.  Then I used hot fudge, caramel, and Heath bar pieces after each layer.   Klodike ice cream sandwiches fit 2 1/2  on each layer.  Rather than Cool Whip, I used real whipped cream sweetened with a little bit of sugar and vanilla and spread it over the top and down the sides.  After chilling overnight, I removed the "loaf", sliced 1/2 inch pieces, and spread over the top fresh strawberries which had been macerated with a little sugar    It was yummy and served 8.

I used chocolate fudge topping, and put the cool whip on top of it. I also needed 24 ice cream sandwiches to make a double layer in a 9x13 pan. This is very easy to make, a great project with your kids. It tastes wonderful too!

So easy and tasty, and it looks like you spent hours layering.  I use this as a simple recipe for kids in a "surivial cooking" unit in one of my classes.  Many students have said they have made this recipe over and over again. It has become a dessert staple to most people with whom I have shared it.   Great presentation from such a simple recipe too.

I made this to take to a friends house over the weekend and all 3 women there wanted the recipe. It is very easy to make and tastes incredible! I made    it as written except I did chop the peanuts. I will be making this again.

Loved this recipe - it came out great and was as easy as everyone said.  I had a funny shaped pan, so I had to cut some of my icecream bars to fill the pan but they cut easily with a knife.  I used Cookies & Cream icecream sandwiches on the bottom layer and regular vanilla on the top layer.  Made it look like even more layers.  I agree with other reviews that it tasted better the second day.  I think I'll try again in the future and take the basic idea and try different flavors of syrup and different toppings.  Wow'ed everyone who tried it.

Great idea. I felt like I had an expensive cake from 31 Flavors in the house. We call it "poor man's 31 Flavor cake." It didnt' last long at my house.

This has to be one of the easiest desserts I have ever prepared...not to mention one of the yummiest!  To add more of a bite, I added toffee bits and chopped walnuts to each layer.  It was quickly devoured by both kids and adults.  It's an easy crowd pleaser and my quick go-to recipe. :)

YUM!!!  I halved the recipe, which made 9 servings and I tweaked it just a tad, simply because we were specifically in the mood for something really chocolatey/peanut buttery.  I omitted the peanuts and added crunchy peanut butter and peanut butter cups.  So my layers went...IC sandwich, crunchy pb, chocolate/pb mixture, cool whip; repeat and top with chopped peanut butter cups.  Mmmmm.  SO good and perfectly chocolatey/peanut buttery!!  I will say that it is much better the longer it's frozen.  Mine was in for 3 hours before our company came and it was frozen, but still kind of softly frozen.  I would give it at least 5 hours next time.

This is amazing!!! My sons couldn't wait to have it again the next day. I had a family that had a peanut allergy so I used carmel ice cream topping instead I ended with the cool whip and sprinkled choc wafer crumbs on instead. Excellent my kids loved it so much I'm afraid to try the original receipe but I will.

This was a huge hit on the Fourth.  The recipe said to use 19 ice cream sandwiches, but next time I think I would buy two dozen sandwiches as they can be cut into pieces to fill in gaps between the layered sandwiches.

This has been such a hit with everyone that I have made it for. Be ready with this simple recipe because everyone wants to make it after tasting it and finding out how simple it is to make. I do use cool whip instead of whip cream, seems to stand up a little better. Thanks for a real winner.

We left the nuts out - layered the chocolate sauce and then the whip cream.  On top we put miniature peanut butter cups.  Yummy!!! Everyone said that it was better than DQ!

Very good and so easy!  I brought this to a neighbor's for dinner and this was supposed to be the kids' dessert.  Everyone - kids and adults - had seconds!  I mixed hot fudge and peanut butter (no need to heat up) and followed others' suggestions to layer the ice cream sandwiches, chocolate/peanut butter sauce, then cool whip and repeat.  I chopped up mini peanut butter cups and sprinkled them on top.  Will definitely make this again!

Outstanding! I followed the advice from other reviewers and mixed chocolate fudge and peanut butter together first before spreading to make it easier. I added caramel on top of that then the whipped cream. I topped it off with pecans. Everyone loved it!

this should be illegal.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for halving it and making it in a 9x9 pan.  it didn't quite fill it but I think that made it easier to serve, as there was less breakage.  the peanut butter totally makes the dish, neither my boyfriend nor I could get enough of it.  I made it for Valentine's Day dessert for something unexpected and it would also be perfect for a summer dinner.  I would eat it any day of the year!  thanks SOOO much for sharing this recipe; I will definitely make it again!

Excellent flavor but my pan was overflowing  by the time I was done layering. Next time I'll line the pan up the sides with heavy-duty foil to make sure the sides of the pan stay clean.

The sauce alone is worth the recipe....I used a can of Hersey's and the PB, didn't use it all, and refigerated the extra. It was perfect...it did not solidify at all. Tasted great over vanilla ice cream....YUM!

Dynamite recipe!!  I used fudge rather than chocolate syrup.  I also layered the fudge/PB mix first - followed by the cool whip. This base recipe has endless opportunities. Next time I may try omitting the peanut butter, and doing a coconut/almond variation...YUM!  Thank you for the fantastic recipe.

This was a very easy and impressive dessert! I did make some changes... I made it in a 11 by 17 inch pan. I used 2 and 1/2 boxes of Blue Bunny Vanilla Ice cream Sandwiches. To assemble the dessert, I lined the ice cream sandwiches then mixed the chocolate & peanut mixture (I used Hershey Fudge and Chunky Peanut Butter). I then chopped 1 cup frozen Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. I put a layer of Friendly's Vanilla Fudge Swirl Ice Cream. Next, repeat with Ice Cream Sandwiches and Chocolate Mixture. (Minus the Reese's) I piped on Cool Whip and put it in the freezer overnight. It was super easy! Thanks for a great base for a recipe!

I can't believe I have never rated this recipe. It is so good. I have been making it for years. I love to use Sue's hot fudge from this site. Pretty easy and very tasty.

My husband made this recipe and he changed a couple things....he put the chocolate mixture on first instead of the whipped topping so it wouldn't be so messy (other reviews recommended this and it seemed to make sense) and I know he added extra peanut butter as well but I'm not sure how much. We also went without the peanuts. This was a really good dessert.

A big hit with my Book Club!  You may use a couple more ice cream bars based on the size of your pan.  As other suggested, put chocolate on before the whipped cream.

I took this dessert to a party and everybody loved it.  A few people even asked me for the recipe.  I thought it was a bit messy to make, but well worth it.  I had to put a tray under it when I was making it and in the freezer so that it caught all the chocolate that oozed over the top of the pyrex.  Would for sure make this one again!

It was a huge hit!  I mixed the chocolate syrup with crunchy peanut butter and omitted the peanuts.  I also put the choco/PB mixture on before the whipped topping which worked out really well.  EVERYONE LOVED THIS.

I made this yesterday...it's good, but not GREAT...however, it's definitely simple.  Even though I love peanut putter, if I make it again I will elimiate the peanut butter. I did alter the receipe however on suggestions from other reviews---I added caramel as one of the layers,vanilla cool whip, and to the top I added toffee pieces & crushed/broken chocholate chip cookie which were great substitutions/additions.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a hit.  It was messy to put together but what fun is cooking without a little mess?  I also like how versatile it is where you can +/- ingredients to make it your own.  I ended up using 24 ice cream sandwiches as well.  I also agree that you need a little bit deeper dish.  This is important if you need to transport it like I did.  But all in all a great recipe!

Am a high school Family & Consumer Science teacher- my students absolutely love this recipe, so does my family- we usually put peanuts only on 1/2 to satisfy those who don't care for nuts. We don't change a thing about it.

I made this dessert for a party and everyone loved it.  As per another review....I sprinkled half of a 4 oz. bag of Heath English Toffee Bits on top with the peanuts.  The next time I make it I will use the whole bag using half in the middle also.  Note:  I used a 9 x 13 pan and used 24 Kemps ice cream sandwiches.

Yum!  Yum!  Made this for our community group and they almost polished it all off.  

I think they are making ice cream sandwiches smaller than they used to.  I had to use almost 24 of them for my 9X13 dish.  So be sure to buy enough in case they are small.  I also used Hershey's Milk Chocolate in a jar - in my opinion it was way too sweet and made the dessert very rich.  Next time I'll stick to the regular chocolate syrup.

Very easy to make and a crowd pleaser, especially if you have a crowd of kids. :)  I thought it was pretty good, but didn't finish my slice.  Not sure if it was too rich or what.  Admittedly, I used pb Oreos instead of the nuts so maybe that was my mistake.  It's still going in the recipe box because it was a hit with the kids, for sure!

This was good.  I followed the recipe exactly - except I put it in 2 loaf pans instead of the 9x13 - that would not have fit into my freezer.  

Everyone thought this was very good.  The only change I would make is next time I will buy different ice cream sandwiches.  I used PET one's and the sandwich part was kind of hard.  Other than that it was great!

Pretty good, especially for being so easy! I put the chocolate/peanut butter layer on first, then the whipped cream, and both spread really easily. I wouldn't say people were wowed by it, but they definitely enjoyed it.

This is the BEST!!!  Evertime I make this it disappears and people are always wanting seconds.  Wal-Mart has peanut butter ice cream sandwiches which I used last time and that was even BETTER!!  If you can find them definintely try it.  It makes it so peanut buttery!!

Well I'll be darned!  Who knew that this would be so delightful!  The "hot fudge" sauce was thick and rich.  I used chunky peanut butter for more texture.  Rather than using a 9x13 baking dish I used 2 loaf pans then sliced the dessert width wise and presented it on it's side so you could see all the layers.  Slice a strawberry and "fan" it out then dust with a little powdered sugar for presentation.  It was beautiful and YUMMY! Sure to impress!

This was really sweet, really gooey, and really...really un-healthy!  Yummo!  I used chopped up heath bars and crunchy peanut butter.

Very easy and perfect for company!

I didn't use peanut butter but I did use Hot Fudge and Caramel and toased Almonds.

I served it at our Super Bowl party and everyone raved about it!

Perfect recipe to have the kids help with!

My MIL favorite dessert is hot fudge sundaes and this was perfect for her birthday. Fun and easy to assemble - there were 10 of us and I could have halved it or only done one layer and still had enough. My son does not like peanut butter so on the first layer I poured on carmel, the second layer chocolate sauce. I needed 22 Carnation ice cream bars though. Will make again! Thanks!

OMIGOSH!! Have you ever had a peanut buster parfait from dairy queen? This is the best recipe ever for several reasons. 1. It's so easy the most inexperienced cook could do this. 2. Everyone will tell you how good it is and think you've spent a lot of time on it. 3. There is plenty for everyone.  This is a keeper and I wouldn't change a thing. Thank you so much!

This was amazing and would definitely make again.  I made this for my parents, and while not big sweet eaters, it lasted for weeks in their freezer.  I was amazed after about 2 weeks in the freezer, it still tasted as good as it did in the beginning.

I took this to a family cookout & it was loved! There were no leftovers! Everyone wants the recipe. This was so easy to make. I made it before church & put it in the freezer. By the time we got home from church it was ready to take to the cookout. Thanks for this recipe. It's a new family favorite!

This was very tasty, and my husband loved it.  However, it really did just taste like ice cream sandwiches with fudge and cool whip.  Good, but can't believe people would actually consider it as layers of cake and ice cream.  Definitely a family dessert - not fancy, but tasty.

This turned into a disaster. Maybe because I used generic ice cream sandwiches, but it was a mess. The entire thing collapsed before I could get it back in the freezer, so we had to eat it like that.

So yummy!!!  Easy to make...definitely layer on the chocolate/peanut butter mix before the Cool Whip.  I liked it with crunchy peanut butter and topped with caramel sauce and mini m&m's.  A big hit with kids and adults alike.

This is a new favorite at my house and is on the "most requested" list. I didn't read the recipe as closely as I should have and used hot fudge instead of chocolate syrup - it was fabulous and created a very thick rich chocolate peanut butter layer. As a result it didn't spread very easily over the whipped topping and I had to switch those two layers, putting the whipped topping over the fudge layer.

This recipe is incredible!  Huge hit with family and friends!  Due to peanut allergies in children I substituted caramel for peanut butter and M&M mini's for peanuts. Did have a little difficulty fitting it all in a 9x13 but other than that - fabulous!

This is WONDERFUL!!  It was so easy - my kids helped with every part.  I don't like peanut butter so I used caramel topping in its place.  Very rich!!!  A little piece goes a long way.  Will make often.  I had to use 22 sandwiches to fill my glass 9x13 and it did come a little higher than the top, but I just stuck toothpicks on it to hold up the plastic wrap and all came out fine.  This is our new favourite!!!

This was incredible, and so easy to make!  I used lowfat ice cream sandwiches and nonfat cool whip, and it still tasted great.  I highly recommend using crunchy peanut butter, it really made the texture great! I also topped with peanuts and marachino cherries, so it looked really pretty.  Everyone loved it!

If I could give this more stars, I would!  I've made this many times.  After the first time you take it some where, they will ask you to bring it again every time.  Plus, it is SOOOO easy to make.  The last time I took it to a gathering, people were telling my husband how lucky he was to have me because I make such great desserts. Ha!  

Another thing about this dessert is that people never know you actually used ice cream sandwiches uless you tell them.  It's one of those recipes that makes people think you made the whole thing yourself!  Gotta love it.

Absolutely the best, easiest ice cream cake. I made it for my boys' birthday and it was gobbled up. I did change the layers and put the chocolate sauce on before the whipped cream. I sprinkled mini m&m's over the top to make it look festive and also drizzled some caramel sauce over the top. Excellent!!!!

I have made this several times with excellent results!  I have added things like caramel sauce and tried it with crunchy PB.  This is sooooo good!

Simply scrumptious. I had been looking for this recipe in a magazine I saw it in and couldn't find it. I was thrilled to see it here on my favorite site. Made this for my daughters' birthday party. Big hit! Waiting for the chocolate to cool took the longest. Other than that, this was so easy. This was well worth the wait and very chocolatey too! Make sure to freeze it well.
Thanks Connie

This was so easy to make and minimal clean-up - everyone loved it - it was a great change of pace from regular birthday cake and more enjoyable than a store-bought ice cream cake.

Yummmmm! We had company and both adults and children enjoyed this. Easy to prepare (I'd say the longer ahead, the better.....it needs time to FREEZE)and a fun surprise to end a good meal.

I cut this recipe about 1/3 and used a 9x9 pan in order to sample it before I brought it to my son's football team's start-the-season cookout tomorrow.  As Janice used to say on Friends "oooh, my Gawwwd!"!!  This is really good and so easy.  I didn't read all the reviews but I wonder if unsalted peanuts could be used since it did have a little too much salty taste.  I was also thinking of using the "magic shell" chocolate sauce which will give it a crunch but I don't know if that can be heated up and mixed with the peanut butter.   Anyhow, I'm sure the high school boys will love this so I'm making a double batch for the picnic tomorrow.   Thanks so much!

Very delicious, second's all around, a little rich but really liked the peanut flavor. I put down the choc/peanut butter first then nuts with whip creme. Big hit for my birthday.

This is soooo good!  Everyone loves it and so easy too.  I chopped the peanuts so you would get more in every bite.  I also needed more than 19 ice cream sandwiches.  It depends on the size you buy.  I used 24 total so don't eat the extras first--you might need them!!

You can't go wrong with this recipe!  I omitted the nuts and it was fantastic!  I was amazed that chocolate syrup could be transformed into hot fudge with the help of peanut butter and a microwave!  Will make this again and again.

What a great dessert!  The idea was different and we made it for a group of 8 who could only eat about half of it.  I think even doing one layer would be good for smaller groups but this one was a crowd pleaser that was easy to make and raved about by all!

Oh my gosh! This dessert was sinfully good. I wasn't sure when I read it how it would turn out, but I went with all the good reviews and they were right! You don't even realize that it's ice cream sandwhiches. So good. I would think that it would need longer than an hour to freeze nicely - you would want this dish nice and solid.

This is going to be my favorite summer-time (anytime)dessert!  I've made it a couple times in the last 2 wks. and everybody has raved about it.  So easy to prepare ahead of time, which makes it an excellent dessert when you have lots to do.  This recipe is a 10 in my book.

Sooo sweet and rich. Very easy to make. I used a new mini size of ice cream sandwiches and made a 9 inch pan size and it's so rich we still have some after 3 days (a record for our house for desserts!) Thanks for the sweet treat!

This was another winner.  I was tempted to leave out the peanuts, but I'm so glad I didn't.  They really combine to make a wonderful dessert.  It is also striking in its presentation.  Certainly suitable for dinner guests.

This was really yummy. I added maraschino cherries to the top.   It was a little too rich so next time I’ll cut back on the  peanut butter a bit. 

I made the recipe exactly as is with the exception of my cherry garnish. There’s a lot of variations you can do with this recipe. Add caramel. Less  peanut butter. Flavored whipped  cream. Neapolitan  Ice cream sandwiches. Pecans. The possibilities made endless!!

This was so good!  I used caramel instead of peanut butter, and I made my own hot fudge sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.  I think next time, I might try to incorporate yellow cake into the recipe.

Delicious and so easy to make.  The hardest part is unwrapping the ice cream sandwiches.  I served this to my bridge club ladies and they all loved it and wanted the recipe.  I followed the directions except put the chocolate over sandwiches first, followed by the cool whip as suggested by several others.  Thanks for sharing.

Amazing!  Seriously, I made this for a friend get together, half with Spanish peanuts (these are the best to use on a sundae/ice cream in my opinion), the other with no nuts, and it was a HUGE hit!  Adults and kids alike loved it.  It really is incredibly easy.  The only thing is to plan ahead to make it as it does require the freezer time.  YUM!!

Delicious, fantastic presentation, easy but expensive as the ice cream sandwiches jack up the price.  Worth it though.  No changes.  It's a win win win!

Followed the recipe exactly. Way too sweet for our taste. Definitely not enough ice cream to offset the chocolate sauce and whip cream. Will never make again.

This was very well-received by my taste testers.  Easy to make and refreshing on a hot day.  I recommend putting the peanuts on the fudge layer, then cool whip on top of those.

I think the recipe calls for way too much chocolate syrup. You could at least cut it in half. Adding chopped peanut butter cups to it was delicious!  I’d definitely make it again!

My family really liked this recipe.  But, as other reviewers have stated, it would probably work better to make the dessert in a deep 9x13 pan to accommodate all the ingredients and to spread  hot fudge sauce rather than chocolate syrup on the ice cream sandwiches before the whipped topping.  Unless you're wanting the special presentation, hot fudge sundaes are  lot simpler to prepare.

I was very scared that this dessert was not going to be good after making it.  By the time I got all the sandwiches unwrapped and everything cut up, I thought it was very time consuming.  I cut up Reese's cups, Snickers, and Heath bars instead of using nuts.  I used hot fudge because I am not a big fan of syrup.  I didn't heat it up.  I just mixed it with the pb.  It was very hard to spread.  My ice cream sandwiches melted fast and I didn't think they were going to freeze back.  I finally got everything together and stuck it in the freezer.  Even though I had problems, the end result was worth 5 stars.  I will make it again and learn from my mistakes. This dessert goes a long way if you need to feed a large group.

If God has a favorite dessert, this is it.  Super easy.  One piece of advice, we bought 4 ounce sandwiches which were half the size of a normal one, we ended up a box shy.  Just kind of picture the pan and determine what you'll need for sandwiches

Terrific and easy dessert that my young children enjoyed making. I used the Hershey's dark chocolate syrup because it has a richer flavor and a tad less sweetness. I eliminated the nuts at the request of the kids. We used the reeses mini cups and microwaved them for about 60 seconds in the hot syrup. Must stir very well to incorporate.  I purchased a disposable aluminum lasagna pan to get the needed depth for layers, and decorate the top with maraschino cherries (wash them first or they will bleed into your whipped topping!)  Everyone loved it!

I've made a variation of this recipe.  You really can do whatever sounds good to you in the ingredient department.  I put a layer of ice cream between the layers of sandwiches and use Sander's Hot Fudge Sauce (Yum!!!!)  There is never any leftovers!

This was ok, but I won't make it again.  Although I like things with peanut butter and chocolate,  the mixture just did not make it in this recipe.  It was easy, quick, and I made it because I was going to have company after surgery and wanted to do something ahead.

I have made this numerous times.  My family loves it.  I use no sugar added ice cream sandwiches, sugar free cool whip andn no sugar added chocolate syrup (Torani makes a good one).   I don't think anyone notices the difference and my diabetic family members can eat it. 
I had difficulty spreading the the syrup/peanut butter over the cool whip so I reversed the layers and it was much easier.

This is so easy and awesome!  After reading several reviews I too made a slight change. I used 1 jar of hot fudge topping and 1 jar of caramel topping and then added the peanut butter. It works very well when you spread the sauce over the bars and then put the whipped topping on. Definitely a keeper.  I also decorated the top with swirls of caramel sauce and chocolate sauce. Looked "picture perfect ". Thanks for a great dessert

This did not fit in my 9x13 pan. Took 18 ice cream Sandwhiches and cut several to take up the space. Was also much taller than my pan with the 2 layers. I spread the first layer with sprinkled peanuts then whipped topping then fudge layer. Second layer I put the fudge on top of the Sandwhiches , then whipped topping, then sprinkled with nuts. My grocery didn't have the can of chocolate syrup so I used hot fudge with the peanut butter and thinned with some milk. Can't go wrong with hot fudge.

Very easy and delicious ice cream cake. It was much easier to cut than other ice cream cakes, so the presentation was nice.

Decadent deliciousness!  Because I can't help myself, I did modify the recipe slightly.  I put the sauce directly on top the ice cream sandwiches so it was easier to spread.  The whipped cream went on top of that.  I also mixed nutella into the hot fudge sauce.  Oh so yummy!  And instead of nuts, I crumbled Reese's peanut butter cups on top.

The ONLY change I made was to use Mrs. Richardson's Hot Fudge in place of regular chocolate syrup.  I made this for a family cook-out & even my skeptical husband had seconds. Everyone loved it.  A WINNER!!!!!

This dessert is always a hit with family and company. So easy. The biggest amount of work is unwrapping the sandwich bars! I also use caramel sauce and inststead of peanuts I use chopped up Heath bars! Delish!

OMG this is AMAZING!!!  Maybe ice cream sandwiches have gotten smaller over the years, but I end up using 22-24 sandwiches.  I find it easier to put the chocolate sauce on the sandwiches and then the whipped topping.  I chop up the peanuts before sprinkling on.  Definitely let it sit for a few hours so the chocolate cookie of the sandwiches softens up.  My family has named this ice cream lasagna and requests it for EVERY family get together.  Unless you're feeding a large crowd, I would half the recipe and make in a 9x9 or 8x8 because it makes a TON.

I really didn't want to like this recipe. One serving alone has more high-fructose corn syrup than any person should eat in a year. But, I'll admit, this cake's a dream. The ingredients are inexpensive, it takes almost no time to put together, and, let's be honest, it tastes really freakin' good. My roommate, who loves store-brand ice cream sandwiches and chocolate syrup like it's no one's business, said it was the best birthday cake anyone's ever made her. This is worth the hit to your blood sugar. I recommend crushing the peanuts and sprinkling them on top or using chopped peanut butter cups.

I made this as a fast dessert for a party. The concept is good and it's very easy to make, but I wish the ingredients weren't so high in sugars and corn syrups. That said, I did use less fudge and added some caramel topping, and used crushed Heath bars instead of peanuts on top. Go big or go home, I guess!

I've had other "ice cream sandwich cakes" that I liked better than this one. The peanut butter overpowered the rest (and I love peanut butter). Some people rated this highly while replacing half the ingredients with something else! I'm rating the recipe as-is.

Couldn't be easier to make & is absolutely fabulous. Yes it is rich, nit a dessert you would want all the time but when you want to splurge this is a go to recipe. I put cut up pieces of mini reeses peanut butter cups instead of peanuts. I recommend you give it a try...

This is so good and very quick and easy.  I've made this twice now and every time it gets rave reviews. I do spread the chocolate mixture over the ice cream sandwiches first, then the whipped cream top, with nuts and repeat the next layer the same way.  Just seems to be less messy this way.

Always a hit. Always. I usually just buy 2 boxes of sandwiches and fill the pan up with as many layers as I can. Now that IC sandwiches are smaller than they used to be, the number may be off in the recipe.

So easy and good!  I didn't buy enough ice cream sandwiches, so only had one layer and it was fine.  I also didn't have a chocolate bar to make chocolate shavings, so I used chocolate chips and sprinkles to decorate the top.  Not a gourmet dessert, but fast and difficult to mess up.

Great tasting and so easy!!  I make the dessert in a large casserole dish and used peanut butter/chocolate and topped with crushed peanuts on half, and caramel sauce on the other half.  Both were fantastic.

YUM! I did switch the fudge and cool whip layer like others have suggested and turned out great. Plus, I only did 1 layer instead of 2 and found it still very thick. It was a HUGE hit!

This was a hit last night!  Wow, couldn't have been any easier.  Following others' suggestions, I poured the chocolate/peanut butter mixture on first followed by the Cool Whip.  For the first layer of Cool Whip, I added some vanilla instant pudding for extra flavour.  I wouldn't bother next time because I think the flavour just got lost in the chocolate.  I omitted the nuts since a couple of people don't like "bits" and chopped up a Milky Way bar to put on top.  I also drizzled some caramel on top of the Cool Whip.  I've already had to e-mail this recipe out this morning.  Everyone loved it!

Can you say perfection. Everybody I served this too thought that it was gourmet.  Really easy to make and taste like a million bucks. I am going to experiment with different candies (m&m, reeses pieces) grind them up and put them in the chocolate/peanut sauce. I can't wait to make this again.

Pretty good. I think I rather have had just an icecream bar. I am not a huge peanut butter fan but my boyfriend is and he said it was a little too much peanut butter. I might try Carmel on this if I make it again.

Awesome.  I substituted Light Cool Whip and Light Hershey syrup and it was still fantastic and really easy to make.

So easy and delicious that I want to go finish the pan right now!  All the kids and adults loved it.  The only big change I made was to use an 8x8 pan and as many sandwiches as it held.  But I didn't decrease the toppings at all, so it's fabulous and rich!

This was a hit with the kids, but my husband and I thought it was just ok.  I expected more based on the rave reviews.  I like the concept and might layer cookies with a higher quality vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the recipe, it was nice to try it. I will make it again for a young audience.

We made this for our small group and tried to use less ice cream bars (which didn't work) but it was still so great and looked so good that they started singing "All Hail the Roncos" - this went on through dessert! lol A great dessert that isn't fast to make but is easy and tastes wonderful!

This is INSANE! I took the other cooks suggestions and added the chocolate sauce and the caramel sauce on the ice cream bars THEN put the whipped cream over it. This is a very large dessert, it will fill (top and sides) of a 13x9 pan so be aware. It is also very rich so people only ate a small piece.

This was really good.  the only thing I would change is using some carmel on top instead of choc.  I love chocolate but this was a bit too much.

This came out amazing!  Everyone asked for more and more.  I used homemade whipped cream and crunchy peanut butter.  My husband said it is better than a peanut buster parfait which is his favorite ice cream dessert.

I made this for a coworkers birthday today. The ice cream sandwiches I used were small so it took more than the recipe called for.  I also used Dove dark chocolate hot fudge with a little chocolate syrup to thin it out.  I chopped peanut butter cups for the top and it was a huge hit.  It feeds a lot of people and really only took fifteen minutes to make, including clean up time. Very kid friendly recipe too! This is something they could really help with!

On a hot summer day this is always my go to dessert for any office function. Everyone always loves it and I get compliments and requests for the recipe every time (at which point I happily share the wonders of allrecipes.com). I'm not really a cool whip fan so this last time I decided to try it with real whipped cream instead (1 carton of whipping cream, 1-2 tablespoons sugar and vanilla extract to taste). It was a little messier (definitely have to put the fudge mixture down first), a little more work, and melted a little faster but I thought it tasted even better than the times I've used cool whip! Oh, and I usually end up needing about 24 ice cream sandwiches (I must get small ones or something).

How could this not be great.  I did use Dove chocolate sauce for the canned stuff and it made it quite smooth and fudge like.  I put the chocolate mix down before the whip cream as it was too thick to spread on the cream.  It won't last long in my freezer.

Excellent!  I made this with chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches then on the first layer I did the PB and chocolate then a topping of whipped cream and slightly chopped mini resee's cups.  On the second layer I spread caramel syrup and marshmallow cream with heath bar bits.  Then on the very top whipped cream and chocolate shavings.  This was high in fat, high in calories and high in flavor!!! I will make this agaiin and again.

As a peanut butter addict, this recipe didn't quite satisfy my craving, but it was still good. The ice cream sandwiches melted easily and eating the dessert was sloppy. I would suggest Kraft's "Chocolate & Peanut Butter Ribbon Dessert" as an amazing, light, and satisfying alternative to this dessert!

After reading all of the rave reviews, i had to try this one. I made it for my daughter's 15th birthday party instead of having our 'traditional' DQ cake. Garnished with chopped reese's mini pnb cups, peanuts and drizzled a little fudge topping and a little caramel topping and used whole pnb cups as candle holders. Looked great! It was a good dessert, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations.

I give this 5 stars for ease and 4 for taste. I made it about 6 hrs ahead of time and it was extremely rich. We had some the next day & it was better. Not as rich, more "blended" tasting. The only thing I did different was to spread the hot fudge on the bars then the cool whip. Seemed like it would be impossible to spread thick hot fudge over soft cool whip. Will for sure make again.

this was great. after reading the reviews i thought "what's the big deal? this sounds too simple to be so good!" but it was a hit! everyone said it looked like a lot of work, and no one could figure out what was in it--even while they were eating it! they were very impressed when i told them! i will definitely make this again and again! one tip: both layers would not fit in my 13x9 pan--not even close. i had to use an aluminum 13x9 roasting pan. this thing was about 4-5 in  deep and i needed every bit of it!

My family loves this dessert. It's really easy to make and tastes nothing like an ice cream sandwich. People are amazed when I tell them what is in it. I use 29 ice cream bars packed tightly. Enjoy!!

Phenomenal!!  I used a bunch of peanut butter...probably a cup, a bunch of dry roasted peanuts, Cool Whip, chocolate syrup & a little carmel sauce. So amazing. Definitely impressed the guests!

using toffee pieces and carmel and fudge  instead of peanuts/peanut butter/ and chocolate tasted much better to me.  It was the icecream version of the "better then sex" cake

This is the best dessert ever...and so easy!  I made it twice in a week, once for home and once for  a cookout.  Not a slice left.  Both kids and adults liked it and nobody guessed that it was made with ice cream sandwiches!

Yummo!  It was a hit at the b-day party. I used 1/2C pb..simply b/c I didn't read it closely.  And I used toffee bits instead of peanuts cause I'm not a big fan of peanuts.  It was awesome.  My brother said it was the best ice cream cake he has ever had!  So it outbeats DQs!!!

Sinfully good!  I also switched the order of the whipped topping and the chocolate/peanut butter mixture and I also used caramel syrup and pecans.  It came out much like turtle desserts, but with the yummy addition of ice cream.  I would do it again in a heartbeat!

Loved this recipe. I am known for my decedent desserts and when I made this I was told by my husband that this is the best dessert I have made. I too, like others, switched the layers by putting the chocolate sauce on first then the whipped topping. I also forgot to buy peanuts at the store so I used peanut m&ms on the top and drizzled some carmel sauce over them. Will definitely make again. Thank you.

I hate giving this 3 stars but my family and I thought it was just "too much" as in sweet which is quite rare for us to say. Maybe I'll try it again another day and feel differently about it.

This was a little messy, but good.  Make sure you pan is deep enough so that your topping don't spill over the edge easily.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would. It is so good!!! And I would strongly recommend using the salted peanuts! Why mess with a good thing? I'm all for substitutions, but the SALTED peanuts make it so much better. (Anyone had a Peanut Buster Parfait from DQ? This is the frozen cake version of that. And what would it be without the salty nuts?) Wonderful recipe. Don't change a thing!!!

Lots of people liked it, but personally, I thought it was too sweet.  I will use less whipped cream.  In addition, I did follow the recommendations of putting the chocolate/peanut sauce first and then the whip cream.  It is easy, and will make it for a quick dessert.

This dessert was yummy and a cinch to make.  I read the other reviews and decided to opt for caramel, hot fudge and toasted almonds.  Not only did my children have seconds, but so did my company.  I will definitely be trying this recipe again with the peanut butter and chopped peanuts.

This was an excellent rich dessert. Everyone enjoyed it at a family dinner.I only used hot fudge (no peanut butter or nuts). Was not sure if everyone liked the peanut butter. It turned out tasting like a real hot fudge sunday. Perfect the way it was. Will definately make this many more times.

Brought this to a 4th of July party - it was the MOST WANTED dessert - the guests who didn't act fast enough were licking the sides of the 9X13 dish!  Very easy and quick to make!

EXCELLENT!!!! I made this for my picnic yesterday - I don't have anything left!  I used extra peanuts and divided the 9x13 by using peanuts on one side and none on the other for the guests preference.  I also increased the peanut butter by 2 tablespoons. Thanks for a great recipe - it will be made again and again.

Great dessert and super easy to make!  I left out the peanut butter and peanuts and used a jar of hot fudge instead.  Instead of spreading the fudge over the whipped topping I just poured/drizzled it straight out of the jar.  We'll definitely make this again!

I don't know whether it is the ice cream sandwhiches or not but I had a terrible time cutting and getting a decent bite. I thawed the cake longer than stated and it was still difficult to cut and eat. Other than that, it was very good.

I haven't made it yet, but I just had it 2 days ago at our church Harvest Supper. It was incredible. I accidently found this recipe via a review for another recipe. I'm SO glad, as I had no idea who brought this to church. If you haven't tried this yet, DO SO! One of the tastiest treats I've had.

This recipe was great! Everyone loved it and my guests were impressed. It even looked neat. It makes a large amount and we still have leftovers. I thought the balance was perfect but my boyfriend thought you could even add more peanut butter and peanuts on top and it would be great as well. I will for sure make this again. Everyone there has already asked me to pass along the recipe to them!

this was a very easy recipe. i did make one error. i microwaved the syrup WITH the peanut butter instead of adding it. i think it made the peanut butter taste a little off. otherwise it was tasty. def something you could make with kids, just make sure you wait for the syrup too cool (i could see how not doing that would make a big mess!).

My husband said this was wonderful and all the guys at his work devoured it.  I didn't taste any, but he said it held together well and looked interesting.  He said it might be fun to experiment with chocolate ice cream sandwiches.

This was really yummy and SO EASY! I used no name ice cream sandwich bars. I crushed the nuts instead of leaving them whole. I also added the chocolate first, then the nuts, then the whipped cream. It looked great! I impressed my guests!

This has to be the easiest, yet most delicious dessert I have had in a long time. I made it for my son's bday and did as others suggested and switched the chocolate and whipped cream layer.  I also sprinkled one side with peanuts and the other with mini M&M's.  Kids and adults loved it! Thanks.

Loved it!  So rich and so good!  Why I never thought to use ice cream sandwiches this way I don't know.  They are perfect for a ice cream dessert like this.  I did have to use more ice cream sandwiches because mine were skinnier (wal-mart brand).  So yummy!

I've never been asked to make a recipe as often as I have been asked to make this one. Amazing how many people don't even realize it's just ice cream sandwiches. The adults eat more than the children.

A great & easy dessert recipe. Like the previous review said, I also used a 16 oz jar of hot fudge sauce which made it hard to spread over the whip cream, so had to switch layers which resulted with whip cream on the top.

This is an incredible dessert - and so easy!  I made it for a July 4th gathering this past weekend.  My nephew has a peanut allergy so I substituted caramel sauce instead of the peanut butter, and used Heathbar Toffee Bits instead of peanuts.  Everyone LOVED it - I will make this one for years to come - thanks!

Very good!!  For my own personal taste, next time I will not use as much peanut butter.  Also, make sure you use a good quality ice cream sandwich.  It really does make a difference.

This was great!  I made it for a dinner party on a hot day and it was a hit!  I used two loaf pans to make it as it was pretty high, it almost came to the top. I also used more peanuts.
Great recipe!

I made this for my daughter's birthday.  She does not like cake.  We all loved it.  It looked really festive and like I had spent hours in the kitchen, which of course I had not.  Simple & delicious.  Will make it again for sure.

This deserves 10 stars for being simple to make with such a huge impact. I made this as a dessert for our superbowl party and the crowd went wild! Even my very picky Italian grandfather wanted the recipe for this! It's heaven in a baking dish! Great job!

This was just an o.k. recipe in my opinion.  I made it for a teenagers gathering and of course they ate it up, but to be honest if I were making an ice cream dessert, I'd stick with a recipe that I love called Oreo Ice Cream Delight.  I am new to this site and if I can figure out how to post a recipe I will post it there now.  YOU MUST TRY IT!!!!!  EASY and gets the most fabulous comments everywhere I ever take it!!!!!  Try it and you will see.

This dessert was incredibly quick and easy to put together. It looks beautiful, but I thought it had little too much chocolate sauce. With just a little less sauce, it would be superb!

Always a hit when I serve it.  My kids request it for their birthday cakes and adults and kids both love it.  I use a jar of Hot Fudge toppint, not warmed up, and it spreads easily over the ice cream sandwiches.  Then spread the whipped topping on top of the fudge layer and repeat.  Then I topped it off with shaved chocolate or sprinkles.  I usually omit the nuts-especially when serving to kids.

my mother made this for a summer cookout.  Everyone loved it.  I couldn't beleive how easy she said it was to make.  She said that next time she made it she would probably leave the peanut butter out becuase she did not think it added that much.

This is really a good and EASY recipe.  I needed 24 ice cream sandwiches to fill the two layers (used Kemps chocolate chip and Blue Bunny brands).  I also chopped the peanuts and drizzled the top layer of chocolate on.

I can't believe how good this is.  People were surprised when I told them it was ice cream sandwiches.  I agree with everyone else, put down the peanut butter mixture before the cool whip and it's easier!

I saw this one in the Allrecipe Dinner Tonight cookbook and I had to try it.  I did follow the suggestion of putting the chocolate mixture on first, then the whipped topping and it turned out great!  I think it has now become our family favorite - at least for now!!

Oh my gosh!  This is to die for.  Took it to a crab fest.  When I served it some of the ladies wanted to know how I got the chocolate cake in between all the ice cream.  Everyone was surprised it was ice cream sandwiches. Made a beautiful presentation.  I did put the chocolate peanut butter sauce and peanuts down before the whipped cream less messy.  Added cherries to the top which look pretty.  Nothing left but a empty dish and some happy people. Try it it's easy and yummy!!!!!!!!!!!

This was great, but I made some changes. Instead of chocolate & peanut butter, I used butterscotch syrup.  I also mixed the butterscotch syrup with 1/2 of the cool whip for the bottom layer of.  It was great!

This was VERY sweet.  It was very easy to make and it looked great!  I used neopolitan ice cream sandwiches for a nice variety of flavors.  But...the chocolate sauce and peanut butter was way too sweet...nobody liked it.

Awesome and easy!  I made in a 10x14 pan so as to have enough room for all the sauce.  Added chopped maraschino cherries on top and came home with an empty dish!  Totally yummy and will make often!

If my math serves me correctly. 8 and a half plus 8 and a half equals 17.  So why does the recipe call for 19 icecream sandwiches.  I just made this recipe to bring to bridal shower tommorrow.  I guess the extra 2 icecream sandwiches were to make a mini portion of this desert for myself.  It tasted deliscious even before allowing it to set.

Yummy!  I have said this before, there are plenty of good recipes available, so I don't save anything that is less than two thumbs up.  Everyone in family enjoyed this one.  So simple to make.  I made exactly as recipe stated, only thing I would change is to chop the peanuts, because I would like a little in every bite.  This will be my next installment for my 'Dessert of the Month' gift to my brother in law.

This recipe has been the BIGGEST hit with my friends and coworkers!  I am not personally a big fan of peanuts, so I substituted the peanut butter and peanuts for caramel!  Some friends also suggested adding marshmellow cream.  You can't go wrong with these ingrediants!

Oh my goodness...this is SO WONDERFUL!  I always use a full box of 24 sandwiches, though.  Haven't had a bad comment yet on this dessert.  I've also experiemented with carmel, butterscotch, etc. combos, instead of the peanut butter & it goes over just as well (but peanut is still the best).  An ultimate dessert for ice cream lovers!

A quick and easy Dessert. Perfect amount of peanut butter as well. Not for those on a diet. But great if you love peanut butter parfaits

This was a huge hit with company...especially with the teenagers that came.  They loved it.  I will prepare this again but use hot-fudge...I also used pecans instead of peanuts.  It was messy but good.
