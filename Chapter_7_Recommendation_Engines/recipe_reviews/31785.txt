Delicious! We used 1.5 Tbl. dried rosemary per batch and it was perfect! Great tip: Use large metal cookie cutters to make heart shapes or any other desired shape for individual pizzas. It is so easy and fun this way. We made this recipe twice and froze one batch. Simply pat with olive oil and wrap dough ball tightly in saran wrap and place in freezer bag. Use within 1 or 2 months.

Delicious crust.. it's good and crispy on the bottom.  I topped the pizza w/artichokes, feta, and mushrooms. Mmm.

This is a great pizza! We had this for Valentine's Day, and it was a great way to get the whole family involved.

This was wonderful! I made it on Valentine's Day, and everyone loved it! The crust made two medium-sized pizzas. I expected it to be hard to roll it into a heart shape, but it wasn't! I just shaped it into a vague heart shape and rolled each bump/point at different times, instead of rolling it all out at once. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great!  I enjoyed the rosemary in the crust very much.  I didn't have fresh so I used 3 tsp of dried rosemary and just added it with all the other dough ingredients in my bread machine. I think it could use an extra cup of cheese.  I found the dough very easy to roll out and to shape.  It worked perfect!

Really good!!  I thought it was better than the pre-made crusts.  I also added some roasted garlic.  Only thing was that I couldn't (physically) make it a thin crust, which is great for me (I love thick crust) but my husband prefers thin.  But he did like it.

Very nice.  Found it a little difficult to form the heart shape but my boyfriend figured out that even though it was such an uneven heart shape! The taste of the pizza was exquisite.

I love the flavor of the rosemary in the dough! I only used 2 T of olive oil, and I added about a 1/4 cup of golden flax meal - it gives the crust more crunch. We made 4 pizzas with this dough recipe - one full size, two kid-size, and one thin crust small all with different toppings: one kid just wanted sauce, the other kid did sauce and cheese, the grown ups had sauce, fresh garlic, mushrooms, capers, kalamata olives and cheese. All cheese was Follow Your Heart vegan mozzarella. We baked our pizzas at 450. Absolutely delicious!

Delicious crust but hard to roll into a heart or even round shape -of course that doesn't affect the taste, which was great.  Rivaled take-out pizza.

it was probably me...... i used my bread machine...but it was a sticky dough.  it only made two pizzas 10 inches across.  i added the 1/4 cup of flax seed like someone else suggested.  and 1 tsp sugar for the yeast.  so that could have been the problem.  loved the rosemary!!

however it tasted good,  just wasn't the quantity i expected and it was thin.  i cooked one on a pizza stone and it cooked very fast and did not need 20 minutes.  the other one wasn't done at 20 minutes. i will try again.  I liked making my own crust and sauce which i found an easy recipe here as well.

Crust turned out yummy and thin just how I like it and I liked it better than a lot of pizzas I have. I'll make this again.

Really tasty.  I added a bit of salt to the crust and wish I had added just a little more - but other wise I loved the rosemary.  I added some feta cheese too - delicious!

What a special meal to surprise someone with! I topped mine with orange peppers, mushrooms and pepperoni, because that's what my family likes. I'll be doing this often. This is a fun one to have the kids help with!

happened to be out when the dough cycle finished, so it sat for about an hour.  used basil instead of rosemary, and thought it was great!  took advice of another review and used my baking stone. it was  nicely risen, not gooy in the middle and not soggy from all  the juice.  soggy crust is not appealing. i personally liked the topping combo. keeper!

Very cute.  It's pizza, but much more appreciated.  Did something similar, but used a cookie cutter for my pepperoni slices, and I grilled the pizza.  Yum.

Very cute idea! We made ours with cheese and pepperoni. I think the crust lacks flavor though.

I didn't actually try the topping part of the pizza (I'm too addicted to my chicken artichoke pizza) but I tried the crust and it was fantastic!  I did add salt to the crust, but that was the only alteration I made.

You do not cook a proper pizza at 400 degrees! Turn your oven all the way up and adjust time appropriately.

this was a great pizza, but it DOES take a while, being made from scratch.  i refuse to give in and so kneaded it myself.  but the proportions worked out just perfectly.
also, there was no veggie pepperoni, so i used turkey pepperoni.  it was absolutely acceptable.

Don't have a bread machine so made it by hand. I must have done something wrong. Dough was to sticky and fell apart in the oven. Taste was fantastic though. Added a little bit of extra salt to the dough. Next time I will add rosemary to another dough recipe. Because I really like the idea!
