I was desperately wanting to make a "homemade" cheesecake...chocolate nonetheless and was suprised when I saw this one.  It's exactly like the one in an old Taste of Home issue.  It actually ranked as a runner-up in their cheesecake contest so I decided to give it a try. The only alteration I made was to use crushed oreo cookies in place of the wafer crumbs because I didn't have any.  Needless to say, this turned out beautifully...and it being my first real cheesecake, I was very proud of myself. Thanks for posting this Diane.

pretty good, rich cheesecake, although the chocolate topping was not necessary.  it was really heavy and my boyfriend and i ended up picking it off.  if i make this again i would not put the topping on it.

Great cheesecake!  I would cut the topping in half though - it was too thick and weighed down the cheesecake - made it sink.  I'd definitely make it again though.  Thanks for the recipe!

excellent recipe !!!!  TIP FOR TOPPING =make a ganache=100gms chocolate with 100ml cream...this creates a great cream topping. Chill cake completely BEFORE spreading on top. TIP FOR NO CRACKS=use parchment paper for lining of pan (bottom and sides) to prevent cracks AND leave in oven for 1 hour prior to removing from oven once baked. TIP TO ENHANCE CHOCOLATE FLAVOR= a pinch of cayenne pepper. TIP FOR CRUST= if you have no chocolate cookies then use vanilla wafers, sugar, butter and cocoa powder. and lastly, I used 4 eggs....ENJOY ..you'll be a hit at any party !!!!

I have never made a cheesecake before in my life and decided to give this one a try for my husband's birthday.  It was easy enough to make (for a first-timer) and the end result was fabulous!  I received rave reviews from friends and family (all chocolate lovers)!  My only suggestion would be to maybe try another type of chocolate icing on top...I was very, very hard after refrigerating it and it made it difficult to eat.  (It did taste great though.)  You should also note that the recipe doesn't mention that to make the crust you also have to add the 1/4 cup of melted butter to the chocolate crubs and sugar...(I think that part waas overlooked in the recipe.)  Otherwise, it was amazing!!!

I took other people's advice here and doubled the cream when making the topping and then used only a thin layer. (Most of it ended up unused.  Next time I'll just halve the chocolate chips.)  Drizzled caramel on top of that was a yummy addition.  This cheesecake was a big hit!

Excellent cheesecake but the topping was too heavy. The next time, I made small cakes using foil cupcake cups and made a chocolate ganache using one ounce semi-sweet choc. to each oz. of heavy cream. Heat cream to just boiling, pour over chocolate til melted, let cool somewhat then pour over individual cheesecakes.  Ganache will firm in fridge.  Topped each one with strawberry half=dipped in chocolate.  Big hit!

Excellent! I made this for a San Fran themed dinner party and used Ghirardhelli chocolate, reduced fat cream cheese and added an extra 1/4 c. cream to the ganache - it was fabulous!! I also made a Raspberry Sauce with a package of frozen raspberries and 1/2 c. sugar reduced over high heat and strained...it was an exellent addition and contrasted with the sweet cake! I will definitely make this again!!

Holy Chocolate Heaven, Batman!
This recipe was amazing. A co-worker brought it to the office yesterday for a birthday celebration and had I not decided to leave for the day, I would still be sitting at the counter slowly finishing that cheesecake off! It was creamy on the inside with so many other great textures with the crust and solid chocolate topping. We also used freshly whipped cream as a complement with fresh strawberries as a garnish. SIMPLY INCREDIBLE.

This was alright, everyone took off the top chocolate layer as it was too rich & hard, but in my opinion, the chocolate cheesecake layer was too bitter.  I won't be making this again, I'm still searching for a great chocolate cheesecake recipe.

My husband loves chocolate cheesecake and he's said this is the best he's ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the topping.  I used 1/4 cup of whipping cream, 1t vanilla, and just 1/2 cup of chips.  I poured it onto the chilled cheesecake that I had made the day before.  Fantastic!!

I made this cheesecake for a get together we have every year.  We had a cheesecake competition so I wanted something to wow everybody and boy did this wow 'em!  Everyone LOVED it!  The only thing I need to do different next year is make 2 or 3 instead of one :)  I do agree the choc. layer on top was too heavy so I made a different thinner one that hardened into a crisp thin layer of choc on top and then dipped straw. in the choc and decorated with those on top and then made a choc. mouse frosting and decorated the top with the star attachment and a frosting bag.  IT WAS WONDERFUL!

I made this for a Maya themed dinner.  It was a complete success!  Excellent recipe.  Raspberries were not available (not sure why in the middle of August) but used strawberries instead.  I think the two chocolates in the cake made it deep with flavor.  Then the chocolate "icing" on top just gave it the extra punch.  I did pay attention to the thickness of the icing.  I could see how too much of the icing would make it hard to cut.  by far the best chocolate cheesecake recipe I have  used!

This is NY style cheescake.   I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and I always use a water bath when I make cheesecake. My family fights over this!

This recipe was awesome.  I made it for a girls night in and it was gone within seconds!  The only change I made to the receipe was using oreo cookie crumbs for the crust.  I will definitely make this again very soon!

This was fantastic!  I eliminated the extra sugar from the crust and topped it with refrigerated hot fudge ice cream topping and fresh strawberries instead of what the recipe called for (a little easier).

I made this for Valentine's Day and it turned out great! Very easy to make. I actually forgot to put the cocoa powder in, but there was enough chocolate chips in it that it was not even needed. I cut back on the chocolate topping as some other reviewers suggested, and I would also suggest that as well. Raspberries tasted delicious on top!

Wonderful chocolate cheesecake.  So rich and yummy!  I took the advice of other reviews and skipped the topping.  Instead, I used caramel topping.  This was my first time making a "real" baked cheesecake.  It cracked, but that didn't hurt the taste!  Next time I make it, I'll try all the tricks to keep it from cracking.

Wonderful cheesecake! Be sure to follow the given hints. The first time I made this, I followed the instructions and it was not pleasing to look at. It tasted great, so I decided to bake it a second time. I followed the hints and now it looks great as well. It's a keeper.

Oh, this is good cheesecake. I made some changes based on diet and personal preference, but I think what I made is still close enough to go ahead and rate this recipe. I totally skipped the crust, since I'm trying to minimize sugar and the important part for me is the cheesecake "filling," and man is the filling good. It's definitely the cheesecake texture that I prefer - a bit stiffer rather than overly creamy. I used dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet in both the filling and the topping, and I think it tastes great - chocolatey and not too sweet. I also replaced the sugar with Splenda, which seems to have worked very well. Finally, I followed other reviewers' suggestions and only used 3/4 C chocolate chips in the topping and it made for a nice soft topping instead of the hard shell that other people described. Thanks for the recipe, Diane! I will most certainly make this again.

Wonderful. I used oreo cookies for the crust. And thawed frozen raspberries as a topping. It was perfectly creamy and very, very chocolatey goodness-full. I used a different ganache recipe though. Make sure the cheesecake is chilled and cooled before pouring ganache. Set the chilled cheesecake over a cooling rack over a cookie sheet to catch the drips.  Okay--so that said, it's a perfect dessert for a chocolate lover! Big hit!!

Good, pretty easy for a cheesecake, skipped the top layer as per reviews. I dunno, it seemed exceptionally heavy, even for a cheesecake.

I have made this twice now. The first time at Christmas and then again yesterday for my son's birthday. The chocolate topping came out a bit hard the first time so I made a chocolate ganache the second time using three parts chocolate chips to one part cream and poured that over the top. It was fabulous and not too hard at all. I also switched the unsweet cocoa powder the second time with Ghirardelli cocoa powder and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. So much better the second time!!

Excellent! I am dairy free (allergy) and I made this with Earth Balance butter, Silk creamer, Tofutti cream cheese, and oreo cookie crumbs.  I'd followed other reviews and used only 3/4 cup of chips in the topping and added fresh raspberries while the topping was still runny so they'd stick when chilled.  This turned out great! Co-workers had no idea I'd made it dairy free!  I would recommend using a water bath in the oven to avoid cracking and make sure your eggs and cream cheese are at room temp before starting!  Great recipe, I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Diane!

This was an excellent choice for my teenaged son's birthday cake! I received rave reviews, both from disriminating cooks & from professional "eating machines" (my bro-in-law & sons). I used half the choc chips w/the full amount of cream & vanilla for the topping, and slathered one can of cherry pie filling over the whole top. It was inexpensive, and did not require a bunch of specialty ingredients. The texture was like a thick mousse. I sliced in 12ths, and even my dieting relatives were sneaking more 'slivers'. I will do this one again!!

This was really good. Very rich, only need small slice to get my chocolate fix. I used Oreos for the crust cuz that's what I had on hand, also substituted tofu for one pkg of cream cheese.

Great cheesecake for anyone to make.  This was only my second and it turned out great!  I didn't make the topping but put sliced fresh strawberries on top instead.

This one is a winner.  I made it healthier with the following changes: chocolate graham crumbs instead of cookie crumbs, Half 'n Half instead of whipping cream, lower fat cream cheese instead of regular, and I reduced the chocolate chips in the topping to 1/2 cup instead of the 1 1/2 cups.  And it was still rich, creamy and wonderful!

After 10 minutes in the oven my crumb crust was starting to burn. My oven runs a bit hot, so next time I'll only bake it for 5 min.

* As suggested by other reviewers, I didn't bother with the topping and opted instead for raspberry sauce.
That said, I love this cheesecake recipe. It's so much lighter than most cheesecakes (almost like a mousse). I will definitely make this again.

I LOVE this cheesecake. It was PERFECT. The only thing was that I used oreo cookie crumbs for the crust. For a fruit topping I used sliced Strawberries. I make it for my boyfriend's birthday and it was a hit! Do it exactly the way it says because its amazing the way it is.

I don't care what anyone says about the topping, I think it is the greatest thing in the world.  It is so delicious and adds so much to the overall product that who cares if you have to work a little bit to eat it.  I might try to make the topping a little bit thinner, but I wouldn't even consider leaving it off!  In fact I am thinking about putting the chocolate topping on a pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving...

I have never made a cheesecake in my life but when the hubby requests one for his birthday, what else can I do?    I found this most popular recipe and cooked it up no problem.  It was decadent, creamy and the chocolate base was just right.  I nixed the ganache topping as people suggested.  A small crack formed when the cheese cake was cooling which I had no idea was a common issue with cheesecakes.  I am now armed with a bevy of tips the next time I attempt a cheesecake.  This one is well worth your time and easy peasy.

Best cheesecake hands down. I made this one for my daughter's birthday after she told me she's not too crazy about cheesecake. She changed her mind after she tried this one. After reading reviews I modified a little by making a creamy chocolate topping with about equal portions cream and chocolate chips which cooled to a perfect fudgy top and not overly sweet, just perfect. I then garnished with a rasberry glaze, fresh rasberries, toasted almonds and chocolate shavings and drizzle. Absolutely the best!

After reading other reviews, I decided not to make the topping and it still was very rich and delicious. My only issue is that it rose and then sunk in a bit and the top was all cracked. I place some chocolate chips to cover them though and all was well.

Decided to make this for a Christmas dessert. Extremely good. Saw the comments on topping being too hard and heavy. Cut the chocolate chips to 1 cup and then let it stiffen in the fridge overnight before pulling it out a few hours before I was going to serve it and it had softened. EXCELLENT recipe though.

SO delicious. I've made a few different cheesecakes in the past but never a chocolate one. Our daughter requested that for her 7th birthday and I found this recipe. The reviews convinced me it would be delicious. The only changes I made were to use chocolate graham crackers instead of cookies in the crust and then I skipped the chocolate ganache. The reviews made it clear that it would not be needed. This was a huge hit and the crumb especially was a nice surprise. Often cheesecake crusts taste almost burnt but this had a very sweet and soft texture to it. I would recommend this to anyone.

I made this cheesecake for our 4th of July party and what a hit!.  I topped with halved strawberries. The following night I had dreams of eating this cheesecake and awoke to a empty plate at 3am.  My 17 year old beat me to the last piece.......  Will make again and again and again!

Made it...loved it!! I took the advise of so many others and didn't use as much chocolate chips in the "topping".  I garnished my cheesecake with homemade whipped cream and chocolate dipped strawberries (I forgot to take a pic!).  It was so delicious. I took it to work and everyone loved it.  One coworker even said it was the best chocolate cheesecake her ever had! I will definitely make this again.

Loved it!!! My husband isnt even a real fan of cheesecake- but loves chocolate--it was so---yummy-- not low calorie at all-- but nice to plurge once in a while!-- I reccomend you take out the cake from the fridge at least 10 minutes before cutting- otherwise the topping is real hard to cut into.

I just made this for a coworker's birthday and it got rave reviews from everyone (even our manager who claims to not like dessert went back for more!). I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. It didn't stick to the pan. It didn't crack. The ganache was delicious and not hard as other people have stated. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to bake something easy and impressive.

I thought it was wonderful.  It was very rich-- just like it should be.  
I set it out for about 20 minutes before serving and it helped "soften" the chocolate topping - it was a great hit at my house.  Thanks!

My goodness - fantastic recipe!  I followed it to the T and it came out wonderfully.  A friend even said it was the best dessert she had ever tasted!  Note - I used a large pie dish, as I didn't have a springform pan.  I just used a little less filling than called for and it was fine.  I actually disagree with those who disliked the hard chocolate top.  I found it was a nice change, as long as you're expecting it.  Beware, however, that this is extremely filling, so if you're cooking for a smaller number, make sure to cut the recipe!

This cake is INCREDIBLE! I made it for all my girlfriends at school for Valentine's Day - we're all single, so I thought I'd let us all indulge in some well deserved chocolate, and I gotta say, I was so worth it! The only thing that I would have to say is maybe a little less sugar, but otherwise, it was absolute perfection! =D

Pretty good, and very rich!  Almost too rich for me.  I used double chocolate Ghiradeli chips.  I used this recipe, put it in a 10-inch springform, and made the batter of a white chocolate cheesecake recipe and poured it on top.  I tried to swirl it, but it didn't really work.  I ommited the topping.  The two worked very well together.  Topped with pureed strawberries, fresh whipped cream, mint leaves and a whole strawberry.

This chocolate cheesecake is very good, particularly if you use good quality chocolate to prepare it (I like Ghirardelli).  But, I found the chocolate topping to be far too thick on top of the creamy cheesecake.  I'd go with more cream and less chocolate in the ganache topping and spread a smaller quantity on top of the cake.  Sometimes less is more. I also chilled my cheesecake first before adding the topping.  Overall, a very good (and rich!) dessert.

Oh my goodness, this is truly a chocolate lovers dream, so so so good. The only thing that I changed was the type of chocolate, I used Ghirardelli Double Chocolate chips and wow! you can really taste the difference with quality chocolate.

fabulous! fabulous! fabulous!  Everyone loved this recipe.  I used oreo cookie crumbs minus the white stuff.  And, for a sauce I used some homemade raspberry jam(strained seeds from) heated in the microwave.  Yum. Yum.

This is an excellent recipe for a basic chocolate cheesecake without any fancy caramel/coffee/nuts/etc. You could, of course, adapt it and add whatever you want, but I skipped even the chocolate "shell" that other reviewers weren't super stoked about, and it was still one of those less-is-more simple pleasures. It's as easy as any (real) cheesecake can be, and the flavor and texture is perfectly rich and creamy. Definitely bake it in a water bath, or at least with a pan of water underneath, and cool it slowly and completely before serving.

Fantastic recipe!  For the topping I doubled the cream only, and it was perfect - I poured it all on and it made a nice thick topping, & some dribbled down the sides a little where the cake had pulled away from the pan.  Very pretty & everyone is raving about it!

Fabulous!  This was my first chocolate cheesecake, and it turned out so tasty.  Tasted like a professional baker had made it.  Instead of the topping, I made a chocolate ganache.  Instead of chocolate chips, I used a quarter cup of broken Ghirardelli dark chocolate espresso bar.  Also used the same chocolate in the ganche, making it a chocolate espresso cheesecake.

This is a very good chocolate cheesecake.  I did forgo the fudge topping and just shaved some chocolate all over it.  It was very good, and I would make this again.

"where did you get this" "this was the best chocolate thing i've ever ate"..... Those were comments from co-workers. I used oreos instead of the cookie crumbs and i didnt boil the whipping cream (cause i accidentally threw in the chips into the pot) and so I had to add more whipping cream to make the chocolate thin enough to pour. Thanks for the recipe!

This cheesecake was wonderful!  After reading the reviews, I decided not to try the topping.  Instead I sprinkled the top with crushed Oreos.  The only concern I has was that the sides of the crust all oozed down when baked, making the crust around the edge very think and hard.  Next time I will just put the crust on the bottom.  Seriously good, though, just needs a couple very minor adjustments.

Absolutely amazing.  This was my first time making a cheesecake, so I followed the advice of others and halved the ingredients for making the ganache, while keeping the whipping cream amount the same.  This definitely was a good choice, as it was still pretty thick.    It still tasted great even though I couldn't find crushed chocolate cookies, as well, and just bought oreo pieces.  I thought they'd just be the cookie, but they had the disgusting frosting as well.  This didn't seem to affect the cake flavor too much, though (I tried to pick most of it out), and everyone still loved it!

Wonderful!!  The only change I made was to use 4 eggs instead of 3.  I added the yolks when it said to add the eggs, then whipped up the whites and folded it into the mix at the very end for a lighter texture.  Don't skip the cookie crust--it really wraps up the taste and texture of the cheesecake!

This recipe was a great base from which to work.  I don't have access to cream cheese (hurdle #1) so I used fromage blanc and mascarpone.  I'm cutting back on carbs and sugars (hurdle #2) and used agave syrup instead of sugar and for the crust mixed oatmeal, ground almonds, splenda and butter.  I didn't use the topping but otherwise followed instructions and it was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!! Curbed my chocolate cheesecake craving while sticking to a lower carb diet.  Also, since its rich a small 2" square satisfied me.

Awsome cheesecake. I made just a small amount of the topping and drizzled instead of pouring on, and I used the rest to dip strawberrys for the top of cake. Also I used graham cracker crust... but will use cookies next time.

This is the best chocolatiest cheesecake ever!!  My husband loved it so much he wants me to make it for his co-workers.  The only thing I did differently was I cut in half the amount of chocolate chips used for the topping.

Very rich and extremely dense, with a borderline overpowering chocolate taste - and I really like chocolate!  I only used about 1/3 of the suggested chocolate ganache to drizzle the top and it was still very heavy.  This was definitely good, but I think I might look for a recipe with a lighter texture and flavor.  At the very least, I would try adding a raspberry topping to cut the sweetness if I ever made this again.

I only gave this three stars because it baked up so short.  Nothing at all like the picture. The flavor was good, but I hate short cheesecakes. Looked skimpy. I used a 9" springform like in the directions. Next time I'll use Chantal's recipe and just add chocolate. That one bakes up really high and fluffy.

This was a great cheesecake, but the other reviewers are right - way too much chocolate on top.  Was heavy and thick (1/2-inch)and did weigh down the cake.  I am going to make it again today, but without the topping.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and it was super.  Thanks!  Just what we were looking for.

Wonderful, Fabulous recipe.  This one is definitely a keeper.  I used milk chocolate chips instead.  After the cook time I turned the oven off and without opening the oven left it in for 1 hour.  I also used a waterbath which prevented cracking.  I cut the topping in half for fear it would be too heavy and sink the cake.  It was perfect!!  Thank you, I will make this one often!

I'm giving this 5 stars because everyone absolutely loved it.  I thought it was too sweet and rich, though.  I didn't care too much for the topping and I thought the crust maybe had too much butter in it.  I guess it's just not my sort of thing, but at least everyone else loved it.  I even made the chocolate covered strawberries to go with it.  It's a great recipe for people who love extremely rich and chocolaty desserts.  By the way, I like Kim w's idea about pouring raspberry sauce on top!

I took this cheesecake to a luncheon where it received rave reviews. The topping was too thick and hard to my liking, but it didn't hurt the taste. The next time I will cut the topping recipe in half. GREAT CHEESECAKE!

Was very good, easy to make but I did not like the topping. I felt the topping was to hard and thick. You almost needed a knife to cut through, uneven chunks came off when you would take a bite.

Amazing! I took this to a group game night with some friends and everyone loved it. One thing; I didn't have a springform pan so I made it in a 10 inch cake pan. When I was ready to cut into it and serve, I just dipped the bottom of the pan in hot water for about 20-45 seconds and it came out very nicely. No crumbling or mess. Also, it came out of the oven with only one small crack and that was covered up with the topping. No big deal.
This is very rich cake and if a more subtle flavor is desired, I wouldn't recommend it. However, if you are a chocolate lover and you like rich flavors, this is an incredible cheesecake and definitely worth the effort. Great recipe Diane!

This is an EXCELLENT I made this for my family Christmas dinner and everyone just loved it!  It was a very creamy, chocolatey cheesecake!  I did make a white chocolate Kahlua sauce to accompany it. Heat 1 cup heavy cream to a boil.  Pour over 2 cups of white chocolate chips and stir till melted, add Kahlua to taste. I will be making this again for New Year's Eve!  Thanks!

This was wonderfully decadent!  I made this for my boyfriend to take to his company Thanksgiving lunch and he said he had to fight off his co-workers to get a sliver of it for himself!  It was extremely easy, as well.  I would turn the oven off and allow the cheesecake to cool gradually in the oven to prevent cracking, but otherwise, a wonderful recipe!

I  had to make this a few days ahead so I froze the uncovered cheesecake, then once it was frozen I wrapped it in Saran Wrap and then put in a ziploc freezer bag. 24 hours before the party, I simply transferred it to the fridge, until I was ready to put the ganache on. It took about half hour in the fridge for the ganache topping to harden and then it was ready to serve! It turned out great, I followed the cheesecake instructions exactly but did a different topping than this recipe- brought 1/2 c whipping cream just to a boil, added 4.5 oz shaved quality chocolate or chocolate chips, stirrred until blended, spread over top of cheesecake. It looked and tasted beautiful, plus it covered the cracks in the cheesecake! ( I opened the oven door while I let it sit there after turning the oven off).

Awesome cheesecake!  In addition to the pumpking pies, apple pies, regular cheesecake, I made 3 chocolate cheesecakes for 20 people on Thanksgiving, there was none leftover!  It was a huge hit.  Thanks for sharing

Awesome! I made this for Thanksgiving and I was so nervous since this was my first time making cheesecake. I read almost all the reviews (they were so helpful), and used some of the advice offered. The cheesecake was a hit. Thank you so much for posting it.

Excellent except the topping didn't work very well, so the second time I made this I just left it off. It doesn't need it anyway, the cheesecake is great by itself!

Very good. I added more cream to the topping and it was delicious. My family loves it. I didn't bake the crust though, even though I should I have. Still good!

I made this without making any changes to the recipe, and I loved it, as did my entire family.  It was dense and moist and creamy--just the way cheesecake should be!  None of us found the chocolate topping to be too much, although I can see where it might be too rich for some tastes.

This was a huge hit for the chocolate lovers.  My husband was very pleased.  I'm not a chocolate lover, but did enjoy this cheesecake.  Changes I made: I halved the chocolate for the ganache.  I used Ghiradelli dark chocolate.  I also topped with homemade strawberry preserves (pureed) and homemade whipping cream.

Outstanding!!  As per some of the other reviewers' suggestions, I lightened up the ganache topping by using double the amount of whipping cream the recipe called for.  Other than this change, which made for very easy slicing, I made this recipe exactly as written, and it turned out to be the best chocolate cheesecake I've ever tasted, let alone made.  My husband is typically not a dessert eater, and he requested two pieces, one right after the other.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Turned this in to a Peppermint Chocolate Cheesecake with crushed candy cane topping, chocolate syrup drizzle and whipped cream. This was a big hit.  Made the cheesecake without the topping and added 1 oz of peppermint extract to the mix.  Read a tip online to only add crushed candy cane topping just before serving.  You could easily substitute mint extract. Or leave out all extract and make the chocolate crust have the peppermint like the Chocolate-Peppermint Cheesecake Candy Cane Bars found at desertculinary.blogspot.com.  Enjoy!

I had never tasted nor made a chocolate cheesecake.  My quadraplegic brother said how much he loves it so, I tried this recipe with a couple of variations.  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and used a can of cherry pie filling and lightened the topping by doubling the cream and just drizzling it over the top.  WOW!  The cheesecake was light and the topping really made it a decadent, delicious dessert.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for a work event. Wow, it was gone in 20 minutes. I've never receieved so many compliments.
The is a delicious, rich and creamy cake. Absolutley heavenly. It needs strawberries or a citrus to complete the experience. I used strawberries and drizzled with chocolate topping.
definitely a keeper!!!!

Made it - loved it.  Couldn't find just chocolate wafers so I scraped the middle outta a bunch of oreo cookies.  Topping looked like it would be too heavy so I put it in a pastry bag and piped a nice design on the top and threw the rest away.  Yummy, chocolate heaven!

I have never made any other chocolate cheesecake so I can't honestly say its the best i've ever made.... but it was pretty dang good! I made it for a big BBQ at our house, and it was a hit! I had so much fun making it, and it looked great!(the picture doesn't do it justice). I skipped the topping and used fresh raspberries and a raspberry sauce. I also used Ghiradeli chocolate and Pepperidge Farm chessmen chocolate cookies, and sprinkled cookie crumbs on the top with the raspberries. I am about to make this cheesecake again, and intend to make it with the topping this time... should be great.

After quite a few Thanksgivings, my mother had finally confessed to me that she hated Pumpkin Pie, and since she's not a "dessert person" she put me in charge of making something else.  I made this and it was gone within the hour.  Now it's a part of our holiday traditions.  So, thank you for a delicious recipe.  I did tweak it just slightly:  I used twice the amount of cream in the ganache so it was more pliable and easier to cut into straight out of the fridge.  Fantastic!

I omitted the topping, but this cheesecake didn't need it.  VERY RICH!  But VERY good.

I actually used an 8" round pan, and there was way too much batter.  When I went to take it out, it had formed a very large sort of mushroom top.  So I went crazy and cut the top off, to find that the middle was still liquid.  Put it back in for a while, took it out and it was dry on top but moist in the middle.  Turned out great that way.  I sort of made a crumbly topping accidentally just by overcooking it ;).  Haha.

I'll definitely make this again.

I looked for a long time for a chocolate cheesecake recipe that looked right to me...and this was it.  I changed a few things based on the reviews I read.  I used oreo cookies for the crust.  I also doubled the cream for the topping, and I split the chips.  I used half semi-sweet chocolate and half white chocolate. I drizzled the white chocolate over the regular and it looked outstanding!  I also did the strawberries which was just the icing on the cake.  My brother and sister-in-law stayed the night for Mother's Day and I woke up the next morning and they were eating the rest for breakfast!  It was a huge hit!

My husband requests this cheesecake each year now for his birthday.  It is much better than what you pay $8/slice for at Cheesecake Factory, etc.  I use the crushed oreos for crust as well.  It's one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had and I will continue to make.

This recipe is good, but not perfect.  I've been looking for that fluffy, restaurant quality cheesecake for a while now, and this is not quite it.
Despite that, there is a reason why I'm giving this recipe 4 stars!  The richness and the topping are excellent.  Also, if you like a dense cheesecake, this could be the one for you.

This is a wonderful recipe. The texture is a blend of cheesecake and mousse. Everyone loved it when I took it to a family gathering. I used chocolate graham crackers instead of the cookies and it was delicious. I especially like the topping because it covers any cracks so you have a perfect cheesecake every time.

OMG!  This is a wonderful cheesecake!  The topping makes it.  I used splenda and lowfat cream cheese and baked it in a water bath.  I sprinkled chopped pecans on top.  I will be making this again for New Years Day.  Thanks Diane!

The recipe has been revised to include the addition of the melted butter to the crumb crust. We apologize for any inconvenience.

This would rate a 5, but I improvised and think it was outstanding that way and hard to beat.  I used Oreos for the crust and used white and semi-sweet chocolate for the top layer.  The marbled effect looked great and the taste was oustanding.  Also, if you're not an expert with cheesecakes, the topping hides cracks.  It's much easier to cut through with a knife dipped in hot water.  Outstanding recipe Diane, thanks.

Though I'm not a big cheesecake fan myself, I made this recipe for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it.  The ganache on top is a wonderful and unique addition.  Since I could only find an 8 oz. container of whipping cream, I whipped up the remaining half cup and used it as a garnish.  My only complaint is that it was a bit difficult to keep the cookies pressed up against the sides of the pan.  

To MTTC: the butter gets mixed in with the cookies to hold the crust together.

I brought this cake to my church and I got soooo many compliments.  If you are looking for a recipe to impress this is it.  I did add more cream then recommended to the topping, maybe double the amount, and it turned out great.

Very nice recipe and not as difficult to make as I thought. This was my first cheesecake and it turned out great. The chocolate topping got hard and made the cake a bit difficult to cut but I attribute this more to user error.

The base is perfect! Honestly can eat it without any chocolate topping.  I altered the chocolate ganache part of the recipe 1/4 cup whipping cream to 3/4 choc chips and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I didn’t use all of the mixture. Lightly sprinkled with chocolate chips

I used the cookie part of Glutino Sandwich cookies (gluten free) for the crust. Don’t have a 9 inch pan, so baked in a 10 inch pan. Totally filled it up perfectly. This was so delicious. Everyone loved it!

Chocolate topping is rock hard from refrigerator. Cheesecake texture turned out slimy and not creamy. I may have undercooked it a bit though. If I did it again, I might cook until center is just set instead of almost set as suggested by recipe, maybe 5-7 additional minutes.

This recipe is very good. It’s rich and creamy. After making it twice, I made a couple adjustments and like it even better. First, the 45-50 minute bake time is not enough. Increase to 60 minutes at 325. At first, I thought my oven was acting up. But I checked it with 2 different thermometers and verified that it’s accurate. Second, use a full tablespoon of vanilla. Finally, add a tablespoon or little less of coconut oil or hazelnut oil to the topping to make it smoother. Recipe doesn’t say to let the cheesecake cool completely for adding the topping, but you definitely should. Before serving, I’ve drizzled chocolate sauce, strawberry reduction, peanut butter sauce, or topped with whipped cream with a couple drops of mint extract.

Everything great with this except two things:
I would put in a 7 or 8 inch springform pan.  Nine inch it is not a very deep cheesecake.  
I did 1 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips  1 tsp vanilla for ganache topping.

This recipe is amazing! After reading the reviews I used this ganache recipe instead:
3/4 cup heavy cream
6 oz. bittersweet chocolate-finely chopped
1 Tablespoon granulated sugar
?
I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips for the filling and I used dark chocolate chips for the ganache. The two different chocolates balanced each other out. I also put whipped cream on top to give it a little more lightness. 10/10 WILL make again!!

I made it for my Bible Study luncheon.  They loved it.  I adorned each piece with a chocolate-dipped strawberry. My only change was, because my store didn't have chocolate wafer cookies for the crust, I used chocolate graham crackers. I would have preferred the wafers.

Followed all directions, excluding the  topping.  I made my own ganache and topped it with that. It was a huge success.

Very good cheesecake! I topped it with raspberries, powdered sugar, chocolate shavings  and chocolate whipped cream around the edge. I had two issue so though.

It deflated some, but it may be because i overbaked it a little. Also the ganache topping isn't the correct ratio of cream and chocolate, which is why it's turning hard for people. I used 3/4 cups of choc chips and almost 1/4 cup hot cream. I just added enough until it was super smooth. I also just used chocolate graham crackers on the bottom.  It's a super rich cheesecake so this would make a lot servings (the 8 piece we cut it into was too much lol). Will make again!

Excellent!  However, I agree that as written, the top layer is hard and makes it difficult to eat. It needs to be prepared like a ganache in a double boiler or over hot water to stay soft and shiny. I did not run the bottom crust up the sides, and the result was very pretty. Couldn't find chocolate wafers, so I used Oreos...yummy!  Just challenging to crumble. I tried a few methods and found it best to use my Vitamix on a low setting in small batches. I will definitely make this again, maybe with pecans and some caramel in the crust or topping instead of the raspberries, for variety.

I love the chocolate ganache on top -- it means that whether or not the top cracks, no on will know!
It's definitely an office favorite.
I follow the directions as is.

I made it first time for my daughter because she asked for a chocolate cheesecake for her birthday, the last time I made them into cupcakes, all I did was bake them for 30 minutes and they came out great. As for the topping I never made it they like it better with whipped cream on top.

This was an easy and delicious chocolate cheesecake.  I crushed chocolate graham crackers for the crust.  I  refrigerated the cheesecake and about an hour before serving, I added the ganache topping.   Will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this for Christmas and served with raspberry sauce recipe from this site.  My husband is diabetic, so I used sugar free chocolate chips and a sugar substitute. Everyone loved this and no one even knew it was sugar free! Not something my hubby can eat often, even sugar free, but it was a great treat for Christmas.

I made the recipe as specified except I did not bake the crust. I also skipped the ganache on top. It turned out very well! When I bake a cheesecake, I always do a few things: all ingredients at room temp (unless otherwise specified), line the bottom and sides of the springform pan with parchment paper before greasing, use a bain-marie (water bath) to help avoid cracks,  allow it to cool in the oven after the cooking time has expired. I did all of the above with this cheesecake, and it turned out creamy and smooth -- no cracks. Family raved about it.

Great cheesecake!  The red raspberries on top are a must.  They give a great tart & sweet contrast.  My topping turned out a little too thick and it was hard to cut the cheesecake.  If your toppping looks thick, like mine did before I put it on top of the cheesecake, add some more cream so that it has more of a syrupy consistancy.

Love this receive! Absolutely delicious. Some people said the chocolate topping weighed down the cake, which I agree with, but instead of taking it off completely I actually put it over the crust before I added in the filling and it tasted amazing!

I really liked this recipe. I made it for someone with unique allergies/sensitivities to certain preservatives that one would typically find in cheesecakes. A lot of cream cheeses and heavy whipping creams have them too. Found cream cheese without the preservatives but replaced the heavy whipping cream with half and half and the recipe worked out just fine. I did not make the topping for this but instead drizzled hardening chocolate, a mixture of semi-sweet chocolate and coconut oil melted together, on each individual piece before serving it.

Fantastic!  Made this a second year in a row as a birthday cake for my 10-year old son with a few adjustments.  1) Crust similar [9 oz. chocolate sandwich cookies with cream removed, 2 Tbsp. Sugar, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter, blended in processor - baked 350 for 12 minutes] that came out crunchy and acted as a great "shell" for the frosting.  2) Frosting also similar [1 cup. whipped cream, 8 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips, heat cream to just a boil than pour over chips.  Let sit about 5 minutes and stir gently until smooth - cool].  Made the cheesecake as directed, baked 325 for 50 minutes, shut off heat and let cool in oven with door closed for 1 hour.  A few cracks but since you cover with ganache, it didn't matter.  One of the tastiest and easiest recipes I have made, especially since you don't need a water bath!  Thanks so much for sharing.

This was fabulous! I did scale it down to 8 servings because I only had 2 cream cheese bricks. I still used a 9" pan and the result was perfect for us - a slightly thinner cake. I used half n half and it was still rich and creamy. I did not do the topping because it really does not need it. This was a scrumptious dessert to end 2013!

I made this for a family gathering and everyone in the family loved it! The chocolate ganache topping paired perfectly with the creamy cheesecake and crunchy-chocolatey crust. The only change that I made was to double the crust ingredients to cover the sides of the cheesecake.

This was rich and decadent.  It didnt last long after Chrismas dinner. I did add about 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the topping so it would not set so hard as other reviews stated.  I also put dark chocolate chips in the chocolate gram c

racker crust. This is a keeper for your chocolate  loving people!

I loved this cheesecake. It was my first time making a cheesecake, but it came out great. The whole family enjoyed it as well. I skipped the topping because I thought it might make it overly rich and take away from the flavor of the cheesecake. I just wish I could keep the top from cracking. :(

OMG what a great cheesecake!  I made it for my Mother's birthday and she said I can make this every year!  She described it as "like eating one long truffle" and that about sums it up!  I used dark chocolate chips but kept everything else the same.  I did make all the chocolate topping, making sure I iced it around the edges after removing the springform pan and it was perfect.
Thanks ever so much for this awesome cheesecake recipe!

I made this for a luncheon at work and got rave reviews!  The cheesecake has a wonderful chocolate mousse taste, and tastes like it's from a gourmet restaurant.  With the chocolate icing topping, the few cracks that appeared as it cooled were covered up and the cake looked as wonderful as it tasted.  Took a little while to prepare, but well worth it.

This was my first time ever making cheesecake and it was SO GOOD!  I changed the crust, instead using Graham Crackers, Cocoa, Sugar and Butter, but followed the recipe for the cake portion exactly.  When the topping was still warm, I sprinkled it with a generous helping of mini chocolate chips.  It looked beautiful and tasted so rich and chocolatey.  I brought it to christmas dinner, and everyone was beyond impressed.  I'd give this recipe more then 5 stars if I could.

This is a very chocolatey cheesecake.  Very yummy though and I was even told that it was the best chocolate cheesecake they had ever had.  Requires a few extra steps but definitely worth it.

What is the purpose of the butter?  I haven't made it but am willing to try.  Does the butter go into the crust or the recipe itself?

This recipe was wonderful.  It was actually quite easy to make.  It was my first try at any type of cheese cake and it turned out great.  In the morning after the cheesecake had been in the frig all night, I melted a bit more of the Chocolate Chips and covered the sides.  Everyone in my family enjoyed the cake!
