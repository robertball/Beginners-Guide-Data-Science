I've been looking for lunch-time salad recipes for my husband and me.  This has been our absolute favorite.  It's both filling and delicious - and makes enough to last a week!

I've been adding spinach (probably 3 cups-ish of fresh baby spinach) to the recipe, which adds some bulk to make it a meal on it's own.  I've found that almost any veggies I have on hand can easily be added to the recipe (avocado, celery, carrots, etc.).  I've also subbed pecans for almonds when I rand out of almonds.  Super forgiving recipe!

I doubled the Cucumber portion and used sliced almonds with dried cranberries in addition to the raisins for flavor contrast. This was delicious and I will definitely be making it again!

This is my go-to quinoa salad, which I make often during the summer months.  If you can find sheep's milk feta, I would suggest you try it in this salad, it's not as sharp tasting as goat's milk feta, and I find it has a slightly creamier texture.  Another variation to this recipe would also be to use half a bunch each of minced fresh cilantro leaves and parsley.

My family loves quinoa but this was my first time making it.  Loved it.  Did not add the olives or green onions.  Next time I may do so.  I used cows milk feta from traders joe as I'm not a fan of sheep or goat cheeses.
