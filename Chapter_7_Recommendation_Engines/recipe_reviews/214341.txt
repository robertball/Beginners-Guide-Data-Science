I made this exactly according to recipe only I used fat free evaporated milk for an even creamier flavor. This was quite cheap to make because I bought all the ingredients for this recipe at Grocery Outlet My light-dessert-snubbing husband even liked this, too. I think this would work with just about any sugar free pudding and coffee base. I'd like to try this with sugar free chocolate pudding next time. This would be good as a quick pie, too, with a graham crust, too.

Yumm! Good coffee flavored dessert without the guilt of a lot of fat or sugar calories! Perfect for everyone, even the kids loved it- a serving of calcium and no sugar!
