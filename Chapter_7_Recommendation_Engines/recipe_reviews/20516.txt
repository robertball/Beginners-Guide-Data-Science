I love this recipe! I did make a few modifications. Instead of swiss cheese, I used authentic gruyere. I substituted a few shallots for the onion, and added 1 tsp. of nutmeg to the sauce. I found it slightly on the saucy side, as opposed to firm, so I think next time I will add another couple of eggs. However, the basic structure of the recipe is wonderful - it lends itself perfectly to any adaptation. I prepared it the night before and put it in the fridge, and took it out half an hour before I baked it. My guests absolutely raved over it - I served it with a brunch, but it would go well with any meal.

Fantastic!  I don't use canned soups in recipes when I can avoid it (too much sodium and can't stand those preservatives and such) so this is a PERFECT recipe that you can make the healthy way for your family!  Delicious and easy, too!

This was tasty. If you follow the directions you get a wonderful cream sauce. After baking it I found the texture of the cheesy mix to be a little like cottage cheese, I think this could be avoided by letting the dish cool for a couple minutes before serving.

Excellent recipe!!  I cut it in half and made it low-fat (used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, fat-free cheese & skim milk) and it was STILL delicious!  Thanks so much!

I really like to take this to carry-ins.  It's relatively simple and people seem to love it.  I use sharp cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  I also mix it up the night before, throw in frozen broccoli and bake it in the morning and it seems to come out fine.  It sometimes takes longer to cook if the broccoli isn't thawed yet.

The flavor was delicious especially with the swiss cheese.  I used frozen flowerets to make it easier and everyone loved it.  I will make this recipe again.

This was good. We had no leftovers.. I did cook 1 cup of rice in the rice cooker and added the rice in the dish. I also didn't use as much butter as it called for. I loved that this was made with no processed ingredients. I looked along time to find a broccoli bake with no fake cheese or canned soup. Bravo! Family enjoyed it. Oh, I also added some garlic and skipped the eggs all together! My husband doesn't like eggs and after I got so far into the sauce, it was thick enough that I thought if I added eggs he wouldn't like it.

Was slightly bland.  If I were to ever make this again I would had a thin quiche crust to the bottom.  The broccolli and cheese are a nice mix but something is missing...

I first made this dish last year for Christmas dinner and it became an instant hit with family. This year for Thanksgiving I put it into a smaller but deeper container to save space in the oven with the other dishes. DON'T DO IT - it was a little runny on the bottom. The flavor was still very good but for me texture is also very important in food and I feel it baked better in a shallower (9 x 13) pan than the deeper one I used this weekend.

So delicious, but very rich. I use half butter and half olive oil. I think you could reduce the butter as well.

I didn't like the texture.  The eggs made it very firm.  I would have preferred a more creamy texture.  Might try again without the eggs.

I'm living outside the US and far from lots of the canned products used in many Thanksgiving recipes. This recipe is creamy, cheesy and easy to make. I found it to be a great substitute for the cream of mushroom broccoli casserole my mom makes. I added sauteed mushrooms to my dish and some garlic to boost the flavors. Next time I made include a bit of chicken stock too.

I made a smaller version of this recipe (6 cups broccoli, 2 Tbsp. Butter, 1 Tbsp. Flour, half an onion, 2 cups cheese, 1 cup of 1% milk, 1 egg) and it came out wonderfully.  We served it at a dinner for four and still had almost half of it left over.

I love this recipe - it is a family favorite.  I substitute shredded mozzarella for the swiss cheese and I use 4 eggs to make it light.  I also add fresh minced garlic to the roux - yum!

This was a wonderful broccoli cheese recipe.  It served a crown of 10 easily as a side along with several other vegetables.  I did use 4 cups of a really good cheddar cheese - YUM!!!

Just made this and followed the recipe exactly except that I used sharp chedder cheese and added bread crumbs to the top the last few minutes of baking, I just gave it a taste test after coming out of the oven, and it was great!   My husband better get home from work quick before I eat it all!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I halved the recipe but kept the ingredients the same. It was pretty good, might try chedder next time because if you're not a big swiss fan its a little over powering. My husband REALLY liked it though.

I'll need to try this again...mine turned out nothing like the picture above.  The taste was pretty good but the look was just awful...I was hoping it would look more like the picture and come out in "brick" form rather than runny.

My whole family loved this. I used about 2/3 the amount of butter called for, and it still tasted nice and rich.  I think I'll double the recipe every time I make it so we can have plenty of leftovers!

I don't normally comment on many recipes but had to on this one. This is a great recipe. I saw many that thought sauce was too watery. Just add another tablespoon of flour til you like the consistency. Reminded me of white gravy, it was delicious. My husband and children raved over it. I used sharp cheddar instead of swiss and add crushed garlic and cheese croutons on the top at the last 5-10 minutes. Only used half the butter and other half sunflower oil .Very delicious!!!

Good recipe.  Next time I will try adding the broccoli raw so that it roasts in the oven but still retain's it's crunch.  I substituted half the swiss for cheddar cheese.

This is awesome!  I have made it twice thus far.  1st time did by the recipe; 2nd time I used Original Almondmilk instead, ommitted most of the butter & used a mixture of pepperjack & mozzarrella since that was what I had on hand.  The 2nd time (although it sounds funky) was AWESOME.  The 1st version is also GREAT, but I do think that the swiss is a little bland for me.

Ok, so forgive me now but I don't measure and i use low fat versions of everything except the cheese. I took a bunch of reviews and mixed them up.  So I used probably 1/2 the broccoli. I used probably 1/2 cup of margarine, melted it. I then added the onions and cooked them for 5 to 10 min till soft, then I added the flour to make a roux. Mix that up and added about 3/4 cup milk. Bring to a boil, and added cheddar cheese. Added about 1/4 tsp dry mustard and the salt. I skipped the egg because I realized I had a lot less time than I thought. (I didn't cook the broccoli first because I like it crispier than mushy) put it in a 8 x 8 pan and cooked till the broccoli was bright green. Sprinkled bread crumbs over top and cooked on 425 for another 5 to 10 minutes. Came out really good! Next time I'll use more broccoli.

This recipe doesn't need any modifications, in my opinion, except maybe an additional 1/2-1 cup of cheese (we like it really cheesy).  I added a little garlic and a little Italian seasoning, and that was a mistake because it overwhelmed the flavor!  I also used a mix of 4 types of cheeses, but should have stuck with one.  Next time I will keep the recipe as is.

I used fat free evaporated milk and added just a touch of dijon mustard and a teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder. Though the kids didn't like this, my husband and I thought this was quite good.....me especially. A good side for leftover Christmas ham.

This was pretty good overall!  My roommate really liked it; I found it a little rich, but pretty satisfying.  Ours came out a bit liquid-y, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was because I threw in mushrooms.  (They needed using up, man.)  I think this could be really good with noodles, too; I might try it that way in the future.

Really good!  Would work well with other summer vegetables as well!  Cut in half and used sharp cheddar.  I think when using cheddar, you could cut back on the cheese some, makes it really rich!  Will be using this over and over again!

I served this last night and everyone liked it.  I cut the recipe in half (something I do when I'm trying something new) and got in trouble when there were no seconds!  This will make it into my regular rotation!

Our family loved this!  My father in law wanted cheesy broccoli for Thanksgiving, so we took a chance on it.  I think cheese variations of it would be fun to try next.  I was disappointed that there was so much butter in it - in hindsight, I don't think it was vital.  Also, I think this recipe could have used 10 cups of broccoli, or if chopped smaller, even 12.  Overall we loved it!

My husband and I loved this. True, it is more like a quiche, as other reviewers noted, but that didn't stop us. I used a bag of cheddar cheese instead of swiss, because it's all we had - otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Mmmm! Warms up well later for leftovers too.

This was a really nice change from plain steamed broccoli and cheese.  I could only come up with 6 cups of broccoli so I just used 1 1/2 cups of cheese.  Didn't have Swiss so I subbed Shredded Cheddar.  I had an 11x7 dish ready but could see that was too big so I used an 8x8 which was a perfect size.  An additional 2 cups of broccoli would also fit in this dish as well.  An enjoyable dish.  Thanks Leslie!

This got rave reviews from the fam even though I did not have enough ingredients.  Very easy to make and a nice break from steamed broccoli, which we seem to eat at least two or three times a week.

I was a little skeptical of this recipe, but I wanted to jazz up my plain broccoli and carrots and I had all the ingredients on hand...needless to say, I'm glad I did.  It was delicious!  I cut the recipe in half, used Foxy bagged broccoli and carrots (they steam in the bag in the micro) and Cabot Hunter's Cheddar cheese (the best!), topped with breadcrumbs and gobbled it up! Thank you, this one is a keeper.

It's okay.  A little floury.  I don't know if I'd make it again.  The cheese doesn't stay nice and melty as it cools.  It gets rubbery.

Good 'basics' to recipe- here's what I made:  Onions- sauted with garlic instead of steamed;  Steamed broccoli tossed with onions and sesame seeds;  sauce - I added English mustard, Italian herb seasoning and cheddar/mozzarella cheeses  finally for last 5-8 minutes in oven, I'd added chopped walnuts and some extra cheese. Great!

It was very bland. Needed more sauce & cheese in the sauce. The butter was also overwhelmingly greasy, would opt for less for a healthier meal.

Yummm! Made this for a group gathering and it was the hit of the night. Used less milk, crumbled crackers on top during last 10 minutes of baking and subbed sharp cheddar for swiss. The next time, I added cooked chicken and turned it into a casserole. SO GOOD!

This recipe was outstanding.  Like the other reviewer, I used low-fat margarine, reduced fat cheese, and low fat milk.  The sauce was still thick and creamy, probably because of the flour used as a thickener.  Instead of swiss, I used sharp cheddar.  Absolutely delish.  I'm vegetarian, so this recipe is perfect.  Lots of protein!  Also, I am trying to get more calcium in, and the broccoli and cheese sauce are like the best of both worlds.  Next time, I may use leeks and swiss.  Loved it so much, I"m making this with someone in two days!

This is the best broccoli csserole I have ever made. However, I always substitute sharp cheddar cheese, I have never tried it with Swiss. I first made this 3 yrs. ago for Thanksgiving. When I told my mom what I was bringing she said, "Oh Lisa, I don't like broccoli. But if that's what you want to bring..." Not only did she love it, but she BEGS me to bring to every family gathering!

Loved it!  Made some changes, though:  I didn't have Swiss cheese on hand, so I substituted with equal parts cheddar and mozzarella.  I also beat the eggs in with the milk, and added altogether.  (I also added almond slivers).  Then, when it was done, before adding the broccoli, I added 1/2 cup of Feta cheese to compensate for the sharpness of the Swiss cheese.

Very good!

I made the mistake of using froszen broccoli since I had it on hand.  It was
good, but the broccoli was a bit tough as there was alot of the stalk/stem.
Next time I will use fresh broccoli.
My family enjoyed this.

Hey, i made a few changes to the recipe, but it turned out fabolous and my family just yummed it up! All gone in seconds flat.

Ok, so it turns out i didnt have enough broccoli for the recipe, so i used 2/3rds broccoli and 1/3rd frozen peas (i added the peas into the sauce with the steamed broccoli). 

Instead of swiss cheese, i used 1/2 cheddar, 1/2 lancashire cheese.

Oh and if you want the bake to be a nice colour, after the 30 minutes cooking time is up, put the dish under the grill for a few minutes until golden brown. 

Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I also added a ton of garlic (because I love garlic), and I used cheddar as well instead of swiss. I also omitted the onions, as I am not a fan of broccoli and onions together.  I got RAVE reviews, I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

I like the combination of swiss and broccoli in this recipe. Also good with sausage and/or potatoes added.

I just microwaved the broccoli in a steamer for a few minutes, omitted the eggs to cut down on cooking time and used what I had in fridge for cheese-mont. jack, velveeta, and longhorn cheddar.  I left everything else the same and it turned out wonderful in about 15 min.  My family loved it!!  Will cook again!

My family absolutely raved about this dish.  It's a terrific alternative to "plain broccoli".  It's very tasty and easy to make.  Enjoy!

This recipe was okay, not fantastic.  Cheddar cheese tends to go best with broccoli - but for the sake of the recipe I used 3 cups cheddar and 1 1/2 cups of swiss (I always add extra cheese).  After baking the broccoli didn't stay crisp and was a bit mushy... the sauce didn't fully absorb and there was excess liquid.  Perhaps omitting the eggs would fix this problem and help the recipe taste 'cheesier.'  If you taste the sauce prior to adding the eggs it is actually quite good... I may try to make it again with a few modifications.

No one cared for this dish.  It is mainly like broccoli in an egg custard -- nothing special and kind of bland.  I didn't make this with Swiss cheese, so maybe that was the reason.

This was pretty good. I didn't have any swiss cheese on hand so I used cheddar and my 3 and 5 year old loved it! I will definitely make this again!

Our new broccoli casserole recipe!  I made for company and because I didn't have onions or Swiss cheese I substituted shallots and Gruyere cheese. It was fabulous, we all loved it. I'm getting ready to make it for a family dinner tomorrow, by the recipe this time, and know it will be delicious again. Thank you for a nutritious delicious recipe for broccoli!

I don't know what I did wrong, but mine turned out watery and the cottage cheesy.  I went over the recipe again and I did everything as it is written, so I don't know what happened.

I like the fact that this recipe does not call for the standard can of cream soup found on the grocery store shelf as we are trying to eat less processed foods in our household. However, I found that I needed to add some additional spices in order to give it a bit more flavor. I started off using a little garlic powder, then added some onion powder and just a small pinch of cayenne pepper. If you use the pre-cut broccoli pieces from the store, you should cut them up into smaller pieces. Also, we are not fans of swiss cheese so I ended up using cheddar instead. Overall, a tasty recipe - thanks!

I love that there was no canned soups or processed cheese in this recipe!  I did have to make changes since I didn't have Swiss cheese and I can't eat onions.  I left out the onion and used cheddar rather than Swiss cheese since that is what I had but I would love to try it with Swiss sometime.  I also added a dash of hot sauce and a squirt of Dijon mustard (since I add those into broccoli cheese soup and they go great with the cheddar cheese) and topped it off with buttered bread crumbs before baking.  I forgot to add the eggs but it still turned out fantastic.

I used cheddar and monteray jack/colby blend and I added more milk...but this turned out pretty good...I also added seasoned breadcrumbs and more cheese to the top and baked it uncovered the last few minutes which made for a nice topping.

I love this recipe b/c it doesn't rely on processed ingredients.  I usually cut it in half and put it in an 8x8 dish. I use whole-wheat flour and whatever real cheese I have on hand.  To those who found it rather bland, try adding a little nutmeg when you put in the salt and pepper.

This was delicious! After reading some of the reviews saying it was too eggy or quiche like, I decided to omit one of the eggs. I used 1 cup swiss cheese and 3 cheddar because I did not have enough swiss. I used about one of the three cups of cheddar and sprinkled over the top. The last 10 minutes I broiled it which gave it a nice crips browned cheesy top.

Delicious!

I was really surprised how bland this tasted.  I agree with another review it almost had a quiche feel to it, I wonder if it would have tasted better without the eggs.  I was disappointed :(

Great tasting dish. I expected a little more cheese "sauce" rather than eggy-bake (like a quiche) but the taste was delicious, and we will definitely have it again in our family. I used onion powder, cheddar and gruyere cheeses, and whole wheat flour, otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.

WOW!  This was so good.  I haven't gotten a vegetable other than tomato sauce into my 5yr old son in over a year, and last night he actually ate this and loved it!  I didn't have enough cheddar so I used a mixture of Cheddar, Mozzarella, and a Mexican mix.  I also sprinkled a light layer of bread crumbs on the top with some grated Parmesan.  I microwaved the broccoli for 5 minutes since I don't have a steamer, but it worked out well.  The broccoli was still firm, which is much better than all the recipes with frozen mushy broccoli.  Great recipe that has many variations!!

I thought this was a delicious idea for broccoli.  I have made a simular recipe with broccoli, cheese and rice, but this is much easier to make.  I used chedder cheese instead of Swiss cheese  and topped it with crumpled, crisp bacon. Very good!! Next time I would like to try the Swiss cheese for a different flavor.

This was ok, but would definitely need some tweaking.  Between steaming and then baking, the broccoli ended up very mushy.  Maybe it would be ok if not steamed first.  I tried the recipe with Cheddar because it goes so well with broccoli, but it was pretty bland, needed a lot of pepper.

This was very good.  My husband is a very picky eater and he even ate the leftovers for lunch the next day.  I did make a few modifications.  I added cauliflower and I didn't have much swiss so I added some shredded cheddar but pretty much followed the rest.  Thanks for the receipe.

I made this on Thanksgiving.  My daughter is a vegetarian.  It was very good.  I used an American/Cheddar blend cheese and frozen broccoli (thawed).  Turned out great.

YUMMY!  I used 4 cups of cheddar cheese, not swiss, and it was wonderful.  I served it at Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone loved it.

This was a simple recipe to make.  Used shallots, not onions.  The swiss cheese was a bit too sharp so if I make this dish again, I'll probably use a different, milder cheese.  Overall, it was a good sidedish for Thanksgiving dinner.

Good recipe. We're doing low carb so I substituted the AP flour for Soy flour and it worked great to thicken it and bring it all together. Also, used 1/2 cup whole milk and 1/2 cup half/half to cut out a few more carbs.

Next time I will saute the onions before adding them to the butter for another depth. Overall it's a good recipe and I will make again!

Yummy!  This will be added to favorites!  I had frozen broccoli, steamed it from frozen.  I cut recipe in half (only feeding 3 today).  I used Mexican blend cheese.  Other than that followed the rest of recipe and came out great!

I thought it was great. Easy to follow, quick to make, a nice dish to have in your cookbook. I'd want to try and add other veges to it... For the first time, I added some cheese on top to get a little bit of a crispy crust :)

I used 25ozs frozen broccoli florets instead if the 8 cups fresh and baked for 30 mins in a 350°F preheat oven. It was delicious. Thank you for your recipe.

I followed the recipe as it's written. Turned out delicious. One point I want to make is that most recipes do not say whether to cover the dish or leave it uncovered when baking it in the oven. This recipe was the same, so I covered it for 30 mins & uncovered it for another 10 mins.

Disappeared from the pan!  Kids, hubby everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe with a few tweaks,  I microwaved frozen broccoli till 3/4's cooked then used that instead of fresh, added garlic to the recipe, and substituted old cheddar for the Swiss.

Absolutely fantastic!  Will make this again!

I am making this tonight. However I am using cheddar cheese because that is all I have. But kudoos to you for not using canned, prepackaged etc ingredients. I have read through so many recipes where there are practically no fresh ingredients at all. 
thank you, thank you, thank you. My rating may go up after I make this.

Left out the eggs because we wanted it creamier. Used cheedar cheese because it was what I had. Eveyone ate seconds and raved that it was the best cheesy broccoli we had ever had. I browned the onions first, because raw onions don't like me. That kicked it up and gave it a fried/browned onion flavor oh my.

I made this recipe just as written.  It was really good and a big hit at the Christmas  dinner. In some of the reviews, there was a problem with the sauce. Patience is the key. Make the sauce step by step and cook it fully and you will have great success.

Don't forget to use the stalk of the broccoli - I steamed it 3 minutes longer than the florets. Came out soft and juicy. Yum! The texture was more quiche-like than expected, maybe next time I'll skip the eggs and add a layer of breadcrumbs on top for a more gratin effect. Tastewise, delicious! I used a mixture of leftover cheeses in the house (from mozzarella to Parmesan) and had an extra layer of cheese on top that became nice and tangy.

This stuff was the bombbbbb dude.  Used colby jack instead of swiss, no onions, and added garlic powder instead of salt/pepper.  My only tip would be to not skip the salt.  We ate this with brats which saved the day because of the salt content.  Wonderful dish.

I cut the portions in half and replaced the swiss cheese with mozarella and it was good. But the prep was longer than expected and it was a little too cheesy.

I made with half broccoli and zucchini since I was short on broccoli. I added fresh Parmesan cheese to the sauce and topped it with whole wheat bread crumbs and shredded Monterey Jack cheese. I didn't have an onion to use so I added dried green onion and garlic seasoning to the sauce. It turned out delicious and my family loves it! :)

I did not add the eggs, basically cheese sauce but it was very bland. Just didn't care for it. Sorry.

So I made a bunch of changes to try a lower fat/calorie, higher protein (w/some spice upgrades) version of this bake (note, this is not a vegetarian option): 
Okay, so here are my modifications:
Used only 3 TBSP butter, and sauteed onions until translucent/browned, then added  just 4 TBSPs of alternative flour ( I used half oat and half almond ) to make paste, added 1 cup milk  slowly to smooth out sauce, then stir in 1/3 cup non-fat greek yogurt. Then add lite jarlesberg cheese (only 5-6 oz), 2 TBSP mustard (whole grain, slightly spicy is best), 1 TBSP worcestershire sauce, as well as powdered garlic, ground nutmeg and s&p to taste; Lastly, stir in 6 oz of lean smoked ham,  diced small; (all other ingredients and instructions are same); Sprinkled 1/3 cup grated parmesan and 2-3 TBSP wheat germ evenly across top of casserole. Cooked as recommended, but then cooked under broiler for additional 5-10 mins to crisp up topping. 

Here are the nutritional stats for this version:
Serving Size: 1 cup (makes 8 servings)
Calories: 200, 16g Protein, 11g Carbs, 4g Sugar, 10g Fat

I made mine with Tillamook Vintage White Cheddar Cheese, and added chopped garlic at the very end before throwing it in the oven. I loved it. It tasted just like a good Alfredo dish. Next time, I'm going to add smoked salmon, or chicken to the mix. This recipe was simple and great. Easy to adjust to your preferences.

This was a great recipe. So easy to make and very delicious. I tweaked it a little bit-added olive oil(in stead of butter to make it healthy), flour, shallot, warm milk,eggs, 3 pieces of garlic, black pepper and salt(all in the same order). Added some chilly garlic flakes as I saw some reviewers complaining it to be 'bland'. Sprinkled some crackers and baked it! Easy!

The sauce was not creamy but firmer -- I made for 4 and may not have had the right proportions, but it is very, very good, whichever texture you come up with.  I substituted a stronger local cheese, put in a minced garlic clove, cream sherry, and topped with extra cheese and panko bread crumbs.

LOVED this! my 11 y/o daughter did most of it - made a few changes - microwaved the broccoli until tender crisp, then chopped it; only used 2 T butter/2T olive oil & 1 can ff evaporated milk. didn't use onion or salt, but stirred in about 2 c cubed ham, then shredded cheddar cheese & egg. sprinkle w/bread crumbs before baking - it makes a yummy crunchy topping.  I have a thousand variations I want to try!! thinking next time I will add sliced potatoes - kind of a take on scalloped potatoes and ham. thanks, Leslie :)

This was just OK for us, nothing to write home about.  Added a clove of fresh minced garlic to try to bring up the flavor a bit, but was still lacking something.  Maybe next time I'll try a more robust cheese like a sharp white chedder; swiss was just too mild a flavor.

I think this is delicious!  The only things I did different were that I sauteed the broccoli for just a few minutes (rather than steam as recipe says).  I wanted it to remain nice and crunchy after baking so I decided to saute.  It was turned out perfect and still had a nice crunch the next day when reheated. Also, I used a mexican cheese mix rather than swiss.   Will make again! YUM!

This is a really good, the only reason I am giving it four stars is because I think it calls for a bit too much butter.  Next time I make this I will cut down on the butter and take out the eggs so I can use it as a sauce over some potatoes.  Thanks for sharing this, I love that it doesn't call for canned soup!

This is a good recipe and I'm sure many will like it as written. For us, I will need to back it down to one egg next time. The "cottage cheese" texture that the eggs and cheese make isn't really for us. I ran out of swiss and had to add cheddar to make up the difference. Thanks for sharing, we did enjoy trying a new recipe for broccoli.

I don't like Swiss, so I used a melange of cheeses I had in the fridge- Cheddar, American, maybe a little mozzarella. It tasted fantastic and my guests were pleased with this "hidden vegetable" dish.

I found this recipe to be easy and tasty.  My fiance is not a huge broccoli fan but enjoyed it, too.  My results did not look like the picture; the dish looked less "eggy" and more creamy.  The only modifications I made were the addition of garlic, the yolk only of the second egg, and bread crumbs on the top.  My casserole was fluffy and savory.  I will make this again as well as adapt the recipe for other vegetables.

Followed the recipe exactly but used cheddar since I had it on hand. It was delicious! No, it's not especially spicy but it's very kid friendly. I'll make it again for sure but might add different veggies as well.

I thought this was a very good casserole. I thought this was better than the broccoli casseroles with the rice in them. I used cheddar cheese, but I think the next time I make it I will use the Swiss.

Delicious. To make it gluten free I substituted wheat flour with 1 and a half Tbs each of amaranth flour and garbanzo bean flour. I used an extra Tbs of flour then called for to avoid the thin sauce some reviewers complained about. I also stirred my roux much longer then called for. My sauce turned out so thick once the cheese was added I couldn't mix it in to the veg easily. Next time I'll either use less flour or stir for less long. It was tasty though. I made some other variations: added steamed green beans to the broccoli. Sauteed half a red bell pepper diced small slowly over low heat along with 6 chopped baby bella mushrooms, and scallions. Roasted half a cup of crushed almonds which I threw on top of the combined steamed and sauteed veggies. The sauce was mixed into all this.

My father loved this recipe but others thought it was just ok. Possibly because they just didn't like swiss cheese? I'll try it with cheddar or possibly a mixture next time. Good recipe though and very easy to make.

Somewhat bland and would be better without, or with fewer, eggs.  It would be better classified as a madeover quiche than a casserole.

Very good, very easy. Microwaved the broccoli for five minutes (as mentioned by others), and it worked great. Used bread crumbs on top. Husband also loved this. Will make again.

Prepared this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!  I used 2-3 shallots as an earlier review suggested and I also added Corn Flake crumbs to the top of this dish for a little extra crunch.  Will definitely make this again.

Good, but (AAAACK!) too cheesy.  Used Colby and Gouda.  Was ok.  MUCH better as leftovers, which are all gone already.

This was ok, but I like just plain broccoli and melted cheese just as well, without as much work! I do appreciate the recipe though, it was fun to make!

Wow! This was great.  I don't really like cooked broccoli, but I enjoyed this.  Even the kids did with a little rice.  I didn't have the swiss, but I'm sure it would be great.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. My family and I loved it, and our dinner guests went home with the recipe. Everyone couldn't stop raving about it. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us Leslie. I was a big hit.

This was good. It calls for a lot of cheese and butter and that's the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars. Next time, I think I'll try half swiss, half mozzerella. Good recipe! =)

This was okay.  It was very bland.  I think it needs spices or something to give it more taste.

I love it! I used swiss cheese. I ate this over basmati rice. Next time I'm going to add homemade spätzle to the mixture before I put it in to bake. I've also considered adding grated carrot, just for the extra color, but one step at a time. Can't wait to try this out on family or friends.
