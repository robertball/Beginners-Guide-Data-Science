This was VERY easy, quick, and, (best of all) very tasty.  It's a "keeper" in my recipe box !

This cobbler was exquisite. It has the perfect biscuit top layer, and the overall taste was just spot-on. I've tried other cobbler recipes on here trying to find the "ultimate" cobbler recipe, and this is definitely #1 to me.

Sorry but this did not turn out good.  I followed the recipe without any changes including using a 9x9 pan.  It baked for at least 30 minutes and the "biscuits" were still doughy underneath.  The berries were absolute soup with no thickening at all.  I won't be making this recipe again.

Best flavor of any blackberry cobbler I have ever make, and I have made many.  Will be my go to recipe.  I took some of the liquid while the recipe was still hot, before it cooled and set, and drizzled it on top.  Pretty and tasty!

Very delicious!  I'm not sure if the berries should have set up more or not, but it didn't matter.  We had it warm with ice cream and it was heavenly.

EXCELLENT!!  My family loves blackberry cobbler and when I made this they all flipped.  I altered it slightly - we used fresh blackberries and then reduced the sugar by 1/2 that you put on the blackberries and added 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Yum!!

I have been looking for a "biscuit" type cobbler and this is a winner.  I did make a few changes that I think helped the overall taste.  I used fresh blackberries (they are everywhere right now!) and used only a 1/2 cup of sugar and upped the flour to 3 tbsp or as much as it needs to look "thick". Everything else was the same. It turned out not too sweet, with the perfect amount of biscuit. Yum!  MAKE THIS if you like a more savory topping for your cobbler!

Like some other reviewers, I used one half the amount of sugar called for with the berries. I increased the flour in the berry mix but next time i’ll use the amount of flour in the recipe. I felt like the sauce with the berries got a little thick. I made this with wild black raspberries or “black caps”. It was delicious! My fam raved about the tender biscuit style topping. This is my new go-to recipe for cobbler with berries and I’ve been baking cobblers for 30 years!

I always follow the recipe as written when I make something the first time. This was delicious and the right balance of berries and topping. If I do anything different when I next make this, it’ll be a light sprinkle of sugar or cinnamon-sugar before baking.

This needed cornstarch to thicken. The biscuit dough was okay. Quick and easy. But I’ll go back to my grandmas recipe.

Turned out great.  I used a bag of frozen mixed berries instead.  I think it would be just fine with less sugar mixed with the berries which I will try next time.  It was perfect served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.

It was great!  I don't like seeds in my cobbler, so I used only blackberry juice.  I will need to reduce amount of juice next time.  Topped it with ice cream and it was perfect!
