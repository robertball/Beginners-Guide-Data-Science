Too sweet for my family's taste.  I guess it depends upon the sweetness of the berries.  I also find that if you add sugar to the berries, they will make their own juice (a lot) and it is not necessary to add the water.

This is the best cobbler ever and I thought my peach cobbler topped all!  I added a teaspoon of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.  So good!!  Oh I had a package of frozen raspberries that I thawed and added since I like lots of berries.  I did reduce the water to 1/2 cup and the cobbler was wonderful.

I cheated and used store bought pie crusts that are in rolls but followed the recipe exactly for the rest.  This is absolutely fantastic.  Just made the second one this week.

I made this cobbler this weekend with some berries that were in the freezer from summer and it was amazing!!  The only change I made was I used half white and half brown sugar (because we love brown sugar in this house) and I added 1 tsp vanilla to the blackberry mix.  Even my children that do not like blackberries loved this cobbler!! I added it to my recipe box and can hardly wait to make it again~love it!!

I had never made a cobbler before, so I tried to pick the simplest-sounding one. I stand convinced, and so does everyone else who's been lucky enough to be around when I've taken this to a get-together. I am not fond of modifying recipes, but in this one I use Splenda Blend and the results are still delectable with less than half the sugar.Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

Good recipe.  I made a couple of minor changes.  The dough was a bit too stiff and dry, especially after refrigerating so I added another 3 TBS of ice water.  I used less water (only 1/4 cup in the blackberries and added about a TBS of lemon juice and a tsp of vanilla.  I also used slightly less sugar (about 1 cup) just because I don't like it really sweet.

This was very good and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and added a couple tablespoons of lemon juice so it wasn't overly sweet and it turned out perfect. My berries where very juice so I did not add the 3/4 cup of water. Again it turned out perfect. Will definitely be making this for years to come. Thank you!

Made this recipe last night and it was PERFECT! I have been
looking for the perfect cobbler topping and this is it!! The crust was rich and tender and the berries were sweetened exactly right. (I used fresh berries from a local farm) Served with vanilla ice cream but this cobbler is so good you can eat it plain and be happy:)

Loved it but just not sweet enough. Next time I'm going to add more sugar.  I also changed it a little. I like crust on the bottom too so I used crust on bottom and top (store bought). Also painted a little milk and sugar on top before cooking.

Very good! I will make this again and again. I used only one cup of sugar and a squeeze of lemon, just perfect! We top ours with ice cream so it needs to be a little on the sour side.

Never have found a cobbler recipe that we really loved but this was so easy and tasted great.  This will become our standard recipe.  I didn't cut the cold butter into the cobbler and I liked it so feel no need to do it again

Took this to a July 4th celebration last night. It was a huge hit. It is almost exactly like my mother's recipe. So happy to find it.

Great recipe! I made it for dessert and everyone loved it. I also made it Gluten free by replacing the flour with a GF flour blend and the 6T flour in berry portion for 3T cornstarch. Came out perfect!

It took 1 hour for the filling to completely cook with the oven preheated at 400*. I used ready made crust in a glass 9” round pie pan. I added foil to the edges to prevent over browning. It tastes amazing with out the tartness.

Delicious!!  All I could find were cobbler recipes that were more like cake, which makes it less fruity - This was exactly what I was looking for.  I used store-bought crust, so this was quite easy.  I halved the sugar and butter, and it was still out of this world!!

Delicious! However the first time I made this I forgot to add the water and it turned out PERFECT. The next time , I added the water and it was way too runny. Omit the water and it will be the easiest most delicious cobbler ever!

The best cobbler I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did different was laying the entire crust over the top instead of cutting them into strips. I was in a hurry so I just cut several slots in the top and it cooked perfectly. I plan to make again with the lattice strips, it looks much prettier that way. But if you are in a hurry or not worried about having the lattice it works just fine to lay it out on top. Thank you, I'll be using this recipe for a long time. My hubby is very particular about cobbler crust and he loved this one.

I recommend to put a pie crust on bottom as well, cut the water to 1/2 cup, and put 1/4 cup more sugar into Berry mixture. Looks great but a little too tart, extremely runny, and very little bread. With a few modifications it would be perfect.

This is such a good cobbler! I have made it twice. My family loved it. I cut the sugar in half bc we don’t eat much sugar. The crust is dreamy. It’s important to refrigerate the dough as the recipe specifies as I didn’t the 2nd time and it wasn’t as good.

Made it with 1 cup of sugar and it was sweet enough for us and used 1/4 stick of real butter for topping.    I  will be using this recipe for all my future blackberry cobblers because I loved this kind of crust.

Sorry. This is a blackberry pie. Rolled crust? Not a cobbler.

I agree with the reviews, far too much sugar.

I've made this twice now. Once with blackberries and then with blueberries. Both times have been huge hits!  The recipe is simple and not too sweet. The crust is amazing. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top for the blueberry recipe. Yum!! You should try it!!

Cobbler took longer bake time than recommended. It was also needed more fruit than breading.

Excellent recipe!  I only added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the berries and cut the sugar amount a little for health reasons.  It turned out delicious!

Finger licking good!  Made it twice now for my fella who compares everything to his mom's baking!  Each time he has raved about it as the best he has eaten and will not share with anybody! Followed recipe exactly and changed nothing.  Will definitely make again and again.

I had made the dough a couple of days previously, and when I finally took it out of the fridge I didn't feel in the mood to make a cobbler. So I thawed the dough and made mini tarts out of it, put them in the oven at 175 C for 12 minutes, then put the blackberries as filling and baked again for about 6 minutes. Taste great! I absolutely love the recipe for the crust, will definitely be using it again.

Great cobbler.
Made it 4 times in 5 days.  Works great with small "personal" cobblers too.  They all cooked in 20 min or so.
The full size cobbler was great as well.  Added a touch of lemon juice and cut a tad of the sugar as my berries were very sweet already.  Thanks for posting.

OMG! This was great. I purchased ready made pie crust. Placed at the bottom and sides of Dutch oven. I did apply butter to sides of Durch oven. Then I put Berries in crust and topped with pie crust cut in strips with pats of butter and sprinkled sugar on top. Like crust. Recipe did not have enough for me.

Loved this! My husband raved & told me I would have to make another because the rest of the first one was all for him.  My first try at cobbler & it was super easy.  The only change was that I had to let it bake for closer to 45-50 mins for the crust to be fully done.

I pick lots of wild blackberries every year. This will be my go to recipe from now on. I did use a little less butter on the top of pie.

Put the pie crust on the bottom & add a delicious gooey top that covers it all! This recipe has a superb berry mixture but I cooked my homegrown blackberries on med low with the sugar, 1/2 the water, tsp of vanilla, dash of lemon juice, dash of cinnamon, & dash of nutmeg first. Added the flour & rest of water for last few min & it thickened up perfect. After reading reviews about how this version didn't have enough topping, I read a peach cobbler recipe here, & a man adjusted one to include his grandmother's top-and it's what I have been searching for, the traditional gooey type. I put this recipe's rolled crust on the bottom of a large Pyrex casserole bowl, next scooped (spatula needed) the berry mixture onto the crust, then layered 1 1/2 cups of each on top: flour, sugar & milk-Sprinkling some of each alternately, then dotted it with butter all over (about 4-6 tablespoons). Baked uncovered at 400 for 40 min. & then lowered temp to 350 for another 20 min or until it started to brown & turn solid on top. Fantastic texture & best ever!
