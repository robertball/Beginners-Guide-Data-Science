This recipe was the biggest bust I've ever served. Not one person took a second cracker. It was so salty nobody liked it.

My mom has made this recipe so many times throughout her life (she passed away Easter morning).  The person who rated this poorly obviously didn't follow the instructions.  It is an excellent dish to sit out and enjoy with crackers.

The recipe shouldn't be salty. The dried beef has to be washed off before using. Most brands of dried beef will state this on the package. Hope this helps.

This cheeseball is so simple and delicious!  We've been making it for years and we love it.  It is now for those watching their sodium intake, however!

Everyone LOVED this! I halved it and combined everything a bit differently...Instead of  mixing it all in the food processor, I Just chopped the beef (that I rinsed and dried) very finely, then mixed it by hand with the cream cheese and dressing. I did make this the night before as suggested. We all really enjoyed the flavor of this and I also enjoyed the simplicity! I will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
