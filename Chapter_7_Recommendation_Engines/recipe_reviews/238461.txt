This is one of those forehead slapping recipes that you go "why haven't I been doing this forever?". I never thought I could get a rich and creamy hot chocolate using alternatives to dairy milk. I have tried this three times now and thought it was nice but indeed, the recipe calls for too much cocoa. I don't have the vanilla flavoured coconut drink asked for in the recipe so I used coconut milk and extra vanilla with only one Tbsp of cocoa and this seemed to be the tastiest solution. With two tablespoons of cocoa it was thick and rich but overpowered by the cocoa. In one trial I used vanilla flavoured almond milk (which it states in the notes about using alternatives, which turns it into almond hot cocoa, but who cares) and put 1.5 Tbsp of cocoa and this was still too much in my opinion. It is nice to have an alternative to dairy milk for hot cocoa so thank you, spice and everything nice, for the idea and recipe.

The coconut milk I had on hand was plain and not vanilla flavored but worked well. If expecting a coconut flavor to your cocoa research your coconut milks first. The brand I had on hand has no coconut taste at all(So Delicious Dairy Free brand), which is great for coconut haters. For me, I was disappointed - but no fault of the recipe. As is, I thought two tablespoons was too much cocoa. I usually use one tablespoon cocoa per cup of milk. If you like the deeper flavor then two tablespoons may work well for you. Sometimes too much cocoa can take on a bitter taste. Adding more milk helped tone down the overpowered cocoa taste and I ended up with a tasty warm drink on a chilly winter day. Great alternative for the dairy intolerant.

I used almond milk and did not use the sugar. Per another reviewer i cut the cocoa back also, glad i did as it was to me enough of a chocolate taste.A very pleasant drink on a cold day. Thank you for the recipe.

I used the canned coconut milk (low fat version) that you find in the Asian cooking section of the grocery store.  My husband said it was like drinking a Mounds bar!  :)  It was thick, creamy, and delicious.

Having a child who can't have dairy, it's a challenge to make certain treats.  This is one the whole family could enjoy!
