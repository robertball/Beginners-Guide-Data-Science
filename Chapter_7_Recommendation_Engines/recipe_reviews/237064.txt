Delicious! I packed mine firmly into a ramekin, so I came out w/ a pretty firm cheese that had a slight tang to it that we loved. I served it drizzled w/ evoo and cracked black pepper, as suggested by chef John and spread it over lightly toasted baguette. This did not remind me of ricotta, but sort of a mild feta, which really appealed to my ricotta hating, feta loving hubby. So simple and VERY tasty...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was so very easy and I would definitely make it again.  Before putting it into ramekins I divided it  in half and put a little  Old Bay and as much crab meat as it would take and still hold together.  The second half I added a little onion powder (not onion salt) (be very careful and use less then you think) and chopped fresh oregano, thyme and chives.  My husband loves both versions.  More experimenting with flavoring in the future.

Home Run.  I wasn't expecting much from such a simple recipe, but it turned out wonderful. I didn't add any extras THIS TIME, but I'm thinking fresh chives  would be nice.  I used Lemon juice this time, next I'll try the vinegar instead and see if it's different much.

so happy and so surprised! I had a timid heart and kept it plain, but I'm going to experiment with other flavours. Unbelivable!!!

Looking forward to trying this, a simpler recipe for newbies is ricotta. Possibly the easiest cheese to make.

This was delicious, easy, and made a huge impression at a July 4th party. I topped one with oil and pepper, one with honey, and a third with a vidalia onion pepper sauce.  Onion pepper sauce was DEFINITELY the winner. Make it as is and top with whatever you'd like.
