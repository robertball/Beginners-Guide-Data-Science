We served this with rice and it was great.  The taste was a bit different, but we loved it by the second or third bite.  The sauce is key.  Not sure why it's called Kabobs and not Meatballs.

this dish is terrific. I altered the recipie somewhat-omitted soaked bread, used just one egg, forgot the jalepeno, switched cilantro for parsley and baked instead of fried the meatballs-still turned out fantastic.

These were really good.  At first I didn't know if they were worth all the prep, but after they were gone I couldn't stop dreaming about them :-).  The only thing I would change--I know the yogurt sauce is probably more authentic but after I ran out I just used ranch dressing and like it much better.  All a matter of taste.

***
An addition--I'm trying to be more healthy and tried this recipe again but with half ground turkey and baking on a cookie sheet instead of frying.  I also substituted the fried onions for chopped fresh ones.  Still good and I'm sure a lot less fat.

Very good recipe.  The meatballs are good hot or cold and the dipping sauce is quite good, too.

These were pretty good.  They take a lot of work.  I liked the dipping sauce, but no one else did.  My husband and daughter ended up using BBQ sauce to dip them in.  Proably wont make again

These are a good way to change things up with your appetizers. They are different and very delicious. I can't wait to serve them at our 'Final Four' party.

I served this with a mushroom rice and the flavors of kabob and dipping sauce was very interesting. It reminded me of India kabobs that I've had before. I did substitute ground turkey for the beef. I would make this again. This is more of a meal than an appetizer.

I made this tonight, and although it was OK, it was missing some things. I didnt have fresh ginger, parsley, or a jalapeno so I substituted ginger spice, dried parsley, and a mix of green, yellow, and red peppers. Im the only one who likes hot, so the jalapeno was not gonna fly with the rest of the family. Had I used fresh ingredients (+ jalapeno), it would probably have been better. The sauce was good, but again sans jalapeno. Instead of making kabobs, I just rolled out walnut sized meatballs which made it a little easier. Some of the leftovers I put in the fridge, and the rest were put in the freezer for later. I would make this again, but with fresh ingredients.

Made as written and skewered them on sticks after they were done to transform them from meatballs to kabobs. The key is pulling them out of fry and letting them sit for the carry over cook without disturbing. You need to let them "rest" prior to cutting them open of they will be raw in the center.  My only suggestion is to use cilantro in place of the parsley. That is all...
