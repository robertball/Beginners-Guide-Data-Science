Greetings all! :-) Thank you for trying my recipe, and for your reviews. Some have commented on the rice being under cooked, or mushy, and I'd like to address that issue. When I say stir half way through, please be sure to stir completely, from the bottom up and all around the sides. Oven temperatures very dramatically and not everyone has the same type of cookware. For my old oven, and the very large enameled roaster pan I use, the rice did cook correctly. I recently purchased a new gas stove and nothing cooks the same (wish I had my old stove back...LOL). It now takes 1 3/4 to 2 hours in my new oven. With this in mind, I suggest checking the rice more often during the baking time, or adjusting the cooking time and/or temperature to suit your oven and cookware. If you cut the recipe amounts by half, please remember to adjust the cooking time too. While cooking, the rice will absorb some of the spices; therefore the finished dish will not taste as spicy as it does before cooking. The amount of spices listed is for those with average tolerance for spice. Feel free to use more, or less, to suit your taste. Traditionally Jambalaya has more of a porridge consistency; therefore the rice will absorb most of the juices. If you prefer fluffy rice, surely you can cook the rice separately. If you like a soupy consistency, you can use less rice. This recipe can also be prepared in a large stockpot, on the stove top, if you prefer. I find it scorches easier though, so watch it closely.

PLEASE READ REVIEW BEFORE PREPARING THIS DISH!!!!!
This is a first for me all across the board. The first recipe I prepared from Allrecipes.com.  The first time I made any type of Creole dish. The first time I joined Allrecipe.com and my first review,(note I joined just to do the review for this dish!!!).  Okay most reviews praise this dish a few say mush, so I was a little leary upon preparing this item.  I gave a taste to one of my guest who is from a small town near New Orleans.  He said excellent - the only thing the rice wasn't cook all the way & to take the tails of the shrimp but said it was the best.  This is a dish that I would advise that you prepare a day before so that the uncooked rice will balance and the flavor will develope.  Also the recipe was vauge regarding the juice of the whole tomatoes.  I decided not to add the juice which paid off with it being more "ricey" versus "tomatoey".  During the over baking when I stired up the mix I added more creole seasoning(about a tbl spoon), tabasco, fila powder and a 1/4 cup of butter (basically three spats equal to a 1/4 a cup).  In doing so this became the dish of the evening - I never had so many people ask for my recipe. If you can buy a creole season blend - DO IT to make the season mix unless you already have most of the spices it will cost you a FORTUNE!!! In closing, this dish was well worth doing.  1000 praises for a dish well done.  Thank you Joslyn H.

I have never even eaten jambalaya before, but my husband loves it, so I gave this a try.  YUM!  Oh my goodness, this is good.  If you're wondering just how big a pan you need, I halved the recipe because it's just the two of us and it just BARELY fit in a 9X13 baking pan.  I also used your recipe for the creole seasonings, instead of buying ready-made seasonings, and they were wonderful as well.  My husband was ecstatic that I was able to make this for him.  I used little beef smokies for the sausage as another reviewer suggested.  Also, I didn't have the stock, so I just used chicken broth instead and it worked just fine.

This was good.  I just threw everything into the slow cooker except the rice, let it cook for a couple of hours, added the rice and cooked until the rice was done.

Oh yes!  I've never made Jambalaya before but I will be making it now.  I read a couple of Jambalaya recipes on this site but chose this one because it cooked in the oven once the prep work was done.  This dish was so rich...and satisfying! Scaled the recipe by half, had plenty for dinner, 4 lunches, and some in the freezer.  Read all the reviews and changed a few things based on the experience and sharing of others.  1.  I cooked my rice separately glad I did because the broth was so good.  I do think 2 cups of uncooked rice is too much to cook in the dish based on the broth I ended up with.  2.  Added one bay leaf.  3. Added one king crab leg from Costco.  4.  I did make the seasoning blend and it was great.  Only made 1/2 and still have plenty left over for other dishes.  5.  I put my chicken thighs in raw and it worked like a champ.  I did remove the skin and bones after they cooked.  6.  Used ½ butter and olive oil for the sautéing of the veggies.  7.  I added raw shrimp along with their "broth" during the last 15 minutes of cooking so they would be tender.  8. I think the most important thing was that I sautéed the tomato paste for a while.  It must act as a roux.  The only thing I may do differently next time is to sauté the sausage to render some of the fat.  Mine was slightly greasy and I to de-fat, however it was tasty fat.  Great recipe Joslyn H. and thank you!

OUTSTANDING!!!!  Easy and delicious.  I cut the recipe in half and fed my family of 5 with enough leftover for lunch for my husband and myself.

Yumm, I made this last year... had to come back and find it again because I lost the recipe that I had printed. I made this recipe as is. Yes, it serves alot of people. The recipe states 16 servings. People keep altering the recipe and complaining of a bad outcome... why is that? Some of the reviews of recipes on this site are frustrating for me due to all the changes being made. A true review should be when the recipe is made as is. OK, off my soap box, This recipe is easy and very very good!

This was great, my husband loved it.  It took a little longer to cook.  Next time I will cut down on the rice and cook it separately to add to individual bowls. With the rice cooked in, it was not good as leftovers, the rice soaked up all the juices.  Otherwise it was great.

Great Dish for a CROWD! This makes a huge roaster pan full of Jambalaya. Your guest will not be disapointed at all! Very easy to make and it cooks in the oven for less of a hassel.  I will be doing this again for every potluck and family event I attend.  Thank you!

Good basic recipe for this Paul Prudhomme classic.
Use converted rice so it cooks fully and dosn't  over cook the sea food in the prescribed baking time.If you check out Pauls recipe, thats what he uses. You can use regular rice if you exclude the seafood. Made this every day at an oyster bar down south and it transfers  well to catering large groups, or bringing out to hunting camp. Try your own spice blend though and I bet you will like it even better. Best served the next day and freezes very well.

I made this for the 4th of July along with many other dishes so I scaled it in half and this amount fit perfectly in my lasagna pan.  I omitted the ham adding it a bit more of the chicken and sausage to compensate.  The recipe calls for cooked chicken so I diced it up, seasoned it with a bit of the Creole Seasoning Blend and cooked it in a little olive oil.  I have a good make ahead tip.  I like to have things ready to go in the oven when people arrive so earlier in the day I prepared it except I did not add in the rice or shrimp.  I covered it with foil and refrigerated.  I stirred in the rice just before putting in the oven and added the shrimp just for the last 15 minutes of cooking time.  I got a fantastic result this way.

Great recipe....very LARGE recipe...recommend mixing this up in a VERY LARGE roaster.  Next time I would half or quarter it.  Too much for just me and my husband - kids wouldnt touch it!  1st time I made jambalaya and would use it again!

Very good recipe to take for large party, as it makes a lot. When adding seasoning, it seemed like a little too much, but wasn't in the end.
I added a little more rice.
VERY GOOD!

This is so easy and so perfect! It has turned out perfectly every time I make. I pretty much follow the recipe exactly including making the Creole Seasoning Blend. I use a rotisserie chicken for the chicken to save time. I have made this for the last 5 dinner parties I have hosted and everyone RAVES!

This is probably the best jambalaya my husband or I have ever tasted, homemade or at a restaurant.  What's baffling is how simple the ingredients are!  It was also the perfect prep ahead dish.  I sauteed everything, added the whole tomatoes with juice and the meat and let everything blend overnight.  Next day, simply added the broth & rice and popped it in the oven.  I made a half recipe but kept roughly the same amount of meat/shrimp (as my husband is on a low carb diet) and everything still turned out nicely.  Delicious!

This recipe turned out even better than I had hoped.  I can’t comment on the cost of it because all the items it called for I had in my freezer.  I’m not sure how the rice issues some are having are the recipes fault.  Rice rarely cooks the same way twice, is dependent upon the weather and the mush quality is because it’s overdone not due to the amount of stock used.

I did note the issue however and cooked my rice on the stove until it doubled (doubled NOT cooked) then cooked added everything else as called for except the shrimp which I saved until the last 10 minutes.  I didn’t bother with the tight foil on top, just used the roasting lid.  I upped the oven temp to 375 and it was perfect in an hour.  Also all meats were raw when they went in and were perfectly cooked at the end.

AWESOME!!  Don't hesitate to make this dish.  Some of the reviews say it's too time consuming.  I didn't find it to be.  If you're concerned about time you could use pre-cooked meats and just toss into the pot.  I actually cooked my chicken in the same pot I used in the oven.  Thought it might help develop richer flavors.  The only things I did different from the recipe was to use brown rice and I cooked it 15 minutes longer than time stated.  This one is a keeper!!

This recipe has  a great taste, but is incredibly hard to cook. If you make this recipe exactly as indicated, it takes at least 2 times the amount of the time indicated by the recipe.  The recipe also takes at least 1.5 hours to even prepare.  Don't think that I'll make this recipe again just because it's wayyyyyyyy too time consuming and its very hard to make it turn out right especially if you would be an experienced cook.

I made this for dinner tonight. I had to cut down on some of the hotter spices in the mix so my young kids could eat it and rather than baking it in the oven i did everything in a big electric roasting pan that has a lid - I cooked it for 45mins on medium heat and it was perfect. Very nice thanks!

I am not sure whether it was too much liquid or too long of a cooking time but the rice was mushy and there was too much liquid. Also, next time I might add cooked shrimp at the last minute, didnt really care for the texture of the shrimp with this cooking method. This recipe was better day two. Would be better with a few tweaks. Thanks.

Edit: Have determined that using parboiled rice is key to keeping the rice from getting mushy. I also cook about 15 minutes less and use about a cup less broth. Now its a keeper

Excellent recipe! congrats!  I only made two important changes in this recipe #1 chicken broth: reduce to 3 1/2 cups of broth because I assume it was to much water in the canned tomatoes and, # 2 shrimps: fresh shrimps added unfrozen and cleaned at the last 20-25 mins. of the baking time.
I double the recipe for 32 portions and actually served about 48, together with caesar salad and french bread with a cajun cake as dessert.

i only made half the recipe since there were only 6 of us for dinner. used diced tomatoes instead of whole ones, skipped the ham, didn't pre-cook chicken and it turned out great! it came out juicy. a few suggestions though: 1. make sure you use a BIG pan. i used a large roasting pan, instead of my usual 9x13 pyrex dish. 2. like other reviews, add shrimp during the last 15 mins. 3. do not substitute short grain rice, it will get mushy! i used basmati rice to get fluffy results. thanks for this recipe!

I've made this recipe almost a dozen times and it always comes out SO delicious and it's almost better as leftovers! I follow the recipe exact, except I omit the shrimp and add a little more chicken and andouille sausage to make up for the shrimp not being there. I did make this the first time with the shrimp but felt like the texture didn't 'fit' well with the rest. Just a personal preference. SO good! Thanks for sharing this delightful recipe!

This was my second recipe and attempt at Jambalaya. Great recipe but wow is this alot!!! Also after cooking in oven it still was not set up and rice was hard. I was desperate as company was arriving soon. I poured all into a stovetop kettle and cooked at a simmer and that did it. Also do not add frozen cooked shrimp until the end unless you want extra  large shrimp to be babies. I actually added another bag I had in the freezer the last few minutes and they were perfect!! Also my husband perferred the tails removed prior to popping in the pot!! Great flavor, family loved it for days.

The only alterations I made to this were excluding the ham and shrimp, doubling the chicken (which I seasoned with the Creole spices).  I decided to try adding the rice instead of cooking it separately and at 1.5hrs it was cooked well (my oven runs really hot), maybe could use more sauce next time even though I halved the recipe.  Overall great dish, easy and spicy but not too much!  Will be making often!

Great Recipe got rave reviews at a Mardi Gras Party, except both times I've made it it took 3hours NOT 1 1/2 hours to cook.  At 1 1/2 hours it was just starting to get hot.  This was for the 16 serving size.

This dish is delicious! I was trying to recreate the jambalaya from this awesome fusion restaurant in our neighborhood, and although it's not identical, this recipe is a home run. I cut the recipe in half and it was dripping over in the oven in my 9x13 dish. I even left 1cup of the broth out! Mistake, too, because once the 90 minutes was up my rice wasn't quite done. So I added the cup of broth I had omitted and cooked another half hour. Fixed the problem! The amount of spice was right on... Definitely use andouille! I used Tony Cacheries Cajun seasoning. Next time I'll omit the shrimp as they are expensive and I could've done without them. All in all this will definitely be a repeat! Thank you for this one!

I throw an annual mardi gras party, and this dish is a life saver! You don't need to be exacting when you chop the veggies or the meat, so don't spend a ton of time on chopping. There's a lot of veggies here, so if you're not fast with a knife, the prep time will be longer. Also, note the recipe calls for pre-cooked meats. If you don't have precooked meats, go ahead an poach some chicken breasts while you're chopping veggies! Lastly, I like to cover my dish with foil, and put the lid on it. If steam is getting out because your seal isn't tight enough, then your rice won't cook all the way.

Absolutely delicious.  The flavor was soooo good!  I did what other reviewers suggested by cooking the rice first.  I won't do it next time as I found the rice to be somewhat mushy.

Excellent recipe!  My suggestions:  1.  check at one hour, then every ten minutes until done.  I checked at an hour and it was undercooked, but at 1.5 hrs it was overcooked!   My fault, not the recipes, so I still give it 5 stars.    2.  Add the frozen cooked shrimp AFTER you take it out of the oven.  They just need to warm through, not cook any further.    I will definately make this again.  Thanks!

I had leftover ham from Christmas and was looking through the recipes that used ham and I am glad that I found this one.  The flavors in this recipe are just fantastic!  I do have a warning though . . . the recipe says "squeeze tomatoes to break up into pieces" and being that I normally cut them with my cooking scissors, I was very excited to try this method.  Tomato number two did me in, I squeezed it and it 'popped'.  I laughed for about a half an hour because that's how long it took me to get the tomato juices off of my floor, walls and ceiling.  After that, I dumped all of the tomatoes into the roaster and then squeezed them with my hand inside the empty 28 ounce tomato can. 
I will be making this again because it is DELICIOUS . . . but I'll probably go back to cutting the tomatoes :)

I'm not a big fan of this recipe.  I think it took quite a while for prepping it...cutting and cooking all the meats and cutting and sauteeing the vegetables.  It was a $40-$50 meal when made for 16 servings.  I took it to a potluck and it was only eaten a little bit.  No raves and honors.  I love tomatos, but it was very tomato-ey.  I only used 6 cups of stock to cut back on the liquid and so that I would not have mushy rice.  The bottom of the rice came out cooked but the top didn't.  It seemed like it needed to take longer than 90 minutes to cook.

I will stick with a more traditional dutch oven jambalaya.  It is easier to get the rice to turn out okay.

This was really good.  I served it for a Super Bowl party, and everyone loved it.  I baked it half way the night before, and finished baking it the next day.  I did add a little extra stock at the end.

Made this for Christmas Eve to feed 4 kids under 10 and 14 hungry adults; revised recipe to feed 24.  Had more than enough!  Used a HUGE roasting pan.  It was EXCELLENT.  Made it a day ahead and added some chicken broth before warming it up, and cooked thawed shrimp at the last 10 minutes.

Easy to follow and it turned out great!
There were a couple of things I changed: I used beef smoked sausage, one more cup of stock, and Jasmine rice instead of long grain.

This was good, but I've had better. The jambalaya I'm used to has undercooked rice and a lot of different spices. This was good and easy, but I'll keep looking. Thanks anyway.

This dish is so wonderful!  Hearty, comfort food, flavorful, very special treat in our house!  I cook the rice separately (in the broth) like others suggest and then add it to the rest of the ingredients after they have been baked.  If we don't have shrimp, I add more chicken to replace it.

This is the first review I've ever written, and only because this has become our favourite recipe. We look forward to it every few weeks. I've done everything exactly as written including the DIY creole seasoning. The only change I made was by mistake. I used uncooked meat (chicken, shrimp, sausage) and it turned out perfect. I didn't notice til I went to make it again and read it over. So I decided to keep doing it the same because it turns out wonderful. Thank you for the great recipe! Oh, and we cut it in half and the two of us have meals for the next 2 days.

Very nice recipe! I didn't read all 200+ reviews, but I always read the least positive and the most helpful before starting any recipe.  A common theme was mushiness, esp. w/the rice & shrimp.  I scaled the recipe to 8 servings, and this made a TON!!  filled up a 13X9 pan. To keep the prep work easy, I used frozen chopped onions and bell peppers (Picsweet).  Used jarred minced garlic.  Used pre-cubed ham also.  Only had to slice/cut the sausage.  Used 5 of the whole tomatoes and crushed..whole can would have been too many, and no extra juice.  Proceeded with the recipe, cutting out 1/2 cup of the broth. Cooked the rice separately in chicken broth, and during the last 7-10 minutes, stirred in the rice and shrimp to heat through.  This made a nice, juicy jambalaya, but not overly tasting of tomatoes, and consitency was nice throughout.  Thanks for the recipe!

We made this for a "Jazz & Jambalaya" youth fundraising event for our church that fed 200 people and it turned out great! We completely followed the recipe except had to prepare the rice separate from the jambalaya because we lacked oven space. We combined the two before it was served and everyone loved it!

Two stars for flavor and ingredients but too much work just to have good rice and still have it almost/too done. I will make the rice separate then mix it and cook stew on the stove.

Absolutely phenomenal.  I wasn't happy with all my meat choices at my grocer so I just used shrimp and Italian sausage that I cooked separately prior to adding them to the sauteed veggies, garlic and tomato paste.  Since I had less meat, I put in less seasonings, tomatoes, rice and broth (about half). I kept it all on the stovetop so I could monitor the rice. Turned out exactly as I had hoped.

I just got back from New Orleans and fell in love with Jambalaya.  I just had to try it myself.  This recipe is SPOT ON !!  I tried it on my friends for Superbowl and they had second servings.
I have one suggestion.  Some of the writers suggested to put the shrimp in 15 minutes before completed and I strongly disagree as raw shrimp should not be added to cooked foods.  Insatead, cook the shrimp separately and add to the rice 5 minutes before complete.  Also, I added a little bit of broth on the half time turn to keep it moist as I noticed it was drying up and still needed more cooking time.  I also used Parboiled rice. I will definately keep making this.

This was really good! I reduced the serving size by half, yet I still didn't have a pan large enough! We don't own a roasting pan, so as I was putting it in a casserole dish my mother asked if she needed to go out and buy a roasting pan! Since it was near over-flowing, and I hadn't added the rice.. I had her go out and purchase one. Anyway. It isn't very spicy, so for next time I'd add more creole seasoning, some cayenne, something. I'd also cook the shrimp as directed on the bag, and then toss it in once the rest was done, as the shrimp was over-cooked. It was delicious though, and I will be making this again!

Wow was this recipe time consuming!  It was worth it though...very good!  I cut in in half, but the next time I will make the whole thing and freeze some because of how long it takes.  I'll also prep some things the day before.  The rice didn't cook all the way through after an hour and a half so I just turned it up to 375 and baked it an extra 30 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I halved the recipe and threw it in the crock pot for a few hours. It was delicious. I definitely cut the fluids (chicken broth) down to a minimum because of the crock pot, but other than that I didn't change much. I used canned chicken and pre-cooked sausage which made it extra easy. Tossed in the rest of the ingredients, gave it a stir, and had an amazing meal when I came back.

Quite good - Keep the rice separate for leftovers, it gets a bit soggy on reheats

everything was great, but i think i need to figure out a way to make it so the shrimp isn't tough as a result of overcooking. it might be better to throw in the shrimp a few minutes before everything is done. don't follow the times as exactly listed or the rice will become mushed and broken. flavors were wonderful, though. my friends' favorite out of all the dishes i had for a Cajun/Creole picnic!

This was a really good recipe. My only complaint is that I followed the recipe perfectly and the rice did not cook all the way through.  Aside from that, it was very nice.

I was visiting my cousin and he was going to be late so I decided to make this for him - risky since I've never made it before!  He didn't have a large enough oven-safe dish so I ended up having to make this stove top - it turned out AMAZING.  I didn't have Creole seasoning, but concocted my own version using chile powder/cayenne/chipotle and some BBQ sauce.  I only used one can of tomatoes with the juice (I like mine a bit less saucy)and added a red pepper.
I cannot rave about this enough - it's probably one of the best things I've ever made.  It was a huge hit and will be a regular part of my menu.  (Though, he's going to have leftovers for the next six weeks!) Thanks so much!

I loved that you can cook this in the oven like a casserole!  It was good, but the downside is that it is rather mild and bland & pretty darn tomato-y even though I modified the receipe with more spice and less tomato, but it was good and my daughter ate her whole bowl.  

I'm going to make this again on Tuesday for a Mardi Gras party but I'll make additional changes.

To test the recipe out today (before Tuesday's party) I cut the recipe in half and then modified it by using only 1 cup dry rice.  I pre-cooked two skinless/boneless chicken breasts that I had cut into small cubes and I pre-cooked half of a smoked beef sausage sliced (draining both meats.) I added only one can (14.5 oz) chopped tomatoes instead of 28 oz whole tomatoes to my veggies, tomato paste mixture after it were done cooking and warmed the tomatoes through.  I also added a 1/2 can of black beans (drained) at the same time I added the chopped tomatoes and wamred them through.  (I had also added 1/2 red bell pepper to the 1/2 green bell pepper, 1/2 onion, 2 cloves garlic and the 2 stalks celery.)  I added three drops of Dave's Insanity sauce to the tomato paste, but a shake or two of tobasco would be good too.  I will add tobasco and maybe some ground dry red pepper flakes on Tuesday... something to give it a bit more spicey flavor.  I didn't use ham, and didn't miss it.  I added frozen, raw shrimp... a nice good medium size and they were good... I might add more shrimp next time.  

I layered everything int

VERY GOOD, I OMITTED OR CHANGED SOME INGREDIENTS BECAUSE I RAN OUT OR FORGOT TO GET THEM . THE PAPRIKA WAS 1 TBS SHORT SO I ADDED A VERY LITLE BIT OF HOT PEPPER POWDER . I DID NOT ADD WHITE PEPPER  OR ONION POWDER , I USED REGULAR SWEET SAUSAGE . THE SAUSAGE WAS FINE BECAUSE  THE HAM  TOOK ON A NEW FLAVOR AND IT ALMOSTED TASTED LIKE THE OTHER SAUSAGE . THIS RECIPE MAKES ALOT SO I HAD TO PUT IT IN A BIG POT THAT WENT IN THE OVEN , I HAVE PLENTY OF LEFT OVER AND I HAD FIVE PEOPLE FOR DINNER  . SO IF YOU DO NOT NEED THAT MUCH THEN HALF THIS . ALSO THE CREOLE SEASONING WAS MORE THEN ENOUGH , YOU WILL HAVE LEFT OVER. THERE IS A TOTAL OF 20 TBS IN THE RECIPE AND YOU ONLY USE THREE. SO IF YOU FALL SHORT ON SOME SPICES YOU  MIGHT JUST MAKE IT IF YOU CUT THE RECIPE BACK . EVERYONE ENJOYED IT. I CANT WAIT TO SEE IF THE LEFT OVERS TASTE JUST AS GOOD OR MAYBE BETTER, MY WAY WAS A LITTLE SPICY  IM SURE THE RED PEPPER ( MY CHANGE )  ADDED TO THAT SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD IT OR OMIT IT DEPENDING ON YOUR TASTE  .. GOOD JOB

Very good.  With reduced proportions to serve 6 it fit perfectly in a 9x13 pan and adjusted the cook time to 30 minutes and the consistancy was perfect.

Very good!  My husband loved it.  I did not make the creole seasoning.  I just bought my own already made.  Not as spicy, I think.  We had company that does not like spicy food.

Made the recipe as is. Loved it! Will definitely make it again. Other reviewers have said it was difficult, or time consuming. Compared to other recipes, I didn't think so at all.  Plus, it made a huge batch, so I was able to freeze some for another future dinner.

This was the best jambalaya I have ever had! I only had medium grain rice, and some diced and stewed tomatoes in the cupboard that I used instead of the whole tomatoes, and I added canned cut okra but other than that I stuck to the recipe including making the suggested creole seasoning blend and it was so fantastic. Yes it made a large portion but it will be a perfect freezer meal as well for when I don't want to cook next. I thought it called for quite abit of meats but I did it anyway and it wasn't too much at all in proportion to the rice. I am very impressed with the recipe and will be making it again.

I was in the mood for Jambalaya and came across this recipe. I have a crock pot recipe that I use when we go camping but this one will be my home recipe. I was going to only make 1/2 the recipe but with the amount of meat I had out I decided to make the full portion. Oh my. The roasting pan I had wasn't big enough so I had to use two restaurant pans my husband uses for his smoker. I used diced tomatoes instead and could have used a 4th one but I only had 3. No big deal. I made the creole seasoning mix that was in the footnote since I already had all the ingredients. That blend had just the right amount of heat for me and really brought out the flavors. It was far better than the creole mix you buy from a store. This recipe was so delicious. When I get a " good" from my husband I know it is good. lol. I was a little iffy about the baking of it but it came out just right......with LOTS of leftovers. Will absolutely make this again.

Just the right amount of heat.  Followed the recipe pretty close - did use the suggested spice blend recipe which was very good.  Cooked my rice separately  - personal choice because I used brown rice -  which left extra broth.  I just ladled out the extra broth (which made a wonderful spicy tomato soup for lunch the next day) and added the rice and uncooked shrimp about 15 minutes from the end.  My guests loved it!

Good recipe.  It made a VERY generous 16 people serving.  Four people have eaten generously for 2 meals so far, and there's barely a dent.  First time I'm making it from scratch (have used mixes in the past), and it's SOooooo....much better than the mix.  Used regular beef smoked sausage (the andouille was very high priced at the store) and it was fine.  Thanks.

Made as written except for using RoTel Diced Tomatoes & Green Chiles and brown rice. The recipe was halved, and a 4 qt. baking dish worked perfectly. The bake time was 1-3/4 hrs. We mainly made this recipe to see how we liked this oven version since large gatherings sometimes creates a shortage of stovetop space. We wouldn’t hesitate to make this for a large group but prefer another stove top jambalaya when making a family sized meal. We use a slightly modified version of Creole Seasoning Blend by Joslyn in many dishes, and it is exceptional. Joslyn, thank you for two fine recipes.

This recipe is so good, and it's relatively easy to make. I made the creole seasoning linked to this recipe, but I omitted the cayenne for my spice-challenged family. I also used smoked sausage instead of andouille. This is an enormous recipe, so next time I will definitely cut in half (and still have leftovers I'm sure). Very tasty!

This worked brilliantly and was a huge hit at my party. I used chorizo as andouille is unavailable in England. I also used cajun seasoning (ditto) but I have actually eaten Jambalaya in New Orleans and this tasted authentic to me. I've also adapted it for the slow cooker - I use brown rice in the crock as you end up with a better consistency somehow. It was a happy but accidental doscovery.

This is a great recipe!  Delicious. I didn't end up putting it in the oven though, just left it in the pot and left on low heat in the pot and it turned out perfect. For the rice, I half cooked it as the recipe on the box stated, then put the rice and water in the Jumbalaya with the tomatoes and it wasn't mushy at all. Thank you for a great meal!

I loved this recipe - I made a few substitutions - instead of addding shrimp, I added additional sausage and chicken.  I used Johnson's chicken sausage (italain/hot variety).  I also made my own creole seasoning by searching for Emeril's recipe, also on the web.  Made this in my dutch oven and my whole family loved it - I halved the recipe and still had tons of left overs.

This was my first attempt at Jambalaya, and it turned out great!  I tossed everything but the rice in the slow cooker for a couple of hours, then cooked the rice and served the Jambalaya over it.  This dish was too spicy for my kids, though, so next time will decrease the spices.  I don't expect the flavor to diminish at all!

This turned out very good.  The only change I would make in the future is to leave out the shrimp until the final 20 minutes.  The shrimp were definitely over done.  Other than that, a big hit!

I quartered this recipe for the 2 of us and have enough leftovers for one. I only added 1/3 of the tomato juices and used Cajun seasoning instead of Creole. The rice was just perfect.

The cooking times on this recipe are WAY off!  If this dish is going to be in the oven for 1 1/2 hours there is no reason to use pre-cooked meat, especially shrimp.  When I took it out of the oven, the rice was so overcooked and mushy, the shrimp was shriveled and dry, and the chicken wasn't moist at all.  Next time I will use raw chicken, and I will add the rice 20-30 minutes before the end.  I will also use raw shrimp and those only need maybe 7-10 minutes to cook altogether.

Never had Jambalaya before so not sure what it's supposed taste like but this was very good. I added my chicken and sausage in raw and added the raw shrimp in the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Everything cooked perfectly, I'd think the meat would be way too dried out if you pre-cook them.

I made this recipe for my husbands potluck luncheon at work.   I used 6 bayleafs, twice the amount of Creole seasoning and one can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the second can of whole tomatoes.  I also used 2 peppers instead of one and made it with chicken and sausage only, no ham or shrimps. I used about 4 chicken breast and 1 1/2 rings of smoked sausage  It tasted wonderful and was cooked perfectly! Dicing all the veggies was really the only work about it all. I will certainly make this again!

The recipes tasted very good but it took longer then 45 minutes to prepare everything.  The issue was like everyone else, the rice came out terrible even if we stirred it frequently.  It was either mushy in some places and raw in others.  Next time we'll make the rice separately and I think it will be delicious.

Wow, this was absolutely amazing and so rich and flavorful. My mom and I made this delicious recipe without the ham, but added more chicken and andouille and it was still so good. Our family of 5 constantly raved about how amazing it was. We cooked the rice separate only because I like  fluffy rice. This is definitely a keeper and I am looking forward to the next time we make it!

Fantastic recipe!  So easy to make and picky kid friendly.  I halved the recipe on all the ingredients except for the bell pepper which i used 1/2 half red and green, used the full amount of creole seasoning, used 1 spanish onion, used 1/2 butter and 1/2 extra virgin olive oil to saute the veggies, 3 stalks of celery, 1 bay leaf, left the shrimp out, used four boneless chicken breast, 1lb of polish keilbasa and 1lb of smoked ham. I have tried it with rice suggested and it was wonderful, but i have also tried it with minute rice adding 3 cups at last 30 minutes and great results again.  Thanks Joslyn for a great base recipe that i can adjust and make it my own.

I had a bunch of my guy friends over for a football game. I was worried that these guys might not eat something too "exotic"(for guys in the Midwest anyway), but they all loved it! I would put more meat/seafood in it though.

Absolutely fantastic.  I stuck to the recipe exactly, made it a day ahead, and just added another can of chicken broth when I reheated it to thin it out a little.  The rice and shrimp both cooked perfectly for me.

This is excellent!  It has the perfect amount of spice and flavor.  You've got to plan ahead because of the amount of time it takes to bake, but it is well worth the wait.  There is rarely a meal I can make that everybody loves, but this one was loved by everyone.

After reading the reviews, I decided to cook the rice on the side and then ladle the jambalaya over it.  After one hour of cooking in the oven I stirred the jambalaya and at that point added uncooked jumbo shrimp. One half hour later they were perfectly cooked.  Next time I make this I will use dark meat chicken because I like it better and feel that it would have been more moist.  This is a great recipe for entertaining because I mixed everything(except shrimp) together the day before and baked it while guests were here the next day.  No muss, no fuss.

I modified the recipe by half and still had alot. To save time, Spice Islands makes a terrific Louisiana Style Cajun Seasoning, found in the spices section of your store (I'm in Southern Calif). To avoid the mishaps of others, I reduced the liquid just a tad so my rice wouldn't be soggy. The comments of others really helps.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Very tasty. Despite having very mushy rice, this dish was a hit at my Christmas Open House. Next time I will cook the rice separately and add at the end. Also, the Creole Seasonings Blend absolutely rocks! I used extra.

We enjoyed this.  I was worried that my husband would find it too spicy but he especially liked it.  I cut the recipe in half and cooked skinless boneless chicken highs in with all the ingredients.  When they were done I removed them to take the meat off the bone.  I put the meat back in with the raw thawed shrimp and a bit more broth.  Stirred everything back together and cooked about 15 minutes more.  I think doing the chicken this way added depth to the flavor and resulted in chicken  that wasn't dry as has happened to me before with other jambalaya recipes.  I'll be making it for a crowd of 13 in a few weeks and plan to do as another reviewer did and cook the tomato base the day before and store with the ham and sausage in it.  I'll heat that up before I put it in with the rice and chicken thighs to bake.

I was pressed for time so substituted canned chicken. I also substituted cooked beef sausage for andouille. Instead of cooking the rice in the oven in the roaster pan I did it on the stove top using the 7 cups of chicken stock while the other ingredients were heating in the oven. I added the shrimp just before I put in the cooked rice. We don't do bell peppers so I substituted cubed zucchini squash and added this along with the shrimp and rice. After 30 minutes it was steaming, the shrimp and squash were done and the tomato spice flavoring was incorporated into the cooked rice. There was no need to watch and stir the roaster pan. Next time I will just add canned peeled, diced tomatoes instead of squishing the whole tomatoes. The creole spice mix was really easy to make since I already had the ingredients and I now have it pre-mixed for the next time I cook this recipe. My family loved it!

I have made this recipe for quite a number of years and agree with the person who submitted the recipe that you just need to stir well half way through and make the minor adjustments to your cooking time depending on your oven.  Every time I serve this dish it gets rave reviews and I have served it at large BBQ parties on numerous occasions.

This was very tasty, I did cook the rice separate which was tasty but think I may try it in the dish the next time. Also while jambalaya is spicy if you don't like any spice leaving the rice out would help curve the heat.

I give this 5 stars for flavor.  I made the creole seasoning which was perfect!  I added 2 more green peppers to which thank goodness I did!  Next time I make this I will only put in 2 cups of rice, as all the rice absorbed to much of the juice.  I will certainly make this again, but only with 2, maybe.....2 1/2 cups rice tops.

This was GREAT!
I wanted a much smaller batch, however, and when I decreased the servings it became very difficult, so I made it using the following quantities, and it is about right for four people:
3 heaping tablespoons butter
1 large onion, diced
2 stalks chopped celery
1 tblspn minced garlic
1 16 oz can tomato sauce
1 16 oz can diced tomatoes
1 cup chopped ham
4 Italian sausages, peeled, split, sliced 1/2".  I used mild.
1 13 oz can cooked chicken breast meat
1 14.5 oz can chicken stock
1 cup frozen shrimp
1 1/2 cups uncooked rice.
1 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 tsp Creole seasoning
1 bay leaf

I did not have any green pepper, so skipped that.
I made my creole seasoning per the footnoted recipe, but HALFED the black, white and cayenne pepper because my better half does not like things too hot.  

I sautéed in a regular baking pan per directions, then add the other ingredients to that pan, put the lid on and baked as directed.

Wife LOVED this, and I am making it again for our next family get-together.

will never make it again and cannot recommend it at all.  I made the spice mix as per instructions on the site and cooked it as per instructions.  Tastes terrible and glutinous.

Really good and pretty easy.  Sauted in olive oil.  Used diced tomatoes.  Took longer to cook than stated.  Think it might have been double. Add a little Tabasco.

Wow, this was easily the best jambalaya I've ever made.  It was easy, too.  I did vary the steps in the recipe a bit.  I did everything through adding the rice exactly as written, but didn't add the protein yet.  I covered the pan tightly with foil and baked for around an hour and a half.  Before serving, I browned the sliced sausage (I used turkey kielbasa because that's what was in the freezer and I'm not sure my kids would eat andouille), sauteed the spice-dusted shrimp (used the Creole spice mix), and sauteed the chicken (leftover rotisserie chicken from the supermarket).  Added all the meat/shrimp, stirred well, and threw it back in the oven to keep warm.  It was really tasty, but not muddy-tasting, and not too spicy (I toned it down the cayenne a tiny bit for my family).  The rice cooked perfectly, and the meat didn't get overdone.  Definitely a keeper for my family!!

This was AMAZING!! Quick side note here, my husband is black and I am as white as a white girl can be lol. The only time I've had jambalaya was at a big family get together, using the "secret family recipe" and it was delicious. I'm not a great cook (nor do I have the family recipe), so I've been super intimidated to try to make jambalaya before...but this recipe is fantastic (possibly even better than the family secret, but shhh don't tell them that!). It was a tremendous hit, I made my own seasoning (thanks for including the link, it was a huge help)and couldn't be happier. Just enough spice to keep it authentic, but even my little ones, age 2 and 3, ate theirs...plus seconds! My older boys are already requesting I make it again next week. Safe to say, this ones a crowd pleaser and definitely a keeper! Thank you sooooo much :)

This was good and the whole family enjoyed it. I halved the recipe and thus cut out some steps, after initial saute, I just threw everything into my Rachael Ray ovenproof pan and let it rip. Also subbed large prawns for pre cooked shrimp, chicken tenderloins for store bought rotisserie and Evergood Pineapple sausage for andouille, which helped control the heat of the dish a bit as I have a 3 year old that doesn't yet appreciate very spicy food that the rest of the family does. I also used the recommended link for the creole spice mix and just eased up on the cayenne and white pepper. An overall winner that I will make again!

I halved the recipe and it truly turned out perfect - used long grain parboiled rice, left the juice in a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and used 3 cups chicken broth - this is totally flavourfull! Everyone loves it and now my only jambalaya recipe ever!

I cooked the rice separately which worked really well since I had leftovers, but forgot to leave out the chicken broth from the main mix so my dish was a little soupier than expected. It was still delicious, easy to make and got good reviews from my friends!

I cut the recipe in half left out the Tomato paste and used three cups of rice, two cups of broth, and only 1 TBSP of Creole seasoning. I may have been heavy on the meat portions because I love meat!  I used TC's Creole Seasoning and it appeared a bit hot for my liking so I cut that back to 1TSP.  I use cast iron cookware, so I used my 8" dutch oven from the stove top to the oven, it worked so well. I forgot to stir it during the cooking and thought at first it was a bit mushy but after I stirred it (I let it cook for 1-3/4 hrs at 350)  I left the lid off and let it set for about ten minutes and it was perfect. I mean perfect!  Very delicious. I left the tomato paste out because my wife doesn't like so much tomato. I also cut the liquid to only two cups of broth because we use Tia Jasmin rice and it must be washed so I use it wet and I find that a one to one ratio on that rice is about perfect in my rice cooker so I use that as default for that rice.

I prepared this in my slow cooker with the addition of 1 T each of oregano and parsley, 1 tsp of cayenne and 1/2 tsp of thyme. I loved the flavor added by these extra spices and, next time, I'll up my addition of cayenne from 1 tsp to 1 tablespoon.  

But, I goofed up when after I added the rice in what I'd intended as the last half-hour of cooking and then I fell asleep.  So, what I ended up with was a fantastic flavored mushy rice.  Totally my fault.  Not only did I cook the rice (and chicken, andouille and shrimp) FAR too long, but it was even worse because I used the minute rice I'd bought when  I intended to cook another recipe so there was no forgiveness in cooking time.  

Still giving this 5 stars because it would have been amazing if I hadn't made such a bad mistake.  I'll definitely make this again with the proper type of rice and cooking it for the appropriate length of time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This had a wonderful flavor, but Joel didn't care for it as much.  (Tomatoey) Bunco people loved it.  Made a LOT, and didn't bake well.  I had to put in a stock pot on the stove to finish.  Could've been the oven.

4.5 Stars: I was so concerned about the reviews saying the rice does not cook that I made it early in the day. The rice cooked perfectly, so by the time I served it that night, it was a little mushy.    We have a shellfish allergy, so I increased other meats and left out shrimp. She did not like it anyway, so I will use shrimp next time. We all agreed this had a good flavor and I thought it was pretty easy.

Didn't think of stirring this occasionally, but came out great just the same.  I forgot to add the chicken, and since I don't like shrimp, had to go by hearsay, but the kids ate several bowl fulls (teens), and the adults are still raving about it (made it 2 days ago).  The only thing I did differently, was I used 2 tbls instead of 3 for the creole spice since it appeared to be so salty.  Which seems to be a good thing with left overs, since it has gotten spicier with age, and is even better the next day.   
Just a great recipe, thank you for sharing..

Disappointed....
I will first say that it tastes delicious...but I followed the recipe EXACT...and the RICE did not cook thru. 
I waited til halfway thru..still hard...waited even longer...still hard.
I don't know what else to do to make it cook thru. I even uncovered it...seems to work a little bit that way but its still hard, sooo we will have to have Thanksgiving dinner without it, or not til way later....I am staying at the house while the family gets together (they are using their oven) b/c its not done. :( :( :( Any suggestions for next time would be helpful.

Great flavor, however I HALVED the recipe and cooked it for 2+ hours and it still wasn't done. The rice was as hard as when I first put it in the pan, and thats with increasing the temp to 375. I've never made jambalaya before, but don't think I will be anytime soon. It was such a disappointment. But this recipe does provide a great base with amazing flavor.

When I lived on the Gulf Coast I had many a jambalaya but never learned to prepare it myself. I tried this recipe for a Saints Superbowl party this year and am convinced that this dish is what sealed the victory. Okay, maybe not, but it was great. I used Tony Chachere's instead of Creole Seasoning Blend and I am sure I put in more than 3 tablespoons. I also threw in quite a bit of Louisiana Hot Sauce. And I omitted the ham. I don't feel like the ham adds anything to the dish. It was amazing!!! Everyone at the party loved it. Very authentic for an oven baked recipe, which I think is easier to prepare than the stove-top version. Thank you for this recipe!

Very versatile recipe that makes a boatload of food! Because of "chef shopping error" there were a lot of changes but it didn't hurt the recipe one bit. I would suggest being gentle with the amount of Creole seasoning and add to your preference. I cut the whole recipe in half, and used half minute brown and half regular brown rice. After pre-cooking the regular slightly it was added to the rest of the ingredients according to the recipe (except the shrimp which wasn't frozen) and cooked the whole dish on top of the stove. When it was done the pan was taken off the heat and shrimp dropped in - they cooked perfectly in the hot liquid. Wonderful mean to serve on Mardi Gras - thanks so much for posting it.

I've tested out a few Jambalaya recipes and this was the hands down winner in my house.  I used the Creole Seasoning Blend recipe with it.  The only thing I did differently was left out the shrimp and ham and doubled the chicken and sausage.  The first time I made it I scaled the recipe down to four servings and it only took 30 minutes in the oven.  The next time I made the full 16 servings and it took about an hour.  I used parboiled long grain rice and had no problems with the rice at all. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Perfect as is! The proportions are 100% accurate.  I added chopped bacon at the end.  I was worried about the cooked shrimp cooking again for so long, but it worked!! I served this to company, the presentation was beautiful and everyone went back for seconds and thirds!  Cook in a huge roasting pan (the one you use for a turkey)! Thank you for a great recipe!

Fantastic recipe!  It feeds an army so be prepared.  I made the cajun seasoning recommended and put in 1/2 the cayenne due to small children. It still had a great flavor and enough kick but not overwhelming.  I also used Aidells Cajun Sausage and it was a nice addition.  This is definitely a favorite.

Fabulous!  I did not use shrimp since I do not care for shrimp.  I did use the creole seasoning suggested in the recipe.  I did use brown rice and used only one pot for everything.  The sausage is a must.  It really added a kick to the dish.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This took a LONG time to prepare.  Lots of chopping and measuring.  But that said.... It was WONDERFUL!  I cut the recipe in half (for 8) and it was still a LOT!  Next time I will add the rice a little later or cut down on the cooking time.  Maybe add more of the creole seasoning, too! WONDERFUL!!

Five stars because the entire family thought it was great, even my teenager who generally dislikes "spicy".  Yes, I did experience the same complaints as others in that the rice was mushy in areas, mainly the bottom, but it really was delicious in spite of this.  It made for many leftovers even after cutting the recipe in half. If I could perfect this to look like the picture above, it would definitely be worth serving for company.  Made Adrienne's Cucumbers and Cheddar Biscuits as sides, both are equally delicious recipes from Allrecipes and complement the Jambalaya.

Got rave reviews on the flavor. I actually used chicken thighs on the bone that I browned in a frying pan first and it worked fine. Next time I will make my rice on the stove first though--it took three hours for it all to cook, and then I thought it was too mushy for my taste!

This is the second year that I have made the dish for the cafeteria at work. The only changes that I have made was not to cook the shrimp or chicken. After 2 hrs. in the oven, both were completely cooked. Could have used a bit more seasoning however, the milder flavor appealed to everyone. Also, when I pulled it out, it was very juicy but after an hour on the trayline, all the juice had been absorbed.

This had really good flavor but turned out really mushy.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I halved it).  Next time I think I will either make it on the stove top or make the meat and tomato mixture then add cooked rice.  My shrimp also got tough...I'll add them the last 15 minutes like suggested by another reviewer.  For those of you thinking about making this on a weeknight...It's A LOT of prep work.  It took me an hour to get the shrimp peeled, all the meats cut up and then get everything mixed together on the stove top.  I only cooked it in the oven for about an hour.

Loved it!!!

Cooked rice seperately.

Too spicy for my husband and daughter but I loved it just the way it was. My father was visiting when I made it and I thought it would be too spicy for him but he loved it. He went back for seconds.

Will cut back on the Creole seasoning next time I make it so my family can enjoy it.

I had made this once before following recipe to a T and it turned out great. Today I decided to try it again. I did a couple of changes due to availability of certain items, and a couple of tweaks of my own. I sauteed the veggies in a little bit of butter, but no way near 1/2 c., I think that is excessive. I also added a pinch of the Creole Seasoning Blend (made according to the recipe and I highly recommend you use this rather than store bought) to the sauteeing veggies and it added just the right hint of taste to them. Used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (easier than breaking up whole ones), followed the rest of the recipe. But as far as meats go, I used a rotisserie chicken bought at our grocery's deli, used fully cooked chicken sausage with garlic and herbs (can't find andouille in these parts), 3 large ham steaks, fully cooked already, just sliced them up, and kept the frozen shrimp. I put some of the recipe w/o the shrimp (son-in-law allergic) in a separate casserole dish, and the rest fit into a large roasting pan (an All Clad turkey roasting pan without the rack) However I found out while cooking the roasting pan jambalaya was no where near as hot (temp wise) as the smaller casserole I'm presuming due to the thickness of the pan. It worked better with a tin foil roaster I bought in the grocery store.
The rice cooked up beautifully, I did not have a problem with it at all. I did put the shrimp in right at the beginning as they were still partially frozen, they tasted fine, n

This was the first time I made jambalaya. It's a decent recipe and certainly a good base to start from if you want to play around with it.  I found that I had to raise the temp to 375 for about 30 minutes at the end to get the rice to cook - it really has to be boiling.  Good as it is, I think I'll try a few others.

Thank you Joslyn!!

I made this (full recipe) for a potluck this weekend, and it was a hit! I DID need to increase cooking time (total 2 hours and 15 min.)  I stirred it every 20min.  I used Uncle Ben's converted rice, and the consistency was perfect.  I DID use frozen cooked shrimp, but instead of adding them at the beginning I thawed them and put in fridge with an extra 1 t. Creole seasoning (used Emeril's "Bayou Blast"), then  added to the pot during last 15 min.  The only other change was to add more bell pepper (about 2 c.): I used 3 small peppers (red, yellow, green), and did not seem to be too much.

Rave reviews.  One guest recommended that I "try that jambalya," it was so good.  He did'nt know I cooked it!

Next time I will use low-sodium broth and low-sodium tomatoes.  I agree with some reviewers that with the ham and sausage and salty seasoning it was a tiny bit on the salty side.  I will also use spicier sausage (I used reduced-fat smoked sausage, but was a tad bland).

Definitely a keeper!

Very good flavor.  I prepared a half recipe, which was  enough for 5 adults, with a lot of leftovers.  My only problem was that I didn't care for the texture of the shrimp.  Next time, to keep it tender, I will just stir the thawed cooked shrimp in for the last few minutes to heat through.

If you like spicy, you'll love the flavor. I added hot sausage as well. Very tasty! Leave plenty of time for prep work and cooking. Rice didn't cook well, even after two hours. Next time, I will try to pre-cook rice using some of the broth from the bake and adding it to the bake in the end. Highly recommend this recipe.

I would have rated this a 5 star recipe if not for the issue with the rice being mushy on the bottom and undercooked in some parts.  I wish I read all the reviews first, but I spent almost 4 hours baby sitting this jambalaya.  I set 2 timers, one for 90 minutes which the recipe called for, and then one for 45 minutes so I could stir it halfway during the cooking time.  I did that, but after the hour and a half, a lot of the grains were still hard. I thought I did something wrong and started reading more reviews while I was still baking the jambalaya.  I kept stirring it and checking it every 10-15 minutes until most of the rice was completely done, but I have to say, it is not easy to stir such a large amount of rice.  My arm got tired, and I did use the entire 16 serving portion because it too, was for a potluck.  I was so tired when I was done, but the bad part of it is, the shrimp got so chewy, because I used cooked frozen, as the recipe called for, and the chicken was in shreds because of the long cooking time, so I threw the entire thing away except for a small bowl, for comparison. The next day, I did as many reviewers suggested, cooked it on the stove.  It worked, but this time, I halved the recipe and used raw shrimp. The reason I still gave this 4 stars was the flavor was outstanding.  It was soo good and I got rave reviews at the party.  I cooked it in an old Lodge dutch oven with the handle and just brought it to the party like that.  It looked rustic and hearty.

This was bar none the best jambalaya I have ever had. I had people finding me in the crowd to ask "the one who made the jambalaya" for the recipe. MAKE THE CREOLE seasoning that is linked you will love it for so much more than this. 
Modifications: not much - I used fresh shrimp, and layed two red snapper filets on the top while cooking. I delicately turned my rice beneath the filets and when ready to serve, stirred the filets in & they broke up through out. It was divine! I read the reviews so I new that the rice took a long time. I don't have a professional oven, just let it keep cooking, don't panic -- you will not regret making this!! OUTSTANDING ON THE YUMM-O-METER!

Used web site converter and changed servings from 16 to 8.Attempted on stove top on med heat for 25 minutes total, first 10 med(knob 5), last 15 low(knob 3). Added red bell pepper too; put cubed meat in uncooked so will have creole flavor when cooks with rice. Came out beautifully.Great recipe.Thanks!

Very nice flavor, although we like things a little spicier (not HOT, but spicy) so I'll add more next time. I even used spicy andouille sauage too.  
My main complaint is that the rice became very mushy. This was my first jamablaya attempt, so maybe it's supposed to be like that. Next time, maybe I'll cook the rice separately.  Oh- also, I put in ham, but I never actually tasted or noticed it.  The chicken & shrimp way overpower it.  My finacee said he loved the flavor, but not the texture.

This is the best jambalaya recepie I have ever found.! I like it a bit more spicy so I add hot sauce to it. Also, instead of adding frozen cooked shrimp I added raw shrimp...it cooks in the oven and takes in all the scrumptious flavours while it bakes!  Add some sharp, grated cheddar to it when you're done and it's fabulous! Yum!!!!

Another all star recipe!
I used hot portuguese sausage and sauted it first to render fat then did the veggies.  I added the chicken in raw and the shrimp raw about 20 mins before done baking. 
I made the half portion and substituted brown rice for white rice so instead of 2 cups of white rice added 1.5 cups of brown.  Baked a little longer at 1hr 45 and it was perfect.

Yummy!!  I basically halved most things in this recipe with the exception of the following:  used only 1 14oz canned of tomatoes, 2 cans chicken broth, and one 10 ounce package of vigo yellow rice.  I don't like a lot of rice, so this was perfect.  Also, I didn't have ham or shrimp, so I used 1 1/2 cups of shelled crawfish, 2 chicken breasts, and 7 or 8 links of the sausage.  I used a whole onion and whole green pepper.

This was really good. I cooked the onion and bell pepper mixture in the skillet as directed then threw everything into the crockpot except for the rice. Just before serving, I cooked the rice in chicken broth then added it to the crockpot. The only downside is that it tasted quite salty, but I think maybe that was due to the sausage,I recently moved to Canada and had to buy a different brand than what I normally use. I didn't think this was too spicy, I even threw in some red pepper flakes. I also left out the shrimp.

this came out SO GOOD.  i made a couple mods.  i didn't have cooked chicken so i used 2 breasts and 2 thighs and boiled them up in a pot with some celery, green pepper and a couple Tb of the creole seasoning.  it made nicely-flavored chicken and a great stock too.  i also used part butter and part oil to saute the veggies because it's easier to keep them from browning too much that way.  and, i sub'd brown basmati rice for the white rice.  mine cooked in the alotted time but i do have a professional oven.  even though i covered it i did have to add more stock during the last half hour.  this came out super-tasty with tons of leftovers, and the creole seasoning seems like it will be really versatile.  a note on the spiciness -- i would rank this a low to medium spicey as directed.  i added in more cayenne as i like things a bit spicier.

OOOOO EEEEE! Now this is some good eats! Reminds me of New Orleans and Mardi Gras. Very authentic and so easy to prepare. Everyone loved it, even my fussiest eaters. Seemed a bit spicy in the beginning but after it cooked it was perfect. Made a ton so I froze two containers for future meals. We are a very busy family so cooking once and getting three meals is a definite PLUS+++! Be sure to try the "Creole Seasoning Blend" too (on this site)...IT ROCKS! Thanks Joslyn... EXCELLENT!!!!!

Overall decent taste - although I agree with others in stating it was too "tomato-y"... I also had a problem with getting the rice to turn out.  The rice on the bottom was done and the rice on the top was crunchy.  Ended up adding about 2 cups of water at 90 mintues and baking for an additional 30.  If I make it again I think I'll cook the rice ahead of time and only add it at the very end.  Also, I don't thing I'll mess around with the ham and chicken... I'll probably just use 2x's the shrimp and sausage.

This is so delicious.  Very authentic.  I make 4 smaller casseroles (9"x9") and bake one that night and freeze the remaining three.  Very good meal to have on hand.

I made this jambalaya for a party and it was awesome.  Everyone raved about how tasty it was and I raved at how wasy it was to prepare.  The only thing I did differently was that I added some bay leaves to give it that extra something and it was great.  Wonderful recipe!

I love this recipe! I made it tonight, and although it was a little labor intensive, it was definitely worth it.  My boyfriend and I are both native New Orleanians, and we devoured this.  I cut the recipe by 2/3, since it's just the two of us.  We went back for seconds, and I can't remember the last time I've done that.  Congrats on a great recipe!

The rice seemed a bit mushy. I think it should call for a little less water or maybe I overcooked it. I would cook it for an hour only. Overall this was good, not great. I felt it could of use more spices. It needed more umpf!

I didn't actually did not cook it in the oven because I was afraid the rice would not be cooked. But luckily, I had a rice cooker and I added the rice afterwards. I also used a Creole Seasoning Blend that I purchased. It tasted great nonetheless.

very good jambalaya!  I never have all the meats needed and it always works no matter what I use. I've even added imitation crab instead of shrimp and it worked well.  I also cook this dish in a large skillet on the stove instead of in the oven.  Might want to give this a try if you are having problems with the rice consistency.  I also use a store-bought cajun seasoning instead of making the creole blend. Delicious!

This is definately a dish to make for a large group! Most everyone liked it! Next time I will definately follow others advice to reduce the rice by about a cup. I also tried to do what other people recommended and to check it at about an hour to make sure the rice didn't go really sticky, my mistake was that when I stirred, it as the recipe says, you need to really make sure you dig down and give it a really GOOD mix. I discovered that the rice at the bottom was very ready while the rice near the top was still crunchy. Over all this is a great recipe.

I was desparate to find a Jambalaya recipe for a catering gig that I did for a friends birthday party.  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a shot.  WOW....it was the hit of the party.  I upped the Creole Seasoning to 5 Tbsp, and was AMAZING.  Thank you, thank you, than you Joslyn for sharing such a FANTASTIC recipe.

Lots of wiggle room for substitutions and additions here for the meat of the meal (fish, shrimp, ham, sausage, etc.)  I think the seasoning mix in the recipe makes the meal.  It had a kick, but was not too spicey.  I halved the recipe, and it was a lot of food. I made it in the slow cooker, and it was still good... though I had to thicken it up with a little flour.  Thanks, Joslyn!

This was my first time making jambalaya from scratch, and it was so easy and delicious! I halved the recipe and it still fit into a 9x13 pan. I subbed diced tomatoes for whole, used Tony Chachere's spice blend for seasoning, and diced ham and turkey smoked sausage for the meats. Was ready after cooking for an hour. Everyone loved it. Thank you!

Great recipe, better than Maw Maw Boudreaux`s KC Hall secret recipe! I only made a few changes for my taste...I used nice large fresh, raw shrimp (6 cups). I threw in 1/4 cup of flour along with the tomato paste to make a thick roux, I dont know, the cajun in me said to do that...lol. I mixed in about 2 cups of the juice I had left in the bowl I had placed my peeled shrimp in with enough chicken stock to make the 7 required cups. Brought this HUGE full roasting pan to a church social and WOW...they ate almost all of it! Had enough for dinner the next day! Yum, yum  I think it will be one of those dishes I will be expected to bring to many gatherings in the future!!!

Excellent! I halved the recipe. I also used brown rice which added about 1/2 hour onto the cooking time.

I cut this recipe in half and instead of chicken substituted hot Italian sausage.  It made enough to feed 4 hungry adults who went back for seconds and thirds.  I still had enough leftover for 2 or 3 lunches.  Also, I followed the advice of another reviewer to check after 1 hour, and the rice was perfect, so I went ahead and served it at that time.  Delicious!  Serve it with garlic bread and crudite platter.  Cheesecake for dessert.

I will make again, but the rice was too mushy.  This was very good other than the rice.  I will check after 1 hour and every 10 mins. thereafter.  I cut it in two and I don't think it needs 1.5 hours when you cut it in half.  I like my rice just done - not like peas.  My husband loved it other than the mushy rice.  I also put the shrimp in right at the end so the texture would be good.

I'm giving this 3 stars, but my rating is only that high because of the amazing flavor.  Even so, that flavor is largely due to the Creole Seasoning that's linked in the footnotes.  I made exactly as indicated except I halved it, and the rice was nowhere near cooked even after 2 hours no matter how thoroughly I stirred as contributor recommended.  I should have listened to the other reviewers and made it separately, but always like to try recipes as written the first time.  Will try again, but will either make the rice separately or just throw it in a dutch oven and cook on the stove.

Excellent dish!  Love the leftovers!  Absolutely fragrant while cooking.
I diced raw chicken, used my slow cooker, set on high for 3 hours.  Added the frozen cooked shrimp in the last half hour, on low setting.  Perfect!

I made this  exactly as written EXCEPT for reducing chicken stock to 5 cups! Cooked perfectly in 90 minutes. I added fresh shrimp and crab legs during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Excellent dish. Makes enough to feed 10-15.

This makes ALOT!!! Could easily halve for an average family. Agree that it was a dance of sorts getting the rice to cook properly, but I finally did after cooking longer and checking frequently. Great flavor!

Not crazy about this.  The recipe calls for too much rice, and it bakes too long.  the net result is it's more like a paste.  The flavor is good, but the texture is not.

Well, let me tell you, cooks out there (not chefs!). I do all my prep work in advance of cooking.  No way did it take me 45 minutes.  I like the whole process, and prep took me about an hour and a half.  Enjoyable as can be, and it's baking now, but prep time for all you regular home cooks is much longer than 45 minutes!!!!!  UPDATE - IT WAS HORRIBLE AND I ENDED UP THROWING IT AWAY, AS IT WASN'T EVEN GOOD ENOUGH TO FEED THE NEEDY.  RICE STUCK TOGETHER IN BALLS AND NEGATED THE REST OF THE FLAVORS.  WILL MAKE IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY NEXT TIME.

I cut the recipe in half (two of us didn't need enough for 16!), and only went the full 90 minutes, holding the shrimp out until the last 10 minutes.  Came out great!

Have made this several times now and it has come out perfectly every time.   Everyone loves it!     I cut chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and add them in raw.   They came out nice and tender without being rubbery.   I also added  thawed cooked shrimp for the last 1/2 hour just to warm and blend flavors.   I also added extra  vegetables,  just because that is to our liking.   It was a very forgiving recipe so you can tailor it to your preferences.   We prefer kielbasa so I substituted that.    Other than that I stick to the recipe as written.   Will make it again and again,  we loved it that much.  Thank you!

Good everyone liked it. I halved the recipe, cooked a cup of basmati rice in the rice cooker separately, and had a side dish of peas and I have leftovers with four people.

After reading the reviews about the over cooked/under cooked rice, I modified the recipe.  I actually cooked it in the slow cooker for about 5 - 6 hours on high.  I omitted shrimp &a ham. (allergic to shrimp, not fond of ham) but kept and added 1 1/2C. extra of andouille sausage & chicken.  Throughout the cooking process, I added about another Tbs. of Creole seasoning and kept adding chicken stock (approximately 2 1/2 to 3 cups) along the way to make sure the rice consistency doesn't get sticky.  It turned out perfect.  This is one of the best flavored Chicken Jambalaya recipes I have ever tasted.  It was a hit with my family...

We love this recipe!  I did vary it a bit.  I was short of time, so I cooked the rice separate using some of the broth.  Also reduced amount of rice.  Then cooked the rest of the jambalaya, added the rice & put it in the oven for appox 1/2 hr.

I used chicken and rosemary sausages, as well as reduced the creole seasoning so my toddler son would enjoy it. Which he did!

This is a delicious easy meal for a large group! Great flavor!  As other reviewers said I would suggest making the rice separately.  My rice was a little mushy for my taste & I did follow the recipe. I had to add about 30 minutes because the rice was too crunchy & then by the time it was done it was a mushy but the flavor is spot on!

I made this for my Bunco Group for Mardis Gras and used the Cajun Andoullie Sausage and used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning mix. It was sooo good I had to make copies of the recipe for everyone.  I cooked all the meats together and after mixing everything together I realized I made it too early. So the rice sat in the pan (which I used a disposable roasting pan like the ones you bake a turkey in) in the refrigerator for about an hour before I baked it. The rice soaked up a lot of the juice but everything turned out great. I will definitely make this again. Sooo good.

I read 90% of the posted reviews before making this for a Girls Night dinner.  It definitely takes more time to prep than I planned for but it was worth it!  I made the rice separately so not to deal with the potential gumminess and made the creole seasoning,  as well. I used fire-roasted, diced tomatoes instead of the whole,  peeled ones suggested  and they were a nice,  flavourful addition

This is so delicious and easy. I love the fact that it has chicken and sausage and ham!! It DID take a little more than 2 hrs but she did say oven temps vary but the rice was perfect!

Was a huge hit and will make this often!

I really liked this recipe.  Halved the recipe as other reviewers indicated it made a very large amount.  I omitted the chicken and ham and added extra sausage and shrimp.  Added thawed cooked shrimp after I took it out of oven and it turned out great.  I think the shrimp would have been overcooked it they were put in prior to going in the oven.  I also used Uncle Ben's Converted Rice and it came out good, not mushy.   I will be making this again!

I used "Smokies" sausage because I could not find Andoulle. It did take longer than the recipe stated for the rice to cook. I ended up cooking it for 2 hours and then holding it warm in the oven for 1/2 hour due to guests being late. By hen it was quite thick. A little broth thins it toesired consistency.Just adjust the seasoning. I will definitely make it again. The amount it produced was huge, so I will cut he recipe in half.

This is a great recipe but so glad I read the reviews for two reasons: 1) You certainly want to half this recipe. It is still huge even halved. And, 2) make sure you have some good Creole Seasoning at the ready.

The rice didn't cook very fully, but I have had issues with pasta bakes and dishes of that nature. Taste was fantastic, so I'm sure if I could have gotten my oven to bake it correctly, it would have been a perfect dish.

Made this last night. Made a few changes. I added everything to a pot stove top and let it simmer for a little while in the chicken stock. I used jasmine rice in place of the long grain. I set my timer at 45 minutes to stir and it was done. My husband really liked it and we live in New Orleans. So it is very close to authentic.

Yum! Actually, I think the next time I make it, I'd have the rice on the side and then it can be put in the bowl to have the thickness desired.

I followed this recipes to the T and it was too watery that it diluted the flavor. I would recommend to cut back on the stock next time. Also, more Cajun seasoning to give it that kick it needs.

This was awesome!  I made some slight changes due to what I had on hand:  Only shrimp and hot Italian sausage (no chicken or ham).  I cut the recipe in half because we are only 2 people and both me and my 16 year old daughter loved it!  I wouldn't change a thing next time.  Level of spice was great, cooking time was spot on too.  We are so excited for leftovers tomorrow!

This is one of my favorite freezer meals to make.  I put 1 cup each of chicken, ham, and sausage into 4 freezer bags.  I don't use shrimp.  I then cook up the vegetables and seasoning and tomatoes and divide that up into the bags.  Freeze.   Thaw out a bag and add can of broth and a cup of rice.  Fits perfectly into my 9x9 square stone pan.  Cover with foil and bake 1.5 hours...stir half way.   Sooo good reheated as leftovers too.

I have made this recipe a dozen times.   It is the best thing to make for entertaining a crowd because it is so easy and is in the oven cooking when guests arrive.  No last minute prep required.   Once again,  it's EASY!   I add the meats FROZEN and it still comes out beautifully.  No pre-cooking required in my experience.   I prepare the base sauce, throw in frozen chicken breasts and sausage, etc.  After cooking, the meats are so tender they are easily shredded with a fork or chopped with food scissors in the pan.   I do cook the rice separately  (and adjust liquid accordingly) and add it at the end, and I do add the raw, frozen shrimp towards the very end.  I get requests for this whenever is my turn to host book club.   I love it because it's one dish.   Prepare a salad ahead and dinner is done!

The flavor of this is great!  I added a little extra of the homemade Cajun seasoning.  Otherwise I followed all instructions.    Except I forgot to cover it until the last 30 minutes, so as a result the rice did not cook properly.  The bottom was slightly overcooked, and the top was undercooked, despite stirring it.   I think next time I need to cover it the whole time, and also stir it a second time to avoid the uneven cooking.  The time given seemed about right, if not ten minutes too long.  (I can't imagine it taking longer, unless your oven temp tends low.)  The batch is huge, so be ready to feed a crowd!  Don't forget to make the Quaker cornbread recipe with honey to go with it!

This is a very good recipe. I cooked my rice in my rice cooker, and served it on the side. I then cooked everything else in a large skillet on the stove top instead of baking. I used pre-cooked shrimp to save time and omitted the tomato paste (because I didn't have any). Came out perfect!

Recipe was very tasty though too spicy. I changed the serving to 4 so maybe there was an issue in the conversion. Or perhaps it was the Creole seasoning mix I was using. Anyway I would make this recipe again though with half the seasoning. My husband enjoyed the dish and he normally doesn't like rice based dishes. I cooked it on the stove instead of in the oven so I could have more control over the doneness of the rice.

I have been making this recipe for a few seasons now. We love this recipe and it freezes well. This is a great fall winter dish! I just made this over the last weekend while camping. 

The only modifications we have done is to use an electric roaster, add MORE broth while cooking (omitting the rice)and then when we are about 30 mins out of serving we cook the rice in some of the broth we have scooped from the dish. We keep the rice separate until we're ready to freeze what we don't eat in 2-3 days, then all of it is combined and frozen.  Great stuff!

Excellent!!! Love the Creole seasoning. I made a big batch and use this seasoning in many other ways. Add white and brown sugar and dried mustard to some of it and rub it on ribs. I used the Baked BBQ Baby Back recipe on All Recipes.  They were great.

This recipe was fabtabulous! I made a few adjustments to the Creole Seasoning Blend and the Jambalaya to suit our tastes and oven :)  

*I added 2-3 tbsp (I think) of Cajun seasoning to increase the kick of the Creole Seasoning Blend and extra cayenne pepper (possibly another tbsp or 2).  
*I increased the garlic to 8 cloves. 
*Instead of using 2-28oz cans of whole peeled tomatoes, I substituted 4-14oz cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic.  
*I lowered the chicken stock to 6 cups *I used parboiled rice instead of long grain. 

Cooking time for me was two hours and I stirred it once at the halfway point.

this was a fantastic recipe and a big hit with the "eaters". I suggest fork-pullling the chicken instead of cubing for a more authentic look and feel.  I also cooked with a bit of Tabasco for some added heat and smokiness.  I omitted pork products and used chicken andouille and increased other proteins to make up for no ham...wanted to keep the ratios right.  So good!  I will be making this the next time I need to bring a dish to a party or tailgate.  Thank you for sharing it!

I have made this recipe twice now and it has turned out great both times.  I have yet to make it in the oven.  The first time my 13 year old son made it in the crockpot, just dumped everything in and let it cook, (it is just that easy!) Last night I made it on the stove top in a dutch oven.  I also didn't follow the measurements exactly - each time I had a chicken breast, 2 sausage links, etc. leftover from cooking other meals and I had stuck all that in the freezer. I just pulled them out, adjusted the amounts and make a smaller batch for just the 3 of us.  I also used brown rice instead of white.  Good flavor and I really like being able to adjust the intensity of the cajun seasoning. This is a good recipe and I will certainly be making it again.

I recently made this for my (sometimes picky) family of 6 and my father-in-law.  I started on the stove top, but then transferred everything to the crock pot (thawed shrimp went in during last 10-minutes or so).  I made the rice separately.  It was put on the table and boy did they eat!  There was just enough left to send some home with Dad and still have about 3-4 bowls left for next day's lunch.  It's been about 3 weeks since I made it and I'm still getting raves and requests for more!  Can't wait to bring it to a holiday pot-luck!  Thanks for a great recipe Joslyn.

From Louisiana and have had trouble in the past with rice cooking in huge stockpot.  Other than substituing out the andouille (since I can't get it in DC), I followed this recipe, cooking in Calphalon turkey roaster.  Did prepwork in roaster across two burners on stove, covered it and shoved it in the oven.  Set my timer and started drinking...didn't touch it for 90 mins.  It was PERFECT.

I have been dying to make this, but I wanted to wait for my cousin (who lived in New Orleans) to come over.  Tonight was the night, and it was a HUGE hit.  I did make a few changes.  First I only used 1.5 cans of tomatoes since others were saying it was too "tomato-y".  Next I used 6 cups of rice ( I knew everyone in my family loved rice, and this worked out perfect for us) Since I didn’t use all the tomato juice I added 2 more cups of stock.  I also added the shrimp (raw) 12 min before it was finished.  It came out AMAZING even my cousin loved it.   I had A LOT left over, I fed 7 at dinner, and had more than enough to feed 10 at work.  I will be making this often.   Thanks a bunch!

Excellent Dish!  I love the ease of one dish meals.  I halved the recipe, as I was cooking for a small number of people.  The changes I made was to use regular smoked sausage (andouille was not available) and I added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup (undiluted).  I think the tomato paste and one can of the tomatoes need to be eliminated.  I will do this the next time I make this recipe - (too much acid for us from the the amount of tomatoes). All in all, a great recipe!  Will definately make again.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight.  The flavor was excellent.  After reading some reviews, I decided to change the way I cook rice.  First, I soaked my rice in chicken broth for several hours.  My Japanese mom always soaks rice in water before cooking so the rice comes out more tender.  It turned out to be a smart choice.  Next, being a lazy person that I am, I decided to cook everything in my Le Creuset French oven (one big pot to wash vs. a pot and a casserole dish :o) )  Lastly, I didn't care for the shrimp being rubbery from being overcooked so next time, I will add it towards the end of the cooking (maybe cook it for only 10 minutes to heat) just to heat through (since it's already cooked, it doesn't need to be cooked for a long time and when shrimp gets cooked too long, it doesn't taste as good as when it's cooked just long enough.)  With those adjustments, I think the dish will be a five star dish!  Thanks JOSLYN.

Takes awhile to make, and awhile to cook, but it tastes great and even our two toddlers loved it!  Unless you have a family of 12 you may want to make this for company, half the recipe for a regular night, or freeze half after making.  We froze half and it tasted great when we took it back out and reheated it!

This is wonderful.  Just cook the rice separately...no need to panic.  I add fresh shrimp and diced, fresh fish about 20 minutes before it's done.  Ham is good too...I just like the fresh fish option better.  I put the diced chicken in raw at the beginning, and it comes out perfectly.  I also use kielbasa sausage (no andouille at the local Wal-Mart) and it's fabulous.  Man, this is awesome stuff, and easy to make, even for a regular dude like me.  I made it for a dozen family members and there wasn't much left.

This was very tasty but be warned that this makes A LOT!  I didn't have ham and eliminated the broth since I was cooking the rice separately.  There was plenty of juice from the veggies to make this like a very thick stew.  Also, I cooked everything in my cast iron dutch oven then took it straight to the oven for baking (reduces cleanup).

This was good.  I actually doubled the recipe for a party, and cooked it in my old faithful turkey roaster.  Took about 3 hours for the rice to get tender, stirring it about every hour.  However, that was a little too early for my party, so turned down as low as it could go for 2 more hours.  That probably wasn't a good idea ... it kept sucking up the broth, and I ended up adding an awful lot of additional broth.  I thought the rice was a little mushy, but the flavor of the whole thing was good, and my guest enjoyed it ... and loved having leftovers to take home.

The flavors were rich, but lacked substance. I followed the original recipe, with no changes, except putting the shrimp in the last 15 minutes of cooking. It yielded a lot for leftovers. The rice did turn a little mushy as other reviewers had stated.

I gave this only 3 stars because the rice did not cook evenly. The rice turned to paste, maybe it was because I doubled the recipe, but I'll stick with making it on the stove.

AMAZING!! I used Market Day tail off shrimp with garlic and herbs instead of butter and garlic. I cooked them first but kept the juices/seasonings and then cooked the celery in the juices. I also added a bag of frozen corn. No onion.  andouille sausage in the juices and then cooked chicken in the combination of the garlic shrimp/sausage pan drippings. While I was preparing the rest of the meal, I put the cooked shrimp in the freezer since it calls for cooked frozen shrimp.  I went a little lighter on the rice and used whole grain brown rice.  Perfect.  I added 1 lg. can of SW vegetable soup and cut back on 2 cups of chicken broth. Spices:  Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning Original Shaker, Chipotle chili powder and pepper.

I've made this recipe several times and each time it comes out better.  I adjust the ingredients depending on my guests (some don't like spicy, so I tone it down).  I also add kiebalsa sausage, shrimp and chicken.  It is very good for parties.

If you follow this recipe as written, you will end up with hard rice.  But if you increase the temperature at the end of the 1 1/2 hours by about 25 degrees and give it another twenty minutes or so (I didn't keep close track of the time...), the problem is fixed.  Perhaps you could just bake it at 375 the whole time to eliminate the problem.  I'll try that next time. I think the problem is that the rice has to be boiled at some point.  The increase in temperature does that.

After an hour and a half of baking, my rice was still crunchy, so I baked it an additional 30 minutes and that made it mushy. I think next time I will use wild rice because it has a better texture.

This was very impressive.  It was a little too spicy for the kids, but will definetly make this again.  I'm not even sure I would reduce the amount of creole seasonings, because my husband and I loved it as is.  This make a lot of food.  We froze half the recipe for later, (Hopefully it will freeze well)  and we ate several meals all week from the other half.

Yum!  I found this needed a bit more liquid - so I scaled the recipe to 1/2 and added 6 cups of chicken broth.  I also found that it needed a substantially longer time to cook as the rice wasn't done in 1 1/2 hours.  I may try it next time in the crockpot - but really good flavor, but needs some adjustment.

I didn't add sausage, ham, or shrimp (hubby doesn't do shrimp) but the flavor with the chicken was excellent!  My husband says it could use a bit more spice, such as cayenne.  But I loved it and will definitely be making again... hopefully with shrimp one day!

I made this on the stove top instead of in the oven, cooked my rice separately, and left out the shrimp, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  It wasn't *quite* what I expected - I don't know what that was though!  LOL  I thought the sauce kinda tasted like marinara sauce.  I don't like marinara sauce much, so I thought it was just ok, but my hubby gobbled up two bowls and even offered to eat the left overs - he has never, EVER eaten left overs before!  I have to give it 4 stars for that, no matter what I thought!  I will make this again, I just might have to change the seasonings a bit to suit my tastes.

This could have been a 5star recipe for taste, however this was such a DISASTER to make. Like the reviewer below me, i ended up dumping the entire dish. I scaled it down to 8 and followed the recipe to a T. Even after 1 hour, my rice was still crunchy. (mind you i scaled this down by 1/2!) To make a long story short,the texture was a mess!! And NO its not my stove. I NEVER have issues with baking time, EVER. I was so disappointed. I took one bite and tossed the rest in the garbage. Total waste of ingredients.BUT on a positive note.. i really liked the ingredients the recipe calls for and i thought the taste was really good. I am going to attempt this again tomorrow because i think this can be great. Next time, i will scale it down to 4 and cook it on the stove top.

This is a very good recipe. First time around the only rice I had on hand was Jasmine. A little too sticky. Next time I used organic brown rice and it was wonderful. This recipe takes longer to prepare than I had hoped, but the time was worth it!

Great base recipe... Proportions on the seasonings/flavorings are perfect for me, but the rest of the recipe definitely needs tweaking.  I used skinless chicken thighs and seared them off first for more flavor.  I also rendered the fat out of the Andouille sausage.  Halfway through the cooktime, I removed the chicken thighs and took the meat off the bones.  Like other reviewers, I added the shrimp at the end to prevent overcooking it.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious!  I'm deducting a star because I didn't like the wet, mushy texture of the rice.  Normally long grain white rice takes ~30 min to cook, so 1.5 hours does seem overkill in hindsight.  Next time I'll reduce the stock by 1 cup (or omit the juices from the tomatoes) and cut the cooktime down to an hour, or until the rice is just al dente.  Will definitely make again!  UPDATE:  The second time was a big improvement with the add'l changes... However, for some reason the rice cooked unevenly in the oven and some spots were mushy while in other spots it was still raw (I guess you have to make sure everything is nice and flat after stirring it up).  I made it a third time and just did everything on the stovetop.  That cut the cook time in half and made it so much easier to control (I cut the recipe in half so it would fit in the pan).  The results were just perfect... Will not make in the oven again, unless to feed the masses!

I grew up in Louisiana and this was my first attempt at Jambalaya.  The recipe was easy to follow.  I also made a couple of changes.  I added 1 pound of fresh crawfish tails and substituted 1 pound of peeled fresh shrimp. I added a little more than three tablespoons of Tony Chachere's seasoning in place of the Creole seasoning blend.  Everyone raved and my husband has had it three times so far for left overs (one time three bowls!)  I put the rest in the freezer.  He can't wait for me to thaw that out!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was just perfect!  We didn't have any ham to put in it but I'd almost be afraid it would've made it too salty with the spice mix having salt in it already.  We put it in a huge cast iron Dutch oven on a cookie sheet (because of the feet).  Absolutely scrumptious, wouldn't change a thing!  Thank you for sharing.

Soooo delicious! This is really easy to make, and easy to adjust if you don't have all the different meats on hand. Just make up the difference with a meat that you do have.

I used one of those large All-Clad roasting pans and the cooking time required was over 2 hours!  I followed the recipe perfectly, but everytime I checked the rice, it was still hard.  Good idea for having it oven baked, but I had a hard time getting the rice to cook in a decent amount of time.

I was really pleased with both how relatively easy this was to make and how well it turned out. 

I used shrimp, clams (shucked), chicken and kielbasa. Didn't omit any of the veggies, and used long grain brown rice instead of the white rice, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. 

I felt like it was a little on the soupy side, so just cooked it longer than called for. I also wish it was a bit spicier which I'll just adjust next time by adding in some more spices or I'll use spicy sausage. 

Definitely worth making again though

Good recipe, but rather time intensive for a weekday meal.  I'll save it for company next time.  I scaled down the recipe to 8 servings and still had lots of leftovers from serving our family of 5.

I used four cans of chicken broth for this recipe, and it turned out perfect.  I think next time I might cut the rice down to 3 cups, so the texture will be a bit more soupy. Instead of andouille sausage, I used someleftover grilled brats that I had stored in the freezer.  What a wonderful taste! The seasonings were perfect.  I will be making this for an upcoming dinner party that I will be hosting.

We used instant rice. I think that was no-no because it cam out kinda mushy. Plus this recipe will feed a virtual army. We had to use 3 different pans. Next time I will be sure to cut the recipe in 3rds and use long grain rice. Very good though!

This is wonderful recipe. Not too spicy.  I made it exactly as stated except I used 2 cups of rice instead of 4.  I also put my jambalaya into 2 crock pots instead of in the oven.  This recipe makes a huge batch.

I work in the foodservice industry and wanted to make a jambalaya for Fat Tuesday.  Traditional recipes wouldn't work because I couldn't cook the volume of it I needed on the stovetop.  When I found this baked version I was thrilled.  I wasn't able to use the ham or the shrimp, so I doubled up on the chicken and the andouille.  It was great!  Because I was making it in big hotel pans, I ended up cooking it an extra 45 minutes, but that wasn't a big deal.  Thanks for your help!

I made this last night for a mardi gras party. It was wonderful. Not too spicy, but with a nice kick. Great for a group with varying spice tolerance. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using raw shrimp. A keeper!

Oh my goodness. I am not sure if I did something wrong as I followed the recipe exactly but this was absolutely horrible. The one thing I did appreciate about the recipe is that for the Creole Seasoning they gave you another recipe on how to make it. I will definitely keep the Seasoning recipe but that is it.

I would concur with the 5 star rating this recipe has received. I made this last night for dinner in my new Le Creuset dutch oven and it worked perfectly. I had to cook an additional 30 minutes to let the rice finish cooking. I would recommend that you fully stir the jambalaya at the halfway point. The rice on the bottom was much softer than the top so I think if I had stirred it more effectively it would have cooked more evenly. 

Everyone loved it and I made it almost exactly as directed. The only change I made was adding raw shrimp (shelled and deveined) not cooked like the recipe suggested. I find that pre-cooked shellfish doesn't allow it to flavor the dish near as much.

Great recipe and I will make this again. If you follow Weight Watchers this would be 8 pts per serving. Thanks for submitting this dish!

Not bad for my first try at Jambalya! However, I couldn't follow the recipe exactly because I was not able to find andouille so I substituted smoked beef sausage. I also did not have ham around when I prepared this dish. I did make the creole seasoning using the recipe for the seasoning. The chicken stock from cooking the chicken pieces did not produce 7 cups for me... only about 3 cups so I had to add 2 cans of chicken broth to make up the extra 4 cups. I think the recipe was good but not great! It seemed to have lacked that special punch in taste. Kind of mild as another reviewer noted. It was still a nice meal but just not exciting. I think a little tweaking in the seasonings may help.

Also preparation time is pretty lengthy but it does produce a lot. Definitely a meal for a large family or crowd. One pan will probably not hold all of it unless your pan is super large.

Yum-O. I halved the recipe, turned out great! I made/used the Creole seasonings, but omitted the salt, which was smart, because with the ham and sausage-woo!  I have Hypo tastebuds (high tolerance) and it would have been VERY salty. Without added salt=perfect. it will be even better tomorrow.

Excellent recipe.  I had trouble with the rice cooking properly so I precooked the rice in the chicken stock with an extra tablespoon of the seasoning.  I also used a chicken breast and 4 thighs, and 2 lbs of shrimp for 1/2 recipe.  I cut the cooking time to 1 hour 20 minutes and added the shrimp in the last 30 minutes.  Took it to a party and got rave reviews.  Thank you Jocelyn!

This is fabulous.  I used the creole seasoning recipe from this site and the dish was perfectly spiced.  I didn't have an issue with the rice turning out too crunchy or soggy.  We have also substituted barley for the rice and it turns out perfectly.

I have to say I think I really screwed this one up.  Major disappointment after the cost of all the meat.  It was very tomato-ey (and I love tomatoes) and the rice didn't cook properly.  There was way too much food to fit in a baking dish so I tried to do it on the stove...maybe that's where I went wrong.  I could tell it had good flavor, but I couldn't eat it  and threw it out.  I might try again, but  I'm not sure how to get around the quantity of food to make it sizeable for the oven.

This recipe is wonderful!I Made it for about 15 people and it was very popular. I chose this one as it sounded far easier to make than some of the other Jambalaya recipes. I changed it a bit though  I coated raw chicken breasts in the Creole seasoning and cooked them in a pan. Thank you! Joslyn

Just tried this recipe.  It tastes wonderful and I was very pleased with the consistency of the rice. It did take longer to cook than the 1 &1/2 hour suggested, but that may just be my oven.  Made the seasoning blend suggested, and it was wonderful.

I know most of you great cooks know this already, but DON't use Minute rice.  It was all I had so I used it, it turned into mush!!  The flavor was great, but next time I will use regular rice and it will be awesome!!

This was an easy and excellent recipe!  My son thought it was too spicy but he says that about everything.  My husband and I loved it but I can see people that don't like spicy food not enjoying this.  But then again they probably shouldn't be eating Jambalaya then in the first place. I ended up cutting the dish in half though and we still had tons of leftovers.  Next time I will probably cut it down still.

Wow.  As an amataeur cook, I found this recipe easy and wonderful.  My husband absolutely loved it!  I scaled the recipe way back but otherwise followed the recipe, sort of guessing on cooking time.  Rice cooked nicely in the dish.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is great! I wanted to add a little extra spice and flavor so I used chorizo...it turned out really good but the chorizo made it a little greasy.

This was delicious.  I omitted the shrimp because my husband doesn't care for it.  My son and daughter-in=law stopped by and they were nibbling at the leftovers,  My daughter-in-law took the recipe home with her.  I scaled this back to four servings and it was enough for me to freese for another meal.  Very easy to make.

The only problem I had with this recipe is that I ran out of white rice and had to mix in brown rice.  It didn't seem fully cooked after the 1 1/2 hours, so I added a bit of water over the top, recovered, and cooked another 10 minutes.  It came out just fine.  Other changes I made (based on what I had or didn't have on hand):  I only used one can of tomatoes, no celery, used all sausage instead of adding chicken and shrimp, and had to mix my own Cajun spice.  Next time I will be sure to have all the ingredients ahead of time, although everyone enjoyed this meal as I made it.  The basic taste of it was delicious!

Yummy, a lot of work, but good!!  It needed a little more heat for our taste, so I served it with Tobasco sauce.  I bought a shrimp cocktail ring on sale at Vons and added the thawed shrimp in the last minutes of cooking as suggested by others.  Thank you for the delicious recipe!!

This was extremely good! I halved the recipe and it was enough for four large portions with no side dishes. I followed the recipe exactly except i didnt have any ham and I added some okra. The spice was just right for us and we added a little Louisiana hot sauce on top. Cooking time was perfect and it was very easy and fast to make. This is my new jambalaya recipe!

The taste was wonderful, but I found that the rice was too mushy by the time the Jambalaya was done. Next time I make this, I will cook the rice separately and stir in at the end.

Not impressed with this jambalaya at all. Rice was not tender after 1.5 hours; and, too long to cook "frozen cooked shrimp"- it was chewey. (I'd use fresh and add toward the end). Oven baking was convenient, but overall flavor was not worth the wait!

This recipe is the best!  It cooks up just as promised and leaves room for experimentation.  I used red and green pepper and extra celery (to up the veggie content).  I have made it with both cooked and raw shrimp and it turned out equally well.  Instead of andouille sausage (difficult to find in these parts), I used hot italian sausage.  All in all a great recipe - not too spicy, but still with a bit of kick!

I also had trouble getting the rice to cook in the time listed on the recipe but we really like!  I substitue Spam (light) for the ham, use pre-cooked chicken strips (near the packaged lunchmeat), and I like to double the spices but it's a crowd pleaser.  Not cheap though.

Don't ever try to make this in a dutch oven, there is far to much. Ended up having to split it towards the end between the crockpot and the dutch oven. You should make this recipe in one of those huge food service size buffet/roasting pans. Other than that it's a tasty recipe.

Like the others, the rice was mushy...perhaps I should have lessen the amount of liquid.  It tasted and smelled really great though!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have never eaten, much less made jambalaya before but was so excited when I read all of the 5* reviews for this recipe. I made this w/o making any changes and found that altho the flavor is heavenly (I used Emeril's seasoning), in order for the rice to be thorougly cooked, the dish ended up being a little on the mushy/pasty side, I'm assuming because the rice absorbed much of the liquid. Short of cooking the rice separately and adding it at the end, does anyone have any ideas...maybe adding a little more stock? This is a wonderful dish and I will definately make it again. My fiance and son raved about the flavour. Thanks for a great recipe Joslyn.

This recipe makes enough for a crowd, so I split it into two pans, cooked one for the family, the other went into the freezer for a future meal.  I plan on making this for our block party this June.  Great flavor, made little changes to suit our tastes..Thanks

Very, very good Joslyn! We like things a bit spicey, so I added cayenne pepper. I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole and after boiling my shrimp (which I didn't add to the dish until after it was out of the oven) I used the shrimp broth instead of the chicken broth. Thanks for a great crowd pleaser!

I loved this recipe. I had always wanted to make jamabalya and this was 5 stars for sure!I cut in in half and I couldn't believe how much it made!  2 9x13 pans.  I gave some to my mom and her friend. I loved the little bit of bite and all the good stuff. I used chicken andouille sausage because that is all I could find.  I have everyone at work hooked!! great recipe!

I made this last night following the recipe, and it turned out good.  The recipe is written well for taking this to a party, to accommodate all tastes.  We prefer things a little spicier, so after tasting the final product, I added 3 more tablespoons of the Creole seasoning.  Also, it was just a little dry for our tastes, we would prefer it a little soupier.  Next time I will reduce the amount of rice by at least 1 cup.

Delicious! This is a great crowd pleaser. I used chicken chipotle sausage,uncooked chicken thighs(which I browned first)and chopped ham. At the end I added uncooked shrimp and baked 10 more minutes. I can't imagine using cooked shrimp, seems like they would taste like rubber after 1 1/2 hrs. I halved the recipe and cooked mine in a cast iron dutch oven. I can't wait to bring this to another potluck!!!

I made this for a party and scaled the recipe for 64. There were lots of leftovers, but everyone loved it. I added more sausage than the recipe called for and was able to make it early in the day and cook it just before the party.

I recently made this dish for a Mardi Gras party I was hosting for my dinner club.  The recipe was both fool-proof and delicious.  Even my friend who had lived in New Orleans thought it was fantastic.  I made the Creole spice mix that was included in the recipe but you could also use a store-bought Creole/Cajun mix to save time.

excellent recipe. I used a shrimp ring and stirred in the shrimp right before serving so they wouldn't be rubbery.  This makes tons! It couldn't be easier to put together. Thanks for a great meal!

Made this last night, awesome. Cooked bite sized raw chicken coated with suggested Creole seasoning (which is the only one to use) in butter until browned.  Omitted fish & ham used Swanson chicken broth & water (didn't have any fresh chicken stock left), cooked in cast iron pot.  Cut recipe to 8 servings that was still too much for two people, but will try adding more stock tonight for leftovers.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe that I have been searching for.

Supercalifragilistic.....Made this for dinner last night.....LoVeD It!!  I cut the recipe in half for my family, but if I was to bring to a "Pot Luck" Supper or such I would make the whole recipe.....It was just the right amount of spice, but you could add a bit more if you like a bit more bite......

I LOVED this!!! My hubby and kids weren't too mad about it, as I had made it a bit too dry (half way through, I thought there was too much liquid, so added MORE rice!) and the kids weren't mad about the shrimps - so next time, and there will be a next time, I will leave the shrimps out, but DEFINITELY a recipe I will use again, particularly if we have a lot of company round.

I made this recipe for a large gathering and everyone enjoyed it! Easy to prepare and transport in a large disposable roaster pan. For the creole seasoning, I used Paul Prudhomme's Magic seasoning blend. I omitted the ham and used jumbo shrimp.
