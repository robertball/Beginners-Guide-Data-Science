Everything was good EXCEPT the kikkoman sauce. Ew!! I love samosas with a passion. This is not an indian style sauce. I followed the recipe as instructed, using frozen peas and carrots instead of canned, and I didn't have the Kikkoman sauce so I used a generous amount of curry powder and a little coriander, seasoned to taste. It tasted just like an authentic samosa and was very simple to make but dry without the sauce...so I went and bought the sauce. I mixed a tsp in with the filling just to test it and I hate it. I bought tamarind pulp and made my own tamarind sauce and that helped a lot. I am going to try adding some vegetable broth to moisten the mixture as well. I will make this recipe again but definitely not with the kikkoman sauce.

Delicious!  I made a large batch and froze the leftovers on a cookie sheet then transfered to a ziploc bag.  The frozen samosas cooked just as well as the fresh!

We ended up using what was left of the curry sauce for dipping, and it was delicious.

Very good & tasty recipe.  I made some changes by using equal portions of white & sweet potatoes, then mashing them so they fill better in the wonton wrapper.  Couldn't find kikkoman brand sauce, so used Heinz brand's sweet chili sauce instead. Tasted very good.

I substituted baked potatoes for red potatoes. Personal preference, really. Pay attention to the 1/2in cube instructions. I quartered the potatoes, which caused the initial cooking time to increase substantially. Because you're cooking everything in a pan it may take longer than the recipe specifies to cook down. I couldnâ€™t find red curry sauce at the store so I substituted a red curry paste and put about 3T in instead of 1c. In the spice department it needed a substantial amount of Indian spices. Garam Masala and curry powders were added to taste.

This recipe was great!! But, I did find out that you should only use 3 potatoes. When I had my first samosa all I could taste was the potatoes. And you should add Tony Chachere's.

Good but not great. For the effort I still prefer the samosa recipe by Kimber found on this site that asks for lamb, I just substitute ground chicken and use wonton  wrappers. I added some cardamom, cumin and garam masala to the sauce. I couldn't find the Kikkoman version so I bought the Canadian Superstore's 'PC's Red Curry Cooking Sauce'.
