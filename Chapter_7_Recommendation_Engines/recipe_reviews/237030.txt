Tasty snack! I wish I wasn't so busy while making these b/c I would've cooked them a touch less, as I felt they were a bit too overdone, but maybe that's just my oven. Also, if I didn't have the dry beans on hand (which I happened to this time), I would just use canned. That way I don't have to 'plan' on making them, lol. All in all, a nice treat that I can feel good about! Thanks for sharing. :)

I tried this recipe this very afternoon and followed it almost exactly except I added a little ground cumin and Garam Marsala spice!  AWFUL!  I wound up with a cookie sheet of totally uneatable pebbles.  Actually, I lost a filling attempting to eat one of these Roasted Chickpeas.  I was really looking forward to this but can not believe the outcome ! ! !

This was really good! Only thing I realized was that it is a "today" snack- they don't hold over to the next day very well- get soggy and lose crispness quickly. I'll just make only what I think we'll eat next time.

I used canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed, and then I let them dry out on paper towels for an hour or two. They only needed 30 minutes in the oven.

I wonâ€™t make this again, although I liked the idea.  Mine turned out very hard and I was afraid I would break a tooth, so I tossed them out.

good recipe, hard to find ones for real chickpeas and not bland canned ones. Way healthier and tastier most importantly. Good jumping off recipe!
