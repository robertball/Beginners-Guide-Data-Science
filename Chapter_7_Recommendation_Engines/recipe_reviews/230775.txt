So easy to make, a great last minute appetizer. It looked like we may be short of food for an office luncheon, so I, a bachelor of 36 years, now married 150, made this myself in just a few minutes.  It was great, everyone loved it.  I added  a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic (from the jar, of course) and used half regular and half portobello mushrooms. They went very quickly!

If you love mushrooms as much as I do, try this recipe. I added more ranch and some garlic salt

Everyone LOVED these! The only change I made was to 1/2 the recipe. I used sliced baby bella mushrooms. These are too simple, yet very delicious~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is actually the third time I've made this - the first batch was a try-out batch, which turned out great - the next batch was quadrupled for the holiday - and it came out a little too salty. This year I made a point of using unsalted butter for my bigger batch - and it was perfect! Can't say enough for the simplicity of this recipe, especially during the holidays!

I love to sauté mushrooms, sliced medium, in butter and thyme.  For incredible richness mix with cream, sour cream or Mascarpone.   I exchange Mascarpone for cream cheese a lot.

Perfect office potluck because it's easy to transport and keep warm. I like Italian Seasoning packets as a sort of all-purpose go-to for meats, seafood, and veggies... without cream or buttermilk you don't get that readily identifiable "salad dressing" aspect. With this Mushroom recipe, I started with 2 pounds for my group because I figured -- rightly so -- this was the dish where everyone would linger. It was gone first.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe at all, I did melt the butter first and then mix the dressing in with the butter and poured it over the top of the  mushrooms. I used 14 pretty good size mushrooms and cook them in the crock pot for about 3 1/2 hours on low.  Awesome recipe

I was afraid the mushrooms would taste like ranch dressing and couldn't imagine that being a good thing.  I'm glad I tried these anyway.  No worrying about a crowded skillet or frequent stirring.  These cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful.  I would reduce the butter a bit next time, but we will make this recipe again.  Thank you!

These were really good. I have made them for parties and for a side dish at dinner. Try using different varieties of mushrooms for different flavors!

I didn't care for the zestfulness that these mushrooms developed from the ranch seasoning.

I made this as a last minute side dish for a potluck at my house because we needed more veggies.  People asked for the recipe and asked to take home leftovers.

Really easy to make, I might try quartering or halving the mushrooms next time to get a softer texture. It's still fine with half the butter.

These were very good and easy mushrooms.  I only used about half of the ranch packet to avoid excess salt and it worked very well. I will definitely make again.

I buy my produce at a well know warehouse store & usually wind up not using them all. Now I will make them this way and not waste any!!!  So easy, so tasty and soooo delicious....  I did add about a tablespoon of minced garlic as another reviewer did. May try adding onions to change it up next time - yet it is great just the way it is. I used whole mushrooms and quartered them before cooking for ease of eating. Enjoy this tasty side dish. It's awesome.

I have just made this with homemade ranch dressing mix (also on this site) and it is wonderful. So simple, yet tastes exotic and complex. I'll definitely be making this recipe again. Thank you.

Delicious & so simple! Coworkers, friends, & relatives asked for the recipe. I did use 1 packet if ranch mix for 2 lbs of mushrooms & added a little ranch dressing & 1 whole onion. Mushrooms shrink by 50% when cooked, so keep that in mind when cooking for a crowd. 2 lbs didn’t look much when cooked.

Pretty good but they cook down a ton so my contribution to a potluck looked really piddly. Had a smaller crockpot filled near the top with mushrooms and it cooked down to being only about 1/3rd of the way full. I made 1 & 1/2 pounds of mushrooms, just used 1 packet of ranch but also added some parmesan cheese and bacon. Didn't taste like ranch, just had a little zest.

These were quite good and I was very surprised!  I used half the butter and mix for one pound of baby portabellas. If you are making food for a crowd this is a no brainer dish...I’d quadruple The recipe and  make a HUGE pot full!!!

Couldn't be easier. Great mushroom taste. Only problem is the commercial Ranch dressing dry mix makes the finished dish WAY too salty...I'll have to find a good home made dry ranch mix recipe & just leave out a bunch of salt!

These are fantastic!  An low-effort dish to add to the holiday menu.  I served them with prime rib, they were a hit!  Although they are so simple, they would be an easy side dish for a weeknight meal too!

I had only half as much mushrooms so I halved everything else and made it on the stovetop instead to cut down the time. Hubby said to make it again!

Made exactly as the recipe states as everyone that rates recipes should. 

These were good but a bit salty for my tastes. The rest of the family likes them so we'll make them again I'm sure.

Absolutely delicious!  My mom has made these for several holidays, and I tripled the recipe and took them to a club event.  They were DEVOURED.  Couldn't be simpler.  Clean the mushrooms, melt the butter and mix in ranch mix.  Pour over mushrooms in crock pot and voila!  The mushrooms will shrink during cooking.
