This was an excellent recipe.  This a nice refressing cange from those "sugary" punches.  I have got my boyfreind to drink and he doesn't like anything grapefruit.

This punch was great and it was gone by the time the party was over. The only thing that 'scares' me is the amount of artificial sweeteners, I'm going to try it again with regular jello and gingerale.
