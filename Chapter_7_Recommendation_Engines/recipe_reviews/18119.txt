This cake is absolutely delicious. I had lost a recipe for a similar cake I used to make, so I was very happy to run onto this recipe. I cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and it is perfect. I make a cream cheese frosting, add 1 cup each of pecans and coconut to it and frost the cake. It is always a huge hit and I always have to give out the recipe.

This is one of the best cakes that I have ever had.  It is a very heavy cake, but very moist.  A real hit.

I had never heard of a Vanilla Wafer Cake before but after a little research I learned this is a classic, “retro” cake, the recipe for which is all over the internet, be it in blogs, web sites or even on quaint, hand-written recipe cards.  I was pumped to try this!  I figured a recipe this well-recognized and that has stood the test of time has got to be good.  But it wasn’t for me.  While the flavor really was quite good, I found this heavy as a brick, overly sweet, and soaked with butter.  I had plans for a nice finish on this cake but it didn’t happen as I ended up tossing it. For those who still would like to try it, keep in mind that certain brands have sneakily reduced the volume in the box of a vanilla wafers from 12 ounces to 11 ounces.  To make up the difference, you may want to do as I did and add 2 T. of flour. (I noticed that Vanilla Wafer Cake IV, also from this site, is essentially the same recipe but calls for 1/2 cup less of both sugar and butter and just might be a better bet)

This was the first time I followed this particular recipe for a Vanilla Wafer Cake. The cake is way too heavy and may need less butter and sugar. I have made Vanilla Wafer Cake IV before with no problem and it was a hit. However, I will not be following this particular recipe again.
