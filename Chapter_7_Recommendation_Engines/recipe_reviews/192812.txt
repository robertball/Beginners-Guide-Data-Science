I used soy bean sprouts (instead of mung bean). I enjoy the large bean on the tip for added texture and what I think is a much better flavor (somewhat sweet). I am a huge sesame oil fan but if you are watching calories you can use an 1/8 cup instead of the 1/4 cup and it still has plenty of sesame flavor. I blanch the beans for a minute or two. I skip the vinegar.  I don't care for it in this recipe as I do other Korean recipes.  My husband is Korean and he thought this recipe was delicious!  My Korean mother in law is an amazing cook and I like this recipe better than hers.  Please don't tell.

I always use a large bag of soybean sprout simply because it has a nicer texture and the added crunch from the soybean gives it a better taste overall. I boiled my sprouts in hot water for 1 minute, then drained in a colander. For the seasoning, I did not use the full 1/4 cup of sesame oil called for in the recipe. It is a tad bit too much sesame oil and a waste of oil. I was taught to just eye ball and season to taste. For the most part I usually start with maybe 2T, then mix and taste. I left out the rice wine vinegar. I also used two green onioin stalks, finely sliced, a little rock salt to taste, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds, which were toasted in a pan. I leave out the korean hot chili pepper for personal preference. (most of my family cannot handle the spiciness). However, you don't need to add a lot of the korean pepper as it will get stronger as it marinates. I make sure all the sauce coats the sprouts well before chilling. I let the sprouts sit in the refrigerater to marry for a few hours before eating, though you could eat it right away. The flavor is much better when you let it sit for a while. I serve this with, "Kalbi(korean bbq ribs)," and "Korean-style Seaweed Soup," also on this website.

The soybean sprouts should have the actual soybean on the end (yellow).  You can usually find them like this at an Asian/Korean Market.  Our local grocery store doesn't carry the sprouts with the bean on the end.  Otherwise, this recipe was spot on.  Be careful with how much rice wine vinegar you add (go slow).  Also, I had to blanch my sprouts for longer than 15 seconds; more like 1 to 2 minutes.

Very tasty! I actually thought there was a little too much sesame oil, but other than that, a great blend of flavors! We will definitely make this again!

I have never had this before, so I cannot rate it based on what it should taste like.  However, I thought this was very good and easy and budget-friendly (since I had all ingredients on-hand except for the soybean sprouts and chile).  I did not use the Korean chile, because I did not have time to go to a specialty store, but I did mix in some red pepper flakes.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

This was really good, but it didn't taste like kim chi at all.  I don't know if my sprouts were mung bean or soybean, but they worked!  I started timing once the water came back to a boil and they came out perfect.  I didn't have Korean chili powder so I used cayenne (a lot less than 2 Tbsp. ), a little less sesame oil, and I used finely chopped leeks instead of green onions cuz that's all I had.  Came out fantastic.  The longer it sat, the better the flavors melded.  I've added this to my recipe box and will definitely make it again.  I'm sure the dressing would go very well on other lightly blanched veggies too.

I prefer to use the regular bean sprouts from the grocery store rather then the ones with the pod on the end.  I find the pod too strong of a taste.

I WILL make this again because I am really about exploring Korean food lately.   However, me and another foodie tasted it and we both agreed - "Needs something". . .I think the ratio of sesame oil to vinegar is off  - way too much oil and too little rice vinegar.   Even with the soy sauce in there, it may need some salt too, to taste.   I was excited to use Korean red pepper flake for something other than my kimchi.

Authentic flavours. I really like the addition of  vinegar and soy sauce; however, I decreased the amount of sesame oil to 1 Tbsp. I prefer to cook the beansprouts longer; at least 5-10 minutes. Sometimes, I use fish sauce. This will be delish in bibimbap! Thanks for sharing!

I am a bit confused about the amount of chili powder in this recipe.  I did not have korean chili powder, so I used my own.  Even so, the recipe came out much redder than I have ever seen and intensely chili-fied.  I have never had it that spiced.  Would have been better to use sriracha if I wanted that level of heat.  Otherwise, pretty straightforward recipe.

This dish is AWESOME! I added 1 teaspoon of powered ginger and 2 teaspoons of Chinese 5- spice . This will be a new addition to the monthly dinner rotation.

First time eating and making this dish and the family absolutely loved it!  Thanks to other reviews I cut the sesame oil down to 2 tbsp and I didn't have Korean chili powder so I used 1 tbsp of sirracha sauce instead and it was perfect.......a little spicy but we like that.  Everything else was as per the recipe.  This was the perfect complement to Korean BBQ flank steak, stir fried baby bok choy and some steamed jasmine rice.  What a dinner!  Thank you for posting!

This is good and very similar to the way my korean mom makes it, but WAY too much sesame oil.  I would take it town to 2 or 3 tablespoons.  Otherwise, delicious!

These soybean sprouts were delicious. The chili sauce/paste was a bit too smoky, but I didn't knock off any points to my rating bc I used regular chili poweder in lieu of Korean chili powder (as I didn't have the Korean type on hand). This might have made a difference on the smokiness. I balanced it out with the juice of 1 lime and a splash of rice vinegar. (I also followed previous posters' advice and lessend the amount of sesame oil. The paste/sauce was quite tasty when mixed in with the sprouts. The recipe as is was deserving of my 5star rating. However, I chose to add something crunchy: I sauteed raw top ramen noodles, slivered almonds and sesame seeds with butter on a skillet and then toasted them in the oven. I crumbled them up over the sprouts and it was just the right touch.

I couldn’t find Korean chili powder so I substituted “nanami togarashi” and I only added a teaspoon because I don’t like things too spicy. I also added more sesame oil because my family loved it and it came out great!

Tasted like what I order from Korean bbq restaurants but better because I made it at home for a fraction of the price! 
Followed others advice and used 1/8c sesame oil. Perfection! 1/4c would have been overkill. Also used the kikoman brand shoyu (soy sauce). Just yum. Can’t wait to see how much more yummy it’s going to be after it marinates in the fridge.....

I substituted regular chili powder & crushed red chili for the Korean chili powder, but otherwise followed the recipe faithfully. It's got great texture & aromas. I paired it with chicken fried rice, with spring rolls & gyoza on the side. Mix it into the rice as you eat, and it adds incredible depth & a nice crunch to the entree.

I sprouted mung beans and made this following the instructions as they were.  We all loved it!  The flavor was so beautiful and refreshing.  I will make this again.

Perhaps it is because I did not have the Korean chili powder, but I wasn't wowed by this recipe. It was just ok...maybe 3.5 stars though.

All is fine with the recipe except 15 seconds to cook is too little of time, it's a preference of course but most people would like it between 1-3 minutes at least

I have been going to an authentic korean restaurant owned by a little old lady. This recipe is exactly like hers, except it's a little on the spicy side. I loved it spicy because i'm used to it. however, if you can't tolerate or don't feel like tolerating spice I recommend using less of the chili powder.

I should've read the others' reviews before making this.  Definitely should have decreased the sesame oil by half.  And I think it's missing some flavor. I'll probably try again next time and dabble with different seasoning.

We made it with the reduced amount of sesame oil as suggested by the users.  We felt each person could add more if they wanted.  I added more vinegar and salt to mine because we found an amazing one in our oriental supermarket.  I loved it!

I made this with half of the Korean chile powder called for, and it still had a kick. I also threw in some Chinese chives that I had lying around, and steamed them as well. I didn't have toasted sesame seeds, so I left it out. Simple, easy, and delicious recipe. Will make again.

Nice recipe. I was going for how my mom cooks these and it's pretty close. I get the mung beans with the yellow bean on the tip from our asian store.  I also cooked them for about 5 minutes. And didn't use as much sesame oil as listed. If you like spicy, add more chile powder.

Oh my gosh! We've loved this. My husband grew up on a Japanese version, but we actually do like the Korean one better. Never knew this was so easy!

This was such a good recipe! Bean sprouts, I feel, are so bland by themselves, however with this recipe it really gave them the kick it needed and it serves as a great side dish!

Simple yet delicious. I was afraid the garlic would be overpowering; it was aromatic and only a little spicy.
