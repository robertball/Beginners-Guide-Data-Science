I took someone elses advice and I used 1 cup of whole milk and 1 cup of evaporated milk for mines. I made a double recipe so everything was doubled. I also used a stick of butter because I was doing two pies. Used the deep dish pie shells because regular would have not been deep enough. other wise great recipe and great aroma throughout my home. It isnt like moms but it was still a hit in my house.

The pie was very good & set up beautifully; however, brown on top because of too much nutmeg. Next time, I will use half of nutmeg & 3/4 c. sugar instead of 1c.

The taste and texture of this pie reminded me much of a flan pie, which is quite common here in Belgium. I thought it lacked a little bit of flavor, so next time I might increase vanilla extract, add cinnamon, or stir in some raisins soaked in rum. Excellent easy recipe, though!

This was missing something...butter. So I added butter to this recipe. But if you want something sweet and simple, this recipe is simple and you probably have all of the ingredients right in your cabinets.

This was a good pie but was a bit bland even with some adjustments. I'd added a bit more vanilla, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, substituted 1/4 c. of sugar with Splenda, and I only used 5 eggs instead of 6 (didn't want it to be too "eggy" tasting).  Next time, I may use egg substitute and I think I'll add a bit more sugar (or use some brown sugar) and add even more vanilla to see if it'll boost up the flavor.  This is a good base recipe to work with though.

excellent - custardy - messy though, glad I thought to use a cookie sheet to transfer into the oven - you definitely need a deep dish pie crust, or 2 standard pre-made.  thanks!

This pie was easy to make, it took around 10 minutes to prepare. It came out ok, it reminds me of Spanish Flan because of its texture. The best thing about this recipe is that all the ingredients are right in your pantry!

This was super-easy and quite good.  I think it's meant for a deep 9-inch crust, though, because I made a mess.  Next time I will probably halve the nutmeg and add more vanilla.

I loved this recipe. It was simple, very easy to make and tasted great! Only thing I would suggest is that the instructions include wrapping the crust with a ring of Aluminum foil to keep it from browning too much.

Egg custard pie has always been my favorite but this was the first time I have ever made it. It was just like my mom's egg custard pie - delicious!! I followed the recipe but baked the crust for a few minutes before pouring the egg into it.

I have to say that this is one mighty fine pie, as is, but when I halved the milk with 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk well then it took the flavor to another level. Amazing! I didn't change anything else. Yum!

Just made this pie. Doubled the recipe and used 2 deep dish pie crusts. My only variation was, I used condensed milk and not regular milk. Excellent flavor and it set up really nicely.

This recipe is very similar to my grandmother's recipe but she used cinnamon instead of paprika.  It turned out great but I did have to bake it a little longer than usual.  It could be my oven since I live in an RV but I think I will try to reduce the milk just a tad next time and see how it turns out.  Thanks for taking me down memory lane!

Quick, easy and delicious!  I followed recipe with exception of reducing sugar to ¾ cup because so many other people suggested, plenty sweet.  I did need to cook longer than recipe stated, I baked the 10 mins. at 475 then 45 minutes at 350.  Difficult to tell that pie is "set" just by looking at it, insert a butter knife in the center, when it comes out clean, it is done.  I thought the ½ tsp of nutmeg was just perfect but if you do not like nutmeg, reduce to ¼ tsp.  Batter is very thin and runny so I can see why several people stated that it was messy getting into the oven.  Fill the pie ¾ of the way, put in oven then fill pie to top with the remaining mix from a smaller pryex type bowl that you can pour from.  No mess.

Only thing I did different the 2nd time I made it was add more vanilla ( for a extra flavor) and used sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk and sugar.

I have made this twice; the first time exactly as the recipe called for - and it was a huge hit!  Very good!  The second time I was short on milk and used 1c milk and 1c heavy cream.  Holy, holy wow!   Exactly as is is  perfect, with heavy cream was a huge hit in my house.  Either way, excellent recipe!

Great! I did follow another review I saw and added extra vanilla, cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and a little bit more sugar...I do recommend doing it that way! Thanks, Evelyn!

A truly great & easy recipe.  I've searched high & low for a custard pie recipe that would remind me of my southern childhood.  This recipe is as close as one could possibly come without being an exact match.  I will definitely make this again.

Easy to prep, but took nearly twice as long in the oven – oven is fine, temperature regulation is OK – and the texture wasn’t particularly desirable. Also, it had more of an eggy flavor vs good custard, e.g. crème brûlée

Loved this Pie, I had to bake it a bit longer then director, I used a deep dish Pie Pan. But it came out great. I may reduce the eggs to 4-5 next time and only used a 3|4 cup of sugar. Yummy.

I did not make any changes!  My daughter said it was Delicious! My son-inlaw who usually does not eat dessert's gave it five stars. So I definitely will make again!

This recipe tastes very similar to the custard pie my grandmother used to make.  The taste brought back a lot of memories.

I used a deep dish pie crust so this recipe worked perfectly at filling the shell. I did, however, have to bake it 20 minutes longer because of the deep dish. I've tried several egg custard pie recipes and, so far, this was my favorite. Oh, I also forgot that I was out of nutmeg so I sprinkled cinnamon on top and it was delicious.

Very easy to make.  I added a touch more vanilla the second round, and lightly dusted the crust with and pressed it in before adding the filling.  Really made for a great custard pie.  A definite keeper of a recipe.

Ended up using 3/4 C sugar, made 2 pies, cook time was not what recipe said. 10mins at 475* then 50mins at 350*  turned out pretty yummy! Next time I'll remember that it needs forever to cook.

I hadn't had custard pie in a long time and I'm glad I found & tried this! The texture came out great, but I did add a teeny bit (~0.5 teaspoon) of flour because I was worried it'd come out too soft. Pretty sure I didn't need it. 
Other similar recipes call for about half the filling, and I'm glad I went with this one, otherwise I would have had a disappointingly thin layer of custard. The nutmeg ain't bad, but I didn't grow up eating it with nutmeg, so I'll probably leave it out next time. I'm also happy it's easy to throw together :D I have to agree with another reviewer that it tastes better at least the day after.

My SO really liked this and I have grown to like it as well, but it's not exactly the custard pie I'm used to. It's light and gelatinous, and the custard pies I've had are heavier/creamier and more dairy based I think. It is still delicious, though.

I added a dash of cinnamon for more flavor. Also took someone's advice and made it in a deep dish pie crust. Tasted just like my grandmother's. Great comfort dessert.

Loved the taste of this pie.  But for some reason, it didn't set for me.  Cooked it the longest length of time so it browned too much on top.  I have it in the fridge now hoping it will set more.  But loved the flavor while scooping it with the spoon.

I did make changes.   I used half the sugar called for and I just mixed everything all together on the ingredient list, oops then I read the instructions, it came out fine!.  I also had heavy cream so I used that instead of milk.  Would like to make them side by side to see how the flavor or texture varies from the milk vs. cream.  I thought it was an overall good easy recipe.  My hubby loves flan and this was an easy new treat, flan with a pie shell.  Thank you for the recipe.  I enjoyed it.   Also I don't have any nutmeg and not sure if family would enjoy the nutmeg flavor.  However I'd like to try it at least once with nutmeg.

It more or less incinerated in the oven at 475 degrees. It was black after 5 minutes. I must have done something wrong.

I've made this pie twice and it will be my go to custard pie.  It was really good both times and baked up perfectly.  I used less sugar than the recipie called for but I added a little coconut flavoring,  the seeds of a vanilla bean and plenty of nutmeg.   Delicious!  I changed the servings to 10 making it a deep dish pie.  I was skeptical at first about cooking  a custard pie at such high heat, 10 minutes  at 475°, then 25 minutes at 350° (I used the next to the lowest rack), but it worked and the pie was cooked evenly throughout.  I also pre-baked the crust so it wouldn't be soggy.  I will try this way of cooking custard in other recipies because in this pie, it is foolproof!

This recipe is flawed. I followed the recipe to a T and the top burned before the cook time was even completed. It required almost twice the instructed cook time to set up. And yes, my oven is calibrated and it baked in the lower third of the oven. Way too much sugar to cook at the instructed time and temp. I liked the ingredient list but back to the drawing board for proper baking instructions.

I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup for a pie that was just the right amount of sweetness. I also pre baked the pie crust so it wouldn't be soggy. Next time I will add a bit more nutmeg so it is more flavourful. A quick, easy pie that doesn't need anything else. It is better without ice cream or whipping cream.

I made this pie, it was pretty good, it does make a deep pie, but I used jumbo eggs.  It also needs a little something else, maybe butter.  DH liked it but I was disappointed because my baking sheet warped when I put it in the hot oven and it spilled all over the place.

Simple to make and very good, but to sweet for my taste, next time I will use less sugar.  No pie crust needed and it makes a nice thin crust.

Not the creamy texture I was hoping for. Will continue to search for the ultimate recipe.
