I liked this recipe up until it got the second cooking. After the three hours, it was tender and juicy. It had created its own sauce. Albeit, the roast was still very soft and not completely cooked, it looked appetizing. After the second time, the roast crisped up on the outside but almost all the juice evaporated. The flavor is very good, though. Thank you for the recipe.

I had a 4 lb prime rib roast so I adjusted the roasting time.  I brought the roast to room temp and then roasted it for 1 hour @ 400Â°. I turned the oven off and halfway through the process I turned the oven on the 10 minutes.  When the 3 hours were up the roast was done to perfection.

I love this recipe!  It allows me to go have brunch with my family and come back and finish roasting. Because I prefer my roast just past pink I roast about a half hour more at first.
