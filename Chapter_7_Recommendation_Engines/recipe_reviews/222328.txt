Easy and delicious - plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken! This way I didn't have to go to the trouble of poaching the chicken. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used Hellman's light mayo cut with a bit of reduced fat sour cream along with regular curry and the rest of the ingredients. It chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good. Overall, a great combination of flavors! Especially good on whole grain bread!

Delicious recipe! I really enjoyed the mix of flavors.  Made exactly as recipe shown twice.  I ended up adding a lot more curry just because we really like curry.  Thank you so much for sharing.  This is becoming my favorite way to use leftover chicken.  Yummmmm

Super yummy and healthy! I didn't have mango chutney so I diced one ripe sweet and firm mango instead and also added extra apple and celery. I only used half mayo and half greek yogurt. Served this as open face sandwiches for the family and for me, crackers. I will make this often!!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and loved the result. I used a tart Granny Smith apple; some might prefer a slightly sweeter variety but this totally worked for me.
