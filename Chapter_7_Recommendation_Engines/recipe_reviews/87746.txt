I've made this pie twice so far. It's really easy, and tastes great! I think 2 cups of fruit is too little though, so I added more. The second time I made it, I added more raspberries than cherries just cuz I like it tart! It's wonderful with a scoop of vanilla icecream. Oh- and if you add too much juice, it makes the crust soggy instead of crunchy.

This pie is so easy to make and it's sooo good! Be careful not to add too much liquid from the cherries and raspberries.  My favorite part is the  crumbly oat topping.  Try this pie!!

Ok, well I made this as a gift, and didn't get to taste it. However, based on the phone call I got this evening, I have to give this 5 stars. It was quick and easy to make, and I'm told it was delicious. Thanks!

Wasn't very impressed with this. The amount of berries wasn't nearly enough to cover the crust, and there was too much of the topping - didn't use it all.

Very quick and easy to make and it turned out great!  I did substitute canned apricots for the rasberries and added some lemon juice.

I made it with 2 cups  frozen mixed berries for a friend that requested mixed berry pie.  At first I thought it didn't make enough filling for the pie but after tasting it I realized it would have been too tart had it been made with more of the tart filling.  Loved how easy it was and made with not too much sugar!
