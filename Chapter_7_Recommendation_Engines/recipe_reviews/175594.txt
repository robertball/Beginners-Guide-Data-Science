This is the base for miso soup (among other recipes) and is what makes the soup so good!  Thank you for the easy recipe!

Excellent! Don't be afraid of adding the full amount of bonito flakes. It lends a smokey fish flavor to the stock that makes all the difference. Used this as the base for the Nabeyaki Udon soup that is on this site.

Great starter for any Asian recipe. Add ingredients of your liking for a delicious soup. I followed it to the letter of the recipe for a perfect stock. Itâ€™s important not to boil the seaweed, or it will get bitter and slimy.

This recipe is so simple and so elegant. Just a couple ingredients and water, it's all about technique for delicious flavor. Sometimes I don't use bonito, and make the stock with just dashi kombu
