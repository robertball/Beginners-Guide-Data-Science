Only 4 stars because the amount of garlic must be wrong.  I used a tablespoon and it tasted great.

If you are a cook that likes to experiment or modify recipes to make them your own and you are looking for a barbecue sauce recipe to try this is the recipe for you. This recipe has all of the essentials of what barbecue sauce should be. I added 1/4 cup of molasses, a tablespoon of ground chipotle peppers and I used smoked paprika with a few dashes of liquid smoke. My modifications suit a different taste (think Midwestern BBQ) but that's why this recipe is good. This recipe really lends itself to creativity.

This would have worked beautifully IF there was not 1/4 cup of garlic powder. One teaspoon would work well but otherwise garlic powder overload.
