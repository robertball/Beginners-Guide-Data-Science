This is almost identical to my favorite batter recipe.  However, the idea of substituting carbonated water for beer is marvelous! No other batter recipe I have ever read, has made that substitution suggestion.

These were easy and yummy! I sliced them really thin. Next time I will slice them a little thicker just because of the amount of time it took to fry 2 million skinny onion rings. I also wish I had used peanut oil, since it fries better than regular vegetable oil. Still, they definitely get two thumbs up.

Boy these are good! Cheap snack... Only thing I did  different is that I cut onions (1/2 in.cut thick, they shrink), soaked in coldwater while I was doing everything else. Dusted in flour or bisquik, in a ziplock...then into the batter! Batter should foam abit before you use, beer and flour combo makes bubbles! Absolutely picture perfect onion rings! I would have taken a pic but...I ate them! Freezing about a dozen to see if they will work frozen....

The Best! I used Red Onions, Perrier water (instead of beer), and added cajun season salt to the flour.  Very light, and flavorful!!

i love this batter.  i've used it numerous times to make onion rings, as well as calamaris and cubed mozzerella.  i replaced part flour with italian seasoned breadcrumbs to add extra flavor and it's just delicious.

Good one!  A lot less doughy than those premade onion ring batters.  Also, don't forget to increase the beer by another can.  You don't add anymore to the recipe, but you do need to keep from getting dehydrated while standing in front of that hot fryer.  What can I say...it's Wisconsin!

These were delicious - made these for the guys on game night with burgers, and not a single one was left over for me. Technically, I guess I could say this review is my boyfriends, he raved about them and immediately found beer was the secret ingredient. Will be making them again so I can actually try some next time!

Wow! I tried numerous onion rings recipes and this one tops them all. Could even be used as a basis for tempura vegetables, with a touch of powdered ginger.

Great recipe. Very close to my own. I find if I use half AP flour and half corn starch, the onion rings stay crispy for a long time. One tip is do not drain on paper towel but, a cooling rack set over paper towels. I use this for shrimp and fish too. For seafood I sometimes add a lime flavored sparkling water and some Old Bay seasoning and a touch of garlic powder. Be sure to pat seafood dry before dipping, then fry as usual. Great for veggies and mushrooms too. Make the batter a little thicker for chicken and steak fingers and experiment with seasonings to your taste.

Excellent base recipe!  I also dredged the onion rings in flour before dipping them in the batter-- great idea to help the batter stick.  Definitely need to add salt, and some spices if you're up for it.  I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp seasoning salt, and 1 tsp cajun seasoning and some freshly ground black pepper.  We still had to salt them after frying them, an easy problem to fix next time.  This batch was enough for one large onion.  I pan-fried these in about two cups of canola oil, had to flip some of the large ones once.   We dipped these in the sauce from allrecipe's Blooming Onion and Dipping Sauce.  What a special treat for our family!  And we didn't have to step foot into a certain steakhouse!

GREAT base recipe!!! It's everything it promises to be. However I found it a little bland and think I may play around with the seasoning. All so the 4 onions it calls for must be normal cooking onions and not large. I barely (actually didn't) had enough to do two large onions. Double it.

If your onion rings taste like 'flour and oil', your oil is not hot enough. These turned out to be superb! I added garlic salt, fresh ground pepper, and thyme to my batter. Also mine turns out thick... probably the type of beer I'm using. I just add more beer till the consistency is what I need. 

I make friend mushrooms, onions, and shrimp with this batter.

It's a good base to the batter. I did it to the recipe the first time, and the batter was a little bland. I however made a few changes the next time and they were much better. I added Red Robin season to it as well as some garlic powder and papkria. And if you have a counter top fryer with a basket, don't use the basket, the batter seeps through and they stick terrible.

I am not generally the type of person who follows recipes. I cook by taste and usually read recipes in order to get ideas...then amp them up myself so to speak. I wanted a quick snack and went for these rings because they had what looked like awesome reviews. HOWEVER. I followed the recipes EXACTLY to a tee and these onion rings were BLAND BLAND BLAND...no flavor whatsoever. The batter was extremely thick and before even making the recipe I knew the ingredients were very few and far. all adding up to a very bland and flavourless onion ring. however..with dipping sauce they were edible. I attepted these onion rings again with a few additions which made this recipe much better. For those of you looking for a bit more flavor I added: 1 tsp garlic powder. 1tsp garam masala. 1tsp Chinese hot sauce 1/2 tsp bbq seasoning. (Also add the Salt and pepper to tast, so however much YOU prefer) This recipe is what I would call a "Base" recipe for onion rings....add whichever flavors you feel would compliment it, and you cant go wrong :)

Hope this works out for you better than me

I've been using this recipe for over 30 years now. They are the best and we like them if the onion is sliced a bit on the thick side.  Put's all other recipes to shame!

This is the recipe that I use to make onion rings all the time, and I have for years. It is also good for fish,and other veggies. You can make the batter a bit thicker with a little extra flour which helps it to stick on the onion better. Make sure your grease it very hot too!

Not only was this one of the easiest recipes on this site, but it was a HIT with my 8-y/o nephew, as well as his 17-y/o brother.  I used unflavored mineral water in place of the beer.  Used equal parts of water/four and added a pinch of sea salt.  I will be making this again to fry not only onions, but broccoli and cauliflower (and maybe will try pickles) as well.  Thank you for this EASY recipe!!!?

Great recipe. I think next time I will use seasoning salt, since I used white onion. That way they will not come out so sweet!

Loved the batter concept. I like a little more crunch so used the batter and dipped in bread crumbs (personal preference). Also did some pickles the same way and they turned out GREAT. Figured since I was going to the trouble I might as well make the most of it!

I don't normally remember to review recipes, but these were so delicious that I had to.  I almost didn't make these because they seemed to easy.    They met my onion ring criteria - crunchy and not to much thick batter.  I dipped them in panko after the batter (recommended by another reviewer) which turned out great and added texture.  I also added tobasco and cajun seasoning to the batter.  I threw some pickles at the end because there was a little bit of batter leftover, and they were delicious also.

We've been trying to find a onion ring recipe for a short while - a recipe with batter (not just dry ingredients) is the key.  This recipe was decent but nothing special.

This recipe was GREAT!  I made a few small changes.  I used O'Doul's instead of real beer, I added about 1 1/2 t. Old Bay Seasoning along with the salt and pepper.  And last, but not least, after coating the onion rings with the batter, I dipped them in panko bread crumbs.  WOW!!  Extra crunchy and beautiful golden brown!  Left my camera at work, so took a pic with my phone but can't figure out how to send it to the computer from the phone.  Will post a pic as soon as I get that taken care of.  :-) Thanks for sharing this recipe...it is wonderful!

Pay no attention to the nay-sayers of this recipe - it is REALLY good.  Only change: salt and pepper to taste, not pinches.  Otherwise, crispy and delicious!

Simple and very delicious. Everyone raved. :) The batter only covered 2 medium-sized sliced onions for me though (but I was pretty generous in coating them). I also fried them in about 2/3 palm shortening and 1/3 coconut oil (vegetable oil is very UNhealthy). Will definitely make again.

I've been making these onion rings for years and I have to say they are the best I've ever tasted. After I mix the batter I cover and let it sit at room temperature for two hours to give the yeast in the beer time to activate with the flour. They turn out light and flaky. They freeze well too. Take them out of the freezer and bake for 10 minutes at 425 degrees.

This was so good! Since my husband drank the last beer minutes before making this, I used a lemon-lime soda instead(ea: 7-UP, Sprite). Work just as well. I made both onion rings and a "blooming" onion. Nice and fluffy. My son begged me to fry him just the batter, he loved it. I'll be making this every chance I get. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Quick and easy! I thought the onion rings needed more salt than just a pinch, so I added approx. 1/2 tsp. salt to the batter. Very good!

These are so much better than the ones you can buy in the stores, and they are half the cost too. I was beginning to think that I couldn't make enough for my family. They would eat them as soon as they came out of the pan.  Thanks so much for the GREAT recipe!!

VERY good base recipe! You got to eyeball the ingredients and make the batter to a consistency of your liking. I added dashes of salt, pepper, seasoning salt, onion powder & garlic powder to the batter. I also added a dash of tabasco sauce. These may very well be my favorite rings!!! The beer makes all the difference!

Used this batter for mushrooms and onion rings.  Turned out great!!  Did add a little extra salt and some garlic powder for flavor.  I'm happy this recipe didn't need to sit for an hour like others on all recipes.

WOW!! This was my first time ever making inion rings and they are awesome!! I only used 2 onions, but they were the vadalia's.  I did half exactly as written and the other half shaken in flour first.  The only difference was that the floured ones  browned where the others only got slightly golden. They tasted exactly the same though. AWESOME recipe!!!! I ate half of them while cooking! ;-) THANKS for a great recipe!!

Really, really, really good!  I used O'Doul's non alcohol beer, and I did add paprika and seasoning salt to the batter, per the suggestions of many.  I can see how some kind of seasoning was necessary.  But with the added seasoning, they were absolutely delicious--light and crispy.  I'd love to try this batter on chicken fingers, and probably will.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I've been looking for a Fried Onion Ring recipe and I'm glad I found this. It’s such a great recipe to use as a base.  After reading everybody's comments, I used 3/4 cup flour instead of 1 cup and added 1 tablespoon Essence, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon paprika along with more than a pinch of salt and pepper.  I soaked the rings in buttermilk with enough Texas Pete to make it pink.  Then I shook them in a bag with corn meal before putting them in the beer batter mixture.  After cooking I put them on a rack and sprinkled Lowery’s seasoned salt over them.  They came out great.

I loved these rings. I used carbonated water, added 1t salt, and 1/2t pepper to the batter. I also found it easier to let the onions sit in the batter until I was ready to put them in the oil (this helped the batter stay on better). They taste like funyons (just missing the garlic flavor). Yummy.

The batter for these onion rings was light, crunchy and delicious. I used carbonated water instead of beer.My husband's biggest complaint about onion rings is that they are never thin enough. He cut onions to his specifications and gobbled the fried rings up greedily. We skipped supper that night.

The basic ingred. for recipe are great but you NEED to add A LOT of all purpose seasoning and salt. I also added egg and/or egg whites to batter. Also salt after cooking. Our family loved it (with alterations)!

Ok, call me stupid, but I didn't think this would taste like ONLY beer.  Yes, it's called for in the recipe, but I thought it'd be subtle, instead, it was really overpowering.  If you like beer, then these are for you.  Won't be making again.

Great light batter.  Season to taste with Old Bay.  Best when batter sits covered countertop for minimum 1 hour.  Keep warm in 200* oven.  Cooked rings do freeze well - reheat gently in oven.

3.5 stars.  The batter was light and crispy.  But perhaps I prefer a more substantial "crunch" on my rings.  The coating was just like a fish and chip coating and I don't think I like this on onion rings.  I've tried "old-fashioned onion rings", which is much better in my opinion albeit a lot more effort but totally worth it.

I made these last night with grilled burgers and they were fabulous.  Hubby is crazy for onion rings and he loved these.  Very simple, quick and delicious.  I prepared exactly according to the recipe.  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks Gourmetfox!

Following the batter instructions left me with a very thick, chunky batter.  Wasn't sure if adding more beer would be a wise idea so I just diluted it with water.  After tasting the first batch I wasn't super impressed.  Added extra salt (probably a total of 1.5 tbs) and the second batch came out delicious.

Very good. I added garlic powder, Tony Chachere's, pinch of cayenne pepper & Tobasco to the flour. Turned out great..kinda like a tempura batter. Make sure to drain well. Will use again and add other veggies. Thanks!

We had these tonight and two people (of five) thought they were good.  I didn't like them at all.  I generally really like beer batter, but this one was bland and so fluffy that you couldn't taste the onions (which were fairly thick slices).

We were having Tillamook cheddar cheese burgers (I made the patties with Lipton onion recipe soup & dip mix- delicious!) and I wanted to try something other than the usual oven baked fries that we always have with burgers. I needed something quick as it was getting late. This recipe was great; as it didn't call for many ingredients and I already had the ones it requires at home (that's a big plus in my book). I made the first batch and thought the mix was mediocre at best. To spruce up the next batch I added a generous helping of Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning and a pinch of onion powder. The second batch was perfect! This batter really needs that extra seasoning to take it over the top. Otherwise it's just kind of bland. I’d give this recipe 2 1/2 stars without Tony Chachere's, 4 1/2 with it!

Thank for sharing this recipe.  It is so simple and so yummy!  It is crispy and stays that way, even my picky eaters loved it.  We also used it with broccoli, sweet potatoes, which turned out great.   Batter need time to get crispy, so it's great with veggies... not so much with fish, shrimp, and the like.  Far as people saying it needs seasoning... well... we love to dip, so not necessary!

Great batter and teriffic onion rings. My wife and kids loved them.  I opted to use Perrier instead of beer. Worked great.  Also - I added a dash of Cajun seasoning.  This recipe easily converts for smaller portions.  I reduced everything by a fourth as I really only needed to use one onion to make wonderful rings to top some burgers from the grill.  I can see myself using this batter to coat fish on nights I'd like to indulge in pub style fish and chips with a beer. Great onion ring recipe!

Turned out perfect. Couldn't of asked for a better result. Batter coated the onions well, the taste is suitable for dining out. 5 stars. I added garlic powder to the mix, it was subtle enough to compliment. (:

Great basic recipe.  I didn't have any beer, or sparkling water, so I used a small can of 7-up.  It worked perfectly.  I think you just need something with fizz.  I omitted the salt & pepper, added a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning & a 1/2 tsp of sugar.  The onion rings were perfect.  This is definitely a keeper!

Wow! I was skeptical, since restaurant and pub style onion rings are always so great that attempting homemade ones may turn out less than desirable. These were amazing! I just heated 1 qt (4 cups) canola oil in a deep skillet- and for the batter I used Coors Light Beer and threw in a little extra pepper than what the recipe called for and also added Weber Grill seasoning salt. They came out puffy and crispy and golden brown delicious! Tasted like those you can get at carnival's and state fairs. Will definately be making these again, and also I think this exact recipe would be a phenomenal batter for shrimp- will be trying that also! =)

I was looking for a recipe to make fried onion "threads" as a topping for a grilled salmon salad and wanted a batter that would not overpower the thin onion rings. This was exactly what I was looking for. It is a perfect onion ring recipe. Updated 6/14/09 - I've since made these a couple of times using wider rings and still love them. They're good dipped in Hidden Valley's Spicy Ranch dressing - just like a Bloomin' Onion! Tonight I'm doing onion "chips" in the hope that I can fit more in the pan and cook faster.

This was the first time I had ever made onion rings. I dont like to fry food mainly because of what it makes my house smell like but these were really looking good! The beer batter was great! Be sure your onions are very dry or the batter won't stick. These had wonderful crunch and wonderful taste!

This is a keeper!  I use the batter for broccoli,mushrooms,cheese curds,etc.. Anytime I make this, I make at least a double batch of batter because after frying extras I just pop leftovers in the freezer and have 'em handy for whenever!  I just put the frozen rings or veggies on a cookie sheet in the oven @ 375 and reheat until they are heated through and crispy! I have even reheated these on foil in the grill when it was too hot to crank up the oven. YUMMY!!

Sensational and just what I was looking for.  If you want something spicy, like you'd get at Outback, or Applebee's you'd want to kick it up a notch w/red pepper or hot sauce in the batter, which is easy to do.  I stuck to the recipe as printed.  I used vidalia, sliced thin and only did a small batch at a time in my Fry Daddy, keeping them warm in the oven on paper towel-lined baking sheets.  Sadly, I was alone at the time, and ate a pretty big batch all by myself.  I hid the Fry Daddy after tasting this recipe....it's that good.

i've made this multiple times, and i use it for all the finger foods that can be deeply fried.  it's very forgiving.  i've replaced it with my japanese tempura batter, and sometimes when i don't have beer, i use carbonated water.  works just as good.

Yum Yum Easy Easy. The best I've ever had! If the batter seems to thick, just keep adding beer until it gets to consistency of pancake batter.

EW. I was looking for a carnival-style onion rings recipe and this sounded like a close match, but these were atrocious. Following the recipe exactly, these taste very strongly of beer, and I hate the taste of beer, so if you don't like it either, don't bother.

I tried other reviewers suggestions of dipping the oninons in flour first and extra seasoning. The batter hardly clung to the oninons and I added 2 tbsp of salt and some pepper and the taste was so bland! Horrible!

I agree with the previous reviewer that this is more like a tempura which is fine with me. It is a little bland but the sweetness of the onions comes through nicely to make up for the lack of seasoning. Also it would be a good idea to lightly dust the onions in flour before putting them in the batter. It helps the batter adhere better.

Tried this batter on Vidalia Onions and they didn't turn out real well. The last three onion rings I tried, cooked perfectly.  Does the batter need to sit for a while?   I would probably try this recipe again after letting the batter sit for a few minutes.

This is virtually the same recipe our family made since I was a kid, with one major difference: we start by soaking the onion rings in buttermilk first. It's best to soak them for about two minutes, but if you're in a hury, just dredge them through the buttermilk and then the batter. They ALWAYS get rave reviews!!

Good  recipe but bland.  To make it better I replaced a third of the flour with cornstarch. Also added garlic salt and onion powder to recipe. Very crispy and flavorful.

I gave this recipe a try. My guy LOVES his onion rings.  He likes a thin, crisp, ring.  This recipe did it!  If you want a thick, full, coating, this is not for you; however, we got what WE wanted!  I did have to add a bit more seasoning- preventing a 5 star review.  I added what I knew we would like (Cajun seasoning, seasoned salt, pepper) and they were fantastic!  Definitely a recipe to remember.  And, now, my two year old is a fan as well!  She LOVED her onions!  Thanks!

These were amazing! I went with the carbonated water, and I can only imagine them being better with beer. Because I am on the candida diet, I substituted the flour with brown rice flour and opted for olive oil for frying. I wasn't expecting much with all of these substitutions, but they were wonderful (with a little more salt) and the consistency was perfect. Thanks for the great, easy, cheap, adaptable and satisfying recipe!

I am only giving this a 4 because if I hadn't read the reviews and followed some of the other reviews, they wouldn't have turned out.  With the changes I would give this a 5.  I added garlic powder, seasoning salt, paprika to the flour mixture.  I had to use a lot more than 1 cup of beer so the batter wasn't quite as thick.  I dredged the onions in flour first which helped with the batter staying on the onions.  I didn't even have enough batter to coat 3 onions and they weren't that large.  If you followed this to a tee, I think they would be pretty bland.  I will make them again and just double the flour mixture.

Very simple and very tasty. The batter has a very mild flavor. I suggest adding spices or hot sauce to the batter before frying.

Great! I've made these numerous times & folks claim I make the best they have ever eaten, thanks to this recipe. I fry mine in deep oil at 345 degrees as I find this temp keeps the onion from pulling out of the coating when you bite into the ring. I do add various seasons to the batter depending on my mood. I discovered it's not a bad coating for fish in a pinch, cut the fish smaller pieces & dip.

Mmm... not too heavy of a batter. I don't think it needs any extra beer, like previous reviewers have recommended. Made according to the recipe, except added some spices (Chili powder, garlic powder and cayanne pepper) to taste. Will definitely use again, thanks.

My guys loved these, but I was disappointed. I had a really hard time coating the rings but just did the best that I could - and the coating didn't seem very flavorful although I followed the recipe exact - but my biggest disappointment was how the batter really absorbed the oil - I had my setting set according to the recipe, the batter just absorbs it apparently.

Super simple ingredients, really easy to make and tastes pretty good. May want to increase or add different spices but I like mine a bit saltier. Used a light beer and worked great.

This was very easy to make, and tasted very good. great way to use up onions. It was a little bland to me, so I used seasoning salt instead of plain salt for the second batch, but otherwise, this was great!

This is a good basic recipe, but needs a bit more "zest" in my opinion.   I added season all, old bay, more salt and more pepper.

Easy and effective! I prefer more flavor so I would add more salt/seasoning the next time, but that is of course to taste.  I used MGD so the beer flavor was light, maybe a fuller bodied brew would give it a bolder flavor.  At it's core it is a good batter recipie and would work well for many foods.

This batter was so easy!  I fried the onion rings and some zucchini medallions in the deep fryer.  The batter turned out crispy and light.  For seasoning I used garlic salt and black pepper.  Dipped the fried zucchini in some warm spaghetti sauce topped with mozzarella.  Just like the ones you get in a pub.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing!

This was good- I thinned out batter- thought it was too thick.... added garlic - dipped in flour (seasoned) first to help batter adhere- make sure oil hot- kept oven warm- sliced onion thicker so as not to be frying onion rings for hours...  Gave 4 stars only, not because this recipe is not good, but because I've had better-- I love Guy Fieri's beer batter onion rings..I think they are my favorite...  Soak onions in buttermilk for 2 hours before frying...

I used my husband's homebrew in this recipe and it turned out great! The beer was a Saison (French style) and I used about 1 1/4 cup. I also added a few tablespoons of cornmeal for texture and I ended up with enough batter for one onion and 4 small zucchinis.

Very good - added Cayenne Pepper since we love spicy food.  Hubby loved them!  Will definitely make again but next time with more Cayenne! Also sprinkled salt immediately after cooking and only used one large onion.

I almost gave up on making onion rings.  I have tried a few times in the past and they just didn't come out right.  This recipe has got to be the easiest, tastiest in the world, lol  I guess I always thought the more batter on the onion, the better, but nope... this batter is lightly runny.  Just a thin layer on the onion is PERFEEEEEEEECT! Drop it in the oil and..... YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!! THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING :)

Oh my goodness! SO good! Quality, beer-battered onion rings are pretty expensive and I figured way too hard to make. Then I saw this and figured why not try it? Easy and WOW good.   Only one problem. If I gain weight... I blame this recipe. haha!

I have tried many onion ring recipes  on this site and this is by far the best and the easiest! I subbed seltzer for beer. Also added onion and garlic powders as well as paprika to the batter. I cut the slices fairly thick and dredged them in plain flour first to help the batter stick to the onions...worked like a charm. I fried them in safflower oil in my cast iron fry pan. I kept them hot in a slow oven while I made enough for everyone. We had these with cola burgers and slaw. Fabulous with a squeeze of ketchup! Needless to say it was a tremendous hit! Will be sticking to this recipe! Thank you sooooo much!

This recipe is as simple as it gets. I just got done testing, fried pickles with this batter. The batter was light and crispy. I will add more spices to this next time. So while testing the pickles I figured why not try the onions, GOOD! Then I thought I would look in the fridge for other ideals. Hot pepper rings were next to try. Since they were very thin the batter was tin also. So I cooked them about 40 sec removed them. And then re-coated with batter. The second frying closed the hole in the pepper ring, very good! This is a keeper recipe for me. Thank you very much. P.S. I had more time I would have tried shrimp. I know it would have been great.

These were fabulous, we were eating them faster than they could come out of the frier.  I did use more beer and added some lawry's seasoning, red pepper, garlic powder, and 1/4 c breadcrumbs....they were perfect and had plenty of flavor.  This amount of batter only made one large onion though so if you need more double the batter.  One big onion made plenty for two people as an appetizer.  Will make again.

This is a good base recipe for onion rings, but the batter needs some tweaks to make it more flavorful. I added some garlic powder and seasoned salt to the batter, and also sprinkled the rings with seasoned salt when they came out of the fryer. I doubled the flour and the beer, and it was just about enough to coat 2 large onions. I can't imagine not doubling the batter and then using 4 onions, it just wouldn't be near enough batter in my opinion. These are great with ketchup.

Very easy to make--much easier than my standard recipe. They were nice and crispy. My husband ate a whole mountain of them. He kept telling me how good they were. But, I thought they tasted a bit oily (rather greasy)  even though I took pains to see that they were well drained. Since this is one of those high calorie treats I make only once or twice a year, I'll go back to my old reliable recipe which is similar to all recipes' Old Fashioned Onion Rings.  This would be a good recipe to try if you've never made onion rings.

Super Recipe!!! I have tried 4 or 5 different onion ring recipes before this, and this one is by far my favorite.  Only four ingredients for the batter, and it's as good as, or better tasting than any other in my experience. Quick, easy, and yummy! Thanks!

These were the best onion rings I have ever had, they would rival even the best rings at any local steakhouse.  I had to play with the consistency a bit to get the amount of coating I wanted which probably ended up being a bit more beer.  I also added cayenne sersoning to the batter.  After they were done frying (in a deep fryer) I sprinkled them with a mixture I always have of 1/2 season salt and 1/2 garlic salt.  These tasted amazing!!! The best advice I can give if don;t slice the onions too thin as they will shrink, and be warned that they will stick together so some of my batches were more like a onion loaf than rings but he taste was awseome.

The onion rings came out a little thin/too light.  And I think the batter lacked a little flavor.  Be sure to add some spices like cayenne or paprika or something witha little more gusto.

These are really really good, and I would have given them 5 stars except with only 1 cup of beer to 1 cup of flour the batter was more like dough and would not coat the onions, so i had to add at least a half cup of beer. I would also suggest adding some spies for depth but it is a great starter recipe. Thanks

I made as recipe stated, however, I noticed the 1 cup of beer was not enough.  I used 1 12oz can of beer.  Added cumin, paprika, season salt, pepper and garlic powder to the batter as well.  Soaked the onions in water and dropped them in a gallon bag with seasoned flour then dredged in the batter.  (MAKE SURE TO DRAIN EXCESS FLOUR WHEN TRANSFERING FROM GAL BAG TO BATTER AS THE BATTER WILL THICKEN TO PLA-DOH CONSISTENCY-to fix, add more beer and let set.)  I used wooden skewers as my guides to drop in the batter and then a different one to scoop the cooked ones out. BTW-don't have a deep fryer so I used a cast iron skillet and veggie oil.  Turned out AMAZING!  A great recipe!

These are really good.  I did use the beer because I was making it for hubby.  We both said that while it was good, we like my regular recipe just a little bit better.  Thanks for the post.

These are so very good. The best I have ever made in fact. My son keeps asking me to make them again. I used the carbonated water and it worked great! I also used vidalia onions. So easy to make, and light and crispy to eat. Thanks for this recipe!!

I used this recipe for our annual Fry Fest (eat everything deep fried and don't do this for another year!!!)  I used vidallia onions and tried some shrimp in the batter, as well.  It coated the food beautifully and held together great, which is what I was looking for.  Easy, easy.  Good simple recipe for a batter.  Season as you wish, before and after.

These were the easiest onion rings I have ever made!  Other recipes I have tried required beating eggs and so forth, yet didn't produce anything better than these.  They fried up perfectly and were so light and crispy. I added a bit more salt and pepper, but that was all.  My husband and I both loved them.  We will be having these quite often!

First time making onion rings. We thought the salt content was not enough at first then added to much, so they came out very salty. But next time I think I will add some other spices to the batter.

Decent, but could use a little more flavor.  Try more salt, or add salt when they're drying.

This was so easy!  Although a little bland, with more pepper and other spices this could easily become a standard.  The best thing is if you run low on batter, there are only a few ingredient so making more on the spot is a breeze - unlike more complicated (and not as tasty) recipes.  Coating the onion slices in flour before battering helps the batter adhere.  All in all, this is a great recipe, thanks!!

I used sweet onions and seasoned my flour with Jack's Stack seasoning and Emeril's seasoning.  I dredged them in flour first, then in the batter.  Everything else I did the same.  They were really good and crispy.  I will keep this recipe with my changes.  Thanks!

I thought these were some of the best onion rings I had ever tasted.  I think the trick is to use sweet onions.  I read in a recipe to dust the onion rings with flour before putting them into the batter.  This will help the batter adhear to the onion better.  I made these for our super bowl party and they got rave reviews.  This is a keeper.

I've tried this recipe twice now, once exactly as it's written and once with the addition of an egg.  Adding the egg makes a huge difference in adding a little crunch to the finished rings!  I also used stout beer with both recipes, and the flavor was great.

These are very good and VERY easy to make!  We added more salt, pepper and some cayenne to the batter.  It is a good idea to let the batter sit for a few minutes before using; as well, the amount of batter this recipe makes isn't nearly enough, double it!

These onion rings are OOOOHHHH SSOOO easy to make!!  I was surprised at the simplicity of them.  My family really enjoyed every bite. Needless to say there were NO leftovers. I can't wait to use this batter on zucchini.  Thanks for the simple recipe!!  It's definitely a keeper!

Yeah baby! A definite winner, though I ran out of batter with just three onions.  I must have been leaving too much batter on the rings.  It's hard for me to believe too, but I used my last beer on these, so I grabbed some lemon-lime pop and that worked okay to finish out the onions.  I used yellow onions--will try another variety next time--the yellow onions are fine for routine cooking as an ingredient, but I'm guessing one would do better with another variety when the onion is the central ingredient--as it is in this recipe.

These onion rings were great, but I thought that they were a bit sweet. I'm sure that can easily be fixed, though, by using a more bitter beer next time and a not-so-sweet onion.

These are the best.  Did have to scale to 12 and have a glass of bok with it.  I used a dark beer and the flavor was wonderful.  I had a smiling dh ear to ear.  Good for Channukah, used olive oil and peanut oil combo.  One problem, the kids eat them before they ever get to the table so I gave up and fed them standing.  LOL

These are yummy and super quick!  Like most fried food they should be eaten right after draining and they do not re-heat well. They're light, airy, cripsy, everthing you could want in an onion ring.

Voila ~ The PERFECT comfort food!! They don't get much better than this. Outstanding ...wouldn't change a thing. Coming home from church today a thought INSTANTLY popped into my head, "Oooooh, wouldn't those French Fried Onion Rings taste perfect right now!" For some reason that thought quite often crosses my mind. Thanks Jill, you done VERY good with this one. :-)

Delicious and just the right taste, only problem I had was with the sparse coating the batter gave the onions.  Had to add a considerable amount of flour...  Very very easy.

Superb! wanted something fried and I'm vegetarian..only veggie I had in stock that would work. So easy that my husband did it and said he could make these everyday. I forgot the black pepper but it was still devine...Very crunchy. No more buying onion rings. Way better than your favorite restaurant ones too

Great recipe! But next time will add more seasoning, I think they lack flavor a bit with just the pinch of salt and pepper.

Very very bland! Also, 4 onions are way to much for the batter. I used about 1 1/2  onions and the batter was gone.

They were pretty good, but not great.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I see now how some reviewers said they were bland, which I somewhat agree with.  Still, my wife and I enjoyed them.  I've seen this recipe elsewhere, but it includes tips on using ice cold onions and cold batter, so maybe it is in the way I made them not the recipe.

The batter stays on so this is a great recipe.  I think it needs more salt and spices but that is always personal option that is easy to adjust.  I used one giant onion and this was the correct amount.  I have half left and they rewarmed in oven back to crisp.  I plan to try the batter on fish.

Delicious - although the batter is super messy! I added seasoned salt, garlic, pepper and a bit of sugar to the batter. Will most likely make again however will add more liquid as my batter was a tad too thick.

Made a batch for my family and I, it was a real hit especially since I had substituted the beer with ginger ale instead, which gave it a nice ginger taste to them. I had also added a few other spices to the batter itself to give it more flavor.
I would make these again, since they're much lighter then normal onion rings.

I tried this recipe and it was delicious. The only difference was that I used my deep fat fryer.
The onion rings turned out so crunchy and tasty. 
Thanks!

We loved them. I used Peligrino sparkling water in place of beer, seasoning salt in the batter, and canola oil to fry. Awesome.

this was the first time that i was able to make successful battered onion rings. they were great but i felt they were a little plain in flavor, halfway through i put lots of garlic and cajun seasonings and it spiced them up a bit.  but my boyfriend and his two year old daughter had no problem scarfing them down. so they are a winner in my book.

I was shocked how easy and successful these were! I made them to top some steaks and they were great! I've tried making onion rings before and the batter NEVER stuck to the onions. These were soooo easy and with such simple ingredients.
NOTE: 5/8/10 - Made these again last week when I had a craving something crunchy -- BUT did not have any beer or soda water --only caffeine free, diet coke -- of all things !  Well, I tried it and they were GREAT -- my husband went on and on about them. I assure you, they tasted nothing like coke!

This was super easy (few ingredients) and so delicious with my husband's favorite beer--Summit. It takes forever to fry all the rings, but it's so worth it. Can't wait to make them again! My husband was over the moon.

I've just made these about an hour ago for my boyfriend and he LOVED them. It's the first time I made onion rings from scratch. I didn't have any beer so I used perrier (sparkling) water instead. They were awesome! Crunchy and not soggy or greasy at all. The batter is so simple to make, I recommend you try them!

Oh my gosh, these are sooooooooooooooooo good.  My bottle of carbonated water was a bit flat, but these still turned out great.  I lightly salted while the onion rings were hot.  Everyone couldn't stop eating them.  Thanks so much for the post.

These were wonderful -used non alcohoic beer and it worked really well - crispy and just the right amount of coating - could still taste the onion.

Once we got our technique down (double dipped onion rings in batter and made sure the oil was definetly hot enough--makes a huge difference!)...these were out of this world! We could have ate a whole second batch! Loved them--thank you!

Use less oil and use (1 tsp) Jamaican jerk seasoning, if you get a chance.  My husband declared, "these are the best onion rings I think I've tried" (and he does not throw out compliments).  I used a deep and wide, heavy pot and only 1 1/2 c of oil, and it was plenty (because I flipped them once anyway).

Very good and easy. But as written this was only enough batter for one large onion. I added cajun seasoning for some kick.

This is a simple fantastic recipe.  I have used it for zucchini as well as onion rings.  Batter may seem a bit runny but it adheres to whatever you are dipping into it,,,,,,and fries well also.

These were pretty good, but not fantastic. As others have said, I was hoping for a bit more flavor. Overall, they were pretty decent with ketchup. :)

These were really good onion rings. My husband said they were the best he's ever had, but I thought they lacked something in the flavor. I will definately make this again, but maybe try adding some seasonings.

I did not have beer and used perrier as another reviewer suggested - these were really really good.  I said four stars because I would like them to have a little more flavor.  I added extra seasoning but next time I will make two changes.  I am going to try vidalia onions and more seasonings in the batter.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great recipe. Definitely a keeper.  I used a little more beer and I sauteed the onions as someone else suggested then coated them in seasoned flour (salt, pepper, paprika) shook off the excess then put them in the batter...I fried them in the oil to basically "cook" (about 3 minutes or so...they would be almost be gloppy) I removed the onions from the oil drained them off; let them cool to room temp reheated the oil & fried them again...they came out super crunchy...they were more like strings which is what I was aiming for & used them to top off on grilled hamburgers w/barbeque sauce.

These were AWESOME!!! I would have given it 5 stars but I added seasoned salt, garlic powder and pepper. The recipe needs more spices than originally called for. I used carbonated water instead of beer and added about a quarter of a cup more than original recipe - GREAT base recipe as stated by another reviewer!!!

Yum!  So easy to make and it tastes great.  We made onion rings and shrimp with this batter.  The shrimp we also dipped in a thai coconut panko (from Whole Foods) and it was to die for!

Great recipe, but I just had to add about 1/2 c more flour to make it stick to the onions more. Also, I added some cayenne pepper to give it a zing! Really nice recipe...and I froze mine, ate them the next day after heating them in an oven and they were great with my hot dog for dinner! Thank you for the recipe.

This made awesome fried onion rings, squash, and okra!  We used carbonate water and added a few spices but basically stuck straight by the recipe.  Definitely a must-have for the recipe box!  Thank you for this one!!!

a "pinch" of just about any spice is lost in a cup or more of all purpose flour. I added some sugar, hot sauce, soy sauce, and garlic powder. Dad tested and Kid approved!

Wow!
These were really good the batter was sweet but in a good way and they came out very delicous though after i dipped them in the batter i rolled them around bread crumbs to add extra cruchiness.
Will try again! Thanks!

This was the first time we ever made onion rings and these were delicious. We used Samuel Adams Boston Lager and it turned out great! Maybe next time some Rogue Dead Guy Ale...

These are seriously the best onion rings I have ever tasted.  I used New Castle Beer and just a pinch of season salt.  It made it that much better.

So good. Although they stuck together they did taste great. The batter is so light and crispy, not greasy at all. I will definately make them again.

Made these last weekend to munch on during the football games, and they were amazing!!  I used seltzer water instead of beer, and added a heaping teaspoon of Creole Seasoning to give them some depth.  I used 4 super-sized onions, so I tripled the batter and flour, and it was just enough.  We like our rings nice and thick, so I made my rings about 3 onion layers thick until I got into the center of the onion where the layers are thicker.  This batter held the layers together perfectly! Served with petal sauce (thousand island dressing & horseradish) for dipping.  YUMMY!! I can't wait to try this batter with zucchini and squash next summer!  Thanks so much for this recipe!  Definately a keeper!

We thought these were pretty good but did need more seasoning.  I let the batter sit for about an hour for the yeast in the beer to 'mingle' with the flour, ended up adding just a little more flour to get the consistency I wanted, then salted them immediately after taking them from the fryer.

These tasted pretty good. I agree with other reviewers, you need to add a lot of extra seasoning. I dipped the rings in flour before coating and the batter did not stick at all.

Super easy, a good recipe to add your own spices to.  I used beer and then the next batch I used carbonated water. The beer batch had a better color.  These are bland, and perfect for my bland, boring boyfriend who is afraid of new things. He loves these. Thanks for the easy recipe.

I don't know what went wrong.  Everyone else loves this recipe, so maybe it was my fault, but the batter didn't stick well. The ones that did turn out tasted like flour, but I followed the recipe exactly, so I don't know.  I may try this again with some changes.

These came out really good, but I also added more salt, more pepper, and Phillip's Seafood Seasoning to the batter. I added more salt when they were done. The batter would be pretty bland if you don't spice it up a bit.

Very good! If you like it a little more spicy then add some more salt, pepper or whatever else you like to use. But they were still wonderful and we will make them again. The whole family couldn't wait until the next batch was done.

I thought these were great.  Possibly the best onion rings I have made so far.  My boyfried said how good they were.  The only change I made was to add some spices similar to cajun seasoning into the beer mixture and sprinkled some on after they were fried.

I've never made onion rings before & this was not too difficult, once I got the hang of things.  I added more salt as has been suggested and a tiny bit of cayenne to spice them up.  Very good taste.  I will be making these again, I think I need more practice!
