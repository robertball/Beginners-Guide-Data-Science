I made these for an office Christmas party and they went over very well. They're unique to look at, easy to put together and quite yummy. I may try the mini-morsels next time, but I will be making them again. Thanks for the posting!

I made some changes: I just made one batch of dough with only the white chocolate chips (not enough time or supplies to do it right) and these turned out great.  The chips were a little gooey fresh out of the oven....very tasty. I also added 3 drops of green food coloring - perfect for the holidays.

A good cookie.  Nothing special but they looked pretty on my Christmas cookie platters.  I sprinkled with powdered sugar, like suggested, and it made them look better.  Also...I added a few drops of green food coloring to the pistacchio section for an added greeen touch.  Very pretty.

I've made these twice.  The first time, I was in a rush, I didn't make two individual balls, I just put all the ingredients in together, a bag of white chocolate chips, and made it into cookies.  The second time, I followed the directions as written.  My boyfriend and I both agreed it was better the first time when I just threw it all in together.  Overall, a good recipe, a nice change from the regular chocolate chip cookie.

I have mixed feelings about these cookies. They seemed dry and not very appealing yet I ate almost the whole batch. I liked the flavor but the texture seemed off.

These cookies were good and the consistency reminded me of a bakery cookie.  My only complaint is that the white chocolate chip on the top almost always seemed to burn.  In the end, I combined all the dough and added some extra white chocolate chips.

These were pretty good cookies.  They had a different flavor, but I liked them.  They were a bit involved, but easy to make. I sent them to a friend for her birthday and she liked them, too.

This was a really good cookie. I took the easy way out. I didn't divide the dough and just made a single flat cookie without the little ball on top. I also omitted the chocolate chips and nuts. Finally, to decorate, I melted and piped vanilla candy melts on top. Also, I baked them on a non-stick insulated cookie sheet. The cookies cooked perfectly and browned very, very lightly on the bottom.
Thanks for sharing!

Update: April1, 2010. I have been making this cookie for 6 years now, and it's my most popular one with everyone I know. I have used different pudding mix flavors and varied the choclate chips and nuts to complement the flavors. Now, I make triple the batch everytime I bake them.

These are FANTASTIC!  I was lazy (shocking, right ;)?) and just mixed the pudding mix and white chocolate chips in with everything and they are AWESOME!  I only made 1/2 a batch to try them and I'm looking forward to making more.  I did not use walnuts per personal preference.  I baked a few as cookies and froze the rest in balls to use in my Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cupcakes and they were awesome w/chocolate cake.  Good stuff; THANKS for a nice, slightly off the beaten path, chocolate chip cookie recipe.

These were just OK.  The flavor seemed kind of bland, and the pistachio pudding added such a tiny hint of green color that it just made them look odd.  The 3x sugar others suggested on top might have helped the appearance.

If you are looking at both recipes for Pistachio Choc Cookie save yourself the time! I read them side by side to see which one I wanted to try, and realized this one (by Marlene)is the EXACT same as the one posted first (by Lisa).  Other than a 1/4 tsp difference in the amount of salt, and the addition of white choc chips they are identical.  This shouldn't one really be a separate recipe, it should be a review of the original with a mention of the very slight change.  Other than that, I love these cookies.  Since they are a bit light in color they are a nice contrast to other traditional xmas cookies.  I'll also try them on St. Patrick's Day or for a church bake sale.

I haven't decided yet whether these cookies are just good or exceptional.  I made half the batch (carefully measured half a pudding packet) and the pistachio flavor was not very distinct - I think I should have used the whole packet for half a batch.

I mixed everything together with these changes- I used 3/4 teaspoon vanilla bean paste and a couple of drops of pistachio extract. The extract I have says to use 1/4 of the amount called for in the recipe. I chopped a mix of pistachios, walnuts, and cashews, approx. 1/3 cup, and added it to the mix.  Like others, I added 1 cup of mini chocolate chips. I used a #40 scoop and pressed the cookies with a glass and sparkling white sugar. Because I used a silpat sheet in the pan, I baked these for around 12 minutes. My yield was 3 1/2 - 4 dozen cookies.

The cookie wasn't bad but the chocolate and nuts just didn't go well together. Maybe it would have been better to use white chocolate instead.

I love all things pistachio and these were a huge disappointment. I made some changes, so I can't really rate the recipe badly, but I had hoped that the pistachio flavor would have been more pronounced! Like others, I omitted the regular chocolate chips and added only white chocolate, omitting the extra ball on top. I'm glad I did! I don't think I would have liked these at all with semi-sweet chips. Basically they taste like glorified sugar cookies. Next time, If there will be one, I'll add some almond extract and maybe two packages of pudding mix to give these cookies the extra edge they need!

Not bad.  I didn't separate the dough either and just made a batch of cookies without the nuts and chocolate chips.  I put in a cup of white chocolate chips instead and thought the dough was a tad dry; the cookies seemed somewhat dry to me as well, so next time I might increase the milk a bit--maybe to a 1/4 cup--to see if that helps.  I do taste the pistachio and thought they had some nice flavor.  They are only slightly tinged green, which makes sense.  :)  All in all, decent cookies that don't spread much.  I used a medium cookie scoop and it yielded almost 4 dozen.  thanks for the recipe!
