This is good. Comfort food. My grandmother used to always make us supper from a campbells soup recipe (usually found on the back of the can's wrapper). Thx for posting this as I have so many cans of soup in my cupboard that it gives me new ideas as to what I can do with some of them for quick week-night dinners.

This was easy and flavorful.My husband loved it. We like alot of flavor so I did use chicken broth instead of water. The left over broth I used in with the water to cook the rice. I also added a 4 oz. can of drained sliced mushrooms and 1 sm. onion,cut in 1/2 inch pieces in the skillet with garlic. Also added more sage and thyme to the soup mixture. Served it with rice and green beans.

This was a very easy even though it was a touch bland.  We enjoyed it and it is a good Weight Watchers choice.  I will definitely make it again but will probably add a few spices to either the chicken or the sauce just to make it a little more interesting.

This recipe is great and easy. I sauteed mushrooms to add to the sauce, used chicken broth instead of chicken and served over wild rice. Big hit!

I found this recipe to be very blah--nothing to get excited about for me, though did like the twist of adding the fresh parsley to the rice and will do that again with a different chicken entree.

I didn't really like this. It was pretty bland and the chicken burnt even though I followed the directions. So it was pretty gross. Next time I'll cut the chicken into smaller pieces and maybe some more spices to the sauce but as is, I give it 2 stars
