I grew up knowing this is the recipe as "Aunt Nancy's Ice Cream Cake," the Aunt Nancy being my great aunt from Missouri.  This is one of the first desserts I learned to make as a girl and is still a great option in summer.  It is best made a day ahead.  And make sure you get the toasted mixture nice and crunchy (but it burns fast!).

Wow, yum! I used butter pecan ice cream and it was AWESOME. Caramel sauce would've really topped it off, but it was sweet enough as is. I will be making this again, thanks!

This is delicious even if you are not a fan of coconut.  I used the nondiary Soy Delicious instead of ice cream and no one noticed the difference.

Everyone in the family loved this, I drizzled a little caramel ice cream topping on it, and it was really good.

Very good, and easy to make. I didn't need to toast the cereal mixture for 30 minutes, it was dark and crispy at about 22 minutes (maybe it's my oven, but just keep an eye on it). This would be good with hot fudge sauce on top too. Thanks!

I usually make a cake or cookies for dessert and thought I'd try something different.  Never had tried anything with ice cream before.  My husband loved it!  Said it's the best dessert I've made yet.  I made it just as the recipe said and served it with chocolate syrup.  A+

Thank You for submitting this recipe!  I had this recipe a couple of years ago and had made it several times  for  family parties.  Everyone loved it , even though many weren/t too fond of coconut.  I misplaced it and was wonderfully suprised to find it here! Thank you

This is one of our favorite desserts -- it's especially great as a dessert with Asian food. The coconut crunch is so good you want to eat it by the handful. Love it!

Yummy!  This is a very easy, kid friendly recipe.  The whole family loved it(big kids and little).  Goes along way, this could feed up to 8 people.
