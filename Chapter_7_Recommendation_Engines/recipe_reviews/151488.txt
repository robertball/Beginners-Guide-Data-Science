Bizarre ingredients, INCREDIBLE flavor!  I’m usually not afraid to take risks with my food, and I’m so glad I tried this.  I’d never made brisket before, but this was super easy and the flavor was outstanding.  I couldn’t find frozen pearl onions or fresh tarragon when I went shopping.  I substituted with jarred pearl onions (15 oz., drained) and a tsp of dried tarragon.  All other ingredients were used as stated in the recipe.    The brisket was so yummy straight from the oven without the mushrooms and onions; I didn’t even bother putting them over the meat.  I just served them as a side. (They were also delicious by themselves).  I will certainly make this again and might even double the sauce amount.  My fiancé and I couldn’t get enough!

The ingredients are unusual, but the brisket comes out GREAT! I used my crock pot, and omitted the pearl onions and tarragon, and it was awesome. The sauce is like a bbq sauce but it has more depth. I served the brisket over garlic mash potatoes. I will totally make this again. And I am passing it on to my friends.

This was excellent.  Ridiculous ingredients, but super easy and very tasty.  I chopped the fresh tarragon, but forgot to add it at the end, and it was not missed.  I tried a bite with a sprinkle of tarragon, and it was good, but not necessary.  I did bake the brisket longer and at a lower temperature as called for in other brisket recipes I have tried (specifically, 300 degrees for 4 hours).

I have tried several brisket recipes and none have really been "a keeper", as my husband says.  But I just made this for dinner and my husband is just raving about it!  He keeps going back to the dish and sneaking bites!  Two things I didn't use:  pearl onions (he doesn't like onions like that) and tarragon.  I wasn't familiar with tarragon, so I bought some for this dish, but after I chopped it up, I didn't like the smell and neither did my husband, so I left it out.  It smells like black licorice to us.  I'm on a very strict diet, so I couldn't have any, but again, my husband LOVED it.

This is the first brisket I've made and I got so many compliments on it.  I cooked it in the oven on Christmas Eve for 3 hours.  On Christmas morning, I sliced it up and added the mushroom and onion mixture and reheated in the crockpot.  It was yummy!

My 26 year-old son made this last night for Passover (okay, I'm sure not everything was allowable), but it was by far the BEST brisket I've ever had! He did cook it at a lower temp for longer as instructed by me.  He used fresh pearl onions which he cut in half before he sauteed the mixture and they came apart a bit more as they cooked so that they were just the perfect amount of soft.  Like many others, he too forgot to add the tarragon (made no difference!).  This made lots of gravy and he put carrots and potatoes in for the last 2 hours or a little longer since the oven was low.  EVERYONE loved this!

I have never made Beef Brisket, this was the first recipe I have tried.  I thought it turned out good.  I could only find a 2 pound Brisket so I cut the recipe in half.  I'm glad I did because it made quite a bit of food!  I could not find Pearl Onions, so I used thickly sliced white onions.  I did not care for the Tarragon, next time this will be left out.  Also when making this, make sure the foil is folded tightly.  A lot of my juice and sauce ran out due to the foil being loose.

This recipe was absolutely outrageous. My husband was hesitant to try it at first but loved the end result.  A must try dish

Barely followed the recipe except for the basic tastemakers here (jelly + onion soup mix), wasn't afraid of this recipe because my mother has a meatball recipe very similar that is the best thing you ever put in your mouth. It was better than I could have expected, thank you for posting this smuckers!

I put all the ingredients for the meat and sauce in the crockpot on low for 8 hours and it came nice and tender.  As previous reviewers' suggested, I served the sauteed mushrooms and onions as a side dish.

Super easy to make and tastes so good! Very tender meat, as if slow roasted for long time instead of just 3 hours. It's a requested item in this household!

I've made this with brisket and london broil, and I'm going to try it with chuck roast. It's so easy and delicious! Seriously everyone I've served it to loved it. It's wonderful for bbq sandwiches, which my daughter specifically requested for July 4! With the chuck roast I may end up shredding the beef instead of slicing it - we'll see how the consistency turns out.

So good! I, too, didn't use the taragon or pearl onions. Threw the brisket in the oven with the sauce and foiled it up and ran some errands. Came home to the best smell. Brisket was so tender and the sauce is great. It was even better as leftovers when I reduced the sauce and poured it over the mashed potatoes. Yum. My favorite part is telling people what is in it! So weird! I'm trying it now on country pork ribs.

I admit that the recipe seemed quite strange, but I read the reviews and decided to try it anyway. All I can say is YUMMY!!  Easy to make and absolutely delicious.  My family loved it.  They are asking when I am going to make it again.  I did make a few changes/omissions: I do not like tarragon, so I did not add...and instead of pearl onions I just used regular yellow onions (2 of them).  I also added about 10 ounces of portobellos because I love mushrooms.  AWESOME.

I just made this fabulous brisket for our Christmas  dinner.  Doubled the recipe (for 10 adults and 2 kids) and there was almost no beef left afterwards!  Everyone raved about the wonderful flavor AND as I cooked it the day before (in an oven bag), then cooled & sliced it , and refrigerated the sauce, it was VERY easy that day.  I just sauteed the mushrooms and onions together on Christmas morning.  Then removed and discarded the fat from the top of the refrigerated sauce and added most of it to the mushroom mixture and poured the rest of it over the brisket in a huge skillet to warm on the stove, as my ovens were full.  It held well.  I served the mushroom and onion sauce on the side next to the beef on the buffet table. Will definitely make this again soon.  It was SO yummy!

This brisket is so great!  I cooked it in an oven bag at 300F for four hours. Throw some potatoes in with the onions. Weird ingredients, but super results.

Family loved the recipe. The only snag was my very sweet & overzealous butcher did a fantastic job of trimming the fat from my brisket. So my suggestion is if you have very little fat on your brisket cut the cooking time by a half hour (the fat keeps the meet moist).
