Loved this! The store didn't have any cocktail rye, so I just used regular rye bread cut in half, which worked great. Awesome combo of flavors...everyone enjoyed these, which makes them a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were very easy to make and a bit hit at our party!  I made the mix the night before, assembled the bread with the mix on a tray and put in the fridge for a few hours - just threw them in the oven when the party started!  Voila!  I did add some chopped pepperoni and green pepper to the mix, per another recipe I had, so in essence, these were little pizza bites!  I also skipped buttering the bread slices as it seemed unnecessary and it wasn't missed at all!
