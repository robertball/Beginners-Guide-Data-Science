This dip is *so* fresh and wonderful, the perfect complement to summer veggies or buttery crackers. I added some dill and celery salt but the grated cucumber is the real star of this show. [Don't forget to seed the cuke!] Even with light mayo and Neufchatel it was creamy and the consistency didn't suffer at all.

I doubled the cucumber because I have so many in my garden, and loved this with wheat thins or in a wrap with ham and tomatoes.

This was really nice. I used only half an onion and seeded the cucumber before chopping. I also added about 2 tbsp. of hot sauce. I'm not sure I would've liked it with chips, but it would be great with a veggie platter or some nice crackers. I used this in an appetizer - baked and cooled wonton wrappers in muffin tins, spooned in a small amount of the dip and topped it with shredded garlic chicken.

I loved this recipe.  I needed something to bring to a social gathering and it was gone after just a bit.  I did omit the onion because I did not have any but added onion powder which worked nicely.  I also added dill.  Very Tasty.  Also made it with low fat cream cheese and light mayo so it would be too bad for you.  This is a keeper.

This was awesome.  I also added about a tablespoon or so of sour cream for a little added flavor along with fresh dill.  Let this sit for a few hours at least before serving.  I tasted it before I chilled it and a few hours after and it made a big difference.  I think it gave the cucumbers and onions time to flavor the dip a bit more.  I will definitely make this again at the next party.  I served it with vegetable crackers, veggies and chips.

Absolutely awesome dip!  I added 1 T sour cream and 1/4 tsp dill weed for added flavor and omitted the garlic salt replacing it with 1/2 tsp each garlic powder and salt.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

First off, this recipe is delicious. I brought it to a cook out and everyone agreed how refreshing it is! I served it in a hollowed out bread bowl, cut the part of the bread i hollowed out into small squares and toasted them in the oven with virgin olive oil! Delicious!

Nice summer dip-I used less onion, added dill, subbed Neufchatel for cream cheese and plain greek yogurt for the mayo.

This was delicious! It went great with sliced cucumbers and baby carrots. I used fat free cream cheese, light mayonnaise, and I left the onion out. Cant wait to make this again!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I made a 1/2 recipe to try this out. I have a lot of cucumbers growing in my garden and am trying a variety of recipes. I liked everything about it except I thought the onion was kind of strong. I added a little extra cucumber and even cut back the onion some to begin with. I think an extra seasoning would be good to, but I wasn't sure what. It was a tad thick, in my opinion, but it did go well though with pretzels.

Make sure your cucumbers are seeded for this recipe.  I added fresh dill and celery salt because it needed a little more pizazz.  With the additions, it was very good.

I brought this to our Derby party 2009 & got rave reviews! I drained the cucumbers and rinsed them. I also misread the directions & added a tbs of garlic salt instead of just a tsp. No one complained though. I also added some dill weed, celery salt, and a little sour cream. This recipe is easily altered to taste (various herbs & spices). I actually called it Benedictine since that's a traditional Derby dish. Its very similar. Loved it with veggies as well as with Lime Tostitos!

Really yummy; we served this in a hollowed out red cabbage with pita triangles, and some wedges from the red cabbage itself. Ours seemed to have a bit of an issue with blending properly, but still tasted great anyways.

This is unbelievable!!    It's so simple and so tasty.  I served it with toastitos and triscuits.  Make sure to let it sit as long as possible as it's better the longer it sits.  Make it this night before just to make sure it has enough time in the fridge.  Also, I periodically placed it back in the fridge from time to time just to keep it cold.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I'll be making this again and again and again!

Just some comments for a good end result.  I read the comments about squeezing out excess water from cucumbers and thought..yes...splendid idea, as for it could be a runny mess.  So I did this, and regardless- its a pretty chunky unappetizing looking end product. Looked like cottage cheese- I put it in the food processor, which extremely helped the dip look more appetizing and smooth, but it was pretty stiff, and I knew once it went back in the fridge it would be too hard to dip a cracker in.  So I started adding some more cucumber without (de-juicing) it to unharden the dip more.  So I would recommend a food processor and kind of adding undrained cucumber as you go, until you get the right texture.  Also, these kinds of dips MUST sit in the fridge at least 12 or more hours to bring out the flavors.  It will taste totally different from when you first make it, so make it at least 1-2 days in advance for the correct flavor.

Very nice dip.  I think it's more of a spread as written, but I didn't hear any complaints from anyone when I served it at a bbq yesterday.  My friend loved it and asked me about the recipe, so I emailed it to her today.  I added a bit of dill weed and used salt plus garlic powder (no garlic salt).  Turned out well.  Thanks for the recipe!

We had so many cucumbers growing in the garden that we didn't know what to do with them.  I made this dip with 8 oz. cream cheese, 2 TABL mayo, and 2 TABL sourcream.  I used a large cuke and half an onion.  It was the perfect solution.

Such a quick, easy and tasty app!  I only lack Garlic Salt.  I used fresh minced Garlic instead with a bit of salt.  I dig the full flavor Real Cream Cheese and am not counting calories.  I recommend Carr's Stoned Wheat Crackers (bisquits?) with this and any other dip.

This dip was first given to me by a friend. I  make it frequently especially during the warmer months.  It is so refreshing and light; especially when using home grown cucumbers.

It's perfect for a summer or fall cookout! light and tasty! serve with crackers of any kind or chips and it's a hit. So easy to make! I add fresh minced garlic and less garlic salt and it always gets compliments. Similar in taste to Thaziki Sauce that tops a gyro.

Fantastic dip!  Everyone loved it. Perfect for the summer bbq gathering.  I used 3/4 tsp garlic powder and several shakes of sea salt in place of garlic salt.  Seed the cucumber and finely dice the cucumber and onion.

I did omit the onion and added a packet of "Hidden Valley" zesty Italian seasoning to the cream cheese mixture. This is great not only as a dip, as I use it on wraps, bagels and sandwiches.

Insanely simple and very good.

I didn't feel like onions, and substituted bacon crumbles and it was great with thick cucumber slices.

A perfect light lunch for carb counters!

I really enjoyed this dip!  I liked it so much, i took it to work to share with veggies, everyone loved it!  I will definately make this again.  It's so light, and refreshing!
