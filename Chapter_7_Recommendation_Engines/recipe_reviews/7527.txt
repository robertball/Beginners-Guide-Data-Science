I just made this cake and it is absolutely delicious. I do not own a bundt pan so I used a 9x13 pan and baked it until done using the toothpick method. I also sprinkled sugar in the cake pan after spraying it with Pam. Came out perfectly. Will defintly be making this recipe again.

I've made this recipe at least 10 times for my family, and they absolutely love me for it.  It is by far the best and easiest dessert recipe in existence.  I recently found a way to enjoy the same great taste in a lower calorie version of the recipe because some of my friends are health nutters and would not try any baked goods of mine unless they were sugar free and or fat free.

I used the same yellow cake mix (but you could substitute a whole wheat/low carb version if available.  Instead of 1 big box of instant chocolate pudding mix I bought two smaller sugar free/fat free boxes of the same instant chocolate pudding mix.  I used 4 egg beaters servings (1 cup egg beaters) instead of eggs.  I substituted 2/3 c unsweetened applesauce instead of using oil, and 2/3 cup splenda (not the splenda with sugar) instead of the additional sugar, and 1 8 oz container of fat free sour cream.  I did not use chocolate chips because I could not find a sugar free version.  I baked it for only 20 minutes (because it was going to burn after that for some reason) but keep checking by sticking a toothpick every few minutes to make sure its not burning.  You definitely don't need the whole 55 minutes with this altered recipe.  The grand total for caloric content was 220 calories per serving (1/12 of cake) as opposed to the whopping 500+ as noted in this recipe.

I don't know what went wrong, but my cake created a tunnel all the way around. I followed the recipe to the letter except vanilla instead of chocolate pudding, which shouldn't have made a difference. The oven was preheated to the right temperature, and I know it's accurate, because I bake all the time. If anyone has a suggestion I would sure like to hear it.

I have been wanting to try this cake for a while, and now that I am munching a slice still warm...I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! This is SO MUCH BETTER than your average box cake, I used dark chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips, and it is outrageously good! One tip, have a good hand mixer, cause the batter can be pretty thick. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Wow, what a terrific recipe for a bundt cake.  You can use any flavor box cake mix for this recipe.  I used cherry chip and lined the bundt pan with maraschino cherries.  It came out moist and looked beautiful.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will use over and over again.

What a great cake!  Super easy and VERY moist.  Have made it twice within one week.  First time I made it with vanilla pudding instead of chocolate. (it's what I had on hand)  Very delicious!  Second time I used banana pudding and white chocolate chips.  Everyone devoured it!  Also used fat free sour cream and still bakes wonderfully.  Only problem I had was it tends to stick to the cake pan, so I make sure I spray the pan really well.  Thank you for a tasty and easy recipe!

Makes a very heavy, dense cake.  Batter is very thick.  No frosting is necessary - it's great as is!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used vanilla pudding in place of the chocolate and replaced sherry (not cooking sherry) for the water. I left out the chips (really not a chocolate fan) and it was great! I have also used this recipe to make jewish apple cake - and what I did was I used peeled chopped apples, (not pie filling) in place of the chips and used butter cake mix instead of chocolate! It's great too!

Thanks for the recipe - I did a chocolate-mixed berry with chocolate raspberry-drizzle. Sent it to the station with my husband at 8am - he call at 10:30am to tell me it was 3/4 gone (I meant it as dessert, but I guess it works for breakfast,too).

I was so suprisingly happy with this recipe!  I couldn't tell that it was a "box" cake! I only used a small box of pudding - the 3oz. size but I don't think it mattered because the cake was moist and delicious and chocolately.  A couple of things:  1) The instructions didn't mention an electric mixer, so I just used a whisk and stired it in a bowl - worked out fine and saved me some clean up!  2) Prep time says 25 mins but it only took me about 15 mins to prepare, so that's another extra bonus with this recipe.  I got a new oven recently and I used a tube pan so my cooking time was increased to 65 minutes.  I kept checking it with a toothpick during the last 20 mins just in case. Thanks Meredith.

OK...made the chocolate version 2 days ago.....GONE!!! Now, as we speak, I have a butterpecan version, with vanilla pudding in the oven.  The cake is great...easy, so moist, and you can change it to suit your flavor mood.  I took it down to lunch at my parents house yesterday.....they loveeeeeed it!!!  Will be making this often.  I am thinking pistachio with white chololate next.........

Thanks to this recipe, I am the official "Dump Cake" maker for all family get-togethers!!  This recipe is sooooo easy!!  I've made it 6 different times, with different cake/pudding combos, and it is awesome every time!  The only change I make is that I don't add the sugar, but I do melt frosting and glaze the top.

This has been my go to cake recipe for two years but have been too lazy to write a review for it!  You can try all combinations for cake mix/pudding and chips too.  My family likes chocolate mix, chocolate pudding and peanut butter chips!  Make sure you REALLY grease your bundt pan well because too often you will have to "glue" it back together again.  Although, in my family it doesn't make it that long!

I had to review this one.  I kind of giggled to myself when one of the reviewers said she made this cake two or three times in a week.  Well, I've made it 4 times since last Tuesday.  I made the original recipe for a birthday the following day.  Afraid it wouldn't be enough, the night of the party I made a second with strawberry cake, banana pudding and butterscotch chips.  Both cakes were loved by everyone (the hot out of the oven was awesome.  Two days later I made a spice cake, pistachio pudding and butterschotch chips.  OMG. It was gone within minutes at the function I went to.  Even my 10 year old, who is very picky said, "Good job on the spice cake, Mom.  It's soooo good."  Another spice cake just came out of the oven and is cooling right now.  My husband and I didn't get enough of it considering it was for an event. Thank you for this amazing recipe!!  (I have to cook mine about 2-3 minutes longer)

I was leery when my 10 year old asked to make my birthday cake, but I thought if I can find an easy but yummy sounding recipe it might work.  Well, it sure did.  It came out delicious and did not require too many dishes so I even got a clean kitchen out of the deal.  This one is a keeper. Thanks

This was excellent!  I didn't have a bundt pan so I used a 9x13 pan and baked it for the same amount of time.  I also didn't have enough chocolate chips so I added a few peanut butter chips.  It turned out great!  We put Cool Whip on top and it was superb!  Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe--I will be using it a lot!!!

This was a great cake.  But I did change it up a bit.  I had a can of cherry pie filling that I wanted to use.  So I cut out the oil and the water and added the pie filling, I also used ff sour cream.  It was moist and fudgy and Oh so good and probably a bit lower in fat.  Thanks for the great quick easy recipe Meredith.

I love this cake!  I've made it 3 times so far- once with small kids.  Yummy! *Update* I've been making this cake for over 5 years now. I've tried different variations, but the original is best! This is a must-have recipe for a quick cake! I've taken it to neighbors houses, used it for birthdays- everytime people want the recipe! They're shocked when I give it to them!

This was a HUGE hit last night at a party. Made it exactly as directed.I sifted some powdered sugar over the top to pretty it up a bit.
I was actually trying to find a recipe that a friend gave me years ago and looked here for something with similar ingredients.  Found this one and with a little tweaking was able to reconstruct an old favorite.  Big bonus...I was able to bake two fabulous cakes last night that were the talk of the party!  To make the other cake I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, exchanged the chocolate pudding for vanilla, exchanged the choc. chips for toffee bits, (the kind that also has chocolate like a Heath or Skor bar) and put in half the batter then half the toffee bits then the rest of the batter and ended with the toffee bits.  YUMMMMM I will warn you to remove the cake about 5 minutes after removing it from the oven.  The candy will stick to the sides so you may have to remove portions from the pan.  A sprinkling of the powdered sugar helps to disguise any "cutting and pasting"  Thank you so much for posting this recipe you helped me to revive a much loved cake!

This is a fabulously moist cake, it doesn't need frosting, just a light dusting of powdered sugar if you are looking for optimum presentation. One thing I would really recommend is using mini chocolate chips, as the regular ones tend to sink to the bottom of the cake. My ladies group wouldn't believe that I baked this cake, they said it had to be bakery. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful cake ... BEWARE though ... be sure to REALLY REALLY REALLY grease your pan ... My cake would not budge from the bundt cake pan.  There is no need for frosting.  This cake is perfect alone.

I did not have a bundt pan - made it in a 9x13 - added a bit more water.  used lemon pudding (what I had) and white chocolate chips (what I had) and added pecans.  Our company loved it!  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Meredith!!!

Delicious, wonderful cake!  Hubby said to definitely put it in my regular rotation.  It's so moist, yet has a bit of a crusty outside.  I had to cook it a bit longer then the stated time, but other than that I made no changes.  Next time I'll add some nuts, I just didn't have any when I made it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

You don't know what delicious chocolate cake is till you try this.  My husband took the leftovers into work where he has an all girl staff!   They raved about it - so moist - you don't need icing!

My family loved this cake.  It was moist and very yummy.  The only thing I did differently (by accident) was that I used a 3.9 oz box of chocolate pudding instead of a 5.9 oz box as written in the recipe.  They loved it and requested that I make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

4.5 Stars!  And this recipe makes a large amount of cake!  I also did cut down the oil to about 1/3c, and instead of water, I used concentrated coffee.  Also, I ran out of sour cream, so I subbed non-fat yogurt for the remainder.  Dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  I was also unable to immediately put the cake in the oven.  It sat in the fridge for 4hrs, but still turned out great.  This must be one of those recipes where you can't mess it up.  Though some reviewers said that it didn't need frosting, I added a light layer of cool whip on top, and felt that I could've probably make it thicker.

I made this for the first time to take on a trip....Feel like I wasted alot of ingredients as I threw it away.  My cake never seemed to bake all the way through and the outside seemed to get tough and dried out.  The inside was still mushy. Maybe I will try again but was disappointed after my first try.

One of the best cakes I've ever made!  Great flavor, VERY moist, great texture.  I used vanilla pudding mix instead of chocolate.  I made 2 smaller layers and frosted it with chocolate frosting.  Frankly, the cake was so good, it didn't even need the frosting.  I would like to make this cake again, but next time, I would make it EXACTLY as written in the recipe.

I have mixed emotions on this cake.  After all the reviews I was expecting a 5 star cake, it was good, but just good for me.  I will try again, but may add pecans and glaze.  I will defintely try one readers suggestion of chocolate cake, vanilla pudding and peanut butter chips.  It did come out of bundt pan beautfully and my husband liked it, so I wish I could give it 4.5 stars.

my family now calls this "my famous chocolate cake". I have probably made it 20 times since getting it from allrecipes. Every single person who tastes it loves it!!! I have given the recipe away many times. I use store bought chocolate icing in the tub. Make sure to beat the 4 eggs and grease your bundt pan well. You won't be able to eat just one piece! Don't alter the recipe. Make it just like it says.:)

I enjoyed this recipe. I used chocolate cake mix instead of yellow. It was sweet, dense and moist and needed no icing. My kids really enjoyed it. I didn't use the chocolate chips, but I think I will next time :)

This cake was excellent!  And soooo easy to make.  The only change I made to the recipe was substituting peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips.  It was a big hit at our Easter dinner.

I'm not a good baker (not even a tolerable one), but this recipe was awesome!  My hubby was bugging me for a sheet cake, and I made this with devil's food cake mix & chocolate pudding in a 9x13 pan.  Moist as heck, and absolutely the best thing I've ever baked - that's not saying much, but I REALLY appreciate the recipe; it's awesome!!!

I am not a big fan of cake.  But this cake was pheonominal.  Very moist and the blend of everything was just perfect.  Great recipe.  I am looking forward to trying different variations. I did do a basic powdered sugar icing and drizzled it over the top.  Great blend with the cake.  Yum

This cake was delicious.  If I could I would give it 10 stars.  I made it for a family gathering and it was gone by the end of the day.  So I made another the next day because they wanted more.

Great cake. I usually don't change recipes but I was out of a few items and didn't realize it until I had begun making the cake.  So just for the record, you can use mayo for sour cream.  I only had 1/2 cup of sour cream so I added 1/2 cup of mayonaisse to take the place.  I also only had 2 eggs so that is the amount I used. Finally, I had one pack of sugar free chocolate pudding and used it insead of the larger regular pack.  I added a cream cheese icing by softening the cream cheese in the microwave and mixing it with powdered sugar and a little vanilla.  The cake was so good, I am afraid to make it again using the ingredients called for.  My mom said it couldn't get any better.

I LOVED this cake. Everyone I made try it loved it. I made a couple of modifications. I only used one small box of chocolate pudding (because thats all I had) and I only used 1/3 a cup of sugar (next time I dont think I will that sugar are all since this cake is pretty sweet.) I made it on a Thursday and it was still very moist on Monday. Even someone who doesnt like chocolate cake, said this cake was great! I didnt frost it, this cake can completely stand alone.

This is really yummy--rich, but not too rich and it has a really nice texture. 

I used mini chocolate chips instead of regular size ones the second time I made it and it was even better than the first time. Everyone preferred the tiny chips the way they really infiltrated every bite. I also microwaved canned frosting and poured it over as a glaze with a little powdered sugar for looks. It was yummy!

No matter how I've made this (flavour combinations) I haven't gone wrong.  I get lots of compliments for this cake, and while I'm not a big keener on it, everyone in my life who eats it just loves it.  I'm a pretty picky cake eater, though.

Very yummy and moist!! Easy recipe and one in which you can use variety and not mess it up. I use vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips and everyone just loved it. I think I'll try strawberry cake, vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips next time.

Not out of this world, but good for a quick sweet fix, especially considering the ease and number of ingredients.  Try coating the greased pan with granulated sugar instead of flour for a prettier presentation.

My husband really liked this cake as did the kids. This one's a "Keeper" Really moist and full of flavor, especially for chocolate lovers. I'll have to try this recipe using strawberry cake mix and vanilla pudding.

This was excellent!  I was a little nervous because I usually don't like recipes that use the pudding/box cake mixes, but maybe the addition of sour cream and eggs make a difference.  In my opinion, it tastes very close to a "made from scratch" cake.  I added a mixture of semi-sweet and peanut butter chips, sprinkled it with powdered sugar and it was delicious.

I don't really  care much about chocolate mix cake. But after reading some of the reviews I thought that I would try it.Iwas very much impressed and pleased with the results and taste. I went by the recipe this time, but will try others ways of the reviews. My wife really loved it. Definitely a keeper for me.

I thought this was just okay.  Maybe it was just all the "build-up" from all the great reviews, but for all of the extra ingredients added, it just wasn't any better than just plain-old cake mix.  The only thing I did differently was I used vanilla pudding and I baked it in 2 nine inch round pans.  Don't get me wrong; it wasn't bad.  It just wasn't worth all the extra "stuff", especially the chocolate chips (they overpowered the cake).

This cake is so good.  I make it constantly and every time people rave about how great it is.  I am never disappointed with this cake.  I've given the recipe to many people and it instantly becomes the cake they always make.  The only thing I do differently is use 2 cups of chocolate chunks rather then 1 cup of chocolate chips.  This cake is definitely a winner.

5 stars are not enough! Moist & delicious! I used pineapple cake mix, vanilla pudding & of course, omitted the chocolate chips. Wonderful! Have fun with this by varying the cake mix & pudding flavors!

What a wonderful recipe!!!  I used vanilla pudding instead of chocolate, 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 1 cup, and I baked mine in a 13x9 pan just because I don't have a bunt pan.  This was very moist and the taste was W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L!!!!  My husband thought it needed icing, so I melted tub of milk chocolate icing in the microwave for 45 seconds and poured it over the top.  Yum - Yum - Yum !!!!

I agree that this does need some kind of glaze but it is pretty good on its own.  The chocolate chips are great inside.  I would back off 5 minutes on the cooking time next time because the outside was a little over done.  It was very moist inside though and very easy.

Made it with devil's food cake mix, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup peanut butter chips.  Very good, very moist.  Baked in a 9x13 pan; it turned out just fine.  Next time I'll switch to 1 cup of peanut butter chips and no chocolate chips... couldn't taste the peanut butter with all that chocolate.  :)

I . . . LOVE this!! Seriously, this is SUCH a delicious and moist cake. I DO have to bake it about 10 minutes longer in my oven, not sure why. But, I grease and SUGAR the pan, and it gives it a nice, crunch to it. I just fed this to the missionaries the other night, and they both loved it, and commented on it, as did my family. This will now be a part of our recipe collection. Thank you, Meredith!! ;)

I've made this twice now and it is, in a word, awesome! Well ok more words - versatile, moist, delicious, easy. First time I made it exactly as the recipe stated. Super chocolaty, nice texture and needless to say it didn't last long around here. Next time I used what I had on hand - yellow cake mix, one small box of banana pudding & one small box of vanilla pudding mix, and peanut butter chips. It's great. We call it the Elvis version of dump cake ha ha. Thanks for a great recipe!

So easy and yummy. Made it with chocolate fudge cake mix, chocolate pudding mix and chocolate chips. It stuck in the pan in a couple of spots so will grease it better next time.  The cake mix was a bit bigger than the ounces called for so the cake needed to cook an extra five min.  For guests  and/or a more finished look, I will put a glaze of some kind on it, but taste-wise, it needs nothing on top!  Anxious to try it again with other flavors.  Neither gooey nor dry, it was "just right!"  Update - made this again and greased and sugared the pan with white sugar.  Came out of the pan like a charm!

This cake was absolutel one of the best cakes I've ever eaten! I didn't add the chocolate chips but made no other altercations except I used a white cake mix instead of yellow and added 1/4 cup of coca powder.  It was gone in 2 days A definate keeper.  We esp. liked the wonderful crust on it!

This was absolutely delicious...a mild rich chocolate flavor with little chocolate chip surprises.  A very moist cake...  It doesn't need frosting, but I'm sure a scoop of ice cream with it will be excellent.

very easy recipe, can whip it up in a snap! I used slightly less oil (I ran out) and it didn't seem to affect the test. Based on previous reviews, I also used less sugar, 1/3 cup. It was still sweet enough.

Yummy!  I used Devil's Food cake mix and light sour cream.  Also made sure to use mini chocolate chips.  The edges seemed to get done quickly, so I kept an eye on it and turned the oven back to 325 for a couple of 10 minute time periods.  Covered this cake with the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze found on this site, and it was extremely well-received!!!  Delicious ~ thanks for sharing!  :)

Simply the best!  Used plain yogurt instead of sour cream but there was no tangy yogurt taste so that worked out well.  The flavors here would be easy to change with different puddings, chips and yogurt flavors for a lot of diversity.  I melted a jar of carmel frosting over the top.  Delicious!

My family has a similar recipe to this to make chocolate chip bundt cake. Last night I made this recipe, but added flax and fiber to the cake mix, and then topped it by just sprinkling a thick layer of ground up pecans on top followed by cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves. The nutty topping is delicious with the flavor of the cake, which I think is a little more rich and good than my mom's old recipe. Yum!

this is a terrific cake make sure you fold in the sour creme and morsels for it to turn out right. It was perfect every other way, we all just loved it.

This is the hit of every party we take it to!!!! Do nothing to the recipe and you will have the perfect cake (unless you don't like moist chocolate cake) this is a winner in our house every time it is made!!!

It was the first time I've made bundt cake and it turned out pretty good. The only complaint I had was that it was too moist for me.. almost fell apart. Otherwise very good taste. Thanks

This was a surprise.  I had a craving for a cake after work last night - but I only have 1.5 hrs to spend.  So I browsed allrecipes quickly to find easy cake to make - and found this! I only had half of the sour cream tub, so I used vanilla yoghurt for the other half.  I dumped everything in the same mixer, and mixed them all together - that easy.  I also put peanut butter chips and almond slivers in them.  My friend said this is the best cake she's ever eaten! So moist, delicious, and the easiest of all.

This was a fabulous dessert. I followed recommendations to add the pudding already mixed, but it was a little too moist. Follow the recipe and you will be pleased.  I'm excited to try other cake/pudding combinations.

The recipe is good.  I made it for my god-daughter's birthday.  I served it warmed.  Everybody loved it.  I did sprinkle the bottom of the pan with chopped walnuts.  The only reason I didn't the recipe 4 stars was because mixing was not all that easy.  The mix is very thick...and hard to stir.  But good.  I have made it 2 times since then using chocolate cake mix.  Great!

This was okay. Tasted like boxed cake to me..my kids liked it okay. I prefer the homemade taste, this cake did taste like boxed or bakery type cake.  I wont make this again unless I want a quick cake in a hurry.

5 stars because the recipe was soooo easy.  I will try it next time with a different mix of flavors- maybe strawberry cake and vanilla pudding.  I thought the choc. chips would melt and they didn't - so beware- I used mini and people thought they were raisins which may be a turn off.  I'll use regular or even chunks next time.  I still can't figure out why you have to "fold" the sour cream in- I didn't get a very even batter because of this- if anyone knows please email me!  hesantone@msn.com.  THANKS!!!

EXCELLENT!  I made it for a Christmas Eve dinner party and everyone raved.  Even my husband, who is not a dessert eater!  The only problem I had is that I needed to cook the cake for an additional 15 minutes, but I suspect that's a problem with my oven.  Just do the toothpick test.

I made this with a german chocolate cake mix and made a peanut butter glaze frosting (with pb and powdered sugar).  YUMMY!  It was very moist and really good.  You could do any number of combinations too.

I have tried baking a cake many times but have been unsuccessful. But this one was very easy and came out very good. I used a small vanilla pudding pack ( fatfree ) and also used egg replacers instead of egg. Will try next time with lesser oil. Thanks for the recipie

My husband calls this the "Chocolate Malt Cake".  It is so dense & rich, it almost has a malt type flavor to it.  Don't panic when the cake collapses at the end of cooking.  When it cools & you turn it over onto the serving platter, it looks wonderful.  This cake is now the only chocolate cake we eat!!!  Thank you!

I was having company from out of state for the week end and was pressed for time.  Decided to try this cake and I'm glad I did.  To my surprise it was an instant hit.  The only thing different I did was dust with powdered sugar. No problem sticking to the pan grease and flour well.

A simple pleaser! My boyfriend said it's one of the best he's ever tasted, and he's not a sweet-toothed person. I only used a half cup of sugar, and nearly a cup of semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. Once it cooled, I frosted it with choc. icing.

I made this cake for the first time for a raffle at our charity event.  The person that won it called me for the recipe (and I don't know this person).  They said it was gone in a day!  I used mini choc chips and iced it.

Super duper easy!  The chocolate taste was great, but not overpoweringly so.  I did use mini chocolate chips and no fat sour cream.  My cake kinda fell in the middle and it was a little wrinkly, but everyone loved it and couldn't believe how moist it was.

This cake was a big hit. Instead of using all chocolate chips, I combined with them white chocolate and peanut butter chips.

This was so good.  It was easy, however it took longer than 55 minutes.  Mine went for at least 65 minutes.  I used a springform pan with a bundt insert and the cake came out nice and high.  It was not heavy and doughy at all.  Very moist, very tasty.  Another fan favorite for my family!

I was charged with making a cake for a birthday cake for one of my colleagues at work because the girl that normally makes the cakes was out.  I decided to make this recipe instead of the box mixes that the usual girl makes and it was a hit!  Everyone was asking for the recipe, they all thought it was delicious.  Now I am the designated cake maker!

Most exciting recipe I have made in a long time, because it was so incredibly goooood! Accidentally used 3 oz pudding, and only had milk chocolate chips, EVERYONE loved it!!! I am getting ready to use red velvet mix and the semi sweet chips right now. And can't wait to try the chocolate cake and peanut butter chips  someone suggested in the reviews. Oh and one more really important change I made, and Always make in most recipes, cut the sugar in half! It has only affected one recipe and that was a pretzel crust, it needed the sugar to bind the ingredients, otherwise you just don't need it!

Fine for a quick cake to take to a potluck. Didn't realize that the cake mix I bought was 15.25 oz. (rather than 18.25 oz.) Couldn't find chocolate instant pudding so I used vanilla instead and that box was 5.1 oz. (rather than 5.9). So I used a scant 2/3c vegetable oil, a scant 1/3c water and 1/2c sugar based on another review, and Guittard extra dark chocolate chips for more flavor. Those measurements worked out fine for this. Also added chocolate hazelnut cocoa to the flour so the cake wouldn't look white when it came out of the pan, based on another review. Great tip! Maybe it depends on the brand of mixes used but it tasted a bit of artificial flavoring which the cake mix and pudding mixes both have. I dusted it with powdered sugar... it was a beautiful bundt cake!

This cake was so easy and so delicious! I made it for a church gathering in August, but because of cancellation, we had to freeze it and serve it in September. I was concerned that it would not come out good, after freezing. But, it was delicious!! So moist and flavorful. It almost had a fruity undertone to it. I used a yellow cake mix and chocolate pudding, as indicated. But, my cake came out completely dark (chocolate), unlike the pictures online. I had several people ask for the recipe. And, my son who will not eat cake without icing, devoured this and said no icing was needed. He swiped my piece of cake and I got none! So, I had to take everyone else's word that is was really good. I highly recommend this for the novice baker, someone who needs a quick fix, anyone who needs a bake ahead of time dessert, and anyone who loves chocolate.

I made two of these dump cakes for a cake walk during a harvest festival at my church,and it was reported to me later, these cakes were very delicious! I made one for my family,and they absolutely loved it! Very versatile,and you can use just about any combination of cake mix flavor,or  pudding mix,or substitutions for semi- sweet chocolate chips if desired to switch up flavor combinations.  I subbed chopped apple in one cake,and added sparkling pumpkin sparkling cider for the water,and added it to a simple glaze made with powdered sugar. I poured on top of the cake while still warm. For the 2nd cake,I used pistachio pudding mix in a fudge chocolate cake mix,and substituted a strong brewed cold coffee for the water called for in the recipe to enhance the flavor of the chocolate cake. This is a easy cake to put together for any event,or gathering. Even the novice baker can't go wrong with this cake!

This was very good. The only thing I might do differently next time (and Lord willing there will be a next time) is use about half the chocolate chips or none at all. But all in all it's a keeper!

Super easy to make. I used devils food cake mix and a small box of vanilla pudding and dark chocolate chips because that’s what I had.  Very good. My husband really liked it without any icing or glaze.  I will make again to try different flavors.  Using a bundt cake pan is a nice touch.

My family LOVED this recipe!  The only changes I made was to substitute white baking chips instead of chocolate chips and I used a large box of instant vanilla pudding instead of chocolate pudding.  The cake was extremely moist.

This was easy and used up some things I had in my cupboard and refrigerator. I did not have a yellow cake mix and used an “orange supreme” cake mix instead, following all the directions exactly as written for the original recipe. It was wonderful. If you like the flavors of chocolate and orange together, I can highly recommend that combination!

Family enjoyed this one. I followed exactly and added a thin glaze when it was almost cooled down (simple milk, icing sugar, cocoa, dash of vanilla).

This just tasted like a cake made from a box, albeit a cake with chocolate chips in it. I liked it as much as I would any other box-made cake, but won't be making it again.

To be fair, I used applesauce instead of sour cream as I had no sour cream. Perhaps the sour cream tips it over into delicious. I also left out the sugar and the cake was plenty sweet for my taste.

Really easy- just like making a box mix cake, but with extras. I used pumpkin spice pudding and vanilla Greek yogurt (that's all I had) instead of sour cream, so I didn't add the extra sugar- not sure why it's needed. Only took about 50 minutes to bake.

I made it just as written for a luncheon at work. I received so many compliments! I hated to admit just how easy it was to make. I did sift some confectioners sugar on top to decorate it, but it didn't need anything to add to the flavor. I'll make it again, for sure.

I changed the sugar for trivia baking instead of using sugar.  I would have substituted applesauce for the oil, but I did not have any thawed at the time I decided to make it.  Other than that, everyone loved it.  I would make it again.

I used a regular butter cake and made it as sugar free as I could for my husband. I used two small boxes of sugar free instant chocolate puddings, a scant amount of his fake sugar (which I hate), and apple sauce for oil. This recipe reminds me of my Hummingbird cake. Like this one you just put all ingredients in a big bowl, hand mix, don't beat, and bake. Always turns out, and this one is almost as good. The chocolate made the cake, though. I love dark chocolate and it is definitely rich. You don't need icing. I baked in my convection oven for about 40 minutes.

This cake is soooooo good! I made it per the directions using an orange cake mix, vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips - Y-U-M!!!  Tasted sort of like an orange creamcicle!  And it honestly needs no icing - I was skeptical and tried it with a little bit of icing and it honestly does not need it!  Can't wait to make it again using different flavor combos.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and it came out dense, moist and perfect!  I rarely make bundt cakes, but I will use this recipe again and try different cake mixes, puddings with chocolate, butterscotch or peanut butter chips...and absolutely in a bundt pan...because it makes it so pretty!  It really is SUPER EASY and has a much more interesting taste than regular boxed cake. Clean-up is easy too -- you just need a mixing bowl, measuring cup and bundt pan.  I may try a drizzle of glaze on it the next time too.  I think it would make a great impression at any get-together or pary.  My husband usually wouldn't eat an unfrosted cake, but he LOVED this and even said that it didn't need anything else!

I made this cake on a rainy day about a month ago and decided to freeze it.  I was having company for dinner this past week and remembered this cake was in the freezer.  It was fantastic!  It thawed beautifully and was just as moist as the day it was baked.  I had used a fluted bundt pan so it looked as great as it tasted.  Had thought of dusting it with powdered sugar but was glad I didn't as it was sweet enough.  It got rave reviews from my company and I just emailed them the recipe.  Lorrieviv in NC

I loved the cake but I did not use the amt of pudding mix it calls for.
I used 2 small (1.4 oz) of sugar free instant pudding. I did use regular sugar but I think using Splenda would have been a good idea and will try it next. The cake came out perfect, it was very moist and everyone loved it.

I made this cake for Father's Day since I needed a cake that traveled easily. It was so easy and I can believe how much everyone LOVED IT!! I used Baker's Joy instead of grease and flour for the bundt pan.  I also have made a few variations..I switched out the chocolate pudding for butterscotcjh..was very yummy!  But the family fav seems to be the chocolate pudding with butterscotch chips!!

Tried this recipe exactly as is, overall pretty good - think next time I will use chocolate cake mix instead of yellow and probably skip the chips. Super moist like everyone has noted in earlier reviews and super easy too.

This cake was great. Loved the fact that I didn't have to use the mixer.  Very moist and chocolatey.  I used the smaller box of pudding and no extra sugar and it was wonderful.  Used a dollop of whipped cream for presentation.  Thanks!

I'm a chocolate lover, but even this was too rich for me. I like a lighter, airy texture to my cakes, this was heavy, almost raw. It sounded so good but I was so disappointed and felt wasteful since I ended up throwing in the garbage. Like someone else said, it was tough and hard on the outside, but gooey and rawlike on the inside.

I made this cake for my family the other day and I started cutting the cake for my husand and grandmother and the next few seconds it was gone.  3 days later my husband wants more of this cake. It's easy to make and very moist. I put Nestle Toll House Milke chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet chips. I don't like the semi sweet and it was the best. It's not a very strong chocolate taste for those of you who don't like chocolate just the right taste. My husband said it's a 10.

Nice and moist.  I mixed all but sour cream and choc. chips with a wire whisk instead of a mixer and it turned out fine.  Also, accidently used smaller box of pudding and it still had plenty of chocolate flavor.

As the title says, very easy to make and consistently good due to the cake mix and other not-from-scratch ingredients. I would say this is a good cake to make if you don't have much time. I made this for my coworkers recently and got many compliments. No one knew it had cake mix.

Unbelievably fantastic cake. ALL 5 people in my home LOVED it.
My 14 yr old keep slicing off piece after piece.  I made him quit, then the next morning, there only a small sliver left.  He had attacked it during the night also.
He's been begging me to make another one for a week, so I finally bought the ingredients again today.

Mixed and baked this as described, but I guess I should have figured that if the cake came out dense for others, perhaps I should have made an adjustment for high altitude even though I usually don't have to do that with cake recipes.  This one was more like a brownie, and crumbly - and it sank in the middle and formed a tunnel about 1-1/2 inches deep!  I probably could have filled the sunken in part with ice cream and turned it into an ice cream cake, but wasn't prepared with ice cream to do that.  It does taste okay, though.  Just that if I was going to wait for something to bake, I'd stick to one of the other recipes that I have used in the past.  Thought I'd try something new, but probably will use one of my other recipes next time, unless I feel like making an ice cream tunnel cake in the future.  Very disappointing "flat" cake in my pretty cake stand...

I made this in a 13x9 pan and added chocolate frosting.  Cake was good but not that special -- we would have been just as happy making the boxed mix with no special ingredients.  Also when using a 13x9 pan, the cake kind of fell in the middle.  Maybe I'll try this again in a bundt pan and skip the frosting so the cake flavor can stand on its own.

I made this recipe for a retirement party at work and I rec'd so many good compliments.  Everyone raved and said it was a wonderful cake and could not believe it was from a cake box.  This cake is rich, moist and a definite keeper. I will make it again and again.

I give this five stars because of the its easy and the taste is great.  There are so many different ways you could make this.  I followed the recipe exactly and used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe from this site.

This cake was great!  I changed the recipe a bit by using white chips and I turned it into a 2 layer cake.  The white chocolate chips didn't melt right...the got a bit crunchy at the edges, but nonetheless...delicious!!

Now that's a great cake from a cake mix!  I used a box of vanilla pudding--perfect.  That's a recipe worth keeping and always using when you are in the cake mix mood.  Nothing worse than just a plain old cake mix prepared according to the back of the box!

I didn't have chocolate chips, so I left them out.  I just dusted the cake with powdered sugar.  It was good on my birthday, but FABULOUS the next day!  I'll make this easy and moist cake again.

This was so easy to make and a huge hit after dinner.  I did not have yellow cake mix, so I used chocolate instead, and my choco-holics loved it....also i sprinkled a lol powder sugar ontop just for a decorative touch.

I am a new member to the "All Recipes" website...
Was browsing through the cake recipes and found this one.  Made it the other night and it lasted in my home for 2 days.  My daughters loved it.  I put just a dusting of confectionary sugar on it, but next time may make a chocolate glaze (but one not too sweet) to put on the cake.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Dump cake, was super easy to put together, and will make it again.

I thought this was a great recipe.  My fiance wasn't wild about it, but then he isn't much of a chocolate or cake person.  The next time I make this, I'll use about half of the chocolate chips-it was a little too chocolatey for my taste.  Great for an office party.
