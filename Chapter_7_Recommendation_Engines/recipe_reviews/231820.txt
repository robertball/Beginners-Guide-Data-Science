Butternut Squash comes in different sizes so it makes this recipe a little difficult to review.  I ended up using 2 cups of cooked squash that was freshly picked from the garden.  As with the previous reviewer, my baking time was substantially more than mentioned in the recipe.  This could be because I used a larger squash, or my squash had more moisture because it was freshly picked.  In any case, the muffins were moist and had good flavor.  I wouldnâ€™t add a pecan half on the top next time but perhaps just add some chopped pecans.

I baked muffins for over an hour and they didnt cook, the inside was raw. I let them in the oven on 350f until burned. Didnt rise. Tasted the top and was good flavor.

It took me a little longer than 75 minutes. If you're going to make this, plan on it taking closer to 90 minutes.
