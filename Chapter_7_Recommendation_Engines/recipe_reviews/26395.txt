This recipe was very easy and tasted great. I did make a few changes, using a bottle of clam juice in place of half the water used to simmer the veggies. I also used fat free half and half, which did not seem to affect the flavor or texture of the chowder at all. I also added some crumbled bacon toward the end, which is an ingredient from another fish chowder recipe I have been making for years.

If I do make this soup again, I would either cut the potatoes into larger cubes or simmer it for less time. The reason being is that when I whisked in the flour and butter mixture, most or all of the potatoes dissolved into the soup. This made for a more "mealy" mashed potato type of texture, which my husband does not find to be appropriate for Clam Chowder.

I think I would also sauté the celery before adding the rest of the veggies to simmer, thus cutting down on the simmer time.

Over all a hit for our family!

This recipe was fantastic.  My husband asked "did you make this from scratch?"  I told him I did and asked why.  He said it was the best clam chowder he's ever had.  This recipe went into my book the same day !!!

After four plus years I've made this recipe again. This time, I was not so impressed; lowering my rating from five stars to three. 

I didn't remember having to do so much to actually give this chowder some taste; but, this time, I added a teaspoon of thyme, 5 slices of diced bacon, 4-10 ounce cans of clams with juice, and a lot more pepper.  As written, there simply aren't that many clams, or clam flavor,  and the chowder is very under-spiced. 

Originally Reviewed: Apr. 16, 2003 Fantastic. Simple to make and delicious. I added 4 6.5 oz cans of clams instead of the called for two 10 oz cans, and served topped with bacon and cheddar cheese.

An excellent base recipe that can be adjusted to suit your personal taste.  I sauted the onions and garlic and added them carmelized rather than blending them together.  I added shredded carrots, thyme, rosemary and an extra can of clams and juice!  It was perfect for a rainy, yucky day like today.  Very hearty and everyone I served it to came back for seconds!  Will definately make again.  :-)

This is the best Clam Chowerd in the World.  It was creamy, fresh and wonderful. I tried it as the recipe called for and it was great.  I made it again, and put bacon in it and it was GREAT. I also made Seafood Chowder with Crab, Fish, and Clams.

Great recipe.  Added Thyme and Rosemary and sauteed onion and garlic per previous comments.  Sautee in 2 tbs bacon grease for extra flavor...note; I cut this in 1/2 and I love a thick soup, but this was "spoon stand up" thick.  Will make again with 1/2 amount of flour or another 2 cups of milk.  A couple of shakes of tabasco dosen't hurt either.

This clam chowder is very good and easy to make.  The only thing I added was some Old Bay Seasons.

This chowder is excellent.  I had a partial recipe and this one most closely resembled the ingredients for the recipe I already had.  It's relatively easy to make and tastes like a restaurant chowder.  I added 1 tsp-1 Tbs of dried thyme and about 1/8-1/4 c. of white wine.  I also added an extra can of clams and some chopped scallops.  My family loved it.  Thanks for the recipe Sandy.

I also sauted the celery for about 5 minutes.  You only want to boil potatoes for 12 minutes or they will become mushy.  I also added a small bottle of clam juice.  Company said was as good as they had in Boston.

This was really good chowder.Slightly bland. Plenty thick, made way more than six servings. Way more! At the table added a little onion and garlic powder. Will make this again with a few more seasonings.

The only change i made to this recipe was to add some crispy bacon. I was looking for a recipe to rival the chowder we have had at the restaurants on the coast, and this is IT!!

Wow! this is a keeper! Used the Costco-size can of clams.  When adjusting the seasoning, it needed something. I added some white pepper and oregano. I'll be making this again.

I understand the recipe said to adjust seasonings at the end but it took a lot more salt and pepper to get it right. I think I'll also add some thyme and rosemary next time to add a little more flavor to it. Stir constantly when heating, it wants to stick to the bottom of the pot.

This Clam chowder is simply delicious! My family loved it. Not thick enough but a TBSP of cornstarch did the trick. I added 1 med carrot shredded for color and dried dill. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was very good and creamy. It did need a little more flavor, however. I ended up adding extra salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the finished product. This makes six entree-sized servings.  If you plan on serving this as a first course or with a sandwich, it's probably more like 10 servings.

I love this recipe.  I found it on here a couple of years ago, and everyone who has had it, LOVED it.  I can never find 10 oz cans of minced clams.  I just use 4-6.5 oz cans.  I made this yesterday for a group of friends, and I added 4 slices of crumbled bacon, King Crab, Scallops, corn, little more garlic powder, and some cayenne pepper.  We were having filet, and I had to stop everyone from going for a third bowl to be sure to have room for dinner.  Thanks so much for this amazing recipe!

Yum...we LOVED this!  First, I sauteed some bacon in a pan to crumble over the soup when served, and then I cooked the onion and garlic in the bacon drippings a little before putting them in the blender.  I omitted the celery and added 2 tbsp. sherry and some garlic powder, and it came out so delicious!!

To cut down a bit on fat, we used equal parts "fat free" half-and-half and regular half-and-half.  Overall very good flavor but got way too thick, and we even used less than the suggested amount of butter & flour.  Will make again and try some different spices next time as well and maybe a bit extra clam juice.  Thanks for the good recipe!

This is easy, fast, and delicious. My husband said it is a keeper! I did have to increase the liquid some. I didn't get extra clam juice, I will next time, I just added a little water.

I thought it was tasteless.  If anything, it tastes like a potato soup, but definitely not clam chowder.

My mother (who grew up in New England and has tried lots of clam chowder over the years) said that this was the best chowder she's ever had!!  I did modify the recipe a bit - I added 3/4 of a bottle of clam juice in addition to that reserved from the canned clams.  I also used fat free half and half.  Finally, I added some crisp bacon when I added the half and half.  It was wonderful and soooo rich!!  I will definitely make this again - maybe for our chowder cookoff next year.

This recipe is a hit!! My friends and family are always craving for me to make this. Instead of using flour and butter to thicken up the soup, I've mixed cornstarch and water. You can't tell the difference.

This was a first for me making clam chowder and WOW, it was a total success.  Our family loved it!  Next time I may add a little more flour to thicken it up a bit and add another cup or so of potatoes.  But, without these changes, it was still awesome, and I will definitely make it again!

Mmm! I've only ever had clam chowder out of the can, and I thought that was good until I tried this homemade version! It's thick, creamy, and no more skimpy portions of clam. The only change I made was to soften the onions in a little bit of butter before putting it in the blender. Nice to eat with some good, crusty bread!

I don't like celery so I omitted that and added a can of drained corn. I loved the creamy texture and the taste. Just the right meal when temperatures are falling outside.

This was excellent!  I followed the directions with one exception which was to add an additional 6.25oz can of minced clams & juice.  My husband loved it and my three year old even liked it.  Thanks!

This may have been suggested already but I prepared this slightly differently. While the potatoes were boiling I melted the butter in a saucepan, added the flour and then half and half in the manner you would make  white sauce. When the potatoes were cooked I just added the sauce and its ready to eat. No chance for mushy potatoes this way. Doesn't have a strong clam taste but that is why I love this receipe.

This recipe is delicious! This is the first review I have written about any of the many recipes I have tried on this site. I wanted to tell you of a change I made in this one. Instead of flour, I added a 4 oz package of Idahoan brand Buttery Homestyle mashed potatoes to thicken the soup. It is yummy! If you don't like thick soup, don't add as much. I also added 1 chicken bullion cube to the water. As another review suggested, I cooked the chopped celery for a few minutes before adding the other veggies. That's it! Enjoy!

It was pretty good, it needed a little spicing up, I cut up some bacon and fried it first and also added thyme and more pepper and extra clams too.

I always stayed away from creamed soups because I thought they were to difficult to make.  In the past two weeks I made two recipes.  Clam chowder 111 and a creamed broccoli soup from this site.  Both were out standing.

I will be making this chowder recipe often, for it was a large hit in our household..........allripes.com ROCKS............

Love this chowda!  I didn't blend the stuff together.  Just put garlic salt in the potatoes.  Just won first place in our firm's chili/soup cookoff.  I would love to know if anyone used baby clams, and how that turned out.

Amazing recipe, very good and tasty.  Too much butter and cream though.  The flavors overpower the clams.  I use a little bottle of clam juice instead of adding water to the blender and pot.  Also, not as much half n half: a cup of half n half and 3 cups 2% milk instead of 4 cups half n half. And less butter! Great with these revisions.

I was pretty excited to try this recipe but ened up quite disappointed with the end result - much too bland - actually the only flavour I could detect was flour used as the thickening agent...

Rather than throwing it out, I'll play with some additions - and yes, I did add extra clams bacon for the top as well a jar of clam juice as per other reviews....

I thought it was the best homemade clam chowder I've ever had. Everything was perfect. I added an extra can of clams and clam juice and it was wonderful! I love thick chowder and the thickness was just right! Thank you so much!

Just a little too heavy for my personal taste.  But good overall flavor. I will probably try it with milk or half & half instead of cream.

I found this chowder to be good, but a little on the bland side. So I added an extra can of clams, 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp seasoning salt, 1 tsp dried dill and a couple slices of crumbled cooked bacon. I will definately be making this one again. Thanks

I did a lot of good changes so I will post an upgraded recipe, but the changes are easy:  I add one 14oz can of corn with liquid, use 10 oz of Clam Juice and use IQF whole clams and bump the amount to 26 oz instead of 20 oz.  I also take the rue from 3/4 cup to a full cup of flour & butter.

This is a wonderful clam chowder recipe.  I have made it twice in the last week.  Hmm Hmm.  The only thing I did differently was add 2 - 10 oz bottles of clam juice instead of water to cover potatoes before cooking.

I love this recipe!  I use it every time I want clam chowder.  The only minor changes I make is that I don't puree anything...we prefer chunkier soup.  I saute the onions, garlic and celery.  I add more potatoes then it calls for...again, we like chunkier soup.  :-)  I add Herbes de Provence or any mixed type herb as well.  I also have only found cans of clams that are  6.5 oz so I do four cans for a total of 26 oz vs the 20 oz called for.    
It is so yummy!  Serving it in bread bowls is icing on the cake. :-)
Enjoy!

Outstanding!  I love clams so I used 4 cans, and used heavy cream instead of the half and half.  (also doubled the recipe as I have a large family.) My family fell in love!  My son that will grudgingly eat clam chowder had 3 bowls!  Great recipe - and its good whether you follow to the letter, or doctor up to suit your family~

Very tasty!  I did alter the method a little bit so I'm rating based on that.  Instead of pureeing the vegetables, I finely chopped and sautéed them in the butter.  Added the potatoes and clam juice and cooked as instructed.  I set aside 1 c of half and half, added the rest to the pot, whisked the flour into the reserved 1 c, then added to the pot.  I couldn't get 10oz cans of clams, so I used 2 6oz cans of minced and 2 6oz cans of chopped (I like the 2 different textures). I also added a little fresh dill - the best chowders I've ever eaten have had dill in them.  It ended up being what a chowder should be, creamy, rich tasting, and thick.

Made this for my husband. Flavor is great, instead of water, I used a home cooked veggie stock. Also he said maybe next time 1/2 cup less potatoes, and a little more celery, for his likes. But, he's going back for a second bowl. Very Good basic soup which could be used for a cheesy potato, cream of mushroom, and a corn chowder.

This recipe is amazing just as it. I made it last year and told my mother how great it was so the asked me to make it for Christmas Eve since we always have soup of some kind. On Christmas Eve I made it substituting the Clams with Cod since my Uncle is allergic to shellfish. This way was also a big hit and my mother thought this was better than any chowder she has even made. My mother asked me to make this again this year and I had the hardest time finding the recipe since I forgot to save it. I searched on here by ingredients I knew were in it and once I saw the pic I knew this was it! :)

Excellent! I made this chowder for the first time tonight and it turned out amazing! I love clams though, so I decided to add 2 more cans of chopped, rather than minced, making a total of 2 minced and 2 chopped. I will be using this recipe in the future for anytime I decide to make clam chowder again! As my friend and i say, "Great Chyowda!"

I had to give this three stars because my boyfriend stated that it was just missing something.  He didn't say it was bad, just not the best.  I don't eat clam chowder but his family is big on it so I trust his opinion.

This is my second review.  This is my favorite recipes as of right now.  I did make a couple of small changes. I bought bottled oyster juice and used instead of water.  I used 4 cans of chopped clams, I like my clams meaty.  :)

Just the recipe I've been lookin for - a creamy rich New England style clam chowder.  Very rich and worth the calories on occasion, but can be more healthy (and still very tasty) with a mixture of milk and half/half.  I appreciate the reviewers comments on spices, because it still needs just a little more punch.  Next time will add corn, and perhaps some fresh thyme and rosemary.  Has anyone tried fresh parsley??

Being from New England, I didn't find this recipe to be the best.  I found a copy cat recipe for leagel seafood clam chowder that is much better.
