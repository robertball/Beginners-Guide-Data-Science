Diced day-old rolls into 2" cubes. Lots more garlic & onion powder 'cause our house likes that. Baked 10-11 minutes. Consistency of cheese puffs, but garlic!

I used quite a bit more olive oil, and sprinkled some Italian seasonings over them once they were on the sheet ready to go in the oven. I found that 8 minutes wasn't quite as long as mine needed, so I did a total of 11. But this recipe provided an excellent foundation for a great addition to our meal!

I wanted these crouton slices for soup, I thought 1" would be too thick, so I sliced the bread about 1/2" which worked perfectly.  Very simple to make and nice flavor.  Worked great for the french onion soup I had for lunch today but would be equally good just to spread with whatever you usually use on crostini.
