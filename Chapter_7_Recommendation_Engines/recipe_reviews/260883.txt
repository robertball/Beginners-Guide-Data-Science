I made this cake last week with a few adjustments and it turned out amazing. Instead of regular flour I used cake flour. And I used a tsp  almond extract and a tsp vanilla extract just to give it a different taste. I also add a half of box of pudding to keep the cake moist since I read one person review about their cake being dry. The caramel icing turned out perfect. I didn’t change anything in the icing. I will say when I make it again I will wait until my cakes are cooling before I make the icing. I didn’t get any pictures the cake was literally devoured the same day. I plan on making it again later today. I will take pictures of the next one!!!

I made this for a friend's birthday celebration. I did split each layer (making it a 6 layer cake) and I made 1 1/2 recipe of the icing so I would have plenty.  It was a HUGE success--everyone loved it! My only issue was getting the icing smooth, as it hardened up once it cooled and was rather difficult to deal with getting around the sides of the cake. I would make it again and perhaps not add quite as much confectioner's sugar to the icing.

The cake was difficult to make. I followed the recipe exactly and my first batch had the consistentlcy of corn bread after cooling. Made it again and cooked it less, and it was really dense. Never could get the batter to the ribbon stage despite adding more milk. I altered the icing a bit due to other reviews and it was absolutely amazing!!!!  Best caramel icing I ever ate and not grainy at all. More like caramel fudge. I used 3 cups brown sugar, 2 cups butter, 1/4. +1/8 tsp salt, 12 oz evaporated milk, 1 pkg confections’ sugar
sifted, and 3 tsp vanilla extract. Started frosting the cake  about 5 minutes after finishing mixing because even though it’s still warm, it stiffens quickly. Had plenty of icing to do the whole cake and poured the rest into a little pan to set for fudge!! One more thing, don’t get disheartened if your cakes sink a tad when they cool because that’s makes them easier to ice. The little divot holds the icing while it sets. If I make this again and they come out domed I will cut the tops flat to make them easier to ice. Otherwise the icing will run off before setting.

I only made the icing and it was fabulous and so EASY!
for a 3 layer cake you need to 1 1/2 the recipe.
I did 1 cup butter to 1 cup brown sugar
Or 1 1/2 cup butter to 1 1/2 cup brown sugar,
And did not need all the box of Powered sugar for one recipe.
only used about 3 cups, adding a little at a time til consistency I wanted. Perfect ! Great ! Thanks!!!!

Perfect. Took it to a party where a store-bought birthday cake was served, and mine was wiped out. I sliced each cake layer in half, so I had a 6 layer cake. It takes a full batch and a half of frosting to cover 6 layers. Some people said the frosting sets up too quickly and becomes difficult to spread. Near the end, I popped mine in the microwave for 8-10 seconds and it was like new again. This recipe is a keeper.

In my family, there was a competition every Christmas to see who made the best caramel cake. Some would add walnuts, pecans or drizzles of chocolate. Even change color of the cake using food coloring!  My grandmother always won!  This recipe reminds me so much of our days baking together. Delicious!

I've baked this cake several of times. Once as a triple layer but usually as a bundt. Sometimes I make it with the icing and other times I don't . It's always moist and bursting with flavor.

Made recipe exactly as listed, but icing kept growing and growing. I had 2 cups leftover after icing entire 3 layer cake....very strange. Recipe should also warn icing works better when slightly cooled in fridge so layers don't slide all over. Cake is absolutely delicious and I would make again!

This cake was so sweet and the icing could cause diabetes on it's own!
In total the recipe has 7 cups of sugars (3 white, 2 brown and 2 powdered) . It also uses 5 sticks of butter.
It tastes fantastic and the icing is devine but I will have to play with the recipe to see if less sugar can be used.

This is a pretty good cake! I did take a lot of the other reviewers' suggestions while making it. I reduced the sugar in the cake itself to 1 1/2 cups, used 1 1/2 tsps baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, used sour cream in place of milk, and added 2 tsps vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract. This created a pretty decent tasting cake, but even with the added leavening, it still wasn't as light and fluffy as I'd hoped. Maybe separating the eggs, whipping the egg whites, and then folding them into the batter would help? Nevertheless, the real star here though is the caramel frosting. And that worked wonderfully for me! I made 1 1/2 times the recipe, and that made enough to fill, crumb coat, and then frost the cake. I used 1 1/2 cups butter, 3 1/4 cups dark brown sugar, 1 cup heavy cream in place of evaporated milk, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tbsp vanilla, and only 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar. Adding this amount of powdered sugar kept the frosting from being overly sweet--but it did require the caramel to cool completely before being whipped in order to get to the correct frosting consistency. The frosting tastes just like a Werther's Original candy, and it's truly fantastic! Overall, I would make a different yellow cake recipe next time, just as a personal preference, and would keep the frosting recipe the same as I made it this time. Thank you for the recipe!

I wouldn’t change anything! We loved it! The cake was so fluffy and the caramel was delicious. The cake took closer to 35-40 minutes to bake.

When I made this I baked it as a bundt cake.  Since I didn't lower the cooking temperature soon enough, it was a little overdone on the outside.  The caramel icing was a little thicker than I wanted, but I see how the recipe would totally work as a layered cake.  Tasted good, felt like it should have had a little more vanilla in the cake.

I did not make any changes to this recipe, it was almost perfect. I am going to make again and stick with this recipe, but I plan on cutting the sugar in the cake recipe by about a 1/2 cup. The cake was a bit too sweet for my taste.

4 stars, really good (guests RAVED!), but I had trouble with the icing (there was JUST enough).  Doing a crumb coat proved to be a bad idea as the now-cooler icing pulled up that coat with more crumbs.  Good flavor.  The cake is a little dense.

I made the cake exactly as the recipe stated. The cake was more of a pound cake. Although the cake was good, it wasn't what I was expecting for a caramel cake. The caramel was okay. The recipe is a good base but I will make adjustments in the future to make the cake and caramel buttery.

I used duck eggs because I had them and made four thin layers.  It didn’t last long. I was so pleased that the caramel didn’t have any graininess at all.

I used my own cake recipe, but I definitely give 5 stars to the caramel icing recipe!!! I’m a trained pastry chef and one of my arch nemeses is Caramel frosting. This recipe was very easy. I followed the directions exactly. Out of curiosity I temped the mixture while it was boiling and it only got to 226 degrees. Nevertheless, after cooling slightly, the icing still whipped to the perfect consistency.

This cake was overly sweet. So sweet you can’t eat it. The cake itself was extremely sweet then the icing was extremely sweet as well. I’d definitely add less sugar to the cake or try a different cake. I even left out some of the confectioners sugar and just after tasting it my teeth hurt lol. This would be a great cake base for strawberry shortcake type of thing with whip cream and strawberries but not for this Caramel cake. Cake was moist and almost cornbread like. Caramel was good just suuuuuper sweet.

The cake was great!!! Icing took a little bit longer than I expected but turned out great. Just to cut the sweetness I added some pecans to the cake mix and some salted, buttered and sautéd pecans to the top. WOW was it good!!!

I substituted half of the white sugar with brown.  It was like fudge, but there are about 24 servings because it is SO rich.  Very dense, in a good way.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday and I found it quite tasty and easy to make.  I do think the sugar both in the cake and in the frosting can be reduced.  I made the cake as listed but included 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  For the frosting, I used approximately 12 oz of confectioner's sugar and added a bit more salt to balance out the sweetness.  I also think it might be better to make this as two layers and perhaps increase the baking powder to 1 tsp.

I made this cake as well as the icing and this is a great recipe overall, except you need 1.5 times the ingredients for the icing in order to cover the entire cake as well as enough to go in between each layer. But other than that, this cake looked beautiful, and tasted AMAZING.

Easy recipe to follow but takes some time. Enjoyed the cake but just too sweet for my taste. If I make it again, I would definitely cut at least 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar in the icing. It hardened quickly making it hard to ice the cake in time.

I made this for a birthday cake and it was a hit for the birthday person and the others in the family.  The icing was so thick that I could hardly spread it, but it was mmm mmm good. I found myself scraping the bowl I made the icing in to get all I could. Others who tried this said I could make this for them any time I wanted to.

Five stars!! Very good recipe! The only change I made (just my preference) was to at a few tablespoons of cornstarch to the caramel sauce. I like mine to be a little thicker consistency. Well done!
