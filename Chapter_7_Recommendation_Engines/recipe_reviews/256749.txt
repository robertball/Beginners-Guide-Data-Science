Excellent, tender, eazy, and fast. Added cabbage,carrots, and potatoes
 at end of beef cook time. Cooked cabbage, potatoes, carrots in beef broth. Cooked in pressure cooker 10 minutes -- 7 minutes potatoes and carrots, 3 minutes cabbage. All came out excellent. Used spice packet.

I'm just experimenting with a new pressure cooker.  This made a very good brisket.  I like a little crust, so after pressure cooking, put it under a brioler for about 5 minutes on each side.

The only thing I would change, is something I learned a long time ago. Cut your corned beef into the size of chicken thighs, and put in the pressure cooker with fat side up. The corned beef are now in individual servings and, when chilled, are very, very easy to slice.... !!Erin go braugh!!

This recipe was delicious.  The pressure cooking made the corned beef so tender.  I was surprised that they said to throw away the spice packet but the flavor was delicious.  I have always used the slow cooker for corned beef but this is my new go to.

Very good and not overdone. I must admit I didn't like the beer flavour, but that may be because I used a stout. Next time I'll try an ale. Nice tender meat.

Was an excellent recipe.  Even the grandkids who normally don't like anything "different" enjoyed it.

This recipe seems to simple to be good, but my husband and I were both amazed by how only a couple of ingredients combined tastes so good.  We followed the recipe EXACTLY the first time with a 4-4.5 lb corned beef.  The second time we made this with another 4-4.5 lb corned beef we added just a few favorite spices (like smoked paprika) that would not overwhelm the beer.  The second time I made this I was pressed for time so I set the pressure cooking time for 1 hour, then let it sit in the pot until hubby was home from work, which ended up being over 20 mins NP.  Worked fine, and I may do that from now on.  And DO NOT ADD SALT!!!  Read about Corned Beef...  it is salt cured!

Followed the recipe exactly but the meat turned out really tough and super chewy.  Ate it just so I wouldnâ€™t waste an expensive piece of meat with lots of horseradish on the side. So disappointed!

Came out perfect. So tender. I used beef broth instead of beer and it was just amazing.

The Corned Beef Brisket was indeed very tender and went well with the Cabbage and Jasmin Rice.

Using the pressure cooker method turned out just as good as the much longer slow cooker. Pressure and the beer worked well together. I still added the spice packet that came with the corned beef. This method did take the full 90 minutes in order to finish the beef.  Excellent result!

first time using my new instant pot.  meat was juicy and tender, not a big fan of the onion and garlic powder.  wanted more traditional corned beef flavor.  next time  i'll use the enclosed spice pack and omit the other seasonings.  the beer however was a nice addition.
