I don't know if I'd call this a salad - It's more like a side dish or an appetizer. But that aside, it's really good! Between the escarole, the lemon and the kalamata olives, there are some intense flavors battling for attention.

Tasted just like the escarole I had at a high-end local Italian restaurant!

I'm giving this recipe four stars for flavor, although I did add several cloves of chopped garlic, however, I'm giving "escarole" in general one star. My daughter had a similar dish at a friends and loved it, so she asked me to make it for her. I don't know what went wrong, but my escarole came out tough and chewy. I don't claim to be escarole savy, but I certainly cooked it long enough. If anyone out there has any suggestions, I would certainly appreciate it because we honestly couldn't even finish it. Again, the flavors were great Tammy and I'll give this another try if I can find a way to tenderize the leaves.

Healthy, easy to make and yummy!!  My only suggestion is to add a little garlic and red pepper to the oil before adding the Escarole and to reduce the amount of lemon juice to maybe a quarter of a cup.  Very Good, Thanks!!

We loved this recipe. Did not think the lemon was too much, as mentioned by some reviewers but we did use Meyer lemons from our tree which are a milder flavor so maybe that is why. I did not see that the recipe required 2 heads of escarole so I only purchased one, then wound up tossing in  baby arugula after the salad was removed from the heat to make up for the missing escarole. I think I may almost prefer it this way in the event I prepare this again. All at our dinner party loved it but we are bitter greens lovers. The capers were especially nice! We served this as a salad/side dish with a polenta &  braised short ribs - perfect to cut the creaminess & fattiness of the other items served.

This was my first time cooking escarole. It came out good, except that the lemon was overpowering. I agree with the previous post- halving the lemon juice would have made it much better.

I love the idea, but the lemon was too much for me; next time, I'll halve it. Like other reviewers, I added garlic to the olive oil. I went to four markets and couldn't find escarole or frisee, so I used spinach and arugula.

This was absolutely fabulous!  We decided to add a little slivered garlic and a few red pepper flakes to the oil just before the escarole for a bit more zing.  Nice and healthy, too!

Disclaimer: I'm not a fan of escarole! But my CSA keeps sending it to me, so I keep searching for uses. I think this is my favorite so far, as I'll finish it without groaning inside. The recipe is fine. I made no changes to the recipe, although I'd wanted to add garlic, and think it would work well with the dish.

Haven't tried this yet, but must comment.  Based on the photo, the greens appear to be endive and not escarole.  Just sayin'.   Anybody else seeing what I'm seeing?

This is a typical Sicilian dish. I reduced the lemon, drastically. I added some red pepper flakes and oregano. Thank you for the recipe.
