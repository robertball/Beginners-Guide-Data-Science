The cornbread topping really made this dish great. I changed the recipe just a little bit and it turned out really good. Instead of corn I used a can of diced potatoes and a can of sliced carrots. I also added just a little bit of velveeta. I also doubled the rest of the recipe.

I'm going to rate this even tough I altered the ingredients. So based upon my alternations I think this is awesome. I added a pie crust to the bottom for a real pie feel. Also switched from can to frozen mixed veggies instead of just corn. Also I will def add more seasonings next time this was very bland. But easy and very nice looking!

This is really good. I've never had a pot pie with a cornbread topping. It was quite a change and quite good. I used left over Thanksgiving turkey. I bought cauliflower and broccoli for Thanksgiving dinner and didn't use all of it so I added a bag of frozen beggies to the mix and  I used fat free soup. Out of curiosity I made it as directed the first time, but the second time I made it, I added 1/2 cup drained salsa, some shredded PepperJack along with the Cheddar Cheese, plus a table spoon of taco seasoning to the turkey mixture. For the veggies I used half a can of drained and rinsed black beans and the corn cut from 2 ears of corn.  Wow. both ways were great and  I will absolutely be making it again...both ways.

I loved it but I made some changes thanks to the other reviews. I added parmesan cheese, garlic powder, crushed red peppers, and papricka to the cornbread mix. I also made twice as much and added carrots as well as corn. My family LOVED it!

My family LOVES this recipe.  I always add some pepper, parsley and garlic powder to the filling for flavor.  Also, instead of a mix, I use the Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread recipe from this site for the topping.  I have also used mixed veggies instead of just corn.  I like that this a complete meal all in one.

Pure comfort food!  After looking over the reviews, I decided to replace the 8 ounce can of corn with a 14.5 ounce can of cream corn (to add more liquid).  I also added sauteed onion and garlic to the chicken.  My choice of cornbread mix (Jiffy) added sweetness to the pie.

I used 2 boxes of cornbread mix and used half of the batter to bake in the pan until it started turning golden then poured the mixture. Omitted the cheese and poured the rest of the cornbread mix on top. Baked until golden brown. Very delicious

The filling was very bland so in order to make it a 5 star I added 3 minced garlic cloves, some garlic powder, parsley, and pepper.  I substituted the corn with peas and carrots for some color.  I used campbell's cream of chicken and mushroom so I can poison my family with more veggies.  I love my version better.  The filling to bread ratio was half and half.  Next time I will add more filling.  Thanks Campbell for the formula.

Okay, so I know this is a Campbell's recipe, but I didn't have the soup on hand, so I sort of just used the recipe as a jumping off point for what I ended up making. I substituted the soup with what is essentially gravy (like chicken-a-la-king base). I didn't have corn, either, and I like lots of vegetables. So, I added fresh potatoes, carrots, onions and frozen peas. I softened the carrots and potatoes in the microwave while the onions were being sauteed in olive oil. Added the peas when the onions were almost translucent (just to defrost them). Turned off the heat and mixed in the carrots and potatoes. The chicken I used was frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts. After defrosting, I tenderized and seasoned them with salt, pepper, dried parsley and garlic powder. Then cooked them in olive oil over medium-low heat until just lightly browned. The rest was prepared according to the recipe, except for the omission of cheese (I just wasn't in the mood for it). Though next time, I think I'll divide the cornbread mix and partially pre-bake half of it in the pie plate so that we have a bottom crust. The top was pretty thick, and I think it'd be nice if the bread was a bit more mixed in with the filling. So this rating is for what I ate. The original recipe just seemed a bit too basic for me.

This was pretty good and easy to make! I had 1/2 a roasted chicken to use up, this fit the bill for that. I also used a whole 15 oz. can of corn, it worked out fine. Over all, a pretty good meal!

I made this Vegetarian. I used cream of broccoli, but you could also use cream of mushroom/ asparagus/ etc, and instead of chicken/turkey, I fried some tofu and used that. I used soy milk instead of regular and I added spices and instead of just corn, used 2 cans mixed veggies. It was delicious, and boyfriend approved.

This recipe is very easy and is pretty tasty. However, I think it really needs some veggies. Next time, I plan to add a bag of broccoli,carrots, and cauliflower to it. Also, I think it tasted better when I re-heated the leftovers a few days later. The first time I ate it, it tasted liked a can of soup with chicken in it. The second time, the flavors had blended more. I think it might also taste good with ham instead of chicken.

Ok for a different twist on potpie, but way too much corn flavor for us. Don't think i'll make it again unless I use different vegetables to add a different flavor.

I like the recipe, it was very easy to follow. I added canned whole potatoes (cut them up), cooked in large cup cake pan of 6. I would change how there isn't a bottom to the pot pie. I scooped out the pot pie from the cup cake pan and all the goodies came out. Would like to see a bottom layer added to this, I will do that next time ??

I was all set to make this and discovered that my chicken was bad so I had to improvise which I normally don't like to do. So instead, I used one pound of hamburger, a can of condensed cream of potatoe soup and mixed vegetables. I don't like to change recipes the first time through but this sounded good and I really wanted to try it. It turned out great!!

Ever since I first tried this recipe 6 months ago, it has been a family favorite. I made some modifications(as every good cook does) to fit my family so the recipe doesn't really look the same. I doubled the recipe for my family of 5,I used 2-12oz jars of turkey gravy instead of the chicken soup and added sour cream. I heated the gravy and sour cream on the stove added the chicken that I had cooked in butter with diced garlic and a little lemon pepper seasoning. when the sour cream/gravy mix is heated and bubbly I added a blend of broccoli, carrots, and peas. I put the mix into a 9x13 baking dish and topped it with the corn bread mixture. I Baked for about 20-25minutes (uncovered)until the cornbread is golden. My kids, who are very picky eaters, love this recipe. Sometimes I let them decide which veggies to add.Sometimes I sprinkle Swiss cheese over the top of the cornbread, Yumm!

Based on previous reviewers, I added a lot of spices...minced garlic to the chicken mixture and onion powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes to the cornbread topping.  I much prefer Chicken Souiza Cornbread Bake (on this website), though it requires a bit more work than this recipe, it's definitely worth it!

I love all variations of a pot pie! I jazzed up the recipe a little bit though. 

I cubed up my chicken and tossed it with taco seasoning and a little bit of water. Instead of just corn, I used a frozen southwestern corn mixture. And I replaced the cream of chicken soup with the new Philadelphia Santa Fe cooking creme. It was great. 

Maybe next time I will jazz up the cornbread mixture with some jalapenos and cheese!

My DH and I loved this dish, the cornbread was a nice change from how I usually make this dish (with mashed potatoes). The only changes I made were to add some creole to the chicken for some flavor, a handful of shredded cheddar on top of the veggie mix, add about 1/4c. parm to the cornbread mix. My cornbread mix only called for 2/3c. water so that's what I did. I will most definitely be making this again!

I followed a few suggestions from others by adding a few more vegetables, salt, pepper and taco seasoning. Easy and a hit at my house. Will make again. I added a bit more cheese on the top and topped it with sour cream. Very good.

5 star based on alterations because it is a base recipe and very flexible. Used fresh roasted chicken breasts - I added a  can of low fat mushroom soup. And I feel this important: chopped celery, onion and garlic and added to frozen pea/ carrots - all of this i sautéed in butter before adding to chicken. I seasoned with salt, pepper, a little garlic powder and herbs de providence( in lieu of poultry season) this came out fantastically and I will definitely make again and again.

This was a fantastic dish and my husband calls it "comfort food"! The only change I made was putting in mixed veggies instead of corn. Other than that, if you follow the recipe it will turn out perfectly!

I'm giving this 4 stars as it's "good".  The basic recipe is a great foundation to make this awesome.  The cornbread topping is easy and tasty. I used creamed corn, carrots and peas as the veggies.
  Now, I think, generally speaking, chicken pot pie is bland.  It's Good, but won't make your taste buds dance.  I added Essence of Emeril, 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes, 1 tsp black pepper..which helped a little. Ended up putting hot sauce on it even after serving.   My next try with this recipe is to make a TexMex version.  Add taco seasoning to the chicken, add a can of drained Rotel Tomatos etc.

Wish I could rate this dish better. The concept is great, however as I was afraid, the cornbread just soaked up every bit of sauce. At the first bite I had to run to the kitchen to make up a sauce to put on top. May try some sort of variation of this again....but definitely have got to have about 2 cups more of some type of sauce!

This was a big hit with my husband and grandkids (8, 10). I used boiled chicken thighs and canned "Mexicorn" to add a bit of color. The cornbread set just fine but filling was fairly runny. Next time I'll add some green vegetable (green beans, peas) for color and will pat dry vegetables and chicken to get a firmer pie. Having chicken pre-cooked and cut would make this dish a snap. Also, I made an extra batch of cornbread (recipe from box with less milk), let it set while pie baked and used the hot oven to make corn muffins for the week.

Not bad. I added 1 cubed & cooked russet potato to the mix, and therefore added an additional half can of soup. I didn't use a pie plate because it created too much volume and instead used an oval casserole dish. I completely forgot to add the cheese and it was still pretty yummy.

It turned out great! The only thing I did different was made homemade cream of chicken soup since I had stock from the roast chicken that the meat came from. This recipe helped me finish off leftovers. I'll definitely make this again. My husband and I loved it! Super easy!

I made two pies with the frozen pie crust deep dish used one small can of corn add a can of carrots  and frozen peas.   I cubed the boneless chicken breast fried and a little cooking spray and butter with garlic powder and parsley salt and pepper.  Then I feel the piecrust when you add the corn bread mix there will be a little left over that I baked alone and they came out delicious !

My family liked the cornbread topping. I doubled the recipe and altered it. I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables (thawed) instead of the corn. I also mixed the cheese in with chicken mixture vs. putting it on top. My family got second helpings which is usually the case with other pot pies I have made.

I used this recipe to make my pot pie because I didn't have ready made pie crust. I used a Sweet Potato muffin mix for the topping, used on can of cut carrots, jar of gravy, big pieces of leftover chicken breast and fresh string beans from our garden. Needed an idea for a different crust and this was helpful. Really good too! Used the muffin mix because we're don't like cornbread.

Amazing ! I sautéed my chicken with minced garlic fresh thyme and rosemary added a 14oz can of organic mixed vegetables then a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning a teaspoon of black pepper and some parsley for color. Warmed all together. Added 12oz cream of chicken soup to the mix. Made my jiffy corn bread with an egg that I let sit until it was room temperature. Then let the mix itself sit 10 minutes or so. Both of these steps make for a more  fluffy cornbread. Added the soup mix the the pie pan then the jiffy corn bread on top. WOW knocked this one way out of the park !

I will make this again, but we like things a little more savory in our house.  I had added spices to my cooked chicken as I was shocked that the recipe did not call for any.  Next time I will add some heat (roasted chiles) in order to make this a little angry.

Used leftover brined chicken from Trader Joe's plus onions, carrots, peas and potatoes cooked with it. Used cream of potato soup because it was in the pantry. Added a bit of milk based on reviews I'd read. Also added Herbes de Provance, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  For the cornbread used less milk than called for on this recipe but more than 1/3 cup. Three adults ate the whole pie and loved it!

Made the dish on Sunday, it was gone Monday. I shared with 3 other people who were raving about the sweetness of the cornbread paired with the chicken potpie filling. Aside from cooking the chicken, the dish was super easy to make and it was so good. The only that I would like to point out is that the recipe calls for more milk to be added to the cornbread mix than what is listed on the box. In my opinion, the extra milk made the cornbread batter too liquid so it didnt brown like I wanted it to. But aside from that, it was quick, easy and good!!

Absolutely delicious! I tweaked the recipe a bit. I cooked the chicken in butter, a tablespoon of minced garlic, & a sprinkle of pepper. I also added more cheddar cheese, just enough to cover the chicken/corn/soup mixture, & then I sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on top of that. Tasted amazing! My kids loved it & my fiance ate over half the pie! This is definitely going in the recipe box.

It seems like too much milk (3/4 cup) for the corn muffin mix. I had a mess with the very thin batter running over the pie plate. I removed what I could then started again with another box of muffin mix and just 1/3 cup milk. It was much better.

I used the topping for my own pot pie.  I put it a larger, shallow corning ware dish insted of pie plate and there was plenty of corn muffin to cover it. My son really enjoyed it.  Much quicker than making a pie crust.

This was delicious!  My husband and I ate every last bite!  I slow-cooked the chicken using bag n season and natures seasoning for flavor.  I used half a can of corn and half a can of green beans.  I also seasoned it well before cooking (salt, pepper, nature's seasoning).  I used Marie Calendars corn bread mix, but made it as the recipe said...except I added a large pre-sauteed jalapeno to the corn bread mixture.  It was to die for!
