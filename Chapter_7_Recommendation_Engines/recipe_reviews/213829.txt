I just pulled this out of the oven and tried a piece, and I really like it. It's slightly sweet and the crumb almost reminds me of cornbread. My husband just tried a bite and said, "Oh, that is good!" It doesn't matter to me if it's truly authentic or not, I just wanted something tasty to serve. Thank you for an easy and tasty recipe to serve with St. Patrick's Day dinner!

I had to make this since my ancestors are from County Cork! It is awesome right out of the oven. No butter needed.  I didn't have raisins, but I didn't miss them at all.

True to its name.  My grandmother is also from County Cork and this is exactly the recipe she uses.

This is one of the better soda breads that I have made. I left out the raisins because I don't like raisins in my soda bread, but otherwise I followed the directions exactly. It was a sweet bread with a tasty texture (like another reviewer stated - it has a cornbread-type of consistency). My whole family enjoyed it, and I will definitely be making it again.

Mine was done (and a little over cooked at that) at 40 minutes. Next time I will only use 1 cup of raisins, they were sort of over powering.

I just baked this recipe and it turned out sweet, rich and crunchy on the outside.  Excellent.  I needed a self-rising flour recipe since I was out of regular. Also I had to use yogurt rather than milk.  This is so good I am going to experiment with dates, blueberries and raspberries in place of raisins.

I have found that this one is the best. I have been making your Irish soda bread recipe for the past three years now. Thanks so much!

Irish Tip: To stop your breads being too hard and TOO crunchy on the outside, when you turn out your bread drape a clean teacloth over the top until the bread is cooled a little. The steam trapped in the cloth softens the crust just enough to make the bread fabulously easy to eat. DON'T WORRY YOUR BREAD WILL NOT GO SOGGY. This authentic Irish tip works VERY well.It also works for homebaked or all breads and particularly baguettes.

I love this recipe.  Since my family isn't crazy about raisins, I omit them and I cut the sugar back to a 1/2 cup.  I lightly knead the dough and form it into a round loaf and cut a deep cross in the middle like a traditional soda bread.  It's a sweet, crunchy, and crumbly slice of heaven!

This was great.  I used only one cup of raisins, and baked it 45 minutes in a 10 inch, deep-dish pie plate.  It was really hard to mix that much flour into such a small amount of butter, next time I  may  use the mixer.  After mixing in the milk and egg, I had a lot of dry flour still in the bottom of the bowl.  I finally mixed it up with my hands, and patted it into the pan.   We ate it warm, and it had excellent taste, with or without butter.   Will definitely make it again.

Very good, but I won't use a 9" pan again!  Mine overflowed a little, but otherwise it was great.  Nice texture, perfect amount of sweetness. Definitely will make again!
