So good! I had no idea what Szechwan seasoning was so we substituted montreal burger seasoning. You don't have to use the smuckers brand... only if you want to. This was delicious!! Definitely a keeper.

This was so simple to make and so good!  I do think that it would be better with chicken (the sauce reminded me of general chicken).  I didn't tweak it much at all, but I had to use cherry jam instead of the plum.  I couldn't find plum anywhere.  I did not care for the peanut butter flavor, so that will be omitted next time too.
