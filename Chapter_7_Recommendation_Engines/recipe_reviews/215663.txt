I'm cleaning out my cupboards before I move and I found this recipe. Instead of regular grahams, I used chocolate grahams. My husband and kids thought this was fabulous. Next time, I'll be sure to try the cinnamon grahams--I bet that would be out of this world.

So simple and made everyone want to have a glass of cold milk.  Just be sure DO NOT USE PARCHMENT, even though there was no mention of it, I use it in everything, mistake, stuck like glue. The edges will be quite hard at the longer cooking time, FYI, for those who have fillings, no kidding.  So delish, everyone loved them. I did the longer cooking time and decided to cut off the harder edges just in case.  Very yummy, many asked for the recipe.

I did it with cinnamon grahams and it was amazing! Also, I used a food processor to grind the crackers and it worked well.

Well...it taste like chocolate and graham crackers, and not a bad deal. Looks like grainy fudge and was good. This was too easy to make. I reached for everything and followed to a T, but nothing bad. I didn't have milk chocolate chips, it was dark chocolate...okay a no biggie, I didn't have regular graham crackers, they too were chocolate grahams. SO just because of a minor flavor change, it still worked. I used my Ninja chopper and crushed the grahams into fine crumbs. The only time I got worried was when I mixed the crumbs in with the chocolate mixture. Make sure with this tip...keep mixing to incorperate the crumbs fully. I lined an 8x10 pan and poured right in. It started setting immediately. Hubby says they were just fine. I tasted 2 pieces and I thought the same. I could totally see decreasing some of the crumbs and adding an addition of nuts as a spin off recipe. But all in all, a nice basic recipe that can totally be a stepping stone for other fudgy recipes with other ingredient combinations.

My little guy LOVED these. Called them his little fudge cakes. I agree that these didn't set as well as other fudge recipes. I think one can of milk is enough. Very very tasty.

The best I can say is that this recipe was ok. It did not set up as well as a good fudge recipe would. I also not sure I loved the flavor that adding Graham Crackers gave it. Im thinking that perhaps oats might work better. I love trying new and different recipes, so I thought Id give this one a try. But I dont think I will use it again.

Fun recipe alternative using graham crackers instead of nuts.  I added mini-marshmellows, so it turned out like a s'more bar, YUM.  The recipe calls for finely crushing the graham crackers, next time, I will only  crush them coarsely.

Disclaimer: I did not make this exact recipe, but it is very similar to one I make regularly called Chocolate Chews. But mine are more like brownies because it is baked.  And I don't melt the chips.  Just mix 2 C crushed graham crackers with 1 C chocolate chips and 1 can condensed milk, pour in well greased 9x9, and bake at 325 for 30-35 min until golden brown.  Cool ~1 hour, cut & serve.  A Bachelor special - 3 ingredients.  No graininess, and delicious!

It was very easy, and turned out well!  However, I didn't love the grittiness the Graham crumbs gave it.  I would definitely make it again, because of how simple it was, but next time I'm going to skip the Graham's.
