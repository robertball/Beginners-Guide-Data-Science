GR8!! I DID LEAVE OUT THE NUTS AS MY GRANDSON IS ALLERGIC AND INSTEAD OF MELTING THE CARAMELS, SINCE WAS MAKING IN BITE SIZE I JUST UNWRAPPED AND DROPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FILLED CUPS THEN BAKED THE MINI MUFFIN SIZE 15 MIN. DON'T PUSH DOWN JUST PLACE ON TOP AND THE BROWNIES WILL DO THE REST!! IF U PUSH THEM THEY WILL LEAK THRU TO THE PAPER IF U DON'T THE CANDY IS JUST ENCAPSULATED AND MAKES FOR A NEAT, TASTY BITE SIZE SNACK!!

These are great!  Devil's Food cake mix can be subbed in for the German Chocolate.

I'm not sure about several things with this recipe. First is the unusual pan size of 8x10. I used the more common 8x11. I assumed that the butter was to be melted since the recipe doesn't say. German chocolate cake mix isn't as chocolaty so next time I would use chocolate. That brings me to my next point. Why use cake mix at all? Seems like this idea would look with brownie mix. I'll try that next time making it according the box directions, using 1/2 the mixture baked for a short time and then following the remainder of this recipe for the caramel and chocolate chip layer. While these brownies tasted yummy I had to bake the first layer 8 minutes then add "20" more minutes on top of the 18. The edges were obviously more done than the middle but they weren't burnt and were slightly chewy for those who prefer that over gooey. There is nothing wrong with this recipe I just think it can be improved upon.

I made these for church and everybody loved them.  My husband was in love with them but I did have a hard time getting them all the way out of the pan.  I think I let them cool for to long in the pan.  I'll try to get them out sooner next time.

I followed all the directions but must have messed something up making these because the middle was almost flat and all the carmel went to the bottom.  They were good and rich and gooey but a little too much work (especially all the caramel unwrapping)for the result.  There are other brownie recipes that are just as good and easier.

These brownies were underdone ~ one may need to leave it in the oven longer than 18 minutes.  I tried recooking when I realized it was not done but ended up making a mess.  I still will retry this recipe ~ maybe next time it will turn out better.

This recipe isn't the quickest in the world, but it may be the BEST brownie recipe in existence. I have made it for friends, and now when we get together for food, I have many requests for these brownies. They are GREAT!

Very good. Had trouble spreading the batter though. I put it in the oven both times for a few minutes, took out to spread while warm, then finished the cooking process.

These did not turn out at all. What a mess! I tried to make them like the photo - in cupcakes - total fail. I have never in my life had such a baking fail before.
