I made these pretty much following the receipt exact. The only change I made was adding some almond flakes along with the peanuts. They taste pretty good however I felt like the pan size should have maybe been a little smaller to allow a thicker granola bar. It was also pretty crumbly and didn't hold its shape overly well. I would probably make them again though with just the smaller pan and hopefully being thicker with a slightly longer cook time would allow them to hold together better.
