I made three small changes: I used half brown/half white sugars in the actual cake recipe, I used a bag of Hershey's chocolate/peanut butter chips and a half bag of Hershey's semi sweet chunks and I used pecans instead of walnuts. I made no other changes or substitutions. This was very easy to assemble, the directions absolutely outlined the steps clearly which was great because I made this dessert with my two boys. Just over 45 minutes was just right for me. It's cooling now but I'll update my review once my family as a chance to taste-test it. As it sits, it is a very pretty dessert. It looks like a chocolate chip cookie in cake form! NOTE: 45 minutes was WAY too long! DO NOT overbake, it becomes dry as heck. Because of my mistake, this turned out less than great. We ended up cutting away the edges and eating the middle, which was pretty freaking tasty. I was more upset that half of this got tossed as I hate waste. I'll make this again because it's really freaking good but I'll cut back on the baking time.

This cake was so addictive. I followed the recipe exactly, but looking back I think I will take the suggestions of using mini morsels. The regular morsels seemed to weigh the cake down. Overall though, really moist and delicious cake!

A little too much chocolate for me. I reduced to 1 1/2 cups in the cake and about 1/2 cup in the topping. Using mini morsels is good here too. Makes for a little lighter version. More cake.

I'm glad I waited a couple days to rate this recipe - it definitely improves with time!  The flavors really richen.  Next time I'll double (or close to) the topping.

Very yummy! It tastes just like a cake version of a Toll House cookie. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and only added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the topping and 1 1/2 cups in the batter. It was just right. If I had followed the recipe exactly, it definitely would've been chocolate overkill. This recipe is a keeper :-)

This recipe is similar to a recipe that I make. If you love chocolate then you'll love this cake. My family said to cut back on the chocolate chips next time and I agreed. Also, they prefer the cinnamon and sugar topping then the crumb topping. The cake does come out very moist.

This was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly minus the nuts (my kids don't like them).  Like a really good chocolate chip cookie brownie!  I will definately make this again.

Yum!! This DOES taste like a cookie in cake form!  I had about a quarter of a bag of Mini chocolate chips, so just used that up.  (Didn't measure).   I should've doubled the topping, but was still great with the regular amount. Was done faster than expected - about 35 minutes.  Kids went absolutely wild for this, so will be making again.

Holy cow, awesome. I used chocolate chunks & pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference) & it's like cookie dough in cake form. For me, that's a win! Ooozing chocolate, yummie cake, highly recommend!!

Mmmmmm...this smells so good while it is baking! Everyone made their way to the kitchen during baking time to ask what the yummy smell was! I did not wait for it to cool before cutting...I just couldn't do it. It's delicious warm with a sprinkling of powdered sugar. Next time I'll do like others and double the topping...minus the nuts. I left those out. Really good! Will definitely make again!

This tastes great!! I didn't put all the chips in the topping. It calls for 2 many. I also followed someone elseâ€™s suggestion and made extra topping. It worked well.

This is easy and wonderful!!  I used mini choc chips instead of the regular size.  I also was able to successfully double the recipe by cutting back on the baking powder and baking soda.

This was very tasty and I love that it is a 9x13 pan. I made the recipe as is. Some reviewers said to add more topping but I found the receipe as is was good enough. The first day, it was the consistency of a coffee cake, the second, after putting it in the refrigerator, more like a bar. And I do agree that I liked it better that way but either way it was very tasty. I mixed white, milk and dark reg chips. I made this a second time using applesauce in place of the sour cream and using whole wheat flour for the cake part (not the crumb mixture) as suggested by another reviewer and liked it better than the first time. I liked the second version as a 5 and the 1st as a 4.

This is an awesome recipe! I took some earlier advise and doubled the topping but left the chocolate chips at 2 cups. I think it cuts back on the chocolate just enough. Overall very easy to make and yummy!

This turned out well.  It makes a large 13 x 9 pan of coffee cake so it would be good for a larger group or to bring into the office.

I found this to be just ok.  It needed more topping I think and maybe some of the topping mix in the middle.  It didn't go over well with my family.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it three times since October and everyone loves it.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I replaced the sour cream and half the butter(not in the crumb topping) with applesauce and used whole wheat flour.  I also doubled the crumb topping which really makes the cake delicious. The small adjustments were to help me feel better about eating 2/3rds of it!

This was good but I didn't think it was spectacular or anything. My husband liked it more than I did. I used mini chocolate chips as other reviewers suggested and I agree with previous reviews that the amount of choclate chips is a little excessive. You could probably get away with 1 1/3 cups of choclate chips in the topping and still have more than enough. I also agree that it's better the next day. I will make this again though. It's a nice change from a regular cake.

I just love this recipe! The cake is very moist and the topping is delicious. I also use the mini morsels and used a little less because they seem to go a long way.

I never thought these words would come from my mouth, but it was too much chocolate.  I even used less, only 1 1/2 cups on the topping.

I followed this recipe exactly. I used the milk/semi-sweet/white chocolate chip mix in the cake and regular semi sweet in the topping. I thought it was very good as is, and didnâ€™t need the mini chips. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d change anything next time. Well...maybe double the topping, that was everyoneâ€™s favorite part.

This was good, but didn't wow us.  The crumbly top layer is by far the best part.  My husband gave it a "6 of 10."  While we enjoyed it, I wouldn't make again.  I prefer the Toll House Pie recipe!

I left out 1 whole cup of chocolate chips & it was still waaaaaaay too chocolatey! VERY rich & almost too sweet. I cut all of the pieces in 1/2 & STILL couldn't even finish one! It's not a horrible dessert, just too much chocolate.

I doubled everything in the topping mixture but the chips (used minis). I only had granulated light brown sugar on hand and used that in the topping, it melted and gave the topping a delightful little crunch on top. I don't think I would bother even trying the brown sugar this was so good. Delicious!!

GREAT CAKE!!  I loved it!  So easy to make, delicious, rave reviews for it too.  I will say that the 2 cups of chocolate chips for the topping is too much.  I will double the rest of the topping ingredients next time and throw in a good handful  of chocolate chips for the topping-maybe about 1/2 cup or so.  The topping is awesome, it does not come out like a streusel crumb topping, it actually bakes into the top of the cake giving the top a sweet, crisp exterior and gives it that chocolate chip cookie flavor.  Awesome!  UPDATE:  I have made this again and doubled the topping as I mentioned above . . . and have to say that I do not recommend doubling it-it was way too much that way-too sweet!  The original amount is perfect.

this was good, didn't need to cook as long as stated maybe 30-35 minutes, the crumb topping didn't even matter in my opinion maybe i should've doubled it but it just bakes right into it and you don't even notice it i think it should be added later not as soon as you put it in the oven, it is pretty good but definitely only need about 1/2 cup in topping or none at all, and 1 cup in cake mix

Really good and even better the next day.  The dough is soooo good too -- tastes somewhere in the middle of cake mix and cookie dough.

We liked this but boy is it ever sweet and chocolately.  And that was even with cutting the chocolate on the topping down to once cup.  I took other's recommendations and used mini morsels for in the cake, but used regular ones for on top.  I used the 1-1/2 cups mini morsels for inside the cake, which seemed just right.  I think we might have liked it better with just a crumble top and no chocolate mixed in the topping, and that's coming from someone who is a major choco-holic.  Overall, very good, but makes a lot and is very sweet.

I made this crumbcake for a church gathering and it was very well received.  As per the suggestions of other "raters," I basically doubled the ingredients used the crumb topping (excluding the chocolate chips - 2 cups for the crumb topping is plenty).  I also simply used a whole bag of chocolate chips for the cake portion of the recipe (it only resulted in maybe an additional 1/2 cup of chips being used).  Everyone loved it.  Many guests asked for the recipe which gave me the opportunity to brag about the "allrecipes.com" web site.  Delicious crumbcake that was very easy to make.  I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to make this again.

Very good! I halved the recipe to fit a 8x8 but kept the original amount of topping. I used mini morsels and decreased the amount for both the topping and the cake. I slowly poured in the choc. chips and mixed them in until it looked like a good amount. Because I halved the recipe, I baked it at 350 for about 36 mins. It came out perfect.

I made this with mini morsels- 1 1/2 C for the topping & 3/4 C for the cake. The cake was kind of dry & just ok. I won't make again. Sorry.

It was okay, but didn't receive outstanding reviews from the tasters. It's very moist and rich, but just not outstanding.

OOOOHHHH My Goodness!!!  This is absolutely wonderful!  I used milk chocolate chips in place of the semi-sweet, but this is one of the best cakes I have ever had.  I will definately make it again!!!
