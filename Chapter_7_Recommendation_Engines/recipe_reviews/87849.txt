I found this dish to be extremely delicious and my family loved it. I added more clams and garlic because we like it that way. I will definitely make this again! Thank you...

Really delicious, my 12 yr old son loved it...I doubled the garlic since i love garlic.  I also used only 3 tsp of the reduced sodium better than boulion chicken base instead of boullion cubes, I doubled the parsely, rduced the butter to 3/4 of a stick, added 1/4 cup of dry white wine with butter & clams at the end which I reduced the cooking time by 15 mins (7 1/2 mins off the beginning and end) and some crushed red pepper to taste.  Awesome!!!

Excellent, with just a few changes.  I doubled the garlic as well as added a whole dices small onion. In addition to the juice that came with the clams, I added a bottle of clam juice.  I also used whole wheat spaghetti. This is the second time I've done this to rave reviews by my family

The ingredients were amazing, I love baby bella mushrooms. Like one of the previous reviewers, I also added Broccoli which only made the dish better. My only complaint was the dish was too salty. I would omit one or two of the bullions if I were to make this again. With the garlic and the Worcestershire, there is plenty of flavor!

Just made this dish tonight!  My husband was looking for a dish similar to Olive Garden's Seafood Portifino......I did what others suggested only used 3 bouillon cubes.  I also added a small  onion and scallops (last step).  It was delicious! Thanks

This is excellent.  I left out the bullion cubes because I didn't want the sodium, and it was still absolutely wonderful.

I added broccoli florets toward the end and it was just what the dish needed. Next time, I may cut down on the butter a little, but it was overall a very good recipe.

I LOVE this recipe.  Better than what I've had in restaurants. Followed advise of another & reduced bouillon to 2 (cuz I'm not crazy about salty stuff). Next time might add a clove or 2 more garlic.  This is a great recipe. Wonderful the next day.  Thanks a bunch!

Very good- I decreased butter by 1/2 and did 2 bullion cubes instead of 4. I will also only do 3 cans of clams next time as it was still a little on the salty side. Also, added a chopped onion when sauteing the mushrooms, 2 more cloves of garlic, some white wine at the end when I added the butter, and about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.

This recipe worked really well, I did tweek it a bit. I didn't add the boullion at all, I did add an onion and I chopped up some asparagus and added it just before the clam meat. Well worth the try and thank you for a recipe that I'll use again and again.

This was very good!  I omitted the mushrooms and the chicken bouillion and was very happy with the end results.  Next time, I think I'll double the recipe as well as the amount of garlic as we would have liked more sauce.  I was a little anxious about the Worcestershire sauce, but it definitely adds to the dish. Very tasty!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was really good but I found it way too salty.  Next time I'll do half the bouillon and I'm sure it'll still be salty enough.  I also don't think the 1/2 cup butter is necessary.  I just put a little butter in the pasta so it didn't stick but even that was not necessary so if you're looking to decrease the fat of this recipe omit the butter.  Great overall recipe.

I made this pretty much just as the recipe says except reducing the sodium as I am starting to get used to cooking low sodium. There is plenty in the clams and clam juice. I used unsalted butter and instead of bullion I used a quarter cup of chicken stock. I also added a third of a cup of heavy cream for texture. It was a very tasty meal that will make again.

Holy Hannah......can you say "salty"???????
I even followed other reviews and cut the bouillon cubes down to 3, but I'm thinking you could do away with them all together.
The idea itself was good, that's why I gave it three stars.

Absolutely delicious!  I used Oyster mushrooms, I didn't have any chicken bouillon or Worcestershire so I had to add a little extra of the other seasonings, plus a little pepper and some fresh lemon juice.  I only used 1 tbsp of butter, and that seemed to be plenty.  I also went a little extra further to fancy up the meal and served it with fresh homemade pasta.  Mmm, will definitely keep this recipe to make on a regular basis!

I am not the best cook and have always been intimidated by clam linguine because I thought would be a difficult dish to make. When I ran across this recipe and saw how easy it seemed, I decided to give it a try. I have now made it several times for several different people, changing absolutely nothing about the recipe as written. Everyone who has tried it RAVES about it and requests I make it again. I even love it, and I am definitely my own worst critic.

If I could, I would rate this higher than 5 stars!!!  I have never had a linguine with clam sauce taste this amazing.  I also cut down on the bullion and worcestershire sauce.

I left out the bouillon and worchestershire (just sounded WAY too salty to me), but added white wine to the clam juice and spiced up with roasted garlic and red pepper flakes.  Also added white wine to the sauce - delectable!  Oh yeah, and added broccoli per other reviews, very good!

Very salty. I would suggest omiting the buillion cubes and substitute for low sodium chicken stock. the overall taste of the mushrooms and clams was good, but over powered by the salt.

Would have been a five star but way too salty. I even cut the boullion down to 2. Next time Im going to use 2 boullions and use unsalted butter. I am going to cut down the butter by almost half. With those minor adjustments it will definitly be a five star. Thanx 4 the awesome recipe.

I was so excited about this dish. Clams AND Portobello on pasta?!? What's not yummy about that? Well, in my case, it was all the salt. And I *like* salt.

I suppose it could have been the clams that I bought from Trader Joe's, but the recipe make so much, I can't justify another go-round to find out. 

Edible. But definitely not a fave.

Very good, I didn't use chicken bouillon to salty. Did add a little red wine. Other than that it's a keeper.

One of the best thing I've made in a long time! Used stock instead of bouillon, added some yellow bell peppers and sliced onions to beef it up a bit. Slightly less butter, but the flavors are awesome!!! Kudos to the chef!

FYI, I used about half the amount of butter (and added a splash of white wine), and it was still delish! Probably slightly less so than the original, but got great reviews all the same! I also used dried parsley (because I was too lazy to go to the store), white wine worchestershire instead of regular, and medium-sized bellas, roughly chopped. Will make again!

Delicious...just added 1/2 of white wine to the liquid and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to give it an extra zing.

Very good! I was very cautious with the chicken broth, just added a little at a time. Also added some Chardonnay, which added so much flavor! Was loved by all!

This is a very good, flavorful recipe. I made it with a few changes, and I think everyone should definitely be aware of the salt and fat content. I used two cans of clams rather than four, added a cup of chicken broth and left out the bouillon, and I still found it to be plenty salty (the canned clams contain quite a bit of salt). I also used about a third of the butter called for and mixed a couple teaspoons of flour into the broth to thicken it.

the flavor is really good but I agree with the previous posters that it is a bit salty. Next time I would cut down on the bullion (even though I use Knorr, which tastes less salty than some of the other cheap brands). For this batch that I made as per the directions...I added 1cup of homemade chicken broth (which is unsalted) . (I made half a batch for small family here..for a whole batch that would be 2 cups). The other posters adding a splash of white wine just sounded good so I did that too! Really though...the salt thing is my only complaint.

Too much salt in this recipe.  I love linguine with clam sauce and have made a similar recipe for years.  I use at least twice as much garlic and only 2 cans of chopped clams and juice, leave out the bullion cubes and worchester sauce.  The mushrooms are a great addition!

While the consistency and flavor were good the recipe is much too salty. I will replace the chicken bouillon with chicken broth the next time that I make it.

Wow! Omitted the mushrooms because neither me nor my wife like them. Followed the rest of the recipe to the T and it came out AWESOME!! Restaurant quality meal. Crusty garlic bread, a side salad and a nice glass of white makes this an incredible meal.

Deeeelish!!! I would totally make this again. My husband said it's "restaurant quality". I added 1 less boullion cube and it was perfect! I also did not chop the sliced mushrooms because we love mushrooms and I wanted them to be bigger. It may not be the healthiest meal, but it was a treat and well worth it.

If u use the chicken "paste' instead of boullion the salty problem goes away. U can find the paste in most stores....keep in mind it needs to be refrigerated after opening.  I used MINOR'S paste and it made this dish delicious!

For me, this recipe is too salty and far too high in fat.  Baby portobello pair well with the clams.  I used two cans of baby clams, omitted the chicken bouillon and used water and splashes of white and left out the worcestershire sauce.  Since I had them on hand I used a large handfu of fresh parsley and upped the fresh basil too.  My rendition served 3 persons.  Everyone 's palate is different and mine didn't enjoy the given melange of ingredients.

My first review ever. This sounded so good and it probably can be but, 4 bouillon cubes along with the clams and the juice add up to way too much salt. We couldn’t even eat it.

This is a very good combo of ingredients. I had always made linguine with just the clams, but the portabello mushrooms are the perfect compliment to the clams. I used fresh baby bellas from my local supermarket, and thoroughly wash these ahead of time in water and baking soda, then spin dried in a salad spinner. I used snows bumble bee clams in clam juice. The addition of Worcestershire and chicken bouillon is sheer genius! The only other ingredients I added that are not in the recipe were a bit of lemon juice, and a small amount of cooking sherry. I used dried oregano, and parsley. Linguine is the only pasta suitable for this dish IMHO. A generous sprinkling of parmesan and black pepper for the finale.

After reading the recipe, it didn't excite me very much, but II made this recipe exactly as it states and it turned out absolutely delicious!  I really dislike when people rate a recipe after they've modified it because it doesn't provide a true rating.  It had a fabulous flavor and I would even rate it restaurant quality.  I will definitely be making this dish again because it is a keeper!

Thank you, Mountainrider! I am not a pasta fan, nor do I know much about clams, but your recipe is such a fantastic balance that I couldn't stop eating. It is inexpensive and easy and will definitely go to the top of my "company dinners" list. I did cut the butter in half after reading other reviews, and needed to cut some of the bouillon because of the sodium. Still, the flavor was fantastic!!! I've been cooking for over 50 years, and it's nice to know that there are still some surprises out there.

Been making clam sauce for years, but never used mushrooms before and this takes it over the top!  Did sub coconut oil for the olive oil, doubled the garlic used, and used low sodium chix boullion and some homemade chicken broth. No need for the 30 minute simmer, I just thickened with some corn starch and 1/2 and 1/2 added at the end and cooked for a few minutes before adding the clams.  Butter went on the spags after they were done cooking.

Amazing! I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand and my love of garlic. I made 2 servings but only used one can of clams (it's all I had), doubled the garlic, added some crushed red pepper to the garlic step and I substituted clam base for the chicken bouillion. I did not add the double garlic to the skillet until the mushrooms were almost done, then I added about 1/2 cup of white wine to make up for one less can of clam juice and reduced that by 1/2 before adding the next ingredients. Everything cooked way faster than the recipe says. I only cooked the last step with the butter and clams for a few minutes so the clams weren't overcooked. So good! I would be proud to serve this to guests :)
