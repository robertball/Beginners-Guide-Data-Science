My husband and I enjoyed this! I made just a couple of changes - used panko, as the only other bread crumbs I had on hand were seasoned, so I didn't want to use those. I also cut the red pepper flakes way back to suite (my) tastes. Very tasty dish, and one that hubs and I both agreed is a "do again".
