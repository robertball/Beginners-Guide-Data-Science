Directions are missing a final step. Commenters are saying too much oil and not crispy. While I did cut back on the oil (used 1/4 cup) you need to hit cancel/keep warm and after release of pressure put back on Brown or Sauté. I used Brown on my instapot. Then you cook it all down another 20 minutes or so.  All nice and crispy. I have a great pic if they let you post pics.

They were good.  You can't really go wrong with these ingredients.  Mine were certainly NOT crispy!  I'm not sure how anything that is actually steamed, would stay crispy.  They were tender and had a nice flavor.

I was excited about this one. But will never make again. Flavors are ok,  but I feel description should be changed as it's quite misleading. These are not crispy at all (a little mushy, in fact). and almost all of the reviews  (as of this one) note "not crispy". One reviewer said she was able to get them crispy adding another saute onto receipe, at the end. But my potatoes were so tender form previous steps that they just began turning to mush upon trying. (another reviewer used the oven as an additional step - but then what's the point of the instant pot, since oven was my previous method, and by the time you saute, pressurize, cook , and depressurize - then transfer to oven and roast - you haven't  really saved time over oven. So - sorry to say , this is a total no-go for me.

You'll never get crispy in an Instant Pot but you can in an air fryer. In the IP, after cooking put the potatoes in the oven at 450 for about 10 minutes for more crispiness.

Gave 5 stars for great flavor.  I cut back on the salt (personal preference). They weren't crispy but we loved them.  Will cook again with peeling on.

Please, explain a few things to me. Pretty please. : I have an Instant Pot Ultra and some of the directions here confuse me so much. 
>  I can't allow for a specific time for pressure to build. I have no control over it.  It does so automatically.
>    Again, on Ultra, at least, if I do a quick release, I can't time it.  It releases until the float valve goes down... I don't get it.

I made these and they’re good, but didn’t stay crispy outside, even ones that are super brown. 

And the recipe says to peel, but the ones pictured aren’t peeled

I didn't make any changes to this but I will the next time, I forgot to hit the Quick release so they were pretty mushy, next time I will hit the QR and I will use Yukon Gold and transfer to a pan in a hot oven to "dry" them out a bit.

While the taste was great, they were FAR FROM CRISPY.  At first, I thought I had gotten the amount of oil wrong; nope, it was correct, then I checked the amount of water; same thing, nope.

What saved this recipe was to put them under the broiler on low for 30 minutes and even then, they could have gone an hour.  At least they were creamy on the inside and that was awesome.

Very good recipe and simple to make.  Agree with rest of comments that it will not produce crispy potatoes but knowing this ahead of time, I cut back the oil a small amount and cut the broth in half.  preheated the oven to 350 and put the potatoes immediately in the oven to dry out.  While still a bit mushy, they were a bit crispy and tasted great!

Agree with the other reviews, and even after following the “cook down on sauté for up to 20 minutes”, they are still VERY mushy. Plus, note the pot is going to be hard to clean. Good flavor, nonetheless. Probably will favor a less mushy recipe in the future.

I had my doubts about how you end up with anything roasted when you are adding this much liquid.  I was right.  The looked great before I added the liquid but the result is mushy.  I may try it again and drastically reduce the amount of liquid and for my personal preference change the flavourings.

The instructions say peel and cut into wedges.  But the picture shows whole potatoes.  I have not made yet.

Seasoning was excellent!  I was in a hurry so I didn't do the sauteing or use the oil.  Would make again!

Flavor was good.  Mine came out like smashed potatoes. Cooking time may have been a little off.

I did not have Thyme or Rosemary so I left them out and they were delicious! My 11 year old loved them as well! We will be making them again!

I used chicken broth & fresh garlic. The potatoes had a great flavor, but definitely not roasted.  For a steamed potato recipe, I give the dish 4 stars (too much oil).  However, I was wanting to reproduce the roasted potato flavor without using my oven.
