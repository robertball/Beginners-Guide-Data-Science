This was pretty high in fat, so I did everything I could to lighten it, and it was successful.  I used Egg Beaters, Splenda Sugar Blend, and substituted half of the oil with applesauce.  Even with these modifications, this bread came out melt-in-your-mouth moist and flavorful.  I don't mind raspberry seeds (now blackberries, that's a different issue), so I didn't sieve them.  I wanted to have some chunks of raspberries in the bread, so I just lightly mashed them and added them along with the flour.  I was concerned that if I beat the raspberries with the mixer, it would totally pulverize them.  Thicknik, my apologies for the changes, since I don't usually do that the first time through.  I had an idea of what I wanted, and this still is a delicious bread.  For others who are watching their diet as I am these days, this will give them an option.  Either the way it's written or the way I prepared it, it's still a winner.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! Also translates perfectly into muffins, just bake for about 30 min. I only had sweetened raspberries on hand, so I used a bit less sugar. I didn't have any lemon extract--vanilla worked just fine. Folding the raspberries into the batter at the very end gave me the bigger berry chunks I wanted.

I didn't like how fattening and sugary this was, so I made a few changes. I used 3 bananas instead of 1 and completely omitted the sugar. Instead of the oil, I used apple sauce. I don't mind raspberry seeds so I didn't run the purée through a sieve. It turned out really good, even my picky 2 year old likes it!

This was a very moist loaf.  I did not bother to strain the berries.  Yes you get the crunch from the seeds but I wanted clumps of berries.

I decided to make this recipe into muffins to take to work! I used fresh raspberries (I had got a ton for a great deal and needed to use them) and I eyeballed the spices. I tinkered with the recipe slightly. Since I had so many  fresh raspberries, I used like 1 1/2 c. and just mashed them up. I didn't have any lemon extract or real lemon juice on hand so I just used like a tablespoon or so of orange juice. I used 1/3 c. oil and a splash of ginger ale (I had opened a can and figured why the hell not!) THESE WERE AMAZING! The perfect breakfast muffin! They have my house smelling so good. They're light, pretty pink, and very berry-ful!

A big hit! Made a double batch and it disappeared! I even added a half cup of white chocolate chips that had been sitting around and tempting me!  Will make again and again!!!

I wanted a slightly healthier version so I shared equal parts milled wheat with white flour and added a half a tablespoon of flax seed meal. I also didn't have lemon extract so used vanilla, as per a reviewer's suggestion. I wish I had applesauce on hand to half the oil's place because that's just so much oil. Regardless of the kind of oil used, it really adds hundreds of thousands of calories for the whole batch. I used fresh raspberries so put in a cup instead of three-fourths. Everything else was the same and they came out so well. Really yummy, but not too distinct. I would definitely use this recipe again! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! The outside was crispy and the inside super moist. I may even cook it longer next time(I already had to cook for 1Hr 10 minutes)
This is such a versatile recipe can use blueberries, nuts, apple, chocolate chips.....

It’s good but has too much nutmeg, I would cut that in half or remove it altogether. I also didn’t bother removing the raspberry seeds, that seemed a bit excessive.

really good...I strained the frozen raspberries but didn't mash them. instead I folded them in at the very end(along with some chocolate chips :) I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  I substituted 1/2 coconut oil.  I actually made a double batch 1/2 in muffins and other 1/2 a loaf.  Muffins were better and they disappeared before I got a picture! I would make again.

I made this with raspberries from my back yard. It was delicious paired with well ripened bananas. Looking forward to this summers bloom of raspberries so I can make it again.

Very delicious cake! I made this recipe as is, but added freshly grated lemon peel instead of lemon extract. The texture of the cake was perfect.

Absolutely yummy! I actually made mine with less oil, less sugar and no lemon extract (didn't have any at home) and I must say that it was delicious so I can imagine what the full recipe will taste like. Thanks for sharing

Great recipe! Used fresh raspberries and added chocolate chips.  Moist and delicious! I didn't have nutmeg or lemon so I just added extra cinnamon and some vanilla extract.  
Very versatile base recipe that can be changed and made your own!

I thought the flavor was lacking, both the raspberry and banana were barely noticeable. I'm not sure if this is due to the small amount of each or if the two just cancel each other out.

I would not smash the raspberries, I like the whole or partial berry rather just bits. I also did not remove the seeds.

I followed the recipe pretty faithfully. My soft bananas were VERY small, so I used two, but that was no more than one normal big banana by volume. I figured a little bit more of the fruit, if any, would just boost moistness. That is my criteria for any fruit bread - very moist interior. I did see a review that the nutmeg was expendable so I do admit I skipped it. I actually only enjoy nutmeg mostly in hot cereal or egg custard. Otherwise not so much.

I made this for my Dad’s birthday cake. The only changes were using half the oil replacing the other half with applesauce and adding a tsp of vanilla. I laid the whole fresh raspberries on a first layer of batter then poured in the rest. It was delicious with cream cheese icing and raspberry syrup swirl. I will add even more whole raspberries next time. My Dad loved it saying many times “this is excellent!”

I had to change this to blueberries and strawberries because that is what I had.  it was delicious.  raspberries are my favorite, I can't wait to make it with them.  I used fresh not frozen and no walnuts (yuk).  this was a sit and eat the whole thing in one setting bread!

I followed the advice of someone in the reviews who did 3 bananas instead of just 1, omitted the sugar completely, and used applesauce instead of oil. Turned out great!

I followed the recipe using fresh raspberries. It was ok, but very heavy and oily. I think people are mistaking moist with oily. I will not make again

I made this awesome quick bread twice, and it is the bomb.com!!!  I used brown sugar instead of white and added vanilla in addition to the lemon extract.  The first time  I made it, the fresh raspberries ended up being  completely blended into the bread.  The second time, I lightly chopped the raspberries and folded them into the batter just prior to popping it into the oven.  The finished bread had the perfect texture with  yummy pieces of raspberries throughout.  Instead of a loaf pan, I used a small 8"x3" cake pan, which worked out great.  It was so delicious and is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

Moist and tasty.  I made it with less sugar and oil and didn't puree the raspberries.  Still sweet enough and moist. I prefer the crunch & chunks of raspberries so I didn't puree the raspberries.  Excellent!

The texture and flavor came out very good. Since I can't have raspberries I substituted Craisins.

Yummy! One useful  tip I've discovered for quick breads...they cook much more evenly and quickly in a flat, shallow pan such as a cake or brownie pan. This cooked in 30 minutes for me in a standard quiche pan. That way, you don't have overcooked ends and a gummy center!
As to this recipe, I increased the banana to 2 and added a half cup of oats. I will make again!

This was not the most moist banana bread I've ever had, even with all of that oil. But it was not dry at all either. I will definitely try the applesauce replacement next time to make it healthier. The only thing I did differently this time was use freshly picked raspberries rather than frozen.

I used 2 T ground flaxseed and 6T water for substitution of 2 eggs, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for oil, Splenda in place of sugar and folded whole rasberrys into the flour/banana mixture. Too high of fat content with original recipe for me. Very good bread.

Great recipie! I used a Kitchen Aid mixer with the cookie dough beater. It did bring out more raspberry than banana flavor but it made the bread nice and fluffy. I didn't mind the seeds so I didn't use the sieve. I'll have to try the applesauce idea next time. Mom and I had to have seconds!

Great, easy recipe that is really quick to make Hough he next time I make it I'll leave out the lemon as it kind of masks the banana taste.
