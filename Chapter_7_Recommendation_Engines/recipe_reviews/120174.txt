This is a fabulous summer dessert recipe. Light, airy and delicious. The only changes I made was to add an extra can of whatever pie filling I am using at the time and I also use homemade whipped cream (much more rich and delicious). Wonderful!!

My mother made this recipe for at least 40 years.  It was a huge hit every where she took it and it was a favorite of our family.  You can use any kind of pie filling you want to change it up...blueberry, strawberry, pineapple...all are fantastic.  No one could ever believe there were crackers in the crust...it bakes up sooo beautifully.

Will make again.  Very nice dessert, refreshing change.  I used sugar free cool whip and added a teas. of vanilla extract to rid of store bought taste, may try coconut extract to the whip cream next time.  Cherries looked like they covered more on the picture here w/the recipe, mine didn't look as full/pretty, so next time may add an additional cup of whip cream and do one  and 1/2 can of cherries.  Thanks for the recipe.

Super-good!  The meringue/saltine crust was surprisingly delicious--it didn't taste at all like saltines.  The crackers gave the light and airy meringue just enough substance--it was really, really good, and tasted like less-dense version of shortbread. The only change I made was using regular cherry pie filling, and if anything, it was a tad too sweet for my tastes (everyone else in my house LOVED it)  Next time I will use sugar-free whip topping and try it with blueberry pie filling.

My sister-in-law used to make this, but it's been years since I've eaten it and I just wanted to try it again.  It's a light dessert with a good combination of textures and flavors.  The dessert can be easily changed with different toppings, and it's a pretty dessert.  I only had one can of cherry pie filling, and I would recommend using more since the distribution of cherries was a little sparse.
