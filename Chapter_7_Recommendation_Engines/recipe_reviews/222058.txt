This is a nice, healthy recipe that I like to have for breakfast sometimes. I've used regular milk, and I've also used almond milk which turns out really tasty. Instead of sugar I use stevia, and I add about 4 tsp of cocoa powder to make it a chocolate pudding. Berries go really well on top. PS- the more chia you add per amount of liquid, the thicker the pudding is/ the more the chia gells up.

Let this set overnight at most - if left longer it starts to take on a very strong grain taste and the texture goes from tapioca-like to frog egg-like.  It gives some variety to the chia menu I suppose.  However, if I make it again I'll make a half batch to avoid keeping it around too long.

I love this - I usually make it chocolate, and either use coconut sugar or a few tbsp of raw honey. Both are great!

I made a vegan twist on it and used coconut milk instead of milk, mashed bananas for added nutrients,  added very little brown sugar versus white, added toasted coconut flakes, added a dash of cinnamon and skipped the raisins. The best pudding I've ever tasted!!!

I actually made this from looking at a chocolate chia pudding but didn't have any cocoa. Here's how mine is a little different.  I made it just for 1 serving and used 1/2 cup original flavor almond milk, 2 T chia seeds, 1 packet domino/stevia blend sugar and a couple drops of vanilla and added a T. of golden raisins and a few pumpkin seeds.  I only let it set for about 20 minutes before eating.  I'll try overnite the next time.  I ate this for breakfast and it was very feeling and tasted very rich.  I'll have to get use to the consistency of tapioca though or blend it to see how that does.

Love It! I usually reduce the recipe down to 1 serving and make before bed for breakfast the next morning. I double the vanilla (only because I love vanilla)and use about 1 teaspoon maple syrup instead of sugar. I don't add the optional ingredients and enjoy the simple uncomplicated taste which reminds me of chilled oatmeal but with soft tiny crunchies. Sometimes I have a glob of chia seeds settle to the bottom which I have to stir well and break apart to create an even pudding-like consistency. If I use coconut milk I have better results and a much thicker pudding which too I love. Nice to have a recipe that isn't chocolate. Thanks nikkid!

This was DELICIOUS! I made it vegan and used vanilla soy milk instead of regular - therefore omitting the vanilla mentioned in the recipe. I didn't wait the written eight hours but instead just 4 'cause I was dying to try it! Yummmmmm!!!
However, I think the calorie count on this recipe is way off - should be 200 (minimum) per serving (still making 4 servings).

My husband is a firm believer of the "powers" of chia seeds so, I had some laying around and I tried this. To me, it needs more sugar and vanilla in it. I didn't have raisins so I added a few mini chocolate chips with the coconut. That helped a lot.

Chia Pudding Haiku: "I really like this. Daughter so-so, husband hates. Three and a half stars." I think this would've been better w/ almond, soy, or coconut milk for a bit sweeter flavor. I followed the recipe as written, reducing to 2 servings, and left it overnight - had a bowl this morning, mine w/ coconut and raisins, daughter's w/ mini chocolate chips, and husband's plain, and we all agree that we think it'd be better just a tad sweeter, or, in its current state, blended into a smoothie. We're not sugar-fiends, and we certainly appreciate the health benefits of chia seeds, but as written, we didn't all go "WOW!" I have a feeling what's left of it will be mine, mixed into a banana/chocolate protein powder smoothie later today, and I'll enjoy it even more. Thanks for a new way to enjoy chia seeds!

Delicious! I wondered as I made it if the amount of chia seeds was correct, as the other chia seed puddings I've made took a smaller amount which meant it took longer for the pudding to set up, but was worth waiting for, this sets up very quickly, I used an almond coconut blend, instead of sugar I added some homemade apple pie spice, and as I've done before I put the coconut flakes into the pudding mixture to give it more texture. I just made this about 30 minutes ago, it could be eaten now it's so thick, tastes good so far!

As most did, I tweaked the recipe. As I am lactose intolerant, I used unsweetened almond coconut milk. Added chopped walnuts to replace the raisins. I couldn't wait the 8 hours. Yum. I will use the entire 1/2 gal of milk and make more!

I tried it with sweetened condensed milk and  whole milk and omitted the sugar. It was bit sweet for my taste, but I think I may use less condensed milk.

I took Patti's advice and cut recipe in half. I still had more than enough. Can't believe that this is so good! Will definitely make it again.
