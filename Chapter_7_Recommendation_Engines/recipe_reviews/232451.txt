This was good, but I did add a lb of Italian sausage along with onions and garlic, which is just what I do to almost everything but ice cream. As I read in a novel once, I've never had a good meal that didn't start w/ chopping onions. Very picky son ate it for lunch several days. High praise indeed, or it just happened to include his favorite things. Whatever, he liked it. Oh, yeah, I didn't layer anything, just mixed it all together. Easier.

We go to a restaurant nearby for their spaghetti pie. I always wondered how to make it. I think this is it! It turned out great, but I think I'll add more sour cream next time.

I added ground beef and some black olives and a bag of Mexican blend cheese to the layers.

For me, another shape of pasta would work better than spaghetti.  I had to use fettuccine as it turned out I was out of spaghetti noodles.  Stirring the sour cream into the pasta seemed to work better than layering.  One jar of sauce wasn't enough - this really needs two jars or cut the pasta & sour cream in half.   With a few minor changes this makes a hearty family style meal.

We loved it.  I made it true to the recipe.  I used left over noodles. I warmed them in the microwave with the  butter on top. When the butter was melted I tossed the noodles until they were covered with butter. Then I put the parmesan cheese in and tossed again.  I used left over spaghetti sauce.  I successfully cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 9 by 9 pan.
