Excellent! Tastes like authentic Indian food!! Will be making it again!

Added Spinach and Broccoli, didn't have garam masala so we made this we found online that did the trick, doubled for the ~4 tablespoons needed by this recipe:

1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp crumbled bay leaves
1/8 tsp ground cloves 

The only complaint is that it didn't get thick like the picture (or at all), but it came out just fine.

Awesome!

 I doubled my spicing and added a pinch hing (traditional Indian spice).  I also used a can of diced tomatoes, as I didn't have any tomato paste on hand.  

Still turned out great!

This recipe was great! We did make a few changes though .... We used the same amt of coconut oil in place of peanut oil & vegan margerin, we used hemp milk over soy, and finally we used ground cashews to thicken the sauce (which worked great!). We will use this recipe again.

I made the sauce part as written with the addition of a cut up tomato. The spices were subtle but good. I found that it needed a touch of sweetness so I added about two teaspoons of agave syrup. That was just right. I made my own seitan from scratch. Because my seitan was firmer than store bought, I didn't bother with frying it. I just added it to the sauce and let it heat through. I thought the sauce was just the right consistency as is so I didn't add the cornstarch. This was not the best makhani I've ever had but it was pretty good and I'm sure I'll be making it again, with a few minor tweaks.

I make mine with Tomato Sauce, Lemon yogurt, Almond Milk, Peas & Carrots , Potatoes [ chopped very small ] ,Cilantro , Gara Masala , Curry, Turmeric, Cumin, Salt & Pepper to taste, Onions, Garlic. Supreme! One can add Soy Chicken strips . I am Vegan, so no meat is ever in my recipes. It is a very thick veggie sauce that I serve with Naan.

Nice and spicy. Make sure you have enough seitan, or else it will be too spicy.

I doubled the spices, because I like the stronger spice flavors. Because there was a lot of spices, it helped thicken the sauce, I also added the soy milk slowly while stirring to make sauce smooth. I subbed coconut oil for the peanut oil and margarine. I used tomato sauce instead of puree and it tasted just fine.  I didn't have the soupy texture like other reviewers, in fact I omitted the cornstarch because it was already super thick but did add water to even out the spices. The recipe was delicious, a great flavorful meal to complement any vegetarian or vegan diet. Definitely going to make again when I have more seitan.

This is a nice indian recipe. Tried it with Tofu and that worked out good. I doubled the spices (as people recommended it) because i like spicy food, but that made it way to spicy. It also made it quite chunky and thick. Will try again with normal amount of spices.
