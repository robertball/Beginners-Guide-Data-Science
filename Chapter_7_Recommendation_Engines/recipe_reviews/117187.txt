I made this because I'm living a low carb lifestyle and it sounded like a nice change from my usual omelets. I enjoyed the fact that there were a lot of veggies involved in this, but I just couldn't get over the odd taste of the sweetness mixed with the eggs. I think the textures threw me as well; the crunchy just didn't mix well with the soft. All in all not terrible but not worth the hassle. I won't be making this again.

I should have followed my instincts and not used the honey.  This was way too sweet which didn't blend well with the vegetables and the eggs.

Delicious, healthy meal for breakfast or dinner! Very similar to a dish my friend from Libya used to make and eat with pita . Her version omitted the cheese, honey, carrots and celery and added chopped jalapenos and cinnamon. Either way, yummy.

I really liked this while my other half said it was good stew but did not think the eggs matched the stew. I halfed the reciepie and it was enough for 4 small eggs or 3 extra large.
