I browned these and then made the marinade, but did do a few things differently. I added fresh garlic and cooked it on the stove. I then thickened it with some water and corn starch.  I poured the sauce over the chops prior to baking them. They were delicious.

I was satisfied with the chops after they were cooked all the way. I had to cook them for 45 minutes instead of 20.

This was delightfully simple and amazingly delicious. thank you. I do not have an oven, so I browned the chops in butter first, then poured on the sauce and let it simmer for a while. Def making this one again. 
Served with mashed sweet potatoes, was a good side too.

I also had a hard time getting the chops done. It turned into 45 minutes and after they were finally done, they were dry and the taste seemed a little off. We won't try this one again even if we changed the recipe around.

This recipe was just average- nothing special. If you really like a sweet flavor with your meat, you might like it more.  It certainly wasn't terrible, but I probably won't make it again.

These were very good. I cooked the pork chops in the oven for 20 minutes and then on a skillet with the sauce  for 25 minutes cooking each side for 12 1/2 minutes.

I liked it ok. As one reviewer said, it wasn't anything to write home about. I may make again and use the idea of thickening the OJ solution. That would probably improve the recipe.

This was very good. I browned the chops first then added onion, garlic and cubed  potatoes. Poured the sauce into the pan and simmered for 25 min. Added bit of corn starch (in cold water) to thicken at the end.

It was great and simple. The only thing I did different was, I browned the chops first. Plus, I left it in the oven for 30 minutes.

I made this in the slow cooker and the pork chops came out so tender.  I added one garlic clove (minced) and a sliced  onion for extra flavour. Delicious!

Never thought I would go for something sweet with pork chops, but this sauce was not over powering and was delicious. I am new to cooking and the recipe was very simple and easy to follow. 

Would advise using boneless pork chops. I used bone in, and while still delicious, it was something I would do differently.

These were easy to make but took about 40 minutes to reach 145 degrees. A little too sweet for me.

Higher altitude causes things to cook slower...but still very tasty!

We did not like this recipe. It was not very tasty and I was not a fan of how it was cooked.  I followed the recipe step by step (not hard) but this was thumbs down, sorry!

I used pineapple juice and did not have dijon so used "sweet and spicy mustard" and my chops were pretty thick so I baked them 35 minutes.  Very yummy!  I will make these again :)

We loved it! I've never bothered to write a review before, but this was worth it. Very tasty and very easy! You may want to be in the mood for something a little sweet though. Will definitely make again - probably whenever I have pork.
