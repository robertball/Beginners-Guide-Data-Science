This was a good recipe, but didn't call for any vanilla or anything (That's why I gave 4 stars).  I added 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract & 1 tsp of almond extract. IT WAS GREAT!!!

EXCELLENT pound cake!  Everyone loved this and it sure disappeared fast.  I did add 2 tsp of vanilla.  Served with fresh berries and whipped cream on the 4th of July and it was great.  Thanks for the recipe : )

I baked this pound cake for the first time in my life and it came out beautifully.  I baked a second one and it tasted even better.  This is a wonderful recipe.  I made sure the eggs, butter and cream cheese were at room temperature before mixing. Great recipe!

I make a Sour Cream Pound Cake that is "The Best"...This one rates with my recipe but is so much easier!!  Most great "Pound Cakes" do not need flavoring added.  I guess just to change the flavor it is to your taste.

Classic, reliable, tried and true pound cake recipe. Unfortunately, in my view, the submitter made it her own by not including any flavoring, and I think this cake would suffer some without it.  It also makes all the difference in the world to use butter, not margarine!   I added a teaspoon each of vanilla and almond extracts, although any variety of extracts could be experimented with. This is also awesome baked as cupcakes.

I followed other reviews and made sure that my eggs, butter and cream cheese were at room temperature before beginning.  This also makes it easier to mix. I did add vanilla to mine as well, but I like really sweet desserts so it's definitely a personal preference.  The first time I made this (as a test batch) I halved the amounts and it was just enough for one loaf pan. The next two times I made it I made the whole batch and it was enough batter to fill *3* disposable aluminum loaf pans each time.  I baked 3 loaf pans at a time for 50 minutes on the bottom rack, and then I moved them to the top for another 10 minutes, so the tops and sides would nicely brown. This helped them keep their nice rounded shape when they cooled.  Another tip: Tap the pans on the counter a few times before baking. This will help any air pockets to surface, and lessen the chance that your cakes will fall (which they will also do if you don't bake long enough.)  Thank you very much for a fantastic recipe. It's so user friendly and so amazing that it's the main piece in all my Christmas food baskets this year!

I baked the cake as the recipe stated however, the cake fell and the top came off when I inverted it. Also, the top 1" was still uncooked. The bottom portion that was cooked had good flavor. I need to either cook longer or raise the temperature.

Good recipe I guess (not very experienced with baking and I haven't had many pound cakes before so not sure what it should taste like). I didn't have white sugar and I used brown so the cake turned a darker color but that's kind of nice. I expected the brown sugar would add a pleasant flavor so I didn't add vanilla as some of the other comments suggested but it turned out a little plain. Also, my eggs were right out of the fridge so the mixture curdled as I added them. I didn't know ALL ingredients were supposed to be room temperature. Maybe as a result of the curdling, the cake was less fluffy than I wished. The crust was nice and crispy, though, and overall it was quite good. AND, my boyfriend loved it!
I'm adding this some time after the preivous part. After the cake sat for a day or two, it tasted a lot better! I gave it four stars before but I changed my mind and fixed the rating to five stars! This cake deserves the highest rating!

This is wonderful. An anusual velvety consistancy. I added vanilla and 1 tsp lemon zest per recommendations. Since I wanted to try it first, I made only half the amount, just enough for a loaf pan.

This was a very good basic recipe and I added Lemon zest and lemon flavoring to this and it was great. I like it warm. I plan to try different flavorings.

This is an awesome recipe. I have used it several times and it was a big hit with my family/friends. However for the up coming Holidays I will add the vanilla and see if it makes a difference.

Before making this cake, I read the article regarding making pound cakes.  The advice was helpful to me.  I sifted the dry ingredients together.  I creamed the sugar, butter, & cream cheese for about 7 minutes before adding the eggs.  I beat well after each egg was added.  After pouring the batter in the tube pan, I tapped it against the counter top to remove any air bubbles.  This produced an excellent pound cake that had a crunchy exterior and a velvety interior.

This recipe makes a very good cake. However, as stated by other reviewers, I also added vanilla and almond essences to give the cake some oomph.

This is a delicious pouncake with a great texture.  I have made it a few times and my favorite included one teaspoon each of vanilla and almond extracts.  Be sure not to overbake for maximum moistness.  Check for doneness after the 1hr. and 10 min.

I make this recipe all the time.   Like many others, I add flavoring.  3 teaspoons of vanilla, 2 teaspoons of Lemon extract, and 1 teaspoon of almond extract.  I also make a glaze using vanilla, lemon extract, 1/4 milk and 2 cups of powdered sugar.  This is a fantastic cake.  The flavor and texture are very smooth.  It will remain fresh in a bread box for over a week.  Each time I make it my family gobble it up.   The batter is enough for either 1 bundt pan or two loaf pans.

This pound cake is the best!  Thank you so much for sharing this! I make this often with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  I also make it whenever we are having company or need to take to a party.  I love the somewhat crunchy outside but moist yet firm inside.  Really fabulous!

I’ve been making this cake for years and it’s always asked for and gobbled up! I was surprised to see no vanilla listed, I use 1 ½ teaspoon vanilla, NO baking powder and a pinch of salt. The secret to making sure this cake turns out perfect is 1) make sure you don’t overcook it! 2) Make it 2 days in advance! 3) Cook it in a TUBE pan, this allowes the cake to form a buttery crust!You won’t need any icing if you do this! You won’t be sorry but you will have a hard time keeping your hands off! Also if you have any leftover take a slice and cook in a buttered fry pan, just LIGHTLY browning on both sides. It will add a nice warm caramelized crust..yum!

Yum!  I used soy cream cheese and added 2 tablespoons double strength, powdered, vanilla extract.  I also used caster sugar, not granulated.  I brushed the cake with 1/4 cup bourbon mixed with 1 tablespoon corn syrup then frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting with Brown Butter and Bourbon (you must try this frosting!) and refrigerated overnight for the flavors to mellow.  DELICIOUS!!!!

I agree that it is really sweet but good with milk. I added vanilla just because everything should have vanilla. I havent tried it next day yet since I made it today but cant wait. We swirled leftover Nutella thru it just for pretty factor. Dont have a bundt pan so I made it in a bread pan. It tool almost 2.5 hours to cook but soooo good. I just watched it while I made Catherine's Spicey Chicken soup. Awsome!

It's yummy. But I didn't follow the recipe by adding 3 cups sugar but cut half off.  3 cups could be too sweet that ruins my taste bud and it's bad for health too.

I reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups and add vanilla and almond extract. I've also tried it with cake flour, which produced a finer texture. Great pound cake!

very easy recipe and good results.  Good firm texture - as a pound cake should be.  I had only half the amount of cream cheese required so I halved the recipe.  However, keeping in mind what another reviewer said about it making a lot, I actually ended up with 2 nice-sized loaves.  One to eat now and one for the freezer;-) When I make this again, I'll make the full recipe but will make loaves rather than use the tube pan.  I drizzled a light icing over the cakes.

excellent recipe and very versatile.  A lot of pound cakes do not have any baking powder and I prefer this one with a little.  Definitely use butter (absolutely no substitutes) and beat well and noone should have a problem. Thanks for a great submission.

My family loved it. I also added vanilla. I used 5 eggs, only because I only had 5 eggs in fridge. I had to give this a four star because the top was not as moist, but hard. I had to cover it was foil and a towel while cooling to ensure a softer top. Topped each piece with warm berries and icing sugar. Will make it for my church group next week.

this is excellent, but it loses a star for not including 1 tsp of salt and maybe 2 tablespoons vanilla. i used italian cream cheese (mascarpone from trader joe's) instead of philly cream cheese and it came out amazing. the outside has a bit of a sugar cookie taste to the cake crust. the inside is dense and perfect for strawberry shortcake or some kind of sugar rum sauce.

Makes an amazing cake!!  I baked it in 9" round pans so that I could use it as a layered birthday cake.  Baked them for 35minutes at 325 degrees.

Absolutely awesome...and so EASY!  Followed recipe exactly as written but added 1 tsp almond extract and 1.5 tsp vanilla.  Glazed with 1/8 c orange juice 1/8 c lemon juice and 1.5 c powdered sugar.  Excellent!

The picture shows the cake done in a bundt pan, but the recipe calls for a 10 in. tube/loaf pan. This is not correct. It overflowed--even with not using all the batter--and did not cook evenly at all. Use a bundt pan versus a loaf pan.

Yummy!  The texture and taste are out of this world!!  Please please PLEASE do not add any flavorings to this before you try it the first time.  It is exactly perfect as is.  No need for lemon, or vanilla, almond  or any other extract.

I was not a fan of this pound cake. It wasn't near moist enough for me and I know I didn't over cook it. Flavor just wasn't that great either... and I even added a little vanilla extract.

Tasted like Sara Lee pound cake!  Delicious and firm and crusty on top as promised.  Very much like what Grandma makes!  Also, makes 3 foil loaf pans and not 2.  Had some spillage, but not a huge problem.  Will make this again.

Like most reviewers, I add vanilla extract and sometimes additional flavorings, depending on how I plan to use this cake.  Always, always add a little salt to a pound cake.  It brings out the flavor.  I use this recipe most often for a cinnamon twist pound cake, pouring half the batter in a Bundt pan, a layer of chopped pecans, brown sugar and cinnamon, followed by the remaining batter.  When cool, I drizzle with a glaze of confectioners sugar and fresh orange juice, sprinkled with chopped pecans.

I made this pound cake early this week and have already made another one.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of almond and dusted with powder sugar when cool.  My family just can't get enough of this cake.  It's great. Thanks for the recipe.

Is it Cheesecake? Is it a Pound Cake? Its both and one of the best cakes I have ever made. Like others I did add some vanilla into the mix. I served it with whipped cream and fresh cut fruits... very refreshing on a summer day. Its easy and will certainly make its way back onto our table. Thank you for posting this :)

Good thing I only made half a recipe or I'd eat waaay tooooo much of this delicious cake!!!  I made it according to directions and it turned out perfect flavor wise.  It did fall in the middle...maybe I didn't bake long enough?  It doesn't need any flavoring as the cream cheese makes for good flavor.  Tonight I shall serve with rhubbarb sauce and whip cream for the hard working men!  Are they in for a treat!

This cake was AMAZING!!! I made raspberry 'dressing' to go with it by combining three of those little containers of fresh raspberries, sugar and water and let it come to a boil and simmer for a while. I added the vanilla like others recommended, but if you are making a topping or serving this with ice cream, its not really necessary. The point is to have the contrast of the sweet and tart of the cream cheese...which is why it is best served with fruit in my opinion. But anyway, EVERYONE LOVED this cake and I will most definitely be baking it again. Thank you!!!

This was a really good recipe. I wanted lemon pound cake so I just added 2 tsp. of lemon extract. Came out really well and I liked that it was made in a bundt pan. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

I have been making pound cakes for years and always trying different recipes to find the perfect one.  I think this is it!!  The only change I made to the recipe is to add some vanilla (about 2 tsps -- honestly, I didn't measure, just poured some in).  The cream cheese makes all the difference (used Philadelphia--full fat--brand -- I do think it makes a difference!).  And, very fresh eggs.  I think that makes a difference too.  And, good flour.  High-quality ingredients are the key, in many cases.  This recipe was perfect, as written.  I also used the new Williams-Sonoma bundt pan with the sharp swirls that gave this cake a lot of surface crust.  This was really the best pound cake I've ever made!! Probably a combo of all fresh ingredients, the pan, and this awesome recipe.

Easy recipe and delicious product.  This is the best pound cake I have ever made.  I offered it with a Raspberry Sauce and Blueberry Sauce.  Both of which were recipes I found on allrecipes.com  A word of caution:  I made a personal mistake and assumed the recipe only made one loaf (the picture representing the recipe is of one loaf) so I doubled the recipe, which worked fine by the way.  I ended up with two loaves and a bundt.  All were fabulous though.

I added a tsp of vanilla since there was none in the recipe.  It has a great flavor but was rather dry, needs some type of sauce or liquid ( macerated fruit) to soak into it.  Am going to try to slice a piece, grill it then put some type of ice cream on top

This is my third time reviewing this recipe and I changed the rating from 4 to 5. It really is a delightful pound cake. I first tasted it after it came out of the oven and it had cooled a bit, and was turned off by the sweetness. This was my first time making pound cake. The flavour improved the next day (not as sweet), but by the third day it tasted unbelieveably delicious. Even my 17 month old can't get  enough of it! I made it with all margerine and used a low fat cream cheese (that's all I had at the time) and it still turned out moist and dense. I must agree with the other reviewers that by adding some vanilla extra it would enhance the flavour even though it still tasted good without it. This is a great recipe and I wonder how it would taste with fresh blueberries, a squirt of lemon juice and some zest from the lemon peel? Pretty darn good, I bet! This is a keeper and will make ahead 3 days before serving it to guests. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I bake this recipe using mini loaf and mini bundt pans to make single servings and freeze them for quick, easy desserts.. Just slice and add fresh strawberries or canned peaches with whip topping.

Tastes good. I baked them in small tunnels and it took about 25 min.  I thought they were a little dry so I decorated them with butter frosting. Next time I want to make creme cheese frosting...

I liked it well enough, but I did add vanilla.  I had enough batter for a second loaf, so I tried adding just 1/4 cup of buttermilk.  This and vanilla really boosted the flavor.

Excellent! I did, however, use two teaspoons of vanilla extract but I am sure this pound cake would have been perfect as is. My mother-in-law gave rave reviews, and she is a cook that is hard to please. I did lower the temp to 325 and baked for a little longer. Will be making this one for years to come.

I have made this cake so many times I can't even count anymore.  I do tweak a little each time I definately add 2tsp vanilla and sometimes I add lemon. Over all very good texture and so simple to make.

so far so good... i have this in the oven as i'm typing.  the batter was delicious so i expect nothing less from the cake. :)  i will be making this into a butter rum cake by using a butter rum glaze (i wanted to make a butter rum cake but the ones on this site weren't from scratch and that's what i was wanting). i'm using a bundt pan so i have left over batter that i will bake and leave plain so i can try as per the recipe as well as with modifications (for the glaze).

Great recipe - pretty much the same one included in multiple articles in Southern Living magazine over the years.  The last time I saw it listed there, they didn't require beating the batter after each addition of eggs - I tried it their way and it turned out the same as all the additional beating.  Save yourself some time and simply beat it all for 3-4 mins.  I only use this recipe !

I use 2 2/1 cups of sugar, which is plenty. Also, 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of almond extract. Make sure your eggs, butter and cream cheese are room temperature before you begin.  You will not be able to have just one slice!

I have made so many pound cakes That I thought there was no reason to continue the experiment.  This one caught my eye since some of the favorites with my crowd involve cream cheese.  This was a GREAT call!  With all the eggs, sugar and butter I knew this was going to turn into pure goodness.  This is now in my top 3 favorites.  The crust is delicious and just right.  I loved the dense texture that is so so moist.  Great recipe!

Quite tasty with homemade strawberry sauce. Improvised with fresh cheese (requeson) instead of cream cheese, added more baking powder, a tad of salt, 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of Splenda.

This cake was awesome! I've never made a pound cake before...I was very pleased with the outcome. Real butter makes all the difference in baked goods, so that's what I chose, and I added pure vanilla. Next time I plan to use a combination of pure vanilla & almond extracts. I sliced this cake, and layered with fresh blueberries, strawberries, vanilla pudding(off this site), and coolwhip in a trifle dish. Everyone said the best part was the cake! I will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing! ***Made a giant cupcake cake for my daughter's 1st birthday...I used this recipe, adding a bit of pure lemon extract. Turned out beautifully!

So easy and so yummy.  I had a packet of cream cheese that needed using up, so this was perfect - all the other ingredients were pretty standard and always in the pantry.  I made the recipe exactly as stated here - no changes needed at all.  I will be making this one again, for sure!

This is so delicious!! It was the first pound cake I have ever made, and I will say I need to hone my pound cake skills. I baked this just as directed in a bundt pan, but mine did not bake all the way in the center. That really worried me, but it ended up setting up by the next day when I served it. The taste was absolutely wonderful. No vanilla needed (and pound cakes aren't really supposed to have vanilla in them anyway)!! I will definately try this recipe again!!

I have made this cake a million times and yes it is a big hit!!  After reading your list of ingredients, I have to say adding the 1/2 tsp of baking powder is a bit much. And also, there isn't any flavoring added to your list of ingredients either.  I would imagine it to be pretty bland without some type of flavor.  I've made it with vanilla, almond, and lemon extract before and it turned out great with all three.

Wonderful. I added vanilla as other reviewers suggested, and baked in two round cake pans instead of a tube pan.

Amazing and easy! Definitely use 1 tsp vanilla when you blend sugar, butter, etc.

Followed recipe as directed but did add vanilla as others suggested.  Very blah and sort of dry for my taste. The flavor and moistness did seem to improve a little after a couple of days, but not enough that I would make again.  Was hard to judge when done due to denseness of cake and the hard crust that developed on top.  I sliced, wrapped and froze individual slices, then thaw for lunches.  Liked it best slightly warmed.

I follow the recipe but added 2 tsp of vanilla flavoring. I used a bundt pan but i guess I had too much of the mix. The cake  separated leaving a top ring that was very moist and the bottom portion of the cake was hard. This happen because the top of the cake still appeared wet. Great flavor. Will definitely make again but will buy a smaller loafer pan to pour the extra mix.

My husband wanted pound cake for his birthday.  I searched for a long time for a recipe and decided on this one.  It was perfect.  He loved it!  I topped it with the Brownie Frosting from this site as he wanted chocolate frosting.  That was also a good choice.

Pretty good but the cake will need either a glaze or fruit, maybe both.  I added vanilla to the mix.

This recipe is very easy and tasty.  The pound cake came out great.  I did add 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp lemon extract to give it some additional flavor.

This is a pretty good recipe and i'm not the best at baking a pound cake.The recipe turned out better than others i've tried. I used the margarine and it was fine it was surprisingly light and fluffy. I also added some orange zest and it was good. For me this one is a keeper.

The cream cheese flavor here is very subtle which makes it easy to incorporate add-ins. For this recipe I chose to add fresh blueberries. Very, very good!

Great recipe. I tried others but this one was great (with my added lemon extract). also added a lemon glaze (powdered sugar and lemon juice) to take it to the next level.

this recipe was just okay.  I am not sure if I would make it again but it was nice. 5 stars because I think people should try it before they just look at someone's review.  Give it a try plus some cakes have to set overnight and then it tasted really seasoned and good.
THE NEXT DAY RESULT: my intuition about this recipe and cake was true this cake has to set overnight.  WE love this cake and if you can make homemade cream cheese frosting & it will top off the cake.  MAKE THIS CAKE and wait til the next day to eat it and you will be able to taste every flavor in the cake!!! GREAT CAKE!!!!

This was so easy and so good! Nice and moist! Brought all the ingredients to room temp before starting and used a bundt pan. I wanted to have a dessert in the freezer that would be easy to take out the morning I'm entertaining and serve with ice cream and berries. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla.
