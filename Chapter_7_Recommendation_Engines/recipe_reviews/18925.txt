Someone rated this recipe quite low and made it quite clear that this isn't really cappuccino. Another person rated it low because they had trouble getting the mix to dissolve.  First, let me state that this is a great mix.  There are so many variations to suit any taste.  Who really cares if this is cappuccino or not? The real reason we love it is the taste which is wonderful.  And if you have "mud" in the bottom of your cup is you either didn't stir, use hot enough water/milk or you used too much mix.  I love this and so does 99.999% of the rest of us.
Thank you, Cindy!

My daughter and I love to make this for gifts. I like to use Splenda instead of sugar and I use only a 1/4 cup of the Splenda. We also like to use different flavors of the non-dairy creamer like french vanilla but any kind is great. We will find out what flavor everyone likes and custom make it for each person. Everyone that has gotten one loves them and has asked for more jars through out the year. Thanks Cindy

I thought this was delicious.  For Christmas I put the mix in little jelly jars and tied with raffia and added a pretty lable I made on the computer.  I added it to little gift boxes with biscotti and loaf of fresh bread (see Fabulous Homemade Bread).  Perfect for teachers! My sons teacher even called during the holiday break and asked for the recipe.

This makes a great gift and a real treat for yourself, too. I used 3/4 cup of espresso powder and halved the sugar since my creamer was vanilla flavored and the chocolate drink mix had sugar in it. It was purrrfect! I put it all together in my blender on "Liquefy". No trace of coffee granules. Thanks Cindy!

I made triple batches and bottled them as Christmas presents.  They were a big hit and I became absolutely hooked on this drink.  The nutmeg adds a punch to it that is pleasant but not overwhelming.  Very important: make sure to really get your instant coffee POWDERY or the granules eventually separate from the rest of the mix.  Inexpensive, easy, and delicious!

We make a variation of this that is extremely close and I love it! It's great on a cold winter morning, especially when you are feeling lazy and don't want to make real coffee or are running late. Also, if you don't like using coffee creamer (hydrogenated oils/trans-fats and all that), we substitute skim milk powder for it instead and it still tastes great. It's even better if you use a 'rich' or 'creamy' formulation of hot chocolate mix.

This is nasty and tastes nothing like cappucino.  The chocolate drink mix sinks to the bottom of the cup creating "mud."  I won't be making this again.

Oh so good!! I wanted to make this for Christmas to give as gifts, so I thought I would try it out early. I ground the coffee in my blender, then added everything else & mixed it together. It come out great, I made it with milk & with water. Both ways where good, the milk makes it more creamy. Great recipe, thanks, I'm sure everyone will enjoy it.

Delicious! I used regular fat free creamer but next time I might try a sugar free vanilla flavored as other reviewers have done. I used a bit more cinnamon, Splenda granular & used a hot chocolate mix sweetened with Splenda. It was great! I love coffee mixes & this is a keeper!

I used nonfat dry milk in place of the creamer, and added a tablespoon of instant espresso to make it more like coffee shop cappuccino.  It tastes fabulous, but if you add the espresso, you will probably want to use 2 tablespoons of mix per 6 oz. hot water.  We just had a severe ice storm in North Carolina and were without power for three days in temperatures dropping below 20; I'd just finished my first batch of this (intended for gifts), but we heated water on a camp stove and lived off of this stuff.  It's wonderful in the cold!

This was pretty good :-)Its cheaper than buying the GFIC name brands, and if you buy flavored powdered creamers, all the better!! French vanilla, vanilla caramel, hazelnut :-) I keep a few jars around (they stay fresh for a long time if you keep them in the freezer) thankyou!!!

This is very similar to the Fireside Coffee Recipe posted on Cremora's site.....  I like it MUCH better than the commercial brand sold under Fireside Coffee.

I have played with this recipe and added sugar free Cherry Jello to it and omited the cinnamon and nutmeg to get  a chocolate cherry coffee.  I'm sure you could do the same with other flavors

Ok---this is sooooo much cheaper than buying ready made in the super! I bought my powerded drink mix and creamer (used french vanilla) instead of plain, at Walmart, had rest on hand. Takes minutes to make. Tastes wonderful!! Except for the sugar calories i don't feel so guilty drinking this more often, as it's less expensive & you get 2 jars! Took 1 jar to work to share & ended up taking the jar home empty the same day--now they want more, & we have a vending cappuccino machine at work!! Nice gift for postal person & neighbors or the person behind counter at your favorite gas station who always tells you about gas prices going up BEFORE they change the sign!

I'm not a coffee drinker, but dont mind having a cappuccino or mocha here or there and know of lots who does so thought I'd try this out.  I dont have a food processor so I tried crushing it with a rolling pan as recommended, but was not able to get it crushed into a fine powder well.   Did best as I could for about 10 minutes of crushing, mixed ingredients together, tested it first, but was dissappointed in the results.  The instant coffee grains were floating in the drink and bottom of mug had clumps of coffee grains.  Not impressive or as "yummy as I expected".  I'm adding double the creamer and double the chocolate drink mix to it and will be borrowing someone's food processor so I can blend it smoother into fine powder and try it again since I have all these ingredents and dont want it to go to waste!  Advice for those without a food processor, go borrow one and forget about crushing it with the rolling pan!

I hate to say this, but this is NOT "cappuccino in a jar" ... it's not cappuccino, period.  It's just spiced coffee with chocolate.  The addition of spice and chocolate powder don't make plain coffee into cappuccino.  If you want it to be able to call it cappuccino, you'd have to use instant cappuccino instead of instant coffee.  Even then, it's a poor substitute for the real thing.

I made this for holiday gifts...it was very tasty!  The only changes I made:  I would add very little nutmeg (or none at all - but I don't really like the taste), and I added a little more powdered creamer (vanilla was a big hit!)

This is my second cup of morning coffee!  I have one cup of 'hi-test' to wake up and my 2nd is this recipe, which I make with decaf coffee crystals.  It's just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet-tooth in the afternoon and I find it filling, which keeps me from nibbling those extra calories.  I mix it in the food processor and it becomes very fine and well mixed.  Thanks for sharing you recipe!!

My sister and I made this recipe to give as christmas presents.  Of course we had to try it for ourselves first.  Wow what a great tasting cappuccino.  We made a lot of batches and ended up with 48 half-pint jars decorated with fabric and ribbon.  Thanks for this terrific recipe !!!

I put this in decorted jelly jars and gave it to my co-workers for Christmas.  It was a huge hit.  For my personal taste, I will add just a tiny bit less cinnamon and nutmeg next time.  I am going to try to make it with sugar-free hot chocolate mix and Splenda sugar substitute next time for my diabetic son and husband.

I was getting tired of instant coffee every morning (my little one broke my carafe) so I made a batch of this.  I used packaged cappucino mix rather than the chocolate powder to get a more authentic flavor.  I didn't have the cinnamon at the time I made this so I left it out, but will be sure and add it because I think it would make a difference.  I enjoyed this with the nutmeg, but feel it could be left out since the taste is very minimal.  Thanks for sharing.

This was super. I gave as christmas gifts last year. My sisters and co-workers loved the cappuccino. My one sister had me make it with decaf coffee so she could drink it at any time! I prefer to use fat free milk instead of water. Thank you for sharing this great recipe Cindy!!

Not bad.  I ran out of powdered creamer so I mixed it with some powdered milk.  It definitely needs the creamer.

What a great gift idea!  I loved the taste - I used Swiss Miss hot cocoa mix so I reduced the sugar and it was wonderful. Thanks!

So easy and delicious! I read all the reviews before making this. Don't use cocoa - I don't think that's what the author intended. Use a chocolate mix that mixes with water like hot chocolate mix. That's what I used and it turned out GREAT! I made 38 jars to give to my hubby's employees as gifts!

Loved it! Great for Christmas gifts. I'm putting them in a baggie, then placing in cute mugs. I put 1/2 hazlenut creamer, and half regular creamer. Very tasty.

This was excellent.  I liked the suggestion of blending the coffee so it is finer.  I tried it with skim milk powder instead of the creamer and decaffinated coffee and it tastes great.

Hmmm... this was difficult to rate. The chocolate drink mix (I used Nesquik) gave it a nice chocolate body, but overall it seemed kind of watery, and the spices were overpowering. I will probably make this again, though I will omit the nutmeg, and maybe add some powdered milk. I also ran it through a blender to get a nice homogenous texture. Thanks for the ideas, Cindy!

I liked this alot, but I used French Vanilla flavored creamer, and next time I will probably double the amount of creamer.  I used Nestle' Quik (the kind you had milk to) and I was wondering if I had used the kind that you just add water to, if I would have gotten a richer flavor.

This is WONDERFUL and I also add to the cup some of the flavored creamers out there after it's in the mug. Good with cinnamon and vanilla in it for something extra. Give it a try I can't recommend it highly enough. Jackie

I enjoyed this recipe, but I think of it as more of a hot chocolate mix. It has a good flavor. I used a chocolate flavored instant coffee for a richer flavor. Try it with the chocolate spoons recipe in this website. Then add a coffe cup and you have a nice, thoughtful gift. It's part of what my mother-in-law got for mother's day.

It was alittle strong on the chocolate side and not sweet enough, so I added another cup of sugar and creamer and it it was much better to my satisfaction.

Everyone loved the chocolate flavor and the great taste of the mix. We have used it for our bake sale and it sold out last year! Easy to double.

I used this for the first time during Christma and it has been a hit with all of my friends. I did add more sugar and I actually add cream to the drink when I make it.

I think I've finally found the answer to over-spending on fancy mixes at the store. For the cost of a little can I can now make a big jar. I used Ovaltine for the chocolate drink mix as it was on sale in a big jar. I used half powdered sugar and half granulated to help keep the powder light so it wouldn't settle out the heavier ingredients. These are going out as gifts this year and I plan to make an "extra-dark" mix for my father with extra coffee as he likes cappuccino but thinks its too sweet and creamy. This is a perfect recipe to replace the store brands.

I've made this the past 2 yr. for Christmas gifts to go along with the pumpkin bread I make.  My friends all want the recipe.  I use powdered sugar, powdered milk and cocoa instead of choc. drink mix.  It is very good.  I like the spice taste.

Made it as written and loved it!  5 stars.  Made it as written adding pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  Another 5 stars. Made it with no spices...another 5 stars!!!  Thanks so much for this 15 star mix.

This was the best tasting cappuccino I've ever had!  So very versatile also.  I used instant vanilla coffee, sugar caramel creamer and splenda.  Also used no sugar added chocolate mix and it tasted wonderful.  I LOVE anything sweet tasting and this fit the bill perfectly.  Better than any gourmet cappucino I've had and MUCH cheaper.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

Very tasty!  A little more chocolatey than what I would consider a cappuccino drink (not that that's a BAD thing!) but for an instant hot drink mix it's delicious.  Versatile in that you could use different flavored creamers.  Coffee grinder pulverized the instant coffee in about 5 seconds.  Great gift idea - and fast, too! Took longer to decorate the jars than it did to combine the ingredients!  Also makes a nice addition to a bake sale table - I made four and they were gone in 10 minutes.  Guess people get thirsty looking at all those cookies, breads and cakes!

The only changes I made to the recipe was increase the serving size to 22 so it would fill 2 Pint size jars.  The measurements are a little odd that way, but it fills the jars nicely.  I gave these as gifts this year and only spent $2.60 per jar!  What a thoughtful and inexpensive gift.  I hadn't had a chance to try it yet, but I've gotten plenty of good feed back from those who received them.  I'll be making these again next year.

I love making this as gifts! I made it for my father in law last year and I had the jar returned to me under a month with a lot of hints dropped that they wouldn't mind having it again. He wakes up so early that instant coffee is usually his only option, this saves him a little more time getting the creamer in and it tastes better. Its really nice! You can also customize it to suite specific individuals. For him I increase the coffee until it is much stronger, but for my mom I add more chocolate and my sister likes more creamer. Its really such a nice gift and easier to taste test and adjust than cookies in a jar. The only issue is - you cannot layer the ingredients, you need to mix well or they have to empty the whole thing and mix it themselves.

It's really good. It reminded me of Mexican Hot Chocolate with a touch of coffee flavor. I like it a lot, but it's not cappuccino.

Easy to make!  I made these as gifts and ended up having one extra for me.  I don't know what cappuccino should taste like but I wasn't thrilled by this alone.  Instead I found that adding a spoon or less of it to coffee gave it such a great flavor! Yum!!

Very good drink!  I did use my coffee grinder to make the coffee granules into a fine powder (super fast) which made for easier clean-up.  Made one cup to try and decided to add two more heaping tablespoons of the creamer (if measured, probably closer to 1/4 cup more).  I did use the french vanilla flavor of creamer and Nesquik chocolate powder.  Completely omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg because at places where you order coffee those are options that the individual may add if so desired.

For an instant mix this is pretty good. I used French Vanilla Creamer in place of regular and used my blender, mixing a 1/3 at a time, no issues with granuals floating around the cup at all. If gifting, I highly suggest the 'Chai Tea Mix' also on this site to also gift. It too is wonderful!

This was a good start, but I am still working on getting a cappuccino that I really like. Since I am looking for a french vanilla variety, I used FV creamer. I also added some non-instant chocolate and vanilla pudding mix to get a richer body. I left out the spices and subbed p. sugar. I know, I know! I didn't follow the recipe, but it gave me a place to start. My coffee grinder made the blending process go quickly! Thanks for posting!

MMM!  I dont really like coffee, but this was awesome. I recommend using hot milk instead of water for the final product. I boiled the milk and when I placed the cappuccino mix in the milk it just seemed to melt away!  Great!  I also made them as gifts and everyone loved them.

I made this for my mother for Christmas.  I used decaf coffee, french vanilla creamer, sugar free hot chocolate mix and the rest exactly as written.  3T in 6 ozs water it is very sweet.  Next time we're going to use 2T in 8 ozs and adjust accordingly.  Will also try mixing it in fat free skim milk.

Budget for gifts is low this year, we always have to travel 6 hours by car for christmas and I am always worry about making something in jars that won't get all mix 2gether by the time we get there so this will be perfect! I will attach biscotti in a bag with it, like someone else suggested.

This is really nice & easy! It looks nicer when you blend it all in the blender - but even if you just mix it with a whisk in a mixing bowl, it comes out fine. For the "chocolate drink mix" called for, I used the "Hot Chocolate Mix I" from this website. Less expensive option than buying the cappuccino mixes from the store! I'll be making this at home from now on!

I need to rate this lower, but the flavor is too good. I could not get the coffee granules to desolve and I heated the water twice. My 15 year old daughter suggested instant coffee! I will try again with instant coffee and edit this review. To be continued...

I just finished a cup. I really liked the fine hint of cinnamon and nutmeg in this drink. All of the flavours blended nicely. I made 1/2 of the recipe this time but I will certainly make the whole thing the next time.

I left the nutmeg out as I don't think it belongs in cappuccino and it turned out FANTASTIC. We loved this recipe and I bottled 4 jars of it tonight to give as Christmas gifts. I used a French Vanilla creamer as well. Very nice flavors and body....Love it, thanks sooo much for this recipe. I will pass this recipe on.

I like this recipe, a little bit high on the coffee flavor but I'm not a HUGE coffee fan. Although I do enjoy the generic gas station cappuccinos. I just added a tiny bit more hot chocolate mix. YUM

This is very good, tastes like Cappuccino from the gas station.  Not like brewed cappucino but very good and tasty like the canned varietys you buy for much more$$$ Quick, inexpensive and make a nice gift in a Mug.  Try it :)

This was a hit as a gift and I am so glad I kept one for myself. I just used it in my "Cocoa Latte" machine and it is fabulous. Perfect taste. I will have to make a new batch, just for us.

Easy to make and those who received it as a gift said it was good. I layered the ingredients to make it look like sand art and attached a tag that said to shake vigorously - a good way to release any holiday tension. ;-)

I made this for Christmas and everyone really loved it.  I used a coffee grinder to grind the instant coffee, and hot chocolate mix for the chocolate drink mix.  It may not be exactly Starbucks, but for a mix it's excellent and much less expensive than the little packets.  I'll probably make more to keep on hand.

This is a great gift in a jar for a coffee drinker obviously, but my non-coffee drinking friends enjoy having a jar of this around to serve to company wanting coffee after dinner.

I skipped the cinnamon but otherwise followed directions.  I made it for gifts and got rave reviews.  I made more than I needed and I've been enjoying a cup or two every morning.  This mix is absolutely addictive!

LOVE THIS MIX!!  I followed the recipe exactly but was careful to use the best quality ingredients to make the mix as rich as possible.  I also ground the blended mix in my coffee grinder so it will dissolve better when hot water/milk is added.

Just made this for my son's teachers. I read the reviews 1st and took the advice of using 1 cup coffee. I wound up using way more than that as it was still super weak, I can't imagine how anyone could drink this as written. It is a great idea though, just have to tweak to your taste. Also, check on the directions to provide people with- most people will use more water and therefore need more mix.

Pretty good recipe and you can add what you like to make it your own.  Be sure to put all the ingredients into the food processor to combine.  It really helps with dissolving.

I thought this was delicious and I am not a big coffee fan. I am going to give it as gifts. Yes, I know it's not really a cappuccino, it's just a name for it. If you want it frothy, try putting it in the blender for a bit. It's a good instant drink mix, similar to the General Foods Coffees, except, homemade! I had fun making it and enjoyed drinking it.

The first time I followed the recipe and found it to be a little dull.  The second time I used mint flavored hot choco mix and that added just the right extra kick I was looking for.  Tasted almost as good as the mint mocho at my favorite coffee house.

Very tasty mix. I used my blender to grind all of it into a fine powder, not just the instant coffee. I also used french vanilla creamer and just a bit less sugar. Great gift for the mocha lover in your life.

I omitted the nutmeg all together.  If using the cinnamon, then the name should be Cinnamon Mocha.  I also made some without the cinnamon as well named Mocha not cappuccino.

This is awesome stuff for camping, a lot better than just having instant coffee in the morning!  Tastes like one of those International Delights but this makes a lot more for less money.

My new favorite drink!  This recipe turned out great as is.  I love the fact that its very versatile.  You can increase or decrease the ingredients according to preference without ruining the batch.  I made a batch of decaf for my friends who drink decaf and its as good as the caffeinated batch.  Of course, I saved some for me to drink in the evening!

Add Whipped Cream (the Redi whipped Kind) to top it off-delicious!  I served this at an Italian themed pot luck dinner party and it was a huge hit. I also gave each guest a jar of it.  I even keep it on hand because I just love it!

This is great.  I don't drink it often, but I keep a jar of it at work for when I need a pick-me up.  It's a heck of a lot cheaper than going to Starbucks.  I went a bit lighter on the cinnamon, and I wish I'd added even less.  But, even still it's a good drink.  I made two of them and gave them to mine and my husband's grandmother's for mother's day.  They seem to like it!

I really liked this, although my husband thought the spices were too strong.  It does remind me a great deal of some of the instant cappuccinos I've bought.  I used Splenda, instead of sugar, because the texture was more like the other ingredients, and 1/2 and 1/2 FV and regular creamer.  I made three batches, one without the spices to make hubby happy, mixed them all together and then put it in four big jars and gave it as gifts.  I hope my friends liked it - but I suspect they'll never tell me if they didn't.

This is such a quick and easy gift to throw together with stuff around your kitchen. I personally add about one oranges worth of dried zest sometimes more sometimes less. If I'm in a hurry I use the small holes on my cheese grater, and stick it in the oven at 450 for about 5-10 minutes. Try this! Orange Cream Cappucino mix! Excellent

Tastes Great! I follow the other suggestions and omitted the spices. I blended the coffee first the added the rest of the ingredients in the food processor to give it all the same consistency and blend it thoroughly.

Delish! I love the supermarket coffee mixes, but due to the price, used them only as a treat. Since discovering this great recipe I've made several batches for myself and for gifts. I use Splenda, and omit the chocolate and nutmeg (like the flavour, just leaves residue in the cup). I also give the coffee plenty of time in the processor so it's a really fine "dust" and combines better with the other ingredients.

A fairly good recipe but I would call it Mocha in a Jar instead (nothing like a cappucino!)

It was alright, too bland. I added some powdered sugar.   I would make this again but replace the sugar for powdered sugar.

Found this to be too “chocolatey” so added an extra 60 ml each of the coffee & whitener to make it mocha

Someone suggested grinding the coffee first, so I ground the coffee and sugar together in a food processor before mixing with the other ingredients.  It makes a delicious cappuccino that dissolves easy in the cup. I made 40 pint jars to give as gifts.

This recipe is a great and versatile drink mix! You could easily change up the amounts for whatever flavors you desire. i followed the directions exactly, and had no trouble with mixing it to drink.

This recipe is AWESOME! I put the instant coffee grounds in a coffee grinder. And it dissolves perfectly in hot water! When I have my next cup, I'm gonna add a few pinches of pumpkin spice, maybe make a pumpkin latte? Yummmy!!

Really YUMMY! I was tired of paying through the teeth for those small containers of cappuccino mix and decided to try making my own. I made the recipe exactly as written and it totally fit the bill and was really to our tastes. This would be great with other flavors of powdered creamer as well. I can't wait to expierement more. This is now my new cappuccino stand-by! Thanks so much for posting. :)

I tried a couple different batches of this mix.  In the combination I'm going to use from now, I processed a couple tablespoons of cocoa powder with the coffee, and didn't add the spices.  I made this as a Christmas gift for friends, but after taste-testing it, I think I'm going to keep a little bottle of this with me when I travel, so I can always have a hot beverage when I want one.

Ok,this is what I did for the first batch I made - I processed the decaf coffee granules, added 1c. hazelnut sugar free creamer, 1c. Nestles Quick sugar free choco drink mix, 1/4 c. splenda, and didn't add the spices.  I put 3 tablespoons of the mix into 4 oz. of hot water and stirred, then added 4 or 5 oz. of milk (1%), heated it somemore and then added on International delight hazelnut creamer single to it and LOVED it.
   I am making a batch with the spices and french vanilla creamer later today.
   Not coffe, not cocoa , just good, thanks.

This was a good recipe, but more of a mocha taste to it.  I made mine as more of a "grasshopper" by adding a mint flavored chocolate powder. MMMMM, nummy.  I will be giving these for gifts.

Yummy.  I would go a bit lighter on the cinnamon and nutmeg, that is the only change I would make.  I made this to give away but have used most of one batch for home without giving any away!  It will make a nice Christmas gift.
