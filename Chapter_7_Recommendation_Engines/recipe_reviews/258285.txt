SO good!! I’ve been stuck in a rut with dinners and we had all the ingredients and I’m so glad! We didn’t have cilantro and I threw in spinach, avocado, and cheese when I toasted the filling in the tortillas on the skillet. My toddler ate it too, but only as a topping for tortilla chips. It looked too good to wait to take a picture, but I remembered to snap one after bites had been taken, ha. Will definitely make again!

The carnivores at the table enjoyed this as much as the vegetarians. Delicious and quite easy to make .

Easy and reheats well. I like this better without the corn tortilla.. just in a bowl with toppings was perfect for me
