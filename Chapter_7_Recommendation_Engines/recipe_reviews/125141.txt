I made this recipe just as described and it was so delicious, so delicious that my husband ranked this as one of my top all time dinners.  Many reviewers will change and alter the recipe and will then review the recipe based on their changes - DON'T CHANGE A THING.  If you notice, anyone who hasn't given this recipe 5 stars made changes..leave it alone and it will be perfect!  I served with white rice and a veggie and it was perfect!

Irrisistable taste and flavor. I made enough for three and there was none left after my husband and I finished dinner. Perfect with rice and veggies.

Delicious. I didn't use the cider vinegar because I didn't have any and substituted onion powder and garlic powder for the onions and garlic. I cut up the steak then marinated it overnight. Then I grilled it on the George Foreman Grill. I have fixed this many times and it always turns out perfect. Add rice and a baked potato and you've got dinner. A super easy shortcut is to buy the super trim beef stew meat instead of steaks. It's already cut up for you. All you have to do is put in the bag with the marinade then grill the next day. Tastes just as good.

Excellent flavor!!  Made the recipe "as is", flavor was great but WAY too salty.  Going to try again with half the soy sauce (and use the low sodium soy sauce) and some beef broth.  I'll let ya know how that works!

Very Good!  My picky son even liked it.  I marinated for 6 hours because I only had time to get it ready in the morning and it turned out wonderful. I did use fresh ginger instead of ground because I love it.  Other than that I did everything the same.

This was absolutely delicious! I couldn't get enough.  I used top sirloin and made the marinade exactly as stated.  I marinated the meat for about 3 hours and broiled it for 3 minutes on each side. It came out perfectly tender and juicy!  I served over brown rice with a side of Japanese Zucchini & Onions (from this site.) I would probably give it a million stars if I could.

I do agree w/another reviewer that this was a bit salty however, I expected that from all the soy sauce the recipe calls for.  Next time, I will use tamari instead of soy which should help cut down on the saltiness.  Other than that, the flavors were excellent and the meat was so tender. I put the meat over egg noodles with a side of snow peas.  Everyone in the fam loved it, so I will be making this again!

Did a double batch and put half on beef and half on chicken breast.  Grilled and used all week in salad and stir fry's.  
The only change I made was I always add a bit of rice vinegar or any vinegar to help break down the meat.  My meat is always super tender with this trick.

It was good.  I took a lot of shortcuts, dehydrated onions, canned minced garlic.  Overall it was a great marinade that enhanced the flavor of the meat.
