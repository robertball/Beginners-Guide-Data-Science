This was an easy recipe to make with simple ingredients. The flavor was a nice compliment to the chicken I made. The only issue I had was with the amount of cooking time. It took the dish an hour and 25 minutes to cook down at the directed 350 degrees. But once it was done, the dish was nice and creamy.

Added some simple seasoning and switched broth to chicken, and the added slivered almonds put it over the top!  Very good base recipe - thanks.

This was an ok side dish, though nothing exceptional unfortunately.  I upped the carrots a little.  Although not a keeper, it was a nice way to get brown rice and carrots into my daughter's dinner!

Yummy and so easy. I added a skinless boneless chicken breast to the mixture and it cooked wonderfully altogether. I have several chronic illnesses and am in a power wheelchair with very limited amounts of energy but I saw this recipe and knew I could do all and by myself too. I loved that I was able to my veggies, protein and carbs in one dish. I added an extra can of mushrooms too.

After seeing the lack of spices I added the entire can of soup, an onion, basil, and garlic. I also covered this with aluminum foil so it would stay moist. So so so good. Paired it with capris salad with balsamic reduction and chef johns salmon in parchment (both from this site) for an amazing and healthy date night dinner. Absolutely will make again soon. Thank you

Edible - but very, very bland.  Needs a lot more flavor.  Made as directed and it took almost two hours to cook.

We had this tonight and enjoyed it for a change of pace.  Since we were serving with chicken, I used chicken broth instead of beef.  Like others, I used the whole can of soup, eliminated the milk and used a bit more broth.  That was a mistake, I should have just added the milk too because I had to add water when cooking.  I also used fresh saut√©ed mushrooms, then at the end, stirred in some frozen peas that I needed to use.  This is a great base recipe, one that is easy to tailor to your family's taste.  We will definitely have again!

Easy to prepare & came out perfectly cooked. I did sub chicken stock for beef & used fresh mushrooms. Served it with Roasted Sticky Chicken Rotisserie Style from this sight.

I added some minced garlic and cooked it longer in an 8x8 dish. The rice had a more desirable texture and the flavor was great. My kids ate this and asked for more.

This was great.  I used the whole can of soup mainly because I didn't want to store it  Changed the carrots to broccoli because it was what I had on hand also used fresh mushrooms for the same reason.  I mainly tried this because I was looking for something healthy and every other rice and broccoli dish involved using processed cheese (ugh)  I'm glad I did

My picky mom and dad loved it. I wasn't a fan of using canned soup or the creaminess but it was still good. I subbed frozen peas for the mushrooms since none of us like them.

This was ok; I was trying to find a different way to serve rice and specifically use brown rice as we usually eat basmati.  My son usually gobbles up all his rice - but he didn't like this.  My hubby & I thought just ok.  Probably wouldn't make again - perhaps just not our taste.
