My mom has made these cookies every Christmas since I can remember and they've always been my favorite!  Her original recipe came from a 1980 Parenting magazine and instead of rolling the hot cookies in the crushed candy cane, we've always mixed a little bit of water with confectioner's sugar and brushed it on the tops of the cooled cookies and then rolled them in the crushed candy cane.  Works great!

These cookies are delicious... I really liked the crushed candy cane bits on top... though, I had a little trouble getting it to stick... even hot out of the oven... but if you put it on before they go in the oven, the will melt.  If you are looking for a quicker method of making these cookies... I got tired of rolling out all the pieces towards the end of my baking, so I made one big log out of the two colors and put it in the freezer for about 15 minutes... then I cut off slices of the dough and baked them... they looked beautiful, and tasted just as good!!

These are really good. I'd add at least 1 tsp of peppermint extract though. I crushed some candy canes and put them in with the red dough and only put sugar on top and I prefer them that way, the candy canes can be a bit sticky on top. I'll make these again!

I have 2 little girls, now ages 7 and 8. I found this recipe on this site 2 years ago. I was so flattered when we started talking about Christmas baking... my girls wanted to know if we would be making the candy cane cookies. They enjoy creating this cookie, it's easy and fun to make...not to mention tasty! I want to thank you for sharing this recipe with us and allowing me to start my "own" little Christmas tradition with my daughters.

I added an extra 1/2 tsp of peppermint per the advise of another reviewer and it was wonderful!  I had my mom taste them to make sure they tasted like hers and she loved them!!  They were very delicate to take of the cookie sheet once out of the oven, probaly a good idea to let them cool first.  I will definetly make these every year!

A Christmas cookie tray is incomplete without these! I always double the recipe. I make one recipe of plain dough and refrigerate it. Using the mixing bowl "as is" (without washing) I then mix up a full recipe of red dough. I just set the hot baked cookies up-side-down in sugar. Added some extra peppermint flavoring to make up for the missing crushed candy canes. Not worth the hassle. No one even noticed! I make these every year!

These are a holiday tradition at our house. I use butter instead of margarine and a full tsp of peppermint extract to increase the flavor. I also use gel food coloring so the red dough isn't so moist that you can't work with it. I also divide the dough and color half BEFORE I chill it in the fridge. Much easier. I also find it easier not to roll the hot cookies but instead sprinkle the candy on the top with a spoon when they are hot. The candy sticks really well if you do it that way and the cookies don't break. YUM.

This recipe is AMAZING.  Today was the first time I had ever made candy cane cookies and this recipe was absolutely perfect.  I didn't need to change a thing.  They are delicious and look great.  The sugar on top really makes them stand out!  GREAT recipe, I will be making a few more batches of these before Christmas!

These are very mild but tasty. They  look great with an assortment on a tray...adds color and variety.  I made green and white, red and white, and red and green. My kids really liked them.  The hardest part was crushing the candy canes.  I also used a full tsp. of peppermint extract...1/2 tsp. would not be enough.

GREAT recipe! I used to have to beg my sister in law to make these every Christmas, and she wouldn't share the recipe. Now that she's moved away, no cookies :o( Until now!!! Thank you so much for sharing. I did use butter instead of margarine, and used alot of flour when rolling them. Dusting with the sugar/candy cane mixture while hot helps make it stick.
Again, thank you, a new addition to my own holiday cookie tray!!!

My toddler and I were so excited to make these and when they finally came out--they were awful...I debated about adding the peppermint extract and I did...and they were not sweet and all I could taste was mint. They were too thick and cake-like. So disappointed!

These turned out beautifully, but I had a couple issues with the directions.  As someone else commented, the sugar/candy can mix doesn't stick well ... I smeared it on which worked OK but was really messy ... I might try spritzing them with something kinda stick and sprinkling next time. Also ... I played with the size and thickness of the 'ropes' a lot.  The cutest ones had pretty narrow short ropes.

I love these cookies and have made them for years.  I lost the recipe and was so glad to find it here!  What I like best about these cookies is that they have a very mild mint flavor.  If you are looking for a stronger flavor you should double the amount of peppermint extract, but I find they are perfect as the recipe is written.

These turned out very pretty. The only changes I made was to increase the peppermint extract. I found them a bit too soft to roll in the sugar so I waited till they cooled and brushed them with milk and confectioners sugar. The sugar mixture stuck well. Would make again

We made these every year as a kid with my mom, one of my favorite Christmas memories. Her original recipe was from the old red Betty Crocker Cookbook- now my 2 girls ask to make them every year. Awesome, and a great family activity. I omit the peppermint extract now (as we have one picky eater), and substitute almond extract. The ones the kids shape are definitely "home-made", but we're more about taste than presentation. Be sure to take out of the oven a few minutes early if you like softer cookies!

I made this recipe on Sunday night for my son's class and the cookies came out good.  The dough needed to be put in the fridge longer than an hour though to be handled, and even then I had to use a little at a time and keep the rest chilled while rolling out the cookies.  It was a little tricky rolling them out, but for a first attempt, they came out good.  I wanted to make them again today for my daughter's class, and I made everything the same except I used Country Crock Margarine instead of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" sticks.  The dough never really set up enough to roll out candy canes, and it was kind of greasy.  I think this was because of the change in margarine types.  To compensate I added a little more flour and this made the cookies come out more like a scone flavor.  Instead of making candy canes I rolled thin strips of red, green and plain dough together and twisted them by rolling each end in opposite directions and spinning my cutting board around.  This made a long think candy cane which would be fun to cook as is, but I cut them into small rectangles to look almost like pillow candy.  Overall they came out okay..I will definately use "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" again the next time though.  It needs something else though too to sweeten the bland flavor of the dough.

I made these last night. Upon taste testing the dough, I was instantly thrown back to my childhood. Yes, this is exactly how I remember them. I am so happy and I will be making more of these soon. The batch does not make as the recipe says but that's okay. I rather have "real size" candy cane cookies than tiny bite sized ones.

These were SOOOOOO good and fun to make with the kids. I used almond instead of the peppermint extract.  next time I'll have to crush the candies more because they didn't stick very well. I ate four while baking.  Yum!

These are such  pretty cookies! I used butter instead of margarine and doubled the peppermint extract. I sprinkled red and white sugar crystals on them before baking instead of using the crushed candy canes. I think with a recipe like this you have to go into it knowing it's going to be a pain in the rear end to make them :) You need a very gentle touch when rolling out the ropes and plenty of mine were do-overs because they tore while I tried to twist them. But I trudged forward and was rewarded with a spectacular-looking treat. They didn't puff at all in the oven! Will definitely make again next year!

Fabulous! We added the crushed peppermint candy canes to the red dough instead of putting it on top - did not use the white sugar for decoration but might consider it next time. Peppermint flavoring is perfect.

These were so tasty and easy to make! What a fun idea. We just used our regular sugar cookie recipe since we made a huge batch of those as well, and colored some of it red to make these.

I used to make these with my grandmother but I like this recipe even better! I only changed a couple things.  I didn't have peppermint extract so I crushed a few candy canes (about a 1/2 cup) and used them instead, put it right in the batter.  Before I chilled the dough I divided it and used the mixer to blend in the red food coloring for 1/2 the dough.  You will need to use a lot of red food coloring so they don't look pink.  I used about a 1/3 of a bottle.  This dough is EXCELLENT to roll and work this.  I'll use it for cookie cutter dough too.  I didn't decorate mine, didn't need it since the crushed candy canes in the dough gave it a neat texture.  Love them, thanks!!!!!

The cookies tasted good but way too much time and effort for the end result.  Added 1/2 tsp more of peppermint extract.  Probably won't make again.

Overall, not worth the super-human effort.
This is my first and last time making candy cane cookies. To all of you who make them every year - I salute you!
My two cents:
- These cookies have a very mild flavor - think shortbread. I like it and it is nice to have a cookie that is not overly sweet in the mix. I liked the texture as well.
- Rolling the dough into this shape is just a pain. I really can't imagine any other dough would be easier. It is what it is. Mine looked quite festive and cheerful, but not perfect by any stretch!
- I took the advice of another reviewer and brushed sugar water on my cooled cookies before dipping them in crushed candy canes. This worked okay, but my candy canes absorbed moisture and were all clumped together about halfway through the batch. I would set aside half of the candy cane next time (but there won't be a next time, will there?).

This was a wonderful recipe. One problem was that the dough was very dry, so i added close to a cup of milk to get it into a more doughlike consistency. i didn't measoure it out, i just eyeballed it. the dough itself was quite quick, it was just the rolling out and twitsing. i found that if you place the two coloured strips side by side, with the edges touching in a straight line, then roll each end in the opposite direction, it the twist comes out perfect. i also squished the sides so the spirals didn't puff up like the picture. The first time i made them, i found that there wasn't enough peppermint flavour, so the next time, i doubled what the recipe called for. the flavour was faint, and my husband couldn't taste it, but i could. i suggest using 1 and a half teaspoons. These cookies are very good, with a few minor tweaks. i have a very big family, and they demand i bring them to our annual christmas dinner. the kids also love helping out, although they need to be a little older. you can even hang them on your tree!

Once again I tried to make candy cane cookies and once again failed. The dough would not cooperate! As soon as I started to roll the ropes the dough fell apart because the heat from my hands made it unworkable. Argh. I just made red and white drop cookies, so they are edible. Too much work to do again. 3 stars because the cookies themselves are good.

Super cute cookie, not the most flavorful but maybe the best looking!  I am thinking about hanging them on the christmas tree on christmas eve instead of real candy canes.  They are very time consuming so I did mine in a few different batches, refrigerating them inbetween.

first time making these cookies,trying to get a head start on my christmas cookies this year, doing test run before mailing them out, anyway the idea for these is great but are time consuming. Have to practice twisting the dough around i guess, but they did taste good, the kids loved them. Can look good plain or with the (i used peppermints) on them. Used the idea for brushing confectioner sugar with water on the to hold on the mints, worked ok. Will make again for gifts, just have to work on my twisting...lol

These were good as far as taste, but they were very time consuming and somewhat difficult to assemble.  I usually don't mind more involved recipes, but I'm not sure if these were worth the effort.  They did look nice when they were finished though, so if you're looking to impress people with a different kind of cookie then maybe they would be!

For those of you who had trouble rolling them out, try this: Keep dough in fridge. Only pinch off enough for 2 candy canes at a time, be sure to roll on lightly floured surface. 
For quicker and easier candy caned take your two colors, enough for 2 canes, place them side by side and roll them together. You will have a rope 1/2 red and 1/2 white. Make your rope 4", cut in half and twist the dough like another suggestion, ends opposite way, you will have the same effect with less hassle.

I was so optimistic about these cookies. However, they didn't turn out as nicely as I had hoped. We went through the reviews and made some of the suggested modifications (half butter/half shortening, mixing the crushed candy canes into the red dough, longer refrigeration time, sprinkling with sugar while hot, etc.) but the dough was still very crumbly and hard to work with. I also think we let the dough get too warm while we were shaping the cookies, and they ended up spreading a lot while baking. Overall, they still tasted good, which is why I'm giving 3 stars. If there is a next time, I will probably try shaping and baking about 4 cookies at a time to keep the dough from warming too much before going into the oven.

I made this recipe exactly as follows, and I would say that the margarine to flour ratio is off...they were not firm, very soft and squishy and I have used better recipes.

Pretty good, and just like I remember as a kid!  Not too sweet, which is nice.  We sprinkled the crushed candy canes and sugar instead of rolling it, but I still think they turned out great!  Love the peppermint extract in it.

I used to make these every Christmas with my mother.  Now that I'm in charge of the Christmas cookies I searched for this cookie to add to my platter.  This recipe is a bit different than I made as a child, however, honestly...better!  The cookies came up perfect crispness / chewiness!  However, I must say the dough was difficult / irritating to work with - warmed very easily when rolling and I had to frequently place it in the freezer for quick firming.  Often my cookie sheets were going in the oven with only 4 cookies on them!  Overall, though, the taste, texture and presentation of the final product was exceptional!  Even my 16 month old loves these!

They look very festive but taste horrible.  I felt like I was eating a biscuit.  I think if you double the peppermint extract that would take care of the problem.  1/2 tsp is not enough at all.

Wow.. This was an easy recipe to make and it tasted WONDERFUL! And the kids had a BLAST making the candy canes! I added 1 teas of mint extract like others suggested and like others the chopped up peppermint candies didn't really stick at all to the cookies.. I tried adding some to the cookies before I baked them but that just turned into a melted mess **Oh shoot, I guess I'll have to save all those ugly cookies for myself** LOL... so I just made sure the peppermint candies were chopped so fine (like powder) that I could just sprinkle it on while the cookies were cooling but still hot and that seemed to work pretty well. DEFINATLY a Keeper! My new favorite Christmas cookie!

These have always been a favorite among everyone,  BUT, make SURE to roll them thin enough or they come out too thick and chewy instead of "candy cane" like , and if you like them sweeter, dip in MORE sugar.... or if you like MORE peppermint, dip in crushed candy canes, but make sure these are crushed FINELY  ;)

My Grandmother made these every year for Christmas.  After I moved away from home I started making them.  I also color the dough before chilling.  And I use 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter in mine.  This keeps the flavor while keeping the whiteness of the white dough.  I also have found doing a few twists, then rolling the dough gently with my fingers helps with the shaping, so there's not so much "handling"; and definitely let them cool before removing from the cookie sheet!
Thanks so much for the suggestion of brushing with water/confectioner's sugar to stick crushed candy on.  I've been skipping that for years and just going with sugar.

We had no extracts.  We made it without. I made the recipe for slightly more than double...seems it called for 3 1/2 + Tablespoon flour.  So the amount of egg was a strange  number... like 1 egg and 1/3!! Hahah... we just added 2 eggs.  I felt it offset the lack of extracts.  

It was my 10 year old who made this, and hence the photos show the cookies slightly over cooked.  But you know what? We all loved them!  They are kind of like a butter/shortbread cookie.  Not too sweet, but pleasantly sweet.  

We also sprinkled sugar on when just out of oven.    These are very pretty cookies, and I don't understand all the negative ratings.  Especially when a 10 year old, inexperienced baker made!

I made this recipe the other day, and they are very good ! I found the dough way too soft (even after chilling) to make into ropes and roll into candy came shapes . So instead, I made 'candy cane swirls' . I rolled out the white dough, and the red dough and put it on top of each other . (Think cinnamon roll, but instead of cinnamon and sugar i put the red sheet of dough on top) . I rolled it using wax paper (awesome tip-google it!) and sliced into rounds and flattened slightly . When they came out of the oven I put the crushed candy canes on top, but they wouldn't stick :( I found that the mint flavor was slightly underwhelming, so we drizzled with a tiny bit of glaze with a drop of mint extract . Yum! Next time we make this I will increase mint extract in dough by 1/4 tsp, brush glaze over top of rounds and sprinkle candy canes over so they will stick better . Overall, very good cookie!

I gave this review 2 stars only because the cookies were cute. Now as for taste, They had flour taste. Not good. I was really disappointed over the flavor of these cookies. And they were a bit hard to manage with the twisting because the dough kept sticking to my fingers.

If you like bland cookies then these are for you. I have made these before in the past, so I can figure out the roping and twisting process, but the flavor wasn't there for me.

It is rare that I give such a low mark, but these were quite a disappointment.  I divided the dough in half and colored part red.  Forming the "rope" and twisting was not obvious to me.... and mine were extremely time consuming and not very pretty.  I found a video on Joy Of Baking that shows the twisting technique.  However, I don't think it is worth all the effort.  The taste was "so-so" in my opinion.

i thought these cookies were great!  i rolled a small piece of each colored dough into about two inch pieces, then i picked them up twisted them, then rolled into each other on the cutting board.  did that make sense?  =)  just make sure the board is dry, and only leave a little flour on your fingers, or the dough will not stay and roll together.  then i put the twisted, rolled strip on the baking sheet lined with parchment, then i turned the end into a cane.  right out of the oven, i poured white sugar on top, and it made them look awesome!

This was a really cute and different cookie to make for the holidays. I made them for my 7 year old daughter's school holiday party. In the dough, I added and extra half a tsp of the peppermint extract. I used a cookie press and put half of the red and white dough in it.  Then I used the setting that let's it out in a round rope like form so it saved having to roll them out.  I then cut the pieces and then just slightly twisted them.  I then cooked them with red sprinkles.  When they were done I put the chopped up candy cane on them and put them in the oven for a about a minute.  When they were all cooled I made a  thin white icing with peppermint extract to drizzle on the candy canes in a diagnal form to give it the look of more white stripes.  It was really good and they looked so cute.

I was only able to make about 2 pans worth of cookies out of this recipe (about 20 cookies). I guess I do like my cookies big! I have used this recipe before but it didn't have the candy toping. I couldn't get the candy to stay on top of the cookies at first. But as soon as the cookies cooled the candy stayed. I also added 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract. I feel like it could have used another 1/2 a teaspoon. Other than my issues with it this was a great recipe. My daughter and husband made sure they were gone by the next day!

Although I love to bake, I admit that making "pretty" cookies is not my strength.  From the reviews I read I expected this recipe to be easy.  I had some unexpected difficulties.  I originally planned for my children and their friends to make these one night.  I crushed the candy canes (opening them all was a time consuming chore!), used my food processor to crush them and left them in a cup for later when we made the cookies.  Big mistake!  The crushed crumbs all gelled together.  They were unusable.  I discovered this when we were about to make the cookies.  The dough had chilled a little over an hour.  I decided to wait until the next morning to make them.  "At least" an hour for the chilling had an upper limit I learned.  In the morning the dough was hard as a rock, and I simply couldn't use it.  Later, when I could use the dough I had trouble mixing the red food coloring in with the hard dough.  I think it would have been easier to divide the dough and mix the food coloring in before chilling it.  For some reason, when I formed the cookies the uncolored dough was very crumbly.  The red dough was not.  The really didn't look very pretty.

My brother asks for these cookies every year. I have tried many different recipes in the past, but they were always too dry to form the candy canes. This is the best recipe I have found and will use for years to come! I did increase the peppermint extract to 1 tsp and the flavor is great.

The cookies turned out delicious without the candy canes on top. The only issue was the prep time.  It took a long time to shape into candy canes.

I am adding to my review- recipe doesn't state how much to roll.  To save  some trial & error, I rolled each into 1 inch ball, then rolled into ropes approx 4 1/2 - 5 inch long, then braided.   Baked 6 to 6  1/2 min.

I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the peppermint to 1 tsp, and it was good (not too strong, but still could taste it). the cookies are pretty, and not too sweet.  I didn't roll the cookie in candy cane (didn't want the crunch of candy cane pieces), instead I added powdered candy cane to the red dough. The dough was a bit tricky to work with (too cold it was too hard to mold, to warm it falls apart) but even with some wonky shaped cookies I was still happy I made them. The kids loved them, and so did the adults.  The recipe is a keeper.

Tried this recipe and I like the one I've been using a whole lot better. Instead of the vanilla and peppermint flavoring, I use a tsp. of almond extract. This, along with a crushed peppermint candy/sugar mixture on top after it comes out of the oven, is a wonderful, light, combination.

I really liked the recipe the way it is the first time I made it.  Very Christmasy! Then the second time I changed the margarine to butter, used 1/2 c. confectioner's sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar, about 2t vanilla, no peppermint (we don't like it much) and did not roll in sugar or candy cane bits. Just personal preference. Next time I will try all white sugar only.  What a great recipe :)  Thanks!

These cookies are very pretty.  They are delicate when hot so suggest you make the hook part strong.  I lost a few at the hook, which is fine because my husband eats the broken one.  I put the cookies in a sided bowl with table sugar and shook until they were coated.  My family does not like peppermint so I put more vanilla (same amount as the peppermint plus what was called for).

I have never made sugar cookies before and thought they were a bit bland.. I coloured the dough green and red and made twisted sticks as the canes kept breaking when removing off the sheet. Very pretty at least.  I used a full tsp of the peppermint extract also.

Very good recipe. The peppermint flavor wasn't overpowering. Will definitely make again. The only thing I modified was adding another color (green) to the mix.

My boys (8 and 10) tried this recipe today. They love to make the candy canes. Unfortunately the dough was so floppy it was very hard to roll into the candy canes.  I debated on if I should use butter in sted of margarine.  I think that was the key. Butter would have firmed up in the frig better. Tasted okay. But not fun to work with.

I made 1/2 of this recipe and it was fantastic. However, I didn't have peppermint extract, or almond extract, so I used 5 Santa's Treats mini candy canes for the dough. I also used 5 of the same candy canes for the sugar mixture. The dough will taste sort of like candy canes, but will have dough taste.

My grandma made this a little different. She didn't add the peppermint extract or the crushed candy canes. Instead, she just dipped them in sugar right from the oven. It's just like sugar cookies that look like candy canes. I love them this way! My grandma got the recipe from Betty crocker's cooky book 1963.

I baked these cookies pretty much as given, except that I used all butter, instead of margarine, and I used all vanilla flavoring. I also found that 4-5 inch worms worked the best. There was no way I could have rolled the cookies in the sugar/peppermint candy mixture when they were warm. They would have broken up. I sprinkled some of the sugar/peppermint on them, instead. If I were to do it again, I'd actually skip crushing the peppermint candy. I might sprinkle the cookies very lightly with granulated sugar when warm, but I might not even do that. I thought that the cookies tasted very good on their own. They were also very colorful. They are somewhat time-consuming, but great to make with grand children who like to be actively involved.

The directions were not very helpful. The dough was very sticky and I had to look up another recipe to find that you need to roll the dough with flour. "Rolling" the candy canes in the peppermint/sugar topping was not easy. I just ended up sprinkling it on top and it didn't even stick to the cookies. They taste ok and look cute, but not worth the effort!!

The cookie, delish! The recipe, easy as pie and making the canes, well still learning that one! lol..I even made a pretzel shaped one! Mykids loved them and Ive eaten more than I should! LOL! I too had trouble with the candy cane, sugar topping, I resolved it by leaving the candy cane pieces a littler larger than the recipe calls for and puting them on prior to baking and they did not melt :) Thanks for sharing :)

Good version of this recipe!  I, like someone else, put crushed the candy canes and put them inside the red part of the dough and baked it in.   I also doubled the amount of peppermint flavoring - yummy!

These cookies did not turn out well.  The dough was very sticky.  It was impossible to roll out or twist up.  I tried several different ways of handliing the dough to make the canes, and nothing worked.  After a few different attempts, I ended up just making drop cookies instead.  Also, rolling the cookies in the sugar after baking didn't work.  Nothing really sticks to them.  Also, the recipe wasn't specific about how thick to make the ropes.  They tasted alright.  Not very sweet or very minty though.  I'm not sure what might have gone wrong, but these cookies were a definite flop for me.

I made this dough so I could help my 4 yr old make some cookies. I made them exactly as in the recipe and my dough wouldn't form ropes long enough to make canes.  Since it was already made I rolled it out and he made cut out cookies instead.

These are ok but I agree with some other reviews that they really aren't worth the time they take to make.  I don't understand why some folks give it a 4 or 5 star rating but then also list about 10 adjustments they made to the recipe.  IMO, they are no longer reviewing this recipe so it skews the overall rating.  If you do make these, I would suggest not using the crushed candycane/sugar coating.  They're much prettier left alone.  These cookies are pretty on a cookie tray but I probably won't make them again.

My mom made me these with a small variation ever since I can remember. I tried this recipe and it tasted the same as hers. MAKE SURE YOU CHILL THE DOUGH BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO ROLL INTO BALLS AND ROPES!! I used  full teaspoon of peppermint and also crushed candy canes in the red dough. These just remind me of childhood. My hubs does not care for these as he thinks they taste like flour, I will admit they aren't overly favorful or sweet but thats what makes them good :)

These have very good peppermint flavor, and they bake up nicely.  Definitely a pain to make--one of those things that I know going into it that will be a pain but trudge ahead anyway.  Halfway through I always wonder why I'm torturing myself . . .anyway, cute but you definitely have to take your time.  Mine tore each time I think.  I didn't bother crushing peppermint candy and just rolled in regular sugar before baking.  Thanks for the recipe!

Hands down, my mother made this recipe seem not only easier but her cookies were much better. No offense to the recipe artist but the cookies were ridiculously hard to manipulate unless they were thoroughly chilled. I will say after the two hours of work and waiting it led to an intense dough fight. The cookies created a ton of laughs in the process.   Needs -1/2 cup more sugar -Almond instead of peppermint extract -1/4 cup less sugar  Also try lightly buttering the top with some sugar whipped butter and the sugar will probably stick a lot better.

I used 1 t of peppermint extract instead of just a 1/2 t with wonderful results.  I made candy canes with about half the dough.  The other half I used to make round cookies - when they cooled a bit I pressed a candy cane-flavored Hershey kiss in the center.

Help!!  I tried making these cookies
tonight and could not get "worms" at all!  Every time I got the dough to a worm shape, it crumbled and cracked.  By the time I reached frustration, the dough was all warm again and now it is sitting in the fridge.

Very good!!! I did double the peppermint, and I did 1/2 butter flavored crisco and 1/2 butter.  My 14 year old and I had so much fun! We split the dough into thirds and did red, GREEN and white.....NOW, it's Christmas!

My kids love this cookie.  It does take a little time because of chilling the dough and twisting the doughs together but they are very festive and worth it.  The peppermint extract really makes a difference.  I did have a hard time getting the crushed peppermint to stick after they were baked so instead I rolled them in sugar before baking and they were great.

I love baking Christmas cookies and have made dozens of different kinds, from drop to shaped to bars.  This recipe sounded and looked so good, I thought I'd give it a try.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  Rarely have I had a cookie fail so badly.  The cookie itself was delicious, but they looked horrible!  The first batch spread out way too much and I ended up with huge, amorphous, striped cookies.  I tried dipping them in the candy cane/sugar mixture, but that just looked strange so I didn't bother next time.  The next batch, I tried to roll each worm much smaller and the cookies did turn out better, but still didn't look very good.  Since the dough was so soft, even after refrigerating for 2 hours, I put it in the freezer for an hour to see if I could make one more batch with harder dough.  That didn't work either; the dough became too brittle too roll.  In the end, I just decided to give up on the rest of the cookies because it wasn't worth all that prep work to get mediocre-looking cookies.  I'd rather my boyfriend eat the dough than waste my time on these cookies.  I have plenty of recipes that turn out much better cookies with a lot less work.  What a disappointment!  I won't bother with this recipe again.  Suggestions: If you don't mind how your cookie looks, this is a tasty recipe, but very time intensive.  Using butter instead of margarine might prevent the cookies from spreading so much and I'd skip the candy cane topping or follow one of the suggestions on

This is the best base for a sugar cookie recipe. Mix the coloring when the dough is fresh, it's easier (for the other reviewer). 

I did increase the peppermint to 1 tsp and using a "hand chopper like Pampered Chef to chop the candy is much easier. I used round hard peppermints instead of candy canes (easier to unwrap and find).

The dough does chill fast, I only had it in the frig for 2 hours, but taking small balls in your hands and rolling them around quickly form logs.

I LOVED this recipe and am going to experiment with other colors and candies!

Very good cookie.  I made the dough, left it overnight, and then when my 7 year old came home from school with her little friend, we made candy cane shapes together.  Excellent, and tasty.

I used to make these cookies when I was younger with my grandmother but now she is too old to carry on the tradition.  I have two little girls myself now and we've  created a new tradition of baking the cookies together.  They love 'em and it's fun doing it together.

I had a recipe for these cookies when my kids were little.  They used to eat them faster than I  could make them.  I lost the recipe from then.  These are pretty close to the one's I used to make.  I didn't use the pepperment extract so they were more like butter cookies

Great cookie for the holidays! Soft and wonderful.  Didn't make candy canes but stars with a sprinkle of peppermint!  A traditional cookie for christmas!

These were very yummy and fun to make as a family.  The only thing that I would change in the future is the candy cane pieces on top.  They don't stick very well and it made a huge mess.  They do definitely add to the cookie's flavor though, so I think I'll try what a previous reviewer suggested, adding the candy cane pieces to the red dough and just adding sugar to the top.  The cookie is definitely a keeper though.

These are a lot of fun but I would add a little more peppermint.  They don't have too much taste but they are so cute!  I wasn't able to roll them in sugar and candy cane because they broke apart too easily.  Maybe I made them too big???  I would make these again.
