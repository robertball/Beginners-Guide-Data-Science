This was soooo good!  Myself and my husband are currently on WW and we were looking for a wonderful side dish to make last night and this was perfect. I substituted light marg for regular, skim milk, used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 as others had suggested and used egg whites instead of whole eggs and it was still delicious. Thank you for a wonderful tasty way to use carrots..even my "cooked carrot" hating husband loved this!

I loved this!  I used 2 cans of carrots instead of fresh and it was SO easy to make.  I think the sugar could be cut down a bit, depending on your taste, and it definitely takes longer than 1/2 hr to cook.

DELICIOUS!!!  I can't get my kids to like veggies but they loved this.  I did use 1/2 cup of sugar and baked twice as long.  This is also going to be served as a dessert.  Thanks for the great recipe, Paula.

I use this recipe as a dessert...my boyfriend loves the flavor and I love it because its a healthy, low calorie dessert.  At the last dinner party I had I poured the mixture into a low fat graham cracker crust before baking and everyone raved about it...the graham crackers compliment the flavor wonderfully.  The other great thing about this recipe is that it calls for things that you probably already have so you may not have to do any shopping to make it.

Fantastic!  Wow who knew?!?!  This is so
good.  It taste like a sweet potato 
casserole, no better!  I reduced the 
sugar to 1/2 cup versus 1 cup.  I think
it would have been too sweet with 1 cup.
I did sprinkle a litte powdered sugar.
on top after baking. I also did not add
salt.  Excellent way to get kids to eat
carrots!

If you like pumpkin pie or baked yams, you'll love this recipe.  I've never even thought of making carrots this way.  The only thing I did different than the recipe is that I blended all the ingredients in the blender afer finding out that the carrots didn't have enough moisture alone to blend properly.

This was really good. Used 2 cans of canned baby carrots and just pureed all ingredients together in the blender. Used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, otherwise no changes. Did need longer to cook - probably 45-50 minutes. Served with pork chops and made for a nice autumn side dish.

Awesome. My husband and I loved it. Make sure you have a sweet tooth. I think next time I will cut back on the spices and sugar. Great dish. Thanks. I will be making this again.

only reason this wasn't 5 stars is because the recipe calls for way too much cinnamon. other than that it was good.  i would recommend nuts on top also.

I was looking for a recipe that used a lot of carrots.  I don't like the taste of cooked carrots but thought that I would try it after reading the reviews.  This recipe tastes great, makes a great side.

I had some carrots to use up, and had all the other ingredients on hand, so I gave this a try. I made it exactly as written. I guess I cooked the carrots long enough, but I'd never pureed carrots before. I found that you have to run the blender for a while - my results still had a few chunks in them.
When baking, the casserole was still pretty liquid in the middle, even at 30 minutes. So I wound up baking it for 36 minutes total, and it looked somewhat "set". I then let it sit out and cool a bit for 5-10 minutes, and the consistency was thickened nicely by that point.
This was a pretty good dish. I can take or leave carrots, and I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes or pumpkin pie, which I think this dish resembles, but I was willing to try it. I thought it was maybe a little too sweet, though, so maybe 2/3 or even 1/2 cup of sugar would suffice next time. I think this dish would really shine when paired with an appropriate main dish (maybe ham would be a good choice?).

I wanted something different to take a a family reunion.  I knew carrots would be different for my family.  I would have never guessed the reviews.  Even the non-veggie eating kids devoured it.  You should have seen their faces when I told them it was carrots.

This recipe is another family favorite!  We have this with special dinners.  It goes nicely with beef or pork roasts, chicken, or any other roasted meat.  It is also very good when served with ethnic dishes (Indian food especially).  I guarantee this will become a holiday favorite, even for those who think they hate carrots!

It was good and even though I upped the spices a little I think next time I will up them even more.  Great way to get kids to eat carrots.

At first I was hesitant to try this recipe, but the reviews made me curious. This was my first time making carrot casserole and it turned out great. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and it the dish still came out sweet. It taste just like yams or sweet potato pie!

No one ate this.  We tried and wanted to like it as we do like the idea about finding ways for kids to increase veggie intake.  I don't know what it was, it just was pleasing to our family.  The combination just didn't work well.  We did cut the sugar down and increase cooking time as suggested.  I guess there are many different palates out there - this one just didn't engage ours.

Not bad at all!  My 2.5 yr old daughters LOVED it.  I didn't think they'd stop eating!  I did make some BIG changes, specifically the sugar - 1 cup would be WAAAAY too much, I did 1/2 and it was still far too sweet.  I changed the butter, did about 3/4 tbls of "Earth Balance" buttery stick.  And lastly, I used egg whites, and it worked just fine, maybe it wasn't as thick as it could have been, but it went from something that would have been a dessert to a great side dish!!

Served this for our Thanksgiving and everyone thought it was a pumpkin casserole or sweet potato casserole.  Even myself, if I hadn't made it, would never have thought this to be from carrots.  I cut the sugar in half and it was fine.  The full amount of sugar would make it too sweet I think. I liked it and it is a good, unique recipe especially if you have excess carrots you want to use up, but if for Thanksgiving and you are serving sweet potatoes or pumpkin pie it is too similar to warrant being on the menu.

THIS WAS GOOD BUT I THINK THE SPICES OVERPOWER THE CARROT FLAVOR. NEXT TIME I WILL CUT BACK ON THE AMOUNTS OF THE SPICES. MY 12 YR OLD LOVED IT AS IS.

I needed to use up my home canned carrots. So quick, I did the whole thing in the food processor. I left out cinnamon, used 1/2 teaspoon of ginger instead. Also used 3/4 c. brownd sugar for the white, and 4 oz. light cream cheese for the butter and milk. Had to bake 1 hour. This is really a KEEPER! I love it. Thanks Paula.

This recipe was alright. Wayyyyy to much cinnamon and way too sweet. My dh loves the Carrot Souffle recipe from this site and I think we'll stick with that one.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving and book club dinner, and chuch potluck.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet. Also I did not puree. I used a hand held blender and it had small chunks.
This is so easy to make but it takes a while for the carrots to get tender.

This was just okay. It definitely needed to cook longer than 25-30 minutes, I'd say 45-50 minutes would be more accurate. Plus, the consistency was a little weird, and I blended up those carrots very well. It was kind of chunky and watery at the same time. The flavor, however, was excellent. Maybe a little too much nutmeg, but otherwise it was very tasty. I might not make it again, or it might be better as a pie filling.

I wish I had read reviews first so I could have known it would take twice as long to bake than stated. It worked out though because the dish was more like a desert and appropriate for after dinner. It should be called carrot pudding. I think I'll also reduce the sugar next time around. Highly recommended with the changes of less sugar and maybe less spices.

Perfect for the holidays. I used only 1/2 the nutmeg and 1/2 the sugar. Still tasted like pumpkin pie.

Delicious!  I love this recipe.  So flavorful!  Really tastes just like pumpkin pie.  So easy to make too!  I omitted the nutmeg and used extra cinnamon, and it turned out great.    Thanks for sharing!

I have made this probably once a week since discovering it.  I lessen the sugar to 1/4 c brown sugar and add some unsweetened applesauce.  Sometimes I put in honey.  I always add cinnamon.  My kids love this and I enjoy it too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

As recommended, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 c and kicked the spices up to 1.5 t.  Next time, I'd do 3/4 c for the sugar (and maybe use brown sugar for some of it), 2 t for the spices, omit an egg, and maybe add a dash or two of ground cloves.  With work, I think this could be really good.

I made this for Sunday dinner.  My children were reluctant until they tasted it.  There wasn't one spoonful left!  I too reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and let it cook for about 45 minutes until it firmed up.  Thanks for the recipe that will have my kids eating their veggies!

Actually very tasty. Wouldn't recommend eating too much in one sitting, though -- very rich.

Oddly, tastes more like pumpkin pie filling than a "casserole". Add a crust and you'd have a carrot-based thanksgiving treat.

This recipe tastes just like sweet potatoes. Very tasty!! However I found that it needs to bake alot longer than the directions says. Overall alot of prep in peeling, boiling, then baking but well worth the effort.
