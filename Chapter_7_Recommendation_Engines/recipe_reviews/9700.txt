WOW!!! I added just a touch of vanilla extract and creamed my butter and sugar for a very long time as suggested in other reviews and the dough came out feeling like silk.  Melt in your mouth cookies.  Follow my advise above and you will love these cookies.  I am going to try almond extract next.

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars! I've never made shortcake cookies before, but I had a craving for them and I already had everything on hand. These are so much better and homemade tasting than those yummy cookies you get in a tin. I would not recommend rolling the dough out, because shortbread dough tends to be crumbly. Instead I made tiny balls and flattened them out with a fork, which made a pretty criss cross design. You can also make variations, such as adding chocolate chips or dipping one half in chocolate after.

Not the best, could've been better.  You're setting yourself up for a fall if you say it's the best and I expect it to be the best and it doesn't compare to competition.

This is an excellent recipe. I love that it has so few ingredients, and is so easy, yet so delicious! I am so happy to have found it. The only thing I changed is, I added 2 tsp. of vanilla, and I spread the batter in a small jelly roll pan and cut it for the size cookies I wanted, and I baked it for 30 minutes at 325*F. I got 32 cookies doing it this way. I can't thank you enough for this recipe. Because it's so easy, I will make them often. This one's a keeper. I will always use it!

Exactly what shortbread should taste like!  If you want a bit more crunchy shortbread, it takes much longer to bake but is delicious no matter what.  Sprinkle sugar on the top for extra flavor.

I baked these for Thanksgiving, using a maple leaf cookie cutter, and drizzled a powdered sugar/milk mixture over it (colored in fall colors of course). I took them to my Aunt's house, and they were immediately gobbled up. My Aunt and Grandma even decided to take a bunch and stash them away for their daily tea! What a delicious recipe! They keep their shape well, and are very buttery and yummy! This will definately stay in my recipe box.

Very good recipe.  I tend to like sweeter cookies so I sprinkled the top with sugar before baking.  Very happy with the result!  Thank you!

Great recipe...the dough is difficult to work with (crumbly as shortbread dough should be). Solution: This dough recipe can be made ahead of time. These make GREAT party treats or gifts if you can make them more "eye appealing". Here is how: Transfer the dough to a gallon-sized plastic bag.  Place the bag on a flat work surface, leaving the top open.  Roll the dough into a 9 x 10 1/2-inch rectangle that is about 1/4 inch thick.  As you roll, turn the bag occasionally and lift the plastic from the dough so it doesnâ€™t cause creases.  When the dough has reached the desired size and thickness, seal the bag pressing out as much excess air as possible, and refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours, or up to 2 days.  When ready to bake, put the plastic bag on a cutting board and slit it open.  Discard the bag.  Using a ruler (or eye ball it) as a guide, cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch squares.  Transfer the squares to baking sheets.  Add ins to try in this basic recipe: 1 tbsp espresso powder dissolved in 1 tbsp boiling water and mini chocolate chips (yum)  Or crasins and chopped cashews or almonds When using add ins- decrease oven temp to 325 and bake twice as long (16-17 min)

Just made this for Christmas once again.  The recipe is perfect.  Follow the directions, make sure the cookies are about 1/2 inch thick and mark with fork tines.  It's hard to tell the difference between these and the ones you buy in the store!

These were O.K. but I think I still prefer the ones I've always gotten, imported in a Scottish tin, I've never found a recipe that tastes as good as those, but I'm still looking.

i absolutely love this recipe. I changed a few things. I added just a bit more salt and i cut them round and rolled the edges in sugar. I find if you have trouble rolling this dough out, it helps to chill it for about 30 minutes first, then try rolling it out. I've made shortbread before and this was almost exactly what i was looking for. Thanks!

Absolutely the best shortbread ever! I have played with the variations....adding almond extract or lemon zest, sometimes just vanilla bean  paste.  I've even made a savory batch with garlic and rosemary for the base for an amuse-bouche. Tonight I am adding ginger puree and orange zest!  I typically roll these out kinda thick (1/2" or thicker) and cut into different size rounds--it works great with all differenct cookie cutters too.  I watch the bake time very closely.  This recipe is just so versatile...I love it!

Very good recipe Helen.  I used regular sugar instead of powdered and added some almond extract for a little extra flavor.  I had this as an afternoon snack with coffee.  Thanks for sharing.

Sweet and rich. A sure pleasure for dessert and snacks. Also very soft and smooth. You can make them into pretty much any shape. If ratings for these recipes could got to 100 stars i'd give it a hundred. :)

Extremely disappointing. Definitely needs a LOT more sugar in it. It tasted very dry and bland. Doubt I'll give it another try. Even added vanilla extract as suggested by others and extra sugar.

I love this shortbread.  I cream the sugar and butter (and a little almond extract) for a very very long time.  I find this is successful both as a pan shortbread or rolled and cut out.

These were good.  Not quite what I was looking for.  These are a bit plain but still tasty.  I prefer the shortbread made brown sugar.  I was looking for a shortbread cookie that tastes like a Lorna Doon.  I thought the Scottish Shortbread IV recipe was the best.

This is the standard shortbread recipe. It's the perfect texture and taste. I baked for around 8 minutes in my oven.

Fantastic, and so simple. I needed a little bit more butter than stated and used wholemeal flour instead, and they turned out wonderful. Quantities in the recipe made much more than I expected. Definitely one to keep!

This was an extremely easy recipe! I am sad to say I forgot the salt ;( but i did sprinkle some one before baking. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. They turned out pretty good and will try them again and this time I won't forget the salt! Thanks for such an easy recipe to such a wonderful cookie!

So also had no eggs on hand and need to fufill a cookie craving so this is the recipe that sounded the best.  I took from some other reviews and this is what I did.  I halved the recipe as a test batch and it called for 1/4 cup confectioners sugar but I like them a little sweeter so I did a 1/3 cup instead.  I creamed the margarine and sugar ( yes I used margarine in all my baking) for a long time as suggested and added a capful of almond extract.  Instead of rolling them I made small balls that I flattened to about 1/2 in. thick.  Looking back I could have made them flatter because my cooking time ended up being 24 minutes ( my oven is brand new and it seems like everything always takes longer to bake in a new oven).  It may not help anyone else to bake them this way but I'll need a reference so I can make them perfect again next time because I'll definitely be making them again!

WOW! I just pulled a couple of batches of this shortbread out of the oven. It is absolutely perfect, and I have never made shortbread before. I needed something quick and easy for a last-minute bake sale and this took no time whatsoever and tastes incredible. I doubled the recipe and added about 2 tsp of lemon extract. My house smells heavenly right now!

Personally I did not enjoy this recipe.  I read the reviews and took all the tips under advisement.  These were just not how I am used to shortbread tasting.  To me shortbread is buttery and flavorful and these, to me, tasted more like baked cookie dough.

I was in the mood for cookies but i had no vanilla or eggs.  Thought i'd give these a try, and in the middle of mashing up the butter company arrived.  perfect timing or what?  I don't have a rolling pin so i floured up a wine bottle and rolled out the dough.  These were really good fresh out of the oven.  They took about nine minutes to get slightly brown on the edge of the thinnest cookie, but since there were no eggs i didn't really worry about them being undercooked, i like a soft cookie anyway.  flaky and buttery and my boyfriend and his roomate loved them.  Only problem....i got a blister from creaming all that butter.  =(

These were just OK for me (boyfriend and kids liked them, though)...I thought the dough was hard to work with (sticky) and the finished cookies were a bit bland and pasty. On the other hand, if you need to whip up a quick cookie and don't have any eggs on hand, it's not a bad recipe. I rolled my cookies into balls, flattened slightly, and decorated with colored sugar before baking.

I made this and Scottish Shortbread 4 this weekend (also very good).  Very light and melt-in-your-moouth, but compared to 4, a little lacking in flavor.  I may add vanilla if I do this one again.

A huge hit with my fella- I have been ordered never to let these run out! I add a little almond extract to give them a bit more flavour and it goes lovely! I am going to experiment by adding different flavourings and maybe some flaked coconut. I make these larger so I have to cook them for longer. A crumbly but not too dry texture so good for my mother-in-law with false teeth too!

Great tasting and looking cookie. Dough was easy to work, roll and cut. No refrigeration needed prior to cutting with cookie cutters. Iced with a mixture of 1/2 canned white icing and 1/2 corn syrup.  Makes a nice, shiny coating that is easy for decorated sugar to stick on.  Allow the icing to dry completely before storing.  Thanks for an easy, buttery tasting cookie.

Baked mine in a round pan so i could cut into eight wedges, turned out pretty good. Had to bake about 50min. Think it need more butter to make it a little more flaky. Anyone who tried it gave it a 7 out of 10. Defently one of the better recipes out there.

Sorry, I just wasn't crazy about these. I felt that the cookies were a little too sweet, and boring. Though I guess that's to be expected of shortbread? Anyhow, I've definitely made and tasted better.

We made it exactly as listed, and it made wonderful shortbread cookies for Santa, especially with really sweet icing!  My hubby and kiddo loved it....but next time, if weâ€™re not doing iced cookies, Iâ€™m going to add a tad more butter and sugar (and maybe salt), but very little, just to experiment.  Even if I donâ€™t, it will be delicious!!

Excellent! Finally, a shortbread recipe that totally reminds me of my childhood. I made it exactly as per the recipe and the shortbread was just as crumbly and melt in your mouth as I remember. Creaming the butter and icing sugar together for a good 5-6 minutes definitely helps. Delicious!

This was easy to make and they taste pretty good. I rolled the dough into little balls and flattened them with a fork instead of flattening the dough and using cookie cutters. It takes about 12 minutes to cook them that way but this is a good base for dough that can take some variations. Also it made nearly 3 dozen not the two dozen.

Simple and very good. As written this make a fairly soft shortbread, for crunchy about double the cooking time is needed. The dough is not at all sticky, so shaping this is much easier than some other shortbread recipes I have tried.

Excellent shortbread, very tender.  Rolls nicely, but be sure you have PLENTY of flour on your board, it sticks pretty quickly.  If you are using cookie cutters rather than making bars, the extra time it takes can let the flour absorb into all that buttery richness!

This recipe was excellent.  I followed the recipe but took the advice of another member who suggested dropping the cookies on a cookie sheet and pressing them with a fork, rather than rolling them out and cutting them.  These cookies melted in our mouths.  They were a perfect shortbread.

Hi! I recently made these cookies they were really good but I had to add another 2 cups of flour to be able to roll them at least. They took longer to cook but that was fine I will use it again they were delicious! great cut out cookies for making with your kids maybe I will add more icing sugar next time.

Smelled wonderful, tastes great but I couldn't get these to roll out successfully at all.  Finally, just did drop cookies.

My mother requested some shortbread for a christmas gift. I've never been a big fan of the Walker's shortbread cookies, so I'm not entirely sure what good shortbread is. That being said, I liked this recipe. Since I was testing a recipe, I halved the recipe. It was really easy to make. I just made drop cookies. They were so good just a few minutes out of the oven. Delicate cookies. I sent the rest to work with my husband so I wouldn't eat the whole batch by myself.

This cookie was just not sweet enough for me. I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and they still weren't sweet enough for me. Maybe they are supposed to be only slightly sweet?  
The dough was very easy to work with though.  It was not crumbly at all and was very smooth and silky.  They baked well in the oven.  I might try these again...only with more sugar.

Very yummy.. Melting in mouth and so delicate... I would add a little bit more flour and sugar. I can't wait to try this dipped in chocolate and I also plan on making these savory.

So simple and very delicious. The dough was a little sticky to work with, but I just added extra flour to my surface when rolling.

This recipe used few ingredients, but tastes great with a few alterations.  I didn't have powdered sugar, so I used a blend of white and brown sugar.  I also sprinkled sugar on the top after rolling the dough into balls (like regular cookies... as suggested by someone else).  They had to bake for 20 minutes at 350, but I'd make them again.  They aren't too sweet and are very easy to make.  I think it's a great recipe to make with kids as well.
