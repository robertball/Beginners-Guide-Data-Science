What isn't to love!  Adjust cooking time for the size of your Asparagus.  About 10 minutes was good for mine.  Enjoy!

These are delicious; you can really make people fight over asparagus! Roasted asparagus is one of my all time favorites.  But the flavor is greatly enhanced by allowing the stalks to caramelize in a hot oven.  So I crank the oven to 550 degrees or I use the grill outside. It may seem excessive, but trust me, you want to try this variation.  Use a rimmed baking sheet. (Never use a glass casserole above 425 degrees).  Buy stalks no thicker than a number two pencil.  Trim off the bottom ~third of the stalk so you're left with only the tender end.  Forget garlic - it will burn.  Toss the room temperature stalks in some (~1/8 cup) olive oil, kosher salt, pepper and a bit of some freshly ground nutmeg.  Nutmeg is one of those secret ingredients that disappears into the food but points-up the flavor of the vegetable. (Try it on spinach, too) NOTE: lay the asparagus side-by-side on the pan in a single layer or they will create steam and not caramelize. Right before dinner, put them in the oven. In 6 or 7 minutes they'll be slightly crispy. You will make some smoke so you'll need the kitchen exhaust fan on high.  Parmigiano Reggiano is optional.  I use a rasp to create a snowy texture, and then sprinkle it as soon as they come out of the oven. It melts instantly. But it's almost like 'Gilding the Lilly' because caramelized asparagus has plenty of flavor as-is.

I used olive oil rather than the cooking spray and set my oven timer for 10 minutes - when it came out of the oven I was discouraged. Uh-oh, I thought.  Hubs will never go for this shriveled up, dried-up looking asparagus, so I sliced him up a tomato as a back-up.  Truth be told, I didn't think it would work for me either. But surprise, surprise, it was delicious! Roasting it with the Parmesan rather than sprinkling it on afterward is what made this so interesting and different. Still, next time I'd start off setting that timer for a few minutes less.

A wonderful side dish that is simple to make. In a separate nonstick pan, saut√©ed 1/3 cup pine nuts until golden, about 4 minutes. Used them to garnish the roasted asparagus along with a touch of freshly squeezed lemon juice.

This is a really simple and easy dish to make. If you have a small convection oven like I do, you can just make it in there instead. I basically just folded aluminum foil into a small version of a casserole dish because I didn't feel like washing anything, oiled the foil with olive oil and washed the asparagus before seasoning it. Takes about 10-12 minutes depending on how crunchy you want it. WARNING: make sure that the top head of the spear is well oiled or else it will turn out feeling like a bristle and scratchy.

Very good!  I just used a bag of frozen asparagus.  It's easy to just put asparagus in a gallon bag, use 1-2 tbsp of olive oil or melted butter (omitting the cooking spray) and other ingredients in, close the bag and shake it up and work it around good and then drop in the pan.  I did add a little extra parmesan and cooked it from frozen for about 17 minutes.  Yummy.  My husband who really dislikes asparagus ate it all up and said it was good.

Fast and easy to make.  I didn't measure anything. Just used my own judgement with the garlic powder, salt and Parmesean cheese.  It turned out great. Wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company.

This yielded a "this is the best asparagus I've ever eaten" from my husband...so YAY for this one!  I used a cookie sheet (with raised edges) to prepare.  Put a small amount of olive oil (about 1 tbls) into the pan, added little balsamic vinegar (maybe 1 tsp), stirred them together and spread over the pan, and then rolled the asparagus in it to coat.  Then sprinkled with sea salt and placed in oven. While it cooked, I toasted about 3 tbls of sesame seeds and sprinkled them on the asparagus when it was done (which took about 12 mins).  This added a nice flavor and texture.  We dubbed it "freckled asparagus," and I've been requested to make it again soon.  Thanks for this great recipe.  A wonderful alternative to steaming.

I love this recipe- it was very good!  It does not need as much salt as it calls for because sea salt is "saltier" than table salt and the Parmesan has saltiness.

Depending on the thickness of your asparagus (start or end of season) watch for doneness. Sometimes 12min was plenty and other times not enough. Simple and tasty.

I have been roasting asparagus for a long time, but it always got overdone while waiting for the other menu items. This time I chose thicker stems than I usually do, and the timing of the recipe was very helpful. Needless to say, adjust cooking time for the caliper of the asparagus. My asparagus came out "perfect!" A little of the Himalayan pink salt ground at serving, along with the garlic and Parmesan while roasting, set this dish off. No need for anything else - let the asparagus shine! It was wonderful! Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was a great alternative to steaming which was the only way I cooked asparagus up to this point.  I didn't have any olive oil cooking spray on hand so I just tossed the asparagus in about 2 tbls of evoo and it did the trick.

I can't tell you how many times i have made this recipe! I like to use smaller thinner asparagus because it can get crispy in the oven. Yum! My family is very picky when it comes to veggies and this one works every time.

Yummy!  If there is one thing I dislike it is mushy asparagus.  This came out with plenty of flavor and plenty of "crunch".  We loved it and I will make this again.

Couldn't believe how good this was... Seriously. My husband and I made pork chops and asparagus for dinner...and the asparagus stole the limelight! 

Didn't and wouldn't change a thing. This was fabulous!

Excellent!!  I used one crushed garlic clove instead of powder and olive oil in lieu of the spray. I also added a couple twists of fresh ground peppercorn  Came out perfect.  Will be making this again...often.  Thanks Diane.

I used a sea-salt-garlic grinder instead of the garlic powder, and real olive oil instead of the spray.  It was good, but lacking something.  Next time we will drizzle with fresh lemon juice straight out of the oven - I think a bit of acid will make it "pop!"

Perfect cooking method letting the flavor of the asparagus shine through.  My asparagus were a little thin, so, it only took about 8 minutes to cook.

Excellent!! Only change I made was to substitute the cooking spray with olive oil.  I drizzled oil over stalks and then rolled in pan to evenly coat.

Really delicious. Keep an eye on the oven; it's easy to leave the dish in too long if you have an oven that runs a little hot, as I do.

YUMMMMMMM!  This is such an easy delicious way to prepare asparagus.  My family is not into tons of flavors, we like classic dishes and this definitely fit the bill.  My husband and son both ate the asparagus which was my goal!  I eat it the day after as well, but it is a big soggy by then.  I recommend not making more than you intend to eat that day.

Loved this recipe!  I usually toss asparagus in olive oil and sprinkle some montreal steak spice on it, then grill it in a basket on the bbq, but when I don't feel like bbqing I will definitely use this recipe...I just used my no fail montreal steak spice with the parmesean cheese instead of the other suggested spices...yummy! My family love this recipe!

Love this.  I used real olive oil instead of spray only because I was afraid of drying out the stalks.  Great taste and you can adjust the level of seasonings to suit your tastes.  Thank you!  P.S. mine took only 10 min, but I like it a little firmer.

I like asparagus steamed but this is even better; I took others suggestions by using olive oil instead of spray; I just sprinkled salt and garlic powder on until it felt right so I probably used less salt than called for but to make up I used 1/2 cup of freshly shredded Parmesan.  The asparagus only took about 10 minutes in the oven.  Had great taste and perfect texture plus some of the cheese had started turning crispy for a delicious bonus.

This is a quick, easy and awesome choice for week night meals... I cook this about once a week for the family.  I've cooked asparagus every way possible, grilled, steamed, but this is the best way to cook it by far... and easier and much more tasty. I use cooking spray to cut the calories and some organic granulated garlic... shredded parmesan is a nice option too.  Delicious.

Made as is except used olive oil (not the spray). My asparagus took a bit longer to cook to tender. I just kept checking so that it wouldn't get overcooked.

I have made this receipe for a long time now my family loves it I use Garlic Garni that I purchase from the states it has a lot of different spices mixed with the garlic you can also use an all dressed version of the garlic garni gives it a lot more flavour, some time for a special treat I will add Shredded 3 cheese on the top just as it finishes cooking and then put it back into the oven until melted Wonderful Junebug

I baked this at 425 for 7 minutes because I paired it with "Baked Parmesan Tilapia" from this site which bakes at 425. This worked out just fine. (Wonderful pairing by the way... I highly recommend it.)I've always steamed or grilled my asparagus so I wasn't sure what to expect texture-wise from roasting it in the oven. I can honestly say that i prefer this method now. I followed the ingredients as listed and i wouldn't change a thing. I really liked how the roasting affected the texture of the Parmesan.

I used frozen asparagus thawed and dried with a paper towel.  I baked it one more minute because my husband and I like the asparagus soft.  It tasted delicious and it was so easy to do.  The garlic powder and parmesan and sea salt gave a delightful flavor to the asparagus.

Excellent and so easy! I used my Pampered Chef baking dish that has the grates so the asparagus didn't sit on the bottom and get soggy (any baking rack would work in a pan). Followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!

I rolled the asparagus in a big bowl with olive oil, salt and pepper instead of using a spray.  Thanksgiving side dish, was very delightful.

If you want the  cheese to coat the asparagus, use fresh shredded parmesan. Canned grated cheese will still give good flavor, but not coated asparagus.

I used garlic infused olive oil instead of garlic powder and baked at 375 along with rolls and it came out just fine. Great taste and it is an easy to make spring vegetable.

I used garlic-infused olive oil instead of garlic powder. Did not add salt while cooking but let everyone sprinkle with maladon salt flakes to take. That made it really special!

I'm not a big fan of asparagus but this blend of flavors and method of preparation make it tasty! I added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice just before removing it from the oven. Will probably just follow the directions as written next time.

Yum! Bought a big bag of asparagus at costco. Did this to the whole thing. Took a little longer for my batch. Served it twice for dinner reheated with more cheese. and the leftover got chopped and added to a quiche. Love to prep ahead and this recipe does that great!!

I followed the recipe exactly; however, sometimes I'll throw in a different cheese when I'm out of parmesan.  Gouda works amazing.  My teenager takes seconds.

Very good.  No fresh parmesan, so I used the flaked kind.  I would definitely fix this again.

I will definitely make this again! Even the kids loved it. The only change I made was tossing it in about a tablespoon of olive oil, because I don't have any olive oil cooking spray.

I hated Asparagus and so did my wife until we tried this oven roasted asparagus. It was delicious. We are now both Asparagus fans. Thank you for this recipe. We have started on a Keto Zone Diet and are trying to make drastic changes to our foods. This one fit right in. Great as an appetizer or a light meal snack.

Five stars for flavor. I think it would have cooked better in a sheet pan as my one pound overlapped in the 9x13.  We like them very tender and at 15 minutes was not cooked enough for us but other dinner items were ready.  Halved some mushrooms and roasted those with asparagus.  Will DEFINITELY make again but on a sheet pan for more even cooking.

Modified it just a bit by drizzling EVOO over the top and then grating aged Manchego on top before baking. Perfect side dish!

This recipe is excellent.  The only change I made was I added a few tsp. of lemon juice.

I made this tonight to go alongside roasted ranch potatoes and the grilled salmon II recipe from this site. I didn't use a full one quarter cup of parmesan, but it was excellent. This is going into our rotation. Thanks!

This was really good!  I grew up on canned asparagus, blech. Now I know how to prepare it correctly, we will be having this a lot!  Make sure you watch how much salt you are using; sprinkles, not shakes.

A great way to cook asparagus.  Only addition was a little bit of pepper.

Very delicious.  I simply love Asparagus any kind of way they're cooked. I sprayed the pan with olive oil but I also used a couple drops of EVOO while I was mixing the Asparagus in the ingredients. Also, I sprinkled minced garlic on top of them after placing them in the pan. As a bonus I added sliced mushrooms and cooked them along too. It was very good. The downside: next time I will cut down on the salt. One teaspoon was way too much. Thanks Diane for the recipe.

This was very tasty!  I followed the recipe except that I listened to other reviews and didn't cook it quite as long.  I only cooked it 10 minutes and it was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe has become my favorite way to make asparagus.  I've used fresh grated Parmesan or Romano cheese, and have made it a few times without the garlic powder and didn't miss it. I've used asparagus cooked this way not only as a side dish, but have also chilled it for later use in salads and omelettes.

This was good, I used thinly sliced garlic instead of powder, added some green onion black pepper. Easy on the salt as the cheese is salty as well.

This was amazing! The only change i made was to toss the asparagus with a couple tablespoons of olive oil and the spices. Used fresh shredded parmesean and made a lovely accompaniment to grilled chicken.

The recipe exceeded my expectations and was very easy to make.  I did heed one commenter's advice about making sure the asparagus tips were well coated with olive oil.  I actually trimmed the stalks and then turned the bunch, tips down, into a large measuring cup filled with enough olive oil to soak the tips.  When I was ready to roast, I used a basting brush to spread olive oil from the measuring cup on the bottom of the pan, laid the asparagus on that and then used the brush again to baste the stalks with the remaining oil from the measuring cup.  Then added the other ingredients.  It is now on my rotation for regular side dishes.

Love asparagus fixed this way. Mine took only 8 min. I  skipped the salt. Drizzled olive oil instead of spray and used parchment paper on top of cookie sheet to bake. YUM!

Love this! I make 2 different changes. I add sliced garlic cloves while cooking instead of powder. Also "grated" Parmesan cheese after it comes out instead of adding shredded cheese before cooking.  Finger licking good!

This has got to be the simplest recipe ever.  I have never enjoyed asparagus until fairly recently because it was so tough and chewy.  But grilling it this way softens the stalks and the Parmesan gives the asparagus a bit more flavour.

The only changes I made was I used olive oil instead of the spray and in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes.  Absolutely great. I have made it this way ever since.  Thanks for the recipe.

Tossed with olive oil instead of spraying with cooking spray.  Exceptional and easy.   Would make it again and again!

I knew 1 tsp. of salt would be way too much for us, so I made this with 1/4 tsp. of salt and a little sunflower oil instead of cooking spray (about 1 tsp of oil, but I think even 1/2 tsp. would work) and otherwise made it as stated, and loved it.!  Cooking time was about  20 minutes in my oven.  (They were not "pencil thin" asparagus.)

The best!  This is now my "Go To" asparagus recipe.  Probably used extra garlic (I always do), but made the rest of the recipe as directed.  Took 17 min. in oven.

Delicious!!!  I used real olive oil instead of the spray and a clove of minced garlic rather than garlic powder.  Next time I will use less salt--we found a teaspoon to be too much for our tastes.  As always, the better the parmesan, the better the outcome.  10 minutes was perfect.  Very easy and good.

This was so amazingly wonderful! Years ago, a friend served us asparagus a similar way, and I was thinking of it tonight when I searched for a way to roast asparagus.  This was exactly what I was looking for!  It is so simple. I will be making it again and again.

Easy and awesome. My Granddaughter HATES asparagus out of the can but she loves this. We have this at least 3 or 4 times a month. Sometimes squeeze a little lemon juice on it when it comes out of the oven.

Never liked asparagus till now. Changed things a little to suit personal taste but great recipe as it stands. Deleted pepper and salt , reduced olive oil to 2TBS,  changed garlic to 3/4 TBS minced garlic. Shortened cooking time to make them more crispy. After cooking sprayed lemon juice and added last 1/2 TBS of cheese. Reduces calories and Sodium content. I like foods clean and simple.  Still a work in progress

I have made this on several occasions & will continue to make it. It is one of the best asparagus recipes I've tried. The only change I make is to also use fresh cracked black pepper on it as well. Absolutely delicious!

Simple and delicious. I made it as directed.
I saw other recipes that were similar but included minced garlic. I think I will try that next time just to give it a little more flavor, but it is good as is.

This was perfect. And couldn't have been easier! I put just a sprinkle of ground pepper on it too before I realized it wasn't on the ingredients list, and it tasted great!

This has long been our family's favorite for asparagus. ALL of us- hubby and 5 kiddos- LOVE it! It isn't bad if if you have to use the cheap sprinkle type parm either as we have done on a few occasions when we forgot to pick up the good stuff. THANKS!

My boyfriend can't stop eating it. We added some pepper and extra cheese, and used regular olive oil rather than the spray. Turned out awesome!

Doubled the batch(and time to cook). Sea salt REALLY made a difference. Drizzled olive oil before cooking(didn't have spray). Results were fantastic.

Very simple and delicious!  I roasted the asparagus first, then tossed with a little butter (instead of oil) and parmesan, salt and garlic powder.  Perfect way to serve asparagus!

Good basic instructions for roasting asparagus.  Guests who have said they don't like asparagus have liked it prepared this way.  The flavor of the parmesan did not stand out.  Next time I will try adding it in the last few minutes and reserve some to add at the table.  If you're on a budget you can leave the parmesan out and it still tastes great.

I had some fresh asparagus in the fridge and was needing to make a quick side dish, this recipe was a hit!  My husband loved the freshness and nutty taste that the parm. cheese added.  Will definitely prepare this again.

This is some of the most flavorful asparagus I have eaten. Normally, I don't go too crazy over it, but it was my favorite thing on the entire plate! I could eat it by itself. Thank you for the simple recipe. I did what a few other reviewers did also by the way and coated my asparagus with lemon juice to help it retain its color. Worked and also gave the asparagus a bit of added flavor. Will most certainly make this again!

There isn't much to say except: quick, easy, tasty! I followed the recipe exactly, and the result was great! My only complaint would be that it's a tad on the greasy side for me. But dabbing them with paper towels before serving takes care of a lot of that!

I like the roasting method and the flavor was fine, but boy was it SALTY! I has thought to cut the salt in half, but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time. Being as parmesan cheese is already salty, on its own, I might try it again but use just a 1/4 of a tsp. of salt.

Great side dish for anything!  I combined one red pepper for color and flavor.  It complimented the pork tenderloin creamy herb dish very nicely!

This was a good flavor combination.  I used a premade black pepper-garlic combo instead of just garlic powder.  I just wasn't impressed with how the asparagus ended up; the roasting seemed to take away from its awesome natural flavor and texture.  I'll probably stick to blanching--faster and tastes better.

Loved it. Used Olive oil because I did not have pam and used fresh garlic instead. We love asparagus and this is a keeping. Color remained bright green and a healthy crispiness was an added bonus.

Our friend Shawn taught me how to cook this recipe, although without the garlic powder. I think that garlic powder would be a nice addition when the asparagus is accompanying a strong flavoured main dish. Either way, I really love asparagus cooked this way.

This was a nice, simple dish but actually ranks low on my favorite ways to prepare asparagus. The Parmesan didn't seem to really match the flavor of the asparagus, though the garlic powder brought a nice element to it. I don't think I'll make this again but it's not a bad recipe; simply a matter of taste.

I use olive oil, also, rather than the spray, and I also squeeze a little fresh lemon juice over the asparagus.  Another tasty method is to create the dish in foil and cook on the grill for 10 minutes.

Good recipe I had to use oil , had no spray I will be getting some soon because they were to oily, but good flavor and the cheese browned up nice and were very nutty, cooking time will very depending on the thickness of your stalks mine were very thin so had to watch them closely.

Absolutely the best and deserves a 5 star rating. Ordinarily I have hollandaise sauce with asparagus but no longer. I wanted to eliminate the hollandaise sauce because of calories & fat and this fit the bill.

I cooked it for 10 minutes.  It wasn't done so I put it back in for 5 more minututes.  I had to do that 4 times, and it still wasn't tender.  I couldn't eat the lower half of the spear because it was too hard.  The top part was ok, but nothing to write home about.  It really needed to be steamed.

Make sure to adjust cooking time to the thickness of your asparagus. Otherwise, this is a terrific and easy way to prepare asparagus.

These were absolutely delicious!  I love asparagus just plain steamed, but this really added something to it.  In fact, my mom was here for dinner when I made this and she is not an asparagus fan.  At least she wasn't until she tried this recipe... she even went back for seconds!

Loved this recipe!  I drizzled a little bit of olive oil just to wet it a bit and it was delicious!  My kids loved it too!

Delicious! Did not have shred parm, used a quatro-cheese blend and it was great! Will make again. So simple.
