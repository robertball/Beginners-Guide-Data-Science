This bread baked beautifully! As I began mixing the ingredients, I realized I was out of olive oil so I used coconut oil in it's place. I added milk chocolate chips and cut the recipe in half to make one loaf instead of two. All in all, it's good.

Yummy! I followed other reviewers advise by not adding as much sugar. Plus I added walnuts and raisins like another reviewer suggested. I made one loaf and made muffins with this one recipe batch. They both turned out beautifully and taste wonderful! I baked cupcake size muffins for about 17 minutes, let them rest a bit out of the oven in the pan before transferring them to a cooling rack. They came out perfect.

Made a double batch with my freshly baked and puréed pumpkin.  Since batch was doubled I added 2 cups of chopped walnuts at the end. I have 6 bread pans in the oven baking right now. Can’t wait to sink my teeth into a slice! Smells heavenly!

Cut the recipe in half to only make one loaf. Personally, I prefer regular banana bread without the pumpkin, but the pumpkin was still good!

This is a keeper! I also cut down on the sugar to 1 cup white and 1/2 c brown and 2 cups flour as we are also cutting down on sugar. It is delicious ! Made 2 nice size loads.

I will definitely make this again!  My husband prefers sweeter, but since we're trying to cut sugar we only used 1 cup instead of 3 and 1/2 cup less of the flour and it turned out perfect.  He adds sweet things to his individual servings and I get to have mine at a more tamed sweetness.  It's really tasty both ways!

Delicious! I did, however, cut way back on the amount of sugar when I made the bread. The three cups it called for is over the top. I put in a scant 1 2/3 cup and it was plenty sweet. I didn't "play" with the ingredients other than that one difference. I will make it again and add Craisins or mini-chocolate chips, pecans or a combo thereof.

I made this recipe today, with a couple changes based on what I had on hand. I used 3 Tbsp Pumpkin Pie Spice, rather than the individual spices, and used 1 cup coconut palm sugar and 1 cup confectioners sugar in place of the 3 cups white sugar. The end result was *perfect*! So moist that it almost fell apart, but not quite. (In the correct loaf pan, I didn’t have 2 of the same loaf pans, so my second was a wider, shallower loaf pan, and that one did fall apart easily.) And with just 2 cups of sugar, it was plenty sweet for us. As a child, I would eat banana bread for breakfast, but with 3 cups of sugar, this would definitely be more of a dessert bread, IMO. I just need to find/develop a healthier version because my family of 5 ate 3/4 of the batch in one day!

This was really good! I halved the recipe to make one loaf, and did substitute extra bananas for the oil which made the banana flavour a bit strong. Next time I will make it with the oil to see if the pumpkin flavour comes on stronger.

It's good but next time, I'd add a little salt to it. Other than that it came out good. The consistency was good as well. I just made a large pan instead of 2 loaves.

It was moist and delicious! I couldn't find one of my 9x5 pans, so I used one 9x13 pan and baked it for 55 minutes. Thank you for this recipe it will be a staple at our house.

I've had this identical recipe for years, making it as just pumpkin bread.  Adding the bananas makes it even better!!  Make two loaves, the first will disappear quickly!

I've made this so many times this year!  Thank you for sharing. I made a few adjustments (nuts, brown suger) but noting to compromise this recipe!! ??
