Why do people like Dee say they made a recipe but the completely change all the main ingredients? Then they say it's not good. I made it and it's very good. I don't like caraway seed, so I left that out, but that was optional. Serving suggestions by the original poster are exactly right on.

Great dish.  I made the recipe as described, but cooked in it in the slow cooker, and added 1/2 cup apple juice so it wouldn't dry out.  Will make again.

My family loves sauerkraut and they said this was the best recipe yet!  I followed the recipe, except I used 2-2 lb bags (4 lb) of sauerkraut (I mentioned my family likes sauerkraut...).  I did not double the remaining ingredients.  I put the sauerkraut in my large crockpot, sauteed the bacon and onion and then added it with the sugar and apple.  I did not use caraway.  I browned some country ribs and placed them on top along with several smoked sausage (I like brats, but, only had the smoked sausage).  I let it slow cook all day.  I made mashed Yukon Gold potatoes to go along with the meal.  The family raved about it!  Thanks for the recipe!

My rating is based on the actual recipe given.  This is a classic, homestyle recipe with great flavors.  The only thing I did differently after tasting the original is add a pinch of salt and pepper.  Very nice recipe, thanks for sharing it.

Great recipe!  Our whole family enjoyed this dish.  I would definitely recommend using the caraway seeds.

I made this exactly according to recipe, cooking this in my cast iron skillet so it could go from stovetop to oven easily. I used Uncle Charley's sausage in this recipe and I served this with Meme's Mashed Potatoes. Not only did I love it but so did my husband and kids. Surprized the heck out of me, I thought for sure they'd hate it. NO leftovers and the boys asked me to make this again soon.

This was so good. I made it in the slow cooker. Cooked and crumbled the bacon then just threw it all in with about a half cup of apple juice as another reviewer suggested. Turned out perfect served over mashed potatoes. Will make this one often!

Best kraut and sausage I've ever had! I omitted caraway seed because I didn't have any on hand and I sliced the onions instead of chopping them. It was a tad on the greasy side so next time I will either take the time to pat the meat dry with paper towels or maybe just cut back on the amount of meat to give my wallet and my arteries a break. And for the love of all that is holy don't substitute Italian sausage for kielbasa like one reviewer did on here. Or do so if you wish; just don't leave a review.

I had issues with the sauerkraut getting slightly burnt on the bottom, I don't get how you put drained food into a pot and expect it to "simmer"? So I added water to prevent further burning. Though next time I may use some wine to do the job. Other than that difficulty, this recipe gets five stars for tasting AMAZING and working perfectly for my high protein needs

My family was very happy to evaluate this meal today.  There were a couple of variations made to it.  He used 1 lb. Big Red Smokies instead of 1 1/2 lbs. kielbasa.  The apple was a large Cameo.  He used 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp. of caraway seeds (we would not recommend you to omit it).  He felt you should start the bacon about 3 minutes before adding the onions.  The smell while this is cooking is out of this world!!!  Delicious!  Our son who won't eat kraut ate this dish.  We all loved it and hope to serve it very soon again.

What I learned about this recipe is just how tender sauerkraut becomes when cooked for a good long time.  The addition of the sugar and apple mitigates the sourness of the sauerkraut while the bacon tempers the sweetness, adding a much appreciated earthy smokiness.  Simply said, we loved this.

I made this today and was very pleased.  I never tried polish food before.  This came out very well and was not greasy.  Everyone loved it and there was nothing leftover.  I only added more caraway--other than that I didn't change a thing.  Also made pierogies.  Will definitely make again!

I did not add the apple and omitted the bacon.  Also, I substituted Italian sausage for the Kielbasa.  I feel that kielbasa is too greasy.  Came out great.

Delish!  I used the saute mode on my slow cooker and cooked the bacon and onion, then browning the kielbasa.  I drained (but did not rinse) the sauerkraut to achieve the "tang" that we enjoy.  I then mixed the bacon-onion mixture with the sauerkraut in a large bowl.  I then layered the sauerkraut mixture, browned kielbasa, sauerkraut mixture, and the remaining kielbasas.  I set the slow cooker on low for 5 hours--the best sauerkraut and kielbasa ever!!

I used Bavarian Style sauerkraut since it already has the carroway seeds, but it is a little sweet, so I'm wondering if that's why this dish turned out a little sweeter than I would have liked. I remedied it with some cayenne pepper and a little tabasco sauce.

This was wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly but put everything in the crock pot, I did add 1/2 cup apple sauce after a few hours because it seemed a little dry, that made it moist and terrific!  I will definately be making this again and often!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This a fabulous recipe. Thanks for sharing. I cooked the bacon, cut it up, then sauteed the onion in the drippings. I added that with all the other ingredients, and put in the slow cooker. I didn't add apple juice as other readers suggested. This was an awesome dish. Part of family routine now. :D Husband is German too and said sauerkraut was much better than his mom used to make :D

This is the best sauerkraut recipe I have ever used. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly except for the bacon which I didn't have on hand.  The Caraway Seed just added a wonderful flavor.  My family raved over this recipe.

I didn't use the apples and didn't have time to cook it as long as suggested.  I simmered the sauerkraut for about 45 minutes and cooked it in the oven for about 45 minutes.  My husband still loved it.

Growing up in a German-Ukrainian household, kielbasa and sauerkraut was a common meal for us.  Wanted to try a new recipe.  It was delicious---far best I ever had.  Even my Italian husband, who doesn't care for sauerkraut enjoyed it.  I cooked it just like the recipe said, with the exception of caraway seeds because I do not like them.  The apple gave the kraut an incredible taste and the kielbasa was extremely tasty, prepared this way.  Had to share this recipe with my German mother.

Excellent.  Rinsing the sauerkraut removes the bite, but the flavor is still there.
All flavors work very well together

I was looking for something to jazz up polish sausage and sauerkraut.  The apple, brown sugar and caraway did the trick,  Potato pancakes as a side - perfect!

Really great hearty meal.  My son even asked for seconds!
I also ended up adding a little apple juice to the kraut mixture as it cooked...it seemed a bit dry as I cooked it down.  

I decided to fry the bacon by itself, then saute the onion in the bacon fat, removed the onion to the kraut mixture, then browned my polish sausage in the remaining fat.  An extra step for sure, but it allowed me to render the bacon fat the way I wanted it without having to worry about my onion burning.  Then when all was combined, I didn't see the point of heating up the oven, so I just kept it covered on low for 15-20 min, and the flavors melded together beautifully.  
Will definitely make again...probably sooner than later.

I made it as written and absolutely loved it.  My German friends say they always cook sauerkraut for hours and are surprised the way Americans barely cook it.  This was like candy, just wish I had doubled the sauerkraut!

I followed the recipe as written with the exception of not draining the sauerkraut. I felt the bacon masked the subtler flavor of the sauerkraut and overpowered the whole dish. I love bacon but I was hoping for more tang.

I got brave and made this recipe (for the first time) for a group we were having for New Year's Day.  Everyone absolutely LOVED it - and I didn't make any changes!!!  They think I'm an outstanding cook!  :)

Absolutely loved this!!! Made the day before my party and kept warm in a sterno. I used 4 lbs of kraut, did add the caraway which really adds major flavor. I used a tart granny smith apple, a full pound of bacon, and more than 3 lbs of turkey kielbasa . Very nice dish to serve a crowd and great for pot lucks. Delicious!

Make it for my wife and group of close friends.  My wife has not been a fan of sauerkraut until she tasted this.  She and my friends all loved it.  One  said she was in heaven while eating it.  The diced apples made all the difference.  I used two instead of one.

I made this as written, except for the caraway seeds, which I didn't have and don't really care for.  This is the best Sauerkraut I've ever tasted.  My hubby never like Sauerkraut til now. I shared some with a friend of mine and she couldn't stop raving about how wonderful it was.  Thanks for such a YUMMY Recipe.  I'll be adding it to my regular rotation!

OMG... this was the best thing since, sliced bread!!! first I must tell you that I can not cook, not really. I did the apple juice instead of the apple, bought the sauerkraut out of the cold section, the stuff in the bag and used a crock pot. The only thing that would have made this better, would be to cook it the day before, then heat it back up in the crock pot again. Day One this was great, but day two... oh my on day two it was like heaven, all the flavor had a chance to works its way in. 11 people ate almost the whole crock pot full and we had a lot of other food!!

This was my first time working with sauerkraut.  I found the white variety in a jar.  It didn't take long before some of it got scorched to the pan so I lost some of the sauerkraut, onions, and apples because of that.  It didn't have much liquid to bake in the oven with either.  Even with my little snags, it still came out pretty good served over mashed redskin potatoes.  Next time I will try the slow cooker and add some apple juice as another reviewer suggested.

Very good!  I accidentally purchased the "sweetened" sauerkraut which already had sugar and caraway seeds included so I just omitted them from the recipe.  We definitly could have used more bacon but we are bacon lovers. and maybe 1 and 1/2 apples next time.  Will make this again!

This is a good recipe for sausage and kraut, when cooking the sauerkraut I added a bottle of ale beer, and a teaspoon of caraway seeds instead of a tablespoon, and instead of beer you can use chicken broth also.Or just plain water.  And for the bacon and and onion I used half an onion, and a little less bacon. But I don't suggest you cook the kraut without liquid. I use this all the time and yes I am German.

I doubled the recipe except for the caraway seeds and brown sugar as I don't like things that sweet and my family would be turned off by too strong a taste of caraway.  Cooked the bacon before adding the onions as the first batch the bacon did not brown and the onions were done.   Only baked for 45 minutes as we were hungry and all was good.  Delicious!

I made this for our family Christmas Dinner party.   I used fresh and smoked kielbasa and added just a little apple juice.  I quadrupled the recipe.  Everyone loved it and raved about it.  I will definitely make this again.   Sooo good!

After living in Bavaria for two years and traveling to Germany often for work, there are few dishes in the US that I would declare worthy of a good German beer; this recipe is definitely one of them!!!  It was awesome!!  More work than most of my dinners, but worth every minute.  The girls (7 & under and picky) hated it of course.  My son (9) thought it was okay.  My husband liked it.  I had leftovers for lunch the next day and they were even better than the night before.  If you are looking for a taste of Germany (to go along with a history lesson or just something different) this recipe is a great one to try.  I told my kids to take a deep breath over their plates before they ate - that was the smell of a traditional German restaurant, minus the stale beer.  :)
I made this recipe using my mother-in-law's homemade sauerkraut, store bought turkey kielbasa, and bacon.  I did not add caraway seeds because I didn't have any.  Turkey bacon might be a viable alternative for those with pork sensitivities.  Some reviewers said they had problems with the kraut burning while simmering.  I used a tall, heavy 2 quart pot on a medium-low heat and had no issues, even though the kraut seemed on the dry side at first.  The apples created just enough juice on the bottom.  I served it with buttered and salted mashed russet potatoes.
   I won't be making it any time soon again due to effort and my family's lack luster response, but it will definitely be an annual, winter time tradition.

This recipe is delicious!  I made it as directed only I used a third of a cup of brown sugar instead of a half. I was concerned about it being too sweet with using a red apple but was perfect served over homemade mashed potatoes! My family loved this I will definitely make again.

I've made this a few times now and the whole family loves it--all three generations! I brown the sausage in a skillet not a grill but it works out the same. I added bacon fat to the sauerkraut last time and cooked this in the slow cooker. Awesome! Next time, I'm thinking about using some apple cider for more liquid in the cooker.

I made this recipe and it was teriffic -- unlike Dee's, that switched ingredients and used Italian Sausage with sauerkraut (eeeeeewwwwwwww), then gave it a mediocre score..  We need to have a thumbs down or least helpful button so people coming here can understand what's going on with these low or lower star ratings for 5 star recipes..

This recipe is fabulous! I made it tonight when I decided to do a clean out the pantry/freezer meal. I did not have enough time to cook it for the recommended time so I altered the method to use the pressure cooker. Into my pressure cooker I placed all of the ingredients EXCEPT the sausage and bacon. I did not drain the kraut so that I had enough liquid. (Apple juice would have worked if you want to drain the kraut).  I also added a bay leaf, 2T. bacon grease and a squirt of mustard and cooked it for 15 minutes once it came to pressure. During that 15 minutes I sliced and browned the sausage in a skillet. I did not have bacon but if I did I would have browned it during this time as well. Once time on PC was up I released the pressure, added the sausage to the pot and resealed it for another 5 minutes in the pressure cooker and released pressure using the quick release method. It turned out delicious with that "cooked for hours" flavor in about 35 minutes.

I made some minor changes in the approach since I was nearly tripling the recipe for a New Year's Day family dinner. Used 6 lbs of Polska Kielbasa, 3 lbs of saurkraut plus 1/2 head of red cabbage, 3 granny smith apples, 2 large sweet onions diced. Didn't have caraway seeds and used fennel seeds instead, just 2 T, plus only 1/2 cup of sugar (for the tripled recipe). I put it all in a large oven-proof covered pot and skipped the stovetop step. Since it had very little liquid, I added 3 x 16 oz cans of Michigan hard cider. I cooked it in the oven at 325 for 2 hrs and then another 1-1/2 hrs at 300. Took it out of the oven and just let it sit on the stove while I finished the potatoes (smashed baby potatoes, very tasty).  Even my doubters who were not fond of saurkraut (because it was too acidy) loved it! Not a hint of acid. The final verdict from the 12 family members at the table, from 1-1/2 yrs to 80 years old - YUM!!!! We'll be making it again next year, for certain!!

Made this a recipe and it was awesome. We even ate all the leftovers, which is rare.  We served it over homemade mash potatoes. A great New Years Day dinner.....which we'll  probably have. +5

This will be my go to sauerkraut recipe. Wow! The flavor was awesome. And my picky, finicky spouse went back for seconds and will be wolfing down the leftovers. 

NOTE: To those who make massive changes to this recipe before trying it out I have a question, "Why?" See if it can stand up on its own, and if it can't then make changes.

I followed the recipe as closely as possible. Due to the sizes of the ingredients at the store the kielbasa was 5 oz less than the recipe and the sauerkraut was 8 oz. more. These are minor changes and, if I can buy the called for amounts of each, I will switch to that.

To those who don't hate caraway seeds, make sure you add it. 

My one mistake that I will not repeat: I browned the kielbasa a little too thoroughly. The kielbasa came out a little dry, but I think that was my fault.

A great recipe!

PERFECT!!!!  I made this for our office Pot Luck.  We had a Winter Olympics potluck where everyone picked a country and cooked something from that country (cool right?  That's what I thought too).  My heritage is German, so I picked Germany.  This recipe is the closest I've EVER come to the sauerkraut recipe that my grandmother used to make!  I followed the recipe BUT used 4 lbs. of sauerkraut, added a smidge more caraway seeds and a little more than 1/4 cup brown sugar.  THEN...my roommate came home and suggested I add beer....so I added 1/2 bottle of Blue Moon.  O M G...this was not only good...BUT...it was a hit with the coworkers that liked sauerkraut.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

One more thing...I browned the bacon and onions...cut up the sausage and browned it in the bacon grease and then threw everything in the slow cooker overnight.  PERFECTION!!

Folks, note this recipe mentions OLD German. Kraut in German means cabbage.. raw. 
Also note, she cooks it down for 2 whole hours. We don't have to do that today. We use can or 'kraut' found in a jar already made. I think she chopped her cabbage then mixed it with the apple and caraway.. pinch of  salt. cooked it down for 2 hours until it is at a wilt. 

Also, when cooking the bacon with onion... Deglaze your frying pan with a little beer. Then pour the juice over the the whole thing. 

I served mine with noodles.

Let me start by saying I ABSOLUTELY HATE SAUERKRAUT!  It's an aversion rooted deep in a bad experience at Air Force Survival School many years ago.  That said, I love the things that traditionally come with sauerkraut...Reuben's, etc. (I just have it taken off or VERY light on the serving).  But this recipe sounded great, and with a fair degree of trepidation...I made it.  (All the while thinking my family is going to hate it, and complain about the smell of cooking sauerkraut.)  Bottom Line...IT IS SUPERB!  And everyone loved it.  I was so impressed and surprised and am so glad I made it.  Cooking ahead with the brown sugar and apple certainly does mellow out everything I normally hate about sauerkraut.  It made it into a nice garnish that blended perfectly...and did not overpower the meal.  I did go lighter on the sauerkraut than the recipe called for (as I couldn't believe how it would turn out) but will go closer to the full recipe next time.  Be brave sauerkraut haters and enjoy this meal.

I had some sauerkraut leftover that needed to be used up, and whipped this up for dinner. While this is not something that we'd eat often, it was nice for a change. I served this with cheese pierogies, and it went well together.

I have made this recipe exactly as written , several times. Delicious! I'm about 1/2 German and my husband is 100% German and we enjoy this recipe as do our children. I prepare this in my cast iron dutch oven so goes from stove top to oven easily. We usually serve this dish with potatoes and/or brat buns. We've served this to our guests when we entertain in the summer months and everyone absolutely LOVES this dish!! Thank you for sharing! Will continue to make this again in the future.

This was very good, even better on Day 2 after all the flavors have marinated together.  I followed the recipe as written, except I didn't rinse and drain the kraut.  I wanted to keep all the kraut flavor, and I like my kraut a little juicy.  After baking it and seeing how dry it gets, I was glad I did it that way.  During the last 15 minutes of baking, I dug holes in the casserole and placed potato dumplings in them to bake in what juices were still left.

Made it twice so far, first time I felt it was too soggy so I went the extra step of straining the  sauerkraut in my salad spinner after rinsing. I ended up having to add liquid back to the kraut to keep it from burning and had to babysit it for the whole last hour. 

Next time I'm going to measure what liquid I removed during the rinsing process and replace with either apple juice or cider.

Also cover it in the oven for at least the first half if you were worried about drying out. 

Both times the flavor has been amazing, just need to figure out the technique for the texture im after.

Wonderful, but I did change it. We don't eat pork so I used turkey sausage and turkey bacon. It was so good. We served it with as we call German Fried Potatoes which are half nuked and slow fried sliced potatoes in lots of butter which take a bout half a hour. Thank You Doemark

This is really good.  I browned the sausage and put everything in the crockpot.  I used real bacon bits.  I found I did not need any apple juice, as others have suggested when using the crockpot, as there was plenty of moisture.  Will be making this again.

I followed the recipe with two exceptions:  I used 4 slices of thick sliced bacon and only 1 pound of kielbasa because that is what I had.  It was an excellent dish and I will be making it again.

Loved it! The only changes I made was subbed red onion because its all I had, and shortened the cooking times a little. Cooked the kraut only about hour and 15 minutes, and in the oven only 40 min. Cooked it in my dutch oven,  It was excellent.

Made once with kielbasa and once with bratwurst.  Both times I followed the recipe and the results were the same--great tasting sausage and kraut.  Caraway seeds a must.

I wonder if I did something wrong because 2 hrs. cooking sauerkraut seemed unnecessary and very dry. What type of sauerkraut did others use that requires such a long time? I used 2 lbs. from a jar. I had to put the bacon, onion and sausage in the pot in order to have enough moisture, and baking it for another hour was definitely overcooked although we ate it and had company over.

My first time making this and it was delicious. I did it just like the recipe. I will certainly make this again. Although, with all the sausage and yummy bacon it is more for occasions or when I feel like cheating on being healthy.

I followed the recipe exactly as it's written except that I used turkey kielbasa and left out the caraway seeds. It turned out great!!!! My husband commented that he wouldn't have known I used turkey kielbasa if I hadn't told him. I think that was because of the bacon. I was worried about burning the sauerkraut since I drained it. My gas stove kept getting too hot on low so I turned it off a bunch of times and then back on a few minutes later to keep the temperature down. Finally I added a few tablespoons of water. That seemed to help and didn't have a negative effect on the recipe. I would definitely make this again.

The first time I made this recipe, I followed it to a T and did add the optional caraway seeds. Good stuff.

  For the second time, I also added 2 tbsp of apple sauce to the simmering sauerkraut mixture and used a 1 lb of bacon instead of a 1/2 lb. with no other changes. Better stuff. I do recommend using the caraway seeds.

Made this recipe without any changes and I loved it.  I've made sauerkraut and kielbasa many times but never like this.  The two hours simmering over low heat is the key to making this a good meal into an excellent meal... Five stars! My recommendation.... don't change anything!!!

I have to say a was a little leery about trying this recipe but I wanted some sauerkraut.  I had to substitute a couple of things because I didn't have any bacon or apples. Since I didn't have any apples I used an 8 0z jar of homemade apple sauce and didn't add the brown sugar.  I put a little oil in the frying pan and dumped in some bacon bit and sauteed the onion with them.  This turned out really good and my husband even liked it.  I will be making this again when I want to do something different with kielbasa.

This is a great recipe. I made it exactly the first time and it was wonderful! The second time, I cut the brown sugar in half and it was still yummy! I also tried it with hot dogs instead of the kielbasa. It wasn't quite as flavorful, but still yummy!

I used a reviewers suggestion and cooked in a crock pot using homemade rabbit sausage links uncut.  It made plenty of liquid without having to add juice.  Didn't know how long I was suppose to cook it and went a little too long (6 hours).  Sausages were fall apart tender, but the dish was tasty none the less!  Will make again.  Thanks!

I made a few changes and was happy with the results. I didn't have apple or caraway seeds and I prefer not to rinse the flavor out of my sauerkraut. I added 1/4 cup of fruit punch and simmered for only one hour. Then baked for a half hour. I realize I completely changed the recipe but was looking for only a basic idea anyway. I  enjoyed it thoroughly and will likely follow my own recipe in the future.

Excellent taste but laborious to make..but worth it! Do not drain the sauerkraut tho. You will need every bit of that liquid to keep it from drying out in Skillet and oven.

I used a quart of home made kraut, did not wash and rinse. I did add about 1 cup of water to the kraut and let simmer for 2 hours. Smell while cooking was amazing. I love sauerkraut, this dish did not disappoint.

I made this Dish for our New Years Family dinner and wow was it a Hit!! The sauerkraut had a very balanced taste with the added brown sugar and sliced apple slow cooking together. The bacon and onions brought all the delicious flavoring together and cooking the Keilbassa In the bacon grease enhanced the flavoring even more!! I stayed in line with everything in the recipe, aside from caraway seeds (bc I don’t care for them). The sauerkraut mixture didn’t need anything extra, in my opinion. I think if I would’ve added some kind of extra juice to it, it would’ve thrown the balance off or sweetened it too much. I kept it covered for 2 hours which keeps moisture in while stirring occasionally. Once you add the bacon/onions to it and then the kielbasa, it adds some extra moisture to the sauerkraut and really is perfect flavoring, just as the recipe says! The one thing I would say is to give yourself enough time to sauté the onions/bacon/kielbasa, probably more like 20-25min to sauté up the onions/bacon for good crispness as well as the kielbasa for browning before adding it all the sauerkraut mix. The flavorings bake all together in the oven and the smells in your kitchen are amazing and will bring anyone in your house over to ask, “Is it ready yet!?!” Yum!! Definitely have this recipe saved for one of my future family holiday meals! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Was lovely but I had to change things as I had 2 pork chops and 2 bratwurst thawed and half a jar of Sauerkraut...this was an excellent guide for me!  Otherwise I adjusted proportions and added a splash of apple cider for moisture and popped it in the oven in the dutch oven pot after browning everything first...40 mins at 375F ...everything was still moist and yummy!

Loved this!  I’d made a similar recipe in the past but decided to try this one. The apple (I used Fuji) makes this awesome. I also added garlic and onion.

this has been in my fall rotation for several years now. although i've always just done the whole thing in a dutch oven on the stove, allowing time to meld the flavors, while  skipping the hour of oven baking. served with pan seared, pirogies & onions (in butter).

SPEED METHOD: I didn’t have three+ hours so used a Dutch oven to fry the diced bacon, removed it, quickly browned a package of bratwurst (it’s what I had) in the bacon grease and removed it to the bacon plate, browned the chopped onion and apple (I used extra...again, used up what I had) and added the kraut, sugar, pepper and a little salt.  I buried the brats and half the bacon in the sauerkraut mixture, covered and baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  The last few minutes, I uncovered and added the rest of the bacon.  It wasn’t “like candy” as another reviewer said, but it developed that appetizing golden color and was  delicious.

So good!  I did change one thing: I simmered for an hour and baked for 45 minutes because I didn’t manage my time well. It was still DELICIOUS!  The sauerkraut is tender but still has firmness too. And the flavor is wonderful!

Very wonderful flavor and substance. Doesn't need to go for 2 hours. Went for about 30 minutes just to cook off the excess liquid. Just added alittle apple juice.

It does take hours to make but most of the time it is simmering or baking.  I cut the sugar down and I'm glad I did because I thought it was good.  I think I might try not using sugar at all.

A good starting point, but greatly improved by adding 1/2 cup each of beef stock and white wine, plus a healthy splash of white wine vinegar (a couple of tablespoons) to the sauerkraut mixture before simmering it.

I made this as written but doubled for my Nicene's birthday.  It was good but was very sweet for my tastes.  I used one tart and one sweet apple, maybe that was it?  It was good, just not as savory as I had hoped it to be.

This is in the oven now. I know it will be good. However, some things to expect: There is a lot of grease involved. When I cooked the bacon/onions, I scooped it out with a slotted spoon to allow as much excess grease to drip off as possible. When I browned the sausage, I put it on a napkin and also pressed it with more napkins before transferring it to the sauerkraut mixture. I also went through 1-1.5 cups of apple juice while cooking the sauerkraut because it started to get dry. I also bought (unknowingly), Bavarian Caraway Seed sauerkraut, so I didn’t add the additional seeds called for in the recipe. Next time, I know to buy very specific and plain sauerkraut. I tried to cut out as much excess grease as possible but still stick to the recipe as closely as possible. I know it will be very good served over mashed potatoes with a side of lightly dressed baby spinach. Just be aware that this is very greasy, pops a lot, and is best made outside if possible lol. I live in a small apt and this cooking smell will stick around for a few days.

It was absolutely delicious but I never had any liquid to simmer so I just kept stirring it and put a cover on how come I didn’t have any liquid? I read one of the reviews and someone added apple juice so it wouldn’t dry out. Figures that I don’t have any apple juice in the house!
Just wondering what I did wrong.

I just made this, and it was delicious.  Big hit with my husband.    I will definitely add it to my meal repertoire.  Makes a big difference if you have quality kielbasa and bacon, which I bought from a local meat market.  I followed the recipe, with the only variation of decreasing the bacon a bit.  Don't omit the caraway seeds; once it is all mixed and baked the caraway flavor does not scream at you, but it does add to the flavor of the dish.

I made this with what I had available and had to skimp on the time, but it was still delicious.  I had no bacon, but used cubed pieces of ham, and only had sweet Italian sausage.  I cooked the sauerkraut for about an hour before adding the rest of the ingredients.  It was so good that I will definitely plan ahead next time and try the recipe as printed.  The idea of slow cooking the sauerkraut is a new one to me, but is obviously worth it.

I made this last night for the 2nd time and it again was very good. My one comment would be it does tend to be a bit on the sweet side so if you prefer your sauerkraut more on the savory side, consider dialing back the brown sugar. But coming from someone who doesn’t particularly care for sauerkraut, this is a very good recipe.

Excellent recipe! I sauteed bacon, onion, and bratwurst (couldn't find kielbasa at the store!)  in my cast iron pan, then threw together with the rest of the ingredients in the crockpot for a couple of hours. Served with mashed potatoes and a few other sides... everyone loved it!

Meh.  It was just ok.  I made this for dinner this evening and followed the recipe to the letter.  It just wasn't a wow meal.  Flavorless is the only word I can use to describe it.  It will not make it onto my dinner rotation, unfortunately.

Made this for New Years and it was delicious!  I doubled the recipe but used 3 apples since they were small and I added half a lager beer for liquid.  I put it in a crock pot for 2 hours on high and then 2 hours on low.  Added sauteed smoked sausage one hour before service and turned the crock pot back up to high for the last hour.  Will put on the menu again for next year!

This came out delicious! My husband wanted some sauerkraut and sausage but was hesitant about this because of the brown sugar and apple. I used apple juice instead, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. He loved it and I did too, not really being too fond of sauerkraut and sausage. I’ll definitely keep this one! It is time consuming so making it a weekend dinner recipe.

We did not like this.  I didn't think it was too bad, but my husband just did not like it.  It was quite dry.  After draining the sauerkraut, I did have to add water to the pan to keep it from burning.

This is excellent! I made it for my company's pot luck and it got rave reviews.  My only modification was I made it in a slow cooker. I cooked the bacon and then dumped it on top of all of the other ingredients and let it slow cook over night. Absolutely delicious!

As it turned out I didn't have 2 lbs. of kraut as I thought so I just halved the recipe. It was difficult to cook the kraut in a saucepan with no liquid, and the recipe didn't say to add liquid so I just added a little water to help it cook. It was golden after 45 minutes so I put the other ingredients in and put it in the oven. It was also done after 30 minutes but I wonder if that was because there was less of the recipe in the oven. I used Polish kielbasa. Do use the caraway seeds as they add a nice flavor. I served it over mashed potatoes and it was absolutely wonderful! Thank you for this delicious recipe.

We both enjoyed this. Husband declared it, "Really good." I used 2 TBLSP butter and and 2 of EVOO. Added beef broth and reserved pasta water. Also added 3 garlic cloves with other spices and red pepper flakes. Cabbage and all cooked just fine on top of stove in about an hour. Will make again!

This was amazing! I don’t like sauerkraut, so I was envisioning not eating much of this but I loved it and so did everyone. I didn’t change much. I omitted the bacon, since I didn’t have any. I did add a tiny bit of apple cider twice during the cooking of the sauerkraut because I was worried about it burning. And I cut the onion in half and sliced in thinly instead of chopping it.

Absolutely amazing!!!  I wasn't sure about the apple and onion but decided to try the recipe as stated first before changing it.  Boy I am glad I did!  My family loved it!!!  The boys even asked for seconds and then asked me to fix it again soon.  I sure didn't expect that.

It was good. Not special. The remarkable thing is that after I ate it I had a very strong urge to occupy the Sudentenland.

I have been making this for several years, but I don't bake it. I do everything in a large skillet. I add everything all at once except the kielbasa. Definitely add the caraway seed. When the sauerkraut is almost done, I add the kielbasa until heated through and browned. Thanks for the alternate bake option (for me, anyway).  It will cut down stirring to prevent burning and constant watching. Oh, I don't add bacon; in my opinion, it would fight with the flavors of the kielbasa. Seems everyone is adding bacon to everything these days. If anyone is worried about the extra grease, leave this out.

I love this recipe although I must confess, I did not follow it exactly: I used a slow cooker and cooked it on low for six hours.  The sausage was great but the sauerkraut was outstanding, the best I've ever had.  After all the sausage is gone reserve the sauerkraut for use another time and serve it to your guests as a side dish.  Or maybe as a condiment to hot dogs.  They will be sure to be amazed at how flavorful sauerkraut can be.

Very good recipe!!!   I made this for Easter,  I have been making polish sausage and sauerkraut for years, similar to this recipe.   A few things different., such as the bacon and browning the sausage, I think made a difference!!   Will make again, even though my husband prefers the recipe made with sour cream, which is awesome too!!

We loved it!  I did use turkey bacon, turkey kielbasa sausage and canned sauerkraut with the caraway seed already in it.  Since I never made it the way the recipe states, I'm not sure if it tasted a lot different, but it was DELICIOUS!! Great recipe!

It was very tasty but I think there should have been some liquid in the recipe (maybe chicken stock).  There wasn't enough liquid in the sauerkraut, apple, brown sugar combination to actually simmer the mixture.  It turned out very dry.

After browning bacon and onion, added sliced kielbasa to pan and browned then added remaining ingredients and simmered for one hour covered.  I reduced the brown sugar to one tablespoon.

This was very good.  Adding apple and onion to the sauerkraut really helped tone it down so it wasn't so strong.  Even hubby liked it, although he doesn't like sauerkraut.  Cooking the sausage in the mixture for a while made it so tender.  (Left out the caraway seeds, don't care for them, and didn't have bacon, but it was still good).   I will make this again.

Made it and loved it. Doubled the sugar, added a cup of apple juice and cooked it in the crock pot. Also seasoned and seared some pork chops and put in last couple hours of cooking. Fantastic meal.

Very good and very easy.  I cooked the components as required but threw everything together in the skillet and simmered for half an hour instead of baking for an hour (I'm impatient).

I made this recipe according to directions - almost.  I did not allow enough time so I skipped putting it in the oven and just cooked the sausage on the side. Knowing that I was not going to use the oven,   I added the bacon and onion the last hour to simmer.  Because I like caraway seeds but don't love them, I only used 1/2 tablespoon.  Still,  there  was a nice sweet savory flavor.  You could taste the apple, bacon and caraway.   Excellent!  Next time I make it, I will do the oven part as well.

This was very good.  I tripled the amount of apples to sweeten it up a little.  I also didn't use the caraway seed because I didn't have any.  Great recipe - thanks!

I made a few changes.  I made half the recipe.  Cooked the bacon.  Then I browned the bratwurst, that was what I had on hand, in the bacon grease.  Then I browned the onions in the grease.  I mixed everything together and put it in the crock pot.  Mixed 1/2 cup of applesauce with 1/4 cup of water and poured that on top of the mixture in the crock pot.  I would have used Apple juice if I had some on hand.  Cooked on high for an hour, then reduced to low for approx. 3 hours.  Served with dark bread and broccoli slaw.  SUPER GOOD....

I have made this numerous times and love it! I do not put it in the oven but I let it simmer on the stove. 
Sometimes I put diced potatoes in it and the last time I made it, I used beer sauerkraut. Delicious!! 

I make no altercations to the ingredients and it is still amazing!!

For Easter dinner 2016 I made this recipe and put it all in the slow cooker as one reviewer suggested.  Not a good method - sausage was overlooked and mealy, sauerkraut had little flavor. Try this again and stick to original suggested way of preparing. Also used only 1 ½ teaspoons of caraway seed, maybe increase it to 2 teaspoons.

I made this last night but in addition to the kielbasa  I added some spicy sausage and beef sausage effectively doubling the recipe.  I also added two beers to the mix after draining the kielbasa as I was a little worried about the sauerkraut being too dry while on the stove and then once it went into the stove.  I used two coronas which is all I had in the fridge, but I will be making this recipe again and will use either yuengling, a polish beer or maybe a german beer.

My husband loves loves this dish but I have not been a fan, so I never cook it. He recently came home with some ingredients as if he knows how to cook it. I'm thinking that was my clue to try. This recipe is right on time since everything but the Sauerkraut, I'm good at making. Thank you for building my confidence on this meal. I'm making this tonight for the hubby. At least I can say I tried. lol

I added some Italian sausage too. Everyone loved it. I think it would be fine as is, we just like spicier meals. The apple and bacon really add a good flavor.

I thought this was excellent. I only added 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar. I didn't want to over sweeten it. I also used poached weisswurst  in place of half the kielbasa. if I had brats or knockwurst I would have added those as well. It's really good with a mix of sausages.

Won't make again.  The long simmering did nothing good, brown sugar makes it brown and ruins the texture of the kraut. 
that said, the sausage was enhanced by this recipe.  I imagine next time I will eliminate the sugar, or reduce dramatically, keep the apple, simmer a half hour at best,  I was, by the way, using fermented kraut, not canned.

I cooked the sauerkraut, brown sugar and apple in the pressure cooker with 1 1/2 cup water and a bit of chicken boullion concentrate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, I sautéed the bacon and then  sautéed the onions and finally the sausage in a little of the bacon fat. Once the kraut was done, I combined everything and it was delicious! This is a time-saving method of preparation.

Made thisI don't understand why this had to cook so long but I cooked per the directions. Others said they added apple juice to keep it from drying out but the drying out with the apples, onions and bacon is what makes it so delectable.

I am not a big kraut person, but the combo of sugar, apple, bacon and onion was terrific! I paired with some potato and macaroni salads and Italian sausage (cooked separately but still delicious all together).

Very good. Had to use can instead of fresh sauerkraut. Will make again and add a little apple juice so it doesn't dry out in the oven. Only baked mine 30 min. because it was starting to dry out. Thanks for recipe :)

This is exactly how my Oma would make it except with addition of dill weed and occasionally shed use Apple sauce instead. She also would kielbasa sausage. I made this tonight with spätzel and it was amazing. Made me feel like I was having dinner at my Oma and Opa's again.

Wow!  I made this exactly as described in the recipe except instead of using a 1/2 lb of bacon, I used a whole package.  It was so delicious!  I will definitely be making this again!  The flavors were amazing.

Great Recipe! I omitted the caraway ( we don't like it) and brown sugar ( husband is type 1 diabetic). I did add some small red potatoes, and garlic. Don't rush the cooking of it, and it'll turn out great!

Was awesome!!!! Made it at firehouse, left out caraway seed and brown sugar, like sauerkraut that is a little tarter. I ended up letting it simmer longer due to making runs and also baked a little longer. First time I've cooked with NO leftovers

This was my first time making the recipe and it was awesome. Only changes was half of sauerkraut (I only had a can), no seeds and turkey kielbasa. It was easy to follow and came out beautifully. Changes in the future would be to make double cause this was so good!

This sauerkraut was the best. I did make some modifications. I skipped the caraway seeds because my partner doesn't like them. I also used turkey bacon and chicken-and-apple sausage because they were a little lower-sodium than the pork equivalents at my grocery store. Was really happy I did -- the apple in the sausage went really well with the salty-sweet flavor of the sauerkraut. I cooked the sauerkraut in the crock pot for two hours on high, then browned the bacon, onion, and sausage in a skillet before adding them to the kraut. I cooked for an additional hour or so on low.

My wife likes Bavarian-style sauerkraut, which has brown sugar added for sweetness.  We used to be able to find it in a can but cannot anymore so I looked for a similar recipe and stumbled upon this.  It turned out excellent.  My only deviation was to add a bit of apple juice to the kraut because it was a bit dry to simmer.

This is delicious. I made it just as the recipe suggested, only I halved it as I am only cooking for 2. It is an interesting combination of ingredients that come together to make a very yummy dish. This will be on our menu on a regular basis.

I love sauerkraut with most any smoked sausage together. I have made it many many times. The only thing I leave out is the apple and brown sugar. I don't care for the sweetness it adds. Other than that it makes a fine meal.

I made this recipe in the crockpot. Left out the bacon - just because I did not have time! - and added in some chunks of potatoes and apple juice.  I thought it was good.  My son and husband thought it was just ok.  My daughter did not like it at all (even the sausage, which is unusual!).  I would probably try it one more time to see if the reception is any better the next time (and likely will be if I add the bacon! ;)

I just tried this recipe as I was looking for something just a little different.  We loved this mixture.  I also used a slow cooker and the flavors kept us coming back for more.
