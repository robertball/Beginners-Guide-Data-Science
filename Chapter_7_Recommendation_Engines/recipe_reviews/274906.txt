I love soft scrambled eggs. I use about 1/4 cup milk with either Velveta chunks or Philadelphia cream cheese chunks about 1/2 inch square towards the end of cooking while eggs are still runny. Add the cheese according to taste. Low heat is the key. No higher than level 4 on a 1-9 scale. I love cottage cheese but in eggs I prefer Velveeta or Philly.

Very soft, creamy and tasty eggs! These were nowhere done at 10 minutes, so I had to increase the heat to medium-low/medium for another 3 to 4 minutes.  I used my Ninja blender cup to mix everything together. Make sure you eat these right away. I had made extra and after sitting for 10 minutes, the liquid was starting to separate from the eggs and pool underneath. I used ricotta cheese, as suggested in the cook's notes.
