I ended up with hard "cracker" like rolls rather than bread bowls.  They did not rise up into anything deep enough to hold soup.  They actually worked well, though, as I broke them up and dipped them in the soup (which I served the old fashioned way - in bowls from the cupboard.)

I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with 4 small, hard bread disks... They didn't even resemble bread bowls... I would recommend using just a light bread flour and not flattening them into disks.  The Italian bread bowl recipe on this site is 500 times better!!! Take a look at that one if you want a good bread bowl  :)

I use all purpose white flour in the whole recipe and 2 tablespoons of yeast. The result is a bread that does not compete with the food inside it.
I also pull out the bread inside the bowls to dip into the soup or the stew.
The bowls are moist and chewy inside and crusty on the outside.

This receipe worked fine -- I didn't flatten the bread to discs before baking, I left them as balls.

I put a home made stew in them.  The bread had a nice coarse taste and texture to them, perfect compliment to the stew.  In addition the crust was firm and chewy/crunchy that tasted really good and held up well under the gravy of the stew.

I used 3 cups whole wheat flour and one white.  Also, divided dough into 2 instead of 4, as I wanted larger bowls for putting dip in at a party.  The taste was fine, but they didn't raise into bowls.  I would try this recipe again, but don't flatten into disks at all.  Whatever shape they are when they are doughy is what shape they will be when they come out.  That is really the only major issue with this recipe, otherwise the taste is fine, and makes a nice crusty outside with a more chewy inside.

The dough didn't raise into bowls, just hard, disks. It lacks flavor, it needs something, maybe honey or a little more sugar. I will not make this recipe again, and I wish I had read the reviews first and tried the other recipe.

I agree with the other review already here, wishing I would have read the reviews first. I also agree that these came out like disks. There is no way I can serve the corn chowder I made in these disks. The flavor is okay but way too flat for a soup bowl. I followed the recipe just as written being sure to check water temp for yeast and raisng dough correctlty.

This is a nice, hearty bread bowl.  Not sure about the directions to flatten into disks--I never do that, I just form into round loaves and let rise, then bake.  Once the dough is baked, you can cut off the tops then cut around the edge and pull out the insides for a nice bread bowl.  I am not sure what the trouble is with rising for people--make sure everything is room temp except the water, which should be at 110 degrees F in order to have the yeast rise properly.  These bowls hold up well.  I served a southwestern style soup in these with cheese and avocado--delicious.  thanks for the recipe!

I didn't flatten into disks after reading the reviews, but my bowls still turned out pretty flat.  The underside also caved upwards a little bit.  Mine were done at around 30 minutes instead of 40-50.  The taste was just a little bit off.
I'll keep searching for a great bread bowl recipe.  I was very disappointed in this one.

This recipe is awesome. I made it exactly how the instructions told me too, the only thing I changed was that I added a clove of chopped garlic, some rosemary and I didn't punch down the bread balls. They were perfect and I recommend this recipe to anyone that is interested in dank bread bowls. Enjoy and good luck!
