I would give this 5 stars, but as written, the basil to olive oil ratio is way off.  I probably used close to 4 cups packed basil leaves, and maybe half the evoo.  I also added a pinch of red pepper flake.  Froze half this batch for this winter when we need a pesto fix.  The color of this sauce is just verdant green!!

The lemon is a delicious idea; very springy! Came out way too oily, however. I had to add 2 more cups of basil to taste it at all. Has a nice, bright color.

This was beautiful! My boyfriend doesn't even like pesto sauces and he just can't get enough of it!

For the olive oil, I didn't use a measuring cup except for the first 1/2 cup, after that, I just drizzled it in until it looked just right. Also added a touch of Cyanne Pepper to it for a bit of zing with the lemon juice. So tasty!

There is just way too much evoo in this for the amount of basil called for. I ended up just drizzling in the evoo until it was the consistency that I wanted. I did like the walnuts and lemon in this. Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious but didnâ€™t follow the ratio at all.  Used 1 cup of walnuts, about 2 plus cups of basil, 2 1/2 lemons, about 1/2 cup of oil, 8 roasted garlic gloves.

I agree with other comments about the ratio of basil to olive oil being off. I used 4 cups of fresh basil and at the end added just an additional 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of a full cup. With those changes it was delicious! I loved using walnuts instead of pine nuts.

I dont normally write comments about recipes but I couldn't wait to write about this recipe.  This recipe is "out of this world" good!  I followed the recipe as noted but was careful with the last cup of olive oil.  I loved that you use walnuts because my local supermarket no longer carries pine nuts due to higher cost. Plus, we always have walnuts in the cupboards.  I combined all of the ingredients and used small amounts over penne pasta.  My 21 yo daughter, said it is "Bomb.com"!!

It was very good. I made extra and put it in the freezer.
