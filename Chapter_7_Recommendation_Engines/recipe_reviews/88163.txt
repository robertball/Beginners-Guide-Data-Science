The kung- pao chicken tastes good, but it is not as good as Panda Express, it needs more spice.

This was very good Kung Pao Chicken. It is spiced perfectly. If you read the recipe it clearly states to add red peppers to taste. So if you like your Chinese food spicy, throw in a tablespoon of red pepper.  Also, if you don't like so much sweet cut the brown sugar in half. I did not have Chinese five-spice powder but is easy enough to make if you have the ingredients in your kitchen, and it a must. Will be making this on a regular basis.

Too sweet - not spicy enough.  The sauce is really thick - sorry but this is not the recipe for us.

Pretty easy and tasty. I added mushrooms and I think you could add any veggies you want. This is a good way to use extra celery.

I've made this several times, and not only is it delicious, it's a very flexible recipe. Sometimes I have more or less chicken, sometimes no green onions, sometimes I make extra sauce, sometimes I don't add the peanuts.  No matter what, the flavor is wonderful!  No idea if it's authentic, but it's good.

I don’t like celery so I didn’t put it in and it turned out good.  Make sure not to over sauce otherwise you will have paste not good sauce.  I just get it warm and stop.  It is a very good dish.  And I’m pretty picky.   I have made it a couple times.

Really easy and delicious. Better Thant most restaurants. We made it a little spicier. Delicious with warm rice. We will definitely make this many times. You can change up the vegetables to suit your taste and what is seasonal. ??????

Yay! Thanks for a great recipe! I used 1/2 tsp of Chinese 5 Spice powder in each spice mix. Could even increase it more. Also added carrots. Delish.

I added jicama for an extra crunchy texture. I also added a bit more 5 spice and red pepper than indicated. I enjoyed this meal and I will make it again.

Fair, it had plenty of heat, but not much flavor.  I added more soy and fresh ginger which helped.

Little too much of a vinegar taste. I will reduce/eliminate the white vinegar.

I loved this. Had all of the ingredients, EVEN the Chinese Five Spice... Well except for peanuts. I had slivered almonds on hand so I toasted them and added them along with some petite baby carrots. So delicious I will definitely make this again. And there's no gluten, yippee!

This recipe was good, but I took off a star because it doesn't taste like the kung pao I'm used to (with a reddish sauce).  It was good, and pretty much tasted of the Chinese five spice powder.  I also added a yellow pepper and a lot more celery. Overall, a good meal but not quite the kung pao I was looking for.

My family loved this, even the kids. Husband said he would have eaten more if I had it so next time I'll double it. I changed up the veggies to red bell peppers, scallions, zucchini, celery, and garlic. I would have added mushrooms had I thought of it. We will be making this again!
