I would give this 10 stars if I could. I’ve been searching for the perfect pie recipe but my search is over! Mixes easily, rolls out cleanly, tastes great!

I have always made pie crust with half shortening/half butter, but after trying this dough, I'm making this my go-to recipe! I think the technique of using the food processor is what makes it easy and delicious. I've only previously tried to incorporate butter by hand. Oh, and I was too impatient to have the dough sit in the refrigerator after mixing it, but it didn't seem to matter. It was easy to roll and put in the dish immediately after mixing. Oh and it was semi-crispy and delicious in the end!

We used this recipe for an after-school bake club activity.  Since we didn't have a food processor, we used pastry cutters.  Without ice, we just used cold tap water. Also, we didn't have time to put the dough back into the refrigerator.  The apple mixture was made ahead of time and we spooned it onto our dough and followed the instructions for sealing the tarts.  We used 7" glass pie dishes, ungreased, and put two tarts in each dish, back to back.  After baking, they slid out of the dishes just fine.  Oh, what a lovely taste!  I am officially abandoning my grandmother's excellent pastry recipe for this one instead.

I didn't know which recipe to choose, then I saw the author:
Chef John so as always:

5 stars .  Because Chef John's recipes are (usually) simple and (always) delicious.  

I always get great complements when I cook Chef John's recipes.  Especially the first time.  You know when you make something better than a restaurant does, I say Yes! Thank you Chef John!

I will definitely make this crust again.  I made it as directed, only substituting 3T of vodka for 3 of the T of water.  Just as described, the crust had an amazing buttery taste and was simple to make.  I was able to roll the dough out without any additional flour on my board or rolling pin.  I left out one star because even though I rolled the dough a bit thinner than 1/4 inch, I still did not have enough dough to make a pretty, thickly crimped edge on either of the two pies I made.  Next time, I will make a recipe and a half to make crusts for two pies.  When the recipe says it make two pie crusts, I wish it would specify the size of the pie plate.  I didn't think mine were that big, but I guess that must be the problem.

I have been making this since the recipe was posted. This is my go-to pie crust recipe and it works for everything pie. There are 2 things that make this recipe foolproof: using completely frozen butter (I usually put it in the freezer overnight), vodka (I use half water and half vodka and put it in the freezer a few minutes before I start), and extra liquid. 6 tablespoons are rarely enough, and if you think your pie dough is a bit crumbly and it isn't the most amazing pie dough you've felt, you probably need more water.

I like the tip to layer the flour in the food processor. I made two crusts; the first one seemed extra crumbly, I struggled to get it into a cohesive enough ball to wrap. My butter was frozen and water cold, so it was probably really dry. The second dough I made, I added extra water, and it stuck together really well, but I'm not sure which will make the best crust!

Just a note referencing Chef John’s instruction on doubling the recipe: my food processor could not handle the quantity- just save yourself some hassle and make 2 single recipes! Otherwise, was an easy recipe....haven’t made the pies yet so will see how flakey they are soon.

I live in Florida and as a rule use an oil based crust because it's hot here.  I used this recipe and froze dough for an hour. Took it out of freezer and let sit  about 3 minute. As I said, it's hot. It was so easy, easier then the oil based which falls apart. Finally found the right crust. Came out beautifully,  rolled out easy, and food processor  made it a snap.

I love this crust! I always have butter cut up and stored in snack-size bags in the freezer so I can make this crust on a moment's notice. It is flaky and delicious! I've been making hand pies for our weekly Church Lenten Fish Fry, using a different filling but only this crust recipe. Everyone comments on how delicious the hand pies are, and many have asked for the crust recipe. Luckily, I know it by heart. Thank you, Chef John, for sharing this recipe!

I LOVE this recipe! Super easy and fun to make!! And uses so few dishes with such minimal mess you'll have trouble believing you're actually making dough! But seriously. This is so easy and delicious. The butter turns the finished product into a melt-in-your-mouth delicacy. Was looking for recipes for hand pies, and I don't remember Chef John ever to disappoint, so I tried his apple hand pies recipe which uses this recipe for the dough. Definitely a keeper!

Yes. the changes I made were instead of making pies i made cinnamon rolls with crushed pecans  and brown sugar with fresh melted butter inside and then added cinnamon to melted butter, rolled it up lengthwise and cut into pinwheel shapes and baked to 8-10 minutes at 375 degrees.  I then frosted them with powdered sugar.   They turned out great.
