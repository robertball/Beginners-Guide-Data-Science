I thought it would be too spicy for the kids but they really gobbled them up!  This is a great recipe to make for a large crowd. I refrigerated the mixture of sausage and cheese and made a second batch a few days later.  It's super easy to make!!

I tried these out at a family get-together. Adults and kids alike loved them.  They are quite simple to make, and clean up was easy too (always a bonus) 
I found that i could substitute regular white or wheat bread instead of the party party and it tasted really good.  
I'll definately make these again!

I usually make two different batches. I make one batch of all spicy and one batch all mild (for the kids). These are so easy to make and delicious. I serve this at my daughter's slumber parties. The girl love them!

So easy... well received at my cooking demo at my local stores Holiday Open House.  Wasn't as universally liked as the Bacon Cheese Puffs and a little heavy on the processed cheese.  If I were to make again I trade out half of the Whiz for half cheddar.

This was so simple to make! I made this with turkey sausage. With all that gooey melty cheese you can't even tell it's turkey sausage. (Def get the spicy kind though) I burnt the bread but that was my own fault. then next batch was perfect. The whole family gobbled these up on poker night.

I decided to try these out before making them for the superbowl party because there were very few ingredients and they looked easy enough. The 2 guys I was with burned the roofs of their mouths several times shoveling these in before they cooled. I agree with the one reviewer that they don't look incredibly appetizing but they are super tasty. Word of warning, have plenty of beer on hand because they will make you VERY thirsty. I am def making these for the superbowl party. I didn't add anything or change anything because quite honestly...I'm just not creative. LOL.

Appearances are deceiving! These are not the most attractive appetizers I've served but definately one of the best. They are quite filling as well. These were a big hit with the guys.

Super easy to make and the guys liked them. Next time I will use different bread. I used the suggested "party" loaf bread and it was pretty terrible-really dry and way too thin. Adding higher quality bread would really make it so much yummier. 
I also melted 1/4 loaf of Velveeta into the sausage and cheese mixture. Yum!

I actually came across this recipe on accident and decided to try it out for a small get together.  These were an instant hint. I couldn't believe how well they turned out.  I am not a very good cook at all, so if I can make these and have people asking for a recipe then I know anyone can! Awesome tasty treats!

My mom made little party appetizers just like these when I was a kid!  This recipe is just as good as I remember them!  Not the healthiest thing, but it's nice to indulge once a year for the Super Bowl.  :-)

I didnt mix the cheese into the sausage mix. Instead I put small slices of velvetta on top of the sausage, then broiled it. I also added a dash of worsch sauce and a 1/2 tablespoon of brown sugar to the sausage. It was a huge hit!

This appetizer was delicious.  Guests ate "a lot" and when dinner was served they weren't very hungry. Lesson learned limit the appetizers

I thought these were pretty good, but I just wasn't all that impressed.

Wonderful as is but you can tweak it by adding chopped green onions and sub some ground beef for some of the sausage. Pumpernickel is best but dark rye will do in a pinch. Everybody loves these and they freeze well, before baking of course.

I did it with Venison and sausage, added Worcestershire sauce sauce and garlic.
