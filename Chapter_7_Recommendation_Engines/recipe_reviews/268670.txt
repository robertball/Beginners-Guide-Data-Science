I was pleasantly surprised! I made this dish verbatim and we loved it. I added crunchy lo mein noodles on top and they added to the dish. I was skeptical at first with the onion soup mix and the sesame oil but it came out delicious. Don’t leave out the red pepper; you hardly notice it but it’s needed.

Very easy to make, and a delicious use for lean ground turkey. I didn't have water chestnuts, celery, or bean sprouts, but I replaced them with other stir fry veggies like broccoli. It was saucy and tasty.
