This is no babka...it's only a chocolate coffeecake. A true babka is fashioned from a yeast-leavened dough, rich with eggs. After rushing to the recipe, eagerly anticipating a real babka that I might make and finding only a typical quick-bread type coffeecake, I'm a bit disappointed.

I made this recipe and it was very tasty, but it takes soooo long to cool.  I tried to get it out of the pan, but when I did the whole thing crumbled!!  It was disappointing, but it still tasted good.  I'd reccomend that you cool it for at least a few hours, before attempting to remove it.

This is a great recipe! After reading other reviews, I decided to add an extra 1/4 cup sour cream, and an additional 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I baked it 15 minutes longer (after covering w/foil) & it turned out moist, chocolatey & delicious. My husband loved it! I will certainly make it again & again!

Just made this. Also added an extra 1/4 cup sour cream (was nervous of it being dry) and put some chocolate chips in the dough. I would suggest using confectioners sugar for the topping, that is what I have used in the past when I have made a real babka, and it's much easier to dust/stick along the top/eat! Yum!

Everyone liked the chocolate babka.  We all associated it with the Jerry Seinfeld episode on TV.  We all had a good laugh reminicing and then ate some more babka.  mmm...

Turned out great!  I followed someone else's lead and put a whole tub of sour cream in, and added some mini-chocolate chips in the batter, and it came out so moist!

I gave this cake five stars because my family loved it! I have never had a real Babka before so I could not tell you if it's like one, but I can tell you this is a great cake!  I did make a few changes to suit how I cook. Insead of the sour cream I used coconut milk, and instead of the unsweetened cocoa powder I used Ghirardelli all natural sweet ground chocolate and cocoa powder, and i also substiuted Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips for the semisweet chocolate chips.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

It is soooo good.  I ran out of sugar, so I only used a total of 1 c and used 2 jumbo eggs.  Still came out beautiful!  It is moist, has a soft texture, and definitely easy.  Might have gone overboard with cinnamon, but that's my personal preference.

This was AWFUL! Way to dry and i even shortened the baking time. Its barely even chocolatly, if it wasnt for the chocolate chips it wouldnt have any chocolate flavor at all. It went right in the trash.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and it was a hit.  I accidentdally used the whole tub of sour cream instead of just one cup, but it came out wonderful anyway.  I will be making it again this year and I am sure it will be even better without that mistake! :-)

Not like the bakery babkas I remember other than the combination of nuts, cinnamon and chocolate, but really really good anyway.  Thanks!

I brought this into work and it was gone in seconds. The cinamon flavor really makes this outstanding.  Be careful not to burn the edges.

A fantastic receipe that I've made twice in a week! Devoured both times. It took a while to work out what a "tube tin' was 'cause In Australia it's a ring tin!!Searching for a babka recipe was inspired by a similar predicament to Elaine and Jerry (Seinfeld)......to bring the wine or the babka!!!!!

I have made this cake several times and is one of my favorites.  This rich, moist cake has a wonderful cinnamon and chocolate flavor. (The batter is really good too!)

Great flavor and really simple make since yeast isn't used.  It has a tendency to dry out too quickly if not frozen.

I would have liked this cake to be more chocolaty.  Ohter than that, it was very good - more of a coffee cake than a dessert cake.

Good cake, but not really an authentic babka.  It was very easy to make, much easier than the traditional babkas.  The cake came out wonderfully!

Excellent cake.  The whole family loved it and it was great with coffee/tea.  I loved the chocolate chips and nuts in it because it adds a nice texture.  Would definitely make again.

Delicious!  I used fat free sour cream and margarine instead of butter in an effort to shave off a few grams of fat/calories.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks!

I thought it was very good but a little to dry. I think chocolate sauce would have topped it off well. Also, it says "ground cinnamon" twice.
