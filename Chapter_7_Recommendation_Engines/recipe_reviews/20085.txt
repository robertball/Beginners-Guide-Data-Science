This was absolutely outstanding!  It was a total hit at our summer gathering.  I doubled the recipe (used Club crackers)and put it in a 9x13 pan, which worked perfectly for the base.  I used 2 qt. strawberries and 12 oz. Cool Whip.  To the Cool Whip I added 2/3 bag of Heath Bit-O-Brickle (toffee pieces), which made it even more fabulous!  I sprinkled the rest of the toffee on top of the strawberries at the end.  It added another touch of sweetness and a great crunch.  Thanks for the SUPER recipe - never would have thought to put those ingredients together myself!

Loved this pie!  The only change I will make is next time, I'll use 3 or 4 cups of strawberries and increase the whipped topping to 12 oz's, but it is still really good just as it is, I just happen to love strawberries.

An outstanding pie!  Beautiful, delicious, and not too filling!  I used pure almond extract in place of vanilla and NEVER use cool whip...fresh whipped cream is so easy to make and takes only a few extra minutes and tastes far superior to the oil & chemicals also known as cool whip. I like to add a little almond extract to the whipping cream, too!  Thanks, Tammy for sharing this recipie!  YUM!  :-)

Thank you thank you. My husband back in the 80s went to Georgia for business and was invited to dinner and the woman cooking made this pie and he loved it so much he asked her for the recipe. I thought it was sooooo good, and unusual but lost the recipe years ago and have searched and searched. Again thanks for posting it here! Yea!!!

This was great. My husband was out of town for the weekend, so to welcome him back I made this pie. He loves strawberries, and thought this was the best he ever had. I'm making it again this weekend. I didn't change a thing.

I really wanted to like this recipe because the crust was reminiscent of a Pavlova, with the addition of nuts.  It turned out fine and looked beautiful, and everyone finished their entire piece of pie, but the comments I got back from my family were just, eh.
