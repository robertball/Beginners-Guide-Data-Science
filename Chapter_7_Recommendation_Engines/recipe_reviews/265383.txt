I made two different carne asada recipes last night and they were both great. There were things I liked better about this recipe but the one thing I did like better about the other one was that it used beer in the marinade. I doubled the chipotle pepper for extra kick but that was the only change I made. Next time I will ditch the honey and add some beer. Regardless this is an excellent recipe!

This is my favorite recipe for steak marinade that I ve tried to date. I love it! Usually I make it as written but I have made it without cilantro before when I forgot to pick it up at the market and it was still good. I ve also used it on chicken with good results. But I like it on steak best even cubed and skewered.:) The meat comes out very tender and flavorful and serves well on salad plain with sides or as a sandwich wrap or taco. I love that the serving options are nearly endless with this. Definitely a go-to in my recipe box now!

After marinading , I put it (and the juices) in the slow cooker for 4 hours and used it for street tacos.  Super moist & tender and it fell apart perfectly.  Whole family loved it (ages 5-50).   

My changes: 

I used 1/2 the salt...no one complained; they still loved it.

I didn't have any ground chipotle, so I substituted with 1/2 amount of cayenne pepper and added a little liquid smoke to mimic the smokey chipotle flavor.  

Finally, I  used some orange zest and fresh-squeezed juice as I didn't have enough fresh limes.
