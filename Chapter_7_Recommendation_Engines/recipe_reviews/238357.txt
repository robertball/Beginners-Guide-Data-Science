I made this recipe tonight.  I doubled the recipe so I could use a 1 lb package of ground turkey (93/7%) and used some dried onion in place of the green onions.  Otherwise followed it as written. Since I made a double batch, I made them as regular size muffins (a heaping 1/4 cup of mixture in each) and it made 24 of them.  Baked them for 25 - 30 mins.   They were tasty and healthy ... And they were good with a little Sriracha sauce on them.  :-)  I served them with saut√©ed veggies on the side.   Thanks for the recipe!

I did NOT like this receipe. I should have been more leary when the recipe called for browning the turkey meat BEFORE rolling them into balls to then further bake them. There was barely any fat to keep them together! I might make these again, but not brown the ground turkey first. I did drizzle hoisin sauce that I mixed with sirachi sauce as I found the recipe VERY bland as well. Wished I liked them more since I made alot of them hoping they would make a good appetizer.
