this recipe only calls for 4 oz of salmon??? thats crazy! a quater pound? i bought 2 pounds of fresh salmon, and a huge amount of fresh dill. salmon came out moist and flaked with a fork nicely, but it had no real flavor. i couldnt taste the dill, and i thought it was just average. i didnt modify a thing, i wish i would of. my expectations of recipes with as many stars as this one are way higher.

This was a really great dish. Who knew such little ingredients would make salmon taste this fantastic! The salmon was so moist. Hubby liked it and he's not a salmon lover. I also added a clove of garlic to the pot while it was  cooking. This is definitely a keeper!

I substituted a tablespoon of dry dill for the fresh, and added 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.
The end result was enjoyable

I followed the recipe without modification.  The texture of the salmon was nice and moist.  But the taste was, well, nonexistent.  It was soo bland!  Salt and a lot of pepper had to be added at the table.

The salmon comes out a bit bland in this preparation. The dill doesn't really get to do much here, which is too bad as I do quite like some dill. The salmon itself did come out pretty nicely prepared. With a little salt, pepper, and lemon juice, it ended up being good enough.

I mainly used this recipe to see how to poach!! It turned out SO juicy and delicious!! I coated it with blackened spices, very tastey!! I also used vegetable stock and water to boil the fish. Yummy!

Great recipe! I used dried dill since I didn't have fresh (just sprinkled some into the stock) and it worked well. Nice, easy way to prepare salmon. The time was perfect for me even at a high altitude.

Four stars because it was really moist but it had little flavor. I will add my own touch next time I make this.

This is a great and simple recipe for a high quality piece of salmon. The dill flavor is extremely subtle, so you'll want to have great fish so that the flavor of the salmon takes center stage.  I sprinkled the fish with a bit of salt and pepper before putting it in the pot, but made no other substitutions/changes. I served it with roasted fennel and scapes and orzo with feta.

Very easy to make, and VERY tasty! I used about a tablespoon and a half of dill herb paste instead of fresh dill [because my local grocery store is SMALL!] but it stil turned out very well. HOWEVER: This is not a powerfully flavoured dish. The dill flavour is very subtle ... but it's still delicious!!

As a rather reluctant dieter, I've been trying to find healthy alternatives to a Big Mac with Fries.  I don't care for salmon, but tried this recipe in an effort to be good.  I was astounded by the rich flavor!  I added some Chardonnay and a handful of chopped dill to the poaching broth, which tasted too good to waste, so I had it as a first course.  Far, far better than grilled salmon in my book!

I can't believe how delicious something so healthy could taste! I followed the recipe but also added fresh garlic and chopped shallots to the broth. It turned out flavorful and juicy. Next time I may try to thicken the broth leftovers and add some capers, then use as a sauce over pasta. My boyfriend who is very picky about fish said this is one of his top 10 favorite dishes.

As others suggested I added flavor to the recipe by slicing onions and lemon pepper seasoning. My family loves salmon and said it was their new favorite preparation. Make sure and have good bread to dip in the poaching broth!

This was good but not nearly what I expected after reading everyone's comments.  My husband tolerated it with a smile but asked for me to make salmon how I used to (baked or fried).

Not bad.  I added some lemon juice like one of the other reviewers said, and lots of dill.  It was super easy and fast, but the flavor is just okay.

Wonderfully easy and quick!!! I didn't have any kitchen twine so I just threw the bunch of dill in the pot. It was delicious to have the dill sprinkled over the salmon with each bite.  I served with brussel sprouts sauteed in olive oil w/ salt and pepper then steamed them for a minute.

This was ok. The two guys I made it for were impressed. But it stinks up your house and doesn't taste that "dilly".

Recipe as written is OK. Very healthy but bland.  Good base to build. Will add either garlic, wine, onion etc to improve flavor. 
I will use stock for soup

Good recipe. Added pepper, lemon juice, shallots and garlic and used dried dill (1.5 tablespoons) and it came out with a good amount of flavor.

Having a hubby who is an avid fisherman I am always on the lookout for new ways to make salmon. That being said, I have never poached it and was a little leery of it. We both really enjoyed this recipe! Unfortunately I only had dried dill on hand but I'm sure it would of been that much better using fresh. It was simple and quick to make!  I will be definitely be making this again.
