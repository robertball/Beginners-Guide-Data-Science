I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and was astonished watching the yams disappear from the table. These were really a hit.

I make almost exactly the same thing every year for Thanksgiving. the only thing i do different is add some maple syrup to the yams (about 1/2 to a 1/4 cup depending on how big your sweet tooth is)  I also just use canned yams to make life a little easier.

I think this recipe was good, I just added a little oj(not to much) to it, and it came out pretty good.

I made this for our Christmas dinner yesterday.  Everyone liked it.  I think next time I would only use 1 can of pinapple, and 1/3 or 1/4 pound of the currants (actually used golden grapes as I couldn't find golden currents).  It's a easy recipie and since there's no butter or heavy cream, I didn't feel gulity eating a second helping!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews.   My only change was using chopped raisins in lieu of currants.  I think next time I may leave off the marshmallows.

I made this for the Thanksgiving inner yam request.  It was really very good - very light - and I'm not a yam fan.
