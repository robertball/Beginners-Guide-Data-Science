Purely subjective of course, but  I am convinced that smoothies with mangoes in them are among the best.   This one is particularly good and Hubs agrees - strawberries and mango are clearly a match made in heaven.  Other than using strawberry yogurt rather than plain, I did not add or omit any ingredients.  I did, however, change the amounts of them, using more fruit, less yogurt.  It was a happy accident that in an effort to use up this perishable fruit I came up with a smoothie that, as Hubs put it, was pleasantly less sour than most.   The only problem was that it could have been colder.  I wonder if my forgetting to include the ice cubes had anything to do with that.

I thought this was really good. It's definitely not a sweet smoothie, which is perfect for me because I don't like overly sweet things, but others might want to add more honey or use a vanilla yogurt.   I used Greek non-fat yogurt and the smoothie came out really smooth. This makes more like 2 servings instead of 4, unless you only like a really small glass.

Used frozen fruit mix, which made it more difficult to blend (my Blendtec turned the mix into ice cream until it warmed up more). Super easy and delicious!

I made it per the recipe, adding a little vanilla, and the whole family liked it. I thought it was a little sour from the plain yogurt, so might try substituting some vanilla yogurt next time, maybe 1/2.
