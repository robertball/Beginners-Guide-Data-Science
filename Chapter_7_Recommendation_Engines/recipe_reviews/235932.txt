I've grilled these twice now.  First time, I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla with the cinnamon and brown sugar then added water to make thinner.  Second time, I cut back a little on the cinnamon as I'm not a huge fan and didn't add water.  Water wasn't needed at all.  It was so good both times.  We put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Yummo!  The pineapple is soooo sweet and juicy.  My favorite dessert.

Make it exactly how it says except my wife (who is from Brazil)  Said don't grill it. Bake it in a covered glass dish. The juice ends up being soaked up and provides a much better flavor.

The caramelized effect loses its potential on the grill because it all melts off.  Grilling tenderized the pineapple and some of the flavor stuck, but it may be best to grill it in a pan to keep the caramel.

I've been grilling pineapple for years.  I just use a little cinnamon.  If you have a ripe pineapple it's plenty sweet after it caramelizes on the grill.  The brown sugar makes it to sugary sweet for me.

My favorite thing at Tucano's Brazilian Steakhouse is their grilled pineapple - guess I don't have to go back now!  At the suggestion of another reviewer I omitted the cinnamon and added some vanilla.  I also cooked mine in our wok instead of out on our grill.  It was *so* good, and super super easy :)

These are fabulous!  I used them to make pineapple shortbread.  Took a piece of angel food cake, added a scoop of vanilla ice cream, the pineapple slice and whipped cream.  SO GOOD!  I think this would also be lovely with coconut ice cream.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! I would just recommend to cut the sugar and cinnamon in half because if your pineapple is already sweet, it doesn't need a lot of sugar; also to put it in the oven instead of on the grill (preheat about 350). It caramelizes way better!

Real simple recipe... I think I may add vanilla or soak the pineapple in rum prior to grilling next time.

Out of this world.  I gave my guests a choice of this or plain pineapple.  Those who don't mind sugar loved it.  I loved it too.

I cut the sugar/cinnamon mixture in half and they were still great.  Served with vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of hot fudge.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a winner.  I did cut the ingredients in half and it was plenty sweet. It tasted very similar to the pineapple I have had in Brazilian restaurants.  I liked being able to cook it in the oven.  I cooked it for 15 minutes and turned the pineapple half way through the baking process.  I used a glass-top dish as recommended by another reviewer.  I now use this one instead of the Trisha Yearwood recipe.

Tasted amazing.  I think we lucked out with a good pineapple, but it was really yummy grilled.  I added a little vanilla like the others said.

AWESOME!  I've made grilled pineapple before but never cut into wedges.  I love it made that way.  I can see making this for a crowd and slicing the wedges and serving with toothpicks after they're grilled.  My changes were to cut into 8 wedges not 6 and to rub the wedges with the brown sugar mixture as I was out of plastic bags.  The flavor was awesome and I will be using this recipe often.  Thank you SoccerNut for sharing!

Probably would have been better if I had grilled or baked it.  I smoked it instead to go w the rest of the smoked meal.  Flavor was good but not cooked long enough.  Need to try again and either prepare for longer time smoking or follow directions :)

We loved it! I used 2 pineapples with the amount of brown sugar and cinnamon listed for 1 pineapple and think I'll cut it back even more next time. But I'm definitely planning to make this again.

Made this just as directions stated, only made a smaller amount therefore ingredients were adjusted accordingly. This turned out really nice as a side dish to go along with a grilled red snapper and grilled corn on the cob.

I made this indoors on our panini press since I had used it for the main course.  The drip pan was almost filled with juice but otherwise the press worked well and caramelized the fruit.  Following a suggestion in a review I added a little vanilla extract.  I also added a little cayenne for balance.  Maybe chile  powder might be a good addition or substitution.  Served over ice cream this was really good.  This recipe would probably work well with mango or peach.

Awesome recipe! I used the recipe as is and added vanilla extract as mentioned in other comments. I also baked instead of grilled and results were perfect! Definitely making again but would like to add some dough for a cobbler effect.

I used a grilling plate and it turned out well. If it is sticking, you probably forgot to oil the grill. Taste wise it was good,  but most thought the cinnamon was too strong. I think it needs something to offset the sweetness. Will try the vanilla suggestion next time. May also put some chili powder or paprika in it.

YUM!  Made it exactly as specified.  Except I can't cut pineapple very well.  So while it looked a bit messy, it tasted marvelous!   Even the hubby loved it and he's hard to impress when it comes to pineapple.

Not sure what I loved more, the sweet inviting   smell of brown sugar and cinnamon caramelizing on the charcoal grill or eating the delicious results.  Possibly the best pineapple I've ever eaten!  Definitely saving this one.

I made this for Easter Dinner this weekend. I cut the pineapple into 8 spears and coated them one at a time in a gallon-sized ziploc bag. Grilled them 3 minutes on each side on medium-high. Turned grill on low until dinner was served. So good and so easy!

Husband said it would be great with vanilla ice cream. I used canned pineapple that I had on hand and it was absolutely delicious. Would be even better with fresh pineapple.

I grilled it in a grill-pan but it was soon filling up the kitchen with smoke. Almost set off the smoke detector there. My dad didn't like the burnt taste and he felt it was to hard/messy to eat. My husband liked it. It was just okay for me. Next time, I would do as someone else suggested and bake it instead.

Delicious. I spent a good two years down in South America, specifically Paraguay. The best restaurant in the whole country was a Brazilian grill called Paulinos. They made these (a little different in cooking method but taste just the same). Of course the pineapple was better down there than what you can get in the continental US. But still brought back the nostalgia. Will be making again.

This was delicious, even though I omitted the sugar.  It was plenty sweet without it, and I'll definitely make it many times in the future!

We will certainly be making this again, but adding a bit honey to the bag certainly ups the sweetness level. Good stuff.

We used canned pineapple, as that's what was in the house, and it worked quite well with the pineapple rings.

Excellent. After reading the other reviews I find it disappointing they didn't give five stars for simple problems that occurred. Basting the pineapple keeps the brown sugar glaze on. Yes a ripe pineapple may be a little too sweet. Select a nice pineapple, one that is not over ripe, and you will have a delicious treat. I paired this with pork chops over a wood grill. There were no leftovers!

This is REALLY good grilled pineapple!  I had a bowl of cubed pineapple that no one was eating.  I found this recipe and put it on metal skewers and served it along side 'Barbecued Pork Kebabs', 'Trees, Seeds and Beans' from AR and grilled green beans.  The pineapple was fabulous, and every cube was eaten.  Thanks SoccerNut, for sharing your recipe.  It definitely is a keeper!

this is real good if you coat the pineapple with BBQ sauce then coat it with the brown sugar and cinnamon then grilled till it just starts turning a golden brown
