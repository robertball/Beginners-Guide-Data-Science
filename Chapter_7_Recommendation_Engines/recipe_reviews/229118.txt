Great mix of flavors! I picked this because it was interesting enough for adults but also had good bits the kids could pick out. I served it with mixed springs green to bulk it up and it worked just great.

Delicious, refreshing salad.  The fresh basil really adds the extra layer to the salad.  Without that it would not have been nearly as tasty.
