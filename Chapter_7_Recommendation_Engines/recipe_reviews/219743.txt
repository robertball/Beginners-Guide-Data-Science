I enjoyed this salad. I didn't have bacon so I used bacon bits. Kind of embarrased, but I am out of ketchup and sugar and have very little olive oil, so I couldn't make the dressing. I used a bottled french dressing.

Everyone loved it even non-salad lovers. Added 1 more Tbsp of Wocestershire for added zest. Sooooo easy!

I was looking for a spinach salad dressing recipe like one I made years ago.   I finally found it!  This is delicious! It is my summer craving and I can't get enough. It is amazing just the way made as posted. Depending what I have on hand or my mood I may leave out bacon, or egg and add lots of other colorful veggies in.  No matter what I do to it, it is amazing!  We made it last night for dinner as listed, it was a hit. Today for lunch with added red,yellow and orange peppers, and grape tomatoes, and I could not get enough.  Still have lots of dressing left, (yum)  now to go buy more spinach. Very versatile, great for families, cookouts, and crowd pleasing.

So easy, delicious and healthy! The dressing is basically a Catalina dressing. I had a homemade version on hand and just used that. I would not think to add it to a salad like this, but it did complement the salad nicely. Thanks for the recipe!

I love the salad dressing.  I used 1/8 c. water and 1/8 cup oil and
splenda for the sugar to help cut down a little fat and sugar.  This is a family favorite for any kind of salad.

Really good and simple enough to make. I only got a little on my plate because it was mostly gone when I sat down (just me and the BF ate lol) so that speaks volumes since hes not much of a veggies eater. Watch the sugar since how much you need will really depend on your brand of ketchup and I had to add salt to mine but again depends on what ketchup your using. I used all the drippings from the bacon and added enough oil to make the 1/4c needed. I wold totally make this one again!

I've taken this to potlucks and  have gotten rave reviews as well as requests to bring it the next time.   It is easy to prepare the night before although I don't put the dressing in until right before serving.   I also take a portion with no bacon for my friends who don't eat pork.  This is definitely my go-to spinach salad recipe.

I used bacon bits as well and the salad was quite good. The dressing is what makes the salad. I usually only make half of the dressing and double the salad components.

I made this last summer for a Summer Kick Off party.  It became my go-to salad for the entire summer.  I would make a large jar of dressing and keep it handy for a quick salad at a moment's notice.  Can't wait to make it again!  Oh, and extra bacon is always good.  :)

Yummy! Haven't had this in years but suddenly remembered it when faced with a lot of salad to use up. I used half olive oil and half veggie oil and it still tasted amazing! Next time, I'll sub a little water for some of the oil and try some stevia for some of the sugar. I plan on making this again soon!

I didn't add the onion because I didn't have one, and I forgot the Worcestershire sauce.  It was a hit at our house.  All the children loved it, as did my husband and me.

This is a great salad; although I would suggest cutting back on the sugar. Especially for pre-diabetic and diabetics. Still tastes great.

Thank you for this delicious recipe! I brought this salad to a dinner party. I went back for seconds, but it was gone! 3 people asked me for the recipe. The only substitution I made, was olive oil. This will be a weekly salad at our house.

Very tasty recipe, especially since the dressing ingredients are so simple and usually on hand. The bacon with the tangy dressing is perfect.
