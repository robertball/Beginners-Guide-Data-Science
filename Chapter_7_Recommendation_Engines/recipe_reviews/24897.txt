This was very good.  Took it to a ball windup and received lots of compliments.  I did make changes though.  The things I changed are:  used 1 cup basmati rice and 2 cups water with one garlic clove.  I added a whole can black beans, one red pepper, bunch of chopped cilantro, used olive oil instead of veg oil, used  white wine vinegar instead of regular vinegar, added 1 large jalepeno, sprinkled with cumin.  Will definitely make again.

Overall a nice basic recipe. When I make again I will make a few adjustments. I used a fresh jalapeno, removing the seeds, which didn't provide enough zing to the dressing. Next time will use the prepared jalapeno and maybe add some cumin or cilantro to pep up the dressing. I used white vinegar which was a little strong for my taste. I will either cut down on the amount or use rice vinegar for a lighter taste. Also, needed some crunch, so chopped bell pepper or even celery would be a good addition. And cheese is kind of unnecessary, added calories but not much taste...

Great recipe!  I've made it several times.  It goes well with my daughter and I who are vegetarian and also with my non-vegetarian husband and son. Will continue to make.

I served this at a family Labor Day party and it was great!  I used diced green chilies instead of the peppers (mostly because I didn't have any peppers), and it turned out great.  My family loved it and the hostess insisted on keeping the leftovers!

This recipe was superb! I just made a few changes. I used basmati rice for extra flavor, white wine vinegar, and added about 1 tsp or so of unsalted taco seasoning mix. Also, as other reviewers have noted, I only used about half the dressing and made it early in the day so it was packed with flavor by dinner time. Awesome alongside Debbie Donham's Chicken Enchiladas. Thanks Terri!

Very tasty! I would add another tablespoon of jalepenos to give it more of a kick. My husband expressed doubts when I showed him this recipe, but he had 4 helpings!

This was very very tasty!  The ingredients all went very well together.  My only complaint is that it was not very good the second day.  All of the ingredients tasted too much like vinegar.  Next time I will probably only make half as much as not to have leftovers.

This salad was excellent!  Followed recipe exactly.  Next time will double the jalapeno for a little more zip.  Will also add some chopped cilantro for flavor just because I love it.  Will definitely make again.

This was just ok for me. My husband said it was too vinegary, but I didn't think that was the problem. I just think it really needed some seasoning. After I added some garlic powder and a little chili powder it was better, but still not great.

Yum!  A hit!  Might get 5 stars...everyone liked it & it was almost finished by 4 people as a side dish (to a small meal).  I forgot the avocado.  Omitted onions due to someone's preference.  Very good, would make again; maybe more veggies would be nice, some chopped peppers or so for crunch.

I took the advice of some of the others and used a can of diced green chiles.  All in all this was pretty good but I thought the dressing was bland.

This is great.  I add fresh minced garlic to the water before cooking the rice, and I also like to add some chopped cilantro to the dressing.

I made this to go with steak and salad for dinner.  It was really good, but I added about 1 1/2 tsp of powder fajita seasoning to the dressing and used a whole jalapeno.  I'll make again but if taking to a barbecue with others would definitely have to double, it doesn't make that much.

I was in desperate need of a side dish for a mexican dinner and this recipe was awesome!  I suggest that you add the black beans to the dressing to marinate while the rice cools or even longer.  I also wouldn't add all the dressing to the salad as it makes it way too soggy.  As my husband would say "this is a homerun"!

I've made this twice, both times deleting the jalapenos, avacado, but then adding some salsa (about a cup).  Excellent!  The second time, I also deleted the cheese, since I dont' think it needs it.  Both my kids said they "want to see this one again."  And they will  :-)   Thanks, Terri.

My whole family loves this salad.  It is definitely better the next day as the flavors have a chance to blend.  I have made it without the peppers & avocado & it still tastes great.  You can make it with less dressing, though, & it is still good.

I liked this one, but the family didn't.  You have to really like marinated salads, I think.  If I was going to make it again, I think the dressing can be cut by 1/2 without any harm to the dish.

Yummy! I used instant white rice and half a can of black beans, olive oil in place of the veg. oil. This was a nice salad! Oh I didn't have any avocado so I left that out and used serrano peppers for the jalapenos.

Great recipe - very colorful. I modified it by adding lots of chopped sweet peppers (red, orange, yellow and green), some red onion along with the green onions, lots more jalapenos, less oil in the dressing (2:1 with the vinegar), less dressing overall based on other comments, reduced fat shredded cheddar (couldn't tell the difference), and cumin in the dressing. Will definately make again! Thanks.

This is a refreshing and unique salad.  I am always looking for an alternative summertime (cold) side dish (pasta and potato salads get old after a while), and you just don't see many rice salads!  I used basmati rice and it stayed nice and firm even after a couple days.  I increased the rice to 1 cup (2c water), and used the same amount of dressing and it was perfect - it was all soaked up.  I left out the jalepenos (kids) and avacado's too - just don't have those around, but added a little salsa (had about 1/2 cup in fridge) and about a tsp of McCormic Santa Fe spice blend, and it was wonderful!  A nice healthy side dish!

Excellent salad as is, I did make a couple changes though based on other reviewers ~ omitted cheese, added cumin and lime juice and used Olive Oil instead of Veg Oil.  Let it sit for a few hours to get the flavours to meld.  Very good and I was able to use up leftover rice and black beans from the weekend (it's nice to find a recipe that you can throw things leftover together!)

It was a big hit, even with my Mexican sister in-law.  I made it without the avocado (I did not have one).  I also added a can of drained/rinsed red beans.  The dressing, though simple was real good.  Unique pot luck dish

PHENOMENAL!!  Admittedly, I had a few small changes that I didn't necessarily intend on, but here they were.  I opted to leave out the cheese as I didn't feel that it would lend much to this salad, plus, the extra calories are not required with so many other flavours going on!  I realized I was actually out of jalapenos (abnormal!), so ended up adding in some chipotle chili powder and some superb dried spice mix that has chilies and jalapenos in it.  I did use more equal amounts of vinegar and oil as I always change those ratios for my salads.  I used some white balsamic/red wine vinegar along with really good quality olive oil.  This salad was honestly to die for, seriously!  My original goal was to use up my lone avocado, I hate to waste any of them!  A repeat for sure, one you can make a meal out of!

I made this last night as a side for my chicken enchiladas. Absolutely fabulous and quick to make!  Next time I might add a can of corn to the salad. It would also be great on its own with grilled chicken breast on top.

Loved it!  As others suggested I added some garlic when cooking the rice.  I doubled the vinegrette and added 1 tsp cumin, and poured this over the black beans while I was preparing the rest.  I also added a small can of corn, and left out the avocado.  I used white wine vinegar and basmati rice.  It was very delicious and will be a regular.  Nice and colorful for taking to a party too!  Thanks!

This was great!  I did not have a jalapeno so I added some chili pwd and some hot sauce.  It worked perfectly.  I also added some canned chicken to make it more of a meal.  I will be using this one a lot.  I also let my dressing sit for 30 mins before adding it to my rice.

This was pretty good. I didnt have tomatoes so I used a can of Rotel. I think next time I will mix 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of salsa - I like a creamier dressing instead of a vinegar. Good for lunch though - thanks

This was really good. I let the rice sit out so it was room temp. and not so chilled--- so it wasnt hard.It was simple and looked nice. I added a little extra rice and there was still enough dressing. Its a keeper!

Great summer vegetarian salad that I loved and I'm a big steak and potatoes person. I used white wine vinegar, a dab of texas pete and substituted white sugar with brown sugar. Wonderful.

GREAT recipe!  I love the vinegar in it - it gives it just the right amount of tanginess.  I added one ear of corn since I had some left over in the fridge and I liked it in the salad.  Excellent!  I served it with tacos (made with seasoning from this website!)

This salad is wonderful.  I made it with brown rice and as other posters have stated it's very fresh.  Add a bit of dressing to adjust to your preference instead of just pouring it all on.  I'm not a fan of that much olive oil in my food.  I'll definately be making it again.

WOW!!!! Superb with the following changes:  1. Dried black beans soaked overnight and cooked the next day in water with chicken base (or bullion), beef base, garlic powder, onion powder, garlic salt, cumin, greek seasoning and chili powder.  2. Brown rice baked in water with chicken base, beef base, onion powder, garlic powder and olive oil.  3. Add to salad: corn, cilantro, green pepper 4. Dressing: olive oil, red wine vinegar, sugar, cumin, greek seasoning and NO SALT.   Now its wonderfully delicious!!!

This recipe is so different from the typical salad, and I loved it. It is such a beautiful, healthy, delicious dish. I used brown rice and that was terrific (although I'm a white rice rice lover and want to try that next). I would advise serving the avocado on the side if you're not sure about the tastes of those who will consume it. I made this for a potluck that required gluten-free and vegetarian dishes -- not an easy thing to accommodate -- and it was a hit. My gluten-free aunt continues to rave about this salad months later.

This was so good!  I did add cilantro, garlic and celery.  I replaced vegetable oil with olive oil.  Best rice salad I've ever made.  I was surprised how well it tasted the second day after reading some of the reviews.  This recipe is a keeper!

I took this salad to a school luncheon.  Everyone loved it.  I did follow the suggestion for using garlic flavored rice vinegar and adding red and yellow bell pepper.  I took the liberty of adding chicken as well.  Turned out Great!

Refreshing salad. I used orzo instead of rice ,but kept true to the recipe otherwise. Once made and tasted (Perfectly fine as is) I added more black beans, yellow corn, yellow & red peppers for a personal touch. So whether you stay exact to recipe or doctor it up a little bit it is a nice change from the usual salads at BBQs.

This was just okay.  I was actually a bit disappointed because it sounded so good.  Just seemed like it was missing something... and I added cilantro and lime juice.  I probably won't make it again.

This is a great cold rice salad... you can prepare just as listed and be delighted.  I decided to add 2 tablespoons of fresh garlic and 2 tablespoons of fresh cilantro. Delicious!

I love this recipe! It is very refresing. Would be fantasic for a backyard BBQ. The flavors are clean and fresh! I did add crushed garlic to the oil and let sit for a bit and I think next time I would forget about the cheese all together and add some fresh corn kernels.

LOW FAT version: Use wild rice or brown rice. You do NOT need the OIL! Or Avocado. Just use seasonings, cumin or Lowrys or Curry. This is so good without the oil and you can even use low fat Mozz cheese, heat it up in the microwave & store in fridge. Good for 3-4 days. Very high in fiber.

With a few tweaks, this is 5-stars.  I used Texmati rice, increased to 1-cup, with 2 cups water; increased black beans to 1-cup.  Made dressing using 1/4 cup oil; 1/4 cup white wine vinegar; jalapeno as called for plus 1/2 tsp cumin and salt to taste.  As another reviewer suggested, I made the dressing and poured it over the black beans while I prepared the rice.  Flavor was great and this amount of dressing was perfect.  I did not use cheese or avocado.  Served last night with Chile Verde and flour tortillas and it was great.  Today for lunch, I flaked a leftover salmon filet into the salad while it returned to room temp.  Excellent!

I made this recipe exactly as written....all I could taste was vinegar.  I did use apple cider vinegar, maybe milder white vinegar would be less noticeable.  I think I'd cut it down to only 2 T., and cut the oil down also.  The delicate flavors of the avocado and other ingredients just didn't come through.  I think added seasoning like cumin may help.  Maybe even using a little mayonnaise instead of oil and vinegar would help it.  There are good ingredients in this salad ......I'd like to make it and be able to enjoy all of them without them being masked by the heavy vinegar taste.  Another thing......I added about 1 T. of sugar, maybe a bit more as the salad was too sour with just 1/2 t.

This was so good. I used rice wine vinegar and left out the sugar and avocado (mine had gone bad). I also added a dash of cumin. I ate mine with tortilla chips, but the next time I'd use this for a homemade burrito bowl.

As written - 4 stars. With modifications - 5 stars. I used less vinegar and oil when making up the dressing. I also used brown rice since I don't keep white on hand. Be sure to add the dressing gradually, to taste.

It was not so bad, but tasted bland. I will try to add coriander to the leftovers. Be careful with the dressing: I have put the full amount but it was too much, so I suggest to add it gradually. Don't forget to put some lemon juice on the avocado otherwise it will get dark.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but this wasn't good.  The only thing I could taste was the oil for the dressing.  My husband wasn't a big fan either.

I thought this was quite good.  We did use white wine vinegar, 2 cloves of garlic, diced red pepper and cucumber, and about 1/2 t. cumin.  I only added about 1/4 c. cheese to cut down fat.  Next time I might add crisp white corn kernels instead of cucumber (which was what I had on hand to add some crunch).  Thanks for the recipe!

I served this as a side for Baja Chipotle Fish Tacos & while I really enjoyed it, my hubby & grandson did not. I did make a couple of changes...I omitted the avocado because I am out, I used rice wine vinegar, greatly decreased the cheese (I only added enough to add a bit of color), used minute rice *blushing*, & I added some cilantro & cumin. Maybe the lack of the avocado ruined it for my hubby & grandson but I still thought it was very good. Despite their lack of enthusiasm for the dish, it makes a perfect side for many Mexican dishes so I will make it again.

I made this with quinoa, and it was delicious! I did make a few modifications, though: I substituted half red-wine and half apple-cider vinegar for white, olive oil for vegetable oil, and a sprinkling of stevia for sugar. I also left out the cheese and added a clove of minced garlic. The creamy texture of the beans and avocado was wonderful and balanced out the tanginess of the vinegar. I topped each serving with green hot sauce for a little extra kick. This is a new favorite!

We really like this.  It’s easy to make with leftover rice. I skip the avocado, because of food intolerances, but it’s still very good!

This was okay. I also added cumin, cilantro, and frozen corn. I subsituted rice vinegar and olive oil. I brought it to a party and everyone seemed to really like it. I don't know if I'll make this again.
