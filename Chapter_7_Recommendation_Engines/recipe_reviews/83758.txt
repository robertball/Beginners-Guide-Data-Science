This was a very good recipe for a quick lunch or get together.  I made this and a fresh loaf of Italian bread and it was great for a small gathering of Moms that I had over my house.  I added curry powder to the mayonaise/sour cream mixture and it was great.  I also only added enough dressing to coat the pasta and eveyrthing else.  I reserved the rest in case the salad dried out while it was in the refridgerator.  It never did, so I actually think next time I will cut the mayo mixture down.

I used canneloni pasta because it is more elegant.  Overall this was very tasty.

I made this with ring noodles and added bacon crumbles. For seasoning I used onion powder, celery salt, and a dash of cayenne. I omitted the celery root and lettuce. I thought it was a really tasty lunch salad!

My whole family loved this salad!  I followed the recipe exactly with two minor exceptions - I did not have celery root, so I used a sprinkle of celery seed instead. and I used cavatappi pasta in place of the mostaccioli because I thought the double elbows make a prettier salad. It goes together so easily.  We had the romaine lettuce on the side as a separate salad.  A very refreshing summer dish and a great way to use leftover turkey!  Thank you for sharing.
