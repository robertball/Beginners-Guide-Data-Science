Love it!!! Super easy to make. Felt like I could have cut the potatoes a little smaller, and added more salt. Took 5.5 hours on low in crockpot, this may have been because of the potato size. My husband and mother in law loved it as well. Definitely making this one again.

It was ok. I used hot Italian turkey sausage instead of pork. But there is absolutely no reason to use a crock pot. This cooked up in 1/2 hour. If I’m going to brown the onions and the sausage, why dirty another pot?  It doesn’t need to cook for 5 hours.

I substituted ground Italian pork sausage and it was fantastic!   I probably added more onion, garlic and kale as well.  Family and friends were impressed.  Can’t wait to make it again.

I’ve been making Zuppa Toscana for years. I use mild Italian sausage and bump the heat with chili flakes. I also cook bacon until crisp, then cook the onions and sausage in the fat. I drain the fat when done.  I cook kale until just barely cooked. And if I have a Parmesan rind, I add that to the broth for extra flavor. My family loves it. Agree, no need to use a slow cooker as it doesn’t take long to make.

I used Bob Evans Italian Sausage and bread crumbs and made tiny meatballs in oven then added to crock pot and soup mix.  I also precooked cut up potato to soften before adding to soup.  Was DELISH and easy to make. Making double batch next time since was gone the day I made it.

Great recipe and yummy.  Here are the changes I made, used Swiss Chard. as I had on hand. Replaced the sausage with Turkey sausage, replaced the cream (who needs the fat) with 1 cup of 2% milk.  Having the 
leftovers tonight, so added 2 cans of whole clams with their juice, so it'll be like clam chowder with a twist. Serving it with crusty French bread.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

Would give this 10 stars if I could!!  So easy, my Husband made it!!!  This really IS so easy & turns out SO GOOD!!!  I think it's even better than that chain restaurant that made it famous, & I was able to compare it on the same day (rehet homemade for lunch, then a friend's surprise visit to take me to supper-her treat, her pick).  
Changes made: I always substitute evaporated milk for cream when I can (1 can for this recipe), & the husband couldn't find the red pepper flakes so he used a heavy sprinkle of cayenne pepper instead. 
Note: Since VICHYSSOISE is, basically, cold potato soup, I gave this Zuppa Toscana soup a taste cold, & ended up eating the rest of the leftovers that way!  SO GOOD!!  We only had leftovers because I portioned this out into storage containers while serving & there's only 2 of us.

Substituted veggie broth for chicken broth, Tofurkey Italian sausage for  Italian pork sausage, 1% milk for heavy cream, and added crimini mushrooms and Italian seasoning.  It came out really flavorful and I'll definitely make it again.  Excellent with bread, salad, and red wine.

Told hubby I was making kale soup for supper so of course he was not looking forward to the meal. Boy was he surprised after taking the first bite. This soup was fantastic and got me plenty of great meal compliments from hubby.

I followed the recipe exactly except my Zuppa needed much more cooking time. But it is excellent & even better the next day. Thank you for this healthy soup.

Excellent!  I made it using exact ingredients. Only change I made was I cooked it on the stove instead of using a slow cooker because I didn’t want to wait. I will definitely make it again.

The consistency and taste was off. It looked and tasted like milk was added to water. Not at all like the Olive Garden Zuppa Tuscana soup unfortunately.

I made as directed using turkey sausage. My soup (potato consistency) was near done on low after 3 -1/2 hours. I used a 1/2 of a very large bag of chopped kale and it took 35+ minutes to soften on high at the end of the 3.5 hours. Needed more flavor. Add more seasoning..very necessary. I ended up adding about 1 t dried Italian Seas at the end. I also used 1/2 cream and 1/2 non fat 1/2 n 1/2

My husband is a huge fan of this soup at Olive Garden.  So, I was excited to make it for him.  He loved it!  It was easy to make--I will definitely be making this one again soon.  Thanks for the recipe.

As always, this soup was delicious.  However, when I make it, I cook bacon in with the sausage.  If I don't have real bacon on hand I add some Kirkland bacon pieces to the sausage.  Bacon takes it from a 4 star to a 5 star rating!

I like to use the slow cooker overnight (on weekends) so I prepped the soup before I went to bed knowing that I would wake up to start it overnight.  Sure enough, I woke up at 2 AM, put it in the slow cooker and set it for six hours on low; I didn't start it early because I didn't want to end up with mushy potatoes.  Finished it (added the kale and cream) when I woke up at 8 AM so I could take it to my parents' house.  They loved it!

Tasty.  Perfect for a winter, rainy day.  I did not saute the garlic and onions.  I simply placed everything in the crock pot and cooked on high for 4 hours.  I also precooked the sausage.  Worked well for a quick throw together meal.

I made it and the flavor was good but to many potatoes. I think I will use Italian sausage next time to add a little spice. Swiss chard sounds like a good idea.

I didn’t have bacon on hand, but I followed the recipe otherwise, and it was full of flavor. I also made it on the stove top since I didn’t have time to put it in the slow cooker.

Yum. I had to review because I hardly ever follow a recipe closely, unless it’s in baking. I make soup at least once a week and always come up with my own combinations. But this soup as is- fantastic! I’ve never actually had the soup from Olive Garden but I saw this recipe on Pinterest and thought it’d go well with what my Mom is making for Christmas dinner tomorrow evening. I am the only one who has tried it yet but I know it’ll be a hit. The only couple things I did differently were add more stock instead of water, and some garlic salt. I can’t wait to serve this!

So yummy but don't accidentally make with ground pork (and have to add all the sausage seasonings) like I did!

Made this for a Friday evening meal on a chilly evening. It was amazing and tasted just as good as the restaurant chain that serves it!! We followed the directions to the T and it was SPICY and excellent!! Only addition we made was adding bacon pieces as another one of the copy cat recipes called for.  I chose hot sausage instead of regular or mild to give it a bit more kick since my family likes spice. Lastly since I was in a hurry I purchased frozen precut potato pieces and frozen precut onions to use instead of cutting my own. Definitely will be making this again!!
