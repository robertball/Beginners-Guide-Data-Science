sure the heat is on, but the thermostat is definitely set at a reasonable level and everyone is plenty comfortable. we used the last portion of the chili in a baked spaghetti dish that was just plain dirty in  a XXX way, especially after shredding about six ounces of Tillamoook extra sharp cheddar cheese over it before it went in the oven. yeah, you heard me. don't EVEN pretend you aren't fantasizing about going home and doing the same, either. I know you want to!

I loved this tangy spicy chili. My hubby thought it was a bit spicy, but I thought it was just right. I served this over corn chips with grated cheddar and sour cream. I used chopped jalapeno instead of serrano. I used half the onion called for. I did add a can of kidney beans. I cut this half and only used ground beef. I didn't care for the chunks of tomaotes in it and next time maybe I'll use puree or crushed tomatoes. Thanks Scotdog for recommending this chili and Thanks jamjar for posting this one.

This was a great recipe. We made 2 additions: 2 cans of black beans and 2 habaneros. Next time we would use spicy sausage or something in place of the ground pork.

This chili is fabulous!!!! I just made a batch and absolutely love it.  The chili is perfectly spiced and you can just feel the heat at the back of your mouth with the first bite.  This recipe does make a really thin chili, but if you used tomato sauce instead of juice, or if you add a mixture of 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 1/4 cup warm water, it thickens up nicely.  I really can't say enough about how wonderful this chili is. Thanks a bunch!

This was so, so delish! I scaled to 6 servings but wish I had left it at 12. I skipped the oil and threw in 1 lb of ground meat with veggies. My local grocery store said they didn't have ground pork right now. Since I used lean ground beef I didn't even worry about draining the grease. Let this cook for several hours & my hubbie & I decided this was the best chili ever. Crush up tortilla chips in the bottom, pour chili & top with cheese. Mann, it was good!

I've made this chili about 4 or 5 times now, and it always gets great reviews from everyone. I subbed the serrano peppers with anaheim peppers(they are a little less spicy) and added a couple jalapenos as well. For the beer, I use Guinness Extra Stout, and I add cubed steak to the meat. We make cheesy corn bread to have with it,and top it with shredded cheddar and sour cream! We love it here! :)

This recipe produced a nice bean-free chile. I used two chiles after removing most of their seeds and ribs. There was still plenty of heat in the chili. I also used a 24oz bottle of Beck's dark ale with terrific results. This is not a thick, fork-stands-upright-in-the-bowl chile. I served it over brown basmati rice with grated cheese and sour cream one night and over baked potato the next. Like most chiles, this one tastes better the next day.

Great Chili, I replaced the serrano peppers with 3 hungarian and omitted the green bell pepper. I found the best results cane with using Sam Adams Oktoberfest (if available). Served over mashed potatoes patties fried to a golden brown. Have had multiple people claim "Best Chili Ever!!!"
