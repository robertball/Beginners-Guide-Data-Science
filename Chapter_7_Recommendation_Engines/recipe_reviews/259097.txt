Made these for church and  they vanished. Everyone seemed to like them.  The published recipe and the personal recipe both mentioned 3/4 c of brown sugar but there is no mention where to add it... the crust, the topping, the filling....?  Anyway, I left it out entirely and it  was perfect.  It would have been too sweet with the extra sugar.  4  cups of mangoes was 3 very large mangoes for me.

Delicious, but not enough topping. Like a few other reviewers, I didn't use brown sugar and did not see the need for it at all  I would double the crust recipe next time, and use half for the bottom and half for the top. OR, I'd use a 9X9 pan and cut down on the mango mixture. Once I added cornstarch, it thickened really quickly so next time I'd also cook the fruit down a few more minutes before adding it.

I followed the instructions exactly, minus the brown sugar. There was not enough of the dough to spread a top and bottom layer. I actually ended up making half another batch of dough. All I can think is the pan size is wrong. On the taste scale it was ok, tasted best right out of the oven hot. A little too buttery, but it passed with the family.

Very flexible easy recipe! Made this last night and it's almost gone less than 24 hours later. Husband and kids loved it!  I did adjust the recipe for the ingredients I had on hand - almonds instead of macadamia nuts, honey instead of white sugar in the filling, and frozen tropical mix of mangoes, strawberries, pineapples, and peaches (I chopped the larger chunks) instead of fresh chopped mangoes. What a forgiving recipe!  Honey worked just fine and I didnâ€™t focus on reducing, just cooked down the fruit filling until it looked thick enough. Used only 3 tbsp cornstarch and that was enough. Can't wait to try this basic recipe for all different types of fruit combinations. Yum yum yum!

These have potential, but the recipe as-is has some issues.
First off, the reviewer that said that the crust was not enough to line a 13 x 9 pan was right.  I had to use the entire crust to be able to cover the bottom of the pan.
Second, the crust was very bland.  It really needs a hit of salt and maybe a dash of vanilla.
I altered the filling because I didn't see the point of adding water when mango releases so much liquid when it's cooked.  So, I cooked the mango with the sugar, lemon juice, and 2 tbsp cornstarch and it was just fine.
Since I used all of the crust on the bottom, I ended up throwing together a crumb topping to go on top.
As-is, the recipe is 3 stars, especially because the proportions are WAY off.  But, it can be made a 5-star recipe with some alterations.
