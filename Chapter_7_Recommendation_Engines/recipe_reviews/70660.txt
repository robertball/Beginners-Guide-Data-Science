This was an incredible recipe!  I only separated it into thirds because I'm not a big chocolate (center) fan and from what others' reviews on it were.  And, instead of forming them into egg shapes, I cheated and bought a silicone cupcake pan and just coated the insides with chocolate up the rim.  Then I set them in the freezer until hardened (about 5 minutes), filled up the molds with the filling about 7/8 full and sealed them in with melted chocolate.  I gave them to some family and neighbors and they thought they were store bought!  PERFECT!!!  Next time I'll get some white chocolate and color it with Easter colors and hand paint the designs on them.    I did one batch with 1 1/2 tsp. of peppermint extract and it tasted just like a peppermint patty, only better!    The peanut butter ones were the favorite of everyone (because my family is peanut butter lovers.  I did have a problem with the first batch of peanut butter being a little to dry, so the next batch I just added a Tablespoon at a time of milk and it made them perfect!  And the third batch I did with maraschino cherries chopped up and a little cherry extract.  Those were the favorites of everyone that I had to stash some for myself and the husband!  They were superb!  Thank you kindly for such a fantastic recipe!  My kids have LOVED helping me make these, not to mention they gobble them down before they even hit the fridge!

These are good & I like the idea that you get many kinds out of one batch.  I thought the peanut butter ones lacked that peanut butter flavor, but it may be just me.  Next time I'll play around with some other flavors which is really the best part of this recipe.  There are so many differnt combinations you could do.  Will definitely make again.  I did use a dipping chocolate over the chocolate chips though--works better and you don't have to worry about tempering the chocolate & it maybe getting bloom.  A mini crockpot works great for this--put chocolate in, let it sit stirring every so often so it doesn't burn on sides, when almost melted unplug it & the chocolate will finish melting & stay melted for a long time.  I made smaller eggs so that they were easier to dip-if prefer larger eggs then you'll have to use two forks.  I used different colored chocolates to decorate the outside like an Easter egg & to tell them apart.  Also used different chocolates to dip-did chocolate egg in white chocolate, did peanut butter in dark chocolate & cream in dark chocolate.  I didn't do the coconut because I was also serving macaroons so was worried about having too much.

I use melted Merckens chocolate discs, not chips and vegetable oil (the best tasting chocolate for these in my book are the Mercken's discs).  Also, I noted that you should refrigerate for a short while so the candies are easier to roll and dip.  These steps might help make these a favorite for you.

I have a lot of different comments for this recipe. This recipe would have been rated 5 stars except that the measurement given for the cocoa powder was wrong. Next time, I'll start with 1/4 cup and try that. I had to make another batch of eggs to add dough to the chocolate section, and I threw out much of the original chocolate mix. The overall recipe is a good one. I made miniature eggs and they worked out great. The chocolate eggs turned out very like rich, dark chocolate truffles which I covered in white chocolate. All of the eggs are getting rave reviews.  Variations I'll try next year: mix together chocolate dough and coconut dough and top with an almond; add raspberry extract in the chocolate eggs; orange for the vanilla dough; wrap vanilla dough on a maraschino cherry and dip, etc.   I used Guitard's chocolate, but I recommend Wilton's as Guitard's is hard to work with. Mark cookie sheets or chocolates so you can identify them after dipping. Shape all of your eggs on waxpaper lined cookie sheets before starting dipping. Make a lot of room in fridge for chilling dough.

Yum! I followed the directions (although, for me, 2½ pounds of icing sugar came to 10 cups) until step 2. My husband is allergic to coconut, so I did one part plain, one part peanut butter, one part Nutella (I used about 2/3 cup of the chocolate-hazelnut spread), and one part chocolate-orange (about ½ cup or so of cocoa and ½ tsp or so of orange extract, and then I mixed it in my hands to avoid crumbly batter). To make the egg-like shape, I rolled slightly-heaping teaspoonfuls of batter in my palms until it was like a ball and then I squished-and-rolled the ball slightly. Egg-like enough for me. :) I ended up with 61 'eggs'. I'm also using the chocolate melties for the coating. I'll add to my review after dipping, but the Nutella filling is AWESOME!!

This is a great recipe and makes lots of eggs!  Instead of coconut I made cherry-nut with maraschino cherries.  They were all good.  A keeper.

Followed the mint suggestion, added 1/2 teaspoon mint extract to the plain quarter.  Combined 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa, 1/4 cup hot chocolate mix and 1/4 cup chocolate milk powder for the chocolate ones, which worked well.  Just cocoa would have been dry/bitter.  Eggs tasted very good and held together well, but you have to keep them somewhere cool.  Peanut butter was the best imo.  You'll need more than 2 cups of chips to dip them all, but they're fine undipped too.

We love this recipe.  I've made it 3 times since last Easter and am about to make it again.  I do add a little more peanut butter to the eggs.  However, I found the cocoa powder eggs to be hard and gross.  We stick with the buttercream and peanut butter egss....Yum!

Although most of them were good, they were a lot of work.  The cream and coconut were the best.  The peanut butter and cocoa were drier, so I will add less next time.  They did get better the longer they sat.  Got a lot of compliments on these.

I only made the chocolate & coconut eggs, but they were delicious.  The filling was a bit of a challange to shape into little eggs because the heat of your hands softened the butter up.  For a festive Easter treat it was definitely worth the messiness.

My 10 year old daughter and I loved this recipe. The dough was very easy to handle. I made all the variations, and I used a small plastic egg (one half makes the shape of half an egg) sprayed with Pam to shape the dough. Awesome! You can also press these on any other molds and make candies for all occasions. Sprinkle with decorations immediately after dipping in chocolate since the coating sets quickly. Keeps really well at room temperature!

These were so yummy!  My mom and I had so much fun making these.  Everyone was so impressed and they disappeared so fast.  With a few adjustments, this recipe is perfect!  Taking advice from a previous review, I used a teaspoon of peppermint extract in the plain portion - these were so yummy.  I will make these again - next time I will make the delicious peanut butter and peppermint, and maybe play around with other flavors, as the coconut and chocolate weren't a huge hit.  Maybe the coconut ones needed extra coconut flavoring (extract?) and the chocolate ones were really dry.  Also, I had to keep these refrigerated so they wouldn't melt... next time I will use quality dipping chocolate instead of chocolate chips with vegetable oil so they won't melt in your hands (and I needed a LOT more dipping chocolate than this recipe calls for).  I also dipped the tips in different colored white chocolate so you could see which flavors were which.  Hint: 2.5 pounds of powdered sugar equals 9 and 1/2 cups.  Does anyone have any ideas about how to shape eggs???

AMAZING! I made this exactly as stated, except I added a teaspoon of mint extract to the cocoa batch. Everyone raved over them! They said I were professional! My first time making anything candy related turned out fabulous! Thanks for the great recipe!

So I made this and 3 other rescipes for Valentine's day to give out to ALL my friends :) all turned out good.  I used the Baker's Chocolate and a double boiler to melt it down.
One note however: 1 cup of coco is WAY too much.  I dumped the whole cup in and turned my dough to powder.  I gave up on the coconut flavor and tried a second time on coco ones, I added like an 8th or a 4th cup and it worked great.  Still very chocolatey.  Made them a second time already and they turned out great.  The peanut butter ones taste just peanut butter cups!  Yum!

This was a great recipe as this was my first time. I will skip the chocolate next time as they just crumbled into bits (unless someone has a suggestion that works). The peanut butter eggs were double the size of the others. Good for me (the inside is my favorite part). Will definately make again.

I made these for the kids at easter.  They were great except for the cocoa ones which were way too dry.  I ended up mixing them with the peanut butter ones to try and even it out but I still needed to add a little bit of oil to make it workable.  They were really good though - I'm thinking this will probably become an easter tradition in our house.

I made most of them in peanut butter and about a quarter of them with maraschino cherries added to the plain mixture. These were a very big hit! I took them to my mom's for our family Easter dinner, and I shared some with folks at work, too. Everyone liked them!

I made this for the second year in a row this past Easter, and I love the recipe.  This year I divided the dough into thirds and used peanut butter, coconut, and peppermint extract, and the results were wonderful.  I used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips to cover the peppermint and coconut eggs, and milk chips for the peanut butter.  It does take more chips than the recipe calls for, but I think the taste of real chocolate chips is better than the chocolate coating candy.  I can't wait for next Easter to make these again!

Wow! These were awesome. I made the peanut butter and  coconut flavours. Tried the third part with Nutella--was also very good. Hint-- Don't try with marshmallow cream--way too sticky to handle and I had to doctor it up with cocoa and rice crispies to make the dough managable--still turned out fine and did not go to waste--some folks liked them the best! I think you could half the recipe without worry if you wanted to.

This recipe is exactly what I wanted. I made peanut butter and coconut. I thought I'd like the peanut butter best, but the coconut are outstanding! I added about half a teaspoon of salt to balance the sweetness a bit and I left out about half a pound of the powdered sugar. The peanut butter would have been better with the right amount of sugar. I used a cookie scoop to help get them the right size then used the shape of a Reese's egg to inspire the shape. Having them flattened made dipping very easy. I gave one to each of my nieces and nephews for Easter and they loved them, too. Yum and yum! I will definitely make these again.

These are so easy to make and so tasty. Also sort of time consuming, so I split it into parts. I kneaded the dough and formed them into nuggets placed them in the fridge overnight, then dipped them the next day.

These were good, but very hard to dip in chocolate.  I used sweetened coconut because that's all I had.  And I used mint extract in one batch, but should've used peppermint extract, the taste was a little off.  Makes a lot of eggs!

These were fun and easy, until the dipping came along.  I'm just not practiced at dipping chocolates.  But the eggs are even great without the chocolate coating. Make the eggs small or they are too overwhelming for the consumer.  All flavors are excellent!! Use two forks when lifting out of the chocolate.  Will definately make again.

The chocolate version dry I had to add milk to get them in the egg shape.  Next time I will start with 1/2 cup cocoa powder and mix in until I get the constistency desired.   Instead of the plain portion I added 1 tsp of peppermint extract taste just like peppermint pattie.  I think I will halve the recipe next time.  It takes a while to make all of the eggs.  Also I used a lot of chocolate to cover all of the eggs about 6 cups but, I a novice to making candy. Overall I am really happy with this recipe and will be making them next year.

I brought these to a family gathering, and almost everyone loved them.  I made the peanut butter and coconut kind, and a mint one that I made up myself using Andes mint pieces and peppermint extract in the chocolate coating.  These are all great - but a little too sweet for some people at the party.  I would recommend making them smaller, so they are really only one small bite's worth.  Also - to make life easier - use Baker's dipping tubs (or similar brand) for the chocolate coating.  It was super easy, and tasty too!  Will make these again, but will play around with the filling to see about cutting down the sweetness just a tad!

I had a great time with this recipe and was really pleased with how easy it was. I thought it was going to be a very long process, but really it took about three hours from start to finish, including decorating. My husband helped. I am sure our eggs will look better with practice! The peanut butter dough was a little dry and I added a bit of water. I have seen recipes for buckeyes that call for a bit of milk, so that might work as well. I have many ideas for flavors to add for next year.  Just like with fudge or peanut butter balls at Christmas, I have these in the fridge and they will taste better when brought to room temperature. I made mine large, and would like to make very large ones with names on them as gifts.

I thought the coconut was best, one cup and one teasopoon coconut extract also presseded an almond or two into the egg shape depending on the size,  the maple ones were great also, just add almost a teaspoon of Maplene, the peanut butter ones were awesome added a cup of rice crislpies, used one teaspoon peppermint extract, wow just like junior mints only bigger, and better chocolate.  I can't believe this took me all day and I was going to double it!  Trying to form the eggs and make them small was very time consuming.  I sure hope I don't have to make these again before Easter, it's only a few weeks away.  They're delicious, oh my

I have made this year after year and have shared this recipe with others.  My favorite is slivered almonds and cherries, buy you can be creative with your filling.  A double broiler works perfect for melting the chocolate, which I use melting chocolate instead of chips.  Great treat and fun to do!

the ingredient measurements in this recipe were way off i ended up using 3 bags of choc. chips and it called for way to much cocca powder, it would be best not to measur the flavorings and just add them to taste. also you wouldnt want to eat the plain ones they were very sickining sweet!

i made these for easter baskets and they were a hit. i, like most others, was unable to do the chocolate coating, so i only dipped half in so the top part was covered in chocolate. this also made identification easier. 
to avoid the crumbles i only used 1kg of sugar, it made them stick pretty well. but i did feel that the peanut butter ones melted a bit too easily. otherwise, fantastic, will also try mint next time!

I thought this recipe was easy and yummy.  I divided the dough into fourths and made huge easter eggs and after dipping them in chocolate, decorated them with my kids names. I cut little slices off when they want some (they are easy to slice). Peanut butter was the best, but next time, I will try mint for the plain one.  I think it would taste like a Peppermint Patty.

These do look great when they are finished but the only add-in that I liked was the peanut butter.  They tasted a lot like buckeyes. I thought the coconut would be great but it had very little flavor.  I would make these again with the peanut butter only.  I think you need to make them very small, like 1-1 1/2 inches long because one serving can be a lot otherwise.  I too had trouble dipping them in chocolate, I was a mess!  Since mine were sort of large, I tried cutting one into pieces, and the middle gets crumbly.  You also need to know that these need to stay refrigerated.

These have a very good taste, but were a little more time consuming than I thought.  I did like the versatility of different items to mix and different tastes.  And humbly I think I need lessons on how to properly dip into melted chocolate, because I found that somewhat difficult.

These were really yummy, amount of cocoa was way too much though. To one quarter of the mix I added 2 Tbsp Dutch cocoa powder and that was enough. Overall they were pretty easy to make; I used a small cookie scoop to shape the mix, then stuck two pieces together and shaped into an egg. Dark chocolate merckens worked really well for the coating, although it is easier to dip if you use a lot of melted chocolate. (I mixed the leftover dipping chocolate with crunchy peanut butter, then spread onto waxed paper and cut into squares when chilled, yummy!)

Yummy and easy to make, though fairly time-consuming.  I mixed my dough with a mixer rather than by hand to incorporate ingredients more evenly.  I divided the dough into thirds, flavoring one with coconut, one with peanut butter, and one with maple extract.  All taste great!  The maple candies were hard to form since no bulk was added to the dough, so they didn't end up with true egg shapes like the others.  Adding walnuts to the mixture would help.  I'm already envisioning other flavor possibilities...I think lemon extract with fresh lemon zest, coated in dark chocolate would be heavenly!

These were a hit!  I used Nutella (about 1/2c) instead of cocoa powder and added a generous slosh of coconut extract to the shredded coconut.  Also used cookie cutters rather than making egg shapes, though that made the coating process much more challenging.  People described the PB flavored ones as "like Reeses, only better!"

I made these awhile ago, so I'm a bit rusty but wanted to rate it because I keep having people ask me to make them again!  I made peanut butter, mint and coconut flavored.  They were all a huge hit! It depended on the person as to which flavor they raved about.   The only pain in the butt is trying to dip these in chocolate as well as really time consuming. I ended up making balls and just dipping them they didn't look as appealing as the default picture ( I have no idea how someone did that, I couldn't for the life of me!) but were really really good.  Now I want to make some more!

These eggs were so much fun! I tried all different fillings. The peanut butter ones were a favorite; I also added peppermint flavoring to some; chopped pecans and carmel to some; and grated chocolate to some.  Everyone loved them.  I'll be doing this again next year.  (I did have to add powdered sugar as needed for some fillings, to make a workable dough)

These are good, but please note that I cut the sugar in HALF and the recipe made about 30 good sized eggs. I couldn't bear the idea of making them any sweeter, and the choice was a good one. I added 1 cup of PB to the dough and made all PB eggs. They are truly delicious, and cutting back on the sugar didn't harm them a bit. Be sure to use actual candy coating (almond bark?) because otherwise, they won't be easy to coat. Also, I placed my eggs in the freezer before coating (for two days because I didn't get to coating them for awhile!) and frozen eggs are MUCH easier to coat.

Living in West Africa you can't go out and buy Easter candy. So I made this for my family and friends and they love it. It had been along time since I made candy and I was worried I forgot how but this recipe helpped me.

I made these today for Easter and they turned out really well. I made peanut butter, chocolate, coconut, and the fourth batch was walnut cherry. We have a friend who used to make these for us years ago and my daughter asked me to find a similar recipe and I think this is it. Thanks alot!

This recipe is so easy and very good.  ne alternate I tried is finely chopped walnuts and cranraisins. This makes a great alternate from the other two. Thanks for the recipe. So many of my family and friends enjoyed this.

My daughter and I made these for a family gathering, and they were fantastic! Everyone loved them. We also made some with coffee extract. Although the peanut butter ones went the fastest. Will be using this recipe again.

Instead of cream cheese, we used Neufchatel cheese.  It never made a dough, so we made little balls with the coconut, and put them in the freezer to firm up.  (Next time we will follow the recipe and use Cream Cheese).  After dipping them in chocolate (we used SemiSweet baking chocolate) and putting back in the freezer, they were pretty good.  The ones that we added cocoa powder to did make a dough that we could shape into egg shapes.  One batch of cocoa powder eggs we added orange extract to and dipped in Semi Sweet Baking chocolate.   The other batch of cocoa powder eggs we dipped in white chocolate baking squares.

Not crazy about the coconut. The texture was off.  However, the peanut butter, cocoa, and butter cream were great!  I would suggest thickening the butter cream just a tad, as these eggs were a bit more "loose" in the dipping process.

These were terrific!! I made them into smaller balls, because of their sweetness. Instead of making them with chocolate & peanut butter, I made some of them with mint extract, some with cherries & almond extract, & some with maple extract. I took them to work & everyone went crazy over them. The possibilities are only limited by your imagination. Thank you for a fun, yummy, & easy recipe.

Although these tasted okay, they were powerfully sweet and did not work in the chocolate at all! Maybe my fault? But still nobody ate them but me, and I only ate them late in the afternoon when I was hungry and there was nothing else available!

This was really good. I wound up getting the chocolate a little too thick, be careful about loading it down with that. Very sweet. I used coconut which was very good.

These tasted great and are SO versatile! I made one batch of plain, one coconut, and two peanut butter. I used Reese's peanut butter, and they seemed to be the favorite! I used chocolate almond bark instead of the chips, worked great! I made these by myself which took quite a while, but I think if you have kids, it would make a great little Easter project!! Great recipe, thank you!

Plain and coconut fillings were perfect.  Chocolate and Peanut Butter fillings were too dry.  Will try to melt unsweetened chocolate instead of cocoa for the Chocolate filling and maybe an extra TBSP or 2 to the Peanut Butter filling.

The filling works well. I chopped pistachios and cherries together instead of using the cocoa powder as the third batch. Although it was a little wet it did form well.

Made this recipe with an after school culinary class I teach at my job. It was a great 45 minute Easter treat for these 12-15 year olds! The end product was very impressive for something so simple and fun to make. They reminded me of a good truffle and I was pleasantly surprised how great they came out. I found the recipe to be very forgiving, (12 yr olds tend to wing it with measurements when not closely watched, and YOU try watching 7 or 8 at once!) and a smart addition can easily correct consistency or textural problems with the "dough". I recommend adding a cherry, small strawberry, pretzel, almond, even bacon to the center of each, and mix them up when you platter them. (always be aware of any food allergies of your guests, of course) This gives them a fun "Easter egg" feel, as you never know what you'll get when you open one. The fruit or nuts are a nice respite to the sugar on sugar on sugar of the eggs also. All in all- a fun and simple recipe, one I will certainly make again. Thanks!

I just finished making these with four 13 year olds..Such fun. I did find that using melting discs worked much better then chocolate chips. We made coconut, Nutella, and peanut butter..All are very good. We used milk chocolate on the peanut butter and Nutella, and on the coconut we used dark chocolate. Next time I will buy more dipping forks, they worked great..

This recipe was so difficult and time consuming to make I wouldn't suggest that anyone but a professional try it. The chocolate does not go on smoothly no matter how soft and liquidy I made it. In the end there was too much chocolate on the eggs and it wasn't smooth. It took over an hour to prepare and in the end it wasn't edible. WAY too much sugar as well. I might as well have just put a spoonful of sugar in my mouth and mixed in some melted chocolate to get the same effect.

I loved the idea of this recipe but felt it needed to be altered a bit. The main change which I made is I used about half as much sugar as the recipe calls for. This did make the dough mixture a little harder to form, but the finished chocolates had creamy, nicely sweet centers. I'll also note that less sugar ensures the peanut butter centers stay moist (some reviwers indicated problems with dry peanut butter centers . For the centers I made four flavors: 1.orange - using orange oil, 2.peppermint - using pepperment oil, 3.Nutella, and 4.Peanut Butter. The two favorites in my family were the peppermint and peanut butters centers, but orange and nutella were also good. Overall, Thank you and I will definitely make these again!!!

I always wanted to make Easter eggs, I came across this recipe. I cut it in half and  used butter instead of margarine..WOW...I just tried one of the coconut eggs, it makes about 16 eggs of coconut and 16 peanut butter. The peanut butter ones are in the freezer as we speak..THANKS for the great recipe. Can't wait for my family to taste them...Happy Easter....AAAAAAAAA+++++++++

excellent fillings!!! the only thing I did different was add nuts to chocolate one. I did have some trouble with he dipping. I needed almost double the chip amount listed and it was quite hard to dip them. Next time I think I will look into molds and dipping chocolate that I have read people used, it would make them perfect.With the price that is charged for chocolate eggs you could make triple of these and they are awesome!
