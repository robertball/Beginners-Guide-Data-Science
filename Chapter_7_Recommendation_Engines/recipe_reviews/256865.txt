As BBQ sauce, it was fine. But it was NOTHING like honey garlic sauce.  The tomatoes completely changed it.

I used 3/4C honey, and 1/2C ketchup so that the ketchup wasn’t overpowering. Tasted delicious on chicken thighs! I sliced bell pepper to put over the chicken and sauce while it cooked, and the flavours meshed well together!

I like my honey garlic sauce on the sweeter side. This recipe has mostly ketchup and it seems to take over the flavour. I had to add some extra honey and even a bit of brown sugar to help sweeten it. I would recommend using only 1/3-1/2 cup of ketchup to keep the tangy flavour down.

4.7.19  Needed a quick dipping sauce for some fried chicken strips, and thought this had potential.  Honestly, it pretty much just tastes like sweet ketchup to me.  I could taste the garlic which I sautéed for only about 1 to 1-1/2 minutes (if you cook too long, it gets bitter), but the soy sauce which I was hoping might add a bit of an Asian flair was unrecognizable.  I added more soy sauce, and it was O.K., but I doubt I’ll make this again.  I see this has had good reviews, so my rating simply might be a reflection of personal taste.

Total game changer! Added lemon juice and ginger to suit my taste. My lady told me that it was the best asian sauce that she's EVER had!

I also added a little dash of fresh lemon juice and skipped the soy sauce.  Absolutely delish!

Cooked salmon in this sauce. It gave the salmon an Asian flare! Tasted outstanding!
