This is tasty recipe, but broiling this salmon doesn't do it any justice.  The marinade is just too good.  If you really want to get the most taste out of the salmon, try pan frying it after marinating with a little olive oil, searing both sides and locking in the juices, then save the left over marinade, add 1 tbsp corn starch, and heat until thick.  It will make a great sauce that you can just lightly spread on top of the salmon.  I tried this with my second attempt and my wife and I liked it much better.

This was GOOD!!!  I changed a few things to suit our tastes - used 1/2 the amount of soy and brown sugar, used the juice of one lemon and ground black pepper instead of lemon pepper, and 3 cloves of crushed garlic instead of garlic powder.  After marinating the salmon overnight in a baking dish, I put the whole dish with all the marinade in the oven and baked for 20 minutes.  I took the skin off at the end.  Delicious!

I made this salmon for a special New Year's Eve dinner.  It was fabulous!! I agree with a previous poster, it is a $20 entree in a medium size city but I would add, a $30 entree in a big city.  Since I have a 7 yr old and an 8 yr old and a 1 yr old eating this too, I was apprehensive about the amount of lemon pepper.  I had doubled the recipe for the marinade because I was using 2 lbs of salmon, but I only used 2 tsp of lemon pepper instead of 4.  It was not too peppery at all.  Next, I must admit I was skeptical about thickening the marinade and cooking it and pouring it over the top like some reviewers recommended.  I had always heard you should promptly discard your marinade.  But I figured I was cooking the marinade so any bacteria would be killed so why not give it a try.  Well, I am glad I did....it was awesome.  So elegant, it would be such a waste to forgo a step that would only take 5 extra minutes.
Everyone loved it and couldn't stop saying thanks Mom, its great! My 8 yr old requested this every New Year's Eve...I think we will have it again way before that : )

Follow the recipe as is....just bake instead of boil - 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon. I have made this 3 times and my family loves it!!!

This recipe was awesome!  I would definitely suggest doubling the marinade though.  I made just two servings with the enough marinade for four.  I marinaded overnight and took earlier suggestions to make the remaining into a sauce for the fish.  It was perfect.  I added a little over a tablespoon of cornstarch and made sure to boil the mix for a few minutes (stirring constantly) just in case any bacteria still existed.  This was my first time broiling and it couldn't have turned out better.  The timing is incredibly accurate.  I served it with Scoopnana's Sesame Noodles and Josie's Asian Avocado.  The extra sauce was also good over the noodles.  The meal was altogether fantastic.

absolutely delicious! These were my modifications: no lemon pepper or garlic powder so used lemon zest and minced fresh garlic; only had regular soy sauce so reduced it to 1/4 cup and upped the OJ to almost 1/2 cup. 

The fish turned out very well flavoured.

This was fabulous- we used real garlic and made a sauce from the marinade with cornstarch.  Cook the marinade down a bit and then add a little cornstarch- this is wonderful poured on top of the salmon.  We had jasmine rice and steamed asparagus on the side and everyone ate tons of it- be sure to have plenty of salmon on hand!  We doubled this recipe to accommodate 2.5 lbs of salmon.  This recipe will not disappoint!

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I used the ingredients as stated, but only had time to marinate for 1 hour.  I did baste with the sauce as i broiled the salmon, and the flavour was wonderful.  I sprinkled some sesame seeds on before serving, to made it look more appealing.
There were no leftovers!!

This was ok. I would not be in a rush to make this again & I am always on the look out for good salmon recipes. I thought that it was good but not great. I perfer the Firecracker Salmon Recipe from this site which is similar to this but more flavorful.

This is delicious. The salmon came out so moist and flavorful. Instead of broiling it, I baked the salmon, with the marinade poured over top, at 400 for about 15 minutes. I served the salmon and sauce over thin rice noodles and veggies with sliced green onions on top. The only change I made to the marinade was to use fresh minced garlic. I also didn't bother to rub the sugar and seasons onto the salmon, I just threw it all in the marinade.

Agree with Frank P. No need to broil this. The marinade is delish but try this faster way. Marinate for just 15 mins or so. Pan fry the salmon, skin side down for 3-5 minutes in olive oil. Then the other side for 2 minutes while removing the skin. Once done, pop the marinade in there and sizzle for few seconds. Add some corn starch and make a fabulous sauce. Drizzle over the fish and voila!

The salmon was delicious! I marinated this for almost 24 hours because of timing, and the orange soy flavor went throughout. The ginger wasn't strong (I used frozen that I cut previously), so I will triple it next time. Here are my modifications: I used 3 tablespoons of frozen OJ concentrate in place of the OJ and fresh garlic instead of powder, regular pepper and a squirt of lemon juice in place of lemon pepper. We had it over pasta and spooned (boiled down and thickened with cornstarch) the marinate overtop.

EXCELLENT!!!  We love salmon and enjoy trying it done many different ways.  I changed this slightly - using fresh minced garlic and lemon zest and fresh ground pepper in place of the lemon pepper (find it artificial tasting).  I only had about 1 1/2 hours to marinate this and decided to bake my salmon in the oven instead of broiling it.  I left some of the marinade while it baked and removed at least half to a saucepan to thicken.  Just boiled it with some water/cornstarch.  This had a ton of flavour...the orange juice gave it a wonderful taste, but not too overpowering.  SUPER yummy!

This is one of the most wonderful salmon recipes I've ever tried. My mum discovered this for my birthday and made it and it was perfect. I've since made it for my family and for Dinner parties and everyone has loved it. 
Thank you.

Everyone ate it, and that doesn't often happen in my house, so I will definitely make it again.  I followed directions exactly, except I only marinated it for 5 hours instead of overnight.  Still flavorful.

This was excellent!  Even my toddlers liked it!  I didn't find the recipe until right as I was ready to cook, so I didn't let it sit in the marinade and it was still great!  I just poured the whoe batch of marinade in and kept turning it while it was in the broiler.

I don't use garlic powder, so I minced a garlic clove instead.  Also, I was lazy, so I just mixed all the marinade ingredients together in a measuring cup, stirred until the suagr melted, and poured in a zip bag with the salmon.  We didn't broil the fillets, we just pan fried them.  I thought this was very flavourful, but the salmon itself wasn't a big hit with my family, so I think I'd try it on another type of fish next time.

VERY GOOD!  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and baked the salmon at 350 for about 25 minutes.  After marinating, I added some corn starch to the marinade and poured over the salmon while baking.  Delicious!!

This is one of my favorite ways to prepare salmon. I have never tried fresh ginger... I just use powdered ginger. If you are watching your sugar intake, this dish is great with or without it. I grill this on the BBQ... for a special treat, try grilling over hickory planks.

Sounds Wonderful!  I would love to ask: Jackie where is the best place to buy Salmon in Murfreesboro area?  I want to make this for my son's 18th birthday!
Thanks,
Amy in Smyrna

We LOVED this.  I used real lemon juice with cracked pepper instead of lemon pepper. Other than that I followed the recipe.  Fantastic.

I marinated over night. Excellent Salmon. I used it on a whole samon.  Wonderful flavor and texture. Delicious carmelization from the brown surgar. I broiled it and then boiled down the marinade for a sauce afterwards.  Big thumbs up!

I just made this and it was superb! My husband and I were starving just from the aroma of the marinade! I only had time to marinate it for an hour and it was still delicious. I also didn't have lemon pepper, so I used regular pepper. I didn't have garlic power, so I used my one remaining clove of fresh garlic.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and then broiled it for 5 minutes. I baked it in all of the marinade for the first 20 minutes and then removed most of the marinade to make a reduction. I served it on top of basmati rice and drizzled the reduction on top. Absolutely delicious! I want to try this on boneless/skinless chicken next!

This was really good.  I don't usually like fish, but it wasn't fishy at all. Bought the fillets fresh. Only had to marinate for 2 hrs.  I don't think it needed more. Very yummy.

You just know it's a good recipe when you make it 'wrong' and it still tastes amazing. I was out of orange juice and only had powedered ginger, so I mixed what I had in a bowl. I ended up with a paste and that's probably why I forgot to cook it in a pan into a sauce. Whoops! PLUS I was running short on time, so I smeared the paste on the fillets, let it sit for an hour and a half, then cooked it on the stove, about 8 minutes each side. OMG it was SO good!!! Next time I will be sure to add the juice and marinate it overnight, but either way this recipe is a keeper. Thanks! P.S. We had it with the roast sweet potatoes + onions from this site, and it was great!

This went really well...the whole family loved it.(even my 1 yr old) Left it overnight in the marinade..i used half a lemon and white pepper( i didn't have any lemon pepper).cooked down the marinade a little bit and added some corn starch...yum, it was so tasty:) The only thing i might do next time is use real garlic and add a bit more ginger:) On the side i made some Tahini(sesame paste,lots of galric,lemon juice, some water,cumin and some diced onions).Will do it again.thank you for sharing:)

This was a pretty standard salmon recipe.  I didn't have any oranges, so I used fresh-squeezed clementine juice.  Also, I had never heard of lemon-pepper, so I used some lemon juice & rind and fresh-ground pepper (FYI: you can find sites online to make your own lemon pepper without any of the preservatives and additives they add to commercial varieties, but I didn't have the time for that).  I always use minced ginger from a jar, which is easier and keeps longer.  I liked the end result, but prefer just fresh-squeezed lemon juice and some oil.

I followed the recipe precisely - marinated it overnight - it was hands down, 100% the best salmon I've ever cooked! Also I used my oven timer to follow the timing instructions exactly. Absolutely delicious and already recommending this recipe!

OMG!!  This was one of the best salmon dishes I've ever tasted, even in restaurants.  I did bake it at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes because my salmon didn't have skin on.  I also added cornstarch to the leftover marinade and topped the salmon w/ it after removing from the oven.  Just make sure you use FRESH salmon and not previously frozen.  Amazing w/ jasmine rice and roasted asparagus and a little wine!    Thanks!

One of the best and easiest salmon recipes I have ever tried. The only change I make is I only use 1 Tbsp. of orange juice instead of a 1/3 cup but that is just a person preference. My husband didn't even like salmon and he tried some of mine one night, now he requests this recipe at least once a week! FANTASTIC.

While my husband eats anything I make and loved this recipe I also was very impressed.  I normally can't eat salmon because it is too fishy for me and we have wasted a lot of money buying salmon and cooking it differently in an effort to find a way for me to eat salmon for its wonderful health benefits.  This recipe was great and I gobbled it up.  I substituted maple syrup for the brown sugar for extra nutritional value.  Thank you.  This one will even go into our family cookbook.

WONDERFUL!  By far our favorite way to cook salmon! (my BF usually doesn't like salmon, but LOVES this)  I rub the salmon really well with more than recommended, but usually don't bother marinating it as long.  I also put some of the marinade aside after I make it, in order to pour some over the top after it is cooked. Wonderful with Jasmine rice and spring rolls!

Wow! This was great. I grilled instead of broiled, but I can see it being prepared any way, including baked with the marinade. Boiling the marinade to make the sauce is a MUST. Next time I will try it with the Mrs Dash lemon pepper which is salt-free, as another reviewer suggested.

Made this a few nights ago, had left it marinating for a little more than 24 hours.  I think it's good to note that you should cool the marinade a bit before putting the fish in the bag with it.  Had a great flavor, we cooked it on the grill rather than in the oven, and it was delicious.  Guests seemed to enjoy it, not much left over.  Even took some of the marinade to flavor some couscous that we served with dinner, very nice! I think the low sodium soy is a must though, we prepared ours with regular and it was borderline salty.  (our bad)  Tried to balance that with more orange juice and I think it helped.  Fresh ginger is so wonderful, we were happy to find a way to use it!  Thanks!

I have some tips for you:  If your fish has been previously frozen and thawed, make sure you pat it dry before immersing in the marinade.  This allows  the marinade to penetrate more easily. This applies to any fish that you may use, even if not previously thawed.  Also make sure your marinade has cooled completely before adding fish.  But I am sure you knew that!  That plastic bag can ooze flavor into the food and it marinade is still warm, it can begin to cook your fish, meat, chicken, etc.  I normally use a glass container with a foil cover.  Hope this helped someone.

This was an awesome recipe! I followed other's suggestions, I pan fried the fish with some olive oil, lemon juice and garlic salt on it in addition to a bit of the sauce. Then I put the sauce up to simmer with some cornstarch to thicken it and poured it over the fish. Yum!

My family loves this recipe.  I serve the salmon with "dill rice", toasted pine nuts and a side of hot corn.  I try to use wild salmon whenever I can since the flavor is so different, but it is still very good with farm raised slamon.  This is for real my favorite dinner.

My salmon-hating husband loved this recipe.  I baked salmon at 350 instead of broiling, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

This was so good!  I served it with Cheesie Garlic biscuts.  The compliments started as soon as the family came in the house.  The smells were delicious and the salmon did not disappoint.  I have to admit I did not quite follow the recipe.  I forgot to marinade this morning.  So I made the marinade and poured it on the salmon in the pan, let it sit while I mixed the biscuits and heated the oven and then cooked it all at the same time.   Fantastic!

This is our go-to salmon recipe, and I always know the kids (ages 4 and 1) will clean their plates if I prepare the salmon this way.  It turns out great even if you only marinate it for a few hours.  We always heat the marinade while the fish rests after cooking, and use it as a sauce on the fish and rice or mashed potatoes.  This is also excellent grilled on an alder plank.

This was great!  I didn't have time to marinate the fish so I added it all together and then baked it for 20 minutes.  It was even better the next day for leftovers!

This salmon is oh, so delicious! The whole family loved it. It has just the right blend of flavors to enhance the salmon. I didn't have lemon pepper on hand, though, so just used some regular black pepper. It was excellent, so would probably be even better using the lemon pepper. Thank you for the recipe!

I wasn't in a fish mood tonight but BF really liked this. I used two large skinless fillets and cut the brown sugar to only 1 tsp in the sauce mixture (no rub). And looking at the recipe I now realize I forgot the OJ!! Nuts. Let it sit in my instant marinator and broiled for about 8 minutes total. Received a very loud "Mmmmmm!" upon first taste.

This was truly a fantastic recipe. The only two things that I did differently was add an extra minute cooking time per side and add 1/2 of the reserved marinade to the foil lined dish to ensure that the salmon was moist and succulent. I will definitely be trying this 5 star recipe again!

Reduce marinade for sauce on soba noodles. Baste fish several times during cooking for more flavor.

I wish that I could give this recipe more then 5 stars. My husband and I don't eat very much salmon but this was by far the best salmon that we had both ever eaten. I made it in the morning and let it marinade all day before cooking it. It was tender, delicious, and I rich. Thank you so much Onassis75!!! Everyone should try!

I made this for my vegetarian friends on Christmas eve but everyone ate a bit of it.  It was delicious  and the marinade was heavenly (I will be trying it on chicken!) and it was given rave reviews. However.... when I make this again I will be buying thick salmon steaks in lieu of salmon fillets.  I think the thicker cuts will allow better control with the of how done the fish is.   Also, I did not broil my fish in the oven but, "grilled" it in my Aroma Super Pot (the best small appliance I own!) in 2 tablespoons olive oil.

Very good. The salmon was very flavorful, and the marinade was excellent. I did not have any lemon pepper or juice, and it was great without it. I spooned the pan drippings over the salmon when served. Great touch.

Amazing. I marinated the salmon for about 6 hours, and like some people said, it doesn't need additional sauce because the fish absorbs all the flavors. I "baked" at 350 for 25 minutes and it was to DIE for. Thanks so much for this recipe (I had some leftover marinade which I froze for another day, mmm)

Best Salmon recipe EVER!!! I just boil then thicken up the left over marinade and drizzle over fish and that makes all the difference, without sauce it would just be okay.And since im always in a hurry i never marinate for more than 15 minutes, and i never have fresh ginger so i just used  a half tsp of crushed ginger in the jar .You will not be disappointed. Oh yeah and the trick with removing the skin was so easy. Thanks so much for this recipe it's a hit every time!!!

This was a great recipe! I've cooked it many times. Instead of broiling the salmon I put just a little olive oil in a pan and at medium heat I fry the salmon. Then I remove the salmon and put the sauce in the pan at a medium to low heat. I then use 1 1/2  teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce to good constancy.

Used a little less than 1/4 brown sugar, added 1 tsp of corn starch to thicken the sauce, marinaded it overnight and baked it at 350 degrees for 25 minutes while spooning the marinade over it 3-4 times during baking.  Strong flavor so served with rice and steamed veggies.  Excellent!

Breathtakingly delicious!! I used dried ginger instead of fresh and pre-minced garlic rather than garlic powder.  Boiling the marinade for use as sauce is a key to this recipe's tastiness.  I'm all out of salmon, but the sauce was so good that I'll be making it with pork chops tomorrow night!  100 stars! :)

Make sure to use the low sodium soy sauce or you will get a pretty salty fish. I didn't have orange juice on hand so I juiced a blood orange and it was so good! I did this meal is 7 minutes and it wowed the snootiest of crowds- my hipster friend! Here's what I did. Items needed- Fresh green beans Bag of hand made linguine- lemon and chive was what I used bottle of wine corn starch  Sauté those beans, cook your noodles, and thicken your marinade by simmering it in a sauce pan with the corn starch. Take your fish out and serve with beans and noodles on the side. Drizzle some thickened sauce on top and you have a fancy feast! A note- I have a gas stove so this would probably take longer with electric.

To die for! Definitely restaurant quality! I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I used a few pinches of ground ginger. Marinaded about 6 hours. I thickened up the left over marinade with flour, poured over salmon and topped with some fresh diced tomatoes. Absolutely delish!

I'm knocking off one star because I don't think the sauce needed as much (or any) olive oil as the recipe called for, as salmon is already naturally rich in oils. Maybe a tsp of olive oil would've been enough if you want the aroma/flavor of olive oil in your sauce. Having said that, both the bf and I thought this was a good dish - very rich flavor with just enough hints of lemon. The sauce is excellent over rice. (I took the advice of some previous reviwers and boiled/thickened the leftover marinade with some corn starch). I did double the amount of sauce as I am a huge sauce person, and I also increased the amount of brown sugar to make it a little sweeter - that's the nice thing about the sauce - you can tinker with it while mixing until it is exactly to your liking - plus I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes, just for kicks. I only had enough time to marinade the fish for a little over an hour, but I think it was enough, as fish already contains some natural salt, and rubbing the meat with brown sugar/garlic powder/lemon pepper prior to marinading really helps seal in those flavors. Thanks for a great recipe! Will definitely make again.

This was great!!!! Made the recipe exactly with the expection of cooking them on the grill instead of broiling.  Everyone loved the salmon.  We also took the left over marinade and made a sauce by adding a little corn starch, it thickened right up.  No leftovers tonight!!!!!   Next time I make them I will add a little bit of red pepper flakes to put a little heat into it.

Yummy!!! I used lime juice instead of oj and fresh minced garlic. Very tasty. I also cooked it for 13 mins at 400.  I served this with cilantro lime cauliflower rice. Great combo.

This is now a favorite in my house :)  I kept the ingredients the same and followed suggestions by a few others.  

After marinating, I transfered the marinade to a small saucepan and added corstarch/water to thicken, heated, and used as a sauce.  I pan fried the salmon, but I may try baking it (my usual method).

The sauce can be a little strong, so I'd recommend using it sparingly at first until you get a feel for it.  

I do plan to add toasted sesame seeds on the next go round, I think they would be a wonderful addition.

We really enjoy this recipe and it is so easy to make.  I followed some of the other suggestions:  use the juice of one whole lemon and sprinkle some pepper (in place of lemon pepper), two whole cloves of garlic minced, and I cooked the salmon in the oven in the dressing.  That way we could use the sauce over the rice.

absolutely delicious!

I didn't marinate for more than 2 hours, and threw the recipe together without measuring anything... And it was still good! Not the best salmon I've ever had, but maybe if I followed the recipe it would have been. Worth making again.

Nice flavor in this one if you marinate for longer than 3 hours.  My only change was to marinate for 6 hours before grilling.  Not our favorite recipe but decent with stir fry veggies.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the mood for sweet salmon.

My go-to salmon recipe involves a maple glaze that is on the expensive side because it uses so much pure maple syrup. This is an inexpensive alternative that's just as yummy.

This is my first review I have made. I saw this as the recipe of the day a week or two ago and knew it was exactly what I wanted! My boyfriend claimed he didn't like Salmon, but he can't wait for us to make this again! The only thing different I did was cook it for a whatever another member said instead of broiled.

This was the best salmon marinade I have ever done!  My 11 year old who hates salmon couldn't get enough.  I didn't have enough soy sauce on hand so I substituted some teriaki sauce and it came out great!

My husband really liked this salmon. He said you could taste the marinade all the way through, and I only marinated 3 hrs. His coworker also tasted some and was asking for the recipe. I did cook it in a grill pan instead of a broiler, which might make some difference, but all the same they liked the marinade.

Doubled the recipe to get more sauce and thickened marinade with cornstarch.  Also added green onions as another person did.  It was wonderful.  We cleaned our plates!  Broiling gives it a tender, softer texture.

This was awful--I broiled part of like the recipe said to and did not like it. I panfried the other part of it and it tasted just as bad.  This has made me not want to eat salmon ever again!

The flavor was good. The trick for removing the skin was genius (was I the only one who didn't know how to do that?). But the extra marinade burned under the broiler and burned the foil to the pan- resulting in smoke and tough cleanup. If I make again, would need to go lighter on the basting to keep from having a pool of marinade on the pan.

Wonderful recipe!  My husband didn't even want the sauce over it.  The salmon had so much flavor from marinating overnight, it was delightful.  I served it over brown rice.  I had the sauce and it was delicious.    A keeper for sure!

Loved this recipe!!  Made it exactly as indicated except I substituted fresh ginger for ground ginger.  I would strongly recommend cutting down on the lemon-pepper as other reviewers stated.  I forgot to do so and it was salty but still umm...umm...good! Alot of reviewers indicated that they grilled or pan-fried theirs. I decided to broil mine and it came out slightly dry but only because I forgot about it!! Thickening the sauce is a must-have as everyone has indicated.  I did mine with flour.  I made sauteed string beans on the side and drizzled some of the sauce on it. Very good!

I used wheat-free tamari instead of soy sauce and it was way too salty. Next time I'd cut the soy in half and add some water. I cooked the salmon in the pan with the sauce and served it over a bed of rice and greens. Salty, but delicious!

We loved this salmon. I only marinated for 2 hours and my husband grilled it instead of broiling, just a preference. Next time I want to marinate overnight for more flavor. Thanks for this great recipe!

We all loved this recipe.  Great for fish lovers and non-fish lovers alike.  I used minced garlic instead of powder.  We also grilled instead of broiled.  I doubled the marinade and boiled it for a sauce.

This was really good, but as others have said, making a sauce out of the marinade is a MUST.  Without that, the fish would not have been very flavorful, and I even added extra ginger and green onions and marinaded it overnight.  The flavor was just so-so, but the sauce made it out of this world.  You WILL want to spoon it onto whatever else is on your plate; I had green beans and brown rice.  I really love sweet foods, but next time I will decrease the brown sugar just a bit because it was a little to sweet even for me.  But there will definitely be a next time!  Thanks a ton!

I wasnt going to rate it at first since i always kinda wing it from the ingredients, but when i read your profile where you say you do the same i had to comment. I was making it on the fly so kind of adjusted it to more of a sauce to cook it in. was still really good. my wife took the leftovers for lunch the next day and said it was even better then - heres was effectively marinated overnight. anxious to try again after actually marinating it. thanks for the great recipe.

This is really good.  I didn't even marinate overnight, but just for 30 minutes.  I kept some of the sauce separate and used it on a salad that we ate with the salmon.  Yummy!

The marinade was excellent!!!  I tried baking the salmon, covered with the marinade, and it came out great too.  But I think I like it better broiled!  Definately a crowd favorite!

Incredible!  This is one of the most delicious salmon dishes I have ever had.  I was only able to marinate the fillets for 1 hour but they turned out so well that I can't imagine how another 2 hours in the marinade would have made that much of a difference.  As other reviewers recommended, I turned the marinade into a sauce by simmering it on the stove and adding some cornstarch to thicken it. It was fantastic.  Overall, this is one of  the best recipes I have ever gotten from Allrecipes!

10 stars!  This is absolutely the best salmon recipe ever!  I've been making this for months and months now, and wont even consider making salmon any other way!  Don't let the ginger scare you, as it did initially for DH, you can't even taste it.  I also usually marinate it for only an hour or so, as that's how my time allows, and still, it turns out fantastic!!

Boy howdy that's tasty.  I used real garlic in the marinade...did so for 48 hours as it turned out, forgot to rub the salmon with anything and guess what?  It turned out immensely flavorful.  I DID cornstarch the marinade while boiling and used that as a dip for some cheese quesadillas I made (my marinade du jour). I served it with Chicken & Garlic rice a roni I added onion, broccoli, and chopped portabella and shittake mushrooms to. There is nothing fishy about this recipe, that's for sure.

I made this tonight for 8 and everyone enjoyed it.  My 7 yr old asked for 2nds and he never asks for 2nds.  Never.  I only had time to marinate for 1 hr. but it was still terrific.  I will make this again.  I boiled the remainder of the marinade and drizzled on the serving platter with the fish.  Served with a salad and garlic & oil orzo.

Very Good Recipe.  I didn't have enough time to marinate, and it still came out pretty good.

My husband and I have tried salmon many times and have never liked it.  A friend of ours just returned from an Alaskan fishing trip with some wild caught salmon for us.  Determined that there must be something to this salmon craze I went to allrecipes.com to find one that everyone was raving about.

Believe everything you hear! This recipe was fantastic. I followed it to the letter, marinating for 24 hours.  The sweetness cuts away that overly rich fishy taste that has always turned me off salmon.  My husband and I ate every bite and will be asking our neighbor for more!

WOW what a great recipe!  I don't particularly care for salmon but I know it's exceptionally healthy so I'm always trying different recipes when I'm cooking it for my husband.  I haven't been able to find one that I liked until now.  This recipe was superb!  I absolutely loved the taste and my husband did too. He was so shocked to see me gobble it down. I was only able to marinate it for a few hours but it still came out excellent.  I will definitely be making this again and again!  Thanks so much!

Awesome! I made this for myself and for a VERY picky eater. He loved it and so did I. I only got to marinate the salmon for an hour and it still turned out great.

This recipe is sooo good. I didn’t have time to marinate at all. I seasoned the fish with brown sugar, Lemon pepper and garlic. I used about a Tbs of sauce per fillet and baked them at 350 for 20 min. While I thickened the remain sauce with arrowroot powder. I served the fish with white rice and green beans and topped the fish with the thicken sauce! A restaurant quality dish

I made this recipe for the first time and loved it. The next time I will marinate as directed, but pan-sear the salmon on my cast iron skillet for about 45 seconds each side and then put in the oven to broil. I expect that pan-searing first will seal in the delicious marinade and juices ... so delicious you that you don't want to lose one bit.

I used this recipe on Alaskan Salmon.  I much prefer Atlantic Salmon which I didn't know how different they were until I had bought the Alaska salmon, which is much drier and more dense than the Atlantic.  Thus the reason I was looking for a recipe to marinate and hopefully help the texture of the Alaskan.  Well this recipe did it...it tasted great!  I only marinated it for 2 hours because that was all the time I had but what a difference.  Great recipe.

My favorite salmon recipe ever. I've made it at least a dozen times. Recently, I've taken a shortcut and not heated the marinade (just mixed the ingredients in a big plastic baggie before adding the salmon), and it's still delicious. The cooking method is crucial so as to benefit from the extra flavor (and healthy fatty acids) from cooking with the skin on, and also not dry the fish out. Excellent!!

I had a favorite salmon recipe but decided to try this one for a change.  I have now added this to my favorite recipes file. We grilled it on our Holland grill (convection grill), 10 minutes per side for a 2 lb. salmon, and it was outstanding. I reserved 1/3 c. of the marinade and added a pinch of cornstarch as a previous viewer suggested, heating just to boiling to drizzle over the grilled salmon. It was great with or without the additional sauce.

Oops I mentioned about rice vinegar...it's not included in the recipe but I still added the vinegar so it's a little bit tangy.

Double the marinade and simmer the extra with cornstarch to create a sauce for the fish and any accompanying noodles or veggies.

We like this recipe a lot. When in a hurry, I just put all the marinade ingredients minus the orange juice in a bowl and microwave for 1 minute. Add orange juice and pour over the salmon in a casserole dish. Marinate for couple of hours. Then bake, at 400 degrees, for 15 to 20 minutes.

This was amazing. Instead of broiling, we cooked the salmon at 350 for about 15-20 minutes. Once the salmon was done cooking, I removed the fish from the pan, poured the juice in a saucepan, and added about 1.5 tbsp of corn starch to make a sauce which we drizzled over the fish and the rice. It was fantastic.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit! It is so simple and easy that this will become a regular dinner dish. I didn't have brown sugar at the time and used white sugar for the rub and honey in the marinade and it was perfect. Broiled it just as the directions state, it was perfectly cooked and cleanup was as easy as throwing away the foil.

I'm scared to death to use the broiler, but I did it and it worked perfectly!  I only marinated it for an hour.  It was still very flavorful.  I did 4 minutes on one side, then 5 minutes on the other side.  It got a little blackened-very good!

This was absolutely wonderful.  After marinating the salmon, I put the salmon in a baking dish, poured the marinade over the top and baked it at 375 for 25 min. The sauce was delicious served over Jasmine rice.  Will definitely make this again.

Made this for dinner last night along with "Creamed Corn Like No Other", sautéed greens and parmesan mashed potatoes. It was a big hit! I used wild Alaskan salmon fillets and baked it on 350 for about 25 minutes.  I also basted with the sauce the marinade made as I poured it over the fish prior to baking. I also added red and yellow peppers, onions, a bit of thyme and a squeeze of lemon before baking. The result was amazing. Used the leftovers, sauce and all, poured over homemade Cesar salad- Yum!

Very good.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I just sprinkled some pepper on the salmon.  Also, I grilled it on a cedar plank after marinating for just 2 hours. Very flavorful!

Yum! Guesstimated the ingredients; probably used a little less lemon pepper and brown sugar; used garlic powder in the rub and fresh garlic in the marinade. Loved it. Thanks for posting!

Ahhh-mazing!  We eat a lot of salmon, but this is just the best asian-inspired marinade I've ever made.  Will make again and again and again!

I added 5-6 cloves of real garlic to the soy sauce marinade in addition to sprinkling garlic powder directly on the fish.  Also added fresh sliced green onion to the marinade.  Doubled the recipe for 2.4 lbs. of salmon, and it was the perfect amount of marinade.  REALLY good!  Marinated for 3 hours, and that was plenty.  Might be too salty if marinated overnight, in my opinion.

Not my cup of tea. I'm not a fan of Ginger, so that definitely must be taken into consideration. Just not for me.

Amazing. Did it to the letter, but doubled the amounts because I had two filets. A friend who is "particular about her salmon" asked me for the recipe. Thanks!!

Came out perfect, I added about 1/2 tblsp red pepper flakes in the marinade. Followed other suggestions and made the marinade into the sauce where I added about 1/2 tsp of Cayenne pepper. I like things a little spicy.

Perfect dish! Doubled my recipe to accomodate 4 people. Served this with Asian Avacado and Peanut rice. In laws loved it all. Making a sauce from the marinade is a must!

This marinade is awesome! My kids won't eat salmon, so I used it on chicken instead (only change to marinade was using fresh minced garlic), and just dumped the chicken and the marinade into a deep frying pan and boiled it all with 8 oz fresh mushrooms as a side and the family devoured it. Will definitely try it with salmon on a kid-free night.

This is excellent!  My husband and 3-year-old love it, as do I.  I often only let it marinate for about an hour or so, and it's flavor is just right.  Tastes like salmon I would order in a nice restaurant.

I don't like salmon normally, but this dish was fantastic!  I'll definitely make it again.  I made a couple of the reviewers changes including using the juice of one lemon and pan frying instead of broiling (I think Lemon Pepper smells like cleaning fluids). Then, I turned some marinade into a sauce using corn starch.  But, although that was amazingly good, I wasn't too happy with the deglazing since some fish skin was in the pan.  

Next time, I think I'll try broiling it, and then turn the marinade into sauce with a little corn starch as an entirely separate project.

Still, it was the best salmon dish I ever made, and probably the best salmon dish I've ever had (I really didn't like salmon at all before today!!)

A new family favorite. My five year old orginally didn't like the smell of the dish but once she tasted it she loved it. I served it a top a bed of wild rice with green beans surrounding it and it looked great. It even reheated well the neat day and tasted just as good. I only marinated the fish for 2 hours and will do it the same way next time.

I tried this recipe with tilapia, and it was good, but not great.  Since tilapia is a bit meatier than salmon, it held up the soy ginger flavors better.  But I prefer a more complex and flavorful marinade.

I didn't care for this dish.  The sweetness of it threw me off.  I've never tried brown sugar on fish before and I will not try it again.  Other than that, I think this would have been great.

A GREAT marinade!!!  Light but very favorful....does not overwhelm the salmon.  Got rave reviews when I served it (bravely for the first time ever) at a family reunion!  The other reviews sold me on it.....so let mine sell you. Its fabulous.  I didn't try to create a sauce.  I used minced garlic, reduced sodium soy sauce and just put the lemon pepper in with the juice, etc.

Wow!  My husband's first words after his first bite were, "You sure have Bennigan's beat!!!"  He orders a very similar salmon steak at Bennigans and loved this much better!  I used a whole salmon filet and cooked it on the grill.  I lined a large glass pan with foil, then placed the filet, skin side down, on the foil, then the toppings.  I marinated it for about four hours and then grilled it.  A tip for the fresh ginger root - use a garlic press to mince it - it works great!  This is going to my favorites folder!  Thank you!!!  Even my picky 9 y.o. son loved it...and I actually ate it even though I hate seafood!

Good flavor but cooking times are way off.  My salmon fillets were somewhat thick and I had to put the fish back under the broiler 3 times before it was done.  Even when I extended the cooking times the fish needed rebroiling.  I don't think I'll make it again.

My husband liked this.  I thought the flavor was kinda off.  The soy sauce was a little over-powering & the ginger got a little lost.  We actually liked it better the next day over a bed of Spring Mix salad.

The flavor soaked in nicely to the fish.  Tangy ginger and oj really good.  Do not, under any circumstances, make a sauce from the used marinade.  I followed reviews and tried this, boiling to kill bacteria, etc.  It Didn't Work!

This recipe was SO good and so easy to make!  My kids actually had seconds!  I only had a chance to marinate this for about an hour but it still turned out wonderful.

This was the best salmon dinner I've ever had.  I had some girlfriends over for a birthday dinner, and I was worried about one (who doesn't like ginger), however she ate every bite!  It was a hit!

This was probably the best salmon I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using the salmon filets from Costco.  It was my first time broiling salmon, but it came out perfectly and it was so fast to make!!  I thought the flavoring was perfect - enough to give it some extra kick, but not too much to over-power the salmon.  Served it with the Green Beans with Cherry Tomatoes from allreicpes, and it was a wonderful, easy, fast dinner. This one is staying in my recipe box!!

Okay, maybe it was our fault. But we marinated the salmon overnight in the exact ing. of the recipe and after grilling it was just okay. I thought the flavors would really pop, but it was just okay.
