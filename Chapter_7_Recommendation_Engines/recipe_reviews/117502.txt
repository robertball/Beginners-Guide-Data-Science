Excellent but a few suggestions:  candied pecans make a tasty addition and proscuitto balances everything.

Like Chill, I felt the recipe needed some balance.  I found adding balsamic vinegar a delectable finishing touch.

We really liked this. This is the first time I made fresh brussel sprouts.  The food processor really came in handy for slicing them thin.

Great recipe! I'm not a big brussel sprouts lover, but these were wonderful. The combination of the sugar and salt really made a difference and the toasted pecans just topped it off.

I'm always looking for ways to make brussel sprouts an appealing vegetable.  This absolutely does it.  I used olive oil in place of butter and skipped the pecans b/c I didn't have any on hand and it was absolutely delicious.  Thinly slicing the brussel sprouts is key.  It disguises their mini-cabbage look.

This was a good alternative to steamed brussel sprouts, but I'm still looking for the perfect recipe.  :)

I made this without the sugar; it was very good. My husband is not a sprout fan but liked this recipe. Will definitely make it again.

It was ok something different instead of just plan boiled brussel sprouts i believe a little lemon juice at the end of this recipe would go good.

This was my first experience with brussels sprouts, and I loved them! This recipe has a salty/sweet/crunchy appeal that nicely complements the taste of the sprouts. Hubby didn't like them, but I am keeping the recipe to make for myself.

I have made this recipe several times and just love it.  Most recently, I made it on Thanksgiving.  Sometimes when I make it, I feel it needs some acid to balance the bitterness of the brussel sprouts, but other than that, it is a great way to prep one of my favorite veggies.

My husband and I liked this recipe very much.  My son didn't - but he doesn't like brussel sprouts.  The next time I make this dish, I'll probably add a bit more butter, but otherwise it was perfect.

Didn't really like this. Not much flavor at all. Will stick to roasted brussels sprouts for now.

This was really great! My husband told me this was the best spouts recipe yet. I did add a little bit of balsamic vinegar like others suggested. With the pecans on top i did add a little bit of Goat Cheese. That really made it fantastic.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and we loved it! Made exactly as written, just added a spritz of lemon juice to my portion at end. Will definitely be my go-to recipe for brussels sprouts.

I'm afraid I can't get on board with the "best veggie dish EVAH!" comments, but it's certainly a nice twist - better tasting after it's cooled down and settled a little, as opposed to fresh from the pan.

I very much liked this recipe. My bf did not, but I have yet to discover a vegetable recipe he does like. Definitely still had the distinctive brussels sprouts taste, nicely mellowed by the seasoning.

I don't care for brussels sprouts that much but this recipe was surprisingly good.  My wife really liked it too.  I did add some mushrooms. Next time I want to add some water chestnuts as well...
