I love blueberry oatmeal!  We prefer this recipe with old fashioned oats (not quick).  Make in the microwave one serving at a time and cook for 3 minutes. Cooking the blueberries with the oatmeal instead of adding them later allows  some of the blueberries to pop and distributes the flavor throughout. Allow everyone to add their own brown sugar at the end so it's just the right amount of sweetness.  Fast and easy for weekday mornings.

Made this oatmeal scaled for 7 servings this morning. I used almond-coconut milk instead of regular milk. My 4 hungry eaters loved this oatmeal. The verdict is still out with two because they are still sleeping. The consistency is great and it is not too sweet for little ones. The vanilla adds an extra something. 
Thank you for this recipe, it is going into my stash of keepers per request of my children.

I thought it was good, but had a little less flavor than I was expecting considering all of the additions. The carb count was a little high for my liking especially with the brown sugar mixed in and yet it wasn't very sweet. I also doubled the amount of blueberries and could have put more in.

This oatmeal is alright. I'll still continue my search for a better one. I would add more blueberries.

I scaled down the recipe to 1 serving and used old fashioned oatmeal. I agree with another reviewer who said for all the added ingredients, it yielded little extra taste or flavor. Perhaps a bit too much cinnamon and not enough brown sugar.

This is perfect! Sweet, but not too sweet, and not too cinnamon-y. I didn't have flax or milk, and I used old fashioned oats, which still took 5-7 minutes to cook. I didn't think 1/4c would be enough so I put in a heaping 1/3c of blueberries, and I used frozen so I added them when I added the vanilla etc.. This is a simple, great recipe that my toddler and I both devoured.

I used soy milk and doubled the blueberries. I used steel cut oats and doubled the cooking time. Added some fresh berries on top. Not super sweet but you can add more brown sugar if you like. I thought it was quite good.

This is a great oatmeal.  My only changes due to taste preference.  I made mine with milk instead of water and doubled the blueberries.  It is a very filling bowl of oatmeal.  Saved the second bowl for tomorrow morning.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a delicious cup of oatmeal prepared exactly as described without any milk. I've already made it a second time as it's a nice tasty nutritious meal.

Overall the recipe was great, but I did double the blueberries and I would say adding milk or butter would be a must.

It turned out amazing, I didn't add any flax seed or blueberries, instead I added half a sliced banana. I also added a tablespoon and a half of almond butter or peanut butter for taste
