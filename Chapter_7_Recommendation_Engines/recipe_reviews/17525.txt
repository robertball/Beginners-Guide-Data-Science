Very good. Made some small changes to suit our family. Replaced mushroom with 1 diced potato, one medium diced carrot, 1 stalk diced celery and 1/2 cup of peas. Cut worchestershire to 1 teaspoon and added a bit of pepper. Cooked for 1 hour.

Tried this for dinner tonight, and my husband wants it on the regular winter dinner menu! I pretty much followed the recipe, one exception, I used the condensed tomato soup with rice by accident, but turned out really good! I used store brand premade pie crust, and that also turned out really well. I have some leftovers, and will be looking forward to having it for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for a great recipe Joy.

This is a good, hearty, traditional recipe.
I have tried a couple of successful variations.
Add mashed potatoes and top with shredded cheddar cheese
before baking.  You can also bake without an
actual pie crust if you want to save a few
calories.

I am sorry to say - but this entire went in garbage! I made the recipe exactly as stated - and the 3T of worcestershire was overpowering. Smelled like it at soon as you cut thru the crust - four adults tried it and we ended up having grilled cheese!!!

My family LOVED this!  We used corn and not mushrooms.  (Just a personal taste thing.)  We're adding this to our repertoire.

My family loved it!  Just before it was done baking I put extra slices of marble cheese and placed them on top, covering the whole pie.  Yum!!

This has been popular with everyone in our house and have made it for years.  The amount of Worcestershire sauce in this recipe is just too much - at least for our taste buds.  Perhaps it is a mistake in the printing.  Can understand why someone complained......this pie can also be seasoned with thyme rather than seasoning salt.

I added a can of petite diced tomatoes and some marcaroni noodles (don't cook them all the way). The noodles keep the pie filling from spilling out when you slice it, and helps fill up growing boys.

I made this on top of crescent rolls laid out in a pie dish (grease it first) topped with cheese. I subbed onion powder (because the kids hate onion pieces!) and cut the Worcestershire Sauce back to about 2-3 tsp. The kids loved it! Very yummy.

Great pie! I put a can of potatoes and cut carrots; that was the finishing touch! It tasted a lot like tomatoes, so when you do it if put half of a can of sauce.

Good recipe and very easy to make, though it needed more time in the oven than asked for.  Excellent leftovers, too.

My family liked it but everyone said it tasted like Sloppy Joes in a pie crust and it had that sort of consistency.  I guess we were looking more for a hamburger pie recipe that tasted more like hamburger.  Next time I will omit the tomato soup, add a 1/4 cup ketchup and a cup of cheddar cheese to hold it together.

I  liked it,  with a few modifications: I  substituted sweet relish for the mushrooms. I  then  added 3 oz of shredded pepper jack to the filling.   Instead of topping  with cheese, I mixed two eggs with 1 or 2 oz of shredded sharp cheddar  and poured this mix on top.

This just didn't thrill us.  It seemed a little too soupy for a pie and the flavor was just so-so.  OK for dinner one night but we probably won't make again.

This dish wasn't too terribly bad, but I agree with some of the others who said that the worcestershire sauce was way too overpowering. I also used Garlic Tomato sauce instead of tomato soup. I would make this again, but I would definitely cut back on the worcestershire.

I made this with leftover grilled hamburgers from a party and it added that certain flavor.  Otherwise, it was just boring.

Really easy and tasty. I used peas instead of mushrooms (can't stand 'em) and shredded the cheese for faster melting. Thanks for a great recipe!
