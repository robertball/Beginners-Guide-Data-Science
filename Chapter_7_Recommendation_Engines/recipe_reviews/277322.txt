Overall good recipe and straight forward to make with the Instapot. Definitely added the cayenne pepper at the end for a kick. They were out of sirloin at my grocery store so used a Cajun seasoned ribeye (double meat) instead. Turned out really really good! I may try adding a touch of heavycream next time to the bowl just to see how it is.
