This is one of my favorite simple potato/corn chowder soup recipes. What I like to do is instead of cooking on the stove, I layer the potatoes in my crockpot, then saute the celery with the onion and some fresh minced garlic in a little butter before adding it to the crockpot with the chives and some fresh ground pepper. Instead of using chicken bouillion (which for some reason, I rarely have on hand), I cover the ingredients with organic chicken broth. I cook that on HIGH most of the day, then mash with an old fashioned potato masher, then adding the corn. This recipe is very versatile as you can add in your favorites if you like, like shredded cheese, crumbled bacon or more sauteed vegetables or eat it as is. Great "until payday" lunch or dinner food as it costs so little to make.

Quick and fun to play around with.  I use the premade mashed potatoes, skip the celery (don't like it), and often add whatever veggies I have on hand, or sausage.  It seems you can't really screw this up - it's creamy and filling.

I made this delicious soup the other night for my husband and myself. We added in some carrots and used 4 cubes of chicken bouillon instead of 2. It was a huge hit with my husband and we plan to add this inexpensive dish to our normal menu.

Really great. In the beginning phase I added leeks and parsley root to give the broth more dimension and flavour. 
And towards the end I added a little bit of star pasta. Really great and hearty for those cold nights.

Great recipe. Some students made it for a socials studies project (to illustrate a typical menu of a particular time period) and everyone thought it was yummy.

Very good.  I boiled 3 potatoes,  and 1 carrot,  and mashed.  Saut√©ed onion,  celery,   some diced dandelion leaves,  and chives in 1 T butter. Mixed it all together with salt and pepper and frozen corn.  Sprinkled the top with more chives,  and fresh parsley.  Also added about 1/4 whole milk,  and 1/2 cheddar cheese when I added the bouillon.  Kids all ate it well.

I omitted the celery, because I don't usually think it adds much, and it was great - so easy, and deliciously satisfying! Will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed makeing and eating this soup.  I am not very good at making soup, however this seemed simple enough.  I did tweek a few things.  I cut the receipt in half, since it was just me having it.  I used these items because I had them on hand.  Yukon creamer potatoes, 1 can of corn nibbles with no water,7 ozs of frozen mixed veggies.  I did not have any celery so I used Mrs Dash salt free garlic & herb.  I had made bacon that morning so I added 3 strips, crumbled.  I think this added a little flavor as well.  It was perfect for an unexpepected cold weekend at home with not having to leave the house.

I have made this a couple of times and it was an absolute hit.  I used broth inside of the bouillon cubes, I also added a couple of diced carrots and some finely diced leftover ham.   Everyone loved this soup.

Whole family really liked this. I put this in the slowcooker and it turned out perfectly. Waited until late afternoon to add corn (last 2-3 hours) and added Lawry seasoning salt at that time. Didn't have chives so I didn't use that.  Also used a potato masher and mashed up some of the potatoes before adding in the corn.

I didn't have celery so I used celery seeds. I also added more bouillon.   It seemed a little thin when it was done, so I added some butter and milk.  Then I took a masher and gently mashed the mixture to bring out some of the starch to thicken it.   It was great!

Variation:  I added a dash of milk, some dried parsley, and used corn from leftover corn on the cob.  Also, I added the flower to the celery and onion that I sweated before adding the liquid, bullion and potatoes.  
Worked great, needed pepper.  If I'd had more herbs/seasonings and/or bacon it could have been even tastier.  
Great base recipe to build from

Very simple. I added garlic pepper to the recipe for added flavour.  I served it with garlic bread. It was very nice on a cold evening.

I don't love it, I think it needs more flavour. Maybe adding more bullion cubes is the way to go?

This is such an easy recipe for a filling, tasty soup. I used a variety of miniature potatoes (white, red and purple) and left the skins on.
