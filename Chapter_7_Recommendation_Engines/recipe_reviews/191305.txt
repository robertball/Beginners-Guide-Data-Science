I needed a last-minute dish to take to an Easter gathering.  I had salsa, plain yogurt, and green olives on hand.  I did an ingredient search and found this recipe.  I was skeptical because I've made a similar recipe, but never with plain yogurt, and always with black olives (not green).  To my pleasant surprise, this dish was EXCELLENT and definitely worthy of taking to the Easter dinner.  Kids and adults alike enjoyed it.

I try to be very health conscious, so this recipe sounded very appealing using yogurt instead of sour cream.  I was not pleased with the result, however.  I found the yogurt made the whole dish too runny. I think the recipe would be 100% better using low fat or non fat sour cream instead. Otherwise, great flavor.

If you use Greek-style plain yogurt, it is really good.  Thicker and creamier, not runny like traditional yogurts.

Good for about a 1/2 hour and then the yogurt turns really runny and starts to seperate.  I'm not sure how to make it so it doesn't do this but I am up for any suggestions.  Probably won't make it again.

I took the advice to use Greek yogurt and it wasn't runny. It was good but seemed to be missing something. May try tweaking it a little if I make it again. Thanks for the recipe.
