This is a pretty good kid-friendly recipe. My daughter liked it but I thought it was a little bland. Next time I think I'll season it a bit and use beef hot dogs instead of chicken to improve the flavor. Also the liquid didn't thicken very much but that may have been because I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed.

This was so easy and really was surprisingly delicious! Very few ingredients so its quick to make. Kids would love this. I used mild Rotel diced tomatoes and chiles because that's all I had in the pantry and I think it made it even tastier. Thank you! Will make this again!

This was good but I used chipotle swiss sausages with a frozen corn mix of green and red peppers and onions because that's what I had -- my kids aren't picky so it worked out well!:)

Draining the green beans is not enough; you need to drain the tomatoes too. Using tomatoes with chilies and adding salt and garlic powder helps with the blandness but it's still...different. 2/3 kids in my house ate it but both said that the flavors did not "belong together." I have to agree. I like the idea of a hot dog casserole but this is not the one.

Good stuff. My picky 15 yr old daughter liked it! I did add some things according to my available ingredients. Used frozen mixed veggies instead if canned adding about 1/4 c water. Added a few cloves of garlic one package of Lipton onion soup mix and seasoned with southwest chipolte seasoning. After baking before adding cheddar cheese in top I did add Velveeta cheese sauce when stirring.

Pretty good except very watery. Definately drain most of the water out of green beans and tomatoes. This would probably be good with crushed tomatoes also as the pieces are smaller than the stewed. Good served over rice.

This tastes really good on rice but it comes off as too salty. I'm not quite sure how I would fix that though.

I made it last nite with Trader Joes chicken hot dogs. I would drain some of the juices before baking as they didn't absorb during baking. Otherwise it was easy and tasty. Plenty of left overs. 4 stars

I made this since we were making meals on a tight budget. Like some reviews I agree with them that this dish tasted bland. Next time I make it as I probably will I plan on adding garlic powder all purpose seasoning blend and more cheese. I had only one can of green beans and had to supplement thawed mixed vegetables in place of the 2nd can of green beans. Not sure if that took away from the final taste of this dish but next time I'll try again with added ingredients.
