I have been making this recipe for over 20 years but call it by another name. I use Frito's bean dip for the bottom layer, I omit the mayo, and add garlic salt to the avacado's, but otherwise it's exactly the same and delicious!

I have been making my own version of this dip for years!  I have a great guacamole recipe, so I serve that separately and omit the avocado layer from this dip.  Instead, I scramble a pound of ground beef and mix it together with 1/2 the taco seasoning packet.  I then combine the other 1/2 with 2/3 c. sour cream and 1/3 c. mayo.  I layer:  bean dip, beef, sour cream mixture, tomotoes, a little chopped scallion and cilantro, then cover with cheese (not an olive fan!).  I arrange the layers in the middle of one my big turkey platters and then surround it with chips... Presentation is great!

This is an excellent dip.  I have made this by adding green chilis, cumin and chili powder to the bean layer.  It's pretty forgiving to tweak as you like.

This dip was awesome!  I made it last night for my boyfriend and we both loved it!  I used a half cup of creamcheese and a half cup of sour cream instead because I didn't have a whole cup.  I also baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.

AWESOME! This is definately one of the better taco dips I've had. Made this exactly as written, and there is no need to change a thing. I will be making this again for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used to make this all the time for family gatherings and everyone loved it.  Instead of using shredded cheese, I used warmed cheese dip so it could be spread easily.  That would be the second to the top layer, then for whatever the occasion I would spell out in the green onion "Happy Birthday to ..." or "Merry Xmas" etc. Everyone got a big kick out of that.

I've been making this for almost 40 years. It was a recipe given to me by a coworker at Hopkins in the 70s. Excellent. Everyone loves it whenever I bring it to a function. If there are leftovers, we spoon it onto plates and have it with corn chips for dinner. Yum.

I had this recipe many years ago and loved it!  It was my favorite dish to bring to parties.  And then...I lost it!  I have been searching every where for it for a long time and now, out of the blue, here it is.  You have made my day!  I can't wait to have an occassion where I can serve this again.  Thanks so much!!

This dip was a huge hit! To me was just ok, but everyone was asking for the recipe. I used my own homemade taco seasoning and since I didn't have any green onions, I topped with tomatoes, onions and fresh cilantro. I omitted the black olives because I just donâ€™t like them.

Made this dip for a birthday party yesterday and got many rave reviews from the people eating it.  I made it as written and wouldn't change a thing.  The variety of flavors does it all. Will be making this many more times.  YUM!!!

I added a bit of water just to make the refried beans easier to spread.  I used vegetarian, fat free refried beans, low fat sour cream and mayo, 2% cheese and left off the green onion (which is just a personal preference).  Took the dip to a party with Tostito Scoops - it was well received.  Will definitely make this again.

Yummy! Used fat free refried beans, store bought guacamole,  and made my own taco seasoning. Friends and family loved it...served with Fritos Scoops and tortilla chips. Made 24 hours in advance and kept perfectly in the fridge. Also made in a deep dish pie plate and looked very pretty. Thanks!
