Excellent recipe. I used hot Italian sausage, and omitted the fennel seeds as I can't stand it. Also used home-made marinara sauce. Definitely make it a day ahead of when you want to eat it - the flavors really intensify. Thanks!

Yummy and very easy to make. No where on the recipe said how much to heat the oven to so I did 350F and baked it for 17 minutes. It was perfect! My husband said they should rename this to Sausage Pizza Ziti!! He loves sausage and mushroom pizza and said it tasted just like it! This was so yummy! THANKS Buitoni!!!

Oh, we ate too much!!!  This was really good.

When I went to the store to buy the contents, I noticed that the marinara sauce recommended in this recipe cost exactly twice as much as the Store brand that is in jars.  Instead of buying two 15 oz. containers of the recommended brand, I bought only one....then I bought 1 jar of the store-brand marinara sauce in a jar.  There was VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE in taste between the two----so I recommend buying a less expensive brand.

I also marbeled the cheese throughout the recipe before baking it.....soooo good!

This was very good and very easy. Only change i would make would be to double the amount of pasta (use the whole box instead of just 8 oz) and double the amount of sauce. The quantity as is doesnt really warrant a 9x13 pan. Delicious though!

This was sooo good!  I am a new cook, though, and found the directions to be too general.  I used hot Italian sausage (slice before cooking, I guess, it doesn't say that) and poured a little sauce in the bottom of the baking dish before adding the pasta mixture so it wouldn't burn before the cheese melted.  I also layered the cheese throughout.  My boyfriend raved about it and ate all of the leftovers the next day!

I made this last night and I too also did a few modifications to the recipe. I ommitted the fennel seeds and made my own marinara sauce. In my sauce I added white zinfadel, onions,a few pieces of garlic, and red pepper flakes. Instead of using mild Italian sausage I used hot. And I used fresh basil and crimini mushrooms, intead of the regular ones and used lots of mozzarella cheese since I only had that. Otherwise, it was a pretty decent recipe. My fiancee loved it and ate just about the whole thing.

If you add the chesse though-out the pasta, it looks more like the picture. Other than that it tastes great!

Easy Easy Easy!   Even my 21 month old loves this!   he actually ate the sausage and getting him to eat is tough.  I added 1 can diced tomatoes and garlic.. very very good!

This was good!  I didn't use Buitoni ingredients - I used one 26 oz. jar of marinara and that was plenty.  It was easy and didn't need any additional spices.  I'll add it to my recipe box.

Good recipe, everyone enjoyed it.  I didn't put mushrooms in because of my husband but I bet it would be even better with them.

This was an easy, tasty dinner that everyone enjoyed. I made enough for six but it fed only three it was that good. Only change I made was making my own sauce.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! This is a very easy recipe and I had it ready in no time.  Unfortunately, the submitter did not include a baking temp, but I followed somebody else's advise and baked it at 350 degrees for 17 minutes.  It came out perfect.

I wanted to like this more but it was just too bland even though I added extra seasonings as well as red and white wine. My kids did the "how many bites do I have to have" thing. My husband enjoyed it but I have seen better recipes. Doubt I will make this ever again.

This was good and easy. The only thing I did different was to use hot Italian sausage instead of mild.

Would be really nice if they had included at what temperature a person is supposed to set the oven for the baking part of this recipe.
