Very good!  BE CAREFUL OF OVERCOOKING.  I had a 1.5 lb full lobster which went into the pot for 7 mins and it was a bit overcooked.  I would suggest 5 minutes unless you have an enormous lobster.  Excellent way to prepare it though!

This was good although 8 minutes made it a little on the rubbery side. Next time (and there is going to definitely be a NEXT TIME) I will start checking things starting at 6 minutes.

This was simply perfect.  Juicy, tender lobster.  Yum.  I added garlic to the boiling water and butter just because we love garlic in EVERYTHING.  Thanks for something so simple and wonderful.

Quick and Perfect way to cook your Lobster....my experience for two 1 lb. Lobster Tails went like this, Very Large Pasta Pot to a Rolling Boil , steam pot section was just and inch from the top of the water boiling water, cissor cut the two tails on the bottom side of the shell lenghtwise, used a wooden skewer to keep them from curling and in only 6 minutes lid on pot !  I found them perfectly done and easy to remove from the shell !  Have Butter Ready !! Bon Appiteto !

Simply the best way to do these steamed. Grilled is excellent as well, but this is perfect as is. I was wondering--has anyone ever tried using Old Bay in their boil? I never have, but am considering it next time.

If your not used to cooking lobster tails, steaming is definitely the way to go:) I also butterfly the tails and lay the meat on top. Very pretty presentation. (do this before steaming, broiling or baking) Rule of thumb is usually 1 to 1 min. 30 sec. per ounce. Another option is to take them out of the steamer 1-2min. early and finish up in a broiler pan to get some light browning on top- be very careful not to overcook. I serve using clarified butter.

Great simple recipe that lets the lobster meat shine by itself!  Simply great taste.  Will make again.  Followed the recipe to a T, except the timing, and adding lemon to the melted butter.

I would have given it 5 stars, except for the time to steam and prepping the tails -- mine were done in 6 minutes.  Overcooking will make them rubbery and stringy.  Cut the back shell with scissors all the way to just short of the tail, and if there is underbody, trim or cut the underbelly shell and any sharp points.  I did add a touch of lemon juice to the melted butter, but no other seasoning is needed if you have good tails.  

Made this for New Year's Day and in general turned out perfect.  Do however, pay attention to the size of your lobster tails if they are all going into the same pot -- smaller ones can be as little as 5 minutes and can be added after the steamer starts for the larger lobsters.  Also if you're using the frozen ones, defrost in fridge the day before and pay attention that they are consistent in size before you put them in the steamer at the same rate of time.

My first time making lobster. I bought some good size lobster tails from Costco. Followed recipe exactly but there just was not a lot of flavor to this and the texture was kind of chewy. I didn't overcook it either. Will keep my quest going for the perfect way to prepare lobster.

Nice and simple to make, since I used two 4 oz lobster tails, I cooked them only for 7 minutes...still a little over cooked though. I substituted the sea salt with Old Bay seasoning.  I will definitely give this another shot and try steaming for only 5 minutes next time!

Easiest way ever to fix lobster tails! I added some lemon juice to the salted water, and steamed 2 - 4-oz. tails for 5 minutes- perfect! I cut the shells before steaming, and they were pretty easy to take off. GreAt method - thanks!

Bought lobster tails from Costco...and decided to use the easiest recipe, since I love lobster and didn't want to waste it by making it rubbery.  The tails we bought were pretty big so ended up cooking them 10 minutes all together, but checking after 5 and then 7.5 minutes.  I also snipped down the centre of the shell so checking for doneness was easier, as was removing from the shell.  Can't wait to do this again!

This is a perfectly acceptable method of cooking lobster tails that result in their being moist and tender if not overcooked.  However, if you're interested in a dramatic and beautiful restaurant-style presentation for serving, this is not the best method and cannot take the place of that beautiful golden and somewhat crusted top that results from broiling.  Hubs made these for us tonite under protest at my urging.  Once they were done and he couldn't plate them as beautifully as he's accustomed to, he remarked that from now on he'll stick to what he knows works best. (And he swore just a little)

Very good and very easy!  As previously stated, I too think 8 minutes is too long and probably 6 would be fine.  I added a little seafood seasoning to the water with the sea salt and the results were delicious!  This was the first time I ever cooked lobster and I was feeling a little intimidated, but not anymore!

I have found the best way to always get delicious lobster tails is to first, use kitchen shears to cut through the top and bottom of the shell but leave it on. Steam them for about 4 minutes, cool and then remove the shells. When you are ready to serve, saute them in a generous portion of butter, over medium  heat for about 3 minutes and serve with plenty of lemon.

I made this for my husband and he loved it (I don't eat lobster). I took the advice of others and cut the time down to 5 minutes. I have made this twice now and it has turned out perfect both times. I also threaded the lobster with a short skewer to prevent any curling and added a garlic clove to the water as others suggested. Thanks so much for posting this recipe for us land lubbers who know little about cooking seafood.

I thought this recipe was great. I put the lobsters on their backs to do the steaming. When the time was up, I put them into cold salty water as instructed on a how to catch, cook, and eat lobster cruise. This keeps the lobster from continuing to cook and keeps the meat from getting tough.

Made these for our Valentines Dinner tonight!  Very easy and cooked my tails perfectly!.. I served with Old Bay seasoned butter.  Thanks for the tip of using a kabob skewer through the middle; they didn't curl up.  :)

Use beer as your liquid, add Zatarans (just a drop) crab and shrimp boil concentrate. Reduce cook time to 7 minutes. Absolutely perfect. Great flavor.

I had lobster claws and tails and i pulled mine at about 5 minutes and had to cook longer as they were not done.  I don't have a steamer insert so i used a huge pot and put two ramekins at the bottom of the pot and then placed a metal strainder with the bigger holes on top.  Work perfect!!

great and easy. Add garlic and old bay to water while steaming, only needed 6 minutes. Serve with brown butter: cut up pieces of 1/4 c unsalted butter, add to a cold pot, over med heat cook, stirring and swirling butter in pan until it simmers and starts to foam, then turn down a bit and cook until it smells likes toasted nuts, will cook fast, do not let it burn, pour through a coffee filter.

The best Lobster Tails that I have ever cooked. Just adjust the steam time according to the size of the tails. Simply Delicious!

Better than boiled.  I think those that got good results with 5 minutes used smaller lobster tails than 6 oz.  I pulled them out after 5 minutes and had to put them back in for a couple more because the centers weren't quite done.  4 oz tails probably take 5 minutes, but 6 oz tails took me a little longer.  BTW--I'm not from Maine, but Maine Lobster rules.  Everything else is second best.

I steamed my valentines day lobster this way and took the suggestion to add garlic to the water and changed cooking time to 5 mins for a 1.5 lb lobster-it was perfect!  Thank you for sharing.

This is the best recipe I've found for frozen lobster tails. I took other reviews advise and added garlic, lemon juice and Old Bay to the steaming liquid and steamed them just 6 minutes and plunged them into some ice water briefly to stop the cooking.  I used a small amount of butter, rice vinegar, lemon infused white balsamic vinegar, and Old Bay in the dipping sauce.  They were tender, and came away from the shell easily.  Most recipe call for grilling or broiling, but growing up in New England where the lobsters were steamed, I am pleased to find this recipe.  It is the only way to prepare lobster.

First time making lobster. Made them for my husband - chef of the family - for NYE. Such a hit that we made them again for our kids tonight. Agree with being careful not to overcook.  My tails were small - only needed 5 minutes and we're in high elevation so even less time would be needed at sea level. Served with butter lettuce, avocado, citrus slices and a light vinaigrette.

I was worried about it being under cooked so I cooked it for 13 mins. It was overcooked and stuck to the shells. It was great but a bear to get out of the shell. next time I will do 8 mins as instructed...

Very simple easy recipe. I also added lemon and garlic to the steaming water. I had smaller tails so I cooked them for about 5 minutes.

I used my rice steamer to cook a 12 oz. tail and 8 minutes was to long. Next one will check at 5 minutes.

So I followed most of the directions I did take a few ideas from other posts and I added some garlic powder to the water as well as the salt. 

I also only cooked it for 6-7 minutes. Once it was done I poured some lemon juice on the lobster tail added some salt and dipped it in butter... 

It was truly delicious and super easy which is a huge plus because this was the first time that I've ever cooked a lobster tail before...

Was great after I put it back in for another 8 minutes - total steam time was 15 minutes, first time I took it out it was still raw in the middle.  Wasn't chewy or tough the second time out.

I followed the suggestions of others and cooked 3 - 4 oz lobster tails for about 6 minutes.  They came out perfect!  Not rubbery at all.  This is a keeper.

My lobsters came out perfect! Don't be afraid that you'll "undercook" them. I was worried about taking them off the stove after 8 minutes since it seemed like not enough time to me, but they came out great!

This is also a great way to cook/re-heat frozen king crab legs (like the ones you get in bags at the grocery store). Crab legs are also meatier than lobster tails!!! I made them for my and my boyfriend a couple months ago by placing a steamer over a skillet of boiling water and then placing the crab legs inside for abuot 5 minutes - DELISH!

My husband brought home 2 Lobster tails last night for Valentine's Day and I have never cooked it before. I tried this recipe and reduced steam time to 5 minutes. It came out so perfect! I've had it in restaurants before, but this was the very best and so  delicious!

I bought lobster tails from Costco and boiled the pot of water as instructed and inserted a steamer.  I put all 4 lobster tails and steamed them shy of 8 mins and I took a bite and they were amazing.  The lobster was naturally salty so I added butter after and It was the easiest dish I had ever made restaurant style. When you are in a hurry this is the recipe to go to.

Good basic method -- and the skewers are a great idea as another rater suggested.  Beware, however, we had 2 1-lb tails.  I put them in a big steamer pot but on a small burner.  When the water came to boil, I put the lobster tails in but lost a lot of heat.  So 6 minutes turned into about 12 -- and not until I realized I needed the big burner.  I felt like they might be rubbery, but they turned out great despite my mistake.  Thanks for this easy method.

Sadly, I am allergic.  I made two 4 oz. tails for DH.  Along with the salt, I added garlic powder to the boiling water.  Cooked them for 5 mins. 30 seconds.  I also added garlic powder to the melted butter.  He loved them and said they compared to restaurant quality.

Steaming is so much better than boiling!  The lobster is moist and delicious.  I will try the old bay and garlic in the water the next time.

This was my first time making lobster and I was so pleased with the results.  I was so afraid of either overcooking it or under cooking it.  I let it cook for the full 8 minutes and it turned out so juicy and just perfect.  I can't wait to make lobster again!

Agree with other comments about timing- I used 5 minutes (no peeking) they were 2 perfect succulent delicious lobster tails!  Also added 1/4 cup white vinegar to water to enhance flavor.

Flavorless, rubbery (had 1lb lobster tails...took longer to cook).  The next time I used the Broiled Lobster Tail recipe found on the site and it was much better!

First time making lobster tails and the hubby was impressed! :) Researched and found that steaming was more recommended than broiling. I tried to butterfly them but the shell was too hard to pull back! At least for me. I cut the time to 6 minutes per reviews and turned out great. Served with clarified butter. Great for the first time trying! Will make again!

Very good basic recipe.  I made a couple changes.  I added a clove of crushed garlic to the water along with the sea salt.  I also reduced the cooking time to 7 minutes although next time I will reduce it further to 6 minutes.  I used 6 ounce tails.

A big hit with my boyfriend - I made him two tails (Costco - awesome) but the 5 minute cooking time suggestion I found in other reviews was pivotal!!! It was perfect! 5 minutes!!

I've tried doing Lobster tails on the bbq many times with varying degrees of success.  After reading this recipe I decided to give it a try and these were the best tasting and easiest Lobster tails I've ever made.  Thanks for taking the time to post this Nancy.

this was the first time my husband and I were trying lobster for the first time and we just don't like the lobster. We did add garlic to the boil and it gave a good flavor we just didn't like lobster meat.

This turned out great! As many other reviewers said, cook between 6 and 7 minutes any longer the meat would have been too tough. I also added cilantro and garlic to the water which enhanced the flavor and of course made the meal smell great!

I steamed four 4-ounce tails for about 4:30. I cut down the top but did not take the meat out. After steaming, I immersed them in an ice water bath because I was using the cooked lobster for lobster newburg. Once the tails were cool, I opened the shells and withdrew the meat. It was cooked perfectly. I have four more tails on hand and will cook them the same way but make lobster rolls next time.

Based on reviews and other recipes, I pulled together various modifications.  Had three 5 oz lobsters.  Added 2 tsp crab boil to water.  Cut back of shell w/scissors lengthwise down middle, but did not butterfly. I inserted wood skewers lengthwise through lobster.  This kept them from curling/turning over while steaming. The cut shell made it easier to remove shell and eat while still hot. Removed the thin digestive track ("vein")along length of the back.  Loved the clarified butter.  Steamed lobsters for 7 minutes.  Perfect and tender.  However, my lobsters were quite cold from defrosting, and the steam was low.  In the future, when they are at room temp and with better steam, I will try 6 min.  We saved the shells and steaming water in slow cooker and let cook 4 hrs on low.  Smells amazing and am anxious to make a seafood chowder with this base. Thanks to Nancy and all who gave suggestions.  I did consider putting lemon and garlic (love them) in the steaming water, but I enjoyed the pure flavor of lobster meat.  Will not add them in future.

These made a delicious addition to my Mother's Day celebration. (You're never too old to spoil your mom). On the advise of another reviewer, I added garlic to the water and butter. Mom declared her lamb chop and lobster tail dinner a flawless triumph!

I cut the top of the shell lengthwise to the tail. Then I made 2 sets of cuts across the shell top.  I stuck  small spoon into the shell ans reamed the meat away from the inside of the shell. Then pull all the meat out until the cut shell closes...the meat is sitting on top of the shell. Add a little Old Bay to softened butter and apply to the top and bottom of the meat. Steam per directions.  Eat soon thereafter so there's little residual cooking of the lobster which will make it tough.

SO simple (and delicious), I will never use another method.  Not that I get to splurge on lobster very often, but I'm always nervous I'll ruin them.  Mine were frozen tails weighing at .6# each and were very thick and meaty.  I thawed them and did as another reader suggested:  scissor cut down the length of the back and inserted a wooden skewer to prevent curling.  They cooked absolutely perfect at 8 minutes.  Served with lemon wedge and melted butter.  Heaven.

Great recipe.  I do recommend shorting the cook time by two minutes.  Mine was perfect!

Just an FYI on the steaming time. It will vary a lot depending where you live. (Elevation). Eg. we live at a ski resort elevation 4100 feet  I take 5 minutes to boil a soft boiled egg. I did the same our son’s place in LA and the eggs we really hard boiled. Works like a pressure cooker. More pressure faster cooking.

Hint: Don't buy the Costco lobster tails. I have tried them with different recipes and they are chewy and lacking in flavor. I get them at Safeway and they are delicious cooked the same way.  Try putting the thawed tails in a pot of water cold). Turn the burner on medium high and when the water boils, they are done! Easy peasy. (same for shrimp colossals).

I steamed the lobster tails in my Ninja 4-in-1 cooker.  The lobster tails were about 1/2 lb each so I steamed for 10 minutes.  Came out perfect.

Very simple and useful method.  The only addition for me was to cut the tail shells lengthwise both on top and bottom down to the tail using kitchen shears before steaming.   That way the tail shell easily pulls apart for serving and you don't have to fight with getting the meat out of a hot shell.

I used my pressure cooker. If you are using a pressure cooker its pretty simple. I poured about a cup of water in the pot, put in my steamer tray and laid the lobsters on top of the steamer tray (shell facing up, belly of lobster facing down on tray). I steamed them for about 5 minutes and they were perfect.

We don't eat much lobster so I didn't have an expectation for this.  This recipe was easy to make and we enjoyed the lobster. I did put some Old Bay seasoning in the water and I think that helped. Will use this again.

I actually used ingredients from another recipe, which I added to the water, lemon slices, orange slices, crushed garlic, smoked paprika, salt and pepper and some dried onion. Brought to a boil with my 4 tails over 4 mins. Kept lid on, didn't peak. Done. Tasty.

Have tried cooking lobster tails over the years several different ways without good results. They always seemed a little dry and or stringy. Was a little skeptical about steaming them but then thought why not. They were FANTASTIC!!! I steamed four 5 ounce tails for 6 minutes. I did cut the shell. They were moist tender and delicious and they came right out of their shell. I served them with melted butter, sea salt and crushed garlic.

Who would have thunk lobster was so easy to cook.  I shaved a minute off of the recipe to keep from getting rubbery and the lobster tails turned out fabulous.   Not rubbery, and easy to come out of the shell.  Served with bacon wrapped filet mignon for my wife on Mother's Day ... Was just as good if not better than the restaurant and a fraction of the cost. Thanks for the recipe.

I added a TBS of Zataran Crab Ol  to the water and a handful of fresh asparagus in the steamer with the tails.  A pasta side, and it was one of my best meals.  For a test I added two 20 count xl shrimp to the steamer also/ Wished I had put a half dozen in there.

My first time steaming lobster tails and they turned out fantastic. I don't eat lobster much so I can't compare the texture of the meat very well but I really enjoyed how they turned out and I'll maybe just stream smaller trails for a little less time next time to see if it is more tender. Maybe 6 minutes.

I use the miniature lobster tails (see recipe - 6 oz lobster tails) and put 4 in the steamer at a time.  They turned out perfectly and were a quick way to enjoy compared to the basting, prep and broiling I have been doing for the past few years.  

Mine came out cooked perfectly based on the recommended time. Very happy to have found this variation.   :-)

Same basic Idea but I use a Bamboo steamer basket.
Clean them snip off the bits, cut down the back, remove membrane and ugly track, loosen so they come out easy when done.
Frozen Costco defrosted, NOT CHEWEY / Rubbery at all or you DID over cook.  Far too long at 7 minutes for tails. They really only take 3-4 minutes. Check with an instant read thermapen after 3 minutes to be 140.
I'm trying Sous Vide next but I don't know how they can be any better unless you get better quality lobster

Mine only took 6 minutes to cook. However overall this dish is great! From reading others suggestions I also added a tablespoon of garlic and butter to the water. We will be having this meal again

i removed the underneath part of the tail, sprinkled them with Old Bay Seasoning and steamed them (belly up) for only 7 minutes, based on other's suggestions. I also put lemon slices in the water...they were perfect!

These were great. I did one minute per ounce of lobster and they were delicious. I did cut the shell and lay the meat on top. One tail ended up sideways and curled up, so be sure to position them correctly. I used a bit of butter melted and poured on the tails and a clove of garlic in the water. Delicious! Thank you!!
