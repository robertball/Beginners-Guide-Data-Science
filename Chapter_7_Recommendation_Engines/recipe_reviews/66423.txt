This recipe was great! I did tweek it a bit and followed some others advice.  I only used half a cup of mayo, not one full cup.  I also could not find grated asiago at my store, so I bought Kraft grated three cheeses with parmasean, romano, and asiago.  It turned out great, there was no mayo taste at all.  It actually ended up tasting like the Olive Garden alfredo dipping sauce, everyone loved it! Plus it's sooo easy to make and quick!

Good flavor.  Used canned artichoke hearts, drained them, and pulsed a few times in the food processor.  Added 1/4 tsp garlic salt and 1 tsp parsley for more flavor and color, although the cheese gives it the great flavor.  Also I baked it at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes (don't own a microwave).  I would serve this to company and will definitely make again!

Just came home from a party.  People raved! I added a little extra garlic. Really easy.  Really good. I'll be handing out the recipe at work!

Yum...I love this recipe!  But, I did tweak the ingredients a little.  I added a bit more cheese and a bit less mayo. Also, in addition to the marinated artichokes, I added some brined artichokes.  I loved that I didn't need an oven for this dip...I was able to bring it to a potluck and heat it up in our office's microwave.

Sorry, but I think one star is a VERY generous rating for this recipe. The mayo totally overpowered any other flavor.

Different.  The cheese flavor was a bit strong but had several compliments.  I may use sour cream instead of mayo next time for a softer flavor.

I give this 5 stars with changes.  I used only 1/2 c and used Miracle Whip in place of mayo. I also used 4 cloves of garlic.  Very easy to make.

GREAT RECIPE & EXACTLY LIKE ONE I HAD PURCHASED AT OUR LOCAL FRUIT & MEAT MARKET.  HOWEVER, THE 1ST TIME I MADE IT I DIDN'T FINISH READING THE DIRECTIONS & NEVER BAKED IT.  BUT IT WAS STILL  FABULOUS.  OUR LARGE FAMILY DEVOURS IT WHEN WE BRING IT TO GATHERINGS & WE DON'T BAKE IT.  WAY TO OILY THAT WAY.  TRY IT COLD!  AND I ADD AN EXTRA CLOVE OF GARLIC.  THANKS DENNY!!

Tastes like mayonaisse. I tried to save it by adding some extra cheese and putting it under the broiler for a few minutes. Even my "garbage guts" husband who thinks I know how to cook said "I'm not that crazy about it"  in a polite way.

This dip is very good.  In fact this is the first dip that I have made (of many) that I actually enjoyed. This tastes very much like an appetizer that my husband and I order from a local restaurant.  Now we can just make it at home.  I like the pumpernickel bread but next time I would serve it with slightly toasted Italian or French bread. Thanks for the recipe!

Used Miracle Whip instead of mayo; I really liked the extra tangy taste. Served for my Mom's 90th birthday party with various crackers.  Everybody aged 3 to 90 loved it!

I love Asiago cheese so I thought I'd try this out. It was okay, I too think the mayo was a bit much. I agree with another poster, maybe try sour cream instead next time.

Fabulous.. remember to drain the artichokes well. We used two types of asiago. Grated the softer, and broke the firmer into small chunks and stirred it in. Very well recieved.

I agree with a reviewer that the mayo overpowered the taste a bit.  I added much more cheese and tried Mozzarella with it too, and it was better.  It was served with whole grain crackers and turned out pretty good, but I couldn't get it the consistency that I wanted.  Easy recipe though, with fairly good results.

Love this dip...I always get compliments on it! I used ingredients as statedin the recipe, except added 1/2 c more Asiago. It helps cut the mayo taste down. Delish! (You can also use 1 tsp garlic powder if you donâ€™t have real garlic.)

Good Artichoke Dip recipe with the addition of Garlic and the subsitution of Asiago for the more traditional Parmesan.  I just couldn't bring myself to cook this in the microwave though.  I don't mind the extra time it takes to get those browned edges and top.  Very good with crostini or crackers.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.
