Take the submitter's advice and pour cocktail sauce over this before serving-it is out of this world!

I started with this recipe as a basic premise but wound up with something entirely different - used green onion instead of regular onion, added an avocado and used hot sauce instead of worcestershire

Made this for a friend's birthday and she loved it...almost ate the whole thing herself and didn't leave much for the rest of us.  I did pour the coctail sauce over it and also used less onion.  Thanks for the great treat.

This cheese ball is great. I used 1 can of crabmeat instead of the imitation crab. I meant to add a little Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning but forgot. So we sprinkled it on as we ate it and it definitely helped bring out the crab flavor. So next time I will add it to the recipe. Will definitely make again.

Made this for a 30th party and it was a hit.  I was a little discouraged when making it because I used fat-free cream cheese and the ball was not working too well.  In the end though, it turned out excellent and the cocktail sauce was a great addition.  Easy and quick.  Great recipe.

I served this crab ball along with three other appetizers at a cocktail party this weekend.  Maybe the other appetizers were better, but this dish just didn't "WOW" anyone.  It's the second time I have tried this recipe with different people, and the reaction is always just so-so.   Sorry, but I just don't think I will try this again for a third time.

I have never tried this with diced celery but sounds good to me!  Also, by using canned drained crab meat or canned drained shrimp, it becomes even easier and still just as wonderful!

I have made this recipe for at least 30 years.  I add garlic that is finely chopped, also finely chopped green or red pepper adds color, and I add 1/4 cup mayonaisse to make it in to a dip.  I always taste for salt and black or white pepper as I do not use as much Worchestershire sauce.
I realized it would be a hit when I took it to a Super Bowl party and the guys ate the entire double batch by half-time.

Mmmm? Mildly spiced?   Not at all! This was the blandest tasting recipe I've ever tried.   I added cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and eventually cajun seasoning mix to this dip to get it up to a mildly spicy state.  The recipe as-is is terribly bland.

Excellent!!!!!!!!! I used scallions and a bit of fresh basil and cilantro (have a herb garden) The second time had real crab and shrimp on hand very amazing! Love this recipe any way you choose. I ate the entire thing myself and had to make another the next day for it's intended purpose (a party)!

Made this for NYE party and it was a big hit! I made as directed except added a tsp or so of creole seasoning and instead of a ball I did a thin layer on a large platter and covered with cocktail sauce. Was sooooo good!

Absolutely delicious! It was gone nearly as soon as i put it on the table.  I accidentally only purchased 1 package of crab, half the amount recommended (too late to go back to the store) but it turned out great.  Might be a great way to save a little money :)

It would be 5 stars if my attempt at this recipe had the consistency of a normal cheese ball. However, after a day in the 'frige' wrapped up in plastic "ball" it did not really stay as such. My guests liked it and used  as a thick spread.

Followed recipe exactly except I diced the onion and celery instead of chopping it. I like it better without the cocktail sauce which is odd because I love cocktail sauce. And I like it better with regular saltine crackers rather than club crackers. I love it straight off the spoon! 5 stars.

Great recipe!  I made this because I had all the ingredients and my family likes imitation crab.  When I first mixed it and formed it into a ball, it looked really unappealing to me.  But I let it chill, poured cocktail sauce over it before serving it, then proceeded to DEVOUR it!  As did everyone else.  The cocktail sauce was definitely a crucial ingredient.  At the party I went to there was also a warm crab dip made with real crab (which I love and usually prefer to everything else), and the Devil Crab Cream Cheese Ball that I made got polished off long before the warm crab dip.

This recipe got rave reviews from my guests for its' taste.  It was very easy to prepare, too.  The only issue I had was its' consistency:  I followed the recipe to the letter, but found that it didn't set up like a traditional cheese ball.  It was more of a spread, even before adding the cocktail sauce. I'd still try it again, though, maybe adding something to thicken it a bit and help it set up more.

This went over well at a recent family gathering.  I wanted to mention that it is important to know that the taste of this is  DEVILED.  The taste is not that of crab and cream cheese only.
