Cooking with 1/2 lemon will reduce the slimy texture as frying the bamya will ruin the flavor. Fresh baby okra is best but frozen will do.  Cut off the end with the stem and poke holes in the okra so it will absorb the sauce. This recipe was also extremely bland in comparison with Egyptian recipes. I added 2 tbsp freshly crushed garlic, 1 teaspoon cumin, 4 cardamon pods, and 1 tsp coriander which is how my mother-in-law (who is Egyptian) suggested to make it my second time around. With the right seasoning and proper preparation this would be a great recipe.

I fried the okra slightly first, to stop the end product from being slimy or stringy. No need for olive oil. I also added uncrushed black pepper. Near the end of cooking the bamia I add lots of lemon juice and chopped green coriander.

Made it with goat meat and long bamia, as opposed to the more common short ones just because I had a bag :)

Very simple recipe, instructions and accuracy.
