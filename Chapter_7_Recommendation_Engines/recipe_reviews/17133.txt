This recipe is almost identical to a cake my mother makes.  A frosting alternative would be to 1) drain the remaining 1/2 of strawberries, reserving the juice 2) Cream 1 stick of softened margarine or butter with 1 lb of confectioners sugar 3) Add strawberries and 1/2 of the reserved juice 4) Add remaining juice by tsp until desired consistency is reached.  You could also cook the cake @ 350 F for 25 min (for 2- 9" cakes) or 40-45 min (for a 13x9" cake).  My mother has made this cake for >30 years, and it comes out great everytime.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and it was FABULOUS! I did use fresh strawberries instead of frozen and it turned out perfectly. Cooking time was right on. Cake is a nice pink color (which she loved) and is very moist. Instead of the strawberry icing, my daughter wanted something like a "wedding cake icing" which I found on this site as well. I frosted it with a very thin layer of that and it was wonderful! I will definately make this again.

Makes a fantastic frosting (goofy in other review it is supposed to be watery to an extent.... it is a frosting) not an icing (or is it the other way around) but anyway it is one of the best things I have ever tasted... perhaps I am a good cook??  ha ha ... everyone commented on it that tasted it and loved it!   Toni,  Thanks

I thought this was a wonderful cake.  Very flavorful and very moist.  To me, there were no ingredients missing; however, it did take a little longer to cook than what the recipe said.

Ingredient(s) are missing from the frosting.  I made recipe as listed and ended up with a liquid for the frosting.  I had to add butter and lots more powdered sugar to get it to a frosting consistency.

A very yummy Valentine's treat, but for strawberry lovers only.  I recommend it with vanilla ice cream.

I made the Pink Lady Cake for a bridal shower for my sister. It was delicious! Everyone enjoyed it, and it was gone by the end of the evening. I'll definitely make it again! :)

I t was edilble but thats about it. The cake took a long time to bake and then was just kind of mushy. It didn't even have a nice color when done. Probably would not make again

I made this once for a lady because she is obsessed with pink.  Since then, I have made it numerous times and it gets a lot of requests.  Its very tasty and incredibly moist.
