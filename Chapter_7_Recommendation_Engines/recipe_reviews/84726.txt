I have never taken the time to rate any recipe I have used on this site, but I felt compelled to leave this rating after tasting this dish.......absolutely DELICIOUS and wouldn't change anything.  Used spicy chicken andouille sausage from Trader Joes and for the pesto, used an awesome recipe I found on the foodnetwork website for basil pesto which had pinenuts in it.

I made this dish the other night and it was absolutely delicious.  The only 2 things I changed was I used chicken broth in place of the wine (not a huge wine person) and I used Feta cheese in place of the goat cheese.  VERY GOOD!

This was a great recipe.  I made a few changes.  I used Whole Wheat penne, and didn't have any beans, or cherry tomatoes to add and I substituted spinach for the arugula.  I also added pine nuts, which were a great addition.  I also used the Costco mozzarella, spinach and tomato sausage that I saw someone else used, and it work great.

I plan on making this again, but I will use the cherry tomatoes for sure.

This was great!  We got arugula and cherry tomatoes in our CSA box this week - this recipe was perfect!  I substituted spicy Italian turkey sausage and great northern beans b/c that's what I had, and we loved it!  Thanks so much.

Absolutely wonderful!  Based on our preferences, I changed the following:  Used spinach instead of arugula; substituted a brown rice/wild rice mixture for the pasta (my husband will not eat processed foods!).  And we used all organic ingredients.  Turned out fabulous!

I thought this was very good.  I used spinach and feta since that is what we had in the house.  I will make again.  I did not use the wine b/c I was afraid the kids would not eat it, but next time I will.  Also, I used Great Nothern White beans because thats what I had.

This was delicious. Like many others, I used what I had on hand, so I substituted spinach, pinto beans, feta cheese, and a mixture of chicken/artichoke and habanero sausages. But I thought the proportions and the garlic/pesto/wine flavor really made it wonderful. I'll definitely make this again.

This was fine but not fabulous. I liked all of the individual flavors but found the blend somewhat strange . . . not bad, but strange. Perhaps that had something to do with my choice of sausage? I got chicken apple, since it was the only chicken sausage without nitrates at my grocery store.

I really enjoyed this.  I didn't have pesto, so instead added basil and parmesan cheese and a bit of extra olive oil.  I'm sure it would be better with actual pesto.  Kids liked it too!

I used chicken and gouda sausage from Costco and sun dried tomato pesto and feta. It turned out great and smelled amazing with the wine! Will definitely make again trying different combos- maybe homemade arugula pesto and spicier sausage.

Not a fan. It was difficult to eat because of the penne pasta and the flavors are all over the place. I will not be making this again.

like others I had to use what was on hand.  Whole Wheat Pasta, Chicken Andouille sausage, garlic, onion, and fresh from the garden tomatoes.  Topped with goat cheese.  This is truly awesome and we ant to try the arugula which would add the extra kick.  I have adult kids (24 & 21) and they loved this.  Servered with a whole grain bread to soak up the wonderful sauce!!!!!!  Try, it is great!

I liked this a lot, but my 3 yr old thought the sausage was too spicy, so he wouldn't touch it.  It had a great flavor.  The only thing that I found weird was that 8oz of pasta seemed way too low.  I ended up measuring 16oz of uncooked pasta, which seemed more realistic for the rest of the ingredients.  Maybe I missed something?  I did choose to use whole grain pasta just to make it a bit healthier. I also found the taste of the beans to be strange, so I may leave them out next time. Anyway, I will definitely make this again.

I omitted the arugula and used baby spinach instead.  Very good. My husband doesn't like spicy, but my boys do. It wasn't too spicy.  I suppose if I used plain sweet italian sausage he would have liked it.  We enjoyed it very much and will do again.  Goat cheese really makes it.

I liked and they loved.  I did make some subs.  Instead of andouille, white wine, basil pesto, canellinini, arugula, grape tomatoes.  I used chipotle-jack chicken sausage, chicken stock, homemade arugula pesto with parmesan, northern beans, spinach and petite, diced tomatoes with chilis in a can.  I omitted the goat cheese (we had blue cheese for lunch and I didn't want to overwhelm their taste buds) and added Badia Complete Seasoning to taste.  I thinned the sauce with pasta water and juice from canned tomatoes.

This is great! In the past, I've made it without the arugula because I don't like cooked spinach and I was afraid this would taste similar. Recently I made exactly as the directions said and it was fantastic! Cooked arugula tastes nothing like cooked spinach. I think the only change I'll be making in the future is a little more pesto and a bit more salt.

I used this recipe as a shell and improvised.  I used the whole wheat penne.  I added baked chicken to the recipe that I seasoned with onion salt, pepper, poultry herb, and basil.  I used the garlic, olive oil, white wine and some pesto that I made awhile back and stored in the freezer (luckily, it thaws very quickly).  I added the chicken and Conecuh sausage along with kale and bits of spinach and arugula and added a drained canned of diced tomatoes.  I also added some light butter to thicken the sauce.  I was worried it would have too much garlic taste with the garlic and the pesto, but this was actually really nicely balanced and not overly filling either.  The goat cheese is a great addition.  I will be making this again!

Tasty and easy -two essentials for me. The arugula gives a nutty flavor. I used leftover sliced chicken breast instead of sausage and Northern beans.

Fantastic!  I also used Feta but it would taste great with many types of cheeses.  I didn't think I was going to like the beans, but I didn't mind them at all.  And the Trader Joe's Chicken sausage was perfect!

My husband loved this!  I changed two things.  I exchanged chicken broth for wine.  I omitted the garlic because my husband isn't a big fan of garlic.  It was fantastic. I was really just hoping to use up all my arugula but will now make this dish again just because it was so good. Enjoy!

I too used Feta rather than goat cheese. But that is the only thing I changed.  I wasn't sure husband would go for this, but the loved it.  Tasted even better the second day.

I substituted a few ingredients for what I had on hand: Hot Italian Poultry Sausage, spinach and feta cheese. Simply delicious - can't wait to try it exactly as written. Thanks for the post.

This was a great recipe but required a few modifications due to lack of ingredients. * Removed tomatoes * Added extra 1/4 cup wine, lots of extra garlic, and more olive oil * Added some red pepper for extra spice * Used additional 2 sausage links for more meat to pasta ratio

This was fantastic. I left out the pasta since we're on pasta overload this week. I added 3 extra sausages. I used the cooked chicken tomato, basil & mozzarella ones from Costco. I added a tsp of red pepper flakes for spice. I served w/a salad. Bread would be nice too to mop up the sauce. Thanks!

This is great.  I had to make some changes based on what i had in the house.  I used sundried tomato pesto instead of regular pesto, sundried tomatoes instead of grape tomatoes, left out the arugula and used garlic and herb feta instead of goat cheese.  It was delisious, will definitley make again, and will try the original recipe too.

Made this & it was great!  Was even better as leftovers the next day with the noodles mixed in overnight, so next time we will add the noodles to the pan and let them soak in some of the flavor before serving.

Using what I had on hand -- substituted mild Italian chicken sausages (this household doesn't do hot peppers), and spinach instead of arugula, and feta instead of chèvre.  It was yummy, and I'll make it again with those sausages! Not a gorgeous dish, but wonderfully warm and filling.

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   The family was asking for more, but I did not make enough.  This dish will definitely be in the family meals rotation in the future.

Even though the ingredient combo sounded so off to me (beans with pasta?), I decided to trust the reviews and went for it.   Wow!  This is an EASY recipe that is also DELICIOUS, fairly inexpensive, filling, and is perfect for leftovers/freezing.  To me, it would fit in The Cheesecake Factory’s lineup.  As recommended by others:  1.  I made sure to use SPICY chicken sausage and not apple or something else; 2.  I reduced the dry pasta by a couple ounces;  3.  I added a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes while cooking the garlic;  4.  I added a little Cajun seasoning, to taste, with the salt and pepper; and 5.  I used feta instead of goat cheese.  Notes:  1.  If you look at the second photo by S. Matthews, it is a much more accurate and appealing depiction of what your finished dish will look like if you follow the recipe.  I will absolutely make this again.  And again.

Me and my boyfriend loved this. Took about 30 mins. Instead of the chicken sausage I jus,t sauteed two chicken breasts that were chopped.  added olive oil to the mix, used 3 cloves for 3 servings instead of white wine I used chix broth along with about 4 oz of red wine. I didnt use any beans, I added mushrooms, red pepper, a lot of pepper, oregano, lime juice just a splash though, about 4 basil leaves shredded, 1/4 of an onion, and rosemary. cooked everything seperately. after the chicken was made I threw it into the mix. put pasta on the plate, fished out the mix and then got a ladel and spooned on the sauce. absolutely amazing. I recommend about 3 oz of goat cheese per serving... and I did not use pesto, just other herbs. I felt pesto and goat cheese would have made it too strong.

Awesome....I did make a few changes- I used parm in place of goat and forgot the beans, so I left out. The sausage I bought was spinach/asiago cheese, so I used spinach in place of arugula. I made the pesto(also a recipes from this site).2 of my 3 toddlers ate two plates!!!

This was a good and hearty meal. I didn't have sausage, so I used chicken breast and diced it up. Seasoned with a bit of Tony's Cajun spices, and it was great. My family was impressed.

According to my husband, this is the BEST MEAL I've ever made! I didn't have any beans, but it was still fabulous. I added sundried tomatoes along with the cherry tomatoes, and used fresh spinach leaves instead of arugula. We are the leftovers again for dinner tonight!

I loved this and so did my husband.  So easy and inexpensive to make.  I didn't have pesto, so I just added a bunch of basil.  I also think you could half the goat cheese to make it a little less fattening and it is just as good.
