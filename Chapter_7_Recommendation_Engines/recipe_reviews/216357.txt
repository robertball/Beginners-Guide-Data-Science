I am the submitter of this recipe-make sure you use the green chilies in these~~they really make these outstanding!!  I prefer mine without cheese. You can defrost them overnight in the fridge.

We browned pork sausage, onion, garlic and red pepper, drained grease.  Added velveeta until melted.  Mixed in beaten eggs and green chilies until set.  Spoon onto flour tortillas, top with salsa and ENJOY!  Did not use any butter.  This recipe is very versatile with the ingredients you have on hand.

Great recipe!  I use roasted green chiles from New Mexico and they add so much flavor! Sometimes I use chorizo instead of plain sausage. We keep chipotle salsa in the frig at all times and this really makes them tasty.

I made a half recipe of this. I added fresh minced garlic in with the onion and I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta, only because I don't keep processed cheese on hand. I also used my own homemade salsa. Quick and filling.

These are absolutely delicious! I made a few small changes such as using sausage AND crumbled bacon and added sauteed mushrooms. Used shredded sharp cheddar instead of the velveeta. Loved the green chilis, they add just the right taste. The only other thing I did differently was I did not include the salsa inside the burrito but added it as we were eating them. Next time I might used pepper jack cheese or add just a few jalapenos for a little kick. Also might use a hotter salsa, I just used mild this time for those in my household that dont like very spicy foods.These get 2 thumbs up!!

Great for breakfast "on the go"! I cut way back on the serving size because I didn't need that many. I used microwave sausage links that I cut in half lengthwise and then scrambled my eggs and usual adding the green chiles.  I didn't have Velveeta on hand so I subbed a Mexican blend and used a fresh salsa.  Just about anything you put in a warm tortilla is gonna taste great and this was delicious with a side of light sour cream!

We have been making these for a good while. I use Jimmy Dean sausage, regular, or a mix with sage and hot. The difference - I smoke the 1 lb. chubs of sausage (known as a "fatty" in the smoking world) until done then chop them. The smoke flavor really adds. And another addition that makes them KILLER is Tabasco Sweet & Spicy, which you have to order on-line from the Tabasco site. But it's worth the hassle, just make sure you order several, you'll be hooked.

What is the best way to defrost. Could one defrost over night and heat in oven......I would like to defrost 10-12 at once rather than use microwave.

These were amazing just the way the recipe was written. My 14 year old son said that was the best breakfast he had in a long time and my husband said a few more good words than that. We will be eating these frequently.

Very, very good.  Made exactly as per the recipe.  After all, how can I rate a recipe if I change it?  Needs no extra seasoning. I had to scale down to match what I had on hand so I ended up with 6, 5 went in the freezer.  I ate  one right away and if the submitter’s comment about it tasting better later on is correct, I’m looking forward to more of these.  Great idea. Excellent recipe

This is a great basic recipe for a quick breakfast. I made it once and it was delicious, but I made some changes the second time. I used chorizo instead of regular pork sausage as I wanted some more spice. I also browned a bag of frozen Potatoes O'Brien threw them into the mix. I added diced green onions to the eggs and doubled the green chiles. Since I was serving this to a young men's soccer team (think 20 hungry 18 year olds) I ended up doubling everything and then threw it into a crock pot on the warm setting. When they were ready to eat, I just loaded up the burritos with filling, salsa, and cheese (did not use processed cheese, but a Mexican blend and Queso Fresco).  I ended up with a little left over filling, so just made extra burritos, wrapped them in waxed paper and froze them. They are great to take out of the freezer in the morning, use the defrost setting on the microwave and then finish heating on a regular setting.

I left out the velveeta (that stuff is expensive to me) and used smokey links in place of the pork sausage. Turned out yummy!
