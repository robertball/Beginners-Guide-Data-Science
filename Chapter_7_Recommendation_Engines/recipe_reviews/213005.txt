wow.  this brings back memories of my lolo's cooking.  this was his ultimate comfort food specialty.  he never used prawns but he added slices of ginger and/or ampalaya.  i think the prawns make a wonderful complement.

This was the first time I made this and it turned out great!  I used my slow cooker to soften the beans which turned out perfect.  I also added tinapa in the soup...so good!

Good recipe, easy to follow thank you!  Ummm, instead of olive oil -- vegetable, corn will do, also - instead of salt -- season with Patis (fish sauce) for more aunthentic flavor.  Delicious nontheless!

This was completely unknown, as I bought some organic mung beans on sale and had no idea what they were. This got thrown together, pretty much exactly following the recipe (minus the prawns, I'm allergic) and I was blown away. I made a HUGE batch, and it was one of the FEW dishes that I wasn't SICK OF by the time it was gone. I would say it was even better the second day after letting the flavors blend overnight in the fridge. Will DEFINITELY make this again!

I know this is called mung bean soup, but I'm not convinced the mung beans actually add anything substantial, certainly not taste. I also tried the rice as some suggested, but think it does better as a soup. Besides that, I added fresh ginger, a splash of white wine in with the garlic and onions, and a pinch of red chili pepper. I tried adding ONE anchovy before simmering, but actually think it could do with two (ended up adding a few drops of fish sauce as well). Shrimp and spinach should be added at the last minute. LOVELY recipe! Very flavourful. I'll be making this again. Curious to try it with vermicelli noodles, but I'm convinced it works better as a soup.

Om my gosh - excellent!  I've never cooked mung beans before, always just sprouted them.  I had no idea how delicious they are - they look like lentils when cooked but taste like black eye peas.  I used vegetable broth rather than chicken broth, but otherwise followed recipe.  May be one of my new favorite soups!

This was a regular dish when growing up in our Filipino household....but we always( and as as Fat Mike said) added shrimp to this for an even more delicious dish...always over rice!

Simple and easy. I simmer it with anchovies and add prawns (shelled and deveined) towards the end of cooking. I use the shell of the prawns by simmering it in vinegar and/or white wine, ginger, a bit of garlic and white onion to make a jus for steaming halibut or wahoo. These go so well together it makes my mouth water just writting about it.

These are great. If you have never had mung beans and Malungay leaves, you're missing out on a great meal.

Very nice soup/stew. Because I wanted to save time later, I put the mung beans in a pot and brought to a boil, then tuned off the burner and went for an errant. When I returned I drained the nearly cooked beans and added them to the sauteed vegetables at same time as the rice.  The only other changes was that I sauteed 1 lb of Kielbasa sausage with the onions, added 1 large can of tomatoes, and did not add shrimp. Very nice meal.

This ended up turning into a green sloppy mush when it was finished. I thought the pork and shrimp combination was an odd mix of tastes also. I won't make this again...sorry!

Yummmmmm! Almost like my dad's, but he adds a couple of pieces of ginger and a dash of patis (Filipino fish sauce) for flavor which I did to this recipe. Mine came out a little too soupy so I would cut back on the chicken broth, maybe only add 2 cups. But it's a great recipe, tastes even better the next day!

This is pretty close to the recipe I got from my mother in law! The only difference is she doesn't mash the beans. It's served over white rice. Yummy!

Used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. Added moringa leaves. 

Added 2 cups of chicken broth because my kids love soup. Yum!

This is just awful.  The color is unappealing and the aroma is not appealing either.

It all went in to the compost bin.

Instead of pork, we used  extra firm tofu. We also added a TSBP of fish sauce to give it a little more flavor. Delicious!

My son loves this stuff growing up with grandmas cooking. Did it myself this time. Made some changes ... used pork belly -  adobo style , used bittermelon leaves instead of spinach ...  added cubed squash at the tail end ... packed meal ... topped with ciciarone accents ...
