This was good. I would definitely double or triple the recipe next time because two servings wasn't enough! I thought there was too much cheese for the amount of spinach mixture that 10 oz fresh spinach made.

I liked it, but it needs work. First of all, it could really use more salt. I had to add nearly two teaspoons (maybe more) to get it salty enough for me. Also, the amount of spices seemed a bit bland upon completing the dish. Keep in mind, I didn't have any fresh spices-only dried ones. I did 'bloom' the cumin in the pan in oil like it said, but next time I'll try 'blooming' all the spices together. I used fresh spinach, which seemed to create a lot of extra water, but I think if I tweak the recipe, it will turn out better.

Excellent dish. Almost restaurant quality. Next time I will use tofu instead of the cheese. Thank you

So yummy! Subbed TOFU for the paneer, and added sweet potatoes. So creamy with the cream!

I liked this a lot and will make it again, I haven't tried other recipes and have nothing to compare it against. But, anything with spinach and chees is going to make me happy.

Didn't love this.

Main issue was bitter tasting Spanach. Next time I will cook spinach for only 10 min or less (supposed to combat the bitterness). Careful the Cuman seeds burn quickly. Needs far more salt, far less water (it was way too watery so maybe half the water). When you put in blender, do it on low (3 on mine) and not for very long. Otherwise it will get pasty. Also it felt kind of bland but maybe that was just the too much water causing a problem. For kids that done like spicy, use about half the red chili pepper. The amount this recipe makes is not a lot. I tripped it which gave me two meals for a family of 4.
