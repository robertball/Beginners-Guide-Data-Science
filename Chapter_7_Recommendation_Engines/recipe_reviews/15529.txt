This recipe makes the end product too hard to accomplish.  Just peel the garlic and boil it with the potatoes.  When the potatoes are done, drain them and place in mixing bowl.  Add butter, milk, sour cream and whatever fresh herbs you have on hand ( rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano, parsley, etc.) whip to desired consistancy.

I would make this recipe again, but I think I would omit the thyme. Just too much for my taste. The roasted garlic gave it a very good flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

this was a good recipe...although not perfect.  I would also cut down on the herbs, maybe to just the rosemary.  Also i tried a rosemary garlic version of this where i roasted the garlic.  I also boiled the potatoes with half the liquid consisting of water and half chicken broth and added garlic.  Well ive tried many versions...you can always play with mashed potatoes.  By far the best gravy i have ever had consisted of 2 cups of my chicken broth i boiled the potatoes in and the rest turkey stock and added chopped portobello mushrooms...it was to die for. I wouldnt use olive oil in mashed potatoes, use butter. You dont want that oily consistency.

Okay, so I don't know how to make mashed potatoes, I admit it.  But, I followed the recipe exactly, and what I got was potato soup!  It's clear that the recipe should say:  add liquid ingredients GRADUALLY, until potatoes are fluffy.  If I'd done that, I bet it would have come out correctly.  BEWARE!

We loved these. I skipped the first part because I buy the bulk minced garlic at Sam's. I do like chicken broth in my potatoes so I used way less milk & some chicken broth. I usually always use butter but the olive oil was a very nice change. I am feeding a large family so I used way more potatoes. Everyone really loved them!

Although good, I think the amount of milk added to the potatoes makes the dish too watery. Less is best!

I liked these potatoes, but I made a few changes in them after reading some of the reviews.  I did cut down on the herbs a bit and reduced some of the liquid so that they wouldn't be as runny.  The result was good.  They tasted very similar to what I would buy from a store brand boxed potatoes.  I will definately make again.

I thought it was kind of bland, so I added the broth I roasted the garlic head in and it turned out really good. The consistency of the potatoes was just right.

I liked these mashed potatoes quite a bit -- however, if I make them again, I probably will cut down a bit on the herbs.

I used two heads of garlic, a mixture of herbs I have basil, dill, marjoram, parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, and I used a lot less milk. My family and I really liked it and I will make it again.

There was way too much thyme in this for us. There was also too much liquid, they came out very runny and plain. I added a lot of salt and parmesan cheese in order to try to rescue them. Won't make these again.

I think the secret to GREAT mashed potatos is three things in this recipe: olive oil, rosemary and thyme (and of course salt).  Made otherwise plain potatos taste awesome!

I only used a half teaspoon of thyme as I didn't want to overpower the rest of the flavors in this dish. I actually used 6 large red potatoes and butter instead of olive oil. The roasted garlic really was what made the dish. It was just perfect with the thyme and rosemary. I liked it but my three boys were kind of less than thrilled. Too bad.

I followed the recipe but they came out kind of runny.  Maybe use huge potatoes or cut back on all that milk.  Very tasty though.

I made this to go with beef tenderloin with roasted, scallion port wine gravy for New Years Eve dinner. I loved the roasted garlic but overall the recipe was a little blah.

These had good flavor.  I think I would add some sour cream next time.  I liked the herb mixture, I can see why others would not though.  Personally, I like to put fresh cilantro in my mashed potatoes. Roasting the garlic definitely made a nice extra-garlic taste.

Wonderful!  I had to user 7 medium sized russet potatoes instead of the three potatoes the recipe called for.  It came out perfect with a wonderful garlic taste.  My husband like them also too!

This was ok but I dont see how the originar recipe made 5 servings. I had 7 people to feed and I had way more than double the potatoes. And I trippled all the other ingredients except the garlic (I didn't want it over powered) but it just wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be. I might try it again but I will do it as the original recipe says and see how it goes.

No one in my family liked this recipe at all!  I reduced the milk so it wouldn't be runny and slightly reduced the herbs.  I think there were still too many herbs and the flavor didn't blend well.

Pretty good recipe for mashed potatoes, and pretty healthy, too.  The roasted garlic lends it a really subtle garlic flavor, it is what makes the recipe.

Delicious.  I took this to a potluck, and it is the only thing that was finished!
