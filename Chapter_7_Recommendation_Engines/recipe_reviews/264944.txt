I loved this!!! I did a couple of things different instead of regular ranch seasoning I used 1 packet of Hidden Valley Dip Mix Fiesta Ranch and instead of oil I used 1/4 cup Italian Dressing. So much flavor!!

I really enjoyed these potatoes. They were very easy to make and required few ingredients. In regards to the previous review about it being bland, I just added more of the dressing mix right away and it turned out great! Also, mine cooked much faster than 30 minutes so I would suggest checking them sooner. Thanks for the recipe!
