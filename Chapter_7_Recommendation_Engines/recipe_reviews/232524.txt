This is so simple and so tasty.  I microwaved the cauliflower for three minutes, stirred the cheese into the hot cauliflower and then stirred in the mayo mixed with the mustard and curry powder.  The blend of flavors is spot on.  Thank you, Helen!

OMG!  SO good!  Couldn't stop eating it!  I used a full head of cauliflower.  I also mixed the cheese and other ingredients up first then put the steamed cauliflower on top so it started to melt it and then stirred.  Other than that didn't change a thing and can't wait to make it again!

I used shredded cheddar as that was all I had. Maybe that was my problem. Also, I cut the curry amount in half and still the curry was a little over dominant. I don't think I will be making this again.

Excellent mixed with cooked brown rice and baked in casserole for full meal. Could add cooked chicken if desired.  I'm not a big curry fan, but LOVE the way the curry and Dijon plays off the mayo and cheese.  Similar to a baked chicken and broccoli divan dish I've made.

Here's what I did: 1) Increased the amount of curry b/c I like curry, 2) Added cayenne pepper to taste, 3) Placed mixture in small baking dishes, 4) pre heated oven to 375, baked for 30 minutes.

Came out nice and al dente. I tried the steam method, but it didn't see to go.

Love this and will continue to use throughout the year.

The ingredients are simple and easy to follow so I'm certain it was made according to the recipe but I did not care for it. I love curry but I did not love this. Neither did the rest of the family .

Entire bowl vanished.  I had a very large head of cauliflower and half was just right.  Smaller head and I might have used the whole thing.  Added more curry powder because I could.  Delish and so much easier than making cheese sauce.

Pretty bland and way too cheesy. We love cheese but it overpowered the cauliflower.

With all the cheese, this did not taste cheesy at all. It tastes like curry, and it is very easy. I liked it. It is not my favorite, but not bad either.

this is very good.  Totally KETO diet ingredients.  I used homemade mayo.  I like the taste of curry, so used a tad more.  The dijon really gives it a bit of tart so it doesn't feel so rich.  would definitely make again.  Quick and easy accompaniment to dinner.

I served this as a replacement for a starch rather than a vegetable.  We all really enjoyed it.  I made no changes.

Really good!  The only thing I did differently was give it a sprinkle of sea salt before serving.  Thank you!
