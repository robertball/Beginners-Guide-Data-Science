Love, Love, Love, Love this sauce.  So easy to make I don't think I'll ever use jarred sauce again!  I didn't make the Ditalini, but used this sauce in roasted veggie lasagna, and what else can I say. . . YUM!!!

I used the idea, and experimented a bit. To 5 lbs of fresh roma tomatoes from our garden, I added 2 large onions, 2 large green peppers, lots of fresh oregno, and a small pile of garlic (along with generous olive oil, of course)!  Baked for 1hr 10 min, then left it in the oven til all the heat was dissipated.  I ended up with a delicious concentrated slurry to serve as a base for our marinara. I added 2 cans of tomato sauce and simmered.  We added sweet Italian sausage cut in bite-size chunks (pre-fried), plus a lb or so of pre-fried ground beef (plenty of pepper, a bit of salt).  The idea of carmelizing these ingredients is genius!

Oh. My. Goodness!  Really, really, really great sauce.  Did I mention this sauce was really great?  You must buy the San Marzano tomatoes.  I didn't think they would make a difference, but then I thought, why would Chef John lie?  He wouldn't!! I quadrupled the recipe for a large office lunch, with a few cups left over to stash in the freezer.  I paired this with the World's Fastest Meatballs (also by Chef John), to make meatball subs. I also used this sauce with stuffed mushrooms and it was heaven.  I could drink this sauce!

I LOVED this recipe! The sauce is absolutely delicious, however I would recommend doubling the serving size- when I made this for some friends the sauce was literally gone before half of the pasta was even touched. Needless to say everyone loved it

The house smells so good when I make this sauce. I did not add any water afterwords,so it would stay nice and thick. It Makes the best pizza sauce. Awesommmeee! I have made it twice now. First time with dried oregano still awesome.the second time with all fresh herbs even more better! Thank you Chef John.

Our home grown San Marzano tomatoes, garlic, herbs and onions made this sauce into absolute perfection.  I wish there was some way to preserve the aroma of the roasting vegetables, it is pure heaven.  Aside from using fresh tomatoes, we followed the recipe to the letter and will continue to do just that since there is no way to improve on this wonderful sauce.

Yum!  I made this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious!  There is a kick to it with the red pepper flakes and we enjoyed it.  I added some extra crumbles of goat cheese because I like it but you donâ€™t need to!  As is it serves about 4 adults.  Will make this again!

I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS RECIPE!  Incredible!  I absolutely loved this!  I made it exactly as written.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to scrape the burned tomato into the mix, but I did and I think that's what's giving it the taste that I love.  I made it with this recipe last night and now, this morning, I made an Italian omelette and put the sauce inside.  Thanks so much Chef John!  You did not disappoint!

I thought this was a good recipe!  The only changes I made were to add cooked Italian sausage to the cooked pasta (my husband needs meat in everything) and I used a whole onion instead of a half.  It turned out great and he loved it!  It was a great use of some leftover goat cheese that I had.

I'm sure this is amazing the way the recipe is written, but I made a few changes because of what I had on hand that my family loved.  I had tons of cherry tomatoes growing so used those instead of San Marzano.  I added a diced eggplant that needed to be used to the tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, onion, red pepper flakes, and oregano.  After roasting for about 15 minutes, I decided to add a 1/4 cup of dry red wine.  After another 15, I decided kamalata olives would be divine and added half a cup of those.  At the one hour point I added two tablespoons of grated pecorino Romano to give it some flavor and add thickness, I mashed with a potato masher and added my linguine directly from the water.  I did not simmer on the stove with water, use an immersion blender, or add goat cheese because I did not have any.  Because of the eggplant and Romano cheese, the sauce turned out velvety and delicious.  The seeds popped in the mouth.  I will definitely make it this way again.

I followed this recipe exactly with two exceptions, I left out the red pepper flakes and I used two cans of tomatoes, I increased the fresh oregano, onion and garlic to taste. It is not salty AT ALL. I mashed the mixture only slightly giving the sauce a really nice chunky texture. I adore goat cheese, for me, that was defining ingredient for this recipe. Absolute YUM!

Wouldn't make again. Way too spicy (red pepper flakes?). I suggest simmering sauce after adding cold water while waiting for pasta to boil.

Whole family loved it!  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden instead of canned and it took a little bit longer to roast off all the liquid.  Well worth the wait!

This is my very favorite tomato based sauce! I'm on a low sodium diet and this recipe is low sodium and delicious. I usually double the recipe, so I'll have extra for another use, but the family loves it so much that they just use more sauce on their pasta.  I feel that the San Marzano tomatoes are important to the recipe  because they have so much flavor. It works well on any pasta shape that I've tried it on, and the goat cheese is a nice taste kick!

I have this recipe to thank for the accomplishment of making my first ever homemade roasted tomato sauce in my adult life. I am 32 years old. This recipe is good for the sauce alone, but it also introduced me to ditalini and using goat cheese in a pasta dish. Win-win-win! I learned a ton and am so appreciative of Chef John's super ideas. My husband dished up on a heaping pile of seconds. Will definitely make the sauce more regularly now that I understand how simple it is to accomplish!

Tasty and made the house smell delicious.  I like my pasta a little saucier, so I might add this amount of sauce to a little less pasta next time and maybe add a bit more red pepper.

My son and hubby said this was good.  I thought it was super yummy!!  I doubled the recipe, use the goat chese (which I ususally don't like) and topped it with feta.
