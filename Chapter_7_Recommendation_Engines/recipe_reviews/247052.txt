Delicious! I used orange-flavored black tea, as suggested by the recipe creator, and it was great! This reminded me a lot of iced chai tea, which is one of my faves. This is a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious! I put in a little extra sugar and added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract at the end in my pitcher of tea. I also used a little sweetened condensed milk and half&half. This IS the definitive thai iced tea recipe I will be using this a lot!

This was a good iced tea.  I like the Thai spices but just not in a tea form.  I was a little skeptical about the sweetened condensed milk being too sweet but I was surprised how mellow the sweetness was.
