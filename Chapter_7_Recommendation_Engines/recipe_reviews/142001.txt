Easy to make and satisfying meal which is healthier than the usual fish pie. I made half the recipe using smoked haddock, normal onions and mature cheddar cheese. Also added some defrosted frozen peas and spinach, and mushrooms with the milk, fish and onions to make it a full meal to eat at work. Didn't add the creme freche/fromage frais as it would have been too wet(I didn't cook it in the oven): I've frozen the portions and will be reheating it at work in the microwave. Simple and yummy.

Delicious...I used red onions because I was out of green and they worked fine. Cod by itself was also a hit.

This is so much like the Fish Pie my granddad used to make.  The only change I made was to add a bit of garlic powder to the fish and milk.  I served with crusty bread and a big green salad.  YUM!

I substituted cheddar cheese. I also added a can of drained peas before folding in the fish. Served with southern corn cakes, this was just about perfect!

Yum - comfort food at its best.  I substituted some salmon fillets for half the haddock, and some prawns - clearing the freezer nicely!  We also popped in a handful of sweetcorn and swapped the Emmental for Cheddar, as the fridge dictates.  All gobbled up from youngest to eldest, with extra children.

Yum!  Great comfort food, and it's like the fish pie my English grandmother makes.  I used cheddar instead of Swiss cheese.

I made this recipe with cod, because I had cod in the freezer already and I substituted box spud flakes instead of fresh potatoes because I am trying to get rid of the box stuff. I added a little extra milk and butter to the fish, and then when the fish was done, I just mixed the flakes right into the same pot. Also I grated two medium sized onions and substituted parmesan cheese instead of Emmentaler. It was pretty good, but you'd have to be in a real fish mood for it.

This was alright. I made it for my family and no one was really fussed over it. I will make it again, but I'll add salmon with the haddock for color, texture and flavor, also will season more.

I didn't enjoy this recipe enough to want to make it again in the future.  I have a ton of recipes that do not require as much work and yield results much tastier; this is quite bland.  Also, I recommend adding the milk mixture little by little because I think there was too much milk (results were very runny) and also the method of preparation involving using the same milk you cook the fish in left me tasting way too much "fishy" taste in the final product.  I like fish, so long as it doesn't taste like fish.  Thanks, anyway.  It was worth a shot!

This was sooo tasty creamy and cheesy. Ultimate comfort food. I didn't have crème fraiche so I made a small portion of béchamel to thicken things up a bit. I used cheddar in the mixture and emmenthal/Gruyere on top.  I used regular onion. I found myself licking the bowl while the dish was baking in the oven.
