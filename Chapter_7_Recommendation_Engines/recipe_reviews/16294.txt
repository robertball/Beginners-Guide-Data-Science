This was a great recipe.  I added just a touch of powdered sugar because we like our a little sweet.

I may have made a miscalculation when I increased this recipe, but it seemed like there was far too much dressing for the amount of fruit/veg/nuts. I would definitely make it again - it just needs a bit of tweaking.

I made this this past thanksgiving and my family loved it. It could have used a bit more cream and some sugar but was very yummy.

This was my first time making a Waldorf Salad.  This recipe was simple and easy to follow.  It tasted great, with all the different tastes hitting your tongue at once.

I can't begin to tell you how many recipes for waldorf salad I tried from this site and elsewhere before my husband finally said that "the sauce" was exactly right. I have to agree that this is by far the best recipe for waldorf salad. I think what makes it so good is the heavy cream and the nutmeg. When I made it, I used red delicious apples (because they are my motherinlaw's favorite apple), but I think it would be good with a less sweet apple, like a jonathan or macintosh, too. I used red, seedless grapes. My motherinlaw, who is 93, said it tastes like the waldorf salad that she made. At her age, I think she knows what traditional waldorf salad should be like, and this is it! Use fresh lemons, because that keeps your apples from browning as well as giving a little zip. I always prefer fresh lemon juice over concentrate.  Thank you, June, sharing the perfect Waldorf salad recipe. My search is FINALLY over! :-)

Initially this recipe turned out too tart. First,I think I should of used sweeter apples. I cut down the amount of lemon juice and added honey to sweeten it up. I did not have enough raisins for the recipe and I think it I had the right amount that would have made it sweeter as well. The day after Thanksgiving I added leftover turkey and it made a wonderful turkey waldorf salad!

A little too tart from the lemon juice and I added some coconut to it. Later, I read the reviews and noticed that some people had added sugar to sweeten it. Will have to try it again with the sugar.

This is another great one!  Extra surprises of raisons and grapes are extras.

Very good. I added some sugar to the whipped cream and omitted the grapes. I used Gala apples and pecans instead of walnuts. If the salad is put together quickly, there is no need for the lemon juice at all. Everyone enjoyed this. Good addition to the Thanksgiving menu.

Very easy recipe! I used craisins instead of raisins (what I had on hand) and lemon juice just to coate the apples.  I also doulbled the recipe and it turned our great!

I like to add dried cranberries and dried blueberries I omitted grapes. Healthier, yummier and more colorful for a great 4th of July salad. Delicious!!

Cut recipe in half. A good tasty salad. A break from the regular leafy salads.
