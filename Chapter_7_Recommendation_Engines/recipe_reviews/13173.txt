There is no way the measurments on this are correct... I had to alter everything. 1 c of chicken broth is supposed to make a pot of soup? Not so sure about that. I used a lot of different spices to add more to this... I also used 4 c. chicken broth and 2 c. milk... made plenty. I used red potatoes with the skin, and about 8 c. diced zicchini. This tasted wonderful, but I had to write all over the recipe to make it right... I'll make it again, but my own way.

After tinkering with it, I liked this recipe. It's begging for salt and pepper and it definitely needs to be pureed. Extra milk doesn't hurt either. Couldn't believe it called for only 1 cup of chicken broth! I worried that it would burn before I ever got to add the fresh herbs. In place of savory, I used fresh thyme.

This was very good, had to omit the savory but it was fantastic without it too! Also very easy and quick to make, Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Really good with Italian bread and cheddar cheese sprinkled. I also added fresh chives, dill, marjoram and sliced mushrooms.

I don't know how this soup got 4 stars!!! This is the only bad review I've given on allrecipes. Usually I alter everything I make for personal preference, but this needed some major alterations.  Use the zucchini onions and potatoes and alter everything else: add ingredients, take out ingredients, more of this, little of that.

This recipe was awesome. i did use butter instead of margerine for flavor purposes. i omited the savory simply because my grocer did not have it. after simmering for 20 minutes i blended it in batches, then added heavy cream instead of milk. topped with croutons and sour cream, this is a wonderful dish

This is a good soup.  I think it needs salt and pepper, though.  Also, I pureed it after it was thoroughly cooked--it seems more palatable that way to me.  Don't forget the sour cream when serving.  It definitely "makes" the dish.

For a switch, instead of the sour cream, some cheese sprinkled over the top (cheddar?) might be good.

Tried this soup and I found it tasty.  I did not have but 2 zucchini but had everything else.  I will make it again the way it is.  I did add salt but that is personal taste.

I picked this recipe because it didn't have to be pureed.After making it I realized that this soup really needs it! Too many big chunks.Added a little curry to help with flavor.I've never given a bad review, but here it is.

I can't imagine making this kind of dish without altering the recipe.  It's begging to be interpreted by individual tastes (I used roasted garlic, tandoori spice - fantastic!).  The idea that the recipe gives is fantastic - thanks for posting.

I adapted this recipe for my daughter with milk and chicken allergies.  Olive oil for butter and vegetable stock replaced chicken nicely.  After pureeing (it is a must!), it didn't even need milk.  I also only had fresh basil, but that was just fine.  It was in the bland range of pureed soups, hence the 3 stars.  The kids loved it, however!

Wonderful recipe, I halved the butter and added olive oil. I also added curry powder and celery salt to the oil at the begining. Worked great a main dish, very filling!

Great recipe. I added knorr® concentrated stock and 2 cups water instead of 1 cup chicken broth.  When done cooking used submersion blended to partially cream. I also added some spinach asiago cheese chicken sausages.  Fantastic.

Really quite tasty.  Nothing exotic, but nice.  Extremely quick and simple soup.  It is even surprisingly satisfying.  It really is even quick enough for a last minute soup and sandwich meal.  However, this is only as good as your zucchini.  If your zucchini was not watered well, you are in trouble.  Test your zucchini before preparing this soup - even if it is from the store.  Stores even have bitter zucchini at times.  If it is bitter, make some zucchini bread or something.......  But when you want a simple soup, this is really good.

Good soup, but I took some of the other reviewers’ recommendations and added more broth and milk, as well as some salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

This was a good base for Zucchini soup, but I found I had to enhance by adding salt, pepper and 1 shredded carrot for a bit of sweetness.  I also used a full 14oz can of low sodium chicken broth.   Again, a good base with lots of potential.

Good base recipe that can be tweaked to your taste. Sauteed the veggies in olive oil. I only had three zucchinis, and I used the herbs I had on hand - parsley, savory, and some fresh thyme. It does need salt and pepper, as others have mentioned, and I have no idea how this could be done with only 1 cup of chicken broth - I used the whole 32 oz box, and then just added a little milk at the end to give it a bit of creaminess. I also pureed it. Delish.

Its a great recipe, but the ingredients are off.  I used 4 cups of Veg broth and it was great.  Also cooked with salt and pepper since I read the earlier reviews saying it needed it.
