Very yummy and extraordinarily easy to make!  I used Catalina, which added zing, and used No Sugar Added apricot preserves--tasted more natural that way.  My husband gobbled it up!  Great for a meal you don't want to spend much time preparing.

Later note:  I've made this multiple times, and lately decided to try something new with it.  I used chicken pieces instead of breasts, since I had a package on hand I needed to use, and I put this all in the slow cooker rather than the oven. I used fat-free Catalina and no-sugar added apricot preserves.  I also added some minced garlic (from a jar).  WOW!!!  I think I liked the flavor even better this way, and the chicken was incredibly tender.  The minced garlic added a little something extra that made the sauce incredible.

I have been making this recipe for years but with a twist. I pound the chicken till it is very thin. Make stuffing (I use stove-top). Put a spoon fool of stuffing on top of the chicken and roll the chicken up. Then place the chicken in a casserole dish and cover with mixture. Bake at 375 for 45 minutes.

I have been making this recipe since the early 1970's.  It's a family favorite and I often make it with whole chicken cut into eighths or just boneless, skinless chicken thighs for pot luck dinners and as my contribution to parties.  I recommend if you can find it to use Wishbone RED Russian dressing.  Much less sweet taste than the pink Russian dressing.  I live in Morris County, Denville, NJ and the Key Foods Store has this brand. I have recently found the Wishbone Red Russian dressing in the local Shop-Rite markets. I also use Lipton Onion Soup Mix.  I have tried other brands and found them too salty or to intense taste of dried onions.

In an effort to cut some of the sugar and based on another reviewers suggestion, I used fat free Catalina dressing and Smuckers reduced sugar apricot jam and it was still to sweet for my taste.  However hubby loved this recipe as it definitely satisfied his sweet tooth.  NOTE:  This is an excellent crockpot recipe with cook time of approximately 6 hours on low.  Serve on a bed of rice, sprinkle with crushed peanuts and it's dinner!

I tried this because of the high marks from reviewers, & was not disappointed- and my somewhat picky husband loved it; however, it is virtually impossible to find Russian dressing & I did not want to add the pickle relish of 1000-Island.... so I did the homemade Russian dressing combo of ketchup & mayo with a 1:2 ratio; I cut the recipe down, so I used 1/4 cup ketchup mixed with 1/2 cup fat-free mayo & 3/4 cup apricot preserves; sounds like a weird combo at first, but it was excellent!!! Very tangy... I also used this on chicken strips instead of breasts, which cut down the baking time to 30 minutes & was very tasty

Wow!  This is SO good!  I first made this for my husband
and mother-in-law, and was a little anxious to see how it
turned out.  I was not disappointed!  Both my husband and
mother-in-law loved it!  The three of us easily devoured
all six chicken breasts.  Oh, I only found an 8oz. bottle 
of the dressing, and had just one packet of onion soup mix.  
It came out great that way.  The second time I made it, I 
simply used one bottle of dressing (8oz.), one jar of apricot
preserves (10oz.), and one packet of onion soup mix.  It was
excellent!

This is an easy and delicious recipe!  It is wonderful with apricot preserves; however, I have also made it with raspberry preserves, and I think I actually prefer the raspberry.  Both my husband and I love this recipe.  It has become a regular in our household.  (Delicious with rice pilaf!)

This is such great recipe.  "What tender chicken!" everyone moaned -- with full mouths.  So I made this "as written" the first couple of times and served it over brown rice. Always one to experiment, I added a few touches the third time I reached for this gem-of-a-recipe.  Here's what I did:
Lots more chicken (family pack).  Used only one pkg. of dry onion soup mix, to which I added: the apricot preserves; 1/3 C. good-quality DRY Sherry (please, not "cooking Sherry"); 1 tsp. DRY mustard; 1 tsp. ground WHITE pepper; and 1 C. raisins.  Also, I used "Light" Catalina Dressing.  The beauty of this, though, is that Shirley's recipe is delicious as it is.  But if you have some extra time and want to add a bit of flare, the sky's the limit!  Cook time can be less, like 45 min., so be careful or chicken will dry out.  Thank you Shirley.

The recipe came out very good. I used frozen chicken breasts (did not defrost and cooked for about an hour), a "natural" onion soup mix, and spicy french dressing,and about half a large jar of apricot preserves.  I think it would work well in a crock pot.

I have to agree, the onion soup mix added the artifical concentrated onion mix flavor, but other than that the flavor was really good.  I only baked the chicken 50 minutes, and it was done, but extremely tender.

I should have listened to the review that said this was awful! One of the worst things I’ve made from this site so far. It had a really funny taste and was pretty much inedible. That apricot and onion soup are two flavors that should NOT be mixed!!!!

My boyfriend makes this exquisite dish for me. It is one of his family favorites, handed down to him. Only, instead of baking it, he saute's the boneless chicken pieces in a skillet with a little olive oil until the pink is gone, and the outside is a little browned. Then he adds the the sauce, reduces the heat, covers and simmers it, and ... Yummmmm! Don't forget to stir it periodically so it doesn't stick. This skillet method cuts cook time down considerably!

I have been making this recipe for a few years now.  But, I usually put all the ingredients in the crockpot and let it cook on low all day.  Just before serving, I stir the mixture with a fork until the chicken is shredded.  I then serve it on top of rice.  This is the perfect busy day recipe!

I've been making this chicken dish for years and it has always been a favorite with my friends and family!!  I noticed that many people had said that they couldn't find the Russian dressing.  It's out there!!  Just keep in mind that it's only made by one brand and that's "Wishbone".  I've never used anything else.  And like others, I also recommend lowering the cooking time to maybe 45 minutes...depends on how big the chicken pieces are.  And last but not least...you have to try serving this with a baked potato!  Open it up, pour some of the sauce over top, then put some shredded mozzarella cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Oh ma gosh...so delish!  Not low cal by any means, but makes a sensasional meal when you're not worried about counting calories!!  This is one of my husbands "top ten" favorite meals.

This dish is very forgiving—you can easily substitute thousand island dressing for the Russian dressing, vary the amounts of the ingredients to taste, use different chicken parts, or move the whole thing to a crock pot. The crock pot version is juicier than the oven version but still very good. Chicken thighs work very well in this recipe and are usually cheaper than breasts. I've tried searing the chicken before combining with the other ingredients, but that doesn't seem to make enough of a difference to bother with. I've also tried adding dried apricots, which was very successful.

My favorite version so far has been 12 chicken thighs, 1 bottle of thousand island dressing, 1 envelope of onion-soup mix, 1 jar of apricot jam, and 8 ounces of diced dried apricots, all cooked in a crock pot on high for four hours.

Overall, this is a good basic, easy recipe that's a big hit every time.

DELICIOUS!  This was a very easy, fast, and yummy weeknight dinner!  I used skinless chicken breasts WITH the bone (stays more moist that way).  Makes a great 'sauce' in the bottom of the pan to pour over the chicken and some rice!
UPDATE 2008:  I now make this dish in the crock-pot and it turns out great!  Slice up a large yellow onion and spread the slices on the bottom of the slow cooker, season well with kosher salt and lemon pepper.  Use skinless chicken breasts WITH THE BONE, and lay them on top of the onion, and sprinkle well with minced garlic, kosher salt, and lemon pepper.  Pour the sauce mixture over the top and cook on low for about 5 hours (any longer and it gets dry).  Perfect every time!

Great recipe, I've been doing a variation of it for decades...my mom thinks she invented the concept! I've always used  1 to 1 1/2 cup each of dressing and jam per envelope of soup mix. Any chicken parts work great, with or without bones/skin. For variety, add crushed red pepper to taste. My family loves it extra extra hot. ALWAYS A HIT!!! Try it with garlic mashed potatoes and corn. The chicken's sauce is great as a gravy over everything. If you've never tried this, you'll love it for dinner tonight, sooo easy and yummy!

This chicken is wonderful just the way it is written. You must use Wishbone Russian Salad Dressing, regular with sugar apricot jam, and good quality dry onion soup mix. When the computer doubles the recipe however, it calls for 3 pkgs. onion soup mix and that is WAY TOO MUCH, 2 bottles of salad dressing and 2 cups of jam. I used one pkg. soup mix, 10 oz. dressing and 1 1/2 cups of jam for 12 half breasts. Let it marinate several hours before cooking too.

This was an extremely easy and great dish to make.  The apricot jam lends a nice touch of sweetness, yet, it's not too overwhelming for the tastebuds.  I also used the red Russian dressing as another viewer had suggested, and it turned out perfectly.  Will definitely keep this recipe in my book.  Thank you, Shirley, for submitting a nice alternative to the plain ole chicken recipes out there.

This is a SUPER easy way to please a picky husband and kids (4&8).  Sounds like a strange combo of ingredients, but just let them try it and don't tell them whats in it.  Went well with a spinach salad and broccoli from the freezer.  Thanks Shirley!  This could be even easier in the crockpot I bet.

This is very good. I only used 1 packet of the onion soup mix and it was perfect- not too salty, and not an over powering onion taste. I doubled the sauce and served it with egg noodles.

This was very good, and easy to make.  The russion dressing made it tangy.  I used thighs instead of breasts because my family likes dark meat better.  I was a real hit!

So tasty. I had heard of this recipe for years, but never dared to try it. Seemed kinda gross to me, but it really was sooo tasty. I used 4 bone-in and 2 boneless breasts and each turned out very good. So easy to make, too. I used sugar free apricot preserves and the red russian dressing. I also sprinkled some red pepper flakes on top for a little heat. Served with rice, too. The rice with the sauce was probably my favorite part. Happened to have some almond slivers served with asparagus that got into the rice on my plate and added a nice little crunch. Could use water chestnuts to add some crunch on purpose if you wanted to. Can't justify making this a staple because of the calorie content, but will use again for a group since it's so easy. Love anything you can just throw in the oven. Definitely let it sit for 15-30 minutes after it comes out of the oven to allow the sauce to thicken a bit.

Just made this last night, for the simplicity of the recipe it was delicious. Served it with white rice and steamed broccoli. My wife and daughter loved it. I will definately be making this again.

Good flavor, tender meat.  Couldn't find russian dressing so used catalina as stated in other reviews.  scaled down to three servings and used less onion soup mix, and dressing.  Increased amount of apricot preserves.  Also added a splash of orange juice to glaze mixture and lightly seasoned chicken with orange rind.  Result was a sweet glaze witha slight kick. Delicious!  Will definately make again.  Thanks Shirley!

I don't know what went wrong here but this is the worst chicken I ever made.  I used Wishbone Russian (Red) dressing and fresh chicken brests.  With all the positive reviews, I guess it's just me but how can you mess up such a simple recipie?

Wouldn't have thought to put this combination together.  But it was very tasty, and super easy.  Served it over wild, long grain rice, and we all agreed that the best part of the meal was putting the sauce from the chicken on the rice.  Thank you for sharing this with us.

This is the best recipe yet from this website.  The reviews are true!  My notoriously picky 7 year old daughter actually told me it was so good that she wants me to make it again.  She has never done that!  I threw it together in just a couple of minutes, very quick to prepare.  I didn't have a 4 QT casserold dish, so I used a 13x9 in. glass dish and cut the time down to 45 minutes.  It was tender, juicy, and the glaze was yummy.  I ABSOLUTELY will make this again.

I've been making this recipe for years -- my kids loved it, even my picky daughter who didn't like foods with sauce.  It's easy and delicious.  Once you've combined the sauce ingredients, you can use half of the sauce for one meal (depending on how many people you're cooking for) and save the rest in the fridge for later; the sauce mix will keep for a long time in the fridge.  But it's really important that you get the clear Russian dressing (which can be hard to find) rather than the thick Russian dressing that is sometimes put on reuben sandwiches because the thick stuff is more like Thousand Island dressing.

This was a sweet dish and a little tangy, I guess that was the dressing. This was really simple to fix and used ingredients I usually have on hand. Easy enough for a busy weeknight meal with no hassle. This did not make our favorites though, so I probably won't fix this again.

This was yummy! I used peach/apricot jam instead of apricot preserves because that is what we had on hand. We also made our russian dressing from a recipe on this website (much cheaper and super yummy!) I reserved some of the sauce and cooked dried apricots that we had reconstituted in it and served it over the chicken and couscous. AMAZING! Tangy, Fun & Flavorful!

Tasty, but VERY sweet. I made russian dressing from ketchup, mayo, and grated onion plus a dash each of worcestershire and hot sauce, and used about half apricot preserves and half orange marmalade. This is a real 1950-70's "Woman's Day" type recipe you'd remember from your childhood - not classy, but definitely comfort food - or, as one reviewer so delicately termed it, "white trash chinese food".

This is a very easy and tasty dish. My boys love it. I've made this in a crock pot and used skinned and boneless chicken thighs instead and let it cook all day on low. All I do is make rice and veggies and dinner is done in about 20 minutes.

This is a real easy, tasty recipe.  I used just 1 packet of soup mix, 1 cup of Russian Dressing and the preserves.  Turned out really good.  Sprinkled my chicken with some garlic powder and pepper before pouring sauce over.  Served with white rice and asparagus.  I think next time I'll try in the slow cooker.

This a a great recipe, but my grandma and I use Wishbone Italian dressing instead of Russian. Whether to use Russian or Italian probably depends on how much zest you want. The apricot jam is balanced by the vinegar and herbs in Italian dressing.

I made this recipe the other night.  I did follow the suggestions from the other reviews:  Fat Free Catalina dressing and spreadable fruit (the entire jar), and  both packages of the soup.  Topped it off with sliced almonds.  We loved it.  Easy to make, lots of balanced flavor, lots of sauce that was great over rice.  This will new fast and easy meal at my house.  Thanks!

I guess I'm in the minority, but I found the "onion soup mix flavor" too recognizable.  I must admit that my kids loved it.

I made the sauce a day ahead, then poured it over the chicken in the baking dish the morning I was going to bake it. I did those steps early only because I wanted to clean up the sticky mess I knew I would have from the jam. The chicken was great. However, no boneless skinless chicken breast needs to bake for an hour at 350. Forty-five minutes was plenty and I probably could have cut the baking time to forty minutes.

I have been making the dish for 20 some years my children grew up on this and they love it.  now my grandchildren love it also, the only difference is that I use peach jam, but we have also tried raspberry jam and also very good not a sweet.

I have tried this recipe two ways, with the Wishbone Russian Dressing and with Catalina.  Russian is harder to find sometimes, but I believe it to be clearly superior for this recipe over Catalina, which I like but not for this recipe.

I made this for a date tonight and he loved it! I was really nervous about making it because, despite all the great reviews, the ingredients sound weird together. They totally work! I used fat-free Catalina dressing instead of Russian, though.

Fabulous and super easy to make! My daughter 5 loved the sauce. We made pizza the next day with the leftover sauce and chicken. (Great family project!) We used Betty Crocker pizza dough, spread on the sauce from the chicken, cut up fresh basil- tomatoes-and chicken, covered with shredded cheddar and monterey jack cheese. We cooked it at 400 for about 12 minutes on the very bottom rack. My husband also made a sandwich with the sauce and chicken. We love it and will be making it again!:)

I made this recipe incorporated with the other baked apricot chicken recipe on here that calls for french dressing instead of the russian.  I couldnt decide which one sounded better so I just did half french and half russian.  I made it with chicken thighs, but I definitely think I would like it better with the chicken breasts that this recipe states.  It had great flavor and I cant wait to try it again, but making it exactly as the recipe states with the russian dressing only.  Thanks for the recipe!

Hmm - stepkids devoured this, I really liked it, and hubby said it was "meh". If I make it again, I would cut back on the onion soup mix as it is salty and the flavor is a bit overpowering (I wanted the sauce to be sweeter). I used Wishbone "Deluxe French" dressing in place of Russian, and baked the chicken for just under 30 minutes at 400 degrees so we didn't have to wait so long to eat! (I also used boneless, skinless breasts).

Very good & very easy recipe.  My picky husband & toddler loved it!  I put it over brown rice.  Next time will put 1 T of corn starch to thicken it a little, otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

I was a little skeptical, I must admit, when I read the ingredients and some of the reviews. I was feeling adventurous though, and gave it a try. I am so glad I did! The only thing I did different was used thighs instead of breasts (what I had on hand) and used one packet of the onion soup mix rather than one and a half. Some of the best chicken ever turned out of my kitchen!!! Even my EXTREMELY picky five year old liked it. Thanks for the great recipe!

Decided to make it for a group of 14 (after not making it for 25 yrs.) I am not a chicken eater.  Everyone loved it.  After 30 minutes I took the cover off and baked it like that so the chicken would crisp up a bit.  I also take the excess skin off but leave some on it.  You can use any parts of the chicken that you like.  Very moist.

I thought this was excellent.  As suggested in another review I used fat free Kraft Catalina dressing, (because I have no idea what "Russian" style dressing is!) and sugar free Apricot preserves.  I also sprinkled the chicken with some garlic powder and black pepper.  I cooked for 40 min on 360, and it came out perfect (I only made two pieces).  The chicken was very moist and had excellent flavor.  I made it with some redskin mashed potatoes w/ rosemary, and spooned the extra sauce over the potatoes, now that was excellent!  A definite Keeper!

My grandma has made this for ages since my mom was a little girl, only she used apricot/pineapple preserves instead of plain apricot and drumsticks with the skin still on, she also cooks it longer and doesn't cover it. I've made it with boneless skinless breasts, It works better if you cut them into strips first. This is always a favorite!

This is very similar to my mother's recipe.  The only thing different is that we use chicken drummettes (small drumsticks).  We buy about 4 packages, lay them top to end in a 9 x 13 pan, and bake the heck out of them until they are almost candied. (Usually an hour, turn them over, and then another hour).  They are so good this way and irresistable to little kids.  I've also used Russian or Catalina dressing, both come out great that way.  I prefer to use apricot jam over preserves.  If for some reason yours comes out too runny, which happened to another reviewer, than either you used too much dressing (I normally use 2 regular sizes bottles of dressing), or have not cooked it long enough.

A HIT!!!! A HIT!!!! A HIT!!!! Five-stars from EVERYONE I served this to...and some of them are VERY picky!!  It's even better if you let it sit for 10-15 minutes after you take it out of the oven. The chicken was verrrrrrry tender, can cut it with a fork! Not sure what a couple reviewers meant by too sweet or too strong of onion soup taste??--we found the combo very good, and my mom doesn't like things "too sweet", and she didn't think it was too sweet at all, and she's picky about that kind of thing, and she also doesn't like "too salty", so that was not a problem, either. She was the pickiest eater and she ate every last bite--unusual for her!! I served this with simple white rice and green beans. Dad LOVED it, and he said it was even better the next day--what very little left-over was left......I admit, I myself was un-sure of the mixture, but, between the reviews here, as well as MANY local people I know that "know" this recipe--and they ALL said it was a hit, so I HAD to try this.....glad I did, this one's a keeper!!--and soooooo easy!!!  What more can you ask for??

I have been making this recipe for over 20 years and family and friends can't get enough of it!  If I can't find Russian dressing, I use Catalina and I use liptons soup and a large jar of apricot preserves for a thicker glaze.  I use 8-10 chicken thighs.  I cover with foil for 50-60 min then under the broiler for 10 min.  Wide egg noodles are amazing with this!!

This is my fiancees favorite meal that his mom makes for him so I was happy to find a good version of it on here. His mom uses homemade peach jam instead of apricot but either way it is quite tasty. Also we only make this with chicken drumsticks or thighs not breasts.

Whole family loves this. The chicken is nice and moist. The flavor is a perfect mix between sweet and tangy. I always read tons of reviews before selecting a recipie. After making this one, I was dumbfounded by some of the negative reviews I had read. Maybe people should stop rating a recipie where they substitued half the ingredients? Or maybe they don't know how to cook? One of the most delicious recipies I've tried from this site.

Perfect every time. Made it for years. I use Wish Bone Russian dressing &  I use chicken thighs & chicken legs, ( family pack) bake covered  in a large roasting pan 325 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours.  Perfect easy recipe. A crowd pleaser for sure.

The flavor is delicious. Apricot was not a favorite of ours until we tried this recipe. One caution about other reviewers' suggestions to cook in a crock pot. The first time, we did the crock pot method at low for about six hours and the chicken was way over-cooked and dry. So if using crock pot, cut down time to about 2 1/2 hours to 3 and check to ensure chicken stays moist. The second time, we did in traditional oven and I still managed to overcook the chicken. I think the reason is I don't use 6 breasts; I only use about 3 to feed just my hubby and me. So if using less chicken, cut back cooking time. Those errors are my fault, so no impact on this recipe. The flavor of the sauce on chicken and over rice is excellent! We'll definitely make it again and again! I also would serve this dish for company. Thanks, Shirley!

I had never tried Apricot Chicken before, and I really enjoyed it.

I followed some reviewer advice and used only one package of the onion soup mix, and Catalina dressing instead of the Russian. Served it over some brown rice - awesome!

I will make this again for sure.

My boyfriends' mom made this for a family dinner one night and it was delicious. I tried it tonight with just Patrick and I- I used the red Russian dressing, 3/4 jar of apricot preserves and 2 packets of onion soup mix over 2 medium sized chicken breasts and 3 turkey breast cutlets. I baked at 400 for 35 minutes- so good!! Served over brown rice. :D

Wow! What a great flavor and so easy to put together. I will definitely add this to the rotation. Even the hubby was impressed. The only thing I did differently, was I used canned apricots, not jam.

as I was making this, I thought to myself that these ingredients sound disgusting together.  fortunately, what sounded bad together was great!  i served it with rice pilaf with chopped dried apricots and don't recommend that.  the sauce is sweet enough and flavorful enough to only need plain rice (brown or white).

I've been using this recipe for years on chicken wings, the only thing I do different is I bake them for a couple hours in a foil lined pan at 300, turn them and watch them, the sauce gets carmelized and fall of the bone good, I bring them to all Christmas get-togethers in a crock pot to keep warm on a buffet table, everyone requests them

WOW! This recipe was, simply, delicious! Let me tell you all something, being a novice in kitchen affairs, this was the easiest and tastiest thing I've done thus far! Even my mom, who is a picky Latina enjoyed it!  I read some of the reviews and decided to add the minced garlic and I am glad I did. There is no doubt in my mind I will be recommending this recipe to my family and friends! thanks for posting this amazing recipe up!!

I got an extremely similar recipe from my cousin years ago an tweaked it a bit and have been getting raves on it ever since.  There's never any left overs because nobody can stop eating it.  I used to use a 16 oz bottle of thousand island.  The only difference from russian is the pickle relish but now I make my own, 1 pt ketchup, 2pts low fat mayo, lemon juice and pickle relish to taste.  When I'm making it for this recipe I put in less relish and add in 3-4 cloves of fresh crushed garlic.  For this sauce I add 12 oz of apricot preserves and 1 pkg of onion soup mix.  salt and pepper the chicken and spread the sauce over.  I like an extra kick so I pepper the breasts again.  bake at 350 till internal temp 165-175.  Don't believe in times except as an approximation.  The outside of the chicken almost tastes like candy.  I usually make enough sauce for a few batches and just refrigerate it.

Very good!  I think it could use a little more apricot and a little less Russian dressing.

Used only 1/2 bottle of russian dressing, kept everything else the same, and it had the perfect flavor. Sauce is a bit runny when you first take it out, but if you remove the cover and let it sit just a few minutes, it thickens right up! Yummy, will definitely make again!

Somthing you wouldn't normaly get in an Asian resturant, good flavor!  Suggestions to add would be water chesnuts, or green onion.  Serve with rice and snap peas.

This was very good. Family liked it. It makes a lot of sauce so recipe could accommodate more chicken breasts. "Wishbone" is the only Russian dressing I could find. My chicken cooked up in 45 mins.

I actually would rate this 4 1/2 stars, a great easy weeknight meal, but don't think I would serve to company.  I used bone in chicken breasts, and made sure to use the wishbone russian dressing, and they turned out great.

Probably won't make this again but if I did I'd change it some: 1. way too salty. use 1/2 packet of soup mix. 2. way too much sauce. Cut sauce mix in half. 3. Sauce was very thin. I'd add water/cornstarch mix & simmer to thicken.

Unbelievably FANTASTIC!!  The flavor this has is Out of this World!!  I serve this to about 20-25 people who all demand it every year on our beach trip for our dinner at the beach house night!  I have made this for several dinners and there isn't one person who hasn't raved about it - if you make it for a group - print out copies of the recipe to bring along - you'll be asked for it!!

I too have a twist on this great recipe. I either use Russian or Mix Russian and French dressing. I also put pineapple chunks on top. I also prefer to use skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts although they are both good.

If i could give this no stars i would.  What a horrific mess, I used "Allfruit" apricot thinking that would be the best and am so disappointed that i wasted all the ingrediants! Family hated it, we made sandwhiches. Dont believe the hype people! unless you like "ketchup" chicken!  Just save your self the time and money and use the ketchup instead.

I didn't like the taste of this dish.  As already stated by another reviewer, the onion flavor was rather strong.  The combination of onion and apricot, the two strongest flavors, was kind of bizarre.  In all the dish didn't taste bad, it just wasn't very good.  I wouldn't make it again.

This was better than I expected.  The onion soup cuts the sweetness of the salad dressing and preserves.  I served with rice pilaf and a salad for a dinner with friends.  The only change I would make next time is to run the soup mix through a sifter to keep the onion chunks out.

I love this recipe, especially since I can ammend it in so many ways if I don't have the bottle of dressing.  Sometimes I used the Chilled Russian dressing recipe here on Allrecipes.com.  Over rice, it couldn't be a simpler meal, but you'd be surprised (as the popularity proves) how wonderful it turns out.

Great recipe - don't change a thing!  I converted the recipe for 20 to serve at our monthly dinner group.  There were no leftovers.  I served it with a rice pilaf with sauteed pine nuts - it was a big hit.

Delicious! Easy and impressive enough for company.  During the holidays, I used turkey breasts and a can of whole cranberry sauce instead.  It was equally delicious.

This was great tasting chicken.  I cut the chicken breast in half so they weren't so big.  I tasted the sauce before I put it on the chicken and it did taste a little bland, so I add some Worchestershire to it, plus I used both Russian and Catalina Dressing. That seem to do the trick.  I'm going to keep this one.

This has great flavor!  Made it in my crock pot on low setting for 3.5 hrs, sauce came out wonderful, not at all soupy, but chicken came out slightly dry, so will cut down on cooking time next time.  Great over rice or by itself.  Thanks Shirley!

I love this recipe!  I make it all the time.  Sometimes I substitute Apricot-Pineapple preserves, and it turns just as good.  You can substitute cranberry suace for the apricot preserves, and its also great.  This recipe is fantastic!!

My husband went nuts over this one. I served it with couscous (Near East Herbed Chicken couscous to be exact), added some frozen peas to the couscous and it was a quick and tasty meal. The sauce went well on the couscous.

First let me tell you that I have a picky eater and that if i told him it had Apricot anything he would have freaked out. I said it was a healthy version of sweet and sour chicken.  We did not have any leftovers. I served with white rice and broccoli. If you want to spice it up use some red pepper flakes after it cooks. Enjoy!!

I've made this recipe for at least 40 years.  Haven't made it in a while and forgot how delicious it is. It was a welcome change and the hubby loved it!!

Love this recipe. I usually just guessimate on the apricot preserves and put a little less than the recipe. It tastes great on rice!

This is one of our all time favorite recipes.  I cut my chicken into small bite size pieces instead of eat it as a whole breast half.  LOVE IT!!!

This is a fantastic recipe. My only suggestion is to use a single use aluminum baking pan as it is a chore to clean up. The recipe is delicious and I prepared fresh green beans and new potatoes with it.

A definite crowd pleaser, and so easy to make .  My kids ask for this often.  The sauce goes well when poured over rice or other veggies!

I didn't have enough apricot preserves so in it's place I used the same amount of some apple chutney, and the rest of the recipe was the same. Turned out really good. I served it over brown rice. Would definitely make it again.

I modified a bit, it made lots of sauce so I saved some and used later. I used skinless thighs, only one onion soup mix and red Russian dressing only 8 oz. baked for 1&1/2 hours covered, then flipped them, put back in oven 30+minutes. This is the only way I can tolerate chicken thighs!

SO easy and amazing! Like another reviewer said I just use the small bottle of Russian (I think it's 8oz)and its perfect. It does come out abit runny which it would be nice if the sauce stayed thicker. Maybe some day I will try to mix in cornstarch or flour and see what happens :)

A long time family favorite! I have 5 kids which means there are often extra bodies at meal time. I have yet to find a kid who doesn't love this chicken. It is a great starter recipe for kids as they begin cooking as well.

Taste is incredible-my husband REALLY enjoyed it!!!
Except: (1) Dry the meat off-& use thighs, legs & wings   
        (2) Bake chicken for 45-60 minutes at 325^, take out & 
drain off fat & juices, then pour jam mixture over chicken,
pop back in the oven for 30 minutes -- I use apricot-pineapple freezer jam, & added a 14 oz. can of apricot halves. The flavor 
is so incredible! Otherwise it gets way too oily, watery 
& looses fruit flavor....

I have been using this exact recipe for years, but with chicken thighs, legs, and breasts.  I always make a lot because it goes fast and it's great the following day. When I first heard what was in it I thought it sounded disgusting, but I had already eaten it, and it was delicious! So if you haven't tried it yet, or are skeptical because of the ingredients, don't be. I still get requests to make it after all these years.

Since it is boneless chicken breast, the flavor depends on the sauce or spices. To me, the sauce wasn't good enough to desire the dish again.

This is now a family favorite.  Made exactly as directed, just bulked it up for my big family.  Served with rice and poured drippings over rice.  Even my picky kids that won't eat chicken breast because they say its to dry, loved this dish.  Will make again.  May try different preserves for a twist.

I was just browsing around on here and I found this recipe and decided to try it. Instead of using the Russian-style dressing because I could not find it, I used Kraft's Creamy French dressing. It works great! I love this served over rice!

This chicken was awesome and so fast and easy to make. I used the Catalina dressing because I couldn't find the Russian and it was great! My daughter made it with Russian and said she preferred mine over hers. This is definitely a keeper!

This was really good.  My husband and kids all liked it.  I did however use what I had, which was Catalina, and mando jelly.  I added fresh crushed garlic like someone else mentioned.  We thought this sauce would be good on pork too!  Thanks.....

This is a very delicious chicken recipe! Love how easy it is to make and how much of a hit that it is with my friends!  The only comment I have is that sometimes, if your chicken pieces are smaller, you do not need to bake it for so long. Keep an eye on your chicken and don't overcook!

I love this recipe. I used already cooked frozen breaded all white meat chicken cutlet halves about 5, toasted them first and then cut the chicken into little pieces combined the mixed ingredients(Russian Dressing, 1 package of dry onion soup mix, 1 cut of Apricot preserves) with the chicken and Rigatoni and let it cook for a bit on top of the stove. Very easy and everyon loved. Thank You.

I turned this into a stir fry by cubing the chicken and  frying it with olive oil and minced garlic.  Then I added the sauce, red and green peppers, and sliced red onions.  I think it would also be good with cubed pineapple.

This recipe is very similar to the one I have and love.  The difference is using thousand island dressing instead of russian dressing.  This recipe is easy to throw together and can be served directly from the oven to table.  I have served this dish for many years and it has been a favorite by my family and many friends.

Excellent.  Couldn't find Russian dressing so I used Catalina instead.  It was outstanding and so easy to make.

my whole family loves this one.... serve with rice.  Use extra sause to pour over rice.  Nice lunch left overs, as my co-workers love the smell.

I don't like onions so I think that's why this recipe just doesn't agree with me. I thought using the soup mix would be ok but I just ate it and feel nauseous. Hubby likes onions but he didn't care for this either. I used the catalina fat-free dressing and sugar free apricot preserves like one of the reviewers suggested.

I have been looking for this recipe for years. I was so tickled when I found it here. But when I made it, the sauce was to thin for my liking.  Even the next day the sauce was still thin. I think next time I will cook it uncovered or add a little cornstarch to it. I added a little bit of crushed peppers to it to give it a little kick. I gave it four stars. If the sauce had been thicker it would been a five star dish.

I made this yesterday to take to a friend who is recovering from surgery. We all really enjoyed it. I did add garlic, some sliced onions and red pepper flakes and cooked it in an electric frying pan after I browned the chicken breasts. Great recipe - thanks. I won't go on my monthly rotation, too many calories, but I'll remember it for pot lucks, company etc.

Who knew that these ingredients together could make a tasty dish?  I couldn't find Russian dressing, so I used Thousand Island, which I beleive is the same thing.  Also, I only used 3 very LARGE boneless, skinless breasts and a single envelope of the onion soup mix.  It was a good dinner and I served the chicken over some egg noodles along with some broccoli.  We will definitely be doing this one again.

I don't know how healthy this recipe is, but it was delicious and so, so simple. I used a whole cut up chicken, skinned, instead of chicken breasts. I just mixed the whole thing up in a pyrex bowl, put it in the oven, and stirred occasionally. I served it with the sauce as gravy over wild rice, and it was a tasty delight.

Made this last night and my family said to keep in rotation.  It was sweet but they liked it.  Suggestions from them include, water chestnuts, mushroom, red peppers, onion, nuts.  I made asparagus separate and they wanted to know why I just didn't throw it in!  Had a loaf of bread w/it.  Maybe I'll buy quick frozen ragoons or something else to eat w/it to cut the sweet.  Very simple to make.  Will also try crockpot next time.

What a mess...My family ate it and we all laughed because this recipe is what they call "white trash Chinese food". No, I will not make it again. It was like candy. The chicken is very moist but for the amount of calories I would rather have fried chicken any day.

The sauce is very tasty but it didn't  soak into the chicken and flavor it as much as I'd have liked. Next time I might try pounding or cutting the chicken thin to get more flavor. Im sure I will make it again someday.

I first tasted this many years ago, while my daughter was in pre school. Her teacher made it for a class party, using mini drumsticks, and everyone loved it, both kids and adults. However, it is a little too sweet for my taste to serve as an entree; just a few bites satisfies me. So I sometimes serve it as an appetizer at parties, using  small chunks of chicken simmered in the sauce, and it is always a hit!

It is good and I  make this often.  The longer you allow it to cool the thicker the sauce becomes.  Another option to this recipe is to pan sear the chicken before baking. This step while a bit more work helps seal in those juices, also cutting the pieces up a bit helps to create more surface area for the sauce to cling to.  All in all a good staple week night dish.

Unbelievably easy to make.  The recipe says 30 minutes of prep, I had finished the dressing by the time the oven was preheated.  Will probably cut cook time to 40 minutes next time, as chicken was a little dry.

This was almost like sweet and sour chicken to me.  It was so fast and good, I will definately be making it again.  I made the sauce and poured it over the chicken before I went to work in the morning, and then pulled it out of the fridge and popped it into the oven when I got home.  It was so good and easy, and it really was moist because I had let it marinate in the sauce all day.

I bake a whole chicken and use this a a basting sauce, adding 1/2 c. melted butter to the mixture. I've made this several times and always get fabulous reviews. It makes a delicious, juicy, flavorful chicken.

Tasted excellent, even better after resting for 15 minutes after cooking when sauce has gelled.  I also put it in the crockpot and it's delicious! Toddlers loved it.  Great with rice or potatoes!

My husband really liked this recipe, although I didn't care a lot for it. My preferences simply don't appreciate the sweetness and combination of Russian salad dressing with apricots and onion soup mix. Although the chicken itself came out great -- juicy and moist. I marinated it for several hours in the sauce mix (added a dash of Worsteshire and red pepper flakes), then stuck it in the oven for about 45-50 minutes. I served it with the Awesome Broccoli-Cheese Casserole from this site.  Unless my husband asks for it, I won't make this recipe again.

As suggested by other reviewers, I used Catalina dressing.  I thought this was yummy and perfect for a weeknight meal.  So easy and quick to prepare.  I did not think it was too sweet.

Made it twice now for "pot luck" dinners.  Both times I had people asking for my recipe.  

Two things:  
1.  Serve with white rice.  This is too rich without some starch to "cut" it.
2.  Pound the chicken to make it tender before cooking.  

I have also pre-seared the chicken on a George Foreman grill.  This makes the chicken more tender and flavorful.

Based on the other reviews, people either loved this recipe or found it too sweet.  We liked it!  The sauce reminded us of an apricot chutney.  This sauce would be good over pork chops too.  Three ingredients plus chicken...you can't ask for a much easier recipe!

My boyfriend and I both love this chicken... we tried it for the first time last summer and weren't sure how good it was going to taste, given the unusual combination of ingredients, but it turned out great.  This can also be made in a slow cooker, but we found that it tasted better baked.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was a little nervous about trying this, because I was having people over for dinner, but I am very glad I took a chance.  I marinated the chicken in the sauce for about 2 hours before cooking, and the chicken turned out very moist.  The sauce was very flavourful, and the colour made for a pretty presentation.  Everyone loved it.

This was delicious! I simmered dried apricots until they were soft (5 min) and put them on top before baking the dish. I also added crushed red peppers and a little white wine.

This was extremely easy to make and the chicken turned out good. I ate all of my chicken on my plate and I'm a picky eater. I think it would have been even better to me if it were spicier. I will add crushed red peper flakes next time. It's missing something and I don't know if it is only the spiciness or what. I might try Russian or French with the crushed red peppers. Really good over rice.

The ratings in my family went from **(my eleven year old) to *****(my twenty year old).  I personally would have given it three stars.  I don't think I'll make it again.  It's not a bad recipe, just a matter of taste.  It was certainly easy...definitely five stars for ease of preparation!

This was a great recipe.  I made it with chicken wings in a crockpot for a party we were attending.  They were a big hit!  They were tender and very tasty.  I had catalina dressing, instead of russian and it was fine.

Husband rated a 5 1/2.  He said, Best yet! Kids didn't care for it, though. Made my own dressing, too, with Mayo, Ketchup, and Worchestershire Sauce.  Leftovers were even better the next night!
A keeper for sure.  Thanks, Nannie

I modified this recipe and used what I had on hand which was Catalina dressing and orange marmalade. Did add a dash of Worchestershire sauce as someone suggested. Turned out great (served with rice) and I am sure tasted almost as the recipe intended with the apricot jam.  My only suggestion would be to quickly sear the chicken in a skillet before putting it into the mixture for baking.

We loved it!!  So fast & simple!  I added 2 tbsps. of Worchestershire sauce to taste...didn't change anything else.  We put some of the sauce over brown rice on the side & it was wonderful.  My fiance says this one's a "keeper"!

This was a fabulous recipe!   We loved the flavor of the sauce, and how moist the chicken was.  I will make this again and again.  This is my kind of dish....less than 5 ingredients, quick & easy preparation, and delicios!

These flavors blend together wonderfully!  And it's such an EASY recipe.  I put it all in the crockpot on high for a couple hours and it turned out fine, yet the sauce was a little soupy.  Next time I will try the oven method and uncover in the last 15-20 minutes.  Maybe this will turn the sauce into more of a glaze.

The chicken came out nice and moist baked this way. I halved the recipe and used lipton soap mix and the wishbone dressing. My boyfriend enjoyed the taste more than I did, but it was a quick and easy dinner. I would make it again!

Now I know I followed this recipe to a 'T', after all there is not much to screw up.  This had to be the worst meal I've ever made.  My fiance would not touch the sauce, we threw the left-overs out in a ziplock bag, and we held our noses as we washed the dishes.  Leave the Russian dressing for Turkey Rubens.  Disgusting.

I didnt expect much from this one with so few ingrediants.  But boy was I wrong!  I put it all into my slow cooker for 5-7 hours on low and served over egg noodles.  My family loved it. Cant wait to make it again. Thanks.

I use this sauce mix for pork loin.  I mix an extra large batch of the sauce and pour over a pork loin to be slow cooked in a roaster or moderate oven.  After the pork is cooked, I pull it out, slice it and make another smaller batch of sauce (simmered on the stove) to pour over as a glaze on the serving platter.  (The sauce that it was cooked in is usually too greasy to use for serving.)  I have rave reviews every time.  I have also cooked the pork until it fell apart and then completely shredded it for a type of BBQ pork sandwiches.  I usually add additional bottled BBQ sauce to the final product with this recipe.  Hope everyone enjoys!

Such great flavor!  I will definitely make this again, but this time I won't count on my husband to take the chicken out of the oven (he left it in too long and it was a little dry) But that's our fault!  The flavor was TERRIFIC! Will definitely make again!

What an awesome recipe! I used a variation of William's Russian Salad Dressing from this site (added Worcestershire sauce, no vinegar, maybe not exact proportions of all ingredients). Fast, easy, very tasty. An unusual combination that makes you look forward to leftovers.

My husband (who loves sweet and sour chicken) loved this.  He thought it was almost as good as his favorite s&s chicken from our favorite Chinese restaurant without the fat from frying.  Will definately make again!

Great chicken recipe that didn't dry out! I ate it cold for lunch a few days later, and it still tasted good. I sprinkled some sesame seeds on the chicken before baking to make it look a bit nicer, and the whole family loved it.

This is a great base recipe.. I added some garlic and some salt to counteract the sweetness of the other ingredients.  I also cooked it about 20 minutes longer uncovered to thicken up the sauce which worked like a charm.  Overall, this is a tasty and super easy recipe.

WOW, this was my very first receipe from this website.  I chose it because if had a great rating and sounded like a yummy recipe.  It turned out to be a great hit with my entire family.  My husband, three year old son, 20 month old daughter, and I devoured the delicious chicken.  It is definitely one that I will prepare over and over..... As for preparation time, it couldn't have been easier!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I look forward to trying more!

I've been making this since the early 70's and my grandchildren love it as much as my kids did. I usually use mixed chicken pieces. Serve it with rice which is great covered with the yummy sauce.

This got such good reviews, and it was so easy to make; I was so hopeful.  It didn't taste bad, but it had a very bland apricot-y taste.  Moist, but kind of blah.  And very gross looking.  Won't make this again.

I couldn't find Russian dressing in our groceries so I used Thousand Island and added some ketchup for more tomato flavor.  If anyone has any other suggestions for substitutes for the Russian dressing, let me know!

I placed the chicken in a cooking bag instead of covered roaster.  It was great. Plenty of sauce! The flavor combination is does not sound that good but it made a great meal.

my kids are just TOO picky.  But I remember my mother making this dish with chicken parts & they'd get all gloppy & tasty.  Have to lick your fingers after.  I personally like this for legs & wings.

When I was living with my daughter and her husband so I could watch my new grandson, my daughter made this over rice. It was sooooo good  I could t wait to make it for my family  back home which is two hours away. They loved it too. I make it in the crock pot and use boneless chicken thighs! This is a whole family favorite!!!

Have always liked it.  Some people call this "Sticky Chicken"... and make it with currant jam, or french dressing. ... depending on what's on hand.  They all taste pretty great.

My Nanny used to make this when I was younger. I can't imagine using 1/2 a packet of something, so I just used 1 like I remember her doing. I also didn't bake it for an hour. PLEASE don't bake it for an hour. That is way too long! I think I did about half an hour and that was plenty! This also works well in a slow cooker!

The recipe called for covering the dish before baking.  I covered the dish and the end result was my chicken breasts floating in a sea of very liquid sauce.  This may have happened for 2 reasons.  I used frozen chicken breasts which were about 1/2 thawed out and the recipe said to cover the dish while baking.  I may try this recipe again using regular chicken breasts and I will not cover the pan.   The partially frozen chicken breasts and the pan being covered during baking resulted in too much liquid.  So disappointed!

I LOVE this recipe,, I have made it numerous times and it is a favorite in our house.  I make egg noodles and dump it all in with the sauce and chicken.  Mmmmm.  I like to use chicken breast tenderloins now but sometimes still use thin sliced chicken breast.  The meat is more moist using them.  
The first time I made it I was unsure as I don't like apricots or Russian dressing but I loved it all together.  You can also use the sugar free apricot preserves and it still tastes the same.  No one can tell here.  Try it!

This was not to my liking, or my families. We followed the recipe to the letter using a mixture of the boneless breast and boneless/skinless chicken thighs. A lot of fat and calories, for not a lot of taste. I basted the chicken twice during the cooking process to develop a nice carmelized glaze on top. We just thought it lacked flavor.

My husband and I love this recipe!  So easy and so delicious every time.  I have made it using chicken breasts and yesterday made it with chicken thighs.  Going to try it on chicken wings for super bowl Sunday party.  House smells heavenly when this is baking.  I serve with parmesan angel hair pasta.  Great pairing!  Thank you "All Recipies".

I made as directed. The only thing different was it doesn't take 30 minutes to prepare 3 ingredient's unless I skipped a step. The cook time varies depending on your oven. I always had a problem with under and over cooked until I got my handy dandy meat thermometer.  If you have one use it if not get one.  It makes life sooooo much easier.

I have made this several times. I usually cut the chicken into one inch chunks, and add about 2 cups of rice, and about a cup of water, and let it bake altogether.

I've made this for years and it is always popular with my husband and kids.  I use chicken tenders because they are smaller and cook faster.  I also make it in a skillet on the stove and let the chicken simmer in the sauce until it is done (about half an hour if using the tenders).  I only use half the bottle of Wishbone Russian dressing, 1 pouch of Lipton Onion Soup mix, and 1 jar of Smucker's Apricot-Pinapple Preserves and have plenty of sauce for the chicken and rice.

I have made this several times now and we love it! I use Catalina dressing and let it sit in the refrigerator all day - it melts in your mouth and my husband swears it's the best chicken he has ever tasted. It is so easy and even my picky grandson loves it!

I made the recipe according to the directions, and it turned out pretty bland. I don't know if it was the brand of Russian dressing I used (Kroger brand), but I think I may look for a different recipe for this dish in the future. I couldn't taste the apricot at all!

We make this recipe every year for the holidays.  Recommend bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts.  We put the sauce under the skin as well as over the entire breast.  We also like using the Catalina dressing.

Okay, I have to admit that the list of ingredients had me worried.  I would never have thought to combine onion soup mix with apricot preserves...and then add French dressing too?  Wow, though...this dish came out fantastic!  It is now in my top 10 favorites.  Thank you!!!

Excellent! Used 5 chicken breasts that I cleaned, butterflied, and pounded (not too thin). I also used 1c of fat free Catalina style dressing, 1c of Saucy Susan(apricot/peach galze/dipping sauce), and the onion soup mix. I prepared this in the morning and basically marinated the chicken in this mixture before baking. Sweet, sticky and delicious! Family inhaled this...will make again! Thanks!

Quick and easy, and undoubtedly will appeal to many palates.   It's too sweet for my taste, but if you're making a dish with a cup of apricot preserves in it, you're probably looking for sweet.    It is reminiscent of sweet and sour chicken, with the onion soup mix adding savory to the mix.    I suspect it would work better in a crockpot, or perhaps not baked for 60 minutes.   The chicken came out pretty dry for me.   I would also consider using a juice sweetened 100% fruit spread, and perhaps less of it, in order to cut down on the sweetness.

I tried this recipe in the crockpot and the chicken was dry - would have been better with chicken thighs. Also because of the bottled dressing the sauce was very oily (although it tasted good).  I'll give this recipe a try in the oven next time since there are so many rave reviews.

I made my own Russian dressing with ketchup, mayo and a spritz of lemon juice. Used this topping on whole pieces of chicken. It was good, but I found that it overly drowned the chicken flavor. I'm looking for something a bit more subtle.

Easy chicken recipe.  I couldn't find Russian-style dressing and used Catalina dressing as another reviewer suggested.  I also ran out of apricot jam and ended up supplementing what I had with raspberry jam.  I served it with rice...the sauce was very good over the rice.

My expectation was that this would taste more like apricot than any of the other ingredients but I didn't taste the apricot at all.  Also, the chicken didn't get tender from the marinade.  It either needs a stronger acid or may have to sit a lot longer than recommended.

I have to review this because it was an excellent meal to bring camping! The taste was very good, not great, but the ease of preparation was fantastic and my chicken was so tender! We had a camping weekend and I brought my par-cooked chicken (marinating in the sauce) with us. I used my electric fry pan and viola I had an instant main dish with little hassle and little cook time. I used French dressing (only thing I had on hand) and I added a little Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic (just a few shakes). I served over Jasmati rice with asparagus and string beans...It was the perfect camping meal I will be making this again and again...thanks for sharing.

I love making this chicken. I've made it multiple times and it's always a hit. I made the recipe just like the recipe suggests except at the end, I would say the last 10 mins of cooking I spoon out a little extra apricot preserves onto the chicken and it tastes great! Love it.

this is so good on asian rice with snow peas on the side.  i've served it to about 8 different people who all enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.  however, i did once made the mistake of using bone-in chicken... that was gross.

My mom used to make something like this when I was growing up and I loved it, so I had a lot of hope for this recipe.  The onion soup was way too overpowering, but the chicken was juicy and I didn't mind the sweetness.  I'm planning on making it again but I'll omit the onion soup and add some pepper flakes and minced garlic to give it a little kick.

This is soooo good, and I serve it often, but I didn't have apricot preserves this time and used orange marmalade.  Everyobody raved about it.

Tasty and simple! My boyfriend loved it and thinks I'm an amazing cook now. 

I followed the advice of another review and used Catalina dressing. I was nervous about the idea of onion soup mix because I don't like onion all that much so I used onion-mushroom soup mix instead. Someone also said to add minced garlic, but I was lazy and just added a dash of garlic powder, probably not enough to make a difference. I'll mince garlic next time. 

Boyfriend is on a high protein diet now, so I served this with white rice quickly fried up with minced garlic (got less lazy) and eggs. 
Yum!

Quite a delicious dish. I cut it in half since we are a small family but there is still plenty of sauce to go around and I don't think the flavor as compromised. We served it on rice.

I thought this tasted way too processed tasting and way too salty when I first made it.  The next day I used the leftovers cut up in spinach, tomato and pepper jack cheese wraps and that was delicious, so I am giving it 3 stars.  I wouldn't rave about it, but I would tweak it (use more fresh ingredients when baking) and try it again.

I love this recipe; it's one I've been making for years.  I think I enjoy the sauce with rice at least as much as I do the chicken itself.  Great for kids.  This recipe works well in a slow cooker as well.  Also, I find that chicken thighs are juicier and more flavorful.

This was a hit in my house even my daughter who usually doesn't eat meat liked it.  She asked to have it for dinner the next night also.   I used an 8oz bottle of Russian Dressing because that was all I found, only 1 packet of onion soup and the 10 oz of apricot preserves.  I also used about 8 chicken breasts and still had a lot of gravy.  I only baked it for 45 minutes and it was nice and tender. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe.

We call this "kid's proof chicken" I usually make it using drumsticks/thighs, or whatever's on sale. It is so quick and easy to make, put rice in the rice cooker and within 10 minutes you have dinner cooking. I make it for family fun night at our church, I never have leftover's.

Delicious. I'd had something similar before, so I kind of knew what to expect, perhaps that accounts for the negative reviews. I used sugar-free preserves and it was not too sweet at all. I also basted the chicken a few times during the bake time. Great over brown rice.

My mother used to make this dish for me when I was in college and came home for the weekend.  Now that I have a family of my own, I make it for them and for get togethers.  Everyone loves it and always wants the recipe.  I love it because I can put it together in about 5 mins and stick it in the oven while I give the kids a bath, work out, or just have some time to sit down.  I usually make this with boiled new potatoes and pour some of the leftover cooked sauce over my potatoes. Mmmm... mmmmm!

4.5 for sure.  Easy and tasty.  Lots of sauce leftover though.  I may cut it in half but you definitely have enough to pour over rice.  I also served with sweet potatoes...figured I would go with the sweet menu

this is so fast to prepare (it is more like 3 minutes), and can be frozen - I thaw it out in my oven with it programed to turn on an hour before we get home from work and dinner is ready as soon as the rice is cooked - yummmm, my 5 year old son LOVES it served with rice.

This was a great quick and easy recipe for a weeknight! I made turkey meatballs and poured the sauce over top and baked it in the oven. It was sooo good!! I found that one and a half packet of soup mix was a little too salty, so I will only use one next time. I also added sliced onions for more texture and flavour. I really enjoyed this recipe and it made lots of sauce!

This was good; it reminded me of sweet & sour chicken. I didn't have onion soup mix, so I used Leek soup mix by Knorr. It added a mild onion flavor. Used Kraft Russian. Also, I didn't have time to cook the day I put it together, so it marinaded overnight. I don't know if that enhanced it or not...I just know it was yummy. Served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli. May try the Sugar-Free or ALL-fruit next time to be healthier.

Very tasty.  I have no idea what Russian salad dressing is, nor could I find it, so I followed other reviewers' advice and used Light Catalina.  I also used homemade onion soup mix (avoiding the MSG).  I cut the chicken into chunks and stirred it into the sauce for baking.  Served it with brown rice.  It was a little too sweet, but delicious nonetheless.

Delicious!! I used Catalina dressing instead, and although had only 2 chicken breasts I made sauce for 4 (so I could use 1 whole packet of soup mix) so we could have the sauce over rice. A bit sweet for my husband but he liked it and went back for more. Cooked for 45 minutes and chicken was over 180 deg. I'll watch more carefully next time, otherwise yummy!!

I would have given this 2.5 stars if I could.  The flavor was ok, but the sauce came out sooooo soupy.  It did not look like the picture at all, it was very very thin.  I don't know what went wrong, but it did not look very appetizing, and wasn't a nice thick sauce.  Not too good.

This dish was very easy to prepare and quite tasty.  The chicken was tender and it had a hint of the orient in it's flavor.

I made this on a tin foil lined baking sheet.  Cooked it covered for the hour and then took off the foil and let the sauce thicken. We donn't like things to wet & soupy. Came out great but was even better served the next day!

This was good the chicken itself I'd give a 3 but the sauce I'd give a 5 so here is a 4. Maybe letting it marinate for a while would help it's so easy took me 5 min to get it into the oven and definatly reduce cooking time mine took 30 min. Sauce was great on rice too.

I expected this recipe to be far better than it was. It had a really strong flavor and I could barley eat it. If I made it again which I probably will not, i would omit the onion soup mix.

Thisi s a great recipe. It has been a staple of my family for a long time. I sometimes add a bit of orange juice or pear juice to the sauce. It is gooey and kids really love it it.

VERY easy and simple - my mother has a similar recipe which adds 1/2 cup water to the soup/jam/dressing mixture and calls for marinating the chicken for a few hours before cooking.  Either way, this is a good recipe when you want something quick and easy to prepare.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good! Subbed a 16 oz bottle of French dressing for Russian. Used only one package of onion soup mix. Placed chicken breasts in slow cooker and poured mixture over. Served over white rice.

Okayish.

The jam and salad dressing formed a nice sweet and sour sauce, but the soup mix gave it that dour, condensed taste.  Next time I'll try it with my own blend of spices

I have the same recipe, but to cut the sweetness and fat I use fruit juice sweetened apricot preserves and fat free or low fat Catalina, French or Russian Dressing. I never use full fat dressing. I also use chicken breasts and I let the chicken  marinate in sauce for 4 hours before I bake it. I baste the chicken every 15 minutes while baking and add a little water if needed. I always serve with brown or basmati rice.

This is a keeper.  Could not believe how easy!  Wasn't overly sweet.  Had a nice tang to it.  My BF who doesn't really like chicken unless it's breaded and deep fried really loved this!  I used precut chicken legs and with the quanities for the sauce I wound up with a lot of extra sauce.  Also sauce was more liquidy that I expected.  Spooned the sauce from the bottom of the casserole dish several times during baking.  Next time I'll use less overall and change the mixure a bit, or just use more chicken...  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was completely not to my taste.  I found the sauce quite unappetising.  I gave it two stars however, because it was very easy to make and the chicken itself was quite moist.  The sauce, however, was too tangy for my liking.

Tasty!  I made this with chicken leg quarters with skin removed--we don't like white meat here.  Definitely making this again, but I think I'll use a fat-free dressing next time--the extra oil was just overkill.  It's great to get a lot of flavor from just 3 ingredients!

Frankly, I thought "...salad dressing? Ick." I tried it, though, because my husband adores apricot chicken, but I find the jam/juice doesn't meld completely with the onion mix. I always end up with two distinct flavors. This solved that problem, however. It was sort of a "missing link" for me in a lacking recipe. Who would've thought? Salad dressing! Thanks, Shirley!

A very quick and easy dish that even I didn't screw up (which is pretty amazing). I substituted the Russian with French dressing and used guava jam instead of Apricot jam.

This was ok, but I am agreement with the others as far as the over use of the onion soup(even though I used less than was recommended) and that this came out a little too dry for my liking.  Next time I will adjust the recipe by adding less salad dressing and onion soup, and more Apricot.  Over all this recipe can be a keeper with a little tweaking.

DELIGHTFUL!  DELICIOUS!  I served this at a dinner party and I have been getting non-stop requests for the recipe since.  If you make this... you might as well write out the recipe a few times to give to all who will ask for it.  It is an unusual combination of ingredients but surprisingly marvelous!

Great Quick recipe...My husband and daughter enjoyed it.  Outward appearance not the best but it smells great.. I used real fruit apricot spread instead of preserves and it tasted fine.

Never heard of russian style salad dressing- must be an american thing. Cant get it where i am so i subsituted it for apricot nector and used garlic and diced onion instead of soup mix. Also added a few vegies - diced potato and carrot as it wasnt filling enough on its own.  vERY DELICIOUS

This was the most surprising recipe!  I looked at the ingredients and was hesitant, but had everything in the house and went for it.  Smelled wonderful while cooking.  I used thinner chops so I baked them only for 45 min.  Perfect.  Even my husband who always scrapes off sauce loved it-will definately try on chicken.

I thought this recipe was just ok, but my husband loved it.  It was very easy and quick to make, but I too had a hard time finding Russian dressing.  Also, I only cooked the chicken for 40 minuets (at 375 degrees) and it was plenty.

This dish was excellent, and I have to admit I was a little skeptical when I read the ingredients.  Very fast and easy to make, a great weekday recipe.  My 21 month old loved it to.  The chicken was soo moist and I only baked it for 45 minutes. Thanks! I will make this again.

Wow. I was skeptical when I saw the ingredients, but this is a wonderful chicken dish! I used reduced-fat dressing and it still tasted great. Good low-fat recipe. I recommend spooning on the sauce sparingly -- I ended up with a lot of it and it has a very strong flavor. Good, but strong. Great weekday recipe -- can't beat it for quickness. My husband loved it.

Okay flavor, but sauce was much too watery once cooked.  Could have used a tickener, like flour, before serving.

This sounded interesting and different- but it tastes really good. Instead of Russian style dressing I used Western and it turned out just as great. Tonight I'm trying this with pork...I'm sure it will turn out just as perfect! Thanks!

Yummy and easy.  Good for split breasts too.  DEVHATH:  Try substituting French dressing.  It's just as good, easy to find, and it's how my friend makes this recipe.

This recipe was delicious and tastes even better when you have it for leftovers.  My fiance really liked the contrast of the flavors.  The best thing about this recipe had to be the five minutes that it took me to prepare it!!!
