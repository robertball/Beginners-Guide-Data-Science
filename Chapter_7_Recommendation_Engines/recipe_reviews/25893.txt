I've made this numerous times. My husband loves it. I've always steamed fresh carrots instead of frozen. Have also used crushed Ritz crackers, regular crackers and shredded wheat. Never had the cornflakes. The Ritz crackers are the best. Only added the salt once. Doesn't need it. Used fat free milk, mayo and margarine. Still great!

This recipe is good, but I'll make it differently next time.  In my opinion, the recipe calls for too much mayonnaise.  Next time, I'll use half the amount.  I used fresh baby carrots.  I crumbled more topping on than the recipe called for, and less butter. The topping was really good.  I know I'll love this dish the next time around, when it's not so "thick" with mayonnaise.  (One other note:  The recipe indicates to pour the sauce over the carrots. I would recommend mixing it all together before putting it in your baking dish.  It doesn't pour well.)

Delicious recipe! However, don't do as one reviewer suggested and cut down on the mayo. The sauce made "as is" was perfectly pourable...just right. I did add the horseradish "to taste" as I made the sauce to please my husband's palate. It was a winner.

We used fresh baby carrots that we boiled for 4 minutes, then proceeded with the recipe. I loved it (and I don't usually like recipes with horseradish). But, my husband said it was "just okay." Even though I only gave it four stars, I will probably make this again.

I scaled this down to 2 servings, because I wanted to taste it before serving to the pickies.  I thought it was really good.  I did cut the mayo a bit, but it still had a nice tang.  Will make again with fish.  Thanks Doreen!

This was excellent! I loved it, my husband REALLY loved it and even my son loved it! Then I took the leftovers that night out to my Aunt and Grandfather and they loved it! I used just sliced frozen carrots and they did need to cook about 15 minutes longer to get warm all the way through. Other than that it was excellent! Thanks!

This recipe is really delicious. I really enjoyed it, though the people that don't like horseradish or mayonaise did not. More for me!

I really liked the flavor of this!  The second time I made it, I did make a few adjustments.  Used milk instead of cream, cut down the mayo and butter by half and used crushed saltine crackers.  I also used fresh carrots that I partially steamed before baking so it wouldn't take quite so long for them to cook through.

This is a tradition in our family!  The horsradish isn't overwhelming and a much tastier alternative to boring baked, boiled or steamed carrots.  I always use bread crumbs instead of the corn flakes.

I liked this recipe b/c carrots are something I never know what to do with to make them different.  I like spicy food, so the amount of horseradish was almost not enough for me, I will try extra next time.  I chopped fresh carrots and cooked about 20 minutes, they needed either a longer cooking time or to be steamed halfway or so first.  I did not have cornflakes so I used breadcrumbs, I think potato chips would be good to try.  Also, I did not have light cream so I used 1/4 cup heavy cream and a 1/4 cup milk.

Very yummy you need to soften the carrots before you put in the oven otherwise it takes forever.

Was good, but nothing special.  I'm not a huge horseradish fan, but the flavor was not too strong.  I will probably keep looking for a good carrot recipe.

Loved it. So did the kids. I had a lot of left over frozen veggies in separate bags that I dumped altogether and it turned out super. I used Ritz crackers too.

Very pleasing.  I use fresh veggies rather than frozen... all I do is steam/blanche them for about 5 to 7 minutes and then continue with the recipe.  My 2 year old loved this recipe!

I have read this recipe again and again and have been so intrigued.  I love carrots and think they don't get the attention they deserve.  Finally made the recipe and all three of us really, really liked it.  So different and a fresh new way to get our carrots. I used fresh carrots rather than frozen. Had some of the horseradish mixture left over and used it on roast beef a couple days later!

I made these for Christmas dinner but I added some parsnips and steamed everything before assembling. I like my carrots to still be tendercrisp so I only steamed them for about 10-15 mins. I would add more horseradish as I am a fan but my BF mum is not so much and this dish was perfect for her. I didn't have cornflakes so I used some whole-wheat crackers that I ground in my food processor for the topping and it worked great. 3 stars as is but with more horseradish I would rate this 4 stars.

I really liked the flavor of the carrots, but the sauce and breadcrumbs did NOTHING for me. I ended up scraping it all off and just eating the carrots. No one else would eat this, even after scraping off the cream/topping and my son usually loves carrots. I won't be making this again.

Excellent!  If you're pressed for time, you can mix the cream, horseradish mixture in a jar and shake it.  I used my own home grown horseradish and it was great.  I parboiled fresh baby carrots.  I've made these several times and they were great every time.

I have a version of this recipe that I make.  I boil fresh carrots until tender, drain but keep 1/4 cup of the juice. Add the carrots to a dish and mix the juice with 1/4 cup of melted margarine,1/4 cup mayonaise 2tbsp onion, pepper and 1/4 cup breadcrumbs.  I didn't have horseradish on hand but I used a tablespoon of chili powder and mix it all together and bake for about 15 min.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  I am not a fan of cooked carrots but I will eat these any day and my family loves it.

I am about to make these now for the second time, as it was requested by my husband's Aunt...she asked me if I would bring along those wonderful carrots that I made last year for family dinner, so I am again about to make it.  Really easy, yet such a wonderful taste!!

This was delicious!  Added a little bit extra horseradish for an extra kick and used the breadcrumbs instead of the cereal.  Family RAVED about this.  This was something out of the ordinary that worked perfectly with my German themed meal.  Thanks!

An excellent side dish with lots of taste, crunch, and zing!  We will definitely be making this one more.

I tried this recipe exactly as printed. I did not like the 
"mushiness" of the pre-cooked carrots, and the horseradish level was a little high for me, and I like sparky! I did like the idea of adding cream to the mixture, but I added a little less, so the dish would not be too "soupy".

This was awful, had no flavor, was very bland, not impressed with this at all. I will stick to my mac and cheese recipe.

It was pretty good.  I used milk instead of cream, and crushed rice chex (what I had) instead of corn flakes.  It had a nice mild flavor, but just wasn't our favorite.

Mmmmmm, good!  I used fresh baby carrots that I lightly steamed first, and bread crumbs instead of the crushed cereal.  The flavor is milder than I though it would be, but good none the less.

I messed with this a bit, keeping the basic proportions of the sauce intact. It was fantastic. Was almost good enough to make me eat the carrots, even—but not quite. Dipped my fingers in the sauce and licked them clean instead. Absurdly good. Excellent for all kinds of things! Thanks much!

This is great!  Even my husband who does not normally like anything other than plain veggies really liked this.  I agree that various other veggies could be used, and I also recommend parboiling if you use fresh carrots.  Second making I cut back the mayo to 1/2 cup and didn't notice.

This side dish was a big hit on 
Easter.  I was a little nervous about the amount of horseradish but it tasted wonderful and wasn't overpowering.

I thought this would be saucy, but it's not, it's more cheesy - which was a fabulous result.  I loved the flavor.

Loved it!  I rarely like recipes made with mayonnaise, but this was very good!  I put extra cornflake crumbs in to soak up all the melted butter. Otherwise I didn’t change a thing.

Very happy with how this turned out. I used fresh carrots and steamed them before assembling. also assembled everything the night before to really let the flavors blend together. Otherwise I followed instructions to a "t". I may try crackeds instead of cornflakes next time but otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.

I made this for my family Christmas party and it was a massive hit!  They ate it so fast, I couldn't believe it.  I've given the recipe to three of them already.  I substituted heavy whipping cream for the light cream and also added frozen broccoli.  This is definitely a side dish to make!

Different!  Not bad.  Just not sure about the flavor.  I chopped fresh carrots and they baked up just fine, but could have used more; we had a lot of sauce.  Might be better with other veggie too?  I don't know if I liked the sweetness of the carrots mixed with the bite of the horseradish.  Broccoli maybe?

I halved the recipe, thought a couple of tbsp of horseradish would be enough, but the flavor seemed to mellow during cooking. Not zesty enough for us! I simmered fresh baby carrots because I was worried they would be crunchy. I might make this again.

Loved this recipe. I used fresh peeled carrots, and par-boiled them for 2 minutes before putting them in the dish.

This was really flavourful and a nice change from the usual.  I used frozen baby carrots but found that it took longer than the amount of time specified in the recipe.  My mom and dad loved this dish, and took the recipe home with them.

When using previously-frozen carrots, bake most of the time with a lid on to ensure that carrots soften up a bit.  Then, remove lid for final 5 minutes or so to make the "crunch" topping. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and the carrots were way too crunchy, even with 30" in the oven!
