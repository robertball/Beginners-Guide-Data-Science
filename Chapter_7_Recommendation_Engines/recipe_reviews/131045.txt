This is a very tasty recipe. I thought the topping was just a little too sweet, so next time I may cut back a little on the sugar. Also, I used a deeper pie plate so I will increase the amount of filling, including adding more peaches. It does puff up during baking, then settles back in. I did sprinkle some cinnamon on the peach filling before baking also. This is even better when cooled in the refrigerator. Thanks for a great recipe. I will definately make it again in the summer with some fresh peaches! FOOTNOTE: My father-in-law thought this was one of the best peach pies he's ever had!

I made mine with peaches, strawberries abd blueberries.  It was fantastic.  The sour cream gives it a great tang.  I did however used half of the butter the recipe called for in the topping and it still was great.  Sure to please if you're looking for a great fruit pie recipe.  I'm sure it'll work with any sort of fruit you have on hand.  WOW.

I doubled the recipe to make two pies and baked both at the same time.  I followed the directions step-by-step, but I was a little short on sour cream, so I probably only put about a cup-and-a-half of sour cream in them.  I also used about 12 fresh peaches (6 peaches per pie).  While baking the first 42 mins., I covered the edges of the pie crust.  I followed Trinity's Mom's suggestion and added some oats to the topping.  The pies were out of the oven for 15-20 mins. while I prepared the topping and upped the temp. to 400 degrees again, and when I put them back in the oven I uncovered the edges for the last 10 mins., then turned the oven off and let them sit in the oven for another 10 mins. They were perfect; not runny at all.  I cooled them for about 40 mins. and then covered them and put them in the fridge to chill, and they were delicious!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

We loved this pie and it was very easy to make as well. I also used a deep dish pan and added a few more peaches to fill the dish better. It was great. There are only two of us at my house, but we finished this pie off by ourselves in just a few days! The only difference I had to make was cooking time. I'm at high altitude (CO) and had to cook the pie a good 20-25 minutes extra to get the custard to set. This will become a standard recipe for me. Thanks!

My 9 yr old daughter and I made this pie together.  Wow!  We all loved it.  I did add extra peaches to the recipe.  My son said it should win best of show.

Old-Fashioned Peach Cream Pie definitely has its own zest and appeal. One difference I found preferrable in this recipe was the use of sour cream instead of cream cheese. As one who finds creamy texture to be a bit overbearing, this pie was just the right amount of creaminess to be enjoyable. The next time I make this recipe, I would chop the peaches into smaller pieces so one bite would not have to consist of a mouthful of peach and nothing else. Furthermore, definitely be sure to drain the peaches well, or else the filling will make the crust soggy, even when chilled for hours, even days. Also, don't make the topping until ready to use, or else the butter softens too much and simply forms clumps instead of being evenly spread across the top of the pie. Overall, it was delicious.

Very delicious and beautiful to look at.  The best peach pie I have ever made.  I used butter in my pastry dough and it came out crispy which was a nice complement to the pie.  I used a deep dish so I had to use 3 cups of peaches to fill it up more and it turned out amazing.  Love it

After peeling and slicing 2 cups of peaches, I realized they probably meant to use the tinned variety.  But the fresh peaches were delightful and the pie itself was well worth the time and effort.  Will definitely make again.

I used frozen peaches, I don't think they were quite thawed enough. The custard took an extra 20 minutes to set. The topping didn't brown much in the 10 minutes, so I stuck it under the broiler, and it looks much better. I think if I. Make this recipe again, I will add the topping after the first 12 minutes and definitely thaw the peaches all the way.  It looks delicious and I cant wait to taste it.

YUMMY is all we can say..our mouths are still full of this excellent pie. I used a graham cracker crust and the flavor was right on point.  Not too sweet or tart.

We had just gotten a lug of peaches and I needed to use some of the smaller ones that were ripe so I tried this recipe.  Everyone loved it!  I did use 3 cups of peaches and put it in a 9" deep dish pie pan.  It set up beautifully! Will make this again!

Wonderful recipe! The only addition was fresh ground nutmeg as I like the nutmeg peach combination. I put the crumb topping on the pie right away and left the oven at 400 for 40 minutes. Beautiful pie.

It was fine.  I was hoping I'd love it.  But I'm going to stick with straight up peaches in my pies.

Made two pies at once. Had to wash and slice the rest of the peaches I had on hand just to fill up my pie plates (AFTER I had put the custard/peach mixture in my pie shells)-- and I did have almost 3 cups of peaches for each pie to begin with. I used 9" pie plates -- maybe the wrong size?? The pies LOOK beautiful, but when slicing the first pie after it cooled for 2 hours, it is just a watery mess. I planned on giving the second pie to a friend tomorrow, but if the fridge doesn't firm it up I won't be able to. Maybe the peaches were too juicy. I just picked them yesterday.  And it's way too sweet. I'd still consider making this pie again. Maybe next time add more flour to the custard mixture, use smaller pie plates and definitely less sugar! And make only one, as a trial pie.

Wow this is a keeper.  I made two since I had a feeling one wouldn't last long. I used fresh peaches, 5 large were perfect for two pies. 
I still can't get over how good this is !

I'd never heard of a peach cream pie before and with it being late summer peach season, this recipe sounded delicious.  It was very easy to make and it didn't disappoint.  The sour cream added a tangy dimension to what can sometimes be a one note fruit pie.  I followed the directions to the T with one small exception--I added a couple dashes of nutmeg & clove to the topping.  My only issue was it required an extra 15 minutes of baking to set.  Even then, while it was not runny, it would have been better if it were a bit more firm.  Next time I would use only 3/4 sour cream.  It was also a little too sweet for me.  I would recommend cutting the sugar by 1/4 cup.  That would make this pie perfect!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and used peaches with blueberries in one and peaches with raspberries in the other. I used regular pie pans (not deep dish) and 6 fresh peaches. I ended up leaving them in the oven much longer than the 30 min suggested (I think 45 in total) and the custard never fully set. It was definitely better after a chill in the refrigerator (too runny when warm). I also listened to others and cut the sugar amount in the topping.  I think next time, less butter would be better too. I like a more crumbly top.  all in all - I give it a 4.5 stars.

An absolutely delicious pie.  Only change I made was I added more fresh peaches.  I didn't measure, just added as many as would fill the pie shell with the custard mixture.  Next time I'll also pre-bake the pastry shell for a short time to prevent a soggy crust.  I'm thinking I will make this many times to come.

This was a gorgeous and absolutely delicious pie! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I had a bunch of ripe fresh peaches that I peeled and sliced and made 2 pies. I did have to bake the pies for an additional 10 minutes to brown the topping and allow it to set a little firmer.  This is a wonderful recipe!!

Made as written with fresh local peaches.  I was generous with the peaches.  Set up beautifully but needed a few extra mins in the oven.  I think we liked it even better chilled.  Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe.  Would give it more stars if I could :)

This pie is absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  I used fresh peaches, and I peeled and sliced the peaches first, then let them sit in a strainer while I prepared the rest of the filling. This allowed some of the juice to drain off, so I didn't have any problem with soggy pie.  Also, I think the amount of crumb topping was perfect.  We loved it warm, and also loved eating it cold the next day.

This was a delicious peach pie! I didn't have quite enough sour cream, but that was no problem. I added more peaches (a whole bag of frozen) and I added less sugar to the filling. The topping was perfect. I liked it both hot and cold. I was the only one who liked it however, but I am a huge fan of any dessert that has cream,  cream cheese, or is creamy. If you don't like those things, then your probably won't like this pie. But I, who am normally not a peach pie fan, LOVED IT and it was so very easy to make.

My husband loved it more than I did.  Not crazy about the soggy crust.  Will have to bake first next time.

This is a great pie.  One problem I had it with the topping.  There seemed to be too much butter in it.  When mixed it wanted to clump into one big ball, when cooked it took about 40 minutes to get to a point where I could take it out of the oven.  It never completely browned, or maybe it did but the cinnamon disguised it.  Anyway, the top was swimming in butter.  One other thing, I had to add more peaches to the peach mixture.  After it was in the pie shell I noticed that there was a lot of places where there were no peaches.  Fortunately I had thawed out an extra bag and probably added an additional cup.  You can follow this recipe and add any extra peaches while it is in the pie shell. This is a great pie but next time I will start off with 1/8 cup of butter.  I will certainly make it again.

Substituted canned, sliced peaches in syrup since I had them on hand and it was perfect. The topping really adds something special.

I found this pie not sweet enough- I felt like it needed about an extra 1/2 cup sugar at least- 
it looked really nice and smelled wonderful but the taste was just ok.  Not sure I'd use the same recipe again.

I gave this recipe four stars versus five simply because I didn't think the topping was the best choice. If I'd left well enough alone and not added it then this would definite have been a five-star recipe! Besides, is there anything much better than pie ala mode? 

The sour cream gives the pie just enough "zip" to keep it from being overly sweet, and the use of fresh peaches made it extra yummy. Thanks, Cat Berner, for sharing this recipe!

Yum! My family loved this one. I used a gluten free crust and crumb top and it worked great!
