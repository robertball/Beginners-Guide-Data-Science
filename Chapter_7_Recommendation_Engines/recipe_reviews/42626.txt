Despite not having any fresh peaches (canned only) we gave it a try and I thought it was great. I may cut back on the curry a little in the future. I also plan on doubling the coconut milk. Thanks.

This is a really good soup. In fact, everyone in my family had seconds. I used canned peaches because fresh ones weren't available and it still turned out really well. I also didn't strain my soup after pureeing it. I will definately be making this again.

I am not a picky eater, but I would not recommend this soup. It was interesting to try, but I would not make it again as written. Instead, half the curry, or omit it all together. I tried some with fresh mint and I much preferred the peach-mint combo to the peach-curry flavor. I served this with a dallop of yogurt and turned it into more of a sweet summer soup. With these changes I enjoyed it.

This was great, but next time I will use a less sugar as it's almost too sweet.

I'm giving this a mediocre review as is.  It's far to sweet to be savoury for me.  The next day I roasted one large cubed yam and added that in with some cinnamon and cayenne pepper.  I alos added more cocnut milk and chicken stock to thin it out a little.  With those variations I would give it 5 stars.  I served it with sour cream and sliced green onion.

the good thing about this soup, is that it helped me use up the 12 small peaches someone gave our family from their trees from their back yard. i love trying new things, such as a sort of savory, spice-y peach soup, but i didn't really care for this. it needed something to pull out the syrupy, concentrated fruit flavor and give it more depth. i won't be making this again, but thanks for the experiment!

Still trying to decide about this soup.  No one in my family liked it except for me, and I was only able to eat a small bowl.  It was a little to sweet for our tastes.  I halved the curry, didn't add turmeric, and doubled the coconut milk, and used canned peaches. I know thats not what affected it in terms of us not caring fot it. I tried it both warm and cold and can't decide which way I like it better, but I did like it best topped with sliced green onions. I will not make again.

I hate to be the to break this rating streak. I did not like it. My husband liked it, but declined seconds.

Made with Yakami, WA fresh peaches, which were not as good as they sound. And, fresh chicken broth. 

Wont make again. :(

hmmm.  This just didn't work for us at all.  There are five in our family and none of us was willing to eat more than a bite of this soup.  I followed the recipe exactly (using local peaches that I had frozen at the peak of the season last summer, with no added sugar).  We love curries, but the combination of flavor and texture of this soup was not appealing to any of us.  I did not find it to be too sweet, as some other reviewers did - probably because I had used the plain peaches, whereas canned peaches have added sugar.  Maybe that would have made it tastier?  Needless to say, I won't be trying this recipe again to find out.  I hate to leave negative reviews, but this was a waste of ingredients and big disappointment for our peach-loving family.

I LOVED the flavor of this recipe. It's so nice to find complex flavors that fit so well together. However, it's so good it's almost overpowering as a soup so I used it as a sauce over rice and tofu, although I'm sure it would be good with shrimp too.

I loved it, my husband had seconds but no thirds, and my 5 year old daughter wouldn't have more than 2 bites.  Used canned peaches and followed the recipe exactly.  Didn't strain the soup, I kind of liked the texture.  I think a few chunks of peaches mixed in would have made it even better.  Delicious flavor and I'm not a big curry fan.  Didn't think it was too sweet, just the right amount of heat.  Loved it hot not cold.  Will make again!

My family, friends and I all love this soup. We often have it as an appetizer. If simply is great. To some of the lesser reviews, don't give a review if u don't like curry. Just because I don't like something, doesn't mean it's not good.

This. Was. Delicious. I was really surprised that I liked it, and that everyone else did too. I would definitely recommend serving it hot and NOT cold. The curry was nice and not too spicy, just enough to get your blood running quick.
