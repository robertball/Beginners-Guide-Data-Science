we made this a camp out evening tradition.everyone in the group gets "a shake",it seems to get better the more it's "shook".and yes its a potent brew.have had many a fellow camper left flat from the yucca.p.s we use luna zul white tequella for one of the two bottles.

This drink is very tasty!  It is also very potent, so be careful not to drink too much.  I didn't have enough room in my pitcher for all the fruit, so I squeezed in the juice and added water instead of ice and then refrigerated it all day to serve with dinner.  Great on a hot day!
