So very fast and easy and perfectly cheesey!  I twisted a new variation by using an 8oz jar of mexican cheese sauce and no water.  I also exchanged the onions for crushed Doritos, and my Daughter loved it!  The mexican cheese sauce adds a lil kick to it and the crushed chips gave it a nacho flavor.  yummy, this one is going in the box as a quick staple for house.

We made it the first time, and the "cheese sauce" seemed really thin, so the next time we used 2 cans of soup and it was better. Still very yummy though! :D

We Loved This When I made It for my Family. We paired it with some fried chicken. It was perfect.

This was good, but it would've been better with a few changes. I didn't have French Fried Onions so I didn't use any in the recipe. I added Garlic Salt, Cilantro, Greek Seasoning, and Onion Salt, I then added Chicken that had been fried in lemon juice and lemon pepper. The recipe as is, is very good, but it is very basic flavors. Next time I'll be adding some veggies, real onion (in place of the french fried), tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach and pine nuts. With these changes, it will turn the recipe from basic to delicious. I'll be making this again.

This was OK for us. We found it a bit bland. I did use Cheddar Cheese soup instead of mushroom and cheddar cheese instead of the two cheese blend. I also added 1/4 tsp of pepper. My boys liked it better then we did.
