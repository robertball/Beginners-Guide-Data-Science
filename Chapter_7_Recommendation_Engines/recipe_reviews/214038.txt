I personally prefer brownies that are more fudgy and sweeter tasting than these turned out to be. If you like brownies that are more cake-like and less sweet than this may be the recipe for you. With so many other better brownie recipes out there and easy to make, I won't make this one again.

Thank you!! These were so delicious. I didn't put the chips on the top but instead made a little extra chocolate sauce to ribbon through the brownies.
