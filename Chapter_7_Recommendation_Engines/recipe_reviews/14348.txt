This is a great salad, Paula. Very light and healthy. I cut the gorgonzola to 3/4c. Since my family loves citrus, I diced up two fresh oranges and used 4T of that juice in the dressing. Yummy. I believe the fresh oranges added a nice texture and more flavor than the mandarin. You could also substitute toasted pecans to really enhance the fresh orange flavor. Thanks for providing a recipe that can be very versatile!

A great salad, we loved the gorgonzola.  I used 4T of reserve juice to make the dressing more citrus flavored.

Fantastic!  My husband loves Gorgonzola, but I admit that I do not.  Yet I went ahead and made the salad fully expecting to hate it.  The flavors balance each other in such a tremendously complimentary way that the strong Gorgonzola taste is not compromised, but enhanced by the sweetness of the oranges and the nuttiness of the almonds.  What I expected to hate will be a keeper in my summer salad repertoire.  Thanks!

Excellent salad.  A bit heavy on gorgonzola.  Next time I'll reduce by half.

Excellent salad!  Due to the oranges, I served it for a Holiday Dinner Party, but would be great during Summer too.  Very easy to prepare.  I did what others suggested and reduced the Gorgonzola cheese amount by 25%.  It was fabulous!

This was delicious! Make sure and throw this all together right before you serve it so your lettuce doesn't get wilty.  I used balsamic vinegar instead and it was still great!

This was easy to make but I didn't really think it had great flavor. I had to add a lot more of the reserved juice to get even a little hint of flavor.

My family and I thought this was just an average salad, but that may be my fault.  I did not have any gorgonzola cheese and just used feta.  Also, I thought the dressing was a little bland - needed more mandarin orange juice.

A really pretty and tasty salad.  I recommend using spinach for the base for a variation.  I also added a pinch of sugar to the dressing.  Good with Quesa Fresca instead of the Gorgonzola, also.  Thanks!

I really liked the salad, but I found the dressing to be a bit bland,it felt too runny and just not anything too great.  So, I did tweak it a bit by increasing the oil to 1/3 cup oil, adding the 2 TBS of red wine vinegar, 4 TBS of orange juice, 2 TBS orange marmalade, 2 TBS sugar, pepper & salt.  I found the orange marmalade to be the kick that it needed!  I also added slices of red onion and real mandarin orange slices instead of the canned stuff.  I know - I know... I changed it all around, but it *really* made a difference!  It went over really well and everyone raved!

I couldnt find gorgonzola at the store so I used cheddar and mozzarella ( I just found out that gorgonzola is very close to the blue cheese family for anyone else who has this problem      :-)).  It was still good and the dressing was nice and tart.

This was a nice change of pace salad that the women at my party particularly liked.  The men, on the other hand . . . .  I used a whole block of cheese and many pieces were the size of cranberries. It was stronger than I expected, but good. Next time, I will cut down on the amount of cheese, or at least make sure it is crumbled more finely.

Absolutely fantastic.  I wouldn't have thought of it, yet it was a great Valentine's day hit.  Added a little more Gorgonzola just because we're big fans of this tasty cheese.  The contrast with the crunchiness of the toasted almonds, the sweetness of the oranges, and the headiness of the cheese is just amazing.  I added a touch of reduced balsamic vinegar to add a little more sweet and sour.  This will go in my rotation for special occasions.

Absolutely loved it!  Substituted sunflower kernels for the almonds due to food allergy.  Too sophisticated for the kids.  Can't wait to serve it to friends and co-workers!

It takes a little time to toast the nuts but it is well worth it.  I did find the the dressing slightly bitter so added a little sugar.

I absolutely LOVED this salad.  I made it last night for dinner.  I used red-leaf lettuce instead of Meditteranean salad mix since my store didn't carry it, and it was still absolutely delicious.  I'm definitely going to make this again.

I used this recipe on a sunny spring- like day. This was very easy and quick. I cooked one piece of chicken with garlic and pepper on the stove and cut it into little chuncks to add. I also added grape tomatoes and one avacado. Thanks for the great recipe!

This salad is a hit with my family.  Regular lettuce and fresh spinach both work with the dressing.  The only ingredient I have not been able to locate and include is the cheese.  No problem though, the recipe tastes great without it. - Greek Spice

I love this salad!  I'm not a gorgonzola fan, so I leave that out, but this is really a super-easy, flavorful salad that tastes like something you'd get in a restaurant.  Perfect for summer.

Duh! I have to admit-this is my first experience with gorgonzola cheese. Mine had the consistency of cream cheese, not crumbly like bleu-so, I had a little trouble figuring out how to place it on salad.

This was excellent and just right for a light evening meal.  The combination of almonds, gorgonzola cheese and mandarin oranges is exceptional!  Who would of thought to put those together?  The dressing is nothing special, I did go a little heavy on the reserved juice as other reviewers recommended but it needed something.  I may try a berry vinagrette next time.  Still a very good easy to make salad.  A keeper!

Good salad, refreshing. The dressing was missing a little something, so I added 1 tsp. dijon mustard.

This salad won over big time as an alternative to traditional Thanksgiving side dishes -- at two households! Snappy, refreshing and delicious even if you're not a fan of green salad.

What a nice change from my usual cranberry, walnut, gorgonzola salad!  Here were my changes, but out of respect to the original, they are only my own... I used spinach for the greens.  I used orange juice instead of that stuff in the can.  I used an Orange Muscat Vinegar that I had found at Trader Joe's.  I used slivered almonds instead.  And olive oil, of course.  I also did not measure anything, which I never do.  It was really yummy.  I do think that red onions would have been wonderful, but in the interest of making out, I didn't add them.  Make this salad!

the oranges make for a wonderful flavor.  the cheese is very strong (like blue cheese) so i wouldn't use quite as much.  i would also increase the vinegar amount in the dressing or purchase a bottled sesame dressing to brighten the flavor.  over all, it's a great summer salad for something different.

This was a nice change from the traditional tossed salad.  I added 5 tablespoon of the mandarin orange juice to sweeten the dressing a bit and caramelized the almonds.

I chopped up red leaf lettuce, regular lettuce, rucola and spinach for the salad.  I had to peel mandarin oranges cuz i didnt have a can of m-oranges on hand and it was a pain in the butt but tasted really good, more natural.  The m-orange, gorgonzola and almond matched totally well together.  I chopped up other types of nuts to put in the salad--walnuts, peanuts and cashews and it was still very good.  There was plenty of taste with just (olive) oil, juice and red wine vinegar as the dressing.  I squeezed a mandarin orange and got the juice from that instead of the syrup, and Im glad I did that because it didnt taste too sugary sweet.  Will definitely make again!

This is my staple salad--the one I can always pull out and have it be a hit.  Over the years, I've made slight modifications--mostly in how I make the dressing (I add either a little honey or agave nectar to make the dressing a bit sweeter). Sometimes I add strawberries in the summer. A little coarse-ground pepper helps this salad too.

This was a crowd pleaser at a recent party I had.  Like other reviewers, I reduced the cheese by half, and I also added some slivered red onion and the dish was so delicious.  The suggested dressing did not look or taste good AT ALL so I substituted bottled Vidalia onion dressing and it was so good!

This salad was excellent!  I used a spring mix and followed the advice of other users and added twice the amount of the mandarin orange juice.  It turned out perfect!  Next time I make this, I think I would like to try pecans and maybe spinach as some of the other reviewers recommended.  I definitely recommend trying this recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This salad tastes fantastic and is super easy to make.  I have made it countless times and everyone always loves it.  I recommend adding the hot almonds on top of the gorgonzola so that it melts the cheese a little bit into the dressing.

Easy! Pulsed candied pecans in a processor and added to the dressing beforehand. Not a fan of bleu cheese, subbed gruyere for gorgonzola.

This salad quickly became me and my toddler daughter's favorite since we made it last week. I've made this recipe with both 50/50 salad mix and Italian salad mix and the two of us finished off both bags two days in a row! The toasted almonds are a really nice touch. I added more of the mandarin orange juice as others suggested too. The only other tweak was that I thought I had red wine vinegar on hand and to my dismay discovered it was red cooking wine. It made me a bit nervous with the kid and all so I substituted it for balsamic. Still really, really delicious. Next time I will try it with red wine vinegar as originally posted.

A delightfully light and refreshing salad. To my dismay I was out of almonds when I made this, but substituted cashews which tasted great too. LOVED the Gorgonzola cheese, although we just kept it separate and let everyone put on how much they wanted (some omitted entirely). Great salad! The dressing was very mild, so next time I may add a bit more of the reserved juice.
