Really nice and refreshing, I love it!!! I added a teaspoon of honey and was delicious. It's aromatherapy in a cup. Relaxing, fragrant and reviving. I simmered the tea for 20 minutes and used dried lavender. I cant wait to make the iced version for hot summer days. The aroma in my house is amazing!!!

Made this with entirely with dried lavender and mint (used 1/3 of the measurements) and it is lovely...also, like Jenny, I added a bit of honey. Tranquility in a cup. Loved it.

Didn't quite measure but it turned out well. Very relaxing.
