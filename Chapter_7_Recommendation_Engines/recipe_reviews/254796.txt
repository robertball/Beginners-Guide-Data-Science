I've made this many times over the years, so simple but I use less sugar......measuring all else is subjective.Especially if someone-ahem- already ate a handful or two. :-)

Awesome! Made it for waffles.  I used blackberries instead of blueberries and I mashed them while cooking. Double the ingredients if you are making for mroe than a couple of people.  I will never by syrup again!

I needed a small amount of sauce for a refrigerator pie topping. I made it exactly as written, using frozen blueberries. It was good. Will use this recipe again with a couple of changes. I will add some lemon juice and cut back on the sugar.

I used 1/4C sugar. Don't forget to sift the cornstarch in, otherwise it will get clumpy and look weird.

This is so easy and very good the only thing I did differently was add a little less sugar.  Definitely going to keep this one

Made some Saturday morning french toast just a little special.  Don't know about six servings, the two of us finished it off this morning (maybe because it's that good??.  Nice blueberry sauce, and it's appropriately named because it is easy.
