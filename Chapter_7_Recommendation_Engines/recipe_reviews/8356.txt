This is a delicious cake.  By far the best and easiest carrot cake recipe I have made.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan and it came out great.  My only complaint was that the glaze was very thick and hard to spead evenly on the cake.

i loved this recipe so much that the cake isn't completely finished, and i'm about to make another. and another thing i love about it, is that there is no oil, butter, or shortening in it. but i did find it just a bit too lemon-y.

Sooooooooooooo yummy & moist . . . I was looking for a recipe that was light - the ones in the recipe books looked really dense and heavy - and this really hit the spot. My favourite recipe from this site so far.

So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Well, I had to change a few things . . . I halved the sugar, and replaced half the ground almonds with raisins and chopped walnuts. And I didn't ice it. With those adjuctments it was definately full marks, but as I had to make those changes myself I felt I could only give it a four.

Anyway, definately try this recipe! I promise it's well worth it!

Tasty cake, but does tend to stick! Very good with the addition of flake coconut. 

Be warned however that I found the statement "no added fat besides what's naturally contained in the eggs" to be misleading: the 1 cup of ground almonds is going to add what you may see as significant, albeit "good", fat in this recipe.

I'm from the Canton Aargau myself and I gotta say this is the real deal. In Swiss German we call it Aargauer Rueblitorte.  It is true, we are very famous for the carrots we grow :)

As a reviewer said before me, it turned out really thin and I think tasteless.  I lined the pan with waxed paper and it helped A LOT!  The sides of the pan needed a can of elbow grease for it to come clean.  I carefully followed the recipe....

Good if you want something way different than traditional American carrot cake.  It tasted good, just different.  Lots of lemon flavor.  Light texture, but almost too light, and almost too sweet.  This went over only so-so.

Really wonderful carrot cake, amazingly light, and fresh tasting. I substituted ground walnuts for almonds, as I didn't have almonds and cut the sugar back to 1/2 a cup, and probably could have done with even less.  No need to frost this cake, but the glaze sounds good, too. This recipe is quite simple, and makes a beautiful cake!

I've made it twice, this is my favourite..I also used less sugar (a bit more than a 1/2 cup). Frosting just adds extra calories, not the taste..

My husband suffers from chf and this cake is great for him due to the lower fat content.I watch what he eats so I really enjoy this one because he can have something sweet with a little less fat in it and still have great taste.

what a surprise to see a typical swiss recipe.

the cake was excellent!  I used less sugar.  Also my cake did not stick at all.  I used a non stick pan and used Pam instead of oil to cover the pan

this cake tasted much better than the kind you buy here in the shops

My husband is Swiss and his mother has made this cake for him since he was a kid. He loves it and is so happy that I can now duplicate his Mother's cake. Hazelnuts can easily replace the almonds.

This is a delicious and uniquely-flavored, lemony cake. I cut the sugar to half a cup and it was plenty sweet. I also topped it with a glaze made from the juice of half a lemon and some powdered sugar. Note: it only took about 20 minutes to bake in my oven. My husband and family topped the cake with plain yogurt and gave rave reviews. I'll definitely make it again, but double the recipe next time!

This was a very nice cake. I substituted ground hazelnuts and it turned out fine. I did think it was a little too sweet so next time I plan to cut the sugar a bit.

As advertised, moist, delicious and light!  And obviously, one look at the recipe tells you this is not what we're accustomed to calling carrot cake, so you do have to toss out those preconceived notions about carrot cake to rate this appropriately.  I knew I wanted to use a glaze on it, so I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  To be honest, if I was going glaze-less, this would not have been sweet enough for me, and the glaze proved to make it (almost) too sweet for my tastes.  So! Next time, I'll follow the cake recipe exactly, and maybe just dust with powdered sugar for effect.  I liked the almonds, but I might try using ground walnuts next time instead - I think they'd go better (maybe preconceived notions of carrot cake, but it sounds like a good idea to me!).  Thanks for sharing this unique and tasty recipe, Corwynn!

Highly reccommended. Created cake as per receipe. Chose not to ice - just dusted with icing sugar. Found that it was sweet with a distinct carrot flavour and not too oily as traditional carrot cakes can be.

This cake was good but it is not your typical carrot cake, it has a light lemony taste.  I frosted it with a cream cheese frosting that I added lemon zest and vanilla to.

I liked this cake a lot.  It is very different from the carrot cake I'm used to but it's good. Had a nice crisp texture on the outside but was moist on the inside.  I added a sprinkle of nutmeg, used 1/3 c sugar, and didn't use the frosting (made it for my 1 year old).  It was a good sneaky way to get in those carrots!

I'm still waiting for the carrot cake to cool off.  Is it supposed to be so thin?  It did't rise very much and is about 1 1/2  to 2 inches thick.  Is this normail?

Delicious and very moist cake! I changed the recipe slightly. I didn't have lemon zest, so I used orange peel and orange juice instead of lemon juice. I loved the orange taste. Next time I make this, I'll use 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the 3/4. It's way too sweet with the icing. I do think this cake will taste just as good if not better without the icing
***UPDATE*** 
I've made this cake 2 more times since I wrote the original review. I still love this cake. What I've learned is that the cake pan must be lined with wax paper or something. EVERY time I've made this cake it sticks to the pan even after oiling and flouring it.

This is an incredible recipe! It definitely doesn't need the icing. I found that it only took about 20 minutes to cook, compared to the 45 minutes it said. I will definitely make this carrot cake again.

Yum, even without the icing.  It stuck to the pan rather badly, though, so I'd recommend greasing the pan well.  A real keeper.

I find this the best carrot cake I have eaten. I love it and so did my family members. I did not use the frosting and it still tasted great. I will try to reduce the sugar a little the next time round too and line a piece of wax paper at the bottom.

Yes, it was good, however, there was more fat than just the eggs.  The almonds contribute a significant amount to the total fat.

smells delicious, but yes it did turn out thin. may be due to my lack of experience in beating the egg whites. fyi for anyone else, the eggs should be room temp. & any tiny amount of yolk in the whites will mess things up. from what i read getting them stiff should take about 3 - 5 mins. and need to be folded in immediately. will rate tomorrow after tasting. good luck.

What a delicious cake! A real pleasure and quite different from any carrot cake I've ever had.

This cake had a great texture, and a great eggy taste! I'll definitely make it again, but next time I think I'll skip the frosting, the cake would probably be even better without it!

This cake came out pretty bad. I thought the recope looks funny, only having a 1/4 cup flour. It came out like a carrot tart...not a carrot cake!

This recipe makes a rather small cake, but it’s really, really delicious. It’s not overly sweet, and the lemon really brings out a more satisfying flavor than you’ll get out of a box mix. We ended up using cream cheese icing, and it was a match made in heaven. It lasts more than six months in the freezer, retaining a good texture and flavor when thawed. It’s a great cake to bake then freeze for an occasional snack if you’re the only one eating it.
