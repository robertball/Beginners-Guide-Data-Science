Substitutions due to not having required ingredients:
-I didn't have the lime leaves (I never do) so I used a couple bay leaves and a tablespoon of lime juice. 
- I used basmati rice instead of brown. 
-No panang paste on hand, I used red curry paste
I also thickened up the sauce with a bit of corn starch.
The flavor was wonderful. A nice mild curry with good flavor. I like a bit of heat so I added a couple drops of Carolina Reaper sauce to mine. Super easy to make. It's a winner and I'll definitely make it again.

This is very good. I used homemade curry paste, which I think made it better than using a bottled version. Although, I will add an extra tablespoon or two next time because it I thought it was a bit bland a with just 2.5 tbsp. The last step took a bit longer than what is written, more like 8 minutes to get tender. But method is fantastic. I added a red onion, too.
