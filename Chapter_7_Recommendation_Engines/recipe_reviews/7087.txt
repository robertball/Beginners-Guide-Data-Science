I made this bread for my best friend, as she is allergic to yeast. I was skeptical at first. I used Sprite diet soda. Today she opened her "gift" and we had a toasted piece. WOW! It was so good. She said she could easily get hooked on this bread and was cheaper than what she was buying at the health food stores. She is making another loaf tomorrow. It's a keeper!

I had never baked bread before trying this recipe.  Hence, I used a glass loaf pan instead of metal.  My bread came out too doughy due to using the wrong container.  Just sharing my goof, so that others use this great recipe properly.

This gives new meaning to the term 'soda bread'. I thought I had really messed it up (didn't have self-rising flour, used 2 tsps. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt added to reg. flour, plus I baked in a pie plate), but the flavor was really, really good! I was so surprised at the taste. Kind of chewy and slightly sweet (I used 7-Up and only 2 tablespoons of sugar). There is something magical about this strange combination, but it works!

This was a super fast to prepare and super easy bake!  Tasted great too!  I shared it with my co-workers, and I didn't have to print the recipe, it was so easy to remember.  I'm going to try it adding Italian seasonings and parmesan cheese.

This bread is great but to make it less sweet and better for sandwiches I use a can of club soda instead of lemon lime soda. I am allergic to yeast so this is as close to bread as I get, what a wonderful alternative to yeast breads!

This is an excellent easy recipe.  It works with any flavor of soda.  For a little extra flavor I add the zest from an orange to the batter.

I loved this recipe. I made it twice, so far, once plain, and once with garlic. I used a can of regular Sprite and 1 Tbs. sugar, next time I would not add the sugar. I also added a few thin slices of butter on the top. I used it to make grilled cheese sandwiches and just served plain. My family loved it.

I used whole wheat flour, & added 3 tsp baking powder & 1 tsp salt. Others had mentioned something about the center being a little doughy, so I made a trough down the center of the dough before putting it into the oven. I used a metal baking pan, & it came out PERFECT. My daughter & I LOVED it. I may never have to buy bread again. ;~)

This was the first "from scratch" bread I baked.  I was going to pass it up and decided...if it comes out bad, what did I really waste.  I have no complaints whatsoever and would reccomend it to anyone!

I loved this recipe.  It was the first time I've baked bread and it was so simple.  It's a bit doughy after you first take it out of the oven, but is fine when you let it sit for two hours.  I found keeping in a tupperware container that it stayed fresh for a couple of days.  I used one can of sprite zero.  It has a touch of sweetness and goes great with sugar free jam.

It was a rather tastless bread this, could I add some salt?  Some recipes indicate that one should add lemonjuice, why would that be and others again use buttermilk.  Please give me some advice, as I am not allowed to have any bread with yeast and could one use any alternative flour?

This was a super easy, quick bread. I wanted to make some bread, but realized that I was out of yeast, so I found this recipe. I used Target-brand lemon-lime soda and added about a teaspoon of salt. I also spread the bread with the "Garlic Butter" recipe from this site and ate with some homemade soup for dinner - yum!

This reminded me of a over sized biscuit. The flavor wasnt bad, nor the texture. I will make again but will add a bit of salt maybe..
Thanx for the recipe!

This bread is amazingly easy and tastes amazing!  Thank you for sharing.  I sprayed a little spray butter on top the last 5 minutes of baking and it browns up a bit.

MMM this bread is the perfect consistency.  Love how soft but dense it is.  I omitted the sugar and added salt and I'm glad I did.  I added cheddar cheese to my dough and then piled it on top before throwing it in the oven and it came out beautifully!  Thank you for this recipe, it will now be a staple.  Making a couple loafs next weekend for a party at my house!

I recently developed food allergies and one of them is to yeast.  This bread is a life saver. It is easy to make, tastes great and is cheaper than buying the bread from the health food store.  Thank you for this recipe. 5 stars... Used it as a bun for my hot dog last night and I felt like I wasn't compromising any taste.   I also want to mention that I am also allergic to corn, potato and grapes. I had to use regular flour (same amount) and then used 2 tsps of starch free baking powder with 1/2 tsp salt. I cut back on the sugar and used lime carbonated water! Turned out great!

Incredible but true! This works and it's good. I used bread flour, 2tsp of baking powder and 1tsp of salt with a can of 7up, I didn't add sugar, and voilà! I made them into 14 mini buns (12 if I would have really overfilled them) I added a picture for you to see. Cooking time is about 20 minutes +. Check with a toothpick for readiness. Now I'm ready for my Christmas diner.

This is an excellent recipe, tastes great. I use lemon flavored sparkling water from Trader Joes and added 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt, made 6 bread rolls and baked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. 
Excellent toasted then spread with Peanut butter and jelly and when I make Tuna Burgers. Not bought bread since I found this recipe. Also freezes well. Thank you Andrew!

I used Perrier instead of soda (or pop as we refer to it in Canada) and it worked out fantastic! I always used to dislike yeast free breads so I just stopped eating them. Now I have a yummy replacement! My suggestion is if you want to still use the 3 tbsp of sugar, use Perrier.

I am gluten-free and I don't tolerate yeast well, so I decided to try this recipe with an all-purpose gluten free flour. I went ahead and used 2 1/4 cups g-f flour and 1/4 cup of ground flax seed (to ensure a bit of a nutty flavor and for extra nutrition), then added 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 3/4 teaspoon of salt (because there is no such thing as self-rising g-f flour). I did not use any of the sugar, but used 12 ounces of 7 UP. I baked it for 50 minutes. I had a bit of trouble getting it to turn out of my small loaf pan, so I will use more grease/flour next time. IT IS DELICIOUS and has a perfect texture. Please note: I did NOT use any xanthan gum. I look forward to adding some herbs to it in the future just to experiment with more tastes. THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing the original recipe on-line!

This bread is shockingly good! My son was recently diagnosed as having a yeast intolerance, and he was really missing bread.  I made it for him this morning, and we're both having it for lunch.  Not having self-rising flour, I used 3 cups baker's flour, 4 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt along with a can of Sprite and 1/4 cup olive oil.  Perfect!

I just made my second loaf since yesterday. My son LOVES this bread right out of the oven. It is so easy to make and GREAT for those on a strict budget and trying to stay within their grocery limit. 3 ingredients to a great quick loaf of bread! A keeper for me

I have made this several times since I found out I have to be yeast free for a few months.  This bread is awesome and so easy.  I use Lime Lacroix, 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp salt and various seasonings depending on what I am pairing it with.  Tonight, I added some dried jalapeno and chipotle seasoning.  Italian is also really great!  This past weekend, I made pigs in a blanket, it was a hit, but very messy to make.  Though worth it.

This tastes just like the homemade bread my mom would make when I was a kid but without the hours of proofing, kneading, and hoping it wasn't too burnt at the end!  Fantastic recipe, passing it on to Mom right now.

I used seltzer water because that was all I had and I made my own self rising flour. This was okay. The kids liked it, they both ate several pieces spread with butter. Both the husband and I like beer bread much better.

Mine turned out rubbery, dense, and tough. Needed a little more salt. tasted good with herb butter, though. So much for my first ever attempt at baking bread.

It's great because I am allergic to eggs and yeast. After having no bread for 6 months this was a treat. Really sweet so make with diet soda. Eat within a couple days as it doesn't have a shelf life.

I was actually surprised with this recipe. It's a bit like beer bread. I dabbed a bit of butter on top. Used a Diet 7-Up & very little sugar. Really easy to throw together.

The flavor of this bread is great. We keep ending up with a core at the bottom of the loaf, running end-to-end, that is very doughy. How do we avoid this? We've tried the recipe in a convection as well as gas oven.

I didn’t have a glass loaf pan so I used another glass pan. I had cherry sprite and my husband is my taste tester/food critic and he loves this bread

This was so easy and I thought it turned out great. I used club soda and a metal loaf pan, not glass. Better than expected!

Fantastic. So simple and great to have on it's own right out of the oven with some butter. I also enjoy serving it on the side with soup. I added a pinch of salt in the mix. I tried both sprite and diet caffeine free coke (I didn't have any sprite when I wanted to make it again)  and both were great. Who could believe a recipe this simple would be such a hit!   I made some for my neighbors and they loved it too!

This sounds good, but is there a yeastfree bread without the use of soda? Maybe replace the lemon lime soda with Club soda? Thank you to all who reply!
