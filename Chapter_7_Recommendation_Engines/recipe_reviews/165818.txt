This was a great base recipe - first, I used real chicken tenders (sorry) just cooked them up with some italian seasons and garlic in olive oil. Next, I added some sugar to the sauce, just enough to sweeten it and just enough to lighten the tomato-y taste. Next, I added a layer of italian breadcrumbs before the layer of mozzarella - it's chicken parmesan afterall, right? The boyfriend loved it and it was easy to prepare with items I had on hand. Yummy!

I had some left-over grilled chicken to use up, so I decided to give this a try. Instead of layering everything I mixed it all together and topped with cheese. Hubby really liked it and actually commented on how good it was and has asked me to make it again (which rarely happens).

Very tasty and easy, but I cooked it more than the recommended time, and I used real chicken instead. Excellent recipe though ! :)

Good base recipe, but needs more spices. I had have a batch of my own vegetable marinara in the back of my freezer which I used in place of the sauce called for and a package of real chicken nuggets. This is a good recipe for husbands and kids who don't like a whole lot of frills, like mine. This is also a good clean out the freezer/pantry/right before payday recipe as well as has stretchability to feed whoever happens to show up at your doorstep or extra hungry boys.

Very yummy, but I used real chicken breast cut into small squares. I made my own sauce with more seasonings and added tomatoes and onions. When it came to the cheese I used what I had around which was white American and shredded cheddar and Monterey jack.

This turned out sooooo good after a few changes. I used real chicken breasts that I cooked and seasoned in a saucepan. I added a bunch of seasonings to the whole recipe because its a little plain, and added more cheese. But my boyfriend and his mom both loved it! I will defeating make this again!

We loved this! Used "chik'n" patties instead of nuggets and added parsley, green olives, capers, & onion powder to the sauce too.
