Serve this cake to family or friends and you will do yourself proud, just as I did tonight. A good rule of thumb is to never try out a new recipe on guests, but this was a real winner. It is easy to whip up, with common pantry ingredients.  Deliciously moist and chocolaty, this is very similar to the wildly popular "Black Magic Cake" on this site - but doesn't require the buttermilk.  I made this as the recipe directed, using a full teaspoon of salt for the "pinch" called for.  I frosted it with Chocolate Frosting II, submitted by LUV2DY4. Good, old-fashioned homestyle chocolate cake.

Excellent, excellent chocolate cake. This is the first cake I've ever made, and it turned out GREAT. It wasn't too sweet and the coffee and cocoa made a great combination! I was a little scared when the batter turned out EXTREMELY thin and smelled strongly of coffee, but in the end it was WONDERFUL. Thanks so much for the recipe! Will try again.

This recipe saved the birthday party!!

I had originally made another highly recommended recipe (which will remain nameless) that worked find but was totally flavorless (too much boiling water) so i had just enough time to try again and took a chance with this one.  It was FANTASTIC, the coffee made the difference, really good flavor.  I used decaf, and margerine instead of the oil, and through in some imitation rum to both the batter and buttercream (chocolate) icing.  Saved the day!!

A truly excellent chocolate cake, in that it's easy to throw together with items you are likely to have in your pantry, in flavor, which is deep and round due to the coffee which can't be tasted but which brings out all the best in chocolate, and in texture, which is moist. It is everything that your grandma's chocolate cake brings to mind. I needed to serve several people, so I baked it in a 15"X10" jelly roll pan or cookie sheet, and was surprised that there was too much batter to fit. I baked the remainder as 6 cupcakes. The sheet cake was baked to perfection in 22 minutes, the cupcakes in 18. Topped both the cake and cupcakes with a glossy cross between a glaze and a frosting, consisting of 4 Tb cocoa, 1/2 a stick of butter and 6 Tb milk heated just until boiling, then combined with 4 cups powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla, all poured over the hot cakes. Next time I need a big cake, I'll put all of it into an 11"X17" jelly roll pan, and it will fit the full recipe perfectly. Thank you for a keeper that I'll turn to again and again.

I made this for my husband's birthday 3 days ago and the cake is still moist and delicious.  Try it with a homemade cream cheese icing....YUM!**********
Update (12-2-10):  Four years later, this has become my "go to" chocolate cake recipe.  My kids ALWAYS request it (with homemade cocoa icing) for every birthday.  I've made it over and over, and only once did it "fall", and that was when I switched brands of flour.  Needless to say, I ditched that flour and went back to my old brand.  Perfect chocolate cake!

Wow! Thanks for a great recipe. I used this with "Coffee Butter Frosting" from this site (increasing the strength of coffee in both) to make a delicous coffee and chocolate cake for my man. I then decorated with chocolate vermicelli. We all licked our lips after this! Yum

This cake is fantastically good. It is just like the store bought mud cakes! I made it for my birthday and put ganache icing on top, it was delicious. So moist and nice. Possibly a little too much sugar and I had to cook it for longer than 25 mins, closer to 40 mins. I also added chocolate bits on top of the batter before I cooked it. I thought the coffe being added was strange, but it works a treat! A yummy treat. :)

This cake got rave reviews!!  I couldn't believe how easy it was to prep.  I was worried when it came out of the oven really dark but it was perfect, spongy and moist.  I used a different frosting recipe and added some raspberries.  Excellent cake - I will make it again.

This cake is very forgiving because I messed up. UK cup measurements are different to US measurements so I keep a conversion chart I printed off allrecipes taped to the inside of one of my cupboards. Anyway the kids were squabbling behind me and I was distracted and read the conversion chart wrong and put too much oil in. Despite this still turned out to be the best chocolate cake I've made. Will come out regularly on birthdays. Thanks

This cake is very easy to make and is extremely delicious and moist.  I made up an icing with 1 stick of butter, 4 oz. cream cheese, about 1 1/2 pounds of powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 4 tbs. cocoa and about 3 tablespoons of dark coffee.  It was to die for.  I made it for Easter dinner and everyone raved about it.

I personally like this cake because it only called for 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of oil in the recipe. The 2 cups of sugar was a bit traumatizing, but maybe it's because I don't really like desserts that are too sweet. I used a hot cocoa mix instead of unsweetened cocoa powder because I didn't have any on hand. So I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, but I think next time maybe 3/4 cup or even 1 cup of sugar. Overall, it was really good, and it's my first time making a cake. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my daughter's birthday party with a simple butter frosting.  All the kids loved it.  It was super easy to make.  I didn't even use a blender - just a whisk.

Wonderful, the cake was moist and yummy.  I was lazy this time and used canned icing, but next time I will make the real thing...it deserves it.

This was my first attempt at making a chocolate cake from scratch and it was great. I was in the mood for a moist airy spongey cake and this was it. I added about 3 tablespoons of sourcream just to make sure that I would have a moist cake.  I know that coffee helps to give a more intense chocolate taste. But I will probably use 1/2 cup of coffee next time. Other than that it was a great cake.  I didnt even frost it.

My very first attempt at making an actual cake, and it turned out great. Thank you for this recipe. It was really delicious. I decreased the sugar by half cup as per previous reviews, and topped it with buttercream frosting II. Very nice.

This is awesome! My husband has mentioned he thinks it might be the best cake I've ever made (and I'm a pretty good baker if I must say so myself!) We really like it because it doesn't taste real sweet to us like a lot of desserts do. He doesn't like really sweet desserts. I, like another reviewer, drizzled a caramel glaze over the top. Served with a little vanilla icecream and it was great. It doesn't really taste like coffee, the coffee just adds a little different flavor. I baked in a bundt pan. Takes a little longer, but just keep an eye on it. Five stars!

This recipe was really one of the easiest cake recipes ever and mighty tasty to boot.  This recipe is virtually identical to "Dark Chocolate Cake II" with the difference of vinegar/vanilla between the two.  So I just added both ingredients -- I always thinks vanilla boosts the chocolate flavor, and the vinegar probably made the batter puff up a bit more.  My minor modification was to reduce the sugar to about 1-1/4 cups, as 2 cups seemed a bit excessive.  The cake still tasted plenty sweet.  I layered it with some strawberry sauce -- yummy!

I converted the recipe to 20 servings and it made a HUGE cake! The taste was phenomenal, it wasn't too sweet and had just the right amount of chocolate. It was really moist and airy. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!
****** UPDATE - 11-13-2011 ~ I made this recipe two more times and both times were like the first except that it was moist and dense. But, I noticed that the flavor is a little lacking. It doesn't taste strongly of chocolate. I'm eating a piece right now and the only thing that is saving it is the chocolate frosting on top. I would give this recipe about 2 and a half stars now that I've made it a couple times.

I couldn't decide between a 3 or 4 rating for this cake -- it was ok but nothing great.  The recipe is similar to that found at the back of Hershey's cocoa, just with coffee in it.

I enjoyed this cake.  I liked it because the coffee cuts the sweetness.  I did reduce the sugar like others recommended.  I gave half of it to my boyfriend who enjoyed it... so much he woke up in the middle of the night and finished it.  I guess it was alright.

This turned out really well. You couldn't taste the coffee, but it had a delicious flavor and moist texture. 

I didn't think that it would turn out at first. After 25 minutes in the oven it looked like pudding, but I left it for another 10 or 15 and it was perfect.

I loved this cake, and so did everyone else who ate it. I was worried at first because the batter was so thin,but it baked up beautiful! the texture was great and the flavor of chocolate and coffee was fabulous! I will make it again. I used the mocha butter frosting recipe that I found on this site that added even more to it's greatness!

I baked this cake with the recommended frosting. The frosting leave much to be desired, as does the cake itself.  I will be deleting both from my recipe box immediately. What a disappointment. I spent all afternoon on this cake and my daughters were looking forward to yet another one of my fabulous creations, only to be upset and disappointed.

Overall this was a good chocolate cake recipe. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 because I wish it would have been sweeter.

This is just like the cake my grandma used to make. The only thing that makes it better is peanutbutter icing (just add  peanutbutter to your favorite white icing to taste). It's a perfect combination!

this is an outstanding cake recipe.  i doubled it with no issues to make a princess castle cake with many layers.  the birthday girl is not partial to the flavor of coffee in her cakes, so i dissolved an extra 1/2 cup (for a doubled recipe) of cocoa powder in the hot water instead of using the coffee.  this cake was moist and wonderfully chocolately.  it was also great to frost - did not give off a lot of crumbs which was great! this will be my new go-to chocolate cake recipe.

This cake was so yummy!  It turned out light and moist.  I used weak coffee because a couple people in my family hate coffee, and you can't taste it, it just enhances the chocolate.  This was moist and fluffy and EASY...this will be my "go-to" recipe for chocolate cake.

This was okay. There was nothing wrong with it but nothing that made me want to have a repeat performance. It wasn't chocolaty, it wasn't coffeeish, it was just blah.

I made this cake with my niece and nephew for my birthday and as we were making it I didn't feel that it would turn out but it turned out very well.  I checked the cake and it was finished baking.  The cake was delicious and we really enjoyed eating it.  I would recommend this cake to anyone.  It is not hard to do with children and it is real good.  i recommend this to everyone.

My first real cake from scratch and what a great success! Used microwave heated morning's leftover coffee in the evening when I made it. Was worried that it might take on the "old coffee" taste, but no worries at all. The taste of the coffee evaporated, even though it is strong in the raw dough. Wonderful cake.  Made up my own frosting with cream cheese, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, butter and powdered sugar to taste. Probably a similar recipe somewhere here, but wanted to figure out my own because of the luscious goodness of this cake.  Made one layer of frosting very dark and chocolately and the other light chocolate, then swirled the knife around on the top.  Looked like a cake from the bakery and taste oh-so-much better.  Served it to Europeans last night, most of whom had never had an American cake. Everyone went wild for it. This is definitely a keeper.

EXCELLENT cake recipe! And so easy! I made a mini version for my boyfriend's birthday...I halved the recipe; used Ghirardelli cocoa and a little extra vanilla. I baked the layers in 5" springform pans, it made four total layers at 25 min in the oven. Perfection! I will absolutely be making this again, the cake is divine.

My go to chocolate cake!  I get compliments every time I serve it!  Perfect moisture and not too sweet.  I have used coffee as well as substitute the coffee for sour cream.  My families birthday cake.  (I use Rick's Buttercream Frosting from this site, substituting butter and coconut oil for the Crisco.)  Lots of compliments every time!!

Great recipe, I will definitely used again 
I did substitute 1 cup of the all-purpose flour with cake flour
I was worried when I saw how runny the batter was, but they turned out perfect

*update* I've made this recipe about ten times now, the trick is to not overfill the cups using about 1/4 cup batter per cupcake! 
I also ran out of my dark chocolate powder once and tried to substitute melted baking chocolate the cupcakes ended up dry and mediocre :P

This cake is superior.  It harkens back to a time when, as a waitress, we added left over coffee from the evening's dinner crowd to the Hershey's syrup topping and it was just as wonderfully tasty as the cake is.  Wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.  I tried sour cream choco. icing and a nice complement to the cake.

This cake was a disaster!! It didn't rise at all..I would give this cake the benefit of doubt because i think my baking soda was really old. But even so it shouldn't have tasted so bland..

I don't eat chocolate cake but I made it for valentines day for my husband- and he loved it. He kept saying you outdid yourself, I laughed because it was the easiest from scratch recipe I ever made!  I made the coffee strong, so I think that it gave the cake a more bold coffee flavor which I like. The only reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is because it fell apart when I took it out of the pan. I greased it pan, so I don't know why it did that. Maybe it was because it didn't cool enough? I don't know. But well worth trying again!

5 stars for moistness (?), but could do with a bit more chocolatey taste.  Then again, the cocoa powder wasn't at its freshest...  Kids loved it

I loved it! It is simple and quick, and at the same time I've used this recipe to experiment and I came up with great ideas! Instead of using 2 eggs, I tried 4 egg whites, I also substituted the cocoa with chopped nuts... It is an awesome recipe for someone who's learning to bake! It was actually the first cake I ever made by my self!

this cake is great. it turned out perfectly. and it was gone very quickly. i substituted hot chocolate mix for coco, because i ran out half way through. so it wasn't too sweet i took out most of the white sugar. delicious. i'm making it for my friends b-day as we speak.

This is a practically foolproof recipe that yields a cake with tender moist crumb. Batter is supposed to be very thin, so don’t think it’s a mistake and don’t sub anything for the coffee as it really makes the chocolate flavor “pop” I like to take this cake to work for birthdays of coworkers and it’s always a hit. I m a much bigger fan of cakes using cocoa as opposed to chocolate. It has more depth of flavor.. Try it you won’t be disappointed.

I have not tasted this ,  but according to the sweet tooth in the house , it is very good and moist .  I first made it because it only called for 2 eggs ( we were low ) ,  and there is always left over coffee .  I have made it twice ,  and both times it turned out great .  I bake in a very well greased and floured bundt pan ,  for about 50 - 70 mins.  I don't know what size pan it is . ( my bad ) .  No frosting either time .  The first one we drizzled with a caramel sauce .  The second one just sprinkled with powdered sugar .  No fuss .  :)

This is by far the best chocolate cake I have ever baked! It is VERY moist and so easy to put together. I followed the recipe to the letter, except I baked it in three nine-inch cake pans. There is no need to change a thing.

I live with a chocoholic (or two), and this is THE BEST chocolate cake we've ever tasted. Moist. Flavorful. Rich. Satisfying. Totally worth the calories, and VERY easy to make. This is my new go-to recipe. I served this with homemade coconut-pecan frosting (German Chocolate Cake frosting). Tasted like we bought a $10 slice of patisserie confection! Make this recipe exactly as written--no need to get creative. Use fresh ingredients, bake as directed. You will not be disappointed!

5 stars for ease of making and the simple ingredients this cake requires. A very versatile and moist chocolate cake. I used only 1 cup sugar as we don't like cakes that are too sweet. We tried it as is and with vanilla ice-cream. The ice-cream made it much more interesting and I was glad that I used only 1 cup sugar as the level of sweetness was just right with the ice-cream. Thanks for the simple recipe!

I just baked it- great! so moist and wonderful!  I baked it for a friend's birthday with vanilla icing and ganache filling. I was a bit worried baking for a friend and trying a new recipe.   1.5 x the recipe to make a triple layer cake.   I was a bit worried about the coffee, but it really does enhance the flavour... not coffee tasting at all. I will make it again if I need something simple that I can count on. Thanks!

I have finally found THE chocolate cake recipe.  I made this for my son's 16th and everyone LOVED it.  It is easy to make and tastes amazing!!  Super moist.  I listened to some of the other reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  I iced it with the sturdy whipped cream frosting recipe from this site.

Could use a little more chocolate flavor.  Will add a little more cocoa powder next time.  Very moist cake and I received rave reviews.  Frosted it with buttercream frosting.  Next time, will use a chocolate ganache frosting!

I truly enjoyed the flavors and texture of this cake. This recipe was quick and easy and it didn't disappoint. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday with chocolate fudge icing and he couldn't have been more pleased. It won't take the place of my mom's chocolate cake, but for a quick in a pinch recipe that doesn't take a lot of time or ingredients, but has a great flavor, this was perfect!

This cake was super easy and every ingredient it called for I had on hand (BONUS!).  I made a layer cake with it and frosted it with a white fluffy frosting.  Very moist, easy and worth the calories.

What a easy, great tasting cake. I made it as written. I hate it when people give a recipe 5 stars then list all they did different. That is not a review of that recipe. Post your own changes as your recipe. That is what it is. Anyway. I was concerned at how wet it was. And I thought in no way will this cook in 20 minutes. Well, I was right. It was 42 minutes. But part of that could be my oven. Even though I use a oven thermometer, I don't think it stays  at even heat sometimes. Other times it is right on. Go figure. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing Grandpop's recipe with us to enjoy.

The batter was too thin and so the cake didn't bake thru even at double the time. I think it needs lesser water. The taste however, was great!

I followed the recipe to a T except for changing The sugar content. I’m never really a fan of adding less sugar to anything, but I accidentally did so in this making my batter.  It was lessened by half a cup and produced the best cupcakes I’ve ever made. And I have made A LOT of cupcakes!  The less sweet better coupled with the standard powdered sugar, butter and vanilla extract frosting, which is pretty sweet, made an over the top delicious flavor profile.  People raved about it and asked for the recipe.    Thank you for sharing Pop Pops favorite recipe with us!!!

Fantastic recipe! Very easy to make. I followed the directions exactly and baked for about 35 minutes. Came out perfect, very moist. You can't taste the coffee but it makes the cake rich and brings out the cocoa flavor. I frosted with a coffee butter frosting recipe that I found on this site.

It was a really good cake. My family loved it. I made it two layer cake. It had to bake longer than it said because I may have put to much batter in each pan. And it was a little dense. but for the most part, it was really good.

I have made this cake weekly for about a year now. This is our favorite desert and is a never fail recipe! The only change I made was a slight reduction in liquids so it’s not so runny. Other than that, this cake is absolute chocolate perfection. I pair it with a basic chocolate icing that consists of icing sugar, cocoa, butter and a touch of milk and vanilla. I do two thin layers of icing in middle of cake and a ton on top and all over. Everyone who visits asks for my special chocolate cake! Thanks for the recipe. Been searching for one like this for over 30 years!

The chocolate cake taste so good, but I don't know with the temperature of the oven. It said that it's 325F for 35 mins but the batter was taking so long to bake. I turned up the heat to 350F and kept adding time but the middle part didn't cook so my cake ended up having a crater in the middle.

Made this cake for a birthday party and it was enjoyed by all. Nice texture and moist. Very easy to make. I made a 9X13 slab cake rather than two 9in round and baked it  a 3 to 5 mins. longer until the center was done.

This cake came out perfectly and it goes so well with the Best Buttercream frosting recipe on this website.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup coconut sugar and 1 1/4 cup sugar. Cake needed 23 minutes to bake.

Made the cake as directed.  It is a really good chocolate cake.   So happy I tried it.  I had problems with another chocolate cake with falling.  No matter what I tried it fell.  Very frustrating when I consider myself an experienced home baker.  However, this cake  had basically the same ingredients, but different amounts.  More flour for one and less coffee.  The cake turned out beautifully.  It is now my go to chocolate cake recipe!  

OK..have made this cake 3 more time and each time it's turned out beautifully.  Made this recipe for cupcakes for my great nieces 3rd birthday.  received many compliments for this cake.

My grandfather was "grandpop" too so I was drawn to the name, but it's the cake that keeps me coming back. We LOVE this cake! I follow the recipe as is for the ingredients but since I live at high altitude, I have to adjust the baking time/temp. I use the mousse from the Chocolate Mousse Cake IV recipe by Stephanie. The sweet mousse is a perfect match for this not too sweet cake. They really balance each other. My mom and husband both request this cake for their birthdays every year. Even my vanilla loving kiddo can't get enough. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I did make some changes after reading some reviews.  Can't say I agreed with many of the critics.  I did add more cocoa, a table spoon of cinnamon, and VERY strong coffee.  Cinnamon always enhances cocoa.  Man, this was the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten!

This is an excellent cake! 
I brew the coffee double strength. Somehow, the coffee does not impart a mocha flavor; it just heightens the intensity of the chocolate flavor. 
I have made this recipe exactly as written many times, and it always gets rave reviews. 
I have also experimented to reduce the fat and sugar. You can make the following changes without sacrificing taste or texture:.  
Reduce sugar to 1 1/2 cups
Reduce oil to 1/4 cup.  Add 3 Tablespoons plain Greek yogurt (I’ve used nonfat and 2% Greek yogurt, with no discernible difference)

Made it with 1/2 cup almond milk and 1/2 cashew yogurt instead of 1 cup milk. I also used 1 rounded and full teaspoon of instant coffee in 1/2 cup water with 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of just one cup hot coffee. This turned out great. It was moist and rich but not too rich.  I'm at a higher altitude and mine kinda caved in a tiny tiny bit but no biggie. I found I had to bake it for 5-10 minutes longer (so it takes around 30-35 minutes).

Absolutely delicious. Packed with flavour,  light and not too sweet. I baked this for my son's birthday. It's his new favourite cake. My only mistake was topping it with the Fudge Frosting found on this site, which proved to be too heavy for the cake. So we learn.

It's amazing tasting cake! It's very moist and has like a soft spongy like texture all in a good way. I made an adjustment to make it healthier even. I replaced the sugar with molasses. You can't tell the difference. I love hazel nuts to not to make it healthy just cause  I love them it's as really awesome recipe. You must make it!

The batter was quite thin, and it took me 50 minutes to bake it. However, the flavour was great and since I like my cakes a little less sweet, I cut the amount of sugar by a half cup and the sweetness in the cake ended up being just right.
However, I'll probably think twice before making this cake again cause it was quite moist and kept sticking to the base!

I made it exactly as written. It was probably WORST chocolate cake I have ever made. It came out more like a brownie and there was no real flavor to it. Just very blah. None of us liked it. (Even with really good frosting on it. ;-) and that will usually save anything. LOL.) Rest of it went into the garbage. It wasn't worth dirtying the dishes to make it.

I made this cake for a birthday party, everyone raved about this cake! I had one teeny piece left to take home and enjoyed it all by myself at a leisurely pace.

Great recipe for homemade chocolate cake.  The result was very rich and moist.  I ended up sifting the flour in because I didn't want to over mix the batter.  Mine stayed in the oven about 32 minutes and were perfect!

I love this cake.  Since I live at high altitude it works great with the high altitude instructions.  I make a buttercream frosting with very strong coffee as the liquid.  My husband wants only this cake.

Soft fluffy cake. A bit on the crumbly side but delicious nonetheless. I iced mine with a coffee infused chocolate buttercream but I would have enjoyed this cake more bare with a sprinkle of powder sugar.

Got the munchies and wanted chocolate cake. This recipe was great! My roommate hates coffee and he loved it. I made a salted chocolate cream cheese icing to go with it. Didn't wait for it to cool before forcing it out of the pan. This is amazing cake.

This was a lovely chocolate cake. I used half the sugar, and baked it in a ring tin. It had a nice texture. I didn't bother getting and electric mixer out, just mixed it with a whisk and spatula and it turned out fine. An easy and quick recipe that I will use again.

I cannot stress enough the importance of STRONG brewed coffee.  My mother owns her own bakery and told me this trick quite a while ago.  Coffee brings out the flavor of the chocolate so you want to use good coffee for it.  Personally I use a strong made cup of Folgers.  About 1/4c coffee to 8c of water for the brew to give you guys an idea.  Don't use that instant coffee .  Personally I probably could have made it stronger to make the flavor more intense, I'll be trying it with a new espresso maker that I have coming in.  Cake turned out awesome, super moist and the chocolate flavor was just like the home made cakes I'd had as a kid.  I believe I had to bake it a bit longer than directed but I prefer having the shorter time frame so that I can keep an eye on the cake.  What will ruin a chocolate cake every time is over baking it.  That's another thing that will make it lose its flavor.

Made exactly as recipe said, was very good, moist and chocolatey but not overly.  Filled up a 9x13 dish beautifully.  Will certainly make again.

I made this cake, but added more sugar (1 cup lite Brown)
and a pack of chocolate pudding powder.  
Wonderfully fluffy  and moist with tons of flavor.

I've made this twice now and my family loves it!  The only thing I've changed is: I made it in a 9x13 pan and baked it for about 55 minutes.   Very easy cake to throw together.  I don't think I'll ever buy another chocolate cake mix.

10.09.16 ~ What a delicious and moist chocolate cake. My MIL taught me years ago that coffee makes every chocolate cake better. I am not a huge chocolate cake eater, but my husband is - and we both enjoyed this cake. It had a nice richness without the bitterness. I frosted with 'Maple Buttercream Frosting' from AR. The frosting was a great balance with the cake. This is a company worthy cake and one that I will make again.

Delish as is, things to try: change out 1C sugar for 1C brown sugar...oh its lovely...bakes up well with 1 duck egg..instad of 2 chicken..lowering sugar to 3/4 C white and 3/4 C brown gives it a wonderful taste not quiate as sharp on the sweet....This is my only chocolate cake now :)

I used 1.5 cups of sugar and it was sweet enough.  I also made it in square dishes as I did not have 2 round ones - turned out fine. I used a choc buttercream icing, but I would like to make it again with a cream cheese style icing. Great cake, will definitely make again.

This is a a very good, moist cake. Very similar to a wacky cake (one without eggs).  I used dark cocoa powder as I am out of regular and frosted with a ganache made from semi sweet chips.  Very chocolately!  It did take about 40 min to bake in regular metal pans.  I had a bit of a difficulty getting the cake out of the pans.  But, that could just be my pans or a combo of pans and really moist cake.  Overall my family liked it and I will be making in again.

I baked this cake for my son's birthday, and everyone loved it.  The cake has a lot of chocolate flavor and was very moist.   Since I did not have any hot brewed coffee on hand, the baker at King Arthur Flour told me I could replace it with 1 Tablespoon of Espresso Powder with 1 cup of water.   Would definitely make this again!

I like this chocolate cake recipe. It's easy, not time consuming, and it tastes good. I don't like too sweet , so I only used one cup of sugar. The recipe can be easily modified. Next time I will add pecans or raisins.

I made this for my son's birthday cake for school. I was voted "the best cake doer" and "the best cake maker" from his 2nd grade class. It was delicious. I made a candy bar cake by icing it and putting kit Kats around the cake and put m&ms, caramel bits, Hershey kisses, mini Hershey's white candy bars on top. It turned out great and delicious.

Amazingly delicious!!! Makes about 45 mini cupcakes but we overfilled them a little so more like mini muffins?? we paired with Chocolate Sour Cream Frosting from this website. Most broke in half when I tried to take them out of the pan cause we didn't have any liners so I put icing in the middle and stuck them together?? DO NOT SKIP THE COFFEE I am not a coffee lover but this didn't taste like it at all! I used a medium roast coffee. Delicious moist and yummy tastes like you cheated and made a instant cake!!

Perfect! I was looking for a cake to make for my daughter's birthday party and this was exactly what I wanted. I made the cake exactly as is, and it was moist and delicious. I added chocolate frosting, but next time I will use vanilla.

Yes I doubled the recipe and added an extra tsp of vanilla and I also added an extra half a cup of vegetable oil. The cake was very moist and you can mess it up .

This recipe creates the most awesome cake!  I followed recipe amounts substituting cake flour for the AP, and unsalted, butter for the oil, as these are what on hand. Plus i cut  the sugar to 1 1/4 cups instead of the two called for, we thought it was penty sweet, especially when paired with a chocolate buttercream frosting. I have been searching for a cake recipe from scratch that would produce a moist, light, fluffy cake (i hate dense baked goods) and this is by Far the best scratch recipe i have ever used! It will be my number one cake recipe from now on ! I am thinking i could use this recipe for other flavors, that is my next baking project- adapting these ingredients seeing if i can turn this into a multi use go to batter.  For new bakers this recipe is a definite must, it's very forgiven with great results, what more could any baker want to boost their confidence. Instant gratification!

I have mixed feelings about this cake. The first time I made it I baked it in a 13x9 inch pan. It overflowed all over my oven. In spite of that, it was delicious in the end. Today I made it in 2 8 inch layers, but put it on a cookie sheet, just in case. It is currently in the oven and has overflowed the pans again. What am I doing wrong? I can only hope that the cake ends up cooked and edible. I followed the recipe as it was written.

I had to cook this so much longer than the recipe instruction states; maybe because I used a narrow tin and the middle took ages to cook. It was getting very brown on top so I covered it in foil to cook it further without burning it. It was worth the wait. Absolutely delicious, dangerously delicious! I ended up giving some away as I knew I could easily eat the lot in one day!! I halved the ingredients and used a little less liquid plus I covered it with creamy chocolate frosting. Will make again when I crave that chocolate hit - was as good if not better that a professional cake.

This was fantastic. So wonderfully moist, which lasted for days! I can't wait to make again. I went light on the strength of the coffee, I didn't want to overwhelm the cake with an all coffee flavor, but I barely even tasted it. However, when I make it again, I will increase the strength of the coffee just a bit. Of course this is my preference. This is definitely my go to cake!

This cake is incredibly quick and easy to prep (compared to other scratch cakes). Since it is oil-based, it is the perfect cake to make if you are trying to surprise someone sleeping in the same house; you can make this cake very quietly without an electric mixer. It is very moist and delicious, and doesn't stick to the pan like other butter-based cakes that seem to take a lot more work. I frosted it with vanilla buttercream frosting by doing a "crumb coat" first since the crumbs are very dark (i.e., thinly frosting the cake, freezing it a little, and then frosting it thickly once the crumb coat hardened somewhat). My office thought the cake was very delicious and every crumb was gone in minutes!

This is an excellent cake, just like the one that my grandmother use to make.
I did add 1 cup of buttermilk and very strong coffee.
I baked it in a bundt pan which took about 50 minutes.
This one is a keeper. Thank you

Wow, the topping was perfect.
You can add some chopped walnuts or almond in the batter.

This was possibly the best all around chocolate cake I have ever made. And I have made many. It was easy, it popped right out of the cake pan and was delicious. The only thing missing was the frustration that often accompanies baking cakes! I did leave out the coffee and replaced it with sour cream.

MMMMMMMMM!! So tasty! Although I don't like coffee in my cakes, so instead I used Sour Cream. Turned out GREAT! I used it in the Betty Crocker ice cream cake thingy. I used Butter Pecan ice cream. YUMMMMM! :) :) :) :)
