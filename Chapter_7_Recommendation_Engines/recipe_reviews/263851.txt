It was actually pretty good.  I added a tiny amount of vanilla flavoring.  I ate them with strawberries and whipped heavy cream.

I had no yogurt so I left it out.  Also left out the flax seed. I used whole milk instead of water and honey instead of stevia. Tasted good. Will make again.

I have made coconut flour pancakes before but these are the best so far. I want dairy free recipes so I changed the water and yogurt to coconut milk, added 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar and a little more coconut flour just to give enough thickness to the batter as needed.
