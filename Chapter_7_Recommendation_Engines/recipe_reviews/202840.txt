I had high hopes for these. But the dough was too stiff and the flavor was too salty. I had to add 1/3c of almond milk to be able to spread the dough on the pan. Maybe it's because I used greek yougurt. I used agave syrup for sugar and grapeseed oil for butter. Overall I like the ingredients and the pancakes are very filling, so maybe I'll give them another try with less salt and the extra liquid.

These were very good, however I did add some vanilla extract and some agave nectar. Otherwise I left everything the same. Very filling and yummy!

Very good! I didn't have any almond flour at home, so I used 2c of all-purpose flour - will try with whole wheat next time. I also added chopped strawberries. The consistency was strange, so I was afraid that the pancakes wouldn't cook well. BUT, they turned out great! Nice and fluffy, good flavor. Thanks for posting!

My husband and I really enjoyed these! Used all-purpose white flour instead of the almond flour (didn't have any.) Fluffy and yummy!

I personally like to make my pancakes with raw/turdinado sugar. It adds a better flavor and a little bit of crunch!

Love these pancakes! Made a few changes successfully. Substituted fresh milled whole wheat for all purpose flour, sucanat for sugar,coconut oil for butter and just because I didn't have any yogurt, buttermilk for the yogurt. For the buttermilk use just a little more than half of the recommended yogurt.

These had great flavor and texture, but I had to add more liquid to get them to be more pancake like.  The batter was very thick and wouldn't spread out on the griddle.  I used almond milk  to thin my batter a bit.  I also added a touch of vanilla and didn't use as much salt as called for.  Personal tastes I guess.  Oh, i also used a gluten free flour instead of all purpose which may account for the thickness.  I loved the yogurt and they were light and tasty.  I will definately add this to my recipe box to use again.  With fresh strawberries and whipped cream, they were a nice anniversary breakfast item.  Thank you Samie.  These were much better than my previous almond flour pancakes.

Made these this morning...wonderful...so big and fluffy...I added almond extract and substituted Agave Sweetner for the sugar...a better recipe for diabetics...I bake and cook with almond flour and agave all the time...most recipes you can switch out 1/2 the flour with almond flour and agave for the sugar.  You don't need as much it is sweeter than sugar...Great recipe!

This was a great recipe.  The pancakes were light and tender.  I have tried dozens of recipes and this is in my top 5.  I will be making these again.  I did make some changes.  
1 c whole sprouted whole wheat flour,
1 c almond flour,
1.5 c raw whole milk yogurt,
.5 c yogurt whey (when ever I strain yogurt I collect the whey to use int he future),
2 eggs,
1 tbsp raw pastured butter,
1 tsp baking soda,
1.5 tsp baking powder,
1 tbsp sucanat sugar,
1 tsp vanilla,
Dash of cinnamon,
.5 tsp kosher salt.  
I let the mixture rest for 1 hour before cooking.  I used coconut oil on the griddle just because butter tends to burn and I didn't have any ghee. We had them with some fresh homemade butter and grade B maple syrup.  YUM!

My family really likes this recipe. The only thing we change is to use Greek yogurt instead of low-fat plain yogurt. One other thing to note, these take longer to bake than regular pancakes. I found it helpful to put a lid on our electric skillet.

Delicious and very fluffy! A great base recipe that you can spruce up however you like! I did make a few  changes. The yogurt I had on hand was Icelandic yogurt, which is more sour than your average yogurt, and the consistency of Greek yogurt. Because of that, I used just under a cup of  yogurt, and made up the difference with plain kefir. I also used more sugar than the recipe called for. I didn't measure, but it was about 2 Tbsp. I added about a tsp of vanilla extract, as well. I also used just under the cup of all purpose flour, and used about 1/4 c of wheat bran, to add some fiber and nutritional content. After making the first few, and finding that they were very fluffy, but still pretty tart, I added a mashed banana. It added a bit of moisture and sweetness, and they were perfect after that. I would suggest trying them before doing that. If you use regular yogurt and not Icelandic, they should be sweet enough without the banana, but with a slightly tart edge, like buttermilk pancakes. They do not bubble up as much and start to dry on the top side like regular wheat pancakes, so flip as soon as you see the edges taking shape. I love that the almond flour is low carb, and higher in fat and protein, and I feel less sluggish after these that all wheat pancakes, as a result. Thank you for a great, simple recipe!

Made a few changes by using coconut flour and cake flour. also used lactose free yogurt 6 oz and remaining non dairy yogurt drink by Califa.  Sprinked cinnamon in the dry mix with date syrup in liquid for sweetener. My new go to pancake recipe..thank you for the inspiration with yogurt rather than milk (non dairy of course)

My husband & I really loved these Pancakes.  I am a new diabetic and also new to using almond flour. I was overjoyed at the taste & texture and I followed the recipe as written.  I am so very happy that even though I have to watch my carbs that I can still eat pancakes...oh  I did thin the batter just a little with a splash of unsweetened almond milk... I feel these are a keeper and will be making them often !!!!!

Really fluffy. A good compromise with half almond flour and half regular flour. Used regular 2% yogurt. Husband asked for more but only made half the amount since it's only 2 of us.

All in all, this recipe was a success in our house. My husband and I really liked them and my kids thought they were tolerable,  which I count as a success! My son is type 1 diabetic, so I'm always looking for lower carb recipes, so this was great for that. I added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract for extra flavor and swapped the 1 T. of sugar for 1.5 tsp. of stevia. I sprinkled unsweetened coconut flakes on top of mine and served with a little maple syrup & blueberries...a keeper!

I used grape seed oil instead of butter and whole milk yogurt, but kept everything else the same. Since the batter is not as runny as regular pancake batter, I could fit 4 pancakes easily on my frying pan without them touching each other, so it made the whole process much faster. They are very yummy!

I used coconut oil instead of butter and used a 1/2 cup less yogurt but added 1/2 cup of milk because I used the thick Greek yogurt. Also cut the salt in half and they were plenty salty.  True that you have to shape these by hand somewhat because they are too thick to spread out over the pan.  They were tasty.

This recipe worked just fine for me. I tweaked it just a bit by adding both blueberries and strawberries. If you are hesitant about only using almond flour, a great way to ease into it is to simply split your traditional pancake mix 50/50 with almond flour.
