Delicious! My husband and I made this and served it over linguine. The sauce is just awesome-capers add a touch of salt and the red pepper gives it a nice kick. I added some white wine before I put the mussels in the pot. This is a new favorite! Thanks.

Excellent dish!  I especially enjoyed dipping some toasted bread in the sauce.  I didn't have capers so I substituted chopped dill pickles and it worked out great.

These were great and absolutely delicious. I found when I made them there was not a lot of sauce, not sure if it was me or the recipe. Next time I may try to make extra sauce.

Great recipe.  Added 1/4 cup white wine to saut√©ed onions and garlic.  Used 2 lbs of mussels - plenty of sauce!  Served as main course for 2 people with garlic bread.

Fantastic! I served this with toasted french bread- everyone loved it! This was first time cooking live mussels so I did a little research- so glad I did! I soaked them some water for 15-20 minutes, drained and rinsed them- the did that 3 more times. A reviewer said it could do with more sauce so I used 5 cups instead of 3 and added more garlic and seasoning. I also added some sweet white wine. This is a keeper!

This was my first attempt at making mussels! It was absolutely delicious! The best mussels I have every had for sure. I followed the recipe all most to the tea just omitted the capers since we aren't big fans! The recipe was so easy as well!! Definitely will be making this again.

This is a keeper. I used a bit more garlic and threw in a handful of medium seared scallops to make it more of a meal. Serve with plenty of Italian bread for dipping and a Merlot wine. Enjoy! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very tasty, but I feel that it needed white wine to really zing.  The capers were a nice touch...

This is so good.  I had picked up precooked frozen mussels at the supermarket because I had a craving for them and there weren't any fresh.  I had no idea what I was going to do since my usual recipe needs the liquor the mussels release during cooking.  I came upon this and was very happy since I had everything it needed in my pantry.  I substituted canned diced tomatoes for some of the tomato sauce but kept everything else exactly the same.  I served this over angel hair pasta and it was a huge hit.  My boyfriend says I am always allowed to get mussels if I cook this dish.  Just the right amount of spice and flavor that doesn't overwhelm the mussels.  Just a perfect dish.  My craving for mussels is satisfied until tomorrow when I'm going to want more of this.

Great way to jazz up regular red sauce by sauteeing the capers, shallots, and garlic first.  The red pepper flakes gave it a terrific kick.  I used pre-cooked, frozen mussles that made the recipe even easier and still delicious!  So quick and easy and still yummy!

I always eat mussels out but this was the first time I made them and they were absolutely delish! I did not have capers but added just a touch of salt and added in some fire roasted peppers. I took a chance, we had company over and made this dish, I got many compliments!

This recipe is amazing! The only thing I'm wondering about is how do you get 4 servings out of 1lb of mussels? The only size I can get is 2-2 1/2 lb basket. So, I did a little tweaking. I kept the amounts relatively the same. More onion & garlic coz that's the way I roll. To up the volume I added a 1/2 cup of diced tomato I had left over from dinner last night & a cup of white wine that I'm drinking right now. It smoothed out a little. Interesting how twice the recipe was just enough for me & my boyfriend. The recipe was a huge success. Thanks ever so much KitchenWitch!

This was just awesome!  I made a couple of tweaks...barely tweaks, actually  :).  I didn't have scallions, so left them out.  I was also out of tomato sauce so used a pint of fresh grape tomatoes, just mashed.  I also didn't have fresh mussels...hmm, a shopping trip soon, perhaps?  lol.  I used frozen on the half shell mussels, instead.  The end result was SO DELICIOUS!.  I served it over some thin pasta and the juices just wrapped themselves around every strand.  This will be a go to meal again and again.  Thanjks for the recipe!  I also didn't have any italian seasoning, so just sprinkled some basil, oregano, salt and pepper.  Truly, one of the best meals I've cooked!

First time making it! It was a hit! I doubled the recipe, and did add 1/4cup white wine to the tomato sauce as well as pork (just for flavor). I didn't really taste the red pepper, so I would add more if you like the "kick"

This recipe is fantastic! And quick and easy to make if you are using mussels that are bearded and cleaned. I added a little pasta sauce Bertolli fire roasted red pepper with cab since I could not find a decent cab and was pressed for time. I also added shiraz and skipped the capers. My friend who tried mussels for the first time that day LOVED the sauce. Mussels are still a little weird for her ;) I loved these. Delicious and easy-a quick appetizer for guests or for you. Yum!!!

I made this for Valentine's Day and it was stellar.  My fiance really enjoyed the tomato sauce that had a little spicy bite.  This is definitely a repeat.

Made these for dinner last night -- my husband couldn't stop raving. I've never made mussels before so was a little nervous but it was super-easy. Followed the recipe exactly and sopped up the extra sauce with crusty bread. With a small salad on the side it was a perfect, quick, at-home dinner. Will definitely be making these again.

OK..I love mussels and this meal was tastey, but it was soooo messy!  I had 4lbs of mussles from Costco.  Being land locked the mussles were not the greatest.  The sauce was tastey and I made french bread to dip.  Not sure I'll make this again because of the mess.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was d-e-licious! I added a 14oz. can of tomatoes, just to create a little more texture. It was super tasty and I highly recommend it! :)

I have made mussels in various ways but this by far is the tastiest! Add extra red pepper flakes if you want to increase the heat. Make sure to have some crusty bread inhand and the sauce is magnificent for calamari dipping  Cheers!

This was AWESOME!  The only change I made was I did not use the green onions as garnish, and  I cut the Mussels in half and added a half-pound of shrimp.  This would go well with any pasta and any seafood.

Average,  I ended up using white wine, fresh parsley and I had some of my own tomatoes from last summer. The sauce was very good by itself, but I felt the mussels somehow did not unite as well as they should with the sauce....sounds weird but that was my take.

Be sure to have some bread on hand because this makes a lot of sauce. Unfortunately, I didn't have any bread but I did have linguine, so I served it over that. The mussels and the sauce tasted great. I'm in love with these love mussels!

Became a member just to review this recipe.  My husband and I both love mussels and order them at every opportunity.  I made these with a little trepidation, know that the bar for mussels was very high.  We all loved them, including my son who had never had mussels before.  My husband says they are better than the restaurant.  This recipe is a definite keeper. I followed the recipe as written, however did not measure the shallots or garlic.  I used a whole shallot and three cloves of garlic.  It was perfect.  Only regret was that I had not served a crispy Italian loaf for dipping.  When the mussels were gone my husband ate the rest of the sauce with a spoon.  It was that good! Should also be noted that I used 3 lbs of mussels and there was still plenty of sauce.

I improvised a few ingredients. Instead of tomato sauce, I used a can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of tomato paste and 1.5 cups of moscato/ white wine. All other ingredients from this recipe were used. OMG..... It was amazing! Oh, and I purchased pre cooked mussels in frozen food aisle. Cooked sauce for 5 minutes, threw in mussels on low heat, stirred, 5 minutes total. It doesn't get any simpler than this.

It was yummy! Used frozen mussels since they were on sale and added a big can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce. I am sure it would be fantastic either way. Wonderful over pasta. The capers added a great lemony bite and are a must try if you are skeptical!

I got mussels for $4 for 2# today--so looked here and found this recipe. I used my home canned Italian tomato sauce from this summer and added white wine. Had capers in my pantry. Served it over gluten free pasta. So good. Will be serving this again.

Loved this..I didn't have red pepper flakes on hand  or italian seasoning so I mixed my own seasonings. I also added shrimp to the recipe and it turned out delish.  My family is fond of sweet sauces so next time I think I may add a pinch of sugar as well as a splash of cream and see how it turns out.

I live on the ocean, and went snorkeling for the mussels... so they were wonderfully fresh and HUGE!  I served this over angel hair pasta, and the broth was absolutely super!  I am not sure what all the fuss about debearding mussels is.. we just yank them off when we pluck them off the rocks.

This was delicious, we had never made mussels before and were nervous but it turned out very well.  The hardest part was just making sure the mussels were still alive and debearding them, otherwise it was a very easy and delicious recipe.  I especially like that it did not require any strange ingredients that I would just end up having to throw out.

It was good. Like Julia said all right, but nothing spectacular. I made garlic bread with it. Which it was a really good sauce for dipping, lots of extra. I think if I did it again I'd toss it with linguine noodles. I did add diced tomatoes when I put in the mussells. Otherwise, I kept it the same.

This was all right -- nothing particularly wrong with the recipe, but nothing spectacular either. Although I'd say, a dash of cream or some cheese might have gave the dish an ooomph to make it five stars. Also, I felt that 1 tbsp of Italian seasoning was WAY too overwhelming. The juices from the mussels did give the leftover tomato sauce a delicious savory flavour.
