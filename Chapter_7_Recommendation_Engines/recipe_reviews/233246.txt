This was my first try at cooking quinoa, and I am a convert!!
I did saute some diced zucchini and red onion first, which I added to the quinoa and some veggie broth as in step 1.
(I tasted it at the end of 15 minutes... and I could have eaten it all right then!)
I followed the rest of the recipe as written, topping with bread crumbs rather than panko (dear hubby shopping foul noted). 
In the end, a satisfying and healthy new comfort food!

I added broccoli to mine, and mixed red quinoa with regular quinoa. I also used a montery jack and cheddar mix without the processed cheese.  Was super tasty.  This was my first time cooking with quinoa.  The technique is very similar to cooking rice.  I will definitely cook this again.

This was BLAND and nearly tasteless, even though I'd used a pepper jack velveeta.
