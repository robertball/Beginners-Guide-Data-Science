What a nice combination of flavors, and to think it starts with a can of cinnamon-y apple pie filling...how easy is that???  The cheddar is sharp, but itâ€™s mellowed out by the ricotta resulting in a mild cheesy creamy  filling that doesn't take anything away from the apple flavor.  The only thing that I would do differently in the future is cut the salt in half.  We enjoyed this both warm and cold.  Nice change  for a quick-and-easy  dessert.

It had a very nice flavor. I was skeptical that the apple pie filling and cheddar would clash, but I was wrong. The only problem is that there is definitely too much salt in the crumb topping.

I really wanted to like this.  I really loved the idea, but we found that the crust was pasty, the filling was bland, the topping  was way too salty, and the cheese  was non existent.  We could barely finish our first pieces and the rest went into the trash.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2016. I adjusted the ingredients for 4 people and it came out beautifully. My husband loves Apple Pie with Cheddar Cheese and when I found this, I knew I had to make it.
 I had never made a homemade pie crust before, but it really kicked it up a notch. At first I was skeptical that the amount of crumb topping wouldn't be enough, but as it cooked and combined with the cheese, it was just right. I sprayed the top with Olive Oil non stick spray and it really helped the topping get that beautiful golden brown I was looking for.
I was especially surprised that the can of pie filling was so good. Not too sweet and perfect for any occasion.
