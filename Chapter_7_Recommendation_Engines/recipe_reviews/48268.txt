Yum!  Very easy, if you don't do the stupid things I did!  1. READ the instructions all the way through.  My first inclination was to drain them on paper towels.  My first (albeit very very small) batch has tiny paper towel pieces stuck to them.  2. Don't use a SMALL saucepan.  That's a good way to start your kitchen on fire (I really really didn't burn anything down, I promise).  Other than that, easy recipe, delicious snack!!  Thanks!

***  UPDATE - I made these on Sunday and they were fabulous.  On Tuesday, I had a few of the leftovers.  Not so fabulous!  Be sure to make small batches, what you can eat in one or two days.  Beyond that, not so great!  I guess these won't be part of my Christmas gift baskets this year =(

"Oh my goodness, these are so stinkin good!"  I am so happy I came across this recipe today.  It makes for a nice little snack.  As there are 4 cups of walnuts in a pound, I only used 1 cup walnuts and 1/4 cup sugar.  It would be dangerous to have too many of these around!  I will remember this recipe for the holidays.  Thank you Valerie for sharing your recipe!

These were so easy and so addicting. Instead of frying them, I placed them on a baking sheet and baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.

These are so very much like a nationally known  brand of "Glazed Walnuts", but, without the sesame seeds.  Thanks for the posting and the money savings!

Highly recommended!! This reminds me of the walnuts that come with sweet fried shrimps that is my husband's favorite at Chinese restaurant. Figuring out the temperature and how long to keep the nuts in the oil was a bit of challenge but I learned after the first batch. This is a great appetizer and very easy and fast to make. Five stars!

Since I'm not very experienced in deep frying my first batch burned because I had the oil too hot but anything after that came out great! Thanks for the recipe

Absolutely delicious! Seriously, my family went crazy for these! Very simple to make, just make sure you watch them in the oil because they do burn easily. My first batch burned when I cooked them for the recommended 4 minutes. The goal is so achieve a golden brown color. Additional tip: they're great when paired with spinach salads, apples, cheese, fried shrimp, oatmeal, and stir-frys!

I've been making these for years.  They are excellent and well received as a gift.  Easy to make but be careful they brown up very quickly.

Just finished a batch and Yum! I was so happy to find these--my mom made them every New Year's but we both lost the recipe long ago. 

The nuts do burn easily. Mine cooked in half the time listed over a very modest medium heat. The salt is optional, but I recommend it because it adds a nice bit of zing. Thanks so much for sharing this! Can't wait to send the recipe off to Mom.

These were a big hit at a recent family party. I doubled the recipe and used half walnuts and half pecans. Think I liked the walnuts better, but both were very good. Thanks for the recipe!

This is very good.  I sprinkle toasted sesame seeds when ready to serve.  Make sure you watch the walnuts, for they burn pretty fast. I didn't add salt though.

My Grandma made these for every holiday and family get together! they are hands down the BEST food, snack, appetizer or whatever you want to call them.  Just be sure to fry them long enough or they wont have enough crunch! test one walnut at a time until you find the right fry time then do in small batches.  I like extra salt but either way you cant go wrong!

I HAVE MADE THESE NUTS FOR 20 YEARS AFTER A NEIGHBOR GAVE ME THE RECIPE FOR CHRISTMAS. NEVER DRAIN THEM ON PAPER TOWELS BECAUSE OF THE SUGAR THEY WILL STICK AND MAKE A MESS. I OPEN PAPER BAGS AND DRAIN THEM ON THAT AND IF I DON'T HAVE PAPER BAGS I USE SEVERAL LAYERS OF NEWS PRINT. AFTER COOLING I STORE MINE IN A ZIP LOCK BAG AND THEY LAST SEVERAL WEEKS IF THEY STAY AROUND THAT LONG!

When I mentioned walnuts the other day my husband said "oh, I haven't had Chinese Candied Walnuts in a very long time."  I remembered them from the Chinese restaurants in NYC when I was a kid a lifetime ago so I came here to look for a recipe. These are the real deal and took me back to my childhood. We both LOVED them.  I did make a mistake with the first batch by using a cast iron skillet which got too hot. I also laid them out on paper towel to drain all the excess oil off.  Oh what a mistake that was. They stuck immediately...lol.  I made the second batch in my stainless still skillet and paid attention to directions. Put them on a cookie sheet or plate. When they cooled off completely I transferred them to a layer of paper towel and patted the excess oil off with no sticking issues.  This is a great recipe exactly as written.  Thank you very much!!!!

So easy. Per the suggestion of another reviewer I baked for 15 minutes at 400 degrees rather than frying. Maybe not as tasty as deep fried but healthier and not as messy. Don't forget the salt. I'll experiment with various spices next.

I never heard of these before and thought I would give try. OMG, my husband wouldn't stay out of them. Cookies nag times are fine, I did about 4 minutes a batch. I will definitely make again, probably many times!
