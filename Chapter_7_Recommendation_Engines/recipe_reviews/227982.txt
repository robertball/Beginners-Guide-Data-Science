I don't normally keep blocks of decent chocolate on hand so I substituted Nestlé Premier White Morsels for the white chocolate and a 4oz bar of Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet for the dark chocolate. I also used regular Skippy peanut butter. This recipe turned out beautifully and is absolutely delicious. Will be making this for many years to come!

If you love peanut butter, what’s not to like? Not sure I used 5oz of chocolate.  I had melted milk chocolate leftover from another use and just used what I had.

I Really Loved This Recipe For The Tiger Butter Chocolate. It Is Really Good! The Only Think I Would Recommend Doing Differently Is... In Stead Of Using A Butter Knife To Make The Marble Pattern. I Would Recommend Using A Double Sided Tooth Pick Because, When I Make This Recipe I Made two Patches Because The First Pattern Didn't Turn Out Right And I Needed A Perfect Patch For A Class Of Mine :)So For My First Patch When I Went To Make The Pattern I Used A Butter Knife The Pattern Didn't Turn Out. So I Decided To Try The Tooth Pick And It Came Out Perfect :) Very Happy :)

I also substituted the white baking chocolate for the Premier White Morsels and used the Reese's Peanut Butter. It was very easy to make and everyone loved it! I will add this to my have to have list!

Heavenly!  I've made this twice and have gotten maybe 2 pieces.  My family quickly devoured this.  Easy to make and turns out well however you make it.

This turned out SO GOOD!  I used white chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate, and it worked out great.  Can't wait to make again.  SO EASY and SO delicious.

This is melt in your mouth good! I only had 4 ounces of white chocolate, so I only made a quarter of the recipe, which worked out great! This is so quick and easy, perfect to make for a late night chocolate fix!

My daughter and I jist made this recipe for my wife. I used milk chocolate instead of dark. The only thing I would really change about this recipe is I would use less peanut butter. 1/2 a cup would likely be plenty.

I have made this twice now and I forgot that the first time I made it I had planned to use non natural peanut butter the next time and I used Adams natural peanut butter again the second time. This peanut butter has a more powdery texture because it is natural. I think this recipe would be better with jif non natural because it would not have the powdery texture to it.

I made it with Nestle Premier White chips and Hershey Milk Chocolate chips.  Delicious and well received by others.
