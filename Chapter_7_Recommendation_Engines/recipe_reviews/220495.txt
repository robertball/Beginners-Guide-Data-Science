My family has made this recipe since I was a kid but the cookies can be difficult to find.  They are called Famous Chocolate Wafers by Nabisco.  They come in a Yellow rectangular box and are usually found on the top shelf in the cookie aisle or with the ice cream toppings.  Sometimes they are only available around the holidays.  The frosted cookies are laid on their side in a long row and then the whole thing is frosted with more whipped cream.  This does not work with Cool Whip!  It won't soak into the cookies to make the cake-like filling.  This recipe is usually a dessert that the kids help with.  They make the stacks of frosted cookies and put them on a plate and I put the cookies on a platter in a row. I save any broken cookies and crush them to sprinkle on the top.  We always called this Holiday Log.  YUM!

My Mom and Dad were married just before WWII.  Mom made this cake all the time.  My sister and I loved it!  It is so easy to make.  The cookies turn into cake in the frig.  Yum!

I can't explain why this simple cake is so good, but it just is!   Don't question it!    I made the original version but sprinkled Starbucks instant coffee over the top instead of grated chocolate.  REALLY yummy.   For variety the 2nd time around, I used Trader Joe's Cookie Thins which are also a wafer cookie just like the chocolate Nabiscos, but they come in different flavors like lemon and coconut.   The coconut crisp wafers are buttery and light and make a superb version of this cake.   Something so good is usually not this simple.   I'm lovin' it.

My recently deceased mother in law used to make this. It made me nostalgic for her wonderful Sunday dinners.  I am going to surprise my husband as soon as I can get the wafers.  It sounds exactly like her delicious recipe which I had forgotten. Thank you!

For those who have trouble finding the wafers, they are called Famous Chocolate Wafers.  A quick Google search turned up online ordering sources and a ubiquitous BigBox store beginning with W.  They are made by the Kraft food company.
King Arthur Flour has a recipe for homemade wafers.

I never knew this was called zebra cake! Thanks for sharing! This recipe was recently featured in a magazine, but it was done in stacks of 5 cookies, with fruit neatly displayed on top..a very nice and easier-to-serve variation!

I recently watched a video here on allrecipes about how this recipe came about. I totally set out to make it when I came across the chocolate wafer cookies. What a great and easy plea-z recipe. While I thought the vanilla extract was just a tad to much, that's fine because after it sits and melds with the cookies. It should mellow out some. Thanks for sharing this way. I love making fresh whip topping.

I used "World Table Chocolate Cookie Thins" found at Wal-Mart, and they worked perfectly. I also plan to experiment with different flavored World Table cookies (lemon, chocolate mint and chocolate caramel) and different extracts in the whipping cream like almond, peppermint and lemon. This is a creamy dessert that isn't too sweet.

This was my mom's go-to special occasion dessert. We loved it! It's now my kids' favorite. At Christmas, I used peppermint extract in the whipped cream and garnished with crushed peppermint candies. I recently found the choc wafers near ice cream cones and toppings at the grocery store...

My mom made this a few times when I was young. I had all but forgotten it until one day quite a few years ago, a vague memory popped into my head. I went searching for the cookies that she might have used and found them on the top shelf at the grocery store. I knew they were the right ones because the recipe is still on the box. It is such a quick and easy dessert. Perfect for those who are baking challenged or those who just want to make something quick and easy. Easy enough for a weeknight dinner but  the presentation is also nice enough for company. I have made this with thawed, frozen whipped topping and it turned out just fine. Thanks for the memories.

There is really nothing to change in this recipe for authenticity as far as the original goes, nor anything to change to make it better. You do not use gross, fake cool whip, though. It must be whipping cream that you whip. And once itâ€™s assembled, it goes in the freezer, because then it slices like an ice cream cake. Vanilla tastes good in whipped cream, so the amount called for is correct. And finally, it cannot be bitter...unless your whipped cream went bad, lol. THAT will make it bitter, for sure (and that would be gross).

Simply delicious!  We normally add almond extract or mint extract (orange or lemon, you get the idea) to the whip cream.

So easy and so delicious! I make it just as written and there's never a crumb left! But my one daughter doesn't like chocolate so I made a few with vanilla wafers for her and they were pretty good too. I'm a chocaholic, so I will always prefer the original recipe but for those, like my daughter, who either don't like it or are allergic to it, the vanilla wafers offer a good alternative, though I think I will flavor the whipped cream next time to give it a bit more flavor since it's missing the richness of the chocolate.

Easy, attractive, fun, and tasty! I enjoyed that it wasn't too sweet; however, one family member would have preferred a sweeter whipped cream and commented that the chocolate wafers didn't provide much of a chocolatey flavor.

I think I am the only reviewer who didn't like this.  Maybe it was the chocolate wafers I used but the cake was so bitter we couldn't eat it.  There was nothing sweet about this recipe.

Lol... for all the mystery surrounding the coveted 
WAFFER COOKIES...I am going to kill their specialness, right now. And they are expensive for the little box.
I love this whipped dream cake and make it all the time using Nabisco Chocolate Graham Crackers...the exact same flavor. I use an 8 oz tub of cool whip, throw in some chopped cherries out of a jar and layer one packet of them. Always put the cream on the bottom....Crush a few extras for topping effect...and voila. It is not as cute in a flat pan and it needs 3 DAYS IN THE FRIDGE, to soften....use  loaf or flat square pan.
Serve it in squares and no one will notice the difference. Enjoy!

if you can't find the chocolate wafers, use oreo cookies they sell them without the cream in the middle too ... or my personal fave graham crackers (use less whipped cream between cookies)  it's a gingerbread zebra cake instead :)

I have made this recipe since my kids where little, I would form the 1 of year the they turned, so fun, I would decorate it with smarties/fresh fruit or just chocolate shavings. I find the cookies in the baking section at our store.  I only use 1 tsp. of vanilla.

I needed to make a quick dessert for work but didnâ€™t feel like measuring and baking. This recipe looked easy enough but the cookies are kind of hard to find, a bit small for what I needed and kind of expensive. So, I decided to substitute chocolate graham crackers. I laid out 5 across and did 6 high, doubled the whipped cream, topped each layer with chocolate shavings and refrigerated it overnight. Everyone loved it! People couldnâ€™t believe it was graham crackers and not cake. Comments were that it was light, not too sweet and similar to tiramisu but not as â€˜soggyâ€™. Thank you for the recipe idea!

Great recipe. Simple, yet looks and tastes like it was a lot of work. I used Anna's chocolate mint thins, a Swedish cookie, I found at my local supermarket. They were on sale, so I thought why not? It was absolutely wonderful. I made it for my Bible study group and everyone loved it!

This is a great take along to potlucks and office parties. I shape it as a double, side-by-side log with the cookies assembled on the diagonal. Then it travels better and can be sliced straight across and still get the zebra effect. Yes, the Famous Wafers are hard to find, but supermarkets nowadays often have request cards at the customer service desk. My dad retired with Nabisco, so when I was a kid Famous Wafers were always available to mom.

I was curious about this recipe recipe so I gave it a try.  I have to say this was really good, tasted like an ice cream sandwich.  Very easy to make for a dessert that has a nice presentation.  This would have been five stars but the reason for four stars was because the ingredients were expansive.  The only waffers I found were nabisco and they were not cheap.

Iâ€™ve always loved this cake! My grandparents used to make it when I was little, and my cousin brought one over for dessert this last Christmas, which brought me back to the past like my own personal madeleine. I will always choose Nabisco chocolate wafers for Zebra cakes, because they have more salt than any other brand Iâ€™ve ever had. Not enough to make it salty, but it makes a big difference in taste!

I added peppermint flavor and some green coloring to the whipped cream and and it was a hit.  Yes I'll be making it again as one of my easiest desserts.   Made it in the last century and kinda forgot about it so was glad to find the recipe again and make it  for newer family members.

My mama always made this "yule log" at Christmas time.  She decorated the top with artificial holly leaves and berries.  It looked beautiful and tasted great.  Thanks for the memory!

So yummy!  I had to make more whipped cream to completely cover the cake.  Make sure you whip the cream until it is very stiff.  The thicker cream makes it easier to frost and construct the cake.

I made as written except for subbing chocolate grahams for the cookies, which I couldn't find. The whipped cream wasn't as sweet as we would have liked, so I'll increase the sugar next time. Otherwise, great!

I have been making this recipe for 60!years and it is still one of my familyâ€™s favorite. 

My mother-in-law made a different version of icebox cake. She layered graham crackers in a Pyrex dish with chocolate pudding. 

I still like the original one better.

We make this at least every month as we celebrate family birthdays.  I add a stack on top at one end as well as 3 half wafers on each side and some smarties on top and we call it a train cake. Everyone loves it and it has become a tradition to have a "Train Cake "

I LOVE icebox cakes! I've always heard of them, but  just recently made one for the first time ever. Very similar to this recipe, but the cream is tinted light green (it was a St. Patrick's  recipe) and lightly flavored with peppermint. The recipe as written used Oreo style chocolate sandwich cookies. As a diabetic in desperate need of a dessert  in which I could lower the carbs, I sweetened the whipped cream with Splenda and used mint flavored Oreo Thins. I also made mine in a smallish round cake pan so it was easier to carry to dinner at a friend's. It was out of this world! Come Thanksgiving /Christmas, I'm going to try one with ginger snaps and mixed whipped cream & buttercream.

She made other icebox cakes but this chocolate was my fav, especially when you had shaved chocolate on top. YUM

It was delicious! The only issue I had, was with the box of cookies I bought...when I picked each one up to frost, they broke into about 5 pieces! It just made the process longer, but it tasted great!

I was excited to make this, but in the end it was just OK-Reasoning is, that I can make a real chocolate cake and frost it with whipped cream and its easier and just as yummy-as this recipe which I found frosting each cookie, kind of tedious, and it really doesn't make a very big dessert when its completed.

I hate to say this but...This cake is beautiful but unfortunately we could not get past the taste of the Nabisco wafers, which I had looked so hard to find. I was very disappointed. The wafers by themselves taste oily and almost bitter, and the whip cream did not mask it even sitting overnight as directed. I would like to try it again with other wafers as some have suggested because it was not hard to make this dessert and it made a very pretty presentation.

I have made this the Zebra Cake for many years. I made it exactly like the recipe says to make it and it always turned out great.  One night I had company and I said to one of the men "what kind of dessert do you like?"  He answered "If it's anything like an Oreo cookie, I'll be happy".  Well, I guess he couldn't be any happier.

I have been making this refrigerator roll for years, as did my mother before me.  I use 2 cups of heavy cream and NO sugar.  The sugar makes it too sweet.  This is a family favorite â€” even requested for birthdays.

This is as good as I remember from my x mother in law. I doubled the recipe & substituted 1/2 whipped topping.  Really good.  I froze three shorter stacks: one for me & 2 for friends .  I think I'll try  pistachios next time.  Yum
