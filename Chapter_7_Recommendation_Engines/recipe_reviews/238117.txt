This. Is. Awesome. I made this yesterday for a get together today and it was a huge hit! It was super easy to make (I used a blender because we don't have a food processor) and has a delicious velvety consistency. I did use more garlic because I had extra cloves to use. I left out the black pepper per personal preference. I wasn't sure about the basil but it works. It really works. This will be a repeater in the LTH house. THANKS for the recipe!
