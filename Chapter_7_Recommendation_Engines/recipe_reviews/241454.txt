These were a breeze using the bread machine to make the dough.  I skipped scalding the milk, and just combined it with the water.  I'm not sure what I missed out on by doing this, but these turned out beautiful and worthy of serving at Thanksgiving dinner.  Definitely a keeper.

I used butter in place of shortening. And, (after I post a picture) you will see that I rolled most in knot rolls the best I could. These turned out great! Very much a dinner roll and paired great with our rotisserie chicken dinner. I will definitely make again!

My rolls did not rise up pretty like the photo, so I am disappointed in their appearance. I let them rise for extra time covered in a warm place.They did not rise enough to be fluffy, they taste good, but are dense. Is one package of yeast enough?

My family loved these! A lot! I subbed butter in the recipe and used olive oil to grease the bowl and dough ball and also the cookie sheet I used to cook them on. The olive oil gave it a great crunch. For some reason after the recommended time the rolls were not brown yet. So I raised the temp to 400* and left them in another 10-12 min until I liked the color. They were so delicious! A keeper, no more packaged rolls for us! Also, I think they would be great made into a sweet roll! Trying that next!
Update: I have made these at least 6 times. They turn out great every time. I decided to make the dough the day before and put them in the fridge. Even with leaving them out for 2 hours they did not rise like normal. I do not recommend making them a day ahead. They still tasted delicious!

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly, and even at 7,000 feet elevation, didn’t have to change a thing. I’ll be making these again!

Great & easy recipe.  Made these in my breadmaker (wet ingred 1st, then dry, yeast last - dough setting) at Thanksgiving couldn't believe how great they turned out.  Everyone loved them.  I did follow the recipe and scald the milk.  Buns were light but rich with flavour.  Making them again to go with tonights pot roast.  It's a keeper!
