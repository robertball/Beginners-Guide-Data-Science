I made this for Mother's Day brunch and we all really enjoyed it.  I chose to brown loose breakfast sausage and use it in place of the bacon.  I also added some diced green bell peppers and onion.  I wanted to use a 9X13 pan, so I doubled the recipe (and added 2 extra eggs because I was concerned it wasn't "wet" enough).  I threw this together Saturday afternoon and baked for an hour Sunday morning.  This will be a repeater at the LTH house.  THANKS, for the recipe!

I did add regular onions & bell peppers. I sauteed them first with the bacon once bacon was almost done cooking. I drained the pan then once cool, I put them in the bowl w/ hashbrowns & cheese & mixed all together. 

Compliments from all my guests

I added 3 more eggs as 3 stated in the recipe didn't seem like enough to cover the croutons & cheese. I would bake it for 30 minutes if I make it again because it seemed over baked at 45 minutes.

I made exactly as stated. it was a crunchy mess. could not serve. It was not wet enough and it came out dried and stuck together.
