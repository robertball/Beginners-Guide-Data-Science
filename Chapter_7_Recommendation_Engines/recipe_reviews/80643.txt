I was looking for a homemade version of Marble Slab's Black Walnut ice cream, so naturally I chose to make this one first.  I left out the Black Walnuts as I wanted a smooth texture without add-ins.  The texture of the ice cream was good for a "no-cook" ice cream recipe.  The flavor was somewhat lacking.  I think if I make this one again I will double the amount of Black Walnut extract.

Excellent!  Like all uncooked, non-custard ice creams, it is best eaten within hours of making it.  But when you have an ice cream freezer and the recipe is this easy, you can easily make small batches every night if you want to.  This recipe fed six eager people with a couple of bowls for left-overs.

Made a double recipe this afternoon with my Dad. So nostalgic, haven't had this in many years. We added extra black walnut extract before freezing - on the advice of another reviewer, and I think they were right. After freezing, I thought it needed a little more sugar (used powdered)and that salt would really improve the flavor. We liked it much better after the additions, and it was wonderful. Thanks.

I made this recipe and it was delicious. The only changes I made was instead of lite cream I uses heavy whipping cream and used vanilla extract in place of black walnut extract because I couldn't find it.
