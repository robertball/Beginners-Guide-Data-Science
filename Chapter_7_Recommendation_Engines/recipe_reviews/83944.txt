I added a few dashes to my husband's glass of beer. Also used smoked Tabasco. You don't taste it at first, but it creeps up on you! I would use any hot sauce I had on hand.

Ouch my lips!  But it's totally yummy, and I can imagine if I did need warming up, this might do the trick despite the beer's frostiness.

Love beer, love spice and I thought that this was absolutely terrific! I have to say that I added a LOT more hot sauce and you don't even feel it until after you've swallowed. YUM! Why didn't I ever think of this? Good stuff Boater Ron!

Right up my alley! Frosted mug of beer and hot sauce. This is so good and I must admit I did add a few more dashes of hot sauce. I used a non-vinegar based hot sauce. I think I'll have another...
