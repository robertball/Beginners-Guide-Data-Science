This the African take on salsa - pretty good recipe.  I don't care for the tough skins of cooked cherry tomatoes so I used romas and peeled them before cooking then down.  I also used lime juice instead of lemon as that is what I had on hand.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Good, but it would be better if you remove tomato rind before boiling.

Wasn’t sure how long to cook tomatoes but it came out really well.  Can’t wait to add to my corvina fillet!
