This is a favorite of ours because it tastes great and is quick and easy to fix.  I omit the oil to lessen the calories and add only 8 oz. of the smoked turkey sausage to the rice mix and water.  My husband likes to top his with grated sharp cheddar.

It was okay, but since "the stuff in the box" did most of the work I can't give this one anymore than 3 stars.  Followed the directions exactly and will use it again but it's an insult to call this a recipe.

I added strips of onion at the beginning with the sausage, instead of green onion at end.  Great recipe!

Use Zatarain's Red Bean and Rice Mix. It's all in the mix and it's quick & tasty!

This recipe is perfect for a quick, easy and inexpensive meal.  Next time I would use 2 lbs of sausage, as my family likes more meat with their meal.

I removed the Zataran's mix and replaced it with my own cajun spice mix and rice.  Still turned out awesome.

This is super easy and tasty, though I almost gave it three stars because, as another reviewer said, Zatarains does all the work. I also made a few changes:  I saut√©ed onions, celery and pepper, and I used about half the meat but added a cup or so of homemade beans. I made it in an instant pot.

Easy and fast, for those times when you don't have time to fix it from scratch. The recipe is very adaptable to change. I will make this again.

As I was making the rice, it smelled so good, so I know it's going to taste yummy and I'm so happy that I found the recipe.  This is a great addition to my Thanksgiving Dinner for my family.

This is a very easy recipe and tastes like something my mom would make, so it's great comfort food. It does taste like it's missing something though - may work better as a side than a main dish? Next time i'll be cooking it in butter as opposed to oil to see if that adds a more robust flavor.
