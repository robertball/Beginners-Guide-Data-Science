My family absolutely LOVED ths recipe! We have had it 4 times in the last couple of months and they seem to enjoy it more and more every time. I don't have the watered down issue everyone else seems to have though.

This recipe is bland.
I used cooked chicken breast but I don't think even breaded chicken would have increased the flavor.
I don't normally salt my food but it was the only thing that seemed to help.
