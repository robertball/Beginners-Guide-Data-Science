I really liked these potatoes!  The flavor was mellow, yet tasty.  I think these could be even quicker if you used frozen, diced hash brown potatoes, but I used fresh potatoes. I will make these again and again since I usually have all ingredients on hand. I needed to cook them a few mins. longer in microwave, but I think it depends on the size of your  diced potatoes.

i used fresh lemon juice, didn't add the parmesan until the potatoes were cooked, then i stirred in the parm > i then put the potatoes in a pie plate and sprinkled grated parm on top and put it in the broiler for a few mintes > i'll add even more parmesan to the top next time > it's a keeper

I like this as written, but it's also a fantastic base recipe. So fast and easy! You can add rosemary, chives, or almost any other herb or spice to this to change it up a bit. It makes a great side dish for just about anything.  The key to a short cooking time is chopping the potatoes into pretty small cubes (somewhere between diced and cubed). Mine are done in 6 minutes in the microwave.  And I LOVE that the recipe is for 2 servings. This is a great recipe for single folks who are in a hurry to get something delicious cooked at night.

These were terrific! I loved not heating up the kitchen, it is so hot & humid here (upper 80's)right now. I doubled, and it took about 15 miutes (stirring every few minutes). Still very fast for a potato dish! I used a "Smart Balance" butter-substitute to make heart-healthier. It tasted great, but was a little oily. (probably just because of not using real butter). So, next time I will use a little less. And... I preferred to use *fresh* lemon juice, fresh parsley and it just *cries* out for fresh garlic,(In My Opinion), so I added it.  All my family enjoyed, and DearHusband said a few times,: "these have a really good flavor". The "cook" doesn't always hear that, so I will be making these again and often. Thank you, for the recipe Sarah!

I really liked this recipe and so did my family.  I would absolutely cook it for longer than directed because we had to put it back in the microwave for about 5 minutes longer in order to get the potatoes fully cooked.  Once they were cooked they were quite tasty.

This recipe will make it into my personal cookbook!  I changed the servings from 2 to 6, though, and had to decrease the margarine to 1/4 cup, and the cheese to 1/2 cup.  Still could decrease the butter more.  Obviously had to increase the cooking time, also, due to increase in servings.  Very good though, and my entire family loved it- even my non-potato-eating son.

I really like this dish! I rarely follow recipes exactly (I look at these sites for inspiration!) but this one I kept the ingredients the same but when the potatoes were maybe 1/2 done I sprinkled a little more parmesan on top and finished it in the oven. Delish!

Since I had three potatoes that needed to be used but no desire to spend time cooking, this looked perfect for me.  I made these as written, and they were tasty.  This dish could use a little more flavor, but the beauty about these is that they can easily be doctored up!  I am thinking that with the leftovers I'll add a little red pepper bruschetta.  Or maybe use them in an egg dish.  See what I mean?  Easy!

good lord these are quick and delicious. i add a little italian seasoning to give them an herby flavor. I make them all the time when we have to stay late at work â€” it's such a relief to have a quick way to cook potatoes! and these are so good, too!

Normally I am not a fan of microwave cooking and had planned to roast in the oven instead.  When the time came to make it I thought I'd give it a try in the microwave as written. It actually worked out very well! The potatoes had a soft texture which I liked in this application. Couldn't really taste the lemon, think I'll skip it next time. Otherwise parmesan, butter and potatoes are always a win.

These were surprisingly good - will definitely make again.  I doubled the recipe, added garlic powder, cooked for 17 minutes, and added the parmesan cheese at the end.  Kids and husband loved them!

These were a real winner to my family. I loved the taste and how easy it was to make. Great recipe. I just sprinkled a little cheddar or colby cheese on top when they are done, just for a little extra taste. Other then that I would not change a thing.

This was pretty good for a quick potato recipe.  I incresed the cooking time by 2 minutes and still a few of the chunks were under-done.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that a little more seasoning was needed.

Absolutely delicious. But be warned - if you are making the recipe for more than 2 people, you need to increase the oven time. For 6 servings, it took 40 min at 425 degress.

I needed a potato side dish one day and found this one that I had all the ingredients for.  I thought they were very good, but had to cook about 20 minutes longer than the recipe said.

Wow.  We are really in the minority on this one. We did not like this at all. I flexed up the servings to 6.  The parmesan got weird tasting when cooked- almost like a smoked flavor.  It may be better to add the cheese AFTER cooking?

I thought these were okay, but lacked some flavor.

This is a great, easy recipe!  I never would have thought to put lemon juice on potatoes, but it works.  Thanks!

This is a quick potato recipe that worked out great when I was cooking something else in the over.

This was good. I added  fresh garlic and my potatoes took about 8min to cook, by then the cheese was almost gone. Next time I would add the cheese at the end.

Fast, easy, and absolutely wonderful flavor!  The entire family (even "miss picky") loved them.  We'll be making these often!

These were good, and very easy to make.  Everyone raved about them and asked when I would be making them again!

These potatoes were so good!! I was surprised.  This is a great recipe.  I cooked the potatoes for 9 minutes in the microwave, stirring them every 3 minutes.  It's such a quick recipe and delicious!
