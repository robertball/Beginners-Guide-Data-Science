I have made these several times. They are my go to snack in the evening. I roll them out score them into squares and then use a fork and prick all the cracker squares. I cover them with another piece of parchment paper for the 15 minutes at 400 then I turn down the heat to 250 and bake them for about an hour. I usually make 2 batches at a time. They come out really crispy. After you roll them out you can also sprinkle any seasoning on them. Sometimes I use a spicy one to kick it up. Love these.

Will definitely make again: suggest
1. 1/4 cup sesame seeds as addition (either plain or roasted)
2. for max crunchiness, turn off oven and allow to dry in the oven
3. can also cut into shapes and place (like cookies)

These came out great and while they were baking we made up some guacamole which went quite well with the crackers! Full disclosure: We did substitute 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder for the original 1 tsp garlic powder. We rolled out the dough to about 1/16" instead of 1/8". Make sure you don't add all of the water at once. You want the dough workable and not wet. If it is too wet, just add more almond flour. Once rolled out, you can add some cayenne pepper or ground Rosemary or whatever suits you. Didn't do it this time, though we'll try it next time! We baked at 400 F (200 C) for 15 minutes and then turned the oven off, leaving the tray inside for another 30 minutes. Crackers were very crisp and would hold up to the thickest of dips. A real go to cracker recipe!

These are awesome! I didn't have high hopes for them but was quickly proven wrong. I served these with a variety of hummus (cool ranch, peanut butter and sundried tomato) at Thanksgiving and they were gone before I could mix the ingredients for a second batch.

I made them with cashew meal instead of almond as that is what I had on hand and used nutritional yeast instead of cheese for the first batch. The second batch I used cashew and goat cheddar. I don't think you can go wrong with any combination. The next time I make these I will try adding Rosemary to see how that works.

Like another reviewer I used nutritional yeast in place of the cheese and got great results. These are really crispy and delicious and so quick to make. The dough is easy to roll out with plastic wrap on top and doesn't stick at all. I will make these again!

Made a double recipe. Used 1/3 cup grated parmesan and 1/3 cup nutritional yeast. Rolled out as thin as possible. Great! Crispiest low-carb cracker recipe I've found. Spray wax paper with olive oil cooking spray before rolling out to prevent sticking. I baked additional hour at 250 then turned off oven and let crackers cool inside gradually. Next time I'm going to try some flavorings - rosemary, everything bagel spices...yummy!

Great recipe! I made it exactly as it was written but doubled it and followed the baking directions suggested. I ate it with cheese. This is now my favorite cracker!

This is the best low carb cracker recipe I have found yet on the internet. I roll mine out very thin and either cut them in small rectangles (like club crackers) or into triangles to use as chips. If I'm going to be using them as crackers, I brush melted butter on them as soon as they come out of the oven and then add my salt and garlic powder.  This softens them somewhat initially, but if you let them sit until they cool they'll crisp back up again.

Update: These are much easier to make if you just turn the dough out onto a silpat on your cookie sheet and then pat the dough out to the desired thinness.

Super easy to make and very tasty.  Next time I'll try leaving them in the oven at 250 for an additional hour, as another reviewer suggested to make them crispier. You could play around with the seasonings to have another flavor.

These are great! Instead of rolling these out, I separate into four balls and use my tortilla press to flatten them evenly. (Put the dough between an opened plastic bag so it doesn’t stick to the press.) I then score them with the side of a metal spatula and prick with a fork. Super fast and very little work!

I made this for the first time last evening, and this is my new go-to recipe for low-carb crackers. I prepared 2 different versions -- the first with almond meal, tandoori spice mix, and topped with sesame + fennel seeds; the second with cashew meal, Chinese 5-spice, and topped with black sesame seeds. Both are terrific.  

I cooked the crackers at 400 F for 15 minutes, then reduced the oven temperature to 200 F for one hour to crisp them. Then put them  on a rack to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Great crackers, and so easy to make!

So I have made these a few times so far and they're delicious when you get the baking time right. I do cover the tray with aluminum  foil to help prevent burning. I've played around with the spice and have added a little more garlic, sometimes onion poweder and sometimes add an herb or two. They're versatile enough you can create your own flavor.

Delicious! 
Followed a lot of reviewers' suggestions such as leaving them to dry in the oven after I'd turned it off.

Also, I didn't have garlic powder so I added a fresh clove, minced. Also added a pinch of smokey paprika and a few tablespoons of sesame seeds.

Yummy on their own or with cheese or dips. Definitely worth doubling the recipe!

I really enjoyed these.  I did find that I had better results at a lower temperature and a longer cook time.  I like to sprinkle everything bagel seasoning on them before putting them into the oven.  Either way they are a great cracker and keep well for me in a container for the week.

VERY salty. I followed the directions, but since I didn't have enough garlic powder, I used half garlic powder and half onion powder. I left the crackers in the oven for about 45 minutes at 250 degrees after the initial baking period in order to crisp them up.

I made 1/2 a batch. I wanted to make sure I liked it. It was VERY good. Although a strong garlic taste - which over powers any spread or dip. Next time I will decrease the garlic just a bit. However, if you're looking for a stand alone chip - this is it!!

Instead of salt, I used umami powder.  I also used non-dairy, alternative Parmesan shreds. Had to cook them longer, so I raised the temp to 450 and cooked them about 10 minutes more.  I left them in the oven after I turned it off, for about 15  minutes. They are golden, crispy, and delicious!

Due to allergies I had to use a vegan parmesan cheese (almond meal, nutritional yeast, and a pinch of salt) and it still turned out great! So simple, and works marvellously in my soups.

I made these using the suggestion to cook at 400 and then 250 for 45 minutes covered with parchment paper.  I also added black sesame seeds, about a table spoon.  My husband cannot get enough!

Although the taste was similar to other almond flax cracker recipes I tried before, the 1/2 cup ground flax seed tore my stomach up. Other similar recipes only use 1-2 Tablespoons per batch.  We aren't made for massive amounts of flax seed.

This was so tasty and crisp cracker.  I love it and will make it again.   Make sure to roll it out thin.  The thinner the crispier.

Cooking for type 2 diabetic who misses crunchy grainy things. These fit the bill! Tried the first time on my pizza stone for maximum crisp, and got a mess when I tried to spread "dough" on the hot stone. Second time followed directions as written, with added sesame seeds as suggested by another reviewer. Perfect!

Didn't have garlic powder so used garlic salt instead of plain, and they turned out great! Left in oven for one hour after cooking and they are super crispy. Will definitely make again, with the garlic powder next time. Thanks for the recipe!

These crunchy crackers are fantastic! I added some sesame seeds. After the initial baking time I separated the crackers onto 2 sheets and baked them at 250 degrees for 1 hour. I can’t stop eating them!

A bit salty, so next time I'll cut that by half, but other than that, they were wonderful!  I thought I had to give up crackers completely, since eating gluten-free, because the  store-bought ones are tasteless and expensive. But these are sooooo easy to make, and healthy, and taste great! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I must have rolled them thin enough, because they were pretty crispy. Thanks for the recipe!

Taste was great, my mistake was  that it stuck to the cooking  tray that  I used , so I  had to break it out into not so great cracker shapes.

I made these crackers today. I doubled the recipe and added some onion powder and black pepper, other than that I followed the recipe as written. I've tried other low carb recipes
for crackers and these are the best. Just make sure that they are rolled out thin so they get crispy when baked. I too covered them with parchment paper and cooked at 400 for 15 min then removed the parchment paper and lowered the oven to 250 and cooked until crispy. This recipe is a keeper even my husband liked them. Oh and one more important thing I used golden flaxseed I think the flavor is milder than the dark flaxseed and if possible grind your own flaxseed.

They were ok but I was not wowed by them. I may not have rolled them thin enough. They were not crispy.

This recipe worked great, it's a wonderful alternative if you're trying a low-carb diet. We ate our crackers with chicken salad.
