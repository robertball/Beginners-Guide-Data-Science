I could drink a pitcher all to myself!  This margarita rocks!  I think the frozen strawberries help make it the perfect slushie-like drink.  My blender works better if you put the liquids in first and then the ice.  I put everything in the blender and whatever room I had left I filled with ice.  I made this for a dinner party and went through 3 pitchers!  (for only 4 people)  Very tasty.  Used salt instead of sugar on the rims of the glasses but I'm sure either way is just as good.

This margarita recipe was well named! It IS the ultimate. Bear in mind I'm writing this after having consumed two of these very strong drinks.  A full cup of booze goes in with 3/4s of it being tequila so be sure to use a good brand. Very tasty and considerably less expensive then buying the ready to use mixes. MMMMM  Think I'll have me another.

This is an AWESOME margarita!!  My daughter and I drank two pitchers on a hot sunny day as we floated around in the pool. Yes, just the two of us! Made another pitcher a few days later for her and her hubby! This is definitely the drink of choice at my house!!

VERY, VERY GOOD!!!  The best frozen strawberry marg I have ever had at home and also better than a majority of the ones I've had in mexican restaurants.  I did lower the tequila a bit and added 1 cup of ice cubes to the blender...just as my own personal preference.

I triple the recipe & make it all in the limeade can.  (1 1/2 cans of tequila, one can of limeade, 1/2 can of triple sec & 24 oz of frozen strawberries.)  I make the mix ahead of time in a pitcher & throw it in the fridge.  When it's time for a party - I use my Margarita maker & blend it with ice (makes 3 pitchers of margaritas).  It's AWESOME and people ask for the recipe constantly.  Thanks so much - it's our go-to party recipe!

Very good strawberry margarita, however I cut back on the tequilla by half because the taste was just overpowering.  I added a little more triple sec to compensate.  Yummy!

Thanks for this recipe...they were Excellent!  And they are great to make the night before.  Just store in a freezer safe pitcher!  I made these the night before a party (quadrupled the recipe to make a big pitcher full) and just stored in the freezer the night before.  I took them out 1 hour before guests arrived and they were the perfect slushy consistency! I was informed by everyone that I am now in charge of the margaritas for every party we have!

A mexican-restaurant quality margarita.  Costs a little bit to purchase all the ingredients but it's worth it.  Very good for serving to company or for a summer treat. Yum.

There wasn't anything remarkable about this margarita recipe. I needed to double the amount of strawberries in order to draw out some strawberry taste. I don't think I will use again. Thanks anyway.

I've been searching for a good strawberry margarita recipe, and have finally found it.  I've tried ChiChi's blend where you just add ice, and it's just not the same, not even close.  This is a great recipe, however I think I may add more strawberries and a smidge less limeade next time.  Thank, Mimi

This Margarita was soooooo yummy.  The only thing that I did different was, instead of using 6oz of Tequila, I used 4oz.  The 6oz made it too strong.  The tequila that I used was Jose Cuervo Gold.  I could not find the strawberries with syrup so i used frozen strawberries with sugar.  You might also want to add strawberry syrup to make it sweeter.  Overall great recipe.

I'm drinking this right now and it's strong as, well let's just say I'm on they way to a long nap. It tastes great, looks great, and packs a powerful punch. I was going to make it again tomorrow, but I don't think I can handle this sandman for two consecutive days.  Beware: it's delicsh!

Stop looking, because THIS IS IT - the BEST frozen strawberry margarita ever. After trying many, many recipes that didn't come close to what I wanted, I came across this...and in 5 minutes I had the delicious, elusive concoction I've been seeking for so long. ENJOY!

Excellent, but didn't make 4 servings.  I'll double the recipe next time.

We have also made these with fresh strawberries.  We eliminated the frozen strawberries and added about 12 large strawberries and a 1/4 cup of sugar.  Yummy!!!!

by far one of the best margaritas.  i used fresh  halved strawberries with sugar which i let stand for about an hour and then froze them.  i didn't have triple sec but had peach schnapps i also had lemonade concentrate instead of the limeade.  it still tasted awesome....thanks for the recipe, this will be my go to margarita recipe :)

Uber-yum!  I made this drink for a "Girls' Night In" and they were a big hit (the words "fabulous" and "delicious" were used liberally)!  I did tweak the recipe recipe a bit, though.  I used a 10 fl oz bag of frozen strawberries (no syrup), substituted half a cup (or so) of Rose's sweetened lime juice for the frozen limeade concentrate and added about half a cup of sugar.  This drink is a PERFECT addition to any party.  My friends loved their margaritas and can't wait to have them again!

Made it a Mockarita! This was great, since we are non drinkers I subsituted the tequilla with guava nectar and the triple sec with orange juice and it was FABULOUS!

ULTIMATE IS CORRECT!!  Me and my boyfriend made a pitcher last Saturday and we liked it so much we did it again the next day!  We are strawberry lovers so we used more than the 8oz it calls for in the recipe.  (We used about 12oz.)
Also, just this past weekend for my girlfriends, I used this recipe even without the strawberries.  So I might try even other fruits to use....mmmmm.... maybe Mangos!

This was amazing. Used fresh strawberries because we were trying to use them up, and there were perfect chunks of berries in the drink. We plan on drinking this all summer long!!

This is truly the ultimate frozen strawberry margarita. Its rare that I have no alterations, but I truly don't think anything could improve upon this recipe. Bravo!

We LOVED this! I have a pretty large blender, so when it says to fill a blender with ice, I think we had to increase the other ingredients accordingly. We ended up using the same amount of tequila and triple sec, but increased the strawberries to 16oz and the limeade concentrate to 6oz. This is just like the strawberry margaritas at our favorite Mexican restaurant in town, we will definitely be making this again and again!!!

Great recipe... tweaked slightly. Used 6 ounces Simply Lime limeade (not frozen or from concentrate) and used "two handfuls" of frozen strawberries (no syrup). I made it once with tequila, but the second time I substituted the tequila with Cruzan strawberry rum (which everyone preferred), and I added 2 ounces of orange juice. Talk about delicious! Thanks!

They were absolutely amazing.  I decided to only use frozen fruit to avoid the watering down that usually happens and they were gone in a flash.  We loved the combination of strawberries & mango.

Perfection!  Had a ton of fresh strawberries, so added three cups of these instead of the frozen.  Needed to add 1/4 sugar to sweeten the pitcher.  Also substitued Grand Marnier for the triple sec.  Superior ingredients produce superior results!

I did it a little different and added all the ingredients and then filled the remainder of the blender with ice and blended.  I thought the taste of the limeade was too much.  I think one blender full will do for the night...so next time I will try cutting down the limeade to 2 fluid ounces.

OMG!! Yummy. I thought my recipe was good but this was far better!! My husband absolutely loved the flavor, and the kick was awesome too!! I added a little more tequila and triple sec but it did not take away from the flavor!

Made these for a 4th of July party last night. Planned on making a couple of pitchers and ended up having to run to the store and get more LimeAde because we went through MANY pitchers!!  This is by far one of the tastiest Margaritas I have ever had! But be warned, it really packs a punch!!!

This is a very good recipe. But I created one way to make it better, use Strawberry Dole Fruit Bars to make the margarita more slushy. This is good because they are only 90 calories per bar and are all natural. You only need half a bar per drink. I love serving them at family get togethers!!

Awesome! Best strawberry margarita, by far. Just make sure the strawberries and sauce are pretty melted. Mine were too frozen and with the ice and frozen concentrate, the blender wouldn't turn enough and the drinks came out too thick. Next batch was perfect after the strawberries had defrosted.

Perfect!  I threw in a handful of hulled and halved berries and added the juice of half a lime to give it real "freshness." A winner all the way around!

This is SO SO good.  However, after trying it a few times, I've started cutting back the tequilla to 1/2 cup (4 oz.), otherwise it tends to sneak up on you too fast!  :)

I like my drinks on the rocks, not frozen and heavy, so I did a combo thing. I blended all the drink ingredients and served over ice. Excellent, and a perfect consistency for me. The limeade really adds something! Once again, I polished off the whole mix myself! Will do again! Thanks!

Nice margarita! Although not the best margarita I've ever made or consumed, this is a decent homemade version nonetheless. My only "gripe" is that the strawberry flavor was somewhat lacking (it's very subtle, IMHO). I think I'll tinker with the ratio of frozen strawberries next time to see what I can come up with. :) TIP: Moisten the rim of you glass with a lime wedge or cut strawberry half, THEN dip in sugar (powdered, granulated or large crystals). The fruit does double duty.... Not only does it allow the sugar to adhere to your glass (the fruit "juice" is sticky), it also serves as a cute garnish! Thanks for sharing,  JTWTECH! You made taco night yum-o. :-)

Had a party and everyone loved these.  I made slight variation keeped the amount of alcohol the same, but used Gran Gala instead of triple sec its higher quality, added 8-12 oz unsweetened strawberries because that is what I had, so I added 1/8-1/4 sugar. And added only 3 oz of limeade. And added enough water so it would blend. It was so popular that we ran out of tequila we made 5 batches so if your having a party make sure you have lots of strawberries, tequila, and ice!

I would highly recommend these to anyone who enjoys margaritas you get in a restaurant.  They taste very similar.  I used about half the alcohol called for and some still felt they were a bit strong.  I thought they were perfect .  Thanks very much for the recipe.  They were a delicious addition to ladies night!

OH MY!! Me and my husband love this drink recipe! You are right it is in deed near perfect. I had friends over and they couldn't believe I didn't make them from a pre-mixed bottle. Served it with some yummy enchiladas.

Very, very good!  I used frozen strawberries and added a little simple syrup to sweeten it up a bit.  I rimmed one glass with salt and another with granulated sugar.  I preferred the sugar over the salt.  This was better than most restaurant margaritas.  Give it a try!

Memorial Day weekend....90 degrees outside....a pitcher of slushy Frozen Strawberry Margaritas.  Perfection!!!  I doubled the recipe and poured into a large pitcher.  The margaritas kept nice and slushy for about an hour in the fridge.  The sweetness of the strawberries and the tartness of the limeade are a perfect combination.  A real keeper!

The first time I made these I couldn't find limeaide at the store (it was May 5th and the limeaide was all sold out...I assume for everyone to make awesome Margaritas)...I used lime juice instead.  Big Mistake...I needed to add a ton of sugar and it never turned out WOW.  So...I made another batch and used the lemonaide concentrate that I had on hand and added a touch of the lime juice.  It was awesome.  The lemonaide/limeaid really adds that wow factor.  The next batch I made (a few days later) I used Limeaide concentrate so that I could taste the recipe as posted and it was delicious!!!!

My favorite margaritas!  I've been meaning to review this for quite some time.  After I made these once a couple of years ago, they became my signature contribution to potlucks and parties.  I rim my glasses with granulated sugar instead of powdered, though I must say, I haven't actually tried the latter.  You just can't go wrong with these!

I'm writing my review as I sip! (And sip, and sip...). I happened to have one of those bucket margarita mixes already made, with tequila, etc. But I don't care for the bucket mixture or the texture of the ice when it isn't blended. So I put the frozen mixture in the blender with fresh strawberries and some added ice and voila! I definitely think fresh strawberries make a difference. This will be a weekend regular!

Was invited to a margarita loving fiends house to soak in her new hot tub....made these Strawberry Margaritas and they were a big hit! Added a bit less tequila and used fresh picked strawberries, they were awesome! The flavor from the limeade was just right. Don't know what was more relaxing, the long soak in the hot tub or these wonderful cocktails! Will def make these again! Midnight Margaritas anyone?!

This is how I've been making my margaritas for years!  I tend not to measure things out, so some batches are a bit stronger than others. I've also tried it with frozen mango pieces which worked pretty well

Yum Yum Yum!  I don't even like margaritas or tequila but this was so good.  I took the advice of another reviewer and got good tequila (Jose Cuervo) since there is so much in this drink.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Awesome margaritas! I made these for my husband and I on Cinco de Mayo and they were fabulous! A little on the sweet side, but I thought it was just right. Will definately be making this recipe in the future. Thanks!

Soooo good! A little strong, but that's easy to fix, I threw some ice and more strawberries in. I made strawberry mango margaritas by adding frozen mango and mango nectare. They came out great too!

I have tried making other straw marg from other recipes here on this site as well as with mixes and can never find one that I like...and I like margaritas!! THIS ONE however, tastes like one at a mexican restaurant.  I LOVE IT.  The only thing I did different was I only had whole frozen strawberries and I added a little sugar in the blender with it... Hubby said I added too much sugar, I thought it was just right...I added about 1/4 cup.  I will definitely keep this recipe.  THANK YOU!!

They taste great. I'm not much of a tequila drinker so I only did 4 oz of tequila. Only downside is the morning after...so much sugar = nasty hangover.

EDIT: I'm here to update and tell you all that I think the culprit of hangovers is the triple sec. Last night we did these bad boys and only used the tequila, strawberries, and frozen limeade and feeling perfectly fine today. :)

They tasted really good, but I felt they didn't have enough alcohol. I was drinking before trying these, and by the time I got half way done with mine, I had already sobered up. They were also very thick, so you couldn't really drink them so much as eat them. My fiance abandoned his entirely. If I try making them again I'll definitely be adding more alcohol. Hopefully that will make them a little less thick.

This is almost exactly how my parents make their regular magaritas, just omit the strawberries.  You could also substitute frozen mangos, blackberries, whatever you like for the strawberries!

I would give this recipe more stars if I could.  I usually drink my margaritas on the rocks....not anymore.  This recipe will be the one I make from now on when having company over.  Everyone loves these margaritas.  Thank you, JTWTECH!

I have to agree that this is awesome!!  The only thing I changed (on accident) was that I doubled the strawberries.  So, the second time I made this I put just the 8 oz of strawberries, but then ended up doubling them again.  I like it better that way.  Yummy!  My husband says these are better than the restaurants serve, too!

These are great! I like that the frozen strawberries added a real fruit taste, but the syrup made them sweet too. Not sugary like the frozen mixes you get at the store, delicious more like the ones you order at a good restaurant.

Sorry to say, that this recipe may bring me to alcoholism.  This is the way Margaritas should be.  Now, instead of paying $8 for a restaurant to mess my drink up...I come home to this one, perfect every time!!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  These were even better than the ones we get served at an authentic Mexican restaurant.  I didn't use frozen strawberries-I used fresh strawberries picked from my garden.  That was the only substitution that I made.  They were so flavorful, and my relatives and hubby (who generally does not like margaritas) kept saying how good they were.  Thanks, Jason!

Mmmm. So good. I did not make exactly as recipe states though as I like them a little less strong. I only used 4oz tequila, 2oz triple sec and then I added ice and a little extra limeade (I think about half to 3/4 of a can in total). Fantastic!

AWESOME!  Very refreshing, and the consistency is perfect!  The tequila taste was pretty strong on my first sip (I used Sauza--maybe a better brand would've taken care of that).  But by the time I finished half a glass, it seemed just right--so in retrospect, I'm glad I didn't splurge on an expensive tequila.  (You know it's a fantastic recipe when you can get away w/ the cheaper ingredients!)  Thanks for this one!

This is a great margarita recipe. Very simple to make. The only change I would make is to use unsweetened frozen strawberries. We all agreed that they were a little too sweet.

Was a BIG hit at my New Year's party.  Will keep this recipe around to use again and again.  Very tasty and perfect.  I filled the blender to the top with ice for a slushy drink.

These are delicious!  I put it all in the blender at once and it was so easy.  The people who did not rate them well need to learn that this is the kind of recipe you tweek to your liking.  If you think it has too much alcohol or not enough, change the amount!  For my preferences, this margharita was perfect.  Also, none of us thought it was too sweet.  There's enough techila to tone down the sweetness in the other ingredients.  Just play with it.  If you are worried about the frozen strawberries with syrup being too sweet, use only 4 oz of them and add either plain frozen or fresh berries.  It's not hard people.  Don't lower the rating of the recipe by several stars just because all of us have different taste buds.

Excellent margarita recipe! At last, I have found "my" drink. Strong enough to kick my butt, but delicious enough to enjoy getting there. I just cannot rave about this drink enough. And it was so easy! I never try mixing drinks, but this one turned out delicious on the first attempt just by following the easy directions. So great!

Great base recipe easy to remember! I substituted Grand Marnier for the triple sec and frozen whole berries not in syrup that I had in freezer. Yummy

I make this recipe and it is good but becomes "OUT of THIS WORLD" with eliminating the Triple Sec and adding 1oz. of Orange Extract, Wow!! Then top it with homemade whipped cream and a mint leaf from the garden coated with some of the powdered sugar.The Orange Extract to me adds the little thing that seems to be missing.

Love these margaritas!  I used Cointreau instead of Triple Sec because I had it in the house.  Some of my girlfriends thought they were a bit strong, but I thought they were perfect.  (They still finished them off though!)

These margaritas rock! I made these this evening and the only change I made was to put in the entire 16 oz container of sliced strawberries rather than just half (8oz). I also added about another ounce of the lime-ade.  I will definitely make these again when friends are over! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I did not care for this recipe.  I'm sorry, but after adding an entire package of frozen strawberries to try to dilute the extreme syrupy flavor of this, it was still waaaaaaay too sweet.  Not to mention the alcohol content was about 4x what it should have been.

I wish I was part of the majority here, but I did not enjoy these margaritas. I used regular frozen strawberries and without the syrup, these were plenty sweet. Over-sweet actually. I used good tequila and triple sec, so perhaps a different limeade would help. Thanks for the recipe though.

Excellent. I made these in our margarita machine and they were fantastic. Guests raved and asked for the recipe. This is now our house rita. Love the powdered sugar touch!

Okay, this was awesome, as good as any I've had in restaurants! I'm still a little tipsy, since I polished off the pitcher! Thanks for a wonderful recipe which will be used again and again!

WOW!  These were really good, but I think they are really strong too.  I don't drink much and after two large glasses I was feeling pretty tipsy.  I will make these again, but I will probably decrease the amount of tequila!

Super easy to make and great margaritas.    Not over-powering, even for my alcohol sensitive wife.  Using a good tequila helps a bunch.  I will make exactly as written again.

Good but use frozen or fresh strawberries without sugar! You could use simple syrup for more sweetness BUT I found the sugar in the lime concentrate to be sweet enough for me! Rub rim of glass with a slice of lime before adding sugar!

Never made these before.  Was in the mood and found this recipe.  Due to the reviews, I followed the recipe with the sweetened strawberries, and added frozen strawberries and less ice.  Awesome!  We are on the fourth pitcher!

First time making a Margarita - it will not be my last!! The only thing I changed was to use fresh strawberries - 3 cups to 1/4 cup sugar - semi froze them and added ALL of them into the blender - which did cut down a bit on the ice...maybe 4+ cups of ice. My Favorite Five (the girls I work with) LOVED them!!! They were so impressed - especially since they know that I have never mixed a drink before in my life....and that has been a long time ;) I mix everything together (except Ice) and freeze. When ready to use I thaw and blend with ice.

Delicious! I used the whole can of limeade and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. I blended everything up (minus the ice), and froze it in a container in the freezer. When I needed it, it was perfectly slushy and delicious. A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made with fresh strawberries, just slice them put them in a ziplock bag with just enough sugar to coat and freeze them. I can't tell you how many times I heard our guest say, "Dang these are good margaritas".

I love the recipe, but I used the frozen the first time, and I had to double it to get strawberry flavor. The next time I used  about 10 fresh strawberries and some juice from the frozen, and that helped. I like the recipe, but you need to decide where your flavor is with the strawberry. Good luck.

Good, but definitely not the best I've ever had and I rarely drink alcohol. I made them for a dinner party and everyone said they were good, but needed something more, but we just couldn't place it. On the plus side, you couldn't taste the alcohol so they went down easy!

This was pretty good. But next time I would add less limeade and more strawberries (but then again I'm a huge strawberry fan and not so much of a lime fan).

Tasted really good, these margaritas helped bring the dinner party to life. I did not have strawberries in syrup so I just added a half a cup of suger syrup (1/4 c of water heated on the stove with 1/4 c of suger until the granules dissolve, chilled in the fridge.) I also used fresh squezed limes instead of the frozen concentrate.

Very good strawberry Margarita, and I can not stand the taste of tequila, but it was very smooth and couldn't even taste it.  My guests said using Patron in mine probaby made the difference...  I wouldn't have known better.

This was pretty good.  For a make at home recipe I really did like it.  I probably won't make it again because I would rather just have a regular margarita.  If you really like strawberry margaritas then you will probably like this!

Awesome!!!  Tasted just like the ones you get at a restaurant!!  I would change nothing.  We made 3 batches last night (for 4 of us) and we all raved about them.  Didn't get tipsy though, like some of the other readers had.  Which is good because I didn't want to get drunk.  Thanks for the great recipe...the limeade really makes it the best!!

I made these on sunday night for a mexican feast and they were a big hit!  Great big strawberry flavor with nice tartness from the lime.  My supermarket didn't have frozen limeade, so I just subbed a can of frozen margarita concentrate.  I believe it was Bacardi brand and it was wonderful!  I will def be making again!

I used half tequila half limon since my husband doesn't care for tequila.  Very yummy, and with those frozen berries, I didn't feel to quilty.  I could tell myself it was a healthy drink (compared to those bottled mixes)

Great little recipe. I did add some Cointreau (orange liquor) for a little extra something but it certainly wasn't needed. Great as written.

I added 4 oz of tequila instead of 6 and just added sugar to the frozen strawberries to make it syrupy. I got large daiquiri glasses and we ended up with two full glasses. Absolutely delicious. Only problem is that... it doesn’t last long ;-)

Perfect combination of tequila and triple sec. I have a Margaritalville blender and this recipe made the perfect Margarita! I used Pomagranite juice instead of strawberries. YUMMY!

Delicious.  Used a Ninja drink blender and it came out a perfect, smooth slush. Cointreau and Cazadores tequila were my choices along with generic limeade concentrate and a cup filled with frozen strawberries then poured over Daily's strawberry mix to the cup mark. It turned out strong but balanced and very drinkable.

This was great! My best friend always talks about how great the margaritas at the Mexican restaurant near our house are and how she wishes she could get the recipe. She said this recipe was better! I did add 1/2 cup of sugar to make it extra sweet

So good!  I cut back the tequila to 4 oz and bumped the triple sec up to 3 because I didn't want the drinks very strong.    Easy & delicious!

This was a huge hit with my strawberry margarita loving friends. It even converted me, who prefers lime margaritas over fruity ones. I did add a little extra strawberries per other reviews. It's my new go to strawberry margarita recipe!

A friend dropped by and asked me to make her a frozen strawberry margarita like the one she had on her recent Florida vacation. A Google search found me this recipe. I did modify it slightly by using 4 oz of fresh lime juice and added 2 oz of cane sugar syrup for sweetness (instead of limeade). It went over well with my guests. Two pitchers full well received. Would have made more but ran out of limes, strawberries and Tequila. Refreshed my stock today!!!!

After working all day on home improvements, my family and I were thirsty.  Looked up some recipes, and this came up.  It did its job well.  I am buzzed and it tasted great.  Alcohol was at a reasonable level for one that drinks.  Great Job!!

I loved this margarita! I actually used a very cheap tequila too so I can't imagine how a nicer brand would taste! I also used lime juice to make the sugar rim and it worked perfectly.

Tasted like a restaurant margarita - I don't have a large blender so I cut the recipe in half and made it in my Nutribullet.  So easy, fast and delicious!

Very good strawberry margarita!  I used strawberry's from Food Lion that had splenda in them.   Changed the flavor a little bit but cut back on the sugar and calories.

My go to and I woudln't change a thing. I keep all the ingredients on hand so to make at any time.  I will sometimes make without adding the strawberries in syrup for a lime version, still just as good.

It was ok I have definitely had better margaritas.  I will stick to fresh strawberries in the future, I felt like using frozen just did not have the same strawberry flavor as using fresh does leaving the drink tasting a little watery.

Tastes like it came from a Mexican restaurant! I was pleased with the turnout. I wish it was a little thicker though. I put 4 ounces of tequila instead of 6 and it was plenty!

This is the Ultimate Strawberry Margarita! The only change I made was to add a little Stevia and use Lime Juice instead of Limeade, to cut down on the sugar.

This was the best-tasting strawberry margarita I ever had!!! Varied the recipe for 4 servings as follows: 4 oz of fresh squeezed lime juice with pulp instead of the lime concentrate; 4 oz of tequila (used Alacran tequila - tequila blanco, 100% agave and 40% alcohol; any tequila blanco or white tequila will work) instead of 6 oz; increased triple sec Cointreanu from 2 oz to 4 oz; increased unsweetened frozen strawberries from 8 oz to 10 oz; added about 2-3 tablespoons of azucar morena to taste; placed all ingredients in the blender and added crushed ice until it was filled. Thanks for sharing the recipe and reviews!

This makes for a great Margarita! Sugar or salt on the glass works. I used Orange flavored Triple Sec, and added whipped cream to the top of the finished product. Rave reviews. Infinitely cheaper than what you'd pay at a restaurant, yet every bit as good

I made these for our Fantasy Football draft.  Being the only girl in the league, I thought I'd get the whole pitcher. The beer drinking guys loved them!  Buy more supplies than you think you'll need.

I did a virgin strawberry margarita and it turned out great. Had to add some water to make up for the lack of liquid but still turned out great!

Very good drink; we use 2 oz of frozen strawberry punch concentrate and 2 oz of limeade, to bring out the strawberry flavor. We also coat the glasses with sugar instead of salt. Because the drink is so fruity, we make a batch w/o tequila for the kids, or pour them some before adding a little less tequila for our drinks. Also, a good orange liqueur will work as a substitute for triple sec.

Fantastic! We made a triple batch for our Cinco de Mayo fiesta! I mixed up all the ingredients (except the ice) the night before, put it in a Ziploc and put it in the freezer. We crushed up a blender full of ice, poured 1/3 of the mixture in, stirred it and then spooned it into our glasses. Repeated twice throughout the night! HUGE hit! Can't wait to experiment with other flavor combos all summer long!

I usually don't rate recipes but this is really good. Highly recommend it. I added a few fresh strawberries to the recipe. You will love it.

This is a great frozen margarita recipe. It was ridiculously easy to make and tasted so good! My sister-in-law noted that many times strawberry margaritas can be too sweet. However, the lime in this margarita recipe provides some tartness that balances it out. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Tried this recipe last night and it was fabulous!  I did sub Grand Marnier for the triple sec and my own frozen berries with a simple syrup for the store-bought frozen berries, but I'm sure it would have been fine as written.  My husband and I both loved it and will definitely be making it again!
