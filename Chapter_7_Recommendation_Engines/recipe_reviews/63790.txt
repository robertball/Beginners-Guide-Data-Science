Wonderful fudge! Everybody had a blast with it,  made it for my brother´s birthday and it was a hit.  However, if you want it thicker use a quarter less of evaporated milk and you´re done, the perfect fudge for any ocassion!!!

Perfect! This was a very easy recipe and turned out awesome. I used one 11oz bag of Dove dark chocolate squares because I'm not a big fan of Hershey's chocolate. The most tedious part was upwrapping all the individual chocolate squares, which I then chopped in the food processor a bit so they'd melt faster. I also used light butter. You can't mess this one up! I cut my squares 8 across and 8 down for 64 servings.

Very easy to make and delicious!  Following a suggestion from another reviewer, I used some leftover Dove chocolates mixed with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Very good!  

I also added pecans to the recipe.  One word of note (I should know better, but forgot) - score/cut the fudge when still warm.

I love this fudge recipe.  It is one of the easiest and tastiest holiday treats I can think of.  And you can use any type of chip, not just chocolate.  Try milk chocolate, or butterscotch, or peanut butter, or a combination!  A suggestion to those who don't like sticky knuckles and manhandling that jar of marshmallow - use plain old marshmallows from the bag.  This recipe called for a 7oz jar of the marshmallow creme, so I just added a heaping cup of marshmallows (to allow for all the air).  Just make sure you start your 5 minute timer before all the marshmallows are melted, the mixture underneath starts to boil way before they all melt.  I just made a batch using partially used bags of chips - a combo of milk chocolate and butterscotch...NUMMY!

Un-freaking-believable.  I had never made fudge before and this was quick, easy, and very yummy.  i love dark chocolate, so this was perfect.  i couldn't find the chips, so i grabbed the equivalent in the big special dark bars and chopped them up.

i also added about a teaspoon of peppermint extract but i probably could have used more to bump up the chocolate-mint flavor.  will definitely make this one again.  especially now that i have a couple more pounds of dark chocolate in my freezer.

Just made this yesterday and got wonderful reviews!  Even my kids liked it.  I doubled the recipe using the 2 cups Special Dark Chocolate Chips and 2 cups Semi-Sweet.  Very, very good.  Will make again for sure!

This was my first attempt at making fudge.  Something went terribly wrong.  After 2 days, it has still not set, even after putting it in the freezer for a few hours.  The directions were very easy to follow...but extra reading of reviews leads me to believe that using a candy thermometer is the way to be sure fudge will turn out. It is unfortunate that I did not know to use one in advance.

This fudge was MUCH sweeter than the name and other comments imply, but it was still delicious. But don't use tinfoil to line the pan -- too much work. I just used cooking spray.

I thought this fudge was fantastic.  The texture was really smooth.  My eaters, however said that it wasn't sweet enough for them.  I'm still rating it highly though.  I loved it!

Very good recipe....however, I did change the dark chocolate to milk chocolate b/c I'm not too fond of dark chocolate.

Dark chocolate chips make a well-known fudge recipe so much better! We like nuts in our fudge, so I added 1 cup chopped walnuts.

I thought this recipe was simple to make and tasted good.  I followed the directions exactly- I've had better fudge but it was bought and probably took a lot longer to make!

This is a great fudge recipe.  I had no problems with it setting up.  It is very rich and smooth.  I will definitely make this again.
