This was perfect for today, as it was very warm/humid and this hit the spot! I used frozen peaches, so it was slushy w/o having to water it down by adding the ice. Also, I added a little more tequila than called for. Hubby loved this and so did I...a definite do-over, and over, and over...Thanks for sharing. :)

Very tasty!  I used very little alcohol, canned peaches and it still tasted great.

a bit sweet for me but I think it will be a hit at my next party. I and my mentor were trying different versions and found out that the entrepreneur in residence at our office liked it with grand mariner not triple sec.

I thought this was alright but hubby took one sip and gave me back his drink.  Probably not the first choice for a man's drink, or for that of a true margarita fan, but a better choice for getting together with the girls.
