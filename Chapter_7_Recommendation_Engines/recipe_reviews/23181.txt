I thought this meal was excellent! Great flavor! My husband loves meals with lots of meat, so I browned 1 pound of ground beef with some fresh cracked black pepper and some chili flakes, drained that and added it to the spaghetti sauce with some of the mozzerella cheese and some pepperoni. I was worried that the spaghetti noodles were going to burn during the first baking, but the noodles were great too. I will make this dish again and I would definately recommend to others! Thanks Kathy!

My picky kids are devouring this as I type.  I accidently used one full cup of cheese in the pasta but it was  yummy and turned out fine.  I was worried that a 9X13 pan would be too big, but the pasta was just enough on the bottom to form a thin crust....a smaller pan would have made for too much pasta.  A whole jar of sauce scared me a tad, but once again, it was enough, possibly could have used a bit more.  Overall, this was a super easy and yummy recipe.  I might even let me kids help me next time.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  I used sausage, olives, green pepper, salami, and pepperoni as the topping (with a little cheese on top too).  My husband took several servings.  I really liked it too - tasted like pizza but more tender and moist.  Will make it again for sure!  (My 2 year old didn't really care for it)

I followed this as written and it turned out GREAT. I have a family of 6 and all of us enjoyed this. I didn't think this was too "soupy", it thickened up as it shimmered. The only addition I would think of adding to it is a little ground beef mixed in with the sauce. This will be a keeper at my house.

Great and easy dish! I used a thick, garden style spaghetti sauce that has green peppers, onions and mushrooms in it and used a combo of sliced pepperoni and canadian bacon (which I layered on top of the spaghetti sauce but UNDER the last layer of moz cheese). Baked well, served with garlic toast and there are no leftovers! Thanks Kathy!

This is a close to the spaghetti pizza my aunt use to make for christmas every year, of course she never taught anyone to make it, or left a recipe for us to find either. Its pretty close only we use leftover spaghetti, and add fresh basil, sundried tomatoes, olives, and mushrooms.

Excellent.  Followed the recipe pretty closely.  For spices I added a little extra.  I added about 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp garlic powder... in addition to the existing spices.  stirred that all up in the spaghetti sauce, same i would if i were making pizza sauce.  i did not sprinkle it on top separate like the recipe suggests.  i also fried up a frozen pizza burger patty and some onion (maybe 1/4 cup, didn't really measure), crumbled it, and stirred it into the sauce too.  i know pizza burgers aren't available in every part of the country, but they are popular in the upper midwest.  added sliced olives and mushrooms to the top along with the pepperoni... delicious.  savory enough for adult taste buds and probably tame/tasty enough for a child too.  also, i was cooking several things at once so i didn't put the crust back in the oven right away.  it was cooled down a lot before i put it back in w/the toppings on.  i think that really helped it to set well.  someone mentioned the spaghetti part getting too hard.  i added a couple small pats of butter to it, after i'd strained it and sprayed the baking dish well.  that did the trick fine.  remained quite moist.  five stars all around.  in my regular rotation now.

Very easy and pretty good, but I'll omit a star because it tastes like your standard 'pasta bake.'

This is a fantastic recipe. On a side note...because I have gluten issues, I make this with gluten-free spaghetti and other ingredients, and it's SO much better than the gluten free pizza you can buy in the freezer section!

This was fun to try.  I basically made half the recipe and I used a springform pan so it would look more like a pizza.  I used more mozzarella and I added a little parmesan cheese to the spaghetti mixture.  I didnâ€™t pre-bake the spaghetti mixture; I just layered my other ingredients on top and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Nothing like regular pizza, but tasty just the same!

Excellent flavor!   I hate store bought spaghetti sauce so I made my own by sauteing some chopped onions in a little olive oil and butter.  Then adding some chopped garlic, 1/2 glass of red wine, some mushrooms, some basil, oregano and a couple tsps. of sugar, a 14-1/2 oz can of diced tomatoes, two small cans of tomato sauce, 3 oz. of tomato paste and I let that simmer while the pasta was cooking.   For the pasta, I used garlic powder and a little salt.   We liked this better than a pizza!

Delicious, loved it! Not dry or soggy. I made it in two springform pans to make it look more "pizza-like" and it worked quite well. Something important to note--this recipe does NOT satisfactorily feed 7 people; next time I would double it for my family of seven.

This was a unique recipe.  It provided a good base.  I used turkey pepperoni, added black olives, ground beef, onion, and garlic, and it turned out pretty good.

This was great!  I made a batch of "Way Easy Pizza Sauce/Bread Stick Dip" from this site, to use as the sauce, and it was a major hit!  Nevt time I might use parchment or non-stick foil instead of just greasing the pan.  That spaghetti had a death-grip on my pan!

This was okay, but I wasn't wild about it. Hubby commented that I could just cook pasta and top it with red sauce, cheese, and pepperoni and it would taste about the same. Not worth making again for us.

The only thing I would note is that a 9x13 would be slightly too large a pan for this recipe.  I used an 8x11 which was a perfect fit (and there was still an inch of room to spare on top.)  My kids loved this dish, of course!  It was very easy and one of your classic comfort foods.

I added meat to the sauce, extra cheese on top, and black olives  to half, and the whole family swore it was awesome. Super easy to make, makes lots, and perfect for picky families!

Kind of like baked spaghetti pie. I used mini pepperoni slices. I used fettuchini noodles because that's what I had on hand, and I missed the part about breaking them into pieces.

This was a new, different way to eat spaghetti and the kids especially loved it. I added browned ground beef to the spaghetti sauce.

This was a really good dish! The only thing I might would do different next time is mix the sauce in with the noodles before baking them. The noodles on the botton were a little dry. I topped mine with pepperoni, sausage and onion and my husband and two boys loved it! It is going in my rotation now!

Eh. This was allright. If I had kiddos I'd probably make this often (but I don't...). I guess when it comes to pizza, nothing compares to the "real" deal. In a pinch (timewise or budgetwise), I'd consider this again, but definitely not "just because." I must say, this is super esay to prepare AND light on the pocketbook (a HUGE plus during these tough economic times), two star qualities I look for in new recipes to try. Another plus? I was able to use up a box of Kraft Spaghetti Classics Dinner and a jar of pizza sauce that I've had for far too long. :) My boxed spaghetti dinner was exactly 8 oz. and the pasta was already broken into bite-sized pieces (hooray!). My pizza sauce was just under 16 oz. Had I opened the 24 oz. jar of Prego pasta sauce in my pantry,  half of it would have gone to waste (I have yet to find a grocery store that sells bottles smaller than this). Overall, this was "OK," but noting more than a Chef Boyardee pizza sans the crust. Thanks anyways, Kathy! :-)

Hubby loved it!  We had some leftover brown rice pasta from last night, so I tossed it in my food processor with the egg, milk, and cheese before putting in the baking dish.  After baking, it looked like a deep dish crust.  I added a bunch of roasted veggies (suggested by another reviewer) to the pasta sauce and threw in some diced ham.  Great flavor and fun change - kind of a pizza lasagna.

YUM!  I had all the general ingredients for this recipe, so I said "Why not?" and what a success! The noodle mixture was super tasty, and I used less mozzarella cheese (because I only had maybe a cup, cup and a half left) but that still worked, and I browned elk sausage with Italian seasoning and minced onion and used it in place of pepperoni. Instead of a 9x13 I used a smaller dish and cooked the same amount of time and it worked out great.  The noodles were a little dry, so I'll up the egg/cheese/milk mix just a little bit and probably more sauce, and the top of the noodles browned a bit during the first baking part (Whoops! Just cover the pan then if that happens) :) I will definitely make this again! :)

This recipe was easy and delicious. I made some changes to accomodate what I had for ingredients, using left over spaghetti, sauce and meatballs I had made the day earlier. This is a great recipe to make when trying to find a new way to serve your left over spaghetti and meatballs!

Great dinner!  What a quick and simple meal to put together.  I use pre-cut spaghetti in place of breaking my own and used fresh basil as opposed to dried.  This recipe is so versatile that you could add whatever your favorite pizza toppings are.  i.e.  onion, green peppers, mushroom, olives, etc.  We had company for dinner and they loved this dish.  I served a tossed salad and garlic bread with this.

Great flavor and easy to make! I went ahead and mixed the pepperoni and added bell pepper and black olives into the egg/pasta/cheese mix and baked it for 20 minutes...(I also did not let the pasta cool...straight from the pot to the baking dish)After the first baking of 20 minutes I added the sauce and extra cheese and baked an additional 10 minutes to melt the cheese. Will definitely make over and over. Thanks for the recipe!

This was Really Good!!! I made it exactly as written and it turned out wonderful.  I agree that it tastes like a traditional pasta bake and not so much like a pizza but it has a bit of a pizza flavor to it, I will most definitely be making this again.

This was really tasty and satisfying! Instead of pepperoni sausage, I used some leftover ground beef. If I were to make this again, I would use a couple more eggs because I love the egg taste.  
     After we ate this, my mom asked me, "When are you going to make this again?" It was a big hit and got devoured quickly.

Made exactly per instructions.  Was a tad bland, and could have used a little more sauce.  My kids all likes it except the one in culinary institute. He thought it needed something also. Will definitely make again but will jazz it up bit.

This would be great for a Potluck. I used mozzarella cheese strings, cubed, in addition to shredded mozzarella. I placed one cube of cheese on each pepperoni; it was pretty. I also used cut up tomatoes, peppers, and onions for the topping. My ten month old and husband enjoyed this dish as much as I did. It was very easy to make. I described it too hubby as a macaroni and cheese dish with mozzarella for the cheese along with a pizza topping. He said it sounded scary but changed his tune once it came out of the oven and onto his plate.

My kids love this recipe and it's easy to make so I love it too.  I added a few more ingredients mushrooms and a lot more cheese but other than that didn't venture too far from original recipe.

I love spaghetti pizza.  An extra egg helps it firm up more. you can multiply the recipe x1.5 and still use a 13x9 pan, but never try to double it w/o more area - it gets too thick and noodley. I suggest adding some italian sausage, peppers, onions, etc to the pepperoni topping.  SO DELICIOUS!

Absoulutely delicous! Not to difficult and delicous! I put pepperoni and fetta cheese on top (half and half) you can put whatever you like on your pizza to make this to your liking. I made this for my family and my 9 year old brother who doesn't like many new things said it was his new favorite food!

It was good, and looked great, but I think it would've been a lot better with more sauce, and less baking time the first time.  But it is definitely something I'd make again.

I thought this was really good, but I did make some changes.
I used angel hair pasta and added an extra egg, forgot to add the milk and used regular parmesan cheese in the noodles.  
I was looking for something to use up my leftover spaghetti sauce and this was perfect.  It also made a ton, so I was able to freeze in single serving portions for later.

This was very good. the only change I made was to add some grated parmesan to the pasta mixture and left out the salt. Also, I didn't have a whole jar of sauce, so I used a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato paste with some spices. I probably would add a little more mozzerella next time. Overall, a very yummy recipe. thank you.

wow, what a unique recipe! i came across this gem while looking for an easy pasta dish. no changes were made aside from using rounded off spices & adding a little sauteed chopped onion to the sauce plus some thin sliced onion to the topping. my boyfriend raved how tasty this "pizza" was at dinner & then again when he ate it the next night as a leftover. many thanks kathy!

also added black olives. I'll definitely be making this again. thanks for posting this recipe!

The kids were disappointed about this dish.  They got excited about the pepperoni but they thought the remainder of the dish was just spaghetti and sauce.  I guess that the baked spaghetti portion didn't stand out enough for their taste buds.

After baking, I added half of the sauce and strirred it into the other half of the spaghetti on top. I also like to add spice to my spaghetti noodles onion & garlic powder, a little salt or garlic salt and Tony Chacheres to give it more flavor.

This recipe was so good. My husband said it was the best baked spaghetti ever and I make baked spaghetti quite often. I did add ground beef to the red sauce, so that was the only thing I changed. It will definitely get added to the dinner routine. Next time I might cut up the pepperoni and add it to the red sauce and just top with cheese. My family just couldn't get enough of this, but I guess everything taste better when you don't cook it.

Great recipe! I didn't have all the ingredients and it still turned out great! It's a great meal to make when you don't have much and don't want spagetti AGAIN! I had to use Italian seasoning instead of just the particular herbs you mentioned and I had to use cheddar instead of mozzerella. But as I said it still came out great my husband and 1 year old girl loved it. This was the first meal she actually asked for seconds on.

My husband looked at the dish like I had lost my mind until he took his first bite. My daughters favorite word for food is YUMMY and that's what they both told me after the first bite. I didn't have pepperoni so I used mushrooms instead. They ate it all up! Easy to substitute to your own taste. I will be making this again and again I'm sure!

My boys liked it-one of them even went back for seconds! There was a little too much sauce for our taste. I did use 1/2 spaghetti sauce & 1/2 pizza sauce. The "crust" stays soft too, so you have to eat it w/a knife & fork. Fun recipe to try! Thanks!

This was good but could use a little more flavor. Perhaps it was the brand of sauce I used. My kids enjoyed it. Used a little more cheese cause thats what my family likes.

this was an interesting idea, but nothing very exciting. just tasted like spaghetti with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. i probably should have decreased the baking time (the spaghetti ended up sort of dry and really crispy at the edges) and added more sauce. it wasn't disgusting or anything, but i probably won't make it again.

I give it a three because I've had much better spaghetti pizza that stayed together as a crush and was more pizza like.  Maybe it needed more noodles than suggested but it was flimsy and we had to use forks to eat it because it was so messy.  I do suggest for those interested in switching toppings to add sausage meatballs.  Buy the tube breakfast sausage and roll it into little balls, tastes FABULOUS.  Wasn't great but I'm sure this could have been worse, just a spaghetti bake really.  Oh well, I'll keep trying until I find one better.

This recipe was Amazing!! My whole family loved it. The next time I make it I will add some green Peppers and mushrooms for more pizza effect. My dad, the food critic, gave me the OK to make it again.

My kids definately did love this, so that's always a plus, but for the hubby and I, it was nothing to write home about.  It was just too much like plain spaghetti with pepperoni on top, maybe it needs another egg? some parm cheese with the noodles?  If pepperoni is ever on sale really cheap again, then I might make this, but wouldn't go out of my way to make it again.  Always nice to try a new dinner though!  Thank you!

I used corkscrew pasta and then misread the recipe and just mixed up everything and popped it in the oven. It was pretty good, but I will make it again, properly. I'll also add onions and olives to make it more pizza-like.

This was so simple and tasted great. The only thing I did differently was that I didn't let the spaghetti cool and I added a little more cheese.

Made this for my 19 year old. It brought back wonderful memories from his chidhood when I would let him and his brother help me. They loved to put pineapple and ham on theirs. I only had tomatoes and ham on hand and it turned out fantastic. We sprinkled parmesan on top. Thanks!!!

I thought this recipe was really good.  We all loved this, even my two young sons, 5 & 2.  It was very easy and very tasty.  I even  forgot to lower the oven temp. and it still tasted good, just a little crispy.  Will definately make again. Thanks Kathy!

We absolutely love this recipe!  
We double the sauce and leave out the basil and oregano because it's already in the spaghetti sauce so I felt it was a waste of money.  It's not something kept in our pantry.  I found this recipe a few weeks ago and it has become a weekly meal!  Even the child who doesnt care for spaghetti comes back for seconds!!

This was so delicious! Much better than I thought it would be. My kids have been fighting all day so told them they had to agree upon a recipe and cook it for dinner. Well they chose this and they did wonderfully. They did add ground beef.

This is good for kids; adults find it a bit unpalatable. The spaghetti is rather bland, even with added herbs. After preparing by the recipe, we dipped in extra marinara. I probably won't make it again unless hosting a party for children.

I used a 1lb bag of good quality rigatoni, and only boiled for 6mins, instead of 10. Doubled everything else, and used basil, shredded Swiss, sharp, and grated Parmesan, along with the mozzarella. I used a large cast iron skillet. I put the oven back to 425Â° during last 10mins to brown the pepperoni. Super good!!!!!

This dish is just ok, if you follow it as written. Husband didn't like. Not sure why this has such a high rating but most of the high ratings mention that they made alterations (add hamburger, etc). Honestly, I don't think it's worth making again even with the suggestions.

This was fantastic!! The only change I made was  that I used my own low fodmap pizza sauce and mixed in turkey Italian sausage. 
I also made this gluten free by using GF spaghetti.

This is a family favorite, even the picky little ones like it! The only change I make is to add one pound of browned ground beef between the noodles and sauce. Makes it more hearty!

Being a guy, I simply had to add more meat and cheese to this. I used one prepack of salami, ham and pepperoni meant for making pizzas, and quite a bit more mozzarella. This was fast, easy, and very tasty. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It was good. Not sure if all the extra prep makes it any better than just plain spaghetti, though. I think it gets points for presentation.

Great family dish. I'm sure it's been said before, but adding some mild Italian pork really kicked this dish up to another level. I browned the sausage and added onion and a little garlic before I added the sauce. Then covered and simmered while I prepared the noodles. ????

I didn't change a thing, went with recipe as written, and served with crusty bread and Caesar salad

I love it when a plan comes together. This was perfect for my four year old...spaghetti and pizza??? What a no brainer...he asked for seconds if you were wondering about taste. I enjoyed the dish as well. I went a bit too sauce heavy and added parmesan. Your child/ren can help prepare as mine did and we decided to add cheese on too of pepperoni.

I am not a foodie by any means and think that if your going to change someone's recipe than its not a true review.  I made this dish exactly the way it's written here.  We loved it, my husband had three servings and he isnt a big guy.  My daughter (4) had just eaten at grandma's, climbed up to the table and ate and entire regular serving.  This is one that I will make again.  They both loved it.  Thanks.

This is a big hit with my family. Even my husband, who is not a fan of casseroles, enjoyed it. Even reheated the next day, it was still delicious.

Great recipe. I made it for a large family gathering and everyone went back for seconds!  I doubled the recipe and it turned out just fine!
