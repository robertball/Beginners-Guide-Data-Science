Amazing!  Totally elegant in presentation and flavor they'll never guess how quick and simple it was to make.  It makes the house smell wonderful too.  I LOVE it with the basil.  To avoid a "hay" taste be sure to fry the basil to BRIGHT GREEN and NOT DARK GREEN or Black!


I'm updating because I have made this several times now and tonight the grocery store did not have any fresh basil.  I bought a bag of prewashed baby spinach and fried it instead and then added 2 teaspoons of dried basil to the sauce as I was cooking it.  It was just as good and the baby spinach is about half the price or less than the basil.

Also definately don't try making this with anything but real grape tomatoes.  Their sweet unique flavor is what really does it for this dish.

AND COOKING WINE!  My store was out of cooking wine and I tried using a medium dry white and YUCK!!!

DELICIOUS!! Restaurant quality dish! and I couldn't believe how incredibly easy!! The whole family LOVED this!! I used chicken thighs instead of breasts (we prefer dark meat)and followed the recipe exact. The chicken was super tender and full of flavor! As others said, the only problem is this doesn't call for enough rice. Double the rice to 2 cups, serve with some fresh steamed broccoli and you've got yourself an incredible meal!! This is a must try!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe Amanda!! :)

Great dish, the whole family enjoyed it.  I thought it was a little sour for my taste, though, so if I did it again, I think I'd put a little less wine and vinegar, and perhaps some onions for some sweetness.

Apart from the extremely weird basil garnish - which does indeed have a distinctly grassy taste - this was a really tasty, really easy meal. I wasn't sure whether or not to keep the skin on the chicken, so I took the healthier option, and removed it. I was making 2 servings, but I used a whole can of low sodium, fat-free chicky broth, and simmered the breasts in it, turning them every 5 mins or so. I omitted the wine because I only had cheap plonk, and I know from experience that that sort of crappola adds nothing good to a dish. Great recipe. Thanks!

We love the flavour of fresh basil, but did not care for the flavour of the fried basil..it almost had a 'hay' taste to it?? Will make this again, but will not fry the basil, but will add at the end! Also felt like there was way too much broth.

This was very good.  I had a lot of fresh grape tomatoes from my garden that I used and it was excellent.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of chicken halves and it was super tender. I will definately make again and I am anxious to serve for company.

This was great!  Chicken is best when it is simmered in liquid sauce becuase it will not dry out.

This recipe was excellent.  The fried Basil and balsamic vinegar gave the chicken a wonderful, unique flavor.  I replaced some of the rice water with the extra chicken broth from the can and also added the extra Basil oil from the pan to keep it from sticking and give it a little extra flavor.  I would suggest using more rice, as one cup didn’t make enough for everyone.  I excluded the tomatoes because I didn’t have any on hand and didn’t miss them at all.  The fried Basil made for a grand presentation.  Rave reviews from everyone.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Amanda.  I’ll definitely be making this one again!

I am always looking for something new and different to try out on my family!  I have kids from age 2 to 14, so it can't be too fancy, or they'll complain!  The consensus was "Make that again!"  It went over very well.  As another reviewer commented, the recipe needs more rice, but otherwise...a great recipe!  VERY flavorful!

The crunchy basil was quite different but added just the right touch.  Enjoyed this very much - served over white rice.  I had guests over and served it for lunch, even a self admitted tomato hater my friend thought it was great...

This was pretty good.  A combo of sweet and tart.  I might use a little less wine if I make it again.  I took others advice and did not put the fried basil back on at the end.  The chicken came out nice and juicy.  Also a good way to use up some of the cherry tomatoes and basil in my garden!

Easy but just average, nothing to blow my hair back or give me a reason to make it again, but decent enough to try it, the fried basil thing is what caught me, though the process was inspiring, it really lacked that fresh basil flavor after being fried.

Good but still a bit bland unless you get a little bit of every ingredient on your fork. It was pretty nevertheless. I think the rice could be left out very easily. I made it with artichoke risotto. Also, added fresh minced garlic.

Sauté the basil just until it no longer looks fresh. It will crisp after you blot it. I did about a minute and a half at med. low heat. I wasn't sure how to brown 2 sides of a bone-in chicken breast so I used boneless. It worked well. also when I was done with the basil there was only just enough oil in the deep fry pan to do the browning, so I didn't pour any off. I wasn't sure how you got from fresh breast to chicken pieces so I added an extra step. After the meat was mostly done I removed it, cut into bite-sized chunks and returned it to the pan for a couple minutes before adding the tomatoes. I absolutely loved the nuanced flavor with basil, thyme, balsamic and wine. Will make this again.

Made this because I needed to use some fresh basil and I don't like throwing food out. A few twitches: didn't fry the basil, used it fresh , it's my favorite herb and I thought it would take away from the amazing flavor if cooked in any way. Added garlic and served on basmati rice. Best thing about it was the sauce, which definitely needed the garlic to kick it up a notch:) plus I use garlic in almost all my dishes. The grape tomatoes added sweetness to sauce and I wished I had more sauce for next day's leftovers. Definitely will make again!

I made this tonight and we really liked it.  I did not have any bone-in chicken, so used boneless chicken breast and reduced the cooking time.  I halved the recipe and left out the bay leaf.  I used cherry and mini pear tomatoes from the garden, and used slightly less wine (Riesling) and balsamic vinegar.  I also added some chopped onion and garlic to the sauce, and fried sage along with the basil.  For those who do not care for the fried basil, try frying sage. It is delicious and tastes great in this dish.  We ate this with Jasmine rice and home baked bread.  We will definitely be making this again!

I cannot imagine why anyone would rate this as bland.  I forgot the fresh basil ( even though I had it in my garden).  It was just delicious.  Put marinade in the baking chicken topped with sauted basil and tomatoes then fresh mozarella,perfectly yummy!

First of all, we really liked it. I did use  1/2 cup of basil, and we  loved that.  I fried it just a minute or so and it was crispy, I also added about three cloves of freshly minced garlic just before I added the wine and broth. But  I never know what kind of  wine to use, I used Fetzer Chardonnay. But, here we go. I don't know if my  Chicken breasts are always too large. It said to cook till chicken is done and sauce  is reduced.  How reduced should it be?  If  it is covered the sauce isn't going to reduce very much.  So mine didn't reduce  much . I did  simmer the for about 35 minutes    That is OK, I added a little of Wondra with some leftover Chicken broth that was left  in the can  to thicken a little.  Not much... But the directions were not good at that point.  I usually don't alter a recipe  at all, but.... Cherry tomatoes were  3.99 for a pint, that is more than my  chicken cost on sale. (I was lucky and believe this or not,  I  paid only .79 a pound for split chicken breasts with the bone,  12/5/2009)  So  I used a can of diced tomatoes, very well drained and put on paper towels to drain them more.  I  put them with the chicken and sauce  and turned off the heat.  They were still heated through.We loved the end result.  I really didn't alter the recipe that much and am happy to know I could use the canned tomatoes, altho I think I would prefer the cherry, if I had them  Four stars because they really don't tell you how much to reduce the sauce. A keeper for sure.

Definitely would NOT fry the basil next time.  It makes it super dry, oily, and pretty flavorless.  Other than that I liked the recipe.

I really liked this recipe and will make it again. I only rated it 4 stars because at medium high heat my basil was burned to a crisp within one minute. Luckily I had extra so I turned down the heat to medium and only cooked it for about 30 seconds and then it was perfect. Also, I needed way more time and a higher heat to reduce the sauce by half. Because it took so long and I had already added the tomatoes, I ended up cooking the tomatoes while the sauce was simmering, which I thought ended up delicious. In the end, It was a hit with my family, including two picky kids. Definitely a keeper.

I really enjoyed this dish. I left out the wine, used bone-in chicken thighs, marinated them for about an hour, and cooked them in a pressure cooker. Very tasty. The fried basil is a brilliant touch.

I used this recipe with boneless chicken breasts and I didn't have fresh basil at home BUT it still came out delicious . . . chicken was very tender and juicy, and the sauce tasted great!  Thanks for a quick, easy and tasty recipe!

I made this last night and didn't have a few ingredients, so I left out the fresh basil and used V8 golden butternut squash soup instead of chicken broth.  I have no idea how the original recipe would taste in comparison, but this version was really yummy.  I will have to make it the original way next time just to see!  But making it with the butternut squash soup gets you some veggies too!  I also used about half the amount of oil that the original recipe called for and served it with brown rice.

This was delicious! Even my picky eaters ate it! I didn't have any balsamic vinegar so I used Balsamic Glaze instead so it turned out darker then the picture shown. My kids were fighting over the left over sauce to use on their rice (and they don't eat rice.) I will definitely be making this again!

It was ok.  Everyone thought it was attractive and ate it, but it was a little bland.  I think having the white wine and the vinegar was a little much.  I'd cut out the vinegar all together (and I love balsamic vinegar!).  Either way, I should have taste tested it and added some sugar to get rid of some the vinegar taste!  I think maybe it would have been better if I mixed a couple tablespoons of butter and a cup of feta in with the rice?  Maybe add lemon juice to the sauce, cut out the thyme, and use oregano instead?  Or perhaps stuff the chicken with tomato basil goat cheese?  I'm sure I would have enjoyed this recipe much more if I didn't already have one so similar that was a lot tastier.

My family & I were not very impressed with this recipe. I am so bummed. I couldn't wait to taste it because of all of the good reviews & the ingredients are all some of my favorites.  It was very bland, I wish I had thought to add some garlic to the sauce like some other reviews suggested. The fried basil tasted very oily to me so it was not my favorite. I probably won't be making this again, sadly.

This was an easy and excellent dish to make. The basil only needs to fry for a minute or two--don't leave it in longer or it will be gross. At the very end, I removed the chicken and tomatoes and added a chickenbroth/cornstarch mixture to the sauce to thicken it slightly. I also am not a huge thyme fan, so I will probably substitute with basil or oregan next time I make it.  And I will definitely make it again.

De-lish.  I used thighs instead of breasts - we're a dark-meat family.  The recipe didn't specify, so I cooked them skin-on, which I believe added flavor.  And I used a good chardonnay (never "cooking wine"), and my wife gladly helped me finish the bottle.  Best the first time - the leftovers were good, but the nice contrast the tomatoes gave was muted by sitting in the fridge and then reheating.

I'm not sure if I fried the basil for too long, but it didn't really taste like much... kind of like dried seaweed, the kind you get on the outside of your sushi.  Other than that, I absolutely loved the flavor of the wine/broth sauce on the chicken and mixed in with the rice.  I added about 4 cloves of diced garlic to the sauce to simmer down with it for extra flavor.  This is one of my husband's very favorite dishes.

This is absolutely delicious!!  My best friend & I made it last night.  The flavors are perfect together.  The only change we made was to thicken the sauce with a tablespoon of cornstarch and we served it over Jasmine rice, man was it devine!!

What a wonderful recipe and so easy!  I'm not sure that I would change anything.   It all worked out superbly.  The only thing different that I did was to uncover the pan as I was reducing the liquid.  After a short while, I did put a cover on the pan and continued with the original instructions.  I served this with butter/garlic fresh mushrooms.  Will definitely keep and do this recipe over and over again.  Loved it!

This recipe is great.  So easy to prepare.  I used the frozen chicken breast that come in a bag - so quick to thaw.  The white wine gave it a great taste. I highly recommend this.

Great recipe! Nice flavour and the chicken was very tender.  I had a bit of a problem getting the sauce to reduce, so I ended up adding a bit of cornstarch to thicken it.  Thanks to the poster!

I really liked this.  It wasn't "out of this world" but perfect for a weeknight dinner.  The sauce could have used more flavor - maybe garlic?
