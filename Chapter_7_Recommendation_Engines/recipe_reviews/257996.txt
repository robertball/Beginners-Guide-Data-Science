This was great! The changes we made were we only put 8 oz. mushroom, and we squeezed a wedge of lime in each person's bowl because I like a little tangyness. Simple to make. We found the lemongrass paste (Lee Kum Kee brand) at Ranch 99 Market, the no-msg red curry paste at Sprouts health food store, and for the Indonesian paste we used 1 dried chili pepper but this didn't make the dish spicy at all.
