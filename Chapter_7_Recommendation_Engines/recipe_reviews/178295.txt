Hi all... I submitted this recipe - just to clarify, I use two packages of the King Hawaiian Sweet dinner rolls (in the orange bag, remove the cardboard tray it comes in).  You can just slice the tops off all at once and spread the beef mixture on the "bottoms".  Make sure to spray the foil with Pam so they don't stick.  I also don't put them on a cookie sheet, just wrap the whole thing in foil and pop in the oven, this prevents the bottoms from burning against the hot cookie sheet and keeps the buns soft.  Make sure to drain the grease and let the beef mixture cool a bit before adding mayo and cheese so it doesn't separate and get too oily.  These are always the hit of the party!  Tastes just like White Castles!

Great advice to just cook these wrapped in foil and of course drain the beef and cool before adding the cheese and mayo and using 1/2 to 3/4 of the onion mix ! The only addition I made to the recipe that continues to result in men and women asking for my recipe is: I add a special butter sauce to the top, borrowed from another great recipe.  Here it is:  2 tbsp minced onion flakes, 1 tbsp worchestershire sauce, 1 tbsp Dijon or Spicey Mustard (not the regular yellow), 1/2 cup melted butter.  You melt these together and brush ontop of the buns just before you put in the oven to bake.  The men who have eaten this, always ask for the recipe!

I have made these twice and I did not cook the meat before adding to the buns.  I just mixed everything together, put the mixture on the buns and baked for 30 min.  They turned out fantastic!!!

I made this recipe today for 47 kids ranging in age from 6-17. The kids LOVED it!  I tripled the recipe, although I cooked it as written for each batch.  I thought the meat mixture would be more consistant doing it that way...and it would take the guess work out of how much meat goes on a package of rolls...I rated it 4 stars because of changes I made.  I usually ALWAYS make the recipe exactly as stated the first time around, but couldn't on this one.  The recipe doesn't call for draining the ground beef after it is cooked, which I felt needed to be done.  I think it would be too greasy otherwise.  I followed the recipe other than draining the grease and adding a pickle to the burger before I baked it.  I also followed the review from the Dena who posted the recipe, i.e. not using a baking pan and waiting for the meat to cool before adding the mayo/cheese also, I used Hawaiian King rolls as suggested.  Thank you SO much for a fabulous recipe!  I will definitely make it again and again!

I tried this recipe with two packages of onion soup mix as suggested by DenaInChicago. Both my husband and I thought it was way too salty. I could only eat one because of how salty it was. I liked the extra onion flavor, but not the extra salt. I'm going to try it again with only 1 package of soup mix and some diced onions for the extra onion flavor. I think I'll make this a regular for us, just never again with 2 packages of soup mix.

We loved these!  So, so tasty and very easy.  Used the King's Hawaiian rolls from the deli section of the grocery.  We served these at a party.  Since I wanted as little prep as possible the day of the party, I browned the beef w/ soup mix the day before and put in a tupperware.  The next day, I threw the meat mix in the microwave for a couple of minutes while I got the cheese and mayo (among other party fixings) ready to go.  Mixed everything up, put it on the rolls and popped in the oven.  My husband raved--said it was way better than Krystal burgers!  I'd definitely make these again, especially for a football party or the like.

These were delicious! The kids  said I should make them all the time!  DH said they taste like White Castles!..  I chopped up a small onion real fine and simmered it into my meat,skipped the soup mix.  Only 4 stars because with all the mayo and cheese they were quite rich and I could only eat two; next time I may cut it back to half the cheese and mayo!..  I actually used one package of rolls(12) with half the filling for dinner and still had the other package of rolls and half the filling for the next day.

So yummy! I added some finely chopped onion while cooking the meat, used 93/7 ground turkey, and topped the burgers with sliced dill pickles before baking. Other than that, I followed the recipe. These are so close to White Castle burgers and even better, you can make tweaks to make them healthier, like using wheat buns. If you're worried about how much onion soup mix you're using, just add less at first and more to taste after the meat has cooked. Adding a little water can help the meat soak it up. I will definitely be making these again.

Love it! An easy and unique way to prepare sliders. I used 1 pound of beef to make 12 burgers instead of 24, and added a chopped onion to the skillet when cooking the meat. Also added the pickle to the burgers prior to baking. Came out great and I'll definitely be making these again and trying some different mixes.

I made this once following the directions of the recipe and would give it 2 stars (the mayo was just too much), but the second time I made them I modified it a little.  I used 2 lbs. ground sirloin, 1 envelope onion soup mix, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp pepper.  I cooked the meat and chopped until the sirloin was left in very fine crumbles.  I then drained the fat and added 1 cup of shredded cheddar and only 1 tablespoon of mayo.  I topped the burgers with finely chopped, sauteed onions and placed them in the oven with the buns.  Once heated I topped them with thin dill slices with just a dab of mustard and ketchup.  They were very good.

These did not work for my family at all. Scaled it down to make 12, called for 1/2 cup mayo, put less the 1/4 cup and the mayo was all I could taste - not good. Bummer, was hoping this could be come a new add in to the rotation since it is easy to prepare. Oh well, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose...

I do these slightly differently.  I mix the ground beef and onion soup mix (don't use the mayo) then spread in a 13x 9 pan (looks like brownies).  Bake 10-15 mins at 350.  When done, cut into brownies size.  Put mini burger on mini rolls (I get them from Costco) then put a piece of cheese on top.  Serve with Ketchup, Mustard and Pickles.  Everyone loves them.

These were delicious.  I had to cut down a little on the mayo and cheese because I didn't make sure I had enough, but it still tasted amazing.  Added some garlic pickles and a little more cheese while in the oven.  Pretty darn close to the restaurant chain.  Thanks for the post.

Excellent! I made these for New Years Eve and everyone loved them. I did finely mince some onion and sauted them in a lil broth and butter. After I cut the rolls and added my filling I took the top buns and spread the onion mixture on the inside before baking. Thanks for the post!

I have been dying to make these and was not disappointed. I halved the recipe but only used approx 1/4 of the onion soup envelope.  I didn't want the taste to be too pungent and it was just perfect. I served on potato dinner rolls - WOW. I can't wait to make again and again. Update: I make these often now, just as good with ground turkkey meat (surprise, surprise) and added real bacon bits.

These are super yummy.  Perfect for our crowd here.  I brushed some of the tops of them with the butter/mustard/Worcestershire recommended by Cookin4therapy (reviewed Jan 28, 2010) and that made them even better and the buns were soft and steamy. I think a little minced onion is good addition, too.  Delicious!

Pretty Good, but a little bland. I added pepper but should have added some additional seasoning.

EDIT : Made these a second time. I added more seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder), and did what other users mentioned where I spread the meat mixture on a pan and cooked in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350. Then I cut it into little squares with a pizza cutter and put it on the buns, which then went in the oven just to heat the bread. I really don't see the point in adding mayo to the meat mix, because I could not even taste it. Next time I will just add cheese and mayo on top. I know this is not really the recipe as written, but at least it inspired me to personalize it into something different that works for my fam.

We really enjoyed these! I followed the recipe exactly except for using 1/2 of the amount of mayo - just a personal preference. Will definitely make them again especially for football watching!

These were a huge hit with my poker playing buddies. The sandwiches stayed nice and compact and held up well. Easy to grab and go ... and 'go' they did. They couldn't stop eating them. I made it according to instructions. However, I bought Angus beef which had very little fat, so I had to add a bit of beef broth to get the onion soup to incorporate. One suggestion... RESIST the urge to salt the beef. There is more than enough salt in the soup mix. If you add salt.. it will be too much. I did add some pepper to taste, becasue my guys like pepper. BIG HIT!!!!

special butter sauce to the top, borrowed from another great recipe. Here it is: 2 tbsp minced onion flakes, 1 tbsp worchestershire sauce, 1 tbsp Dijon or Spicey Mustard (not the regular yellow), 1/2 cup melted butter. You melt these together and brush ontop of the buns just before you put in the oven to bake. The men who have eaten this, always ask for the recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I actually put them into reg. hamburger buns,skipped the oven step and just placed them into the freezer as is so I can have a fast meal anytime.I was able to make about 8 sandwiches using 1/4 cup of meat per bun,and still had some leftover meat that I also froze for a later use.

I made these for a party - they were good but I think using some different seasonings instead of onion soup mix would be better.

Oh my gosh this recipe is SO good!!!!  I'm never going to White Castle again.  I made it with ground turkey, fat free mayo and fat free cheese.  I followed others' suggestions and baked them wrapped in the foil (not on a cookie sheet.)  Ours came out a little crispy so next time I will probably only bake for 10 minutes so it can melt together (since everything in it is alreay cooked.)  We used sandwich rolls though so it might be different with the regular buns.

These tasted so good! I don't care for onion soup mix so I added chopped onion.  The only problem that I had was the buns were a little crusty ( I may not have sealed the foil enough).   The next time I made these, I skipped the oven part all together and just popped them in the microwave for a few seconds after I had assembled them.  It didnt seem necessary to bake them, since the beef was already cooked thru.  They came out perfect!  The buns were so soft... just like the restaurant.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

We just tried these and thought they were sort of off. Tasted much too strong of soup mix. I usually make them with 1tbs chopped red onion and 1/2 teas granulated garlic plus 1 tsp Weber Chicago Steak Seasoning. Salt and pepper to taste and to pump up the beef flavor a ¼ tsp of real butter placed on top of small patty after you turn them brings out the beef flavor especially if you using 90% lean beef ground at the shop. Pan toast the rolls and use of just a small amount of mayo along with a single small piece of bib lettuce for garnish. Pickles, ketchup and mustard and even tomato, all seem to overwhelm the flavor of these small sliders. A ½ slice of cheddar or pepper jack cheese however is a nice touch.

Made these as directed but with 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef and scaled the remaining ingredients to that. I was baking curly fries at the same time, so put the temp. at 400 to accomodate both things. Lost track of time and left the sliders in the entire 30 mins. The bottom of the rolls were a little hard, but that was my mistake. Still, there was something missing from the taste. DH liked them, I thought they were ok, kids weren't impressed. Will try them again and want to try the sauce recipe for the rolls that is recommended in another review. 3.28.11

Since saving this to my recipe box nearly a year ago, I've made these tasty little beauties quite a few times. Using only 1lb of 93 or 96% lean ground beef, I make these using tips from the submitter herself....slice a package of King's Hawaiian rolls in half lengthwise, and spread the hamburger mixture on the bottom, and replace the "tops" and wrap in foil sprayed with Pam. Place the wrapped packet directly on the oven rack and bake. Perfect every time with no burnt bottoms!  Oh-so easy, and yummy little gems, these babies are definitely remaining on my Friday night rotation!

Tried to make these a *little* healther by using lean ground turkey in place of beef, and low-fat Mayo and 2% shredded sharp cheddar.  NO ONE could tell the difference!  They were a huge hit!  Great appetizer for football parties.   Next time, I think I will even add some diced onion though for personal preference.

Pretty good! My hubby & I stayed in today to watch the Bears vs. Packers NFC Championship game. We were GLUED to the TV, so this was perfect! I browned my beef last nite, assembled my burgers this AM & then popped everything in the oven during the pre game. When the game began, our burgers were ready to enjoy. :) I must admit, these were good, but in the end (based on my changes), I should have made LUANNRAN's burger bites instead. Here's what I did: a) cut recipe in 1/2, b) added 1/4 c. dried minced onion to my beef (i.e. during browning step) & c) used fresh dinner rolls instead of Hawaiian rolls (the "Castle" doesn't serve their burgers on sweet rolls, so I figured I shouldn't either...). In retrospect, I wish I would have added an entire packet of onion soup mix, a 1/2 c. of minced onion & slightly more mayo (as per LUANNRAN's recipe). My burgers weren't as "oniony" as I wanted them to be & were a tad dry. I also wish I would have used Aunt Millie's dinner rolls instead of my grocer's ones. The name brand rolls seemed softer & I suspect would have been easier to slice b/c of this (oddly, the fresh rolls crumbled when sliced). Oh, and I will pat my meat mixture onto a cookie sheet, score into squares, partially freeze & then place on ea. bun (for authenticy's sake). NOTE: I had quite a bit of leftover meat. A full lb. of meat yields more than 12 burgers! Served w/ crinkle-cut fries & vanilla Coke (just how I order it at the chain), this was a FUN meal. Thanks MN_Girl! :-)

I LOVE these!  They are super easy to prepare.  I dice up and sautee an onion instead of using the soup mix...and only use about 2-3tablespoons of mayo.  They are a BIG hit in our house..and I've shared the receipe with numerous friends who have tried it and loved it as well!  Thanks so much..this is definitely a keeper!!

These were easy to make and pleased a crowd! Thank you for the recipe and the idea. I'll be making these again for parties. I didn't use the cheddar cheese since of my guests was lactose intolerant but did put blue cheese on half of these bad boys and they were great! Thanks again. I'll be making these with different cheeses for parties!

I made these for the second time last night.  They are delicious!! They are so easy to prepare.  The only change I made was to brown and drain the beef and THEN add the onion soup mix.  I was afraid that if I added the mix before draining, I would lose a lot of flavor.  My 4 boys love when I make these.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe made alot of filling and it made 24 sliders. So easy to make and good for a crowd. Added a montreal steak seasoning and will season the meat more with it the next time I make them.

This is an excellent recipe for a quick ground beef dinner! I followed the advice of other reviews and didn't use a baking sheet, sprayed the foil with Pam, and had to adjust for 12 instead of 24 but still used the recipe as written, just cut in half. Thank you for posting!

So good and so easy. What a nice change from a barbecue sandwich or sloppy joe. I had some 6" sub sandwich buns and used those for this. Served with dill spears. My husband "never" comments on recipes but he said you should make another batch of these and wrap them up in the foil and put them in the freezer to have another time.  good idea. I did and they heated up just fine. You do not need any other seasoning with the onion soup mix either. Leave just as written.

I made these right on with the recipe and they were AWESOME. I was sure to let the meat sit in the strainer til it got near cold, then wiped the skillet out with a paper towel, then put the meat back in the skillet. I did measure the mayo right on but just winged the shredded cheese (cause you can never have too much IMO). Stirred it up then did like Minn_Girl suggested and just sliced the tops off, scooped out a bunch of mix and slathered it on, then replaced the tops, wrapped in foil and baked. I didn't even use PAM on the foil because I don't keep that stuff in the house, and only the few little pieces that feel between the buns actually stuck to the foil! All 4 of my kids loved them, and I was thrilled! I even used wheat dinner rolls cause that's how we roll in our house and they were awesome. Like others, I may try laying a slice of american cheese or some jalapeno slices or sauteed onion rings on top of the mix before putting the tops of the buns back on. Totally awesome job Minn_Girl! You've just added a favorite to this houses' menu planning!

Everybody at the party LOVED these!  I did use all the ingredients/measurements in the original recipe, but I prepped them in advance, so just wanted to let you know you CAN do it that way.  Oh, also I doubled everything, and that worked out just fine.

Several days ahead of time, I cooked the beef/onion soup mix, drained it, put it in a container & into the freezer.  2 days before the party, I took the beef out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw.  The morning of the party, I mixed the beef with the cheese & mayo, sliced the buns/put them in the pan, scooped the beef mixture into the buns, added 2 pickle slices each, and covered the whole thing, put it back in the fridge.  They needed extra time to cook (coming straight out of the fridge like that) - maybe 45 minutes.

I am telling you, (almost) everyone at the party raved!  You are never going to please everybody - but you are going to please ALMOST everybody with this one!

I've been making these for years, and never reviewed them, we had them for dinner tonight, so I figured I should probably review them and thank the author of this recipe(Thank you!). These sliders are just so good, easy, and such a crowd-pleaser! These make a ton as written, so if you you're cooking for just a few, halve the recipe OR, do what I do, freeze unbaked sandwiches in foil packets. I freeze 2 dinner rolls per packet, then you can pull them out and bake them right out of the freezer for a quick and tasty meal. I use Hawaiian sweet dinner rolls to make these, though I have made them with crescent rolls before and they're great, just  fill each triangle with some of the meat mixture, roll them up and bake as directed on the can. I also put the onion soup mix in my bullet, to pulverize the onion pieces, which is just a personal preference. I never measure the mayo, I just add enough until it "looks right". I doubt it's a full half cup, probably closer to 1/4 cup, but it's always come out fantastic! Another thing I love about this recipe is I only have one pan to clean! Everything gets mixed up in the skillet, and then onto a foil covered pan. I quadrupled this recipe for a party, and I still only used 1 pan!  I can't thank you enough for this recipe! It's a winner! :)

Made this recipe for GOURMET CLUB,(American Comfort Food theme) believe it or not, and got rave reviews. Kids ate quite a few before I even got out of the house, and the adults loved them as well. Came home without any leftovers.Everyone wanted the recipe. Kids begged me to make them again the next day. Might try to add an additional piece of cheese and extra onions on top next time

Delicious little burgers. I used Quorn in place of ground beef, Hellman's Light Mayo, and 2% cheddar cheese. 5 Weight Watchers PointsPlus per burger.

My "picky eaters" kids loved these!! I loved these!!! I cut the recipe in half just in case we did not like them. However, I wish I hadn't. I did use less mayo per another reviewer's advice. I also cut the time in the oven to 20 minutes based on another reviewer's advice. Except for those changes, I made these hamburgers exactly as written. By the way, DO NOT PUT THESE ON A COOKIE SHEET. I only used foil and the buns came out soft. These were a hit and I will definitely be making these again.

I make these all the time. They are a great snack food for the week. Pop in the micro for 30 seconds. A great variation is to reuce the cheddar by one cup and add bacon pieces and blue cheese crumbles.

This is an awesome recipe. My family loves it. My Kids who "hate onions" luv these.  I usually cut the recipe in half for my family of four.  I use ground turkey instead of beef. I find it less greasy.  I brown the turkey in water (1 Cup per pound) and drain off water when meat is cooked. It comes out moist.

easy and taste's pretty close to Krystal's burgers!  The downside is that you might have some heartburn later.

I have to confess that these do absolutely nothing for me.  But my family goes bonkers over them!  I have to give them a full five stars; my 5 year old is having them as an evening snack!  And most definitely, DON'T put these on a cookie sheet!  I've scorched the bottoms of these twice because I forgot to write it down.  Easy recipe and a real family pleaser!

Except for the texture, I would have thought that I was eating a Krystal burger!!  Make sure you top it with a dill pickle chip and a dab of mustard for that unique flavor!  Love these little guys!

Made these for our super bowl party last night.  They were a winner!  We had only 4 left over out of the 24 burgers we made.  A couple things that I did that may have made a difference...I placed the cooked beef on a papertowel after browning it to get as much grease out.  I also let it cool down to luke warm before adding the mayo and cheese, then spread onto the Kings Hawaiian rolls and baked in the oven per the directions.  Definitely need the pickle, and those went on after they came out of the oven.  
My husband's comment: make these anytime!

My husband and I own and operate an adult foster care home, and I made these for our guys one night, and I get begged to make it again at least once a week! They really do taste JUST like the restaurant sliders! It's so simple to make too! Thanks for the great recipe!

Made these for a football party yesterday and they were super easy and very delicious!  I did not seperate the Hawaiian Rolls, just cut them as they were all together.  I let the mean cool a little before I mixed the cheese and mayo as said in another review.  Had a few left over and they tasted just as good the next day heated up in in the oven.  Everyone liked them...Highly recommend!

These are fantastic and yes do taste just like white castles!!  I have made these many times and FYI - you can make these ahead of time.  I made them up in the morning and wrapped them in the foil and refrigerated until I needed them.  I let them sit at room temp for half and hour and then baked as recipe directs.  Came out perfect. Thanks for sharing.  Everyone loves these!!!

Fantastic! I wish i could give this recipe 10 stars. Very easy to make, and they taste better than the restaurant sliders. I also added black pepper to the hamberger mixture and it was mouthwatering.

These are delicious! I tested the recipe last night before using it for a party this weekend and was very impressed-the whole family raved. They're simple to make, and you can easily brown the meat and onion ahead of time. Once the cheese and mayo were added, the consistency allowed me to form small patties. I worried about what the baking would do to them, but the buns got crispy on the edges and the cheese bubbled a little while it cooked. I baked it the whole 30 min. in foil as directed. They'll be easy to assemble ahead of time, keep them in the foil and then pop them in the oven when the guests start to arrive. It's not a typical slider, but they're fun and delicious! Would make a great appetizer!

Made this as per the recipe except used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar since I didn't have it. Even used the butter/Dijon/worcestire/ garlic mixture on top of Hawaiian rolls. The only thing I added were some caramelized onions after baking. My family raved about this and it tastes better than White Castle. Will definitely make again.

I made more than 200 of these for my sons graduation party. They are so easy and do well to make up ahead.  Make sure to use the kings Hawaiian roles and use real mayo (I used Helmans) and sharp cheddar.  I leave the rolls all hooked together as they are in the package and cut them in half laterally.  Make the bottom half of the bread thicker than the top because the meat sinks down into the bread.  Once cooked use a bread knife to cut them apart.  Half of the guests asked for the recipe!

These were great! Easy and excellent for party. I used 3lbs of ground chuck, 1/2 onion diced finely (and cooked those in with browning meat) and 1-1/2 packets of french onion soup mix, next time I think I may just use a full 2 pkgs. and a whole onion. Also I added about 2 tsp of garlic powder. I let meat cool after draining and used the same recommended amount of mayo for the original recipes 2lbs of meat and used abt 2-3 cups of mild cheddar cheese. I used tin foil as my cooking apparatus and sprayed bottom with Pam. Placed bottom half of Hawaiian rolls on tin foil, spread the meat mixture over and put tops on. Then I wrapped up tin foil tight and placed on baking sheets for recommended time + additional 5 min. Keeping them in the tinfoil definitely keeps the bread soft. Using the 3lbs if meat I made 36 burgers (and even had prob 2-3 extras worth of meat but I ran out of buns). Will definitely make again!

I've made these before, using a slightly different recipe. Nonetheless, these turned out great! I had to use a Mexican blend of cheese, as I was out of cheddar, but otherwise I didn't make any modifications. I also only needed to bake them for 15 minutes until the cheese melted.

This was a great recipe, though I changed some of the prep method(I know, I know, I was just leary of "sloppy joe on a bun" as several reviewers mentioned). I mixed better than boullion beef with minced onions and mayo(as close as I could get to the onion soup as we can't use it-my daughter has an MSG sensitivity), then I mixed in the ground beef and put it all in the processor(although I probably didn't need to premix before the processor). I then formed the meat mixture into small, thin patties and cooked them in a cast iron skillet over water, minced onions, and butter(1-2T butter, c of water-just enough to cover the onions completely). I opened a pkg of sunbeam dinner rolls, cut them in sets of 6(they come in 2sets of 12), placed cheese over the entire bottom bun-this ensures better coverage than placing the cheese on each patty. I placed the onion covered patties on top of the cheese, put a tiny amt of butter on the top bun, wrapped in sprayed foil, and popped them in the toaster oven sans cookie sheet for 10min to melt the cheese and warm the buns...they were EXCELLENT!!! The whole family said they were just like White Castle(that we haven't had in years although I am from Chicago), while Im the only one that ate WC slyders regularly &I don't think they are EXACTLY like WC, they are the closest I can come and far superior to the frozen version...they would be perfect party food since you could make the burgers in advance and then just pop them in the oven at party time!

Fast and easy recipe for a quick and delicious supper or lunch. Have done a little experimenting with the recipe and have discovered you can substitute the onion mix for taco seasoning, ranch dip or just about anything your taste buds are favoring. A variety of different cheeses make for a nice little variation. All in all, this recipe has become a household favorite!

Oh So Yummy!!!
Had a party for one of my Teenage girls and for those of you who do not know,  Teens can put food down.  Well they loved these. My Nephew came over next day asked if there was left overs cause he was dreaming of them.  There wasn't any to give.  They were all gone, all 50 of them. I didn't change a thing, and I added the pickles. I'll make this for all our get togethers from birthdays to superbowls. They are soooo good. Did I say they're good?  Thanks Minnesota Girl!!

My my my!  These were delicious and a huge hit at a recent family gathering.  I followed the recipe to a T, including using Hawaiian King rolls and cooking them in foil as Minnesota Girl recommended.   To make the mixture more like a spread, I did run the cooked meat through a chopper.

These are really great burgers especially on the peperidge farm small dinner rolls! Also I use a damp (notwet ) towel over the burgers once I've assembled them in the cake pan.  It steams the burgers just like whcastle does it!!!!  Yummy  and I use velveeta instead

These were really good.  They tasted very much like the stroganoff open sandwich I make.  I made these for my teenagers New Years Eve party and though our family members enjoyed them several of the teens didn't....thus the 4 rating.  I did think they were a little dry, I think next time I will probably add some sour cream to the meat mixture.

Loved these! I did use less mayo (a little less that 1/4 cup) and still found them amazing.  Super easy to make and taste close enough to Krystal burgers (that I cannot get where I live now!) for me.  Thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE: This also works great with ground turkey!

Yummy! These were a hit with the family, including my picky kids. I used a roaster, cause I had run out of tin foil and it was fine. Will make again as this was easy and delish!!

These were a hit!  I would advise backing off a bit on the time - the bottoms of my buns got a little hard.  Maybe reduce to 25 minutes.  Otherwise - Flavor was great!  Will absolutely make again!

A bit too onion-y for us. I forgot to add the soup mix to the hamburger as it was browning, maybe that was my problem? Next time I will use a can of low fat cream of something soup and skip the onion soup mix and the cheese. Great starter idea for me though.

I can't believe how these taste exactly like the White Castle burgers!  They were soooo good!  And healthier too since I used super lean ground beef.  You don't need to change a thing!

I used the Hawaiian rolls as stated by the creator. Tastes perfect. The meat falls apart more like a sloppy joe but the flavor was excellent. When I make again I will add onion rings or crispy onion straws.

Really simple and delicious sliders. I used mini wheat potato hamburger buns and 96% lean ground beef and they worked perfectly. Pickles def complete the flavor.    I could be crazy but I think they were even better heated up the day after.

I love this recipe, I have used it several times, I knew there must be a trick to keeping them soft, next time I will use just foil!  This is a great recipe for a casual crowd, I used it tonight for my sons birthday.   I will definitely be using it over and over!  It's great with ground chicken too.

Made the meat mixture as it but after tasting knew it was a little bland for my family's taste.  I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce which amped up the flavor nicely.  1/2 the family loved these and 1/2 really did not.

These were so awesome! I made them for my 5 year old's Birthday Party and we had a Spongebob Theme so I labeled them as "Krabby Patties".  I made 3 batches and there were none left, everyone was raving about them.  I followed the recipe exactly as directed and followed the advice of other reviewers letting the mixture cool before adding the mayo & cheese. I also wrapped in foil and baked. These were just delicious. Next time when I'm not so pressed for time I want to try the buttery topping a few other reviewers have suggested. Fabulous recipe, especially when feeding a crowd!

These were incredible! I didn't use beef, but ground deer instead; it's so much more lean than beef, and you don't have to drain it, since there's virtually no fat. I made a double batch of these and half the batch has been eaten between me and my fiance. I will DEFINITELY make these again!!

My family LOVES these!  Sooo good and super easy (I love your tip for slicing the tops of the rolls off all at once - CLEVER!).  We have come up with a couple of variations that we like, just to shake things up a bit.  The Oktoberfest Slider: Omit the mayo and onion soup mix.  After draining the ground beef, stir in 1/2 cup sauerkraut (drain and squeeze out liquid) and 1 Tblsp dijon mustard.  Complete the recipe as usual.  The Lunch Lady Slider: Omit the mayo and substitute shredded American for the Cheddar cheese.  Stir 1 can of sloppy joe mix into drained ground beef mixture.  I will say that my youngest daughter is not a fan of mayo, so I reserve a bit of ground beef for her special sliders and add mayo to the rest.  I just designate the end row for her no-mayo sliders.  Works for us!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Super as-is and also wonderfully versitile.

fABULOUS. With essentially the same ingredients, this makes a fantastic hamburger. The onion soup mix is what makes the difference.

This are very tasty! My 7 year old son just gave me a double thumbs up! I followed the recipe to the 'T', but only made a half recipe. Next time I will make a full recipe but only use one package of onion soup. I do like the salty taste of the meat mixture and the sweet flavor from the buns.

These were a HUGE hit a t a potluck party I attended.  I had run out of mayo so did not include it in the hamburger mixture.  Also, prior to putting in the oven I drizzled mustard on the hamburger/cheese mix and layered the dill pickle chips .  The party was for teenagers and they devoured them!

I prepared this recipe exactly as written, using lean grass fed beef and light Duke's mayo.  It was so simple to assemble the burgers prior to guests arriving (wrap in foil), clean up, and then pop them in the oven later.  I used the Kings Hawaiian butter rolls (not sweet) and these little burgers were amazing!  This recipe is a keeper.

These were pretty good.  Scaled down the recipe for 12 and used Hawaiian rolls for the buns.  It was hard to keep the crumbled beef on the little buns and it mostly fell off and cooked on the tray and got hard.  Needs some kind of sauce for the top.  We used ketchup but it wasn't quite right.

I make these for Superbowl every year. They are soooo good! Be sure to seal the pan with foil very well so the rolls don't dry out. I make my own dinner rolls for these, but in the beginning I used 'grandma rolls' and they were still a huge hit. No one in my house likes pickles, so I leave them out.

My husband LOVED these!! I used 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground turkey.  Was just a little over 2 lbs so I used 1 1/2 onion soup mix packets. We used wheat rolls.

Very good and easy to make!  I prepared these sliders as directed and they turned out great.  I prepared an additional half of what the recipe calls for.  I added an additional pound of ground beef (3 pounds total) and just added an additional half of all the ingredients except the soup mix -- I used only one envelope.  

I used the Martin's Potato Party Rolls that come in packs of 24 rolls.  With the additional pound of ground beef, I made a total of 42 mini sliders. They were very easy to prepare. I separated the rolls in groups of 6, cut off the tops of the rolls , placed the bottoms on the foil, spread the meat mixture on the bottoms, placed the pickles on top of the meat as another reviewer suggested and then placed the tops of the rolls on each group.  After baking, I then cut the rolls apart into individual sliders.

These didn't last at the party.  Everyone stated how good these were and some asked for the recipe.  I will definitely be making these again!

I am from Texas and have only had frozen White Castle burgers, but these taste just like I imagine the fresh ones would! Seriously delicious and so easy.  I did what another reviewer said and just removed all of the Hawaiian Sweet Rolls from the cardboard, sliced them horizontally and spread the meat over all of them at once.

Okay, I followed this recipe exactly as written. So why did the bottom of the buns burn? If it wasn't for that, these would be really good.

I thought these would be fun to try!  For just the two of us, I made 1/4 of the recipe.  I sautéed some onion along with the ground beef and did not use the dry onion soup mix.  I did add salt and pepper.  I made 4 little sliders using pretzel slider rolls I had in the freezer.  I assembled these ahead, wrapped them in foil and refrigerated them until it was time to bake them.  I baked mine for about 25 minutes.  These were fun to try, but neither Hubs nor I was terribly wowed by them.

These are awesome!! You can make them in advance wrapped in foil but in that case you may want to leave them in the oven for a few extra minutes to counteract them being refrigerated.  Recipe is great as written.  My husband went ga ga over these!!!  I think one of the keys is the Hawaiian Rolls, they gave them just the right sweet kick.  Thanks for submitting.

My picky hubby and I really liked these.  I've never had White Castle but they sure taste good.  I cut the recipe down to 8 servings for 8 rolls (from Sam's Club) and then just placed them on a sprayed heavy tin foil.  Baked for 20 minutes and they were perfect.  The addition of the dill pickle was perfect!  So surprising that my very, very picky hubby liked them and said I could make them again anytime!!  Thanks Minnesota Girl for a great little recipe.  ** Here it is 7 years later, and just made these again.  So good and great for an easy meal.  It's a must to have dill pickle slices to go on top.  Thanks again Minnesota Girl :)

These were pretty good, they kinda grew on me as I ate. There was a bit of an odd underlying flavour but I think maybe it was just grease (though I did drain). They were a bit too oniony for me, I think I'd use less of the soup mix, or even just skip it and use finely minced onion to taste plus salt and pepper and such. Not sure I'll make this again, but maybe for a party or something. Update: these continued to grow on me as I ate the leftovers, so perhaps I will make them again, but a day or two in advance!

These are great - I followed the recipe and they tasted good but it seemed like something was missing.  My son said we need a squirt of mustard with the pickle like White Castle and then they were perfect for us!

These are AMAZING! They get gobbled up every time I make them within minutes. Here's a way to save some time, work, dishes, etc. After you drain your grease from the beef mixture, return it to your stove top at moderate heat. Mix in the mayo & the cheese and wait until it has all come together & melted nicely until it's an ooey-gooey wonderfully cheesy consistency. Don't use the oven at all! Just use your griddle to lightly toast both sides of the rolls before you assemble. Try to toast as you're doing the other steps so everything will be warm & ready at the same time. (I suppose you could toast first and then keep warm in the oven but it sort of defeats the purpose of the short cut a little.) Then, quickly assemble your sliders and serve immediately! I imagine it will be less greasy/soggy since you don't add the oil to the bread from the foil baking method - not sure since I've never tried it that way. No matter how you make these, they will be devoured in seconds! :) Thanks so much for a recipe box staple!

These are good and much easier than making a bunch of burger patties.  I always use onion soup mix in my burgers anyway....this helped cut down on the time spent in the kitchen.

Made these, along with other finger foods, for New Year's Eve. They tasted delicious! Hubby said they were better than White Castle. My only problem is with the cookie sheet. The author wrote the recipe, stating to place them on a cookie sheet, but her review says she doesn't. Well, I did, and the bottoms got too brown - almost burnt - so I won't do that next time. I scaled the recipe down to make twelve servings and, based on the advice of other reviewers, used less than 1/4c. mayo.  Also left out the pickles. Yuck! Next time I'll add some fresh chopped onion.

This recipe is soooo awesome and simple to make! I use 1 packet of onion soup mix per 1 lb of meat. Sooo delicious. Also I pair it with Kings hawaiian bread as many users suggested. I also think 30 minutes is too long, the bread gets a little too toasted. For 12 sliders, I bake for about 20 minutes.  I made them for a "comfort food" pot luck, there wasnt a single slider left!

I loved these - I used Morningstar Farms "meat" crumbles, and it worked perfectly.  I used some garlic and dried onions instead of the onion soup mix, and just a touch of garlic/jalapeno mustard, and sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top of the "meat" mixture, (only about 1/2 a cup) instead of mixing it in, and it was just right.  Another users "butter sauce" for the topping was the perfect touch - I took off the top sheet of foil with 5 minutes left, brushed it on, and left the foil off, for the final 5 minutes.  So good - thanks!

These were actually quite tasty with just a few ingredients.  Our buns were more toasted than steamed (unlike the White Castle burgers).  These had the WC flavor so next time, I'm going to sprinkle with a little of water and really cover them with foil and see if that helps.  Thanks for the post!

Very good...I only made six because I was using up 1/2 a package of Hawaiian sweet rolls. I made exactly as written...the soup mix made them a little salty for me. I will probably just sub in minced onion and perhaps a touch of worchestershire sauce next time. I've never had a White Castle burger, so I don't know if these taste like them, but they were overall a very quick, simple meal for us, served with cole slaw and fruit.

I have been making these for years and ever since my daughter made them for a pot luck at her work once at least once a month her co-workers ask her to make them just because.  I have never used the King's rolls though, I would think they would be too sweet.....I use hot dog buns and cut them in thirds lenghtwise.  My recipe is somewhat different...I use 1 tsp of mayo, 1 pkg of onion soup mix and 1 8 oz jar of cheese wiz to 1 lb of ground beef.  I think you'll find this works out better and of course don't forget the pickles!!

Couldn't find the sweet rolls in my neck of the woods and substituted worchestire sauce for mayo, but it was still a party hit. Great idea and very easy to make in a short amount of time!

These were pretty good....I didn't use as much cheddar as it called for......we'd rather have american slices on top of meat than inside the meat mixture.....so that's what I did....put 1/4 cup cheddar for the binding..and topped with american slices on top...........topped it off with a dill pickle....Pretty tasty!

Holy COW!  These were a HUGE HIT!  I didn't have onion soup mix, so I used some of the Tupperware  Simply garlic seasoning, which was AWESOME!.  I used reduced fat mayo and reduced fat cheese, I also sauteed a small onion in with the burger.  Will be making these again for sure!

I made this for my 2 year old's birthday party, kids and adults loved them, they were quite a hit and I got asked about the recipe, I followed one reviewer's advice and made the 'special butter': 2 tbsp minced onion flakes, 1 tbsp worchestershire sauce, 1 tbsp Dijon or Spicey Mustard (not the regular yellow), 1/2 cup melted butter. You melt these together and brush ontop of the buns just before you put in the oven to bake.  I highly recommend this step.  I couldn't find the King Hawaiin buns, we don't have those in Canada, but I got dinner rolls at Walmart and they were good.  Althoguh next time i'm in buffalo I will hunt for these buns and try them.  Will make again!

We don't have "King-Hawaiian" around here, so I used the mini potato rolls.  Instead of ground beef, I used ground sirloin - no problem with the grease as mentioned.  Also used low fat mayo. Wrapped them in tin foil and put them on the top rack of the grill!  These were fantastic!  Everyone loved them.  Thanks SO much for this recipe!!

These are great!  They have become our traditional Friday night dinner.  My husband actually becomes cranky if I change "Friday night Slider night" to something else.  Didn't change a thing from the original recipe, except I use low fat mayo and low fat cheese.

These turned out exactly as pictured:  little homemade hamburgers with the mayo and cheese cooked right in. The rolls were a little crusty so I recommend reducing the bake time a little.  I made these for my family and even my slightly picky six year old liked them. Didn't change a thing in the recipe, however, I did add a slice of cheese to mine before eating. I love cheese. ;)

I made these last night and they were really good. I followed the recipe to a "T". There weren't any leftovers. I suggest using the hawaiian snacker rolls they're not mini but hold more beef!From one Minnesota girl to the next THANKS!!

My family loved these!  I followed the recipe as stated and only added some finely chopped onion.  They did taste a lot like White Castle hamburgers.  I will make these again - will especially be good for when we host get-togethers.

great recipe...they got gobbled up at this house...including my picky 6yr old son!!...I made a half recipe for the 3 of us....I found some potato rolls in the Walmart bakery that were perfect...I browned a lb of 93% lean beef with 1/2 a packet of "beefy onion" soup mix(that's what I had)....drained the little fat that was there and allowed the mixture to cool for 15 minutes or so...added a little bit less mayo than called for and a little more cheese than was called for and found the mixture to be quite stiff...NOT sloppy joe like at all...you could form patties if you wanted to...spread it on the rolls wrapped in prepared foil and onto a sheet pan...the bottoms did come out a bit crispy, so I'll skip the pan next time...I think the addition of some carmelized chopped onion would make these even better....thanks so much for a great recipe...we will make these again and again!!!

These were wonderful!  However, the cooking time was definitely too long, and they were slightly petrified.  It was much better when we toasted the buns before adding the meat mixture.  Delicious recipe!

These are delicious.  I have taken them to 2 parties and everyone wants the recipe.  I did decrease the mayo by half because I cannot justify using as much as it calls for.  I also added pickles on one of the batches (it was actually a wasted since the meat overpowered the pickles).

I've never had just mayo on a burger before, and with any luck I never will again. If this is what white castles are like no wonder we don't have them around here.

Made this for the SuperBowl and it was the first appetizer to be completely devoured.  Used sweet rolls and tin foil, as suggested by others and added one zesty pepper ring before adding the meat to give it a little something. Makes a lot of meat, so make sure you load 'em up!

enjoyed the sliders very much,  Used rehydrated onions in place of onion soup mix.  Chilled in refrigerator for 3 hours and spread on regular size buns.  enough for 8 buns.  cooked four buns for 30 to 40 min.  Froze the uncooked buns for another time. Used French's spicey brown mustard.Will try frozen sliders inabout a week.  Mama Kat

Had these for Friday night with Bacon Cheese Fries - Wow very good.  The bakery at the grocery had their own slider buns which we used.  They were good, but I think next time I'll try the Hawaiian rolls.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these for a 'trial run' before a football game. Excellent! Followed the suggestions and just wrapped in sprayed foil and placed right on rack. Pickles were a must. Thanks for a keeper!

This turned out very well.  Only thing I did differently was cook in the oven for 15 minutes instead of 30 - seems like they would have burned if I left them in any longer.

Easy, delicious, family friendly, and perfect just the way it is written. I had absolutely no trouble with these and followed the recipe to a "tee". Kids helped me and we all enjoyed the fruits of our labor!! A keeper for sure. Thanks for sharing.

This was fantastic. No Changes at all. Made it for a bunch of 14 year old girls and my husband and son and daughter. No left overs. This was a fantastic New Year's Eve Dinner :) Thanks so much for sharing

I did less mayo (1/3 cup) and less cheese (1 cup) and it worked fine. However my cheese was a little bigger than regular shredded cheese so it might be around 1 and 1/2 cup!

I always make a recipe the way it’s listed. Any changes are done later. To tell you the truth this was GREAT! I halved the recipe cause I had only 12 pack of Hawaiian rolls which I do not like. I made a mistake and put a whole envelope of onion soup mix. I thought it was going to be salty, nope it was ok. My husband loved them with pickles , corn on the cob and baked beans. I now will eat Hawaiian bread only with this recipe! Thanks Minnesota Girl for for the  idea! And I don’t know what a White Castle taste like they don’t have them in California. Wish they did!

Only changed dry onion to a average sized yellow sweet onion, chopped, not minced.  Served them on my homemade butter bun recipe I use for sandwich buns, but sized down the size.  Big hit at the birthday party for adults and kids.  Better than White Castle.  I have enjoyed a few White Castles.  Thank you for sharing.  An Ex-Minnesotan, you betcha!

HELPFUL TIP FOR ONION HATERS and those who don't want HARD buns: Really was kind of concerned my four kids would hate this because of the onion flavor.  All of them despise onions, and you know what...  I guess in this packet, it's not a standout because all of mine didn't say a thing.  I noticed...but loved it!  The only complaint they had was it needed more flavor in terms of ketchup and more pickles ...and the grownups wanted shredded lettuce and a tomato option. ……….BUT for a quick teenager snack that you can even make ahead and leave in a dish ready to just heat for 30 min, this definitely fits the bill.  Also, was afraid of the 2lbs of ground beef.... I mean, that's a lot!  ...but it really did well with 2 packs of king rolls.  Sure there were leftovers, but it is worth eating again.  I used enough buns that I thought the kids would eat.  Foiled a 13X9 dish, and also covered with foil.  W/O it, the buns would have been rocks.  Also must cool ground beef as mentioned before adding the shredded cheese and mayo.  Drain the beef too.  All these made just the perfect burgers.

These are really good, but they were not exactly what I was looking for. I made some changes: I used the Hawaiian Sweet rolls, rather than plain dinner rolls.  I didn't have onion soup mix, (frankly I don't care for it, and its very high in sodium, just fyi) So instead I added one fine chopped white onion, 1Tbsp. season salt, 2 tsp. black pepper, 2 tsp. garlic powder all added to meat mixture. I liked the alternate of cooking all in the frying pan to. But, if your looking for super thin burgers like the fast food (castle)  you can also spread the meat mix thinly over a large cookie sheet, bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes, then using a couple pancake flippers, place onto your already prepared rolls.  I wouldn't include pickles either. Put them
on the side. Anyone that dislikes pickles will hate the juice being all over your bread!

I took the advice from the coworker who brought these in for a potluck. Brown the beef with BEEFY onion soup mix then drain and put in crockpot with cheese and mayo til melted. Serve with pickles and hawaiian buns. Soooo good and soooo easy!

I did it with 3 lbs of ground beef and one packet of onion soup. Drained meat well. Then placed it into a crockpot to keep warm with 3 cups of shredded cheese and one cup of mayo. Everyone loved it with no leftovers!!
I left it out with King Hawaiian Butter Rolls, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and pepper jack cheese.

I doubled the recipe the only thing I did was drain the meat and cut back on the mayo by 1/3 based on the other reviews. These are very good sliders. Everyone ate them up! Definitely will be putting them into our rotation. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Husband loves these. I love how easy they are to make. Since it is just the two of us, I cut the recipe in half. I cook the 2 pounds ground beef with the soup mix, and freeze half. I make up the sliders with the other portion using 1/2 of the ingredients listed. When we need a quick supper, all I have to do is defrost the ground meat, and finish the prep. Don't scrimp on the pickles!

Made these for a party and everyone raved!  Hubby  said they  tasted just like White Castle burgers!  I got way more than  enough for 24 sliders and I was being generous with the amount of  meat mixture I put on each one.  I think I could have gotten 3 dozen out of this recipe.  But yummy all around!

I love this recipe and always get rave reviews when I make it.  I will admit I do one thing different:  before adding the mayonnaise and cheddar cheese, I add 2-3 TBSP of Worcestershire to the ground meat and stir to incorporate.  Then I add the mayo and cheddar, etc.  Yummy!!

I used small bakery dinner rolls and followed another reviewer's suggestion by not browning meat first.  I just spread raw meat mixture in rolls and baked until cooked through (about 45 minutes).  I also brushed the tops generously with melted butter.  These were good the first night, but the leftovers were AMAZING- just like a Krystal burger!!

I thought this was a pretty good casual dinner. Used 1 lb of ground beef. I went a little light on the mayo and onion soup mix but in hindsight I should've added more.  The pickle on top all warmed up was awesome.

Made these twice now, 2nd time I subbed sour cream for the Mayo and it created a much nicer flavor.  They re-heat well also so they make a great snack or work lunch.

Delicious! Had to use velveeta in place of cheddar and mayo. But I did spread mayo over the tops before baking. Followed another reviewers suggestion and left rolls connected and sliced off tops in one big slice. Spread beef over connected bottoms-note to self- once beef is on, it's hard to tell how the top goes back on. I'll do better with that next time. Then just cut each individual slider apart, take off top and add pickle or wickle and serve. Hubby RAVED over these! Making for company the next time we have guests. And making extras to freeze. Scrumptious and finger lickin good!

Delish! Made these guys last night and enjoyed them with some friends. Super easy and quick to put together. I did follow another reviewer's advice and added a honey mustard glaze to the top of the buns. I have to say, that glaze added another level to these awesome sandwiches.

I substituted Johnsonville sausage for the beef.  The burgers got mixed reviews from my family.  "Excellent, good, too greasy and funny tasting sauce".  Will go back to lean beef.

I made these mini burgers and brought them to a party. Followed the recipe exactly (I added a teaspoon of horseradish) and they were gone before all the guests arrived. I was asked to bring them to the next party.

We loved these!  I used Hawaiian sweet rolls for the dinner rolls.  My 13-yr-old daughter has requested this for her bday party as the food of choice! :)

I made these per the recipe except put in the pickle before baking, as some others have said.  They turned out great and were a hit at the potluck I took them to.  I will be making these a lot!

I fed this to a group of kids and they all loved it.  No pickles and I used King's Hawaiian buns.  I didn't have onion soup so I had to improvise but the spices were the same.  It turned out great.  And I used half the seasoning salt as some of the other reviewers said to do.  This is a keeper in our party repertoire.

I made these as a last minute, I think I have everything meal. I ended up using regular hamburger buns because that's all I had. These turned out great! My family loved them. I was surprised the flavor from the mix was enough. I used light mayo and personally added pickle. My boyfriend ate 3 in one sitting. They are very easy. I would recommend!

Used Kings Hawaiian rolls. I used half ground sirloin for flavor and half ground chuck for juiciness. Thought all the mayo was necessary. Could barely taste it in mixture but added to the meat's creaminess. Super yummy. Never had White Castle but some people said that is what they tasted like.

Good.  Very heavy.  I halfed the recipe.  It tasted similarly to White Castle Sliders, but not overwhelmingly so.  Would be good for a group of kids bc. you can make quite a bit very easily.  Minimal cleanup was a huge plus.

I've made these a few times and they are a nice change from regular hamburgers. Don't skip the pickles! They aren't exactly like white-castle, but similar.
UPDATE: I made these using slider rolls and they do NOT taste as good as when I used King's Hawaiian.
UPDATE : Avoid making my mistake...do not cook these on a dark colored pan, it burns the bottoms.

Just made these and they taste great. I also made half of the recipe and put the mixture on hot dog buns (that's what I had) and after they were done cut them each in half, no problem. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe Minnesota_Girl

My kids loved it!!! I used turkey instead of beef and seasoned it very well! That was the only change I made and it was fabulous!!! To season the ground turkey, I used a little oregano, a pinch of cilantro, a dash of cumin, garlic powder, salt, pepper and some barbecue sauce. I still used the onion soup mix and it was flavored perfectly! My son says that I need to make this everyday! Thanks for the recipe.

These are always a hit!! I started making for my family and once I made them for a get together it is a must that I bring to ALL functions. If you make them you have to use Kings Hawaiian Sweet Rolls. The are good with other brands but delicious with Kings brand.  Also, if you have kids and are looking to save time from cutting the bread; you can use Kings Hawaiian Sub rolls.  The sub rolls are already sliced and they are bigger than the standard roll. Also this recipe is like any other taste it as you go. Once you find what works for you the recipe will be awesome!!

This was great! My picky eaters even loved it. I didn't have any onion soup mix unfortunately, so I used some onion powder and added a little Worcestshire sauce. I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef because it is healthier. Then I followed the recipe exactly. Used homemade dinner rolls my husband makes. That made it a winner I think, using fresh homemade rolls. I was hesitant to bake them for so long, I was afraid they might burn, but they were perfect, nice and toasted and the cheese was perfectly melted. This meal is going into our regular dinner rotation!

When first reading this recipe I was leary. But after trying I love it!  My whole family loved as well.  I did make a few minor tweaks.  I sauted finely chopped onion in a little butter first then added ground beef to brown.  I liked the extra onion.  Also I didn't want all my burgers with cheese so I just used cheese slices and added the slices to however many burgers I wanted cheese on then baked.  One time I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground chicken and it was still great!!  And please don't forget the pickle!

These are excellent!  My family loves them.  They are a cross between a white castle burger and a cheesesteak.  I have taken then to a few parties and they are the first thing gone.  They are now frequently requested!

These are excellent! I cut the recipe in half to make 12 sliders. Used buns specific for sliders- found them at Target, made by Pepperidge Farm. Used high quality Irish Cheddar from Whole Foods Market, grated. Light mayo. 96% lean ground beef from Trader Joe's. Very quick and easy to make. Very little prep time. 50 minutes sound like a lot but it's really not! Would definitely make these again.

So good and extremely easy to make (followed the recipe exactly).  We dipped them in ketchup as we ate them.  They keep pretty well too: next morning, we heated them up in the microwave and they were still really good.  Definitely make these again.

While I enjoyed the taste, the baking in the oven made the buns hard, and I think it would've been much more enjoyable on soft buns.  These would probably also be better prepared as small patties with a slice of cheese rather than a crumbly mixture

Great recipe! SO easy to make and super delicious.  I diced onion instead of onion soup mix .  I got half the meat and added slices of jalapenos to give a little kcik to some of them.  I also added a little mustard for taste to the mixture.  I've made this several times now and everyone loves them!

All I can say is WOW-these are great!!! I made them just as the recipe states, I might have added a little less mayo. I used hawaiian rolls which were perfect! I added a zesty pickle slice prior to baking and as other suggested I baked them for 10 min wrapped in greased foil. I did brush them with the butter, dijon, minced onion and worcestershire sauce mix that was previously suggested. My husband had raving reviews! Can't wait to make them for a crowd.

Followed recipe exactly but cut recipe in half for two ppl.  Used Hawaiin dinner rolls but sliced them in half all together in their rectangle.  Let the mixture cool some before placing on the bottom half of the rolls.  Used my hands to form large rectangle on top of the rolls.  Placed the top half of the rolls on top THEN scored with a knife all the way thru to separate all the burgers.  Rated 4 stars only because they got too hard on the bottom as written, almost burnt.  Will def make again, but will cut back time to 20 min.  May try no cookie sheet as others suggested also.  They were delicious! I even ate one cold the next day and it was very good!  With the decrease in time (or maybe lower temp?) they will be a 5+!  Will be making these often!

UPDATE: Made again and placed the foil-wrapped package on a cooling rack which I had placed over a cookie sheet and only baked for 20 min.  No burnt bottoms!   PERFECT!

Absolutely delish!  I used the small hawaiian buns and put a very small amount of mustard on the bun.  Definitely close to the tast of a White Castle.

Pretty good though I found the meat mixture didn't really stick together very well.  Made the burger making process a bit messy but overall the end result was good.

Note - I used non-fat Greek yogurt as a substitute for mayo to cut down on the fat

First, I halved the recipe.  Skipped the onion soup mix (we do not care for it), added some finely chopped onion and green peppers to the meat. Some other reviewers remarked that there was too much mayo, so I just added a bit at time until the mixture looked okay.  Used the Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, I think these really made this dish.  Everyone loved them, thanks for sharing.

Huge hit w/my entire family! I made 1 small change, instead of mayo I used sour crm. I REFUSE to eat mayo and I do not have any in my house. My sliders seemed to taste exactly like Krystal burgers, Im not mad about that!

If sliders are your thing, then you must try this recipe. I made it as printed, and my husband, who grew up in Chicago eating White Castle, adored them. He said they're a 10, and he actually likes them better than WC sliders. If you can't find King Hawaiian party rolls, Cobblestone Mill makes them too. If you like your beef a little less gritty, you can put the ground meat into a food processor and pulse it for a second or two. The recipe can easily be halved.

I made these once before and the family didn't like them. After deciding to make them a second time, I made a few adjustments.

First off, I think the main problem initially was the fact that we didn't use a plain mayo. Make sure the mayonnaise you're using is mild and doesn't have any special flavoring. Otherwise, it's going to taste off and any flavoring in it will clash with the soup mix. 

I did not salt my meat because I was using a rather salty cheese in addition to the soup mix (which tends to be salty by itself), but I did add pepper. After mixing everything together and putting it in the oven, the bottoms of the buns came out hard as a rock: we think it's because we put cooking spray on the foil so nothing would stick.

After making these the second time with adjustments, everybody loved them. There would have been no leftovers if they weren't so filling!

Delicious! My whole family loved this, even the pickey eaters. ;0) I melted a little butter and brushed the top of the buns with it. This is definitely going to become a staple in our house. Thank you for sharing.
I have also made these with ground venison and they are delicious!!

You can adjust the additions to the ground beef as you desire. One person staed it did not mention to drain, you does, it says discard excess!  Fun once in a while thing to make. You can make it healthy by using lean meat and low fat mayo and cheese.

These burgers were great....remindered me of the White Castle Burger that I got in the 60's...I halved the recipe because it was just for 2 of us.  I used Potato dinner rolls and they were just perfect size and there was 12 rolls.  I am going to use the leftovers tomorrow for my grandchildren.  Thanks for such a good recipe!

I gave these a two because of the way to prepare a lot of burgers quickly. The  meat tasted like hot mayo, and not at all like onions. I think that if tou were to saute an onion with it it may work, just leave out the mayo.

Followed the recipe to a T - awesome every time.  So easy to make and you can sub the cheese for any other kind of cheese you like - I've used pepperjack and shredded Kraft Mexican cheese also, with great results.

The recipe doubled perfectly.  After draining the beef I put it in a food processor to make it more consistent.  I returned it to the pan to add the cheese and the mayo.  The mixture was super quick and easy to spread on each batch of bun bottoms.  I wrapped each batch of twelve in foil that was sprayed with cooking spray and baked for 20 minutes.  

This was a HUGE hit with kids and adults.  All 48 sliders disappeared.  I will definitely make these again!!!

Very easy to make but so much better than a regular hamburger pattie. My family loved them. I didn't change anything from the original recipe and it turned out perfect!

Not a hit with the younger kids, and I have to admit, it looked kinda gross as I was making it, but they really are great for tailgating or watching the game at home.  Pickles were a nice compliment.  Everyone thought they tasted like the restaurant sliders.  I used Miracle Whip and Hawaiin slider rolls.

The flavor on these were great! Next time the only thing I would change is to not bake them so long at the end. It made the buns too crispy!!

These little gems are so good! I had five kids gobble them up so fast, (and I doubled the recipe!) I made these exactly like the recipe and served them with dill pickle slices. I used whole wheat dinner rolls, which tasted so great after being toasted in the oven. I'm putting this in my weekly menu rotations. New family favorite!

Love this concept.  Have made these twice.  Added chopped onion when browning the meat.  One of the local grocery stores sells slider buns, so when I am shopping there, I buy those.  Otherwise I use regular dinner rolls.  Just be very careful w/ the time and do not use the cookie sheet, b/c they burn easily.  I always make these ahead and bake when we are ready to eat.  I am going to try making w/ different variations - buffalo chicken w/ ground chicken, or beef w/ ranch dressing mix instead of onion soup (kids complained about the onion - but still ate it).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Krystal Burgers. Made these and cut the recipe in half. Used 1 lb ground beef, 2 Tbs of onion soup mix, and added about a Tbs of minced dried onion. These are Krystal burgers made at home.

These are YUM!  I do not use the onion soup mix because it has MSG...  Instead, I just dice an onion and brown it with the meat.  Be sure to add garlic powder, onion powder, and S&P to replace the mix.  Also, you can use other cheeses.  First time I made them I was out of cheddar, and used muenster instead.  SOOO good!

Delicious...made just as. Next time, I will sub either carmelized onions or my toasted onion powder for the onion soup mix--some of the dehydrated onion bits stayed crunchy.

Gut-buster but very yummy!!!

I was pleasantly surprised by how good these sliders were.  I was a bit skeptical about cooking mayonnaise for the recommended time but it really was necessary for the creamy texture.  I sauted' some onions and topped them with mustard.  If I close my eyes they taste just like White Castle hamburgers.  Great recipe for kids! They loved them.

My new, make-ahead favorite for parties and potlucks! It is so easy to scale up for bigger events. Instead of adding the seasoning packet, I puree an onion (so the kids don't see it) and add salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper - then sautee with the ground beef. The recipe also works great with soy crumbles. The filling freezes well in a baggie - just thaw in the fridge (DON'T microwave or it will separate.

These were very declicious. I made them as an appetizer for a large party I was having, so I made the meat in advance and stored in plastic bags. Next day at the party, I spread the meat on the buns and baked in the oven. They were a huge hit!

These little burgers were a cinch to make although I thought they were just okay. They seemed to lack zing and all that mayo didn't make them seem creamy to me. Instead I might have added a cream soup or even sour cream along with seasoned salt, garlic powder, minced onion, and black pepper minus the soup mix. I will definitely try this recipe again with the above modifications. My husband and three young boys really loved them.

These were really tasty! Everyone seemed to enjoy them much better with the addition of the pickles, I made some without also. Most added a bit of ketchup and mustard when they were finished baking, it helped break up the richness of the mayo and cheese. Thanks for sharing, this recipe is excellent for parties :)

These were pretty tasty.  I cut the recipe in half and used the submitter's suggestion of using King Hawaiian Rolls.  I did cool the cooked meat before adding the mayo and cheese.  Thanks for this tasty recipe!

Loved this recipe!  I made this for one of my football parties and everyone absolutely loved them.  I did make a few additions to mine.  I added some cheez whiz (half-jar) to the burger mix along with some carmelized chopped onions which I sauteed in worchestershire sauce.  Also, instead of dinner rolls I found some mini kaiser rolls which worked perfectly.  I was told by everyone to make these again!

Perfect when you invite a crowd. We don't have that type of bun where I live so I used the Sweet Dinner Rolls recipe from this site. Definitely a crowd pleaser.

These really do taste like white castles, but more filling and meatier.  My picky, white-castle-loving, husband liked these a lot too.  I cut the recipe in half since it's just the two of us and we have plenty leftover, just like when we go to white castle.

These were very good.  Followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 pkg of Hawaiian rolls and 1 pkg of regular dinner rolls just to compare.  We liked both equally. I will definitely make these again and as stated they would be great for a party.  The only change I will make is to make more filling next time.  They were just a little too thin for us with the amount of filling called for.  Thanks Minnesota Girl!

These were good...my 4 year old loved them!  Didn't have any onion soup mix so I made my own....dried onions, onion powder and salt.  Mixed it with the mayo instead of adding it to the meat while browning.

These are really good! They do taste a lot like White Castle. The only change I made was to use 12 rolls instead of 24, I think using 24 rolls there wouldn't have been enough meat mixture on each burger. Will definately make these again.

OMG!  These are absolutely fabulous.  I made these for a birthday party yesterday and they were a BIG hit with everyone.  I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception of cooking in the oven for only 15 mins. just to warm them.  Will be definitely making these again and again.

These are delicious!  I love the slider burgers at white castle and these are just like them!  I followed the submitters review and sprayed the tinfoil with cooking spray and sat all the burgers in there and folded it shut.  They came out perfect.  I then opened them and topped them with pickles.  Thanks so much for this recipe, I cant wait to bring these to the next get together!

Soooooooo good with pickles and mustard. Made them for super bowl and then again on a beach trip. The second time I didn't measure and put to much mayo in, it really doesn't need very much. Really yummy.

These were really good! I cooked as directed except served them on Kings Hawaiian rolls. Delicious, except they were a bit rich for my taste. I'll probably lessen the mayo a little next time, other than that we LOVED it.

I've made these twice now - most of my family hates mayo so the first time I used very little mayo, and found that it made the meat/cheese mixture just crumbly and dry. Made it a 2nd time following recipe and LOVED them. Family didn't even realize it was mayo! I personally love mayo and loved the creaminess of it. I also cooked on a baking sheet the first time and it made the rolls too hard - this time I was out of foil so instead I just threw them in the oven for 5 minutes since everything is cooked - it warmed the rolls but they were still soft. DELICIOUS! New family favorite!

I absolutely love these!  The first time I made them I only made 1/2 the recipe (using ground turkey) and 1/2 pkg. of onion soup mix.  Didn't use mayo (personal preference) and used a colby/monterey jack cheese blend.  They were excellent, especially the next day, but I felt it was missing something in the cheese taste.  So the next time I made them, I made the whole amount and used ground turkey, 1.5 pkg of onion soup mix, again no mayo, and about 1 1/4 cup of cheddar/mozzarella cheese blend to get it to stick together.  Then after spreading it onto the rolls, I lined 6 slices of american cheese on top before placing the roll tops back on (6 slices fit almost perfectly on the buns).  They were even better with american cheese and I don't normally like american cheese.  Love these!

Positively good! I used 2lbs 93% lean ground beef (no draining necessary), Sunbeam dinner rolls, sharp cheddar cheese and the rest of the recipe as is. When finished we topped with hamburger dill chips, ketchup, and yellow mustard. Reminded me alot of White Castle.  But, my neice and nephew said no way, these are way better.

I used ground turkey so I didn't have to drain the meat. I also waited to add the mayo and cheese as suggested. I used 1/4 c light mayo. The mixture was cool enough for me to form patties. I also placed the pickles on the mixture and wrapped them in sprayed foil. I don't agree with other reviewers that these tasted like sloppy joes. They really tasted a lot like white castles. A great recipe to use up leftover dinner rolls after parties. I served these with broccoli and cottage cheese stuffed potatoes for a filling comfort meal made a little healthier.

Mmm. I'm eating two sliders right now, and they taste almost exactly like cheese Krystals (the South's version of White Castle).  I reduced the recipe by half and didn't add the whole 1/4th cup of mayo, and I used fresh onion simmered with the beef instead of onion soup mix.  I also added a tablespoon of hamburger seasoning while cooking.  I did mix a few slices of American cheese into the beef, but I didn't really taste it, so I added cheese slices to the top of my burgers.  Still has plenty of flavor even without the added cheese on top.  Really good, simple recipe-- will definitely use again.  Thanks!

My family raved about these burgers. I did not find them to be sloppy joe-like or messy at all. A guest we had for supper the night I made these said they needed sauted onions on them for a more authentic slider taste and I agree with him.  However they were very tasty. I did not give 5 stars because I found working with dinner rolls too fussy. I found mini slider buns at the grocery store which I will use next time.  I also only baked these for about 15 minutes or so.  The meat is already cooked so all that is needed is to "melt" the ingredients together. Also, the shorter bake time allowed the rolls to be warm and soft instead of overbaked as some reviewers  commented on.  Thanks again for another great recipe that my family enjoys.

These were tasty little sammys.  My husband liked them and he's picky about his burgers.  I didn't add pickle, but still was tasty.  A little on the sweet side with using the sweet hawaiian rolls.  I might try the savory butter rolls next time.

I made these for my family today.  I followed the recipe exactly other than using miracle whip instead of mayo.  I also added some black pepper to the meat while it cooked.  Flavor was excellent (5 stars for flavor) and reminded me of Krystals/White Castle burgers.  Dinner rolls used were King Hawaiian sweet rolls.  I found the rolls got hard on the bottom and slightly hard on top even though I pulled them from the oven early. (4 stars)  I wonder if through some experimentation if the buns could be steamed to more closely resemble the Krystal/White Castle buns. Clausen refrigerated pickles were sliced and added to the sliders.  They lent a nice taste to the sliders.   Thanks for sharing this recipe, it made for a meal that could be prepared quickly (prep time).  Overall I would rate this 4.5 stars.

These were a big hit at my house. I used the Southern Butter Rolls recipe from this site to put the burger meat on, I also used Monterey Jack and Colby mix cheese because I was out of cheddar. Thank u

EXCELLENT!! I was amazed at how much they did  taste like the White Castle burgers. My buns were a little too hard on the bottom, may be because I put them on a cookie sheet instead of just on the rack, as others suggested.  The pickles and mayo are a must if you want the full White Castle flavor. I made half the recipe, using a full packet of the onion soup mix.  I used hamburger buns, because that is what I had on hand, next time I will be using the dinner rolls. From one Minnesota girl to another, thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This recipe is great!  I am a high school foods teacher and I surprised my students with this recipe because I knew they would like it.  I was right, they loved it!  It was very easy for them to make and I thought they were delicious as well.  We made made ours with Hawaiian bread and it really made them great.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  This will now be a recipe I use in all my foods classes.

Oh my goodness these were addicting! I was a bit skeptical to try these at first because I thought that the crumbled ground beef would be weird in a burger vs. patties but these were excellent. I thought I had a package of onion soup mix lying around but I didn't so instead I added a finely chopped medium onion when the beef was almost cooked through and onion powder, garlic powder, seasoning salt and pepper to taste. I loved the addition of fresh onion and probably would have felt like this recipe was missing something if I had not added it. I found these great slider buns (at Greenwood market for you seattlelites) that conveniently came in a 24 pack. I'm glad that I found these because I'm not sure how I feel about using sweet hawaiian rolls. I love those rolls with butter but I just don't think I'd like them with burgers. I had leftovers and they tasted great heated in the microwave the next day. Thanks so much for this recipe!

WOW these were so good!!!  Ididn't use the sweet rolls, I used potato rolls from the bakery.  And I scaled it down to 8 servings.  Yummy!!  I didn't what the others suggested by wrapping in foil and not using a baking sheet.  Thanks for this new staple for our home!

I didn't pre-cook the hamburger mixture. I spead a thin layer on 60(4 pks)White Dollar Rolls from Walmart and baked them wrapped in foil for 45 mins at 350 degrees. Great way to please a crowd!

Fun and simple, we really liked them leftover the next day even better.  I didn't brown my meat, just mixed it all together (as suggested by other reviewers), and they came out great!  My bread was a little crispier than I had hoped, but other than that, great!  Oh..I don't like Lipton Onion Soup mix, so I used a different one (Garlic and Herb) and it worked out well.

Talk about addicting!  My guys have asked for these numerous times since the first time I made these.  I didn't change a thing and they were perfect.  Wrapped the few leftovers in the foil and then reheated them the next day.  The guys said they were better the second time.

I don't care for soup mix, so I used real onions, I also tasted too much mayo, so I might leave it out next time. Overall it was pretty tasty. Not so sure they taste like WC, but good. I used "sweet dinner roll" recipe for the buns...

These were FANTASTIC!!  The only thing I didn't do was add the mayo (hubby won't touch it with a 10 foot pole).  For 2 people, this makes a ton.  It warms up pretty well the next day.  Great recipe!

These were super-easy to make and fun to eat!  I halved the recipe but accidentally added the entire envelope of onion soup mix, they still turned out great!  My husband and kids really enjoyed them, and it was different enough from a regular hamburger to make it fun for our family super bowl party.  I used Hawaiian rolls and did bake them for only 20 minutes as some other reviewers suggested.  Thanks, Minnesota_Girl for sharing a fun and tasty recipe!

I found these very tasty but make sure not to put in too much onion soup mix because it is very salty.  You really have to like onion soup because that is mostly what we could taste.  My son doesn't like onion had he tried one and would not have another.  I would still make again when he is not around for dinner.

A big hit at our superbowl party!  I followed other reviewers advice and prepared in the morning, kept buns intact (not separated), and put pickles on before wrapping in greased foil.  Turned out great!

Served these for Super Bowl and were really liked by my gang. I omitted the onion soup entirely and replaced it with lots of fresh minced onion, garlic and onion powders and black pepper. Definitely tasted very much like White Castle and I'll certainly be making this again. Thanks so much Minnesota_Girl!

Fan-Tastic! I added Montreal steak seasoning to the beef. Placed burgers in a baking dish and covered with foil! Do brush the tops with the butter/onion flake/mustard sauce as someone had posted. Very good!!

These are really good. Made them last night for my daughter and me, so only used half a recipe.  Used potato dinner rolls (store was out of hawiian dinner rolls, but these were just as good) and used a little over half a pack of onion soup mix.  Only baked about 15-20 minutes.  I think she wants them again tonight. Definately will make a whole batch for my house-warming party.  I think this is the first recipe that I didn't need to change a thing. Thanks for the good idea!

I followed the recipe almost to a 'T.'  I omitted the pickles, and added two different kinds of cheese (specifically, sharp cheddar and a little smoked gouda) and hot sauce before baking.  The boyfriend LOVED them.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It's a real keeper. :)

These mini burgers are great!!! I wasn't sure about them at first, after reading some of the different reviews!! I made them for watching the AFC championship and maybe they were better because the COLTS won, however, they were delicious!!! Add pickle and mustard and they taste very similar to white castle burgers!!! YUMMY!!

These burgers are wonderful.  I make them every other week.  I get the sliced dinner rolls from GFS (they are perfect)  I also have added extra dehydrated onions when browning the burger.  I think they are better than White Castle!

A quick and easy hit with adults and kids!  I didn't have any onion mix so just used salt, pepper and onion powder while cooking meat and they still tasted 'authentic'. Used both Hawaiian roles for kids and larger buns for adult with success with each. Can't wait to make for a larger crowd during football.

I accidentally added the mayo and cheese while the heat was still on, which cooked those some with the meat and soup, but I think that helped make it not taste as "mayonnaise-y" (also cut the recipe in half, with just one lb of beef, and used 1/4 cup mayo). Loved them with pickles. Will probably make again!

Loved these! They tasted a lot like Krystal burgers, which have always been a guilty pleasure for me. I used 1 lb ground turkey with 12 Hawaiian rolls, and there was too much meat mixture to fit in the rolls, so I'd rec having extras. Everything else was great!

This recipe was very easy to make. My hubby is a burger and fries kinda guy, so when I decided to "change" his burger I was a little scared. But he loved them. He said "you don't even need ketchup for them" We both agreed this recipe is a keeper. The only thing I changed was the onion soup mix (I don't like it)I just used onion powder, it seemed to be fine.

Excellent recipe!  I did not put them on a pan, rather just wrapped in the foil and straight in the oven.  I was a little skeptical at first thinking the buns would get soggy and they did not.  I used the Beefy Onion soup mix and it gave excellent flavor.  I didn't use mayo or pickles, as most of my family doesn't like them.  I halved the recipe and the one cup cheese was not enough so I would definitely use more next time.  I used the buttery top King's Hawaiian rolls and they were a HUGE hit!  Even my 5 year old ate 3 of them and he usually is not a fan of hamburgers or anything like it!  Thanks for the recipe!

These little burgers are addictive!!  So yummy :)  I made the recipe as directed and it turned out great-I did find it easier to cut the rolls when they were partially frozen.  Still heated through great.  Will recommend and make again!

My husband made these for us last night and used 1lb ground beef and 1/2 packet of french onion mix and velveeta instead of shredded cheese.  They turned out fantastic!!! We live about 2 miles from White Castles so I was skeptical, its close but not quite the same.

I did it how a reviewer suggested in the 13 by 9 baking pan and cut it in squares.  I left out the mayo.  Also, I quickly put the meat patties on the buns and placed them back into the bags.  I closed them for a few minutes while preparing sides and the steam will soften the buns.

These were just ok.  The onion soup mix really added nothing to flavor these.  I took another reviewers suggestion of topping these with the butter, dijon, minced onion, and worcestershire sauce.  That alone is what gave this a slighly decent taste.

These were delicious! I used a little less mayo, and a little more cheese. And next time will do on soft dinner rolls. Used the kings hawaiian and they were too sweet. Also only baked 20 minutes. They would have burned at 30.  And probably 15 would b better. Will definitely make again. Great recipe!

I was super excited to make these for a football party. Everyone said they tasted like White Castle ... I thought the flavor was a tad bland but not bad. I put a pickle on top of the meat and used slider buns. You could use about any flavor cheese - I’ll try pepper jack next time

I added a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to the meat mixture as well as 1/3c of mayo. Flattened out on a baking sheet and baked for 10min. Added chopped onions and baked for 10 more min then added cheese slices and baked for 5 more min. Placed meat patty on bottom buns added top then baked for 5 more min.

GREAT FOR CAMPING! I've been making this recipe for years and it's always good, I follow it exactly as written.  But I wanted to share something I hadn't seen in the comments. We make this for camping!! I make the meat ahead of time and slice the bread. Then I spray some foil with a nonstick spray. Wrap the burgers in the foil and warm them over the campfire, or on a grill. Can't wait to take them camping tomorrow!

I followed the recipe & added in diced onions. We had dill spears on the side & used Kings Hawaiian rolls. They were perfect! My husband & I loved this & my 2yr olds liked it too. So easy to make.  Thank you!

I halve the recipe, and don't add the cheese to the meat. I just prefer sliced american cheese on my burgers! This is a regular meal in our rotation. I definitely want to try experimenting more with it.

Don't even waste your time! These don't even begin to compare with the classic White Castle hamburger. Very disappointed. These were just kind of weird.

I make these, put them in sandwich bags, drop them in a couple gallon ziplock bags, and freeze them. They’re so nice to have on hand.

Excellent!  I made it per the recipe but added about five shakes of Worchestershire to the hamburger when I was browing it.  SO delicious!

Good cheeseburgers. I made half the recipe with mini-buns. Also, I added bacon pieces. They taste like White Castle hamburgers.

My boyfriend loves these.  I added the dehydrated onion soaked in water for a bit.  They were fantastic.   Will make these again.  I picked up small brioche buns at Aldi.   They were perfect size for these burgers

I thought these were ok , but not spectacular. My husband liked them more than I did. I used Hawaiian rolls and halved the recipe to make 12.  Prepared as directed. Did put the pickle on the bun and pressed down the meat mixture which seemed to help the meat stay together more.  I love White Castles and didn't think they tasted like them at all, so maybe that is my disappointment. They just needed something....

My step-son said these are even better than White Castle’s.  Next time I’d reduce the onion mix by about half. Perfect with a little ketchup, mustard and pickle.

3.23.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/178295/slider-style-mini-burgers/ ... While I didn't get any, I got positive comments from those that did.  Well, two of the three; one said nothing, which is probably best.  ;D  Boychild, 21, said "fantastic" & Girlchild, 19, said "Good.  Like Hamburger Helper, but better since homemade."  I didn't know she'd had HH.  Oh, well, she liked this.  I used markdown labeled "hard dinner rolls," which I though may be too hard after buying.  No one said that.  :o  Girlchild said she liked the rolls, too.  Huh.  :O  :D ... 4.10.19 ... I froze half of the meat mixture.  'Came across a markeddown package of Hawaiian Rolls & "went with it."  Haha.  It looks like too much filling & would be if only meat, but it isn't so it isn't.  :D  The buns have a close-to-grilled crispness.  'More toppings & condiments required for this girl, but that's easy enough to fix.  :) Note: Bikerfamily likes Hawaiian Sweet mini sub rolls (precut). I use a gigantic piece of Big Foil (as it's called at my house, that's the extra wide foil), lay out the bottom section of the rolls, carefully get the meat stacked and distributed on the rolls, top with the top rolls, wrap the Big Foil around the sandwiches as best you can. I often do the prep days ahead of the actual baking and serving... 
https://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/freddys-burgers/ ... 3/7/20: Sixteen regularsized buns filled & half filling left.  :o  More buns next time  - or less filling.  :D

I made these yesterday for a party and they were a huge hit. My husband said they tasted like white castles. My husband loved them, so I didn't have the heart to tell him it included mayo which he hates. we will definately make these again.

I substituted ground turkey for ground beef and used a half packet of ranch dressing mix instead of onion mix and were such a hit with the kiddos! I used regular dinner rolls instead of the sweeter Hawaiian rolls to decrease the amount of sugar as well.

These are great little burgers. I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo because that's what I had on hand. The onion soup mix really adds flavor to these sliders, and saves time since you don't have to chop up raw onion. One of my kids didn't care for them, so they may not get made very often, but I, personally, enjoyed them a lot.

Added diced bacon and served with pickles and mustard on the side.  Seriously a hit for the Super Bowl crowd.  Next time I will add more meat mixture to the buns, per request.  This is a keeper!

Easy to make. I used a bit of Whataburger creamy pepper sauce and shredded Monterrey jack to give it a kick. I kept the rolls on the Hawaiian tray (oven safe up to 350-deg) with nonstick foil on top.

Very salty. I halved all the salty ingredients ... mayo, onion packet, cheese... and it was still extremely salty. On the positive side, kids love it!

I have made this many many times. I use the deli baked slider buns that are baked fresh every day. I have also substituted the fresh deli whole wheat hamburger buns and made these full size rather than slider size. They are a great meal and are quick and easy. They disappear quickly!

An interesting note from me on this: I attempted to make these vegan by substituting ground beef for veggie ground, and mayonnaise for vegannaise.  While I eventually goofed by buying regular dinner rolls (whoops, you kinda use milk to bake ...), this says nothing of how otherwise phenomenal these turned out.  I had 4 people ask for the recipe at the potluck I made these for.  Will absolutely be making them again for some week-long lunches~

I made these two weeks in a row. The first time was for a party and I made it exactly as the directions said. Everyone loved these. I made them again for just my family but halved the recipe. They are good reheated in the microwave as well.

These were so good! Taste a lot like White Castle. I halved the recipe, (just 2 of us at home) used ground turkey instead of beef, and skipped the pickles. But otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make these again!

I usually make half amount for my family of 3, that is plenty for us. I do use the whole packet of dry soup mix with 1 lb of ground beef.  We love the full flavor.
When fixing for a crowd, like a soccer team meal, these are the first to go! So simple, I make the meat mixture ahead of time so all I need to do is quickly assemble them. I fit 15 mini slider buns into a (sprayed) disposable tin foil pan, brush on the yummy seasoned butter topping suggested by another reviewer, cover with foil, pop in the oven and they are done in a jiffy. 
I like to fix a big batch of the meat ahead of time to freeze in smaller portions for a quick dinner without a mess.

Love these! Went with fresh onion, no mayo , salt to taste and used grated Mexican blend cheese. Some cheese in the mix and some light sprinkled on top.   I used the  Original Hawaiian rolls and basted the tops with the suggested half cup butter, I tbsp Worcestershire sauce and 1 Tbsp Honey Dijon mix . prepared in microwave measuring cup. I prepared these on the cardboard bottom of rolls came on as you can heat rolls in them and then wrapped in foil. The reason is that my very first batch burned on the bottom in spite of being on a broiler baking type pan. I had to replace the bottoms with some extra rolls so this time I am using a insulated cookie sheet as well as the roll board. I think I will bake them at a lower temp. Everything in these is cooked so I'm not sure where that high of a temp is needed or maybe I won't cook them quite as long. I'm going to try and freeze some this time for quick meals.  Awesome recipe! I just adjusted it to my own taste. Thank you to the poster for sharing!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't use the mayo (I don't like it) and I cut up red onions and cooked it with the meat.  I think next time I will try a different slider bread than the Hawaiian Rolls.  They were a bit sweet.  It is something we will be making in the future.

My family and I loved these little sliders! Fun, quick and easy weeknight meal. I halved the recipe and made 12 sliders, forgot and dumped the whole pack of onion soup mix into the ground beef, but it turned out great, maybe better, who knows! Used the KIngs Hawaiian savory (not sweet) butter rolls and they worked perfect. In my opinion the pickles cut the richness of the meat mixture and add a little texture, so I would definitely recommend adding the pickles. Thank you!

I added worcestershire sauce to the beef and  topped them off with caramelized onions before putting them in the oven. They were a big hit at both parties I brought them too. Make sure you get very lean ground beef or else you will end up draining all of the onion soup mix flavour. Otherwise add the soup mix after you drain the grease.

Not a hit.
I made this recipe for a dinner party with friends and it wasn't great. Used half the amount of onion soup mix and mayo, and it turned out dry and boring.
Wouldn't make this again.

Love these, they were a huge hit with everyone! I only used one package of soup mix and I topped the meat with land of lakes American cheese before adding the bun tops. I used Kings Hawaiian jalapeño rolls and kings Hawaiian butter rolls, the jalapeño got rave reviews.

Theses mini sliders are great!!! I am from the Chicago area and these truly taste like White Castle's , The best part is you know what is going in them so you have control.  I only made a couple of changes, First I made my own onion soup mix from this site and I also cooked the beef with some onion for added onion flavor.  I probably did not use as much mayo either I did not measure it just mixed some in.  I made these for a Super Bowl part and they flew off the palter! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Made this for "guys night out" and it was an instant hit. I had to make a second batch.  Someone suggested that I start a food truck with just this on the menu.

Anyone who rates this recipe as less than 5 stars is crazy!! Just make sure to drain the grease before adding the mayo and cheese and a pickle. Other than that, make it exactly as the recipe and no one will be disappointed. I have made this for many events, from gourmet dinner club to tailgating and I never have leftovers and everyone asks for the recipe!! Don't overthink it , people, it's just an amazing slider recipe!!

It was very good, however a bit too cheesy for my taste. I substitued one pound of ground beef for ground turkey. Next time I'd cut the cheese back to about one cup and perhaps add some diced green peppers,  onions and mushrooms but otherwise a very good recipe.

Very good recipe that I will make again. I added some dried onion that I had rehydrated by soaking in a little milk for 30 minutes. Only used half the soup and that was enough. Next time I will use plain dinner rolls since we didn't like the sweetness of the Hawaiian ones. The hardest part of this recipe was cutting the rolls apart. Because they were so soft they squished and the knife got stuck. Simple pre-cut  dinner rolls next time.

Delicious!!! My husband and kids were blown away!!! My husband took some to work for his lunch and was the envy of his coworkers. I've been asked to make a batch this week for him to share. It's so SUPER easy!!! My grocery store was out of Hawaiian Rolls so I used the slider buns from their bakery instead. Thank you for the recipe!!!

Delicious! I halved it and used a topping that was delicious. About 2 T. melted butter, a little less than 1/2 t. Dijon, a little less then 1/2 t. Worcestershire sauce and 1/4 t. minced onion mixed and brushed on top. I also used ground turkey. Couldn't tell it was turkey!

Amazing!  Very rich.  Made exactly as written but used Martin's dinner rolls (I could not find King's Hawaiian, but they would have been superior). Even better the next day.  These almost taste like a philly cheesesteak.  I would not recommend doubling the onion soup mix, but instead, add some caramelized onions on top.  Next time I will try this recipe on french bread.

Ok, I made it as the recipe calls for, and it was good.  But, I agree with the mayo part, so I tweaked it, and it turned out awesome.  I added a second pack of onion soup mix to the 2 pounds beef, and dropped the mayo to two tablespoons.  I added about a tablespoon of garlic powder, and dropped the cheese to 1 cup.  This turned out just like the restaurants.

I did find salty but in defense, I used 1.5lbs. organic beef (tends to be drier) and still the full packet of onion soup mix. I didn't measure the cheese and mayo but I think I used a little less and I was happy with that. Served on bakery dinner rolls and just added sliced pickles, no other sauce. For me, Hawaiian rolls would be too sweet and clash. Family was happy!

This is definitely a keeper. I didn't have 2 pounds of ground beef so I cooked up a little bacon and put it in them. So moist and delicious. Love the flavor.  My son dipped his ketchup and said it was the best "sloppy joes" he had ever had. Which is quite the compliment.

I made this recipe but instead of putting it on individual buns & cooking in the oven, I browned the ground beef, drained it then added the soup mix, the cheese & mayo then put it all in a crock pot on the lowest setting to just keep it warm.  I served it with the slider buns & pickles & ketchup & mustard.  I call it crockpot sliders & everyone loves it & they can add the fixings as they wish.  Love it!  Perfect for game day!

Great addition to our annual Ornament Party held in early December each year.  We have had a set menu, and when we celebrated the 15th Annual Party....we decided we needed a special treat.  And these really hit the spot with our friends and family.  Now they are a regular part of our set menu!  Thank you for sharing this easy, tasty party food.

I made this recipe for the first time for a church potluck.  I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and adjusted the ingredients accordingly.  The only thing I added to the meat was Worcestershire Sauce.  The only change I made was by using the smallest hamburger buns I could find.  I didn't think the Hawaiian rolls would be big enough.  But maybe I'll try that next time.

I got good reviews at the potluck.  I couldn't believe how good the mixture was, especially with the mayonnaise.  I made 24 burgers and came home with only 5, so I'd say it was a success.

I loved the idea of this recipe. The result was extremely salty. I think I'll look for an onion mix recipe so I can control the salt. If the salt can be reduced, I would make this for family gatherings often!    The instructions the submitter left about keeping the tools together really helped! The Hawaiian rolls were a great choice.

My family really loved these! I even ate leftovers for breakfast this morning. I recommend if you re-heat in the microwave to wrap in a wet paper towel.  It softens the buns right up.

Great burgers and very addictive. Have tried them on two types of buns and prefer regular mini-burger buns verses the sweet, Hawaiian type of rolls. The meat mixture can easily be made up a day or two ahead of time, and these can get dinner on the table in thirty minutes. Mustard and a couple of hamburger dills slices and they're even better!

These little sandwiches are great!  I used 2 envelopes of onion soup mix and the Kings Hawaiian rolls T, and will definitely make them the same way in the future. Thanks for a great recipe.

I can't believe how good these slider's are.
Very close to going to "White Castle". I make 
them and freeze them, then micro wave when I want
some.Thanks and Good Job!

Pretty easy and awesome. I didn't have onion soup mix - so I just used onion powder, salt, and ground pepper. I also don't like mayo - so I just skipped it and added mild cheddar cheese. It turned out yummy - not too salty and perfect. We used 5 small burger buns and 1 lb of ground beef, perfect for 2 people.

It was messy and without a lot of flavor.  We all agreed it was NOT a keeper. We had to put lots of extra condiments on them to make them even palatable.

Very dry and just not much flavor. OK but not great. Did use the King's Hawaiian rolls like the original submitter of this recipe suggested.

I made these but halved the recipe since it is only my husband and me.  I added a little more than half of the onion soup mix.  They were so tasty.  My husband loved them. I will make them again!

Most of us loved these. Used about 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef and about 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix and 12 rolls. Put extra cheese on top of meat mixture before putting the bun tops back on. We liked the sandwiches better with dill pickles other than without.

Omg! These were awesome! I added the spread to the buns as advised by "cookin4therapy". My teenager, my 5 year old, and hubby raved about it! The mayo threw me at first. I was not sure what to expect when i mixed this in. I will definitely be making this again! I give this two big thumbs up! :)

Yes, very good.  Next time, I will add onions, also.  I wonder how these would work as a lettuce wrap?  I will try it.  One more thought, I wonder if the women that tasted the mayo were NOT  using real mayo, but salad dressing instead. Big difference.

As I wanted to grill the sliders, I created slider patties using the beef and onion soup mix. I used one pound ground sirloin and one pound ground chuck! Was super delicious. Served on Hawaiian rolls, with guests choice of sharp cheddar or pepper jack cheese, with assortment of condiments!

My 8 year son picked this & helped make it. Very simple & everyone LOVED it. I made it for a dinner swap & that family raved. It's a keeper. Made it just the way it is except I added a chopped onion, wrapped each burger in tin foil individually & used Rhoades Rolls. MMmmm!!

This was amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly as instructed and it turned out just like White Castles.  It was a lot, so I bagged them in snack bags and put them in the freezer.  We used them on actual burger buns and sandwich bread.  It's gets pretty greasy but when we reheat it, but it's easy to drain the meat.  Definitely a keeper!

I'm giving this 4 stars for the idea, but I made a TON of changes to this - and mine ended up really not even being the same recipe.
I used 1.25 lbs of 96/4 extra-lean ground beef. I seasoned with 1 Tbsp of dehydrated onions, 1 tsp salt, 1 1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, and a dash of paprika. I shaped them into 12 adorable patties - using a heaping Tbsp of meat mixture for each slider. I then grilled these on a propane grill for about 6 mins per side. Topped with quartered slices of american & swiss cheeses. DELISH!

I have made these so many times!! They always come out good, sometimes I just use regular hamburger buns. Even my super duper duper really picky daughter gobbles them up. I agree to cut back on the onion soup mix though.

this was so good, I am in white castle heaven.  I now live in seattle, and this city has never been graced with the presence of fresh wc sliders.  I no longer have to get my childhood memories, being born and raised in Chicago, from the supermarket frozen food case.  I can make my very own, for a fraction of the price of the grocery store.  and, for a much fresher and scrumptious flavor, I might add.  I followed recipe to a t, except I didn't use Hawaiian rolls as I don't recall wc using sweet buns, and didn't bake but just nuked for about 2o seconds as I wanted a soft, not crunchy bun.  came out tasting like home.  thank you so much mn girl, for posting this fantastic recipe for this great comfort food for us transplanted midwesteners.

OMG! These scrumptious little burgers taste like White Castle sliders! So good! I changed a few things to "clean" the recipe up just a little bit. I used ground turkey, instead of beef. I use reduced fat mayo with olive oil and whole wheat rolls! I also used monteray an colby cheese instead of cheddar. Will make again and again and again. Thanks!

Only 5 stars?  This should get 10 stars!!!!!  I loved it.  Taste just like White Castles!  I live in Virginia so the closest White Castle is in New Jersey.  From now on it'll be in my kitchen!!!!  The only thing I added was minced white onions to it.  Delicious the next day also.  Just reheat in a paper towel for 15 seconds!  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe.

I buy my Hawaiian Rolls at Walmart.  I only make 6 at a time.  But I am thinking of making some and freezing them.  These would be great to take down to Mexico and after a day on the beach put them in the oven.

Perfect Hearty Superbowl Sides! Easy to pick up and filling. They flew off the plate. The men and kids at the party loved them. Children took them home for their lunch boxes the next day. You definitely can't just eat one.

Very good and easy.  A different way to enjoy hamburgers.  I followed a reviewers advice and ate them on Hawaiian sweet rolls and it was okay but the flavors seemed to clash for me.  Next time I'll try regular rolls - personal taste I guess.  Still a great recipe that you can adjust to your own liking.

These burgers were great and very easy to prepare. I cut the recipe in half and used the "sauce" for the top of the rolls like someone else mentioned. I also used potato dinner rolls instead of the sweet rolls. I wrapped them tightly in aluminum foil and cooked them for about 15 minutes. They turned out great! The only downfall.. they did not re-heat very well so they are not good leftover (in my opinion). I did; however, save some of the meat for burgers later this week.

I was looking for a slider recipe to take to a family party since I had some King's Hawaiian rolls left over from another party. I made 24 and had some meat left over (which is good). These were delicious!!! And a very big hit at the party, all gone and several people asked me for the recipe. I will make these again for sure. i'm looking forward to some leftovers but sadly, I'm out of buns. Thanks for the recipe.

Very, very good.  My only slight problem was getting the crumbled beef mixture to stay together in the bun - anyone have any suggestions for this?

So easy and flavorful. I was very surprised that these were so good with onion soup mix alone. I used less mayo because my husband is a mayo hater. I think they would have been even better with a bit more. I also brushed the top with the butter mixture that a past reviewer posted. Very yummy!

Really wonderful, indulgent little sandwiches. Only addition I make is to add some velvety in the beef mixture. Adds some cheesy deliciousness!

I'm giving this 4 stars because my husband loved these little burgers. I thought they were okay .. Just not a big fan of cooking with mayonnaise. Overall though, these were a fast and easy meal fix.

Made this for my family and they loved it! I used the sweet Hawaiian bread instead of dinner rolls.  Also made this using a pizza burger spice packet from Target.  Used mozzarella as the cheese--we loved that as well!

Very good... tastes a lot like Krystal's little burgers once I added mustard and more cheese! BTW, to the user below who mentioned White Castle, have you never gone to Krystal's in Alabama?  They taste much better than White Castle!!!

Awesome! They do taste like White Castle burgers. I did a dozen and we had two left. I used American cheese in mixture. Topped them with a third of slice and pickle after cooking.  Even my three yr.old son asked for another one. The butter sauce adds another taste ,which is good brushed on or if you don't have a brush, just dip top of bun in sauce. I pressed buns down and close to other rolls so their wasn't much meat falling out. This will be on my dinner rotation.

Very good, very easy. Made 2 1/2  recipes of it. My boys are eating them like crazy. Next time I will use the Hawaiian rolls. I got slider buns and they where a little stale. The rolls will knock them out of the park.

These sliders were quick, easy and extremely tasty.  Didn't even need the salt and pepper shaker.  I adjusted the amounts to make only 5 (for supper) but I can't wait to make them for a crowd.  I used 90% fat ground beef and did not cook the beef first.  Made it like you would a meatloaf and shaped them and put them in the rolls.  Baked half hour as directd.  PERFECT!

Just made these for the first time.  Very yummy and extremely easy.  For my family of 5 I halved the recipe and also added some diced onion in with the meat and soup mixture. I will definately be making this again. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

Not terrible, but I agree with the folks that said way too much mayonaise.  My son didn't complain....said they were "okay"... Will probably try again with a lot less mayo.

The sliders were good, but they didn't taste as much like white castle as I was hoping.  As we now live so far away, I was craving the nostalgic taste and was disappointed.

I gave this 4 stars because of the texture. It was like eating burger flavored sloppy joes. Didn't hold together like a burger. Easy to make, & good taste(although I will add a chopped onion next time) Just wish they would've held together better. No kids at home anymore, but I can see my gkids loving these...

What a fun dinner!  Really tasty and easy.  Next time I'll make it with plain rolls...the King Hawaiian were a little too sweet for me.  Wouldn't change a thing with the filling.

2 stars. Tried this recipe twice and its MUCH easier to just get the White Castles or Krystals! Ground beef version is messy and not worth the work. Sorry, I really wanted to like this but not happening!

I've made this recipe a gazillon times and it's always a hit. However instead of mayo and cheddar cheese I've always used jared cheese whiz. They are like mini White Castles. Always a hit. I can't seem to find the mini rolls anymore, so I just use hot dog buns and cut them to size. Pickles are optional, but so yummy if you like them.

This is sooooo good!!! To cut a few calories I used Cabot 50% Jalepeno cheese and the Kraft RF Pepper Mayo! LOVE IT! It adds a little spice to it when I want that. They are AMAZING both ways!!!

Another bun option, Pepperidge Farm makes the slider buns and they are delicious.  They even are available in whole wheat.

Very good and close to the little burgers by a famous resturant.  I made the recipe exactly as MN Girl submitted, except used dinner rolls instead of King Hawaiian.

I did find it somewhat saltly, maybe by only using 1/2 or 3/4 of the onion soup mix?  Will try it that way the next time.

These were a hit at my son's birthday party, I made the butter-dijon sauce (check other reviews for exact recipe) to brush on top of the buns as recommended by other reviewers and it was great.  I did get some comments that they were more like "mini sloppy joes" but still tasted delicious.

These reminded me of Krystal. I added a little mustard to them mix and went ahead and just topped them with pickles before I put them in the oven. I wrapped them in foil and placed them on a cookie sheet to bake. Kept them nice a soft. Def want to make again and try some different things in with the mix.

These are darn cute!  Next time I'll make them with chopped onion and steam the meat, after browning with a bit of beef broth to cut some of the sodium.  I put morel mushrooms, sauteed in butter, on the burgers that my husband had.  Will make again with those changes.  Thanks for the recipe!

So easy and delicious!  Never did use the pickles, and I used ground turkey instead.  It came out wonderfully.  I added a dash of horseradish which gave it a pop.  I did heat them in the oven, but I prefer them on cold buns.

These were awesome.  I didn't have any mayo in the house so used half a can of cheddar cheese soup instead.  They tasted great!  Will definitely make again...especially the next time I'm to bring an appetizer to a party.

WOW! These are awesome! We are sold. I cut the recipe in half for just 2 ppl. They turned out just as they sounded. Added a little less mayo per others reviews and a touch of garlic powder. Other then that everything else stayed the same. I love that i only used one pan to cook the meat in. Makes for an easy cleanup!

These were great!  Better than I expected.  I did not have onion soup mix, so I threw in some dried onion flakes and a splash of Worcestershire for flavor.  Easy and delicious.  In fact, they were even better as leftovers.

I used the split dinner rolls from the Ingles Bakery.  I also used the store brand of beefy onion dry soup mix.  I skewered a couple of pickles on each toothpick and stuck on the tops of them.  They were so cute and a big hit at the party we took them to!  We ended up bringing 4 home and my husband reheated them in the microwave the next day and enjoyed them just as well.   I will absolutely make these again thank you for the great recipe!  UPDATE:  I have made these at least 5 times and they turn out great every time as written but I have figured out a way to make it even better.  When they come out of the oven add a couple pickles and a squirt of mustard to each one- with that change this is absolutely a 5+ rated recipe!

My husband ate so many of these it was crazy.  The entire house smelled like a Krystals restaurant.  He reports flavor was great and they even reheated well...I'm sure he'll have me cranking these things out weekly!

I didn't have onion soup mix so I fried a onion with the beef.  I used Pepperidge Farmer Buns since I never seen the Hawaiian rolls everyone is speaking of.  Love it!  Can't wait to make them again.

I also would give these 10 stars if possible!  I've made these twice now.  Definitely a favorite in our house and soooo easy!  We use the hawaiian rolls which are awesome but I'm going to try regular dinner rolls next time just to see how the taste is.

Wow! I made these for the first time on Sunday.  First day of football season!  They were so good but a little too salty.  Next time I will cut down on the onion soup mix.  It's great that the rolls come in a 24 pack so slicing them in half was a brease. Quick & great!  Thanks!

These are awesome, especially for how easy they are. They really do taste like White Castle. Yum! I substituted sour cream for the mayo since I really don't like it and they turned out awesome.

These were okay.  I made them as is and they were greasy even though I drained the beef really well.  I think it was because of the amount of cheese involved.  They also weren't too flavorful.  I tasted the meat with just the soup mix in it and it was great, but once I added the cheese and mayo it took away that flavor.  I like the slider concept so I may try them again but tweak the recipe a bit.

Yummy!  Used hot dog buns because that's all I had, but can't wait to do it with Hawaiian rolls.  I used chopped red onion instead of the onion mix, and it was great.

Man...these are awesome!  I brushed a little melted butter on the bun tops before baking. I baked them wrapped in foil without a cookie sheet. I used the Kings Hawaain mini buns and everyone devoured these! Thanks so much!

We loved these, I only rated it a 4 because I changed it a bit.  I cooked onion with the beef and seasoned the beef with salt, pepper, and a dash of garlic powder.  I also just used regular hamburger buns.  Everyone loved them, including my 2 year old!

Did not change the recipe at all and I almost halved the recipe becuase I didn't think we would eat them all. Luckily, I didn't because there were 3 left at the end of the night. Everyone loved them!

These were great! I've made these a few times now and I just love them. I forgot the onion soup mix the last time and just diced up a white onion, mixed half with the ground beef, then topped the browned meat of with the rest before putting in the oven. I sprayed the tin foil so it wouldn't stick and these came out perfect. I couldn't taste the mayo at all! Great recipes:)

I made these a while back and forgot to rate them.  We really liked these!  Had some left over that I rewarmed for lunch the following day, just as good the second time.  Easy and something different.

These are awesome! Have made several times now just as stated. My husband took some to his father and were a big hit there also. When I told them the recipe they were shocked because of the mayo, not big fans of it. Many thanks for the super easy and yummy recipes!!!!

These were a hit! Even my VERY picky 6 yearl old loved them.  Followed the recipe exact with the only addition being american cheese on top of the meat mixure before putting on the bun tops. Will be making these again and again.

My husband went absolutely wild for these. The only thing I did differently was make it turkey meat and add some fresh minced onion into the meat as it was browning (in addition to the onion soup mix). Huge hit in my house because hubby cannot eat beef but longs for White Castles.

these were so juicy and awesome.  I used yeast rolls and they were SOOO good.  Also used the beefy onion mix, instead of the regular onion mix.

It was a bit funky - certainly not a terrific meal by any means. I followed directions - wish I would have halved it - now I have all this meat that no one will eat.

Excellent!  I used deer meat and followed the recipe as written along with some of the helpful hints (let the meat drain & cool before adding the mayo & cheese, sliced the buns all @ once, wrapped & baked in foil).  It was very easy to make and was a huge hit with the family!  My daughter said to rate it a 500+ :-)

These are nothing short of 5 stars.  My husband said they should be a ten!  I made them exactly as the recipe states, but put the pickles on the buns before baking them.  Also, I used soft potato rolls.  I made them for my sons 4th birthday dinner and we all loved them!

These were okay.  I used dinner rolls so will try the recipe again using different rolls.  It was a good thing I only baked about 20 minutes as they were getting hard on top.  I did like the fact that they were different from anything I had ever made.

These were good.  Everyone liked them.  But there was really nothing outstanding or special about them.  Nothing to make you say "wow...this is good."  I may make again as the kids like them and they were easy...  But I would leave out 1/3 of the cheese and the mayo...couldn't even taste it w/ all of the onion seasoning.

Very easy and tasty, my H reports (vegan here)nice and cheesy too.  I used ranch dressing in place of mayo only because I didn't have any. Not sure if it made it better, but he seemed to enjoy it.   I made the meat mix ahead of time, then assembled and baked later in the day.  It's a keeper for sure.

These were delicious.  I followed the recipe as written except for the baking time.  I baked 20 minutes @ 350.  I will be making these again, however i may add some extra onion to give it that definite White Castle taste.  Also would like to know if anyone has any suggestions as to how to keep the buns soft during the baking process.  My boyfriend just loved them but wasn't crazy that the buns got crusty.  Ohhh...we did squeeze mustard on them prior to baking. My boy friend says all sliders must have mustard :)

These are terrific and I didn't change a thing!!!  The meat mixture itself was delicious.  I couldn't stop eating it while I was waiting for it to cool.  I can't wait to make them for a group  I know they will go over very well.

Ok, but not great.  I did change to suit us, pepperjack for cheddar, homemade msg-free seasoning for onion soup, but that doesn't change what ruined this for me- I had a problem with the SLOPPINESS of these... Let me be clear- these are NOT burgers, they are mini burger flavored sloppy joes.  I had planned on grilling mini burgers but was foiled by a downpour and gave these a shot... Not gonna make this again, sorry.  Too sloppy joey, not burgery enough.

This recipe was amazing tasted just like White Castle  burgers. My whole family enjoyed them the kids could'nt get enough. I followed the other review of heating them on foil directly in the oven came out perfect. Added ketchup, mustard and a dill pickle stacker but it is so tasty you well enjoy them plain. Great as leftovers, buns not soggy just reheat in oven the next day.

These are great! My boys 13, 14 and 42 really liked them. I made a batch and a half (3 dozen) with brown and serve dinner rolls and they took left overs for lunch the next day.  I liked them with the pickles and a little mustard. Thanks for the recipe!

I served these as part of our Super Bowl fare. My guests LOVED them and I got many compliments...I thought they were very greasy and a little bland. (I did add a healthy amount of chili pepper to the final mix but still bland for my taste.) I think it should be noted that a good well-known brand of mayo should be used. I used the generic that I had on hand which probably cause some of the excess greasiness.

I just made these tonight, and I don't think they're like WC....but they aren't bad! Next time I would probably skip the mayo or at least lessen it to just a couple tablespoons. They're cute and it's a very creative recipe. For the onion soup mix I just used Mrs. Grass reduced sodium onion soup mix. And I didn't use it a whole package, it will still be way too salty.

I made these for a Super Bowl Party exactly like the recipe. They were so yummy. I cooked the meat and onion soup mix earlier in the afternoon and added the mayo and cheese. I assembled the mini burgers shortly before we left for the party and baked them there. Big Hit. I made quit a few, so we had enought to bring home for the two of us the next day. I didn't find the meat mixture too salty or bland. I might try the suggestion of using Monterrey Seasoning next time. Definitely will make these again.

These went over really well. The kids really enjoyed the fact that the burgers were small. I didn't have any onion soup mix, but I cooked the ground beef with onion and garlic powder instead. They were also good for carrying in lunches the next day. Easy, and a fun alternative to a 'regular' burger.

I recently made these and really enjoyed them, especially since I do not like, and will not eat, the White Castles!  I appreciate the other folks' comments.  I thought the flavor was a bit bland, so I look forward to tweaking the recipe to my tastes; maybe add green chilies or pepper jack cheese.  I also thought the Hawaiian bread was too sweeet, but will try the spicier flavors in the meat to balance that sweetness. Yes, make sure the foil is sealed well to keep buns soft.  It was very easy to make.  I also made it ahead of time and then put it together and baked it just before the party.

Yum! I halved the recipe quite easily. The bottom still got a little hard, but not bad, even using just foil and without the pan as per additional instructions. Will make again. Thanks for sharing.

We tried this tonight. My son and husband liked it alot, I thought it was just pretty good. I put half the mixture on Pepperidge Farms Slider Buns and half on the small sweet dinner rolls. All three of us like the small sweet dinner rolls better.

I made these and even my sometimes picky grandchildren ate them.  They are easy to make and tasty too.  Next time, I will probably add some peppers to bring some heat to them.

Delicious! I'm not a big meat eater, so for me to make this recipe was a big step for me. I did change it a bit. I used ground turkey instead of beef and instead of 1/2 cup mayo, i used mostly sour cream and a dab of mayo(not a fan). I'm not sure if this is the reason the sliders turned more into Sloppy Sliders, but regardless, they were an absolute hit! Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!!! These are YUMMY.  I don't do the typical slider from the restaurants.  These however, I could eat and eat.  My kids also loved them.  They decided they were definitely Super Bowl Sunday food.

These were great!!  I wanted to make hamburgers for dinner but only had 2 large premade burgers.  I chopped them up and used them for this recipe.  I cut it in half and it made 4 large burgers.  Just enough for my family.  Everyone LOVED them.  Will definitely make again!

I made these yesterday for my very picky 13-year-old son and he loved them. This kid normally hates onions, mayo, and will only tolerate cheese, but he devoured these. I liked them too. Added just a bit more mayo and cheese and some bacon. Now I know what I'm making Superbowl Sunday.

Hi, everyone.  I just finished dinner and guess what I made these burgers for dinner.  My husband really liked them.  I followed the recipe as it was written.  However, I used cooking spray in the bottom of the skillet and instead of using small buns I used kaiser buns.  Next time I will use smaller buns and pickles.  Tonight I used slices of tomatoes.  I did use only one pound of ground beef.  We both thought they were delicious.  Thanks for the terriffic recipe.

Yummy! These are tasty! I used ground turkey, diced onions, baked with the pickle and only 1 tbsp of onion soup mix (I was afraid it would be too salty). They definitely remind me of White Castle burgers. Will be making these again, for sure.

I made these 3 times before I realized I was doing it wrong, but it turned out great! And it was easier than the original! I mix everything together, RAW VERY lean ground beef, then shape into balls and flatten slightly to fit on the bun bottom, put on the top and cover the pan with foil, tightly, bake! They did not turn out greasy! yummy next time I might put the pickle on too.

This was really easy and was good.  I wish I would have seen the note earlier about just using the foil without the cookie sheet as I cooked this 10 minutes less than what it called for and the bottoms were burned.

These were VERY good!  My hubby gave me a fist pump and said "THIS HAVE to go in the regular rotation!"  He was skeptical with not making "patties" but as soon as he tasted them he shut up! :)  I didn't listen and put these on a cookie sheet and the bottoms did crisp up a bit.  Next time a will put right on the rack and not seperate until after they come out of the oven.

GREAT!  I used a taco seasoning mix because that's what I had on hand in my pantry.  These are a perfect size, and the mixture freezes well if you don't want to use all of it at once.

I tried this recipe because my husband was missing white castle burgers. He absolutely loved these, and he is a picky eater! I didn't use the whole 2 cups of cheese, but that's the only thing i changed from the original recipe. I will definately make this again. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe! We live in a crazy part of the world that doesn't have White Castle, the Mid-Atlantic. These taste pretty darn close to the real thing. Next time I will probably use 1 pound of meat for 24 rolls, I thought there was slightly to much meat. We are already looking forward to making them again.

My football guys LOVE these burgers.  They want them again.  I used turkey and only left them in the oven for 20 minutes.  I thought there was too much onion taste but I was vetoed by the guys on this opinion.

Thought these were really yummy, so did the rest of the family as we watched football this weekend. Mine ended up being more like little sloppy joes than burgers though.

These were great, even the picky eaters loved them. I did not change a thing; used Dena's more detailed instructions added later. I do think next time I will bake with the pickles, as that sounds even better.  Thank you Dena!

Loved these!  I thought with such simple ingredients it definitely would be something we wouldn't have time and time again...how wrong I was.  So simple and no overpowering flavors just very tasty.  Yum, thanks.

My family has been making these for years! They are not quite white castle but they remind us of them!!  We do not use the hawaiian rolls- we use plain mini hamberger rolls or dinner rolls that are sold connected to each other. It is easier to spread the filling that way.  Two package of soup mix would be WAY too much!! Pickles are an absolute necessity! I recommend extra pickles!!  I have never had trouble with them sticking- but we wrap in foil- try the easy release foil if you are having trouble.  Serve with ketchup!

Easy and yummy! I made these for my boys, and we all really enjoyed them.  I cut back just a tad on the mayo because they're not big fans, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did use homemade onion soup mix, though, and halved the recipe.  Next time, I would cut back even more on the mayo and cheese.  We'll definitely make these again.

Giving it 5 stars because I don't believe in deducting points when I change a recipe.  I made these today for my daughter's preschool graduation picnic.  Made a double batch and sub'd ground turkey and ground chicken and halved the amount of mayo.  Also used colby/jack cheese instead of cheddar.  Pretty good reviews from the crowd.

I had a hard time with them staying together. I followed the recipe to the letter and they just fell apart whenever you picked them up. Good taste but, very messy
