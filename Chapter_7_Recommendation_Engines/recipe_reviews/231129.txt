This was fabulous and we loved it! I used less liquid (vinegar and lime juice) to increase the lumpy factor. We loved the spicy zing of this one and even added slivers of fresh jalapeno. Lastly, I decorated it with pomegranate seeds and it was loved so much I had to add more... So it added a lovely sweet flavor to the spicy guacamole!

This was good. I liked the cumin and cayenne in it. It almost had a bit too much stuff in it for me, but it was a nice dip, especially if you wanted to make it for a party.

I added an extra avocado to cut down on the spiciness.  My family loved it!
