This is very good.  I'm excited because it is hard to find rhubarb in my area and I think this may serve well as a substitute.  I do think I'll cut the tomatillos a little smaller next time though.  They're kind of overwhelming when they're this large.

Yes! I will make this again! My dad is 95 & absolutely loves rhubarb strawberry pie. I gave him a piece of this wonderful tomatillo and strawberry pie. He loved it! When I told him it was not rhubarb but tomatillos, he couldn't believe it. I shared with family and coworkers, it's a hit.
 This year I had a bumper crop of tomatillos. You can only roast and freeze so many tomatillos. This is a fantastic way to use the littler ones. I'm making up several batches of the pie filling and freezing them. Lisa, you did yourself proud!

I used  end-of-season tomatillos from my garden and late season strawberries from California. My proportions were two cups sliced strawberries and four cups sliced tomatillos.

My tomatillo variety doesn't turn purple when ripe. Maybe it is sweeter, because it isn't as sour as rhubarb. I had a mixture of ripe and green tomatillos.

Also, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup of organic sugar. It is sweet enough.

Lemon juice was about 1 Tablespoon.

And, I made a deep dish pie (no bottom crust).

It is truly delicious and I will be making it earlier in the season, next time.

Thanks so much, Lisa! for sharing your creativity in the kitchen.

I used the small pineapple tomatilla which are slightly sweet, so I cut back on the sugar to 1 1/4cup.  I also forgot to put on the butter, which I would definitely do next time.  The finished pie was delicious.  The only drawback was the time it took to husk the 3 cups of marble sized tomatillas.

Great Recipe! We had an over abundance of tomatillos in our garden this year, and I wanted to make something sweet with this vegetables unique tart flavor. This was perfect!
