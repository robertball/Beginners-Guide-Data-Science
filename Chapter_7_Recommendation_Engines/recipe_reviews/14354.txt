Very good! I added grapes and mandarin oranges to the mix. I doubled the recipe except for the peach pie filling: I left that at one can, as I didn't want it to be overly sweet or slimy. It covered perfectly! Soaking the apples and bananas in the pineapple juice is pure genius! None of the fruit turned brown. A couple of notes: Make sure you drain all your fruit well because it will get sloppy quick. And the recipe states to arrange the kiwi on top for a reason. I got lazy & simply threw them in & after a couple of turns with the spoon, they promptly fell apart. 
Still very tasty though! Thanks for the recipe!

This fruit salad was perfect!  The best part about it is that there is no REAL recipe.  The peach pie filling, which by the way seemed like it might ruin the salad, really makes the whole thing!  I made this to go along with our cookout for my 2 year old's birthday party.  It was gone in no time, and I thought I had way too much.  I used fresh blueberries, kiwi, oranges, strawberries, grapes and on and on!  Not only was it great, it was beautiful served in a trifle dish, as you could see all of the bright colors!

WHAT A SALAD!! This is the best salad I have ever had. So far the pineapple juice acids havent turned anything brown, but next time I will add some lemon juice to be absolutely sure. So far its good but im making it for a large group for the first time. And with lemon juice you dont have to wait 10 minutes, you just douse it in it and go. Wow, i will make this for every family gathering from here on out. Its seriously that good. 5*****

I used this recipe for both of my daughter's wedding receptions. They were married just 4 weeks apart so I couldn't afford to cater them.  I used the calculator for 250 guests which made it easy to know how much to buy. I substituted the bananas and apples for grapes instead. I prepared the salad the day before and the leftovers kept for a week. Everyone commented on the great tasting salad and it was very colorful on the table.

My family does not usually like fruit salad, but they all like this one.  Although I added grapes, it didn't alter the great flavor.  I highly recommend trying it.

Excellent, Easy and great tasting!  It makes a big batch.  I made one recipe for 11 people at Easter and we had plenty left over.

This was actually quite good, We all were very surprized. No, really, we were! I made this salad as a side for breakfast for dinner. I used Jazz apples, I increased the kiwis and strawberries and I tossed my bananas and apples in a little lemon juice to keep them from browning. A pleasant surprize.

I didn't use peach pie filling (it was over $4.00!) so instead bought a small can (single serving size) of cling peaches.  Put in blender, added about a T of honey and about 1/2 t. cinnamon and made into a smooth sauce.  Poured over fruit salad as in recipe.  Would never have thought to use peaches (or pie filling) as a dressing, but the flavor was tasty and unique!  Family loved it and there were no leftovers.

i have been making a fruit salad similar to this for years and love it! the key is the pie filling, and really you could use any flavor you wanted.  you can add and subtract any types of fresh fruit you want.  and the preservatives in the pie filling keep many fresh fruits from browning (apples slices and bananas, particularly) as they normally would if you sliced them up and left them to sit out.  yum yum yum!!!!!!

We really enjoyed this.  Like other reviews, I was concerned about the peach filling making it too slimy.  I used a fork to remove the peach slices from the can instead.  That left about 1/3 of the can with only the filling which I discarded.  It turned out perfect!  I will definitely keep and make again.

Not the best.  The pie filling was the problem.  It made it seem like a recipe from the 80's or a cafeteria style salad.  I suggest just eating the fruit without the pie filling.

This was a terrific fruit salad.  I only made a couple of small changes.  I thought the peach pie filling was a bit bland, so I added some cinnamon and vanilla as suggested by others.  Also, mangos were on sale, so I added 2 of them.  My kiwis weren't very ripe, so after layering them on top of the salad with the strawberries, I sprinkled a little sugar over them.  Everything came out great.  I plan on taking this salad to my next card-club meeting.  When fresh peaches come into season, I may use them instead of the apples, and use apple pie filling instead of the peach.

I had never made fruit salad and was in a pinch for a recipe.  I tried this one - I omitted the bananas and added green grapes and blueberries.  It was the big hit at the party.  Everyone wanted to know the secret ingredient and were really surprised to find out how easy it is!!  I will certainly be making this again..Thanks!

I have been making this for years and it is always a big hit whenever I take it anywhere.  I usually chop up my peach pie filling so the peach sizes match other fruit sizes and use pineapple tidbits for smaller bites.  Recently I have been using 1 can peach pie filling and one large can drained and chopped peaches to cut down on the added sugar and also makes it a bit cheaper to make.  And it's not any less wonderful.  It's very flexible, I often just use what I have on hand rather than make a trip to the store.  Fresh orange slices, canned mandarin oranges, frozen blueberries or strawberries....It's ALWAYS good.

Excellent.  Peach Pie Filling does work very well.  Pineapple juice did a beautiful job of keeping the apples and bananas nice.  I used gala apples and they provided a crisp crunch to the salad. Also added grapes, mandarin oranges and raspberries.  Tip: if you don't want the fruit to mascerate too quickly or become too wet, then add the peach pie filling just before serving.  And because I don't like fruit salad that is overly sloppy, I only used enough of the pie filling to lightly coat.

Easy and quite tasty.  At a family gathering I watched a 14 year old boy get a bowl and eat it for dessert instead of the other desserts available.  Everyone loves this recipe.

Great job Pattie! I tried this salad for the first time tonight by bringing it to a church function. One of the women there actually went from table to table until she found me trying to discover who brought the salad so she could get the recipe and the secret ingredient. It's so versatile too. Blueberries work well and add a nice color also. It's very simple and quickly prepared. I'm really glad I made this one instead of the all-day preparation salad I was planning on. Thanks again for an easy, delicious recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  I made a few changes: I substituted grapes for the kiwi AND I replaced the peach pie filling with peach puree (a small can of peaches pureed with a little cinnamon) as recommended by another reviewer.  The pineapple juice on the apples & bananas worked very well.  I made this for a Father's Day brunch and it was completely gone within 20 minutes.  I have received lots and lots of rave reviews for this recipe, so I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!!!

I had to tell my grandmother to retire her recipe because this one beats it by far. Sorry grandma. I added some chopped grapes and blueberries like previous reviews. Instead of slicing the kiwis, I just chopped them into chunks. The hold better if you're lazy like me and just want to toss everything together. I doubled the banana, mainly because I wanted to use up the whole bunch. Loved it. Oh, and instead pineapple chunks, get the pineapple tid bits. The smaller pieces blend in nicely with the rest of the fruit.

Update: I think this recipe would be even better if a fresh peach pie filling is used instead of the canned. Everything is so fresh but the overly soft canned peaches bring it down. I recommend using a pie filling recipe from this website to create the "goo" that comes from the can with fresh peaches when they are in season.

2013 Update: I've made this many times. Skip the canned peach pie filling. Use fresh peaches when in season and a dash of cinnamon.

My grocery store did not have peach pie filling, which was upsetting, and since I was in a rush I used cherry pie filling.  It was definitely good and easy and I'll try it another time with the peach, because I think I'll like that better.  Thanks!

My mother in law actually said it was the best fruit salad she ever had. I made it the night before Easter brunch and it was fine.

This makes a beautiful salad, and I was pleasantly surprised by how long it stayed good in the fridge.  I also made several fruit substitutions, but it turned out great.  This is a keeper!

This salad is so fast to prepare and deliciously refreshing.  And the possibilities are endless; you can use almost any combination of fresh and/or canned fruits.  If you keep a can of peach pie filling on hand, this can be whipped up nearly any time on short notice.  Really yummy.

Looked pretty and tasted yummy!  The peach pie filling adds a very mild flavor; I may experiment with other fruit fillings like cherry or blueberry.

Really, I don't know why we would want to add all that sugar to a healthy salad. I thought I would try out adding the peach pie filling, but the peaches added a wierd texture( soft) that I didn't care for. In addition, I just couldn't help thinking about the gooey sugary addition. I'm a dietician and think next time I'll just add a little fructose to bring out the natural flavors of the fruit. I  picked out most of the peaches and left the gooey stuff. Next time, if I want some " goo", I'll mix up some instant vanilla pudding to add as a dollop on the top for a treat.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner based on all the rave reviews but I was VERY dissapointed.
Too slimy - nobody ate any.  My usual fruit salad with a lemon juice syrup is lighter and compliments the fruit better instead of smothering the flavors.
I wish I hadn't tried this.  I had to use the huge leftovers to make a ton of fruit bread.

I actually didn't eat this but made for a catering job.  After mixing the peach pie filling I ended up removing the peaches and putting in fresh peaches.  I added blueberries and pears and left out the bananas.  It was a huge hit.  My customer has ordered the fruit salad for another catering event. Thanks!

The canned peach pie filling was a little too much for me. It made the salad almost slimey. Next time I will just add fresh peaches when they are in season. I added green grapes and fresh blueberries also! Makes a large batch!

Followed the recipe with one can of peach pie filling but doubled the fruit and added red grapes and oranges.  Delicious recipe and would be really good with a dollop of whipped cream.  I would give it 5 stars.

This is a really good salad, but the peach pie filling makes it way too slimy for us. Don't get me wrong, it tastes really good, but the texture is not that appealing. Next time I will use 1/2 a can of the peach pie filling and maybe add a fresh sliced peach or two. Thanks! I will definitely make again!

I decided to try this fruit salad to bring to a friend's BBQ, because it looked easy and had good reviews. First, it was easy to make- and didn't require specialized or expensive ingredients. I was a little skeptical about the peach pie filling at first, but like the other reviewers have said- it really does make the fruit salad! It wasn't sickeningly sweet like I was afraid of, it just gave the fruit a light peachy glaze.  The only thing I would change next time is to not add the entire can of pie filling, there was some extra around the bottom of the dish at the end.  I got lots of compliments on this salad! I had NO leftovers. My friend was impressed that the apples and bananas didn't brown at all, and the fruit salad was out for a few hours at the BBQ.   Will definitely make again!

Use any fresh fruits and the pineapple really does keep the apple from "browning". I didn't have peach pie fill so I added a can of peaches (reserving the juice).  Put the juice into small saucepan, add 1 Tbsp. corn starch and mix well.  Heat until thickened.  Cool, add to fuit.  Delicious!

Great fruit salad. I couldnt believe how good it was!  Made it for dinner party. Lots of people, even kids ate seconds. My son loved it and asked for more the next day. Not too sweet which is what concerned me.

This is the best fruit salad ever!  Sometimes I change the fruits (and amounts) I add, only because that's how my family likes it.  And I use the pie filling but use fresh peaches instead of the ones in the filling because with the rest of the fruit being fresh I don't think canned peaches are as nice.  This is THE recipe I always make for my family and share with others.  It is yummy!

Simple preparation,great taste, and very pretty in a glass bowl! The peach pie filling gave a tasty glaze, and the bananas did not discolor, even by the next day. I will add this to my list of favorites.

This fruit salad is brilliant!  I love adding a few other kinds of fruits to it too.  Just use what you like fruit-wise.  I thought mangos were pretty awesome.  So are mandarin oranges and grapes. This is my favorite way to get fresh fruit now.  It can last for a few days in the fridge and makes a wonderful breakfast leftover.  It adds a nice glaze without being sickly sweet.  I was worried about that, but thankfully it is perfection.

This was a huge hit with overnight guests. The peach pie filling makes a wonderful flavor in the fruit salad.  Excellent recipe - thanks!

This was o.k., but it would not be my Sunday best, or any other day best fruit salad. It seemed like it was missing something, like some marshmellows, whipped cream, and nuts. I would make a lot of changes in this one. Sorry...

I used all the ingredients listed except the peach pie filling, I chose to use a peach/mango preserve and WOW it was fantastic!!
UPDATE***
I made this salad for a party the other day with a couple of changes.  I used a fresh pineapple and Smuckers Apricot and Peach Preserves.  I'm not exaggerating when I say people were calling their friends to come over and try it!!

I made this today for a wedding shower.  I doubled the recipe except for the peach pie filling.  Everyone went crazy for this.  This took some time cutting and chopping up the fruit but was well worth it. No one could guess the secret ingredient.  :)

Fantastic!  This salad is great.  I have added mandarin oranges or grapes to replace fruit I couldn't find or was out of season such as kiwi.  This is easy enough my 11 year can make it.

This fruit salad is wonderful!  I have been making it for over a year and am always asked for the recipe. The soaking of the apples and bananas in the pineapple juice really keeps them from turning brown. Instead of kiwis, I usually use green grapes and per another review, i add a little vanilla.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The pineapple juice soak a great way to keep fruit fresh for potlucks, bbqs, or any time you need to make ahead. I refrigerate the fruit cans and serving bowl before assembling. Apples and bananas make it an economical winter salad when other fruits are expensive.

Off season I used grapes and pears in place of berries and kiwis and it was still wonderful. I only rated it 4 since I changed the recipe and don't know how it tastes without alteration.

very good. I made this around this time last year choosing this recipe because several family members dislike fruit salad with the whipped cream/pudding/yogurt.... It was a hit, I could only find apricot filing, a smaller can. Planning to make again today with grapes.

I'm sorry, but I didn't like it. The reviews talked me into the idea that the peach pie filling would be okay even though I really thought I should leave it out. I should have trusted my initial reaction. It was sweet and goopy. I love fruit, just plain and I should have just made a plain fruit salad. That's what I'll do next time.

This was a wonderful fruit salad, i don't even like apples but they were good in this, followed the recipe to a t...i did put the kiwi and half of the strawberries on top or else the kiwis would've got all nasty...soaking the fruits in the pineapple juice was a great idea and i made this the night before i needed it and it lasted for days...don't be afraid of the peach pie filling (i was) but i used it anyway and it MAKES the salad...great fruit salad possibly the best!!

When I first made this recipe, I thought that it was a little better than just OK.   After letting it sit in the fridge for a day, the gel became thicker and it also tasted much better.  What I did next, just made this almost, "to die for", good.  I was trying a new recipe on allrecipes.com called "white gelatin" and still had a little bit of the fruit salad left, so I used it as the topping.  Wow! I can't believe how good the two taste together.  In general, I don't like gelatin, but the white gelatin recipe is made from cool whip, cream cheese and gelatin.

This recipe was very good but I had to modify it. First beware of chilling before you serve. I put mine in the fridge overnight and the pie filling turned into some sort of gel and the whole thing was awful until it sat out a few hours (have you ever had refrigerated apple pie? that consistency). The other downside to my refrigeration was that the pineapple lost it's flavor. It absorbed the other flavors and ended up being pretty much just decoration. Second following a previous review I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp of vanilla, which I thought was plenty. Very good but if you need to prep ahead make sure you have some time for the pie filling to return to consistency and wait to add the pineapple.

Who would've thought peach pie filling could do so much to pull a fruit salad together? This is wonderful! I made this for a Sunday morning football brunch, and everyone loved it.

This is excellent with a modification.  I was unable to find peach pie filling, so I searched for an alternate.  I used 3 8oz cups of non fat peach yogurt and it was a real hit with my family.  And it's healthier.  The second time I added a well drained can of mandarin oranges and it was even better.

I add all of the strawberries and kiwi (diced/chopped) directly to this instead of laying them on top. Honestly though, it works well if you leave everything in large chunks and dump it all into a blender at once. You just have to be careful to only blend JUST enough to mix and dice your fruit or it will all turn to juice.  I serve this as fruit salsa paired with homemade cinnamon tortilla chips or store bought cinnamon pita chips. 

One note... I add a lot of freshly squeezed lime juice to my pineapple juice and separate it evenly into two bowls, one for apples and one for bananas, for two reasons: 1. The best cook I know told me that lime is the best preventer of browning 2. I'm out on chopping stuff at different times during prep so I just do everything at the beginning and soak the apples and bananas simultaneously

Yum! I was pleasantly surprised. I was skeptical of the pie filling. Make choices in the fruit, but the pie filling is what makes this recipe unique. I also used green grapes, black cherries and fresh pineapple. I mixed the fruit with the pie filling and put it in a huge container. I saved the canned pineapple for a stir-fry the next night, but used the juice for soaking as directed. With the huge amount of fruit, one can of pie filling was perfect. By the time I took it to the party, the fruit had released a little juice and it thinned the pie filling a bit. Everybody loved it and the addition of apples gave it a bit of crunch. Don't worry about making it ahead of time and adding the fragile fruit right before serving.

I rate this recipe 5-stars.  I carried this to our Sunday School breakfast for 15 and it was a "hit".  Many questions of the secret ingredient.  I only made recipe for 8 and added 2-cups each of fresh blueberries and sliced red grapes.  Refrigerated all ingredients overnight except peach pie filling.  Added this Sunday morning. Absolutely beautiful.  After reading comments I did add the vanilla flavoring and cinnamon to pie filling.  Recipe for 8 with my additions was ample with some leftover. I will use this recipe whenever a fruit salad is needed!!!

This would have been a great fruit salad without the peach pie filling.  The filling coated every piece of fresh fruit with a thick, artificially sweet layer that was impossible to ignore.  Maybe I just like my fruit fresh and healthy :)

The goop of the pie filling was a little odd but I seemed to be the only one who noticed!  The  bananas and apples have stayed fresh looking a tasting from the pineapple juice for 3 days of leftovers.  I also added pomegranate seeds

I was really intrigued by this recipe and wanted to like it, but it was just barely okay. The peach pie filling made it too slimy, I think. I brought it to a potluck, and it was barely touched. I ate a serving of it, but brought most of it back home. It doesn't keep well, either.

I didn't hate it, but didn't love it either.

Great recipe, especially good topped with whipped cream (I used a can)! I made it to take to a church dinner the other night. Fortunately, not all of it would fit in my 'nice' dessert dish (and it makes a lot!), so I put the extra in a container and left it home. Had I not, we'd not have had any the next day, as the bowl got slicked clean at church.

I didn't think I'd like the peach pie filling in it, but it blended perfectly with the other ingredients. The whipped cream was a perfect accompaniment.

The first time I made this, I followed it exactly and I thought it was too slimey.  I tried the next time to just add 1/4 of the peach pie filling.  I had dried all the fruit yet all the liquid settled after an hour and looked gross.  I think if I make this again, I will just omit the peach pie filling and maybe sprinkle splenda or mix in some whipped cream for sweetness.

I made this as part of a summer Sunday dinner.  It was quick and very simple to follow.  It was a hit with my kids (6 and 4) as well as my husband and parents!  I bought kiwi fruit but they ended up being softer than I can like, so they were omitted.  The salad was still very delicious!

I love this. I made as directed and was so glad to find a recipe that didnt call for oranges as I personally dont like the texture of oranges in a fruit salad.

This was a great fruit salad, I usually don't try new recipes on friends/families until I know for sure that we will like it - but made this for my daughter's graduation party - it was a hit! Very good, I will definately make this again in the future!

I made this for my son's 4th birthday party & it was a huge hit!!!  Everyone loved it!  I used 2 cans of peach pie filling, 3 cans of pineapple chunks, 6 apples, 6 bananas, strawberries, 1 lg. can of mandarin oranges and green & purple grapes.  I topped with kiwi & strawberries according to recipe.  It was beautiful AND delicious!!!!  Thank you!  The pineapple juice does an EXCELLENT job of keeping the apples & bananas from turning brown!

So, I was lazy and only used the fruit I had at home, apples, grapes and bananas, and of course the pineapple chunks. But I think what makes this recipe so good is the peach pie filling. Refrigerate a few hours before serving, very refreshing. Just a tip, this doesn’t hold well overnight, the bananas get soggy and I can imagine the kiwis and strawberries would too.

This was EXCELLENT!  I halved the recipe as there were only 4 of us and I wasn't sure how it would keep if we had leftovers.  I used everything it called for except exchanged grapes for kiwi (my family does not care for it).  My 2yr old daughter ate 3 helpings of this and my husband 2 giant helpings.  We had nothing left at the end of dinner and everyone proclaimed "that was the best fruit salad ever."  It indeed keeps the name.

I have made this several times and just changed up the fruit depending on the season. I've also used frozen fruits too when nothing looks good in the produce section (or too expensive) Every time I bring this to potlucks, there is never any left and I'm asked for the recipe. This has been an addition to my family's Sunday meal as the kids (husband included) LOVE this. Thank you so much for a quick, easy, and delicious recipe!.

This was a nice fruit salad, but a little too much sliminess for my taste.  I would use more fresh fruit the next time and less pie filling or something else to coat the fruit -maybe honey or something.  Apples and bananas did stay nice and white after the soak in lemon juice.

I was really excited to try this after reading the wonderful reviews.  I thought because I like peach pie so much I would really enjoy this fruit salad.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  But I didn't like this at all......it came out like slimy fruit cocktail.   Maybe I did something wrong with the leftover pineapple juice....it didn't say whether to add the juice or discard it after letting the apples and bananas soak.  I woulld not make this again.

It was delicious.  Omitted bananas and added a can of sliced peaches b/c that is what I had on hand.  Refreshing way to end a winter holiday meal.  Thanks for sharing!

This is the top homemade fruit salad. I have got bored with the boring fruit juice fruit salads that are the same every time. This salad with the Peach Pie filling is an unexpected delight. The presentation and taste are spectacular! Everyone always asks what is holding all the flavors together and no one believes me when I say peach pie filling! Thanks Pattie for putting it out there for everyone!

Very good fruit salad.  I added a lot of fruit to mine, just kept adding till I felt that there was plenty of pie filling to cover.  I used 3 large apples, 2 bananas, pint of black berries (which get messy when mixed), a lot of grapes, the pineapple (and soaked apples and bananas as directed in recipe), a couple pints of strawberries.

This really is the best fruit salad I have ever had.  The peaches really are the secret ingredient in this recipe.  If using bananas make sure you dunk them in some pineapple juice a few seconds before putting them in the salad to keep them from turning brown. It really works well in keeping the salad for a couple of days.

Very nice. I made this for a family cookout and everyone enjoyed it. Soaking the apples and bananas in the pineapple juice is a great trick. I will be making this often.

This salad was FANTASTIC!! I made it exactly as written and received many compliments on it. None of the fruit browned thanks to that amazing tip for using the pineapple juice to soak the fruit that would normally brown. This will go into my party rotation for sure! Thank you OP for a fantastic recipe!

This is a pretty good sized recipe!  It was a nice spin on regular fruit salad....refreshing for summer!  When I served it EVERYONE thought it was really great..pie filling adds to it...could use Cherry instead of peach...may do next time.
A keeper!  Thank You.  :)

This is a fantastic salad for social gatherings! My husband thought the peach pie filling would ruin the fresh fruit, but it creates a light glaze instead. Great for warm weather.

Ridiculously tasty. I made this for a carry-in at work and it was a huge hit. I didn't do anything differently except double the recipe. I mistakenly dumped the pineapple juice after soaking the apples and didn't soak the bananas, but I don't think that made any difference.

Turned out well, very simple recipe which was awesome. We don't have peach pie filling in Canada(or atleast I couldn't find any) so I substituted it for apple pie filling and just omitted the apples. Worked well.

This fruit salad is delicious.  I've made it several times and what I like most about it is that you can use any kind of fruit you want.  I made it tonight with pineapple, apples, bananas, blueberries, strawberries and red grapes.  It looks as good as it tastes!

I made this for a family BBQ and everyone loved it.  I was concerned the pie filling would make it to sweet, but this was perfect.  I added a splash of vanilla extract as well.

I was concerned about the pie filling also, but this salad was incredible.  I eat it by itself. I put some over some ice cream yesterday.  My next thing will be to try it over pound cake.

Over the years (52) I have made this salad with different fruits and served it with whipped cream.  I usually throw in some nuts for crunch.  I have never tried peach pie filling, but I want to try it. Much better than taking a sweet desert for lunch at church.

Soaking the fruit that has a tendency to go brown in pineapple juice is a great idea! Much better flavor than tossing with lemon juice. Thanks!

This is my new favorite recipe !  I have made it exactly as written each time, and it's pretty perfect as is, but I will agree that it would probably be good with virtually any kind of fruits. I intend to make this year-round, for any occasion (or. like today, for no occasion at all !) Wonderful on a hot summer day !

I couldn't get peach pie filling so used blueberry instead; didn't like the purple hue it gave to the salad although it tasted ok. I like a lighter tasting fruit salad than what the pie filling gave.

I made this dish for my family and my husband, who strongly dislikes pie filling thought it was delicious.  (He still doesn't know the secret ingredient!)  I thought the pie filling would be overwhelming but after adding other fruits, it was a nice glaze without overpowering the dish.

I made this to go with our Chrismas dinner in place of a jello mold and it was wonderful. I followed the recipe as stated (but doubled everything to feed 12 people) and everyone loved it. Very good, not too sweet. Will for sure make again. Thanks for recipe Pattie!

Served at a summer BBQ but just getting around to rating it now. This was well received, but I prefer a fresher fruit salad. I could not find peach filling so I substituted with apple filling.

I made this for my family's Sunday brunch.  I personally though it was slimy, but everyone else liked it. I like the way the pineapple juice kept the bananas and apples from turning brown.  I think for my personal preference, I will use regular can peaches next time.

I gave this 5 stars because it was esay and good.  I made it for a family BBQ last night. One at a time they asked who had made the fruit salad.  They all really liked it.  I did not add the kiwis and I added a couple of cups blueberries.  I would recommend this.

I did not like this recipe. Once you add the canned pie filling, it all tastes artificial. Cooked peaches in a fresh fruit salad...I don't think so!  Use fresh peaches and just sweeten it to taste (using the pineapple juice, if you like).

Very good!  I made this for a baby shower and it was delightful.  The soaking in the pineapple juice really worked well.  The apples and bananas did not start to turn brown until the next day.  The peach pie filling adds a nice flavor and holds it all together!

would actually give this recipe 4/12 stars, because I thought the whole can of pie filling would be too much glaze.  I originally put about 2/3 of the can in and the salad looked great and tasted great, everything was perfectly coated but then at the end I threw the last third and I realized that my original assumption was correct. it was a bit too much glaze but the recipe is delicious overall, the pineapple juice soak on the apples and bananas is pure genuis.  I didn't have kiwi so I threw in halved green grapes and I had some blackberries on hand so I threw in those as well, very very tasty!

The addition of the peach pie filling made the salad almost slimy. I did like the idea of soaking the bananas and apple in pineapple juice. They stayed very white. I also added pear and grapes.

I used one very large organic apple, oranges instead of kiwis, blackberries instead of strawberries, and then added raisins and sprinkled a bit of cinnamon.  This dish was soooo delicious!  It was gone in one day!  I would've used the kiwis and strawberries, but they're not in season; they're summer fruits, but I can't wait to do this again in the summer.  Note to all cooks:  The more different fruits, the better!  It adds extra zing to the fruit salad.

I have to say after reading the reviews I thought this would be really good- but maybe my expectations were too high because I found it to be "okay". I actually would of just preferred the fresh fruit alone without the peach pie filling.

I didn't think the pie filling would work, but it did! My family enjoyed this. If you are planning on serving a while later, add the strawberries and bananas before serving so they don't turn brown. Also, you can substitute grapes ( preferably green) instead of kiwis. Very good!

Delicious!! I thought the peach filling might be too much, but it gave it a perfect glaze. I've made this a few times and make it a little different each time depending on the fruit I have around and every time it's a winner. I think the canned pineapple tastes a little fake with all the fresh fruit so I just use a can of pineapple juice for the bananas and apples and skip the canned pineapple all together.

So delicious!!! Absolutely my new favorite fruit salad! Perfect amount of sweet, with the great taste of the fruit coming through in every yummy bite. My kids went back for seconds and thirds, we all devoured it! But it makes more than 8 servings, which is fine with me, more to enjoy tomorrow! Thankyou for such a scrumptious recipe!

This is the best fruit salad ever. I used a mix of bananas,apples,strawberries,blueberries and green grapes I cut into two pieces. I use Fruit Fresh in my James so I put a teaspoon in a little water,mixed it and swirled the apples and bananas in it so they won't turn dark. I got them out and patted them dry so I didn't add water to the mix. My husband can't get enough of it and I have sent it to several friends. The fruit possibilities are beyond measure.

My daughter in law brought this to a family gathering, and since I have issues with a lot of foods, I was tickled to see fresh fruit and I thought the pie filling made the dish.  I will def add this to my recipe box for future deserts for gatherings.

What we've always done is used frozen strawberries, which provides the same kind of affect as the peach pie filling since they have a lot of liquid. Can't wait to try pie filling instead though!

Love a fruit salad recipe that finds a way to use apples and bananas without them browning.  Plus, I'm not a big melon fan and most fruit salads are mostly melons, so this was great!  I liked how the peach pie filling made the whole salad gooey.

This was AWESOME! I think the idea about tossing the apples (nice touch, adding apples) and banana in the pineapple juice was genius.  It doesn't really add time since you can be slicing and dicing other things as it sits. While recipe searching, I read many using peach pie filling and many that used instant vanilla pudding.  The pudding appealed more to me, and I was very happy with the results.  Also added blueberries.  I gambled by making this the first time for guests, and had nothing but oohs and aahs over the presentation and the taste.  Thank you for sharing, Pattie.

I have been making this for years..just a tip..make sure all fruit iswell drained and really cold..I refrigerate the pie filling and all canned fruit that is going into it, in the can the night before making it..I dip the bananas in lemon juice just to be sure they stay nice and I like the little hint of lemon with them..I never have used kewi fruit but you can add whatever fruit you like..

This was good and very simple. For the most part I followed the recipe. In the begining I put the bananas and apples in a bowl and then poured the pineapple juice over the top and sprinkled some lemon juice on top as well. I let that sit for about 10 minutes. Then I dumped the peaches in my trifle bowl and mixed in the pineapple pieces. Next I put the apples and bananas in WITHOUT the pineapple juice. I mixed that together gently so the bananas didn't get mushy. Then I put 1/2 the strawberries on the top, added seedless red grapes and mixed it around a little more. Last I put the kiwi on top and stuck a few pieces down the sides and sprinkled the remaining strawberries on top as well. It was really good but next time I think I might use fresh pineapple & peaches and not worry about the gel from the peach pie mixture. The canned peaches were not very sweet while the gel was so I felt like if I had used fresh peaches and fresh pineapple it would have made up for the sweetness. However, I would still get a can of pineapple just to use the juice because that kept the bananas and apples didn't turn brown at all even with the salad sitting out all afternoon!

I made this last night for my sons birthday party and was told by several people that it was the best fruit salad they had ever had. I love how you can add whatever type of fruit you want to this dish. I made mine with pineapple, pears. grapes, bananas, and apples. I couldn't find peach pie filling so I used apricot. I am so glad I did. It was awesome. I will be making this again with the apricot filling. It's a keeper.

Very good.  I had to leave out the kiwi (couldn't find any at the store), so in its place I added some blueberries and red grapes.  I think this salad is easily adaptable to whatever fruit you have on hand.

This made a lot, but still managed to disappear fast. The pinapple juice really helps hold the color in the apples and bannana. What a nice surprise!

This salad was excellent.  I made it for our Christmas party.  Everyone wanted to know what the secret ingredient was -- the peach pie filling.  I know I'll be making this again.

I'm sorry to say the peach pie filling makes this fruit salad bad :( I added extra fruit and didn't add the entire can of filling or any of the peaches because as another reviewer noted cooked peaches with fresh fruit really wouldn't be a good combo...the pie filling just made the fruit slimy and I'm glad that I didn't just dump the entire can in. I brought it to a work luncheon and am wishing I would have rinsed the fruit off like I did with the leftovers at home.  Just omit the peach pie filling; your fruit salad will be better without it!

This recipe is very good. I usually make it on Easter Sunday. The peach pie filling adds just enough sweetness to this salad.

This was simple to make and quick, and looked pretty, but the pie filling made it far too sweet for our tastes. Thanks for the idea.

I didn't really care for this.  I don't think the peach pie filling added anything positive.  Surprisingly my husband, who does not like sweet things or canned food, liked it.

The first time I made this I didn't even get to try it. It was for a large group and I was one of the last to go through the food line and there was none left although I more than triple the recipe. The next time I was sure to get some and it was great! I used mandarin oranges and grapes rather than peaches though.

This salad is awesome! I made it today for our friends. It was very easy to make and tasted great at our summer BBQ.  Adding cinnamon to the peach glaze made it even better.  I will continue to use this recipe in the future.

I made this yesterday.  I subsituted the peach pie filling with drained canned peaches because the peach pie filling had high fructose corn syrup in it. I used flavored yogurt for the syrup. It was delicious.  My husband even liked it and he is picky. Thanks.

It's a great recipe, but after going to 3 different stores and not being able to find the canned peach pie, I gave up and just made it without and added some flavored yogurt.

Great fruit salad. I prefer to use fresh fruit in my fruit salads so I omitted the caned fruits. I also added 1 orange and added some fresh squeezed orange juice.

I've made this several times now, and I think it's great!  Use whatever fruits are in season/on hand and add the peach pie filling.  So simple!

However, my husband still prefers the fruit salad his mom always makes: a can of fruit cocktail mixed with cool whip.  Ish.

I guess the pie filling makes this fruit salad so great. I've made this fruit salad twice and both times its been a big hit. Now everyone expects me to bring it during holidays. The funny thing is that I've never even tasted it because I'm not into peaches. But I will keep making it.

Tripled the recipe for a mother's day/dual baby shower(two cousins having girls) .....I was scared of the peach pie filling, but it was awesome.  I used red and green apples, grapes (red and green), strawberries, blueberries, pineapple - everyone loved it. (Peach Pie filling? who would have guessed....) For the amount of people we had to feed...I was sure the banana would go bad...so it was eliminated.

This is a great simple recipe. Soaking the bananas and apples is the best tip  EVER! I usually don't like peach pie filling or canned peaches but in this case it goes very well. It makes the salad very glazed and fresh looking not soggy. I will add blackberrys right before I serve for pretty color.This is the second time I have made this and it does really hold up overnight.

This Fruit Salad is great and always a crowd pleaser. I always make it for special occasions (just made it for Easter). I love it because I can make it the night before and it's yummy the next day. I couldn't find just the peach pie glaze so I used canned peach pie filling and everyone loved the chunks of peaches that came out of the can!

I was hesitant because of the peach pie filling. That sounded odd. BUT, it was delicious. We ran out of room in the fridge after Christmas dinner- so I left it in a bowl outside in the snow. It was even better frozen! This recipe made way more than 8 servings.

Made the Sunday Best Fruit Salad for Thanksgiving.  I added a pack of all the berries the grocery store had left out the bananas as I have an allergic child and it was gobbled up!   The apples in the pineapple juice worked wonders...apples did not change color!  I am making it again for Christmas

I have to confess, I was in a hurry so I didn't really follow the directions perfectly.  I bought several quarts of pre-cut fruit including assorted berries, cantelope, etc.  I forgot the bananas and apples but I did remember the peach pie filling.  In searching for fruit salad recipes, I came upon a version elsewhere where the cook added Limoncello, a lemonie Italian liquor.  It was amazing.

Makes for a pretty fruit salad, but everything tastes like the peach pie filling, even when I double the fruit but just used one can of pie filling.

This salad was a huge hit at my daughters graduation party! I added one small can of mandarin oranges and substituted apricot pie filling for the peach pie filling, as I couldn't find the peach flavor in my local stores. The apricot was awesome and added a touch of tangy-ness to it. It was also a smaller can, which I was concerned about, but it worked out perfectly for the sweetness I wanted. I made the salad "as is" and it was a great size for the party of 12-15. Will definitely make it again.

Amazing recipe!!!!  Made me sad when I read "yellow 5" & "red 40" on the peach pie filling label.  Next time I'll check the natural section for pie filling or make my own.  It was super easy and amazingly delicious!!!!  Great recipe.

Quick and easy recipe for a fruit salad.  I doubled the recipe as another reviewer suggested.  I didn't read any reviews until after I had made the salad.  Next time I would only use 1 can of peach pie filling as was also suggested.

This is a good fruit salad, however I like the fruit salads that are made with sour cream, cream cheese or condensed milk even better, so I won't make this again.

I love this recipe for several reasons... you can make it the day ahead, it lasts several days, has great flavor, and kids and adults love it. I usually make a double batch and don't add bananas bc I am concerned they will brown bc we often eat it over several days. Its a go-to family recipe and potluck recipe for me!

Love this recipe because you can add any fruit combination to adjust for the allergies or tastes of your family or guests.  I also cut the pie filling peaches into smaller pieces.  It is so delicious that I am now asked to bring this to our extended family Thanksgiving and Easter dinners.

This is the same recipe I used when family was growing up,with the exception of pie filling. The recipe I used called for apricot pie filling which is very hard to find. Peach just never cut it for me. Great for any combination of fresh fruits. Does look pretty and is so easy.

It was good, alittle sweet. I think a person could use half or 3/4 the pie filling and it would be about perfect and less calories. 
UPDATE: I've made this many times, it makes such a good side and snack for kids at the library I work at. I agree somewhat with another reviewer that mentioned how canned pineapple isn't nearly as good as fresh. I may try that some time and soak the apple/bananas in lemon juice since I wouldn't have enough pineapple juice if I go with fresh. Also I never use the entire can of pie filling, only about 2/3

It's easy to become skeptical of the peach pie filling but this is a fantastic recipe. I added some mandarin oranges to the salad just because I had some that needed used up. I also added a dash of vanilla, a dash of cinnamon, and a dash of ginger to the peach pie filling. The mix of flavors were amazing! Fruit salad doesn't get better than this. I see myself making this all summer long. Thanks for sharing.

It took me a few days to figure out just what I didn't like about this fruit salad. The peach pie filling made it taste like a canned mixed fruit cup. I had a dinner guest that raved about it, but I am not fond of it. I probably won't make it again.

I served this for a party and made a double batch.  Received a lot of great comments.  A little more cutting up than I thought it would be, but it was worth it.  I finished up the left overs a few days later and it still tasted great!

I was skeptical as I put it together, but I took it to a New Years Day dinner and everyone loved it. It's not fancy but was very good. Will make again.

This had a nice taste to it. I added all the strawberries to it because there was too much filling and I still think I could have added some more fruit. Easy and worth it!!

YUMMY! That's what my whole family raved when they were eating this salad. I cooked a wonderful pot roast and some yeast rolls and put this salad in small ramikins. My whole family went for seconds and thirds. And talk about easy!!! Thank you for our new addition to our Christmas Eve dinner  :)

My whole family really liked this recipe.  The best part?  My 7 y.o. made this by herself with the exception of me coring the strawberries and peeling the kiwi.  We decided not to garnish the salad with the kiwi and strawberries.  My dd just threw it all in the mix. Yum!

Made this for a weekend getaway Sunday breakfast and served with baked oatmeal--it was great!  I too was scared of the peach filling but it was actually the perfect thing to tie everything together!  If it had been summertime I would have done 1 apple and 1 peach--but this was great!

'The best fruit salad ever'.  This was the comment from one of my teenagers who doesnt usually like fruit salad very much.  We added grapes to ours and everyone loved it.  I will be making a large batch to take to our next church supper.  It is definately one we will make again and again!

This was pretty good. I didn't have any peach pie filling, so I used apricot.  I think it might be better with yogurt or whip cream.

I did not use the peaches from the pie filling and used fresh ones instead.  Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, bananas, kiwi, apples, pineapple (from the can) all went so good together. We ate this for two days and it got better every day. I am going to use a peach glaze next time - will update at that time!

This recipe was a big hit at our 4th of July BBQ. I used Granny Smith apples because it sounded like it would be super sweet and the apples did add a nice tartness. Also I added some blueberries since I had them left over from another recipe. This salad has a great flavor and was even better the next day though not as pretty.

I was disappointed, the pie filling makes everything slimy and extra sweet.  Soaking the bananas and apples in the pinapple reserve worked really well, no browning at all.

Used sugar free apple pie filling to avoid the large amounts of corn syrup in regular pie filling.  Excellent.  Tried later for my daughter's school potluck with the peach pie filling.  Also excellent!

This recipe was a hit at a recent cook-out dinner party.  Among other deserts it was the first to be consumed.  Although it is not quite "healthy" with the canned peach syrup, it sure beats the usual selection of cakes.  I added green and red grapes for a bigger variety of fruit.  It displayed well and was delicious.

WOW! I was lookng for a fruit dish to serve as a side for breakfast and this was it!  Our friends and kids all had second helpings and what little was left over, was finished at lunch.  The peach pie filling seemed a little odd at first, but it truly pulled all the flavors together.  Delicious!

Pretty good- I subbed mandarin oranges for the bananas since I don't like 'em. Also didn't "decorate".....just mixed all together. The pie filling makes it all shiny & beautiful!

I really enjoyed this but everyone else for Easter dinner seemed to think it was just OK. My husband commented that it looked slimy.  I guess overall I would prefer it the same as basic fruit salad.  I have to say though that soaking the fruit in the pineapple juice is an excellant trick that I will use from now on.  We soaked all the fruit..the kids had fun with that.

I made this for Easter and it's GREAT! I as well thought that the pie filling would be over the top, but it does make the salad. I added some poppy seeds on top for a little extra decoration.

Was tired of the old Easter fruit salad, so thought I'd try this one.  Everyone loved it, the old one's out, this one's in.  Fantastic and EASY!

This recipe was pretty good. I liked the peach pie filling being in the fruit salad that was a nice added touch.
