I like drumsticks and I like this recipe.  It's a quick fix meal.  I was lucky to have all the ingrediants in my pantry and had enough for leftovers.  The flavor is simple and tasty.   Will do this again and again.

Made as written and this turned out good. Next time I will double the spices but that is the only change I will make. This was super easy to make yet looked like you went to a lot of trouble to make it.

Very tasty and easy.  I doubled the spices as per other commentators.  I don't understand why the instructions would have you apply the oil/garlic/spices in two bowls and then throw them all together into a roasting pan. Seems like a wasted dirty bowl to me.
