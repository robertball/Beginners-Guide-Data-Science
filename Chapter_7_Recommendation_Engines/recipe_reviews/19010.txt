This recipe is fabuolus, but it forgets to mention to peirce the ends of the eclair shells right after removing from the oven to release any steam. This keeps them from getting really soggy on the inside.

These eclairs have become a family favorite and everyone is convinced that I spend hours in the kitchen preparing these!

OK, first of all, these were incredible. I mean, they taste like they came fresh out of a bakery shop. A couple of notes though. First, if you don't have heavy cream or if you're just trying to reduce some of that calorie intake... replace the cream for 2 beaten egg whites (until it forms peaks), and add 1/2 cup confectioners sugar to it (instead of 1/4 cup that is supposed to be added to the cream). Add the vanilla as well. When you are done, fold it into the vanilla pudding and you'll have the perfect eclair filling that is creamy and absolutely divine. My second suggestion has to do with the chocolate glaze. What I got when following the recipe was hardly a glaze, it didn't stick to the eclair and was way too thick. So I added about two tablespoons of milk, 1/4 cup confectioners sugar, and 1 more ounce of chocolate. The glaze I made turned out perfect (and tasted amazing as well). Another suggestion, you should dip the top of the eclair into the chocolate before you cut it open. That way the chocolate is evenly spread over the top, instead of a gunky chocolate mess. Let the chocolate sit for a few minutes before you cut into it, I suggest even putting it into the freezer for a few minutes. That way, when you cut them in half, the chocolate won't get all over the place. All in all, this recipe was a slam dunk. The authenticity of these eclairs was certainly refreshing, and I can guarantee that I will be making these again.

This is a very good recipe, but I made a few modifications: first, I used 1/8 cup conf. sugar  and 1/8cup regular sugar in the filling; second, I piped the filling into the eclairs; third, instead of melting butter and choc, I melted choc in milk, and didn't need any water.  And, because I piped the filling, I was able to dip the eclairs upside down in the chocolate.  YUM.

I have tried many of the eclairs on this site, and this is the best one yet!  I would cut the filling in half, it always makes way too much - or if you make all of it, add some bananas and vanilla wafers to the rest and serve in individual dishes as banana pudding :)

This recipe was great and so easy. It turns out
just like a bakery eclair. You don't need to pipe
the pastry onto the baking sheet, I jast used a
tablespoon and I was very  careful to make them 1 1/2 x 4 inches and they still turned out wonderful
and very pretty. Just what I was looking for.

I love this recipe!  My daughter and I make these often, and people sometimes don't belive they are homemade because they look so good. When we make them we make them smaller and fill them by using a pastry bag instead of cutting them in half, we also use the pastry bag to apply the frosting.

I tried the chocolate topping on a cream puff recipe and it was bitter and gross.  The cream puff was delicious by itself.  I can't recommend the topping to anyone

I did not actually make this recipe, but I used the chocolate icing from it in something else. If you're looking for a great chocolate icing, you can't do better.

The filling was divine. I thought the glaze was grainy.  The pastry itself was very eggy for my tastes, but tasted much better on the the second day, once it was refrigerated. TIP: beat extremely well after each egg and DO NOT open your oven, cook for the ENTIRE time or your eclairs will fall flat. Also, if you are baking these on a cold day the shock of taking them out of the oven can cause the eclairs to fall. On my second batch I let them cool in the oven with the door open. I learned the hard way with my first batch.

I made this for the first time and loved it. A couple suggestions though---DO NOT open the oven to peek in for the first 15 minutes. They will collapse if you do. 2nd, use a mixer to beat the eggs. It is imperative you mix eggs ONE at a time...don't try and rush that step. Third if you don't like the idea of heavy cream just mix light Cool Whip with the vanilla pudding!   (I would have given this 5 stars had the recipe specified poking holes in to keep them from getting soggy and not opening the oven so they don't collapse)

This is a good recipe but one thing i saw that can cause problems is adding the eggs right after taking it off heat. You should put the dough in a mixer with padle and mix until there is no steam coming up. Thats the right way to make the pate a choux (which is used in making eclairs, cream puffs etc.)

Thank you Patty!!  These were absolutely awesome!  People did not believe these were made at home.  I did use a stand mixer for the pastry dough and stirred on low 3-5 minutes to allow steam to escape before adding eggs.  I made them for a crowd, so I used one recipe and piped out 45 mini eclairs.  I'm not that experienced with pastry bags, so I wasn't sure what a "No. 10 or larger" tip looked like, but since I was making mine small it hardly mattered.  I used a pastry bag with no tip at all and just piped about 1 1/2" strips.  Definitely needed two cookie sheets.  For that size I cooked them at 12 minutes at 450, and 15 minutes at 325 - perfect!  For the filling I only had a 3.4 oz. pudding mix, so I cut the milk (used skim) to 2 cups.  Next time I will cut back to maybe 1 3/4 cups.  I piped the filling in using a tip that looked like a thick turkey baster, and poked/piped both ends.  That worked well and used up all but about 1/2 cup of the filling.  For this many eclairs I needed 1 1/2 times the icing.  Don't panic when you add the sugar to the chocolate mix - it will all come together when you add a little water.  I used about 3 Tbsp water for 1 1/2 times the icing.  Make the icing after the shells are filled and work quickly, or it will harden and you have to reheat to soften again.  (Can set the pan on a heating pan on low, covered with a towel.)  Can't wait to have an excuse to make these again!  Tomorrow is MLK Day..... that may be a good enough excuse!  :-)

Never got to taste them, because they came out horribly burnt.  450 degrees is way too hot.

I am flabbergasted at the people who have taken points off of this recipe not for anything having to do with the taste, but that it "dirties a lot of dishes." This is a site for cooking and baking... if you have a problem with dirty dishes, go to your local bakery and just buy your eclairs ready made. Beyond that, this gave me exactly 3 dirty dishes- a non-stick pot that was a snap to clean, and two bowls. I found these to a snap to make- this coming from someone who is getting quite pregnant and not in top form because of that. The pastries puffed up and hallowed out perfectly and the taste was spot-on. I personally prefer a more custardy filling, but this does not lack. Quite a hit!

These were fantastic. I followed the advice to prick a hole in the end of the warm eclair to let the steam out...not sure if it made a difference but why not?   The filling was too runny for me, so I would like to try again with less milk. I actually don't really like the vanilla filling, but my husband loves it so I made it that way. I piped it in which was nice and easy.  Next time I would like to make some and pipe plain whipped cream into it which is the way I grew up eating them. Fantastic easy recipe.   Also, I put the 'dough' in a zip lock bag, cut a corner off about the width of the eclairs and then piped them out onto the cookie sheet - SO EASY.  Thanks for the recipes!!

These eclairs were exceptional!!!!!!  My son works for a company that makes the frozen eclairs you buy in the freezer section of your grocery store, so we have eclairs fairly often.  This recipe beats those eclairs by a long shot.  After you make them the first time, you will understand how easy they really are to make.  Try them, you wont be disappointed.

This is the same recipe that is in my Better Homes and Garden Recipe Book and it works every time!  

My suggestions:  
- Just bake at 400 for about 30 minutes, or goden brown and dry.  
- For the filling, use white chocolate instant pudding and Cool Whip and use pastry bag with long tip to fill rather than cutting off the tips.
- For the chocolate glaze, Mix 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Add 1 teasp vanilla, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup milk. Boil for 1 minute, then set aside to cool. Dip the tops in the glaze, yummy!

you need to know that if you change the scale of the recipe, the directions are messed up (which is why it pays to leave amounts OUT of the directions!)

My default rating is 5 stars, but I took 3 off for various reasons.

The good:  

The pastry itself was awesome.  Wonderful texture.  Definately worth remembering.  I'll be using that part for sure in the future.

The filling.  Wonderful.  Just like the cream in the doughnuts and eclairs from bakeries and doughnut shops.  I love it.

The bad:

The chocolate frosting.  First, I didn't care for it all together, and second, it's not the kind of frosting I like to see on eclairs.  In the future, I'd microwave a can of store bought chocolate frosting and pour it over them.  It's something I used with another recipe and it works very well.  Right taste and texture.

The ugly:

Dirties alot of dishes and measuring cups and such.  Also alot of flour and stuff to wipe up.  Pretty messy.

Overall, the recipe takes more effort than the reward is worth.  There's so much to making these.

I made these today at the hospice where I volunteer. We had a new resident coming in and when I asked her daughter is she has any special favorites, she mentioned eclairs. These turned out really very good although watch your baking time. Mine were done before the time specified. It may be that the oven runs hot, though. Since it's not mine I haven't used an oven thermometer on it. I also got more than 9 eclairs and think they would have been HUGE if I had made only 9. But they are very, very tasty including the filling and the chocolate sauce. If you haven't made pate a choux (eclair dough) before it seems strange but follow the directions and they will amaze you and whoever you share them with. Thanks for a great recipe. Enjoy!

These were easy and very good.  Our neighbor, whose favorite dessert is eclairs, said these were the best thing he'd ever eaten! For the chocolate glaze, I used 3.5 oz. of high quality bittersweet choc., 3 tbsp butter, and kept the rest as is.  I was skeptical of a filling using instant pudding, but with the addition of freshly whipped cream, it was great.

I used this to make la religieuse instead of éclairs, and the dough (pâte à choux) was fantastic!  It puffed up nicely, was a beautiful light golden brown, and it was hollow inside (perfect for swiss buttercream).  I did have to alter the cooking time -- 450 F for 9 minutes, and then 325 F for 25 minutes.  I did not try the custard filling, BUT the dough was to die for! 

I highly recommend the dough for la religieuse, éclairs,  croquembouches, and cream puffs.

I used sugar free pudding and skim milk and it was wonderful. I recommend using a good quality dark chocolate such as Perugina or Lindt.

All I can say is YUM!
Turned out perfectly, I made them to the exact recipe except for taking the advice of one poster and pierced the end of the pastry after baking.  I will make 1/2 the amount of filling next time, it was way too much.
My husband and son were very impressed, thanks.

This was a great recipe.  I'm an experieced baker but had never attempted eclairs before.  Everyone raved about them.  I piped in filling with a pastry bag.  As others mentioned, the filling recipe makes way too much for eclair recipe.  I doubled the eclair recipe and made filling recipe as is and still had a little filling leftover.

First time I have ever made eclairs and they turned out perfect, and very delicious..only thing was it took longer to prepare them than the 15 minutes that the recipe said, what with the dough, filling and chocolate icing.  Well worth the effort though

FABOULOUS!! I hadn't made eclairs in a few years - their always so impressive to people - and really not a lot of work. I did add 1 Tbl.  sugar & 1 tsp. vanilla to the eclair dough. For the filling I used 2 sm. inst. puddings - french vanilla & white chocolate along with 1 c. milk & 2 c. heavy whipping cream - 1 tsp. vanilla & 1/2 tsp. almond extract.  I had to make 2 1/2 X's the recipe for a Valentines party - I put coconut in half of them with some browned coconut on top of the glaze.  If you need to make them the day before as I did - put the hole in the end - let them cool - put them in a zip lock or storage container - closed - and in the refrig. for overnight - premake the fillings (lay a piece of food wrap on the top of the filling so it won't form a filmy layer) and fill the next day---after that they must be stored UNCOVERED or they will get soggy! I used Satiny Chocolate Glaze (from this site) just cause I had the ingreds.

I never thought making eclairs was this easy. I always thought of it as this really hard thing, lol. I gotta say this is my second attempt, last time (about a year ago) was a failure but I wasn't using this recipe (I think). 
Anyways, this is a superb recipe, I recommend it to everyone.

Made this last nite - I usually really appreciate reviews that add suggestions but this time they were making me stress so I decided to follow the ingredients as listed and everything was wonderful.  I did put the filling in with a pastry bag, had just the right amount of filling to fill each eclair generously and it was delicious.  The chocolate topping was a perfect consistency and taste.  Everything was wonderful and easy!

Good recipe but i do think the oven temp on the first was a tad to high i found out that 400 to 425 degrees works much better using the same amount of time....thanks for the Recipe...oh and don't forget you have to use a long wooden stick to pierce the end after coming out of the oven to let steam out..other than that its a good recipe...thanks

Who wouldn't love these? The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly. It was a lot of filling but I piled it on anyway. Also did not get my chocolate thin enough to drizzle on properly - but they were delicious!
I made them again for a family get-together brunch. This time I made them about half sized ( 20 per batch). I also used only 2 cups milk with the pudding to make less of the filling. My brother walked in the house and and straight to the platter of eclairs. People kept going back for them  again and again. They look and taste fabulous! 
For the brubch I made the eclairs the night before and refrigerated them and they held up great and tasted even better than when first prepared.

Husband wanted eclairs for his birthday dessert so I decided to try my hand at making them from scratch.  This recipe is quite easy, and they came out really well. It does require some time to get all the steps in. I followed others idea, and piped the filling in (used a ziplock bag). It was a messy job, but came out good once I got the hang of filling them up. The filling was light tasting and less heavy than a custard I am used to.  My only complaint was the "frosting". It looked fine until I cooled it a bit to frost and then it became less smooth.  Still it tasted great. If I can find a frosting I like better I may do that next time. Fun to make these! Thanks!

These came out perfectly ... (picture to come).  I suggest making one of the pastry cream recipes from this site.  You can pipe a small amount on the bottom and top with piped whipped cream on top before the top is put on.  I have even piped a small bit of raspberry seedless jam down the top of the cream adding a special flavor a la Danish versions!  Anyway you cut or don't cut it, this is a winner.  :)

I made this in an ungreased 13x9 pan.  Once pastry was cooled, I layered the chocolate first, then pudding mixture, then finally topped with whipped cream...for pretiness, chocolate shavings on top.  This dessert was GONE! the reviews are so true, definitely worth trying!

OMG!!! They puffed out so much! =) it ended up looking like hamburger buns! Proportions are a little off: it can probably make 12 eclairs and I have a lot of left over filling. Nomz if you like vanilla pudding or if you have time to make a second batch of pastry puffs.

An "okay" recipe, but not what I was hoping for. The pastry fell and turned out soggy on the inside, and tasted very "eggy". I didn't modify or change any ingredients. Also, I would suggest a simple ganache instead of this chocolate icing. It tasted rather gritty, and took quite a lot of mixing to get out all the lumps from the confectioners sugar.

I have been using this recipe for more than a year now.  I have found some different ways to do them.  First, I make mini-eclairs.  People love the ease of eating at parties.  Then I use a cake decorating gun with long tip to fill these from the end(not cut off the top).  Also, I usually use cool whip to mix with the  (French Vanilla)  pudding instead of making it myself.  Turns out to be a very easy recipe.

These were excellent and very easy to make.  I wanted very small eclairs, so I put the dough into a gallon-size plastic storage bag, cut off a corner and piped them out.  In the end I had more than 20.    I did the same with the chocolate and was able to drizzle the frosting over in a very pretty way.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe caused me a quite large amount of trouble, considering my house almost burnt down.  When i opened the oven, smoke filled my eyes, and worse...my kitchen! I followed the recipe precisely, yet the outcome was atrocious! Before I even got to the second round of heating, the treats were black! Rather than recommending you make this recipe, i recommend you buy éclairs.
PS- I believe this recipe deserves zero stars, I must rate it at least one star...

I made these yummy in the tummy's along with some French Vanilla cream puffs.  What a great pairing!  
This recipe I have no complaints with.  For those that say your pastry keeps falling, sometimes it means you have to stir the pastry faster.  You cannot be slow about it.

This was a very temperamental pastry and maybe it just is my lack of experience, but I had a lot of trouble with this one. The pastry dough didnt come out right the first time and I used another recipe that worked fine. I think you also need to stress that you CANT open up the oven or the eclairs will fall :(. Aside from those things the eclairs were great, but I think they are a lot more trouble than their worth.

I made mini-eclairs and used the Pastry Cream recipe for the filling instead of the pudding mix blend because 1) I didn't have pudding mix on hand and 2) I wanted to try making fresh filling.  The think 450 is probably too high heat for mini-eclairs (1 x 2) as they cooked very quickly on the outside and the inside ended up a little bit mushy.  I think if I was to make mini ones again I would heat at 400 first for about 11-13 minutes and then reduce down to 325 for another 10 minutes or so.  Otherwise, who would've thought eclairs would be so easy to make?  The shell would be good for cream puffs as well.

lost a star because of the chocolate topping didn't work and I had to alter the recipe to make it work.  I melted chocolate chips and added a bit of shortening it worked great and tasted great.  I also let the batter cool a bit before sticking it in my stand mixer and incorporating the eggs (per the traditional method of pate a choux).  I also dipped the eclairs before cutting them open and filling.  The filling is perfect but does make extra (who cares you will want more!)!!!

Easy recipe for eclairs.  I suggest letting the dough cool slightly before adding the eggs.  The filling is okay but I prefer pastry cream (a good recipe is on here)   The fudge topping is awesome.  We used that recipe to cover some bananas and strawberries and as an ice cream topping.  Very yummy.

The pastry came out fabulously.But it does make around 15 eclairs. As another reviewed suggested I only made half the quantity of the cream filling and it was just enough for the 15 eclairs.I also made a choc glaze instead of an icing using milk, chocolate, a tablespoon of butter and heaped tablespoon of icing sugar to sweeten lightly. We're waffling them down!Thanks

These were awesome!  I made the "doughnut" part a little smaller to make more and then used a pastry tube to fill them instead of cutting them open.  I think I was able to fill them fuller that way, though I still had some left over (the filling, by the way, was awesome!).  The icing I let everyone put on themselves.  I served it at a girl's night out party and everyone loved them and were impressed I'd made them myself--I have three little ones at home!  They were a little messy to fill, but totally worth it!

These were sooo good.  I made them for my husband & I and had to take several to my family members to make sure we didn't eat them all in one night.  I don't know how anybody is "spooning" this dough, though.  It is REALLY sticky.  I had to butter my hands and lay the dough out that way.

Didn't work and I discovered why! They didn't puff and rise at all. I found another recipe (Better Homes & Gardens)that had the exact same ingredients, but the instructions tell you to let the dough cool for 10 minutes before adding the eggs. I tried that recipe after my flop with this one, and they worked perfectly. So you must let the butter/water/flour dough cool for 10 minutes before adding the eggs.

These are delicous! But it makes way too much pudding, so double your pastry. Also if you make your pastry dough 4 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide your eclairs are huge. I just made mine about 1×1 and they puff up to the size you'd expect for an eclair.

Great dessert! My only tweak is that I take a plastic drink mixer or any small rod, and pierce one end and "root around" to make space to pipe in the pudding.

This seems to be the same recipe that my mother used to fix for the family.  If we were lucky, she would fix it every other month or so.  Unfortunately, there were a lot of us, so we never got more than one.  I fixed it exactly as the recipe was written.  I found the chocolate frosting to be on the thick side and just thinned it with a tiny bit of milk until it flowed correctly.  The only difference between this recipe and my mother's, is that she would occasionally give us a can of Hershey's chocolate syrup and use that instead of melting the squares.  I like the squares better.

These eclairs were so delicious! They tasted as good as or better than the ones from our favorite bakery. The only change I made was using milk instead of water in the frosting. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

This was really fun for my novice, 12 year old daughter to make since it is quite a simple recipe.  There was way too much filling left over, however, so next time will double the pastry portion of the recipe.  The filling tasted too much like instant pudding so will use a cooked custard next time.  Very good, quick, simple recipe.

I love eclairs filled with vanilla cream and glazed with chocolate. This recipe looks good but I usually prefer to make the cream from scratch without using prepackaged puddings.

My eclairs stuck to my pan, so I would spray the pan or use wax paper next time, but otherwise, I followed others advise and added eggs one at a time in my mixer. After I removed them from the oven I punctured the ends to let steam out as advised by others. I made pudding ahead and refrigerated while eclairs were baking so it was firm. The whipped cream mixture was too thin even when added to pudding. I would decrease the amount of milk drastically. I used 2 cups milk in the pudding and it was too thin when combined with whip cream mixture. I only needed 2 Tbsp. of water in chocolate mixture but it came out the perfect consistency. I would make this again, because the taste was amazing, but  I will alter the filling so thicker. It was easy enough to make, and the timing in the oven for the eclairs  was perfect if followed exactly. Thanks for this great recipe!!

I'm only rating the pastry shell and glaze parts of this recipe, since I filled them with the French cream recipe. It was a very easy dough to make and to handle, and turned out lovely looking eclair shells (my MIL marveled at how pretty they looked) even without a pastry bag. I took a reviewer's advice and baked them at 400, but sadly I think I undercooked them; this could have been the reason for the slightly heavy, eggy texture. They were delicious all the same. The glaze is a very good doughnut type glaze, not what I think of as eclair glaze which in my experience is smoother and lacks the powdered-sugar flavor. It was still tasty though.

I followed the recipe, with the exception of using whole wheat flour. They turned out great! I made my own piping bag with a plastic sandwich bag, and I cut a half in hole in one of the bottom corners and squeezed out the dough. It worked wonderfully! I'd never made whipped cream before, and I did it! With the chocolate topping, I used Nutella instead, which added to the flavor and made it so gooooood!

Not a personal favorite.  My two year old loved these but the rest of us didn't care for these at all. IMO it was the pastry, something about it just wasn't right.  The filling and the chocolate sauce were great however.  I do have to say that these looked decadent and beautiful when plated.

These had a really good flavor. However, I made 9 shells (since the recipe said it makes 9 servings) and each eclair was extremely tiny - probably 3 bites in all. Also, they didn't puff up, and I had to scoop out the insides. One reason I chose this recipe was because it didn't instruct me to scoop out the insides, so I figured I should expect hollowed out shells. I baked them until they were golden and well done, but they still did not hollow. The filling recipe yielded way too much, so I made another batch to use it up and I still could have made two more batches to use up the filling. Overall, I liked the flavor a lot, so with a little tweaking this can be a great recipe.

This was a huge hit at work and home. I nuke the frosting in it's container for 1 minute and pour it on, then spread. Quick, easy, tasty. I have also cut the recipe in half to make a smaller dish.

This was a fun and really great recipe.  I'd never made eclairs before and they turned out wonderful the first time.

The recipe for the eclair pastry was excellent, but why use a prepackaged vanilla pudding for a filling base when it is so easy to make your own??  It tastes so much better and there are no extraneous ingredients that you may not want your family to eat.  I'm not a fanatic, but if I'm going through the effort to pipe out handmade eclairs, I'm going to take the extra handful of minutes to make a proper vanilla cream filling.

The choux was good, but the filling, although quick and easy, didn’t hold its shape when piped into the choux.  Also, I had issues with the icing so I would use your own chocolate icing but the flavor was good.

I think they turned out great. The only thing I changed was that I used chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla, and because I didn't have heavy cream I used whipped cream. I think they turned out pretty good.

No reason to use instant vanilla pudding mix. Crème pâtissière is easy to make and much better! Wanted to give a try to this recipe since the ratings we're good. Yuck, tastes artificial and too sweet :/

This was my first time making eclairs and I baked them with my mom - they're DELICIOUS!  Once you have a bite of one, it's hard to stop!  The only modifications I made were adding 1/4 cup of confectioner's sugar and 1 more ounce of semisweet chocolate to the glaze.  It did dry up pretty quickly but we got all the eclairs glazed and done by the time it did.  They puffed up to be huge, and a few fell, but none were ruined.  In all, this is a great recipe that we're definitely saving to make again!!

These are absolutely delicious!  I have made them for several parties, showers, etc and am always asked what bakery I got them from.  I follow the recipe exactly, with the only exception being finishing technique.  I don't cut the tops off completely; instead I cut them like a sandwich roll, leaving one side attached.  After the shells are filled, I dip the eclairs in the chocolate instead of drizzling it on top.  Comes out amazing, with less wasted chocolate!

Heavenly. Followed to a T. For those saying filling was too runny, your using the wrong size pudding (need 5oz). Absolute. Perfection. Made 18 varied size. First pan was smaller, got the amount needed on the 2nd pan. Used freezer bags to pipe both crust and filling.

These are definitely better after they've sat in the refrigerator over night. I thought they were ok when they were fresh, but the next day, they were amazingly good. Not a lot of work for a big payoff -- I would definitely recommend these!

These were so easy yet impressed a lot of people. I followed the directions exactly and they were delicious. I would have preferred if the cream were a little thicker, it was a little thin and oozed out. Maybe less milk in the pudding mix or allowed the pudding to thicken in the fridge before mixing the whipped cream. The flavor is divine!

I followed this recipe exactly and thought the cream filling was a little too loose.  However, it tasted great.  Also, I spooned the shell (dough) onto a greased cookie sheet with a spoon.  I'll definitely get a piping bag next time.  Thank you.  These were great.

Very good.  Delicious, easy, and not as time consuming as you might think.  Only thing I'll change next time is to use only 2 cups of milk (that's what the box says) rather than the 2.5 that the recipe calls for just so it will be a big thicker.

These are amazing! The only thing I did different from the recipe was I "injected" the eclairs with the cream instead of cutting them.

I was so nervous making these! I didn't really know what I was doing, but they still turned out pretty great. I would have liked a little more direction on how thick to make the batter on the sheet. I obviously used waaaay too much because I ended up with three giant éclaires that survived, and two that were sort of collapsed inside. As well, my filling was a little on the runny side, and I had way too much. However, the runnyness might have been because I had to use soy milk to make the pudding as I didn't have cow's milk, and the excess filling was likely due to the fact that I had only 3 giant éclaires. I think I would still suggest halving the filling recipe, though.

These are fantastic!! There are two tricks to making them though. first be sure to beat dough until the bowl is cooled down a little bit THEN add the eggs one at a time blending VERY well after each one.  The second trick is to poke a hole at the end of them when they come out of the oven. If you dont i find they get soggy inside. OH and the filling is more than enough, you only need about half of what it makes. I started making these about a year ago for my family and boyfriend. i have to make them by request almost every month now.  i always double the recipe and they are gone the same day.

Yumm! These are fun to make. I just used a spoon to place the dough on the baking sheet. I tried the frosting recipe from suz review on 4 of them and it did not work out at all for me. I ended up making my own boiled chocolate frosting/glaze and wow what a difference. I used vanilla pudding and cool whip for the filling since that is what I had on hand. They are so pretty, check out my picture. I am going to make them to take to work for a birthday celebration this week.

These were awesome. Very easy to make, and tasted great. I would have liked for the crust to be a little sweeter, but thats about it. I added some powdered sugar on it and it tasted even better after tham. My family loved it!

These are so yummy, I am only allowed to make these every couple of months. My boys will eat them all in one evening. They are time consuming , but worth the extra effort. I always make the mini eclairs. We are not big chocolate lovers so I dip a fork in the chocolate and drizzle Jackson Pollack style. Yummy.

This recipe is delicious!  Most of the eclairs that you buy in the store are spongy and dry, but these come out light and crisp.  I followed this recipe for the pastry shell and used the pastry cream recipe from allrecipes for the filling, as recommended by another reviewer.  I used white chocolate for the frosting instead of semi-sweet since my husband doesn't like regular chocolate.  Quite the indulgent treat!

I could not believe how good these came out! My house smelled like a bakery. I highly recommend anyone making these to make this filling just as you see it--delicious! I also found it helpful to use a small lightly oiled spatula to shape the dough into little rectangles. The dough is too sticky to shape with your hands.

Sooo good I doubled the recipe and it worked fine. But I had a ton of filling left. I think you can double the dough and the icing but NOT double the filling and get twice as many. I also filled them by inserting a pastry bag tip into the ends and just piping it in instead of cutting them. DELISH!!!!

This recipe was good, but not worth 5 stars.  Yes, the dough is eggy, but it still tastes good. I made 11 eclairs and the recipe calls for 9. Next time, I will make around 20 small eclairs, because they are so rich and huge it is hard to eat a whole one. The chocolate sauce is really a cake icing. I will try to find something thinner and with far less sugar. I didn't have time to make the whipped filling, so I just used a pastry bag and pumped them with pudding. It tasted fine, but I'm sure they would be more delicious with the filling recipe. I would also recommend covering the eclairs with tin foil half-way through the baking process so they don't burn on the top in the oven. All in all, a good eclair recipe.

Very easy to make - a hit at my supper club!  Unlike other reviewers, found the filling to be just enough for the number of pastries.  I used milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet to make the chocolate drizzle.  I will definitely make again!

This recipe is similar to the chocolate eclairs my mother used to make before she passed away.  She found the cream filled ones to be too sweet and substituted instant vanilla pudding.  The first time I made this, I didn't grease the pan well enough and it stuck to the bottom, second time... MMM PERFECTION.  Thanks for the recipe, it brings back wonderful memories.

Terrific. I didn't use much effort spooning the dough out onto the baking sheets & they still looked great.  Something about the unique look of each one really added to the presentation. I ended up doubling the dough, which made about 35, four bite eclairs.  I made the posted amount of filling, which filled all the eclairs & had to double the chocolate recipe as I dipped all the eclairs heavily in chocolate.

For any Tim Horton's lovers out there (mostly Canadians", these turned out similar to a "Boston Cream", but tasted about 8 billion times better.

Anway, I loved these, as did my co-workers who gobbled them up in minutes.

These eclairs were excellent. I doubled the recipe and they came out beautifully. If doubling, I would recommend not doubling the filling - I was stuck with a lot left over.

This recipe is great! I have had so many people tell me they were the best they ever had. I used a different chocolate frosting last time and it was better because the chocolate didn't crack. They taste great.

Ingredients are good, oven temperature was a tad too low and I calibrate accurately and properly . 

I recommend at least 350 for best results.

So this recipe has a couple of flaws. One being that when heating up the water and butter mixture it should never boil until the butter and water have become combined fully. Also the panade mix (water butter flour) should be completely cool before incorperating the eggs, this is so the eggs incorperate into the mix better. Also the ends of the eclairs should be pricked to ensure it does not become a soggy mess

Made these this morning for a brunch and they turned out beautifully.  So much better than other recipes.  However, a couple of notes that I think might be helpful.  First, they were close to burned after the initial fifteen minutes.  450 seems a bit high.  Second, they make a whole lot more than 9.  I made 25 that were medium size.  I would guess they were 1 inch by4 inches.  They texture inside was perfect.  I did not try the chocolate glaze, but filled instead with whipped cream/lemon curd and then topped with a basic powered sugar glaze.  Delicious!

I found if you pipe the pudding mixture straight into the shells without cutting in half and then dip into the chocolate, the overall appearance will look much better.

BEST ECLAIRS EVER!!!!!
These eclairs are AMAZING. I have made these 2 times and both times they have been great. Not only is this recipe easy, but it looks and tastes good too. The things I changed (and you should too) are as follows: Prick a hole in the end of the eclairs when you take them out of the oven, use a real pudding mix or make your own, DO NOT USE INSTANT PUDDING. For filling you can also pipe in custard and straight whipped cream. All the people who have said the topping is not good or the filling is not good, THEY ARE WRONG. This entire recipe is good. My father even said that these eclairs are better then any bakery eclairs he has ever had. I am not only going to make them again but also suggest others use the same recipe too. I am actually about to make these again with a friend. THANK YOU PATTY.

P.S. For all those people who complain because this recipe 'dirties a lot of dishes' it is not correct. you can make this in 2 bowls like I did. If you are afraid of 'dirtying a lot of dishes' , you should then buy eclairs instead.

The eclairs and chocolate topping cake out great! I used the ‘Pastry cream’ recipe from this site for my filling instead, since my husband loves it. My puffs didn’t come out as shiny and pretty as from other patechoux recipes I’ve used, but this one was so simple and the flavor was still spot on! I will definitely be making these again!

The recipe was delicious, but proportions were way off.  My attempt made enough dough for 11 eclairs, enough filling for about 50, and enough topping for 24.

Using a small box of pudding rather than the larger one would have still made plenty of filling.  I did uses a different chocolate for the top.  Great recipe!

The dough went perfectly, until I began baking them. I have made this recipes 5-6 times, and I follow the directions EXACTLY each time. But when I take them out, they are flat, black, and kind of soggy. I tried to make do with what came out, and it just didn't taste good.

If you have any suggestions, or comments, please tell me. Just put:

at the top of the comment. Thanks! I'll keep trying this recipe, with hope that it will soon work!

Delicious! I would double the dough portion bc there's enough filling and chocolate to make twice as many as the dough makes, especially at the measurement of the eclair given. Add more powdered sugar to chocolate icing to get a slightly thicker consistency so it will harden. Filling was delicious! As written, it made 6-8 eclairs.

Made these and my customer loved them. The only changes I made was to add a teaspoon of Vanilla into the dough. and I use French Vanilla pudding. Also I allowed the dough to cool a while before adding the eggs for it seemed that the heat would cook the egg without tempering. He ate 3 eclairs in 5 minutes.

The chocolate frosting was gritty, I wasn't happy with that. I used another recipel for the cream.  I didn't want the fake boxed pudding taste. I will definitely use the pastry recipe again.

Since I have no instant pudding mix (and don't like it). I made the pudding from scratch, including 2 egg yokes.  The remaining egg whites, beaten ( as per other review) conveniently replace the cream.  Made it even more 'from scratch'!

This recipe is spot on!! I did it for my husband's union annal Christmas wrapping party, with a room full of men they were gone before I could walk in the door. Now we are heading to a railroader's open house party/surprise birthday party, he is going to love me for making these again.  I found that drizzling the chocolate on top is much easier and not as messy. Made a double batch this time and already planning to quadrupole for the wrapping party this year.

These turned out delicious with Martha Stewart's pastry cream recipe. Double batter to use up all the pastry cream. Made mini eClair's 1/2 inch by 2 inch in size.  10 minutes or so at high temperature and 20 at low temperature. Check after 5 and 15 minutes to make sure not getting too brown.

These are wonderful.  You can also use the pastry and fill them with shrimp or crab salad for a delightful brunch!   Enjoy!

I'm only rating the pastry. It's flawless (5 stars!!!). Super easy to make, puffes up perfectly, and tastes like eclair supposed to taste (light and a bit eggy). Just perfect! The baking time and the temp are off IMHO. 15 min @450 plus 20 @ 325 is too long and too hot. I baked mine at 325 for 20 min, and they were perfect (you have to know your oven though, mine runs a bit hot). Took them out of the oven immediately, pierced the ends with the toothpick, cooled completely and filled with 'pastry cream' from this site (just don't like pudding taste). Spooned some 'chocolate ganache' (also from this site-super easy and oh so good!)over them. Half of them never even made it to a party!

I have never made or even had a eclair. My husband requested them and boy oh boy!! he loves them! he said they taste exactly like they are supposed to.  i did follow reviewer DONNA advice. i added 1/2 cup powdered sugar for the filling, and used 2tblspn milk and 3 oz. chocolate, and 1/4 cup p. sugar for the topping.  came out beautiful.  i will be buying a pastry filler though.  when you cut the pastry in half it slides and is a lil messy to eat.  I also followed PEGGSTER1973 advice to cut a lil slit on each end of pastry to allow it to cool off and not become soggy inside.  Thanks for all the advice. I want to try this for myself.  
thank you for the recipe.

Incredible!!  Made miniature sized shells and took them to a baby shower.  I got so many compliments- nobody could believe that they didn 't come from a bakery.  Followed the recipe exactly and these were just perfect.  Even got a couple of orders to make for Easter.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Very tasty; the only part I had trouble with was the size, they puffed up too large and were hard to pull apart. If the thickness of the batter were more specific, it would be more informative.

The pastry recipe was wonderful, but I am not sure about the filling.  It tasted great but the pudding wouldn't set properly.  Not really sure what I did wrong except maybe I should make the pudding a day in advance so it can set up before mixing with the cream.  Other than that they tasted wonderful, and was an easy recipe to make.  I was told from my friend who was a baker I would not be able to make the pastry as it was fairly complicated, but haha I did:)

Since I started baking, a friend of mine very subtly told me that eclairs are his favorite. So I decided to make him some for a wedding present. I spent two weeks trying to find the perfect recipe before I finally found this one. Everyone who tried one said they were delicious! Though I wasn't able to getting them looking as pretty as I'd like, I was very pleased with the results. I will keep practicing until I get them looking just right!

I read all the reviews before I decided to try this recipe...there were a lot of reviews with alternate ingredients and it was really confusing. There was one review that said she read them all just like me and decided to try the recipe exactly like it is. That's what I did and it came out wonderful!! My pastry came out nice and golden brown,lite and fluffy. The filling was thick and creamy and tasted great! I didn't have a pastry bag so I just put my pastry dough in a freeze bag and clipped off the end. They came out a.little smaller than they were supposed to but I just.made a few more with the.extra batter. I did poke holes in the.ends with the handle of a wooden spoon to let out the steam.  I also thought the chocolate topping came out.great, love the recipe!

Made according to recipe as much as possible as I cut the serving size to 3.  Will do the 'crust' much differently next time.  Tried to shape it with a knife as one review suggested, but even though they looked good on parchment paper, I wasn't pleased with the boxy look I ended up with.  Next time, I will actually take a gallon freezer bag and put the dough in and squeeze it through.  The filling went fine, but my husband said he preferred the regular custard kind, but  it was a good substitute.  The chocolate I messed up on and put the whole amount of milk instead of water right away.  Won't do that again.  But I put in extra powdered sugar and it turned out OK.  Dipped the top in the chocolate before putting in on the 'custard'.  Had plenty of custard and chocolate left over so I put them together and my daughter ate it as a pudding!

These were wonderful!  I had to try three times because my oven is NOT calabrated correctly and the hight heat burned my first batch, went to low for the second, but on the third try they puffed up just right.  Putting the hole in the end was important so they wouldn't drop.  We piped the filling in not cut in half. The second batch that just didn't puff right we used as lady fingers; layered the left over pudding, then covered with a can of diced peaches.  The Ladies Club get the wonderful Eclairs and the kids ate up the peaches & cream.  For the topping I used milk instead of water and the texture was perfect!  I am making these again for my family and anyone who will share them with us!  Keeper!!!

Salted butter + 1/4 teaspoon of salt was more than enough....

In fact, the dough was way too much salty that even with the cream inside, I could taste the saltiness that came through...

Won't do that recipe again!!!!

I made these for a party they were very good. I could not give 5 stars because I used homemade
vanilla pudding inside. Not from a box. Making pudding takes about 15 to 20 min. at max and
it is delish!

They seriously do taste like they are fresh out of a bakery; the custard is absolutely perfect. Not too sweet or overwhelming, but flavored just right. I did adjust the chocolate ganache according to the top rated reviews because the original was too thick and bitter for my taste. Also, I actually messed up the first step a bit; make sure your butter is really boiling before you add the flour, don't let it cool even for a little bit! Don't forget to poke holes in the eclairs immediately after taking them out of the oven to release the steam--I take this opportunity to dot three holes along the bottom OR two holes, one on each end, using a 1/4 inch piping tip. I use that same piping tip with the custard filling later rather than cutting the eclairs in half because I find this a lot more fun and aesthetically pleasing :) You can feel when the eclair is fully piped with custard because it actually becomes heavier. All in all, easy recipe with impressive presentation--I'll definitely be making them again!

This only gets 4 stars because the chocolate topping was VERY gritty.  If I make these again, I will look for a different recipe for the chocolate.  Otherwise, the filling and pastry part were spot on and very good.  I showed my husband the cookies I made last weekend and he said, 'you want to impress me, make eclairs'.  So I did! He was suitably impressed.  I was surprised how easy it was! I piped the dough using a plastic baggy and clipping off the end.  Same for the filling as I didn't want to slice the tops off. Worked well, but you should really get a proper pastry bag if you want to do it right.

First time ever attempting Eclairs, or any pastry for that matter.  I took the suggestion of one other user and made mine in a bundt pan instead.  Baked good, came perfectly out of the pan.  Sliced it in half, filled with the vanilla filling and topped with chocolate.  So good..so easy!  I didn't have heavy cream for the filling, instead I used the pudding, half and half and added some Cool whip.  I kept the powdered sugar and vanilla the same.  I also used semi sweet chocolate chips, butter, powdered sugar and half and half for the chocolate.   It was a big hit, even the younger kids were wanting more and more..no leftovers. :)

These are very good. I was looking for something for kids and guest that was different and you wouldn't normally see at a party. I made these with a little twist. I put the crust in a mini muffin tin staring the corners. After baked and cooled I filled with a layer of cream, added whip cream then drizzled with chocolate. It was such a sucess. I don't like to rate recipes without trying them as directed. However I made as recipe called I just made them with a twist and added whipped cream. Very good

This is an excellent recipe. As per user suggestions, I dipped the eclairs in the chocolate before filling them. This gave a smooth, unified layer of chocolate across the top. I piped the filling inside without cutting with a size 12 pastry tip. After making two separate batches of these, I found that piping the pastry dough with a size 10 tip creates a perfectly shaped finished eclair. They almost triple in size when they are baking! I piped mine out at about 1" wide and they came out beautiful.

Great recipe for the pastry.  I needed a good recipe so I could use up the rest of the custard I had made for a previous cream puff recipe I had that I didn't like.  This one was great!! Hollow in the middle and just the right amount of crispiness.  I only used 2 large eggs instead of 4 though, but I did't think that would matter much.  I will definitely use this recipe every time I decide to make these.  Thanks!

Way more filling than you'll ever need! But this is truly a "Eclair", just like the bakery. Do what you feel is necessary to thicken the chocolate, it's a little runny. I will make these again and again.

Huge success at a family BBQ.  I took the advice of others and used 425 instead of 450. Also, I made a double batch of pastries and icing, but only a single batch  of filling and it was almost perfectly proportioned.  Very easy to make and will be a part of my regular rotation for events.

I made the filling by adding instants coffee to milk before adding it to instant french vanilla pudding.  I dipped in canned caramel frosting that I thinned by heating in the microwave.  Tasted like a caramel coffee drink.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at eclairs, they turned out perfect! I used the "pastry cream" recipe (which was delicious) on this website instead for the filling because I didn't have any instant pudding. They were so soft on the inside, I actually thought that they weren't cooking all the way through because they were so soft. But I'm glad they were so soft because they were so delicious! I'll definitely be making these again!

These were fun and easy to make!  They came out better than expected!  I ended up with 10 eclairs, a lot of extra cream and not quite enough chocolate to cover the 10th eclair.  I made these for Valentine's Day but our dinner party was rescheduled so I ended up putting them in the freezer.  After being frozen for a few days, they defrosted on the counter for about 3 hours and were perfect!

I've never made eclairs before since it seems like it would be complicated.  This recipe is so easy and turns out really good!  I did use a large zip-lock bag to pipe the dough and the filling.  The process is a bit time consuming, but easy and well worth it!!

This was a perfect recipe! It's easy to follow. I used bitter baking chocolate instaed of the semisweet to help cut down the over sweetness of the eclairs. I also used whipped topping instead of the cream. Turned out excellent.

These eclairs were okay, but they were not the greatest elcairs I've ever had. These kind of reminded me of donuts with a vanilla pudding filling. When I think of an eclair, I don't think of vanilla pudding. I think that's the main thing that made these a bit of a disappointment for me. I think of eclair filling as being more light and fluffy, like whipped cream (something Cool Whip based would work well, I think), and NOT tasting so strongly of vanilla. The filling was just too heavy for me. I also felt the shell could have been a bit lighter and fluffier. I may make these again, but I would probably look for ways to improve the existing recipe.

These were pretty simple to do and really good. My only problem with it is if you don't plan on eating them all right away you shouldn't add the pudding in it right away or it will get really soggy. Also I made a hole on the side of all the puffs so they don't get soggy while cooling. I made about 24 and they were pretty big, a few big bites. I can't imagine how big 9 would be. I didn't have a pipping bag so I used 2 soup spoons and they worked out great. Delish though and I will make again and only stuff as I'm eating them.

this recipe is amazing.instead of using vanilla pudding, I put in butterscotch in one batch and chocolate in another. then when I drizzled the chocolate over the top, I added some chopped nuts while the chocolate was still warm. all my friends ask me to make them whenever we have a party, and they are a major favorite!

At first when I glanced over the recipe I thought this would be difficult to make. But it was actually sooo easy; didn't mess up my kitchen too much and good, precise directions. The only complaint was the pastry shell- definitely too eggy. Other than that, great recipe!

Delicious! These were so fun to make because the technique for making the dough seemed very sophisticated, but it was so simple! Worked great, as other said, there's TONS of left over filling. It should be noted that the egg flavor of the dough comes off very strong. Still a 5 star recipe.  My boyfriend and I ate these while snuggled near the fire place. The contrast of the cold pastry and the warm fire was perfect!

The taste was 5 star, but they dirty a lot of dishes and make a mess. Also the frosting wasnt right...I melted the choc. and butter, then added about 1/4 xxxsugar and knew that 1 cup would be too much. I wound up adding a bit of cream to thin it enough to drizzle.

The best!  I used half the recipe for eclairs and the rest for rounds and made vanilla and chocalate filling and let the sause cool a bit to thicken for a thicker coating.  I piped the filling with a star tip.  This not only looked wonderful but was right on!  Thank you!!!  Made these for TG and they were gone before I knew it!!! This recipe is a do it again and again.  This recipe will be on my to do list whenever I have company :) 10 stars!

Easy to prepare, but takes some time.  Everyone really loved them.  Made them again, and this time used puff pantry instead of making the dough on this recipe.

These were fantastic!  I piped the filling into the eclairs and dipped them in chocolate as suggested by another reviewer.  They turned out perfectly and received rave reviews.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm not actually rating the eclairs, just the chocolate sauce. I used it with cream puff cake (from this site). It was easy to make and much better than canned frosting. However, it is very sweet and I will definitely decrease the powdered sugar to 1/2 or 3/4 cup next time I use this.

Whipped up the eclair itself in an hour or two, simple to make the dough and worth the hassle of piping them full of creme. I recommend using boston creme instead of pudding, and removing them from the pan as soon as they come out of the oven; a few of mine stuck.

The pastry was a hit. We changed the filling to a richer vanilla custard, and used unsweetened chocolate for the icing to mute the sweetness. It was a hit!

I may have done something wrong, but I used a large enough pastry tip and my eclairs were still tiny. But they tasted great.

I gave it 4 stars because mine came out flat so I couldn't fill them. The recipe doesn't explain how to make them "puffy" so I was at a loss on how to do that. But flavor wise is a 5 star.

Excellent eclairs.  I piped them on to parchment so they would not burn.  When they finished turn oven off and leave door open to cool.  I also poked hole in one end to let steam out.  Only adjustment was to use only 1 1/2 c milk instead of 2 with instant pudding, after letting it set a bit added the whipped cream and it was perfect.

Absolutely amazing!!! I am not a huge baker but decided to try these for my airman heading to a deployment soon. Followed the directions and poked holes right after coming out of oven. They are absolutely incredible!! I didn’t have a pastry bag so snipped a ziplock baggie. Came out more than perfect! A new family fave!!!!!

I used Hershey's spread by warming it up an drizzle on the eclair.  It's critical to poke holes right out of the oven. Marvelous! Husband already requested me to make it again.

I think the recipe definitely gets 5 stars, but my cooking gets one if that. I messed up somehow and my dough or whatever is the right term did not rise, stayed totally flat on the cooking sheet, releasing a lot of grease and the ends burnt. I thought I followed the directions correctly, but if anyone reading this comment knows what I did wrong can you reply if possible. My guy absolutely loves eclairs and I'm trying to learn how to make them but this was an epic fail on my part.

This recipe is AWFUL. It is the worst I've ever made. The dough was way too thick as if you were making churros. This is not a good eclair recipe. When you cook the dough they come out completely flat and still very doughy after the 20 minutes. I cooked them an additional 20 minutes at 170 C and still flat and doughy.  I even poked holes with a knife at the ends of each eclair to try to help allow heat and air in. I followed the instructions EXACTLY and these turned out DISGUSTING. The pastry is bad. The chocolate topping is bad. The filling tastes okay, but it is not right either. I do not recommend this recipe to anyone who wants an authentic eclair.

I only used this recipe for the pastry. Fantastic pastry recipe and easy to follow instructions. I made a from scratch creme patisserie for my filling and I used a different recipe for the chocolate glaze. Dipped in the chocolate and then popped in the freezer for a few minutes. made holes On the end closer to the top and piped my filling in, much neater and easier to work with. Perfection

The eclair it’s self was great! The chocolate topping was not. I would make these again but use a different topping recipe or maybe even just a tub of store bought frosting.

This was the first time I had ever attempt eclairs.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and my family couldn’t believe I had made them because they looked like they were bought from a bakery!  They were light and airy, the chocolate was tasty and shiny on top and the filling was creamy and delicious.  I cut mine in half and spooned in the filling.  The only problem I had was too much filling left over.  I think I may half it next time.

I doubled the recipe. Super easy to make. I would add a note that is not in the directions, you need to let the dough cool a little before adding the eggs 1 at a time, because if too hot it will cook the egg. I was always taught to put it in the mixer and turn it on and when I could touch the side of the bowl and leave my hand there I could start adding the egg.

This was my first time making eclairs and choux pastry in general. The only changes I made were to switch out half a cup of the water for have a cup of milk. I also added about 3/4 cups of fresh strawberry purée to the cream filling and only put into cups of milk instead of 2 1/2. It was heavenly. I also had to use a star tip to pipe the eclairs as my rounded tip was far too small - however I think this turned out in my favour as this seemed to minimize the cracking of the dough while baking. I will definitely be trying this recipe again with other flavors!

I will be making this again, but I'll need to make sure I bake the pastry for the full amount of time; and I'll also need to beat the whipping cream longer, to the point of stiffer peaks rather than softer peaks. I took the pastry out earlier than I should have, worrying that I would over bake them. I think this is definitely one recipe to err on the over baking, rather than under baking. The recipe said to beat the whipping cream to soft peaks, but again, I think it's better to err on having stiffer peaks, rather than softer peaks. I'd like my filling to be firmer next time around. As far as the icing, I didn't make the icing that was on this recipe. I just made my own chocolate icing which consist of  butter, salt, vanilla, powdered sugar, cocoa powder and milk. A nice thick, sweet frosting. I found it was easy to frost them by holding the cut  top, and putting a big dollop of frosting on it, then spread it to the sides. You can extend it onto the other half of the shell if you would like, once the cap is back on. I also pierced the pastry once out of the oven. And like others had mentioned, they are even better if you take the time to refrigerate them.

First time made these it was a fail.  The pastry didn't raise in the oven. But the filling and icing were amazing. So I had to try again. And they were perfect.  I used a plastic bag to pipe the dough onto the cookie sheet. Sliced them in half to fill as directed then sort of dragged the icing down the tops with a spoon. So good!!! I will make them again and again!!!

This was our first time making eclairs (with my 10yr old son) and they were delish!!! We ended up doubling the whip cream in the filling (& added extra vanilla cuz I love vanilla), which was great! Only complaint is that the pastry cream wasn't quite thick enough, so it oozed out and made a mess, but boy did it taste amazing. May try to make our own pastry cream next time.

Great recipe. Turned out very well. Being a beginner, I got confused about the filling portion of the recipe where it told me combine pudding mix and milk in medium bowl according to package directions. I appears that I was supposed to bring this mix to a boil to get it to thicken. Fortunately, my daughter came to the rescue when the resulting filling was much too liquid and it became perfect after heating it up.

Very good recipe! Easy to follow and make.
Changes that I did:
Pastry cream instead of the filling. Making a pastry cream is very easy I just found out. I made a recipe from this site and it was yummy!
Chocolate icing:
Make sure yours is nice and liquidy. I've seen people make eclairs with chocolate mush, add the water 1 tbs at a time and stir to the perfect consistency.
Dough:
I wasn't too thrilled with the #10 tip, I ended up using a larger star one, they were still awfully small. 
Time: 
I did the full 15 min at 425, but only about 15 at 325. Too long and they were getting too hard.

This was my first attempt at making eclairs and they turned out great. The cream filling was just a slight bit runny but that was probably because it was my first time. I did make homemade vanilla pudding instead of the box which may have also caused it. Either way they were good. The chocolate topping was amazing and tasted like fudge. My family loved them

They came out great but you have to be sure not to take them out of the oven before you  change the temp. or else they will fall. I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who would like to try. They were delicious and fairly easy to make.

The pastry turned out soft and choux-like in the middle.  I suggest the butter should be added a little at a time, and the pastry should be poked in the ends after baking, to allow the air to escape.  (This is what likely made the inside seem too soft). 

I know these seem tiny details, but with baking these pastries, it makes a big difference.

Turned out AMAZING, but I did change a little (hence the 4 stars)
Instead of 4 eggs, I added 3. And instead of the chocolate topping, I spread some store bought chocolate frosting (had it in the cabinet, figured why not, right?). Turned out perfect.
IMPORTANT TIP: Pierce the shells after they come out of the oven!! And double the dough recipe. The pudding amount nearly doubled the amount I could use for the shells.

Good, overall.
The pastry needed some sugar.
The filling was good, but some tapioca starch sure didn't hurt so that the consistency would allow for extra stuffing without the finished product bleeding and leaking all over the place.
The topping needed some help.  I'd use cream instead of water.  Also, cut back on the sugar depending upon the sweetness of the chocolate used.

This was much easier to make than I expected.  I made small 2" eclairs and the first batch didn't bake long enough because I was worried about them getting dry.  They ended up falling and were a bit doughy.  My second tray baked up nicely.  The filling was delicious and creamy.  I was a bit disappointed with the chocolate sauce.  It turned out very gritty.  I'm not sure if it was the chocolate or my own error, but I threw it out and made a simple ganache to drizzle on top.  They all disappeared quickly and I'm making another batch soon.

I love this recipe! I made them bite size for a presentation I was doing on France and people came back begging for more. It is so simple yet delicious. I have tried almost all the eclairs recipes I have found and this is by far the best. It has an amazing texture and flavor. I highly reccomend making this

These looked great, and tasted even better! I suggest putting the glaze into the fridge for about five minutes to let it get more firm, and not slide off of the pastry as much! Overall wonderful recipe

this recipe is fabulous.  I have made it several times and the only thing I do differently is that I pip in the filling.  The chocolate I drip on top in a nice design,  and the chocolate taste fabulous...even though someone said it didn't that it was bitter, it wasn't bitter in the least.

The real deal! My husband doesn't have much of a sweet tooth but loves eclairs. He really enjoyed having these instead of a cake on his birthday. Tastes better than the bakery.

Over all the eclair, was easy and addicting to eat. It was a easy step-by-step instructions that my young daughter and I could follow. She claims its even better then the ones from the nearby bakery. Although I have to say the chocolate was clumpy and hard to spread. I added more water, but it seemed to do no good.

Thanks for a great recipe and after reading the reviews I too adjusted the amount of milk to 2 cups in filling and still had lots left. I wanted to pipe the filling but did not have a pastry bag/tips so used a turkey infuser- worked great- just filled thru both holes that I pierced to let steam out. Thanks to all for tips, i' m sure that led to my success

I really liked the eclairs themselves. Except I made a mistake and scooped and shaped them with a spatula onto the baking sheet, rather than piped them so they came out very weirdly shaped. BUT, they still hollowed out perfectly and they tasted great! I followed earlier suggestions NOT to open the oven for the entire time until done and also to add the eggs carefully, only beating in one egg at a time.

The chocolate icing on the other hand - worst recipe I have ever used. The icing dried up way too fast and wouldn't even stick to the eclairs on their own (I tried to dip them in the chocolate for easy application).

These eclairs were sensational! All of my siblings loved them. The only thing that I didn't like was the filling. Using pudding mix makes it really watery. So to make it more firm, make the filling a day before you make the eclairs. Trust me, it works. ~Baker101

I loved these and I will add two notes. first, your eclairs might look done but they need to cook throughout so don't be shy with the cooking time. second,the chocolate could be improvise by making it thicker

I followed this recipe exactly; however, I did follow a few tips left by others.  I DID NOT open the oven door while the eclairs were baking, especially when I changed the temperature of the oven.  I used the back of a wooden spoon to pierce the ends of the eclair shells as soon as they came out of the oven and piped in the filling once they had cooled completely.  I also dipped the tops of the eclairs in the chocolate while it was still warm in the pan rather than drizzling it on.  They turned out PERFECT and SO DELICIOUS!!

These eclairs are the best. The only issue I had was I spponed too much of the dough for some of the eclairs and because of that some came out too big. Other than that, these were absolutely delicious. I do think this recipe can yieled more than 9 eclairs.

I have made this recipe several times.  I enjoy baking but do not want to have all the goodies at home, so I increased this recipe to 26 servings and took a couple of trays to our friends at Town Chrysler in Wenatchee, WA. "I got great reviews from them"

DO NOT let the negative review stop you from making this wonderful dessert. I am not a good baker, and so I was worried especially during the baking process. The baking instruction/time as described in the recipe is perfect. I have no idea why the negative reviewers' oven will catch on fire etc. Maybe they didn't reduce the temperature to 325 after 15 minutes. The only thing I changed was the sugar amount but this is only as a matter of personal taste.

I am not one to usually write review but these are delicious! I kept my icing a little thicker and spread it on top of the eclairs in a pastry bag. I took some to my mother in law who suggest I make these for an upcoming bridal shower! They looked beautiful and tasted delicious!

These were delicious! I used just regular whipping cream instead of heavy because that's what I had on hand and I also just used two spoons to place them on the cookie sheet. Everyone LOVED them!

I used cook and serve vanilla pudding cooled, and piped it in.for the choc.icing I asked my supermarket bakery for a little container of the choc.icing they put on the donuts. You just heat it in the microwave a minute or two, stir it and dip the eclair in it . It's just like from a bakery!!

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  My husband and I loved them.  I use to buy eclairs (just like these) from a bakery in a small town about 20 miles from home.  Now I don't need to travel to get these yummy treats.   I made them for my husband's 52nd birthday and he (and I) loved them!

I gave this 5 stars because of how AMAZING they tasted! But it took me at least 2 hours to make them. Ive never made eclairs before and i had no idea wat was right and wrong. I made smaller ones, it made about 18. i would suggest piping the cream into the eclairs rather than cutting them. it just look a lot nicer and is less messy to eat. This was a very messy baking process also. But overall, really really amazing! better than store-bought!

This is the best recipe ever!  I have been making it for several years and am always asked to make these for parties.  I follow the recipe exactly as directed, except I make them into cream puffs using a pastry bag to create the puffs.  

The favorite part for most people seems to be the filling.  It's perfect - not too light and not too heavy.   Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!  I wouldn't change a thing about it.

Pretty good recipe.  Followed recipe exactly as is. Everybody in the household loved them and asks me often to make them again.  I thought they had a bit of an aftertaste that I wasn't crazy about, but overall they were good.

Great and easy enough for the non-professional baker!  The only thing I would change is adding more chocolate on top.  Fantastic recipe!

I made these at work - only had a convection oven to work with so I think that was problem getting them to raise well....  but they tasted awesome!  Got great feedback from everyone that tried them.

I'm having some problem with the batter for the shells. It's not thick enough and it doesn't stay in place when I place it on the baking sheets and it also doesnt rise. I made it once before, this recipe, but I can't remember how I made it. I followed the steps carefully but it still didn't turn out thick enough.

Awesome recipe, I've been craving chocolate eclairs so I got some from a local bakery that typically makes very good eclairs which were horrible this time so I decided to make my own....I will never buy eclairs again. The only change I made is using chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. Also I think the filling portion was way too much for this batch size, but my kids didnt mind eating the leftovers :)

This is a great, simple recipe that I've been using for years. I use the choux pastry as a base and change up the fillings and toppings. My family's favorite eclairs are filled w/ pistachio creme & topped with white chocolate & pistachios. Thanks for this wonderful recipe Patty!

The pastry is perfect.  But when I make these, I always opt for a homemade pastry cream, which is why I deducted one star.

Very good recipe, but the proportions of filling to shells seems a little off. I ended up making a double batch of shells for a single batch of filling. Also, don't forget to poke holes in the shells when they come out, and make sure they are cooked all the way through for the best texture.

great recipe! the shells were perfect. before adding the eggs, i put the dough into the kitchenaid and mix it to allow the steam to escape so as not to cook the eggs. i also wanted a more hearty pudding so i only used a 3.9 oz pudding box, 2 cups milk, and added 8oz cream cheese (whipped).  instead of cutting the tops off, i poked the shells with a knife sharpener to hollow them out then put the pudding mixture in a pastry bag and piped it in. delicious!

Lovely recipe! I've never made eclairs before so I was a bit concerned about how moist the dough was, but it turned out great! I did follow other reviews and used a mixer for the dough. Then for the fill I used an instant pack of vanilla pudding and half a pack of frozen whipped dressing ( there was too much filling so I'll cut it in half next time I'm making it, luckily I had graham crackers and chocolate  glaze left so I made an eclair inspired no bake cake) . Anyhow , I did read many reviews with conflicting advices about the glaze so I came up with my own simple version. A little milk, a little semi sweet chocolate chips and a good bar of milk chocolate ( I used Lindt). It was superb! Thanks for the recipe, my boyfriend agrees that it's a lot better than store bought.

Wow!  Dropped by spoonful, it worked great.  Pipped with filling.  Made a chocolate ganache for the top using 1 c. cream and 1c. bittersweet chips.  Would probably use semi-sweet chips next time.

I made these eclairs for a ladies getogether and they turned out delicious!  I am not much of a baker, so I felt I might be a little out of my league preparing these.  However, I followed the instructions exactly as listed, and the eclairs turned out perfect and so delicious.  Was worried, living in Colorado, that I might need to add more flour to pastry recipe, but I did not add it and they turned out perfect.  Thank you for a wonderful dessert recipe!  No question that I will make these again.  BTW, I also had a lot of left-over filling, so I really piled it in the pastries.  They were decadant that way, but I made sure the cream did not spill out and create a messy dessert for my guests.  The left-over filling became a special dessert for my three little boys the next day.  Stored well in fridge overnight and I served in three little bowls and put strawberries and blueberries on top.  They loved it (and so did I)!

This was really good.  I did change the icing though.  I made the chocolate glaze as directed, but it didn't taste quite good enough.  I added some store bought milk chocolate cake icing, and it was perfect.

This is a great recipe!  My only complaint would have been that they got soggy after coming out of the oven....next time I will cook them longer and try poking them to let the steam out when they are out of the oven.

These were easy to make and incredibly delicious.  I made them for Mother's Day and they we had our meal.  The only thing I didn't like was all the leftover filling I had, the recipe calls for way too much and I had to throw half of it away.  Other than that, these eclairs were a total hit.

While I admit that the first time I made these, they went over great even with the provided frosting.  I generaly cook the shells, let them cool, pierce one (or both) sides with a  knife and fill them with a pastry bag.  I do use a different frosting now, but even with what's provided, it's hard to go wrong.

Fantastic! I didn't have instant pudding but pudding cups. I emptied a couple and mixed it with Coolwhip and icing sugar. Turned out great. Got rave reviews from my mom and husband. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks!

Delicious!  In my oven I had to turn the heat down to about 400 to start them out, they were about to burn on the bottom.  It was the fault of my oven though, not the recipe!  I had misplaced my recipe and I am so glad I found this one.  Thanks for sharing it.

This recipe is excellent. It is excactly what you think it will be. I had to much filling and will have to make more to use it up, also make sure you use the larger box of pudding. I spooned the dough on a cookie sheet and added a little bit of cinnamon so not to taste to eggy. The topping is perfect too.

These were so good. The recipe made a ton but they were all devoured. They were surprisingly easy to make too. Definitely will make these again!!

DELICIOUS!!  100 stars :)  So easy....had I found this recipe when I was pregnant with our 3rd child, I would have saved my hubby NUMEROUS trips to the bakery ;)  We honestly could not tell the difference between these eclairs and the bakery purchased.  I doubled the recipe...growing boys (and hubby) and used 2 small boxes of pudding for the filling.... so not double filling, but this was the perfect amount for us.  Will make these again and again!  Can't wait to take to family gatherings.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I have baked them a couple of times, but it seem as if the egg taste is just there...other than that, it is amazing!!!

I've never made eclairs before, but I had chocolate pudding on hand, company coming over, and a little one asleep upstairs, so no trip to the store. I made the pastry just as the recipe says, and just used the chocolate pudding as the filling. It was super easy, fast, and was a huge hit! Everyone thought I had bought them!!

Fabulous! These were so easy to make!!!  My husband absolutely didn't believe me when I told him I made them and I had to show him the recipe to convince him otherwise!

I had to try twice to get the dough right. The first time I piped it out and made them too thin and they didn't puff up enough. I find it hard to get the size right, mine were huge! The filling is great. My husband is coming home from serving overseas soon and I can't wait to make these for him!

This recipe is great!  It worked out perfectly.  The eclairs puffed up well, and the filling was super good.  I used milk chocolate chips for the icing instead of bittersweet, didn't have it on hand.  They were the highlight of the dinner party!  I will definitely make this again - even my super picky husband liked them.  He said they were the best ones he's ever tasted.

this was SOO good!!. i read all the great ratings and was hoping it was as good as people made it out to be.  it does make a little too much filling though, i had about a bowl amount leftover.  
i don't really understand why some people don't like the chocolate sauce..i thought it was really great, it went really well with the whole thing. 
they were easy to make as well.  
i actually liked these better than store bought and will definitly be making them again, they were gone so fast!.

Very time consuming, but it is worth all the trouble. The end result was tasty and beautiful enough to be at an upscale bakery, and I'm not a very experienced baker. The whole family loved it, and my sister joked that she wants me to make them every week. This would be a good dessert if you had people to impress. The only note is to cut the vanilla filling portion in half, or you'll be stuck with a big bowl of pudding.

When I was spooning the pastry onto the baking sheet, my boyfriend asked "What are you making?  Blobs of yellow goo?"  I was a little skeptical at first but I was delighted to see the "blobs" puff to be light, airy cream puffs.  These were really good.
