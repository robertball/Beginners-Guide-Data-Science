This stew is delicious, but I did alter it some to make it thicker and to adjust to my family's taste. The recipe didn't specify how much butter to use, so I used a 1/4 c and sauteed chopped onion, celery (with leaves)and 2 cloves minced garlic.  When the onions were translucent, I stirred in a 1/2 c. of flour and then added 1/2c. white wine and 5 1/2 c. chicken broth stirring with a whisk and had no problem with a thin broth.  I also used fresh chopped carrots and potatoes and frozen corn and beans and cooked all in the stew until softened - adding peas and chopped parsley at the end.  Loved the basil.  Can't wait to serve this again with either dumplings, biscuits or homemade bread.  Very good and filling which makes it a winner at our house.  Thank you!

My family really enjoyed this stew!! I made it for a large 9" X 13" chicken pot pie, and it was very good!! I just omitted the mushrooms. But it is excellent for a larger size pot pie, which is something I have been looking for for a long time. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.

This is a great stew.  Cooking everything separately however, seemed too much like work.  I made this a one pot wonder.  I browned the chicken, then took it out and added the veggies.  I cooked those until soft, added the potatoes, which I left raw and put chicken back in.  Then I added the flour to make a roux from the oil and added the broth and seasonings.   I let the stew cook till the potatoes were done.   I still, like others, found the broth too thin so I thickened it with some corn starch and water.   Great recipe!

It is finally fall in DC and the last couple of days have been windy and perfectly autumn! So what does that mean??? Time to bring out the warm and flavor filled soups and stews! I was craving a thick hearty stew and I completely found it in this recipe! As always,I deviated from the recipe, but in essence, they are the same! I love onions and garlic, so I doubled the amount within. I also added zucchini and greenbeans to the recipe. For the seasonings, I substituted sage for oregano, thyme, rosemary, and Adobo. I sauteed the chicken with Adobo, poultry seasoning, and italian seasoning blend. I added a little bit of flour to thicken the consistency and VOILA! a delicious soup that my friends could not help but taste. I highly recommend this recipe for those windy, wonderful fall days....Enjoy!!!

I used corn starch mixed in cold water to thicken-about 3 tbspns. That took away any flour taste. Also used dry chicken bouillon and  dry tomato bouillon for flavor-about 2 cubes each. Left out the salt.

Good conventional stew. No surprises. I used a left-over carcass (Oh! That sounds gross..) with lots of breast meat as well as some dark.  Cooked all of the vegetables together, then added the chicken and stock.  It was very hearty and good.  Mixed up and added some dumplings as it simmered. I found that a couple of Tbsp of Worcestershire perked it up, and, of course, salt and ground pepper.  Good recipe; when it is cooked, take out a cupful and experiment with some spices and condiments to make it exciting.  Expect praise.

Easy dinner....made a few changes to suit our tastes and it turned out good....it didn't thicken as much as I hoped though. 3 and a half stars. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband wasn't too sure when I told him what we were having but he changed his tune once he started eating it.  I topped with dumplings, to make it more like a chicken pot pie.  The stew didn't thicken like I thought it should and my husband thought it should taste more "stewy" (Whatever that means.)  I thought it was good.  I didn't have all the veggies on hand, so I substituted all the veggies for 3 cups of frozen veggies.  I also slow-cooked it all day and it turned out very good.

This was soooo yummy! I left out the frozen veggies and four but added fresh ingredients (green beans, carrots, celery, onion), rotisserie chicken, and kept it brothy. At the end I threw in sliced mushrooms and fresh baby spinach! Wow, soooo good, the whole family loved this (even the child that does NOT do spinach).

Very good, hearty stew.  I did have to add about 3x the amount of flour to get it to thicken up.  Also, instead of dirtying multiple pans to cook the chicken & onions, I just put oil in the pot along with a pressed clove of garlic to cook the chicken, then added onions to sauté.  From there I added the rest as instructed, (except I used raw potato) and simmered everything for 1 1/2 hours and served over rice. A very quick and easy meal to prepare.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe, although it was a pretty hardy stew, it just didn't seem to have enough flavor for me and my family.

I thought the flavour of this stew was great. But it turned out to be more like a soup than stew.  It didn't thicken when I added the flour and I didn't want to keep adding it, so just ate it the way it turned out.

Delicious and very easy to make! I adapted it to the ingredients I had at home (no mushrooms or celery, less carrots) and I also substituted 2 cups of water for beer. It gave a really nice taste to the sauce!  I'll definitely make this again someday.

This was a very good recipe. Will definitely make it again and again. I did not have dried sage so I used Thyme after researching that it could be used as an ideal substitute.

This turned out exceptional! I did modify it to meet my low sodium diet due to heart failure. I followed the directions exactly except using 32oz low sodium chicken broth, 2 cups of water and 2 tsp low-sodium chicken granules. Followed everything else as directed and it came out perfect. Very tasty, and low in sodium.

I did modify the recipe quite a bit to a longer prep time, however. Sauteed the onion, celery and mushrooms with real garlic in butter with 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning and 2 teaspoons herbs de provence. Then added the diced chicken and 2 cups white white - simmer for at least an hour until it starts to boil down. At this point, you can continue with the recipe as is, or add some stock and cook down again before adding other ingredients. If you like that "French" taste, you'll love this!!

Here is how I made it!!  I cut a very large chicken breast into 3/4" cubes.  Seasoned well with salt and black pepper.  Put 1/2 cup of flour in a bag and added chicken.  Shake well.  Put a little oil (1/4 cup or less) in bottom of a large pot.  Heated oil and added all the chicken and any flour left.  Browned chicken being careful not to burn and residue on bottom of pot.  I removed chicken and added one large chopped onion chopped and 2 stalks of chopped celery and three cloves of finely chopped garlic.  Added 2T of butter and sautéed vegetables for a few minutes and then added chicken broth to make sure nothing burned.  I added a one pound bag of baby carrots and cooked for about 20 minutes, then added the chicken back.  Continued cooking and added a total of two cans of chicken broth as stew thickened.  Added more water as needed and more salt and pepper.  After about 20 more minutes, I added three red potatoes that were cubed in 3/4" pieces.  Cooked until potatoes were tender, stirring often to make sure nothing stuck to the bottom of the pot.  It kept thickening up and I had to occasionally add more water.  Really good.

This recipe is excellent exactly as written.  I doubled it, and it was still perfect.  Only thing I added was that I topped it with dumplings.  I've been on allrecipes for years, and this recipe is the first one that has ever inspired me to review it.  Great recipe.

Super delicious, and super easy. My husband ate 4 bowls of this and my 5&6 year old kept asking for more. The only different thing I did was use 2tbsp of vegeta instead of chicken broth, its a spice I was raised with in the Balkans and we use for everything. Typing this as I'm cooking the soup again. Thanks for this great recipe !!

Good but good not seem to thicken up. I tired other raters ideas (cornstarch, flour). This came out more like a chicken soup. Not quite what I had in mind.

I'm vigilant about my sodium intake, so I use unsalted chicken broth, and instead of garlic salt, used garlic powder. Also, I sauteed the onion in extra light-tasting olive oil instead of butter.

This recipe was delicious! I did have to change a few things to add some flavour though... I first sauteed the celery, onions and two gloves of garlic.. then I added in the flour and the other juices. It was not very thick so I added in a can of Cream of Chicken soup to help with flavour and thickness. I then added the potatoes and carrots, let them cook in the flavour. I then added the mushrooms, chicken and the rest of the vegetables. Letting it cook longer. I added 2 chicken bouillon cubes to add more flavour which helped a lot! I then blended about 5 cups of the stew to thicken it further. I was really good!!

This dish was pretty good; lots of flavor without being too salty.  I served it over biskets as sort of an easy pot pie.  
I was skeptical about adding the flour to thicken it last (it seemed like it would just clump up) but after sitting for a while the lumps disapeared and the stew was quite thick.  
I made several changes to the recipie to substitute for things I didn't have.  I used some homemade veggie stock in place of some of the chicken stock.  I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  We didn't have any chicken but it was still very tasty.  I also left out the frozen veggies.

I am hard to please when it comes to soups and stews, however, I really loved this. It was exactly what I was craving during this crazy snow storm. I left out the mushrooms and frozen veg. I added left over corn nib. Served with cheese biscuits from this site. Delish!

Delicious with these changes.  I had some items on hand to use up so I added these to the recipe: chicken thighs instead of breasts, green pepper, white wine, tomato paste and a few fresh tomatoes, Masala spice (Indian spice combination) instead of spices listed. This turned the recipe into an Indian Chicken Stew. Yum!!!

This stew is okay.  It did not thicken at all.  I had to add a lot of extra flour in order for it to be the texture that I liked.  I would suggest using 4 or 5 cups of chicken stock instead of 6.  The spices were nice and it tasted great with the garlic biscuits from this site.

Pretty Good... I simmered it quite a bit longer for flavour and used a can of peas instead of frozen veggies (what I had on hand). I might try putting it in a pie crust for pot pie next time.

Yes, I made changes please don't yell. I used thigh meat, a favorite, and thickened as advised but with V8 juice, butter and flour. I sauted onion, mushrooms, celery and garlic before adding favorite veges with some red pepper flakes. Always read the reviews and I realize the changes change the recipe but I feel they are very helpful. Btw, the stew was a big hit.

I replaced the chicken stock with 2 cups low sodium tomato sauce , 2 cups water and 1 can petite diced tomatoes. I added 6 whole cloves, a bay leaf to the seasoning with a little more parsley, and turnip in with the veggies. I added water  as it cooked down. Slow cooked for 4 hours.

This stew is delicious and loved by even my pickiest eater.  I don't use mushrooms but have substituted more of the other veggies and even throw in some frozen edamame from time to time.  Very quick if you have leftover chicken.  I usually just grill more earlier in the week when I know I'm going to make this.  Great leftover too!

I made this stew and added a couple of personal touches to suit our taste. I used some potatoes, but not a lot. I didn't have any frozen veggies so I used canned mixed veggies. I didn't use mushrooms because my hubby doesn't like them. I didn't have oregano so I used Italian seasoning. In place of using a lot of potatoes towards the end I added some frozen flat dumplings. Let me just say it was a complete hit. This is now going to be a favorite winter stew. I had family over a couple days later and served the leftovers. The compliments that followed were great.

Broth was thin like a soup, not like a stew, even though I added 1/8 c. flour and a few spoonfuls of cream of chicken soup.  Otherwise, good.

I used leftover jerk-seasoned cooked chicken along with the rest of the ingredients and it gave it a really nice kick!  I will definitely try this again.
