This recipe was lovely!!!  The base recipe is some what larger than the filling so I doubled the filling mixture, and it turned out perfect!

Great recipe, but I agree that the original recipe is just too sweet. I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar in the lemon mixture (the original recipie calls for 2) and still found it a tad too sweet. I plan on using only 1 cup in the future.

I was impressed with these squares.  They are very easy to make- I opted not to put the walnuts and instead used coconut.  I also followed a couple of the reviews and added less sugar.

This recipe was good, but far too much crust to enjoy the lemony filling. I will cut down the flour, not the sugar in this one.

I am obsessed with lemon squares, and although these were not the best I have tried, they were a good "bar type cookie".  I am partial to a gooy lemon filling and a melt-in-your-mouth type crust.  The filling was just ok and the crust was a tad too thick.  But, they were loved by everyone else (who are not as picky as me about lemon squares!)

This recipe was great! I tried it with less crust as some people said, and it was too thin. Next time, I will use the normal amount of crust, and I will add more filling.

Good but way too sweet.  I'll make this one again, but I'll cut the sugar by at least 1/2 cup. The cookie part was just right in a 9x12" pan.  Thanks!

Recipe is easy to make, but taste is too sweet.  (Best to reduce sugar by half a cup.)

I think you left out an important step in this recipe.....COOl before pouring lemon filling???? I don't know????  This really came out awful. Tasted like dough.  I put it back in the oven thinking I didn't cook it long enough and it still tasted doughy.   You could smell the lemon but couldn't taste it.  Maybe I did something wrong?????

This was the best lemon squares recipe I have ever made! My family loved them. One important note is to set the oven to 20 degrees less than recommended if using a glass pan. I found using fresh lemon juice makes a huge difference in the taste compared to store bought lemon juice.

I thought the squares were absolutely delicious but I think there's definitely room for improvement: the bars were mostly crust and almost no lemon filling. I think I'm going to double if not triple the filling aspect of the recipe. Thoughts?

I use 1/3 cup lemon juice instead of one lemon and 6 Tbl juice.  Also I use 1/4 cup flour for the filling instead of 1 Tbl.  And NO Walnuts!!!  Everyone always asks for the recipe.

I made using 1/2 c. pecans instead of walnuts and 1/2 c. lemon juice.  Tasted great but sure didn't look like the picture.  Browner and more coarse looking.

This recipe was great, but please read all of the reviews before you make it.  I followed the reviewers advice to customize it and it turned out fantastic.  I would definitely make this again, but customized.

Every time I make them my dad won't stop until the pan is empty. I added a little more lemon juice to make them a bit more tarty.

I had never tried Lemon Bars with walnuts in them and these were pretty good.  I reduced the amount of granulated white sugar to 1 1/2 cups based on previous reviews that that claimed they were to sweet.  They were tasty with the 1 1/2 cups of sugar being niether too sweet or not sweet enough.  Next time I will try the full two cups recommended.  I did dust the top with powdered sugar so that may have added to the sweetness as well.

I  couldn't locate my recipe for Lemon Squares & tried this one for a neighborhood get together. It was a big hit & even the crumbs were eaten. I had several requests for the recipe. It is definitely a keeper. Suggest covering lightly with foil the last 10 minutes or so if it is getting too brown around the outside.

I thought the lemon to crust ratio was awesome!  I did use very large lemons, so maybe that would help out some who find the balance somewhat off.  I will make these again next summer!  Chopped walnuts on top definitely makes the recipe.

Definately cut the sugar.  Don't double the filling, but 1 1/2 the filling.

Very good! Sweet but i dont like sharp lemon flavor at all. I used fresh lemon, 3 eggs instead of 4 (it was all i had), cooked for 20 mins on 325 then 10 mins on 300 and it turned out with the perfect texture. While pouring the lemon mixture on top of the crust, it looked there wasnt enough but after cooking, it was the perfect ratio for taste.

Lemon squares with walnuts?  Not when I make them. :P

Instead of going out and buying a lemon I use about 1/4 tsp of lemon extract.  These are so easy and so sweet.  They are a make again...and again...and again.

The recipe was simple to make. (minus  zesting the lemon)However the bake times were off. I was preparing them for a friend and planned accordingly to the times provided. I summed it up to be about 45 minutes of baking and thirty minutes of prep. Long story short my friend ended up waiting an extra half hour for them and I had to turn them over only half cooked. The crust alone took nearly a half hour and the filling took an hour. The finished product mediocre for all the time spent on them; the filling was blan and the crust outweighed it (the crust itself was not good at all) I would never make this again (Not that my friend would ever want them again after how bad they turned out.) This recipe turned out to be a disapointment and a wast of time.

These bars didnt work out so well for me.. i doubled the filling recipe and i tink i ended up cooking it for too long so the filling was so dense and there was a crunchy top layer that pretty much stuck off of the filling... but i cant imagine not doubling the recipe for the filling... there would be only crust! not the best but not terrible.

Terrific taste! absolutely delicious! good thing, too, because I found them a lot of work.
I am not fond of baking...I am more of a candy maker.  Too many bowls, pans, mix this and 
mix that...  But! again... they are delicous! I had some coconut left over from another 
recipe, so I threw a handful of coconut into one batch...superb!

This recipe is sooooo good.  I have never made lemon bars before but they were great.  My husband ate half of them the night I baked them.  He also just started a new job and I packed a few in his lunch to share and he's quickly made some friends with them!

I really think this should have been called Lemon Walnut Squares. The nuts create a different taste and texture in this bar that I did not care for due to the rough contrast to the creamy filling. I have seen a recipe with identical ingredients, sans nuts, which I plan to try, but I'll rate that on the correct nut free recipe when I do.

This recipe is great! I kept all of the measurements the same and the taste turned out just right. My only problem may have to do with my oven, but 35 minutes made the outside of the squares a tiny bit brown and a little hard. Other than that they were so good!

It probably was my fault the squares did not work, so my suggestion is to be sure to use the right size pan. I used a smaller one and tried to cook it longer, since they bars were more dense, but the middle never cooked, so when I cut them, it looked like raw eggs.  But the edge ones were delicious!

My husband and I love lemon squares.  Anything lemon flavored is delicious automatically.  This was a standout recipe, though, and I will definately make it again.  One small change, just to make it more lemony, I made half again as much filling as the recipe called for.  Just a personal preference, would have been nummy either way!

I actually liked the thick, soft-tasting bottom crust in relation to the overly sweet, gooey, lemony filling. But this recipe only gets 3 stars from me. I actually think the gooey-ness factor was a bit too high for my taste and despite a sharp knife and patience, I found these lemon squares difficult to cut and make presentable. 
 These are not presentable, but good for the self-indulgent snack or dessert. Make the pieces very small due to the lemony taste and high sugar content.

Oh yes, one of the guests I serves a lemon square to asked for whipped cream or creme fraiche to go with it. 

Louise.

Consensus of cooks; double the lemon, consider 1/2cup less sugar, consider skipping nuts.  I want to try putting the nuts in the crust.

Each time I bring these to a potluck or family gathering they get rave reviews!  (I skip the nuts because some people have allergies.)  The crust really compliments the lemony flavor.  Easy to make.

I made several changes but overall the squares are very good. I used about 3/4 of the base based on other reviews and reduced the sugar in the top to 3/4 of a cup....they were nice and tart. I made some modified Russian tea cakes with the leftover base. I would adjust the recipe based in your preference for tart or sweet.

These lemon squares are excellent!  The crust is very light and flakey and the lemon part was just the right consistency.  As per the other reviewers I cut the sugar to just slightly over half of what was called for and it was the perfect sweetness.

I have used this recipe many, many times, and everyone always loves them! I've only altered the recipe one time, and I put less lemon juice in it...bad idea! It didn't taste like lemons. My suggestion would be to not change the recipe; these turn out perfect every time.

these are fantastic!  I've made multiple times, I've cut back 1/2 cup on the flour for the bottom crust and it worked out great... a must for any Holiday or just lite after dinner dessert
