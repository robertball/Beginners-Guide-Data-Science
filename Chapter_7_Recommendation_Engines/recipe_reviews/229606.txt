I had to eliminate the avocado and red wine vinegar because my spouse won' t eat avocado and reacts to anything with red wine in it.  I chopped up fresh spinach and used lemon juice instead of the vinegar, used fresh basil leaves, and Italian 5 cheese blend in place of just mozzarella. With a dash of extra virgin olive oil, it was a perfect light salad side!

I substituted the sugar with honey and julienned fresh basil instead of the dried.  It was fresh tasting and delicious.

I used fresh basil,  small cherry tomatoes, and didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used white wine and plum vinegars instead with no sugar.

I served this in salad bowls without the toast (as pictured).  I used a really fine balsamic dressing without the red wine vinegar.  The taste was absolutely wonderful!  I think next time I will add some chopped mushrooms.  This combination would make a meal!

Throughly enjoyed this salad! I used honey instead of sugar, I also added just a touch of olive oil, and fresh basil! Was a hit, I'll be making this again for sure!

We didn't use the sugar nor the salt, and we used fresh basil.  It was delightful.
