Very nice and oh so quick.  Here is a secret to a good sear on the scallops.  Get your pan screaming hot - I used Grape Seed oil, as it has a high smoke point - place your wrapped scallops into the pan - don't over crowd them - and DO NOT MOVE them.  The temptation is to shake and move the scallops around but hands off!  About 3 minutes, give them a flip and the same thing with the other side.  Let them sear without moving them.  Have everything else for dinner ready and waiting.  I served these with a lovely salad with sliced oranges, red onion, baby lettuce and sliced mushrooms.  What a perfect meal.

The Baking Nana instructions of not moving the scallops was perfect. These were a huge hit at my family party this weekend. Very tasty and very easy. We used our 1000W microwave to pre-cook the bacon. We had 4 slices on a plate for 2:30 on high. Then when searing in the oil, they became perfectly crispy. We made about 20 scallops at a time. Will do this one again.

It would be dangerous to use the amount of Cajun seasoning as directed as it would dominate the taste of the sweet, delicately flavored scallops.   I used only a light dusting which gave them just the right amount of spice.

Disappointed.  Had for New Years Eve & the bacon took over in flavor.  You didn't even taste the scallop.  With the price of scallops we'll stick to other recipes to use. It was quick & easy to make.

Very easy and delicious.Did overcook the bacon a little which made it hard to wrap but got it done regardless. Will make it again.

Wife & I LOVED these! Scallops and Bacon ... what's not to love! Only changes were to fry them in bacon grease and seasoned with Zatarain's Creole Seasoning that I had on hand. Used  el cheapo streaky bacon for it's thin cut to ensure complete cooking after two minutes in microwave. Served with Jasmine rice and garden salad.  Soooo GOOD.

Hubs loved - anything with bacon- right?  Didn't have cajun seasoning - used Montreal Steak Seasoning.  Used thick bacon from the butcher block.  Skewered them and grilled them.  Pefection! Thanks for a great recipe.

Talk about easy and my girlfriend was SO impressed. My scallops were large so in the end the bacon only stayed on one of them so I lost some points on presentation but truly, without changing a thing I thought these were delicious.

Yep, very yummy! I found a great recipe for Cajun Seasoning here and mixed up a batch of that to use for later. Cooked these up and both my husband and I loved these. Definitely a keeper!
