This tasted better the longer in sat. I actually dried out my bread cubes in the oven since I forgot to let them sit over night. Easy and quick to make.

I wasn't sure about crumb topping on bread pudding but it was good! it was a little dry but I'll adjust to less bread next time. It's really great warmed and with icecream!
