This chowder was a big hit at a church dinner!  I modified the recipe by mixing everything together in a large crock pot and cooked overnight.  I followed the directions of adding the half and half at the end.  Great recipe.

I have been looking for an easy, tasty corn chowder recipe, and this one fits the bill nicely!  I used chicken broth instead of water, ham instead of bacon, two cans of cream corn and one whole kernal (undrained) and left the skin on the potatos.  I served this with the Kentucky Biscuits from this site and have to say:
Yum! Yum! Yum!

Wow! This soup was so good. My husband is a big fan of corn chowder, as he orders it every time we go eat out. He said that this was the best he had ever had, and that this recipe was a keeper. I only made a few small adjustments. While cooking I left a bit more bacon grease in, and I also added chiken bouillon to the 2 cups of water. To top it off I sprinkled shredded chedder cheese on the top and let it melt a little before serving. I will not be looking for another corn chowder recipe, this is the best.

Awesome corn chowder! I made a couple changes, but it is so delicious! I substituted 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth for water and 2 cups evaporated milk for half-and half and added 2 tsp ground thyme....Fabulous! Thanks!

This was a great starter recipe for me.  I didn't use bacon.  I substituted chicken stock for the water.  I added chicken, green bell peppers, and substituted fresh corn for canned.  I made a roux with butter and flour to thicken it.  After adding the heavy cream and a pinch of nutmeg, I had a soup that got rave reviews.

Oh, sooooo good! I made it exactly as the recipe says and it was awesome. Have tried various corn chowder recipes before (usually with chicken) and never cared for them, but the bacon was just right! Be sure not to skip the step of lightly browning the potatoes and onions with the bacon and drippings as I think this really develops the flavors. Will probably try it with milk instead of the half-and-half and may possibly try reducing the salt, but otherwise, this is a wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This one is a keeper! I followed the original recipe except added chicken broth instead of water. Super easy to make and absolutely delicious. Tasted even better for left-overs, the bacon flavor was even more developed. Will definitely make again.

I thought this recipe was very good. We used vegetable oil instead of bacon and it still turned out great, so if anyone wants a vegetarian freindly version i sugest using oil.The taste was very good and the potatos added great texture.

This was the first time making corn chowder and this recipe is the best! I took the suggestions of using chicken broth instead of water and mixed cream corn with fresh corn. Delicious!!!!

This is an excellent "starter" recipe and very similar to my own. I brown an entire lb of bacon cut into 1/2 inch pieces and drained. I use one can of cream corn and then 1 1/2 cups frozen extra sweet corn. I also brown in  with the bacon and onion 1 cup diced celery and add 1/2 tsp dehydrated, minced garlic. When the potatoes have cooked I add color by adding 1 tbsp chopped parsley and one small jar of diced pimentoes. Another trick is to grate about 1/4 tsp fresh nutmeg on the bacon as it is browning. I put nutmeg in almost everything I cook as it is a "flavor enhancer." I also add about 1/2 stick of butter; what's chowder without butter? You end up with the a most colorful chowder that not only tastes great, but looks great too.

Yummy! My Grandma also made this.  Instead of bacon, try frying a little old fashioned salt pork cubes to sprinkle on the top and thicken the soup with instant mashed potatoes.

Excellent- but if you want it thicker here's what I did. I didn't use bacon at all. I added 3 tablespoons butter to the onion and cooked until the onions were soft. Added 3 tablespoons flour and slowly whisked in 2 cups chicken broth until thickened. I used the cream style corn plus a can of sweet corn. I added the half and half at the end and it turned out delicious!

Great basic recipe.  I omit the half and half, but puree one of the cans of creamed corn so it is smooth. This makes the texture silky without adding all the fat.  I also use packaged REAL bacon bits (from Costso) to save time and mess--just add the potatoes and onion to them in a pan and crisp up a bit. There is far less bacon fat this way and we dont notice a diference in the taste. That said, however, I do add about a cup of leftover diced chickn at the end of cooking and also about an ounce of grated cheddar on top. This makes it seem like more of a "real" meal to us. I have also used some smoked ham to punch up the flavor and ALWAYS use chicken stock rather than water.

Quick and easy, and a big hit for today's lunch!   I had potatoes leftover from the Honey Roasted Red Potatoes recipe from this site, so I used those and added them in with the corn.  I omitted the salt from the recipe since the bacon is already salty and my potatoes were cooked in salted water.  I added the half and half to the pot without warming it first.  I lowered the heat and added it, when it started to simmer, I turned the stove off.  The key is to not let it come to a boil since that may cause the half and half to separate and make the chowder watery.  To keep a skin from forming on your chowder as it cools, pour it into a serving dish and  place a piece of plastic wrap or waxed paper directly on top of the chowder.

Attention Vegetarians! I made this without the bacon, and it was great.  I used a purple onion and vegetable broth in place of the water for more flavor.  I used 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2, and one cup So Delicious Coconut Milk.

This corn chowder is pretty great with a few very minor changes. Definitely substitute chicken stock for the water. I also used 2 cans of cream corn and 1 can regular corn otherwise I find it too sweet. I did find that I had to thicken it at the end because it was thinner than I like for chowder (good consistency for a basic cream soup however). At the end I put in a little bit of nutmeg as per a previous reviewer's suggestion and it was perfect with it. It wasn't really noticeable but it was enough to make you say "Mmmm what is that?". After cooking it, I left the bacon out until the end and sprinkled it on top in order to keep some of the crunchy texture. It tasted even better the second day. Overall, this was a fabulous recipe and I will be making it often! Thank you for the lovely recipe. It reminds me of when I was a child.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this chowder!  Make it and people will RAVE and ask you for the recipe.  It's tasty the way it is, but I did customize the recipe for my family.  Instead of half and half, we use heavy whipping cream.  We double the bacon and save half of it to use as a garnish later. We also add finely chopped parsley at the end to add color.  If you want to thicken the chowder, make a roux of 2 TBS of butter and 2 TBS of flour.  Mix and simmer in a small pot for a few minutes......then add a ladle of liquid from the broth to the roux.....it will expand and thicken.  Do this two more times, then transfer the roux to the pot of chowder and gently mix well.  Do this before you add the parsley.  It's perfectly yummy!

Made this with minimal modifications. I used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water, and used fresh corn cut from the cob and the cobs scraped for their milkiness. Also added 1/2 t. of dried thyme and 4 slices of American cheese. Additionally, I used non-fat half and half (how do they get the fat out???) This was absolutely FANTASTIC! I'm certain it would be just as great as written! Next time, maybe I'll try adding some sherry, and/or a little dash of tabasco as well! I'll be making this again and again! Thanks for the recipe, and many thanks to "Grandma" also!!!

This is a very easy soup to make that is delicious and satisfying. Because I use the 14ish ounce cans I did the following (sorta like doubling the recipe). I increase the bacon to 1 c., used the same amount of potato, 1 lrg. onion, 3 c. chix broth instead of water (I like a little thicker chowder), 2 cans creamed corn and 1 whole kernal and salt/pepper to taste. I did add a couple dashes of celery seed and then added 2 t. sugar because my corn needed a little help to bring out its sweetness and used fat free half-half to desired consistency per individual serving. Garnished with a sprinkle of parsley and couldn't have been happier with the results. I like to make alot and freeze some which too is why I add the half-half to a serving as oppossed to the entire pot. Delicious!! The corn is sweet and the bacon, onion and chix stock are savory making a nice combination.

The PERFECT crowd pleaser. I made 12 gallons of this chowder and it was a huge hit.  I added kernal corn in addition to the creamed corn. Will definately be making this again.

I made this for a family gathering and it got RAVE reviews!! It was delicious and had great flavor! I made it using the slow cooker and day in advance, added all the ingredients except 1/2 and 1/2  - warmed it up the next day about 3 hours prior to party added the milk - it was fantastic. I did substitute chicken broth for the water - thanks for the recipe!! It's a keeper.

Made this as part of an effort to use up pantry staples and was rewarded. I never make soup without doubling the recipe, as I like to have leftovers for lunch or to freeze.  Changes (many of them inspired by other reviewers) included: included diced celery and carrot at the sautee stage, used chicken stock instead of water (mine happened to be unsalted), used a combination of creamed corn and kernal corn, used evaporated milk instead of cream and a bit less than the amount of cream called for due to the can size (didn't heat separately - just slowly heated in the soup), added about 1 tsp dried thyme leaves, used less salt than called for (suggest you start with half the amount and taste and add from there as needed), added a generous handful of chopped parsley and freshly ground pepper to finish.  Thought thickness was just perfect (both potatoes and corn contributed to the consistency) and didn't feel the need for flour.  A great base recipe that I will definitely use again.

Very easy and good recipe. I use milk instead of half-and-half to cut the fat and use a mixer at the end to make the potatoes a little mushed in. That's just how I like it and it's great.   I've also tried thickening the milk with a rue before adding to the soup and it makes it super creamy without all the fat.

This recipie was absolutely delicious and was a big hit at our family Christmas party. I made a few changes like using 2 cups of cream-style corn and 1 cup of fresh corn (taken off the cobbler); using 1 can of evaporated milk instead of half-and-half; substituting chicken broth for water. It turned out wonderful and I have cravings for it every now and then!

I did this in my crock pot.  I used diced ham instead of the bacon and it was a hit with thick crusty french bread.  I set my crock pot on high and it was done in less than four hours!  This is a fave with even teens!

This recipe is AMAZING!!!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I left more than 2T of the bacon grease for a little more flavor.  I also added chilcken bouillon.   And I only added about 3/4 cup of the half and half because I like the way it tasted already without it!  I will definitely be making this again and again!!!

Excellent chowder. It was missing one thing, 1/2 cup of butter. The butter brought all the flavors togeather and reminded me of the corn chowder that my Nana made when I was a kid.

This is definately a keeper. My son who is 8 requests this recipe often. I use pre-cooked bacon pieces and put all ingredients except the half & half in my crock-pot and let it cook most of the day. I add the half & half just before serving. I like to add hot sauce to my bowl and top it with grated cheese. Yum Yum!

Very good recipe. I also used broth instead of water and I added sliced carrots and celery, and when I served it I topped it with grated cheese. It is delicious.

This is some of the best corn chowder I've ever tasted. Followed the directions to a tee and it turned out great. Just want to add a comment to those that have changed things in this recipe and then giving it 3 or 4 stars. I just don't understand the reasoning. Anyway, it's a great recipe as is.

5 star dish, no question.  The only change I made was to substitute equal amounts of canned chicken stock in place of the water.  The only change I will make next time is to not add the crumbled bacon before the liquid and subsequent simmer, as it makes the bacon sort of soggy, and doesn't add much (since the veggies are sauteed in bacon grease to start with).  In turn, I will crumble the bacon and add it atop each bowl at serving.    A wonderful dish, which I served with canned flaky biscuits, perfect for dunking and sopping up.

My family was not thrilled to be having corn chowder for dinner but once they tasted this one, they were hooked.  No leftovers!  The only thing I changed about the recipe was a suggestion another reviewer made:  to use chicken broth in place of the water.  It was a huge hit and I'll definitely be making this one again!

My family and I love this meal. I used chicken broth instead of water as suggested by others.  Also, I used 5 cans of creamed corn and alot more potatoes as we like it a bit more dense then the original receipe. Delicious!

After looking at several corn chowder recipes I decided to try this one. It turned out really good. I did make a few small changes. I felt like it needed more corn so I used 3 cans of cream style corn and one can of regular corn. I used fat free half and half and also added a can of evaporated milk. After cooking the bacon, onion and potatoes I put it in my crockpot with the water and let it cook for aboout 3 hours, until the potatoes were done.

Wow!  Soo good.  I used Kilbasa instead of bacon.  My family loves spices so I added a touch of nutmeg, a tablespoon of seasoned salt, and some crushed red pepper.  I also added a bag of frozed corn.  This was awesome.

This soup was good and really easy to make. Next time, I won't use any canned corn (it was missing a little of that wonderful sweetness of regular corn). Instead, I will use 3 cups fresh or frozen. I used chicken stock instead of water and added garlic with the potatoes and onions (but only for the last minute), which added a lot of flavor. Per a previous reviewer's suggestion, I made this with the "Kentucky Biscuits" from this sight--great idea!

Absolutely delicious and much healthier once I made 4 changes.  1. Low sodium chicken broth instead of water. 2. Use a bag of frozen corn instead of creamed.  3. Use canadian bacon instead of greasy bacon  4. 1/2 cup of half-and-half plus a 1 1/2 cup 0% Greek yogurt.  Really cuts down on the calories and still tastes rich.

Great recipe!!! I used 2 cans of creamed corn and 1 can of regular corn.  I also diced the potatoes and onion into corn size pieces...then fried them in the bacon grease for 20-30 minutes until they were getting a nice brown crust...fantastic!!!  I poured a small splash of cream on the soup when it was served in the bowl...decadent!

Very yummy rib stickin chowder.  I did what others suggested and used chicken broth instead of water and evaporated milk to save on the fat.  But, I also used almost a pound of bacon, with fat trimmed alittle leftover ham and used 2 cans of creamed corn and 4 ears of corn off the cob.   I put all together in a stock pot on low on stovetop, it's simmering now.. but I did sneak a couple spoonfuls and it's yummmmmy.   Gonna serve in bread bowls with salad.

This is the first corn chowder I've ever attempted.  It was very easy to make and delicious.  I made the  recipe as stated, but next time might add a can of whole kernel corn as other reviewers mentioned.  Also, may try it as a vegetarian soup and with milk instead of cream to cut down on calories.  All in all a very hearty, "comfort" soup.  Thank you for sharing your Grandma's recipe!

This chowder was outstanding!! I had to tweak it a little. I used 2 cans of creamed corn, 1 can of sweet corn, 1 cup of chicken stock and 1 cup of water. I used frozen Ore Ida southewest potatoes. I added already crumbled bacon, and sauteed the onions and potatoes together. I added a little garlic, thyme, salt and pepper. My family loved it! I will definitely make this again! Great for cold nights! I need to double the recipe for my family of 7!!!

I didn't have any 1/2 & 1/2 so I used non-dairy creamer. I made a huge pot and there wasn't a drop left. The soup was too watery so I used a Roux to thicken it up and then got the desired consistency by adding the creamer.  My guests said it was the best corn chowder they have ever had. I'll make this again.

Loved it!!! I made this tonight and it was fantastic! I have never made soup before and it turned out great! Even my 3 year old liked it. I made a few changes: I added a clove of garlic with the onions and a little flour for thickness, I used chicken stock instead of water and used 1 can of whole corn and 2 cans of creamed corn. I also added shredded chicken and wild rice. It also could use a little more salt to cut the sweetness of the corn. Next time, I will use 2 cans of whole corn and 1 can of creamed corn. This was a great, easy recipe, thanks!!!***Update I have been making this for a couple months and have found that it is better to cook the bacon in a separate pan and then add it to the potatoes and onions. Otherwise, the browning of the bacon leaves a funny after-taste if the soup is cooked in the same pot.

Really easy & tasty for a quick warm dinner.  The only things I changed the second time aking this was to use chicken broth instead of water, since it wasnt very thick I thickened it (using a tablespoon cornstarch). I also added thyme, and celery flakes as well as a cup of frozen sweet corn.  Will definately make again!

Yummy...go, grandma!  This is pure comfort food.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did whisk 2 tablespoons of flour into the half and half before I added it to the chowder as I like it a bit thicker and I didn't heat it first, just mixed it in and let it heat to almost boiling.  I also followed other reviewers suggestions to use chicken broth instead of water.  This is a keeper and will use again and again!

The recipe was very good, but I felt it was missing something. I added a tablespoon of chicken boullioun and it seemed to fix it for me.

This is soooo good.  I use two cans of the cream-style corn and about a cup and a half of frozen corn.  One of my all-time favorite soups.

This recipe produces a creamy and rich corn chowder.  It's great as is or with embellishments.  I added 3 ears of fresh corn, chicken broth instead of water and just one cup of half and half.  No bacon but did have some organic bacon drippings for sautéing.  I used a Cuisinart immersion blender on approx. 1 cup of the soup and added it back in before adding the half and half.  This method always produces a creamy soup.

I've used this recipe for several years now. I initially took the advice of other posters and used chicken stock instead of water and I used a can of regular corn and two of cream corn. Those were the only changes I made for a long time.

For ease, I always buy a packet of real bacon pieces in the salad and then cook that up with some olive oil.

Recently, I tried jazzing it up and it was to die for. Instead of olive oil, I used 3T of butter to cook the bacon and used two packets of bacon pieces. I added three cloves of garlic with the onion and used two really humongous potatoes and cooked until they were really soft. From there, I did the chicken stock and one can of corn (undrained), two cans of cream corn. I also added about 1/2t of sage, a bay leaf, a shade of crushed red pepper and a generous amount of pepper. I also don't bother warming the half and half, but just dump in at the end. While doing the 20 min simmer I left the top off to cook off some of the water from the broth and corn. What came out was a savory soup with an amazing flavor to it.

Also - this soup gets better after a day in the fridge so it makes a great lunch the day after.

Hope this helps!

MMM,MMM,MMMMM GOOD!! I just made this for the first time tonight and boy was it soo good!!! I made some modifications based on other reviews to fit my family's likes: 1lb. thick cut bacon fried to just barely crispy, reserved about 1/4C. drippings, 6 med potatoes cubed small(1/4 inch maybe) 2 cans creamed corn, 1 can whole corn with juice, 1 can chicken broth and a little heavy whipping cream and cooked as directed. Now, I have never had corn chowder before and was starting to get a little nervous towards the end because when I tasted it, it kind of reminded me of cream corn with a little smokiness to it but after I added the whipping cream and let it cook for a while longer it took on a whole nother flavor! I was very pleased with how it turned out and my family just loved it ( and they can be quite picky) Deffintly something I am going to make during these cold winter months, next time I am going to serve with some cheddar garlic biscuits just to add a little something extra to the meal!!

This was so easy to make, I love it! I couldn't stop eating it. The only thing I did differently was added more bacon, more corn and I used regular canned corn instead of cream corn. I used 2.5 cans of corn, might even use 3 next time! This will be a normal occurance in my house :) Thanks Grandma!!

Great chowder! I'm vegetarian so I omitted the bacon and added green chilies. The flavor was great and was even better the next day.

Made as written but exchanged chicken stock for water and used mixture of froz corn/creamed corn.  Also added ham, red pepper & bay leaf.  Used milk instead of half/half and added a little less so the soup was thicker.  This was really good, the kids even liked it!

I used a small package of bacon, added a sprinkle of garlic powder and significantly reduced the onion.
Two cans of creamed corn and one can of whole kernel corn.  Would have liked to add a third of the creamed corn but figured I wanted to taste the end results and may opt to do that next time.
Also used the fat free half and half.
Liked this and will make it again -with the addition of that third can of creamed corn.  I just prefer a bit thicker consistency.

Awesome!  I doubled the batch for my family of 3 teenage boys and my BF and I.  It made plenty and they all raved about it.  It's a keeper.  Although next time I think I need to put in some protein, like ham.

Good quick recipe. I changed the servings to 2, didn't have bacon, but had two slices of prosciutto whick I chopped and fried as bacon. Didn't have creamed corn, but frozen corn worked well. Used half & half and about 1 TBLS butter and mashed the potatoes a little to thicken slightly. Also added some nutmeg (fresh grated) at the end-just a touch. Very good despite not having the exact ingredients. This was a really quick homemade chowder and I will make again!

Great soup!  I've made this with and without bacon and it's good both ways.  I also use just 1 teaspoon of salt and add 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.  It's also nice to just leave the skins on the potatoes especially if you're using red skinned potatoes.  I've also added chicken broth in place of the water for a flavor boost.  Any way you make it, this recipe is a great basic recipe and can be altered and still turn out just fine.

This soup is easy to make, but it was just too sweet and salty for us.  I would recommend just using 1 can of cream-style corn and then enough frozen corn to get 3 cups total to cut the sugar a little.

Delicious!  Used chicken broth instead of water, 3 cans of cream style corn, and 1/2 can of whole kernel corn drained.  Saved the bacon to add right before serving.  Also set out shredded cheese to add.  It was a big hit!

Absolutely delicious!!  This is the best soup I have ever made!  I added some ham along with the bacon and substituted one of the cans of cream corn with one can of regular whole kernel corn.  I served it with biscuits and even my husband, who normally hates corn chowder, loved it and ate 3 bowls!  It definitely made a lot and we were a little sick of it by the end of the week so next time, I will make this for company.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!

Very good. Took the advise of one reviewer and used 2 can of creamed corn and 1 can of whole kernel corn. Only used 2 potatoes because that is all I had and it was plenty. I also substituted 1 can of chicken broth for the water and salt.  Will definitely make again.

delish. I used 1 can creamy corn and 1 can golden corn. also used 2 cups milk instead of half/half. Finally, I flash blended it just before serving to thicken it up a bit. Perfect for Thanksgiving. Will DEFINATELY make this again. THanks grams :)

I made a few changes to this recipe. I added garlic powder, dried parsley, a little bit of butter and some frozen whole kernal corn. I also threw in one cube of chicken bouillon with the water. To cut down on fat and calories, I used milk instead of half and half and I think it worked fine. It wasn't as thick and "chowdery" as I'm sure it would've been with the half and half, but I'd rather have fewer calories and less fat. I'll make this again, but I'll probably use more bacon. I might also add some cheese.

I'm not a chowder person but was drawn to this recipe for some reason and gave it a shot on a chillier-than-usual NYC fall day- glad I did!  I omitted the bacon (not a meat-eater), used one cup whole corn kernels/two cups creamed corn, and replaced 1 tsp of salt with a pinch of sugar...mmmm really tasty chowder!  Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper =)

We enjoyed this soup a lot.  I did make a few little changes, I used broth instead of water and I added more bacon.  (What isn't better with more bacon!)  I also made the soup, except half and half, early in the day and let it finish cooking in the crock pot.  This just made my day easier.  My kids and my husband really loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is just like the one my mother used to make and I had lost her recipe so was glad to find this one.  The only thing different was the heavy cream, my mom used evaporated milk and it was still very good.

I have never made chowder of any kind before but this was easy and awesome. I did use turkey bacon instead of the real but it turned out great. I added chunks of chicken and egg noodles to the left overs for a twist the next day. THANKS! will definately make again.

Easy and good, I used fat free half and half, 1/2 cream corn and half canned corn, reduced salt by 1/2 and added 2 tbs. chicken bouillon granules, added a dash of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp thyme.  Good flavor, will make again, maybe reducing the half and half to 1 cup as final chowder was not as thick as I like.

Good! I used a combo of creamed corn and frozen corn cut off the cob, evaporated milk instead of half and half and added some chipotle tabasco for a kick. I'll make this again.

WOW, this is amazing chowder!  I have been looking for an easy corn chowder recipe, and this one is delicious! I followed some of the other reviews and used chicken broth instead of water, , two cans of cream corn 1/2 a bag of frozen corn.  I left the skin on the potatoes and I added some chopped chicken and garlic.  This was a huge hit at the dinner table and if my husband has anything to say about it, this chowder will be made often!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I did make a few changes.  I kept the potato skins on.  I used one large can of Creamed Corn and one large can of Mexicorn (undrained).  I also used chicken broth and evaporated milk.  I put the evaporated milk in at the start.  I could tell that the chowder was not going to be thick so I put 1 Tbsp. of Minute Tapioca into the ingredients as well.  This is a trick that I learned many years ago when I purchased my very first crock pot.  The tapioca will thicken the chowder as it cooks and there is no mess from mixing flour and water or cornstarch and water.  Just be careful not to use to much.

I made this for a ladies luncheon and it was a hit! Thw soup is creamy and rich tasting. I don't like bacon so, I used olive oil instead of the drippings. I also replaced 1 c. of the water with 1 c. vegetarian broth. It was easy to make and the recipe was requested several times.

I loved it with bacon, but on second time, HAM turned out great too (I substituted butter for the grea-- uh,drippings--) Used chicken bouillon paste instead of salt, whole MILK instead of cream, but added 2-3 Tb. CORNSTARCH mixed with some cold water to thicken. Then--COLBY, not cheddar, cheese as well(4-8 ounces). Cook the milk in the soup, then add the cheese at the end; milk can be heated without fear of curdling like cream. This was well received by our guests, and EASY too!!

I have now cooked this five or six times and everytime it comes out perfect.  I add the half and half right at the beginning with the water.  Also sometimes I add chicken with or without the bacon.  My husband adores it to no end.

Great corn chowder recipe.  I didn't use the crumbled bacon, but did use the bacon grease for  flavor. I used cream corn. Next time I will use  broth instead of water. I probably won't eat this often for health reasons, but I'm glad to have the recipe. It tasted good the next day warmed in the microwave.

Very easy to make and good for using up some produce that's nearing the end of its freshness if you like a chowder with more veggies! I added 3 stalks of thinly sliced celery and 2 grated carrots. I sautéed the onion, carrots, and celery with a bit of garlic and made a roux since it's cold and snowing and I wanted a thicker chowder. Added chicken broth instead of water as other reviewers suggested. I also used 2 cans of creamed corn and 1 can peaches and cream corn. Made this in the morning and put it in the crockpot. Will add the half and half shortly before serving. This recipe would be 5 stars as written (I just needed to use up some stuff in my fridge!).

This came out creamy and just thick enough. I first sauteed for about 8 min, 1/2 each of onion and red pepper in bacon fat that I had on hand and later added crushed garlic. I used chicken broth (about 1 1/2 cups) and about 2 cups of unpeeled potatoes. I also used 2 small cans of cream style corn and a 15.25 oz can of undrained canned corn. In place of the half & half, I used a regular sized can of evaporated milk. Sweet and delicious, and I know it will taste better as it stands. Thanks for a good starting point!

My family loved this recipe. It was very easy to make and I will definitely make it many more times. I used chicken broth instead of water. We ate it with a couple crushed up saltine crackers on the top. Delicious!

I would make the night before adding the cream then.  Also I would reduce amount of liquid--mine was too thin.

Delicious!  Made as directed except added chicken bullion cubes as suggested by other reviews.  I used 4 slices of thick smoked bacon and would probably double that next time and used 2 cans of creamed corn,  didn't bother measuring them. Will definitely make again!

New family hit!  I took the suggestion of cooking the vegetables  in the bacon grease and using chicken broth. After overnight, the flavoring kicked just right.   Thank you!

I make this as written except I don't drain the bacon grease, I use it all to cook the potatoes and I also cook them a bit more then 5 minutes because I want a bit of a crisp on them and I use an entire package of bacon...because let's face it...bacon is love.  I am a huge corn chowder fan and this is by far my favorite recipe.  I even won a work contest with it.

Thanks for a great recipe! I used homemade chicken stock, and 1 can evaporated milk instead of half/half. Thickened it a bit with 2T cornstarch as we like that consistency.   Really flavorful, and was a hit for dinner.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I added a few changes just for personal taste as I was craving a more Hawaiian style corn chowder, but seriously this recipe would be amazing as is.. all I did was use 2 cups creamed corn and subbed the last cup for cream of mushroom soup and added 1 can of sweet corn drained. I also added half a can of diced pan fried spam or u can use Portuguese sausage and since I love a thick chowder, I simmered for 15 minutes longer after adding the half and half with 1/4 cup flour. . Delicious and not a serving left for a family of 6.. we indulged with a loaf of home made garlic bread.. this is a keeper for sure!! Thank you for sharing!!

I just tried this tonight. Definitely a keeper! I only had one can of creamed corn so I added two more canfulls of frozen corn. I just used water like the recipe called for and was going to taste and see if it needed chicken bullion but I didn't think that it did so I left it. I did however sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top in my bowl & I liked it so much that I ended up adding about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the pot of soup and it was super delicious! I will probably keep it  that way in the future. I couldn't get enough of this soup and will definitely be making it regularly. Thank you!!

Tried to stay as close to recipe but had to adjust for gluten-free and onion allergy. Used total of 3 cans sweet corn, mashing 1 cup in food processor. Used 12oz. & 5oz. cans of evaporated milk, no half & half on hand. After potatoes were tender brought to boiling and added 2 Tbsp. corn starch dissolved in 1/4 cup water (because creamed corn could not be used.) When thickened, removed from heat and stirred in warmed milk. Received rave reviews from everyone who tried it. SIL had introduced me to corn chowder & was surprised at how much better this recipe was than her's. Thanks for such a great recipe.

I am 19 and just starting to explore cooking. I love corn chowder and had been craving it all week. I looked up some recipes and this one seemed the simplest. Simple it was, but DELICIOUS! Like I said I am just starting to try cooking and I was suprised I made it! Very yummy, made exactly as the recipe says.

Best corn chowder I've ever made!  I used one can of chicken broth and added some more potatoes and a dollop of butter, OMG so good.  Served with warm bisquits. The bacon flavor was amazing.  Loved it.

Absolutely perfect! Made with turkey bacon, low sodium chicken broth, fat free half & half, 2 cans cream corn, and one whole. Will make again and again. Froze approx 8 cups and was able to get 8 more out so I would say serves 16.

Oh my gosh! Delish! Made vegetarian for my daughter and regular for the rest of us, and sorry vegetarians...you don't know what you're missing! Well, maybe you do, but the bacon makes this soup! The only thing I changed was used veggie stock instead of water and evaporated milk instead of half and half because I didn't have any. It's freaking amazing! You have to try it!

This was a fantastic base for a chicken corn chowder my husband and I wanted to make. We mostly followed the instructions, but instead of using bacon I used ghee to saute the vegetables. I also added baby carrots, a rotisserie chicken and some diced bell pepper. I used 1 can of cream corn and 1 can of regular corn. Instead of cooking everything in water I used chicken broth. It was hit all around, and we had enough soup to last us for days! Thank you again.

This is the chowder that my mom used to make for us growing up... I followed the recipe almost to a tee - just used 2 cans of cream of corn, 1 can of low fat evaporated milk (I don't have any half and half around) 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth and used some slap yo mama cajun spice. It was delish with my knockoff red lobster cheddar biscuits.

Made this with regular corn and no dairy at all. Used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of water.  I also pureed about 3 cups of it. Saved the crumbled bacon to sprinkle on top after ladling it into bowls. We loved it! Next time, I'll cut the potatoes much smaller.

I thought this was a decent chowder, but nothing fantastic.  The chowder was very thin so I added a roux like others had suggested.  I also substituted the water with chicken broth, added a pinch of nutmeg as others did, and halved the salt.  Something wasn't right....can't place my finger on it though.  I'll try this recipe again....maybe without the modifications...maybe...

This is pretty good.  Needs some tweaking for sure as others have said.  I sub turkey sausage for the bacon, chicken broth for the water, use fat free 1/2 and 1/2, leave the skin on the red potatos, and I add red pepper, green pepper, shredded carrot.  I garnish w cilantro.  Super easy and a good, healthy meal.

Delicious! Made changes that others suggested:

chicken stock instead of water
few dashes of nutmeg
blended it all up with the hand mixer
used red potatoes w/some skins on
used all the bacon grease
top with cheddar cheese and green onions  when serving! 

Yum!!! My family loves it!

I've never had corn chowder but love corn so I gave this recipe a try and it's fantasic. I had nothing to compare this to so I brought it to work and EVERYONE loves it. As other people had suggested broth instead of water, I followed the recipe as stated except I did 1 cup broth and 1 cup water (I ran out of broth). This is one that I will keep and make time and time again. 

I've made this multiple times since I initially reviewed this recipe. I've cooked my bacon in the pot that I end up using for the chowder. The bacon residue ended up sticking to the bottom of the pot and when I let the chowder simmer, all that bacon-y goodness gets incorporated into the chowder. Very yummy suggestion.

I was looking for a reciepe different than my tex-mex corn chowder. This one was good but i made a few changes. Being vegetarian i used veggie stock and no bacon. I used a roux and cream and added a little chili powder for a kick. I served with croutons and chedder cheese on top and buttermilk biscuits on the side!

I modified this recipe quite a bit simply because it could be more flavorful.  I used chicken broth instead of water - I used about 4.5 cups only because I added more stuff, added a dash of cayenne pepper, teaspoon of dried chives and parsley, 1/2 tsp turmeric.  I used a large onion instead of a medium, 4 cloves of garlic, 2 (or 3) stalks of celery diced, 2 carrots sliced thinly and fried these on medium-low in olive oil.  I also fried in olive oil the potatoes with a dash of salt and pepper and again a dash of turmeric.  Then I added these to the chowder.  I too like a thicker chowder and used 3 cans of cream style corn, 1 small bag of frozen corn.  I also used 1 large ham steak  chopped instead of bacon.

Yummy!  Per other reviews, I replaced the water with chicken broth, used 2 cans cream corn and 1 whole kernel corn, and used some bacon for garnish (in addition to what's in the soup).  Flavor was outstanding!  It was definitely soupy, though, and the potatoes took forever to cook.  Next time I will dice the potatoes good and small, cut back on the liquid, and either smash potatoes or add Wondra to increase thickness if needed.  Will definitely make again, though.  Super yummy!

I thought this recipe was great!! My picky 11 year old daughter and 22 month old son even liked it. I used evaporation milk because thats what I had on hand. I would have liked it to be a little thicker so I will try half and half next time. I also used chicken broth instead of water. I would also have liked a little more corn so I will probably add an addtional can of whole kernal corn. I will be making this again real soon. Thanks!!

This was so yummy! Even my fussy husband ate it!It was a little bit thin when first made, but then thickened up after cooling/reheating. I used chicken broth instead of the water. I also added some frozen whole corn kernels when adding the creamed corn. This gave it more texture.

This is a great soup.  I've made it twice and the first time I said I would use regular milk instead of the half-and-half.  I guess I forgot because I made it the same way the second time.  I find that the half-and-half is too rich and you can really taste it.  Next time I will use regular milk to not get that cream taste.

Used corn off the cob left over from the from the previous nights dinner, a bit more of the bacon(fried crispy) grease and doubled the recipe in a large stock pot. Brought o a nice simmer and let things thicken, then to a very low simmer for a few hours, stirring every so often. Sooooooo good! The secret ingredient? ... a sprinkle or two of ground nutmeg to taste.

Sorry - didn't care for this, changed it very little, doubled the bacon used 2/3 creamed corn and 1/3 whole kernel, tasted like cream corn, with some bacon and potatoes, not what I like in a chowder, will keep searching.

I love this soup.  The only thing I added were a couple of chicken bullion cubes, which changed it from an ok soup to amazing.  If this were at a restaurant I would go there just for this soup.

This came out really great! I had to cut the recipe in half because I only had two potatoes and I didn't want anything to be unproportional. Great flavor, and I would suggest adding a little crispy bacon to the top as well as cooking it in the chowder. Some reviews say it was soupy, but before you add the cream at the end, it is pretty thick and it taste great so you can probably adjust the thickness by how much cream you add in. I did not add it all and it left it a nice chowder consistency. My only complaint is that I wasn't able to make a full pot! Served with homemade dinner rolls.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did as other reviews suggested by using chicken stock instead of water, adding a can of corn kernels along with the creamed corn, and also keeping the bacon to sprinkle on at the end so that it retains it's crispiness.   After I added the half and half at the end, I felt it watered down the chowder consistency to more of a soup, but by the next day the consistency was back up to being thick and creamy like a chowder.  Will definitely make again.  A simple, tasty soup for cold winter nights.  Thanks!

I made this for my Grandma and she said it was really good. The only suggestion she had was not to use cheap canned cream corn, the better the brand the better quality of corn.

Delish!  I followed the recipe exactly except I left the bacon out for a garnish as other reviewers suggested and did use 1 cup of regular canned corn instead of all creamed corn. It was definitely not a thick chowder, more soupy. Served with crescent rolls and a salad for a perfect winter night meal. Had plenty left to freeze too.

Another great recipe that you can tweak to your taste.  I added 2 cans of creamed corn but only a half can of whole corn.  Used an extra potato and 2% milk.  I put the bacon on as a topper when placed in the bowl.  It is a sweet soup but very good for a cold winter night.

This is a very good corn chowder recipe. The few changes I made were - added 2 chicken bouillon cubes for more flavor, 1 cup cream in place of 2 cups half & half (didn't need more liquid), and Lawry's seasoning salt instead of regular salt.

This dish is very easy to make and super delicious!  My whole family (kids included) thoroughly enjoyed it.  I only made 2 minor changes. 1) I used 2 cans creamed corn and 1 can whole kernel corn for extra crunch. 2) I would add the bacon towards the end to keep it from getting soggy.  YUMMY!!!!

Had a WICKED craving for corn chowder for some reason, and this fit the bill.  This chowder is rich, creamy, and sweet.  Next time I make it I will add more potatoes and things because I like chowders more chunky, but that is just personal preference.   A nice thing about this recipe is that it was easy to slim down a bit for my diet!  I used fat-free half and half and Canadian bacon instead of regular, and you would never know the difference!  Such great comfort food :)

This was great but I will add more potatoes next time.  I used turkey ham instead of bacon, 2 cans of creamed corn and one can of regular corn, like some of the others.  It has a really good flavor.

Excellent soup!  As others have said I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also used 2 cans of cream corn and increased the potatoes.  Since I bought a new "toy" that I wanted to try out............. after the potatoes were cooked I then used my new Smart Stick Hand Blender. (best buy I ever made) Just enough to break the potatoes down -it instantly thickened up the soup  - I then added a can of kernel corn.  Just before serving I added just one cup of half and half - that was plenty.  My husband was in heaven!  Thanks so much!

This was excellent! I've never had corn chowder before, but this recipe is super easy to make. The only change I would make to this recipe would be to use canned corn instead of the canned creamed corn, but only because it had a slightly sweet taste. It was still great, but I think it would even better made this way.

This was good!  I'm a health freak when it comes to food and I was going to change things around but, only changed chicken broth for the water.  Decided to leave the bacon and half & half and I'm glad I did.  The flavors were remarkable.  Easy and a hearty soup on a cold winter day.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is the first chowder I have ever made, and it is delicious!  I used chicken broth for the water since I needed to use it up; otherwise I followed the recipe to a T.  A definite keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe numerous times and it comes out great every time.  For the most part, I follow the recipe but I don't love to measure cups so I put in a whole package of bacon, two cans of chicken broth, two cans of cream corn, one can of sweet whole kernel corn (undrained).  Sometimes I'll sub the 1/2 and 1/2 with 2% and sometimes I'll sub the bacon with deli turkey, just depends on what I have on hand!  It turns out fabulous every time!!!!

I made this today in the crock pot (all day on low), with two changes suggested by other reviewers:  chicken broth instead of water, and 1/2 cup butter.  I added the half-and-half about 20 minutes before serving.  This was goooood!

A good base recipe.  I thought it was too watery - next time I'll use corn starch or flour to thicken it or use less broth (I used broth instead of water).  I also think it could use some red or green peppers to add flavor.  Needs some more flavor, not sure yet what.  Will make again!

This was a great recipe.  I altered it by using Turkey bacon and 3 large potatoes instead of the 4 small ones it calls for, and I left the skins on the potatos.  It turned into more of a corn and potato chowder, but it tasted great and it was easy.  I served it with corn bread which added to it perfectly.

This is a super recipe for corn chowder. I used chicken stock in place of water in the basic recipe, and freshly ground pepper ( use commercial grinders) and sea salt. It was really good, all bowls were cleaned. Super Recipe.

Made this for my family last night for dinner.  It was quick and easy which helps on a tight schedule.  The chowder was really yummy.  I added the chicken broth, butter, and more bacon as others had mentioned.  Turned out delicious!!!  Can't wait to have leftovers for lunch.

I used extra bacon, chicken bouillon in the water, and 2 cans kernel corn and one can creamed.  It was delicious, but made a ton!  I also put a hand full of shredded cheddar on top of each bowl.

I really like the flavor of the chowder. It was slightly sweet from the corn but also savory because of the bacon and onions. The potatoes were great as far as creating a nice texture and making the soup a little heartier. I would definitely make this soup again, especially on a cold winter day. Unfortunately, it was 83 degrees on the day I decided to make it for the first time!

If it has bacon in it it must be good.  And it was.  I made this for a group of us on a cold Saturday afternoon and I can't wait to make it again.  It was so rich and flavorful.  I used chicken stock instead of water, and 1 can of creamstyle corn and one can of whole kernal corn.  I liked that I could see the corn and the texture the whole kernals provided.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I may try to thicken it, but not too much.

Easy to make and used ingredients I had on hand - not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I did follow some of the readers' suggestions and use 2 cans of creamed corn to 1 can whole corn, plus use chicken boulion instead of water and added in a chopped up chicken breast.  I will continue to look for a recipe that compares to the Chunky Soup canned version!  :-)

Really good chowder!  I added some previously made garlic butter when frying the onions and potatoes in the beginning and used a can of condensed milk combined with powdered milk for I had multiplied the recipe to feed 20 people and it was cheaper to do the dairy that way.  Everyone loved, even those who didn't care for corn so much ate it.  :)

I used this in the restaurant, i added a stick of butter and a little more bacon grease.  Was told it was the best corn chowder people had ever had, great recipe, thanks would recommend this to anyone.

So simple and delicious. My husband and I both loved this recipe. We altered it a bit. We used low sodium chicken stock instead of water, omitted the salt, and used fat free half and half. Yum.

We loved it. I didn't do the bacon because we didn't have any in the fridge, but it still turned out fantastic!!  I used one can of creamed corn and one can of regular corn! total hit, leftovers were amazing!

Outstanding basic recipe. It's easy and you can really doctor it up by adding ham, roasted chicken or crabmeat. Great recipes. To cut back on some of the sweetness of the corn i buy the no sugar added.

This is a great recipe! Thanks for posting it.

I love how easy it is, and it turns out great every time. I usually add more creamed corn than listed, and also put in some frozen kernel corn. Great flavor!

This was EXCELLENT soup!  I made this on a very cold & snowy day...it warmed me inside & out! I also used chicken broth in place of the water & 1 can of regular corn with 2 cans of creamed corn.  I used regular idaho potatoes & smashed them in the soup when they were tender.  This recipe is a keeper!

Very yummy and really hit the spot.  I did use chicken stock instead of water and a little bit of pepper sauce.  I also added a chopped red bell pepper to the onions and potatoes because I had one and decided the added color would be a nice touch.

This soup came out great! I used chicken broth instead of water, and 2 cans of creamed corn, & one can of undrained kernel corn.  I also sprinkled a little cayenne pepper for some flavor.  Next time I will put shredded chicken in it, that would've made it even better!

Great!  It tastes even better reheated.  I wanted to have less saturated fat so used turkey bacon with olive oil.

I made this recipe for my husband and we both loved it.  It wasn't quite as thick as I had imagined but it still had great flavor.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and I used diced ham in place of the bacon, but added some olive oil when initially cooking the onions and potatoes.  We'll definitely try it again!

This was great!! I've never made corn chowder before and I'm so glad I picked such a good recipe. I followed the ingredients but changed up how I cooked it. 

First I boiled the potatoes and onion in chicken broth (used rather than water). Once they cooked for about 10 minutes, I added in the bacon, 1 can of creamed corn, and the 1/2 & 1/2 with 2 tbsp. of floour whisked in. Heated through and topped with cheese! Wonderful!

I used a can of creamed corn and a cup of frozen corn.  Substituted a can of low sodium chicken broth for water.  For color, I added some chopped roasted red bell pepper.  Very easy recipe.

This is super-good and super-easy!  I use two cans of creamed corn and usually add some frozen corn, too.  My biggest recommendation is to add thyme with the salt and pepper.  This always gets rave reviews no matter who I make it for!

wonderful recipe.  It goes together well, and doesn't look like much till its done simmering.  The color is ok, but what is important is the taste.  Only suggestion I can make is salt.  I don't like salt, but I added a bit more to this recipe.  It really reveals the flavor..

Excellant ! I did use Mc Cormick's Bacon Bits in a little veg oil in place of the bacon/drippings. I also used to cans of creamed corn and added some leftover corn off the cobb. My family all loved it.

Very good. I didn’t have creamed corn - wanted to use some frozen garden corn - so I made a roux with the milk and added it at the end.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Perfection! My boyfriend loves corn chowder and he loves when I make this! I do it at least every 3 weeks (obviously not too often so he doesn’t get tired of it)... my 2.5 year old also approves! It’s simple, fast and tastes sooooo good!

My family loved this soup. Even  Awesome Son #3, who dislikes corn. I did add a finely diced poblano pepper just because I was in the mood for it.

incredibly easy to make, simple ingredients, but simply fantastic. I did make a few changes/additions. I used chives and celery instead of onions. Also I added graded carrot for a some color about a 1/4 cup.

Loved it. Halved the recipe, used chicken broth instead of water and eyed the salt and pepper. I told my husband I am making this every week from now on.

This was my first time making corn chowder and I followed the recipe exactly.
I was a little nervous but this turned out beautifully. So delicious! 
Will definitely be making it again... and again!

Says i made it one time  made this recipie double batch at least six times. Its a huge hit with my teens! Its amazing. We love it! Thank you. For a family of five a double batch works perfect i give two cups each  serving and usually my whole fam besides me had a second helping with about two servings left over. Have fun. Very easy.

This is my second review on this favorite. I added a fifth potato, it was one too many. My only other chance was low sodium chicken broth instead of water. Just wish my husband like it better. I make it, have some then give the rest away. My married kids like when I bring them some-a bonus supper.

It was delicious. My daughter doesn't eat onions so I substituted boiling onions. It was such a hit with everyone, which almost never happens. They all wanted more and there wasn't any left. Thank you!

It is a great base recipe. I had fresh corn from my garden so I used 3 cups of that along with one can of creamed corn. I prefer whole corn over creamed, and I used vegetable stock I had left over in place of water.  I also added a small red bell pepper to give it a southwestern taste! I used a potato masher to 'cream' it, leaving it more lumpy and less creamy.

Quick, easy,  and yummy.  My family will only eat bacon by itself not in anything, so I used salt pork instead.  Also  they like more potatoes and corn.

Make mine with ham, 2 cans creamed and 1 can whole kernel corn.  My kids don’t like watery soups, so I add some potato flakes to thicken it up. Amazing on a cold winter’s night!

This was pretty good.  I like my chowder chunkier, so next time I plan to add more corn and potatoes.  And probably slightly more seasoning, but a very good flavorful base for adjusting to your preferences.

This is one of the most simple soup recipe that has an abundance of flavor! One of my families favorites! I usually add more bacon and add back some of the drained off bacon grease while the bacon, onions and potatoes are cooking.

There are some true idiots posting feedback.  They change everything about the recipe and then give it a low rating.  Maybe they shouldn't be allowed near a computer.  That being said, this chowder was easy, full of flavor, and quick.  I give it Five Well Deserved Stars!

i kinda made it...used this as a base then: substituted turkey bacon because that's what my kids prefer, substituted frozen corn for canned, added a small ham steak, carrots, celery, chicken broth, shredded cheese, sage, thyme & garlic powder. i'd post a new recipe except that i cook by sight & taste & tend to not measure much. it was a huge hit with my boys, their friends & my parents...i made a lot but it didn't last long!

Great chowder for cold weather! I used 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup water in place of the 2 cups of water. Also added ham and an additional 14oz can of regular corn. Soul food! Made alongside biscuits and a caesar salad... the perfect autumn dinner! Creamy, sweet, deliciousness!

This made a great recipe base for my corn chowder. I did make a few changes.  Used chopped cooked chicken instead of bacon, used chicken broth instead of water, added garlic powder and a little celery.  Will definitely be making this again!

I followed the directions exactly, but no one at my house liked this soup. It was very bland and starchy.

This was a very tasty chowder.  I did substitute chicken broth for the water.  I’m going to keep it in my recipe box!

Awesome chowder recipe!  Altered a bit using chicken broth instead of water, as suggested by others, but I also added some Old Bay seasoning.  It gave it just a little bit of something extra.  Delish!!

I made this as directed but with 2 cups vegetable broth instead of water. It was nothing special. Not think enough to be called chowder.

Creamy and delicious!  I put a strip of roasted red pepper like it looks in the picture.  A good touch!  Kept the recipe.
Makes a lot so shared with family.  I am trying to freeze some portions.  Not sure of the outcome.

This was great! I followed the recipe and the suggestion to use chicken broth instead of water. The chicken broth adds another layer of flavor.  This was my first time making corn chowder and I will be using this recipe to make it again.

Okay, what’s with the lower ratings. This stuff is made by the hands of the God’s.  Be thankful they left the recipe. Extremely good right out of the box as they say. I used Yukon golds, and a hint of chili powder, and a hint of my signature garnish.....a whiff of paprika for color only.

It was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. It was so easy. Initially, as it was cooking and I was tasting to season, it appeared bland. It wasn’t until it was finished that I remember the taste (generally in soups) develops as it settles. Once on the dinner table, it was scrumptious.

Family friendly & versatile....can easily add or subtract ingredients successfully. Great as written. I like to shred the potatoes & add a chopped green pepper & sometimes a can of chopped chicken. I use 4 cups chicken broth in place of water with the frozen corn, decrease the salt to about 1 tsp, precook the bacon & add it at the very end to keep it crispy. It doesn't need a thickener if the potatoes are shredded.  Milk works just fine if you do not have half & half & I don't bother warming the milk before adding it. This is a family favorite!

I looked through many recipes for corn chowder and decided to go with this one based on the reviews.  SO GLAD I DID!!!  It truly was amazing!!  I cooked an entire pound of bacon instead of the called for 1/4 cup, substituted chicken broth for water and added some shredded cheddar cheese.  It was so good I made it a second time a week later and passed out a container to a few friends who also raved about it.  I will def be making this again!

Love it. Been making it for few years now and it's one of my family favorites. I throw one less can of cream corn and add a small bag of frozen corn. Sometimes I add a can of chicken broth. Always a hit

A hearty version of corn chowder! I added green onions at the end because I had some to use up and I served it with a cheddar soda bread (also on Allrecipes). I liked that I had the ingredients on hand and it was fairly quick to make, everything took about 45 minutes.

This was a big hit with my coworkers. Paired well with corn bread. I substituted chicken broth for water. I also added 1/2 cup of carrots, 1/2 cup of celery, 1 bay leaf and 1 tbsp cornstarch to thicken. I used 2 cans of cream style corn and 1 can of whole corn. I placed all of the ingredients in my slow cooker and cooked overnight.

I made this last night. All 3 of my children loved it! This dish is definitely a keeper. Can’t wait to make it for friends. I made it according to the recipe but I also added a 1/4tsp of cayenne pepper and subbed the water for bone broth. It surprised me as I didn’t expect it to be as flavorful as it was.

This was very good and not overly creamy. Had it on a cold winter's night and it "hit the spot".....  not sure about the portion size though.... I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and hardly had enough for lunch the next day!  We obviously enjoyed it!  Made exactly as written.

Made it this weekend for guests — absolutely delicious. Was like a warm hug with every spoonful. I made it with 3 cans of cream corn, some sauteed green pepper and onions and added paprika  to give it a little kick.

This is an amazing recipe. I did use some of the suggestions made by others. I doubled the recipe. I made a rue after cooking potatoes and onions with 6Tablespoons butter and 6 Tablesppons flour mixed with 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, then gradually adding 4 cups chicken broth while thickening after each addition. I used 3 cans creamed corn and 2 cans sweet whole kernal corn. I added 1/2 Tablespoon of parsley for color. Heavy whipping cream went on sale after Thanksgiving in our area for 25 cents a cup. I bought 4 at that price and came to Allrecipes to find a soup I could make to use the heavy whipping cream. We garnished with shredded cheddar cheese and bacon bits. My family and I loved it and we will make this again.  I have no doubt the original recipe is just as good and plan to make it as written in the future. Thank you for sharing your grandmother's recipe.

I used chicken broth and3.25 percent milk and cooked it all at the same time and used a bit of flour to thicken near the end if needed. also used celery chopped up and browned in butter and flour then added to the soup. also
 simmer for a while longer to bring the flavours together better.

I have to admit- this recipe is REALLY  good just as written! I actually slightly regret taking some other suggestions in the reviews, because this is excellent exactly as written! Not too heavy, not at all too 'watery' or bland- it is tasety & pretty filling! Good flavor & really good in a bread bowl.

This was a great "chowda". Thank you. Second time around we used half the cream that was called for and added some lightly seasoned sauteed shrimp and red pepper. Hits the spot!

This is my family's favorite soup! I do a few changes as others have suggested. I use chicken broth instead of water,  and substituted 1 cream corn for 1 whole corn undrained. Other than that it's perfect as is.

This was easy to make, but I was worried it would be a little bland after reading reviews, so I took some advice from the comments and added my own twist on it.
-add 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water
-2 cans sweet corn (whole kernel)
-2 cans creamed corn
-add fresh parsley, white pepper, nutmeg, garlic powder and onion powder
-add 1 red bell pepper
-use applewood smoked bacon, the thickness and flavor of the bacon add a lot of taste!!
-add 1/4-1/2 cup cheddar cheese

SO GOOD WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS!!!

Delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly, taking what I thought looked good from other reviewers as well. Used chicken broth instead of water, made a roux from butter and flour before adding the cream, and then mixing with the chowder, added whole kernel frozen corn along with the cream-style corn. My picky kids who never like ANYthing except pasta loved this, and the adults I served came back for seconds and thirds. A big success.

The rating is the recipe as is.  I changed it a little for our tastes.  I added celery, 2 chick bouillon cubes, less salt due to the cubes, and added some frozen corn to give some whole corn too.  My husband liked it since he is a "corn baby." Also added crumbled crisp bacon on top instead of "in" the soup.

Delicious!  I didn't have cream corn but I did have corn on the cob so I made cream corn with them (used another AllRecipes for that).   Also, I used chicken stock in place of the water.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out well.  Very easy and very delicious!

Very good soup. I added chopped celery with leaves for personal taste. I only had one can of cream corn so I added about 1 cup of frozen corn. I was concerned about the amount of salt that it would be too salty so I cut back to 11/2 tsp. it was a mistake. Next time I will follow the recipe. Try this soup you won't be disappointed.

To save on calories - and also see very little difference in taste - use evaporated milk instead of the half and half.   Also, to add zing to this because the potatoes/milk can be bland, add diced fresh red peppers to it.

This chowder was good, but not worth the effort or the money. I opted out on the bacon and put some vegetable oil in the pot with the potatoes and onion instead. Then, I used one can of creamed corn, and one can of regular. If you make this recipe, I assume that's the way to go, so the chowder isn't too mushy. I followed the rest of the recipe, but at the end, the consistency was very thin. I added some cornstarch in hopes of thickening it up, but it clumped together and didn't help the soup at all. Overall, the flavor was good, but I wouldn't make the recipe again. Instead, I recommend a cheaper option of Pregresso corn chowder soup.

Pretty good base recipe.  IMHO, it goes to 5 stars with the addition of a drained can of jalapeno pepper slices and using corn niblets instead of creamed corn.  Now, with fresh corn in the mix , we'd probably have to change the rating system to accommodate a 6th star.

Maybe I'm just not a  chowder expert, but this was way too wet for me! Next time I'd add in a thing of caned corn, maybe go with more potatoes (needed closer to 35 mins to get them tender). I did sub in some of the water with rabbit/chicken broth. Over all it tasted good!

This was okay, but nothing I would make again.  My parents used to make this with butter and no bacon...I think I prefer it that way and probably about the same amount of fat either way.  It was okay, just nothing spectacular.

This is a good recipe.  I substituted chicken stock for the water as most did.  Needs more corn in my opinion.  I would add fresh corn as well as the creamed corn next time.  I also added a head of freshly minced garlic, which turned out to be a good move (if you are a garlic fan as I am).  I added the garlic at the same time as the recipe calls for the potatoes and onions to be added to let then caramelize a bit before the liquid was added.

Made it for the holiday and it was a great hit. Definitely use chicken broth instead of water. It's a chowder for goodness sake. Added some leftover ham from Christmas dinner and it was just as good (or better) as leftovers!

I followed some of the suggestion for edits - used vegetable broth, instead of water, omitted bacon (my husband's a vegetarian), used 2 cans of creamed corn and one can of whole kernal corn, added just 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 and added some cornstarch & water to thicken (with less calories) - came out great!  I will definitely make this again - it's tasty and quick.

I made this soup just as the recipe called for and we loved it.  It was seasoned just right and really was a lovely meal.  It didn't take long to make and I love that.  Now have enough for another meal and with French bread it completes the meal.

Big fans of this soup.  I don't like soggy bacon so we always use chicken instead.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.

Really good chowder.     Even better if you make and serve it the next day.    Reserve the bacon to add to your bowl when you heat and serve it.    I did use the chicken broth along with some of the water and thickened it a bit with a butter/flour roux.    Enjoyed by all.

It was delicious.  I've never made corn chowder before.  I threw in two chicken bullion cubes with the water since all the other reviews liked chicken broth over water.  I was going to use evaporated milk until I couldn't find it in my pantry.  Way to plan, right?  So, 1% milk it was.  Yes, a little watery, not how I would like it but I think the consistency was more on my part then anything about the recipe.  I seasoned the potatoes and onions before adding the water and corn then also added some red pepper flakes for a little heat.  I added the milk  cold to the pot just before serving.

Sweet Jesus.
I have been looking for forever to find a good corn chowder that is comparable to the superb one I used to get at an Italian Delicatessen I worked that. This is it. This is the end of my long search. Though, I did make a few changes:

-Swanson's chicken broth in place of water
-two cups of canned whole kernel golden corn (undrained) and one of creamed corn.
-Let it cook for a while after adding the half and half

You don't really need another review to convince you to make this chowder, but if you did…. Do it!! I just finished eating two big bowls- this was SO DELICIOUS! I made the same adjustment everyone else did… I used chicken broth instead of water, added a third can of corn. Also, I added a little garlic salt cause I put it in everything. One other note I omitted the bacon, and it was still really good! Enjoy!

Great soup, instead of 2 cups of water I added 4 cups of chicken broth, I didn't peel the potatoes and I cut them into larger chunks so that I could cook it in my crock pot.  I cooked the soup for 8 hours, then stirred in the heated half and half and thickened the soup with flour/water.  My family is looking forward to it again.

I love this recipe but always make a few changes to make it my own.  I used red potatoes because I needed to use them up and used chicken broth instead of water to add to the taste.  I also used 2 cans creamed corn and 2 cans kernel corn.  It's also really good if you add some diced trinity peppers.  The more veggies the better!

I add bovril chicken to the water, use 2 cans cream corn and 2 c frozen corn.  Also like diced celery as well as onion and may add any leftover ham.  I use 2% milk instead of half and half.  Delicious and hearty enough for dinner.

Great recipe. Made few changes and the family loves  it. I added unsalted ham and cut it into chuncks, then added it in with the onions and patatoes. I substituted chicken broth instead of water, and finally added 2 cans cream of corn and I can sweet whole corn.

Used chicken stock instead of water, 2% milk instead of half and half, 1 can creamed corn + a 12oz package of frozen corn.  After adding milk, put 2/3 mixture into blender, then stirred back into pot.  (you could puree the whole thing if you don't like it chunky.)  Will definitely make again!

I will definitely make this again.   I made it exactly as written with the following exceptions:    1.  I didn't have cans of cream-style corn so I googled alternatives and it turns out all I had to do was blend (my frozen) corn with a little water  - easy!    2.  I mixed almond milk with whipping cream as that's all I had on hand (50/50).  I didn't use all the cream/milk simply because it looked too milky.   That said, we don't make many creamy soups so it may just be personal preference.    Last, I have a dairy intolerance so I had the soup without the cream/milk.   I still thought it was delicious.   Thanks for the new go-to recipe!

It was very good. Potato to corn ratio was heavier toward potato than expected. Maybe our potatoes were just too big. We will probably make minor changes to skew it more toward corn when we make it the next time. It took 30 minutes instead of 20 minutes to cook the potatoes completely during simmering, probably due to the altitude in Denver. This is a great hot dish on a cold day. A bread side also goes really well with it.

This chowder is delicious!  I always get compliments and requests for the recipe!  My husband is not a big soup person and he loves it!  Instead of making it with 3 cans of cream style corn, I have made it with 2 cans and a can of regular corn (because that's what I had on hand) and it was still perfect!

Admittedly, I didn't follow the exact instructions, but I'm giving it 5 stars because it's a great base recipe. You can't go wrong with this basic list of ingredients and technique.  I used the basic recipe and then added diced carrots, paprika, and a little shake of cayenne pepper.  I had whole corn leftover  to use up, so that's why I made this (I didn't use creamed corn).  I didn't have half and half, so I used a can of evaporated milk.  I fried the bacon with the chopped onion (then crumbled the bacon up), added a few tablespoons of flour to make a rue, and then dumped that into the pot of cooked chopped potatoes and carrots that I cooked in chicken broth. Woolah!  It was delicious!

Followed almost to the T. Have a big family with big appetite so the only changes I made is I added more water about two more cups, used A whole pack of bacon, two more potatoes, and use 2 cups of mashed potato  flakes to thicken it.

This will be a go to recipe. Added more bacon and cooked the onions and potatoes in some of drippings for about 5 min or so. Left skin on potatoes too. I also added a can of extra corn not creamy though. Added 2 chicken boulion cubes as It boiled. It was so delicious, loved it my whole family ate it up. Very filling!

I use  kielbasa  and added some cornstarch at the end. I also used red pepper flakes.  My son loveseat it!! Yeah!!!

I used two 14.5 cans of creamed corn.  Browned potatoes and onions in bacon grease then placed all ingredients in the slow cooker.  The potatoes were very soft after about an hour on high.  Mixed in cream.  I was surprised by how tasty this is--considering no herbs or spices (I omitted salt & pepper).  Very  flavorful balance of potato and corn and the cream adds a smooth richness without be too rich (for me).   I also gave soup a couple mashes with potato masher so it'd be thicker/more how I prefer chowders.

My family LOVED this!  3 teens, elderly woman and middle aged woman scarfed it down!  The only changes I made were to add a bit of cumin to give it a tiny kick, and some carrots to give it a bit more color and nutritional pow.  I'ts already a very hearty soup, but to make it even heartier, I may add some sausage next time.  The only issue?  We had no leftovers because everyone had a second bowl!

My father and I had a chowder cook off for all of our relatives in the summer. He made his famous seafood chowder and I made this recipe. 

His seafood chodwer is always a hit with the family but this won hands down. 

Any time I'm craving corn chowder I make this recipe. If I'm feeding a few people I will throw some celery and carrot in it as filler and it makes it a bit more colorful. 

10/10 woukd recommend it for any occasion

Wonderful start to a soup I tweaked to suit my own taste and ingredients on hand. I didn't peel the potatoes, left them a bit chunkier. I added a couple Tablespoons of powdered chicken soup base to the water and two bay leaves. Used one bag frozen extra sweet whole kernel corn and one can cream corn. White pepper instead of black. 1 cup skim milk and 2 cups heavy cream simmered separately and then added, just as suggested.

Great and easy recipe.  You could play with variations on it in several different ways.  I used chicken broth instead of water, left the skin on the potatoes, added carrots, crumbled sausage instead of bacon, used 1 can whole corn and the water it was packed in along with 2 cans creamed corn and finally added jalapeños for spice.  Low calorie, no, absolutely not.  Worth it on a cool Fall evening, yes, absolutely.

I liked the taste, but I felt that it wasn't thick enough. I would have liked it more if the consistency was different. What would you do to thicken it without changing the taste? Maybe add 1 mashed potato? Overall, good taste. Especially after it sat for a half an hour.

Made this vegetarian with Morningstar faux bacon in place of real. To get fake bacon to "crumbly" texture, I cook in broiler instead of pan and use margarine instead of "drippings".  I also used bullion cubes in water for extra flavors. This is a great simple or starter corn chowder recipe. I also used only 1.5 cups cream as its all I had in house. Overall awesome.

This is a great recipe. I did change a few things, I substituted a 14 oz can of low sodium chicken stock and topped of with 2 oz of water to equal the 2 cups of water. I also used 2 cans of creamed corn and 1 can of sweet corn.

I made this recipe for my husband, using my Instant Pot. I fried the bacon and drained off the grease. I added all ingredients, except for the half and half and pressure cooked for 10 minutes. I then added the half and half and cooked it a little longer. My husband liked it.

I rated it 3 stars because it needed more salt, it could have been thicker, and most importantly, it tasted more like potato soup, than corn chowder.

I will definitely be making this again. The only change I made was put some chicken bullion in when I put the water in......this was very tasty and didn't take very long

Like many I use chicken broth instead of water, add  a couple extra potatoes, and replace one can of creamed  corn with whole corn. I add a few red pepper flakes for a little extra flavor. I get major compliments on this recipe.

I made this chowder today with a few tweaks and it was very good. I followed others reviewers advice and used chicken stock instead of water. I had fresh corn that I cut off the cob and stripped the cobs for the juice. Three cobs made about three cups of corn. Then, we didn't have any half and half and were too lazy to run to the store. I used whole milk and finished the chowder with a couple of tablespoons of butter to add richness. It made a very good chowder and my husband loved it.

I made this 3 times so far.  Exactly as written for bf and myself, and it is wonderful. The bacon gives it a wonderful smokiness. I've also made it vegetarian for my daughter and that was wonderful too, even to the meat eaters....eliminate step one of course, sauté the onion and potatoes in a little butter in step two, and proceed with everything else as written. For both versions I also throw in a small can of whole kernel corn, drained.  For potatoes I use small red potatoes, unpeeled. Delicious!!!!  Both ways this was a total hit!

I didn't have creamed corn so used canned regular and added butter to cooking pot and two tablespoons flour to warmed half & half.  Also added half teaspoon sugar.  Simple, delicious, will make again.  I topped servings with shredded cheese and served with homemade biscuits.

I used to make a recipe almost identical to this years ago. My only change was to add celery instead of the onion. My teenager had seconds so that is the best recommendation I can give!!

This was my first time making chowder and it came out fabulous.. my family loved it. I used chicken stock in place of water.. I added the half and half as the recipe says.. I also used a little bit of corn starch mixed with milk to thicken it up a bit. I used cracked black pepper and sea salt to taste. It an easy,delicious recipe.

Very good! I puréed the whole batch because I needed a no chewing meal. This did the trick beautifully!!  Iwonder how much better it would have been if I had remembered to put the 1/2 & 1/2 in at the end!!!!!

Loved this recipe!  I used the whole pound of bacon and fried the potatoes and onions in all the drippings.  I then added 2 cans creamed corn and 1 bag frozen to a crock pot, adding the potatoes.  Cooked on low for several hours.  I sauteed some crab meat, shrimp and bay scallops in butter on the side for the adults.  Just before serving, a made a roux with butter, flour and evaporated milk and added that to the soup.  I placed the seafood in a bowl and topped it with the corn chowder. The kids enjoyed just the chowder.  It was a huge hit.  Next time I will serve in bread bowls!

I changed this up a little, I stew a chicken then use the broth instead of water and tear the chicken up and add at the end. Also add mushrooms with the other vegetables.  We love it!!

This was a decent corn chowder, although I think it needed a bit more flavor.  Like another reviewer, I also added a butter/flour roux to make it thicker so it was more chowder-like.  I think this would be great to make when corn is in season so it would have that sweeter, fresher taste.

Excellent recipe!  I also boiled a ham hock for an hour in broth, then used that as the base.  I used two cream corn cans and one whole kernel.  This one's a keeper.

First, I caramelized 3/4 of a large yellow onion in country crock butter spread (about 4-10 teaspoons) on medium high heat, enough to prevent onion from sticking to bottom of soup pot. I caramelized thoroughly – past the point of tender to the point of a smoky brown color and smell. Then I added in the 4 medium peeled and chopped (I used Idaho Russet) potatoes and 3 peeled and diced small to medium sized organic (I used Trader Joe’s brand) carrots. I added in some more butter spread to prevent sticking when sautéing the potatoes, carrots and onions. I sautéed the caramelized onion, potatoes and carrots for 10-15 minutes on medium heat. Then I added in 2 cups of warm water, 1 chicken bouillon cube, ½ cup of McCormick’s fake bacon bits and 2 (14.5 oz.) cans of cream style corn. I omitted the salt & pepper since I like my chowder sweet. I brought the chowder to a brief boil and then turned to “low” (2-3).  I simmered for 40 mins or more, stirring occasionally. When the potatoes were tender – I used an immersion hand blender to briefly blend the now tender chunks of potatoes and carrots. I substituted the half and half by adding 2 tablespoons of the butter spread and 2 cups of 2% milk. I served the chowder with chopped green onion, oyster crackers and a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a little zing. It tasted amazing!

A pretty good recipe.  I like my chowder to be a little thicker than this one though.  However, I did like it overall.  When I made it, I used 1 cup of water and 1 cup of chicken broth instead of the suggested 2 cups of water.  I feel like that was the right choice for my taste.  I only had Russet potatoes which worked fine but I think the suggested red potatoes would have been better if you have them on hand.  I felt like there should have been more corn in it.  Next time I think I will add 4.5 cups of creamed corn instead of the suggested 3 cups.  As with any recipe I find, I would also recommend using a little bit more bacon than the suggested amount ;) Nice recipe overall though.

I'm making this for my family, plus an army of band students... so doubled the recipe, plus added 1lb chopped chicken breast, to make it more of a meal. Used 2 chubs of cream corn (20oz) plus 2 cups frozen whole corn. Very yummy!! I used used chicken broth + water to cook the potatoes. When it cooks down, using whole milk and real butter, for economy. I sauteed the bacon with onion and chicken, to save time - mistake. You really need to render the bacon fat and make the bacon crisp. Still, it's still an excellent recipe.

Spot on!  Many thanks poster for this one.  It turns out beautifully just as is.  Simple to make and easy.  The only small change I made was I added a tsp or so of cooking oil as the bacon I had was not putting out much in the way of drippings.  Everything else was perfect.  Awesome flavor.  Will definitely be making this one again and again.

Good recipe, but I like when I used frozen corn instead of canned corn. Also, I needed to some how make it thicker.  Other than that it was really good.

Yummy and easy for this novice cook. 
I peeked at some of the others recipes since I don't eat meat and used 1/2 c of coconut oil and 2 tsp of thyme for extra flavor. I'm making it again tonight.

Was extremely good.. I to added chicken stock instead of water. I also added 4 cloves of garlic and mushrooms. While cooking the potatoes n such I also added about 1/2 of margerine.. Goes very well with my grand mothers buttermilk bisquits as well :) I also used all the bacon grease I had left.

I made this recipe last night. I changed a couple of things. I used 3 cans of creamed corn, and I used butter in place of bacon fat and I used  1/2 water & 1/2  chicken stock.This was the best corn chowder I have ever made & better than any restaurant.Try it you will love it.

This soup was absolutely fabulous before I added the half and half. It was much more flavorful and thicker like I prefer my soups to be. After I added the half and half I immediately regretted it. Will be making this again. Also, my modifications included adding a chopped cooked chicken breast which I cooked in the bacon grease after cooking the bacon and I added four green onions instead of a whole diced onion. I added more than two tablespoons of the bacon grease as well. Again, would only add maybe half a cup of half and half next time.

Great corn chowder recipe. I gave it four stars only because I did make some changes that other have mentioned that I believe made it a bit better than the recipe as written. First of all, I doubled the bacon for my bacon loving husband. I did as others have mentioned... used chicken stock instead of water and I used two cans of creamed corn and one of regular corn that I did not drain. We really enjoyed this chowder and my husband and son both requested that I make it again. I think this is a very versatile recipe that you could experiment with.

I substituted 2 cups water and 2 cups half and half for 4 cups milk, because it's what I had on hand, and it worked well! I don't love cream corn so used non-cream. My suggestions: add bacon at the END so it's still crispy, add garlic, ADD THYME!

Very simple but delicious... My kids and husband ate so much my husband was afraid he wasn't going to have enough for lunch the next day... I did switch it up a little and used what I had. I used ham instead of bacon and cannot wait to try it with bacon... I think both would taste amazing!!!

This was awesome I pretty much followed the recipe . The only thing I did different was I used all the bacon grease I didn't drain any of it.  I used water no chicken broth. I used two cans of cream style corn and I used an ear of corn in the cob.   Came out great just like my grandpa used to make

I enjoyed this recipe.  I made a few changes, by using ham I had cooked the day before.  I used about a 1/2 cup of chopped, raw bacon and let it crisp in the pan.  I left the bacon and all the grease in, then added the diced potatoes (used 3 instead of 4), chopped onion and diced up ham.  Once the potatoes began to brown, I transferred all of that to the crock pot and let cook for 7 hours.  I used chicken stock instead of water and also added a TSP of garlic powder and thyme.  Added the half and half at the end like you suggested.  Great recipe!  My family loved it.

Replaced the bacon drippings with oil to make this vegetarian friendly. Also, to make up for the lost flavor of the bacon, I added a few sprigs or thyme one time, and a sprig of rosemary another time. Loved it!

This recipe was awesome. The only change I made was to use two cups of frozen corn as well as the two cans of creamed corn. I should have used more bacon though because I ended up with more than the eight servings that this makes. Next time I'll know better. We really loved this!

This was an awesome recipe! My husband said this dish ranked right up there as one of his all time favorite dishes I've made!! Only change was to use chicken broth instead of water and one leek instead of the onion because we just got leeks from our CSA and I needed to use it. Will be making this in bigger batches next time!

So. Much. Corn. I give it 3 stars because my husband liked it enough to eat it, but I just felt like I was eating a bowl of overcooked corn.

This was very good, but next time I'll try a few things different.  I prefer it with more corn so I added another can of creamed corn.  Next time I'll try 2 cans of creamed corn and 1 can regular corn.  I also thought it could use a bit more flavor so I'll take others' recommendations and use chicken broth instead of water.  But overall it was very good and very easy.

This recipe is easy to make and it is delicious.  It is so fast that is has become a regular in our household.  The only change I made was adding cornstarch to the mixture, after adding the cream.  I prefer my soups thick and creamy!

This was awesome chowder,Ive always loved corn chowder however, This was the first time making it. This was so easy to make. I added a teaspoon of bacon drippings. The flavor was perfect.I must say it was better the next day when reheated :).  This is a recipe that I will pass down to my kids and grandkids, Thank you for sharing.

I love this recipe as a basis for what it can become. First off, I replaced the water with chicken broth. I only added one can of cream of corn and add the rest with frozen corn. ( I added a lot because I love it thick!)Then I added one package of KNORR Vegetable Recipe Mix. I also substituted Heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. I only added a half a cup of that. It turned out Amazing! :D

Love this recipe and have been using it for a couple years. 
I've made some modifications: 3 cans of creamed corn, 2 cans of sweet corn, chicken broth substituted for the water and several more potatoes. (My family loves a hearty meal!) 
It tastes delicious and the leftovers never last long!!!

Awesome! I'm super busy btwn full time job, my AdvoCare bzn, and family of 5 BLUE. I just threw everything in the crockpot: potatoes onions and cut raw bacon stirred with water to cover, then creamed corn on top. Put it on low overnight and it turned out fabulous this morning. Just got to add in coconut milk (dairy free/less calories) when I get home and we're good to go for a great rainy day dinner.

This soup was easy to make and perfect for a cold day.  It took a little longer to get the potatoes soft than the recipe says. I would also add a little more bacon than the recipe says.

This didn't work well for me even using chicken stock instead of water, but it was also my first try with corn chowder.  I found it pretty bland and thin.  I incorporated a simple roux of flour and butter which provided a decent thickening effect.

Corn chowder is a childhood comfort food for me, but it never tasted this good! Followed the prep directions exactly, but changed some of the ingredients. I doubled the bacon (1 cup), added fresh corn, subbed water for chicken broth, and added a touch of store bought demi glace. Also, loaded it up with freshly cracked pepper, topped it with fresh cilantro and a touch of sour cream. These small changes made for an exquisite bowl of comfort. I froze it to see if it would keep for later, but it just didn't taste the same.

Perfect for a New England rainy day! Good consistency - not too thick and not too watery. Biscuits on the side were the perfect addition.

I felt this needed some flour to thicken it up.  Otherwise it tasted fine.  I topped it with cheddar and green onions.

This turned out great!  I left out the bacon and added a couple of extra pinches of salt and sugar.  I also used skim milk and two tablespoons of cornstarch in addition to the flour in the recipe to make the soup a bit thicker.  Only used 4 potatoes, though I'm sure 6 would have been fine.  I cooked it on high for about 30 minutes until the veggies were mashable, then used my potato mashed to break up the veggies in the soup.

When it was done, I thought it was a bit bland (I'm sure part of this is because I didn't use bacon), so I added several shakes of ground pepper and about 4-5 jalapeno slices from the jar, along with about 6 tablespoons of the jalapeno juice.  It added a nice subtle kick without being too overpowering.

May try it next time with the bacon, or even used cubed ham.  I thought canned green chiles might be good, too, for a SW style soup. Will definitely be keeping this recipe around for future use!

This was pretty good although it didn't taste how I expected...  I basically followed the recipe but added a couple of things so it would taste like the flavor I love from scalloped corn-- 1/2 green pepper, 1/4 red pepper, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp. dry mustard.  I also used a little bit more of the bacon grease than called for.  The end result was pretty tasty but I would have added in more corn for sure... still seems like it is missing something but I am not sure what. 
Oh--and I also added chicken bullion to the water.

Instead of bacon I use ham or polish sausage.  I also added some diced green and red pepper and added a teaspoon of Tabasco for a little extra kick.  One of my family's favorites.

Just made this soup, Fabulous! I made a few changes to make it a little more figure friendly. I used low sodium chicken stock rather than water, added 1 cup of frozen corn, and only added 3/4 of a cup of fat free 1/2 and 1/2. I also added some dried thyme. The soup was rich and delicious .

BEST EVER!  This tasted just like Mimi's corn chowder, with a ton more pepper.  I'm a pepper monkey, so it was nice to add as much as I like.  Fed my mother, brother, and boyfriend.  All of them loved it.

Great base recipe for corn chowder. I added 3/4 teaspoon of ground cumin and 1 teaspoon of dried thyme for extra flavor. I like having more bite in my corn chowder, so I used one less can of cream-style corn and added one can of corn kernels. An excellent dinner or appetizer soup!

This chowder was exactly what I was looking for--a simple, traditional corn chowder that is thick and flavorful.  I did follow some other reviewer's suggestions and used chicken broth instead of water, and thickened with about 1/4 c of mashed potato flakes.  I also used 2 cans of cream style corn and 1 can of whole kernal corn.  My kids asked for seconds and ate it again the next day.  Even my husband who is not fond of chowders said it was good and ate 2 bowls!  Thanks for the great recipe--this one's a keeper.

Very tasty, warm, stick-to-your-ribs soup.  The soup could be spiced up a bit (I'm not good with spices, so not sure which spice, but the taste as is is missing something, it's too "even" though I would not say bland).  We will definitely make this again.

The chowder is very good! I only had two potatoes, so I don't think it was as creamy as it would have been with four.  As the potatoes cooked, I smashed them a little with a spoon to help thicken the chowder.  Also, I added some cilantro toward the end.  This added perfection!

AWESOME!  I didn't add the water but instead added two cans of regular corn not drained. This recipe was so simple and soooooo yummy!  My husband said this should go in the regular rotation!

This was pretty good although I thought it would be better based on the reviews. I added more bacon and used chicken broth instead of water. I also added shredded cheddar cheese when I served it.

I made this exactly as the recipe said to.  To me it lacked alot of flavor.  I will make it again, but I will substitute chicken stock for the water.  I will also not mix the bacon in until the end so that it remains crunchy and I think I will add another can of corn that I will drain first.  I prefer a bit more substance to my soup...this was a little too watery.

It needed that little extra something so I chose to season with chicken stock powder instead of the salt. I also used 1 cup half and half and one cup low fat milk. I was a great texture and overall tasty. It's perfect on this damp, cold day!

This soup was very tasty!!!!! I used mostly fressh corn that we had frozen from our summer crop.  I think this  made the soup less creamy than I had hoped for but the taste was VERY good. I doubled the recipe so I found I needed to cook the potatoes longer than stated in the recipe.All in all a definate keeper!!!

Great recipe.. and it can be so easily modified..  I did use chicken stock instead of water and after it was ready I decided to add another can of regular corn (drained) just for personal prefence.  I LOOOVE corn.

I made this recipe by boiling a Moist-N-Tender Stewing Hen that gave me approximately 6-8 cups of broth, then added another 4 cups of broth.  I added 1 1/2 lbs. of boneless chicken breast plus the meat that I was able to pull of the carcus.  I added three cans of cream corn and one can of kernal corn.  I alway put Garlic Plus into everything because it adds so much flavour and just seems to be the finishing touch.  I also added nacho cheese to the finished product.  This is a wonderful base recipe and definitely a keeper.  Thanks to all those that came before me for their alterations to the original recipe.

Another hit.  Grandkids wanted to take leftovers home.  Tastes even better next day.  If it gets too thick, just add a little more broth.

No offense to Grandma, but there was nothing special about this soup. It was ok to my family and I might make it again. I made a healthier version with cubed ham and Vitamin D Milk. I wouldn't think these substitutions would make a huge difference in taste. I'd consider adding some green onions, a chicken boullion cube, and melting in a block of low-fat cream cheese next time.

Definitely good as is. Like other I used chicken broth instead of water.  3 can's of cream style corn.  I actually forgot to add the half and half at the end, and it was still very tasty.  Next time I'm going to try making it with some ham.  Good recipe!!

Super good! instead of getting sliced bacon, I used a slab, that way i could cut the bacon in bigger chuncks. loved it! next time i will not use as much of the grease from the bacon.

Fantabulous!  Followed the recipe to the T and made 12 servings to last for leftovers in lunches during the cooler days here in Colorado!  Will be great with with biscuits... I used Fat Free Half and Half, AND FF Evaporated Milk, and I used turkey bacon.  However, I did have leftover bacon grease, so I used that. I am certain this is even tastier with real bacon, and real half and half.

Made w/ham rather than bacon and chicken broth instead of water.  I've tried so many recipes for corn chowder in the past and none were just right until this one....absolutely the best!!  Won't be trying any others.  This truly is a winner!

Very good, but I'm with those who said they added a little flour to thicken the chowder.  It was a bit too watery for me.

Excellent - even my teenage son, who was badmouthing it before he tasted it, had two bowls! In fact we ALL did!  I made just a couple tweeks: * Used chicken broth for water - as many have suggested. * Added 2 T. butter * Used 1% milk (that's why I added the butter) *Accidently dumped too much pepper in, but, the end result was a nice peppery/spicey kick.  Will do that again!  Easy and a good dinner with crusty bread and a salad!

After eating 2 large bowls of this Chowder, my husband asked if I wrote the recipe down so I could make it again.

My husband didn't seem thrilled when I told him we were having this for dinner. However, he hasn't stopped raving about it since! Even my 3 year old loved it. However, I also used chicken broth instead of water!

This recipe was great. It was a lot of work, but the result was worth it. It is pretty sinful though, lots of calories. Its one of my husbands favorite foods though so we splurge every now and then.

Reduced water to 1 1/2 cups and substituted a can of creamed corn for  undrained whole kernal corn. Added about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to add a kick. Next time will double amount of bacon.

Followed recipes as written. I think next time I will add some hot sauce or hot salsa. The soups tastes good, but we are used to a little kick to our corn chowder. Another easy week night recipe.

This was sooooo tasty and soooo easy!
I didn't even heat up the cream before adding it to my soup, I just poured it straight into it and heated the whole thing through.
I like my soups a bit thicker, so I added a little bit of cornstarch diluted in half and half to thicken it up.

A very good recipe! I did make some changes such as adding 2 cans of creamed corn instead of just one & I substituted chicken broth for the water. I cooked the bacon in a frying pan and then I put the onions and potatoes in the bacon fat and then transferred all ingredients to a crockpot and cooked on Low for 8-9 hours. I did add the half&half at the end as suggested and garnished with shredded cheese and green onion. Everyone loved it!

I love corn chowder but do not have it a whole lot.  Made this recipe today, 1/2 the recipe.  I used chicken bullion and ham plus added extra frozen corn.  Plus added a little chopped bell pepper.  LOVED IT!!  My 2 yr old is chowing it down as we speak.

I loved this recipe it was rich and creamy...but like others I made some simple changes. I doubled the recipe, used frozen creamed corn and fresh corn, and instead of cooking the bacon on the stove I microwaved mine. I put the potatos in the pressure cooker and then when they were done I measured the remaining liquid and added chicken stock to get the required liquid amount. I dumped it all in a pot and simmered for about 20 - 25 minutes. I microwaved the half and half and blended it into the soup and simmered on low heat for about 5 more minutes. Yummy! It was rich and creamy and in my opinion delicious with the half and half. I will make this again but reduce the amount of potatos as I love taste of the corn and bacon. It tasted even better the next day and reheated really well. Yummy!

Just perfect!!! I used chicken stock too instead of water. Next time I would make sure the bacon is VERY crunchy  when adding into the pot. Just came off the stove and so tasty. Usually soups, stews are better the next day but this is great!

This was a good soup, but to me it lacked something.  I followed the recipe but like another reviewer I substituted chicken broth for water.  My kids don't like lots of "potatoe lumps" so before adding the corn and half/half I used beaters to smooth out the potatoes. I will make this again because my kids and husband really liked this chowder.

MMM, yummy! This soup is so tasty and filling. We used chopped Canadian bacon in place of the regular bacon, and I think it made it better--gave it a almost sweet taste. Also, we used milk with a bit of flour rather than half-and-half (we didn't have any on hand), and it turned out just fine. This recipe is a "keeper"! :0)

MMMMM very good soup! I made it with milk instead of half & half. I also thickened it with cornstarch because I was too lazy to get my flour from on top of the cupboards. It was so yummy & even the kids gobbled it up

PERFECT! I have never had corn chowder before or ever made soup...double score!!
Substitutions...used chicken broth for the water, added chopped garlic to the onions, also added scallions..mmmm! One can cream corn 1 can regular corn...Added half-half last and mixed in a little cheddar for color. Thickened with 2 tbsp cornstarch/water......seems like it may be a whole new recipe but its not.
Ooooh the husband ate 3 bowls full...
kudos to grandma!

I chose to combine all the ingredients minus the half and half into a crock pot.  While this was easier to prep, even on high, it took forever to cook.  I wasn't that impressed right away, but after leaving it sit in the refrigerator for a day or two, the left overs were great!  The flavors really came together and made a wonderful chowder.

I thought this was good but my boyfriend thought it was GREAT. Id give it 4.5 stars if I could! I think it just had too strong of a bacon flavor for my taste, I'm def. going to make it again and be more careful with the amount of bacon and drippings I use. :) Also, I added some leftover turkey in it which was a very good addition!

I actually added a lot more salt than called for, and added some garlic salt, more pepper, and put a dash of hot sauce in it for a kick and it turned out pretty good, i didnt use half and half, i used 2% milk and it turned out fabulous, very filling!
