This was absolutely delicious and easy!  I used a little more butter than called for by accident and I think it made it even better!  I toasted the almonds and have also made this with wild rice and it tasted just as great!  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

For something so simple, this was really nice!  I replaced the onion with a very small amount of onion powder, left out the salt and pepper, and next time would slightly reduce the amount of butter as well.  This recipe made a great side dish for Honey Grilled Fish, and it would probably go well with any other flavorful fish as well.  I didn't personally care for the taste of the raisins, but they look beautiful and are easy enough for picky eaters to avoid :-)

I really liked this recipe.  I love just about most rice dishes but love those that have more flavor and this one delivers that.  The only change I made (I just couldn't help myself) is that I added about 3 cloves of crushed garlic and saute that with the onions since that is what I do with my rice.  It was just natural to me.  The kids were not a big fan but I was.

I made this twice so far, and liked it. For some reason I feeled like maybe it might be missing a little something but overall a nice side dish. I think the amount of onion can be cut down slightly and I might try this next time.

The family loved this rice recipe.  I caramelized the onions a bit, which gave the flavor a little extra sweetness.  The almonds were a great additional for texture!

Husband absolutely loved this recipe.  It was easy, goof-proof and I had all the ingredients on hand. Worked super well with roast chicken dinner.   I can see where the "base" of this recipe could support multiple variations of ingredients--really nice addition to plain white rice.  I liked it, just not a big fan of dried fruit in rice.

This was really delicious! I even left out the onion because I ran out, but it was still good. I will make it as directed next time. We ate with Egyptian Moussaka and it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a wonderfully easy recipe that tastes good.  I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins.  It makes a great dish to serve with poultry.

this was delicious and very easy to make. I used veggie broth instead of chicken and toasted the almonds for more falvour. Thanks!

A good accompaniment to fish - I made the recipe as directed except added the almonds with the other ingredients so they would soften. Tasty.

This is so easy and tasty.  I mixed white rice with brown rice and added chopped dried apricots as well for a little variation. The more fiber the better!

I loved this recipe. The raisins and almonds make the rice a little sweet, which was perfect for me. I gave it 4 stars because my husband only thought it was good, not great. He doesn't have my sweet tooth.

I used this as a side dish to serve with some Asian style grilled chicken. The flavour was subtle with a nice crunch from the almonds. It didn't take anything away from the flavour of the main dish. I added half a teaspoon of Tumeric to give the rice a more golden colour. This is a good base to add more flavours if you wish.

Very good rice recipe.  I think it would be better with wild rice instead of white.  I toasted the almonds and used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  Thanks.

This was very good.  I cooked the onions longer until they were caramelized and added a little bit of turmeric and half a cinnamon stick.  It was delicious, even though I forgot the almonds!  (I always cook my rice with a scallion, too).

I have a similar recipe that calls for golden raisins. I made this recipe with regular raisins as directed & if I ever make this recipe again I will definitely use golden raisins. Take my word for it, this will taste so much better if you use golden raisins.

I made it in a traditional rice cooker but cooked the onions and toasted almonds separately and added to rice in the end.  It turned out great!

It was good, and well-liked by my guests.  I felt it needed something, but I don't know what.  Maybe salt.  I didn't add salt because I thought the chicken broth had enough already.

I made this with wild rice and served it with schwarma. While it is flavorful rice, it is a very neutral and versatile flavor that could compliment many dishes.

Easy, versatile and tasty.  Didn't change a thing.
