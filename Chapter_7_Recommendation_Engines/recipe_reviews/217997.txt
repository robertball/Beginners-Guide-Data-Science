I added a few cloves of minced garlic when I layered the ingredients and sprinkled the top with fresh ground pepper. My whole family loved this, especially my youngest kid. I bet this would be good with just about any vegetable you had on hand. I loved how this dish came together.

Wasn't real sure about this one when I saw how few ingredients there were but I did have a small piece of the processed cheese that needed to be used up. Instead of boiling the squash and onions as the directions stated, I put them in a glass bowl and covered loosely with a cover and put it in the microwave for 4 minutes. It was a perfect. Drained well and added to my crockpot. I did also season with salt, pepper and a sprinkle of dried thyme then added the cheese cubes and butter. Cooked on high for 30 minutes, and low for 45. Excellent and different.

Hello I Am Floridabeaches, Poster of the Squash Casserole. And I Did Want To Mention, At Times I Will Add Zuccini To The Yellow Squash Also, To Change Things Up A Bit.  As Others Have Mentioned, It Is Import To Drain Well, And Also Not To Stir Alot, As You Will End Up With A Mushy Mess. And Also To Not Add So Much Cheese That You Cover Up The Taste Of The WonderFul Squash Flavor. This Dish Is Easy, Nice Change, And A WonderFul Flavor.

My family enjoyed this dish. I cooked the vegetables longer in the water than directed in the recipe because the squash were a little older with tougher skin. Make sure to drain them very well so the cheese sauce is not watery. We added salt and pepper to our individual servings because my husband has to watch his salt intake but I think it would benefit from some seasoning while cooking. I think this would also work to cook up the squash and onions, drain well and freeze in portions to complete later. Thanks floridabeaches123.

Well.......  I tried this recipe but instead of using 1/4 pound of Velveeta cheese I added 1 full pound.  I cooked it in the slow cooker, then I dumped the entire thing in 2 separate batches in a blender.  Went from whip to liquify and made a good cheesy soup from it.  The older people that were going to be eating it probably would have had a bad time with the seeds in the squash.  They ALL loved it, certainly a keeper for a nice soup before the main course beef roast.  Makes the roast rest a while, while they eat their soup.  THANKS!!

Has anyone tried just putting the ingredients in the slow cooker without pre-steaming them?

Amazing! I'm thinking about putting some turkey kielbasa on top for a one-pot meal next time.

I made this and it was very good. i didn't have velveeta so, I used shredded cheese blend instead. Sauce did not turn out creamy. But you can't go wrong with cheese. I think next time I make it I may jjust forget the slow cooker. I only had a few squash  and it would make more sense to keep it a one pot wonder. By draining out the water and adding the butter and the cheese I will try to put it back into the same pot and put over oven vent to keep it warm without burning the bottom. The heat from the squash should melt the butter and the cheese.

Did not add cheese for dietary reasons, did not preboil, added some seasonings, family enjoyed it and it was low and slow, so easy.

Very good, do drain off the water well, or the crock pot will be soupy.

This sounds similar to my mom's boiled squash without the cheese. I make it all the time now in a pot on the stove, but again I add no cheese, I cook in a little unsalted chicken broth with onion and garlic and add butter, dill, a drizzle of honey and bacon salt to taste at the end. My favorite summer comfort food. Works well with yellow squash or zucchini.

Super easy and tasty. I did add some garlic powder, salt, and I steamed the squash in the microwave instead of on the stovetop. Hubby tried it served on top of some leftover smoked pork and really liked it.

I made it as stated and it came out pretty tasty. I may tweak it more in the future, cooking the veggies differently and perhaps not using the slow cooker at all. I'll make it again though!

Why go to that trouble when you can make an infinitely more delicious side dish so simply?  Prepare squash as indicated, but add diced Bell pepper and one finely diced jalopeno pepper.  When they are done, add coarse ground black pepper to taste (I like a lot) and a generous amount of garlic powder with coarse chopped cooked bacon and a tablespoon (or more) of mashed capers.  Cover with pepper jack cheese and provolone cheese and heat until melted.  To really give it a pop, heavily sprinkle the squash with Cajun seasoning immediately after draining.  This will titillate your taste buds!

I made this last night, we really enjoyed it. I used zuchinni  instead of yellow. We have made this for years but I never tried it in the crock pot before. I added some minced garlic and some  colored peppers. I also used hot velveeta as we like a little heat. We will be enjoying this again.

Made about a half recipe (three 8"-10" squash). Used a 1" dice for both onion and squash. Worked fine. I had on hand and used shredded Parmesan which gave a very even cheese layer.

Used my (imitation) Instant Pot, which doesn't have a labeled low heat setting.  Used "chicken/meat" for 2 minutes after pressurizing.  Vented; then left on "Warm" until dinner.  Came out great, but next time I'll use 1 minute to leave a little "tooth" in the veggies.
