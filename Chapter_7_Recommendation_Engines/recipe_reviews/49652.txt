very easy. very good. great for people who don't like the taste of liver. but for my spouse and i this was the only negative - not enough liver taste. added a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne for extra spice. if i ever try again will do more to bring up chili flavor.

My husband found this recipe for me to try because he doesn’t like liver, but knows it’s good for people. It’s super simple and I thought tasty.  It’s not outstanding which is why 4 stars, but it is a nice alternative to liver and onions. I served it on rice, and the sauce was nice.
