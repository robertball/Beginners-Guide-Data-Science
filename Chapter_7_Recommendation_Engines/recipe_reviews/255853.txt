The only thing I changed was that I used just milk chocolate chips for the topping as Almond Joy is made with milk chocolate. The cream layer was difficult to make as the marshmallow was hard to stir and I had to work fast to mix in the other ingredients before it got too hard. Any tips to make that part easier would be appreciated. I'm taking them as a donation for a silent auction supporting our youth group for church.

This is simple to make. I wouldn't use a glass baking dish, as it was a bit difficult to remove. Even with the spray. This is very, very, sweet.
