I thought to myself that there is NO WAY this is going to be a great recipe.  I imagined the pork as being way to tender to stand up on it's on.  As a matter of fact it is....bring on the Kimchi.  The contrasting textures are AMAZING.  This dish has me blown away.  The only concern I have is the leftovers.  The pork doesn't really stand up on it's own to well.  A 4 pound roast makes for a lot of leftovers.  I also think I'd add some garlic on the next round.  I'd make it again for sure.

The pork came out very tender, but the flavor was gone.  Very blah.  I find that with every slow cooker  recipe I have ever tried.  9 hours on low must just cook all the flavor out of it.  I'm going to try 5 hrs on high next time, and if that doesn't work, that slow cooker is out.  Anyone else have that issue?

This was delicious.  I used venison and replaced the gochujang, which I couldn't find, with red chili paste.  Making this again, with my own revisions!
