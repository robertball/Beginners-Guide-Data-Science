I've made these several times.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  Good, but need more flavor.  I use panko breadcrumbs, 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt, and about 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper.  These are much better with the added spices to me.  Thanks for the idea!

A good recipe.  Did indeed have some crunch, but not a lot of flavor.  Simple, but not bad.

Fish was very crunchy.  Needed a little bit more flavor added to it.  Otherwise, a pretty good recipe.  If I try it again, I will probably bake it in the oven since I very rarely fry anything in my house.

I can get catfish nuggets from my grocery store for like $1.99/ lb. With that being said, I thought these were good! I did change it slightly after hearing the word "bland" more than once. I first dredged the fish in flour that I seasoned with garlic powder and seasoning salt. Then I dipped into the egg substitute that I kicked up with some hot sauce and then into the breadcrumbs (I used seasoned). I thought these had a good flavor and was very happy with the results! :)

Better than I thought it would be and a lot better than I remember as a kid. I'm not a big catfish fan, but sometimes the budget means going for something cheap. The advise of earlier reviewers to let the nuggets sit a bit before frying really helped. Also, I added a little corn meal to the breading. I may have to try this again.

Pretty easy recipe to follow. Used seafood seasoning and panko breadcrumbs. Came out very crunchy and light.

THESE WERE A LITTLE BLAND GOING BY THE RECIPE. I ADDED SOME FRESH GARLIC AND A 1/2 TSP OLD BAY TO THE BREAD CRUMBS.

This was simple, but needed an extra kick of flavor, so I also added cayenne pepper and the juice of a lemon to the egg.

I've made this more than once now, and I really like it. But my Mrs. isn't a fish fanatic like I am, so to help cut down on the fishiness, I give the catfish a 20-30 minute soak in buttermilk before continuing witth he rest of the recipe. I don't know why, but it does seem to work!

I liked this very much - but being a person who does like spicy foods, added hot sauce to the egg and of course garlic powder to the gluten free bread crumbs.  Came out beautifully from my new fryer and decided to also use my wasabi tarter sauce.

I've made this recipe a few times now & my family loves it! I buy the catfish nuggets at my local store so I don't have to deal with cutting filets. I do add planko to the breadcrumbs as well as garlic powder. Yummy!
