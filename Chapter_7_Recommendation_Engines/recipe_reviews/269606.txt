Good fall or winter soup.  I was generous with the wine and with ground ginger and added a few small potatoes and sweet potatos for a creamier consistency. Also added curry powder in the saute phase and lemon juice after puree.  Beautiful!  A big hit wit the whole family.

This was absolutely wonderful! In all actuality my husband was the one who made this but he followed the recipe exactly ... no changes were needed as it was delicious!

He made it last week for “foodie” relatives & they immediately asked for the recipe!

We shared it from AllRecipes! Thank you for this keeper!
We will make it again and again.

This is incredibly flavorful! I didn't have curry powder so I used 1/2 teaspoon Chilli powder. I love garlic so I also put in a couple extra cloves. This soup is spicy and creamy... so nice!

Cut back on ginger to about 1/3 cup which for some was still a dominant. We liked it but still something to consider for your taste. With this all said with the cut back of at least half of the ginger we loved it.
