Tasty, but the moisture that comes out of the mushrooms makes it thin and watery.  Pre-cooking the mushrooms would probably help.

Fresh broccoli is cheap & plentiful this time of year, and I was looking for something easy that doesn't use FROZEN broccoli.  This did it.  I loooooved it!  I did make it last minute, so I didn't have some of the ingredients.  Here are my substitutions...   1.  No cream of celery soup, so I chopped some celery (abt 1 cup) and cooked it with the onion.   2.  No milk...  Added 1 cup half & half and 2 cans of chicken broth and 1 can cheddar cheese soup. Only used 2 cups cheese (shredded cheddar, not processed) 3.  Had frozen grilled chicken breast strips.  Used them instead of the canned. 4.  No mushrooms...  no substitution.  : ( Will definitely do this again.  VERY easy! One suggestion:  If you have one of those small food processors, chop the onions, celery & broccoli in the same container.  Makes it very simple & fast!

GREAT soup!!  We left out the mushrooms and chicken (simply because I didn't have any in stock) but chopped up a large potato and added that instead.  It was great!  We've made this recipe twice now and it is definitely one we will continue to use.

This was very good.  I cooked chicken breasts instead of using canned and I lightened it by using low fat soups and light cheese.

made this without the mushrooms- our family won't eat them.  It was very good- VERY thick!  I added quite a bit of chicken stock to thin it out, maybe 3/4 of a cup to a cup.  It was still very thick, even with the addition.  My kids loved it- we will make it again!

Easy and good! A good quick dinner for a winter weeknight.  I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
