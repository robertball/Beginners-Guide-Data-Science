We loved this! I did use some chopped chocolate mint from my garden & I also mixed up a little pineapple juice w/ honey to use as a light dressing & I highly recommend it....it really helped bind the flavors of the salad together. I served this w/ leftover Bow Tie Pasta with Sausage and Sweet Peppers (from this site).

This is a nice variation on summer fruits.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find any fresh flaked coconut, and was sure I had dried coconut flakes at home, but didn't so, we did this without coconut.  While still yummy, I've had mango with fresh coconut before and it's divine, so I know this would have been better with the coconut.

I did IMVINTAGE's dressing, and liked it - it made everything a little stickier and more salad like.

So easy and fresh tasting.  My husband is a mango nut.  He asked me to make it again after only a couple of days.  I took it to a party and everyone wanted the recipe.  I made it the night before.  That gives the dried cranberries a chance to plump.  I did not add a dressing as some of the reviewers suggested.  The juices from the mango and pineapple were enough.  It's great to have a simple component to your meal.  That gives you more time if you are making something fussy.

So fresh and a great combination of flavors!  No changes needed!  I agree with other reviewers - make the salad ahead of time so the cranberries plump and the juices combine.

A great twist on the usual fruit salad and makes a great presentation!  Served it with the Maple Salmon by Starflower from this site and everyone requested both recipes.

I don't know why anyone would be skeptical about this fruit salad.  A deli by me occasionally has this salad on their daily specials menu.  They don't add the cranberries or the coconut but this just sounded delicious at first sight!  The mint makes the fruit so refreshing!  I can only imagine that a touch of coconut & cranberries will only make this better.  I can't wait to try it.  This dish is a MUST try!  It's healthy & delicious!

Made this tonight with the incredible chicken recipe and the strawberry spinach salad I and greek roast potatoes with a greek salad and for desert pear cranberry apple crisp with vanilla ice cream.  This was amazing and all the dishes turned out great.  I think it was the best meal I have ever made for a dinner for 6.  sI will make this meal again.  all recipies were from this website and the easiest of all was this one.  i have a herb garden so it was wonderful to make use of my fresh mint!  All recipes were great, don;t change a thing!

I used frozen pineapple for the first time, finding this shortcut a winner. Used my new mango cutter to find the mango overripe. Bought a jar of mango spears. this worked fine. Very Good!!

This salad was more like a dessert for me.  It was fresh and flavorful.  Delicious!  I also added strawberries, but I think it would also be fantastic as-is.   I served it with the Key West Chicken from this site and grilled corn on the cob.  Wonderful summer meal.

I gave this recipe to my friend to make for our church's recent Hawaian party and it went over very well.  She used canned pineapple to save money and also added some fresh peaches, and everyone loved it, especially the mint taste.  An additional adaptation which she did was to use craisins instead of dried cranberries, and she soaked them in the juice from the canned pineapple.  The whole thing was a big hit!

I honestly did not care for this recipe at all. It would have been fine without the mint. If you walk into the produce section and just take a big whiff with your mouth open, you'll know what this salad tasted like. It was bland - the texture felt awkward and unsatisfying and again, the mint, just overpowered everything else - and I only used three leaves... I couldn't imagine using anymore. This is definitely not going in my recipe book. Sorry.

Light and refreshing.  I liked it better the second day, because the dried cranberries plumped up.

This is a wonderfully refreshing summer salad.  The lady that said it was bland, etc. had to have been talking about another salad.  It is a perfect combination, I loved it.
