Very good, this recipe turned out a very flavorful and tender steak. I would recommend removing the onions after caramelizing a bit, before adding the steak to the pan. My steaks took about 8 minutes total and by then the onions were blackening. Next time I'll add a touch of cream to the whiskey sauce and simmer a bit. Don't be afraid of the whiskey leaving too strong a flavor, it doesn't!

This steak turned out delicious. I originally made it from the UK Allrecipes site. It is the same recipe and submitter. I tend to broil or grill steak as I have not had much success with steak on the stove top. This worked well, for me, though. I used N.Y. strip. Mine, I realized, were kind of on the thin side so I halved the other ingredients. I used butter with canola oil to make the butter/oil measurements quicker. I cooked the onions on medium until I just noticed some light browning. The original recipe did not indicate, but I removed the onions before adding the meat with a slotted spoon. I started the meat on medium, but had to turn it up to about 6.5 to finish browning. I was worried that the whiskey would be too strong, because I don't care for it. However, it more or less just tenderized it. I poured it directly over the steak and added about 1-2 more minutes to the steak. I did not cook the caramelized onions in the whiskey either. I enjoyed my steak. ty

This was really yummy! I used two ribeyes and served this with Smoked Bacon and Irish Cheese Mash. Flambe them if you can, it helps soften the whiskey flavor. Thank you!!

Big hit at our house.  I used a big fat london broil which required a lot of extra cooking time.

Good flavor combination, but after trying it the way written, I tried the combination in a different way.

1. Dry the steaks well (put them on a wire rack for a couple hours in the fridge.  Actually, if you can do this for a day or two, that works much better).
2. Salt and pepper the steaks.  Rub in well and let stand at room temperature for an hour or so.
3. Sear the steaks in half the butter and half the oil over relatively high heat for about 2 minutes each side.  Remove to a small sheet pan and place in a 250 degree oven for 15 minutes.
4. Add remaining butter and oil to the pan, and saute the onions and garlic until transparent.  Deglaze with the whiskey and simmer to reduce.
5. Serve the medium-rare crust-to-crust steaks with the onion/garlic/whiskey over the top.

Okay, this was a great recipe!!! My Hispanic son-in-law said he really liked Irish food, I served this with colcannon and a side veggie.  What a great meal. Thanks for sharing this one with us.

My Iowa farm girl wife thought this was one of the best steaks we ever prepared, and she's pretty selective about her steak. I slivered the garlic clove and placed them into slits when i finished with the rubbing.

Terrific recipe. I used Delmonico steaks instead of sirloin.  I think they take the flavors on better. Try adding sliced white or baby Bella mushrooms to the onions.  Bellas give the dish a nice woody note.  Also, take a look at my blog, www.jeffskitchen.net, for a wonderful recipe for smashed salt and vinegar potatoes.  I served them with your steak and they were incredible together!

Irish beef is superb, of course.

Letting it flame up a bit to crisp/sear is another technique, but there's almost everything right, and certainly nothing wrong with this recipe!  Easy to see why it is featured!

Perfect!  Best recipe I've found on here even better than the Alfredo Blue.  Only thing I did different was use 1 big sirloin steak instead of 4 little ones which I cut into strips before serving with sauce on top, cut the onions into strips which was nice in the sauce and I didn't use Jameson, I used 2 Gingers Irish Whiskey which is a personal favorite and served with steamed new potatoes.  Absolutely perfect.

A perfect recipe, followed it exactly except had only Scotch whisky and not Irish. The steaks were juicy and took just 28 minutes from start to finish. Suppose I have to call it a Scotch steak now...LOL. Definitely a keeper.

These steaks were A-mazing! Either that or me and my friend are amazing cooks! These steaks turned out awesome. Add a little bearnaise sauce, they seriously are soooo juicy! We did out the onions to the side so they wouldn't burn!

I modified this by doing 1/2 yellow onion and 1/2 leek then added 1/3 cup sliced baby bella mushrooms to the pan once I put the steak down. It was delicious.

WIth what I learned from making it the first time, I will not brown the onions first. They ended up burning after the meat was done. Secondly, instead of rubbing the garlic on the meat, I minced it and stirred it in with the onions. I am making it again tomorrow night as 4 pieces is not enough for one sitting.   We are only 4 with children; boy (11), and girl (9). Other than that, it was a hit!! I'll be sure to take some pictures while I am alone in the kitchen before I take it to the table!!

This recipe is great. I never tried adding alcohol in the preparation of steak. And I'm Irish. Typically I either used a rub or a marinade. This was unique flavor and I followed another reviewers advise and flambéd the steak. I only had filets but they turned out flavorful and juicy.

This is a very good recipe for cooking a steak on a frying pan. I usually use a grill, but a winter snow storm changed that.  This was a nice change.

This was Fantastic!!! I had a large sirloin that I cut up into four small steaks. I used margarine since I was out of butter and Jim Beam honey flavored whiskey. It was great! I removed the onions while cooking the steak and put them back in after adding the whiskey. I will definitely make it again.

The steaks were surprisingly bland, but the caramelized onions were great.  I will probably make the onions again as toppings for other things like hamburgers, but I don't think I'll make the steaks again.

I doubled the recipe and found that the outcome was superb. Following another reviewer's tip, I removed the onions directly after they browned. A tweak of my own was to use minced garlic which I doubled and added in late with the onions. The end result was a sauce that complimented the steak better than anything you can buy in a store

I made the steak several times and it turned out great. I saute the onions separately so the don't burn. Also I have used apple whiskeys to add an apple flavor and it tastes amazing!!

Wow!  Really fantastic.  It's a great recipe in and of itself, but really it is perfect for a slightly less than ideal cut of meat as the flavor is so powerful.  This is perfect if you have some inexpensive steaks in the fridge that you don't know what to do with.

I have used this recipe twice but in different ways. The first time I cut my steaks a bit smaller, did not use the onions so I browned my butter instead, and followed rest of the recipe, adding about a tablespoon of whole milk at the very end and served it on breakfast sandwiches. Tonight I am following it with the exception of cooking burgers instead of steak and again added the milk at the end. Both times it has been absolutely delicious!

Made this for dinner last night.  I didn't have fresh garlic,  so I just sprinkled garlic powder on the steaks, other than that, I followed the recipe.   Great flavor!  Saving this one!

The steaks had a good flavor, but found it to be labor intensive.  Will probably not make again.

Made this last night. Overall delicious but few tips:
- season the steaks with salt and pepper beforehand
- consider using a rub on the steak
- mushrooms would be nice with the onions
- i would flip the steak so the parsley cooks a bit
- i served this with roasted veggies
- used a flank steak which tasted fine

I thought this was amazing recipe.  The steak just melted in my mouth. So the alterations I made based on the previous reviews were:
1) After rubbing the steaks with garlic I finely chopped the cloves and shoved pieces of the cloves into the cracks of the steak.  (crucify me for not using cooking jargon) I don't like the idea of making my own holes for the garlic, I'm not sure why.  Maybe its some weird respect for the local butcher? (you're guess is as good as mine, I have no clue why)
2) I made two batches of onions 1 just to flavor the pan that the steak would cook in.  Once I put the steak in I removed the browning onions and added new ones so they wouldn't be burned and could be served with the steak.
3) I was generous with the Jameson and I think thats what added the extra kick in flavor. I also let it simmer for longer in the Jameson and just seared the sides before hand a little extra hot.  (I like my steaks medium

This had great flavor. I had a one pound top sirloin steak, cut it into 4 pieces.  I only had Canadian Whiskey so that's what I used.

Amazing. Made just as recipe directed, the only thing I would change is to add a few more garlic cloves when adding the whiskey - the 2 halves that I rubbed on the steak tasted great with those onions!  This was a hit with my husband and two daughters ages 3 and 4!!  :)

I made this tonight for my Irish wife. It turned out wonderful. I substituted Bushmill Irish Whiskey for Jameson simply because I was out of Jameson. Turned out fantastic. The recipe doesn't specify, but I used yellow sweet onions rather than white and I was very pleased with the sweet caramelized results. My wife is hard to please because she's such a great cook herself and she loved it. I had little to no sauce left to drizzle over the steaks. This may be the way it was intended, but I cooked it in a 14" cast iron skillet. I think I'll add a little more liquid ingredients next time and more whiskey to see if I can get an au-jus to pour over them. All in all a wonderful recipe and I'll certainly be making it again!

Quick, easy, and OMG... Pick up a loaf of bread from the deli, roast some potatoes and carrots while you're prepping and cooking, and you're done. And the flavor is to die for.

Real good flavor with these steaks. You get a hint of the wiskey but its not overbearing. i suggest added about a clove of minced garlic to the onions while they are cooking. Also some baby-bella mushrooms go great. Wasnt awhole lot left of the sauce/onions so i mixed it in with a package of brown gravy mix. Turned out fantastic.

I marinated my sirloin with a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder 2 hours before.  I also added mushroom to the onion initially. The steak has turned out to be heavenly. A MUST have recipe at home I say.
Bravo!!

Great flavor!  Next time I would be sure to allow for some browning of the onions while the beef cooked.  I was afraid the onions were going to burn when I made this, and thankfully they didn't.  A simple, delicious sauce and well worth the expense of Jameson whiskey.

I was worried the whiskey would be strong. We didn't have Irish whiskey, but some Willie Nelson Whiskey River. Not to worry! It was great! The whiskey cooks out and just leaves a really nice flavor that tastes nothing like the bottle smells! I only had round steak, I don't recommend those, but then I am not a fan of round steak. It was tough. I am definitely going to use this recipe again on a better cut of steak and also on some pork steak. It would be good on hamburgers too. The onions are delicious! I only wish there was more juice to make a gravy out of. I'll work on that next time. Thank you for the recipe!!! My husband was very skeptical and that I was wasting his whiskey. It was way better this way! ;)
