VERY GOOD peach cobbler recipe. If you like your cobblers on the sweet side, this recipe is perfect! If you want it a bit less sweet, reduce the sugar in this recipe. Other than that, leave it just as it is.  I made this recipe as-is and only used one cup of the brown sugar and my own home-canned peaches (2 quarts). I used a 9x11 pan, so the pie crusts do not perfectly fit. In my case I only had one pre-made pie crust anyway, so I spread that one on the bottom and simply made additional dough for the top. This recipe tasted like the one my grandmother used to make (not like the newer peach cobbler recipes).  So if you're my age (LOL), you'll appreciate this old-timey cobbler taste! :-)
