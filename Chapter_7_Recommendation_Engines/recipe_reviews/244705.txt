I agree that this needs a few more herbs and flavors. I added onion, oregano, salt and pepper...but this is very quick and easy! Serve with garlic bread and a salad...very hearty soup!

I had no fennel, so I used fennel seed.  Worked well.  I will definitely make again.  Whole family liked it.

I totally disagree with the other reviews.  I made this as directed and my husband and I found the seasoning perfect.

I didn't care for this as written. I thought the parsley was overpowering and the soup lacked flavor. I finally added onion powder, celery salt and garlic salt to add some taste. I didn't care for the fennel. I would prefer celery and onion instead.
