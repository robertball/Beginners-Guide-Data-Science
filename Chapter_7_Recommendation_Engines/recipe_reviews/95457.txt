This is my go-to punch for events. I choose not to include the alcohol as it tastes wonderful without it. I freeze the nectarine slices and use them in place of ice cubes. That way they don't water down the punch when they thaw.

I used Passion Fruit Vodka to hide the taste of the vodka a bit, and it was amazing. My friends raved about it!

A home run!!  This is a wonderful summer bridal shower punch!  I made my own peach nectar which was really easy and yummy and the rest is easy to put together right before serving.  I also shaved all the ice and stored in gallon freezer bags so I did not have to do that step when guests were arriving.
