Yummy! This was my first green smoothie! :)
I froze all the fruit except the oranges and did not need the ice, so I used coconut water and increased it to 1 1/2 cup. I added a few scoops of protein powder and 1 cup of greek yogurt to make the smoothie more filling, and about a tablespoonful of Manuka honey. I think I'll be drinking this for breakfast during these summer months. You cannot taste the spinach at all! Tastes like a tropical fruit smoothie.

I absolutely love this green smoothie. If you are new to green smoothies, this is definitely the one to try. It makes a nice sweet, yet slightly creamy fruit juice. I made it quite a few times, before it was even published trying to drink more green smoothies. It is still my favorite. Only change I make is I use a frozen orange. I also don't have an ice crusher and typically use about 8 ice cubes to equal 1 cup. I prefer the green grapes to keep the pretty green color and I have never tried it with the (optional) flax. Canned unsweetened pineapple in juice works great too, believe that is what I typically use as I have it in the house year round. I make 1/2 recipe and get 2 servings. Glad, this was published.

This tasted great. Not a hint of spinach. Will mire likely freeze the grapes next time.

I've never had a green smoothie. I made a half-serving, and it was OK. Nutritionally, I don't believe it was a whole lot better than your standard smoothies. (I usually add protein powder to mine.) I do eat with my eyes, so I think I just prefer berry or pastel-colored smoothies. I'm glad I tried this, but I think I'd rather eat my spinach than drink it.

One word...Awesome!!!  What a light refreshing green smoothie...perfect for the summer months.  I altered the recipe a bit because I just ran out of oranges and spinach.  So I replaced the recipe with a ruby red grapefruit and kale instead. Even the bitter taste that kale has was even hidden in this recipe.  This smoothie has certainly made the list of my top favorites.  Thanks for sharing!

This is one of the best green smoothies I've tried.  I've made it twice now, once as written but without the flax seeds, and once with the flax seeds but half as much orange (it was all I had).  Both were excellent, not really tasting of spinach.  I used frozen pineapple -- even with that, I think you still need the full ice amount.  Both times I used red grapes, and I think you would need to use green grapes to make it turn out like the picture, but it shouldn't affect the taste either way.

Made exactly as recipe stated, except I left out the flax.  Very good, my toddler even drank it and he doesn't like any green vegetable.  I might try slightly less spinach next time (maybe 1  1/2 c) to make it a little more fruity.  Also want to note that this recipe makes a full blender worth of smoothie.  Overall a great lower sugar smoothie option, definitely going in my recipe box!

I've wanted to try this smoothie ever since it was published, but I've never had all the fresh fruits at the same time. So today, I decided to use what I had. I used canned pineapple tidbits and canned mandarin oranges. This smoothie was thinner, more fruity-tasting, and less creamy than what I am used to with smoothies. But that's to be expected with no yogurt, banana, or milk in it! It is very light and refreshing and would be perfect to quench the thirst on a hot summer's day.

Love this recipe!  I even got my husband to drink it and he actually asked me to make more of it, and he is not a fan of spinach!  Very versatile- you can add whatever kind of fruit you like- Kiwis or Mango, but it's great as is too!

My first "green" smoothie.  Didn't have flax but used chia seeds.  Added a little banana and had crushed canned pineapple instead.  Thanks!
