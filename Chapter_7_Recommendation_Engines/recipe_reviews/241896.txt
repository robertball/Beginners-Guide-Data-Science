Ground beef step aside. This sauce has a variety of flavors. I did skip the cayenne pepper since I was making it for a child as well. The sriracha sauce adds a spicy twist alone.  Next time I would cut back on the water or make the roux. I served over veggies, so the thinner sauce didn't matter in this dish.

Great vegan alternative to sloppy joes! I used half a cup of water instead of a full cup and that was a sufficient thickness for me. The flavor is great though and I love how quick and easy it was to make. Thanks for posting!

It was pretty good, I doubled the recipe and didn’t have any peppers but I think I’d make it again. But there are also better tasting lentil recipes in my opinion. I ended up adding about 1 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it.

Delicious! Will make again.
I made a lot of changes to suit my family.
Did not use cayenne, green pepper, thyme or bbq sauce.
Used 2 tsp siracha and 2 TBSP brown sugar.

A fun alternative to traditional Sloppy Joes. It has a good amount of kick to it in a balanced spicy-sweet sauce. I'll repeat this one, and not just for the vegans of the family!
