I changed it quite bit, but it came out so delicious, I thought I'd share.

Used a 16 oz sour cream, and about 8 ounces of activa yogurt. Chopped the green onions in a food processor, so they were very fine.  Added a couple teaspoons of salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and just a hint of dill, maybe 1/2 teaspoon.  Wonderful flavor

My family has been making green onion dip for as long as I've been alive.  May I suggest, reduce the green onions by a bunch and add 3-4 tbs pace/salsa and also I love to add a few squirts of Sirarcha. This recipe is a hit, even for onion haters :)

The flavor to this dip is OK.  I make a dip that is similar to this but adds flavor and presentation.  Add real bacon bits along with the green onions to the mix instead of salt.  Once the dip is chilled you can roll it in chopped pecans to make a cheese log.  It's delicious when you dip in Wheat Thins!

I have made this several times, and it always goes very quickly. I have always prepared it as the recipe states, and people love it. It gets quite a bit better a couple days after making it, because the onion taste gets stronger.

Very good and very easy. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt for extra flavor.

Wonderful dip!! I made this exactly as stated in the recipe except I used garlic salt instead of regular salt to suit our taste as a previous reviewer had suggested.  Added just a splash more milk as the recipe had mentioned to get the consistency desired.  Tasted great right out of the bowl, but I can't wait to taste it tomorrow after it has sat in the fridge overnight! To cut down on prep time I chopped the green onions in my food processor and used a hand mixer to beat the cream cheese and milk together, then beat in the green onions and garlic salt.  Absolutely delicious!

Awesome!  I added fresh dill and whirled it all in the food processor.  No salt needed.

I completely changed this because I didn't have cream cheese and it came out great! I had 1 bunch of green onions that I chopped up in my food processor and I added 2 cups of sour cream and 2 packages of real bacon bits. Excellent dip so thanks for the idea with the base recipe! I'll try it your way next time... :)

I have made this for years, via my mother's recipe. I add a few shots worcestershire sauce (Lea & Perrin) and some garlic powder to taste. It goes great with wavy chips!!!
