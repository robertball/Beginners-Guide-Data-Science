My family loved this salad - it was very easy to make. However, I did add a pint of strawberries, cut the milk to 1 cup, and cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup. I made the dressing and put it in a container and put the fruit in another container. An hour before serving time, I drained the juices from the fruit and added the dressing (I ended up not using all of the dressing because I didn't want it to be too runny). You could almost double the fruit and most likely have enough dressing.

Also, I did not peel the apple. I used a red apple and the skin added color. The strawberries were also a nice addition. I soaked the apples in the pineapple juice with a little Fresh Fruit in order to keep the apples from turning brown. 

And, I added the bananas right before serving. If this rating system had 10 stars - I'd give it a 10.

YUM! The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars, is that the amount of milk called for is too much. I omitted about 1/2 cup of the milk, and the consistency was just about right. I made this for my husband's college graduation party, and everyone loved it. I made the salad the night before the party, adding the apples and bananas right before serving. I will definitely make this again.

I modified the recipe a bit so it would have less sugar & calories.  I substituted a 1 oz. package of sugarfree instant vanilla pudding, used skim milk & light sour cream & cut up pineapple rings (as my market didn't have tidbits).  I didn't bother to peel the granny smith apple I used.  I'd saved the drained pineapple juice; I dipped the apple in the pineapple juice, & then drained it.  Dipping it in the juice kept the apple from turning brown.  I also added about a cup of red seedless grapes, cut in half for color.  I think fresh strawberries &/or blueberries would add to the presentation.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to make the dish the night before which I would recommend.  I drained the fruit well & put the fruit (without the bananas) in a separate container & the orange juice dressing in another container in the frig overnight.  I brought the 2 containers & 2 bananas to work today to a baby shower.  I drained the fruit again in the morning just before I left for work as people had commented on the dish being too liquidy.  Just before serving, I cut up the 2 bananas into the fruit & then mixed the container of "orange cream" into the fruit.  At least 8 people asked me for the recipe!

I also made this over Memorial weekend with the following changes based on others   recommendations:
1. Let fruit drain overnight and make dressing the night before
2. Used 1 cup of half-n-half and 1/2 cup of sour cream
3. Added 2 tsp of vanilla extract
4. Diced peaches
5. Deleted apples and bananas
6. Added 1 pound fresh strawberries, 1 small container of blueberries, and about 2 cups of red grapes

Turned out perfect with many wonderful comments!  Great receipe Lori!

This was delicious and a huge hit.  Considering prior reviews indicating that it was a bit runny, I took others' advice and cut the milk to 1 cup and the sour cream to 1/2 c.  I mixed the fruit and cream separately and let them sit overnight (except for the apples, which I added at the last minute to avoid browning).  Just before serving, I mixed the fruit and cream together and added cool whip, to give it more volume and to avoid any runniness.  It worked out great.  It was not runny at all.  The cool whip was light and did not detract from the orangy flavor.  It held up for several hours during our cookout without having to be refrigerated.  My 11 year old godson asked me the next day if I was going to make some more.

I didn't have any problem with this being too runny. Reduced the milk to 1 cup and added a dibble of vanilla, and a drop or two of orange extract to the dressing.  I soaked the apples and bananas for 10 minutes each in the pineapple juice (a trick I learned on this site) to keep them from turning brown.  I also added a 16 oz bag of frozen, pitted cherries, thawed, for color.  I can't imagine why anyone would think this had cheese in it, the color is a very mild, pretty orange.  Very good fruit salad.

This recipe is awesome and really easy! I omitted the apple and banana and substituted in a can of pears (drained and cubed). I also used only 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream. If you are in a hurry and don't have time to drain the fruit overnight in your refrigerator, just put it into a salad spinner; it worked great for me! Even the mandarin oranges were fine, just don't get too crazy with the spinner :o). Will definitely make again.

This fruit salad is the BEST ever!  A lot of the reviews said it was runny or didn't turn out.  I took suggestions from other reviewers and found  exactly what you need to do for a great fruit salad.  Reduce the milk to 1 cup.  Make the orange dressing the night before and refrigerate it.  This allows it to set up well.  Drain the peaches, pineapples, and oranges overnight...but save the pineapple and orange juice.  Slice the bananas and soak them in the pineapple juice overnight.  Slice the apples and soak them in the orange juice overnight.  Drain the bananas and apples, mix with other fruit and orange dressing.  I like to refrigerate it for a few hours so all the fruit is cold and the salad is mixed well, then serve.  Turns out perfect every time!  I've received nothing but great compliments for this fruit salad and will continue to make it for brunches and potlucks!

This is great with a couple modifications. I cut the milk to 3/4 cup, added 1/2 cup more sour cream,1t orange extract, and cut up a fresh orange to add to the salad. Just a dash of lemon juice and Voila! A great citrus flavored salad.
If the dressing makes the salad soupy, just add some coconut. It will soak of the "soup".

Very tasty, but I would prefer more pudding texture -- I used 1 c. milk but will reduce even further next time since the fruit gets juicier as it sits.  Also, I recommend cutting up the peaches into bite-sized pieces.

Very refreshing fruit salad! I too cut the milk to 1 cup and the sour cream to 1/2 cup (actually even a little less sour cream) and it turned out great! Next time I might try it with 1/3 cup coconut mixed in. Will definitely make again.

The orange juice concentrate gives this salad such a refreshing flavor.  I've found that I get the best results by really draining the canned fruits well - even blotting with a paper towel - prevents it from getting soupy.

This was pretty good.  I liked the concept, and liked the orange cream flavor, but thought the apples and banana were out of place.  I'd make this again, but without them.

This has become our family favorite this summer!  I've found it is a great salad to make in advance for parties.   I drain the fruit overnight in the fridge and prepare the pudding in advance for convenience, then mix the two together and chill before the event. I've also used Orange sugar-free espresso syrup in place of the orange juice concentrate for convenience and it turned out great!

For anyone considering this recipe.. try it! My entire family loves this recipe. It's now a family traditional favorite...  Made it again this year... this time I added cinnamon while mixing the pudding... and the last two years I have garnished the top with Pomegranate seeds. Adds festive color and gives it a "pop." left-overs last very well. The pudding doesn't separate like Cool Whip or other whipped creams, and the citric acid in the orange juice prevents the fresh fruits from turning brown. All around an excellent dish! So good it's nearly like a desert.

I followed the basic idea, but made quite a few substitutions simply because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used lemon sugar free pudding, since that was on hand.  I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup, and used 1/2 cup of liquid from the canned mandarin oranges instead of the o.j. concentrate.  I used 1/2 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I used 1 1/2 cups of frozen peaches, the canned pineapple tidbits, the canned mandarin oranges, and the bananas.  I omitted the apples.  I added 1/2 cup of drained maraschino cherries (no stems) for a pop of color.  Mine was more of a lemon cream salad, but the basic idea is the same.  Great recipe, easy to follow and easy to make substitutions!

Wonderful & refreshing! I omitted bananas, drained fruit then left them to drain again overnight as suggested.  Made orange cream night before (with 1 cup skim milk & 1/2 cup light sour cream). Next day, I chopped a Fuji apple, soaked it in reserved pineapple juice to prevent browing, then drained it 15 min later.  Added fruits together with cream, then gently folded in 1/2 pint fresh raspberries (added great color & flavor).  It was a huge hit!!

This sauce tasted like orange creamsicles! Yummy! I added a lot more mandarin oranges and some red seedless grapes for color. Doesn't state if oranges should be drained. I also used crushed pineapple. Diced up my peaches. I took advice from others and drained fruit in frigerator over night. Added bananas and apple just before adding the sauce. I made sauce as written, but also let that sit overnight(it didn't seem thicker to me the next morning.) I ended up using maybe 3/4 of the sauce.  I would eat left over sauce with a spoon or add to some extra fruit. It was so good.I added it slowly as I didn't want it to be runny as some stated. I was going to add some marshmellows, but sauce was so good I didn't want to alter it in anyway, it might help adding them to a runny salad. Mine came out perfect though and received many compliments at our Easter brunch. Everyone wanted to know what the sauce was! Thanks so much Lori!

Wow, this was great! We had 40 people over to our house for a BBQ, it was a hit! I took the advice of many reviewers and drained the fruit well to avoid runniness. The second time I made it I allowed the pudding mixture to "set-up" for about an hour in the fridge before adding the fruit. During this time I put the fruit in a strainer and let it drain well. It turned out great! I also added green apples for texture and color. I rolled them in the canned fruit juice before adding to the salad, this prevented browning. Don't pass this one up, it is well worth it!

This was very good. Nice and light. I added cherries and that was very good in it. Next time I will add mini marshmellows for a little sweeter flavor and maybe some walnuts for some texture.

I really love this recipe.  It's very easy and very good.  I took the advise of other reviewers and let my canned fruit drain for a few hours.  I doubled the recipe and didn't use as much milk.  I also used pineapple chunks without cutting them up, which worked really well.  Great recipe for summer entertainment.

This was so Yummy! I took the suggestion of someone else's review and cut the milk down to 3/4 cup and the sour cream to 1/2 cup. I also made sure that the fruit was well drained and added some sliced strawberries. This is a GREAT fruit dessert and I will be making this again!!!!

This recipe has lots of reviews already but thought I would add mine anyway.  Drian all the fruit well, save the juice and use it to coat the sliced bannanas so they don't go brown or mushy(drain after coating).  It definetly needs color.  Green grapes are a good addition.  Strawberries in summer, unpealed red apple and maraschino cherries in winter, use fresh mint leaves to garnish.  Could probably get away with using half the suggested requirements for the dressing, but still use all the fruit.  Make the dressing first and let it set really well, before mixing it with the fruit.  Overall this is a really tasty salad, but the recipe needs quite a bit of personal adjustments this is why I give it only 4 stars.

Definately worth 5-stars.
Followed other reviews & only used 1 cup milk.
Also reduced sour cream to 1/2 cup.
Added a splash of vanilla extract & maraschino cherries.
Can't wait for summer to try fresh fruit & maybe a different juice concentrate.
Everybody loved it.
Not bad for an old guy that everyone thought lived on fast-food.
THANKS LEAGLE  !!!

Really tasty and light.  Mine ended up a little soupy so I folded in some whipped cream to thicken it up a bit.

I cut up oranges instead of using Mandarin and it gave the sauce a bitter taste.  USE MANDARIN!  If I make it again I will only change that.

It is very important to let fruit drain at least 5-6 hours.  I used 3/4 cup milk in the dressing and let it sit in the frig while the fruit drained, stirring occasionally, and the consistency of the dressing was very nice.  All the different kinds of fruit (added fresh strawberries) were delicious.  Have to use the salad in 1-2 days, as the dressing does thin out after a couple of days.  I would make this again.  It is a different salad suitable for company.

I made this for Thanksgiving and the whole family raved! I cut the milk to 1 cup, added halved red seedless grapes and drained the fruit overnight.  It was fantastic! Everyone loved it and requested (demanded) that I bring it to all of the family gatherings.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

OH my goodness people!!! This is amazing! Tastes like a creamsicle:) Here's my yummy delicious healthy version: 1 (1.5oz) pkg sugar free vanilla pudding, 3/4 cup milk, and 1/2 cup plain yogurt in place of the sour cream! I also added a few spoonfuls of agave nectar... mmm :) But it would be just as good without the agave. All the fruit & the OJ concentrate amount I left the same as the original recipe stated. 
This was thick and not at all runny. Added strawberries and lots of chopped almonds. This is a MUST TRY! Haven't tried anything like it or anything so good in a long time!

This was an awesome fruit salad.  I also did some substituting in this recipe, along with other reviewers.  I substituted the sour cream with cool whip and I skipped the bananas, because they turn brown fast, for marshmellows.  My husband absolutely loves this and asks for it time and time again.  Be sure to try this recipe!!!

This fruit salad was delicious!  I made it for a friend's family and they loved it.  I used only 1 cup of milk in the dressing after reading the other reviews, and I also substituted Cool Whip for the sour cream and red grapes for the apples which added nice color.  The dressing tastes just like orange creamsicles!  I will definitly make this again soon.  It was so easy but it tastes great!

I followed the advice of others and drained the fruit for an hour, chilled the pudding for an hour prior to adding fruit and still was runny. I won't be making this again.

I originally found this recipe on this site in 2007. Today, I logged back in to find it because my copy was covered in food, ick! Any way... I usually make it with white chocolate pudding or cheesecake pudding and it turns out fantastic. I have also been known the change up the fruit in it and it always turns out well. This time, I ran out of sour cream so I used vanilla Greek yogurt and it was tasty too. I like the creamy, tanginess taste that the salad has.

This is my boyfriend's favorite fruit salad recipe. He uses strawberries instead of apples because the taste/texture goes better with the rest of the salad. I tested this recipe out because it seemed to be the same, and the taste is spot on, but the dressing is too runny/too much for the fruit called for. I would say doubling the fruit would fix it, though then you'd have a whole ton of fruit salad!

This recipe is fantastic-I did modify as others recommended and only used 1/2 cup sourcream, 3/4 cup orange juice concentrate, 1 cup milk, and 1 cup seedless grapes.  I also added some cool-whip, coconut, and walnuts on top for decoration. It's wonderful, thanks for sharing!!!

I wanted to try this recipe today for our Memorial Day picnic, but halfway through making it I realized I didn't have a few key ingredients. First, I only used 1 cup of milk as suggested by other reviewers; 1/3 cup of regular orange juice as that was all I had on hand; 3/4 cup of whipped cream instead of sour cream as I don't care for the taste of sour cream; and about a pint or so of fresh sliced strawberries instead of the peaches since I was out of them. Even without this being exactly the same recipe it was great and several people commented on how good it was. I'll definitely make it again.

This was so good!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the milk to 1 cup and the sour cream to 1/2 cup.  Also, I reserved some pineapple juice in a bowl and added "Fruit Fresh" produce protector to it.  I dipped the sliced bananas and apple in the Fruit Fresh mixture before combining them with the other fruits.  The salad looked beautiful while served and even the  small amount of leftover salad looked and tasted great the following day.  Oh, and I also added a jar of maraschino cherries for color.  I'd have preferred strawberries, but I had the cherries on hand.  Will definitely try with strawberries this summer!!

Easy and refreshing. I changed a few things, used 3/4 cup of milk and a lg. instant vanilla. I also drained the fruit for one hour. It was thick and creamy and not soupy at all. I like the idea of adding fresh blueberries or strawberries for added colour. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for a family get together and everyone just loved it.  Now it's what everyone asks me to bring.  I made sure to drain the fruit and I took the advice of some other reviews so it wouldn't turn out runny.  I added chopped walmuts, cherries, and granny smith apples and left out the bananas.  It's a great recipie and a new family favorite.

I used sugar free instant banana pudding, mixed it with 1 cup of milk & OJ.  I then added the sour cream along with some whipped cream and cinnamon.  I used unpeeled apples, bananas, pineapple chunks, mandarin oranges, maraschino cherries, seedless red grapes, and a handful of shredded coconut.  It turned out great.  Very creamy & flavorful.

I made this for Easter and it was a hit.  Like others have suggested, I used 1/2 cup less of the milk, drained the fruit overnight, refrigerated the dressing overnight before combining with the fruit, I left out the bananas, left out the apples (although next time I will add them), added strawberries for color and we thought this was excellent!!!  It does taste like a creamsicle with fruit.  It is so easy and refreshing!!

First time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. I found it to be too runny, but delicious. I loved the apples and bananas in it. The second time I made it, I let the fruit drain for a hour before mixing it which fixed the runnyness. I added one cup of walnut pieces which really boosted the flavor of this salad for me. I made it for my family and a potluck where it was a big hit both times. I'll make it again.

Delicious! I use sugar free vanilla pudding (1 oz.) vs. the 3.5 stated in the recipe. I rinse and drain all the canned fruit in my salad spinner adding the oranges last. I mix the vanilla pudding, 1 cup milk, and 1/2 cup light sour cream, and 1/3 c. OJ concentrate and refrigerate overnight. I refrigerate the canned fruit overnight and drain the extra juice the following morning. Mix the canned fruit and dressing together. Soak the bananas and apples in the pineapple juice and add to the salad before serving--the bananas do not keep well in the salad. Maraschino cherries are an excellent addition to the salad but they must be drained and rinsed separate from the other canned fruit otherwise the pineapple will turn pink. Loved by everyone! Thanks!

My granddaughters can't get enough of this salad!  I leave out the canned peaches and substitute grape halves.   I also leave out 1/2 cup of milk in the dressing, so it isn't too runny.

I just made this for a party and it was Delicious! I doubled the ingredients and it barely fed my 15 guest party. I did cut the milk in half and let it sit with the dressing and fruit over night in separate containers. I also stirred in some french vanilla whipped cream right before serving.

We all love this recipe! The kids are always exited to make this. I drain the fruit really well and only use about half of the sauce so it's a little thicker. We like to add half a bag of shredded coconut and marichino cherries. Sometimes I use the marichino cherry juice instead of orange juice just to mix things up now and then. No matter what, this is a great recipe just as is. Thank you.

As many others stated the dressing in this recipe, although delicious, is enough to cover more than double the amount of fruit it calls for. I used exactly have of the sour cream & milk the second time which made it less soupy & more creamy. The sliced banana's give this salad a uniquely fresh flavor if added right before serving. Both my husband & kids thought it was delicious!! Well done!

I was looking for a new kind of fruit salad to take to Christmas dinner.. and I've found it!  I used about 1 1/4 c. of milk and then added some marschino cherries and grapes.  Didn't use the apple because it's too cruchy.  I may add some walnuts the next time I make it too.  Excellent creamy texture that was just as good the next day.  Thank you for this great recipe!

YUMMY!  So happy I found this recipe, I think it will become a staple at our family gatherings.  I made the recipe as  called for, but used the following reviewer suggestions to make it a hit:
1.Drain the canned fruits very well, even overnight, if possible.  Reserve the pineapple juice.
2.Make the orange sauce and keep in fridge overnight.
3.After slicing/peeling/cutting the apples, soak them in the reserved pineapple juice.  This will give them a little flavor boost and keep them from turning brown.
4.Mix the sauce and fruits together 2 hours before serving and keep cold until serving.
Also, I did use halved red grapes, and they were a delicious, crunchy addition to the salad.  I can't wait to make it again, because I have no leftovers!

WOW!!!!  This is just delicious! I first made it for a bbq at a friend's house and 3 people asked for the recipe and one told me I should make it and sell it around the neighborhood at breakfast time! It really is that good. Even my kids, who can be picky fruit salad eaters, loved this recipe! I made it with 1c skim milk and 1/2c fat free sour cream..everything else the same. I've since made it 2 more times and one of the best things I've learned is to make the dressing the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. It gives it a chance to thicken a bit. Then gently fold over the well-drained fruit when you're ready to serve. Any fruit you use will be fine..I used pineapples, mandarin oranges, halved and pitted cherries, blueberries and sliced strawberries. Now it's one of my favorite summertime breakfasts!

This is a simply divine variation on fruit salad.  The OJ gives it a nice tangy quality.  Skim milk and low or no fat sour cream can be used and no one will be any the wiser.  Fresh pineapple and orange sections can also be used.  I add about 25-30 red grapes, sliced in half because there is plenty of dressing.  Do not peel the skin on a red apple to add color.  I am ALWAYS asked for this recipe when I bring it to social events.  Great for a picnic.

I made this for a BBQ & everyone loved it.  Several asked for the recipe.  I did change it a bit.  First, I drained off the juice from the pineapple & oranges into a bowl.  I diced the apple & sliced the banana & soaked them in the juice so they wouldn't turn brown, & they didn't.  I also diced the peaches.  Next time I will use fresh peaches.  For the pudding sauce, I only used one cup of the milk.  This would make a good fruit salad for a brunch or a light dessert.

Lori, I'll tell ya, this salad flew out of the bowl!  I used sugar free pudding, cut the milk to 3/4 cup, and the sour cream to 1/2 cup.  I soaked the apple (which I didn't peel) and banana slices in the pineapple juice to prevent browning, and I added strawberries, blueberries, red and green grapes, pitted cherries, and instead of using canned peaches, I chopped a large fresh nectarine.  Before adding the pineapple, oranges, apples and bananas I patted them dry with a paper towel to get out the extra juice.  I didn't have a problem at all with it being liquidy as it was eaten up quickly.  Excellent recipe, will use again..thanks!

Made a few revisions.. drained all the fruit juice together, and used about 3/4 of that liquid instead of milk.  I omitted the apples and added marachino cherries and grapes.  I also added 1 pkg of cream cheese whipped with about 2T sugar.  Makes it really creamy!! Absolutely fantastic!!!

This was a total hit with my staff at school! I had several co-workers ask for the recipe.  I did do some modifying after reading other's reviews.  I only used 3/4 milk and 1/2 sour cream.  I also deleted the bananas and used 1/2 jar of maraschino cherries and a large handful of green grapes for color.  My husband loved it, too! I will definitely make it again!!!

This is a good recipe.  I've made it twice now.  The first time was a bit too soupy for my taste.  The second time I used half & half instead of milk to help thicken the sauce some.  I also made sure the fruit was drained more thoroughly.  Anyway really good recipe.  Will make again.

A good fruit salad. Like the orange flavor but don't mix the dressing until just before serving or it may get get runny from  the fruit juices.

This was tasty but nothing special. Good to try at least once but I don't know that I would make it again.

Wonderful! I made this for a family dinner and it got rave reviews. I followed others' suggestions and used only 3/4 cup milk and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also added an extra can of diced peaches and an extra can of mandarin oranges. I omitted the banana and apple. For some extra fluff I stirred in 4 oz. cool whip before serving. Yummy!

I thought my family would throw a fit that I wasn't bringing our traditiional fruit salad to an event and instead they announced I am now officially the 'bringer of the fruit salad' as long as I use this recipe.

As suggested by other reviewers, I only made 1/3 of the sauce, using half yogurt and half sour cream instead of all sour cream.  I found that I had to throw almost half of this away.  In the future I'll make much less sauce.  I also added some strawberries -- though you could use cherries, too -- which improved the color.  Made it for a Halloween party for 20 and it was a great success.

So Yummy!  I needed a "salad" for a ladies get together at my church.  I am not a big "salad" person so I went to allrecipes to find something to make.  This caught my eye.  It's really a dessert!  But is so full of fruit that it has to be good for you - right?!  I will definitely be making this one again.

Super yummy and easy.  I agree with previous reviews about draining the fruit, I let it sit in a colander for 15 mins before mixing with pudding mixture.  I made this a second time and didn't have vanilla puding so I used Jell-o Cheesecake flavor instant pudding, added that extra umph!  I also arranged some berries on top merely for decoration, which added a nice touch to the buffet table

Best fruit salad and a complete hit everytime I bring it to a party. Wouldn't change a thing. Some partygoers suggested serving with a pound cake or even angelfood cake......sounds good to me!

Have been making this salad for a while big hit with anyone who eats it.  5 stars as is!  I add miniature marshmallows, takes care of the excess sauce.  Also add maraschino cherries.

This was delicious!! The only thing I didn't do was add the orange juice concentrate and that was because I didn't have it..It was still creamy and delicious without it.  I also added some cherries and that was great too! My kids loved it!

I made this for a huge pig roast and it went over great! People were pointing it out for others to try. The only change I made was omitting the bananas. It was cool and refreshing on a hot day. Next time I make it I'm going to try maraschino cherries at my sons request. I have no idea why it would have been bitter (from a previous review) unless some of the fruit was bad. Mine was cool and creamy.

I crave this stuff and make it for many family gatherings.  Here are my changes: Lessen the milk, no apples or bananas, add chopped strawberries, cut the sliced peaches into more like thick chunks, and sub cool whip (i use fat free) for the sour cream. I also often add a little more o.j. for more orange flavor.  Yummy! I have had many recipe requests from family and friends!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very runny. There was also a surplus of dressing. I read over others suggestions and I decided to give this recipe another shot since it has potential. Update: I made it again with some changes and it still didn't come out right. I won't make this again.

This salad tasted alright, but it does not appeal to the eye.  I took it to a fellowship and someone thought it was potato salad.  Even though I had it on the dessert table, people were still confused.  I wouldn't make it again.

This was really good and went well at a friends bbq. I doubled the recipe and instead of using 3cups of milk, I did 2 cups.  I took the advice of draining the fruit overnight, mix the sauce a few hours beforehand and added it to the fruit before I left. As for the apples, I reserved some pineapple juice and soaked the apples in the juice for about 15 min to keep them from turning brown and added them last,good tip from one of the comments. Used maraschino cherries and omitted the bananas. I kept it on ice while outside and it never got runny.

Great salad.  I brought it to my grandson's graduation party on Saturday and everyone loved it.  I had several people ask me for the recipe.   I used only 1 cup of milk, sugar free pudding and left out the bananas (because I hate bananas), added some strawberries and red grapes.  It was wonderful and not too runny.  I will definitely make it again.

It is very good as a snack or dessert.  I made the recipe exactly but I would suggest using only 3/4 to 1 cup of milk.  I only added half of the pudding mixture I prepared.  Also make sure your fruit is completly drained so your dish will not be watery.  Whip cream is great as a topping.

I think more bananas are a must, if you like bananas. Also, I prefer more fruit in general with this much dressing. Pretty good.

This was so so. I used fat free sour cream and skim milk. Mine was not soupy. I dont think the combination of fruits works well and basically you are just making orange flavored pudding and mixing it with fruit. I wont make this again. No one said they hated it but no one wanted any more.

Very easy to make.  I thought the dressing made it kind of 'soupy'.  It didn't say in the directions to drain the can of mandarin oranges, so I didn't.  If I made again I would definately drain the oranges.

This was awesome, I made it for a Easter potluck and doubled the recipe.  I used canned fruit cocktail, bananas, apples and added some coconut too.  Also, I added a few dashes of vanilla as another reviewer suggested.  A great twist on the same old version.  Thanks

There should be a ton more stars for recipes like this. If it didn't make so much, there wouldn't be any left for our Easter dinner. Absolutely wonderful!!! If you don't try this, you are missing out completely!!

Delicious recipe!  Definitely reduce milk to 1 cup, and the addition of colored miniature marshmallows is a nice addition, along with almost any fruit combination.  Wonderful!

I don't recall how long ago I printed this recipe.  My copy says orange juice not concentrate.  I hope adding concentrate will improve the flavor.

I have to agree with everyone else.  It's a fine recipe and easy to make.  Throw in a tablespoon of vanilla to improve what is already a wonderful taste.

Awesome.Sure to please for any party or dessert. Did do as suggested with refridgerating drained fruit overnight and draining in for a second time next day. With dressing did do 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream for a "thicker" dressing.  Also add some grapes and strawberries for color.

This was a great recipe.  I made it for a baby shower and it was the hit of the day.  Very yummy.  I also cut back on the milk and sour cream.  It didnt seperate and any leftovers were great the next day.  It is now a family favorite.

This was okay when I first made it then the bananas started turning brown and they totally dominated the other fruits in taste, so I removed them. The pudding started to seperate also due to the orange juice. It didn't look very appetizing either, it was just all the same color(pastel orange color) and lumpy. No one ate it at dinner because they thought it was a dessert. It had a good taste at first then it just tasted like banana pudding.

After reading all of the rave reviews, including my best friend, I was disappointed.  My children did not care for it, my husband thought it okay and I probably will not eat any of the leftovers.  Maybe my children will like it better and me too if we use only the favorite fruits, i.e. oranges, bananas and strawberries.

I think this was too soupy, it wasn't anything too great anyway, it was justfruit in orange cream soup, I don't think I'll make this again, maybe if I do, I'll prepare the pudding as on the box and add a tablespoon of the orange juice from the can, that way its not too soupy and it will have the orange flavor.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  I took this to a 2-year old's birthday party at it was a hit with everyone...young and old.  I must have had a dozen people ask me about the recipe.  I took the advice of others and reduced the milk by 1/2 cup.  I also cut the peaches up into small sections, and added strawberries for color. Next time I'll probably add grapes as well. Great receipe!

Great Fruit Salad.  My family isn't crazy about fruit - but they love this!  I add a few more apples for extra nutrition and extra crunch.

After reading other reviews- I drained my fruit all day and cut out 1/2 c. of the milk and I added 5-6 med. apples to add a crunchy taste.  Turned out perfect!  Everybody loved it.  I add the apples right before I mix in the dressing.  They do not turn brown as they are covered with the dressing.  The orange flavoring is very refreshing, different from the usual whip cream topping.

My family thought this was a very good recipe.  I drained all the canned fruit and only used about 1/2 of the dressing.  A also added chopped walnuts which really added some "crunchy" to the otherwise all soft texture.  I also added some well drained halved maraschino cherries for some extra color.  I will make this again as it does have a refreshing flavor.

This was a great addition to Thanksgiving dinner.  I added pomegranite for color and flavor.  I didn't think it was too soupy, I drained my fruits good and after refridgeration, it was thick and yummy.  A keeper.

Make the dressing first and let it set.  Then double all the fruit requirements and it won't be too gloppy/soupy.  My husband didn't like the coconut I added.  If you like nuts (I don't), that might be a good addition.  And what's been said about needing color is true-- add strawberries!  Knowing all this, I might make it again and I think it would be better...

Husband loved it!  I used cheesecake flavored instant pudding instead of vanilla.   And then I was a bit short on sour cream so I used cream cheese to make up the difference.   Very, very creamy!   Other than that I followed the recipe.  Saved it in my recipe box!  Thank you Leagle!

This is really good! I used grapes, pineapple, mini marshmallows, mandarin oranges and bananas. I skipped the apple. Delish!

I make this a lot as we need to lose some weight. I try to use fresh fruit; pineapple, melons, apples-almost anything in season. Every once in a while, my husband will ask for a fruit not in season like peaches and I use canned ones but fresh is always better

I make this for every potluck I go to and it is always a hit!  I use whatever fruits are in season and nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  The concentrated OJ gives it such a great flavor!  I have yet to meet anyone who hasn't loved it!

Is AWESOME! after reading some reviews I used just a cup of milk, turned out great, Just with the first taste marshmallows popped in my head....dont know why haha but I think it will add a extra little sweetness and give it even more of a creamy texture? but anyway Thanks Great Recipe! Definitely going to make it again!

My family has been using a this recipe for many years. We have to watch our sugar intake. So we use sugar free vanilla pudding, and the canned fruit is always no sugar added except the mandarin oranges those we can only find in lite syrup. I put in 2 apples (1 green & 1 red for added color). I bring it to pot lucks and even the people who don't like sour cream love it. It is very refreshing. I am asked to bring this a lot during the summer months.  Debbie B. in Oklahoma

I was SO excited about this recipe by all of the good reviews and my love for orange cream flavors....boy did I get LET DOWN! Mine was just a big bowl filled with water and disappointment! I looked over the recipe twice to make sure that I covered all my bases, maybe I mixed something up - NOPE! Don't waste your time and tastebuds like me just make a regular ambrosia salad!

I have made this several times for summer gatherings and always get asked for the recipe. The orange sauce is subtle and   doesn't overpower the fruit. I added a small amount of whipped cream to the sauce and that gave it a fluffier texture. The most important thing is to drain the fruit as much as possible so it won't be runny.

this was a nice recipe.  it thickened up perfectly and had a great taste.  but the reason for the 4 stars - seemed like much more work where you could just use a peach yogurt or whatever flavor and get the same taste for much less work and calories.  but other than that, it is a good recipe and definitely worth a try. thanks!

I've been making this for a long time and decided I better (finally) rate it! It is sooooo yummy, light, refreshing, and easy to make. The nice thing is that you can choose the fruits you want to use. For the person who gave it one star, are you sure you made this correctly? Definitely try this recipe!

YUM!!! Super easy (just takes a little planning to let it chill the full time). I would try making without sour cream next time...wondering how important it is, since I really didn't get the zip I would've expected from it. It would make the recipe even healthier. A great side salad for any meal, any time of the year.

I made this fruit salad for my girls and they absolutely loved it!  I did add sliced red seedless grapes, coconut, and used French Vanilla Pudding.  It was a big hit!  They ask me to make it about once every two weeks and it doesn't last long!  Great for family get-togethers and picnics.

Good flavor, but texture was off. It wasn't thick and creamy like I was expecting. If I make this again, I would definately mix in a carton of cool whip. The kids didn't even really care for this one.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is a favorite everywhere it take it.  I use red delicious apples cut into chunks, and I also cut my peaches into bite-sized pieces.  It is absolutely critical to drain the fruit very well...I sit it in a strainer while I prepare the sauce (and I do everything in one bowl...mix the sauce, and then throw in the fruit).  I do recommend adding the bananas as late as possible to keep them from turning brown.  If you keep the other fruits covered with the sauce, they won't discolor.  And keep it cold--when it gets warm it gets runny. Be prepared, everyone will want the recipe, and you'll be forced to make it everytime you go to an event!

I took the advice of other reviews and drained the fruit overnight in the fridge. Also some people said there was way too much sauce,and it does seem like it at first while it's all liquidy, but actually it was just right. I put the whole thing together the night before our party and the sauce thickened up nicely so that it wasn't too saucy. Plus by the time you add the last minute fruits (nanas, apples) that takes up the extra sauce. It doesn't look like a lot when done but the recipe as-is was enough for the 16 people, although mostly kids, we fed.

Cut back on the milk by 1/4 cup, and squeezed out the pinapple and oranges thoroughly.  Very yummy and flavorful!

My sister is the pickiest eater; textures make her gag.  Whenever I bring this salad to a family potluck she's the first to put it on her plate and the first to ask for the leftovers.

This is a great, simple dessert.  Everyone always loves it when I prepare it.  Do follow the advice to make sure the canned fruit is completely drained!!  Updating review to add:  You don't have to double the cream if you double the recipe.  The recipe as written provides a lot of cream - I made this just yesterday and tripled the canned fruits and doubled the fresh but used the original cream measurements and had more than enough.  Everytime I've doubled the cream, I've had to throw a good bit of it away.  There were also suggestions from other reviewers to keep the cream and fruit separate until you're ready to serve - I do that as well.  Also be sure to put the bananas and apples just before you serve it, else they get discolored.  Yummy!!!

I loved the taste of this - not too much of an orange taste - it was just right!  Be sure to cut the sliced peaches into bite-size pieces. I took this to a potluck and hardly anyone tried it (though those that did really liked it). I had it in a glass bowl, so I thought the presentation was really nice.  Perhaps sprigs of fresh mint or a pretty strawberry would be nice...I'll definitely attempt this again since the taste was worth it.  My 5-yr old triplets loved it for a snack!

Great recipe.  I made this for a 4th of July party and didn't even get a chance to have any.  When I got to the bowl it was empty!  I'll take everyone's word that it was awesome as I had to give the recipe out to several people.  Thanks again!

This was wonderful!  Like other reviews advised, I kept my fruit separate from the dressing until closer to serving time.  The fruit drained overnight.  When I did mix the fruit with the dressing I put the fruit in my trifle glass and added a little fruit, then some of the dressing, then kept repeating that. I did not use all the dressing. I used peaches, oranges, pineapple, strawberries, grapes, and blueberries.  For the dressing I used pudding mix, 1 c. 1/2 and 1/2, oj concentrate, and 1/2 c. sour cream.  As others said it doesn't LOOK great, but it sure tastes great!!!

This is a sweet and delicious fruit salad.  I like it very much, but it didn't really have the wow factor for me, and it also has a bit of an issue with being runny.  I reduced the milk to 1 cup and drained the canned fruit for a while before mixing the ingredients together, and that kept it from getting too runny for a day or two.  But since I made this for just myself, it took me about four days to eat it, and it was extremely soupy by the time I finished it off.  If I make it for family (which is likely), I'll probably keep the pudding mixture separate from the salad and let people add it to their salad as they like.  That's mainly because some of my family is lactose-intolerant, but it also allows people more freedom in choosing the amount of topping that's right for them, and any leftover fruit can be drained later without ruining the salad.  I substituted a pint of fresh strawberries for the mandarin oranges, but I don't think the kind of fruit used really matters in this recipe.  The dressing would be great just as a dip for apples or any other fruit.

this was pretty good, i think i might have added a little too much OJ, but still tasty.  i used fresh strawberries, blueberries, grapes, canned mandarin oranges, pineapple tidbits and...i think that's it. it was pretty popular, though i did have a little leftover - which was AOK with me! i did, like others, let the fruit drain overnight. i also bought the big (5 oz?) box of pudding by accident, but i ended up using about 3/4 of it to thicken up the dressing - that way if there was any liquid left in the fruit the salad wouldn't get runny.  worked PERFECTLY! thanks a ton for sharing!

This has great flavor. I took it to a pot luck and got asked for the recipe by several people. The only thing is, I wish I had read the other comments about this salad. It's really soupy. Yes, I drained the fruit, but I think next time I'll drain it overnight. And maybe cut back on the milk a little. BUT, try it, try it. It's wonderful.

Made this for a church pot luck and everyone raved about it!  To save a few calories, used sugar free pudding, and light ingredients where ever possible. Still turned out delish!

Taste-wise, this was delicious! The orange sauce was so good that I wanted to drink it. :-) The sauce was quite runny though even after draining the fruit mix several times. I had to tell people that the juice from the salad is not from the fruit but the actual sauce. Then they appreciated the salad more. I'll follow other posts' advice and make the sauce less watery next time.

While the idea is good, the finished product does need help.  After draining the canned fruit overnight, the salad was still too watery.  We had to put it in bowls to eat it.  Next time I will add more pudding mix or whipped cream.

Love this! I make this every holiday - and everyone loves it! I generally add whatever fruit I have on hand or pick up. The peaches that have cinnamon syrup are delicious in this - and I generally add a little cinnamon to the mix. But - we love cinnamon!

This was INCREDIBLE!  I made it for a two-year-old's birthday party, and it was a huge hit.  I added some halved seedless red grapes and a cup of blueberries.  I didn't use any milk, and I used reduced-far sour cream and half of what was called for, and it was so yummy.  Thanks Lori!

This recipe is great! I did not have orange juice concentrate so I used fresh orange juice and added 1 tsp orange extract and a Tbsp of powdered sugar.  I also used canned pears and fresh blueberries instead of apples and bananas. I drained all of the canned fruit really well. Next time we are going to try adding 1 cup of mini marshmallows.  What a great recipe - so versatile!  Thanks for sharing!

The orange dressing for this salad is AWESOME. I made as-written with sour cream, and found it perfectly sweet. I think subbing cool-whip would make this much sweeter, more like a dessert than a side. I reduced the milk to just over a cup, and still had WAY too much dressing. Which isn't a problem, as it makes a great dip to snack on with fruit, but I think omitting the milk as someone suggested would make this perfect. Thanks so much for sharing.

I have a family member that can't have any food with artificial orange flavoring.  This was such a huge success because he loves orange fruit desserts but hadn't been able to eat one in years!  I substituted 3/4 cup cool whip for the sour cream.  The result was a bit runny for my taste so I added an extra banana and an extra 1/2 apple.  I also added a couple of handfuls of cherry flavored dried cranberries.  Once it thickened there was plenty of the filler to cover all the fruit but the fruit didn't seem like it was swimming in tons of pudding mixture.  I will definetly make this one again.

I've made this stuff twice now and both times people asked me for the recipe.  It was a HUGE hit!!!!  I left out the milk though b/c it makes it WAY too runny...and the juices from the fruit add the perfect amount of juice so it's not too thick!
HIGHLY Recommneded!!!

This is a GREAT low-calorie snack and an ideal dish to take to get-togethers. I add sugar to the creamy ingredients (just add as you go to taste). Without sugar I feel it's a little too bitter. Also I omit the peaches and use two apples and grapes.

This fruit salad is awesome!  I added a little coconut for added flavor and texture.  This was a hit at my work meeting.

I used banana cream pudding instead of vanilla because that's what I had on hand.  The banana flavor overpowered the orange.  I didn't care for it.  Will try again with vanilla pudding.

This, to me, is more like a dessert. I chopped the peaches & used a jar of maraschino cherries in place of the apple & banana. It's very good- my husband loved it. It would be great poured in a pie shell & maybe frozen!?!

Such a yummy treat.  Substituted sour cream with whipped topping, reduced milk a little, and added mini marshmellows and chopped pecans for texture.  Also added cherries.  You can use whatever fruit you have on hand, just be sure to drain any canned fruit very well first (several hours to overnight).

Delicious - I will definitely make it again.  I did drain my mandarin oranges because we are not huge fans.  I loved the vanilla pudding base. Great recipe.

This is fantastic and I am always asked for the recipe when I bring it to a pot luck or make it for company.  You can also make it sugar-free/fat free, which is a bonus.

I will make this again, however, I will substitue the sour cream with cool whip for a sweeter, creamier flavor.  Didn't care for the sour cream & omitted the apples.

Easy and tasty, but I think I'd like it a bit thicker so next time I will use 1 cup milk like others suggested. I added grapes and coconut. The dressing goes well with just about any fruit so add whatever you like.

Pretty good stuff.  We changed it up quite a bit to bring the calories down a lot.  Used sugar-free pudding mix, fat free sour cream, skim milk.  Nice change of pace.

Delicious!  I did as many suggested and used less milk and sour cream.  I also substituted raspberries for the bananas and drained the fruit really well (about 3 hours total) before mixing this.  It was a big hit on Easter!

Absolutely delicious.  Received rave reviews at two family parties over New Year's weekend.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and reduced sour cream to 1/2C and Milk to 1C.  Had only one banana on-hand, so supplemented with red grapes.  Yummy!

I wasn't crazy about the taste of this - I think it was something about the pudding. I didn't use quite a bit of the sauce - it would have been very soupy.

Only four stars because it needs the modifications.

I read the reviews and made this recipe a year ago and it was EXCELLENT.  The orange flavor was really, really good.

I used and extra can or two of fruit and drained the fruit in a colander (but only for about 10-15 minures).

I'm definately going to make this one again soon.  It's been too long!

Very good fruit salad.  I loved how quick it was to put together.  I also used a large box of pudding and drained the fruit for about an hour so the dressing wouldn't be soupy. Make sure to add the bananas right before serving so they won't be brown.  The down side is that it doesn't look appealing the day after if there is any left.  Will make again.

This is a very good fruit salad recipe!  I added some seeded grape halves and quartered strawberries to the recipe as well.  I made a double batch for a gathering of people and got lots of great comments on it!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I'll be keeping this one!

I liked the slight orange tang of this salad, but it didn't go over as well as I had hoped.  I contributed it to the salad bar at a local fundraising meal, and had more left at the end of the night than I had hoped.  I did add some coconut to it.  That might have scared some people away.  Overall, I think it had a nice balance of tart and sweet.

This recipe was fantastic.  I took note of other reviewers comments and added an entire container of strawberries, cut in forths; an extra sliced banana; an extra apple (I left them both unpeeled); and two cups of red grapes, whole. I let the canned fruit strain in a colinder and even placed a paper towel on top to soak up extra juices.  I used sugar free pudding because that was all they had left at the store.  I'm sure it cut out calories, but it left an aftertaste.  It was still very good, but I will make it with regular pudding next time.  I think this will become a summer standby, a yummy way to eat lots of fruit!

This recipe was very tasty!  I added one apple and a pound of fresh strawberries to the fruit mixture; I also added some whipped topping to the dressing.  I would have liked the dressing to be a little less runny - even with the added whipped topping, it went all over peoples' plates.  Next time, I will add more sour cream and whipped topping - or perhaps yogurt, even - to help thicken the dressing.

This is a great kid/adult recipe. One of my adult friends could not stop eating it! I left off about 1 1/2 cups of the orange dressing for fear of making it too "soupy". I added an extra bananna. Along with that I added a few rasberries and blueberries for color. I also topped it with cinnamon. With 4 adults and two kids it was gone.
This was a fun change and yummy recipe!

Made a double batch of this for my aunt's 80th birthday party and everyone liked it very much.  Several asked for the recipe.  One batch of dressing was enough for about three quarts of fruit.  Since I used a lot of fresh fruit, the 'prep time' was a lot longer than ten minutes.  It was worth it, tho.
Definately a keeper!

Great recipe. I think the dressing can be reduced by 25% for the amount of fruit in the salad. The orange taste is great.

This was very delicious! I did follow the suggestions of letting the pudding set-up in the frig for appx 1 hr b4 adding the fruit and I also drained the juices well so it wouldn't be too "soupy" and it turned out to be a real crowd pleaser!
I am going to experiment with some other fruits too! Fun Fun Fun

Very good. I added a extra apple and added bananas before it was served so the color wouldn't change. Next time I will try adding strawberrys and doubling the pudding to thicken it. I also added the drained juices to OJ and it made a tasty drink! Thanks for the recipe!

What a GREAT recipe for fruit salad, the best I've ever tasted.  I don't care if it is a little "runny", I'll just drink it, it's THAT good!!!  Have lost count of the number of rave reviews I've received for Lori's recipe!!!  Thank you, thank you for sharing it.

I made this for my son's family birthday party and most everyone loved it.  I made a mistake though and used fresh mandarins and got some comments that it would have been perfect had I used the canned instead because the fresh were a little sour.  I think I'll add some marischino cherries next time, but will definitely make again.  Thanks!

The flavor was excellent, my only complaint was that it was a little bit too "soupy" in texture.  Otherwise, it was great!

This was a great recipe.  I had several people ask me for the recipe.  It's a very different taste than a traditional fruit salad which is what makes it so appealing.  Definitely worth a try!

It's like a thick orange julius over fruit - delicious.  Based on other reviews, I drained the fruit really well, and added grapes, strawberries and took out the bananas.  I made this on Thanksgiving for my boyfriends family.  I was so worried because his mom is such a good cook and is really picky.  It was a hit!  They kept the left overs and finished it!

I found this to be runny.  I had to add more pudding to thicken it up.  It did have a good creamy orange flavor though.  Would only make again if requested by others.

I liked it, but I don't think I would serve it at a party or anything.  It was a little on the heavy side, even though I used lowfat ingredients.  I'd probably cut out the bananas and add some different fruit for color and variety.  The bananas get a little slimey.

Sorry...wasn't impressed. Followed the recipe EXACTLY and found it to be a soupy mess. Although it tasted pretty good, the presentation of it scared people at work into NOT trying it.

This recipe was wonderful. It was very quick and easy to make. I added 1/2 cup of dried cherries and pecans, which is good because all of the other ingredients kind of blend together color wise. It is more of a dessert salad than a regular fruit salad. Try this recipe. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

This is the best!!!  I had to give the recipe to all the ladies at work, they loved it!!!  I added grapes to give it a little color.  Don't forget to drain the fruits thoroughly or it will be soupy.

This is wonderful and very healthy, too.  I used sugarfree vanilla pudding to cut out even more calories.  I made it for a potluck in August and I am still getting calls from people wanting the recipe and it's nearly December!  I have made it since then, too, and I can't get enough!  DELICIOUS!!!

I used the sugar free pudding mix and lite canned fruits. I used the fruit juices as much as possible instead of the milk. I will try it with greek yogurt instead of sour cream next time. My husband loved it  before I got it to the refrigerator. Also, I put blueberries in too.

Excellent flavors but it was way too watery! I added a container of strawberries and a second apple and it was still too watery. Next time I will  use half the amount of milk and plain or vanilla greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.

Wonderful! This was a huge hit with everyone who has tasted it. As others have noted, there is way more dressing than needed for the amount of fruit called for. I just add to cover fruit well and save the rest for another batch. It is quite sweet, so we have eaten it for both salad and dessert. Either way, it is great!

My family loves fruit so I thought this would be a huge hit but they didn't like it all that much and I cannot figure out why.  I mike make again and tweak to see if they like it better.

Don't do what I did.  I used a combination of canned Fruit (pineapple, mandarin oranges, cherries) and Frozen fruit which I thawed for two days (Strawberries, blueberries.)  Even after draining over and over, when I put the ingredients together, it made the worst looking mess. However, it tasted very good, so I covered it up with whipped cream.

Unfortunately after sitting in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, the whipped cream turned into soup on top of the salad, so just before serving I added some more whipped cream.  By the time everyone was served (12 people), the whipped cream had melted again.

My friend and I got a good laugh over it, but if I ever make it again, I will use only fresh fruit (except the pineapple and oranges).

PS  Despite the problems I had with the salad, people commented that it tasted very good.

WoW!  This was terrific! No matter what you do to suit your personal preference (I skipped the bananas, added marshmallows and used less sour cream), but I'm sure it'll turn out great.  I drained my fruit as well for a couple hours prior to adding the dressing.    , this was good! Going to eat more right now :)

This salad was fabulous!  The orange juice added a delicate taste of citrus that my family just loved!  I added fresh red grapes and mini marshmallows.  This is a new family favorite.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and mine came out very runny.  I don't think I would use vanilla pudding again after reading the ingredients and use a mixture of yogurt and sour cream instead with some orange zest.

I think this recipe needs some sugar and the fruit could be doubled.  Too much 'dressing' and not enough fruit.  I doubt I will make it again.  It just tastes okay.

I thought the salad was good, but my family did not care for it.  I had to eat most of it myself. It did seem to be a little runny and I did cut back on the milk a little.  I will probably not make this again.

We really enjoyed this creamy citrus salad and will make it again.  Used sugar free pudding mix, fat free sour cream and fat free milk.  Next time I'll use a sweeter apple, our Granny Smith was a little too tart for my taste.

This was a crowd pleaser, but a little runny in my opinion.  I might drain the fruit for a little longer.

I modified this recipe because of my lack of items on hand, I must say it was still pretty good.  I can't wait to make it again the way the recipe calls.

I read all the previous reviews and decided to try it for a harvest dinner.   It didn't look real appetizing, but it got rave reviews from all.

Very good!  I made just like it said and it wasn't runny at all, if anything it could have used more liquid.  It actually was far more gelatin then I expected, which was different then described making me think the orange juice was still too cold when I added it.  Overall a great salad.

Excellent recipe. I did some modifications though. Some of the ingredients can't be obtained here in Singapore.
1) Instead of Instant pudding mix, I use non-fat pudding (4 cups)
2) 1 cup of Low fat Sour cream
3) Instead of frozen orange juice, I used Just Juice orace juice.
4) Used freash peace instead of canned peaches.
5) Whipped everything together instead of mixing them (2 minutes with whisk). 
6) Left the cream overnight and whipped them again the next day before mixing in the fruits, refegrate 3 hours before serving. The cream stayed thick n nice.
7) Added kiwi fruit too. :)

Everyone really liked this.  I found it okay, but I prefer a fresh fruit salad w/ no sauce or cream.  But since everyone else really liked it I gave it four stars.

this was good- used it for a little girl's tea party.  It's very rich for a fruit salad, though- a little goes a long way!  I used pineapple, blueberries, banana, strawberries, and mandarine oranges.  Doesn't last more than one day- not good leftovers.

I thought this tasted great, but hardly anybody ate it because they thought it was cheesey fruit because of the orange color!  But once I went around the room and made them try it, everyone loved it.  Next time will add even more fruit, and maybe some marshmellows to take the illusion of cheese away.

We really enjoyed this salad. I would cut down on the milk, it was to soupy. I would also use a little bit more of the orange juice-next time I am going to try a frozen berry unstead of the o.j..

Love the pudding orange juice combo with sour cream!  Am thinking that alone without fruit would be a nice pudding dessert... 

I made the recipe exactly as stated, and hadn't read any reviews beforehand -- drained the fruit knowing it would be way runny and weird if I didn't.  Glad I did.  

I have a huge sweet tooth and found this perfectly sweet -- subbing cool whip, or adding more sugar  etc... would put it over the top for me.  

When it isn't the holidays it'll make a great summer desert -- over angel food cake or even short cake.

Am definitely adding this to my holiday tradition(s).

Thank You Lori!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I used some advise from other reviewers and omitted the sour cream and milk but substituted Cool Whip, added 1/2 bar of cream cheese, added grapes, chopped pecans, fresh peach, omitted the banana and added a can of fruit cocktail, drained.  Mmmm good!

Made this for a work party. Absolutely flavorful, rich-tasting, like a "dreamsicle" pop. I modified a few things, based on reviews--cut back on the milk to 1/4 cup, drained all juices from canned veggies to prevent fruit from browning, added red seedless grapes, sliced apples, strawberries, fresh pears.  You can play around with this recipe and it just delicious. Better than the Pistachio dessert. A winner! Thanks. Alison

This wasn't as great as I thought it would be. But it was good. It was just a little runny and tart for my taste. I followed directions exactly, so I'm not sure if that's the way it was supposed to be. It was good. My kids gobbled it up and wanted more.

I would say this recipe is good and very tasty, but not totally amazing.  I omitted the apples (too lazy to chop them) and used less milk per others' suggestions.

Very easy and tasted great!  Didn't set as well as I had hoped, it was a little runny.  I would definitely make it again.

I also took some of the recommendations and added cool whip, but used fresh fruit with coconut and dried cranberries.. A huge hit at Easter!

Pretty good, with A LOT of modifications.  Added whole container of cool whip to make it pudding consistancy.  Will make again, but change it up quite a bit.

Everyone enjoyed it and asked for seconds.  I will probably make this one again.  I substituted cool whip for the sour cream.

Killer!  I have made this salad for three different audiences and had unanimous results....YUM!  The orange concentrate is the secret.  As for substituting your favorite fruit, (pears, fruit cocktail) be not afraid. Perfect for the Fourth of July, or absolutely anytime.

Wow!! My mom brought this salad for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! I could not stop raving about it! It is good enough to be served as a dessert. I saved some for the next day and it was just as good, but I did have to remove the bananas. Loved it! Thanks for inspiring my mom!

Absolutely Fantastic in my opinion. I used little less sour cream and added a couple more apples.I also blended in the o.j. when it was still icey .. I do prefer this recipe without bananas. I imagine there are alot variations you could do with this recipe. Quick, easy - something you can teach your kids. Highly recommended.

Very good and easy fruit salad. However it tasted more like bananna pudding than oranges.

I thought this was a delicious salad!  I used fresh pineapple and fresh peaches - rather than the canned as specified in the recipe.  It was a bit runny and I wanted it to hold together a little better so I added toasted coconut and toasted pecan bits.  My guests called it "food of the gods!"
