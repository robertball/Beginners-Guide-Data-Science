This is my recipe, and I just want to add some comments about some of the comments in the reviews.  Some have mentioned that the sauce is too sweet or tastes too much like tomato sauce.  My guess is that the wrong prepared salsa is being used.  You need to use a high quality prepared FRESH salsa, not that nasty stuff in jars or cans that is mostly tomato sauce.  I usually find it in the deli section of my grocery store.  It comes in mild, medium, or hot.  I prefer the medium, but if you think this recipe is too hot or not hot enough, use the mild or hot versions.  If you want it even hotter, add some chopped jalapenos.  When I called the sauce spicy, I meant using lots of spices, not "hot" spicy.  Also, it is not critical if you don't want to simmer the meat sauce for the extra time.  I just think the extra simmering gives the spices a chance to meld with the meat for a better flavor and it also thickens the sauce.  I made this several times before I submitted it to make sure I got the spices right.  The red sauce also makes a very tasty salsa.  Enjoy!

I have tried so many enchilada recipes, and finally this is the one!  No need to make changes; it is perfect as is.  I did use corn tortillas since that is all the store had (strange), but I doubt that it made any difference.  Even the best restaurant enchiladas I have had don't top these.

I loved these but perhaps because I did it my way.
I have fixed this recipe both ways over the past month and I have to say I like using a 28oz can of Old El Paso Enchilada Sauce (available across the country). 
 I prepare the beef as described BUT substituted 1 1/2 cups bottled Pico de Gallo Salsa for the red enchilada sauce and the beef broth.
AND I always use corn tortillas, flour is not the Mexican way! Just wrap the corn tortillas in a dish towel and nuke them 30 seconds at #8 and their ready to fill.
 Otherwise, everything else the same!

This dish is delicious! The directions in the recipe make it seem harder and longer than it really is. I did change a few things like added jalapenos and red peppers to make it more spicy. It also does not take much time to make... at first glance it seemed long and hard but if you just go with it it will turn out amazing! My boyfriend loved it.

Wow, my house smells like a restaurant and the flavor of these is fab! The meat mixture alone could be made the day before, or made to go over rice. Very tasty recipe. I cook for our church freezer and this would be great to freeze and let others just reheat.

I really liked this recipe, much more than the one I was using before. And the fact that's from scratch make me like it even more. I don't live in the US, so "use a can of ... or a package of ..." very often don't work for me, just because I can't buy it here. Not sure I would anyway, thinking how things taste better when they are made from scratch, and also I can control what I add to it. 
Though I had to make few small changes to fit my taste. First of all, I am not a huge fan of a very spicy food, so I cut the chili powder on half and it was still very spicy for me (though my husband loved it :) Next time will add even less. Second, I used a large can (28oz) of tomatoes with juice mashed with blender until smooth) and cut tomato paste in half, omitted basil and cut chicken broth to 1.5 cups (because I already had more liquid in tomatoes). Third, I didn't understand why you need to keep cooking the meat sauce for 30 more minutes after adding cheese.. I cooked it for 20 min or so, added cheese, covered with lid and turned off the heat. Followed the recipe in other steps, will make it again!

Very good sauce that makes the recipe top notch, I used Ancho chili powder, nice flavoring. My salsa and chicken broth were homemade, and I used my Immersion blender in the pan to make a nice smooth texture since my salsa was pretty chunky. I skipped the warming tortillas in foil stage, just used them straight out of the package. I made my own Mexican blend of cheese with Colby Jack, and Kraft jalapeno cheddar. I also added one can of black beans to the meat mixture to make fuller enchiladas, and the remainder of my ck broth worked fine in place of beef broth.

We did not like this recipe.  Tasted more like a spaghetti sauce and using flour tortillas gave it a weird texture.  We let the sauce cook for two hours hoping to get some of the tomato taste out but that did not help much.

These enchiladas turned out very yummy! The tortillas soak up a lot of the sauce when baking, making them extra flavorful. I didn't understand why I needed to cook the sauce for an extra 30 minutes though.

I made this last night for me and my hubby and we loved it.  I don't know why people are saying it's sweet, we thought the spices were perfect. The only things I did different is I make my own corn tortillas and I used pico de gallo instead of the salsa.  It must make a difference on what kind of salsa you are using, the bought stuff can be very sweet sometimes, maybe just read the ingredient list to see how much sugar is in it or just make your own its way better anyways. Loved it, it's a keeper.

I make simple enchiladas all the time with the sauce in a can.  My husband wouldn't have known this recipe was any different unless I told him.  It was nice to use the recipe since I didn't have any canned sauce on hand, but I won't go through the trouble next time.  OR I will make a large batch and freeze just the sauce so I have it available.  Overall the flavor was great, just wasn't worth the effort.

I used fresh tomatoes rather than tomato paste. There was more sauce than needed so I did 3 additional cheese enchiladas.

Enchiladas are traditionally made with corn tortillas. Same with tacos. This is what Mexicans call a "wet" burrito.

I really like this recipe, however, I made significant changes, and some not intentionally but out of sheer cluelessness. The first time I made it, I did not realize that the meat is one thing and the sauce the other, because when I read that I needed to add sauce to the beef, I simply added the sauce that I had made according to the recipe and not the special enchilada sauce, which I didn't have anyway. So I ended up stuffing the tortillas with the same mix that I was also pouring over them. Also, I only had small corn tortillas so that's what I used. I don't eat cheese so that's another thing that was different. In any case, in the end it was all kind of like a lasagne, but everybody who ate it loved it, so I just kept making it the wrong way each time. I will try to follow the recipe closely once I actually remember to get all ingredients.

Excellent. Used corn tortillas because, well, that's what enchiladas are made of. This will not be a weeknight dinner, because it did take a good bit of time. But, oh, they were good! My very picky son ate them for lunches until they  were gone (I always make extras for leftovers...I tripled this recipe), and said he REALLY likes them. High praise indeed! For a change, every one in my family really likes this.

Our  family loved this recipe.  Easy to make.  But this is not spicy or sweet.   It's just right. The best enchilada sauce I've ever made.  I have tried many recipes from this site.  Better than canned. It does take some time but make double the recipe. The sauce freezes well.  That way I have extra meals  at my fingertips. When I need them.   My husband like spicy food so he spices with hot sauce when he serves his up.   I used beef broth instead of chicken. More onions more garlic.  I have used both flour and corn tortillas.   This is the enchilada recipe for our family. Thank you Vicki.           CARLA   T.

I am so impressed with this recipe! I don't think there is anything that I'd change! I used large sized tortillas and the fit nice and snuggle in a large dish. My favorite thing was the red sauce. Perfect balance of flavors, I ended up putting it over the beans and rice sides! Delicious but took some time. I also want to add I used half a jar of on the border chunky salsa. I also didn't have any fresh cilantro,but still don't think I was missing any thing without it.

Excellent depth of flavor! It does take a long time to make, but I skipped the extra simmer on the beef because I was afraid of overcooking the meat. I used a pepper jack cheese blend, and substituted more canned enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce as I did not have any. I used Reser's restaurant style salsa. I think some reviewers who have found this sweet must have used sweet salsa. I didn't find it sweet at all. Served with Mexican Rice III from this site. Will make again.

I made this a couple of days ago. I followed the recipe for the filling exactly but I used "The Best Red Enchilada Sauce" (also on this website) instead for the sauce. They were so good! My sister raved about them and even offered me $10 if I would give her another one.

The is recipe is great. I made it as instructed. We really liked the sauce. I’ve been using a packet or canned but looking for something I know what the ingredients are. We really liked the flavor. The leftovers were even better. The only thing I found is my flour tortillas seemed soggy day two. I think next time I will cook longer or differently or maybe use a corn tortilla.

Really good. made it exactly as recipe. I think next time I will use corn tortillas with a quick fry instead of flour so that it more like an enchilada and less like a wet burrito.... The Red sauce is absolutely delicious and will keep that and use it in everything.

Yes only 2 tsp of chili powder and corn tortilla which it made sixteen.i also made my own Spanish rich which was the perfect complements.  

I offered cheese, one chopped tomato, some shredded lettuce, sour cream and salsa for added flavors.

I used store bought enchilada sauce, but the recipe still turned out perfect! This is better than any enchiladas in any restaurant I've been to. I'm making them for the family again tonight after several requests. AMAZING!

These are the best enchiladas I’ve ever made.  I think the homemade sauce makes a world of difference in the taste.  I made some extra sauce and mixed up some canned refried black beans with some sauce, garlic and onion and added to the enchiladas along with the beef sauce.

Oh my my.  Without a doubt one of the best dinners I have ever produced in my humble kitchen!  Takes a long time to pull it off but it is so worth it.  If you are short on time, make the sauce the day before.

Wow, this was ehmerzing (amazing)!  I’ve tried other beef enchilada recipes and they were disappointing.  The hubs and I both enjoyed these. I forgot the 1/2 cup of prepared salsa but the red sauce was still so good!  Thank you so much for the recipe.

With this recipe, I've finally succeeded in making enchiladas we like as much as or better than a restaurant's.  I followed the recipe for the red sauce almost exactly (veg broth because that's what I had). I used chorizo instead of ground beef (do it!) therefore I skipped the seasonings in the meat filling.  I used pepper jack for the cheese because it's our favorite.  I agree 100% with the recommendation to choose the right salsa - fresh from the deli and not too sweet. This recipe is a keeper!!

So good! We  had an extra tri-tip steak that had been BBQ'd, so I made the meat sauce without the meat and stirred in the perfectly med-rare chopped up tri-tip at the end so as not to overcook it. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. So good we made it again 3 days later!!

The flavor of the meat was scrumptious.  My whole family enjoyed it.  It took extreme will power to not stuff ourselves.  The leftovers the next day were even tastier.   This is a must try.

Yuuuum!! I'll be adding this one into my regular rotation. I didn't put salsa in the red sauce because it was a perfect sauce without it. I used Mexican Chili Powder, which has more heat, and extra sharp white cheddar in place of the shredded Mexican cheese. It was perfect!

Excellant, I've made it twice.  I did add more cilantro.  I always increase cilantro in all recipes, my favorite herb next to basil.  This recipie has been added to my cookbook, I will make it often.

I love all recipes because most of the recipes I try from this site are great and this one did not disappoint.  These enchiladas were restaurant quality, actually they were better than anything I can get in a restaurant.  My entire family loved them.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly.  Will definitely be adding this to my repertoire .

I dont try many new recipes because my usual safe bets are meat and potatoes with my picky eaters.  This dish was a hit with everyone.   I  made it with both corn and flour tortillas served with salad with tomato and avocado, rice, and refried beans.  Very delicious and very filling.

Made the recipe to a T and used fresh salsa.  The issue here is the sweetness and tomato taste of the sauce - it is good, but it is  not the correct flavoring for Enchiladas.  My 13 yr old son said, "This is great, just needs a little parmesan on top!" = bc it tastes like an italian meal more than Mexican.  * also, we are in TX and love real Tex-Mex, maybe this could pass as a Mexican dish in other regions of the U.S., but not here.

Excellent recipe!  A bit fussy, but worth it in the end.  The only changes I made were to use Mexican oregano and Ancho chili powder.  Restaurant quality!

Double recipe. I added black beans to the meat mixture. Note - recipe calls for 6 oz tomato sauce and most cans are 8 oz. if you used a whole can that would make sauce have to much of a tomato flavor.  I will use one can for the double recipe and other then that and adding some red pepper flakes I followed the recipe. And I used jar salsa -these were great. I like to really fill my enchiladas so one recipe with black beans added only made 5 enchiladas- so I will definitely cook a double or triple batch next time and freeze meat and red sauce separately so that assembly is easy for a quick meal when needed! And cheese can be changed. I used pepper jack and a sharp aged white cheddar- that was an awesome blend. Thanks for recipe

Nice flavors.  Had a very Tex-Mex spin to it.  I used a spicy salsa and some chipotle pepper powder to increase the heat.   The homemade sauce is much better than the canned stuff...worth the effort.

I changed one thing.....I added black beans. But the seasonings and cooking stayed the same. My hubby hollered out, Omg this is outrageous. Delicious. My picky grandsons ate like men and i cant get one of them to even eat mashed potatoes.  This is goin into my recipe box. Mmmmm mmmmm good stuff. Why people said it was too sweet is beyond me. I loved it.

I spent a very long time in a hot kitchen today to make these enchiladas.  I followed the recipe exactly, no changes at all.  I was so totally disappointed in them that I thought I will never make these again.  I could have made beef enchiladas without a recipe but I chose not to.  Next time I will.  I have never left a negative review on anything.  But, these took a long time and they did not taste good.

I made the meat sauce & spicy red sauce in the morning and assembled and cooked the rest in the evening. Both can be done ahead of time.  If they aren't brought to room temperature before baking, baking time will be a wee bit longer.   My husband & son were  not very happy when they learned what was for dinner BUT they  LOVED it!!!!! They had only eaten a few bites when they were proclaiming I need to make this  again. Thank you!

This recipe is GREAT!  My family loved it, and we are hard to please when it comes to enchiladas. If I/we didn't think it could be any better the day of, let it rest and store for the following day because the flavors come together Fantastic to have the next day. The enchiladas become firm and hold together nicely. I didn't change anything cooked as the recipe stated.  It's already in my family cook book because we all voted "yes".

Have made these twice now and love them. The spicy red sauce is terrific and really worth the time it takes which is not that much actually.  Get it started first as the recipe suggests.
Too bad my store was out of red enchilada sauce so I used green the second time and since I really was craving beef and bean enchiladas I folded 1/2 a can of refried beans into the meat mixture.  That actually helped with the amount of filling which may be a little scant for 10 tortillas.
A great recipe.

Delicious!  Wish I could have gone all out with the spices, but my wife doesn't like spicy.  If you're afraid it will be spicy, get mild salsa and sauce, then I cut the chili powder in half in the red sauce and didn't put any in with the beef.  My wife didn't find it spicy at all when done this way

I added 2 TB sugar to the red sauce as it cooked. It lightened the bitterness I noticed and added a depth to the flavor.

This was very good, though I didn't think it was spicy enough the night I made it. Leftovers were super spicy, though. Overall, I thought it was too much time and not enough "blown away."

this was time consuming making it all at once, but well worth it! 
the red sauce was delicious and i had enough left to put some in the freezer. i only had the small soft corn tortillas, so i made mine like a lasagna, layering the ingredients and it was great!  i especially loved the flavor of the meat filling. great recipe!

The end product turned out great.  The main issue I ran into was the way the recipe itself is laid out.  There seems to be a lot of prep steps that completely left out.

As a red enchilada lover, I hate restaurants for which their is no flavor.  This recipe was very flavorful without too much heat.  The whole family gave two thumbs up.  I did use garden fresh jacks special salsa in the sauce and their was not too much tomato at all.  Topped with some fresh guac, pico  and sour cream and good to go.  This one makes my save folder.

What a great choice for Cinco DI Mayo 5/5/17. I love a recipe that is fairly complicated to put together. This one was well worth The time. Served with Mexican rice and a Margarita on the rocks - what a fantastic meal! Thanks for the recipe.

Made with hot Italian Sausage & fresh cilantro.   Used Mexican style tomatoes.  Only 3 oz tomato paste. Added black beans & corn to meat mixture along with 2 small chipolte peppers before constructing the enchilada.   Didn't add salsa and ckn broth as needed.  Used canned enchilada sauce for the bottom of dish and to top.  Before serving added marinaded tomatoes for those who liked them.  OH MY !    Served with boxed Spanish rice mixed with Mexican stewed tomatoes.

Was a bit of work but made for Sunday dinner so had the time to put it together.  Very tasty.  Both hubby and I liked this a lot and I will be making it again. Couldn't find store bought enchilada sauce and got caught without the ingredients to make homemade.  Used more salsa instead and I'm not sure we could tell the difference. Next time I will make enchilada sauce and see if it's even better. Used flour tortillas and did not do the oven bake thing with them. Just used them straight out of the package. Didn't change anything else. So good!

I made this recipe for dinner this evening and my husband loved it, he said it was the best Mexican dish I have made yet. I substituted mild green enchilada sauce for the red sauce cause it was all I had and doubled all of the spices with the exception of salt, which I always omit . I will add it to the rotation. Thanks for sharing Vickie!

Very good and easy recipe. I make it weekly and change up what I put in it. Sometimes beef, sometimes chicken.

This is the best beef enchilada recipe I've been able to find. I read that one person didn't like it because it wasn't spicy enough. We really love spicy food as well. I add 1/2 teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper to the sauce and chop 2 jalapeños to add to the meat while it is cooking and it is perfect. VERY VERY DELICIOUS!!!!

Wonderful.  Like another reviewer said, it looks like long instructions, but it's not difficult.  It just takes lots of simmer time for flavors to meld.  Yum! Thanks for sharing.

The spicy sauce, at first, tasted more like a pizza sauce than something you would put in a Mexican dish, HOWEVER, when it combines with the enchilada sauce, it works very well! Give it a try.

I have made this many times for my family. This is the only recipe they seem to love. Have tried many others over the years, but this  one is heads above the others. It does take awhile to make, so save a good time slot for this one. Well worth the wait though.
