I would give this recipe 5 stars with the following modifications: seperate the eggs, mix the yolks in with the other ingredients as directed but beat the whites until fluffy, then fold the whites into the mixture.  This will make it more like a souffle in my opinion.  I also add a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to add a little more flavor.

I make a corn souffle, but it is a little different: I use a box of juffy corn bread mix, 1 can of corn, 1 can creamed corn, 2 egs, 1 cup sour cream, 1 stick butter(melted in bottom of baking pan), 1 chopped onion and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese. I mix all ingredients until blended and pour into pan. I then top with more cheese and bake at 350 for 30 minutes, let it cool and cut into squares. Hope you like it!

The idea was great, but the execution was too sweet.  Even my kids thought that there was too much sugar - which kids NEVER say!  I would cut the sugar in half next time.

Getting ready to make the corn souffle for our Thanksgiving dinner and just realized (after having this posted all these years) I did not mention to drain the 2 cans of whole kernel corn!

This was an easy to make...GREAT recipe!!  I cut it in half for 2 of us...but I will be making it for the next family get-together.  I added a butter and crushed corn flake topping for a little extra.  Very creamy inside.  AWESOME!! Thanks Mary Poris!

Made this for Christmas dinner. I added 4 jalapenos and topped with cheese. Got raves! Next time I would make 1/2 batch for a side dish for 6 at a feast.

Followed the advice of  other reviewers and cut down on sugar and added some shredded cheese.  I halved the recipe and wished I hadn't.

This was awesome, it really tasted like a souffle, but I was able to put it together in the morning, then bake when I got home from work.  I used frozen corn b/c it's what I had on hand, Baking Splenda and 1% milk, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Allow the full 1 1/2 hours for baking.  Even though I cut the recipe in half, it needed the  full time to bake.  I will make this again and again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and for some reason, someone at the table made everyone tell their favorite dish. This was the unanimous winner! My cans of corn were 20 oz each, so I just added some extra flour and milk but used the same number of eggs. I also used half the suggested amount of sugar because it seems like alot! (I am a mother, you know!) Overall it was delicious and very easy.

I have made this several times family gatherings and Thanksgiving, and it's always one of the first things gone!  It does make a lot, so if it's just for my honey and I I'll halve it, plus add some shredded white cheddar on top.

This recipe was okay, nothing to write home about.  Think I may try another users suggestion to add jiffy corn bread mix to it as it was kind of a mushy mess.

I have been making corn souffle for Christmas & Thanksgiving for over 10 years and the family demands it....The only twist to the recipe I do is chop about 1/8 of a small onion into tiny pieces and fold into mixture.  And add about 1/2 tsp pepper.  This gives the souffle a little more flavor....never any leftovers.

My mistake was freezing this once it was baked - it became all runny once defrosted. So, my rating is based on my own mistake of freezing it...

This was good, but I thought it was missing something. Maybe next time I'll try it with bread crumbs or crushed Ritz crackers on top. I also thought it was a little too sweet.

This was so good and a great vegetarian dish as well.  I followed the advice to separate the eggs and since I only had one can of creamed corn I used an extra can of regular corn and added a can of cream of celery soup.  I also added the cheddar cheese.  It took longer to set - cooked it for 1 hour 40 minutes.  I served sour cream for garnish and there was no leftovers.

I made this for my family and while everyone ate it and thought it was okay...the only one who absolutely loved it was my 2 year old daughter who gobbled it up.  I didn't think it was much greater than just corn.  I felt like it was a waste of time in the oven.

I goofed and used 3 cans of creamed corn and 1 whole kernel.  It still came out good.   My husband was very impressed.  We are considering taking this for church carry ins.  Prep is super easy, just open the cans and allow time to bake. It is like a vege dessert, who knew it was possible! :)

This was the first time I have ever made a soufflé, and I followed other reviewers suggestions about seperating the eggs and cutting back on the sugar. My family liked it, but we all agreed the corn could have been halved. It also didn't rise like I'd hoped, but I think that was due to my beating the egg whites too much. Tasty recipe, just could be improved a bit.

We had this tonight at a friends house- but she suggested adding a box of jiffy corn bread mix, 1 can of corn, 1 can creamed corn, 2 eggs, 1 cup sour cream, 1 stick butter(melted in bottom of baking pan). Mix until blended and pour into pan and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.

This did not turn out very well for me.  The end result tasted good, but the process was not worth it.  I had to cook it for much longer in order to for it not to be soupy in the middle.

This is a very easy to make side dish that everyone is impressed with!  I halved the sugar and it was still really sweet (but not overly so).  I highly recommend this recipe!

I have never had corn souffle before.  This was good, but I probably wouldnt make it again.  I prefer to keep my veggies simple so they are as healthy as possible.  It is an easy side dish and tasty alternative to plain corn.

I drained the liquid from the can of corn and had no trouble with consistency.

I've had this saved in my recipe box forever, but got tired of waiting for a holiday, so I cut the recipe in half (still took an hour to cook) and served it with a steak dinner.  I seperated the eggs and added a bit of cheddar cheese on the advice of another reviewer.  We really enjoyed this.

Good, but like other reviewers said, too sweet.  Next time I'll probably eliminate the sugar altogether since cream corn is already a bit sweet.  It was a big hit with my Uruguayan friends who had never had "American Thanksgiving" food before!

This wasn't as spectacular as I had expected that it would be and didn't get the raving reviews at meal time as I expected.  It was good, though, I would substitute the one of the cans of whole kernel corn for another can of creamed corn next time.  It tasted like it needed to be a little bit creamier and sweeter.  Overall, pretty good, and I would make it again, with a little bit of a change.

I had never made a corn souffle before, but always enjoyed the frozen versions. I decided to make this particular one because it was simple, being that I had limited ingredients. It did not call for cream cheese and other ingredients I didn't have at the time.  It's great for last minute dinner preps. Missing a little of my expectations w/o cream cheese, but taste and looks great for such simplicity.

Easy and delicious for corn lovers!  I made one change to the recipe by reducing the sugar to three Tblsp.  I think it could even be cut to two T. (I also think green chiles might be a good addition, depending on the menu).  Served this for Thanksgiving and will do again with our Christmas ham.

I've had or made a version of this every year since 1985!  The only modifications I make are to saute about 1/8 of a small onion (chopped very thinly).  I also add salt and pepper.

Well, it's in the oven now, and I have no doubt it will be delicious.  HOWEVER, while dumping in the corn I wondered about draining - and now see that the recipe author said yes, drain.  But I didn't drain, and there's tons of liquid on top in the middle.  So, I'm going to get my turkey baster and suck up what I can of the juice and hope the rest gets a good texture.

Cut the recipe in half AND cut the sugar in half.  Added a bit of cumin and chili powder and some diced jarred jalapenos for a little southwest flair.  Cooked about 1hr 15 min.  Very good side!

It’s wonderful. It’s not about what you would do to change it. You make your corn soufflé .,.,good. I don’t want to know about it. I opened this to use the recipe, not look for yours!

I love corn. I can eat it straight off the cob with no butter, no salt  or any seasoning whatsoever. It is the perfect vegetable and I eat it often.  I saw this recipe as an opportunity to dress it up a little. While the resulting dish was enjoyable, at the end of the day, I would've enjoyed a side of corn with butter & salt just as much. All that the extra ingredients really added was cost, carbs and calories, which I can do without. While it is unlikely that I will make it again, if I did I would definitely tweak it a bit.  I did enjoy it  -  just not enough to justify the extra carbs.

I hadn't had this in years and was excited to make it for our Christmas Eve dinner. I was a little disappointed in that the dish was bland. I think I may add some things to it next time to give it more flavor.

Nice but I would take the recommendations of others and whip the egg whites, omit the sugar all together, and mix the cheese before pouring into baking dish.  I would also spray the pan to prevent a bit of sticking.  I also used fresh corn from two cobs instead of the frozen.   Good base for lots of variations (add peppers, bacon, etc.).  Thanks for the recipe!

Overall, I enjoyed it but it definitely was sweet.  If I made it again, I would cut the sugar as other's suggested.  It was sweet and perfectly edible, but I wish I had read the reviews before I made it.

Fabulous!  I followed  the  recipe  as presented but also added a small can of green chiles.  Great flavor  and  texture  and half of a 9x13 pan disappeared  rapidly amongst four people.  I added a generous  layer of fresh shredded  sharp cheddar towards the  end.  A definite  keeper and I won't  wait  for  a  holiday  to  make  it  again.

this  recipe is good, but as others have said a bit sweet. I would reduce the sugar, add 1 tsp of dried mustard, and add 2 tablespoons of minced dried onion (you could substitute fresh sautéed minced onion if you wish but would increase to 1/4 cup). this, to me gives the recipe a savory twist which is quite delicious!  would also say that this is closer to a corn pudding.

This was good, though not as fluffy as I'd expected from a souffle. I used 2 Tb sugar and 1 lb. bag of frozen corn kernels instead of the canned.

Not very souffle like.  Disappointed.  It was good, but not at all what was described.  Glad I tried it before Turkey Day.  I'd recommend finding a better recipe - unless you have low expectations.

I made this 2 times in the past week for Thanksgiving parties. Both times I added a cup of shredded mont. jack / cheddar blend cheese. The first time I made the recipie with out seperating the eggs. I thought it was very good. Not really 'souffle' but good. Second time I seperated the eggs. I prefered the original recipe. It really depends on what kind of texture you are looking for. The kids prefered the orginal as well.

OK, I hate to say it, but I didn't really like this at all.  I'm not sure if I set my expectations too high because it got such great reviews, but I cooked it for almost 2 hours and it never set.  I was just like eating mushy corn soup.

Hi All,  I made this into a celiac approved recipe by changing to soy milk and corn starch in place of the flour. Oh, I also added a drained can of mild green chilies. It was super!!!  Everyone loved it highly recommend to anyone even done this way.  Beverly Jane

I recently made this recipe with the suggestions to add cheese and seperate the eggs, and was hoping for something really tasty with all the fab reviews. But this was just very bland and not like a souffle to me whatsoever.

Fantastic recipe. I make this every year at Thanksgiving and the family loves it. I used sweet corn instead of regular corn and it added a perfect amount of sweetness.

I saw this recipe and got excited to make it because I love corn and the reviews here were high. I must say I was disappointed. It did not hold together well and was very liquidy at the bottom of the casserole. (Maybe I was supposed to drain the whole kernel corn?) AND in my opinion it was too eggy. I won't make again.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe. And since it is so easy, they want me to make it more often as a side dish with our dinners. I personally thought it was on the sweeter side, they all said it was perfect the way it was. Maybe 3 tablespoons of sugar, instead of 4. But, Great, Anyway!!!!!

This dish has now become an annual Thanksgiving favorite with my family.  I made it one Christmas and my nephews called the following year to ask me to make it for Thanksgiving.  It's super easy to make and the recipe can easily be doubled or halved to suit the occasion.  I also recommend the lead reviewers' suggestion to separate the eggs and beat the whites before folding them in.  You won't be disappointed in the resulting souffle!

My kids and I liked this recipe, but my husband didn't!  I do think it needs a little something, tho.  Maybe sausage or another variety of meat?

I followed other's advice and used half the sugar. It smelled really good, and tasted really good.
