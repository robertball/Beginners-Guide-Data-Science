On your craziest weekdays, this slow cooker cola infused pulled pork can be an easy, comforting meal! I like the fact that this is not loaded with BBQ sauce. Depending on the brand of liquid smoke you may want to cut back on the amount. I took the advice of the submitter and used a slow cooker liner for easy clean up.

Good basic recipe for slow cooker.  I substituted Trader Joe's BBQ sauce  for the cola and ketchup and added 1 cup of TJ's Sriracha BBQ sauce.  Added 1 onion, 4 cloves garlic,  1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, and a little L & P.   Came out great, and didn't last long in our house.

I liked it - fast and simple. I did only a teaspoon of black pepper and a teaspoon of salt. I  didn't expect it to very very sweet (which is why I made it) given that the only sugar is from the ketchup and a little sweetener in the soda. I would however like a little more sweetness so next time I will use regular soda instead of diet. For those that like very sweet sauce, just add some brown sugar to the ketchup mix. I will definitely make it again.

I made this but added 1/4 brown sugar. Also, next time I make it I will only use 1/2 tablespoon of black pepper. This was good the way I made it except it had a bit too much pepper.

it was really good, though a little dry. I think the dry part was my problem though, not the recipe

My husband loved it. I thought it was pretty good, but missed the real authentic flavors of BBQ.  The recipe missed for real BBQ, but is tone expected from the simplistic nature. For ingredients around the house though, it was a good last minute make...,

It was a bit watery, peppery, and missing real sweet BBQ taste. I won't make it again.

I'm giving this one 5 stars because I see the potential. I think degy meant to write teaspoon instead of tablespoon because as written, the rub is WAAAAYYY too much and too powerful. Cut it back and I think the flavor would be perfect ! The "barbecue" sauce is really good. I'd make it again with the change I suggest.
