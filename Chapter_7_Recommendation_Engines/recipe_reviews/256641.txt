I made this sauce, but I don't have an induction oven, so I baked these for 40 min at 400, and they came out perfectly. We liked the sauce, but it could have used more flavor. Maybe some garlic powder, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, something to add just a little more zing. It was quick and easy to make though. Thanks for the recipe.

Two things I loved about this. 1. That I could do frozen wings so fast. 2. The sauce! These were some really good wings. We loved the flavor and I had everything on hand. Yummy!!

Who knew wings could be so simple? I had a package of fresh wings that I separated but still used the same cook time and they were perfect. I was a little nervous about the sauce because we're heat wimps in this house but I followed exactly and there is a perfect balance of sweet and spicy for us. Hubby liked as is but for me I will cut the amount of vinegar next time. Very good!

The wings were good and easy to make. I really liked the sauce and will definitely use that recipe again. I did have lots of splatter with the frozen wings, next time I will try fresh wings and see how it turns out. Good recipe! Thank you Jewels!

I was skeptical about putting frozen wings in my Panasonic CIO, and only cooking for 18 minutes, but it worked! The BBQ sauce has a nice balance of sweet and spicy (it's not too spicy, which is great, because I'm kind of a whimp when it comes to spicy food). Definitely quick and easy!

Move over hot wings there's a new wing in town. I never expected a simple sauce to taste so good. The crushed red pepper flakes took it over the top. I did make one slight adjustment and only used half the brown sugar. These cooked up from frozen to done in no time using the countertop induction oven. I may not pass out this recipe to my friends and just tell them it's my secret. You rocked this one Jewels.
