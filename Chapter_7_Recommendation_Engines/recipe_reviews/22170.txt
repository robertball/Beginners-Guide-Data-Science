Excellent!  Got rave reviews at a potluck as is.  The next time, I used chili sauce instead of ketchup, 2 tbsps of dry mustard, and a 1/4 cup each of brown sugar and molassas.  That was a sweeter version that the kids liked better.

I now make this with half ground beef and half ground sausage.  Tastes awesome! *********** I have made this for 2 different events/potlucks and each time i got SOOO many compliments. I think these are the best barbecue beans i've eaten. It yields a lot though so if you are making it for the family as a side dish, i would half it.

Love this recipe!  Every time I make these beans I get asked for the recipe and receive many compliments.  I love cooking things in the slow cooker because you can put the beans and the slow cooker and forget them until they are ready.  Very easy!

Only a couple small changes....1TB of salt as listed is too much sodium/used 1 tsp and as other posters noted it needs brown sugar and added 1/3 of a cup. 5 stars with less salt/add brown sugar.

I really liked this recipe.  I made it for a BBQ yesterday and everyone loved it.  The only changes I made were using 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce (with a little mustard mixed in) instead of all ketchup.  And I used 1 can of light and one can of dark kidney beans and omitted the lima beans.  I did add some brown sugar as others suggested and it was a hit! People have been asking me for the recipe all day.

Very good.  Well worth the effort to cook the onions ahead of time along with the bacon and beef.

I made this recipe and I added 1/2 cup brown sugar and one can of great northern beans (drained) and I reduced the liquid smoke to 1/2 tablespoon.  This was really good.  I actually served it as a meal with cornbread.  My husband loved it and had seconds.

Love this recipe, it is so nice with crockpot.  I only add 1 dash of lidquid smoke, I also add about a cup of molasses and put 2 fresh whole jalepenos on top while cooking, the remove before servings, gives a little kick!  ENJOY

This was not good and a waste of ingredients!  This had way too much liquid smoke flavor and desperately needed brown sugar.  Unfortunately will not make again even with altered ingredients - it was that bad!!

This was delicious. I actually used a can of each black, pinto, red, and great northern. Used just a couple strips of bacon. I put in less ketchup and used 3/4 cup of bbq sauce (since I didn't have bbq beans). It was so tasty when warmed!

I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband couldn't get over how good they are.  Even my finicky teenage son loved them! This is now my number 1 bean recipe.

Very good!  Made exactly as written... except I added 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. of ground cayenne pepper.  For the hot sauce, I used both traditional Tabasco and Frank's Red Hot.  The balance between sweet and spicy, along with the liquid smoke, made this dish have a complexity of flavors; yet none were overpowering.  They were a great side to my slow-cooked baby back ribs and corn on the cob.  'Twas a hit with the whole crew.  Will make again... for sure!

These are wonderful! I made them for our family gathering; everyone loved them! I did make some small changes though. I browned bacon & beef together, then added the onions. I changed the beans as followed: 1 can beans w/ pork, instead of 2. 1 can red kidney beans, 1 can black beans, 1 can northern beans. Divided the ketchup with 1/2 BBQ sauce. No liquid smoke. Extra garlic!  It is now a family favorite...thanks so much!

Great beans!  I used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup bbq sauce and reduced the salt to 1 tsp.  Used 1 tsp of garlic power as well.  The flavors blend together very nicely.

This is a great recipe. All my guests loved them. But because I'm concerned about sodium, I think the next time I make these, I'll go the extra step and use a mixture of dry beans. If I soak the beans overnight it should not take too long to cook. I also used soy meat crumbles and my guests couldn't tell the difference. I added some brown sugar to add some pizzazz. Thanks for the great recipe, I will definitely be using this recipe again and again!

we were having a potluck at a friends house and needed something easy but yet quick! I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try! Glad I did....it was the talk of the party! Used less salt and no ketchup, but loved the flavor with BBQ sauce and brown sugar!

They were very good. I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar just because I was in the mood for something sweet, but they were tasty even before I did that.  Great easy recipe!

I added turkey bacon and didn't use ground beef I also left out lima beans and liquid smoke flavoring because I didn't have any but chopped up some jalapenos in it and it was delicious... plus added a little kick to it!

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday.  My apologies to the TJackson, I did change a few things.  I hate giving a rating on a recipe that I've made several changes.  I didn't use ground beef as one of my guests doesn't eat beef so I grounded up a large chicken breast and a chicken thigh and used that.  I also didn't use lima beans, because I forgot my grocery list and I couldn't remember the 3rd bean, so I used butterbeans instead.  After tasting it before setting the slow cooker I had to sweeten it up a bit. I also added brown sugar as other reviewers recommended.  See all my changes in "customized recipe".  Without the changes I may have given the recipe a 3 1/2 star rating.  It is a good base recipe though.

Delicious! Used as an apetizer with corn chips. Loved by young and old alike. Has a sweet taste from the canned baked beans.  May try a less sweet variety next time.

I made this exactly as is and I wouldn't change a thing!! It was fantastic. I will say that I am diabetic. All my life I've had a very sweet tooth, but now that I can't have added sugar in anything and have to stay away from sweets, I'm used to it, and am very happy. I can easily live without sugar!! I'm enjoying all the new tastes. This recipe was perfect for me as there was no added sugar.

If the comments had pulled up when I was making this, it would have been better. 1 tbsp of salt is too much, try 1 tsp instead. Cutting the amount of liquid smoke would be good also. I agree with the other comments about adding a little brown sugar. My husband did like it, so that is a plus.

Excellent recipe! Very flavorful sauce and not too tedious to make. I usually add more herbs to the meatballs but very good if following the recipe.

First time.  Could not have been better.  Used Bushes barbecue baked beans, pinto beans,  kidney beans and northern white beans.  No ketchup, instead, spicy barbecue sauce and chili sauce.  To save time and mess, used Kirkland brand microwave bacon.
So well received, a family member asked that I bring to the next family birthday at the end of the month.  Tough crowd and they loved them.

My hubby raved about this one.  I served as the main course with a side of garlic bread. So good and so much better than beans made with a bottle of barbecue sauce.

Very nice, really enjoyed this. It seemed a bit too heavy, so I left out the beef.  Also did 1/4 cup of ketchup, and 1/4 cup of bbq sauce. (BBQ sauce was sweet, so it didn't need the addtl brown sugar. Next time, I'll put even less of the two)

Wow!  Superior baked beans with not a whole lot of work.  I followed the recipe exactly and will be making again.  Well, at least after the leftovers that I froze are gone :-) It makes a lot!

I didn't add the liquid smoke because I didn't have any on hand.  I used 1 can of dark kidney beans and 1 can of light kidney beans instead of lima beans.  I also decreased the salt and added about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar.  I think it was pretty sweet and will probably only add 1 or 2 Tablespoons next time.   My husband absolutely loved this recipe...and he is hard to please.

As is, this is a pretty good recipe. But, since i think it has room for improvement, I'll give 4 stars. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will use slightly less liquid smoke flavoring and salt, and probably substitute some honey bbq sauce for the ketchup. Might try using dry beans as well.
