We have made this recipe several times now and it's one of our favorite salmon recipes.  We've made it with both italian breadcrumbs and plain breadcrumbs.  Both ways are great.  We love the lime flavor.

I haven't made this yet and it sounds really good, but "combine sauce ingredients and serve with salmon" doesn't exactly explain how the sauce is made.

This was light and refreshing and very simple.  I will make this sauce again.
