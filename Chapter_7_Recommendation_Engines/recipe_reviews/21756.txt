Very delicious cake and so easy to make. I did cut down the chocolate chips and walnuts to 1/2 cup each and that covered the cake nicely. To save time a cake mix can be used with the same great results. Thank you Sharon for the posting.

I used to make this cake when my kids were little over 30 years ago and lost the recipe. It is wonderful! I added an additional 8 ounce can of fruit cocktail drained in addition to the 15 ounce tropical fruit cocktail. I served it to my dinner guests and they loved it....they were surprised and delighted with the chocolate chips.

If you like fruit and chocolate combined it's a very good recipe. It is very tasty. I've had alot of mixed reviews. Some people just don't like the taste. But I did so it got 5 stars. The first time I made it I could find the sifter so I improvised but it turned out very dry. I thought maybe it was also because it just didn't get quite enough liquid. So the next time I made it I used a sifter and added an extra egg to it. Turned out great. Both times I made it I did add extra cinnamon also.

I was looking for a fruit cake recipe and this came up in the list. I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out fine but I find it a little strange. It tastes (and looks) like a big chocolate chip cookie with fruit cocktail mixed in. It doesn't taste bad per se but I don't think the fruit makes it more appealing or delicious. I think it might be interesting to try making it with white sugar instead and maybe add milk instead of the fruit cocktail syrup. This way it would be more of a yellow cake with fruit mixed in.

I have a bed and breakfast and had guest who was lactose intolerant. I made this cake and wasn't sorry. Hubby thought it tasted a bit like carrot cake and didn't like it but the guests devoured it and I took the leftovers to work. They all liked it as well and one gal asked for the recipe! I cut the recipe in half so I wouldn't have a lot of leftovers to tempt me and baked in a 8x8 (or thereabouts) pan. It baked in about 20 minutes in my GE Advantium convection oven. I have another lactose intolerant guest tonight and will make it again tonight!

I have never made fruit cake before and this turned out great. I changed the can of fruit and used the candied fruit you buy in the store and added the juice from the fruit cocktail and let it sit over night. Awesome recipe will use again!!

Made this recipe exactly as written except for leaving out the walnuts because I hate them. So delicious we topped it with whipped cream. All 7 of us gobbled it up! Great recipe.
