This pie is delicious!  I made it with an oreo crust and it tasted great!  My only advice is to make sure to let the chocolate mixture cool like the recipe calls for.  I didn't let it cool enough and it melted the cream and it took over 24 hours for the pie to set.

Absolutely delicious!  I even used some cool whip instead of whipping cream. It really is better if you chill it overnight though.  It took a long time to set up.

Delicious! And very easy. I made mine with regular chocolate bars without the almonds out of personal preference. It is rich yet not heavy. Great with a mound of freshly whipped cream on top and a few chocolate curls. Good frozen too.

This is the best pie I've ever had! We call it Smores pie. I've made it at least 10 times since I found the recipe and everyone loves it! (with and without the almonds) When I make it with almonds, I chop them up into little pieces.  Thanks for the sweeeet recipe!

Absolutely YUMMY!!! I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! I love Hershey's Symphony milk chocolate so that is what I used.  I put in 1 huge 6.8ou bar and another almost half of another one. I used good ol' cool whip instead of the cream and it was just right!  I also added small pieces of Heath bar it was great!!!  A+++++ and the prep time A+ too way fast and easy!

Wonderful pie-I always put a layer of cool whip on top of the chocolate filling, then sprinkle chocolate curls over it.
I make this sometimes with plain chocolate bars instead of the almond. Either way its delicious.

I make this with a crushed pecan crust instead, you just put pecans in the food processer then mix with melted butter and press into the pie pan, bake it for 10 minutes at 350. I also use less candy bars and more cream so it doesn't come out to rich.

This wasn't too time-consuming to make, considering it is a pie after all, but the results are very yummy. I didn't feel it had that "wow" factor, though. Perhaps some topping like others have suggested, but I almost think this is on the verge of being too rich and would be afraid to add anything else to it. Overall, this is tasty and not too expensive. I will probably make it again but not when I'm aiming to impress.

I have literally made hundreds of recipes from this site and this is by far my favorite. This pie is OUTSTANDING!!! 
I followed the recipe to a "T" using chocolate bars w/o the almonds and made the graham cracker crust from scratch (so easy and worth it)--to die for! Please make this and enjoy it as much as we did!!!

My hubby does not like chocolate so I was quite surprised when he ate 2 of the 12 graham crust tarts that this recipe made.  I actually made them for our Priest.  He only got 6 of them though.  He said with a little whipped cream on top he was in heaven.  A friend had 2 of them and raved.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I used 8 oz. cool whip instead of whipping cream and 12 individual graham cracker tarts.  They were very light and were just the right serving size.

Wonderful! I made it "mocha" by dissolving a tablespoon of instant coffee in 1 1/2 tsp water. I added it into the melting chocolate/marshmallow  mixture. It wasn't overwhelming, just a nice coffee flavor.

Very easy and delicious, I used candy bars with toasted rice in them and a handful of chocolate chips and the kids were pushing and shoving to get the last piece. the adults loved it to.

I made this because I was looking for an easy pie to make. It was extremely easy. It was also extremely sweet! Maybe some whipped cream on top would cut the sweetness some.

I've made this with regular chocolate bars and cool whip and it's good but SWEET! Our favorite is to substitute 1/2 dark chocolate and use heavy whipping cream. Rich and decadent!

Amazing! perfect for chocolate lovers. I used 5 hershey bars and put a handfull of almonds in the food processer. The chocolate flavor was great, I'm glad I didn't add the last chocolate bar. I also made my own graham cracker crust using the recipe from this site but cut down the sugar to 1 tbls

Super easy and loved by all.  This is not the prettiest pie, so I snazzed it up with some whipped cream flowers, chocolate shavings and some pieces of chocolate bar on top.

I thought this turned out very good. However, to make it turn out best, you must wait for the choclate marshmallow mixture to COMPLETELY cool! I got it almost to room temperature, but it still melted the whipped cream down; even still, the pie set well after being refrigerated all night, and it was soo good!

This recipe was quick and easy to make, but only rated a 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.  A bit too sweet, and too fluffy.  Perhaps it is personal preferences, but recipes with pudding mix or cream cheese or a cooked custard base seem to have a better (more substantial) texture and something to counteract the sweetness.  (Logically, I should have known this recipe would be very sweet:  candy, marshmellows, and whipping cream...).

I was in the mood to make a dessert for dinner tonight, so I went to the pantry to see what was calling out to me.  I had a graham cracker crust that had been in there awhile, and really needed to be used up.  So, I did an ingredient search for graham cracker crust . . . I was also looking for a "faceless" recipe (one without a photo).  This one fit the bill!  I didn't exactly have all of the ingredients that it called for, so I had to improvise!  The chocolate bars is what I was missing, but I did have a handful of Hershey's hugs (left over from making pretzel smoochies), some M&Ms and a bowl of chocolate that was left over from my Christmas baking.  I weighed out the chocolate to come out the same as if I had the candy bars, and it turned out WONDERFUL!  The red & pink M&Ms initially turned the chocolate a funky color, but as soon as they melted, it was fine.  I topped it with a few slivered almonds and some chocolate shavings.  Thanks for this quick and easy pie recipe!  One I'll be making again for sure.

made this using a combo of dove milk chocolate squares and semi-sweet choc chips (to cut back on the sweetness others talked about). omitted the nuts since my family doesn't care for them in pies. topped it with cool whip and it was a HUGE hit!  the graham cracker crust gave it a nice texture balance. i'll definitely be making this again!

I made this because I didn't want to have to bake and needed something easy. I used several Hershey's dark chocolate bars and the rest milk choc plain. I also didn't add the whipping cream, which made the pie somewhat thicker and richer, but still delicious. I also used a regular freezer crust instead of graham cracker. Overall, it turned out great and was very easy to put together. My husband loved it!

Easy and everyone loved it!  I'm going to try microwaving to melt ingredients (save my pan) and see how that version turns out.  :-)

So yummy.  Kind of melts in your mouth.  Very simple and easy.  My husband wants me to try it next with a Oreo crust, but I like the graham cracker crust a lot!

I liked this very much because it was so simple.  I would have liked more chocolate flavor, though!!  I made this according to the directions, but now I melt marshmallows and chocolate in the microwave.  The only problem is the almonds from the chocolate bars all sank to the bottom of the pie.

I use 1 1/2 cups crushed vanilla wafers, 1/2 cup melted butter, and 1/2 cup of coconut for the crust and it is wonderful! People love this recipe this way. Remember, if you used Cool Whip, you are adding sugar to the recipe. If you used whipping cream, you probably don't add any sugar to it, and maybe that's why it might have seemed sweet to those who used Cool Whip instead.  Just a guess.

What a cinch! I made this pie for the "kids" table at Thanksgiving and an incredible thing happened...complete silence. When we looked over they were scraping their plates and asking for more. Of course, the grownups said it was all gone and we proceeded into the kitchen with our forks to try it.  Thank God I made to. The only negative to this pie is if you make it for more than 2 people, there are no leftovers :(

I made this last night and we just ate a piece!  Very easy to make and tasted great!  For some reason I had alot of filling, so I think next time I will buy a bigger crust.  Also, the next time I make this, my husband wants me to try it without almonds.

yummy!  I made this pie and chilled it for 3 hours.  It was not quite set - but I couldn't wait.  Very Very good.  I am sure it will be better after chilling overnight or until firm.
