So this is my recipe and I realized after reading the last review I forgot to add something on the original.  This is optional but I do like to add a little lemon juice and cilantro before serving to add more zing.  Hope you enjoy

I was on here looking for somehting to round out the Middle Eastern picnic I'm preparing for this evening.This recipe showed up on the front page since it's new, so I thought I'd try it out. I'm glad I did. I made a lot of substitutions due to personal preference: A small amount (1/2 t.?) of powdered chipolte chilies in place of the whole canned ones, Saracha hot chili sauce in place of the hot sauce and nonfat plain yogurt for half the oil.I also added some lemon juice to brighten it up a bit. The end result was perfect. This is a tasty recipe that would also work well as a spread. Thanks!

So this was really different ... I wouldn't call it guacamole, but it really was good. It had so much flavor! I only used 1 tsp of olive oil, added 2 TB lowfat plain yogurt, added 2 TB lemon juice instead of the water, and 2 TB leftover salsa. Cilantro would definitely go well with this recipe. I omitted the salt and pepper ... didn't seem to need it. Overall, a great alternative to guacamole ... especially since avocados are so pricey and edamame are so inexpensive! Thanks for the recipe!

I love the idea of making a dip from edamame, but this flavor combo didn't work for me. The cumin and garlic were way too strong and completely obscured the flavor of the edamame. Maybe that's the point, but I love edamame and would like to be able to taste it. I think this would work much better with Asian flavors: ponzu or soy sauce, sesame oil, wasabi, and pickled ginger, served with home-baked pita chips sprinkled with Chinese 5-spice, or even used as a filling for nori rolls. Thanks for the inspiration, though.

I've made this a few times now as a healthier alternate to guacamole.  This is VERY good and entire family loved it.  But each time - I've had a difficult time getting the edamame pureed to a consistency and had to monkey around a bit w/it and the liquids given here.  (otherwise would rate a 5) Great flavor though - VERY good and healthy!

Mine was not very green, which I attribute to the hot pepper sauce I used. However, this impressed me greatly! We truly enjoyed having this dip with some chips during a relaxing stay at the family cabin.

this was really different but great!  we loved it and honestly it didn't taste the same, but was very similar to a good guacamole.  we will definitely make this again.  next time i will probably use some chipotle powder though instead of buying a whole can of peppers for just one pepper.

I didn't care for this one at all, although I liked the idea of using edamame for a dip. But no one cared for the flavor. I'll have to keep looking.

Yum! I should have known to use less chipotle pepper, but I threw a whole one in anyway so this was a bit spicy for my wimpy taste buds. However, that was easily remedied by serving it with plain yogurt to cut the heat. I used lime juice instead of water and added cilantro. I wouldn't say it tastes at all like guacamole, but it is really good. Thanks :)

Great, healthy, protein-packed snack! I'm a big wimp and can't handle much spicy stuff, so I replaced the chipotle pepper with a roasted red pepper. I still added some hot sauce and it needed more olive oil, but that could've been due to the red pepper. 
It's very good, but I think I might add some sauteed onion, maybe some chopped tomato to make it more like guacamole. Great recipe- so glad I found it. Thanks!

For me, this recipe is more hummus than guac. I definitely recommend using 1/4 cup yogurt instead of the olive oil.  And as a personal preference, I cooked & quick cooled my edamame.  Got rave reviews at work.  Will definitely use this recipe often.

yummy and smokey. My guests who prefer super greasy food weren't partial to this dish, but those of us with more refined tastebuds were LOVING this dip

This is good! It has a different taste, in a good way. It is spicy. I added more water than it called for. I used it as a dip for chips and taquitos. I put it in a taco, Tasty! Next time I'm going to try it on a hamburger!

After a few substitutions: 3T greek yogurt, 1/8t chili powder (because I didn't have a pepper), and 2T salsa it was wonderful! I'm not a big guac fan so I couldn't really tell a difference at all. I also did not use S&P because I didn't feel it was necessary after tasting. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked that this recipe had some "heat" but the garlic was overwhelming.  I added cilantro and lemon juice as the submitter suggested and it does help make this recipe work.  I also liked that the dip is emulsified with water instead of oil.  I will make this again but will cut the garlic in half.  Thank you HFL for sharing.

I usually follow recipes to the "t" but was in a hurry and did not have chipolte in adobo, so substituted a fresh jalepeno (minus seeds) instead.

This dip was amazing!  I was told to bring it to every get together from now on. It was gone in minutes.

Strange.  It was just ok.  I was excited for East to meet West and this amazing flavor fusion to take place in my mouth.  The flavors just clashed though.  I ate the whole thing, it was good enough, but I don't think I would make it for a party or anything.

This came out really good! I added 2 tsps of siriracha sauce instead of hot pepper sauce since I preferred it spicier, 2 roasted red peppers, a little bit of yellow onion and about an extra half a tbsp of olive oil and the consistency was softer.

I made this pretty much following the recipe (I used dried chipotle instead of canned), and it came out dry and gritty. I added lime juice, salsa, and cream, and then blended it in the food processor for a long time. In the end it came out okay.

I liked it but the directions about spiciness was kind of vague. I did not add any hot sauce and then added twice the edamame and it was still too spicy for a lot of people.

Not great as written, kinda bland, but spice it up the same way you would with guacamole.  The recipe writer later added lemon juice and cilantro.  I would also add chopped onion and tomato if I make this again.

I used simple celery sticks as the "delivery system" lol. Flat out outstanding, although I wouldn't exactly say it tastes like guacamole. I suppose they are both green and smooth lol.  The chipotle in adobo is quite forward and not a flavor I think of in guacamole.  I added lemon juice as suggested by the recipe submitter in the reviews and I believe that brightness is important to the dish.  What else can I say, this is healthy and delicious. Win-Win.

Fkr those of yoh who resisted buying chipotle chiles, puree the entire can, add some to your recipe, and freeze the rest in an ice cube tray or just little lumps and store

Thanks for the recipe! It was my first one. I cooked the edamame a little, used a jalapeno instead of chipotle (it's the same pepper-i think). Added lots of Greek yogurt instead of oil. It was very smooth and wonderful! Also added  little margarum. Yum!

I made this to share at a basket class I was taking and everyone really liked it.  I made it just as written and added the lemon juice and cilantro as well.  Mine started turning a little more red during the processing so I stopped and mixed it all together so I'd have more gree small chunkier parts.  It definitely has a kick!  I took a small container of plain yogurt for anyone who wanted to tone theirs down, but no one used it.  I liked that it was hot, but not so hot that it didn't allow you to enjoy the flavors.  It gave a pleasant warm feeling all over your mouth.  Thanks for a great recipe!
