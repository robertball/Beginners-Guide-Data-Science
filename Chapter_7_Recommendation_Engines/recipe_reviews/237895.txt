When I first looked at this recipe, I thought it looked like  nice usual recipe... nothing that would be super, but I was wrong. I forgot how much moistened  crumbs improve meatball texture...so used to using  dried,  This and the addition of Italian sausage ( mine was chicken) made it very hard for me not to eat the entire recipe myself.  I just bought some more ground turkey tonight and one package will be used to make these again

We don't eat cheese, or anything made with cow's milk, so I substituted cashew milk to soak the bread and the juice of one lemon to replace the parm cheese.  They were delicious!!!!!!  Thank you.

Definitely will make this again. I made just a couple changes. I used 1 1/4 lb of ground turkey and added crushed fennel seed and onion powder.  I also doubled the garlic and used 3/4 c dry bread crumbs soaked in milk.

We have been trying different meals. Trying to use ground turkey has been a fail so far. These are delicious!! I also added 3 TBS of Parmesan because we had a full pound of ground turkey and no sausage. I also pan seared them in a bit of oil first then put them in the oven. They are very good plain but we added them to a packet gravy  serving over egg noodles. YUMMM

Holy moly! these are amazing! the bread absolutely makes these meatballs, where otherwise would be bland and dry. I have started using bread in all meatballs and meatloaves now. so darn good!

Delicious, when they were done baking I put them under the broiler on HI for a few minutes to make them a bit crispier! I definitely will make these again!

A great basic recipe!  I have made it twice in 2 weeks.  The first time I followed the recipe but I doubled it and used basil instead of parsley because I had a fresh bunch. I had hoped to be able to freeze some but they were all gone in 2 days.  
Today I made them again but used 1 # of turkey and 1#Italian sausage, lots of cheese but left out the greens due to not having any on hand. (I think spinach might work in these too.)  Hopefully some of this batch will make it to the freezer.
Oh, and the first time I lined my pan with parchment paper instead of foil and that worked fine.  This time I also used Parchment but also put the meatballs on a rack in the pan with great results.

Made these and they are so yummy.  Some changes I made are:
Used regular hot Italian sausage because that's what I had,  dried parsley, Texas toast for the bread and a few good shakes of cayenne pepper.  After roasting per recipe, I tasted one (YUMMY) and tossed them in a pan with some jarred spaghetti sauce.  It's all cooking right now filling the house with yummy smells.  Today is national pasta day, so we will be having this for dinner tonight.  Will definitely make these again, doubling the recipe so I'll have left overs.
