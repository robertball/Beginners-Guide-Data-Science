I really LOVED this. I confess I tweaked it quite a bit (but I never would have made this without your inspiration, ktkincaid.) I used six onions and cooked them till well carmelized then added 2 shallots, a leek and some garlic and cooked till softened. I deglazed with 1/2 cup of white wine and added 2 cups chicken broth and simmered for twenty minutes, then added the cream and brought it just to heat. I garnished with large homemade sourdough croutons, shredded gruyere, cracked black pepper and whole fresh chive blossoms.

This was really good..but maybe just heavy on the cream a little...it overpowered the soup.  I would only do half to 3/4 the cream stated here.  Cant wait to try again!
