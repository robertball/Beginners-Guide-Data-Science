I only give this recipe 4 stars because I changed so many things about it.  It did sound a bit bland and so many other reviewers had said it was.  What I ended up with was DELICIOUS!  So here's what I did:  1.) I doubled the meat portion and tripled the mushroom sauce. 2.) In the sauce I also included  about 3/4 cup finely chopped onion and 3 tsp. garlic as well as salt to taste. 3.) In the meat I also included 1/2 cup cheese and garlic croutons, crushed.  3 tsp garlic, Italian seasoning, 2 whole eggs (instead of just the egg yolk), 1/2 cup finely chopped onion, and about 3/4 cup chopped fresh mushrooms.  4.) Because I doubled the meat I needed 2 packages of crescents.  Instead of the bigger loaves, I made 16 individual ones. They baked for about 25-27 minutes and came out perfectly!  Still moist inside and not burnt on the outside.  A tip for the crescents - brush with an egg wash and lay them seam side down on the baking sheet.  I served this with cheesy garlic mashed red potatoes, green beans, and carrots.  It was amazing.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

When I first spotted this recipe it caught my eye because it looked different.  I was a little dissapointed in the ingredients, they looked bland to me, so I made some changes and I'm glad I did, it turned out beautifully.  Here is what I did (in addition to what the recipe called for); I mixed to the meat 2/3 a packet of dry onion soup mix along with chuncks of mozzarela cheeze and finely diced mushrooms and about 1/2 tsp of my favorite spice blend.  I also put a pinch or two of the spice blend in the mushroom sauce.  The onion soup mix added just enough flavor to make this dish stand out.  Enjoy!

i just made this today for supper. like most recipes this was more of a starting point me.lol. i am loving this recipe. i tweaked it quite a bit though. i sauted celery,onion, mushrooms and garlic together and added it to the meat instead of the gravy. i also added crumbled bacon, cheddar and parmesan cheese, a handful of breadcrumbs, and about 3 tblsps of dry onion soup mix. then wrapped it like it called and used a egg wash on it. also with the gray i added a tblsp of the dry onion soup mix and a packet of brown gravy mix. we absolutely loved this. the versatility of this recipe is endless. i cant wait to make it again!

I replaced the half and half with cream of mushroom soup it made for a very good gravy to be served with this recipe.  All and all this was a very excellent dish and have made it several times with no left overs after my family got to it.

These turned out to be better than I thought they would be.  I didn't find them to be bland at all; in fact I thought both the meat and the sauce were very flavorful.  I had more mushrooms in the sauce than it calls for because I didn't know how many mushrooms would equal 1/2 cup.  I probably had close to a cup.  The meat wasn't dry at all, and in fact was quite moist.  The only thing I think I would do differently if I made these again would be to use refrigerated pie crusts instead of the crescent rolls.  The rolls were a little soft and I think the pie crust would be more like the crust on authentic Beef Wellington.

This dish was a hit with my family.  It is hard to find a good recipe for ground meat that is different.  The only thing that I would change is making individual wellingtons with for each person.  (you need more creasent rolls).  But everyone loved the dish when I prepared it the way is written.

I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I had to improvise this to a take on an Italian twist. So I really used the recipe more for quantity guidelines.

I added Italian seasoning to the beef and a bit of bread crumbs - mainly cause I had some homemade leftover ones and I wanted to use them up.

I also added some parm cheese and mixed Italian cheese to the mixture as well as a few tablespoons of tomato paste.

After I covered them in the pastry dough I sprinkled the tops w/ parm cheese again and sprinkled a few italian herbs and a pinch of salt.

Instead of the sauce I used Marinara sauce. 

The end result I wasn't too sure of, but my husband ate two of these and I had planned on us both taking left overs to work, but he couldn't get enough of it. He LOVED it.

I will deffinately try this recipe again as written out, but its a great inspiration recipie. 

I would love to take this Mexican or even Jamacian jerk style, or even Sloppy Joe'ish! Or even just with my faveorite meat loaf, the idea of the indivudual pastry wrap would dress up just about anything!

Just tell your family you made Sloppy Joe Wellington, Meat Loaf Wellington, etc.

Because we don't eat mushrooms (allergy), I had to change this up a little bit.  I sweated finely chopped onions, green chili and garlic, and then added a can of beef gravy.  I thought it was a nice, different way to use some ground beef, and the flavor was really good, but my husband said it was just meatloaf in a biscuit.  Ah, well, the finer things are often lost on him...

I made a few alterations such as using more mushrooms as well as Campbell's Golden Mushroom Soup with a can of milk.  The dinner got rave reviews from my husband who hails from London. THANKS!

Wondering what to do differently with that pound of thawed groud beef? YOU FOUND IT. AND IT CAN BE AS GOOD AS YOU WANT IT. I've got some eaters that just like bland stuff and they wonder "oh gosh, what is she trying next."  So, after reading other reviews I did two things differently:  browned the ground beef with some salt and pepper so my "boring-preferred" eaters saw ground beef. THIS WAY I COULD DRAIN THE MEAT, too and not end up with a soggy mush on the cookie sheet. Separetly sauted diced up mushrooms, onion, celery and garlic; then added a can of cream of mushroom soup with some 2% milk (no cream on hand).  Used a whole wisked egg and some of "my" sauce to help form the loaves for each.  Baked until the crust was golden.  Used sauce on the side. Try this, you may really like it.  Thanks Julie!

I figured the refrigerated crescent roll dough would be a bad idea, and I was right. This recipe would be better if you use puff pastry dough.

This recipe is super easy. I actually used ground turkey and reduced fat crescent rolls. I took the advice of previous reviews and used onion soup mix, grated cheese, bread crumbs, and Worcestershire sauce. I also doubled the recipe. In the sauce I doubled and used chicken broth in conjunction with the half n half to give it more flavor. My family loved it! Thanks for sharing this recipe, I've been wanting to make a wellington but didn't want to use liver.

Thanks for the idea. I seasoned up the beef with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and added 1/4 of a can of cream of mushroom to the mix then used the rest for the gravy thined out with water. Maybe next time I will add some cheddar cheese to the mix.

Great use of ground beef.  I doubled the recipe and made 8 individual wellingtons.  I added worchestershire and garlic to the meat mixture and some chopped onions to the musrhoom gravy.  I think milk would have been adequate for the gravy rather than half and half - which would greatly reduce the calories in it. 

I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing! I loved the suggstions by LonSkyMOM. But I did change one thing, I used the uncut cresent rolls this way the cresent dough stayed together much better and I could cut it to any size I wanted.

This was really good and hubby loved it. I did follow other's advice and use a can of cream of mushroom soup (actually the garlic cream of mushroom soup)because I didn't have half and half in the fridge. This is something I will be making again soon :)

We really liked these, but, as previously stated they are a bit bland as is.  I added lots of garlic and plan on experimenting more the next time I make them.  I also will triple the sauce recipe next time since it really made this dish.

This was surprisingly good!! I wasn't too sure how it would turn out, but it was good, not great but good enough to switch it up with something different for dinner! I used the recipe as a starting point & did my own thing as I went along. The gravy needs to be doubled! I didn't & we hardly had enough. Also add onions & garlic to it as well.
For the meat, it seemed kind of bland to me so I added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce, a few shakes of old bay seasoning, bread crumbs, cheddar & mozzarella cheese, used the whole egg not just the yolk & left out onions since I had put some in the gravy. Then I took my crescent rolls & made 4 individual loafs, it was good!!

I added a half a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix to the ground beef.  Yum!  Delicious. My husband loved, loved, loved these!  Not the healthiest, however.

These were good.  I would like to have a little more flavor and will have to tweak the recipe next time I make them.  I also wanted double the sauce, as it ran out so quickly and we didn't have enough.  Finally I made smaller loaves and still they weren't all the way done in the middle.  The recipe is a great place to start though!

VERY GOOD!! I increased the serving size to 4 (since the orignal recipie was for 2) and still doubled the sauce from there. Added Bread Crumbs, chopped celery and garlic powder. This is definatly a keeper!

I should have taken the reviews to heart about it being bland.  It  was okay but the meat had little flavor. Next time I will add some onion soup mix and garlic and then see what else it needs.  I made individual Wellingtons using two crescent rolls per person and doubled the sauce.  I brushed the tops with egg white before I put them in to bake and they turned out really pretty.  All in all , it was pretty good.

This was okay but it was too dry for my families liking.  I am not sure if I would make it again or not.

These look absolutely beautiful but as other reviews said they were a little bland.  I think they are an AWESOME idea next time I make them (and I will make them again) I will add a couple more spices to give them an extra boost.  I loved the crescent rolls around it!!

Because of what I had in my kitchen I used the suggestion of another to use Cream of Mushroom Soup instead of 1/2 and 1/2.  I also used a can of mushrooms instead of fresh!  Turned out wonderful and there were no left-overs!  The entire family loved it!

Success!  Can't believe how easy this was.  The result looked fantastic and prefessional.  Everyone loved it!  I followed other's advice... added mozzarella cheese to the meat mixture and did the egg wash on the  dough so it came out really nice and golden.  I had left over meat...so I fried them like meat balls.

This recipe has good bones but to get it good I had to do quite a bit of tweaking. You don't really need that much ground beef. I added more mushrooms and doubled the onion. The sauce needed a lot of help I added various seasonings as well as Worcestershire. It turns out better when you make individual rolls (I prepared this both ways at once) To do the individual rolls you need more of them.

great go to recipe for ground beef. i did as one of the other reviews suggested, and added Golden Mushroom soup for my sauce, and milk in place of cream..it was great! I do reccomend covering the loaves with foil after they are browned. And 1 lb of beef was too much for one container of cresent rolls, just noted it the excess meat. Also it needs longer than 28 minutes, it took about 45 until the meat was cooked through. Overall, a very elegant alternative to you average generic type ground beef dish.

This dish was so delicious, we all loved it! It made good leftovers too. The sauce was a little sparce to add to the top(I will increase the amount next time) but other than that it was perfect. Easy, not many ingrediants, and so tasty!

This recipe rocks!
Def. going into our folder of household favorites. :)

I did take into account other reviews &:
1. Used cream of mushroom soup instead of  single cream.
2. Added 2tsp italian herbs into the mince mix.
3. Copied Gordon Ramsey -- lightly scored & egg washed the crust w/ my left over whites (they were sitting there anyway)-- for that shiny pretty look.

So, if you are in the mood for good food, and don't have a mega cut of meat lying around....then grab some mince & pre-rolled pastry dough & get cooking. 
Totally high class grub for low-cost. :D

I made double the sauce and it was surprisingly good.  The ground beef definitely needs something.  It was really bland.  Serviced this with some green beans with almonds.

I wasn't crazy about this but only because I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms. However my boyfriend really liked it - so that is why I went ahead and gave it four stars. Really easy to make too

Tried this for dinner tonight. Turned out okay, but had to do some modifications. The biggest issue I had was the sauce recipe as written was too thick for my taste. Had to thin it out when reheating. The meat tasted a bit bland and the onions still tasted kind of raw, but would definitely try this again with some adjustments. Possibly will cook more mushrooms and onions to add to the meat mixture before baking. I did an egg wash on the top of the Wellingtons and really liked the way they turned out. Also thought the meat cooked well in the pastry, so was very pleased about that.

This was a huge hit at dinner last night.  I made a few adjustments for an easier preparation and more flavor.  I substituted a packet of bechamel sauce I found at the grocery store for the sauce and I added a small can of mushrooms to the meat mixture. I made four small wellingtons and our family of three fought over the fourth one. Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe to be very good overall.  A cheeper alternative to the steak.  The sauce is they only thing I would make changes to next time. It began to solitify and became more of a paste, something to watch out for.

I gave this recipe only 4 stars because I added quite a bit of other ingredients to it.  But, I thought it was a fantastic meal for a twist on "meatloaf".  Many of the changes I gleaned from other reviewers & the result of all the combined suggestions were fantastic!  
Here's what I added (& I tripled the recipe, yielding 8 loaves)...to the Mushroom sauce:
1/4 c. sliced, gr onions
3 gloves garlic, minced
1/2 t. salt
1 1/2 T chpd, dried chives
1/2 t. lemon juice
I used 1 1/2 c. chpd mushrooms, 1 1/2 T. flour, 1/4 t. Cayenne pepper, 1 1/2 c. cream, 1 T. parsley flakes
Make sure you saute the gr onions 1st, then add the mushrooms & cook another 10 mins, adding the minced garlic for another 5 mins, without browning.
(Add the chives & lemon juice along w/ the parsley flakes after the sauce has thickened.)
...to the loaves:
1/2 c. parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 c. crushed garlic-flavored croutons
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 T. italian seasoning
1/4 t. pepper
2 T. tomato paste
I omitted the chpd onion & used 1/2 t. onion powder
I used 1 1/2 lbs grd beef, 2 eggs, 1/2 t. salt, 2 pkgs (grands) 8-ct crscent rolls
I also brushed a beaten egg over the dough & sprinked w/ additional parmesan cheese before baking. 
My loaves were pretty large & it took nearly 40-50 mins to cook fully, so I laid foil over them after about 30 mins to keep them from getting too brown while the meat finished cooking inside.
My prep time increased too, so it took about 1 1/2 hrs total.

Just made this for dinner.  I thought it was great!! I made my own gravy using beef bullion butter flour and milk, then mixed in the sauteed mushrooms and a can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic.  I added a few more seasonings to the ground beef and I made 2 mini ones for my kids (who LOVED them).  This was pretty easy and I will most likely make it a regular dinner :) Thanks

I couldn't resist using ground turkey instead of beef to make this a little healthier (using a meat thermometer to make sure it cooked through).  I sauteed onions & garlic instead of mushrooms & added cream of celery soup instead of the butter/flour/cream because my husband hates mushrooms - adding some chicken broth to thin it out to a gravy. I think I added a little too much soup to the meat mixture, it didn't really form into a loaf, but then that could have been b/c of the turkey as well.  My husband gave this two thumbs up, though I think he would have liked it even more with beef.  Next time I will do an egg wash on the crescents before baking in order to get a better crust.  The bottom of the crescents were a little gummy, not sure how to fix that though...

Tasty!!!! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and made some changes. I added some fresh chopped mushroom, garlic and some garlic salt to the meat. I used a pound of ground beef and tripled the sauce which is wonderful. I added one clove of garlic to the sauce also. I indivdually wrapped three loaves with 10 oz can of buttery flaky crescent rolls.  They were delicious!! I will def make again.

I thought this looked interesting so I figured I'd try it. It was ... interesting. I followed the recipe exactly which I like to do the first time I make something, but I really did think it tasted like meatloaf in a crescent roll. Which tasted good but I didn't think it was Great and I don't think its worth all the trouble when you could just make meatloaf. The sauce to me tasted like cream of mushroom, so I don't understand why you couldn't just use that if you were going to make it again.

This was a great meal. I did add some seasoning salt and garlic powder  and I slightly browned the loafs prior to putting them in the crescent rolls. I followed the recipe for the sauce it did come out thicker so I added about 1/4 cup more half and half when adding the parsley my whole family liked it which is rare. There was extra meat which I browned and made great open face sandwiches for lunch the next day. I will be adding this to regular rotation of meals.

I rarely rate recipes poorly, but everyone in my family threw their dinners away and heated up leftovers when I made this.  I followed the recipe exactly except used fresh parsley instead of dried.  After cooking for 25 minutes I cut the rolls in half to serve.  The ground beef was bright pink in the middle.  I couldn't put them back into the oven or the crescent rolls would have burned.  I had to microwave each roll for approximately 5 minutes to cook the meat.  I couldn't believe I spent this prep time to end up microwaving my dinner.  The flavor was terrible.  I can't figure out what I could have done wrong.  I have been cooking for 10+ years and know what I'm doing.

DH liked it, I found it bland.  I like the idea but the taste was so boring that it just didn't work for me.  I added onion soup mix to the ground beef and used golden mushroom soup for the sauce with an addition of Worcestershire sauce, but it just didn't work.

If you love mushrooms, you'll flip for the creamy mushroom sauce that accompanies this scrumptious dish!  The only thing I did differently is added a few more seasonings-garlic powder, worchestershire sauce, a little extra salt and pepper, etc.  This is definitely an "I'll-be-making-this-again" recipe.  I have made it a few times and the recipe can easily be doubled for company.

My family loved this! Instead of the mushroom-soupy instructions, we used cream of celery soup. Other than that, followed recipe exactly but added some mozzarella cheese.

This was not very good. By the time the meat was cooked the crescent roll was really dark. The grease from the beef leaked out and burned the bottom of the bread. And then after adding some garlic powder and onion powder to the beef mixture it was still bland. We had to put ketchup on it to make it have some flavor.

I have to agree with other posts that it needed more flavor.I also was needing to DOUBLE the recipe so the adjustments are for 1# of meat. I added 2 cloves minced garlic, and grated onion to the gravy mixture (1/2 whit onion), also salt and pepper to taste. To the meat I added about 2 tsp worchestire sauce and Paula Deen's house seasoning (salt, peper, and garlic powder).  They cooked up pefectly in the oven.  I also did an egg wash as suggested by another post.  OH!  If you have extra gravy save it!  It was perfect over eggs the next morning!

I have made this twice now for 2 and it is very good, well worth the effort. The first time all I had was refrigerated biscuits not cresent rolls and after rolling them out they made perfect round pastries. I was hesitant to use raw meat because I didn't want the biscuits to burn while the meat cooked so I browned it first. This allowed me to cook them just long enough for the biscuits to cook and left them a wonderful golden color, crispy on the outside and hot, moist and flavorful on the inside. This does take some effort but I recommend using round biscuits instead of cresent rolls. I cut out the onion because I am not a fan and I added cooked rice and celery. Smothered them in a mushroon country gravy and they were really good. will definitely make again. Thanks!

I used this recipe for the 1st time tonight, and will absolutely use it again.   I agree with a previous comment the meat could use a LITTLE more seasoning, but I wouldn't call it bland.  Also, I doubled the recipe and the results showed the smaller loafs turned out the best.  Overall, very easy, and inexpensive.  Thanks!

My husband said this was the best dish I've ever prepared!  I adjusted the recipe down to 2 servings (2 Wellingtons) & it was plenty for 2.

At 350 degrees in my oven, 24-28 minutes was not long enough for the beef to be thoroughly cooked.  Without a meat thermonetor, I needed to wiggle a small knife into the top to check.  Around 30 minutes, the beef was no longer pink & the crescent rolls were perfect!

Just lovely!

way overratted. my husband called this dish a glorified meatball. As is, it's pretty bland, and without much flavor, and I added extra spices n stuff. this was so not worth the effort. I'll have to really change the base of this recipe, adding a lot more for flavor, then it'd be okay. I liked how it was wrapped in the cresent roll...but that's about it.

I loved this recipe.  It was really easy and simple and came out great.  The only differences were that I was out of onions, so I put lots of freshly pressed garlic in the meat for some flavor--probably could have used a little more salt too--and I added garlic salt to the sauce.  We LOVED the sauce and it was hard not to keep going back to the pan for another taste before the wellingtons were done.  I read the reviews and I have to say, mine did not come out soggy on the bottom at all.  I did use a baking stone, so I think that probably helped.  So if you have one, I highly recommend using it to cook them on.  Can't wait to make this again!

I was quite disappointed with this recipe, especially given the reviews it received.  The beef mixture had very little flavor and the grease from the beef just soaked into the pastry leaving it soggy in places(and I used extra lean ground beef).  Perhaps it would be better if the beef was browned 1st with some spices.

This was GREAT! I made individual portions with Grands biscuits and cream of mushroom soup because that was what was on hand. I also added a bit of Lipton's beefy onion soup mix. My five year old ate two helpings and wants more for breakfast! Thanks!

My family enjoyed these as individual packets.  The general consensus was that they were a bit bland, however.  I think next time I'll add some salt to the mushroom sauce, and some additional seasonings to the ground beef mixture.

I made this and liked it.  My husband wasn't as fond since he isn't an onion fan, but he still ate it.

This recipe was really easy to make, but it was way too heavy tasting for my likes.  Also the sauce is good when you add salt to it.  I also used ground turkey (I use ground turkey for everything).  I think this is one of those recipes where you either love it or you don't.  It wasn't bad at all though, just not for me.

I made these probably a year ago and I remember they were great. Maybe next time I'll cheat and just buy the cream of mushroom soup.

Loved this but did add tsp of Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce with about 1/4tsp of garlic powder to hamburger mix.  It cooked well and was not greasy.  Everyone really liked this and would eat it again.  Loved the mushroom sauce.

With extra seasoning added to the beef to un-bland it, this was really good!  My family liked it, even the picky littles.  I don't think I'll make it too often, as all those crescent rolls get expensive when you have to scale the recipe to a large family, but it was tasty enough to serve to guests.  Among other things, I added Penzy's Prime Rib Rub to the beef, which gave it a great flavor.

I absolutely hate giving any recipe one star, but this was really bad. We used lean ground beef (93/7) but even so, the fat kept the pastry from getting flaky, so it was bland meat mix inside doughy, wet pastry. It was so unappealing. There was very little flavor so even that couldn't save this dish. I ended up throwing it away.

This didn't turn out how I was expecting.  The mixture was good, and the sauce was good, but the crescent rolls were too puffy (yet dense) for the ground beef.  We liked the separate components but not the whole :(  
Thank you just the same!

I added green chiles and before I closed the bread over the top I put in some swiss cheese.  It tasted almost like a philly cheese steak sandwich.  My three year old asked for it three days in a row.

My husband and I thought this was pretty good. i would make again. It was a nice way to change up ground beef. I used cream of mushroom soup and added some flour and milk to make it more of a gravy. I also added mozzeralla to the beef mixture and brushed the tops with egg whites. I had to bake mine for 38 minutes though. Many possiblities of changing it up. Thanks for this recipe!

I liked this recipe.  I'm more inclined to give it about a 3.5 (the boyfriend says it's a solid 4 and the best thing I've ever made.)  This Beef Wellington was unbelievably easy to make.  The onions were prominent, but I would have liked more of the mushroom flavor.  I will definitely add more next time.  I was somewhat disappointed that my sauce did not come out thin (it was very thick like cream of mushroom soup), so any suggestions on that please shoot them to me.

I just made this tonight almost exactly to the recipe and it was AWESOME! I didn't use the mushrooms and I added other seasonings like garlic and a mixed seasoning to the sauce. Other than that it was exact and tasted amazing. My husband is in the military and needs a good solid dinner and he thought this was the greatest thing on earth.

I made this for my husband and he gives it a 6 out of 5. He didn't like the sauce. Next time we will try it with sliced mushrooms sauteed in butter instead of the sauce.

I'm new to the allrecipe site and I tried this one last night....FANTASTIC!  I had to substitute some items as some of the other reviewers did, I used cream of mushroom soup to replace the gravy, and I omitted the chopped onion, used onion powder, lowry's seasoned salt, and black pepper to season.  I added 2 tbsp of the cream of mushroom soup to the ground beef mixture and about 1/3 of a cup of shredded cheddar/jack cheese.  The Wellington's came out wonderful!

This was a big hit with my husband and very picky 4 year old.  I doubled the meat so it made 3 larger loaves...and cooked the with the meat so they would soften.  I also added some shredded mozzarella to the sauce and to the beef mixture.  And a little bit of our favorite seasoning to the sauce.  I will definitely make this one again and again!

Wow.  Yummy.  Ummmm.  Those were some sounds when my family tasted this.  I use a little less liquid in the meat cubes so they don't all apart,  I added some bread crumbs, too.  I've made this twice, and I'm sure I will make it again.

This is really easy and very yummy! I made it once with chopped sausage instead of ground beef, 4 cheese italiano, red, green & yellow peppers, it was a little messy to make (it didn't stick together like the beef does), but it was VERY yummy!

Tasted good.  I used cream of mushroom soup and a little milk instead of making the cream sauce.  I also used dried minced onions istead of fresh because that's what I had.  The only thing I didn't like was that it was a pain to try to seal the crescent rolls.  My filling kept wanting to leak out.

This was a great recipe.  I followed some of the other reviewer suggestions, such as using onion soup mix.  And the campbell's golden mushroom soup in the sauce.  I'm looking forward to making them again, but stuffing them with beef and mushrooms, or with ground turkey and dried fruit.  So many possibilities, so excited about this convenient little meat package  :)

This was good, found that the bottom got soggy but that could be the type of beef we used.  We made then as individual rather then 1 big one.  will make these again but will try putting them on a rack so they won't be sitting in the juices

This turned out better than I thought it would. I did adjust the recipe a bit. I sauted onion, garlic, mushroom, and celery. Added the beef and 1\2 can golden mushroom soup, 1\2 cup cheddar cheese, handfull bread crumbs and 1 egg. I wrapped the mixture like instructed and it turned out great...got lots of compliments!!

Good, easy recipe. Could use a bit more flavour as other reviewers have suggested. With a bit more flavour this is a perfect family choice. I would suggest starting the sauce after the meat is in the oven so that it does not solidify too much.

I read the reviews when I made this because my husband doesn't like mushrooms, so I was looking for a substitute.  I made it with the onion soup mix and the cheese and it turned out good, except that it was VERY salty.  Also, the gravy didn't turn out at all for me, so I just left that part out.  But I would make it again, just with less mix or more meat.

Was a great recipe but only thing I did not like was the bottom of the crescent rolls got soggy from the ingredients on the inside.  Next time I will probably tweek it a little.  Didn't do the mushroom sauce due to allergies but served with brown gravy and was very tasty.

This was very good the only thing is the meat needs something more. But will make again, my family loved it.

This is an okay recipe.  Nothing spectacular about it and a bit bland.  But I enjoyed trying it out.  Thanks.

I added Italian spices to the meat and used a whole egg. I brushed the top with egg and baked. The bottom of the crescent rolls were burnt and top was undercooked.  Not making this again.

I loved it!  So good.  I took some others advice and used golden mushroom soup in the gravy and I also added in some salt.  Also, I brushed the crescent rolls in an eggwash before baking.  A keeper!

Added a little Dale's sauce to the gravy and used cream of mushroom and some milk instead of cream. Just what I had on hand and it worked really well.

This recipe was very good...I really give it a 3 and a half stars. However, I mostly followed the recipe as a guideline. I saute'd the mushrooms in butter, then added the garlic. I followed another person's recipe and added onion soup 3 Tblsp from a packet to the meat, an egg,  bread crumbs,and some onion powder. I added the mushrooms to the meat, then wrapped it in the crescent dough. I made brown gravy from a packet and added another Tblsp of the onion soup packet. It really turned out quite nice. I would recommend this and would make this again.

This recipe was outstanding. I made this for 2, but doubled the recipe and it still came out fantastic. The combination of crescent rolls and ground beef was amazing. Definitely a favorite!

I made a variation of this recipe. Instead of making them large, I made 8 little ones per croissant package. (1lb ground sirloin = 2 packages) I also used the left over mushroom sauce for mashed potatoes and drizzled everything with beef gravy I made with stock. They were really good!
