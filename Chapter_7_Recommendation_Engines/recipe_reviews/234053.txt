This is a new favorite! Thanks so much for posting.  I made these alterations to make them vegan: (1) I used a homemade vegan parmesan cheese substitute (consisting of crushed sesame, garlic powder, onion powder and vegan boullion)(2) 1T Flax seed + 3T water to substitute the egg.

My husband complained a little that they were slightly dry and had a little too much tempeh aftertaste.

Next time I would make these slight alterations:
(1) Add some fennel seed (maybe 1 tsp)for added flavor
(2) Might add a little chopped spinach leaves for color and a little added moisture.
(3) Double the boiling time on the tempeh from 5 minutes to 10 to hopefully cut down on any aftertaste... in any event, I'm sure once they're served with tomatoe sauce, any after-taste wouldn't be noticeable.  Added to my recipe box!

Great texture, awesome flavor! I didn't have the spices so I used a tablespoon of Italian seasoning and a teaspoon of thyme. My kids love them. I will definitely make this again!

These were moist and super easy! I actually misread the directions and wound up putting all the ingredients in the food processor and it worked out beautifully.  I will say these are better warm, so I'll keep that in mind next time. I'd like to play around with these and possibly add oats instead if bread crumbs or add onion, but I think they're great. Thanks for a great "meatball!"

My first ever recipe with tempeh.  Made 18 nice-size (probably 1.5-2 inch diameter) balls.  Served with pasta and marinara.  I liked this well enough.  DH said he might want to experiment with it a bit, maybe tossing the tempeh in the food processor or putting it in a sandwich instead.

These were delicious. I used a 3 grain tempeh that has a milder flavor than straight up soy. I used Italian bread crumbs, didn't have dried parsley and I added 1/4 tsp fennel. They were delicious and my 3 year old loved them!

These are delicious! As another review pointed out, they are really dry. Definitely something to eat with sauce. Super easy to make, and super tasty! Thanks!

The tempeh balls still had the weird sharp aftertaste after pre-boiling for 10 minutes. I cooked them in marinara sauce before serving.
Next time I will crumble it and then boil it, maybe it will be better.

Not good on the consistency: mushy.  I even baked them 10 extra minutes to try to firm up.  No good.  Won't make this again.

Thought these were a good veggie option, one that we might use if we have a need for vegetarian meatballs. I added about 4 oz grated mozzarella to the mix and broiled the last 5 minutes. Note: they necessitate a sauce, and really a marinara would be best.
