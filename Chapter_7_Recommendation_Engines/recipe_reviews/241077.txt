This was just ok for me! I think I would lessen the amount of mayo and curry I slather on. It did not get the nice crust on it I had hoped. I would try broiling it next time for a few minutes.

I took a few liberties with this recipe to suit our tastes.  First I cut the cauliflower in half while raw and steamed just half as there are only two of us eating.  I steamed the cauliflower in a steamer basket until just just tender but not falling apart and then set aside to cool a bit.  I mixed up the full amount of mayonnaise and curry power and painted the entire surface with that mixture setting aside the rest for dipping sauce.   Baked for 8 minutes without the cheese and then added the cheese and set the oven to broil for two minutes, until the cheese was melted and formed a crust.  It made a very pretty presentation.   Nice thing is this can be made ahead to the point of the final bake / broil.   Thanks for an inspiring recipe.

Very tasty! I had tried another curry cauliflower recipe on AR and this one is much better! I love the cheese on top.  The flavor is perfect, but it's a little messy to serve. The cheese forms a "crust" over top, so when you try to cut the florets apart, the crust is hard to cut through and ends up coming off in one big piece. No biggie, maybe I just need to adjust cooking time.

I am always looking for new side dishes to try and I love cauliflower so I just had to try this. I didn't have curry in my seasoning supply so I used the Mild Curry Powder recipe from this site. It worked great. Since I was cooking this for just myself I decided against using the whole head of cauliflower. I cut the florets apart, which were quite large themselves, and boiled about six of them. I wanted to follow the recipe as is but I would have preferred to steam them. For the cheese I just shredded some sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses and combined them. While I enjoyed the chance to try something different I'm not convinced I'm a curry fan. Loved the ease of this recipe.

I added a but too much curry powder but it turned out great with some added mayo. The dish can be bland if you don't  have enough cheese. Make sure you cut up the cauliflower into florets. Its going to be made again for sure!

I made this as written and we loved it! I broiled it on high for the last 2 minutes to make sure it was nice and crusty. My boyfriend said it was the best cauliflower he ever had. Definitely a keeper!

This is my new favorite way to fix cauliflower. Full of flavor! I did use a combination of cheddar and pepper jack since it's what I had in the frig.

I love curry so this recipe was a hit with me. I don't think it needs the cheese as the curry forms a nice crust itself.  I would make this again!

I cut the cauliflower into bite size pieces and then tossed it in my mixture before I roasted it.  I'm pretty sure I made more of the mixture, but I made enough to coat the cauliflower I had.  I definitely used more curry, and I also added lemon pepper and season salt to the mixture.  Super tasty!!

truly delicious.  I cooked the cauliflower until it was quite soft.  I would have given it 5  stars, except that I try to avoid adding mayo and cheese to veggies since they don't actually need more fat  or sugar to make them tasty.  Nonetheless, this tasted very good.
