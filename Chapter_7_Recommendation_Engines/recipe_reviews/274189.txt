This was SO DELICIOUS!!  I didnâ€™t use the coffee.  It was fast and easy and my husband loved it.  You would never guess that it is dairy free.

I tried this & thought it was smashing!!  I threw in a couple tsp. of peanut butter & loved it.  I skipped the powder sugar & vanilla.A side note, I've had better luck in my food processor  rather then my Vita mix.

I used 3 large bananas I already had in the freezer,thawed for 5 min. peeled and used a bit more cocoa I had on hand and a bit less sugar-mashed with a potato masher (I think too much get wasted in a blender) and whipped with a fork and whisk.I put it in a shallow casserole and just used an ice cream scoop.Thank you Yoly-wonderful dessert.
