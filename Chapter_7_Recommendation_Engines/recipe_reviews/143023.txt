This is a great starting-off point, but I like my stew thicker and containing tomatoes. I'd suggest the following changes: 1 can of HOT green chiles instead of 3, 1 entire onion, use 2-3 zucchini instead of a squash (or use both), corn is optional, add 3 diced large tomatoes or a can of diced tomatoes, and use approximately 5 cups (1 liter) of vegetable broth (or 1 Tablespoon of vegetable bouillon powder in 5 cups or 1 liter of water) for liquid, in total.  It doesn't need 7 cups of liquid.  Kidney beans can be used if pinto beans are not available.  Half a package of frozen spinach, if fresh is not available.   If you like REALLY thick stew, remove some of the potatoes near the end of cooking, blend in blender or food processor, and add back to the stew.  Salt to taste. Enjoy!

This was great!!!  I added a little extra garlic and a little extra chili powder (we like it spicy).  I also added sliced mushrooms...just because they are my favorite.  I thought 5 cups of water might have been too much.  So, I put 4 cups of water and 3 cups of vegetable broth.  It was soooo good.  I will be using this again for sure.  You can play around with the vegetables, but it is wonderful and has a great flavor.  Really glad I found this recipe!!!

I though this stew was very good. I needed more salt. I would also use three potatoes instead of four, and add another can of beans. Plus I would use half the amount of water. The flavor was very good though. I will definitely make this again.

Really good recipe...I didn't have any squash but it's still very filling and a meal in itself.  I also didn't have the right amount of chiles but had some green enchilada sauce on hand.  I used small red potatoes and celery salt intead of celery (not a big fan of celery!).  I will be making this again!  Thanks!

This is just a great Vegetable Stew! I make this all the time. I always have different veggies depending on the squash I can get. Turnip, parsnip, sweet potatoes, yams they are all work well in the mix. Just delicious!

I thought it was kinda short on flavor.. I added extra green chiles. I'd say 2 more cans of green chiles atleast. 1-2 cups less water, more spices 1/2 tsp of each but paprika and 3/4 tsp of cumin.. I left the spaghetti squash put and it was awesome! and cilantro a dash. :)

I made this for a new mom who was craving a "root vegetable stew" for a cold winter's night. Because she had a yen for something more than just potatoes, I used one potato, one sweet potato, one parsnip, and one rutabaga/turnip. No corn. I asked her to report back to me with a review: she said it was great, just what she wanted, nice spice level (used two cans, not three) and she threw in a can of drained chick peas with the leftovers because it worked for her!  Thanks Mrs. Hinman!

Always looking for delicious recipes that incorporate lots of vegies.  This recipe is delicious as is...although I like to add a can or two of salsa verde (found in the Mexican cooking section) in place of the green chilis for extra bite.  Also is great used as a chicken recipe. Today I had extra cooked chicken breasts so I used chicken broth in place of vegetable broth and put in my cubed chicken.  I also add extra onion and garlic and today I had extra spaghetti squash and no yellow squash.  I put in whatever I had. Great northern beans, frozen soup vegetables, and the rest was the same.  My family loves it with chicken.

I love that it's vegetarian, but 5 cups of water is too much.  I eyeballed it as I was adding it and stopped at 3, and I believe that was plenty.  Otherwise, it would have been too watered-down.  We don't find green chiles to be spicy, and would add diced jalapenos for added kick.  Tomatoes would be a nice addition also.  Served it with garlic toast and my family enjoyed it.  Meat eaters could easily add chicken or ground beef.

This recipe as written really lacks flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and am very disappointed.  After it was all cooked I added more chili powder, spanish paprika, and 2 extra cans of chili's.  The spinach should be added 10 minutes before the recipe is done. The recipe also calls for too much water.   It could use more corn, beans, and less potato to make it a bit healthier.

Greatly enjoyed this recipe as did the family.  I eliminated the water entirely and went with 40 oz of broth.  I also used a teaspoon of chili powder and doubled the paprika.  Definitely gave it a kick.

I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth.  I also added juice from 1/2 lemon and fresh mushrooms.  Absolutely delicious!!!  My husband and I both loved it.  ALOT!

Very tasty, but a little bland which didn't surprise me given the small amount of seasonings for all those vegetables.  I added about a tablespoon of seasoned salt to it after tasting and that perked it up a bit.  I also had to make it without spinach (which I didn't have) and spaghetti squash (which I didn't want), so instead of using just 1/3 cup of frozen corn I put in the whole 12 oz bag.  Also, I found only 2 cups of water necessary.  A good vegetable stew and perfect on a cold evening with corn bread.

Delicious and one of the first soup recipes I haven't had to season over and above the recipe so it tastes decent. I would maybe decrease the amount of liquid a bit depending on preference but overall wonderful! I will make it over and over again :)

We all loved this soup.  I added Rotisserie chicken to make it heartier and homemade pinto beans with Zucchini instead of yellow squash and it was filling and amazing!

This is a good base recipe as written, but it needs more flavor to make it five-star worthy. I made it as written but when I tasted it I found it bland and I knew my family would feel the same. I recommend adding cumin and increasing the chili powder/paprika. Add some more salt and zest half a lime in there. Cut back on the water or just use all broth instead of water. Great way to use up leftover veggies and, with the above changes, something I'd certainly make again. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is a strong base for a good stew, but was not quite to my liking.  As another reader observed, the recipe calls for too much liquid - in order to cook down the prescribed liquid sufficiently to call it stew instead of soup, one would have to cook until the veggies turn to mush.  My approach was to use about half the liquid called for, then added a little more to (almost) cover the veggies.  Also, as already noted, salt was needed.  Finally, garlic, garlic, garlic!  1/4 tsp not nearly enough, and I also added some leftover tomato sauce and a healthy amount of grated parmesan cheese.  Oh, and I used fresh chiles rather than canned, about the same weight, 12 oz.  With the adjustments, this was quite delicious.  Thank you for the great start, Mrs. Hinman!

I tried this and now I have it at least once a week. It's a large pot of stew for 2 so I freeze the rest for the following week. I also add only 1 can of green chile peppers to each 1/2 batch right before heating it up. This is sooooo good.
