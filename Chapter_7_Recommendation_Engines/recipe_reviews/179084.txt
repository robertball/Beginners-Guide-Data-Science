3.5 as written for me, 4 if you substitute another dressing for the soup mix over the salad.  The soup mixture tasted great on the chicken while grilling, but I didnt like the taste (or texture) of the mix with the salad greens.  Really hard one to rate, debateable on whether to have chicken again, but doubt we will have the salads again.

This came out delicious and I would definitely make it again. I used olive oil instead of veg oil in the dressing and tripled the amount of ginger & garlic. I also added shaved almonds to the salad, and marinated the chicken in soy sauce, lemon juice, ginger, pepper and celery seed before starting, and made stove top.

Wow - Definitely not a fan of the sauce.  I was able to salvage the salad with another Asian dressing and some toasted almonds.  Will not be making this again.
