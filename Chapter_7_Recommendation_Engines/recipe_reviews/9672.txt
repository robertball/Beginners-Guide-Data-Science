Yum! I brought these to a party, and everyone raved about them. They have a delightful light, fluffy, soft & chewy texture. The spices work really well. Next time I would use more ground walnuts - I used double what the recipe called for, but couldn't taste it at all. I ground the walnuts in our coffee grinder - so easy! I used dried cranberries because I didn't have any dates around. The batter looks like cake batter. I refrigerated the batter for about 24 hours due to time constraints, and the extra fridge time did them no harm. I also found 400F to be too hot: 8-10 minutes at 375 is plenty for these cookies.

These cookies taste good but bake into a thin wafer that is easy to burn and hard to remove from the cookie sheet.  I found the hotter oven of 400F+ resulted in a fluffier cookie.  Also if you use a scoop, flatten the top for even baking.
