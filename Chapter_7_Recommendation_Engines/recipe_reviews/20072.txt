Finally a wheat bread recipe that's not sweetened! This is as tasty as German breads, but mine was not as elastic. I did tweak it, using oats instead of cornmeal and flax seeds instead of sesame seeds, and I used all water rather than part milk (more in line with German recipes). Based on a previous review I doubled the salt, but that made it a bit too salty for my taste. Next time I would stick with 1 - 1 1/2 tsp. salt. It is still a very good old world-like bread.

I skipped the seeds, and I used coursely-ground cornmeal that I had let soak in the 3/4 c. milk. I added about 2 T. gluten to this as well. I let it rise twice, baked it in a 9x5 pan in a 350 oven, and it rose really well. It perhaps could use a bit more salt.

This recipe made a really dense loaf.  Very yeasty.  The combination of whole wheat and corn meal made a really neat texture and flavor.  There is no sweetener in the recipe so it seemed to be missing a key flavor.  Not bad, I think I'll tweak it a bit next time.

I tried this recipe twice and both times the same - a dough that is way too dry and a bad tasting result.

Crisp, crunchy and dense like biscotti but with less flavor!  I like the seeds in the bread and on top along with the whole wheat and corn meal.  Next time, I think I will add 2 T honey, and see if we like it better, although I like the idea of not even having a sweetener in the bread!
