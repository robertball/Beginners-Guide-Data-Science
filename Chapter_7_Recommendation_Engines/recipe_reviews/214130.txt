We liked this on burgers. We'll use the leftovers on hot dogs, maybe. My husband LOVED it, he's a huge jalapeno fan. Just an FYI to anyone else -- this recipe divider program does not divide in half correctly. When you switch the serving size to 24, it gives you equal amounts of jalapenos and pickles, instead of 2:1 as it should be. I'm sure they'll fix it at some point, but for right now, just be careful if you re-size this recipe or you could wind up wasting ingredients! Thanks for the recipe, Christopholofigus! EDIT: Adding that my husband did eat this on watermelon slices! He doesn't like watermelon, (but we eat it anyway, for health benefits), so he had nothing to lose by trying -- but he DID like the watermelon better with this on it :) Just adding that for anyone who's curious about trying it that way!

This was FANTASTIC!  I made pretty close to as written w/the exception of using 1/2C less jalaps (my jar was only 12 oz I belatedly realized) and omitting the black pepper (I'm a freak who hates black pepper).  I even measured everything since I'd have no reference point for a jalapeno relish (and since it has so few reviews).  Awesome.  Just awesome.  I took it to a casual dinner party and we inhaled it both as is w/Scoops and atop grilled pork chops.  I can't wait to try it on grilled burgers and dogs and to mix it w/some sour cream to cut the heat for sissies for a nice spread/dip.  The possibilities are endless, but you NEED to try this!  Don't be intimidated at first bite; the heat hits you up front, yet is gone before you have time to swallow.  It's good stuff!  THANKS for sharing, Chrisopholofigus!

Sounds great. I'm going to omit the tequila (non drinker). Would anyone who has tried this recipe recommend a substitute, or just leave it out?

WOW!  What a hit this was at our cookout! Love, love, love it!  I was going to make a half batch (yes, the re-sizer is waaaay off so beware!) but I went ahead with the whole recipe and am SO glad I did!  There was only a little bit left and that was quickly used up when the kids made their school lunches with the leftover burgers.  It vanished!  GONE!  We really enjoyed this and it was requested that I keep a nice, big, jar of this on hand at all times!***update*** Our fridge is never without a big jar of this!  We do add more garlic than called for and just kinda splash the tequila in there - just might be a little more of that than called for in there too ;)

I had half a jar of jalapeno slices that I wanted to use up, so I made a half batch of this recipe.  We served this on burgers.  I will say that this was pretty hot, at least for us (and I wouldn't consider us spice wimps), so you'll definitely want to serve this on a bun with other condiments to cut the heat.

This was a great addition to my turkey dog. I didnt have tequila so I didnt use it. I also ate this with a few blue corn tortilla chips and that was really good. Like another reviewer said, I bet this would be good with Frito Scoops as a dip.

This is AWESOME!!    Served it with Oklahoma cheese grits, and both were gone before anything else on the table. Thanks so much for the recipe.   Make a double batch--one to serve and one to share!

Good relish!  Served it on zippy burgers (from this site).  The only change I made was I added a little sugar.  But overall it tasted great on the burgers and I'm so glad I tried it.  DH loved it.

Good stuff to have around! It lasts forever in the fridge, and can be used a million ways. Dress up a boring turkey sanwich, burger, hot dog...add to tuna salad, or you can even add it to cream cheese/sour cream to make a spicy party dip to go with veggies and crackers.

This has been in my recipe box forever and I finally made some today. Wow is this ever good without even putting it on anything. I didn't have tequila and it still taste great. I'd like to try it with some tequila. I made some to give as gifts and the first batch was very hot, my jalapeños are Mt. Olive and quite spicy. So I kept that one for me and made one and half cup of pickles to the same amount of jalapeños. Used a sweet onion and dry dill. I'm sure this will get even better after it sits for a few days. Think this will be a staple in my fridge from now on...can't wait to have it on a burger or dog.

Ay, caramba! Lol yea it's spicy alright. I followed everything except the dill. Updated Jan.11,2012: These became a staple at our house. Sometimes we add a little bit of pepperoncini's to it. We have used it for hot dogs, burgers, eggs, and even italian beef for sandwiches (AR).

Delicious! Had it at a Fabulous party I went to ( Beach bash) LOL and even got to take some home. Spent the next 2 days putting it on everything I put in my mouth!  A bit spicy and tangy. Perfect:) Thank You Christopholofigus!

This is good, but it is rather spicy, and I reversed the amount of jalapeno to pickle ratio (we don't do very spicy in this household).  That worked for us, so I think it just depends on your spicy tolerance.  If you like spicy, I'm sure you'll like it as is.  Because I was also making tartar sauce at the same time, I minced the pickles in the food processor, removed them, then minced the jalapenos in the food processor, then added to the rest of hte ingredients.  I don't have fresh onions so used dried minced onions.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have any garlic on hand so I just put in some garlic powder instead.  This is great for BBQ, thanks for sharing your recipe.

A friend made this, and it was incredible. I immediately went home and made some. This relish is so versatile. Hotdogs and hamburgers become gourmet with this relish. Another friend put it into her salmon dip. It's good on eggs too. Have fun experimenting!

I will always have this relish in hand! Made it for a cookout--it was a big hit. I didn't change anything, and I don't think I ever will. My son took quite a bit home with him, so maybe next time, I'll double the recipe. Thanks for a great relish!

I've made this several times, but obviously forgot to rate it...sorry, Mr. Infamous! This stuff is addicting - I need to buy jalapenos by the gallon now! I've always used and loved every ingredient listed (except fresh dill, which I never have, so use dry) and can't imagine why I never thought to put them together as a condiment on their own...It takes a Genius to "invent" simple stuff too, I guess! Thanks so much for thinking of us and posting this! PS to the reviewer that says it has "no taste of jalapenos" - I think you forgot to put them in OR your taste buds are shot.

Oh wow...this is great!  I did double the onion and garlic because I could not help myself and it was perfect for us.  We had it on hot dogs but it will be good on so many things.  We will also, as others have stated, always have this on hand it is that good.

AWESOME! Super spicy, but super yuumy! Made as written aside from cutting the recipe down. Served this as a condiment for hot dogs. Hubby gave it two thumbs up, lol. I would make this again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've made this several times. My friends that like jalapenos love it and ask me to make more. I like to do 1/2 fresh jalapeno and 1/2 pickled jalapenos. Great stuff!
