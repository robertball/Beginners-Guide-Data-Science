WOW!  I did everything just like the recipe said and didn't omit any ingredients.  Also, I recommend PEPPY'S PITA BREAD recipe to serve these kabobs in and the AVOCADO TZITZIKI SAUCE recipe.  If you want a cheater recipe, use store-bought Greek flatbread, substitute sour cream for tzatziki, and feta for goat cheese.  This will make it prep time much faster and overall cheaper.

Pretty good, but a little too spicy. The lamb doesn't need the mayo because lamb is already a bit oily. I added red wine vinegar and that added a nice touch, plus green onions instead of red ones. Also, instead of grilling I broiled the meat until brown on top and cooked throughout. Served with feta, sliced tomatoes, and whole wheat pita. Very tasty!

Not bad. I omitted the mayo because I thought it might be a little greasy. I also left out the raisins because I cannot stand meat and fruit. I liked the taste but if I made it again, I would use feta not goat's cheese so it would be a little saltier. Finally, I browned the kebabs in a skillet, then baked them for 35 mins. We had them with pittas, and cucumber/yogurt sauce.

Delicious dish. One suggestion = small portions on wooden skewers. Cooking is trouble if you use metal skewers or add too much meat - the meat will fall off. This is fabolous with the homemade Tazeki ....

this turned out very good, but it seemed to make a LOT more than 6 kabobs. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was easy and very flavorful.  will make again as patties rather than kabobs.  thanks

I was looking for a ground lamb recipe and absolutely loved the base ingredients...I omitted the raisins because I dont care much for them,I added rosemary instead of cilantro due to thats what I had on hand and prepared the mix in the morning and put them all together then chilled them all day in the fridge..That seemed to hold them together much easier..I also started them in foil on the grill and finished them directly on the grill~I was afraid they would fall apart!!Worked beautifully.Paired them with fresh tzatki sauce and cucumber and tomatoe salad with Pita on the side!!!Added to my Favorites!!Loved it!!!

Absolutely sensational. My husband who loves lamb couldn't resist taking thirds. The raisins add such a bright accent to the  meat. Don't skimp on using goat cheese, it definately adds to the flavour.

Easy and tasty. I would have given it a 5-stars, but I thought 3/4-tablespoon cayenne pepper was way over the top. The cayenne pepper was decreased to 1/2-teaspoon. I didn't make kabobs, but formed mixture into meatballs and broiled them instead. I bet this mixture would make some awesome burgers -- or sauteed and spread over a pizza.

These were very good.  I served them with the Qabali rice (boil the rice for only 3-5 minutes)from this site and a cilantro/parsley pepper sauce.  I will make this combination again!

A very simple yet a dish with very subtle and delicate tastes. The raisins complement the cayenne pepper.  The cilantro and the onions give the fresh taste.  The mayo and the goat cheese makes it juicy!   I upped the quantity of cayenne pepper, cumin and coriander by half.  This is a must make for the next party!

Good taste, but was a mess. Ended up making burgers out of half of it because I could not get the meat to stay on the skewers. I also used small wooden skewers and made over 20! Very greasy, omit the mayo

Made these as per the recipe but cut the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. and it was fine, just the slightest kick. Big problem on the grill, though, due to lamb's high fat content. A low flame may help. I had visions of the propane tank blowing up! Will definitely make ahead next time to firm them up.

These were great! The recipe makes much more than 6 kabobs so for two people we cut the recipe in half. It still made about 6 decent sized kabobs. We did modify the recipe though using feta cheese instead of goats cheese, no raisins, and no mayo. Really tastes great with garlic sauce!

Fantastic! Thinking it would be too spicy, I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp, but next time I'll use the full amount. I also reduced the mayo by half and glad I did. I served with basmati rice and Vegetarian Chickpea Curry with Turnips. My husband and I both loved it.

Made into meatballs and served with Morrocan vegetable soup recipe on this site.  Very yummy!  Might try adding some pine nuts for crunch.  Delicious...looking forward to meatball sandwiches from the few left overs.

Great recipe! Put them over a rack in the oven on 400 for 25 min, then broiled on high for a few minutes on either side for texture and color. Went great with Moroccan couscous.

I thought this was an amazing recipe - I feel this is one of my secret recipes that I'll whip out to impress guests. I always wondered what the secret was to fluffy "Kofte" (ground middle-eastern meatballs) rather than dense little round burgers. This recipe captures it - awesome.

These were flavorful but even though I did not add the mayo they were still a bit greasy. Infact they did not stay on the skewers at all. Next time I will make them in to patties.

I don't care for lamb, but in these it was really good!! My husband ate them all up with his brothers! Their only complaint was too many raisins.  I even broiled them rather than grilled.  I will make again and I would say a strong 4 1/2, just would cut back on the raisins. thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've earned brownie points with My Mother-In-Law with this one. I haven't used All-Recipes in a while, I've forgotten how wonderful it is and I must share my experiences as I have benefitted so much from other reviews. I followed this recipe to the "T" and the kabobs were so fragrant and tasty. My husband and mother-in-law who lived in India for many years, know and love Middle Eastern food.  I, who did not like lamb, enjoyed these kabobs. One consensus is to leave out the raisins, which many reviewers have suggested and we'd have to agree. We also like flavor and spice, this definitely has a kick. I served the kabobs on pita bread with sliced onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and the "Persian Cucumber Yogurt (Maast-o Khiar" (also found on All-Recipe, see my review). The yogurt helps balance the spiciness.  I like simple and effective recipes and this is definitely one.
