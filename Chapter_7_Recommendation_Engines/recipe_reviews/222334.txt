This was exceptionally good with honey used instead of sugar. Am just about to make it again. A very good way to use the excess blackberries that didn't get made into jam. Very easy too.

I had this as a dessert for two along with some ginger snaps.  My berries were picked the day after a rain so may have been less flavorful!than optimal. I added a little more black pepper and would probably increase it even more.  Very easy and refreshing.
