I am rating this recipe based off of my fiance's reviews as i had never cooked or eaten meatloaf. He absolutely raved about it. He said that it was hands down the best meatloaf he had ever eaten! Much like the other reviewers, it is vital that you chop the onions REALLY small. I think next time i will saute them first just because i don't like the crunch the onions had in the dish. It was not my favorite but because he liked it so much that i will be making it again and again!!

Very, very good! We really enjoyed the tomato sauce. I didn't have rice vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and it was still yummy! Thanks for adding another good recipe to my collection!

Wonderful recipe! Everyone enjoyed this
and I'll use this recipe again. I doubled the recipe and I ended up with too much tomato sauce, so next time I won't double the sauce.
Thanks for the great recipe!

Instead of meatloaf, I used this recipe for meatballs and served the sauce over top.  My husband really liked it.  The kids liked the meatballs but not the sauce.  The sauce was definitely tangy...it was a nice change of pace.

This was delicious.  So juicy and the sauce was great!  I did tweak it a little.  I used a half cup of onion and instead of a half cup of the tomato mixture, I used 3 quarter cup.

I hate to give such a low rating but this meatloaf didn't set! It was a soft mushy dish that looked more like a sloppy joe than meatloaf.

I double checked the recipe and I followed it exactly. I wonder what I did to get such different results than the others.

It was an easy recipe & it was very good but I thought it needed more favor which it kind of lacked.

Yummy! This was really good meatloaf! It tasted great. I accidentally omitted the onions, but I didn't miss them. It doesn't make a whole ton which is good for my household.
