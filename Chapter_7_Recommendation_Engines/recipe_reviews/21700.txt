This was a very good recipe, however I kicked it up a notch and added prosiutto and mozzarella to it.
when I spli the roast I added the prosiutto and then mozzarella, then the spinach, then another layer of mozzarella followed by another layer of prosiutto.

my wife and friens said it should have been one of the specials on the menu at a resturaunt.  it came out sensational.

try it.

I loved the spinach filling in this, however, the sauce didn't do much for me.  I actually made this last thurs, and I wasn't sure if it was my buds, or if there was a "taste" that I just wasn't sure about.  It was the "taste" & I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know for a fact that it isn't the filling.  I added water chestnuts to the filling, because I had an extra can starring me in the face.  The roast itself came out very tasty, nice & tender, but if I were to make this again, I would use olive oil (like in the roasted pork loin, from this site) instead of the sauce because that roast came out fantastic!  Use a meat thermometer to ensure proper cooking time & your roast will not be dry.  This would be equally great with pork chops as other have suggested!  Thanks Mariah!

We agreed the basic recipe was very good.  But I would never have cooked it that long.  I took it out at 140 degrees and tented it for 15 mins.  For my family we added more garlic and some cilantro in the stuffing and more cumin in the sauce.  I also make the sauce several hours ahead so the flavors meld, chill it and then bring back to room temp.  And since I first made this I've learned to double the spinach stuffing mixture.  It is so much better and makes the presentation even more distinct.  I also have been known to add a shot or two of bourbon to the sauce!!!  This is an update - I originally reviewed it years ago and continue to love it and make it often.

Great recipe and very tasty!  If you want to be brave, I like to mix up a sour creme sauce with some spinach, dijon mustard, crushed thyme, a little black pepper and serve with it.  It really sets it off!
BTW - I like to take the pork out of the oven at 145 to 150 degrees.  It will finish cooking by the time you serve, and reduce the chances of dry meat!

I just made this recipe for a dinner party and it was a huge success. I didn't think I's like the orange flavored glaze so I substituted apple cider for the orange juice and the flavor was great.

LOVED this recipe.  This was the first pork roast that my husband liked.  I made it for a dinner party and everyone wanted the recipe.  When I served some leftovers to friends the next day they wanted the recipe too.  I don't think I've ever tasted anything quite like this one, at least in pork.  VERY good.  I went by the meat thermometer rather than the stated cooking time and the pork was very juicy, I also basted several times throughout. Try this one, very, very good.

easy to prepare and not too much fuss.  I used fresh baby spinach and a smaller tenderloin, but worked out just fine.  I felt the 2 hour cooking time was way too long, so watch that.   I also used a little less orange juice, as it was a little overpowering.  Overall, a really nice taste.  I would do again.

I think maybe the cooking time is way too long. I used a meat thermometer and the roast was done way before the cooking time stated. It turned out very dry and salty. Maybe less cooking time, it will turn out better.

I was expecting a tastier dish because it smelled so good while in the oven, however it was just way too dry.  It needed some more flavor too.

I made this awesome dish & cut my pork loin so I was able to roll it jelly roll style.  I added the prosciuto & mozzarella as suggested & then the stuffing.  I basted it with worcestershire sauce, teriyaki sauce & dry white wine.  I seasoned with salt, pepper, & rosemary.  I baked as recommended, but took out at 145 degrees.  I tented it while preparing side dishes.  It was out of this world & the presentation was wonderful too.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This recipe is amazing though I made some adjustments. I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen and sauteed the onions, garlic and spinach in olive oil instead of butter, and I made my own breadcrumbs with sourdough bread.  I'm looking forward to making this again but adding bourbon to the sauce like one of the other reviewers recommended.  Fantastic recipe!!!!!!!

I enjoyed making this reciepe. However, the stuffing didn't turn out as well as I would have expected. It was too wet, I was hoping for a dryer mix.

I thought this was great! Instead of a pork loin, I used 4 pork chops and stuffed each one individually, but it tasted amazing!! I used a little more OJ than it called for, so it was a thinner sauce. Oh, and I peppered my chops before I basted them and used italian bread crumbs. My hubby is very picky and he liked it even more than I did! And my 2 year old ate spinach!!! That's a five star in my book :)

Delicious! There is a lot of stuffing to get into the pork - I actually cut three pockets and this worked well, used all the stuffing and added extra flavor to each slice. Also added some goat cheese.

I used it with stuffed pork chops, baked them in foil tent and put sauce on the last 10 minutes of baking uncovered. Loved the spinach stuffing & the sauce, Plenty of sauce, I'll use this one again. bake 50 mins. at 350, 1" bone in chops easy clean up.

Excellent dish!  Used 1lb of spinach and increased the butter by 4 tbs for sauting along with Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Baked for 1 hour and brazed with remaining sauce and baked again only 10 more minutes (used meat thermometer to confirm completeness).  Suggest making more sauce to coat when serving.  Also, would consider adding a mozorella or provolone cheese to stuffing.  Definitely a recipe I'll make again!  Thank you.

this was the best pork loin roast I ever had.  Made it in a Pyrex roasting pan w/ lid and it was delicious.  

After the spinach and onions were sauteed, I mixed in some Feta cheese, into the filling mix and stuffed the mix onto the pork-loin.  YUM!!!

Sorry, I found this to be very bland. It had absolutely no flavor to me. I put some shredded mozzarella cheese in with the spinach stuffing and omitted the teriyaki in the sauce (because I don't like teriyaki). I gave it two stars only because I deviated from the original recipe. Other people seem to like it a lot.....my family and I did not care for it.

Different & will make again. I used fresh spinach from the garden & only 2T of margarine. When I went to baste & cover the roast, my sauce had dried up. All came out ok though after covering & finish baking. Next time I'm going to baste even when it is uncovered & try mozzarella & mushrooms with the spinach mixture also.

This was a great recipe!  I made extra stuffing and lined the pan with it.  I also added canned mushrooms.  I used bone in chops (next time, no bones) and put two together with the stuffing in between and tied them together with kitchen twine.  I poured teryaki sauce over the stuffed chops and sprinkled cumin over the tops.  It was excellent!  We will make this again!

Very nice presentation and very easy to prepare.  Two hours was too long to bake - meat became dry.  Will definitely add to my recipe box.

I've done this recipe before and it's better to me without the sauce. I kicked it up myself and wrapped it in bacon and then seared it before baking. Also, I added mozzarella cheese! I'm doing it for a large cookout tomorrow using a 9 1/2 lb loin!! Wish me luck! I'll review afterwards

I made this last night for dinner, and got nothing but raves. It was very good. It was a little dry, but I think that's because my roast was bigger than the one in the recipe.

This is a really great recipe.  My whole family loved it.  I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the sauce.  I think next time I will triple it-- it's that good.  The only thing I did differently is brown the outside of the roast before cooking in the oven.

The recipe was SO easy!  I added a little bit more garlic because we love garlic almong with the rosemary red potato recipe I found here and my dinner guests just raved! The house smelled wonderful!   Tried the spinach stuffing with chicken breasts as well and it was DELICIOUS!

I've made this several times. In the beginning I made this just as written but I've changed the recipe a few times since then. I usually leave out the breadcrumbs, because I'm gluten intolerant. I've added gruyere cheese  and mushrooms and sometimes leave out the spinach. My family loves it either way. I always use a pork loin, not pork tenderloin. Easily feeds 4 people.

I've made this twice and it has come out great both times.  The first time I added mozzarella, the second time I made it as is, tomorrow I'm going to try feta cheese in the mix.  I only cook it for 1 1/2 hours, as that's plenty of time.

Excellent tasting loin.   I followed the recipe as written except that I increased the amount of the stuffing.   I also made one vertical cut and then horizontal cuts going out each way from that so that more stuffing would fit.   It looked like an inverted capital T when I was done.   I did have an issue of this loin being too dry when I served it, but I believe that was my fault by slicing too soon prior to eating.   In spite of that, I will make again.   I may try a brine prior to stuffing to help with some of the moisture retention.   Thanks for a great tasting and nice looking loin.

I didn't change a thing except I used thick boneless pork chops. I just cut the chops down the middle to make a pocket and stuffed the spinach into each of them (3-4 chops). Could have used more orangy flavor but maybe it was the brand juice I used or I could have squeezed fresh oranges w/pulp in with it. I didn't think the cumin would work well, but it did. My husband loved it and we both agreed that we would have paid at least $15 or more at a restaurant for this.   For side items, I sauteed fresh green beans in a clove of garlic and butter and then added about 1/2 cup of white vinegar . Low (2) heat or you will burn the garlic! Cook until dark green, of course.   For a second side item, I caramelized some apples with butter, let them sit covered until soft, then added about a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and a few dashes of cinnamon. Medium down to low heat for about 20 minutes.

I actually changed the sauce a little bit and increased the orange juice and added maple syrup... I seared the pork before putting it in the oven, poured the sauce over it, then covered it and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. It was a little dry so make sure you check every few minutes because it will dry up quickly.
I served it with orange and saffron infused rice. yum yum

Made this recipe like a month ago, so i don't know why i totally forgot about the ratings. I liked the filling in this recipe, but it needs a little bit of tweaking. First of all it's begging for salt! otherwise It'll be extremely bland and boring. Also added a can of mushrooms and a bit of white wine (in less than 5 min it's evaporated). 
Omitted the orange juice. We didn't care for the sauce anyways, but i think the overall result was ok. Next time i'll try another sauce, keeping the same filling.  :)

I loved this recipe and so did my family! Wonderful flavors! I actually changed a few things though... I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and I added feta cheese to the mixture (at the same time the breadcrumbs were added). I didn't realize that someone drank the last of the OJ before I starting cooking but I substituted it with the only other juice I had in the house: Mango!  It was actually wonderful and I think it was more tasty than the OJ would have been!!  I also used corriander instead of cumin.  Although it takes a long time to cook this meal it is well worth the wait.  OH and while I was waiting for it to cook I took the opportunity and made a wonderful risotto during the last 50 mintues that the pork was cooking!  Great side dish with this meal!!

I've made this recipe several times to rave reviews including once for a wedding reception where it was a highlight @ the buffet table. Thoe only change I would make would be to cook it less (1 1/2 hours was quite enough), depending on your oven.....check it periodically.
Bon Apetit!

Ok. a good place to start from.  Needs more flavor.  I used a 1 3/4 lb pork loin and scaled down everything to match.  Baked for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Juicy and tender.  Just needs a kick.

I have made this several times now for family suppers, as well as, entertaining.  I do double or triple the amount of sauce because we love it.  Every time I make it, I get rave reviews.  This is a keeper, and it's so easy.

DELICIOUS!!!!!  I used pork chops, and put one on top of the other, with the stuffing inside, like a sandwich.  I didn't have any cumin, so I put a little seasoning salt and garlic powder on each pork chop.  My husband was licking the fork and knife.  Will definately make this again and again.

This was good. I ended up with more of the spinach mixture than I needed, so I baked the extra around the roast. Turned out well, but next time I will not add the extra filling until about half an hour before the roast is gone. Served it with creamed peas and potatoes. Made a hearty meal.

I made this. It’s amazing! However, I tweaked it a little. I used a hot pepper Jam on the pork before stuffing. For the stuffing I sautéed onion, garlic and fresh chopped spinach. I made stove top stuffing. I mixed spinach with the stuffing then added some cheddar cheese. I spread the stuffing mixture on the loin then rolled it up. Before putting it in the oven I sprinkled some panko crumbs across the top. Baked @. 375 for about an hour( internal temperature 150). This was outstanding!!!!!!!

Stuffed it with cottage cheese bake. It was a warm savory flavor. Very unique. Pork was sliced when I opened it so it looks a bit messy.  very happy with it.

Delicious recipe. I did it the way they suggested as I always do with  first time recipes. Next time, I will cook the pork tender line a little bit less time.  I may even add a little cream cheese to the spinach, but it’s not necessary. It would just be a bit creamier. Thank you for the recipe.

First time making this and it was delicious! I paired it with a butternut squash, that I cut into cubes, mixed with olive oil, garlic powder, sea salt and pepper. Recipe was easy to follow, will definitely be making this again.

Made it with fresh spinach and tried to make it using gluten-free breadcrumbs. The stuffing, while tasty, was a soggy mess. I think I needed to drain the spinach more after sauteeing and I would not use gluten-free breadcrumbs again. Or any breadcrumbs. Some spinach and cheese would have been just fine by me! The marinade for the pork was a big hit though. Cooking time posted here would have been way too long. We only cooked it for about an hour total. I put the foil on after 35 minutes and took it out at an hour.

Yummm!!!  Yes, I did make a couple of changes,  after I made it the first time, which was delicious as it was written. The second time I also added prosciutto and Swiss cheese slices, then wrapped the whole thing with thick bacon slices.  After I sliced the pork loin roast nearly in half, I layered 3 slices of prosciutto, then two slices of Swiss cheese, on both halves.  Next I held the two sides, while I stuffed the fresh spinach mixture in, then I used Baker's twine to hold it all together.  The next step was to wrap the whole roast with thick slices of smoked bacon.  I placed the roast uncovered, in 400* oven for 60 minutes, then I lowered the temp to 350* for about 30 minutes, more or less, depending on the size of your roast, until the internal temp is 145*.  I peeled off the bacon for the last 15 or so minutes and left it laying in the pan. It helped to make some great chunky and flavorful sauce. I will use this recipe on the beef roast next!

Since I had no teriyaki sauce used soy sauce.  Other then that followed the directions.  It does cook faster as other reviews indicated.  Definitely will make again.

Pork tenderloins are skinny little things.  A pork loin  is less expensive and almost certain to never dry out.  Everything else is good.

I butterflied the tenderloin and pounded it out with a mallet to thin it out for quicker cooking.  I then salted and peppered the inside before glazing it with the sauce and then layered some mozzarella and prosciutto  followed by the spinach  filling and simply folded it over.  I salted and peppered the outside along with rubbing some olive oil into the meat and added some white wine and worcestershire sauce to the glaze and basted it several times during roasting. I baked it for a total of 50 minutes and left it to rest on counter for nearly 15 minutes before serving.  It was so juicy and flavorful. I served it with steamed broccoli and garlic roasted fingerling potatoes.  What an awesome dish.  The one thing I didn't care for was the cumin.  I will definitely make this again but the additional spice isnt really needed if you salt and pepper well and use plenty of glaze.

I (and the hubs) loved my version thanks to the base recipe and others' recommendations. I used fresh spinach, extra garlic (4 cloves) and I substituted stovetop stuffing for the bread crumbs, but used all the butter suggested. I ditched the ketchup-teriyaki sauce, and instead, sprinkled pepper, salt, savory, garlic powder, cumin, and olive oil on top. That add a nice crunch texture to the top layer. I cooked for about an hour at 350 and double checked with the thermometer to make sure it was all set.

This recipe was delicious and easy to make.  I added gouda cheese to the recipe and it was just moist and tasty.  I most admit I was unable to make the sauce as I ran out of time but I will definitely make it again.

This was the juiciest pork loin roast I have ever made!! The only alteration I did was to use the whole 10 oz. of frozen chopped spinach. I cooked the roast for 2 hours, without covering it at all, and it was fabulous! It may have helped that I thawed the spinach but did not squeeze excess liquid out before adding it to the other ingredients...I will make sure to do it exactly the same way the next time I make it!!

Yum, yum, yum.  That's all I can say about this recipe.  The only tweaking I did was use 3 garlic buds, doubled the sauce recipe (didn't have ketchup, so used Heinz chili sauce), added feta to the stuffing, and used Panko bread crumbs.  Also had some of the bread/onion/garlic left over in the frying pan, so topped the tenderloin with it before putting in the oven.  Definitely do not cook for suggested time - I cooked for just over an hour (read 145 on thermometer), and tented while I made the side dish.  Hubby thought it was one of the best meals I have ever made, which says a lot, since he loves my cooking.

This was fantastic! I made the following adjustments -- doubled the garlic, added a sauteed red pepper, substituted crushed crackers (Kirkland signature ancient grains) for the bread crumbs for more flavour and added a cup of shredded asiago cheese. IMO the addition of cheese really makes this recipe. Finally - and this is VERY important - if you're using pork tenderloin (as opposed to pork loin) it only needs to cook 40 mins. I marinated after the first 20 mins and cooked it uncovered. Highly recommend this recipe!

I love this recipe and have made it many times. Instead of just cutting the tenderloin in half to split it, I carefully cut the roll open by cutting on an angle and rolling the meat as I go so it ends up like an open jelly roll (does that make sense?). I add feta cheese to the spinach mixture and after adding the stuffing I roll it up like a jelly roll and tie with butcher's string. Such a beautiful presentation!

This was very good, with having read other suggestions and implementing them into the recipe.  I added sliced swiss cheese to the filling, as well as sliced proscuitto.  INCREDIBLE!!  I don't know as if the marinade really gave it any flavor at all, so I'll be experimenting with that next.

I thought this was a pretty good pork tenderloin recipe, but hubs wasn't happy--apparently I used too much onion--I think that was his only complaint.  I guess I'll cut that down for him next time, but I enjoyed the flavors.  Instead of basting, I just marinated in the sauce.  I don't have OJ right now and hubs hates fruit and citrus combos, so I just used a small bit of lemon juice to add some acidity and left the rest alone.  Yes, the bake time is a tad long depending on the size of your meat, so you may want to check it after the hour mark.  Mine took about 1 hr and 15 minutes to cook through.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS!  Unlike some reviewers, I think the sauce is great with this.  I do substitute fresh spinach instead of frozen spinach.  I  also have added mushrooms on occasion (canned or fresh, whatever I have on hand).  It always turns out great.  I generally only use a 1.5 lb tenderloin, so the cooking time is closer to an hour vs. 2 hours.  This dish has become a regular in our house.

Everyone loved this. I did change it from stuffed pork loin to stuffed pork chops. The sauce was great!

This was the best pork recipe I have ever tasted! Normally my pork leftovers sit in the fridge and don't get eaten but my husband and I ate this for lunch and dinner it was so good! I halved the recipe because that was how much pork I had and used a meat thermometer to tell if it was done. I didn't feel like chopping an onion so I used a dash of onion flakes instead and it worked! I didn't use the kitchen twine because I didn't have it and found out it's not necessary. I covered the pork in the gravy I used for the mashed potatoes (one can of chicken broth stirred and simmered with one can of cream of chicken soup) and it was spectactular! We will definitely be making this again. You feel like you're eating at a nice restaurant!

I d-e-s-p-i-s-e-d this recipe. The spinach was a  mess of goo. It was mushy. I dont think the pork needed to cook that long, I had to take mine out way early because it was drying out. I followed the recipe to the dot and it was extremely disapointing. I will NEVER try it again.

After I read other reviews, I still thought that we would like the sauce b/c we love sauces on everything.  The sauce for this is just odd. I love teriyaki sauce but this is just not a tasty combo w/ the ketchup.  If you try it, I certainly would use plain breadcrumbs.  I used seasoned and it was just too many flavors going on.

Really great!  I too doubled the sauce...and added some chopped red cabbage to the spinach stuffing.  Everyone raved about it...and it filled the house with an amazing aroma!  Definitely adding it to my favorites :)

Very tasty, with the recommendations made by other reviewers. I used boneless pork loin, which I tenderized with a mallet. In the stuffing, I added sliced mushrooms and used three cloves of garlic. I also added shredded mozzarella cheese when assembling. Tasted great! Cooked to internal temp of 160, which took less than an hour... was still moist.

I used the added ingredients of the following review and it was much better than the original recipe.  "Reviewed on Feb. 11, 2005 by STEVE1971" He added prosiutto and mozzarella.

I really thought I was going to love this.  The pork was very juicy and tender, but I simply didn't like the flavor.  I think the ketchup brought a vinegar taste to it I didn't like with the orange juice (I don't care for ribs cooked with vinegar, so I should have realized this).  I also found the stuffing was very bland.  I gave it two stars because I wouldn't make it again as written, I'd have to tweak it a lot.

I can only rate the stuffing on this recipe because the sauce part did not appeal to me. This was good and it went very well with the pork. Thanks!

This had a very nice flavor (even though I forgot the cumin). My family ate it all. Next time, I'll take the advice of other reviewers and double the sauce. Thank you!

I tried this at work for a Sunday Brunch item and it was great! Everyone loved it and it was very moist and tasty. I did make more of the sauce and added a few more herbs to the stuffing.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  The stuffing was pretty good but it didn't go well with the glaze/sauce.  I think the glaze would be good without the stuffing and visa versa but definitely not together.

I thought this recipe was very tasty.  Surprisingly, the kids liked it.  
The aroma while it was baking was also very nice.  
The taste is extremely similar to pork chops with Stove Top stuffing, so
I would recommend to save some time and money, make porkchops, 
use the sweet sauce for a baste, and mix up a box of your favorite stuffing.
You will get the same taste, for half the cost, and half the time. I was a little disappointed
with this recipe, which is why it received only an average rating.

Yummy!! This was so easy to make and tasted so good.  It did fill the house with a wonderful aroma.  I didn't give it to my 4 year old because "meat" is not his favorite thing to eat, but it had a mild flavor, and I'll definitely have him try it next time.  We'll be making this again!

My mom gave me some pork tenderlion and I decided to do some searching of recipes on Allrecipes.com. I have to say it was very easy to make. The aroma was great making my house smell so good and making me and my girlfriend very hungry also. A++++ Recipe
