Added some lobster at the end and put it over homemade crab ravioli. An amazingly simple and decadent sauce and the whole family raved!

Fantastic!  Simple and delicious.  I've made the sauce a couple of times and it was a100% hit each time.  I like a tangy flavor so I added some capers and fresh lemon zest.  Those made great additions too.  This is a winner!

The addition of cream helps stabilize the sauce, but it also makes this extremely rich. That might be desirable for a special occasion serving something indulgent but not too fatty itself (lobster or tuna maybe). However, for most purposes I'd prefer a classic beurre blanc without the cream.  It was good but slightly too much for weeknight salmon and green beans, hah. 

Also, choose your wine wisely. Be sure to use something very dry. I used some leftover pinot grigio and the finished sauce was a bit too sweet.

I made this with lemon juice, using regular whipping cream because that’s what I had.  It was great. I think the heavy cream would have been slightly better but it was still beautifully elegant and delicious.  I served it with chicken made in a traditional Wiener schnitzel style.  We could have licked the plate.

I watched the video (which was very helpful) and followed the recipe to a "T".  I placed the sauce over haddock and it was  delicious!I The second time I made it, I added a clove of garlic to the mix (preference only) and really enjoyed it. 

I was not sure if I would like the cayenne pepper but it really brought everything together.

I have a small "Little Dipper" Crock Pot that I use for keeping sauces warm so after I made this, I added it to the Crock Pot and the sauce remained nice and warm over dinner.

Thank you Chef John!

I did it with a pan fried breaded chicken. I added tomatoes, artichokes and asparagus to the sauce at the end of simmering and served the chicken and sauce with pasta. Amazing!

This was a hit!  Added the sauce to grilled salmon served with rice pilaf and asparagus.  It added so much flavor to the salmon.  The recipe was perfect as is.  Very creamy and “critusy”.  Looking forward to more recipes, Chef John!!

I made this to put on grilled salmon and halibut for a Father's Day dinner. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I think I didn't reduce the original liquid quite enough. That's my fault of course, not the recipe's. It turned out very good anyway; my wife called it "elegant". I used Pinot Grigio wine and lemon juice with just a touch of white wine vinegar. I didn't have any fresh herbs so I used dried dill and it worked just fine.

Super easy and the directions were clear and easy to understand. If I make it again, I will probably use a bit less lemon juice or maybe try for a sweeter wine. It was a tiny bit too acidic for my taste. I also may have used a bit more than the recipe called for, not sure.

Made this according to the recipe and it really is delicious. Like another reviewer, we had trouble getting it to reduce but it really didn't matter as it still was great. Be ready that it is quite lemony so if you prefer less lemon, you could cut that down. I'll make it again and maybe add some capers.

So help me out here...I made it and it was beautiful and perfect. I made it slightly before my halibut was done and kept it warm to serve when the fish was done. Unfortunately something g went terribly wrong. All of a sudden it completely de-emulsified (if that’s even a word). I was so excited because it was perfect and then it fell apart!

I add about 3T+ (we like spicy) of wasabi and serve it over furikake crusted fish (opah, Mahi mahi, or ahi)  with rice and a quick pickle. Absolutely delicious! Thanks Chef John, we use many of your recipes as inspiration.

I was trying to figure out the "real food" version of the garlic butter dip from Sbarro's.  This comes darn close, and is probably what they were aiming for!

This is a wonderful delicate sauce - great for seafood an gnocchi. However, if you want a large amount, at a minimum, double the recipe.

This sauce is fabulous!  We used it on fresh grilled redfish that my husband caught the day before.  The sauce was the perfect compliment to the redfish.  It was divine!

I had a lot of trouble reducing this sauce, so eventually I just served it as it was.  

This is chiefly a lemony sauce that has a nice white wine flavor as well.  Definitely buttery, too, but not as buttery as you'd think from stirring in that entire stick of butter.  

Served on top of pan-seared  tilapia and couscous.
