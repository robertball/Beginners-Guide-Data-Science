I added an extra cup of coconut for these and used butter instead of margarine... Turned out just like Mom's! Without the extra coconut these would have been too runny, I think.

Also, a tip... It's VITAL that you let the butter, sugar & coconut cook together until totally smooth. If you rush it, your cookies will turn out grainy & crumbly. They need cook cook together at a BOIL for at least 2 min. You'll know its ready when the mixture is completely, silky smooth. Also-- stir constantly. The sugar will burn if you stop stirring while cooking, giving your cookies a burnt, icky taste. DON'T STOP STIRRING!

I've been making these for years and they are delish! My family's favorite variation that I make quite often is I add 1 cup peanut butter to the butter/sugar mixture in the saucepan. Either way these are excellent, chewy and chocolately, definitely need to be kept cold to keep them from getting too soft. I love them right out of the freezer! Give this recipe a try, you'll be glad you did!

I don't understand how people can have such different results from the same recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and even went back and checked proportions and directions. These turned out extremely dry for me, and I had a hard time getting them to hold their shape without crumbling and falling apart. I like that they don't have peanut butter and do have coconut. I just think the proportions of liquid to dry ingredients is wrong somehow.

I have been making these cookies for decades. After reading comments I just want to add that the boiling time is key to these. If you don't boil it long enough they are gooey and/or grainy and if too long, they are dry and crumbly. Practice makes perfect :)

I have the exact same recipe (amounts and product) at home; only difference is that you should boil the milk/butter/sugar mixture (I add the cocoa after, but that's preference and I use butter instead of margarine) for 4-5 minutes.  You need to move SUPER quickly when dropping these on wax paper, as the mixture will harden quickly once the oats/coconut (and chocolate, in my case) are added.  I don't find them gooey at all, and have been making this recipe this way for years (it was my grandmother's recipe).  Give it a try, they are soooo good!

These taste GREAT.. I especially like that they don't have peanut butter and I LOOOOVE the coconut.  But they came out a tad bit too gooey. You almost have to keep them in the freezer to eat them.  I think maybe if you throw in a handful of chocolate chips or maybe some almond bark,  and melt with the butter mixture that these cookies would be more firm when they cooled! Will definitely try that next time I make these!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe today and I am eating a cookie as I write this review.  I made 3 tiny changes only and the end result is excellent.  I used unsalted butter instead of margarine. I added about a 1/4 tsp of salt and 1 tbsp. of golden syrup as I read another recipe that proclaimed golden syrup was the secret ingredient for this type of cookie.  The reviews liked the golden syrup. These cookies formed well and after being left to cool and harden they are NOT gooey or sticky, they are perfect so this will now be my keeper recipe.

I added 2 cups coconut and 1/2 cup peanut butter. The trick to knowing when the boiling is done is the way my Momma used to do it. Take a glass of cold tap water And after a couple of minutes boiling use the spoon and let a drop of the sauce fall to the bottom of the glass. If it looks like a tadpole it is called a soft boil and it is ready. Too early and it will splatter. Perfect cookies using that method. Also I never go above medium heat. Patience  will make them perfect. Oh yes...and I always add 1Tsp of Vanilla!!!

I used coconut oil instead of margarine. They came out great! 
Next time I make them, I'll choose another sweetener rather than refined sugar.

Craving killer! Great variation of my mom's recipe. I used this as a base recipe and heeded previous reviews. Having only two to cook for, I halved the recipe- I know these cookies tend to dry out, so I didn't want a ton of leftovers. I also halved the sugar as I know too much sugar in these cookies makes a grainy texture horrible for us with sensitive teeth. I added the peanut butter as recommended and doubled the ( sweetened) coconut flakes. I threw in a dash of vanilla flavor. THEY ARE DELICIOUS! Albeit, I believe with the addition of Craisins  or another dried fruit, they would go from craving killer to party sensation. This recipe has a great process, which is why I will recommend to everyone! Thank you!

Delicious and super easy.  My mother used to make these with peanut butter instead of the coconut but these are nice for my nut-allergic son.  I used 1 1/2 c of sugar instead of 2c and they were still plenty sweet.

I must say that I didn't follow the recipe 100% - I used butter instead of margarine and I added about 100g dark chocolate to the butter/sugar/cocoa mixture. I also added about a 1/2tsp salt. They were great. They hardened very well and the taste was excellent. I made two double batches as I will be serving them at my wedding:)

Very good and simple! They reminded me of almond joys so after I spooned them on the wax paper and they were still soft I sprinkled them with a little extra coconut nut and pressed an almond on the top. Mmm.

I made these (slightly different) as a kid with my mother and I have been making them with my kids for years! They are simple and delicious!
To the reviewer, Paula, make sure they are quick cook oats. Robin hood oats seem to work best in our house. If you use the wrong oats, or not enough,(I use 4 cups) they do not harden properly. But even the mushy, crumbly leftovers are a great bribe to convince little people to help with everything including the clean up.

This recipe works although I cut the sugar in half and added a teaspoon of Vanilla and a tablespoon of maple syrup and boil it for about 3-4 minutes.  I use regular large flake Oats and a bit more coconut and put it into the pan with the boiling liquid and mix it very thoroughly pressing the oatmeal down as I mix to force the liquid into the oats.  I then take out large spoonfuls and press it together with my fingers so it is not loose and place it on the baking pan.  This makes about 36 cookies.  They dry out over the next 12 hours or so and you get a nice cookie that doesn't fall apart and is a bit crispy without being too chewy.  Just leave them in a cookie tin and they last for a long time if nobody knows where they are!

Children at my daycare had fun making this. One girl loves them but my son didn't care for them. So far I haven't had luck with them hardening even after they were cold. I have put the cookie sheet with the cookies on it in the freezer and hoping they harden that way. These are definitely not healthy and much too sweet for my liking but the children enjoyed them as a treat!

Could not have been any easier to make! A friend is gluten free and I'm bringing these cookies (along with a side of strawberries) to her house for dessert. Can't wait for her to try them! Plus, the no bake feature is great for hot summer days. Will be making these again SOON!

These are so great to make when it's too hot to turn on the oven!  I too usually add a generous scoop of peanut butter after the boiling step, and sometimes an extra 1/2 cup of coconut.
These never last long at our house.

Omg!!I think there is a law somewhere against things like these.so yummy. I did add an extra cup of coconut and a cup of peanut butter to the liquid mixture. I had no problems with them setting up. I started timing the two minute's one's the mixture came to a rolling boil . I used a ice cream scoop and flattened them a little. This gave me 36 good size beyond yummy cookies. Thank you so much

I just made these and they came out amazing! I only have unsalted butter on hand, so I used that instead of margarine. I also cut the Sugar by half a cup because I don't have that much of a sweet tooth. They are plenty sweet for me! I didn't read other reviews about the boiling time, but I cooked mine on a medium heat until it was runny and it seemed that the sugar had fully dissolved. I also used Quick cook oats like the recipe specifies. Mine are not grainy nor are they crumbly; they are perfect! I want to try making these again with coconut oil instead of margarine to see if that will help with the hardening process. I had to set mine in the freezer for about 20 minutes before they were firm and would stay together.

Boiling for the exact amount of time is key.  Also, I'd like to add that as a kid, my Mom made these all the time...perfect texture....but it took me a few tries to get it right, but was worth it.  DOES ANYONE HAVE THE RECIPE FOR THE 'MAPLE' VERSION OF THESE NO-BAKE MACAROONS...I've lost mine :(

These were super delicious even though they came out slightly crumbly. I melted all the stuff until it was smooth, which took about 4-5 minutes. Then I let it boil for 3-4 minutes, which was where I went wrong I think. I should have boiled it for only around 2 minutes. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

Needed to add another cup of oats. Other than that, the recipe is great. Hubby loves 'em!

This is my all time favorite recipe, BUT you have to be careful to not overcook the sauce.  If you do the cookies will crumble.

Just like Mom used to make! My husband suggested adding Rice Krispies. So I'm thinking I'll reduce the oats to 1 cup and add 1 cup of Rice Krispies.

I prefer the traditional no bake recipe - too gooey chewy... Like glue. Not a cookie at all. Also too much cocoa. Needs an egg and sugar at first maybe

I added a tsp of almond extract after I took the mixture off boiling, and pressed an almond slice in the top when they were formed. They looked fancier than a regular no bake and tasted great. Very quick and nice for a last minute party treat.

In my family we call these gobbles. I don’t know why. They always have been super famous with the fam and never last long enough to make any to the freezer so maybe because they get “gobbled up”.
My moms recipe book got destroyed and we have never been able to find the recipe for gobbles until now! You made our Christmas!

Made these for Thanksgiving.  I added a little pumpkin for decor.  Tweaked the recipe just a little to make them vegan for my son ??. Used coconut milk and coconut oil. Thank you so much this wonderful recipe.  Grateful and blessed.

I changed the recipe as follows:

1 c white sugar
1 c brown sugar
1/2t vanilla
dash salt
1 c dried cranberries (in with dry ingredients)

Next time I am going to try adding pecans and dried pineapple (instead of dried cranberries).

Added half a cup or so of coconut but didn’t change anything else & they’re great - the only tip I have is to make sure you don’t stop stirring the chocolate while it boils for the full 2 minutes & they’re perfect

My family has had this recipe foreva.  The key is the amt of boiling time, if u boiled too long its dry and crumbly; if not long enuff it wont hold a shape.  Our family also adds nuts to this recipe.  I agree I only use butter.

I followed others' advice and doubled the amount of coconut and used butter.  I also used minced coconut because that's what I had and that worked really well.  Served them to friends today and got many compliments.

Good but not quite my mom's recipe. I substituted the milk for almond milk due to dairy allergies and added 1/2 cup of coconut after stirring as it was still runny. I also added a 1/2 tsp or so of vanilla. Overall very good.

Love this recipe!  I cut the sugar in half (1 cup instead of 2) and it is plenty sweet.  I will probably use even less next time.  Also used my homemade butter instead of margarine.  Yum!

I made this as specified, except I used butter instead of margarine.  So far, I've only tried six cookies in the last hour, so it's hard to be COMPLETELY sure, but I'd say these are very, very good. I think I would cut the oats by 1/2 cup the next time around and double the coconut, though. These have an addictive, chocolatey, caramel-like bite.  Yum!

Tugged at my childhood memories,  so I just had to make them.  My middle-aged kids happened to be coming here... they were a hit!!  Brought back all their childhood memories and their spouses were introduced to them .  I used steel cut oats....had no problem  I let the syrup boil for 4ish minutes and they were perfection!! 
On the make list for my friends Xmas goodie platters.

This is the exact recipe that I would make wig my great-grandmother. Perfectly easy and a great start to teaching a child to bake.

I followed the recipe but I used Brown sugar instead of white and the cookies were amazing! They were chewy and delicious!
This one will be written down in my old fashioned cook book!

These are okay. They turned out, but I think I would like them better with less cocoa and a bit less oats. This isn't the recipe that I remember from when I was young, the chocolate flavor is a bit too intense, so much so that I can barely taste the coconut. It's a good recipe, but not exactly what I was looking for.

I read the reviews first and used 2 cups of coconut instead of 1.  Also I never use margarine, just real butter.  2 cups of sugar sounded like a lot to me, so I used 1-1/2.  It made about 32 cookies.  SO EASY and delicious!  My husband loves the chocolate and coconut combo  and thought  they were excellent.  I'm thinking about doing these for a Christmas cookie swap but not sure if they store well.

Yum!! I love these but I made some substitutions. First I used very fine cane sugar and I only used half that the recipe called for. Next I substituted coconut milk for regular milk for both thickness & taste. I used unsweetened coconut flakes. I didn't heat the milk. I did melt the butter then mixed everything into one bowl. So yummy!!!

Super easy. I used butter instead of margarine. They turned out great. I put them on lined cookie sheets, then stuck them in the fridge to harden quicker.

Yes, I've loved this recipe since childhood. I've tweaked it. Using the following: 2 c. quick oats + 1 c. cold milled flax seed, 1 1/2 c. white sugar (reduced), 1 1/2c long coconut (increased), 1/2c. cocoa, 1/c. butter, 1 1/4c. milk (increased/I used almond milk). I followed the same directions. The cookie is still very sweet, possibly tasting slightly more dark chocolate flavour. Delicious results.

I have been searching for this recipe, loved it.  I did add a 1/4 t of vanilla and 2T of peanut butter.  Boiled as suggested for 3-4 min.
