Nice recipe and easy.  I used my food processor attachment to slice the onions, squash (I used zucchini), and potatoes so they were thinner than the tomato slices.  I also added 3/4 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese and sprinkled Italian seasoning between layers.  I did not salt each layer.  Cooked in an hour but I had to put foil over the top to not burn the onions half way through the cook time.  I will definitely make again with the above changes.

I know this is a vegetarian dish, but DH doesn't do vegetarian so I browned a pound of ground turkey and layered it in with the other ingredients.  Also added dried oregano with the salt and pepper.  Very good one dish meal.

This was a great recipe.  My wife and I really enjoyed it.  I made a couple of changes.  I added fresh sweet banana pepper rings from my garden and I added a sprinkling of parmesan cheese between layers.  Absolutely delicious!

Really good quick recipe, that can be tweaked to suit the veggies you have in the house and your taste. Some adjustments I made:
- I replaced the summer squash with butternut, which I peeled and cut into very thin slices.
- I sprinkled some paprika and turmeric between each layer of veggies. Tastes great with curry powder too, or whatever other spices you like.
- I added some cloves of garlic, cut into ¼ inch slices, under the top layer of veggies
- If you want the dish to cook in about 25 minutes, slice the potatoes and veggies really thin (less than ¼ inch thick), pour about ½ cup of broth into the pan, and cover the pan loosely with foil before putting it into the oven.
- I found the butter really didn't add much to the recipe, so if you want it to be vegan (or just a lower fat option), cut out the butter and pour a bit of veggie broth over the veggies before baking.
- I sprinkled a mix of breadcrumbs and spices on top right before putting the dish into the oven. This gave the dish a really nice texture and taste. Make your breadcrumb mix with any spices you like! I used salt, pepper, turmeric and paprika.
