I love this soup and usually kick up the spice a bit by adding at least 1/2 to 1 tsp of the red pepper flakes.  
You can adjust the pepper flakes to your desired spice level.

I didn't have a turnip but otherwise made as written. It's a combination of vegetables I haven't seen together before, and they mesh well. I enjoy the way the peanut butter thickens the liquid a little bit. I prefer things a bit spicier, so I served mine with hot sauce added at the table. I am tempted to try it in the slow cooker, as it did take a bit long for a weeknight dinner.

I made this a couple nights ago, and have been eating it for lunch and dinner since! It's a wonderful, hearty soup - enough for a full meal. 

I didn't use the carrot (no good ones at the store) or the okra (not a fan). But, I didn't change anything else. The peanut butter gives the soup fantastic flavor, and I love being able to use some of my turnips in it! 

Since I like things spicy, next time I may add a fresh, diced jalapeno. But, the recipe needs no alterations as it is. I'll definitely be making it Again. Thanks, Mary, for sharing it!

My curiosity lead me to whip this Zimbabwean soup & glad it did. Loved it, can't describe the taste but it was amazingly different from the norm.

This is an awesome as well as healthy recipe. Will make again and again. As with other reviewers, the lack of spices demanded tweaking. I tripled the red pepper, added cumin and parsley (or oregano) and doubled the chicken for a higher protein content. The sweet potatoes made me itch, so the next time I simply substituted butternut squash.

It turned out good.  Our recipe was very thick and we ended up using more vegetable stock than called for in the recipe.  We omitted the red pepper flakes because it would've been too much for our children.  I used leeks instead of onions because I like leeks better for soups.  The flavor of the soup was good and worked great for our South African dinner theme for the evening.  I loved the assortment of vegetables in the soup.

this was not pleasant!  yikes!  I could barely eat this, and just forced myself to do so.  I don't know what everyone is talking about--the peanut butter flavor was completely obvious.  My husband who had no idea of what was in it, was able to call it out immediately.  Don't try the peanut butter soup unless you LOVE peanut butter!!  (liking peanut butter is not enough to enjoy this!)

Very, very good.  It doesn't even taste like peanut butter is in the soup, but you know that there is some sort of nice seasoning in it.  There were literally NO leftovers and we are all picky eaters.

I love trying new recipes that have unique ingredient combinations. I love it even more when it exceeds all expectations.  The peanut butter blends very well with the vegetable broth giving it an added depth of flavor that warms the soul.  I didn’t have a turnip, so I added a potato.  I also tossed in a partially opened can of Rotel tomatoes, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe.  This recipe is a keeper!!

This soup is delicious, hearty, and healthy.  The peanut butter is not overpowering at all, but just a light flavor that adds so much.  I did feel it needed a touch of something, so I did increase the pepper flakes, added a couple cloves of garlic, and about a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  It smelled amazing on the stove and this was a very good soup for a chilly fall night.

I thought this was excellent.  I will say that it is probably a taste that would only appeal to  some people. I lived in West Africa for two years and am used to eating this sort of thing.  I am not a fan of okra or turnips, so I left them out and doubled the cabbage and sweet potato.  Next time I think I'll stick with the one cup of sweet potato and do three cups of cabbage.

A very simple, earthy dish. I loved the fact that it had no added salt but it still had LOTS of flavour! The peanut butter I used was natural peanut butter, with no added ingredients, like salt and sugar. I could smell the peanut butter while it was cooking, but nobody could tell me that it was there. So, to me it definitely was not overpowering, as some said. Maybe because it was the natural peanut butter.  The vegetable broth was salt/sodium free, and I used 1.5 litres. I did not have any okra, and I've never had it, (I don't think), but it tasted great anyway! I like to taste FOOD sometimes, not just spice and sauces. I did put about 6-10 red pepper flakes. Not having any canned tomatoes, my husband diced up 2 tomatoes, and pureed a dozen or so cherry tomatoes. Didn't measure the amount of vegetables, but I know it was more than what was listed. I will definitely make it again!!

This was a fantastic combination of flavors!  I came across it when I was searching how to use a turnip from my garden.  I omitted the onion since I don't like them, and doubled the red pepper flakes.   We both thought this was fantastic and I will make again exactly the same way!  It has a nice root vegetable flavor, but with an Indian or Thai tasting twist.

We love this soup. I make it at least once a month when I want to use up leftover rotisserie chicken. (I was sooo tired of Chicken Noodle!) The flavors are great and with all the veggies, it's really healthy too. PS. I always omit the okra because we don't like it. Sometimes I've omitted the cabbage or turnips when I don't have any on hand.

This was very tasty and savory!  You can make it a lot quicker by adding pre-cooked sweet potato and/or carrots at the end.

I did make a couple changes--I didn't have any turnip in the house so I threw in some frozen root veggie mix from costco which was purple carrot,golden beet,parsnip,sweet potato.
Also, at the end of the cooking time when you are supposed to add okra, I added kale in stead! Otherwise I did it as the recipe said--SO Yummy!

This is the best soup I have ever had! I made this while friends from Baltimore were visiting (I'm from Canada) and it was delicious. 

I have diet restrictions and so I had to substitute cabbage for spinach and chicken for tofu, also, we don't really have okra here so I used green beans. The end result was amazing. 

Thank you for this recipe! I'm surely going to make it again and again!

Overall I really like this recipe! Picky eater husband is not a huge fan, but I already made another batch to pick at for lunch this week. As advised, I made some minor modifications. I doubled the chicken, skipped the okra (couldn’t find it in the supermarket), added more red pepper flakes, some crushed garlic, and salt. I also used unsalted chicken stock because it’s what I had on hand. Served with a warm baguette. Might try to make ahead and freeze for a hearty treat on lazy cooking days.

Made for a dinner party and all loved it! Made without any red pepper flakes since some do not like spicy food. It had enough flavor from the other ingredients though if you like some heat/spice it may be too mild without the flakes. We will be eating again soon!

I followed the recipe except didn't measure out the amounts of veggies that I put in the pot. I may have used too many because I found it a bit bland. No one could tell that it contained peanut butter, which did add a nice creaminess to the broth. If I make it again, I'll add more seasonings and peanut butter.

Slight changes but didn’t really need to. I was gleaning from other reviews. I also did not put in okra....added a 1/8 tsp cumin and parsley and 3/4 cup of peanut butter as I was cooking for 8.
Lovely and creamy will make again

For dinner tonight, I sauteed an onion, sliced up some carrots, and defrosted a bag of cooked, shredded chicken ... only to discover that my refrigerated Indian simmering sauce was spoiled. Ack! I typed these four ingredients into the Allrecipes Ingredients Search and discovered Zimbabwean Chicken and Vegetable Soup! I had everything on hand (except for okra, which we don't eat). I made the soup exactly as directed, but instead of okra, I added a packed cup of spinach leaves during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Yum! It came out super thick, like a stew, but that could be because I added 3 cups of chicken. Also, the recipe didn't say to cover the soup during simmering. Doing so might have prevented some of the liquid from boiling off. It didn't matter--we loved it anyway. It had just the right amount of spice, but we could have upped the red pepper flakes for a bit more heat. I also added about 1/2 tsp. salt. My husband couldn't tell there was peanut butter in the soup. It added a richness and creaminess that was very satisfying. I don't think it needs any other spices, but oregano and cumin would probably be nice options, as others have suggested. I'd already cooked a pot of rice for my failed Indian meal, so we ladled the soup over scoops of rice for added heartiness. I may have found this recipe by accident, but it's definitely going into my soup rotation!

This was great! I did everything as written, only I added a bit more red pepper and omitted the okra because we dont like it. It also definitely needs salt! I needed to cook it longer as well because the vegetables were way too hard.

Delicious! I made for my book club after reading the the book The Elephant Whisperer by Lawrence Anthony. Served it over brown rice as a hearty main dish. An apertif of Elephant wash water or African Amarula liquor and we had a wonderful meal. Followed receipe exactly, but would add more jalapeno next time. My husband wants me to make it again and keep the receipe handy.

My family of 10 enjoyed this very much.  Hubby said he'd order it in a restaurant.  I did make modifications to use ingredients on hand (also it's -60 wind chill right now, so I'm not running to the store).  For veggies I added carrots, sweet potato, and spinach.  Also included a few cloves of garlic with the onion and a splash of soy sauce.  I only had a big can of crushed tomatoes, instead of diced, worked great.  No veg. stock, just used water. Will make again and try to add more original veggies next time. Great, hardy soup, enjoy with loaf of bread.

I subbed in baked tofu marinated in lemon and a spicy rub (instead of chicken) and collard greens (for the okra). I will definitely be making this again and will look for okra in the frozen veggies aisle. I loved every sweet & spicy bite!

An amazing soup.  I plan on making it without chicken for my meatless days, and I bet quinoa would do just fine.  I never would have made a recipe with this particular combination of ingredients and lack of herbs and spices, but the previous reviewers convinced me to try it and I am glad I did.  It will be a regular in my kitchen.
