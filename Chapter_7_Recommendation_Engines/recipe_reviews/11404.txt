Can't even rate this one with a star.
Sounded simple enough.  Too glutenous to form any useable dough.  Waste of money and time.

This is a classic. You can't expect to have a soft dough. These little nuggets want to be baked dry but not brittle. It's the eggy taste that counts. Ginger is the traditional spice, and this hits the right note. A fabulous way to serve, is to pour them out on the oiled baking sheet, and when cool enough to handle, form into a pyramid, and place on a cake stand. Let guests break off bits of these sweet, nutty-crunchy dough balls. I have taught this recipe to my high school students.
