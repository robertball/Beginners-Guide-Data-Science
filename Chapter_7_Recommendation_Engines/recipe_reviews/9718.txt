My grandma makes these all the time. They are the best. The dough supposed to be wet and it kind of looks wrong but thats the way it supposed to be.

I grew up with these cookies at every christmas, they have always been my favorite cookies, ive only just started to bake them myself but they are very easy to make. 

I buy my pine nuts at warehouse stores (like BJ's) and my almond paste from a local bakery together this lowers the price almost in half.

The cookies tasted ok but I had to refrigerate them over night in order to roll them into balls because the dough was to sticky and soft.  I used parchment paper but I still had to use a metal spatula to remove the cookies and sometimes the middle was left on the paper. I drizzled choc. on them to dress them up a bit.  For the money I spent on almond paste and pine nuts, I don't think I would use this recipe again.

I brought these cookies into the office and they were a HUGE hit and several people asked me for the recipe! Great with coffee. (I added one step - I drizzled chocolate over them.)

Do you bake the pine nuts before using them in this recipe? Or does it matter?
