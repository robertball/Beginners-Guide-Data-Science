1.12.19  This comment is in response to Teresa Rojas’ review on 1.11.19.  I’m the submitter of this recipe, I live in Florida which has a large Cuban population and MANY Cuban restaurants.  Although your way may be a “traditional” way, it’s not the only way to prepare Cuban black  beans.  There are many different styles of black beans home cooked in kitchens and restaurants (offering an option of white or yellow rice) throughout Florida as well as the rest of the U.S., and this recipe just incorporates some of those ingredients.  Just “Google” Cuban Black Beans or do a search on Pinterest, and you’ll see what I mean.  And that’s not to say there’s anything wrong with the traditional way, but there’s also nothing wrong with updating a traditional recipe which some call “bland,” to make it more interesting.

Glad to see Cuban black beans becoming mainstream. No lime; cilantro; bacon ; chicken broth; any jalapeño or hot spices in the Cuban black beans my great grandmothers, grandmothers, mother and I make. No garnish either. And never yellow rice. Plain water, Onion, garlic, green bell pepper, oregano, cumin and bay leaf along with cooking wine and olive oil. It’s a simple but delicious dish that tastes better the next day!

I made this in my crock pot instead of an instant pot.  Same recipe, I just cooked it on low all day.  I used a packet of Sazon, like the recipe called for.  The beans were very tasty, but kind of salty.  I would use the sazon recipe from allrecipes.com, but leave out some of the salt next time.

I've made them before and the Goya seasoning is not an optional ingredient, that gives it a wonderful taste.

I used half the beans but kept the other ingredients as the recipe called for because I like flavor! I used extra garlic and cumin for personal tastes. I didn't have sazon  but used Adobo seasoning, I also added 3oz of tomato paste. Turned out wonderful! Will definitely make it this way again!

Very tasty, and smelled heavenly!  One of my favorite local Cuban restaurants offers a scrumptious vaca frita, and I always choose yellow rice and black beans as well as sliced fresh tomatoes as sides.  This recipe made the beans taste very much like those at the restaurant.  I used Sazon for the first time and liked it but found the measure increment in the recipe quite confusing.  The package I purchased has a total weight of 1+ ounces, but there are multiple packets within and the manufacturer recommendation is one packet per four servings. 
This time, the beans accompanied a pork loin and rice; next time perhaps I'll be bold and attempt vaca frita!

I was planning on doubling the recipe so  I doubled the onion and jalapeno and red wine vinegar.  Then I realized my pot would not hold that twice the liquid.  The flavor still turned out awesome.  
They were a little runny so next time I will add another cup of water and chicken broth and an extra pound of beans.  These will definitely be made again and again.
Thank you.

It was fine, not very flavorful, I even added more garlic and other seasonings. I would not make this again.
