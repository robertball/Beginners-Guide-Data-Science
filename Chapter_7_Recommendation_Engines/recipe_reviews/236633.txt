Took these to a party and everyone was raving about them!  I changed the recipe a little as per reviews on another Jalape単o Bacon Deviled Eggs recipe and also the ingredients I had on hand. I doubled the amount of bacon and mixed it all in with the yoke mixture instead of garnishing the tops. Instead of fresh Jalape単o I used 1/3 cup of sliced jalape単os from a jar, diced up pretty small. Since it was recommended on another review, I added a couple tbsps of the bacon grease to the yoke mixture which was FANTASTIC! Also added Sriracha to taste because we like things on the spicier side! Will totally make again for future dinner parties!

I made these for a BBQ. Everyone loved them. I had to add a little more seasoning but they were amazing!

One of the easiest and best tasting Deviled eggs to make. Always get compliments about their taste. I add both cayenne and paprika as well as parsley for taste preference

Exceptionally creamy and a big hit. Added both chopped up red and green Jalape単o peppers to give it a Christmas look. It was a trial run for me but definitely will be repeating it soon!
