In order to duplicate that "restaurant chain"-  make these changes-

Get rid of the garlic from the mix and add 1/4 to 1/3 cup each sauteed, minced red bell pepper and onion.

Bake them in small casseroles, as many as you can fit in there in one layer, and top with scampi sauce (1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup chablis and 3-4 tablespoons garlic powder-I have submitted the recipe) 

5 minutes before it is done, top with shredded white cheddar

that's how they do it!!

Great recipe, I don't know if anyone else does this, but I microwave my mushrooms in paper towel prior to stuffing them.  This rids the shrooms of excess water, thus avoiding a watered down result.

Awesome Recipe!! Took advice of others and did 2 cans of crab instead of the lobster. As I made them, I noticed it was a bit dry then added a tbs of olive oil. Also I used italian crumbs instead and added some extra parsley and mushroom stems of course. Only added cheese as needed, I didnt want too much of a good thing. Still had extra stuffing and froze it for another time or a quick appetizer if company pops in. Definately try this recipe!!!

Very tasty, although I made the following adjustments - omitted the crab and lobster because I didn't have any on hand. Chopped up the stems and cooked in a little olive oil with the garlic. Added some chopped parsley to this. Substituted 1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs for the croutons and used only 2 T of butter (versus the 1/2 cup of butter). Added the cheese then spooned into the mushroom caps. Sprayed the pan with cooking spray instead of brushing with the butter and baked as directed. Less than half the calories but still DIVINE!!! Next time will add the crab and lobster meat for sure.

This a GREAT RECIPE!
The only thing that I will change for the next time is use Italian Bread Crumbs
instead of the crountons, 1 1/2T minced garlic, 2cans of crabmeat (leg meat). and omit the 1/4 cup of mozzarella. add 1/4 cup fresh parsley. then Bake for 20-22 minutes for the large mushrooms. I didn't even miss the lobster, but I'll add that in the next time. This is a 10 star recipe.

I made these for an appetizer Thanksgiving Day and they were a hit--some changes:  2 pounds of mushrooms, 3 cans of crabmeat, 1/2 pound of cooked shrimp, chopped.  Absolutely Awesome!

This was my first attempt at making stuffed, baked mushrooms.  It took me
forever to get them into the oven but 
then I picked my own crab.  I really had no idea as to what the filling should be like.  I thought it needed a
little kick so I added cayenne pepper.
I then decided that tho they seemed a
little dry that with tons of cheese and butter there was no way they could
be.  They were not dry, they were great.  Everyone really liked them. I
did not look over the review first but will in the future.  I hope to try this recipe again soon but with the sauce one of the reviewers put 
over theirs. It sounds yummy!

Wonderful as prepared. Consistency and flavor of crab/lobster would make a good crab cake. Next time, will use portabello mushrooms with olive oil drizzled on caps. Instead of finger food, make them a meal.

Yummy!  I too left out the lobster.  I also sauteed onions and the chopped mushroom stems together and added them to the stuffing.  Will definitely make again!

I've made these twice.. the first time I followed your recipe exactly.  The second time I made some minor changes (2 tsp garlic powder instead of 3 cloves), Monterey Jack instead of mozzerella, parmesan on top instead of mozzerella and I used some leftover homemade croutons that I made the day before out of Italian bread (seasoned with olive oil, oregano, basil & garlic).  I brushed the caps with butter and gave them a bit of a pre-bake in the oven before stuffing to get rid of the excess water - then I stuffed them and baked for the full time at 400 degrees.  They browned nicely, the mushrooms were soft and flavorful.  I also didn't want to spend $$ on the lobster, so I bought a pound of lumpmeat crab from Costco.. great bargain and so good.    No matter what you do and how you personally like it, this recipe doesn't really taste like R.L. or your above-mentioned restaurant.. they taste better!  Good job and thanks for sharing.

although i have not tried this particular rendition, i have made my mushrooms very similar....but....i would never throw away those stem pieces!  chop them along with the onion & garlic  and saute them all first in the butter before adding it to the bread.  that alone will give then mushrooms more moisture.  also, throw a small pieces of bacon on the top of each one...yum!!

WAAAY too much butter. I don't understand putting a 1/4 c. of butter on the sheet to begin with. I sprayed a piece of foil with cooking spray. (Foil is your friend) Sauteed onion, garlic and stems in a bit of butter then added Italian bread crumbs (didn't have croutons), crab and a pkg. of imitation lobster. (Could not bring myself to chop up a real tail @ $12 lb!) Was a bit short on the lobster so mine didn't have as much as a seafood flavor as I had hoped. OK all in all, I will try this again.

**EDIT: Marinate shrooms in anItalian style dressing or pour a bit in the caps before stuffing.

Awesome Awesome Awesome.  I used 2 cans of crab and no lobster, because I love crab meat.  This was so good, I will make it again and again

GREAT they turned out GREAT!  I did add diced yellow bell peppers and onions, which I sauteed first.  Also added Old Bay - just a classic!  Happened to have some fresh basil and threw that into the melted butter.  Am eating them right now.  Quickly.  Enjoy the pic!

Unbelievable! These were so good, my husband and I couldn't stop eating them. I can't wait to show these off at the next potluck. I did substitute Italian breadcrumbs for the croutons and I added a little olive oil because the mix seemed somewhat dry.

Very good recipe. If you wish omit the garlic and substitute a couple of tablespoons of minced onion or a tablespoon each of minced onion and finely diced bell pepper. Great tip for this and other recipes with canned crabmeat: To remove the 'canned taste', drain the liquid from the crab then soak the meat in ice water for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the water and pat the crabmeat dry. No more canned flavor!

Wonderful! I make mine in a mini-muffin tin, place the stuffed caps in each spot, then create a small tube with tin foil before topping with cheese. This keeps the cheese from melting off the top of the stuffed mushroom.  :)

Love this recipe! I often use bread crumbs instead of croutons, and sometimes add a dash of oregano or basil. If I do not have mozzarella on hand I have used smoked cheeses or even Parmesan. They do great in the oven but even better tasting on the grill. Thanks!

We love the big chain's mushrooms and while this recipe isn't quite the same, it is a good sub.  I agree with other reviews to duplicate the big chain you need diced red pepper and scampi sauce.  We all enjoyed these though .  I did add some melted butter with some garlic powder whisked in to the top of these about 1/2 way through baking time.  I would make these again but will cut back on the amount of croutons next time.

Delicious addition to my sis-in-law's seafood potlock.  I took the advice of other posters by (1) microwaving the mushrooms for 90 seconds to remove excess water, (2) using only crab meat, (3) substituting Italian breadcrumbs, and (4) adding diced red peppers.  I also added chopped green onions and garlic roasted mushrooms. Yum!

Excellent mushrooms!  This recipe in no way tastes like any stuffed mushrooms I've eaten at a seafood chain restaurant or at any restaurant for that matter.  This is soooo much better, no comparison!

I did make a few changes, of course, as we all do to make it our own.

I halved the recipe as I was making these for just my husband (I am not a big mushroom fan).  I first sauteed one package of baby portabellas (approx. 10-12 mushrooms) with butter and a little olive oil then arranged them on a very lightly sprayed PAM casserole dish.  Next I sauteed total 1/3 cup of finely chopped red bell pepper & onion and a few of the mushroom stems (I omited the garlic).  While that was cooling I mixed together 1-6 oz can of lump crab meat, 1/2 cup of Panko (makes the stuffing light) and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.  I then added the sauteed mixture and tossed in just less than 1/4 cup of melted butter.  I cooked in a preheated oven at 375 for approx. 22 minutes.  

My husband who is a mushroom connoisseur said these were the best he's had and he doesn't spare my feelings when it comes to my trying  new recipes.  I then had to try and  agreed.

I also had enough stuffing to make a second batch the following day.  I put the unused stuffing in the refrigerator over night and the next day I let the mixture come to room temperature and prepared the portabella's as above.

Thank you, this is the best!!!

Way too much breadcrumbs! I would do this again but not add the breadcrumbs. There was no crab taste or cheese...they just taste like a mushroom and breadcrumbs. I think it would be fine without the breadcrumbs.

I used about a pound of frozen imitation crabmeat and it was still delicious.  Imagine how awesome it would be with lobster!!!  Our guests loved it... I wish I had made more. Thank you for sharing the recipe.  God bless.

Fabulous....I didn't have crab so made it with all pre-cooked lobster and I used italian bread crumbs instead of croutons.  Actually, I'm not sure why you would even bother with the croutons unless you didn't have bread crumbs.  At the recommendation of others, I pre-cooked the mushrooms which expelled some of the liquid in them and I sprayed the pan with olive oil rather than coating it with butter.  They were fantasitic.  Thank you

I used all crabmeat & chopped the stems, sauteeing them w/a little green onion before adding them to the rest of the mix. I had extra stuffing so just threw all around the mushrooms. Taste was awesome but I'd prefer a creamier cheese next time. The mozz was too chewy.

I used bread crumbs instead of crutons.  Covering the bottom of the pan with butter made the bottom of the mushrooms a little soggy but these are very good otherwise.

Only 4 stars, but I will be tweeking the recipe next time to make it a five. I found that the recipe needed more bread crumbs to soak up the liquid, but then lost some of the seafood flavor...I will definitely add the Old Bay Seasoning next time...likely that will elevate this recipe to a 5 star!  Thanks...I will be making this again!

Made this for a family get together and EVERYONE loved them! I,like others did not use lobster. I doubled the crab meat but I also do not use the croutons instead I use Italian bread crumbs (just under a cup). Now I can't go to a get together without someone wanting me to bring these wonderful mushrooms.

This is an awesome recipe.  They were a big hit. I cut up the mushroom stems and saute them with garlic in some butter then added it to the mix. I also add shrimp instead of lobster because it was easier to get.

This is a good recipe. But, if you are looking to replicate the restaurant one, you need to make changes. Made this way, they are drier and not the same taste, though very adequate for a tasty appetizer. I followed NOELLETHEDIVA's suggestions. I did not add the wine however. I added low sodium chicken broth.  I also salted the mushrooms a bit before cooking.  It gives them much better flavor. I also used only imitation crab. If you want the drippy, cheesy, messiness that these are at the restaurant, you want juice and liquids.  A shortcut on the peppers... buy the jarred or canned (precooked)red peppers, the smoked type adds even more flavor.

These are so easy to make and are a great hit!  May require slightly more baking time than recommended to brown the filling.

Great recipe!  Felt like I ordered them at a nice restaurant.  I used 8 oz of imitation lobster (instead of lobster) and I also used the stems. I added season salt and old bay seasoning.  I sprinkled with parm. cheese when they were done.  I made 11 mushrooms but had enough filing to fill 16-20.

Amazing!! we had these for dinner yesterday night, and loved them. Ok, i made some changes, first i browned 1/2 small onion (finely chopped) and the mushroom stems (i hate throwing away things i can eat). Mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and added a splash of white wine (trust me, it makes a difference). Didn't have lobster tail, so i added shrimp, and also used a four cheeses mix cause that's what i had on hand. Thank you!!

AWESOME!!! My family loved these.  I didn't add the lobster, I'm sure it would be great just a little to pricey. I also added about 2 tsp of Pesto and 1 tablespoon less of the minced garlic.  I served with ranch dressing for a dip.  Definitly try these who ever is intrested in a stuffed mushroom recipe, just as good if not better than a restaurant!!

These were delicious. I used all lobster meat for New Year's eve get together, and it worked out very well.  One 7 oz can was more than enough, and I did use a pre-seasoned seafood stuffing mix, but followed the rest of the recipe to a "T". I think it was just slightly bland though, and would like to try it again with the addition of minced onion and maybe some other herbs? I also used the chopped stems in the stuffing, and I agree it added to the moistness and general body of the stuffing.

I have made this many times. Like others, I don't have access to fresh crab or lobster. I omit the lobster and recommend using immitation crab from the freezer section. Canned crab was a real let down for this application. These are a HUGE hit!!!!!AWESOME!!!!

Have made these several times and they get better every time!  marinating the mushrooms for about an hour with a balsamic vinegarette give a nice kick to the flavor.  I also add season salt or old bay seasoning to the stuffing. I just use italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crushing croutons. no need for the lobster, just add extra crabmeat!

I didn't use the lobster, only crab (1#) and heaped it on, Used 4 cheese blend instead of the mozzerella. Sprinkled a little old bay on top. My whole family loves crab stuffed mushrooms, and these got thumbs up all around.

These mushrooms were great!  So quick & easy to prepare, however I think that 1lb of lobster tails is way to much.  I had so much stuffing left over I just tossed it into the freezer and gave it to my sister a week later for my brother in law's B-day and she used the leftovers that she had for another gathering 2 days afterward.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for! I've been craving stuffed tilapia and I knew what I wanted but couldn't find it. This stuffing was a great way to dress up the tilapia;of course,I'm sure its awesome in the mushrooms as well. Definitely a keeper.

I also substituted Italian breadcrumbs for the croutons and also did not use lobster just crab meat. I thought they were a little dry so I added another 1/2 c of melted butter.  I tripled the recipe and made it for a party we where having with a bunch of army guys and it was gone so fast!  I heard all night how good they were.  Will make even more next time but very easy and very good.

YUM!!  I used Clover Leaf Lobster Delectables (immitation lobster) instead of real lobster because I couldn't afford the real stuff.  They are still super yummy!  Will be making these again again!

very good but a little bland. added some salt,pepper and parm cheese to the mix. also cooked it longer, the mushrooms are not sufficiently cooked in 12min. needed more like 25min in the oven. overall they were all gone in minutes.

I made these for a dinner party and they were fantastic!  I sauted some chopped baby bellas with some onion & garlic and served them in large portabella mushrooms caps, and  but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  My husband was looking for leftovers the next day.  I will be making this one again for parties and holidays.

I actually used the 3/4 cup butter in the mix and because I found it a bit dry, added 1/3 cup sour cream. I also used garlic and butter croutons instead of seasoned ones. Awesome and easy...........will make again

I love these. Instead of using lobster however I use tiny salad shrimp along with the crab meat. My 7 yr old son loves to help "stuff" the mushrooms and says these are "mom's specialty"....I have recently found that if you have leftover stuffing, it goes great stuffed inside a chicken breast! yum!

I have made these several times. Boyfriend insisted on going to the seafood chain to buy them quite often, so i learned to make them at home, way more affordable. I just used the crabmeat, no lobster as well. These are great to take to events. So easy and everyone loves them.

Made these for a party this weekend...gone before they hit the table!!  I must have had 7 different requests for the recipe.  I did add a little extra butter to the mixture however the moisten a bit more and used 2 cans of crab meat instead of lobster.  More affordable to make and just as good. Will make you look like a pro. Sooooo yummy and very easy.

I had left over stone crab, so used that and didn't use the lobster.  Any seafood would probably be good with this.  Took the advise of other reviews, and pre-microwaved the shrooms a few minutes with paper towel to get some of the moisture out of them.   Also added a mixture of  1/2 c white wine, 1/4 c melted butter, and 1 tsp garlic powder over top of the stuffed mushrooms before I put them in, and added grated white cheddar on top the last 5 minutes or so of cooking time.   The wine sauce was a great add-on to the recipe for sure.

AWESOME.  I added a bit of red bell pepper and I used jack cheese instead.  I also use a mix of regular and lump crab meat.  The butter or oil in the bottom of the pan is a must if you don't want your mushrooms to dry out.  I used large, shallow ramekins to make single servings and poured the butter in the bottom.  I also add lemon juice after they're baked.  We have now had these twice in a week because they were so good.

This recipe was great, I did make a change in it though, I put fresh mushrooms in it instead of, stuffing them one at a time.  It saved time and I was able to freeze some for later.

I made these for Thanksgiving. Made several changes - used extra large mushroom caps, sprinkled with melted butter, sauteed mushroom stems with some green onion and garlic and then mixed in some crab (Chicken of the Sea in a bag), some "house seasoning", and italian breadcrumbs and mozzarella cheese. Then baked as usual. 

They were really good, but I think they needed more salt. They didn't have a ton of flavor, and I wish I had added some parm/reg cheese or something else to give it more punch. Had leftovers today, and they were still a little bland (and a little mushy leftover, but that was expected). Overall, really good, and pretty cost-effective when using bagged crab (and leaving out the lobster).

These were really good stuffed mushrooms.  Rather than using lobster, I substituted canned shrimp.  Also used canned crab and I think these still turned out great.  Family ate them right up!

I made these for a family gathering and my Uncle couldn't believe they were homemade.  I did not use lobster, but added one can of broken shrimp (rinsed well).  WAY too much garlic (needed to start over)!  I used seasoned bread crumbs and a six cheese italian blend (with a little extra shredded parmesan cheese)

I wasn't thrilled with this, but I didn't dislike it either.  I think there is way too much garlic - I would start with 1 teaspoon and add to taste.  I doubled the recipe and used a 16 oz can of crabmeat and omitted the lobster.  I found it to be a little dry - I'm wondering if a good glob of mayo in it would have done the trick.  I also sprinkled some Old Bay on top before cooking - that was the extra oomph it needed spice-wise.  But definitely needs some more moist ingredients.  I also used some as a crab dip with crackers for someone who didn't like mushrooms.  I'd definitely make again, but will experiment to see how to spruce it up a bit.  A keeper with some minor changes though!

This recipe was awesome. Substituted lobster for imitation crab - shredded it for a nicer texture, and topped with scampi sauce suggested by another user. Best mushrooms I've ever had. Stuffed some portabello's and had them for dinner. Even my meat and potato's husband had seconds.

Like a few other people suggested I left out the lobster-because I didn't have any. The mushrooms were excellent, I had a few guests over and one of them doesn't even like mushrooms and he ate 5of them!! Excellent recipe-thank you.

These are absolutely wonderful.  I've used several different cheeses and different wines for a flavor change and do NOT advise using swiss cheese and chardonay.  Far to sour.....using the changes suggested by a few reviewers really added to the recipe.

I used 2 cans of crabmeat and 1 can of tiny shrimp instead of the lobster.  I poured extra butter over the top before I baked them, and put the cheese on a few minutes before they came out of the oven.  Everyone thought they were heavenly.

I made this recipe for a bbq appetizer.   They were a BIG hit - the first thing to go!  As others suggested, I left out the lobster and doubled the crab.   I used fresh imitation crab (from the freezer section) rather than canned, then just shredded it myself, left the croutons a little chunky and it blended very nicely.  Also, when they were done, I turned on the broiler just to crisp the tops, 1-2 min. max!

I got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I, too, used all crab as it was more affordable. Before popping them into the oven, I sprinkled a little Old Bay over them. I added extra cheese (as the recipe called for) when they were done and put them under the broiler. Very good. I'd make them again.

I made these for a family gathering and everyone LOVED them. I didn't use lobster, I only used crab. It was very tasty. My son came in too late and missed out. The look on his face was priceless!! I had to make a special batch just for him. EVERYONE asked for the recipe.

Wasn't enough crab flavor but it was good and easy. My husband was in the mood red lobster crab stuffed mushrooms. But didn't want to spend the money. This fit the bill.

A couple things- I ended up with about twice as much filling as mushrooms, so ended up going out and buying more mushrooms so that I could make a 2nd batch. I don't think you really needed as much butter as the recipe suggests here. But other than that, I loved this recipe! I added a sprinkling of thyme on top for a touch of freshness.

I thought this was a great recipe. The guess I served it to you All went back for seconds and thirds. I did use two raw 8 oz spiny lobster tails and I noticed the lobster became a really good binder for the mix and held it.together well and gave it the salty seafood flavour. They could use a little bit more colour so maybe some green pepper parsley would help

CUT THE INGREDIENTS IN HALF! I ended up with so much left over even after stuffing 14 large mushrooms. And it was soooooo dry. I read some of the reviews but even with adding mushroom pieces and all the butter for moisture, it didn't help much. I did add Old Bay, paprika, green onions and cut back on the garlic to 2 tsp. for flavor and drissled olive oil on top before sticking them in the oven. Too much tweaking is needed for me to recommend this recipe or use it again.

A wonderful New Year's appetizer.  I did cut back on butter by about half.  I also used Italian bread crumbs in place of croutons out of necessity.  No damage done.  Delicious.

Good flavor, easy and quick.  Would definitely add either celery, onion, or water chestnuts...needs something crunchy.  I also added parsley!  Yummy but needs a little snap!

Tried this recipe today. we all love it! must tell ya I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs so i used stuffing mix with some ritz crackers. I also used 2 cans of crabmeat because our dinner was lobster.  Many thanks for sharing this recipe. I'm sure it will become one of those dishes that will be asked for over and over.

THIS is the one! This is the recipe we reach for every time we crave stuffed shroons! We keep it on the top of our own "seafood section" cookbook. No tweaking please! Make this, sit back, and try to wipe the smile off your face! Thank you for sharing Minnesotamom!

I added more garlic than called for and sauteed it with some green onions and olive oil.  I also used crab, shrimp, and scallops instead of messing with cooking a lobster tail.  Added some fresh cracked pepper and Italian seasoning.  In the past I have needed to add more butter to the stuffing to keep it together, but this time I added one egg and it worked out very well.  It was still very moist and the stuffing held together, but wasn't as greasy.  I will sometimes use giant portabellas instead of regular mushrooms, I think it is a bit tastier!

This was good and surprisingly easy! I did substitute an extra can of crab for the lobster (I'm a poor college student) but the results were quickly eaten by my boyfriend:). I think next time I will swap some extra cheese for the 2nd can of crab.

I used crab-only to save time. The recipe was quick and easy, but I used rather large mushrooms (over 1 lb) and I had a lot of leftover stuffing. These were good, but a little bland for my taste.

Very delightful to eat, but had to make a couple modifications. I added red pepper, onions, and fresh basil (which I grew). It is very moist from the butter which was in it, though it is not an every day recipe it was excellent for Valentines day dinner! Thank-you!

My husband and I really liked these mushrooms. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the croutons and I think next time I'll saute the garlic before adding it to the mixture. They we're really good as is though, we couldn't stop eating them.

Pretty good! We melted butter and spooned a little over each one when serving ~ that made them so much better! I will try white wine/butter mix next time. I also squeezed a 1/2 lemon into the stuffing mix. Would probably add more cheese next time too. Overall, they were really good. Serve right away.

This dish is as promised, just like the food chain resturant.  I have tried  the "fake" crab as well, less expensive and just as good! We usualy cook them on Christmas Eve, nice light snack to have with a glass of wine by the tree.

This recipe is very easy and extremely good tasting. I added minced vidalia  onion and some old bay seasoning, next time I will be adding some spinach too as this will work great as a dip for crackers.

Modified this to what I had on hand:  canned lobster and one of those shrimp rings.  Used bread crumbs instead of croutons.  Served them at a party and they were gone before I could even taste one!  Must've been pretty good!

My husband loved these mushrooms!  He said they were even better heated up in the microwave the next day. I used a couple that we had left over chopped up into an omelet. Next time I will use only fresh or frozen crab though. I thought they were a little on the fishy side.

Everyone liked these but nobody seemed to be 'wowed'.  I added green onion and more cheese.

I made these without the lobster and while they were good, my husband I agreed that they need more cheese.  Perhaps next time I will change the proportions so there is less croutons.

Excellent recipe and very easy to fix.  They taste very close to those at a resurant.
