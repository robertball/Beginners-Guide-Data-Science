This is my drink of choice when going out. As a bartender in my 20's, this was your basic cocktail. In bars and restaurants, this is called a madras. From this recipe you build many great drink recipes by adding another liquor (peach schnapps, raspberry vodka, pineapple juice)

Great drink!  I used crushed ice and to make it a little on the fancy side I added a huge slice of orange and a cherry.  These go down very easy, a little too easy.....

At first I was disappointed in this drink after all the good reviews, then I realized I bought cranberry juice coctail instead of straight cranberry juice.  My bad.  I'm sure it is terrific with the right ingredient.

since i don't drink alcohol i make this with sprite or 7-up instead of the vodka.
they serve this at Red Lobster as a 
beachcomber.  i love it!  as one member said, be sure to use pure cranberry juice.

I tried this recipe first with 1/2 oz of OJ (could bearly taste the OJ), then with 1 oz OJ, and again with 2 oz OJ. I think GUTK might have meant 1-2 oz OJ. Another way to make with out measuring is 1 part vodka, 1 part OJ and 2 parts cranberry juice.

I make these with Sapphire Gin, instead of vodka, and I use equal amounts of orange juice and cranberry juice.  I call it a Saphhire Madras.

I know the title of this drink recipe says it's a "summer" drink and it's January, but my thermometer reads 75, so I think I deserve it!  Actually I just had some vodka to use up and this was perfect!  So delicious!  Watch out though...it's hard to taste the alcohol so don't go crazy ;)

Yummy!  I doubled the OJ and used fresh squeezed.  I used 100% juice Cranberry juice (no sugar added) from Ocean Spray.  It is plenty sweet as it has other juices added for sweetness.  I wanted to use orange flavored vodka as one comment suggested,  I couldn't find any (the store was out) so I used raspberry flavored and was it ever good!

The drink is great as written...but I like to add a 1/2 shot of Triple Sec to sweeten it up just a bit for my taste.

Yummy! Nice and refreshing on warm summer evenings. Added more OJ to add a little sweetness. Happy that it does not have a strong taste of vodka. 

We made a pitcher of it and had it over several nights.

This is what I've always known as a Madras, as one of the reviewers said below.  I have been using Absolute Peach Vodka in mine, and they are wonderful poolside treats.

I'm a big fan of cape cods & screwdrivers, so I really liked this one.  I added a little more OJ than the recipe called for.

All the "summertime" comments surprised me when this cocktail was included in the Mardi Gras Drinks list. WELL! made it anyway for Fat Tuesday along with Cajun dinner and King Cake. This yummy and light drink totally complemented our Creole menu - in the dead of winter. Doubled the OJ; used pear-flavored vodka (plain or any flavor would  be fine); floated frozen raspberries (any frozen fruit will do) Absolutely Addicting and is now part of our year-round rotating cocktail list.

I love this drink--I think it's called a Madras if you order it out.  I make mine with vanilla vodka--delicious!

This is a common drink, but a good one! In many places I have worked as a bartender, we call this a "Screwed Rooster" and a "Cape Cod" is actually called a "Red Rooster".

I served in a pitcher liquid style with a block of ice in the center. Therefore the last of it was a bit watered down. Very good. Serve cold and in a cold glass if you can. I had to label it and say it was an adult beverage because kids thought it was Kool Aid! The Martha Stewart scrapbook labels available at Walmart, Michaels, etc. are really cute for labeling pitchers and platters at parties.

It's an ok drink. I think the ratio of orange juice to cranberry juice needs to be more even.

Pretty good. I like cranberry and vodka a lot, and this adds a nice twist. I'll definitely make this drink again! One note, I had some really cruddy OJ on hand, so next time I'll be sure to get a better juice. **Update, I think I may have been a little loopy when I wrote the first review, because I'm trying these again with better orange juice and they're just okay. Sorry! Watering it down a bit made it taste light and yummy.

Hubby made me one of these last night, however at bartending school I learned the real name for this is "Madras."  Very good drink.  Just don't drink too many, they do catch up with you!

I've been drinking this concoction for years...although I use more orange juice and a splash of cranberry juice which gives it a nice peachy/pink tone. I had no idea it was called a red rooster.

I have been drinking these every summer for the last few years. They are ever so refreshing on a sweltering day. Yum! But like most others, I can only drink one or maybe two (if I'm not driving. lol) They're sneaky! Thanks!

I would never say "Wowza"...but can I say "cockadoodledoo?" Great drink! Try and keep it to one... or you might be up and strutting at the crack of dawn. (smiles). Thanks, Kim.

I like girly drinks and a really strong alcohol taste makes me queasy, so I took the advice of other reviewers and cut down the amount of vodka to about an ounce. I was out of OJ, so I omitted it (next time, I'll be sure to use it!) and I used the Magic Bullet to make it into a slushy drink. It was yummy, even just using the cranberry juice! Thanks, Kim!

This is a great drink on a hot day.  I reduced the amount of vodka to 1 shot.  Also, I took the advice of others and slightly increased the amount of orange juice.

It isn't bad at all. I personaly prefer it with 1 fluid ounce of orange juice. Not a huge difference, but I can see it.
