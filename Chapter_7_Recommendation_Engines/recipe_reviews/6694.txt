Perfect!  We love challah, but searched for one without the milk and sugar in the usual recipes.  I bake this all the time even for our regular whole wheat sandwich bread, just replace the flour with whole wheat flour and add 4tsp. vital wheat gluten and it makes a perfect loaf of soft (not dense, hard, and heavy) wheat bread. Also makes great whole wheat dinner rolls just make the same adjustments and form into balls (12-15 or more depending on size preference) instead of forming a loaf and then cover and let rise 20-30 minutes until almost doubled in size, brush with egg glaze and bake 20-30 minutes or until done.  I've even used the same dough (whole wheat of course) to make awesome whole wheat cinnamon rolls, just use this dough in place of the one on "clone of a cinnabon" on this site for a healthier version of that yummy recipe, and follow shaping and icing instructions using fat free cream cheese in place of the other in the recipe.  I just love this recipe, soooo many possibilities and it freezes well too... thanks Ione!!!

Oh so easy, but be sure not to over bake so it is not dry. I added 1 cup of raisins which I had covered with water and replumped in the microwave on high for five minutes, drained and let cool. I brushed the top prior to baking with honey,thin with a little water if it is difficult to spread and sprinkle with poppy seeds. Enjoy!

This is my first and the best Challah!! Not having a bread machine, I hand knead it for 15 minutes. It turned out great! I also brush some egg york with honey on the surface before baking. Oh this is so good my family couldn't stop eating. A must-try recipe!

This is a good white bread-I think it would be better with a bit more honey or sugar added. Best when toasted.

Absolutely delicious bread.  I don't have a bread machine so I just softened the yeast in the water, then whisked in the salt, honey, and oil (I can't be bothered to melt butter on the stove since I don't have a microwave).  Stir in one cup of the flour, then the eggs.  Stir in as much flour as you can, then knead in the remaining.  I had to use a smidge more flour to get the right consistency. Tasty, wonderful bread.

I had so much fun making this!  A great, easy to follow recipe...not as complicated as I was expecting.  I also do not have a bread machine, so I heated the water to 110-115 degrees F, then added the yeast to soften.  Next, I whisked in the honey, salt and melted butter.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and stirred in 1 cup of flour, then the eggs.  Finally added as much flour as I could, then kneaded the rest in.  I kneaded the dough for about 7 minutes, then put in a greased bowl, covered and let rise for about 35 mintues.  I rolled out 3 strands of dough (all equal in size and thickness) and did a simple braid, then pinched off the ends to secure.  I did find many wonderful videos on YouTube showing how to make with 4, 5 and even 6 strands...will try some of these next time.  Brushed on an egg wash of 1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp. water...just scrambled the leftover egg mixture for a snack.  Baked Challah at a lower temp (350 degrees) for 35 minutes and it came out perfect.  Next time might top with sesame or poppy seeds ~ Thanks!

Excellent - moist, delecious and ingredients are spot on.  Brushing with egg and topping with poppy seeds a must in my book.  Go to youtube and look up braiding videos to learn the different braids - everything from 3 to 6 strings and your bread will look great.

This recipe was really authentic and tasted as good as it looked! I would suggest adding an egg wash after the last rising and just before you put it in the oven. This makes it shine. The egg wash contains one egg and 1 tablespoon water beaten together and brushed over the top of the braided dough. Also, to make the bread festive, sprinkle some sesame or poppy seeds over the top just before baking!

Added about 1 cup of raisins to dough, brushed loaf with honey, and then sprinkled cinnamon over it. I don't have a bread maker, so I kneaded the dough for 10 minutes. Turned out wonderful. Next time I'll add more raisins and honey to dough, and try mixing in some cinnamon as well.

The bread was light, fluffy, and melt in your mouth good! Simply delicious! Just had to remember not to overknead...left the dough sort of mushy and not very kneadable with the hands before the first rising...but it was not too hard to shape after 60 minutes. The loaf was GONE in a few minutes!!!! Yum Yum Yum! Thank you for a great recipe! Didn't have to change a thing! I don't have a breadmachine but it turned out great!

Very nice bread. It is light but still eggy, so works well as sandwiches.  Also very easy to braid as well. I made two braided loaves a while ago and then popped them in the freezer. I pulled one out tonight for dinner. This is good plain, with butter, and for chicken sandwiches. Thanks for the recipe!

I had Challah bread before, and this did not compare.  This bread was very dense, and the crust was too hard.  The flavor was bland and should have been sweeter.  The Challah I had before was sweet, light and fluffy.  I won't make this recipe again.

The crust hardened too quickly and the inside was not as soft as other recipes I've tried.  I added 2 tsps more of sugar, since I prefer sweeter challah.  However, the dough is VERY easy to work with.  When tucking under the ends of my braid, I wet them slightly with water to make it easier for them to stick together.  I also did not have to cook it for the duration called for, so keep any eye on it.

Rediscovered the bread machine while cleaning the basement.  This recipe was just what I was looking for.  A nice homemade bread - light and fluffy.  The crust wasn't as hard as I've had on other store-bought challahs but my family devoured the whole loaf in one sitting.  Great tasting warmed with some butter on it.

It made a very nice white bread, but it's not even close to the authentic challah recipe I was looking for. But it is good for an everyday bread.

Great flavour! For the lazy amongst you, halved the amount and set to a basic white for complete bread machine ease (add a little more flour though). I now use this as my everday loaf!!

Also tried it with dry active yeast with no problems as long as you reactivate first.

We love this recipe and are asked to bring it to dinners frequently. We burn our fingers eating it fresh out of the oven. We have tried other challah recipes and this one is by far the best.

This recipe is perfection!  Followed it exactly, but did add 3 teaspoons vital wheat gluten, which I do to all my bread.  It was a beautiful loaf, very soft, and delicious.  I think this is the best bread I've ever made.  We both loved it.  The dough was super easy to work with, and was just sweet enough for us.  Great job on this recipe....thanks!

I was delicious! Mouthwatering, flaky, angel soft and simply tasty! I made the dough in a bread machine and then baked it in the oven. I also sprinkled some sesame seeds on top.

The next day, if any is left, this makes great french toast!  I usually cut at least an inch thick slice, dip in an egg batter and fry it up.  If I have fresh fruit, I will top it with that.  Yummy!!!

I love this bread. I have made it at least a half dozen times exactly as written with incredible results. I thought it would make an excellent savory bread so I kneaded in a 1/3 cup of diced pickled jalapeno and about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I also substituted white sugar for the honey. The result was a light yet rich loaf with the heat of jalapenos and the tang of cheddar cheese. Definitely a keeper

This has got to be by far the best loaf of bread I have made! I did not use a bread machine, just made it the old fashion way, also did not braid the dough, made it into a loaf, It raised wonderfully , the texture and taste were beautiful. This is a real keeper No doubt I will make it again and again,

this is the first recipe I tried in my new breadmaker and it came out great. I don't have much to compare it too but the bread was baked perfectly and had good flavor. it reminds me very much of the taste and texture of a soft pretzel. I washed with egg white and added poppy seed as another suggested and gave it with our holiday food baskets. I will definitely make it again but will add a bit more honey to increase the flavor.

A wonderful dough; I confess I subverted it to the making of sweet rolls pinwheeled with raisins and nuts, cinnamon and brown sugar.  It performed beautifully as a vehicle for all that tinkering.  Thank you!  Next time I'll restore it to its proper function as a braided loaf.  'Soon!

We loved this Challah!  It was wonderful.  I set my oven for 40 minutes but next time I'll set it for 35 minutes.  I did a 6 strand braid but I think I pulled it to tight.  Will keep practicing now that I found a great recipe! I basted it with a mixture of one egg and 2 tbs. water.  I also recommend dipping your finger in the egg and then on some sesame seed and rolling it to make a nicer presentation.   Thank you Ione!

This was my first time baking a yeast bread other than pizza dough.  I don't have a bread machine so I used directions from other challah recipes to combine ingredients and let the bread rise.  The bread came out great and my family loved it.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe turned out even better when I "accidentally" baked the bread at 375 deg. for 25 minutes.  It was perfectly moist and golden brown.

Always wrap the challah in a damp tea towel, right out of the oven.  This stops the crust from becoming hard.  It works. When it is cool, you have a lovely softer crust. I did tweak this a bit: I use three eggs instead of two. I also add a very generous quarter cup of honey: I don't measure exactly but it is probably an extra tablespoon. I brush the loaf with a lightly beaten egg before baking.  I don't have a bread machine so I make it by hand, and knead it about 6 to 8 minutes. I have made so many of these over the years, and this is the best recipe I have found.

I made as directed, except I brushed the top with egg wash before baking. It was done in 25 minutes, but I have a convection oven, and things tend to get done quickly. Came out great! The texture and taste were wonderful.

This was very good. I don't have a bread machine so this is what I did. In a large bowl mixed the water and the yeast let stand for 5 minutes. Mixed in the egg, butter and honey. Added the flour and the salt. Knead for 8 minutes. Place in an oiled bowl cover and let rise 1-1/2 hours until doubled. Then continued with the recipe instructions. Thanks for the recipe

Made a nice large pretty loaf. The flavor was good, but not anything exciting.  I was hoping to taste more of the honey in it, but I think I could have used sugar and gotten the same flavor.  It was very good, I was hoping for something more.

I added a 1/4 cop of sugar and omitted the salt. Because I used dairy free butter which is already salty.

I'm not sure if this is a fair rating to a Challah bread because I've never had challah before. I found the bread kind of boring tasting. There just wasn't much taste. My little sister loved it though so maybe it's just me. I just thought it was missing something...

I've made a lot of challah recipes in my day, and this is by far my favorite! It is always moist and buttery and absolutely delicious. I make the dough in my breadmaker and it's easy as can be. If I'm too lazy to braid it I just divide the dough in half and pop each in a loaf pan before the 2nd rising.

My husband bought me a bread machine a few weeks ago so I have been making different breads here and there.  Mainly because we truly want to avoid the preservatives and high fructose that is found in most bread.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I made this recipe exactly to the letter.  My only problem was I put it in the oven for 25 minutes when it probably should have been more like 20 or at least I should have been looking at it at the 20 minute make.  Nevertheless, the bread was a darker brown but tasted delicious!!  Very rich, mildly sweet and wonderful.  It deserves 5 stars!!!
