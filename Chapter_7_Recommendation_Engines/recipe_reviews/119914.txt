This is a good place to start.  I did the recipe and the only change I made was elbow mac instead of rice.  It will be 1.5 cup mac to get 3 cups cooked.  To make this a 5 star recipe you really need to add some seasoning.  Next time I am going to add some green peppers, onions, garlic, and some chili powder.  I will make again using my adjustments.

We thought this was awesome. Used Rigatoni instead of the rice.  My family doesn't like mushrooms so I left them out.  Served with a green salad and baking mix biscuits.  EXCELLENT WEEK NIGHT MEAL~

Easy meal to make and my hubby enjoyed it.  I added red and yellow peppers to the dish since I did not have mushrooms...oh, and I used pasta shells in place of rice.

This was pretty good however I used a package of sloppy joe seasoning and 5 oz can of tomotoe paste and 1 1/4 of water. I also added some of my own spices and some homeade hot salsa. Awesome way to use left over rice.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I have to admit, it sounded a little odd when I read it, but Im so glad we tried it! It was very easy, and had lots of flavor. I did use cheddar cheese on top instead.  We will be definately making this again in the future.Thanks!!

The first time I made this it was a bit dry.  The second time I made a few minor adjustments by adding additional sloppy joe sauce.  It was far better once those adjustments were made.

Pretty good, I did use two cans of sloppy joe sauce though.  I will put in a lot less rice next time.  The cheese on top was great.

Great meal. We added a TBS of chilie powder, and a little hot sause. We added pasta noodles instead of rice. Added some chopped onions and green peppers. Instead of Mozzarella cheese we used Chedder. Great left overs. This is something quick to throw in a week day mix.

Having leftover sloppy joe meat I searched sloppy joe casserole and found this one! Very good recipe, like others instead of using rice I used elbow macaroni and I added peppers, garlic and a little bit of ground mustard to the meat mixture. I didn't use mushroom because my husband isn't a fan but it turned out perfect without them! Thanks a bunch for sharing this simple easy recipe. Def a great way to use up leftover sloppy joe meat! :)
