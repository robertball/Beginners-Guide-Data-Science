This was a nice change of pace from the usual salsa. I made it exactly as written and served it over grilled pork. This would also be excellent over grilled shrimp or chicken.  Normally I prefer my salsas after they've sat a while and the flavors have blended. This one, however, I found to be better when freshly made.  When I tried it the next day the combination of mint, ginger and mango gave it a kind of 'perfumey' flavor which I wasn't as fond of.  Personal preference though. I think I would have preferred a little less onion, so will cut back the next time I make it. A nice refreshing salsa, perfect for a summer cookout.

Made this last night, use it with Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps and added a Asian Slaw. It was great. Followed the recipe exactly. Will make again. In fact, making this for Super Bowl. Thanks for the recipe

It was the perfect topping for otherwise bland tilapia fillets. It made more than I needed, but I mixed the rest with some diced cucumber and ate it with a spoon. If I were inclined toward lily gilding and wanted variety, I might add some finely minced habanero for a citrusy burst of heat, but it's fine the way it is.

Great recipe.  I had purchased a bushel of Palisade peaches and needed to do something with before they went bad.  So used peaches and mangos, left out the cilantro, added more mint, some fresh red pepper, jalapeno, and some sugar.  It was fabulous!
