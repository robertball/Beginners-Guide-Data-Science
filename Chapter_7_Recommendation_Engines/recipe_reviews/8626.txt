This is an excellent recipe, and lives up to all the reviews. A few things to remember. 1. Double the sauce, or you won't have enough. 2. If you're going to baste with the sauce, do it in the last minutes of of grilling. 3. Marinating the chicken and veggies is a MUST, and the longer the better. I put the chicken and veggies in separate zip-lock bags, and left them for about 8 hours. Every time I went to the fridge I turned the bags over. 4. If you're using wooden skewers, don't forget to soak them in water for a few hours, or they'll burn...I hate it when that happens. 5. If you lower your grill temperature a bit, you'll be able to put the veggies and chicken on the same skewers and they'll come out cooked to perfection. Place your hand about 2 inches over the heated grill surface. If you can hold your hand there for three seconds, then you've got the right grill temperature. If you have to take your hand away sooner, it's too hot. Oh, and you've got to add some pineapple chunks. Keep the faith and keep cooking.

This was really good.  The only thing that I did differently was to put all the chicken together on skewers and the veggies together on skewers.  This way, if the veggies got done first they didn't burn while waiting for the chicken.

Have tried this recipe 3 - 4 times over the past year with different cuts of chicken, etc.  The absolute best way is to buy chicken thighs (bone in) and marinate for a minimum of 24 - 30 hours.  I make batches of them and put 10-12 pieces in the fridge at a time.  My family uses them as "grab and go's".  Wonderful recipe!!!

5+++!  These kabobs were SO tender & flavorful. I marinated them all day using low-salt soy sauce, canola oil, the honey, black pepper, & fresh minced garlic.  Added just a touch of cayenne pepper to the marinade and it was great!  Doubled the marinade as I did not want my veggies marinating in the same mixture as the chicken.  To grill, on one skewer, used red & orange bell peppers, and a red onion, as that is what I had on hand and these required different cooking times than the meat and other veggies used.  On another skewer, did zucchini, grape & cherry tomatoes from our garden.  And on another, used pineapple chunks.  Thank you, Ann Marie!

This is a very tasty and versatile recipe!  I haven't had any trouble with lack of flavor; in fact, the other night I made this last minute and it only marinated about 30 minutes and was still delicious.  The kabobs are great, but one of my favorite ways to use this is as a sandwich:  leave the chicken breasts intact, or cut in half to fit a hamburger bun.  Otherwise, follow the recipe for marinating the chicken (I did put the garlic and onion in the marinade for flavor).  Serve on a bun (I prefer whole wheat) with swiss cheese melted on top, honey mustard, and toppings of your choice (lettuce, tomato, onion, etc).  Yum!  If you make extra chicken, try the leftovers sliced on a salad for lunch the next day.

I used this mix with a stir fry!  It was wonderful on top of chicken fried rice!  I placed the chicken strips in a bowl with the marinade and then place the whole thing in a wok and let it cook together, then drained 3/4 of the marinade and cooked for 5 minutes and served on top of rice, AWESOME!

We had a BBQ for July 4th and decided to serve these for something a little different.  They were a hit!!  People are still talking about them 2 months later.  We marinated shrimp in addition to the chicken and added pineapple to the skewers. They were fabulous.

These were fabulous!  We only had time to marinate the chicken for two hours, but that was plenty of time, as they gained plenty of flavor.  We also grilled the kabobs on a little skewer rack that kept them from directly touching the grill.  It took a little longer to cook this way (just over 15 minutes), but it also kept them from sticking.  We used onion, cherry tomatoes, and mushrooms, and these were the best skewers we've ever made on our grill!  We'll definitely have them again - the marinade just makes the dish!

I added extra garlic and a tsp of ginger and marinated for three hours.  I think they needed longer time in the marinade for more flavor. Next time I will try overnight.  They were delicious, and will make often this summer.

This recipe was just fantastic! I didn't have soy sauce so I used Yoshida's marinade instead and the results were just awesome.  A slightly sweet, teriyaki flavored marinade.  Even my 3 year old ate the chicken.  My husband who is the pickiest human alive absolutely loved it.  Thanks for a great summer recipe!

Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!! It's been a family favorite for a couple of years now. We like to use zucchini, mushrooms, onions, peppers and chicken, which we douse with a hearty dose of salt, pepper and garlic powder before adding to the marinade. When I'm not in the mood to skewer, I place the meat and veggie chunks on a broiler pan covered with foil and cooking spray, then broil on high 5-7 inches from the flame for app. 7 minutes on each side, or until chicken is done. You can also separate the veggies from the meat and broil separately if you feel one needs more time than the other. If you pound them flat (1/2 -3/4 inch thickness) before marinading, whole boneless chicken breast halves also take around 7 minutes to broil per side. This is a great alternative to my charcoal grill in the middle of the winter. In fact, we're having it tonight!

Was a good recipe, but even after marinating overnight, not enough flavor for us.  Made it Asian style by cooking it in a wok, then added broccoli and peppers and served with rice.  Next time will keep a lot more sauce aside to top at the end.  With the extra sauce, it will probably be a 4 star recipe!

WONDERFUL flavoring!!  I did not have time to marinate them, so I baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Every 5 minutes I rotated them and you'd never know that hadn't been marinated!  I cannot wait to make these again!

So I'm not crazy about cutesy titles like "Yummy".  I may have even rolled my eyes a little.  But, "Yummy!" was all I could say when I tasted this chicken!  I only marinated the chicken for about 30 minutes due to time constraints, so I can't imagine how heavenly it would be after marinating all day long.  I skewered the vegetables separately because my kids didn't want veggies to touch their chicken.  They were actually done at the same time as the chicken.  As other reviewers suggested, don't forget to add some pineapple!  I added it to some of the chicken skewers, and I'll definitely do it again next time... Yummy!!

This was so good. We added a can of pineapple rings with it's juice to the marinade and omitted the oil all together. Very simple marinade with great results.

I liked the recipe, but a similar recipe I have calls for equal part lemon juice, and is delicious.  I also use olive oil instead of veg. oil to make it a little healthier.

Wow.  These are FABULOUS!  These are my new favorite chicken kabob recipe.  So good.  And I even actually followed the recipe (minus the black pepper, of course)!!  The only change I made was to double the marinade (would have been ok w/original or 1/2 more, though) and I added yellow and orange bell peppers to the kabobs. I served these w/Brazilian Rice from here and that was a perfect combo.  So good, have I mentioned that yet?  And I'm not a huge chicken fan, I could take it or leave it, but I ate all of these. Try these; you won't be disappointed!  THANK YOU for a great recipe!!

Wow!  These are amazing!  For years I've been trying to find that perfect flavor for grilled chicken, and these have it!  I think this would be great for pork kabobs too.  And so easy.  I can't wait to have a grill party to show off this great recipe.  Thank you very much!

This recipe was a huge hit with my family. At family BBQ's everyone always looks for it. The marinade is so versatile and I have used it successfully with beef and shrimp. This is already a family favorite.

Wow! This was awesome! I got so many compliments on this recipe - everyone said they were the best kabobs they had ever had. I used half light soy sauce and half really dark/strong soy sauce. I also crushed the garlic (I use 3 cloves) and some fresh ginger into the marinade. The extra garlic & ginger were a delicious touch - I highly recommend trying them. Great recipe!

UPDATE: I guess my taste buds have either matured or changed, because I now rank this as one of the BEST kabobs I've EVER eaten! This time, I marinated two large chicken breasts (one per person), zucchini, red onion and red / orange bell peppers. I didn't separate my meat / veggies since my hubby has a handy ThermoWorks Thermapen to tell him exactly when everything is cooked thru. I halved my marinade between two Zip-Lock baggies (one for meat and one for veggies) and then strained the veggie marinade to use for basting. I can't WAIT to try this as a sandwich (with Swiss and honey mustard) or in a stir-fry! SOOOO GOOD!!! I guess I'm in the minority here, but I didn't care for these at all. On the flipside, my hubby liked these quite a bit. My biggest gripe is that there just simply isn't enough marinade to coat everything.  I halved this, but ended up making the full amount of marinade. I also NEVER marinate my raw meat and veggies together (my gosh...). Since I ended up making double the amount of marinade called for, I used half of it to baste while grilling and divided the remaining half to marinate my meat / veggies with. I also took some liberty with what veggies (and fruit!) I used - a yellow / orange bell pepper, a sweet onion and some FRESH pineapple chunks. Threading my veggies and chicken / pineapple on separate skewers ensured that my veggies wouldn't overcook. Steamed rice rounded out our simple meal. Thanks for sharing, Ann Marie.

AWESOME, I followed marinade recipe exactly except I also added vinegar to it. Marinaded a bag of ckn and a bag of mushrooms/onions for like 12 hrs. Added bacon around the chicken pieces, skewered everything up and added pineapple. Tasted delicious!

This is a great recipe with in the cupboard ingredients.  I marinated half of it for 4 hours and it was pretty good. The other half I marinated for 24 hours and it was wonderful.

LOVE this! Tried it last night before my son's first birthday party in May and couldn't be happier! Did follow others suggestions of doubling the marinate so I had enough to brush on while grilling (marinated chicken and veggies in seperate bags). I used canned pineapple chunks and it was so good! I also used the pineapple juice from the can in the marinate as well. I let the chicken marinate for about 26 hours (flipped the bag everytime I went to the fridge) and the veggies about 8- WONDERFUL! Thank you so much for sharing! I am so glad I have this for parties now! Also, they were GREAT the next day for lunch!!! Hubby took some leftovers to work and shared a few with a coworker and they were a hit, in fact, I believe we will be having some extra guests at the party since they had a taste at work lol. Veggies added: green pepper, red pepper, yellow pepper, zuchinni, mushroom, onion, pineapple.

This is my new favorite recipe!  I marinated the chicken and veggies for about 5 hours.  The meat was juicy tender and full of flavor.  I will definitely be making this again. ***Works just as well baked in a casserole dish in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes.

Yum - this IS very good! BUT - I give it three stars b/c it doesn't taste much different than the many other chicken marinades I've tried from this site. I guess I was hoping for something more unique - it just wasn't what I was looking for. Not exceptional but it is certaintly very good. The only change: used 6 whole chicken breasts instead of cubes...like so many others did. Thanks!

This was a very good marinade. I just used halved chicken breasts, marinated for 4 hours, and grilled just the way they were. Since I wasnt skewering with the vegetables, I added finely minced onion and garlic to the marinade. So good, and very easy. thanks!

Another winner at our house.  I soaked the chicken for about 20 hours.  I marinated the veggies seperately.  Peppers, onions, zucchini and pineapple.  This was a dinner to remember.  Thank you.

I thought it would be wonderful based on so many positive reviews -- as several others mentioned, I too, thought it was very salty and my chicken came out very dry (had to be grilled on low heat to avoid burning veggies and to cook chicken thoughly). Next time I may try less soy sauce and will cook the chicken and veggies seperately.

FANTASTIC!  My family LOVED this recipe!  I marinated the chicken and vegies for about 4 hours before grilling.  Used onions and red and yellow peppers.  Only used 6 chikcen breasts instead of 8.  Terrific recipe - I'd give it 100 stars if I could!

This recipe was really delicious. I skewered
3 or 4 skewers with just chicken, and 3 or 4
skewers with just vegetables so the chicken 
wouldn't undercook and the veggies wouldn't 
overcook. I liked this recipe better than any
bottled marinade.

Truly Yummy! Everyone loved it! I followed the recipe as written (other than leaving out the peppers cause I didn't have any). Instead if grilling I cooked the chicken under the broiler.

I marinated my chicken all day, so I guess that's why mine looks much darker than most of the photos. I chose to stir-fry them with onions and cubanelle peppers as it was getting late. Hubby-to-be said it was delicious, so that's all I need because he is so picky! Only change was 4 large cloves of minced garlic in the marinade and an alternate cooking method.

These were very good!  I followed reviews and doubled the sauce.  I used red, orange, green, and yellow peppers, and onions...also used pineapple.  Very good.  The chicken had a very nice flavor.

This is the only chicken kabob marinade I use anymore.  I make it for my family and for guests.  Everyone loves it.  The kabobs are great with chicken, pineapple, cherry tomatoes and red onion too.

These were great and so fun to make!  I let the meat and veggies marinate for 5 hours.  I halved the meat and vegetables in the recipe, but made the full amount of marinade.  I brushed the (reserved) leftover marinade over the kabobs.  They only took about 8 minutes to cook through on high heat.  Will definitely make again, maybe adding some cherry tomatoes next time.

Great recipe. I gave it 5 stars for it's simplicity and taste. I kept putting more sauce on the kabobs while they were on the grill and I think I did it too much because the taste suddenly became too strong. Once or twice should be enough, I think I did it about 6 times. Anyway this recipe is great! My party guests gobbled it all up this weekend and someone took the last ones home! Good thing I saved some that were still marinating in my fridge. I marinated overnight and I think that's exactly what this needed. I put mushrooms, red bell peppers, green bell peppers, and onions. Oh and of course, cut up chicken breasts. I used the leftover marinade from the vegetables (not from the chicken!) to add while on the grill. Will make again!

Fantastic recipe! This went over big-time with family and friends. We marinated the chicken separate from the veggies. We also doubled the marinade as recommended by a number of people. Lastly, we took the remaining marinade and cooked it down to a semi-thick sauce on the stove top. Served the kabobs on a bed of rice with extra sauce and everyone was happy. We did happen to have a small amount of leftovers one time, which were added to a grilled pizza - can we say yum?!

This was pretty tastey. My husband and I hosted my parents and 2 sisters for dinner last night. I did not change a thing bout the marinade (except I added way more fresh garlic) I only used 5 chicken breast though. The marinade as stated would absolutely not be enough for 8 chicken breast. Marinating overnight is an absolute MUST. I put the veg and chicken in separate zip top bags. NEVER marinate together!!  I skewered the chicken and veg separately and grilled them over charcoal. The honey charred nicely giving it great flavor. My family really liked it.

Regarding the marinate, the recipe instructs to set aside/reserve a little marinate BEFORE adding chicken. Once this is done add the chicken to the remainder of marinate and marinate desired time.  When ready to cook chicken discard the marinate chicken was in and use reserved for brushing over meat while cooking. Happy Cooking!!!

These are very good.  I have made them for a couple of years but haven't rated them until now.  I have made them on a grill and on the stove top using a grill pan. I prefer the grill but they are good either way. I doubled the sauce but that was the only change that I made.  Enjoy!

These were good, but not fabulous.  I was disappointed given the rating, but it was fine for a weeknight dinner.  I may try making them again, but I may add some fresh ginger to bump up the flavor.

YES!  Loved this!  I added some crushed red pepper flakes for spice.  TIP - tenderize your meat by pounding it down just a little with a rolling pin.  Makes a difference!

Made this yesterday for Fathers Day, we all LOVED it! I added 1/4 cup brown sugar and a full teaspoon of Montreal Steak Seasoning, we just love that stuff on everyhing we grill! I separated about 1/2 cup of the sauce before marinating and cooked it down to thicken and brushed it on at the last minute.I used Vidalia onions too, yum! Served w/ rice pilaf and salad.

Made this for dinner last night and these were the best chicken kabobs I’ve ever made! My husband and I loved them and even my father who hates chicken thought they tasted great!   I only had time to marinate the meat and veggies for 1-1/2 hrs and still thought they had great flavor.   We used onions, zucchini and will add pineapple next time.  I also used garlic powder instead of the cloves because I didn’t have any on hand.  Plan on making these a lot this summer. Thank You!

We loved this recipe.  I had the poultry store cut the chicken for me so that made it even easier.  I made it this summer when we would be running around a lot and needed to have a nice dinner for company.  We were lucky enough to use peppers from the garden.  I also used baby portabella mushrooms on some of the kabobs.  Everyone enjoyed this so much that we put the recipe in the permanent file and have used it again and again.  Thanks

Very tasty.  I usually do not care for marinades as it seems the meat never truly picks up the flavor, but this marinade surprised me.  The chicken absorbed the flavor well and it turned out quite juicy.  Family loved the kabobs and the left-overs made a very tasty chicken salad. This will definitely become a regular at my house!

Delicous!  The next time I make these I will cook the vegetables and chicken separately.  In order to make sure the chicken was done I overcooked the rest.

Great dish and my husband loved it.  I would also put all the vegetables on a skewer(s) and the chicken on seperate skewers since they cook differently.

(for the potatoes i used season salt) thank you for this great recipe!

Turned out perfect.  Definitely double marinade. I did place veggies and chicken together on skewer and it all came out perfect.  Used local honey, red pepper and sweet onions. Also, added zucchini which cooked in sync with peppers and onion.  Marinaded for only 1-1/2 hours - next time will do much longer.  Soaked wooden skewers overnight - had no problem with burning.  Used a grate pan on grill for easier handling. Made for a party and everyone loved it.

Delicious meal.  My family and friends really enjoyed the taste of this marinade.  I made a double batch so we could baste the meat and veggies while cooking, but also had multiple skewers of grilled new red potatoes that we marinated.  The meal was a huge hit.  Thanks Ann Marie for sharing.

These were perfectly fine kabobs but probably not something I'll make again. I was hoping for a stronger Asian-honey flavor than these provided.

1st time making kabobs, and this was amazingly delicious! I followed others' suggestions and doubled the sauce. I used mushrooms, zucchinni, and yellow peppers as my veggies and marinated them separate from the chicken. I marinated both for about 24 hrs. When it came time to grill them up, I put the chicken and veggies on separate skewers. Everything was so flavorful, esp. the chicken and mushrooms which soaked up all the flavor. I actually marinated too much of the veggies, so I sauteed them in their remaining marinade. We ate everything over rice, with the sauteed extra veggies as the "sauce". It was so good & EASY! Awesome summer meal, will be making again and playing around with different veggies! Best of all, hubby loved it too!

Absolutely delish! 10+++ yummy, juicy, tender chicken. Just perfect. This is a keeper. I doubled the sauce and marinated the chicken separate from the veggies. The total marinating time took 6.5 hours. Halfway through I turned the meat to make sure everything was evenly soaked. One hour before I started grilling I soaked teh skewers in water. This is such a nice change of pace.

This was good, easy to prepare from standard pantry items, but not fabulous.  I used the garlic press on the garlic so it would release into the marinade.  I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours, and it was tender and the marinade flavors came through.  I did not marinate the veggies, but used some reserved marinade to toss the veggies in before putting them on the skewers.  I added a couple of zucchini, and I think they added to the dish.  Served the dish over rice cooked in chicken stock.

SO easy and yummy.  I marinated the chicken all day.  I used the amount stated for the liquid ingrediants, only I used 2.5 large chicken breasts.  Had the perfect amount of marinade.  I like others grilled the onion seperatley.

This marinade is very easy to make. It works for me as a marinade for just cooking up chicken to serve over rice. Definitely agree with everyone else to leave it marinading for hours.

These were wonderful!  We had planned on grilling but the weather did not agree with that plan so I popped them in the oven at 450 for 30 minutes, turning them over half way through.  I added broccoli to the marinade mixture also and it tasted fantastic!

First of all, I made this recipe twice this weekend for 2 different parties. HUGE hit! First party I didn't add the pinapples but for the 2nd party I added fresh pineapple chunks plus pineapple juice to the marinade. It really tasted better with the pineapple. The party guests were loving the kabobs. My aunt who has been in the food business practicaly her whole life, said they were "exquisite". I was a puffed up chef at that point. Great recipe I will definitely make this again and again. Enjoy!

...Very Yummy! I included these in my 4th of July menu yesterday..just diced my chicken and veggies and put them all in a ziploc bag with the marinade for 6+ hrs. I didn't have room in my fridge to preassemble so when it was time to fire up the grill I pulled a few guests from the pool and we had these skewered in no time!  I highly recommend adding button mushrooms...very good flavor! Thanks Ann Marie.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I don't think it takes quite as long to cook as the recipe suggests.  Mine cooked thoroughly in under 10 minutes.  The honey taste is really very mild, the soy sauce overpowers it.  We served it with a mesculen salad and white rice.  Leftovers were tossed with the salad for lunch (could also be make into wraps).

Like another reviewer, I used this to marinate whole chicken breasts. I marinated overnight. This was some of the best chicken I've ever had. I loved it, and can't wait to have it again! I highly recommend this recipe!

I tried this last night. It was fantastic! Like some others I threaded the chicken by itself & the veggies by themselves. I made a huge batch of the marinade & made a few different combinations of veggies. I love grilled veggies & fruits so this was time to play. One held zucchini chunks I'd partially baked beforehand, pineapple chunks, whole mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, pre-cooked 1" slices of corn on the cob & red onion. We love the onion with a crisp bite so it worked perfectly. On the other I threaded partially cooked chunks of butternut squash (chunks baked in the oven for 15 min. @ 400, tossed with honey, olive oil & cinnamon), red & green pepper chunks, Vidalia onion slices then alternated pre-cooked roasted chunks of sweet potatoes and gold yukons. The last was much more fruity. Chunks of: Pineapple, nectarine, peach and pre-baked partially cooked apple, pear, & then orange segments. Added between every 3rd fruit a slice of red onion. 
I made way more than enough to feed the group of 6 I'd had over thinking I'd have leftovers & the night ended with not a single morsel in sight. The rave reviews more than made up for the lacking leftovers.
Served this with a garden sink salad and wild rice pilaf. It's definitely in #1 place on the summer menu.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was wonderful! I did add a few extra cloves of garlic, used canned pineapple and added grape tomato, ran out of honey as I took the suggestion to double the marinade and ended up using some of the pineapple juice in place of the honey. This is a keeper.

I marinated the chicken cubes overnight and it didn't really tenderize the chicken or add very much flavor.  It also burns easy on the grill and I had medium heat.  I guess it was because of the honey.  This recipe needs some ginger or something to spice it up a bit.  Not making it again.

I doubled the marinade amts. upon the advice of others.  It is an excellent marinade if you let it soak in overnight.  I did the chicken cubes and vegetables on separate skewers, using both Vidalia and red onions, red and green bell peppers, and medium-sized white mushrooms.  Will be making this again.  May try with shrimp or sea scallops next time.

I used chicken, beef and shrimp (all marinated seperately) and another bag of vegetables (onions, peppers, squash and zucchini).  This was fantastic.   I let it marinade for over 24 hours.

Made these for a spring time bbq and they have been requested for every bbq since. Marinating for several hours is key to the amazing flavor. I let the chicken and veggies marinate overnight... These yummy little skewers have become a regular on our summer menu.

Very good but remember that it will burn easy if your heat is too hot because of the honey. My hubby forgot and it had a bit of a char. However the flavor inside was amazing!

I tried this just now after coming across the recipe earlier in the day. I didnt really enjoy it much. I would definitely add more spice next time as I found it too bland. I preferred the veggies more than the chicken somehow so would try with prawns & lots of veg instead next time. Marination for 6-7 hrs really wasnt enough. Would try it again for sure tho!

The sauce was quite salty and I used an already  "Lite" soya sauce.  Not sure what can be done to make it less salty.

I slice chicken breasts cross-wise and marinate in this for a couple hours, then grill for 10 minutes a side, basting with the marinade in the last few minutes.  Hubby and I both love it.  It's a keeper!

This was absolutely delicious, and I'm very critical!  I couldn't use the grill so I made it in the skillet like stir fry which I think gave it even more flavor.  I marinated it for about 4 hours and it was perfect, tons of flavor.  The pineapples make the meal in my opinion, and onions, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, and bell peppers are awesome too.  Highly recommended!

This is sooo good! The only thing I changed was adding the garlic into the marinade. I soaked the chicken in one ziploc bag and the veggies (green,yellow bell, onion, cherry tomatoes, green and yellow squash) in another for 24 hours or so turning over once at 12 hours. Next time I will be adding potatoes to the mix I think cuz my family cant eat a meal without some kind of potatoes! 

*Edit: Im making this again tonight but as whole chicken breasts, butterflied in half to make thinner and only getting to marinate about 6 hours. I bought honey mustard and provalone cheese to put on it and some onion poppy seed buns. CANT wait to eat this sandwhich tonight!

made a lot more of this than I needed, so doubled sauce and froze the chicken chunks in it. It was very good grilled the first time and even better when I grilled the second batch that had thawed out in the sauce. Eyeball the amount of veggies you want, 5 small onions seemed like a lot! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe and I am now into variations.  I added 1 tsp of ginger paste to the doubled marinade.  I sliced the garlic and gave it 15 seconds in a bit of the oil before adding to the marinade.  This ups the flavor.  I grilled the breasts whole and did the veggies in the oven since prep time was short and it was very good.  I will be trying this on pork also.  Pepper flakes would up the heat if desired.

I used the measurements listed for 4 chicken breasts and it was perfect. Absolutely delicious! I exchanged the vegetable oil for olive oil, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I also just grilled the breasts whole b/c we weren't in the mood for kabobs. Yum!!

These were exceptional!  We, too, doubled the sauce.  I would have paid $20 for these at a restaurant and would have no problem going back tomorrow for the same thing!  The kabobs were extremely moist!  Great recipe!

I was kind of disappointed with this recipe. I thought that after marinating the chicken and veggies for almost 12 hours that they would be bursting with flavour, but they just weren't. The chicken did come out moist and tender (I was sure not to over-cook it) but something was missing. I'll try again but add more to the marinade - some garlic and onion perhaps. Maybe increase the honey, because it turned out more runny than I had anticipated. A good recipe, but not an awesome recipe.

Instead of making kabobs we split the chicken in the 2 inch wide chicken breast strips, served on top of rice. SOO good! I only wish I made more sauce next time I'll make double and put half on the stove with a little corn starch to thicken. It's like a sweet teriyaki. Delectable!

I had this recipe at a friend's house over the summer and LOVED it! I made it for a Games Night dinner we had a month ago and there wasn't any chicken left! Great recipe and it smells amazing while grilling!

Very nice recipe I followed the directions exactly except I marinated the chicken and the vegetable individually, and threaded the chicken and vegetable on separate water soaked bamboo skewers for even cooking time.

These are excellent-- loved them. As with any recipe that calls for chicken on the grill you have to be careful not to over or under cook them. Watch the closely...

I was looking for an easy marinade that had plenty of flavor and this met the mark!  I think it needs another layer of flavor so next time I'll add fresh grated ginger.

AWESOME recipe. I have never been a kabob person but this recipe has completely changed that. I chanced it and made this recipe for the first time at a family barbecue we held recently and they were a big hit. Even my cousin who normally is not a veggie fan had several! Both the meat and veggies were delicious in this marinade.   I used some green, red, yellow, and orange sweet pepper, zucchini, and white onion. If your veggie strips aren't big enough they may crack and not stay on very well when you stick the skewers into them. Also note that when you cut the onion, you basically have to cut a big chunk and peel it into layers and slice it like you do the pepper. I didn't understand this originally and tried slicing in cubes but the onion just kept falling apart. No wonder!  I soaked the skewers for at least an hour or two prior to grilling but still had some burning of them during grilling. I recommend keeping them wet until as close to the time of grilling as possible. I also doubled the amount of marinade so we'd have plenty for basting during grilling. ENJOY!

These are so simple and really tasty. I did not marinate the vegies and they were fine. I pressed the garlic cloves and added them to the marinde along with the chicken. I made 1-1/2 times the sauce to make sure I had enough for basting during grilling and I had the perfect amount.  I grilled for about 20 minutes on the lowest heat my gas grill would do. The meat was very tender and juicy. I would make this again.

Very good flavor! Put whole frozen BLSL breasts in a resealable bag with the marinade and into the fridge to defrost for the day. The flavor was good, but not very strong this way. I cut the breasts into strips and threaded on skewers to grill. There were none left over! Very good sign! Next time I will take the time before marinading to cut into strips or cubes to give the marinade more surface area to cover. Thanks for a great recipe!

We really enjoyed these tonight!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, and I left out the bell peppers.  I marinated everything for 4 hours and it was perfect.  I plan on making this recipe several times on the grill this summer & then trying it with the broiler during the cold weather months. (PS- I used the lower sodium soy sauce & I think it was the right choice, especially since I cut the chicken thighs into small chunks.)

I made these for a friend and her family. She gave me the idea to coat the sticks with oil before placing veggies and chicken on them to keep them from sticking. Also, I did not realize how much time it would take to slide these onto each stick. Very good recipe.

These kabobs where a BIG hit! They lived up to all the reviews.  Make sure you soak the skewers for a couple hours or they will burn on the grill.  I also added pineapple to my skewers and it added the perfect touch.

Marinated my chicken for about 4 hours. Made as per the recipe. I used red pepper, pearl onions, and tomaotoes on my kabobs along w/ the chicken and had my husband grill the kabobs low and slow and nothing burnt. They were great.  Dont forget to soak your skewers in water so they dont burn.

This is a good marinade. I actually cooked the chicken two different ways because I ran out of propane after I cooked the first batch on the outdoor grill. The second batch, I didn’t skewer. I just put the chicken chunks (no vegies) on a cookie sheet and broiled them. They turned out better and moister in the oven maybe because sugar (honey) likes to burn on the grill.

Hands down, this is the best Chicken Kabob recipe to date. The flavor is unreal. This one is very popular among family and friends. Just ensure you make twice as much sauce to baste during the process. Also remember to separate one batch for vegetables and other for chicken. Dont mix the two. Also on the skewers, one skewer all chicken and other all vegetable since they have different cooking times. Also chicken has bacteria, you don't want that on your vegetables, if they are stacked on top of each other. Overall I am extremely pleased with this recipe. Thanks so much. Stan.

The flavor on this chicken is fantastic! I reduced the amount of soy sauce in half to avoid so much sodium. I marinated for 3 hours but next time I will keep it longer.  7/11/09 UPDATE: This is the second time I make this dish, this time I marinated overnight and it's even better. Thanks Ann Marie, this is our favorite!

Absolutely delicious marinade!  I did not grill these but instead I used chicken tenders, cut them into bite sized pieces and marinated the meat with some green peppers and onions.  I doubled the mixture and let it sit in the fridge for two hours or so.  I ended up just stir-frying this; you definitely want to double the marinade if are cooking this on the stove but I added the extra sauce at the end so the chicken got nice and golden brown.  Chicken was super tender!  Served this over rice and it was delectable.  I've only found this recipe two weeks ago and I've already made it four times!

I made these kabobs twice.  The first time the chicken marinated for maybe 5 minutes max and I dumped the extra marinade on top before I broiled them.  The next time, they marinated for 6 hours and both times the chicken was VERY tender.  I will be making this again and again!

This was great. The chicken was so tender. I did let the chicken marinade for an entire day though. I think next time, I might add extra honey and some pineapple just to make it sweeter.

Excellent recipe!  I made these for a large gathering, so I made an extra batch of the marinade, thickened it a little with cornstarch, then kept the cooked chicken smothered in the extra marinade on warm in a crock-pot.  Kept it very moist, and I received lots of compliments!  I will definately make again.

These are soooo good!  I use multi-colored peppers, pineapple chunks, boiling onions and sometimes mushrooms.  I am thinking of parboiling some small potatoes next time.  These are very tasty.  I serve over white rice with a fresh baked bread.  MMMMMMMM

Very good! I took this to a family get-together at a cabin we rented for Mother's Day. I made it up at home before we left & cooked it the next day. I  pounded the chicken just enough to get a uniform thickness so that the chicken would cook evenly, cut it in 2" cubes (I was afraid 1" cubes would overcook) being sure that they were uniform in size, placed it in a big baggie, & added the marinade. I cut up the veggies (adding mushrooms to the mix) & put those in separate baggies but I did not add the marinade until a couple of hours before I grilled them. I did add a bit of brown sugar to the marinade & also some crushed red pepper flakes. I added some chunk pineapple when I skewered them but I did not marinade the pineapple. Even though I used a low sodium soy sauce the marinade was still a bit salty.... not overly so but it might be if your soy sauce isn't low sodium. I served these with red skinned potato salad (from this site), spicy bean salsa (from this site) & tortilla chips (all of these dishes I made ahead of time). We ate very well at the cabin & I didn't have to spend my vacation in the kitchen!

Delicious. Colours beautifully and is moist as can be. Not sure what the garlic was for but I skewered it as well and it went down a treat. Served over brown rice with peas. Yum.

i'd say 3.5 stars.  chicken was quite good, but not extraordinary.  i'll likely make it again because my wife liked the teryaki-esque flavor of the chicken.  I didnt have mushrooms, but I bet they'd really add to this dish.

These are delicious!  I marinate the chicken and vegetables separately.  I often use this marinade for grilled chicken not on skewers too.  It's much quicker and just as good.

Wonderful!  I put chicken in one ziplock bag, veggies in another.  Doubled the marinade.  Used the veggy marinade to baste kabobs.  Thanks Ann Marie.

This is a delicious recipe! I've used the marinade for veggies on the grill, as well as a variety of poultry and seafood. If you use bamboo skewers, be sure to soak them in water for about an hour before grilling so they don't go up in flames.

This was a wonderful-tasting chicken.  I didn't "kabob" them, I marinated pounded chicken breasts in the oil, honey, soy and garlic for the day.  Then I baked them in the oven, with a side of fried rice.  I'm sure it will be even better on the grill, but in this freezing cold weather, the oven sounded pretty good!  Thanks!  I will make again.

This dish was okay and tasted fine but it is basically chicken teriyaki.  I prefer the Hawaiin Chicken Kabobs recipe.

This was GREAT!! Got complements on it at our Labor Day BBQ.  I also added some zucchinis and mushrooms.  I don't think anyone can go wrong with this fantastic recipe.  I didn't soak the skewers though.  Don't know what soaking it would do anyways.

I was worried about it being salty after reading other reviews, so I marinated the chicken overnight and didn't add the vegetables until morning.  I found it was rather bland, and lacking a little kick.  Everyone ate it just fine, but no one asked for the recipe.

Very good recipe.  Instead of making kabobs, I used chicken tenders and broiled them in oven for about 5 mins. per side.  Since I wasn't using onions, I added a little minced onion to the marinade.

Really easy and delicious - even the onions were sweet and tangy after soaking up the sauce. I would recommend putting foil at the ends of the wooden skewers if you plan on broiling in the oven.

Very good. I double the marinade and marinate the chicken and vegies separately and also skewer them separately. Very tasty. I've made these several times and everyone loves them.

This is in my regular chicken rotation! Marinate mine usually overnight-although still good even if marinated for the day. I add whatever type of veggies I have on hand- bell peppers,onions, mushrooms. No grill required, I broil or use the "grill"setting on my toaster oven- but still skewer it and rotate it accordingly. Delightful results!

As a vegetarian I can't comment personally on the flavour but what I can say is that my family love this recipe. The kids enjoy making their own Kebabs and they all love the taste. I tend to add a little bit of ginger and sometimes a little Chilli to change things up a bit. Very easy meal that the whole family can get involved with :-)

Great recipe. I made this for Super Bowl and everyone devoured them. People love this recipe. You can add diced pineapple on the skewers for a special touch. To the marinade I added a hint of pineapple juice and delicatessen mustard for a subtle bite. It was wonderful!

My favorite thing ever now. The marinade makes the chicken coated in a sugar but not too sweet crunch. Easy and great for having on a Saturday afternoon.

Loved it!  I doubled the marinade and only added a pinch of ginger.  I let it sit for a few hours before I added the chicken.  I skimmed some of the oil off the top.  
I have NO idea how people can have mushy chicken.  It was perfect!  Added tomatoes, sweet peppers, pineapple, eggplant and squash.  It was a perfect meal!!

This is a great recipe. I  changed it some. I used EVOO instead of vegi oil, Blue Agave instead of honey. I added fresh ginger about a tablespoon grated and a teaspoon of ground cumin. I also added a 1/2 tablespoon of rice vinegar it cuts the saltiness of the soy sauce.

These are so delicious and tender. Don't pack them too tight on the skewers or they won't cook thoroughly.

These were good. Instead of making kabobs, I baked chicken tenders in the sauce at 375 degrees for 20 minutes.

this is a keeper!! I love, love this recipe, 1st because it is so simple to make and it is super flavourful! I didn't want to put in the extra work and decided to skip out on the skewers, what can I say? the less I have to do the better! so still put the chicken on the grill and grilled veggies w/pineapple chunks in a grill basket! I was in heaven!! I did also add mushrooms and zuchini! OMG! try it you will not be disappointed! remember to save some extra sauce to baste on as you cook chicken on the grill!
UPDATE ON MY REVIEW!
double the sauce! I added asparagus to the veggies! awwwmazing!

Wow! I followed everything (except I didn't have any peppers). I let it soak in the marinade for a couple hours then just dumped the whole thing in a skillet on med-high heat and cooked it, then spooned it over jasmine rice with broccoli on top..... SO DELISH. Thank you for yet another great way to fix chicken! :)

Just made this recipe a couple of nights ago for 30 guests and it was the first item on the menu to be gone!!! And everyone from the kids to the adults wished there was more to take home. I added a little ginger, and because I don't have a grill, I just arranged all the ingredients in a 13x9 pan just like I would if i had skewers and a grill and baked at 350 for 30 minutes and it came out perfect! Making it again tonight :-) and so cheap to make too.

These were excellent!  Made them for a large family birthday over the weekend, marinated overnight and only did cubes of chicken (no veggies) as I made a few different salads and fresh cut veggies/dip to serve alongside.  They were a hit with adults and kids and came out nice and tender and full of flavour!  Will make again :)

I had such high hopes for this recipe, as there are several five-star reviews.  I did what most said--marinate, the longer the better.  I let my chicken marinate for at least 8 hours.  It was inedible when it came off the grill.  While it looked tasty, it had a gummy texture and just disintegrated from the inside out.  It was gross (and it wasn't overcooked or undercooked).  I think the chicken was over-marinated, and something in the marinade broke down the chicken.

These were delicious!  I added about 6 garlic cloves to the marinade and some fresh grated gingeroot.I used canola oil instead of vegetable  because it's what I had, and also added a few drops sesame oil. I was surprised how flavorful these were for just a few ingredients in the marinade.  I doubled the marinade, saved some for basting and divided the rest in between 2 Ziploc bags and marinated the chicken and vegetables separately overnight.  I used red onions, red and green bell peppers, mushrooms , zucchini and yellow summer squash. I soaked my wooden skewers and put the vegetables on some  and put the chicken on separate skewers with a pineapple chunk in between each piece of meat. Served with steamed rice and King Hawaiian Rolls. Very yummy, just like the title says! Will be made again, thanks.

Fried the chicken pieces in a pan with part of the marinade until the marinade evaporated and made a yummy glaze on the chicken.

Use this recipe often with a little addition of minced fresh ginger and sometimes fresh chili.  I've made it with roasted chicken breast and also with chopped chicken thigh on the stovetop and cook the vegetables and throw them in towards te end.  Always turns out very tasty.  I serve it with egg fried rice and brocollini or pak choi salad.

So, I made this but doubled the sauce and used olive oil instead of vegetable.  I also added cayenne and crushed red pepper for spice.  Another thing I did was bake the dish vs grilling it.  I used 325 setting and set the kabobs in for 15 minutes.  After that I turned them and baked for 10 more minutes.  Once this was all done, I flipped the chicken again and basted with the marinade.  I turned the oven on broil and set it for 400.  Left it in for two minutes, turned, basted and left it in for two more minutes.  Chicken came out tender, tasty and peppers were great!  I served this over a bed of white rice.  Everyone loved it, and will cook again!

YUMMY!  My husband LOVES this!  It glazes so nicely over the grill!  This became a family hit from the beginning!  I also separate my raw chicken and the vegetables and grill them separately because the chicken takes longer to grill than the vegetables.  :)

I'd give this a 5 star rating but I think this was more of a teriyaki chicken than honey. It had a good taste to it and my kids loved it. I'll make it again but I may try to reduce the amount of soy sauce.

Insanely delicious!!  I used 3 large breasts with the same amount of marinade and added mushrooms to the kabobs and doubled the garlic minced and added to marinades. Marinated 24 hours. OMG I will be making this again!  Great job Ann Marie!

You have to at least double the sauce. I had six chicken breasts which I left whole and marinated overnight. My veggie skewers were mushrooms, zucchini, vidalia onions, green, yellow, and red peppers which I ended up basting because I didn't have enough sauce to marinate. I ended up making four batches of sauce because I wanted some on the table. I served this with Asian Coconut Rice from this site (among too many other things). The sauce is easy and so amazingly great! I'm making this again this week.

My husband and I loved this marinade! We used three chicken breasts and marinated the bell peppers and onions with the chicken. We also marinated overnight and added other vegetables before grilling. The result was DELICIOUS.

I made the full amount of marinade for just two large boneless skinless chicken breast halves, which did turn out to be too much, so I may scale that back next time.  I used part of the marinade to marinate the chicken and veggies (separately), used part to baste on while grilling and served the rest at the table for anyone who wanted additional for drizzling.   I skewered the chicken separately from the veggies (I used red, yellow and orange bell peppers, onion and zucchini), grilled the veggies first and removed them to a warm oven, and then grilled the chicken.  No chance of overcooking the chicken that way.  This was very good and one we’ll be enjoying again!

This recipe was amazing! My husband asked for it again a few days after the first batch; thst uncommon. Let it marinate all day along with the veggies and make sure you smear some on while you're grilling for the extra glaze and taste. Keeping this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This was very good....followed the advice of others and doubled the marinade, marinated the chicken and veggies in separate bags, and put a little bit of minced ginger in the marinade.  Very good, will make again.

The sauce in and of its self is fantastic and has become a staple in our house. We love adding a heaping scoop of garlic and marinading pork, steak tips, and even salmon with it. 

We would reccomend this for anyone and everyone to try!! 

Great recipe Ann Marie!!

Loved this recipe! We added Pineapple and tomato to the kabob and it was delicious! Also made a small modification by using minced garlic in the marinade. It was so good.

Easy. Yummy. :) Also marinated green peppers and mushrooms separately and they turned out well. Note: the chicken was not super sweet tasting, however the sliced green peppers (baked the chicken and sauteed the peppers and mushrooms) were quite sweet tasting. I think cooking the food in the sauce brought the sweetness of the honey to the forefront.

I've made this recipe twice already! MMM MMM MMM MMM MMM! I followed exactly, but made separate marinates for the chicken, bell peppers, and onions. It was easier for me to put together the skewers when the three ingredients are separated. I grilled them about 5 1/2 mins per side and they came out PERFECT! Thank you for the great recipe!

Trust the reviews on this recipe. It is awesome! I used it with chicken and sirloin steak and they were both amazing! Like one reviewer said, marinate at the end of grilling. Because there is veggie oil in the sauce, it will get your grill flaring and you don't want to burn the meat. Marinate as long as you can. I only had about 6 hours and it was great. I can only imagine what overnight would taste like. You have to double the marinade or you will not have enough. These come out sweet and juicy. You don't even taste the soy sauce,  just a sweet and moist meant flavor. I will be using this recipie over and over. Thanks Ann Marie!!

I didn't like the pepper in the marinade and I will attempt it again without the pepper.  It's funny because I love pepper but just didn't think that it tasted right with this marinade.  I also doubled the sauce so I would have plenty for basting.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could! :D
I doubled marinade as others (marinated veggies separate) & added pineapple chunks too, served over a bed of Orzo. Thanks for all the suggestions and to the person who posted this...It's AMAZINGLY GOOD!!!

These were yummy! I twisted the chicken onto skewers- it looks nicer and I think it tastes better than cubes because you're less likely to overcook the chicken. I made twice the marinade to use half on the veggies- mushrooms, onions, zucchini and squash.

It was too late to grill the kabobs, so I sauteed it in a nonstick pan and served it with rice.  My whole family loved it!  Will definitely make again.  Served with fresh broccoli also.

This is a very good marinade, next time, I will add red pepper flakes and more garlic. I used low sodium soy sauce, so it needed more salt. I used boneless thighs, cut in small cubes, preference over breasts. Also used zuchins cubed, and fresh pineapple cubes. Follow Sous Andy's review about grill temp. It worked for me.

Very good.. but next time I'll be sure to make extra marinade so that I can save more to brush on while grilling.  I marinaded it for about 4 hours and brushed some on, but it didn't have as much flavor as I wanted. Will definitely make again!

My kids and hubby loved this recipe!  I'm glad I read the reviews and also doubled the marinade!  This was key!  I separated the veggies and chicken to marinade (I'm a vegetarian) and then drained the marinade from the veggies to baste the chicken while cooking!  This is a keeper and will definitely make again!!

OH MY THIS IS SO SIMPLE AND DELICIOUS!!!  I had a small dinner party and EVERYONE loved these! I followed all the hints from Sous Andy, which were very helpful since I had never grilled kabobs before.  I marinated overnight.  The flavor was perfect!  I will be making these again and again!

Love these! Make them all the time. I spice it up a bit with some chili powder (not much!!) and some crushed red pepper. It makes a beautiful sweet/spicy mix. It's also awesome on salmon. Highly recommended!

I thought this tasted pretty good accept two things. The honey caused the meat and vegetables to blacken much quicker than other kabobs I have made and the kabobs didn't seem to have much flavor over just cooking meat and veggies on a stick without seasoning or a marinade. Although, it was good it had no distinct flavor. I did half of them on a grill and half in the broiler in the house and had the same results taste and appearance wise.

These were delish! My husband will eat anything, but is VERY honest about what he likes and wants again. He said this was amazing and he wants it on the "weekly" menu! I used half of each: red, orange, yellow, and green pepper. Also one large yellow onion. Cut them into big chunks and placed in a big ziplock. Then cut up two decent sized chicken breasts and put them in a separate ziplock. I doubled the sauce and put half in each bag. Placed both in fridge for 7-8 hours, assembled kabobs, and grilled. Served with baked potatoes....yumm! Great easy recipe!

These are the BEST kabobs! The trick is to quadrouple the marinade. Marinade the chicken overnight. The next day   use   2 large sweet Texas 1015  onions or Vidalia onions and  4 sweet bell peppers  such as red, yellow and orange, and 2 8 oz pkg whole mushrooms and add to the chicken  in large freezer bags and marinade atleast 2 hours.  Using only sweet  onions and adding mushrooms really makes this recipe over the top amazing. I  have taken these to several pot lucks and so many people have requested the recipe.

Very tasty.  I look forward to skewering them next time and cooking them on the grill.  I just cooked them up in a skillet and served with rice pilaf, as I was feeling a little lazy.  The sauce was very tasty.  I minced the garlic and put it in the marinade and marinated just the chicken for about 3 hours. Then I added the veges and let them marinate for about 1/2 hour.  I cooked some fresh mushrooms in the skillet until they released their juices and then added the marinade with the chicken and veges.  I used the reserved marinade to make home made rice pilaf.  Thanks for the recipe it is a keeper!

I made this recipe exactly as written but wish that I had followed my instincts to add more garlic and maybe some fresh grated ginger. The chicken was tender but salty and the flavor was just, well...sort of dull.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband loved them! I marinated the chicken for about eight hours, the veggies (I used red onion, red pepper and orange pepper) for three hours and then threw some pineapple chunks in for about twenty mins. Since it was raining I threw these puppies under the boiler for about 15 mins on High and they turned out delicious! I doubled the amount of garlic and put it right into the marinade as well as added about a tsp of minced ginger, a TBS of brown sugar and a dash of red pepper for some kick.

This is my families FAVORITE chicken marinade. You don't have nearly enough sauce. I make one serving for the chicken, one serving for veggies, and one serving to baste on the chicken and veggies while grilling. I also added pineapple which taste amazing in this marinade. I pair it with homemade honey mustard dipping sauce that taste great with the chicken AND veggies:
1 C. Mayo
3 T honey
3 T Mustard
1 t. orange juice (can be omitted)
Horseradish to taste

Absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was I used extra virgin olive oil instead of veg. oil because that's all I had.  I only let it marinate for about 30 minutes, I think the basting towards the end is more important than the marinating.  I used chicken, red pepper, onion, and pineapple.  Definitely a keeper!

This is the best marinade I've found for chicken so far. It works well with pork too. I also tried it with beef, which was good but it didn't soak up as much flavor. I only marinated for about 4-5 hours and they had plenty of flavor. But next time I will marinate longer.

Very good.  Usually find kabobs to be on the dry side, but each time we've done these, they haven't been, and they have a good flavor.  I like to be able to marinate it for 5 hours plus.  We use mushrooms, onions, sweet peppers, chicken, and cherry tomatoes (tried pineapple once and didn't care for).  3 big breasts can make 10-12 skewers.  My husband isn't the biggest fan, however, made for my 20+ family this summer and got rave reviews.

Wonderful!  The best kabobs I've made!  The chicken had an exceptional flavor and was quite moist and tender.  I included pineapple with the vegetables which is a must.

The best!  The chicken always comes out tender, juicy and delicious!  I like to add lots of chopped garlic and pineapple juice to the marinade.  I grill the chicken on separate skewers and do bell pepper, yellow squash and pineapple on the others.  Yum!

My family has used this recipe since the 70's and it is absolutely delish!!! Of course you can use this on Chix Wings which come out just as good AND if you minus the honey, it's a wonderful marinade a Pork Tenderloin. Cook the Pork Tenderloin on low, it stays moist!!!

Yummy! Made the marinade with all of the suggested quantities. I did, however, use 6 chicken breast halves. I used pearl onions in place of regular onions, and I added pineapple chunks and button mushrooms (which turned out awesome). I used my "marinator" attachment for my FoodSaver, which cut my marinating time to about 6 minutes! Next time, I will add a little more honey. Great!

Pretty delicious. Had it with a side of steamed white rice with a touch of soy on it. Also added pineapple to the veggie skewers. Great summer BBQ food!

Just awesome!  My family loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, the only thing I would do different the next time is to use a low sodium soy sauce.  I did marinade it for several hours which let all the yummy soy and honey just soak into the chicken.  OMG this is a winner and I'll make this again and again and again. :o)

I made this for Mother's Day tonight and she commented that it is some of the best chicken I have thrown together.  I did make a few slight revisions: used 4 chicken breasts but kept the measurements the same for everything else, subbed evoo for veggie oil, added an extra 3 cloves of garlic (that's standard in my fam) and didn't add in the veggies to the marinade.  Poked holes in the chicken breasts, cut them into chunks, mixed into the marinade, and then let sit for 5.5 hours before grilling.  Loved that the soy/honey mixture almost left a sort of glaze on the chicken.  Thank you for sharing!!  :)

YUMMY is indeed an accurate description! I'd have no hesitation on making this for company, but Hubby and I will probably enjoy this many times all by ourselves. :-) Adding fresh pineapple was the only change I made here. Doing separate skewers for meat and veggies is a great plan, but all seemed to get done about the same time. You won't be sorry if you make this dish.

Found this to be really tasty. Instead of using kabobs, I placed foil on the grill, and sprayed it with non-stick. I served it over brown rice. Also I made extra sauce (oil, honey, and soy sauce) to drizzle over the chicken and rice. Yummmmy! I also added sliced zucchini to the mix=)

Really great Marinade! I also added 1/2 tsp of ginger to spice it up a little more. Also I used only 4 chicken breast so if you are making 8 I'd suggest doubling the marinade.

These tasted good. But next time I think I'll marinate them a little longer than 2 hours to get more flavor. The chicken was cooked just right so it was nice and tender. I used pineapples and cherry tomatoes for the kabobs and they looked great.

We didn't have any skewers on hand, so I made this into a stiry fry and served over brown rice.  I did double the recipe for the marinade, and soaked my chicken separately from the veggies. When the veggies came out of the marinade, I boiled it down to make more sauce. YUM! One of my family's new favorites!!!

Very good an easy to make. I would recommend mushrooms as they seemed to be the biggest hit and I did marinate them for 24 hours….

I doubled the marinade.. a must. It ended up marinading for about 7 hours. Really good! I'm not usually a fan of sweet flavored meats (honey, terayaki, etc.) but this was fantastic!

Excellent recipe! I only used the red bell peppers with the chicken on the kabobs and added some minced garlic and onion powder to the marinade. I cooked them on my George Foreman and the were wonderful! Very authentic tasting.

This was delicious! I marinated chicken breasts in the mixture (I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil)and just threw the whole breasts on the grill. I didn't baste or anything. The marinade seemed to lock in the juices and the end result was juicy, flavorful chicken breasts. Thanks, Ann Marie,for sharing a great recipe which my family will enjoy for many meals to come!

This recipe was outstanding my hubby said it tasted like the skewers we order at a local Vietnamese restaurant. I made two batches of the marinade one for the chicken and one for the veggies in the veggie marinade I substituted the vegetable oil with sesame oil.Chicken was delicious juicy and tender everyone loved it, the kids even gobbled up the veggies, I used cherry tomatoes, onions, red and green peppers and mushrooms. I didn't think it was going to be as great as it was because of the simple ingredients but now it will be on our regular summer menu!

Great Recipe!  I used light soy, and I marinated the chicken overnight (+/- 18 hours).  I put the marinade into a gallon ziplock (made one for chicken, and one for veggies, and one for shrimp).  Everyone loved everything!  Even my mother ...who is picky.  Will definately use again!  I marinated zucchini, baby bella mushrooms, onions and red pepers.  We are new to grilling, and this made us look like we knew what we were doing!  Thanks for sharing!

I made just the marinade to use with boneless skinless chicken breasts on the grill. Served over white rice. It was good. My family liked it and I've made it a few times. I have made a double batch of the marinade and froze it with the chicken breasts (uncooked) so that they thaw in the marinade and are ready for the grill.

This was great! Don't have a grill so I broiled them in the oven. The veggies I marinated in EVOO and the regular spices. This was our Superbowl grub! =D

This was pretty good, but I like the Hawaiian chicken kabob recipe on this website a little better because it calls for the addition of ginger & pineapple, plus the sherry makes the meat more tender than this one.  I wish I had reduced the remaining marinade in a sauce pan to drizzle over the finished kabobs and brown rice, but I threw it away before I remembered to make sauce. :-(

This dish turned out pretty good. Since I was only cooking for 4 people, I scaled back the amount of chicken and vegetables I used, but I did prepare the full amount of sauce, since some reviewers said there wasn't enough. I used 2 whole chicken breasts (which made 42 chunks of meat), 1 large yellow onion (cut into 8 chunks), and 1 green bell pepper (cut into 10 pieces). I prepared the marinade in a small bowl and then poured 1/3 of it into a quart-size ziplock bag with the onions and green peppers. I put the remaining 2/3 of the marinade in a gallon-size ziplock bag with the meat, and I put both bags in the fridge to marinate for about 15 hours. When I assembled the kabobs the next day, I ended up with 2 skewers of vegetables and 7 skewers of meat. I discarded the meat's marinade, but I kept the vegetables' marinade to baste the skewers with during cooking. The meat turned out sweet and tasty, and since I did the prep the night before, it took less than 30 minutes to assemble and grill the kabobs. Next time I will use 2 green peppers instead of 1, and I will use a low-sodium soy sauce. Remember to turn over the bags of meat and vegetables several times during the marinating process, and to soak the wooden skewers for a couple of hours before grilling. I served these kabobs with "Spinach and Red Pepper Couscous" from this site.

This was wonderful and easy. I have made it twice and the longer I let mixture marinate, the better. Also, we had some leftovers (not yet grilled) in the fridge so we threw in a wok and made a stirfry. Also, use pineapple chunks too... they're delicious in the marinade!

This marinade was just perfect! The best I have ever tasted. I wrapped the chicken in bacon before cooking, and added pineapple to the skewers. Outstanding, quality meal that I would be proud to show off to company.

So delicious, I wanted to make them again the very next night! I agree with previous posts: make twice the sauce, and marinate for as long as you can...I did for just over an hour and they turned out very flavorful. DO NOT use vegetable oil, I had to throw that marinade out...use olive oil or grapeseed or sunflower oil, something that won't take away from the honey and the garlic. Thanks for this fantastic and reusable recipe...next time I'll mince the garlic instead of just chunks, and I'll add more garlic, that way it's like yummy honey garlic chicken...and I imagine that this sauce would work very well with wings too!

So often when I have kabobs, it seems like they do not hold their flavor. I marinated this for over 24 hours, and they held the flavor VERY well. I only used chicken...no vegetables. Tasted GREAT!

The chicken breasts from Costco must be bigger than normal since I didn't seem to have enough of the marinade so I just made up another batch.  They were very yummy so name is appropriate.  I would probably add more veggies next time as well since the peppers and onions were delish!

The chicken turns out amazing!!!
I put the veggies in a grill basket...much easier than threading them all.  Chicken is all on kabobs.  I also cut fresh pineapple rings and grill those for a little extra sweetness to the meal.  Just a perfect summer dish!

This marinade was great!  I marinated the chicken, some steak, and the mushrooms.  I used this recipe along with the one for chicken and bacon shish kabobs.  Together, they were amazing.  All my guests were very impressed.  Thanks for the great marinate!

These were a good start, but not nearly as flavorful as I had hoped-might need to marinate longer.

I was really looking forward to this recipe...followed it EXACTLY as described and used fresh chicken breast.  I did not care for this recipe.  It tasted like burnt soy sauce on the grill, even when cooked at a low temp.  The honey is just not coming through at all.  Way too much soy sauce in this recipe.

I used 4 chicken breasts, added pineapple juice to the marinade, and cut the soy sauce in half.  I also let it sit over night.  It was very good.  My husband really liked it.

We loved this dish! I did make a few changes based on other reviewers ratings - there are only 2 of us so I only used 2 (large) chicken breasts and 1 of each kind of pepper, 1/2 onion, and added portabella mushrooms but I still made all of the marinade. I also added most of the juice from a can of pineapple (real pineapple juice, NOT syrup) then marinaded everything except the pineapple overnight. When I made the kabobs I put the chicken and pineapple together and the veggies on separate sticks. We had it over a bed of rice and it was SO delicious. I definitely think the pineapple gave it that extra kick of taste though.

These were very good. I added the pineapple to the skewers as well as some tomatoes and mushrooms that I marinated overnight with the chicken, onions and peppers. The taste was OK (for me), but my husband LOVED it. It's a personal preference I'm sure. I'll make again, although I may add white rice as a side dish. I had an unexpected emergency and so we ended up just eating the kabobs. I think I just needed something else.

I’ve been a member of this wonderful site for 6 years and I believe this is the first review I have ever written!  I feel compelled to do so because these kabobs are off the chart yummy!!!  Our daughter (21 months) loved, loved, loved this and asked for seconds.  Not too sweet and very tender.  We made the whole amount of the marinade but adjusted the chicken and veggies to suit our small family (3 chicken breasts, 1 Vidalia onion, & 1/2 each red and orange bell pepper).  We skewered the chicken, peppers, and onions separately and they grilled up in no time.  Served with red mashed potatoes and steamed green beans.  It was a perfectly delicious summer dinner (with a little left over to toss on a salad for lunch the next day!)  Yummy!!!

These kabobs are so good! I made it exactly from the recipe and followed the advice of another reviewer to put like items on the skewers (instead of a combination) to better control each foods grilling time and they came out perfect. Awesome advice and an awesome recipe. Thanks!

The first words out of my son's mouth were "OMG this is awesome Mom! This is definitely a 5!"  This was so good.  I added a few red pepper flakes to the marinade and let it marinade for about 2 hours.  I also used whole boneless breasts instead of kabobs.  This will definitely be a repeat this summer on the bbq!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE. THE FLAVOR OF THE CHICKEN CAME OUT JUST FABULOUS. I WOULD MARINATE ALL DAY OR OVERNITE. DEFINITELY, DOUBLE THE RECIPE FOR THE VEGGIES AND THE CHICKEN. I NEVER MARINATE THEM TOGETHER AND I THOUGHT THE THE CHERRY TOMATOES WAS TERRIBLE IN THIS. THE ONIONS HOWEVER WERE OUTSTANIND PLUS I ADDED 2 CANS OF CHUNCK PINEAPPLE AND USED SOME OF THE JUICE IN THE MARINADE FOR THE VEGGIES. HMMMMMMMMM!!!!!! THIS MARINADE MIGHT BE GOOD ON SHRIMP, I WILL HAVE TO TRY THAT NEXT TIME. THIS IS A KEEPER. I USED RED AND ORANGE, YELLOW, BELL PEPPER,2 KINDS OF ONION, MUSHROOMS, CHERRY TOMATOES (YUCK) AND PINEAPPLE.

We absolutely loved this.  I made it for the first time a little over a week ago and it has already been requested again.  I HIGHLY recommend at least doubling the marinade.  I did a few things different from the base recipe.  I marinated everything overnight and put the veggies and chicken in separate containers.  As for ingredient changes, I used olive oil (b/c I didn't have veg oil on hand).  Second, I added about 1/4 c or so of pineapple juice (b/c a pp recommended it and I had just a little bit to get rid of; honestly though, I didn’t taste it at all, so I probably won’t add it this time  b/c I don’t have any sitting around).  Also I used a little less soy sauce (but again I don't think that mattered one bit) and finally I added a more garlic b/c my husband and I love garlic.  This time around I plan to add some shrimp and mushrooms.  My husband said it is one of the best things I've ever gotten off this site.  Thanks!!

Have made this many, many times, and all turned out quite well.  I add 1 tsp. of sesame oil and a few drops of liquid smoke.  I've used mushrooms, squash, and zucchini too, which were terrific!  I like to double the marinade, use 1/2 for chicken, and 1/2 in a separate bag of veggies.

WOW!!  So easy to make....I marinated this for about 26 hours and threw the whole boneless chicken breast on the charcoal grill.  It was EXCELLENT!  Very subtle flavor and so tasty!  I will be using this for a long time. UPDATE- I used this recipe again tonight using NY Strip steak and added 1/4 cup pineapple juice....Got rave reviews from my guests....Thanks so much!

Delicious!  My husband declared these the best BBQ chicken he's ever had -- and we do a LOT of grilling!  Haven't seen my fussy kids eat that much in a long time.  

I only marinated for an hour due to time constraints, but it worked out beautifully.  I highly recommend this - especially since it's made from all ingredients you probably already have in the house.

Very good, only giving a four because I made alterations.  I added canned, sliced pineapple (no sugar added, in juice, not syrup), and added the juice to the marinade, along with teriyaki.  Delicious!

I used for a stir fry and it came out wonderful.  Only change I made was to add chopped fresh ginger to marinade, then stir-fried it with day old rice and frozen broccoli/carrots.  Loved it!

Amazing.  We didn't have garlic so I used some garlic powder.  We also didn't have many veggies, so I just used onion.  I put the BBQ on med-low as the chicken pieces I cut were small.  I'm in love with this recipe!!!!

This was not our favorite recipe, sorry. The flavor was a little bland, and had a harsh aftertaste.

These were pretty good. I marinated the chicken and veggies for six hours. I would recommend marinating for 24 hrs or more. I cooked on the broiler...I'm sure it would be better on the grill. I'll try marinating longer and on the grill next time.

These were excellent!!  I didn't change the recipe at all and I won't when I make them again, either.  I put the chicken and vegetables on separate skewers so the veggies wouldn't burn.  My kids (14 mo. and 2 1/2 yrs.) ate these up.  Thank you!!

I think this is a 4, the boyfriend thinks it is a 5.  I thought the chicken was a bit dry, but then again, I did it under the broiler, not the grill.  I scoured through each of these reviews for some advice as to how long to broil since we don't have a grill and finally found a reviewer that said 5 minutes per side.  I wish I would have listened, however, boyfriend said to keep cooking them because he likes everything well done.  I think 5 minutes per side would be perfect for the chicken if you are broiling it.  I took the veggies out probably around 4 min per side.  I think the mushrooms (decided to use them) were the best veggies, but so were the red peppers.  The tomatoes were mushy, but were still good with a generous helping of salt.  Overall good recipe.  Boyfriend said it 'rocked' more than once.  I marinated both vegs and chicken (separately) for 24 hours.  Tripled the marinade so I could use the 3rd helping for basting.

Very tasty. I marinated overnight since I always find that meat marinated for 12 hours  or more has more flavor. I used the Costco frozen chicken tenders. Defrosted slightly and then poured marinate over and left in frige overnight. Before putting on grill I threaded them on a kebob stick- no need tro cut tenders. I suggest making extra marniate or reserving some to brush on when grilling. I had tried to boil the left over marinate to use and the result was a lumpy mess with some cooked chicken fat. It worked fine as a marinade when I strained it off- but would have been easier if I had reserved some marinade or made extra.

These were yummy. Even my very fussy 2 and 4 year old loved them. I soaked the skewers in cold water for about 30 mins before skewering the chicken and putting them on waxed paper, then popped them in the oven at 190C for about 20 mins. Perfect.

Very Good... everyone raved about this.  I took mushrooms,tomatoes, and green peppers and wrapped them in aluminum foil and grilled them that way instead of skewering them.  Also grilled pineapple rings with it.  So delicious!!!

This was good but I made some changes just for family preference. I used 1/2 cup of honey and I added a 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes. This made it sweet, salty and a little spicy...wonderful.

excellent recipe!  The kabobs were a huge hit at a cook-out we hosted. the marinade was delicious. every other kabob i have ever eaten has been so bland but this marinade was the best. One note--if you aren't a grilling expert (like me) make sure you use metal skewers or you pre-soak the wooden skewers so they don't catch on fire!) minor detail!

We used this recipe when we had everyone over for the super bowl 2005 and it was a big hit.  I made the sauce and put chicken, red pepper, onions and other veggies in 2 gallon size aip locks and let them sit in the frig til 5pm.  the food soaked for 8hrs and was absolutley awesome!  My husband grilled the kbobs and they were gone as soon as we put them out.  People coiuld not get enough of them!  I ended up printing this recipe for several friends before they left that evening.  Thanks for the big hit and what's even better than that is that this recipe is so EASY!

This is the BEST marinade ever! I could eat it with a spoon! I marinate the chicken and vegetables seperately in ziplock bags overnight and then skewer them before grilling. I LOVE this recipe because it doesn't call for any unusual items and I always have all the ingredients on hand.

I absolutely loved this marinade!!  It was so easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  The veggies were great after four hours, but the chicken would have been better had it been marinated overnight.  Like others suggested, watch the chicken gets done and maybe try grilling meat on separate skewers.  I had some trouble getting the chicken thoroughly cooked while not burning the veggies.

This was a nice change of pace from my usual garlic and olive oil broiled chicken. I just did whole boneless skinless breasts in the broiler, after they'd been marinating for about 3 hours. It was great! I sort of basted the breasts with the marinade while in the broiler for an extra crispy top to the chicken. Thanks!

A little too salty - maybe use less soy sauce. I used this recipe for a stir fry (with green peppers and chives) instead of grilling and it came out very nice.

Absolutley LOVE this recipe!  I've made it 3 times in less than a month.  The longer you marinate the better it is.  I also used the marinade for chicken breast, and didn't do the kabobs, but it is YUMMY, just like the title!

This was fantastic as is. My 10 year old even ate his first pepper as a result...and he didn't die like he thought he would.

Made it last night for Sunday night grill.  Only marinated it 2 hrs and grilled the kabobs on medium low for 15 minutes.  The seasoning was perfect, veggies were charred and crisp and the chicken was so moist and tender.  I used low sodium soy sauce, I think it would be too salty using regular.  It's a keeper, thanks.  Oh, I did double the sauce as well.

I  made this recipe over the weekend and we absolutely loved it!!!   These were the best chicken kabobs we've ever had. I did follow the recommendations of others and increased the amount of marinade so that I could have some put aside for the basting. But I will say next time I will not marinade my onions as long as I did the other vegetables with the meat because they were way too soft when it came time for the skewer. I marinated my vegetables overnight and I think the next time I will just put the onions in a few hours before I'm ready to cook them. in addition to the onions and red and green  peppers I also added some yellow summer squash.  This will be one of our favorite meals!

Made this with my 8 yr. old on Father's Day so my husband isn't have to cook. Had to skip onions due to allergies, but all 3 boys (ages 8 to 15) enjoyed it and want to try it again. Put some homegrown cherry tomatoes on a few skewers and they were great too. 8 breasts gave us enough  meat for 15 full skewers. Next time, will probably put squash or mushrooms on a few and decrease the amount of chicken a little. Glad it pleased the whole family. Not easy to do.

Wonderful recipe! So simple, but so, so good! Really the perfect kabob marinade. You do not have to stick to just onions & peppers for the veg--- zucchini, pineapple, & mushrooms are great additions. 
Modifications:: I added a few extra garlic cloves, as well as a 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne because my husband & I like it spicy.

Yummy!! My family loves this recipe! We add any vegetable we can think of....zucchini, onions, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms. We have made this numerous times for company and have had nothing but rave reviews. I even took them camping one year! I marinated the chicken and the vegetables, then in the morning, skewered them, then put them in freezer bags and froze them. When we left for camping I made an extra side of marinade for basting. They were incredible! Our camping neighbours ended up joining us for supper because they smelled so good while cooking! Note: I normally marinade the chicken and veggies separately. I always double the recipe because with two teens in the house....one batch is simply not enough!

This came out great. I couldn't tell time it takes a while to put everything on the Kabob sticks. I actually had extra and cooked it up in a tin foil bag and we ate it as left overs during the week.

Not good. Followed the recipe. Marinated chicken and mushrooms 2 hours. Turned out mushy, and tasting like soy sauce only. Grilled with peppers, onions, pineapple...A waste of ingredients. This recipe has taught me to not only look at the top reviews, look at the worst. I should have read the most critical comments first on this recipe. Also, I no longer trust the popularity count as attestation to goodness!

I made this as stir fry.  I made a double recipe of the sauce and added some teriyaki sauce to it too.  I used 2 vidalia onions cut into strips, red and yellow peppers cut into ¼ inch strips, yellow squash, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, 2 cans of sliced water chestnuts.  I mixed the sauce and added the garlic cloves to it and then added all the veggies to it in a plastic bag.  I used 3 large chicken breasts, cut into small pieces, and made another  recipe of the sauce with some teriyaki and garlic and put it into a separate bag and added my chicken pieces.  I marinated it all for about 3 hrs.  I poured most of the sauce from the veggies, but about ¾ of a cup,  into a pan and added my veggies.  I drained the chicken and discarded the sauce from it and added the chicken to the same pan.  It was just delicious.  You really can add any veggies that you want.  I didn’t have any mushrooms or would have added that too. I made white rice and we put it over the rice.  We would have topped it with Chinese noodles but didn’t have a can of them.   My husband raved about it and ate it for 2 days

Doubled the sauce and was just the right amount.  We also marinated longer - 3 1/2 hours and used the ingredients as recipe called for.  We used fresh mushrooms, red onion and the red peppers....very very good!

This recipe is a SUPER hit.  This was the first time I had ever made kabobs. Now my family and friends think I'm an expert cook. I used chicken, asparagus pieces, onion, green, orange and yellow sweet bell peppers and fresh mushrooms on the kabob skewer. The only real change I made to the recipe was to mince the garlic instead of putting in whole garlic cloves.  The colors made the kabobs look so good! I marinated all the vegetables and chicken overnight with the minced garlic - yum.  It started raining, so I had to go to plan B and use the broiler on my gas oven, but the kabobs still turned out awesome.  The look and taste was just perfect.  Thank you Allecipes your making me look and taste good!

Really good, very pretty - company worthy meal! I marinated it overnight and I think that is important to get the true honey glaze effect.  Not only is it easy, it's something different to do with the ever available in my freezer chicken breasts.  My only issue was getting the chicken cooked just right, it cooks faster than I expected and ended up a little dry.  Next time I'll start the veggies at the same time or slightly before the chicken and make extra marinade to brush on the finished chicken before serving.  Went very nice with quinoa.

These are YUMMY!  I double the sauce and use the first batch for the chicken, onions, and peppers (I added 1 orange & 1 yellow to 1 red).  The second batch of sauce I used to pour over zucchini & mushrooms as well as for basting on the grill.

Good. I forgot to put the marinade on some of the kabobs during grilling but they still turned out pretty tasty. The ones with the marinade were quite a bit better.

This is by far the best kabob recipe I've tasted in a good while. We've made these quite a bit. I would suggest maybe doubling the recipe for the marinade to have enough for soaking the veggies and the chicken. The only twist I added was a few shakes of red pepper flakes to give it a lil kick.

Absolutely Delicious! Was a hit on the first attempt. Double the sauce. Add yellow squash & zucchini, but partially steam them first. Also replace normal onion with red onion or sweet Bermuda onions. Skewer the ingredients then marinade them so that the skewer soaks in the marinade to brevet burning.

Yes!! The only thing I did differently was add a few other items like pineapple and zucchini to the mix. :) Awesome about 4 inches under the broiler for about 15-20 minutes or so, turning every so often.

Very flavorful marinade. I used crushed garlic in the marinade. I marinated the chicken all day, and the vegetables separately for two hours. Then I broiled the kabobs and they were great! I would definitely make these again.

These tasted great!  I followed the recipe on the marinade and I will definitely follow the recipe in the future.  I also added pineapple and apples to my skewers (which doesn't impact the recipe itself).  It's great as an appetizer or a main course!

Delicious! Marinated for six hours, meat and veggies separately. did double the marinade recipe and had the right amount for the meat and veggies i had. used thighs and their flavor and tenderness were delightful. if I wasn't cooking for little kids, I'd add a bit of crushed red pepper.

I have made this three times and it has been a big hit all three of those times! Verrrry delicious! I didn't marinate it for two hours, I just did one hour and it was still fine. Still had lots of flavor! Definitely  suggest it, but make sure you give yourself plenty of time to prepare it. Family favorite!

I made a lot more of the marinade than the recipe asked for (like 4-6 times the amount!) and added a little bit more garlic. I added mushrooms and pineapple and marinated everything for six hours. It turned out excellent! Marinate the chicken and vegetables separately.  Make sure to grill it on low so it doesn't burn. Baste with the marinade while grilling. Don't overcrowd the skewers.  We're making it again and trying it with bacon wrapped around the chicken!

Omg this was so amazingly GOOD & full of flavor ! And super duper easy to make. I didn't have any honey and it was too late to go to the store so I used syrup and instead of marinating for 2 hours I did it over night ! Good Lord it tasted really delicious, and my hubby loved them.

I loved this! I got a lot of compliments!  I added pineapple chunks and zucchini and excluded onions.  For an added bang, I wrapped each piece of chicken with a half of a strip of turkey bacon!  Yummm!

This was our first time to do kabobs & they were fantastic!  We used tenders as opposed to breasts.  They smelled awesome on the grill.  I think basting them often while grilling is key.  When the chicken was done & tender, we tented them for about 7-10 minuted.  Served the kabobs on a bed of brown rice.  This one is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe! This called for a lot of onions so I only did 3. Marinated everything for 24 hours. I set up the skewers on a pan and grilled them that way and they turned out delicious. Brushed the marinade on right before taking it off the grill. I'll definitely make these again.

This is a family favorite! I usually triple the sauce for 2lbs of chicken and vegetables and keep a small quantity of the marinade separate for dipping and putting on the rice I serve it with.  I marinate the chicken and vegetables in separate Ziploc bags for 5-6 hours-turning the bag over every 30 to 60 minutes. I've learned to make more than we usually eat otherwise everyone is fighting over who gets the last piece:)

Delicious recipe! Lots of flavors! I did use Lite Soy Sauce and everything still tasted great.

I would cook the marinated chicken first (or at least halfway) before doing the vegetables. My first making making this I burned the vegetables because I grilled everything together at the same time. Oops! Haha.

So worth it, though! I will make this many more times!

I made this recipe last night and it was delicious! I added the juice from a small can of pineapple chunks to the marinade. The chicken was flavorful and the recommended cooking time was perfect, as the chicken was quite tender. A huge hit with the family!

This is a good recipe!  Pretty easy too.  I did take another reviewer's advice and made twice as much marinade as directed - glad I did because there was almost not enough.  I used ingredients I had on hand.  I didn't have everything and the recipe still came out good.  I didn't have onions, so instead I used pineapples on the skewers.  I marinated the chicken for about 3 hours and the finished product was flavorful and tender.  I can only imagine how great it would be if I marinated it longer.  Excellent!  Would make it again...

Really good! Don't know how I missed this one all these years. I ran out of vegetable oil so I used EVOO. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I marinated over night and shook up the bowl every so often. At first it didn't look like enough marinade but it worked out in the end so I guess it was. My only recommendation would be to use another 2 or 3 peppers. Ours were very chicken heavy and I wished I had more veggies. If you like a kick as we do, I think chili flakes would do the trick. I wouldn't want to add any hot sauces that would change the taste entirely. Next time I'll be adding more peppers and chili flakes. This is a keeper for the summer. Thanks  Ann Marie.

I've added a little more garlic and used Olive oil after reading comments below and it was to die for!  I have also marinated it all together in the fridge over night. Added zucchini/squash/mushrooms. Grilled it meat together bad veggies together since veggies were done sooner.  I will definitely make this again! The marinate is great!!!!

We fell in love with the marinade!  Instead of using it on kabobs, we use it to marinade either chicken or beef cubes and then we grill them along with an assortment of veggies.  I save the rest of the marinade and once the meat and veggies are done, I pour the rest of the marinade on top.  I serve it over white or brown rice.  It's one of my favorite marinades to use!  You could also use it stove top.  It's one of our very favorites!

This recipe is a keeper!  So easy and I followed the recipe and it came out perfectly.  Served this with rice pilaf and even my picky Mother In Law loved it.   Will be making this again soon.

Amazingly good! I took others advice and cooked the meat and veggies separate. I wish I had made rice. It would be perfect on top of a bed of rice.

I agree with Sous Andy.  You have to double the recipe or there isn't enough marinade to cover the chicken.  I marinaded the veggies and chicken together per the recipe instructions.  I normally don't do that and won't next time.  It was kinda messy.  Excellent recipe!

I doubled the marinade because it just didn't seem like enough juice and added yellow squash and zucchini to the kebabs. I put the chicken and veggies on separate kebabs too. I only marinated it for about 4 hours and it was perfect! Even my 3 yr old loved it!

This recipe is awesome. I did double the marinade and used a large glass dish. It was great flavor and extremely juicy. Will try this again! Paired with some grilled pineapple, it was a tasty and healthy meal!

I use this recipe once a month or so, and have done full chicken breasts and breasts sliced into tenders.  It's easy to experiment with other spices, and I usually add some Cajun seasoning for a little kick!

Hi. Great recipe. I served it over brown rice. Doubled the recipe to base and then to drizzle over the rice. The sauce does thicken. ??

This recipe is so good! I separate the veggies and chicken when marinating and also skewer them separately. I just made this and only had about 30 minutes of marinating time. It was still fantastic!

I made these for a light dinner and they were wonderful.  My recommendation would be to triple the marinade amount. Put the meat (I used beef) in a zip lock bag and the veggies (red bell pepper, red onion, mushrooms) in another and let them marinate for about 8 hours.  Soaked the skewers in water to avoid burning. Left one portion of marinade aside to use during cooking.  They were delightful!

I made these twice (so far). They are easy to prep in advance and toss onto the grill as needed.  They were an excellent alternative to hotdogs and hamburgers for the adults during my son's 2nd birthday party at the park. My teenaged neice asked if I would make these for her high school graduation party. So there you go, teenage girl approved!  Thanks for posting!

These were truly delicious!  I just made them tonight for dinner on my Jenn-Air range.  I had a plumber working at my house and he couldn't resist asking me for one!   I obliged and made one guy a happy plumber! 
As others recommended I doubled the marinade and reserved some for dipping sauce and put some on my Jasmine rice.   
Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

I actually used the recipe to make fajitas. I mixed the sauce as directed (omit garlic) and marinated chicken and shrimp in one bowl and peppers and onions in another bowl, saving s little bit of sauce to add while cooking. Then I fried the chicken and shrimp then the veggies for a few mins, adding the extra sauce. It made a delicious fajita sauce! Love it!

I only marinated the chicken for 30 minutes and it tasted GREAT!  I cut the chicken into strips before marinating it (if that makes a difference?) Cooked it on skewers under the broiler for 5 to 10 minutes per side.  

It seems like I've heard chicken shouldn't be marinated for more than a few hours anyway or it can become mushy.

This is a fantastic recipe. I made it for my girlfriend and her family, and it was a hit. I suggest serving with white rice, and definitely be sure to brush them with the marinade while cooking (especially during the last minute or two)

Loved this recipe. I made it easy and mixed the sauce(which I doubled)frozen chicken breast and veggies in a zip lock bag. I marinated for about 8 hours and grilled the chicken whole with the veggies cooking in a grill pan. It was a big hit with the whole family. Even the picky teenagers liked it.

Made 3 lbs for 4 adults and 4 kids under age 9.  Next time make 4 lbs because 3 was barely enough.  Double sauce if marinating veggies too.  Tomatoes did not work well.  Oil grill because chicken stuck to grill.  Everyone liked... Teriyaki flavor.  Veggies good too.  Marinaded overnight and this worked well also.

I thought this recipe was amazing! I did however double the marinade, use 4 chicken breast, one small zucchini, and a whole pineapple in addition to the rest of the ingredients. I did not add the pineapple to the marinade though. I marinated everything(except the pineapple) overnight.  Make sure to soak your skewers for a while before using them. I only soaked mine for 30 mins prior to use many of them just caught fire on the BBQ. I brought these to a potluck and everyone loved them!

This was so simple and yet so great! I made the recipe almost exactly as written, just switched around the veggies a bit. I marinated for a good six hours to really let the flavor develop, and it was rich and flavorful! The veggies do get done before the chicken, so I recommend putting veggies and meat on separate skewers, as others have done, that way if the meat needs longer to cook, the veggies don't get overdone. Can't wait to make again!

great marinade.  I started in morning and by end of day was just enough.  I added zucchini, pineapple, mushrooms & did 1/2 steak tips & 1/2 chicken breast- it was very good.

This Marinade is AWESOME!!! 
I doubled the marinade recipe and marinaded my chicken and veggies separate for 5 hours!(I also cooked the veggies and chicken separate) I over cooked the Chicken kabobs simply because I'm not used to cooking kabobs but the chicken still had great flavor! The veggies were out of this world good(I used peppers, onion, and mushrooms). Next time I'm gonna try whole chicken breast or tenders. So so good! Definitely gonna make this again and again!!!

Theses were good, but didn't pack as much flavor as I was hoping after marinating for  20 hours.  I do think you need to baste with some extra sauce.  I marinated my chicken and veggie separately and used the left over veggie sauce out of fear of salmonella.

This is a "make again" recipe for my family. We had this tonight and was wonderful. I added ginger to the marinade and used cherry tomatoes instead of onion. Came out great. Next time I want to add pineapple to it.

THIS WAS WONDERFUL!  Followed it to a T. I did make the sauce for 12 and used only 4 fresh chicken breasts. Used some of the reserved sauces to baste during grilling. I did separate the chicken from the veggies.  That way I didn't have to worry about not cooking the chicken long enough.  Skewered the veggies by them selves as well.  I did put a slice of onion in between the chicken to add flavor.  Surprisingly, the onion was everyone's favorite!  Even my youngest who HATES onions ate onions!   VERY VERY GOOD!  Will make again.

Our family loves this recipe!  I usually pick this marinade for when we are having guests over.  There are never any leftovers as it is always a hit.  I serve it with coconut rice.  I usually double the marinade and marinate the veggies and the meat separately overnight.  Fresh grilled pineapple also works well with this dish.

This recipe is really, really good. My little girls are sort of picky and they love it. I grilled it tonight for our Memorial Day dinner. I made it last week but used the marinade as a sauce while cooking a whole chicken in a pressure cooker. It was good that way, too. Don't pass this one by - you'll really like it!

This was very good. I made it in the crock-pot cooked 6 chicken breasts on low for 6 hours. The only change I would make is to add red pepper to give it a kick.

These were so delicious.  I ended up making them twice in a week.  So easy.  Let everything marinate for at least 8 hours or so.  Next time I'll try it with some fresh pineapple chunks.  I wonder if subbing some sesame oil for some of the vegetable oil would be a good flavor?  Definitely a keeper!

This was a delicious Sunday Supper meal. I made as directed with no changes. Normally I would have served with some grilled veggies but I made this on the fly, I just cooked some rice. It was a great, flavorful meal.

Yummy and I will try this again : the family finished off the remainder straight away which is a good sign.  I only had time for 60 mins marinading and will try 3-4 hours next time.  I added in crushed garlic to the marinade.

Very good.  I cut veggies into 1 inch pieces because I found they didn't cook enough if larger.  Also chopped garlic.

Great flavour.  A little subtle so would probably mariniate it longer than the 2 hours suggested.

Loved it.  I wouldn't change a thing.  So simple but very good.  Chicken was very tender and nicely flavoured.  I only marinated for 2-3 hours.  I did mushrooms as well on separate skewer and they were so juicy.

awesome recipe! Thanks so much!  I added pineapple and mandarin oranges and used the fruit juice mixed with marinade to rub on while grilling.  My family and extended family asked for the recipe and has cooked it for themselves already. YUMMY is so true!

Excellent!!!! Even my picky eatter said it was a WINNER!! I made it twice, once as kabobs and then as a stir fry.  Both times it was GREAT.  I love it because it got the kids to eat their veggies. The second time I marinated the chicken and veggies about 4 hours (not overnight) and it was still great. I also modified the recipe the second time, I added grated ginger and Hoisin sauce. It was wonderful!! This is a keeper for my family!! Thank you for sharing.

This marinade is delicious!  Made both chicken and beef kabobs for a bbq and got many compliments!  I too kept the veggies and meat marinating in separate bags for over 24 hours.

DOUBLE the marinade!!! This is not enough by itself to marinade the veggies and the chicken. I didn't save marinade from the meat to baste, I just used the marinade left from the veggies. I also had 2 limes that I had to use, so I added the juice and zest to the marinade as well.

Instead of making this dish as kabobs, I used the sauce to cook the chicken in a wok.  It ended up having a Chinese flavor.  It was great over rice.

Delicious recipe using ingredients from the cupboard!  I just used this to introduce my kids to eating kabobs and it was a great hit.  I did make a few modifications - adding more garlic and some sesame seeds to the marinade - and marinated the meat all day to get more flavor.  Also added pineapple to the skewers for the kids.

This was a HUGE hit in our house and will definately be making it again. I did marinate the chicken for 24 hrs and the veggies for 4. Delish!

Soy sauce over powers the honey.  Can't taste it at all.  I'll try cutting the soy sauce and trying again.

These were absolutely delicious. Highly recommended. I didn't add it this time but this would have a great Asian flair if you added ginger. Without the ginger they're just good, without being Asian-flavored despite the soy sauce. Thanks for sharing the recipe, this one is an instant favorite!

OUTSTANDING!!!  We did this for a pool party for a large group (adults and children).  Preparation ahead of time took a litlle longer than 15 minutes but was well worth it!  Everyone loved them.   We added baby bella mushrooms brushed with marinade while grilling.

Really yummy! I added crushed pineapple to the marinade for the last hour or marinating (full time about 8hrs). Instead, I baked the chicken breast and vegetable kabobs of red and green bell peppers, sweet vidalia onion, and pineapple chunks. I also sprinkled a little seasoned salt and cayenne pepper on top of the kabobs. I basted the kabobs and chicken breasts with the marinade throughout the cooking and they came out great. Both the chicken and vegetables were juicy and tender. Will be making again!

This was a good marinade. I doubled the recipe for a friend's party and added a few extra veggies. One marinade I added a bit of ginger to, and the other some Chipotle peppers to give it a kick and they were still fantastic!

These were soooo good. I made them for my parents and we all loved them. I marinated the chicken and veggies separately for over 24 hours, and doubled the marinade as others have suggested. I used red, orange, and yellow bell peppers, white mushrooms, Vidalia onions, and both Cherub and Sunburst tomatoes. I also put in a little bit more honey than the recipe called for, and I used ginger flavored soy sauce. The chicken stayed really tender and moist, and Dad grilled them to perfection. I'm definitely doing this again later this summer, using fresh zucchini and onions from the garden!

LOVE this recipe!!!!! I quadrupled the sauce and put half in a ziploc bag with the cut up chicken pieces and half in a ziploc bag with red peppers, onions and pineapple. I marinated everything for about 9 hours. I drained the sauce off the veggies and saved it to baste the kabobs with while on the grill. I soaked the kabob sticks for a while (though not long enough) then alternated chicken, fruit and veggies on the sticks. I put the kabobs on the grill (next time I'll turn the heat down a bit before putting them on) but left the sticks hanging out of the grill. Once they were finished cooking I put a piece of aluminum foil under them so they would keep warm but not char too much. That's when I basted them with the extra sauce. They were to die for!!! I can't wait to make them again!!!!!

It was alright but nothing exceptional.  I think it would have benefited from salt and more honey.  I'll try it again.

I only marinated the chicken for about 30 mins and it was phenomenal.  I used the chicken for a grilled chicken salad served with an Asian ginger vinegarette and it was super tasty!

We really liked this. The chicken was moist and tender and the vegetables were great too.  While it's good and I'll probably make it again, I didn't think it was anything special.

Delicious!! We tried this last night with some chicken tenders I found in my freezer and defrosted, thinking they were breast cutlets. It was windy so we baked them in the oven, they were moist and tasty. Family polished off all the chicken and rice- I will cook more next time, out on the grill if it's not too windy. I know my son will be asking me to make this all summer long. Thanks for sharing!

Yes, YUMMY, YUMMY Honey marinate!  Didn't do kabobs, just chicken breasts marinated for several hours.  Made veggie kabobs & marinate just as good on them.  I will say I used high quality chicken breasts & I think that helped put this marinate over the top!

Very tasty and a great marinade to add your own flair.  I added about 1tbsp of red pepper flakes and some fresh squeezed orange juice.  You can cut the oil down to half of what they're saying and Olive oil works well too.  

PS.  Wrap the chicken in bacon and baste for much more kick  chicken.

This recipe was superb. My only change was using 1/2 teriyaki sauce and 1/2 Braggs Amino Acids, in lieu of the soy sauce. We absolutely loved it.

With an overnight soak, this made for a flavourful chicken.  I wasn't too crazy about it with the veg though.  One thing I really appreciate about this recipe is that it serves as a great base - I'd use it again and add more garlic and perhaps something with a little heat.  I'd also try it with pork.

Excellent.  I've been disappointed with most marinades I've tried...this is the best yet!  We used chicken, onions, yellow and orange bell peppers, and zucchini.  We were going to add pineapple but I didn't have any fresh and my canned pineapple was tidbits, not chunks, so too small for a skewer.

Great recipe! Simple and easy, and had most things on hand. I cut down on the recipe thinking we didn't have enough chicken (we only had 3 breasts). 
We should have made the full amount, and I would even make more probably next time.

We were only able to marinade for about 20 minutes, and the taste was still fantastic!! The sweetness really penetrated the chicken, but wasn't overly sweet. Really, Really good recipe.
In the rotation for sure! 

Or, as my husband said, it will make the cut to be in our recipe rolodex! :)

Thanks!

This was so good! My family really enjoyed the kabobs.  I was grilling these outside and the smell attracted my neighbor's attention (who happen to be my relatives) and I ended up having to share. 

The only thing I did differently was I used low sodium soy sauce and minced garlic in the marinade (which I doubled) instead, as that's what I had on hand. And just added a bit of cayenne pepper to it. I used red, yellow, and green bell peppers, sliced onion, and mushrooms. And then marinated the chicken and veggies separately in baggies for a full 24 hrs. After I had my skewers arranged, I sprinkled sesame seeds over them prior to cooking. And basted in the last few minutes w/ left over marinade from the veggies.  I served these with a garlic fried brown rice. Delicious! I will definitely have to try these with pineapple chunks next time, as others have suggested.

Made the marinate for whole chicken breast, let them sit for about 24 hours on the fridge, turning them a few times.  Let them get room temp right before grilling.  They were Great!

This was delicious! My husband absolutely enjoyed this as well. I added pineapple chunks and zucchini as others suggested and double the recipe. I let it marinade for 6 hours and oh my gosh. It was awesome. It was raining outside so I broiled everything at 450 and it was ready in about 15 minutes. I will definitely make this again :)

Mmmmmmm.  These were awesome!  I let mine marinade for a couple of hours and added cherry tomatoes and zucchini.  Our grill decided not to work at the last minute, so I ended up cooking them up on our George Foreman.  The result?  AWESOMENESS.  So simply, but delish!  Also our first time using zucchini on kabobs, and let me tell you, I will use it every single time because it tastes soooo good (and I used to hate zucchini!).  Yum!

Loved this recipe.  The first time I made the kabobs, but  I normally use the marinade for grilled chicken breasts because I'm too lazy to cut the chicken into cubes.  The leftovers are perfect to add to a green salad for lunch the next day.

Boiling the marinade didn't work.

This was delicious.  My family loved it, and they were wary at first.  Two weeks ago I tried a store-bought teriyaki sauce over chicken and they did not like it at all.  They did love this though -- I will never bring store-bought teriyaki sauce in this house again -- Thank you!  Oh....I made it as is but without the black pepper.  And it left a delicious soy, garlic aroma in the house (I had cooked the chicken in the oven.  I will definitely marinate much longer next time, I only had chicken in the marinade about 1-1/2 hours.  Also, this was so good, I could have drank it out of a glass! Thank you Ann Marie for sharing your delicious recipe.

we love this a lot! My husband asked me to cook it again this weekend when his parents come over. I also added 1/4 teaspoon white pepper. Instead of raw garlic, I uses garlic power. I cut the chicken breasts into strip. It came out really good!

4.5 Stars: I marinated 2 lbs. chicken tenders for 2 days. It was a good marinade. I made another 1/2 batch of marinade/sauce for basting. One day I will master grilling tenders without drying them out, although I did do better this time. I served this with yellow rice, but think a fried rice or Asian-type side would be better.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I do not have a grill, so I used the broiler.

My family really enjoyed these kabobs! I marinated them overnight and they turned out perfect.

Absolutely delicious, this is currently my favorite recipe for chicken.  To me it tastes like teriyaki chicken; the marination sauce makes the chicken taste amazing

Made this last weekend and it was delicious!  So simple, but the chicken had such a good flavor.  I did the veggies separately in foil and they were amazing too!  Will definitely be using this recipe again often.

What a Great recipe! I followed others advice to double the marinade.  I actually forgot to add the oil and just poured a little in each marinade bag, hoping for the best. It turned out great!!! I will definitely make this again but I'll probably add all the ingredients next time ha ha.

This was really good. I used 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder instead of the garlic cloves and I added honey just because I really like honey. I made mine in a skillet so only used 2 onions instead of the 5 and that turned out to be plenty. I marinated in a freezer bag turning it over when I thought about it for the two hours that it called for. It was great so I could only imagine what it would taste like if I were able to marinade longer.

Loved it. Made separate skewers for chicken, and for veggies. Good marinade for chicken breasts even if you don't make kabobs. Be sure to soak your wood skewers for 20+ mins. so they don't burn on a grill (I charcoal grilled mine). I tripled the sauce; probably could have done with only doubling as others did. I added zucchini chunks and mushrooms. Definitely will make again. Served with "Microwave fried rice" found on this site, and it was a wonderful meal.

Tried this recipe tonight.  Just yummy! mmmmmm!
Made it with just two chicken breasts and found that it was just enough marinade so if I were to do more I wound increase the amount of marinade.

I tried this recipe tonight; I doubled the sauce, and we did half the chicken/veggies "as is" in the recipe and for the other half of chicken/veggies, we used the sauce as a glaze (did not marinate this half), just to compare.  I served the chicken and veggies over rice.  

We didn't think that marinating everything in the sauce did very much when compared to the glaze.  The flavor added by the glaze in the last couple of minutes of cooking did a lot.

My almost-3 year old son liked his chicken (both cooking methods -- he didn't discriminate!).  We had some leftover sauce and my husband just kept pouring it on his leftover rice, and said how much he liked it just as a sauce.  

I will probably not use this recipe as written again, but I will definitely be keeping the sauce recipe to have on hand for stir-frys and rice, and I also plan to try oven-baking the chicken (half breasts) in the sauce another time.  In my opinion, this recipe is definitely worth a shot, and worth experimenting with for your tastes.

Very nice.  Added lots of chopped garlic and sriracha to the marinade and mushrooms to the veggies.  Ended up broiling instead of barbequing - got rained out.

This recipe is excellent!! It is very easy, it's healthy, and a quick meal.  This recipe does NOT need to be changed at all.  It is best marinated overnight but also good if only marinated a couple hour before cooking.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed all of the extra suggestions above and it turned out great. The only thing extra I added was 4 teaspoons of hickory liquid smoke(just add a teaspoon at a time to reach desired taste)

This recipe is so simple and delicious.  I have made it several times and prefer whole chicken breasts as the kabobs tend to burn easier.

I've made these several times as is, with wonderful results. Late last night I realized I was completely out of honey right in the middle of putting the marinade together (and I live in the boonies - finding an open store is impossible at that hour). So I used an equal part of maple syrup instead and it came out fantastic. Slightly different flavor of course, but an excellent variation on an already lovely recipe.

Great taste and easy to put together with ingredients that you have on hand.  Took advice of other reviews and made a double batch of marinade so as not to mix meat with vegetables.  Will make again and again.

One of our favorite recipes!!  I always stick with bell peppers (1 green and then 2-3 red, orange, or yellow) and a large red onion for the vegetables.  I then follow the exact recipe for the marinade and this meal has never failed!  Serve with hot rice and you have a wonderful meal with very little effort!  Thanks for sharing it!

These turned out amazing! I marinated the chicken & veggies for about 5 hours and they were very flavorful. My boyfriend raved! I did double the marinate so I would have extra and added fresh pineapple, which went perfectly with this recipe. Delicious!

Yummy recipe and easy because I already had most of the ingredients on hand.  Will make again for sure and will probably add more veggies!

Delicious!!  The kabobs were a hit with the whole family, including the kids which is quite a daunting task I must say.  They absolutely loved the idea of making their own skewer!  So much fun.  In the preparation of everything, I forgot to brush the marinade I saved to the side ontop on the skewers.  They were excellent anyway, but next time I make these I won't forget to put that final touch on!

Made this with 5 boneless skinless chicken thighs and some veggies. There was barely enough sauce. Marinated for 4 hours. The chicken and cremini mushrooms turned out really tasty. Bell peppers and onions were just o.k. Will try with zucchini and cnicken breasts next time.

Very good for such a simple recipe! I used lower sodium soy sauce (preference) and marinated the chicken overnight.  I totally forgot about reserving some of the marinade for basting, but the kabobs didn't need it - the chicken was plenty flavorful enough.  I did not use any veggies as we had several vegetable side dishes at our party.  Great recipe - even my picky husband made a point of saying how good the chicken was! Will definitely make these again.  Thanks, Ann Marie!

Today is my third time making this in a week timeframe.  My guests loved them when I first made them last week.  Like others, I added pineapple chunks, green peppers, red peppers, onions and mushrooms.   Everyone loved the combination of yummy chicken and pineapple.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for such an easy recipe with a huge rewarding taste.

I used chicken, mushrooms, red peppers and red onion, marinated them over night and threw them on the BBQ tonight for dinner. So delicious, moist and had just the right amount of sweetness. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent.  Instead of using 2 whole cloves of garlic, I used minced garlic in the marinade.  I marinaded the chicken and the vegetables separately for 24 hours, then used the leftover marinade from the vegetables to make a sauce thickened with cornstarch.  Served everything over jasmine rice with the sauce, and it was really good.

This marinade if fantastic!  I did my veggie skewers a little differently (red and green peppers, red onion, zucchini and squash tossed in olive oil and seasoned salt instead of the marinade), but did the chicken as written.  Rave reviews by all at the table!

I wouldn't even give this a single star...  I marinated the veggies with the chicken and something caused it to become slimy and unedible.  Only marinated it for three hours.  Even double checked the date on the chicken to see if it was bad, even though I'd just purchased it.  The marinade tasted good, but something about the combination of sauce and veggies started to digest the chicken.

Our family Loved this recipe! We added green peppers and mushrooms to the skewers. We also sprinkled the veggies with Vegetable Garlic and Herb Seasoning after they were done marinating. We didn't marinate the mushrooms but basted them on the grill with all the veggies. We also mixed all veggies on the skewers with the chicken an grilled on low. Everything was tender and amazing! Thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe last night with both chicken and beef and they were both great. The thing I liked about this recipe was the simplicity, I hate recipes with a mile long list of ingredients. I also grilled some fresh pinneaple brushed with the marinade, It was delicious. I saw one reviewer who put pinneaple in hers and the chicken came out mushy. I learned that the hard way a few weeks ago, don't put pineapple in marinade unless you are only marinading it for a very short time.

These were quite tasty, however I only used 2 large chicken breasts, 1 large bell pepper, and 1 onion (me and my husband) but kept the original amount of marinade. I don't think that there would be enough marinade if using 8 breasts. Very good flavor though!

we used this recipe for the marinade only.  Added the garlic right to the honey/soy mixture.  Marinated 3 BLSL chicken breast halves for 7 hours.  Baked in 400 degree oven for 20 minuted, covered.  They were fantastic!  Very flavorful and moist as well.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be using it for kabobs come summer and just as a chicken marinade until then.  My four year old liked it and my husband loved it.

these were good...but not amazing. I felt like they needed a little something extra.  But I'm not sure what that something is. My first thought was ginger - but I don't like the idea of always going asian with my kabobs. But the soy gave a distinctive flavor and the honey a subtle sweetness. The garlic and pepper added some flavor...but there was just something that seemed missing...

As is I give it a 3 but could be tweaked.  I think you need a lot more veggies.  The smaller you cut the chicken the tastier it is.

This was awesome!!!!  I only marinated for about 45 mins and it was still great.  I'm looking forward to tasting it after marinating overnight.  I used a garlic press to mince the garlic instead of adding it whole.  It releases more of the garlic flavor.  Can't wait to make this again!

Fantastic and easy to make!!! I have made a few changes, extra virgin olive oil, and more honey. I made two separate marinades, on for the meat and one for the veggies and then you can use the veggie one while cooking them for basting. We have made them several times now and everytime we have run out and people are wanting more. We also tripled the batch because of the number of people we made them for.

I doubled the marinade to have enough for my veggies as well.  The taste was nice and light but kind of bland - I only marinated everything for three hours though.  Next time I make it I will try marinating longer and maybe adding more spices.

AWESOME!!!!  These were really, really good.  I dont like soy sauce so I used teriyaki and added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes - It was fantastic - I even overcooked the chicken (i was grilling after dark) and it was still simply wonderful.  Next time I will double the sauce/marinade recipe.  I even ate the veggies (which is VERY rare for me).

My fiance and I made these up last night and they were AMAZING!!! I followed the directions exactly with the exception of placing the chicken and the veggies on separate skewers. Oh, I also put Sriracha in with the marinade because we both like our food spicy. Overall, fabulous dish and we plan on making it again this week and every week after!

Not bad at all! I marinated overnight and roasted the veggies and chicken separately in the oven. The flavors were nice and potent, probably a little too much for most people but we liked it. It ended up being a little heavy on the soy sauce flavor and not enough honey, but that may have been because of the long marinade time. Will definitely try this one again.

Awesome marinade! I doubled the marinade and put chicken in a separate bowl from the veggies while marinading for several hours. I put the chicken and veggies combined on the skewers and it worked perfectly! SO MUCH FLAVOR! Served with wild rice and my husband loved it! Will definitely make these again!

This was really simple to make and very tasty. I doubled the garlic and added a bit of ground ginger and cayenne pepper to the marinade. I marinated the chicken overnight and the veggies for a couple hours. Make sure to keep some marinade aside for brushing on the grill.  Next time ill use separate skewers for the chicken and veggies, and my outdoor grill. I tried it on my indoor one and it took FOREVER to cook the chicken.

Sooo good and light. I added some pineapple and marinated everything together for about 4 hours. I cooked in a pan under the broiled because I forgot skewers when I went to the store. Delicious leftover too. Served with rice.

The marinade is FANTASTIC! :) I used the full amount of marinade with 1 lb chicken, 1 lb shrimp, 1 med. onion, 1 red bell pepper and a package of whole mushrooms - marinaded for about a day and a half. I added 1 fresh pineapple to the skewers as I prepped them and we all thoroughly enjoyed this recipe! Absolutely DELICIOUS and man it smells great! :)

These made for a wonderful family dinner! They did take quite a bit longer than the timing suggested as there was so much to be cut/diced. The only complaint my family had was that it was a little heavy on the soy sauce flavor and not enough of a sweet honey flavor. It could have been the type of honey I used though... This will be going into the "Yes" pile at our house!

Very good marinade, though I substituted the soy sauce with teriyaki sauce. It would be a good idea to double the amount of marinade you use.

This is a wonderful dish.  My chicken kabobs did stick, so I will be sure to oil the grill grates better next time. High heat was a little too hot on my grill, so I will turn it down a bit next time. I like a lot of sauce, so I doubled it. Really good!

'Tasty moist succulent smoky flavour' husband said and I quote...   I added in Ground Ginger, Garlic Salt, and a combination of other herbs and spices (McCormick Chicken Rub) and marinated for about 5 hours.    I didn't put the peppers or onions in the marinade, but just brushed some of the reserve basting liquid on those skewers when on the grill.   When husband and 13 year old son fight over the chicken, you know it's good....

Delicious recipe.  I marinated overnight and the chicken was moist even when reheating a small amount of leftovers the following day.  I doubled the marinade as suggested by another reviewer which was an excellent idea.  I also used agave nectar instead of the honey and low sodium soy sauce.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  My company loved it.  Thanks.

This was a fantastic recipe! I tried to cook it on the grate over a fire when we went camping and that did not work out so well, so I dumped it all in a pot and cooked it that way. Everyone LOVED it. The only thing I did differently is make up another batch of sauce because I didn't feel like I had enough. I highly recommend this recipe, it is just so good! Everything blends just right and my very picky husband was all over it, I wish I had made a double batch.

This was hands down, the BEST chicken we have ever had.  My husband could not believe how good it was.  Will be making again and again!  Perfection!

This recipe was outrageously good even though we changed it up a bit to suit our tastes. We free-styled on the ingredient amounts and replaced chicken breasts with boneless, skinless chicken thighs and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  We served it with short-grain brown rice & the red chili sauce ("Sriracha" hot chili sauce) that you can get at any Chinese restaurant or buy in the Asian section of your supermarket.  Anyway, this was spectacular and we will definitely be making this every week. Thank you for sharing Ann Marie.

Very good marinade.  Also used sirloin strip steak.  Surprisingly the veggies didn't get soggy in the marinade.

Fabulous!  I kept the meat and veggies separate. For the veggies, I substituted 1/4 cup balsamic vinagerette instead of soy sauce and sprinkled a little olive oil instead of vegetable.  It turned out perfect.  Also added more garlic.  Will definitely make again.

I've used this marinade several times now. I cut the chicken in chunks and marinade them all day in a ziplock, and the veggies in a seperate ziplock. Mushrooms and zucchini are really delish! The sauce amont specified in this recipe was fine for 3 cut up breast. I've also used this same marinade for pork and salmon on the grill...sometimes I add a couple T. of cornstarch to thicken it up...helps it stick better on the grill.

What makes this recipe is the honey marinade. I marinated the chicken in a bowl (just the chicken, not vegetables) for 3 hrs and I had plenty of marinade leftover to brush on the kabobs while/after grilling. I used chicken tenders since the store at the time didn't have chicken breasts and to be honest, it saved a lot of time since I didn't take much to cut them into cubes. Like some others, I also put my chicken and vegetables on the same skewer. I also added whole mushrooms. I served it with parmesean orzo and it was delicious!

Very good! I cooked this for my husband and me for dinner, and I loved it! I am always looking for new recipes for the BBQ, especially now that it is getting really warm, and I try not to cook in the house as much. I didn't make kabobs, but I used the recipe as a marinade for chicken breasts. I will definitely be making this again!

This was very good.  I took the advice of a couple of other reviewers, added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger and pineapple.  This does not have what I would call a big flavor, but is delicious, and a recipe we will enjoy again and again.  Many thanks to the submitter for this keeper recipe.

I highly recommend marinating the chicken for a long time (probably over night).  I only had time to marinate for about 45 minutes, and the flavor just wasn't there.  Probably won't make again.

These are so good. I make them all the time. I find they are best if they marinate then for at least 8 hours. I also marinate the chicken and vegetables separately.

Good.  A solid 3 star.  Not a recipe that I would praise up and down to the girls at work the next day.  However, the short, readily available ingredient list is a definite plus.  So, for that I would rate 4 stars.

I had some trouble gilling these. I used metal skewers and had a really hard time turning them. The meat kept spinning around....I didnt think I was gonna serve them because of how un evenly they cooked but when I brought them inside and tasted one, I loved them...My son did too. I added mushrooms to them also, but didnt marinade the vegies until the last ten minutes or so. They turned out great. Next time I will try wooden skewers for sure.

I made these for a July 4th cookout last summer and everyone loved them. I used zuchini, yellow peppers, and onion. It is a lot of work but definately worth it. I will be using this again and again.

This was a huge hit with some guests we had. Things I did differently were I followed someone else’s advice and doubled the recipe. I would recommend following that. I also soaked my skewers in water. Instead of the veggies they listed, I used cherry tomatoes, potatoes (precooked in the microwave), broccoli, and onions. I didn't marinate any of the vegetables, but soaked them heavily on the skewers. I also broiled them in the oven on a cookie sheet. I just turned them every five minutes or so and basted. They came out perfect.

Not bad, but nothing to rave about. Nobody commented about them (negatively or positively) and both my husband and 12-year-old son requested BBQ sauce for dipping.  That makes this just "an OK" dish in my book and one I'll probably not make again since there are so many other marinade recipes to try. Very simple, however, with ingredients I always have on hand. That's a plus.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! I didn't have any peppers, so I omitted those, but made the recipe as written otherwise, letting it marinate 24 hours. I loved how the marinade made sort of a sticky glaze on the chicken. Very good and flavorful. I will definately be making these again, maybe adding some pineapple chunks next time! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was so good!  I marinated the chicken for about 20 hours.  I went to chop up into pieces and ealized we wee out of skewers!  So, we just had the chicken breasts whole.  They were delicious.  Next time I will use a little more honey and a little less soy sauce.  The flavors all melded perfectly and DB just raved about it.  Will use this recipe again and next time I'll make sure I have skewers!

Wowwww! SO sooo good! I did it with beef but I'm sure chicken would be equally delicious! My friends are asking when I will make this again.  Marinated for about 5 hours. Served with Chinese fried rice (recipe on this site also)

Easy & fun to make.  I doubled the sauce & still had to stretch it a little bit.  Going to try with steak next time (minus the honey addition).  Try with mashed potatoes!

This was pretty good. Since it's already winter here, we didn't have a grill to cook it on. I think it would have added a bit more flavor to grill the chicken than baking it allowed.

I made these kabobs tonight and let me just say these were AWESOME! My husband and I both loved them and will definetely make again. I didn't change anything and it was perfect, I had plenty of marinade left to brush on the meat and veggies, it was the perfect amount for two people. Thank you so much for this recipe.

We made these for our Labor Day party and they were a HUGE hit!!  I marinated the chicken and veggies together, along with some pineapple chunks, for 3 hours.  I doubled the marinade, as suggested by other reviews, also added some pineapple juice to it.  Grilled the kabobs on low heat and they cooked well together.  Extraordinary flavor and texture. These kabobs will be made many times to come!!

I doubled the recipe & made exactly as indicated. I put chicken, marinade, peppers & onions in double-bagged ziploc. I didn't have skewers but still wanted the grilled flavor so I used an old pizza pan with holes. I made an extra batch of the marinade for basting. On the grill I added crushed pineapple & grape tomatoes. I grilled everything together, basting occasionally until chicken was cooked through and veggies were soft & grilled. Served over brown rice. It was amazing!! The chicken was juicy and very tender. Only regret was not making more. Even with a double batch, there were no left-overs for me today :(  Absolutely will make again. Maybe try beef next time??

Absolutely delicious!  My hubby, who I have a hard time feeding veggies to devoured these up along with 3 freshman college guys.  My only concern was I didn't make enough.  We all loved them.    I made the marinade exactly as directed and it was perfect.  I used onions, grape tomatoes and pineapple and let them set for about 3-1/2 hours.  I already have requests to make these again tomorrow.

This recipe was great!  I completely forgot to marinate the chicken and veggies in advance, so I threw them in a bowl and marinated it all for about 30 minutes, and they still came out with incredible flavor.  I added onions, red pepper, orange pepper (for color), onion, mushrooms and cherry tomatoes to the skewers.. delicious!    I added balsamic vinegar to the mixture (actually by accident) and it gave it such great flavor!!  Then I drizzled some honey over top of the marinating chicken and veggies.  It was great!  Highly recommended.

these were delicious and easy. i only used about 1/4 cup of kikkoman soy sauce since it's really salty. i left out the vegetables since i didn't have any and i used whole skinless chicken thighs instead of the kabobs. these grill amazingly!

Very easy, but average tasting. It needs some "oomph" ~ a little more honey & perhaps red chile powder?

This recipe is wonderful.  I pre-prep many of my meals and then freeze them for quick and easy meals.  This one works great. I love the marinade so I usually double that so that there is enough to boil for a sauce for rice.  To freeze this meal I just pre-make the marinade and cut op chicken and freeze.  I let it defrost while I'm at work and place kabobs in water.  Then when I get home I chop veggies and grill.  Also works good in the broiler.

This recipe is so deceptively simple but so incredibly tasty.  The only change I made was to add about a tsp of fresh grated ginger to the marinade.  Used red onion, red bell pepper and zucchini as they all cook at about the same rate as the chicken.  The key to this recipe is cooking the skewers at a moderate temperature so the sugars in the marinade don't burn and the chicken doesn't overcook before the veggies are done.  (if you're going to put the veggies and chicken on the same skewers like I did.) Great recipe - this will be a regular at my place.

Love this recipe! Followed as written, except added a  1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes to the marinade and then skewered unmarinated fresh pineapple chunks between the chicken chunks instead of veggies. Grilled over high heat on a gas grill and it was quick and perfectly done.  Everyone loved it!! Would definitely recommend!!

I followed this recipe to a tee and was extremely pleased with the results. The marinade is not too over powering.  As another reviewer stated, I think this would make a great stir fry sauce as well.  Will definitely make again, and will try using with shrimp or pork.

Thank you for a great recipe.  I know my family will enjoy it often.  My somewhat picky DD even loved it.  I did double the marinade and put the veggies in one bag and chicken in the other.  I boiled the marinade from the veggie bag to serve on the side for dipping and to pour over rice.  So good!!

Wonderful marinade recipe. Adds to the taste of the vegatables instead of overpowering them like some marinades do. A must try!

Delicious, tender succulent chicken! I added more garlic since my family loves it. I also skewed fresh pineapple chunks, grape tomatoes and red onion. Marinate for a long time, the flavors seep in better. Definitely soak your bamboo skewers in advance so they don't burn!

These were delicious.  I made the kabobs with yellow and green zucchini, chicken, onions, and red and green peppers.  I let the chicken and veggies marinade all day and I broiled the kabobs for about 15 minutes (since I don't have a grill).  They were absolutely delicious.  However, they seem to lose most of their flavor when reheated... which is a shame because I made a lot!  Next time, I might make extra marinade to put over the kabobs before reheating.

This is so, so basic...all reviews add and confirm the value of this recipe...I want to add my 2 cents: Double ok, I make about 3or4 pounds of the veggies, because I eat, and love them, I cut them in half and/even slices. I spray with olive oil spray***before***I maranate, this is to restrict the calories and mushyness. I grill them (veggies) for the BBQ lines, and baste (dip in sauce). I let them drip dry, and freez on a cookie sheet, then put in plastic bags..& store.  The veggies go fast, watch them, you want them undercooked for freezing, and crip if you serve them as a side dish...try this with some fruit too. Large, even sized pieces. Jagged is ok, just go for the grill lines. dip in lemon, or lime or whatever you have for a change. I make many things in advance, and can always put something great together in the time it takes to heat the grill.

This is a great chicken recipe.  Easy to do, easy to change, and always oh so good.  The chicken always comes out tender, sweet and juicy...even when over cooked.  I have also done it has breast halves (let them soak for a long time) and it is still wonderful!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Excellent recipe, will be using this for vegetables or a simple chicken marinade in the (near) future!  I only had an hour to marinade and it turned out fantastic.  I used evoo as i didn't have vegetable oil.  I also used some cayenne pepper and fresh garlic per other reviewers.  Fast, Easy...I LOVE IT!

Everyone loved this recipe including our little kids. My (slightly) food snob husband wanted me to make it for dinner guests just a few nights later.  I also used the marinade with shrimp and it was just as good.

I couldn't believe how great this recipe was! It's SO simple, yet amazing.  We only had about 30 mins to marinade and it still turned out great.  For the kabobs, we did onions, green peppers, mushrooms, and chicken.  For the marinade, we didn't change a thing! We will definitely make this again!

I marinated the chicken for about 10 hours in the marinade and our chicken still tasted a little bland.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good recipe but I thought there would be more taste to the chicken.  I will make again but I may add something more to the marinade next time.

Suprisingly great! Much better than I expected from such a simple recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. I marinated the chicken and veggies together in a ziploc bag for 24 hours. My boyfriend did end up burning the chicken a bit on the grill since it was too dark outside to really see well, but even though they were crispy they still had an incredible flavor! Thanks for this recipe. I will definitely be making these again. My boyfriend could not stop eating the chicken! Hopefully we will not burn them next time. LOL.

I tend to like spicy over sweet but my husband loved this recipe.  I made a double batch of the marinade and refrigerated half of it to use a week later.  It tasted great the second time around. We added red and green bell peppers and onions to the kabobs as well.  I would recommend saving a small portion of the marinade before you put the chicken in that you can use for basting when they're on the grill. Otherwise, the chicken can be a little dry.

I made this recipe twice.  First time was to the "T".  It came out very tasty but a little on the salty side.  Second time, I reduced the amount of soy sauce to half and use low sodium to boot.  I also added a squirt of fresh lemon juice.  Since it's the season for indoor grilling, I made these on my George Foreman G5 grill.  Dinner was done in a super flash and I didn't have to worry about soaking the skewers to prevent burning.  Definitely skewer the chicken and veggies separately.  Only marinated chicken for 15 minutes and it still came out tasty.  Thanks again for this recipe!

There were delicious! A perfect recipe... I was a little skeptical of the marinade but it was sooo good! I followed some reviewers suggestions and added pineapple on my kabobs. I don't have a grill so I broiled it in my oven and it was still delicious. Next time I'll use a grill and I bet it will be even more so! :)

Soooo Good!!!and easy!!  I doubled the marinade and let is sit all day.  We used chicken thighs, sweet peppers, onions, and pineapple (didn't marinate the pineapple) also I put carrots in the marinate but not on the skewers.  We had left over everything and the next day we made a stir fry and then I used the carrots.  It was so good!!!!

PERFECT!  These have become a Sunday staple in my house!!  We just can't seem to get enough.  

Also, if you're in a pinch, Lawry's has a 15 minute Hawaiian marinade (leave for a least an hour though) that tastes very similar.

EXCELLENT recipe.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I doubled the marinade, like a lot of reviewers suggested.  I separated the veggies and chicken on a few of the skewers, then alternated chicken, bell pepper, onion on the rest.  Both combinations cooked very evenly, and this meal was amazing over fresh white rice.

The next time I do it I will try adding a little more honey to thicken the sauce (esp for basting while grilling) as it is very thin when following the recipe.  I also want to try using boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts and see how much more tender that will be.

Taste just like teriyaki chicken, with a sweet honey glaze! I will definitely be using this marinade when I make teriyaki chicken! I served it with rice and steamed Vegetables.

These were very good and easy. I marinated the chicken overnight in freezer bags. A couple hours before cooking I added the vegetables and also added some pineapple. Will definitely make again!

Fantastic! Really great and went over really well with the kids! I doubled the marinade and placed the chicken seperate from the vegetables - as they have different cooking times. A real keeper!

I would cut down on the honey next time, but this makes a good marinate for button mushrooms imo and you can add some black pepper and some cornstarch and make this a sauce!

If you can find the skewers that have double prongs it makes grilling easier! You dont have to worry about the meat sliding around while your trying to flip.
I make 2 batches of marinade; 1 for the veggies & one for the meat and I save the one from the veggies to brush over the meat while grilling.Have used on both chicken and pork and both are good!

These turned out really good, my family loved them.  I made three batches of the marinade, separated the veggies from the chicken and marinated for almost 24 hours.  I basted the kabobs on the grill with the third batch of marinade, which made them super yummy.  This is a new family favorite!

This is a good recipe for chicken, not out of this world or anything but really yummy and a nice change from typical grilled chicken. I marinaded the chicken for 7 hours and cut it into strips and broiled it for 10 minutes on one side, flipped and brushed with sauce and let broil for another 5 minutes.

The chicken tasted okay but I thought the veggies (after marinating all day) had a great flavor. These weren't bad but not my favorite recipe. I think I will stick with the Key Lime Chicken.

This is my hubbies new favorite marinade.  These were soo delicious.  I too doubled the sauce and the only changes were I used olive oil opposed to the vegetable and I like to have  a citrus or tropical fruit in my chicken dishes so I added in pineapple chunks when marinating for a subtle hint of flavor..  Will keep these on the weekly roatation of chicken dinners.  And they were just as good for lunch the next day.  Thanks for the great share.

This recipe is delicious! I broil it in the oven, turning it once while it is cooking to evenly cook both sides. I also double the marinade and marinate it for 24 hours. DELICIOUS!! I made 12, and they are GONE!

WOW.  I've made this twice, but just used the recipe to marinade my chicken before grilling.  It's fabulous.  The chicken was so moist.  I told my husband it was the best chicken I've ever had!  (He thinks it's because of his grilling-LOL!)

For the second year running, I made this for a large birthday party. We had 35 guests, so I made enough for 42 servings. I got rave reviews and there wasn't a single kabob left -- in fact, I probably could have made more and they still would have been snapped up. Delicious! I followed the marinade recipe exactly and included yellow, orange and red peppers together with yellow zucchini along with the chicken. I'm making it again this weekend for a picnic. Definitely a keeper.

This is the best tasting chicken ever. I made a batch for home and we all loved it. Two days later I made a huge batch for a party we went to. Was loved by all. The only thing I do different is to sprinkle a bit of dried jerk seasoning on just before grilling. The honey does tend to burn, but I think the charred parts are the best!

Super great taste!!! I doubled the marinade because it didn't look like it would be enough - glad I did - was perfect. I put foil, with holes poked in it, on the grill grate before grilling- helped to keep the kabobs from getting burnt.

The recipe is correct.  These kabobs are yummy(except for the one that hubby dropped on the ground while grilling, but the dog didn't mind)! I halved the amount of chicken and kept the sauce amount the same.  I marinated in a zip lock bag for about 18 hours. Probably didn't need that long, that was just how it worked out. I added whole mushrooms and pineapple chunks.  I also used the little whole white onions which are kind of a pain to peel but they looked and tasted yummy!

Wow was this good!  I marinated the chicken and veggies (& pineapples) over night.  I also added 2T brown sugar and 1/4C pineapple juice to the marinade.  I thought I might have made the marinade too sweet but the sugar from the ingredients just burned off leaving heavenly, moist chicken and veggies.  I will definately make this again.

This one is an absolute keeper !!
I didn't have plain soy sauce so I substituted with sezchuan sauce, which gave it a little kick !!!  I marinated for about 3 hours.  I was not in the mood to barbecue, so I cooked it in the oven for about 25 minutes in a pan, and broiled it for about 5 minutes in the end !!!  I served it over asian rice noodles !!  I will be making this one again for sure !!!!

This was very good.  I kabobbed the chicken and grilled my mixed veggies (yellow squash, red onion, bell pepper, grape tomatoes) in a basket.  Both the dishes had marinated all day in separate containers.  Instead of garlic I used garlic powder in the marinade, also added some pineapple juice and dried onion and dried parsley.  Next time I will add more soy sauce and salt (since I have low sodium soy sauce).

Nice simple marinade for a weekday dinner. I baked it (20 mins at 400)instead of grilling but next time I'll definitely do that to intensify the flavor. Thanks!

The sauce to marinade the chicken in is outstanding.  I also used button mushroom tops, as well as grape tomatoes to liven up the array of vegetables offered. I added a little more honey and a bit less soy sauce due to personal preference w/sodium, and I allowed it to marinate for about 3 hours.  This is a keeper.

Great recipe! I was worried the chicken would turn out too sweet but I was wrong, turned out absolutely delicious! I didn't have time to marinate the chicken and veggies overnight, I only marinated them for 30 minutes and they still tasted great, I also substituted black pepper with lemon pepper.Husband gave it a two thumbs up. I will definitely be making this one again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I wished I loved this, but I didn't.  The flavors didn't sit right with me.  I feel like it needed to have a more distinct taste: either sweeter or saltier.

This is absolutely the BEST recipe I have come across so far. I made the marinade, prepared the chicken, and then threw it in a ziploc bag and froze it. I pulled it out to thaw, added the onions the day I was planning to eat it so they could marinate as well (I did not think they would freeze well). I made additional marinade to brush on as I grilled it. My husband does not like dry chicken and he could not believe how moist this was! Definitely guest-worthy. I'm going to make a double batch next time-one to eat and one to keep handy for guests!

This was fantastic! Very flavorful - I omitted the "kebob" factor and just used chicken tenders. Even my 3 year old loved it. I added crushed garlic and onion flakes and a little brown sugar to the marinade and marinaded for about 8 hours.

This is a simple, summertime meal. I could really taste the honey, which is great with the sweet veggies. I used a red onion, too, and skewered the meat separate from the veggies to adjust for cooking time.

Everyone loved this recipe!  I also changed the skewers so that I had one of all chicken and then others with vegetables on them, since there are different cooking times.  I had actually made this when we had family come over, which I don't think I'd do again, just because of the amount of work required with all the spearing of the skewers.  It worked well with all the vegetables as well.  I could see using this again for smaller crowd or even marinading breasts and cooking it in the oven.  Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except I added pineapple and green peppers and was very disappointed.  I marinated the chicken and veggies for 6 hours - the chicken turned out almost mushy and will not make this recipe again.

These were OK, but I didn't think they had a lot of flavor.  I'll stick to one of my usual kabob recipes next time.

WOW!!!!  I just made these for dinner tonight and talk about amazing!!  Some of the best chicken I have had in awhile.  My new favorite way to make chicken kabobs....the only things I did different was too add chopped minced garlic to the marinade mixture and seasoned black pepper...was all I had on hand...and used lower sodium soy sauce.  I made two batches of the marinade...one to be used for basting VERY often while grilling.  The chicken came out SUPER moist!  My neighbor stopped by while out grilling and saw what was cooking and said that she deffinately wanted this recipe!  Thanks for posting!!!

Loved this recipe although I added more vegetables (pineapple, white onion, bell peppers (white yellow and red) and water chestnuts) and cooked it as a stir fry.  AWESOME!!!

I made this for a second time. We marinated the chicken and veggies for 3-4 hours. The taste was better. We used mushrooms with this recipe and they were our favorite.

This is a wonderful recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing it.  I think this would be good without the onions and just as a marinade for chicken.  We were really pleased with this!

The best tasting marinade ever!  Be sure to make a little extra.  I marinated overnight and the flavors just soaked in.  Great recipe.

This was some of the best chicken I have ever had. We use whole bone-less skinless chicken breast and left them in the marinade for 5 1/2 hours. Next time I will marinate overnight. Even my husband who hates everything ate 2 whole chicken breast!!! Can't what to make this into a chicken sandwich for lunch today!!!!

So, so, so good!  I used both red and yellow peppers, since I had both on hand, and used chopped garlic from a jar instead of the garlic cloves.  They ended up marinating for 24 hours because my husband had to work late the night I was intending to cook them, and they were incredibly tasty.  I also added cherry tomatoes to the kabobs, but I didn't marinate those--they won't stand up to it.

I added some ginger to the marinade, and used shrimp and pineapple on the kabob's in addition to the chicken. First time I made it I used chicken breast just purchased, second time I defrosted chicken breasts and it was not nearly as good.

Really good the first time, and goes well with a glass of chilled Kim Crawford 2006 Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.

I thought this was just kind of ... boring, I guess. I marinated it overnight to make sure the flavor stayed with the chicken, but it didn't seem to help. Not a bad recipe, just not exciting enough to want to make again.

This was amazing, to this day from the first time I made them, I am using the marinade for all kinds of chicken.  Tonight for example, I marinated my chicken thighs and legs, for two plus hours...and then grilled, and used bbq sauce ... it was AMAZING !! If I do say so myself ;p

These were awesome!  I made them for my Dad for Father's Day.  Everyone liked them and there are a couple of picky eaters in our group.  The flavor was excellent and the chicken was so moist.  I doubled the marinade and added extra veggies like squash, zucchini, mushrooms and cherry tomatoes.

Wonderful!  I marinaded for 24 hours, used zucchini, mushrooms and a vidalia onion.  There were no left overs.  Yum, this will become a regular in our home.  I cooked using my broiler for 12 minutes.

These were so great!  I forgot to put in the garlic, which I'm sure would make them even better.  I marinated the chicken for 2 hours and had good flavor, but will probably marinate for longer next time.  I especially liked that I always have these ingredients on hand.

WOW, what a great recipe.  We only marinated the chicken for 15-20 minutes, and it was still awesome.  I recommend making more of the "marinade" than the recipe calls for if you want to have enough for all the vegetables.  I used mushrooms, bell peppers, cherry tomoatoes and white onion.  SO good.

This was so easy and very good. The taste is mild which I like and the chicken was very moist. I decreased the amt of oil a tad as well. Would make it again.

Very good recipe!  My toddlers even ate these.  Chicken was really tender and the veggies were good too.  I marinated overnight.  Next time I will cook the chicken/veggies seperately.  The veggies cooked quicker than the chicken did.  I used chicken, red onion, red pepper and mushrooms.

What a great marinade.
I cut up chicken, onions, zucchini and yellow peppers and my husband I both loved it!.  I only marinated for about an hour, but it was very flavorful.

I just made this last and WOW! I marinated it overnight and put the meat on one skewer, peppers and onions on another, cherry tomatoes and mushrooms on 2 others -- the tomatoes and mushrooms cook fast.  I made enough for leftovers, but there weren't any.  Excellent recipe -- very tasty.  This ones a keeper!  Thanks!

I thought these were ok. Would not make again. I marinaded them overnight and they still didn't have much flavor.

I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours and added mushrooms to the kebabs. They were very simple to make and tasted great.

THESE ARE AWESOME!  I made it with 1 kilo of chicken thigh fillets instead of breast fillets.  Very tender.  Marinated overnight with the vegetables and added pineapple while threading through the skewer.  A big hit with the kids 6 and 4 years old.  These will make about 12.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.  G'day to all!

This was a great recipe! We will definitely make it again. I used low sodium soy sauce in the marinade. I changed around the vegetables, because I don't care for peppers and onions by themselves. Instead, I used zucchini, pineapple pieces, bacon, and fresh mushrooms. I marinated the zucchini and mushrooms with the chicken for about 3 hours. My husband said it was a keeper. I served it with Lipton mushroom rice, which went really well with it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I hate to be a party pooper, but this recipe is for those who like salt. I made 6 boneless chicken breast with the marinade and made 6 with Italian dressing marinade. I had more salt in a quarter piece of chicken than I had in the last month! The Italian chicken disappeared and everyone said that they did not care for the taste of this recipe...too salty. I'll stay with my old faithful, Italian dressing marinade.

The marinade was out of this world.  I marinated chicken breasts for about 6 hours and then basted often while grilling.  I also added two cloves of chopped garlic to the marinade.  It was just delicious!  Hoghly recommend.

DELICIOUS!!!  I marinated my chicken and onions together for a full day [I didn't have the other veggies on hand to marinate with].  I soaked my wooden skewers in water beforehand...just make sure they don't dry out before you use them :) **Add whole MUSHROOMS!!** They totally have an awesome flavor!  This is going to be a summertime favorite!!

These were so tasty and a big hit with dinner guests.  I tripled the marinade since I had an ample supply of the ingredients on hand (used lower sodium soy sauce), but only included the garlic with the batch for the chicken which I marinaded overnight.  I did the 2nd batch with green/red/yellow bell peppers and vidalia onions for about 8 hours, and the 3rd with mushrooms (was afraid they'd get mushy if I soaked them as long as the other veggies, so only did those a couple hours).  Plenty of marinade from the veggie bags available for basting.  My husband is not too crazy about vegetables but really loved these, and I've got a bag marinading right now to skewer w/o meat and grill as a side dish tonight.

This was a good recipe but we forgot to keep adding the marinade while it cooked so it was not as flavorful as I thought it would be.  I did however let it marinade overnight and I thought that would have been good enough but I guess not.  So make sure you marinade while cooking it too!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I doubled the marinade and used half to marinate the chicken for about five hours.  I marinated zucchini and mushrooms for two hours.  The chicken is very flavorful and tender and the veggies are out of this world, especially the mushrooms.  I think I may marinate the mushrooms and throw them on a skewer next time I grill steak.  YUM!  I have made this twice in two weeks.  Delicious and healthy.

I lessened the soy sauce, after reading some previous complaints about the soy flavor being too strong.  The result is a subtle but tasty marinade.  Easy to make.  I'll use it again.

Marinated the chicken a little less than 2 hours and the taste was great. Must be even better after one night. A definite do-again! ETA: The last time I made them, I let them sit 24h in the fridge and they were INCREDIBLE. One of the best things I've ever eaten...

Very promising taste. Mine wasn't such a success, but will continue trying to make them to perfection. Some meat uncooked, marinade started to burn on the food. Was probably my electrical grill. Fully cooked ones were immaculent. I will try this again.

I like to assemble these the night before so they can marinade in the sauce. We have taken these camping and grilled them over the open camp fire. The kids request this all the time. I have added steak and pork to the meat, too.

Yummy!  I'd probably put the chicken on a separate skewer from the veggies though, because the chicken took longer to cook than the veggies and the veggies ended up burned on the edges.  I used red onion, cherry tomatoes, and red and green bell peppers.

Great marinade, but way too salty. Will make again, but will use low sodium soy sauce or less regular soy sauce. Do not marinade the vegetables with chicken. They will fall apart when you try to skewer them. I also added pineapple chunks. Makes the meat very moist.

I did not change this recipe, but did not get a chance to marinate this either, and my husband loved the flavor especially on the mushrooms.  I am going to try this again, but I will definitely marinate longer.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were just delish! We grilled them with cedar chips, and they turned out sooo good! I marinated them for about 5-6 hours, and used red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, onion, and whole mushrooms. I added more minced garlic than what was called for because I'm a garlic lover, and I also doubled the marinade. The mushrooms and red bells were my fave. Everyone loved these!

Okay, but not great.  I won't make this again.  The flavor was not very earth shattering as other reviews would leave you to believe, just very ordinary.

this was excellent, but i did add a splash of orange juice and a little bit of lemon juice to soften the taste of the soy sauce. i also didn't kabob, i cooked chunks of chucken with carrots in the sauce on the stovetop after marinating for only 45 mionutes. delicious, everyone ate it all! even their vegetables!

Great marinade!  I added pineapple juice also.  I used it on cut pieces of round steak and salmon also.  Tastes wonderful on all.  I am going to make up the sauce ahead and keep in fridge to have ready.

This recipe is absolutely incredible. I could have licked my plate!!  I definitely recommend added 1-2 tsp of Montreal Steak Seasoning and marinating 24 hours at least.  I used 10 breasts, doubled the marinade and it served 9 people (4 of which were men!).

I LOVE this recipe.  I make it as often as I can get away with.  I've found, that it's the very best when you marinate for a day or so.  The chicken is saturated with the yummy honey flavor!  We always put it with bell peppers and cherry tomatoes and mushrooms and onions.  I think I'll go make it again... right now.

I marinaded whole chicken breasts and cooked them on the grill instead of cubing chicken and using as kebobs.  The flavour was still incredible and the chicken was incredibly moist.  My husband said a definite "do again".  Used the leftover chicken in wraps for lunch - a bit of barbeque sauce, sauteed onions and melted cheese - was delicious too!  Good recipe.

If I could give this more stars, I would! I let this marinade for 2 hours and it was amazing! We didn't use all of what we prepared so I let it marinade overnight and I heated it all up in a pan for lunch and it was even better! This recipe is a keeper! I'm definitely going to try this marinade on steak and even hamburgers! Just scrumptious!

This has a really great flavor.  I cooked mine on the George Foreman grill and it was a hit.  I served the chicken and vegetables with baked potatoes but in retrospect wish I had done rice instead... I think that might go best with this dish.  Also, I highly recommend yellow squash in the vegetables-  this was the best part!!!

These were good but a little heavy on the soy sauce. Next time I think I'll cut it down somewhat. Aside from that, they were pretty tasty. The flavor reminded me of the pot stickers you get in a chinese restaurant only grilled, not fried. This recipe is definitely worth trying.

Excellent!  This tasted like a sort of teriyaki sauce.  I cooked mine under the broiler.  I believe you can use any combination of vegetables and meats you like - I added pieces of chopped yellow squash and bay scallops.

I marinated these for about six hours and they were great, I had the BBQ too high and they were a little burnt but still delicious.  I suggest using chicken thighs, they're cheaper and they don't get as dry as chicken breasts can because they're dark meat not light.

I was so disappointed after reading so many good reviews.  I marinated some chicken breasts for about 24 hours but I found them to be too salty which I'm sure is from the soy sauce.  I would probably go with low sodium soy sauce next time...if I ever make it again.

These were great! I put these on my Foreman grill and they were delicious. I bet they're even better on an outdoor grill. Great recipe!

So simple, and soooo delicious!  My father's bbq sauce recipe used to be the favorite for chicken in my house.  That was until I began making these kabobs!  There aren't usually many left over in my house!

This is a great recipe and easy to make! The hardest part is chopping up the veggies and chicken. It is also great on a busy work day. I chop everything up the night before and marinate it in the fridge. When I get home from work I stick it on the grill. Great dinner! I also added crimni mushrooms. YUM!

Loved this recipe! I only used 2 chicken breasts so I had to cut the marinade down some. But both my boyfriend and I loved it. We have his daughters family over for dinner a lot on weekends and we both said we need to make this for them one weekend. I paired it with roasted red potatoes.

Recipe turned out really good- next time i will add a little salt to my chicken before cooking, just because I enjoy the sweet / salty taste. Chicken stayed moist and peppers really absorbed the flavors! I marinated both overnight.

I’ve made this many times and always double the marinade.  I also add mushrooms along with lots of sweet onion, zucchini and red peppers.  Delicious and the best part is leftovers reheat well for lunch or another dinner (I love “two-fers”)!  A great summer dinner...

I make this all the time at my fire station. Everyone loves it and even compliments it. And if you’ve ever worked at a fire department you know it’s almost impossible to get a compliment. I change nothing about this recipe. It’s perfect.

Moist and flavorful!
I marinated the chicken and vegetables in separate zip lock bags. The chicken marinate was discarded but I used the vegetable bag marinate to brush on kabobs while cooking. The longer you marinate, the better the flavor. Be creative with your vegetables or fruit on your kabobs. I used pineapple chunks ( added some of the juice to both marinates)  and fresh semi-soft peach chunks with my chicken and veggies. Sprinkled toasted sesame seeds before serving. YUM!

I really didn’t want kabobs, so I marinated some chicken breasts with just the marinade about 24 hrs and cooked them. They were good.

There is definitely the basics for a great recipe in here. I made the recipe twice now and I learned from the first time to make the second time better. Given this is honey and soy sauce mainly, add some chopped fresh ginger root and some rice vinegar (if you have some on hand). I also like crushed pepper flakes. Add more veggies than stated in the recipe, just onions is boring. I used red peppers, yellow peppers, orange peppers, red onions, zucchini and yellow squash. I marinate overnight. Before starting to grill, oil your grill well in between every nook and cranny because this will stick otherwise. Get a ramkin full with vegetable oil and a brush, and brush liberally. I cooked on 400+ degree heat (gas grill) for 10 minutes, and it came out perfect.

I added crushed red chili peppers, used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and omitted the garlic “because I forgot to add them”  It was a success! My husband continues to comment on how delicious the meal was. This one is a 5* favorite!

My husband really liked these honey chicken kabobs. He even took a picture of his plate and put it on facebook! Me? I thought it was excellent and easy to make.

I’m not necessarily blaming the recipe but it didn’t turn out like I had hoped. I followed the recipe for the marinade and doubled it because it seemed like there was a lot of chicken and vegetables and not much marinade. For vegetables I used red onion, red bell pepper and mushrooms. I also added some fresh pineapple. I marinated it for about 2 hours and cooked it on the barbecue and it looked delicious. But what ruined it for me was that the chicken, although moist, had almost a starchy taste. I don’t know why yet it did.

This was amazing!  I followed the advice of others and added pineapples.  I also forgot to add the garlic, but it was still very tasty.  I marinated the chicken and vegetables in separate containers for about 10 hours.  I am having the leftovers for lunch now and it tastes even better today than it did last night.  I will definitely add this recipe to my rotation.

We loved this dish. Simple recipe with a classic kabob taste. Only had two hours to marinade but certainly returned great flavor. A meat thermometer for the chicken assures correct doneness without overlooking. Keeper.

I followed the recipe as written and I thought it was bland. Probably cooking them in the oven with the sauce would be a lot better.

Amazing, amazing, amazing. I used three large chicken breasts along with a bell pepper and purple onion. Tasted wonderful. Followed ingredients exactly and marinated for 24 hours in the fridge. FYI, I forgot to set aside some of the marinade for basting and it still tasted amazing and was juicy.

I didn't make any changes to the measurements or ingredients. I did double the amount of marinade and I agree with others that if you don't you won't have enough. 

I didn't think it was great  but it was good. I'm in no rush to make it again but I will at some point during the summer.

This was meh.  There wasn’t enough marinade to even cover the bottom of the skewers and even rotated the kabobs during marinade time.  I only had time to marinade a little over 2 hours. Maybe if I had marinated overnight it  would have made a difference.  As it was, the honey was the dominating flavor even with using 3 cloves of garlic and it was ever so slight.  The only difference I made was to add fresh mushrooms on the skewers and the extra garlic clove. I served it with wild rice.  My simple old stand-by kabob recipe is still the best....2/3 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup olive oil then double to at least cover half way up. Sorry Ann Marie

I am an experienced cook and usually have to modify recipes to suit my family's taste, but this recipe is absolute perfection. It's such a simple dish that my husband was very skeptical at first, but it has become a family favorite during BBQ season. I use whole chicken tenders on skewers and it's fantastic every time!

I’ve made this several times! It’s always so delicious that we end up eating too much! I’m not a fan of soy sauce, so I don’t add as much. We’ve made this for guest and I a,ways get asked for the recipe.

Great recipe, but don't let the picture fool you, don't cook meet and veg next to each other, they both require different cooking times to do well.  I split up my veg and chicken to different kebabs.  Grilled the veg on the side with no burner and off heat with the chicken on direct heat.

So so so good!  I used lite soy sauce to reduce the sodium but kept everything else the same.  Since the grill ran out of propane 5 minutes into cooking, I had to cook the skewers on a cast iron griddle that had ridges to give the same marks as the grill.  It worked perfectly!  My side dish was yellow rice and was the perfect with the kabobs. I will definitely make this dish again.

I've made this recipe numerous times and love it (although I just grill the chicken as tenders - no skewers, no veggies). Tonight however, I had once again forgotten to marinate and my griller was watching football. So, I pulled out my instant pot and gave it a try and I am doing this from now on!  Used 1lb of chicken, 1/2 c low sodium soy sauce, 1/2 c honey, garlic, and 1/2 c chicken broth. Poured it over the chicken and cooked my chicken on high pressure as I normally do.  On the side, I made some white rice and also sauteed mixed veggies/peppers and peanuts in with some olive oil and sesame seed oil in my wok.  Chicken was flavorful and tender and tasted great with the side veggies and rice.  And better yet, I was able to use the "marinade" to pour over the top of everything. Family loved it too!

Very easy to make with simple ingredients!  I made the recipe exactly as it said and I marinated the chicken and the veggies in seperate zip lock bags over night.  I made 12 servings for the chicken marinade and 6 servings for the veggies marinade and found it to be perfect.  I also added mushrooms and tomatoes (like the recipe suggests).  I didn’t marinate the tomatoes though because I love the flavor of grilled tomatoes as is.  I skewered the veggies and chicken separately Incase the chicken needed longer but they both were perfectly done at about the same time.   I’ll def make again, flavorful and easy!

This marinade was perfect. I also took the other reviewer’s suggestion of doubling the sauce. My husband loved it as an extra dipping sauce.

I enjoyed the light honey flavor and it was easy to put together. I would add a lot more garlic next time to get it a deeper flavor. The chicken was very moist and I loved that the onions were still crunchy will a light bite.

Very good! Ingredients are things that you probably already have or can get easily. I marinated for about 4 hours before grilling and it came out perfect.

A sweet take on chicken kabobs! I have a large family so I  ended up quadrupling the marinade. I added a tablespoon of red pepper flakes to add some heat and I left it marinading for about 24 hours. The whole family loved these sweet and spicey chicken kabobs!

Excellent recipe...I decided to add approximately 1 1/2 cups crushed pineapple to the marinade, as well as some brown sugar and creole spice.also used red onion, cherry tomatoes and sweet peppers on the skewers. Tip: add some additional oil to the marinade before brushing while on the grill.

I followed the directions, except I used more peppers and less onion as my wife does not like onion so a few of the kabobs were just chicken and peppers.  Flavor is really god and very simple to make.

I followed the recipe as stated except used gluten free soy sauce and made the kabobs all vegetables, no meat. My guests raved about these, especially the ones with diet restrictions. I will make these again for future party events. Easy, delicious and inexpensive to make. Who could ask for more?

This marinade may be good to baste on and not marinade in... tasted too thick and sweet

I let this marinate for 24 hours. Everyone loved it. I did the chicken on skewers separate from the vegetables. I marinated the vegetables in the same blend.

Recipe is amazing as is...thank you for sharing! I did double the recipe as others suggested if you like to have extra sauce to drizzle on after. Also did all veggie kabobs and combo chicken/veggie kabobs. All of the kabobs came out amazing. Even my kiddos ate them!

Made this tonight, was a big hit.  I did not marinate the vegetable just brushed them with reserved marinade when barbecuing.  Excellent, definitely a keeper!

It was SO good when i made it!! I decided to add pineapples to give it flavor and it totally worked!! I advise that you put more marinade and make more so you have enough.

9/9/17 - Made for mom's weekend away - prepped all the chicken and veggies ahead of time and marinated for about 24 hours. For veggies, I used:  cherry tomato, mushroom, red and green pepper, yellow squash, zucchini and onion.  I did skewer the chicken and put it on the grill about 10 minutes earlier than the veggies to give it time to cook.  Everything was good but not knockout.   I made this for our family this week and added about a tblspoon of ginger so I will post back to review!

My dinner guests raved about these. Very moist chicken, we barbecue them on low heat to cook them slower. 
I added mushrooms to the marinade!
I'll make these more often as it really extends chicken breasts for a dinner party!

I made this and added some ginger and garlic to the marinade as some said it didn't have enough flavor.  I marinated the chicken overnight and was very disappointed, the chicken was just so so, not a lot of flavor. Won't be making again.

I followed this exactly.  It turned out really well.  Made too much, wish the amounts of chicken were given in pounds not #of chicken breasts.  Definitely make more sauce to baste with.  It is not a heavily seasoned marinade.  I used a low-salt soy and honestly, it wouldn't have been bad with regular soy sauce.  It actually may have needed it.  When I make this next time, I may skewer the chicken and veggies first and put it in a bowl.  It would be much easier than threading the meat and veggies after marinating.  Will make again.

Ended up marinating it for over a day due to a schedule change, but it still tasted great.

To die for!  We loved it!  I used cherry tomatoes and zucchini and mushrooms, on top of everything else.  The marinade is so simple, but tasty.  I'll make these all year long, whether on my charcoal grill or in the oven.  Phenomenal!

I made the recipe exactly as instructed and they came out perfectly.  Cooked massive quantites for my entire neighborhood National Night Out event and everyone loved them - adults, kids and all the police officers who stopped by.  Have since made it for my family and am making again tonight.  I think you will love it as much as we do.

They  were delicious! The only change I made was I used maple syrup Instead of honey only because I didn't have any. I also added zucchini. Brought them to a cookout & everyone loved them. It takes time to prepare, but worth it...

I liked this. You can use any vegetables with the chicken. I did pineapple, red, green, orange and yellow bell peppers, and onions.

Sous Andy had it right on the money. I read andys review after I marinaded my chicken and veggies in separate bags and I marinaded it all over night! I almost forgot about soaking my wooden skewer sticks thanks Andy ???? ?? I never measure Since  I've been cooking since I was a youngin so if your following measurements I'd definitely be doubling up! This sure will be delicious for dinner tonight and left overs are amazing!!

This recipe was delicious!  My step daughter said "that chicken was bangin," which I am pretty sure is a good thing.  :)  made it exactly as the recipe states and it was perfect.  Made it with various grilled veggies, white rice, and the recipe for "grilled marinated shrimp."  Delish!

This is such a good recipe.  Only thing I did differently was that I used low-sodium teriyaki sauce instead of the soy sauce (picked up the wrong sauce) but the favor is great.  I only did the chicken without the veggies since we were having salads with the meal.  Will definitely make it again.

This was delicious. I made the amount of marinade the recipe called for but used 1lbs of chicken breast (about 1.5 chicken breasts), basted the skewers twice and had left over marinade. Next time, if it's just the hubby and me I'll make the same amount to have again for another night of leftovers but definitely need 2lbs meat and more veggies if there's 3 or more people.  Thanks for a delicious recipe. 
Oh and I did marinade for about 30 hours - I had planned to have it same day but life got in the way and cooked it the next night.

Absolutely delicious! I made it just as directed but only had time to marinate for 1 hour. Still came out awesome. I thought I made too much and would have leftovers, but after the first bite, there was no stopping. Thank you!

Fabulous!  I double the sauce, and let it marinate as long as I can -- it's extra amazing when it marinates overnight.  a MAJOR hit in my house with my 7 & 3 year olds.  Must have made close to 20 times alrerady

Very good recipe. My kids loved the chicken, just demolished it. One recommendation from me is to lower the grill temp and make sure you set enough marinade aside for basting. I didn't and had to whip some up quick again while grilling. So again, lower heat and more basting marinade. 

Enjoy

I went totally rogue on this because I didn't have fresh veggies on hand and didn't feel like mincing garlic. Therefore, I threw in garlic powder (1/4 tsp vs one clove is the exchange), onion powder (1 tsp per onion) and cayenne pepper (1 tsp per pepper). The only thing I didn't change at all was the honey and black pepper! (I used canola vs. vegetable oil and I make my own salt-free soy sauce).

I agree with doubling the liquid ingredients. I marinated skinless boneless chicken breasts for 24 hours in the fridge and broiled on high for 15 minutes using a cast iron skillet in a gas oven. (I flipped halfway through).

I couldn't give this a bad review, because it inspired me! But I like the little mix of stuff I threw together ;)

This was a hit!  I doubled the batch and used boneless skinless chicken thighs and partially cooked sweet italian chicken sausage with red pepper, orange peppers, yellow peppers, mushrooms, zucchini, and red onion.  Marinated altogether overnight.  Then when my husband cooked them, I also had some fresh pineapple on separate skewers for him to cook too.  Colorful and delicious.

This was an excellent  recipe. I made it Asian  style and added garlic past. I marinated it for all night to more tender. Honey mixing makes deference sweet flavor. Really it was  wonderful  post. Thanks.

Made with chicken, onion, cherry tomatoes, red bell peppers and zucchini.  Mixed meat and veggies on the skewers and BBQ'd on low.  Turned out great!

After changes to recipe it tasted good, I added more honey and some brown sugar. Without those additional ingredients it tasted way too much soy/oil not enough honey. We marinated about 30 mins and did personal skewers.

I made this recipe exactly as posted... and next time will make more sauce to baste the kebabs with!  I marinated in a zip lock bag overnight.  Wrapped the grilled kebabs in foil a let the rest for a few minutes. Chicken was moist and tender; peppers and onions had a very light crisp to them. Excellent recipe!

Easy and delicious marinade.  Made separate veggie and chicken kabobs and both were good.  Also good without the garlic.  Next time will try it on chicken breasts rather than kabobs!

Followed the recipe, but did make extra marinade, and will triple it next time---so delicious. We served it with orzo and it was great. Will be a company pleaser also, and once things are skewered, very easy. Oh, pineapple IS imortant, and I will add tomatoes the next time. A Keeper for sure.

Tasted okay, but the orange flavor did not come through. Chicken was not tender. Great for leftovers, though! Chicken was even more tender after microwaving the next night.

I am happy I made the full amount of sauce for only 1/2 the amount of chicken.  Had just enough.  Marinade was delicious.  I added pineapple on the skewers.

Amazing! So simple to make and tastes delicious! Instead of making kabobs, I just made chicken thighs with this marinade with a side of grilled veggies in a balsamic vinegar marinade. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Made it as written and it was yummy.  Lots of flavor after marinating for about 24 hours.  I did the veggies separate so that nothing got over or under cooked.  Reheated in microwave next day and still moist and delicious.  A keeper for sure.  Thanks

Made this for a barbecue party and everybody raved about how good it was. Followed recipe exactly. Probably marinated it for about a day and a half only because I didn't cook it the night I thought I was going to… I think that only added to its flavor. Would definitely recommend and will  surely make again this summer.

This dish was fantastic! Subbed in EVOO for veggie oil and only used 4 chicken breasts. The marinade was just enough for the chicken to marinate and a little left over to baste the chicken while grilling. Had to make a second batch to marinate the veggies so definitely double the marinade recipe!!

Absolutely the best chicken marinade recipe that I have found!  We've had it twice in less than a week.  The only change I made is that I added 1 "squirt" of lime juice (about 1 tsp).  We have made it with grilled chicken breasts and vegetables and also used it to marinate drumsticks and grill those---both turned out great.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that we will use time and time again!

This is a great base recipe however, I made a few changes to it and it was amazing! Note that I did double the recipe as well to make sure I had enough. I added 2 teaspoons of ground ginger and 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic. I used only one third of the honey and substituted 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of water. I added approximately 2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes to give it that spicy/sweet Asian kick. I marinated both chicken breast and sirloin steak chunks for about 4 hours. I had reserved a lot of marinate to use as I cooked the kabobs and even had enough left over to served as a dipping sauce. My husband raved over the kabobs!

Delicious.  Added some fresh ginger to the marinade.  I marinated (and cooked) chicken and veggies separately as another reviewer did.  Brought these to a cook-out and received lots of compliments.

This was easily one of the tastiest dishes I've ever made from this website and it was insanely simple. I made it exactly as recommended. My husband actually grilled it over wood and it gave it a very smokey and sweet flavor.  If unable to grill over wood, maybe a few drops of liquid smoke would do the trick? Amazing flavor, make this simple dish!

I absolutely loved this recipe! The flavor and aroma were phenomenal. I added about 1/2 tea spoon of finely chopped habanero pepper for a spicy sweet touch and used poblano peppers instead of bell peppers. I grilled corn on the cob and served it with white sticky rice.

These are delicious and easy! I let the chicken and veggies marinate together and it was delicious and flavorful.

This is the recipe I use on all of my Kabobs.  I marinate the Chicken, Shrimp, and Veges in separate bags.  I skewer them separately too as they all have different cook times and heat on the BBQ.

If using a super cooker (indoors) at home, the best temperature is 350 F, cook in total 10 min, turn after 5 min. I didn't want char or dry chicken so temperature is lower. Overall good!

These were pretty good, though I found even after marinating the chicken most of the day it didn't impart much flavour. We all liked it, but I will keep looking for a recipe that has more flavour on the chicken. Served this with Mac and cheese for a full meal.

Yum!! Usually marinate about 2-4 hours.  I don't measure just eyeball and add lots of garlic and a shake of ginger and pepper flakes as well.  Easy yummy dinner for all.

I followed the recipe for the marinade, but only had 2 chicken breasts in the fridge, and only a few hours to marinate, but this was delicious!  The flavor was great and the meat was tender.  I increased the veggies significantly since I had less chicken to work with and broiled instead of grilled, but this will be a regular meal in our family.

Very delicious and easy. I doubled the sauce for about 4 chicken breast halves. Also used powdered garlic.  Turned oven to 500 degrees, with a cookie sheet near the broiler. Then put marinated meat and veggies on the cookie sheet, and switched the oven to broil. Broiled for about 10 minutes.

WOW!  This is outstanding.  I broiled my chicken first about seven minutes turned over and broiled the other side five minutes.  I used boneless, skinless thighs.  Then I broiled cubed zucchini, mushrooms, onions and red peppers.  The leftovers were even better.  Thank You for this wonderful recipe.

This is a great kabob recipe - I've sent it to 100% of the people that I made it for.  I'm glad I saw the reviews indicating to double up the sauce and kept the veggies / chicken apart in the fridge for a day.

I added a little less soy sauce and substituted peanut oil instead of vegetable oil, but other than that followed the recipe.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it, including some picky eaters.

This is a very good staple recipe. Nice and easy to make changes based on cupboard availability. I had enough sauce without having to add anything. My only change was to skewer the chicken and vegetable separately, they cook better that way and people who only want veggies don't have to pick around :)

I was skeptical when I tasted the marinade - I didn't think  it tasted good at all - BOY WAS I WRONG.  These skewers are amazing!  I doubled the sauce like everyone suggested.  I marinated overnight - the chicken in one bag and the vegetables (onions, red pepper, mushroom and zucchini) in another one.  I put together 3 types of skewers - chicken only; vegetables only; and a mix between chicken and vegetables - all were AMAZING.  I had no problem with the chicken/vegetable mixed skewers finishing on time (I used the hand 2 inches above for 3 seconds rule and it worked perfectly).  This will be my go-to skewers recipe.  It was the juiciest chicken skewers I've ever had (and I DID NOT baste while on the grill at all).  The guests couldn't stop eating them.  I tripled the recipe and had no problems!!  A must!

Made this many times! Great recipe, as is! Now I triple the marinade, use all boneless, skinless, thighs and add pineapple juice to the marinade. It's best left in marinade for 1-2 days. I even prep meat, add marinade and freeze for a later time. I have 1 in the freezer now! Always do veggies separate and I don't freeze those.

Mmm! Can't say enough good things about this recipe. Great flavour all around. Chicken was moist and tender and delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers: used half the amount of chicken but kept the full amount of marinade which essentially doubled the marinade; marinated the chicken and veggies in separate freezer bags, that way I could use the veggie marinade for basting instead of discarding it; and put the chicken and each different veggie on separate skewers so that each would be done according to its own needs. I also used mushrooms, but did not marinate them because they were part of a last minute dash to the grocery store and I didn't have them in advance. Next time I would definitely marinate the mushrooms as well. Served over steamed jasmine rice, it was a memorable meal. One more thing - it couldn't be easier. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good.  Boyfriend liked it.  I think it was lacking a bit in flavor.  I marinated it for over 2 hours.  If I made again, I would marinate it overnight, which might make a difference.

Made this last night for dinner!! Omg!! It was the BEST CHICKEN EVER! The flavor was amazing. I did add zucchini to marinade but cooked them on the grill separately. The company we had over was in love with this recipe. This will def be on our menu again and again.

I followed the recipe exactly but was disappointed with the texture of the chicken it was a little mushy , I did marinate over night not sure if it was to long but the veggies we're fine. I did marinate the chicken separate from the veggies .

the marinade is excellent.  I followed some of the other reviews and doubled the sauce, crushed the garlic when I added it to the marinade and added more veggies like: zucchini, yellow pepper, red onion and cherry tomatoes.  After I had skewered all we needed, I still had some chicken chunks and veggies leftover so I stir fried the chicken in a bit of sesame oil, then removed the meat and stir fried the veggies.  I added the meat back in to heat them all up together and added a bit of the marinade which I had thickened.  Scrumptious!! I just might make it this way next time and skip the kabobs...

Very good and very easy. I ran out of honey and used agave. I'm also using a touch of cayenne next time and there will be a next time. I marinated 4 hours in the fridge and had less chicken so I had enough sauce.

Love it. Very good. We followed the recipe, minus the onions, which we substituted for green onions instead, and we added some pineapple on the skewers as recommended. Doubled the sauce. Put the raw chicken into its own container to marinade over night. We added some green onions and garlic to that container. We put the veggies in their own container to marinade as well. I didn't really taste the sauce on the veggies, but it was great on the chicken. We basted during grilling as suggested, but we didn't do it more than once or twice, and it still came out flavorful and delicious. Served with rice and watermelon (which was surprisingly delicious alongside this chicken, nice cool flavor inbetween the yummy chicken bites).

I didn't use the exact same vegetables called for in the recipe, but I'm giving 4.5 stars to the marinade and chicken. I minced the garlic and added it to the marinade before the meat and vegetables, and then I let everything marinate for 6 hours. I used separate skewers for meat and vegetables so I could pull things off as they finished. I forgot to baste while grilling, but everything was still flavorful and tender.

Great recipe.  I used 4 large chicken breasts but kept the sauce measurements the same and it made plenty for 5 adults with leftovers.  The chicken stayed moist on the grill while the veggies cooked to the perfect firmness.  I made our kabobs with pineapple, onions, zucchini, green and red peppers, and chicken.  I will be making this again as everyone really enjoyed them.

This was OK. Marinated everything over night and it gave the veggies a weird, overly slimy texture and I feel like the oil prevented the marinade from actually soaking in and flavoring the meat. The flavor was good, there just wasn't enough, even with the basting while cooking and doubling the sauce recipe as suggested. Maybe I'll try it again without the oil, but I'll keep looking too.

This was just ok. I ended up broiling this in the oven and the savings grace to this were the juices that accumulated in my roasting pan which I poured over our rice and kabobs.  If I had grilled it and didn't have those juices the kabobs would have been flavorless.  I did HAVE to add more honey when prepared the marinade. I did have some leftovers (which is rare) and I was told that it did taste better the next day.

Delicious and simple!!! Definitely go with the grill if you have one. It adds incredible flavor, but be careful about charring the bobs. I love this recipe for many reasons, but mostly because there are only a few ingredients, all of which I already have at home.

Yep definitely Yummy!  I marinated for 30 + hours. Would not marinate the veggies again though. They don't need it and became soggy.  DEFINITELY double the sauce!   I think high heat is too much as I always tend to over cook the chicken and did this time but still great.  My small chicken chunks actually cooked faster than my veggies. Thanks for the recipe!  Have wanted to cook this for quite some time and was not disappointed!

This is a great marinade for tender chicken! The flavor was delicious with the chicken and the veggies. Small chunks of chicken cook in the same time as the veggies. I added zucchini and substituted purple onion and all the veggies were tender crisp. I'm considering adding pineapple to the mix as well!   Don't forget to glaze them as they cook I believe it makes a big difference in the flavor. I served it over a bed of brown rice cooked in chicken stock.  We liked it so well that we are adding it to our rotation!

Excellent!  I marinated chicken breasts before cooking them on the grill.  I didn't have as much time to marinate as I would have liked, and they were still excellent!  I'm going to try someone elses suggestion and try it on a stir fry!

Now summer is around the corner I can go back to planning weekend BBQ and this has been crowd favorite for the past couple of years. Follow recipe as is and made two batches. One with chicken and one with steak. I like colors so I also added green and orange bell peppers to the mix they looked  and tasted amazing. I wish I can give this recipe more than five stars.

It was a good basic marinade, but too bland for my taste, I prefer spicy and extremely flavorful foods. My roommates though loved it. I'm going to add Cajun seasoning or some Tabasco sauce next time. I also put it in a zip lock bag with the chicken for 24 hours before I put it on the grill. I recommend fresh pineapple.  That made a huge difference and grilled was delicious.

This turned out fantastically, I did both steak and chicken in the marinade over night.  Both meats had a different  flavor,  each delicious.

Very good recipe. I do however like to add my own spice mixes, and used only a small amount of soy sauce to avoid an overly salty flavor! thanks for the yummy dinner idea!

I was amazed with how the marinade turned out. I ended up using a garlic infused oil on top of the cloves (you can never have too much garlic). The honey and soy made a perfect combination for the chicken, sweet but not overly so. Next time I might add just a dash of sriracha or crushed red pepper for a little sweet and spicy spin.

This is a great marinade. I make kabobs all of the time and the flavor is just fantastic with this.  Couldn't be any simpler to make. I used zucchini and cherry tomatoes but the peppers and onions go together best with it. Stick with the recipe as written. I served it over buttered rice. Excellent!

I have made chicken kabobs using this marinade three times now. Each time it tastes better than before and everyone fights over the last kabob. I use red bell pepper, onion, and FRESH pineapple. Sometimes I add ground cumin or ginger to the marinade. I also use garlic powder instead of cloves. LOVE THIS RECIPE!

This is a great marinade, but we thought it was a tad too sweet for our tastes (we aren't sweet people! lol).  I will use this recipe again, but cut back on the honey.  I added a couple of pinches of ginger, too.  A nice change from the "same old" marinades.

We loved this recipe!   I made the marinade exactly as the recipe stated and marinated the chicken for about 4 hours.  It was the perfect amount of flavor without being too salty.   I marinated the veggies in a separate bowl the last 1-1/2 hrs.  I had some extra veggies in my refrigerator, so, I reduced the amount of onion and red pepper and added yellow squash, green pepper, & mushrooms.  It was a very tasty meal and I will definitely be making again.

These are wonderful!!! Thank you for the great recipe! I also did this last minute so I only marinated for about 45 minutes and they were amazing!! We will definitely be making these again very soon! I used two green bell peppers, 2 large onions, 1 yellow pepper, and 1 red pepper and chicken. And I also doubled the sauce!

This was easy and good. I made too many for my skewers so I saved the remaining for a quick stir fry lunch more or less. Drop everything in sauté pan after marinating, cook chicken through and enjoy. Start with really hot pan and decrease temp after browning. Making the soy sauce sizzle gives it a good flavor. I then served over rice.

This was fantastic!  I agree with doubling the marinade and setting some aside for drizzling or dipping later.  I used this recipe for both kabobs and chicken breasts cooked inside on a grill pan and outside on the grill.  Also made it once using Veri Veri Teriyaki in place of plain soy (it combines garlic, ginger, and toasted sesame seeds with preservative-free soy).  Highly recommended.  Love it, thank you for this recipe!

This is simple and straight forward. For sure worth making a bigger batch and putting the grilled leftovers in the fridge over night to really soak in every last bit of flavour!  A definite winner in our house!
You can adjust this recipe to your liking.  We always add some smoked paprika and cayenne to get some heat. Use some ginger for an asian touch (maybe along with some Chinese eggplants, yummy).

Recipe lives up to the hype. There was not one Kabob left. One lady said she was full but she just couldn't stop eating it. :D Some people asked for the "secret" sauce ;) It did taste a bit like teryaki sauce but not overwhelmingly so since I didnt put too much soy sauce

I made this recipe for a family BBQ. I marinated boneless chicken breasts overnight and cooked them directly on the grill. I also marinated the veggies overnight. I ate the veggies only (which were great) but everyone who ate the chicken loved it and asked for the recipe. I cooked six breasts and lots of veggies so I trippled the sauce.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST kabobs I've ever had. I have used this recipe on pork as well. I used mushrooms also and marinate over night,it makes for very tender meat. This would be great on shrimp.

I followed Sous Andy's advice, and the kabobs were fantastic!  There is no need to put the different ingredients on separate skewers if you keep the grill heat at a lower heat.  I made these for family, and they loved them.

It sounds better than it tastes.  I soaked the meat in double the marinade, and still I felt like it was not as moist or as flavorful as I would have liked.  Hubby and I thought it was alright, and I might have worked to tweak it, but my picky-eater kids did not like it at all.  Bummer.

The recipe is great. I'd try adding some heat, (I.E. chili powder or a touch of cayenne) to the marinade. It complements the sweetness of the honey. Other than that it's a good recipe. Simple.

Made these with the ingredients as specified. I didnt jave time to marinate for very long. Only 35 minutes. The flavor was good. Would probably be greater if I could have marinated longer. Also, I forgot to pit them on medium low flame and they charred a bit on one side. I will definitely make these again!!

My family oohed and ahhed over this.  The chicken was heavenly. My husband said it tasted like restaurant Chinese chicken. I doubled the batch of sauce since it was so easy to make. Glad I did. It is truly scrumptious and still so healthy. This is a keeper at our house!  All my kids ages 2-12 loved it too!

I cut back on the amount of honey and perhaps should not have.  Also used thighs instead of breasts.  Were good but breasts may have made the difference.

Made this for family at the lake the other night.  Lots of flavor.  Made the recipe just as written, but marinaded overnight.  I did separately skewer the chicken and the veggies (Peppers, red onions, mushrooms).  Great recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  The kids loved it.  Marinated the chicken overnight.  Threaded chicken, onions, red peppers, mushrooms & pineapple onto skewers.  Basted with additional marinade (1.5 times the recipe).  Grilled, basting several times.  Served over rice.  Perfect summer dinner.

I doubled the marinade when we made this recipe, and grilled on a grill mat so the vegetables didn't burn. We put squash, zucchini, mushrooms and red peppers on ours instead of just onions and peppers. We also marinated overnight and did not baste ours while grilling, It was delicious!

So delicious! The marinade is perfect just the way it is written. Though I did double it so we had plenty to brush on while it cooked. We added mushrooms to the skewers too. No leftovers, even my 5 year old ate a ton!

Excellent!  I have a small boiler so it took longer - but just keep an eye on it.
I also added zucchini which was tasty!

I used chicken thighs instead of breast and the rest just followed the recipe - it was amazing! I always have a problem making my 2.5 year old twins eat meat - they were stuffing their mouth so fast, I had a hard time catching up and adding more to their plates! Making it again tomorrow.

Marinated overnight and placed on skewers.  Super duper easy and yummy! As previous posters recommeded - soak those skewer sticks prior to BBQ. Classic Honey Garlic flavour - can't wait to try it with wings (I used chicken breast this time).

I don't have a grill so I cooked these in the oven on a foil lined baking sheet at 350 for about 15-20 minutes. 

For the sauce, I reduced the soy sauce by a bit and added extra honey. I also added 2 tablespoons of ground ginger. I didn't have trouble with having too little, but I only do 2-3 chicken breasts at a time and made the amount of sauce in the recipe so if you're going to do more than that I'd suggest increasing the amount of sauce you make. 

When threading the chicken on the skewers, make sure to leave a bit of space between them. This helps them cook a bit faster and more evenly. If you're using wooden skewers, don't forget to soak them in water for a bit before cooking.

I followed some of the reviews' suggestions. I made 3x the marinate and marinated the veggies (1 orange pepper, 1 yellow pepper, 4 carrots, 1 sweet onion, 2 large zucchinis, 2 yellow squash, 12 oz of white mushrooms) and chicken separately for 22 hours. I also used low sodium soy sauce and sunflower oil. I was a bit confused on how to prepare the garlic so I just sliced fresh cloves and added it to the marinate after it was mixed. I also mixed the vegetables and chicken when I added it to the kabobs and it was still cooked perfectly. It had SO much flavor and wasn't mushy at all. No one needed salt or pepper. I used fresh chicken (not every frozen) and served with flavored rice. It is an extremely delicious and safe recipe. With so many people with allergies, special diets and different taste buds this recipe is extremely simple, easy and versatile when entertaining a large group. I've already been asked to send our dinner guest this recipe.

This was a great tasting kabob recipe. My husband loved it and said it was the best chicken on the grill he's ever tasted. I took the advice of a previous poster and put the chicken and vegetables on different skewers. I also added mushrooms, squash and tomatoes.

Tried this recipe and followed suggestions of other users by doubling the sauce and keeping it in overnight and even a bit longer. Suggestions say the longer the better so I figured why not keep it in the marinade for longer? When I prepared for grilling, the chicken turned out VERY mushy and the taste was unusual, and I think this was because I over-marinated (if thats possible) the vegatables were great however, I suggest to marinate everything for ONLY a few hours.That way the chicken wont be so mushy and fall off skewers while grilling.

Wonderful flavor, tender and juicy.  I substituted kariyaki sauce for the soy sauce to give it an asian kick.  Will make this often.

Perfect!  We served these for a backyard party and no one could get enough of them.  We made three different marinades that night and this was everyone's favorite BY FAR.  We did marinate the meat and veggies for 8+ hours.  The meat was tender and full of flavor.

I started to make these on my George Foreman grill, but noticed they were cooking to fast. So I put it in a pan and cooked it that way. I served over rice and it was amazing!! I was not expecting this to come out sooooo good. I only marinated for about 3-4 hours. No complaints or substitutions needed!!

Some of the *best* chicken I've ever made!  We loved this.  The only thing I did differently was to add zucchini and sprinkle a little of the sauce on the kabobs after grilling, too.  Oh!  And used Braggs amino acids instead of soy sauce--so much healthier and tastes exactly the same, highly recommended!  I was only able to marinate for about an hour, so that may not have been necessary if they had longer to soak up the flavor beforehand.  I separated chicken and vegetables as suggested by other members and made these on my George Foreman.  LOVED this recipe!

I'm not a big fan of chicken to begin with. It was definitely good, but not exciting.  I agree with other reviewers that say to marinade this as long as you can.  It is very easy to make. It's a good choice for a potluck because there isn't anything bizarre or unusual for people not to like.

So delicious and really healthy!  Definitely use low sodium soy sauce if you have it.  If you are using wooden skewers, make sure you soak them in water before threading your meat and vegetables so the skewers don't burn.  I use orange bell pepper, red onion, and zucchini with this which taste great.  If you are making more than 2 breasts of chicken, I recommend doubling the marinade.  Don't forget to brush your kebobs during grilling.

Sooooo good! Tip: double the marinade or you won't have enough. Also, buy flour tortillas to put this stuff in, it's awesome! Also ALSO can be used mixed with rice. This is one dish that you can serve three different ways for three nights IF you have enough leftovers. It's sweet, so you need to be into sweet to like this. I didn't think it was too sweet at all, but I like sweet chicken.

Very good.  Definitely double the recipe.  This is also a excellent chicken marinade.  Marinate the wings overnight and bake in single layer at 350 for a half hour on each side.  I pour a bit of the marinade over wings in the baking pan.

These were fantastic and simple to make!  I did double the recipe for the marinade to do the vegetables and chicken separately.  I also took some advice from another and added a little cayenne pepper which gave it a little more flavor.  My daughter who is 5 raved about the chicken and she wanted to take it for leftovers for her first day of Kindergarten!!  lol  We will definitely be using this marinade for grilling chicken in the future.  Thanks Ann for the great recipe.

This recipe is the best skewer recipe I've ever had!  I added mushrooms, pineapple, Spanish onions, and orange bell pepper to the skewers and cooked them over an open fire last night while camping.  The only downfall, I should have made more skewers lol. Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

We absolutely LOVE this marinade!  We use boneless porkchops instead of chicken, and use red, orange and green peppers, marinate it a couple hours, and grill it up.  We grill it loose instead of on the skewers and put it in fajita shells with sour cream, diced tomatoes, salsa,etc and it is just delicious!!

I am in love with this recipe! Definitely double it or at least set some aside for brushing on the chicken when you're grilling it. After 8 hours of marinating this is most wonderful, moist chicken. My husband is more of a steak or pork chop fan but he loves this chicken enough to request it every week.

We loved these kabobs! I minced the garlic and added it to the marinade, and doubled the amount of marinade like a reviewer suggested (thank you!). We added pineapple and mushrooms to the veggies and I also threw in some thawed cooked shrimp. We barely had the 2 hours to marinate it and it was delicious, but next time I'm going to give it a little longer. I like the suggestion of grilling the meat separately from the vegetables..I've done it before and it works well. I marinated the chicken separately from the veggies because I just hate raw chicken touching anything. This is a keeper! I think it would be great on a pork tenderloin, going to give it a try this weekend.

Greatly enjoyed this recipe! Added slightly more honey and slightly less soy sauce to taste. Overall, we were very pleased!

Did it on a GE (like a foreman) grill because I live in an apartment. Turn the heat to medium, or the marinade caramelizes everything. I added pineapples to the marinading mix a few hours before I grilled. Also will cut the onion pieces larger next time--they are hard to skewer. I let everything soak in the marinade for about 22 hours and the chicken was super tender. Also pour extra marinade over cooking skewers when they only have 1-2 mins to go.

The flavor was great and the kids loved it. I doubled the sauce like some of the reviews suggested. I also  broiled them instead of grilled, and it was great. I was asked to add this to our "regular rotation".

I made this a few years ago for a get together...it was the HIT!  I did marinate for 24hrs including the veggies, par-baked them in the oven so I could quickly brown them on the George Forman for each person.  AWESOME!  I highly suggest a try.  Yummy.

Marinated chicken 24 hrs.  Had to return to buy more soy sauce, so vegetables only got a few hours in the marinade. Definitely will make this again, but everything gets 24 hrs in marinade.  Fresh and tasty recipe.

Absolutely wonderful!  I put the chicken in a large zip lock bag and added the marinade.  I let it sit from about 7:30am to 6:00 pm. Then, I grilled them on a skewer.  The chicken was very tender.  Very nice flavor!  My family loved loved it!

Best chicken kabobs ever.  I was somewhat skeptical, but even my grandkids (one 7 years and the other 1 1/2 years) loved them.  Will definitely make these again.

I did not care for this recipe. Mixed up the marinade exactly as the recipe said...the chicken came out almost mushy (just a weird texture) after grilling...we used pineapple and tomatoes instead of the onions and peppers...won't be making again!

great recipe, my kids LOVED it.  had only 20 minutes to marinate, was plenty of time. I did the vegies separate as we have a vegetarian in the family - all worked out quite well. Only comment was the vegies took much longer then chicken, next time, start grilling in shifts.

Made these for a BBQ . They got rave reviews from everybody .  I doubled all the ingredients except chicken which
I I trippled  and like somebody else said I used low sodium soy sauce , and added about 4 tbsp chopped garlic as well as chopped onion. Because when I have a big BBQ I notice people don't eat the veggies I omit them on kabobs.  However I did put a pineapple chunk on the end of each one and used the pineapple juice from the can in the marinade.marinated it all  over night, before skewering them .They were the hit of the party.

I made the marinade for my 6 year old as an alternative to our Peanut Butter Chicken skewers and everyone loved it.  I used local honey which gives it a stronger flavor and then cooked down the left over marinade as a dipping sauce.  Very good!!!

This was SO good. We grilled the chicken and veggies on separate skewers like others said and added just a touch less soy sauce. Other than that, everything was followed exactly how the recipe said except I used less chicken breasts. I used 1.44lbs or chicken breasts which was 2 large breasts. That was just enough sauce for the veggies and the chicken. 8 breasts would need much more sauce.

This was a very delicious meal! I doubled the marinade sauce and then marinated the meat and veggies separately and only for an hour (short on time). The meat was incredibly moist. We added mushrooms to the veggies. Yum!

omg this was a major hit with our family. Not only did I use chicken, but we did steak and shrimp too. I found that letting it marinate 24 hours was perfect.

So yummy!!! Did this tonight and even my four year old said it was good! I only did it with 4 chicken breasts, so if you do the full 8 I would definitely recommend doubling if not tripling the sauce. Next time I'll double the sauce and serve it over rice. So yummy and easy!

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  My husband said it was the best chicken marinade he has ever had. It is light, tasty and delicious.  We use this every time we grill chicken.

I marinated the chicken for 24 hours so it was so dark from the soy sauce that i couldn't tell if it was cooked or not.. I ended up with some very over-cooked and charred chicken. It was still okay but i'm upset that i didn't get to try it cooked properly. Obviously this is my own fault and i can only suggest that others do not make this mistake either. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I love these Kabobs! I could have dipped my veggies in meat in it without marinating them! I will be making this again with rice next time.

So good that when the chicken was gone, my 8 year old offered to dig into her piggy bank to buy more chicken. Lol. Yummy, yummy, tender, and tasty. We served with rice.

The first time we had this, I did as the recipe said and had as a kabob.  It was so good, that I thougth why not just use as a marinade for chicken without the kabob? It's delicious and always gets rave reviews! You will NOT be disappointed with this recipe!

I made this to take on a camping trip. I marinated for about 24 hours and then cooked them on the grill. I fed 9 people and they all raved about how good the chicken was. Next time I would love to try it with some cherry tomatoes or pineapple chunks.

Served these for a Memorial Day bbq and everyone loved them.  I marinated the chicken cubes for about 7 hrs.  My low-sodium mom thought they were a little salty but I liked them just fine.

The marinate is fantastic for Chicken. We sometimes grill the veggies without the marinade. We make a homemade sweet and sour sauce to go with it. It compliments the chicken wonderfully.

The whole family loved this recipe.  My daughter, who normally doesn't eat onions, gobbled up the veggies.  I added a little bit of pineapple juice and pineapple chunks to the marinade about an hour before grilling.  Delicious.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!

These were a HUGE hit today for lunch.  The flavor was great even though we didn't bother with basting them with the reserved marinade while they grilled.

LOVE this marinade! I double the recipe. I also marinade the veggies seperate from the meat. This is great with chicken and portobella mushrooms! I use olive oil, because that's what I have on hand. I don't make any other changes to it, it's perfect.

This was an excellent yet simple marinade!  I marinated the chicken for 4 hours, then when I put the kabobs on the grill, I continually brushed the remaining marinade on them.... my hubby and I enjoyed them.  :)

I made this as is and we didn't like it.  It's not very flavorful.  I could hardly taste the marinade, even after letting it marinade for over 30 hours.  I was really disappointed.

The best chicken marinade period.  I just cooked the chicken, onions and peppers on stove top and it came out amazingly delicious.

I made these for dinner tonight and they were really good.  The only reason I docked a star is because I don't feel like the flavor of the marinade came through as well as I would have hoped.  Next time I make this I will marinate the chicken longer and hopefully the flavor will be a bit stronger.

Wow, these are awesome!  Can't wait to make again next week!  Instead of putting on kabobs, I placed everything on a stirfry screen on my grill and added cherry tomatoes when it was done.   Then I served it all it over white rice.

These were so delicious!! A little more work than just throwing some chicken boobs on the bbq but well worth it!!. I used whatever veggies I had that would go on a skewer.....lets just say that the carrots didn't work as well as I had hoped. They were a tad crunchy but my 11 year old daughter ate them and said they tasted great! Oh and leave mushrooms whole otherwise as they cook they fall off the skewer. I will be making this again.

I added about 1/3 cup white white vinegar and about 1/4-1/3 c plain yogurt.  Then after marinating it I sauteed the chicken and put it on salad.  It got good reviews from friends.

FANTASTIC!!!  We put this together last night and let it sit in the fridge til this evening.  Hubby put everything into foil packets and cooked it on the charcoal grill.  He doesn't like peppers, but couldn't eat enough of em!  Utterly delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful simple recipe.  We'll definitely be making it again!

Made these last year for a summer BBQ and they were a hit.  Flavor wasn't overwhelming and paired well with the chicken and veggies.  Would make this again anytime I needed a simple marinade for chicken.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent, quickie recipe.  I used only about 5 chicken breasts and found the marinade to be about right (leaving it for 24h).  Added pineapples to the skewers for the kids, and used red instead of white onions.  No other modifications were necessary!  Served with coconut rice and veggie side.  Great weeknight dinner.

Tasty!  Not too sweet either.  I added some red pepper flakes but otherwise kept the recipe as is and marinated it for about 10 hours.  Cooked in the broiler.  Served it with sticky rice and some extra sauce I reserved.  Delicious.  Thank you.

Easy and makes for a great-make-ahead meal. I added Asian salad dressing & orange juice to make it a little sweeter. Added more veggies too like, mushrooms abd zucchinis. Overall, I got great compliments.

The flavor didn't stand out to me, but the pieces that it did stick to, were very good.  I suggest marinating overnight.  Will definitely try this again.

Another delicious marinade recipe.  We made this exactly as is, although I believe we forgot to add the garlic at the end.  It was light and tasty and we will absolute use it again.

Simple recipe which can feed a number of people at a party.  I doubled the sauce recipe and added additional honey.  I used 1.5 cups of honey.  I also made the sauce the night before and let it sit out for the night.  I then put the chicken in a ziploc bag with the marinade for 7 hours.  I skewered the chicken (some with chicken, red bell pepper, onion and pineapple others with chicken and pineapple), poured the remaining marinade over the skewers, put the chicken back in the fridge and let it sit for another 5 hours.

We have been making this for years, and it is one of our favorite summer recipes. The vegetables, of course, can be altered to what you have on hand, but the marinade is what makes this recipe so good.

I am going 5 star on this one, it was amazing.  Took advice from other reviewers and doubled the marinade, except I used only 1/3 cup of oil.  Everyone in my family loved this.  I marinaded it for 12 hours and it was perfect.

I was disappointed in this  recipe.  I didn't taste the honey at all and the proportions seemed off.  I had more onion than needed and not enough red pepper.  I also felt that I needed more marinade.  I alternated chicken and veg on the same skewers as the recipe calls for but the picture shows chicken skewers and veg  skewers  which would have helped with the charring.  If I try this again I will have to make some changes.  Most of the 5 star reviewers note the changes they had to make.  Also a reminder to soak wooden skewers would be nice.

Great & so simple to prepare! Yes, double the marinade! I did not marinate for 8 hours, rather 5 to 6. Chicken becomes too soft if it is marinated for too long, the meat fibers break down too much and meat gets a mushy texture to it. This shortening of the time still allows enough time for the chicken to reap the tasty benefits of the marinade flavors. Skewered veggies and chicken separately since they cook at different rates. Chicken was tender and juicy, veggies were crisp tender. I did use both sweet red and green bell peppers for added color. Served this with Parmesan Orzo from AR site, and a crisp fresh salad. Company loved the whole meal! (Reminiscent of teriyaki, which is a Japanese dish where meat/vegetables are soaked in a soy sauce based marinade.) An addition of some fresh pineapple chunks would be wonderful! Or marinating whole chicken breasts before grilling would be great, too!

Tasty and simple! I cooked the chicken and veggies on broil instead of skewering them. It turned out great! I served this chicken with Jasmin rice and broccoli cooked in the Wok with General Tso's sauce.

Amazing marinade!  Whole family loved it and asked when I was making it again! Didn't change a thing in the recipe.  I did put the vegs on one skewer and the chicken on another.  I don't my vegs over cooked.  Chicken was super moist and flavorful.  Will make often during grilling season.

Excellent flavour. I used Tamari sauce because it is gluten free (instead of soy) and we had an onion hater over for dinner, so they were omitted (the onions not the dinner guest!) I left the chicken to marinate for 10hrs, it was amazing. Everyone at the table wanted the recipe. I served it with tzadiki sauce just in case the chicken was a bit dry, but it wasn't...

I used this marinade on boneless, skinless, chicken thighs, and WOW it was terrific. I would recommend doubling the marinade for sure. I grilled sliced squash, eggplant, and peppers, to go with the chicken. Thanks for sharing.

These were outstanding.  I did reduce the soy by about half due to salt issues, but they were still good.  I've never had my grilled chicken come out so tender.  The next day for lunch at work I reheated this in the microwave for just a minute and they were still tender.  Amazing!  Definitely a keeper!

Definitely a keeper.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Had pepper, onion, mushrooms and pineapple on the skewers.

Super yummy! I use garlic and soy sauce for a lot of my cooking, but adding honey brought a whole new dimension. The ratios, sizes, and cooking times of this recipe were right on, too--if you make the chicken chunks any bigger or the veggies any smaller, they won't cook to perfection. I added zucchini chunks to ours, too.

Delicious!  My friends did the taste test and we all agreed it needed a bit of sweet to it so we added a handful of golden raisins to it.  Just the perfect balance of sweet and salty.

Honey Chicken Kabobos have become a "go to" favorite for weekends, parties, etc.  Awesome flavor, super easy to prepare, and they grill so quickly you can have dinner on the table in less than 10 minutes.  I marinate mine for 24 hours, then put on skewers without veggies, and within 7 minutes they're done on the grill.  The only difference in the recipe is I leave out the pepper as we don't care for pepper in our food.  Great as written.

Dang it! Another recipe that has no flavor! So bland. It just tastes like Teriyaki chicken. Like, really. I could've saved time and just opened a bottle of the Teriyaki sauce that I have in the fridge! Will not make again! Could not taste Garlic or Onion!

We made this dish last night and it was great!  I followed other reviewers suggestion and doubled the amount of marinade, which was a good idea.  I had enough marinade to coat the chicken and vegetables (in separate containers), and it was nice to have some extra marinade for basting and drizzling.  I only had two hours to marinade everything, but that turned out to be plenty.  The chicken was super-tender and both the chicken and vegetables were infused with flavor.  We will definitely be making this again!

AMAZING! Marinade for 2 - 3 hours. Separate veggies, chicken, and pineapple so each have own skewer. Low heat for grill; follow top rated review version. Cook chicken alone first, when almost done move to top shelf of grill and add veggies/fruit to lowest level. Use leftover marinade from veggies to baste all during last 6 - 8 minutes of grilling.

This is AMAZING!!!!!  It is a slightly sweet, yet savory marinate that brings out the best flavors in  the chicken.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and was more than pleased.  It remained tender, juicy and full of flavor.  The entire family loved it...our new go-to recipe for grilled chicken.

Tried this with Steak and Pork last night on the grill.  I cut the recipe down since we were cooking for two and there did not seem to be enough sauce to make everything happy, will make more next time, but they did turn out great and will try with chicken and steak next time.

This recipe is excellent.  I marinated for two hours and that was plenty.  I actually forgot to add the garlic cloves to the marinade, but I did not miss them.  The flavor was wonderful!  I added pineapple chunks to the skewers as a I assembled them.  I did not add the pineapple to the marinade because I did not want it to turn brown.  The whole family loved it, AND, because of the flavor of the marinade, I even got my teenage daughter to try bell peppers for the first time--she lliked them.

Made these for dinner , Hubby and Kids really loved them ! I marinated for about 10 hours , in separate ziplock bags. Chicken came out really moist and flavorful - The only thing I did extra was add more veggies- Mushrooms, yellow/green  peppers and pineapple No leftovers . I also tripled the marinade one for each bag and one for use during grilling.

These were wonderful!  They were very tasty and so easy to make.  I used a grill basket instead of skewers and that worked just fine.

Yummy is right! Made it just as is and it was awesome! Not as sweet as you might think, which we thought was a benefit. Goes great with some sauteed veggies or couscous!

just made this tonight and it was delicious! you can definately taste the honey flavor in the marinade. we alterated the chicken with peppers and onions on the skewers to help give the chicken more flavor, not like the way they have it layered in the picture.

This was fantastic! I made one small change, I substituted Honey Wine Vinegar for the honey. It added a a bit of a kick that I think was needed. The Honey Wine Vinegar from Slide Ridge is superior in my opinion. (Disclaimer: I went to school in Cache Valley, so I am predisposed to the honey products from that area.)

These were pretty good.  While we didn't taste the flavors of the marinade too much (I marinated for about 6 hours), the chicken was quite moist and tender and the veggies were juicy.  We had company for dinner, and they were tickled with the presentation.

I really liked this although others who ate it said the texture of the chicken was changed by the honey on the grill. I personally like the change. It made it a little sticky on the outside and softer on the inside. Very Good!

Amazing. I made these for a party and everyone is still raving about them. I made 4 times the amount of marinade for about double the chicken. I also used more variety in my veggies adding mushrooms and zucchini and 2 types of bell peppers. Delicious!

Loved these.  Its completely fool-proof.  I will definitely be trying this meal again.  I made it for a cook-out with friends and had no leftover.  Served with white rice and cucumber salad. Delicious.

This is a very flavorful marinade but I had an issue with mychicken turning to mush.  The only thing I changes was adding about 8 fresh pineapple chucks to the bag with everything else.  I marinated at room temperature for about 30-45 minutes.  The pork I used was great, but the piecs of chicken would smash between your fingers if you tried to pull them off - and you really didn't even need to chew it.  I used chicken tenderloin strips cut into 1 inch pieces and only cooked about 5 minutes total.  I will definately use again on pork though!

This is really good but does need some more red pepper or spice...  (We LOVE spices!)  I added 1 t of crushed red pepper and couldn't taste it all.  I let it marinate overnight even.  I grilled fresh pineapple after the chicken was done.  Good and has lots of potential!

This is good, but I didn't think it was extraordinary.  It does make the chicken super moist, but I thought it lacked in flavor.  I will probably use this again as a basic base marinade, and make a separate sauce for after grilling.

This recipe is fantastic! A few things I did to make it even better is I used 3 bell peppers (red, orange, and green), I had it marinade all day, and I ended up tripling the marinade. This might seem a bit excessive (we had a little bit left over) but in the end we had enough sauce to marinade everything, brush over while cooking, and dip it in when it was done. My whole family loved it, I will definitely do this one again.

This is a yummy marinade.  i usually buy my chicken in bulk and i like to season it then put it away into the freezer for a later date.  i think freezing seasoned chicken makes it taste so much better!!  anyhoo, used this marinade.  only change i made was i used 1 tbs of garlic powder, 2 tbs onion powder and omitted the red peppers cause they don't freeze well.  mixed it all up and placed my chicken into the marinade and into the freezer.  very flavorful, my kids and husband love it.

First time making/grilling kabobs, so was rather nervous- especially since this was one of the main courses at a dinner party.  They turned out awesome and everyone raved over them.  Very moist and tender- marinated veggies and chicken all day before grilling.  Will definitely make these again.  The marinade was perfect!

very good - the longer the marinade sits the better and will also make a good stir fry

My Boyfriend & I loved it!!  I did make 3 times the sauce ingredients for the marinade, and another double to bruch on during grilling.  I did use quite a bit of veggies and also marinaded the chicken and veggies for 1 1/2 day.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you.

Very yummy chicken! It worked great to marinade and grill the chicken separately from the chicken. Everyone chose the veggie kabob that appealed most to them, too.

Made as written.  Marinated chicken pieces over night.  Used chicken, pineapple chunks, red onion and green pepper.  Had a really good flavor.  Served it with Mom's Cucumber Salad from this site.  Very good dinner.  Will have to have a repeat!

Very good!  I don't have garlic cloves, so I left that out, and neither of us are keen on onions, so I left those out as well.  I used both red and yellow bell peppers and halved mushrooms.  I ended up running out of veggies to chicken so I had one kabob with just chicken on it (next time I'll cut more veggies!) and I reduced some of the sauce on the stove for about 10 minutes so that I could have some dipping sauce.  Absolutely delicious!  I marinated for over 24 hours, and it still was a bit mild, so I'm glad I reduced some of the sauce for more flavor.  These are so easy, though--just cube/halve everything, marinate, and skewer.  :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these Chicken Kabobs twice already.  They are wonderful & super easy! Just had my parents over for a last minute dinner get together, and made these kabobs again...they absolutely ranted and raved over them! They wanted the recipe! What's great is you can use any veggies you want on them.  I used red onion, red, green, & yellow peppers & they were the perfect combination! It's a real keeper in my family! Thanks...

My first time making kebobs! Turned out fabulous and amazing! I used cherry tomatoes, green bell pepper, pineapple chunks (from a can), vidalia onion and of course the chicken cubes. I marinated my veggies separate from the chicken. I also doubled the marinade, set some aside to brush on the kebobs while they were on the grill. Some of the chicken stuck to the grill. And even though I soaked my bamboo skewers for a good two hours, they still scorched black and a few caught on fire on the very end of the skewer. Served this dinner with jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth. Delicious summer meal!!!

Pretty yummy! We used one each of red and green bell peppers plus zucchini. We used 4 chicken breasts but still doubled the sauce to be sure we'd have enough. I also added some chili powder and ginger powder to the marinade. They were really tasty! I think marinating them longer will make them even better! We had time enough for 2 hrs.

Great recipe, although I did make a few substitutions and additions.  1) Low sodium soy sauce, I dont want to go into cardiac arrest over kabobs.  2) Added pineapple chunks and juice.  3) Used red and green peppers for visual appeal  4) Added powdered ginger  5) Added crushed red pepper  6) Added cayenne pepper (My family likes spicy & sweet)  7) Grilled veggies separate from chicken and on lower heat

My family really liked this. I put the chicken and veggies in separate bags and split the marinade between the two. Then I used the marinade from the veggies to baste the kabobs during grilling. I think I'll try it with a stir fry as suggested by another reviewer.

The soy sauce in this recipe was very much overpowering. Maybe if soy sauce was cut in half it would be better, probably will not try again.

Had a nice sticky outer coating. I will add a touch more honey next time. The key is to not overcook your chicken.

I made these for a party & they flew off the plates!  Everyone raved, even the kids!  I marinated them the night before so they had a lot of flavor & turned out nice & tender

Excellent!  I did double the recipe and use probably a 1/3 cup more honey then that because my husband loves it. I substitued garlic and onion powder for the real thing and it still came out delicious!

This was good and easy.  Next time I will try marinating overnight for more flavor.  I didn't have any green peppers so I just made mine with chicken, onions, and pineapple chunks.  The chicken was tender and moist.  Tasty but pretty basic.

very good. I think next time i will marinate the chicken overnight for even more flavor. I doubled the sauce, so that i had enough for basting. Next time i think i might even triple the sauce and serve some over the finished kebob, maybe over rice.

We have made this twice now and it is so good grilled like this. I marinate the chicken overnight in the marinade, then make their own chicken kabobs. Then I marinate mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, peppers, squash and zucchini for an hour or two and make their own kabobs. This is very well liked.

Very good flavor on the chicken and veggies. Followed the recipe very closely but added a little ginger and a few shakes of hot pepper flakes.  I marinanted and skewered the veggies and chicken separately.  Nice change of "taste"....will be using again. Thanks for sharing.

Completely delicious.  I grated the garlic rather than leaving it whole for a stronger flavor.  I plan on putting this in to regular rotation.

This was absolutely delicious!!  I only had about 30 min or so to marinate the chicken and it was still awesome - I can only imagine how good it would be if it was marinated longer!  Followed it to a T.  Thanks for a great recipe - my picky husband gave this a 10!!

Mmmm, very, very good.  Marinate overnight so flavor sinks in.  Will want to double sauce in order to have enough.  At least one chicken breast per person as they gobble them up.

These are delicious! I made them for a big cookout I was having and everyone loved them. I marinated chicken, mushrooms, red peppers, green peppers, onion and tomatoes for about 24 hours before cooking them on the grill. I think mine took about 10 min on each side on the grill but my grill was not super hot. The flavor was just great. I agree with whoever said the mushrooms were awesome- I could not stop eating them. Thanks!!

This was excellent!  I only had 30 minutes to marinate the chicken and it was still yummy!  I made an extra batch of the marinade to use with the meal!  Everyone loved it!  Will try marinating it longer next time but it was great with only 30 minutes!

These were super easy to make and delicious!!  My boyfriend really loved them as well and he doesn't typically like chicken breast.  I will be using this recipe a lot this summer!  I did take advice and add pineapple and mushroom to the mix.

I did not like these at all.Maybe it's because I didn't do them on the grill.I followed the rest of the recipe exactly then put them in the oven.Felt like they were missing something.I was going to serve them for a party but I didn't dare.My son liked them though.

This chicken is amazing!  I doubled the sauce and marinated the chicken for about 24 hours and then grilled.  I had to hold back from eating the leftovers but now I get them for lunch.  Will definitely be making this again!!  So good!

I'd give this 10 stars! The marinade is excellent, I use it all the time on chicken breasts and flank steaks. I don't change a thing.

The only change I made was to double the sauce and liberally brushed it on every time I turned the skewer.  Even better warmed up as leftovers the next day.

I doubled the marinate and just cooked the cubed chicken in a skillet. Poured it over rice and it was very good. I will make again. Nice blend of flavors.

Oh, yum.  I chose zucchini and mushrooms for cute and colorful kabobs.  I let the vegetables and chicken marinate for at least two days, turning the bag over in the fridge, whenever I saw it.  If you use raw honey, you might want to add a bit of wine, to keep it from crystallizing in the fridge.  I really love what the marinade did to the chicken, but even more so, what it did to the mushrooms.  Meat was tender, well-colored and delicious.  Definitely a "keeper!"

Very good and easy to make. I cut the amount of chicken and vegetables in half but still doubled the marinade, as others suggested. I also added cherry tomatoes and mushrooms, as others suggested.

Thought it would be a weird combo of ingredients but turned out fantastic.  The sweet from the honey on the chicken was tastey.  A great homemade marinade.

These were the best kabobs I have ever tasted. We marinated them for over 24 hour and they were so flavorful and moist. I sprayed a piece of tin foil with non stick spray and grilled them for about 2-25 minutes. We also added pineapple chunks. The marinade made the pineapple taste delicious. I only made half of the recipe me my husband and I. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

YUM these were SO GOOD and EASY! I marinated them for about 7 hours, they were FANTASTIC! Definitely add pineapple, it was great with the chicken and veggies. I will add tomato chunks next time too. I made my kabobs, but you could just pick some up from the butchers pre-assembled and soak them in a plastic bag or shallow dish, I will probably do that next time to save time. This recipe is a keeper!

This was the bomb!! I would eat it every night if I could. The only thing is, making the kabobs can be very time consuming especially if you're using vegetables. I will start using the marinade to soak whole chicken breasts and grill that way. Yum yum!!

Very easy to prepare, I added pineapple like others suggested.  Also I grilled the chicken and veggies on separate skewers and then mix them and serve them with a side of rice. Made agua de pina (pinapple juice) with the left over pineapple.

These were just okay to me.... I did only the chicken without the veggies, I marinated the chicken overnight. I think I need to start buying low sodium soy sauce because everything I make with soy sauce is soooo salty to me. I made them on the george foreman, I don't know if it's just me but I think that chicken grilled on the foreman has a weird consistency to it. Might try again, thanks!

Absolutely delicious! Easily double the marinade. Also, let it set for at least a few hours, this allows the sauce to penetrate the chicken and veggies and they turn out so juicy and tender! Awesome, thanks!

OMG, this was sooooo good!  I doubled up the sauce as others suggested.  I am glad I did, because it was needed for full flavor and basting during the last few minutes of grilling.  Instead of putting on skewers, I cooked it in one of those grill baskets on a lower setting (so the veggies wouldn't burn).  It came out perfect.  I marinated it for about 3 hours and the chicken came out so tender.  My husband said this was the best recipe yet and I make alot of stir fry's :)  Next time, I am going to try adding some zucchini.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

These were soooo good! I marinated them for about 6 hours and that seemed to be enough time. I marinated the chicken with pineapple slices and on a separate container marinated onions, green peppers, mushrooms and grape tomatoes. I combined the chicken and veggies on the kabobs and they cooked fine together. Our only complaint was that the chicken had a weird creamy coating on it, but we didn't mind it much and that could've come from marinating it together with the pineapple. Making these again tomorrow!

I planned this all appetizer dinner for my husband and he LOVED this.  I just added a little bit more honey and some Crystal hot sauce. I let it marinate for at least 6 hours and later baked it in the oven. He already asked when I will be doing this again!

I made this and didn't have any veggies and than hubby had to work so I didn't  use the grill, I cooked these in the oven. They came out really good. I can only imagine how good it would taste off the grill. Pineapple chunks went GREAT w/ this! I'm definatly trying this again; the right way and with the veggies next time! Thanks..

This was wonderful! The chicken came out so moist and tender, mostly because I marinated it over night. The flavors were very complimentary and gave just the perfect hint of sweetness. I will make this frequently, though it does take a while to prepare. Don't expect this to be a quick last-minute meal as it needs to marinate overnight, and cubing the chicken and then skewering it can take a while. Worth it though! :)

Had this for a family BBQ and it was a big hit. A fun way to do chicken if you're having a variety of grilled meats. We marinaded overnight. I followed the directions exactly but next time I'll add the tomatoes and mushrooms recommended in the description. The tomatoes add a nice sweet touch.

This marinade was to die for. My 6 year old, 4 year old, 1 year old, hubby and myself gobbled up all 12 servings. DELICIOUS!!!! I will FOR SURE be making this one for my family again.

Not bad. I think next time I will cut the garlic in half. Marinated for a few hours. Son didn't like it (not unusual). It sure did make the house smell great!

This marinade was SO easy to make and the kabobs were delicious!  I doubled the recipe like other reviewers suggested and had plenty to marinade the chicken and the veggies.  Plus some left over to brush on while grilling!  I got many compliments and will definitely use this marinade again!

Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe except I didn't have time to marinate very long and it still turned out amazing. My young children loved the chicken. Will be making this a permanent family favorite.

Very good and very easy.  Marinated some eggplant which was great.  Added a few shakes of hot pepper flakes as well.  Doubled the marinate as everyone said.

Very tender and good.  My daughter who is not a big meat eater loved this!  I made it as written but forgot to baste and didn't do any veggies.  I think I will try mushrooms next time.

I made this recipe for a BBQ and it was a hit with everyone!!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe except to double it.  I had 5 chicken breasts cut up and the doubled marinade was perfect.  I also use low sodium soy sauce so it's less salty.  I marinaded over night which greatly increased the flavour and added zucchini.  Thank you Ann Marie for a great bbq kabob recipe!

Great...2 of my guest said best kabobs they had ever eaten.  Used 3 chicken breast 1 green peper and 1/3 vadalia onion.  Made 8 kabobs. Substituted olive oil and added a pinch of salt and kickin chicken seasoning to meat before covering in marinade. Good recipe will make again! Thanks

This is a pretty good recipe.  I used it for a ladies night.  After marinating for a day, my husband put them on the grill.  We were eating them faster than he could grill them.  Not a WOW recipe, but solid one that will remain in rotation.  Good flavors all around.

Did not make kabobs but used chicken breasts instead.  YUMMY.  I doubled the oil, honey & soy sauce and marinated for about 6 hours.  It was absolutely delicious.  Even better the next day on a salad.

I thought this was great! I am not a big fan of chicken, but I know it is healthy so I tried this receipe. Made it as is, and marinated it for 8 hours. My husband  put the kabob's together, adding  mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. It was great! Chicken was tender and flavorful.

This is a wonder recipe! It was the most tender chicken that I have ever had. Alternating the chicken, the red pepper and the onion on the skewer really made the flavors of everything come out really well. I didn't marinate the ingredients for 2 hours but just over an hour and it still turned out fantastic. Great healthy grilling food!

I have to start this review by saying that my husband and children are SICK OF CHICKEN.  I admit, we eat it alot--but in my opinion, it is economical, versatile and healthy!  Having said all of this, I planned our 4th of July BBQ and decided to make these kabobs.  I marinated them for 24 hours. One word for these--EXCELLENT!!!!  My hubby, children and our guests all raved about them and gobbled them up!  I used 8 large chicken breasts, which according to the package came out to be about 6 lbs. of chicken.  I doubled the marinade.  I did not baste them while I was cooking them.  They had a wonderful flavor and a sweet undertone from the honey!  I did add some grated fresh gingerroot.  My husband, the anti-chicken man, said they were GREAT!  I did my veggies on the side in a grill basket.  I marinated them in a separate bowl.  A REAL KEEPER!!!!!  Thanks!

I made this for our 4th of July barbeque, and it was great! I marinated it for a full 24 hours, and the chicken was perfectly tender and juicy. I will definitely cook these again!

Everyone raved over this chicken. I did the same as other reviewers and put my meat and veggies on different skewers. My neice even commented that it tasted like the chicken she gets at the Japanese Steak Houses.

This was delicious! I, like many other reviewers, grilled the chicken and veggies on separate skewers. I also made a fresh batch of the marinade as a sauce and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken a bit. I did reduce the soy sauce content and replaced the remainder with water so the sauce to pour over wouldn't be too salty, but I used the marinade without reducing the soy sauce content. It turned out perfect. I served it over Brazilian White Rice (recipe also on this site) and poured some of the sauce over the kebabs as well for extra flavour. This was so good that I wanted to eat it all on it's own! Everything really absorbed the flavours nicely. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Easy to make! I added garlic and a bit if dry herbs to the mixture. Also, I ran out of honey and substituted it with Maple syrup. Marinated overnight... delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

This is fantastic!  I doubled the marinade and put chicken chunks and shrimp in separate zip lock baggies. The shrimp was very good but the chicken was totally awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!

This has become a staple recipe in our household. I use it on both chicken and beef kabobs. I've made it so many times that it has become a regular request for bbq's!! I always double the marinade and I marinade meat & veggies together overnight or at least 3-4 hours. The longer you let the meat soak up those flavors the better! I prefer to marinade all my meat/veggies together & skewer together. Awesome recipe, thank you!!

I made this last night.  I substituted zucchini and grape tomatoes for the red pepper and I didn't have much time to marinate it but it was still amazing.

This recipe awesome.  I changed it a bit to save on calories, so instead of using 1/4 of vegetable oil I only used a tablespoon of olive oil with three tablespoons of water.  The chicken was very very tasty and we'll definitely be doing this again.

Delicious! I am only rating the marinade. I took chicken out in the morning and had no idea what I was going to do with it as it neared dinner time. I checked my recipes and decided to give this a try even thought I had only 1 1/2 hours to marinate. WOW! What flavor! I forgot the pepper so I only used the oil, soy (I used tamari) and the honey. I really didn't expect much with such few ingredients, but it was really delicious! I wound up grilling the chicken and topping it with bacon and cheddar cheese. I was incredibly moist and full of flavor. We all enoyed it and will be making it again soon.Thanks for the recipe. I am looking forward to an all day marinade.

Yummy! I added in a little ground ginger and sesame oil. Made my kabobs with chicken thighs, zucchini and red, yellow and orange peppers. If you use wood skewers make sure to soak them in water first.

I thought this was awesome - extremely easy and perfect. I marinated it all together for only about 4 hours. The time I put it on the grill was a perfect match for boiling the corn on the cob - great meal!

I marinated the chicken and vegetables in separate containers - well over 8 hours. Very bland. I had to give it 2 stars because the chicken was very tender - just not much flavor.

These kabobs were great! I also ended up doubling the sauce and we used chicken, green pepper and onion. I was shocked when my sauce loving husband decided to eat these without anything. He said they had such great flavor on their own he didn't want to cover it up!

This recipe is awesome and super easy.  I followed it exactly and it turned out great.  The one thing I will say is that I had to remake the marinade 3x to cover all of my chicken and veggies.  That really isn't that big of a deal because of how easy it is to prepare.  I used a few extra chicken breasts for leftovers, but that didn't happen!  Every last piece was enjoyed and raved on.  My friends all wanted the recipe so they could recreate it!  I will definitely be making this more!  I made this with chicken, cherry tomatoes, green peppers, onion, and mushrooms.  Next time I might add pineapples or some other veggies.

Delish!  This is such a simple marinade, I wasn't expecting much, but I was totally surprised with the excellent flavor it gave my chicken.  My husband is from a family of hard core BBQers, and he couldn't stop raving about it.  I added two cloves of crushed garlic to the marinade, otherwise, followed it as written.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I'll use this one all summer!

This marinade was super easy to make. I made for my party Friday night & used zuchini, squash, bell peppers, onions and mushrooms. I marinated everything for about 3 hours and cooked about 20 minutes on the grill. Every piece was eaten up! Thanks for reminding me to soak the skewers, I would have forgot!

These had great flavor but I would seperate the veggies and chicken next time I make it. Then you can take the veggies off sooner or put them on later to save from overcooking.

Very good.  Added some garlic powder to the marinade.  Marinated for about 8hrs.  Next time might add something w/ a little acid (lime juice?), as chicken could have been a little tenderer.

I thought these turned out okay.  I really liked it with pineapples though.

Very good. My husband keeps wanting to make these up!  I kept out the peppers and added pineapple to the kabobs. I also marinated overnight. Yummy!

This was super yummy.  I followed this to a "t" and grilled... both my husband and 3 year old clammered for more.  A keeper for sure!

Oh my goodness!  These were great!  The only thing I did differently was to add minced garlic to the marinade, it was all I had on hand.  My SUPER picky son asked for seconds!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It will be a regular at our house.

Simple and Yummy indeed! I cut up the chicken and then marinade. You can also sprinkle any seasoning after putting on kabobs...we used a carribean seasoning which was perfect with this sauce!

Excellent recipe! I follow other suggestions and doubled the marinade. I only used 4 chicken breasts, but they were HUGE.  Marinated chicken breasts, onions and pinapple (I didn't have a bell pepper) with about 3/4 of the marinade for 2 hours. I also chopped up 3 cloves of garlic and added that to the marinade as well. Make sure that you keep the heat of your grill at about 350-375. As long as you do, the chicken and the veggies cook up nice and evenly at the same time.  You'll have to gauge the cooking time though. Ours took closer to 25 minutes before they were done. I used the last of the marinade for basting the kabobs towards the end, when they were just about done.  This chicken turned out very moist and flavorful. A definite keeper!

Excellent Recipe and easy to make...I used Low Sodium Soy sauce and doubled the sauce recipe...I used on both chicken and steak with an array of veggies. Also marinated meat for 4 hours or so and veggies for maybe 2 hours (2 kids under 3 will not give me the freedom to do all the cutting at one time:-)) Will use this recipe again - thanks for sharing!!

Good marinade. I made these on a cold windy day so I think they were harder to grill, but the marinade had a good flavor and was easy to prepare. If I make again I'll marinade longer (I did about 4 hours) and baste more often (while will be easier when it warms up).

I marinated thinly sliced cutlets instead and served with brown rice cucumber salad and Pinot Grigio.  I saved some marinade and heated it on the stove with a little cornstarch to thicken and served on the side.  Delicious! I was going to use leftovers on a salad the next night but there wasn't any left!

i probably should've marinaded the chicken a bit longer than 1 hour. the taste wasn't really there even with me basting 2-3 times. adding mushrooms and pineapple made them yummy.

Good. Really good. And it doesn't make much of a mess on my grill. Something I'm *always* on the lookout for. ;-) The second time around, I cheated a little using chicken tenderloins wrapped with bacon and broiled. Added some pineapple chunks, too.

Awesome recipe!! I marinated the chicken and veggies separatly overnight. DELICIOUS!! I used mini bell peppers, white onions, and pineapple. I used the oven to broil since I don't have a grill. The sauce mixture would be great for a stir fry dish too! One tip: make extra sauce.

I had two chicken breasts that i needed to use up so i marinaded them and baked them in the oven. i didnt use any veggie or grill them. Maybe this is why the recipe isn't very good. it seemed like a good idea but the flavors just didnt go together well... it was just odd. i dont think this is the best marinade but it might be much better with the smoke from a grill.

This gets two stars because my husband liked it. As for me, not so much. Like another reviewer said it has a burnt soy taste. I will not make this again, unless the hubby begs me to.

My company loved this and so did I. I used it to marinate my chicken breasts (I added some onion powder to it). I only had on hour to marinate it, but it was fabulous.  I cooked it in my Nuwave and it came out wonderful - tender & juicy with a slightly sweet brown glaze. It is now my favorite chicken marinade.

These were sooo good! I let them marinate all day and added some apple cider vinegar and cayenne pepper to the sauce. I think next time I'll put some pineapple chunks on too! I cooked them on the george foreman for about 5 mins and they came out great. Also, I served them with some extra marinade on the side for dipping. My fiance loved them!

Yummy!!! Very good, easy recipe!! I made it once the way shown, then the second time I had a craving for it at 5pm so I just fried the chicken quick and let it simmer in the sauce a few minutes - still yummy!! Thanks!!

Always comes out great. Sometimes I add ginger or a little bit of orange juice for a change, but it's not needed. When it's too cold to go out I bake these on a broiler pan.

This didn't turn out so well for me. I followed the marinade to a T, but decided to make it into a stir fry instead of kabobs. The marinade just tasted like vegetable oil with a hint of honey.

Absolutely Delicious! MOIST. It's very similar to the "Bourbon" Chicken that you would typically get at a Chinese restaurant. I had it with a side of rice and it was great. I used all kinds of peppers and mushrooms for all kind of different flavors. Very much worth the early preparation.

So I let this marinade overnight in the fridge and the oil sorta solidified and the chicken totally soaked up the marinade to the point where it was overwhelmingly flavored.  Had a weird taste.  It was edible but I won't be making it again.

This certainly was not what I expected, especially with all the great reviews. I marinated the chicken and vegetable at least 4 hrs and still no flavor. Bland!

Yummy, indeed!  The kabobs would make a better presentation, but I just made this as a stir fry with onion, zucchini, and mushrooms.  One of the best marinades I've tried.  I marinated for about 16 hours, but the chicken started to break down a bit.  I'll try less next time because the flavor was absolutely great.

This was really yummy. The grilled and marinated pineapple chunks really added alot. I would reccomend marinating overnight or as long as possible as it gives the chuicken a great flavor. Thanks!

I made this exactly as written.  Only difference was that instead of skewering them, I left them in the pan, covered it w/foil and cooked it on the grill.  Came out very good.  We put it over rice and the chicken was very tender.  It was good, but it still was missing something in the flavor department.  I expected a slightly sweeter taste.  Will definitely make again, but may add some brown sugar give it a little more flavor.

This was absolutely the BEST dish I've grilled in my life. The entire family loved it and wanted more than I made. I was lazy and only cut the chicken breast in half lenghtwise and threaded them on the soaked skewer and it cooked just great. I put pineapple on too. Definately a keeper of a recipe!

This tastes amazing!! My husband loved it and he is very picky. I used olive oil for a more healthy route and marinated the veggies and chicken separately. I marinated mine for 4 hours next time I will marinate it longer even though it still tasted wonderfully.

I chose not to do as a kabob. Instead, cut large chicken breasts in half, and marinaded them all day. Grilled until done. Not bad as a sandwich, but also good by itself. This is the one of the best grilling marinades for chicken that I've tried, and I've tried a lot of them. I can see how this would also be great for the vegetables in a kabob, too.

I wanted to make bbq'd chicken breasts and was just looking for a good marinade... not interested in kabobs.  I did however have some chopped veggies that I also marinated in this mixture and  then heated up in a skillet and served over rice.  I used half the oil, and added pineapple juice and tidbits to the marinade.  Was fantastic and my picky husband couldn't get enough of it!  Next time I won't marinate the veggies so long though as they came out too dark, and I won't add the tidbits til cooking time.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!  My whole family loved it!  I did as others suggested and made more sauce, marinated & skewered the veggies and chicken separately.  Also, I used Yoshida's sauce in place of the soy sauce.  I served it with Thai Kitchen Lemongrass & Ginger rice - it was absolutely to die for!

This was good and easy. I used cubed chicken breast, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and sliced onions. I also added chopped fresh garlic to the marinade. The longer you marinade it, the jucier the chicken is.

Great flavor. Only had time to marinate 2 hours, wished I had longer because the flavor was so yummy! I marinated the veggies and chicken separately and threaded everything on their own skewer. Thank you for the recipe, we will definitely be making again!

Amazingly delicious!!!  I made these for dinner last night, I used zucchini, yellow squash, red and green bell peppers and 3 chicken breast for 2 of us.  Per the suggestion of other reviewers I also doubled the sauce and had just enough.  I marinated the chicken and the vegetables separately for a little over 3 hours.  I wish that I had more time to marinate them longer, next time I'll marinate everything for around 5-6 hours.  However, even with just 3 hours they were GREAT!!!  This will be a staple in our house for sure!

Very tasty - I used mushrooms, pineapple, red pepper and onions for the veggies and marinated in separate bags.  You definately need to double the sauce recipe - not nearly enough if you don't.

This was delicious! I only had 1/2 to marinade the chicken, but it was still super yummy. I used zucchini, mushrooms, red bell peppers and red onions. Next time I would put the veggies on separate skewers though, the mushrooms especially were a little over done by the time the chicken was done. I will definitely be making this one again!

I tripled this receipe and added ground ginger.  We made about 7 kabobs with chicken, green pepper, onion, tomatoes and mushrooms.  I marinated the chicken and veggies, seperate, overnight.  Very yummy.

Made these last weekend and everyone enjoyed them. I added some chili sauce to the marinade because I add chili to almost everything. I don't usually care for chicken breast grilled because it can become dry, but these kabobs were very moist and flavorful. I will definitely continue to make these.

I made this yet again tonight and I can't believe I've never reviewed this recipe!  It is one of me and my husband all time favorites.  The only thing I do differently when I make the kabobs is double the marinade and double the red peppers.  However, we don't have our grill anymore and I still wanted to make them.  So I marinated the chicken and veggies all day then I cut up the chicken and put it in a skillet and cooked it.  I did the same with the veggies, in a separate skillet.  When everything was done, I put the chicken and veggies on flour tortillas, sprinkled with a little cheddar cheese, and we at them like fajitas!  And it turned out PHENOMINAL.  Honestly I think even better than the kabobs alone!  It would have been great with sour cream too.  So to anyone who doesn't have a grill or just wants to try this, I highly recommend it!

These were delicious. I doubled the marinade as recommended by others and let the chicken marinade overnight. The veggies marinated for about  hours (we used onions, mushrooms and green,yellow & red peppers). It took about 15-20 minutes to cook on low-med heat.

I made this for my forth of July cookout and it was a hit!  The marinade was so delicious and I will definitely make it again.  I used everything but the peppers.  On my kabobs I had the chicken, mushrooms, squash, zucchini and pineapple.  It turned out to be the perfect combination....especially with the pineapple. Thanks!!

These were very very good. However i found them a bit too sweet at times. I also added a bit of hot sauce to cut the sweetness. Furthermore i used Not just red peppers, but also green and yellow peppers, zucchini, pineapple (which aids in tenderizing as well). After 7 hours of marinating, it was too long. Next time i will do them for 5 hours. They also work well placed with the kabob in a pan and consistently basted with remaining sauce-very good to caramelize the sauce for a more intense flavor :)

Excellent recipe! We only used 3 chicken breasts and the marinade as indicated in the recipe. It was perfect. Even a picky hubby loved it. We used zucchini and onions with the chicken and make fried rice. We would highly recommend it!

This was wonderful!!! I also doubled the sauce and let the chicken marinade for about 4 hours. I left some sauce out for basting and it was delicious! We recently moved to Japan so we don't have a grill yet. We cooked some on our Foreman and some in the broiler. The broiler worked the best for us. I have also made this on the stove, with no scewers and it was wonderful that way too! Will definitely keep making this!!!

Great marinade recipe - just watch the heat of your grill if you don't like blackened bits on your meat and vegetable.  At my daughter's request, I'm trying it this week on whole boneless breasts.

I made these for my daughters b-day for a Luau. I marinated my chicken overnight and it tasted like "cheese chicken" as my nine year old said! It was really soft, not like cooked chicken should be. IDK, any ideas?

These were very good.  My husband isn't a huge fan of honey, so I only marinated for 30-45 minutes, and it turned out well.  They make great lunch leftovers!

I had fathers day at my house this year and wanted something other than the usual hamburgers.  They loved this marinade.  I forgot the garlic cloves, but was wonderful without them.  I let it marinade for about 7 hrs, next time I will let it sit over night.  I will be making this again soon.

These were yum-azing.  I think doing the skewers is definitely worth the extra time as opposed to just doing whole chicken breasts.  The chicken actually tasted similar to a bourbon chicken recipe that I had years ago, and I've been looking for a recipe ever since.  Who knew there was no bourbon needed.  These are REALLY good.  I would recommend marinating them for a long time, 12 hours or more for best flavor.  I also marinated some zucchini in a separate bag for a couple of hours, and they were great also.  Make extra marinade for basting for sure.

Everyone loved these!! I was too lazy to skewer so I put the chicken in one pan and all the vegies in another and cooked that way. Worked out fine. I used tri-color bell peppers and lots of onion. Will add to my recipe box. Thank you for the recipe.

This was an excellent recipe which leaves a lot of room for variation.  I used green peppers, red onion, grape tomatoes, and pineapple chunks as well as cubes of chicken.  I allowed all of the ingredients to marinate for about 4 hours.  I don't have a grill (I live in an apartment) so I baked them in the oven for about 20 minutes on 400 degrees.  I served them with the Onion Rice recipe also from this site.  Excellent!!!

This recipe is incredible!  I can not believe how easy it was and how good.  I did not have 2 hrs to marinate, only about 20 minutes and it tasted like it had sat in the marinade all day.  Next time I will add pineapple to the vegitables.  Thanks!!!!

I cut the chicken into 3 to 4" pieces, Marinated only 6 hours. used no skewers cooked on the BBQ. Had a nice mild taste and very tender. The next day it was great. still very tender served cold. Will marinated longer next time, and see if it gets even better.
Update: marinating longer makes the chicken dense in structure, but still tender. I think 6 hours is more then enough, chicken pulls apart easier.

Excellent. My husband I both loved it, and I completely ignored all the other dishes on the table. You can definitely switch up the vegetables. We used onion, mushrooms, red and green pepper, and zucchini.

Pretty good! We would have these again. We made these on the George Foreman, since we don't have a real grill, and used zucchini  instead of onions and peppers. Very simple recipe, easy to follow.

These got rave reviews from my family!  I used a George Foreman-type indoor grill with only one heat setting, and the chicken and veggies cooked perfectly together on a skewer.  I added grape tomatoes and fresh pineapple to the skewers, but I didn't marinate them with the other ingredients.  The pineapple was a hit but the tomatoes got pretty mushy, although some of us still liked them.  I also doubled the marinade to be sure that I had enough, and it was plenty.  I reserved some of it for brushing over the kabobs during grilling, but I couldn't find a brush, so I skipped that part.  My only complaint is that threading all the ingredients on the skewers was a bit of a pain, but that's to be expected when making kabobs.  I'll definitely use this marinade recipe again.

FABULOUS!  Took some recommendations: added a dash of rice vinegar to the marinade.  Added pineapple to the skewer.  Marinaded the chicken with the onion only for a few hours.  Delish.  Will make again and marinade for longer.  Served it with wild rice.

I made this marinade for vegetables that I cooked over a fire when camping.  It was very good, though subtle.  I might try a little more honey next time, because I think the hint of sweet on fire grilled vegetables is absolutely wonderful.

The best kabobs I've ever had.  The marinade is AWESOME!

I put the vegs and meat in marinade on Friday evening with the antipation of grilling Saturday afternoon.  Due to rain we weren't able to grill until Sunday night.  The meat was not tough at ALL and the vegs were still crunchy.

I guess I was expecting more from this recipe from the reviews I read. It was good, but nothing spectacular. The chicken was very moist with a nice sweetness, but I could have gone for more sauce. I did double the marinade and I used the broiler.

Made them tonight for the first time, marinated for only 3 hours and gotta say they tasted great. Chicken was moist and flavor was not overpowering (good thing as there is a picky 6 yr old at my table) Veggies were awesome.

I'm one of those people who hardly cook. It's just out of pure laziness really... but one day my brother made a bet that I couldn't cook anything that tasted good - so I went on this website and found this yummy recipe (afterall it has the word "yummy" in it)... well it was a major HIT!!! Everyone loved the kabobs and it was gone within minutes!!!! My mother loved it so much that she asked for the recipe and made them herself... She added pineapples to the kabobs and they tasted fab!!!! Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and let marinate overnight until the next evening.  Wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped it would be.  The only thing I did not do was baste it while grilling it but just assumed since I had marinated it for an extra long time that the flavor would soak in.  Prob wouldn't use this again.

MMMMMMMMMMM!!!! Can't wait for lunch tomorrow.  I marinaded the chicken and veggies in separate ziploc bags for about 3 hours. This recipe is so delicious. Don't change a thing. Next time, I'm going to try putting some pineapple with the veggies.

great recipe and marinade. i let the chicken chunks sit for 24 hours in the marinade. i didnt have garlic (doh!) so i used garlic powder instead, and it was great. also threw a little chicken seasoning on them before grilling just for fun. i basted them the entire time on the grill and they turnde out great. the sauce carmelized beautifully. will def make again! thanks!

I have used this recipe as a base for my favorite marinade.  I make chicken breasts alone in this yummy sauce.  Simple and truly flavorful.  THE best combo of flavors!!!

This recipe was great! I made it for my very picky boyfriend & his father and they both loved it! Should have let it sit longer than I did (about an hour and a half). It was excellent though, I will definitely be making this again.

Could't believe how delicous these came out!  I forgot to use the marinade on the chicken during cooking on the grill, and still tasted great!  By request, I'm making them again tomorrow. :)  Definitely a keeper!  Also, on the skewers I added pineapple chunks, mushroom slices, and carrots.  Uber yummy!

This recipe was great. I totally forgot to add in the garlic (which I *love*), but it was still really good. I will continue to make this and make sure I add the garlic. The veggies I used were zucchini, onions, and red bell peppers. Yummy! NOTE: I agree with others thatyou need to double the recipe for the sauce.

This was really good. I made just as is! MMMM yum. The marinade/glaze was delicious! My husband even liked it, and he didnt even want to try it because i made with bells and onions and he's a picky man, but he ate those more than the bacon/pineapple ones I made too! This was sooo good, will be making a lot during the summer!

I love this recipe.  I triple it though because I marinate the chicken in one bag and all the veggies in another.  Then I have an extra batch for basting.  I add pineapple as others do, and add some of the juice to the marinade as well.

Delicious! 4-stars b/c: I had to triple the marinade just to halfway cover the kabobs. I skewered veggies and chicken together and marinated overnight (turning about 3-times total). The flavor is not too salty or sweet, a great balance. My guest raved and ate every last bite! Served w/ roasted chicken wild rice and string beans

I Had to add about a cup and a half of Italian dressing. There was NO way this recipe was enough to even cover the kabobs to marinade. I added about a cup and a half of italian dressing. you would have to triple this recipe to get as much marinade as I like to use. With the Italian dressing - absolutely AWESOME.

I made these with double the marinade and only red and green peppers. I added pineapple juice near the end of marinating. They turned out excellent! I only marinated them for about six hours and they were still really tender and flavorful. Adding pineapple juice to the marinade made it sweeter, which we really liked. I had guests over and this recipe was a big hit!

These were very delicious. Moist, tender and very flavorful. Next time, I think I'll double more of the honey. I got more of a soy sauce kick then a honey one. Either that or I will simply baste with honey alone! Great recipe!

I made this for a Christmas Eve potluck and it got rave reviews from the other people at the party.  It was very easy and used ingredients that I already had on-hand. Although I think this earned 5 stars, the flavor was not as strong as I personally would have liked.  I marinated the chicken, red bell pepper, and onion for about 8 hours prior to cooking; next time I'll marinate for at least 24 hours to get a stronger flavor. I broiled these kabobs in the oven. I soaked bamboo skewers for half an hour, then threaded the items onto the skewers and broiled them for about 6-7 minutes, then turned the kabobs, basted with the reserved marinade, and broiled another 5-7 minutes (your time may be different if your broiler is hotter/cooler.)

I only give 4 stars because although these were easy and tasted great- they turned out a bit dry.  Perhaps they cooked too long?  Not sure.  Anyways, I made these by cutting up my chicken breasts and freezing them in the marinade- that way they could marinate all day while they defrosted.  I did not do the veggie kabobs- just the chicken.  Turned out with a great flavor, just a little too dry for me, like I said.  Otherwise a fantastic, super easy recipe and I intend to keep it in rotation!  Thanks!

My family loved this. I doubled the marinade recipe and added about 1/8 c. (maybe a little more) of pineapple juice to thin it out since I unknowingly omitted half the oil. It still turned out wonderful. The skewers make it fun for kids as well! Quick and easy meal that will be a staple in this house!

So far, it looks good, i just marinated the chicken. but the marinade just was to sweet so i added a cap full of vinegar and it leveled it down.

What is there not to love? I've made this recipe a handful of times, always to rave reviews. The combo of different colored peppers, onion, and honey glazed chicken makes these bobs look as good as they taste!

I skip the kabobs and cook it on my stove top grill with onions just like the recipe. I normally don't marinate it the full time, sometimes only twenty minutes, but it's still great! Thanks!

I love this recipe!  I think it is best if marinaded overnight.  I also suggest to skewer with canned pineapple.  I used the juices to help for basting.  Delicious!

I thought this sounded delicious, and I wasn't disappointed.  I made this last night and let the chicken and veggies (onions and red peppers) soak for almost 3 hours.  The taste was fabulous!  My only complaint is that I'd like MORE of the sauce!  I think next time, I'd like to try and thicken the marinade.  Perhaps use olive oil instead of the vegetable oil.  Absolutely wonderful recipe.

I made these for a barbeque and they were wonderful.  I marinated the chicken with small whole mushrooms and pieces of sweet onion for about 6 hours.  When it came time to grill them, we realized we didn't have any propane for the grill, so I ended up baking them on a cookie sheet with grill racks.  No one seemed to mind that they weren't actually grilled - there were no leftovers.  Served with a cold spicy sesame noodle dish.

OMG, you MUST try this fabulous recipe! I was a bit worried about the soy sauce, since I'm not a big fan, however, combined with the honey...tasty,tasty,tasty.  Refuse to make kabobs any other way.  My guest raved about the taste and the tenderness of the chicken.  Marinaded for 7 hours, basted (a must) while they were on the grill. UPDATE-I've used this marinade on salmon and beef...simply devine!!!!

Excellent! My husband and bro-in-law loved it. And it was my first time making kabobs so that says something. I doubled the recipe and added zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms, red and green bell peppers to the mix. Marinated the chicken for about 7 hours and veggies for 5. It came out perfect! Leftovers the next day tasted good too. Definite keeper.

I loved the taste, but a little too sweet for me.  I added additional vegies and a little bit of pineapple juice. Who knows, it might have turned out better just as written. It's not certainly fair to rate a recipe if you don't follow it, but in this case the sweetness (before my pineapple juice) allowed for a tiny fault in my rating.

This recipe had such great flavor.  I was actually looking for a shrimp kabob recipe, but decided to use this one anyway.  It was AMAZING with shrimp, but I still need to try it with chicken to see which I like best.  I used green bell peppers, vidalia onions and pineapple as well and it was all fantastic!

This was delicious.  I didn't make kabobs.  I marinated all, grilled the chicken, then stir-fried the veggies.  It was still a hit.

Love this recipe!  We use different veggies though.  Our favorite is with mushrooms, purple onions and pineapple.  Yummy!  Make sure to marinate the chicken for as long as possible though.  I will usually make it first thing in the morning and let it marinate all day.  Tastes MUCH better (tried the two hours, and it was just okay).

I love this recipe.  I marinate my chicken in a separate bag from the veggies and then skewer them up. I've made this for MANY people and everyone has loved it.  I'm going to go try it with full breasts for dinner tonight!  :)

We marinated the chicken & also the other stuff overnight, that helped a lot with the flavor. We added small potatoes on the kabobs, (fresh but next time will used canned because it took a LONG time to cook the potatoes), the flavor of them was especially great though because of the marinade! It was a pretty good recipe & will probably be used again.

This is a very good recipe.  The chicken is moist and flavorful and the veggies are really good with the marinade-I would have never thought to put the veggies in marinade-but it gives them great flavor!  I added mushrooms and they were really good on the grill!  I would give 5 stars but I don't think this recipe was quite as good as my last 5 star recipe from this site-Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs-but it was a really close second!  Very good recipe!

Sorry, I don't know why this has been rated so highly. It could have just been that no one in my family really enjoys a teriaki-flavored meat. It was just okay for us.

The reviews were right - fabulous.  I marinated the veggies and chicken seperately over night and also took the advice of previous reviewers and made seperate skewers of chicken/veggies.  LOVED it and so did my kids!

These were so good! We made these on the grill and the honey makes the chicken nice and sweet. I added some pineapple chunks to the skewers, which I thought went well with the sweetness of the honey. I only had time to marinate for about an hour and the flavor was great.

OH MY GOSH! I don't think my taste buds could have dreamed up a more delicious meal. This was outstanding. I prepared this for a close friend at his birthday party and every one loved it. I did take the suggestion to cook the meat and veggies on different sticks       but they ended up cooking at the same speed because the meat was semi cooked already due to defrosting. I marinaded the meat only for 2 hours.

This is a really easy and delicious recipe!  I love the sweetness of the honey and soy sauce mixture on the chicken!  One time I only got to marinate my chicken for about 30 mins and the other time 2 hrs.  Both came out wonderful!  My five year old even liked the taste.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I only had 30 minutes to marinade the already skewered chicken kabobs I bought at the store.  I put them in a ziplock and added the marinade I prepared exactly according to the recipe.  I kept them out of the fridge to max the flavor since it was so short a time.  Everyone this: teens, preteen picky eater, parents.  Thanks, will use it again soon!

This is the first recipe I've rated at 5 stars on this site. The kabobs were SO good that my husband and I had to fight over the leftovers the next day! My whole family enjoyed.  We added mushrooms and cherry tomatoes (grilled and fresh) to our kabobs and they made it even tastier. Thanks, Ann Marie!

This was OUTSTANDING!  I made it for Father's Day dinner and it was incredible!  I let it marinate overnight.  I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts just because I got them much cheaper and they still worked perfectly fine.  I did as some others suggested and put the chicken on their own skewers and the veggies on another.  All was outstanding!  My company loved it, my kids couldnt get enough!  With it, I also made (from this site):  Savory garlic steak, marinated shrimp, alyson's broccoli salad and a strawberry and spinach salad.  I was told that it was better than a restaurant and by far the best meal I've EVER cooked.  Oh, and the chicken and veggies barely made it to the table..  We tried it fresh off the grill and everyone was picking at it before we ever got it in the house!

A very good recipe, made even better with the addition of 1/3 cup of bourbon to the marinade. I cut the chicken into kabob sized pieces, and marinated it for 2 hours. With the chicken pieces, I skewered cut-up red onion, mushrooms, red pepper and lemon pieces (which when cooked are delicious sprinkled over the rest of the kabobs). Yummy!

Awesome! Easy to make, taste great and made the house smell great. Even the dogs were drooling. I will marinate longer next time. Flavor was mild but still great.

Great Kabobs!!! I made 2 batches of marinade and did the veggies and chicken seperate..  I used the already crushed garlic and added a a BIG scoop.. I think this might add a little more flavor for those that thought it needed it.I however didn't think it lacked any flavor, just LOVE garlic. I used yellow squash, zucch, onions,red&green peppers and mushrooms..all these veggies tasted so good..The chicken was moist and very tasty!! This is a keeper.. everyone loves this recipe...

Very good, the sauce was excellent.  I added fresh pineapple to the kebabs, and I ended up pan-frying the chicken in the marinade before I put it on the skewers.  The result made my face happy.  Gooo Pineapple!  Seriously.

This was amazing! I used chicken thighs and ended up marinating them for 2 days. I grilled them w/ thick slices of onions and red peppers basting at the end and served over rice. Such great flavor!!! I will absolutely make this again!

These were okay to be honest in my opinion but that could be just my taste, I really like plenty of flavour and although yes the meat was tender as it is always from marinating, the flavour was just too mild and yes I could have added extra seasoning and listed those additions but that would be taking me away from the purpose of the recipe.  One member of my family one of the 5yr old twins did say he liked them (honey lover). So please try for yourself plenty of others have raved about this one, just not me.

Very good.  We used the broiler and it was delicious.  I marinated for about four hours and it was perfect.  We don't like onions so I just put the onions in the marinade for the flavor and then discarded all of them after.  Very easy dinner.

I used this for chicken breasts on the grill. The taste was good--no doubt it would be great on kabobs. I give it a 4 but hubby gives it a 3. Served with rice and green beans and was a fine meal and especially easy to prepare.

Good, and easy to make - but it was hands down the runner-up to a different chicken marinade at my BBQ.  People still liked it though, especially that the chicken remained moist and not dried out.

Made these yesterday, they were very good.  I used zucchini, mushrooms, green peppers and vidalia onions.  I also crushed the garlic in an attempt to give a little more kick.  i might increase the soy sauce a little next time, but will make again.  thanks!

These are good, bur definitely not worth the raves. I followed the recipe to a "t" and they did come out tender and with a modicum of flavor, but I've definitely had better. On the plus side though, the kids ate them, and I have a picky five year old and a picky two year old who literally refuses to eat most of the time. So overall, not a bad recipe for the family... a little flavor and not spicy for the kids...

We loved these. I did not add the veges-only the chicken, which was marinaded for a day. I took it to a potluck and it was the first thing eaten up. I think the veges might detract. (That is just my opinion.)They were not dry at all. Maybe those who found it dry overcooked it a bit?

Very good recipe!  I doubled the marinade and used half for the chicken and the other half to marinate the vegetables.   We used onions, red bell peppers and mushrooms for the kabobs and then grilled squash and egglplant with a little of the marinade to baste all of it.  It was a really yummy, healthy dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great! We put the chicken, red peppers and onions each on their own skewers which helps everything cook more evenly. The little bit of grill-char was great flavor with the marinade/glaze!

We love this recipe. If it's too cold/rainy for grilling, then I broil it in the oven.  I've made this numerous times and I always get positive reviews.

Definitely a 5 star!! And so easy to make.  I found that I had to finish the cooking process under the broiler to ensure that the chicken was thorougly cooked.  I marinated that chicken and veggies for 24 hours and the flavour was fantastic; a definite hit at our house!!  Will also make again with chicken breasts.

We love the marinade and now make this recipe all the time.  We like it marinated best for about 2 hours, and will often just marinate chicken and grill it by itself.  Great for a dinner of chicken, rice, and veggies!

Although I decided against paying 3.00 for 2 red peppers, I think I'll splurge next time and buy them, because of the flavor they add and because of the way they look in Sunflower's beautiful picture. I used 4 chicken breasts, and using one of LadyJayPee's suggestions, marinated the onion & garlic separately from the chicken, and I marinated everything overnight. First words out of my husband's mouth after the first bite: this chicken is great! He grilled them just right, getting those little blackened edges where the marinade carmelized, and it was so tender it melted in our mouths. Nice touch of sweetness in every bite. Great recipe Ann Marie!

Awesome!! We took this camping. Prepared everything at home and put in ziplock bags. Cooked over fire. EASY! Used mushrooms, onions, and zucchini for veggies. Best mushrooms I've ever had.

This is SO good!  I doubled the recipe and reduced the amount of soy sauce slightly.  I marinated for just over four hours and alternated the chicken with just the onions (I'm not a pepper person).  It wasn't too sweet or too salty and the whole family loved it.  This is my new favorite recipe.

This was a very good recipe.  I also tried it substituting barbeque sauce for the soy sauce and skewered sweet potatos, peppers, carrots, and chicken and it turned out excellent as well.

I love  this recipe!!  I've never actually made the kabobs, but like others have mentioned, I use it to marinade chicken breasts (5-6 hrs) and then throw them on the grill .  My guests always rave over them!  For a switch, I've even sliced up a pork loin, marinated and then grilled, and again, wonderful results.

Instead of making Kabobs I just used the marinade for chicken breasts and served with rice and fresh salad.  My bf loved the flavor and I will definitely use the marinade again.

Better than I expected!!!  I'll admit that I was totally surprised of how great tasting the chicken kabobs were with such basic ingredients.

However...the flavor was slightly lacking.  I'm sure it was because I wasn't brushing the left over marinade while cooking. Other than that, I received many compliments from friends.

Loved this recipe- only marinated for 30 minutes, but it was yummy. It's a mild version of teriyaki sauce and was much welcomed by my family.  I skewered onion and pineapple- everything caramelized very well while on the grill. I added a bit of sesame oil and hot sauce.

Mmmmm Mmmmmm.  We had this for dinner yesterday and got rave reveiws from our guests.  I added green and red peppers, onion and mushrooms to the marinade.  The flavours went so well for both the chicken and veggies.  A little tip, place a strip of foil under the exposed ends of the wooden skewers to keep them from burning.

You need to reserve more than 'a little' of the marinade to brush on bbqing meat... there is not enough flavor to this (and I even added hot pepper flakes!).  Not as exciting as I expected.

I made this for a Luau and everyone loved it. I also used the same recipe for beef kabobs and it came out just as great. I noticed that if I marinated over night the flavor was even better. This recipe will become a part of my frequent BBQ's that I have.

This was delicious, served with carrots and peas. I marinated the vegetables and chicken separately for 8 hours, stirring twice in the middle. Loved by all and very moist!

WOW!!  This recipe was one of the best yet.  The whole family loved it, especially my husband.  I couldn't stop thinking about it after I made it.  It kinda tasted like terriyaki chicken from the chinese food place, but much better.  Not greasy, like at the chinese food place.  Very moist and tender.  Just absolutely scrumptious.  I will definitely be making this again.  Definitely a thumbs up!

I used the marinade sauce for grilling chicken breasts over a gas grill.  They turned out wonderful.  I wish there was a dipping sauce that went a long with the marinade.

I made these as chicken cutlets rather than kabobs but after marinating overnight, they were quite good and tasty.

Yum! I didnt marinate (as the kabobs were spur of the moment) but i put the chicken chunks in it as i cut the veggies. I used garlic power and olive oil instead. Oh and added some summer squash to the kabob.

Yummy honey chicken is right.  I love the marinade and the grill really brings out the flavors.  We used mushrooms, red peppers, onoins, and cherry tomatoes in our kabobs. The mushrooms were the best, I don't suggest putting tomatoes on the kabobs, ours came out mushy and blah. Great recipe.

Truly the best chicken kabobs I have ever eaten.  I would lower my rating by one star, because you should NEVER marinate raw meat with vegetables you plan to eat.  However, I give it five stars because for flavor, it deserves six!!  Use onions and garlic in the chicken marinade if you can, but if you don't have around, the marinade will still be nice.  Truly a no-fail crowd pleaser!  Kid approved, too.

I made this recipe when we had kids visiting, and the kids and adults both enjoyed these!  I marinated the chicken and vegetables separately, so I doubled the marinade.  I used chicken tenderloins and threaded them onto metal skewers instead of cubing the chicken.  We didn't baste with the marinade, but next time I will for extra flavor.  Great recipe!

This recipe was so good that my family wanted it for dinner twice in one week! 
We didn't marinate the vegetables and each time we used different vegetables such as Zuchinni and mushrooms.
This is a great BBQ party dish-alittle bit for everyone! Thanks Ann Marie!

The name "Yummy" says it all! I made these along with other kabob recipes from this site (Pineapple Chicken Tenders, Asian Beef Skewers, Mushroom Kabobs) for a big potluck this summer. They were definitely a crowd pleaser. Thanks!

So so so good!  The honey flavor that the chicken and vegetables picks up is so good!  The longer you marinate it the better.  Super easy and super quick.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.

Delicious.
Loved the fact that it was so easy. I left out the black pepper and didn't bother basting the chicken... also, I marinated grape tomatoes, mushrooms & green pepper in the sauce.  Very good.

Pretty good marinade. It was nasty weather here yesterday so instead of kabobs on the grill I marinaded all day, then browned the boneless breasts in a skillet, then simmered them in the sauce until tender. I loved the sauce, my family liked my usual teriyaki sauce better. Thanks Anne Marie
