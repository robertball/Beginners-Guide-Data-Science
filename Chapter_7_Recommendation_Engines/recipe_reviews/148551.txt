Delicious! But I thawed the limeaide & used grapefruit juice from my big plastic container of already cut grapefruit. Mixed in a pitcher and refrigerated. Then rimmed glasses w/ cocktail sugar & poured over ice. Perfect!

This has become a regular at my house. Will be my New Years's drink. I don't even like grapefruit. I would guess if you do like grapefruit you will really like this a lot! Try it.

I just recently started liking grapefruit and have always loved margaritas so when I came across this recipe I just had to try it. It was awesome. I will make pitcher after pitcher of these. Thank you!

This is a lot like my recipe for beer margarita except replacing grapefruit juice for the beer.  I liked these better, but I LOVE grapefruit juice!!!  I used 100% juice which is a little tart for most people, but I thought the ingredients were perfect together.  I will most definitely make these again!!!

I just mixed my first batch of these for a get together I'm having tonight. I decided to give it a taste to make sure it wasn't too tart for everyone and let me tell you, I've had a lot of margaritas in my time and these are my all time favorite. I just sent someone for more tequila because I know everyone will be skipping the wine and trying this. I made them on the rocks because I'm incredibly lazy and they're absolutely fantastic!

Graet recipe! You can't taste the booze but it is there! I used a can of frozen lime, lemon, orange mix (no limeade at the store and mama wanted a cocktail NOW!) so I added a splash of lime juice to compensate.  I rimmed my glass with a lime and then sugar. Thanks for the dangerous concoction ;) I'll be making these all summer long!

We made a recipe with fresh lime juice and when we wanted seconds we didn't want to go through the trouble of juicing additional limes. We found this recipe and loved it! Very tasty with a sugar and salt rim.

I used fresh pink grape fruit juice, so I had to sweeten it.  Very nice and refreshing!  I'm sure with the pre-packaged ruby red juice it wouldn't have required sweetener....but fresh squeezed (freshly squeezed?)  just tastes SO much better!

This was delicious! So glad I chose this recipe. My husband, who doesn't like grapefruit juice, enjoyed this drink and asked for seconds. For my large glass pitcher, I doubled the recipe, except for the tequila. I used just one cup of tequila and everyone felt like it was sufficiently strong to make it a nice drink that you could have seconds of without being three-sheets-to-the-wind. I can't imagine using the amount it calls for for just one batch. I highly recommend this!

I made this for Memorial Day and everyone loved it.  I did substitute tonic water for the tequila to make it non-alcoholic.  I keep all other ingredients the same.  We will be making these again!
