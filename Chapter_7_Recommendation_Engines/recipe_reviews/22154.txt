Very good basic recipe-have to add spices accding to your tastes..2nd time making recipe, I added a can of Cream of Chicken soup at the beginning, and also diced onions. Spices used: Old Bay, Garlic salt, reg. salt, garlic powder, white pepper, dill weed, 2 bay leaves, Cavender's seasoning. Very very good with 'real' bacon bits & shredded cheddar added too. Top w/sour cream & more cheese if you want!

I like potato soup but I really didn't care for this one. It was easy to prepare, thinkened up real nice but it just didn't have any flavor. Salt and pepper helped a bit, but it needs something more in my opinion. If you like plain tasting soup this will work for you if you don't keep looking.

This soup was good.  When I printed the recipe it called for eight pounds of potatoes so I made much more than called for.  I think it should have read eight cups?

I opted for vegetable bouillon instead of chicken and olive oil instead of butter. Salt and pepper and garlic to taste. The soup was wonderful and hearty. It was almost a garlic baked potato soup and delicious!

Simple and good recipe.  My pickiest child loved it.  I will use this recipe again.  Also, I did use 8 cups instead of 8lbs potato.  I also added some velveeta to it about a half hour before serving.

I added a few dashes of Mrs. Dash's Onion and Herb Powder when preparing the soup and a few more dashes about an hour b4 i served the soup.  I put bacon bits, scallions and some cheddar on the side for folks to garnish the soup.  Huge hit at the office food day.

Yummy!  I added two carrots sliced up and used Knorr Leek soup mix instead of the other seasonings.  For sure the 8 POUNDS of potatoes has to be a typo; I used 8 potatoes.  Before adding the milk (I cut it down to 1 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of flour) I scooped out the carrots, then mashed the potato soup mixture; then put the carrots back in, added the milk and flour.  Topped with cheddar cheese and served!  Great!  Would make again!

This was a real life saver when my family and I got snowed in for 2 days. I added a little bit of cooked bacon and "squeeze" cheese the second time I made it and it made a terrific recipe just that much better!!

I made this soup and WOW! I loved it! I know a lot of the other reviews said that it was "plain" or had little taste, but the parsley, salt and pepper did it for me. I always add sour cream, cheese, and bacon bits to my potato soup per bowl anyway. My father-in-law was here when I made it and he said "Man, you're holding back on your cooking. This is great!" And my husband even said he liked it better than the potato soups we've had at restaurants. I didn't tell them where I got the recipe... heehee. ;)

By the way, DON'T even try skinning 8 lbs. of potatoes... that HAD TO be a typo. I skinned and cubed about 7-8 and that was clearly enough!

Great with cornbread! Thanks for the GRRRREAT recipe! I'll use it again and again.

I give this a 5 because my husband enjoyed it so much. I would give it a 4 for the amount of potatoes it calls for and the preparation time. I, too, as others mentioned, believe it should be 8 cups, not 8 lbs. Thankfully I used the 8 cups. And, there's no way this can be prepped in 10 minutes. I think I spent over 30 minutes prepping this. Guess I'm not the fastest potato/onion peeler, chopper in the kitchen. And, this makes a lot! I used a 5 quart crock pot and it nearly filled it to capacity. I also had ham on hand and chopped up about 2 cups worth to add.

Potatoes didn't soften into a creamy soup after cooking as directed, so then I cooked another 6 hrs on high. Very bland even when I added cheese and too starchy--not at all what I expected from potato soup! Keep looking for another recipe.

Maybe it was my fault, (I did follow the recipe exactly) but I thought this soup was incredibly bland. I was looking forward to it ALL day while at work, and my husband and I were both disappointed in the lack of flavor. I added garlic salt and a few other seasonings to try to help, but it also never thickened properly. I would not recommend this soup, but it might be good by adding ham or something flavorful!

---Oh, use about 8 cups potatos----
This is a good recipe and simple to follow.  I did add 2 small cloves of roasted garlic, some diced carrots, and finely chopped spinach, plus salt and pepper to taste.    * To roast garlic: Chop the very top off the garlic and wrap in foil.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 35-40 minutes.  Allow to cool and squeeze out the roasted garlic then mix into soup.***** UPDATE*****  I have made this soup several times and I use homemade chicken stock (one- frozen in a small fruit cup) insted of bouillon cubes. I add 4 cloves grated garlic, salt/pepper and onion powder to taste, some finely grated carrots(also pe-shredded and kept in freezer).  Once it is finished cooking, I will use the immersion blender and blend up a little of the soup, this makes it thicker(you could blend all, for a smooth soup).  Tastes great and way less fat than many other recipes!

I used chicken broth instead of water to give more flavor. I also cooked up some bacon and added 1/2 to the soup while it was cooking and the rest on top when serving. I used fresh minced garlic and diced onion sauteed them first before adding to bring out the flovors. Spiced it up with black pepper, salt, bay leafs. YUMMY

This was on my list of soups to learn to make!! Very pleased with it and the outcome. I used a can of chicken broth instead of the  water and chicken bouillon. I seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic salt. Prior to adding the milk and flour mixture I warmed it up in a seperate bowl, so I wouldn't be adding cold milk into a hot crock pot. This reduces the chances of curdling(?) with the milk. I serve with sour cream, shredded cheese and bacon crumbled on top. I also serve it in a sour dough bread bowl!!!

This is an excellent basic soup! On it's own it tends to be a little bland but since it's so basic it allows you to really make it your own! I added a lot of spices (dill, rosemary, and potato seasoning) plus crumbled bacon to mine and it turned out fantastically!

Very bland.  I followed the recipe as written for the seasonings & reduced the amount of potatoes.  I had to add more seasonings at the end, and it was still blah.  We ate it with sour cream & cheddar cheese to add some flavor.  I will not try this recipe again.

I made this recipe and it worked ok, but I made several changes... first, I used 3 lbs of new organic potatoes and kept them unpeeled... second, I added another onion and could have added one more, actually.... third, I added 2 cups of chopped broccoli and kale (finely chopped) from my garden... fourth, I added 2 TBL pepper and 2 TBL coarse kosher salt.  All the other ingredients I kept at the same measurements.  I cooked it all for six hours on HIGH. When it was time for the white sauce, I browned the flour in butter and cooked it with the milk on the stove before adding it to the crock.  End result?? Delicious!! Kids wouldn't touch it, but I loved it, and most any adult would probably agree.

This was a good basic recipe but even with the addition of a lot of spices it was a little bland.  Next time I might cook some cubed ham and add it to the soup for salt and flavor.

The texture is perfect but it is very bland. Definitely needed salt and was much better with garlic or cheddar cheese added.

First of all this soup was extremely bland. I added salt, pepper, and garlic just to choke it down. Secondly, The directions were not very clear on what size of cubes to cut the potatoes into..so I made them bigger. It turned out to be just potatoes with kind of a vegetable gravy. Very unappetizing. There must be better recepies than this one.

Maybe I am just not fast in the kitchen, but I found the prep time of ten minutes to peel and cube 8 pounds of potatoes and prepare all the other ingredients to be a joke.  The soup, more like lumpy mashed potatoes was okay, but I guess not good enough because nobody touched the leftovers.

A good basic recipe that you can tweak to your own liking.  I, like other reviewers, assumed 8 CUPS of potatoes were to be used.  :-). I omitted the onion, used 7 cups of vegetable broth instead of bouillon and water, and subbed plain rice milk for the milk.  Additionally, I added 3 carrots that were peeled and diced, 3 stalks of celery that were diced, 10 slices of cooked turkey bacon that were chopped, 2 tablespoons each of oregano, basil, and thyme.  I served the soup in sourdough bread bowls.  Dinner was a success!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

If you like you potatoes soft, than cook the length suggested. This is recipe that you will need to add your own spices otherwise bland.  A wonderful basic recipe!

This is a good basic recipe. I did add some celery, and before serving I added to eat bowl some shredded sharp cheddar and fresh bacon pieces. We also had to add quite a bit of salt to taste, but I did use low sodium bouillon, so that may be it.

we really love this soup however I add 2 cups of shredded cheese the last 30 mins then top with real bacon bits and scallions for a "loaded baked potato soup!!" YUMMY and great for a busy family. Use slow cooker liners for even less cleanup!

thought the soup was good but I could not get it creamy enough. I added some potato flakes to make it thicker and it did work but the texture was not as smooth as I would like it to be.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this soup had absolutely no taste to it whatsoever.  We both worked so hard at making this, and were very disappointed to find it so blan.  Maybe it was just us.

I love this recipe but added about 2 tablespoons (give or take) to give the soup just the right amount of flavor. My fiancée's grandparents loved this when we made it during a visit and it was very filling. Great soup!

Followed the recipe - but cooked this with a ham bone (left some meat on it and thawed it.) and cut the meat off the bone just before I added the thickening - not too rich and IT WAS GREAT!!!

This is nice since you can leave it cooking all day but I missed the butter and or cream I am used to in a cream soup. Definitely use 8 cups of potatoes as reviewers recommend and add plenty of salt, pepper, and desired seasonings to taste. I used fresh parsley and plenty of garlic herb seasoning. I topped the leftovers with a dollop of sour cream which helped give it a richer flavor. This would be good for those who are counting their calories.

This is a good basic potato soup recipe, however I think if it were made as directed it would be pretty bland as other posters have said.  I used 8 cups of potatoes instead of pounds and put salt and garlic powder on the potatoes before adding in the onion.  I also added some crispy crumbled bacon and just a little bit of the bacon grease that I had sauteed a little minced garlic in.  I added 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup also and put about 3/4 Cup of flour, it wasn't as thick as I would have liked so I added a little instant potato flakes to thicken it up a bit and once I got it into my bowl I added a little crumbled bacon on top and some shredded mild cheddar cheese.  Even though I salted the potatoes before starting the slow cooker, I still needed some salt and pepper in my bowl, so I would add some at the end or just add some to your bowl per your taste.  Overall it was a delicious soup!  Add some saltines on the side and it's great also!

This soup was quite good. I did add more vegetables to get better flavor than just onion and potato.  I used carrots and celery as well.  I used garlic salt and chicken boiullon. I also used soy milk instead of regular cow's milk because my daughter and I cannot have dairy.  It was delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

This was super easy to make (I left the skins on the potatos to cut down on prep time and increase nutrition) and my picky husband loved it! I used olive oil instead of butter, and just added milk to taste at the end. I found that if you don't add as much milk, you get a very creamy mashed potato dish too!

A bit bland but a good recipe. I made some alteration to it though. Instead of 8 pounds of potatoes, I used 8 cups. Instead of bullion cubes I used 2 cups of broth and a cup of water. I didn't use any flour or milk, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also added 2 tbls of dried italian herbs and 2 tbls of garlic salt.

Very good soup, but it is very basic! Use this recipe as a starting point and add whatever else you like. It's all about making it personal! It's a very basic recipe so I added more salt, pepper, some kosher salt, basil, oregano (just a little of the last two). It's fantastic with some homemade bread, a real feel good meal!

The soup junkie of the house really liked this. I made a few changes to give it more flavor: I used 4c veg broth and 2c water, added sprigs of rosemary and thyme, and added four whole cloves of garlic. I also used almond milk (1.5c, since it's thinner) and sprouted multigrain flour. Next time, I think I'll just blend some of the potatoes to thicken it up.

I was very happy with the way this turned out, once I made a few adjustments.  First of all, 4 or 5 pounds of potatoes is plenty.  More than that, and it will overflow your crockpot.  I used dried minced onion in place of fresh, and subbed vegetable bouillon for chicken.  I added liberal dashes of garlic salt and black pepper, and finally threw in about 1 1/2 t. of herbes de Provence on top of the ingredients in the recipe.  I believe it was this last herb blend that really made it into a very fine potato soup.  Will certainly make this again, perhaps adding a vegetarian meat substitute of some kind as an experiment.

I have made this several times. I think it is okay if you follow the recipe, but as others have said, it is a little lacking in flavor. So my second time around I added quite a bit of pepper, garlic, sea salt, extra parsley, oregano, and cheese for the last hour, to make it creamier and add flavor. With those additions, it is one I will make again!

This is probably the worst recipe on this site for a few reasons: 1. 8 pounds of potatoes is a typo; it should be 8 potatoes, the fact that this has been pointed out by users years ago and has yet to be corrected makes me question the credibility of every recipe on here 2. It takes much longer than 10 minutes to prep for this recipe, especially if you do it exactly the way it is written out 3. It is bland. Very very bland. I had to use a lot of other things just to make it taste good enough to eat. As it is, this recipe is practically worthless and a waste of good potatoes.

This was a great, easy soup. Added some ham and celery to give it more texture. My mother has been on a soft food diet for two months now, and this was by far the best she had eaten. She said it was like having "real" food again. Thanks for sharing.

My family was not overly thrilled with this potato soup recipe.  I agree with several other reviews that said it needed something more.  I tried adding some more seasonings, but it seemed very blah.  We ate our soup with cheddar cheese and bacon.  If we didn't have the bacon and cheese we would have been very disappointed.

Good starter recipe but needed to be seasoned!  I did grated medium cheddar once.  I sprinkled garlic salt another time.  I think bacon would also be good to add in at some point too...

I gave this recipe 3 stars mainly because it just wasn't my favorite. My husband loved it though. I think it could of had more flavor it turned out really well otherwise and thickened nicely.  Next time I will just add more to it.

Very bland, needs salt! I added about a Tbsp. of my husband's spice mixture to this, then he added more. Also added a lb. of crumbled sausage. Sliced the potatoes instead of cubing them (only used 3 large baking potatoes and that seemed like plenty). I am giving it 4 stars because it was a really good comfort food on a snowy day, but it does need salt/spices! (: ~~~Tan

I really enjoyed the creaminess of this soup, but it seemed a touch bland to me.  I think that it worked for us though, as my husband and I both added the seasonings that we wanted and enjoyed it.  I might try a little more spice next time, but it is a huge compliment that my husnad ate two bowls!

Easy soup! I added celery and used dried onion flakes instead of an onion. It also needed lots of salt and pepper. I also reduced the amount of potatos and chicken bouillon. I will try another reciepe next time.

This recipe should definitely say 8 CUPS of Potatoes. Not 8lbs. In the end the flavor was very bland. I added an extra boullion, some rosemary and thyme. A lot of salt and pepper and a dash of red pepper flakes. For the last 15minutes i added a cup of cheddar cheese and cooked chopped bacon. After that it was perfect

4 stars because I adapted the recipe, but it's a good based. potatoes should be in cups not pounds. I halved the recipe.  I added minced garlic (like 1 tablespoon) and a package of pre chopped ham and omitted the butter. turned out really good!

I added diced ham (4 cups)  and a bag of shredded cheddar cheese.I also added about 1/3 cup water to flour and mixed this together BEFORE I added the milk.It made it much easier to get the lumps out.

Excellent recipe.   I agree with all others that it gets 5 star as a base recipe for a phenomenal potato soup. What I added made this soup phenomenal.  Hoping you find your additions to do the same.

It was yummy!  The only changes I made were: I did not use quite so many potatoes, I added bacon bits to the recipe, and I added cheese on top before eating.

I sauteed the onion before adding to slow cooker.  The soup came out very bland.  Had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to it before eating.  I also added some dry dill.  I don't think I will be making this soup again.

I had potatoes to use and wanted to make something warm, comforting and easy, so decided to use this recipe. The 2 star rating is for the original recipe. I read some of the reviews before making this so added in extra herbs, salt, pepper, corn, and served it with bacon crumbled on top which helped the flavour, but I still found the actual base of the soup was watery and relatively not that flavourful, so even with my adjustments I would only give it a 3.5. I think it could also help by having less liquid, using a broth instead of water and a canned soup instead of milk.

Im sorry but Recipe as is ...two stars just for the ease of cooking but the recipe is Very very bland. I added salt, pepper, garlic, celery,  green onion, chicken & cayenne after I tasted the original recipe to give it some flavor. A good base recipe to build on if you have an idea of how to spice things on your own. But if you lack cooking skills I wouldn't follow this recipe on its own with no additions.

This recipe is exactly what I needed it to be: a basic foundation, with instructions, for a thick and creamy potato soup.  I added chopped celery and carrots, and I substituted the chicken bouillon with a can of cream of chicken (it was all I had). Also swapped out the milk for some heavy cream since I like my soup thick.

I definitely recommend adding your favorite spices...potato soup is normally pretty bland, so it can't hurt to add more salt and pepper, maybe even some garlic, if those suit your tastes.  Garnish with sour cream and cheddar and you will be in heaven.

This will be a must on St. Patrick's Day.  Thank you for this recipe!

Pretty disappointing.  I didn't read all the other reviews first, so my bad.  6-8 hours on low on our crockpot were not enough - should have been on high.  Way too many potatoes, the onion didn't cook and very very bland.  I will read some of the reviews where people posted alternate recipes essentially and try again.  Now I'm not sure what to do with 8 lbs of partially cooked potatoes....:(

This recipe is great as a base. After reading other reviews I made some changes and the resulting sup was delicious.

I made some adjustments to the recipe I used 1 cup half and half and 1 cup milk for a more creamy taste. I also added garlic salt and black pepper. With those adjustments the soup was great! I also added shredded cheese and bacon bits on top.

This soup was a hit with the kids, who never eat soup...really easy to prepare and cook in the crock pot. I added some bacon and it was very good.

Very easy dinner for those cold winter days.  I would add plenty of salt and pepper to taste.  I am so glad that I tried this dish!  It fed all my hungry "men" with some to spare.
