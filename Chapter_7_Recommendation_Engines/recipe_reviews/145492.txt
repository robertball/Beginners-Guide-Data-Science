Instead of a large cucumber, I used four mini gourmet cukes which I had in the fridge, and sliced both the cukes and onion in the food processor (this took about 2 mins).  The cucumbers were smaller, so I knew they would require less time than the recipe specified, and these were done in less than 3 minutes.  Of course, the cooking time will depend on the power of your microwave, but mine were perfectly crisp-tender.  I would caution you to start with fewer minutes, and if needed, just add more time.  You don’t want to end up with a jar of mushy pickles.  And the way these break out nutritionally, you can eat as many as you want!  Very nice, this one’s a keeper.

This recipe makes lovely fresh tasting pickles in no time, I didn't have any celery seed so I left that out and I like my pickles really sharp so I used only about 1/4c and maybe 2T of splenda.  My cucumber and onion were slightly unevenly cooked as I cut them by hand so I'd recommend using a mandolin or food processor like another reviewer did (I just couldn't be bothered).  I cooked it at 2 minute intervals and stirred and checked in between to make sure I didn't overcook them.
