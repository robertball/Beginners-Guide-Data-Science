Pretty drink and tastes good too. I layered the drink first with the ice, then vodka, then OJ and finally cranberry juice. If you pour slowly it comes out layered. Unfortunately I only had light cranberry juice which is slightly more brown than red. You can see in my photo it would be a little prettier with the deep red juice. Tasted good, just the color was off...my fault. Anyway, with all that juice in there, you can almost convince yourself it's good for you!

Instead of stirring in the glass, I shook all the ingredients in a cocktail shaker. Very good.

i used sunny delight instead of orange juice and it changed the taste to a smoother version. Everyone @ the party thought it was just a plain punch.... But it  had quite a punch to it??

This is a great drink for the fruity drink lovers.  I use fresh squeezed OJ.  I also make a cranberry concentrate with fresh cranberries.  Just put the cranberries in a pot with about an inch or 2 of water and boil down, strain and push through strainer with back of wooden spoon.  Don't add sugar to the cranberries, there's plenty natural sugar in the OJ.  I also add a shot of Chambord, its a blackberry liquour.

A little tart for us, so we halved the cranberry juice and it was perfect for us. We also added a splash of ginger ale.

I made this when I hosted Bunko and it was a big hit.  You can't taste the vodka so you got to be careful not to get your guest too drunk.  I will for sure make this again.

As a full-time bartender for the last 15 years, this my ultimate go-to "girl drink." I touch it up with a dash of grenadine and lime juice. Most women who don't know anything about drinks, or even how to order a drink, will really love this one.

This is super simple and tasty! All I had was pomegranate vodka on hand (but I'm not complaining!) and it worked out great. I like that it's more on the refreshing side and not super sweet.

Very tasty! I already had all the ingredients on hand and made it quickly on a stay at home date night. Personally, I like my drinks more stiff, so I added twice the amount of vodka. Thanks for the recipe!
