I'm on Weight Watchers, so to make this a little more diet friendly, I made a few changes.  I only used 2T butter total, 2T olive oil, and divided it between the skillet and the sauce. I made the sauce with 1 T butter, 1T olive oil, lemon juice, basil, garlic, and chicken broth. I also added in asparagus and fresh tomatoes.  And - I used whole wheat pasta. All in all, very tasty. This recipe was a great jumping off point and I still stayed on WW. 1 serving was 6 points.

Good recipe. My 3 & 6 yr old girls LOVED this dish!   I did a few things different. I skipped the step of placing the scallops on the plate to cover w/ basil. I added Basil to the mixture in before mixing w/ the scallops.  I transferred the scallops first to the skillet and began to brown them. After a minute or so, I added the remaining mixture where the scallops were. Once completely browned, I added fresh Asparagus tips.  I didn't use as much butter and used extra garlic & basil.   I am so excited that my kids loved it! I am certainly going to keep this recipe and play around with other ingredients to add.

This was good.  The butter, garlic and lemon combination is very tasty. I used fresh basil instead of dried, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

Okay, I made quite a few different changes. First off I totally omitted the oil, and I only used 6 tbsp butter. I cooked the scallops in the juice of one orange and one lime (I hate the taste of fishiness). Once those had cooked about 3-5 mins I drained all but about 1 tbsp of the juices off the scallops (just eyeball it) put it back on the stove and then put your basil and I added 1 tsp of garlic powder and onion powder. Let the rest of the juice cook off and then add the butter sauce. Once that is coated I add about 2 1/2 cups of broccoli. (It is wonderful with this dish and I always use fresh ingredients where possible) but then you cover and let simmer for about 5-8 mins or until the broccoli is done but not wilted. I also prepare an alfredo sauce while this is simmering. I think it cuts down the greasiness and adds a little something extra. (you can make low fat sauce as well just use no fat milk and the healthy butter if there really is one :) ) but once it is all done I have the pasta in the same pot as the scallops/broccoli and add the sauce to the pot. It is most definitely a huge hit with my husband and he eats until he is miserable and has done that each of the four times I have made this dish. I know this is long but I hope that someone enjoys this as much as my family and I have.

Well, there was no way I was going to waste the scallop marinade. So, I thawed out a 10 oz box of frozen chopped spinach and squeezed it dry.  After searing the scallops, I deglazed the pan with a half cup of dry white wine and let it reduce, then added 4 tbsp butter, the remaining basil and garlic, and sauteed the spinach. Then I added the scallop marinade, and let it cook at high heat to kill any bacteria and reduce...checked for seasonings, then added two ladlefuls of pasta water to make a sauce.  Returned the scallops to the sauce to make sure they were cooked through, then mixed with hot pasta and topped with parmesan cheese. Excellent! With the use of the pasta water I did not use more than 1/4 c of olive oil and 4 tbsp butter.  Very good.

I tried this recipe tonight.Thought it was terrific. I had planned it for two, but we had unexpected company for dinner. Only had enough scallops for 2, so I had to supplement with shrimp. Other than that I followed the recipe almost to the "T".I sauteed spinach in the pan I cooked the scallops and shrimp in an added that to the pasta.Will definitly use this recipe again,with maybe a bit more garlic,(just our pesonal taste)

The flavor of the scallops was very bold, or as my husband said, "The scallops really pack a whallop!".  We like liked the contrast with the more bland tasting pasta.  Next time, I will not add the full amount of butter/oil.  I felt it was too much.  I also used fresh basil and garlic and spaghettini noodles.

This was very yummy! I used small scallops that we gathered ourselves during scalloping season.  I also used spiral noodles and fresh garlic  instead. This, for me, was wonderful and simple and tasted like something I would order at a resturaunt. A must try!

Quite good, though I definitely cut back on the oil and butter, and it still came out fine.  I also added a little more garlic than this recipe calls for.  Overall, a very good dish!

I'm not great with measuring but I did make some changes.  First I took out the oil, and did not place the scallops in a bowl with seasonings.  Just cooked them in butter, extra garlic and browned them.  Keep the lemon out - an earlier reviewer is correct, the scallops won't brown. I added about a T of the basil.   After cooking the scallops I put them aside and I added some wine (about 1/4 c) to deglaze.  Then I added asparagus tips to the pan.  After about 4-5 min, I added the scallops back to the pan.  I melted the remaining butter (only used 7 Tlbs) and the lemon.  Poured this over the bow tie pasta, added parmesan cheese, mixed, then added the scallops and more parmesan cheese.  Chopped up some fresh parsley on top.   Excellent!!

I think that this recipe uses great ingredients however 9 tablespoons of butter is an absolutely ridiculous amount of butter that no one on a diet or not should be eating in one serving. I would completely delete it from the recipe and substitute it with EVOO and if you crave a little bit of savory calories, add a touch of cream to give it a bit of a different texture and look that can fool the biggest butter lover.

I made my own variation of this, using what I had on hand: small bay scallops, quinoa linguini pasta, and the addition of some white wine, broccoli, and grape tomatoes.  I sauteed the scallops with wine, butter, a little olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt, pepper, basil, a little cilantro, and onion powder.  After they were cooked, I set them aside, deglazed the pan with more wine, and sauteed some frizen broccoli using the same ingredients as above.  Once the broccoli was tender I added a few grape tomatoes, let them cook through, and added the scallops back into the pan with the veg.  Severed over qunion linquini. I thought this was really tasty and will definitely make again.  I think it would have been just as good using the original recipe if you have the items on hand.

This was amazing.  I was afraid that I would burn the scallops as the basil was really browning quickly, but it turned out delicious.  The only changes I made were omitting 1/4 cup of the oil and using fresh basil in the sauce.  Also served with shaved Parmesan cheese.

This was delicious! To make it healthier I used whole wheat pasta, fresh garlic, fresh basil, margarine, and I added chopped roma tomatoes. Can't wait to make this again!

The recipe is 5 star!  However, next time I will use the bigger and less fishy sea scallops. (I used frozen bay scallops ) :(  This basic recipe could be used for any kind of fish, shellfish, or even chicken.  The fresh basil is a must!

I think this turned out delicious but not sure why so many bowls used in the directions;  The butter w/lemon wont sear them, it will only saute them; you'll need to sear them in just oil or butter first (I used hot olive oil) and then add the lemon in later; I tried it the directions way and it didn't work!   I think the texture is better with a little crust on them.   I didn't want to waste the marinate so I added it in the sauce for more lemon flavor; I also added some fresh basil.  :)

I loved this recipe! I did this and it only took around 30 to 40min total. About 15 to 20 minutes to cook the past, and about 10 minutes to cook the scallops. All the rest is easy!

I found this to be very bland. I used bay scallops because that's all I had. I added some oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes with some of the oil to add a bit more flavor. If I had some parmesan, I would have added that too give give some more flavor.  I think this is a good basis for a scallop and pasta recipe to build onto. Use this recipe as a starting point, a recipe to emphasize on and add things that you think would compliment and improve the recipe.

Instead of pasta, I made a bed of wilted spinach and artichoke hearts and placed the scallops on top.  This is the same meal that I had at one of Seattle's nicer restaurants that cost $175.00 for two.  Although not quite as tasty as the restaurant scallops, it was certainly a close second for a fraction of the price.

Excellent!  We didn't feel like pasta so just did the scallops.  Great meal!

I thought this was great. My daughter compared it to a nice italian restaurant that we frequent. I added about a pound of precooked shrimp ( peeled and deveined), along with the scallops. Also, more garlic to our taste. I will definitely be making this again.

We liked this, I took the advice of others and cut down the oil and butter a bit and I thought it still tasted yummy. I added some other stuff I had around like mushrooms, artichoke hearts, peeled tomato and red pepper fresh from the garden.  I also added a touch of white white because I cook with wine and sometimes put it in the food you know!

After reading some of the comments about the lack of flavour, I decided to add a hot pepper just in case. It turned out really great. I did reduce the oil and butter a bit though. I also decided to go with sea salt. Very quick and easy.

This was just ok. I cut way back on the oil and butter and it was still to fatty for us. I added fresh spinach and orange bell pepper for nice flavor.

I enjoyed this! 

I made couscous instead of pasta, didn't include any butter in the recipe, added shrimp (in a 1:1 ratio with the scallops), and included a light sprinkling of red pepper flakes on the seafood while it was cooking. I also spritzed lemon and lime juice over the seafood as it cooked.

I didn't find it bland at all (as other reviews seemed to) and will definitely be making this again. Quick and easy: just what I like to cook. :)

Four stars as I followed other's suggestions...
- browned scallops only in butter and garlic
- used chicken broth to deglaze pan
- added 1T basil, salt, pepper, 1/4 cup lemon juice, dash cream, extra chicken broth, and more butter to make sauce. Let simmer down and thicken a bit
- wilted two big handfuls if fresh spinach 
- added scallops back in
- spooned all over pasta.
Yum! Great starting point for the recipe, sooo yummy, going into the circulation for sure!

I LOVED this pasta-I ate all of the leftoves cold the next day. The sauce was DELICIOUS. However, the basil was way too heavy for those who ate it. I cut that in half, but it was still overpowering. I'll probably make it again with just a pinch of basil. The pasta will be my new go-to for dinner, though!

Just made this last night and it was really great. However we followed the comment on the top and added some spinach, roasted tomatoes and a little bit of mozzarella it probably would have been a little bland without it. Just greased a skillet with some olive oil and tossed in the spinach and tomatoes (we were lazy and bought them pre roasted) and cooked until the spinach was slightly wilted and added to the cooked pasta. Next time I'm going to try fresh basil.

I'll definitely be making this again. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had lemon basil on hand instead of regular basil. I'll try it w/ regular basil next time. It was easy to make and tasted great.

Amazing! I made only slight modifications:  - Used orzo because that's all I had  - I removed the scallops from the skillet once cooked and used the same skillet to make the sauce.  - Added 2 cups fresh spinach and orzo to the sauce. Cooked for a few minutes, then served topped with the scallops.

I really wanted to like this because we love scallops. I tasted the scallops after cooking them and they were delicious. I have to say though that there is way to much oil in the sauce, and it was kind of bland. I will probobly make the scallops this way again but serve them with a rice dish and vegetable.

This recipe was great! My family loved it! I did add asparagas, one yellow pepper, and some grape tomatoes sliced in twos the last few minutes of cooking the scallops. My family said it was fresh, light, and very tasty! Next time I think I'm going to add oregano to it too. Thank you so much for an easy and wonderful recipe.

Very good and easy, I think next time I will cut back the oil/butter (although the oil on the dinner plates made a great dredge for our bread sticks) it was just to much. I also added the marinade to the pan and cooked it to pour over  the pasta.

I thought this was great!  Light, and fairly quick and easy to make. I bought frozen scallops and had small issues defrosting.  I will just pay a couple extra dollars and get them at the meat counter next time.

Made it by the recipe and added a bit more garlic. You can cut back on the butter and I added a little olive oil to sauté the scallops. Next time I'll add a little lemon to the pasta drizzle along with fresh basil.

Used canola oil and parsley in stead of vegetable and basil, baby scallops in stead of jumbo and added uncooked shrimps to the scallops and fried them together. This is a really good recipe but next time I won't use what they call for with lemon juice, 1/4 tsp. Is too much and is very over powering.

Super easy. I used minced garlic instead of dried, to give it more zip, and added asparagus tips to the boiling pasta for the last 3 minutes. I sprinkled Romana cheese on top... it was delicious!  Will make again but add even more garlic and pepper.

Nothing special, far too much basil for my liking.  Would be better with white wine sauce and Parmesan cheese.  I was embarrassed to serve this.

Great recipe. I made some changes though. I sautéed some mushrooms and onions and added some steamed brocoli to the pasta. For the sauce, I took the left over marinade and added about a 1/2 cup of broth and creme and let it reduce a bit. Very yummy yet easy.

This recipe was really easy and delicious! I added quartered grape tomatoes in mine just to add a little more color.  I also used large scallops because they tend to shrink about 50% after cooking.  Hope this helps ^^

very very good.  The pasta was excellent.  I used ziti and would love to make this dressing with it every time!  I did use 1/3 less butter and olive oil than it called for and a lot more garlic.

My boyfriend and I tried this recipe for Sunday dinner. We actually added shrimp to this recipe as well and it was delicious.

This was a nice, light dinner I made tonight. I added extra garlic, and next time I think I'll cut back on the oil just a bit. Thanks for the recipe, Grace.

This recipe was okay but to be fair, I did change a few things.  I messed up and added the dried basil to the mixture.  I cut back on the amount of basil because I added fresh basil from my garden toward the end of cooking.  I also added some tomato and some shrimp.  I cut back a little on the butter & oil and served with grated parmesian cheese.  It was very easy to make and resulted in an "okay" meal but not anything we raved about.

We didn't really like this recipe. It just didn't have much flavor.

I would give this recipe a 4, but my husband thought it was too bland. The pasta itself was too olive-oily for him. The scallops were fantastic.

Not bad, but a little too much butter and olive oil. Pro: Quick and easy and doesn't require hard to find ingredients.
