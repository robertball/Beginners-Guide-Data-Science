My husband is a huge peach pie fan, and he asked me to bake him one with some locally grown peaches he'd gotten recently.  His only request was that the pie not be a peach 'cream' pie, but a regular peach pie.  This pie was pretty easy to prepare, but I gave it only 4 stars because it was a little sour.  I'm wondering if 1/2 cup sugar was enough.  It was also a bit runny, so I will add a little more flour next time and bake a few minutes longer.  The almond extract added a really nice flavor.  I also brushed the top crust with butter and sprinkled it with sugar.  I will definitely make again with more tweaking.  Maybe some cinnamon next time?

5 WHOPPIN' stars!  OK, I did make one change.....my peaches are in season and VERY juicy and sweet I did not even add the white sugar only the 1/4 cup brown called for. (PACKED by the way)  OMGosh it was perfect.....all the flavors just blended perfectly and my pie was not uber sweet which we do not like.  A MILLION thanks for sharing this amazing yet so, so simple recipe! **By the way I followed this to the letter except for the sugar and the pie set up perfectly**

This recipe deserves five stars without the almond extract and needs SIX stars WITH the almond extract! Genius addition!

This recipe is pretty good, but the only thing I would change would be the crust. It was very dry and tasteless. If you are going to try this recipe, use a different recipe for the crust!

My sister wanted peach pie for her birthday in March, so I used frozen peaches.  I should have let them drain longer because the pie was pretty soupy, but it didn't effect the taste.  Everybody loved it!!  I did have to use vanilla instead of the almond extract.  I'll definately try it again this summer with fresh peaches.  Yum!!

This is very good, delicious really. And pretty to look at. I used white peaches ( my personal favorite) and followed the advice to drain the peaches over a bowl, cut the sugars to 1/2 cup white, 1/4 cup brown.  The pie was still somewhat liquidity but I'm guessing that most peach pies are - wouldn't want a dry pie!!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I need to taste another peach pie to compare it to - this  is my first attempt. I uploaded a photo, the one with the pie sitting on a wire rack to show how yummy it it !Try it, you WILL like it !!

We loved this peach pie recipe.  The almond extract enhances the peach flavor!  I used the Pie Crust IV recipe for the crust - it was a great compliment to this recipe

Yum! This was delish! I replaced the sugar with splenda and used light butter. I also baked these with a single crust in cupcake pans for mini-pies. These were amazing!

I am only giving this pie 1 star because it's a peach pie. Unfortunately for me my pie turned out terrible. It wasn't sweet enough, 5 cups was not enough filling to fill my normal pie pan, and I didn't enjoy the flavor with the nutmeg or almond paired. Peach pie is my absolute favorite, so to make this pie and have it be such a disaster was very disappointing. I will not make this pie again. :(

this was great!  I made it exactly as shown and it turned out wonderful.  Instead of making one big pie I made 4 mini pies.
