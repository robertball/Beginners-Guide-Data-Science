Delicious! I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts marinated overnight. Baked the chicken for 30 minutes and reduced the marinade on the stovetop. I added a tablespoon of brown sugar and a teaspoon of lemon juice to it, thickened it with cornstarch and WOW!  Awesome over rice!!!!

This chicken turned out wonderfully. We really enjoyed it. I would agree with the reviewer who said that 16 oz. of dressing and 16 oz. of salsa is way too much (resulted in a lot of waste; try it w/ 8 oz of each first and then add more if you need to) and I would also agree with the person that said this takes a lot longer than 20 minutes to cook. I would say it took closer to 50 minutes.

i was a little nervous when i decided to make this,I wasnt sure how well salsa and Italian dressing would go together but i had to give it a try and it was sooo good. My whole family loved it. Thanks!!!!Update: I took Jannets advise and used the marinade to top the rice. Put the brown sugar, lemon juice and cornstarch in. Now im addicted!!

Ok I saw that the reviews said this was good...but I was a bit disappointed.  I reduced the amount of dressing and salsa, but it just didn't have the taste that I expected.  It was definately easy and something I could throw together when I have other things to do, so I might use again.  Thanks all the same.

Okay, I didn't follow this exact recipe but it was really really good.  I used cut up boneless skinless chicken breasts and probably half of the recommened marinade since I was only feeding 3 people.  Turned out really tasty, have even done this with a cheap flank steak too.

I made this tonight and it was moist and delicious! I used a 2 1/2 lb. bag of boneless skinless chicken breasts, 1 cup mild Pace Chunky Salsa and 1 cup Fat Free Kraft Zesty Italian dressing, marinated overnight in a gallon sealable bag. Discarded marinade and baked for 25 minutes in a foil lined (for EASY cleanup!) 13x9 inch pan @ 375 degrees. The sauce in the pan was wonderful served over rice. If you need or want more sauce just mix equal parts of the Pace and Zesty. I look forward to serving this no-fail easy dish for company.

This is a good meal but when I had it in the oven on broil for the 20 minutes that the recipe called for it was not even close to cooked.  I ended up baking it for a bit over a half hour after the initial 20 minutes.

Otherwise - good easy to prepare meal :)

Like many reviewers have said before, cut down the marinade to 8 oz. of salad dressing and salsa each.  Very juicy, tasty chicken.  Great with potatoes!

This is so easy to make! Very tasty.  I now make this every couple of weeks and bring it work for lunch.  Plus, using boneless chicken breasts and fat free italian dressing, it's quite low fat.
Thanks for this great, simple recipe.

Ok .. . I'm giving this five stars because it is soooo surprisingly good considering how easy it was to prepare.  I would have been even more skeptical had it not been for so many good reviews.  I used one pkg. of breasts and one of thighs. .. covered the whole 9x13, so the amount of marinade was perfect.  I followed the advice of those who reduced the leftover marinade and then added the 1 Tbsp. brown sugar, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and and thickened with corn starch.  I served it on a bed of brown rice that I had cooked with chicken broth and ladled the yummy sauce on top.  It was really good!  My kids loved it too.  I will definitely make this again.  I baked it on 450 for 30 minutes.  I'm sure it's great on the grill or broiled, but the oven is a safe bet for this multi-tasker!  Thanks, TBASTIA!

I did not have time to marinate so I just put thawed chicken breast, salsa, and italian dressing in a baking dish.  I baked it at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes and put the chicken and sauce over some angel hair pasta.  It was quick, easy, and tasted great.

This was very easy to make.   I did make a second batch of the marinade and mixed it with cooked rice which my family enjoyed.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

When I made this, I didn't thaw the chicken before I marinated it, I just set it in the amrinade on the kitchen counter for about 5 hours.  Because of this, the flavor wasn't very strong after I cooked it.  It was pretty good, but not great.  I'm going to give it another try, and this time make sure I thaw the chicken before marinating it.

I chose to cook boneless skinless chicken breast in the sauce in the crock pot. Once the chicken was tender I cut it into cubes and simmered a while longer. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch and served over minute rice. So easy and we love it!!!! I'll definitely be fixing this again.

Pretty tasty and much better than I expected from the ingredients.  My husband really enjoyed this and it's so simple that I'm sure I'll make this fairly often.

We did it a little bit differently. We used frozen breast tenders and marinated them in a ziplock as they defrosted. Then I poured everything into a Pyrex baking dish and baked at 450 for about 25 minutes. They came out absolutely delicious and this was the easiest recipe ever. We loved it!

My husband actually complimented my cooking when I served this to him.  Usually I get a grunt and a nod from him but this time he used actuall words "This is really good, dear."

I found the use of 16 oz of both Salsa and Salad dressing a bit excessive so next time I make it, I plan to use only 8 oz of each.  Other than that, I thought it was fantastic!

Awesome. Doesn't sound very tasty but it is. I used chicken breast instead of thighs and I marinated overnight. I also baked it in the oven instead of grilling. I just poured everything in a dish and baked it for 30 minutes. Had lots of tasty sauce to put on top of the white rice I served with it along with broccoli with cheese sauce. The whole family enjoyed this which is something that doesn't happen very often. Sometime the simplest ingredients turn out the best.

I cooked it in the marinade @450 for about 30 minutes a day. I didn't have Italian dressing, but oddly enough had 3 bottles of raspberry walnut vinaigrette so used that instead - and it came out great!

This recipe is a good base, but needs some tweaking. Definitely reduce the vinaigrette and salsa by half (at least). I did add brown sugar and lemon juice as one reviewer suggested. This does need some thickener, whether it be flour or cornstarch. Chicken is moist, but the sauce/marinade lacks flavour. This would of course be much better using homemade vs. the prepackaged items called for, but I do think this could use some kind seasoning (more herb flavour; tomato is very prominent) and some mozzarella. Don't think I'd use brie with this, it's not that upscale of a meal.

This was pretty good.  It's so easy.  I threw mine in the crockpot and shredded the chicken after about 7 hours on low.  My husband tried it like a chicken burrito and in a sandwich with cheese and Ranch dressing- both were good.  It's a keeper for ease and versatility- I think the flavor might be missing something.....

My Husband really likes this one. For an extra touch I add some mozzerella on the top of each peice of chicken a couple of minutes before I take it out of the oven. I serve it over a bed of white rice.

This tasted a whole lot better than I thought. I used chicken tenders and marinated them all day, then I just poured everything in a 13 x 9 and baked it in the oven for 20 mins. on 450. I will definitley make this again.

Probably the best grilled chicken I have ever had. I like breasts and my husband likes thighs so I used both and I have to admit the thighs held the flavor better.  Husband is not good at trying new things and he loved the bow tie pasta with the extra marinade(used suggestion to add brown sugar and lemon juice I may have used a little too much lemon juice, was a definite strong citrus/vinegar flavor but was still good, I did not have corn starch so I omitted that part).  Will definitely be using this recipe again.

This was OK. I used 1 chicken breast (I was just cooking for myself) instead of thighs and marinated it overnight in 1/4 C salsa and 1/4 C italian dressing in a sandwhich baggy. I then grilled it on the forman grill, cut it into chunks and tossed it together with penne pasta and feta cheese. I think it would have tasted better if I had of cut it into chunks when it was raw so that it may have absorbed more flavor while marinating as I found the chicken tasted a little bland! Overall though it was still tasty (just need a little bit more of an "oomph"!).

This recipie was really good.  The chicken had good flavor and was really tender.  And it had that little crispiness to the tops. 
I used boneless, skinless thighs-- and when they were done they kind of looked like little frogs.  Next time I will line the pan with foil because it's going to be a mess to clean it up.

A very good quick meal that can be healthy if prepared right.  The only problem is wanting to eat more.  As specified in the ingredients, the ratio of italian dressing to salsa is 1:1.  It should remain this way, its perfect.  I had some salsa in the freezer I wanted to use before it went bad, and an itatlian dressing packet (vinegar and oil based).  The salsa I had was not tomato based, so I decided to add crushed tomatoes to the mix, using the rest of the can to make pasta sauce as I do quite frequently.  Preparation was a bit of a rush since I had just gotten back from running and was famished.  The pre-defrosted chicken breasts were grilled with a bit of blackened seasoning, and the marinade then turned into a topping.  Served over a bed of whole-grain rice which the marinade mixed with deliciously.  I try to keep meals at a 4:3:3 ratio of carbohydrates protein & fats.  This did very well, and tasted great in the process.   Also have more of the marinade & rice for tomorrow all I will have to do is cook the chicken so prep time should be less than 10 mins for the next round!

I have had almost this same recipe only when I had it the "marinade" mixture of 1 part dressing and 1 part salsa was used as a sauce over basic grilled chicken and grilled ribeye steaks; when I made it I eyeballed my amounts of each in equal parts and simmered multicolored pepper strips over low/med heat in a sauce pan until the peppers were tender then I served it as a warm sauce for our grilled meats. It was a big hit and we probably benefited from the flavors of the combination as a sauce rather than a marinade.

Wow! I must admit that I was hesitant about mixing Italian dressing and salsa ... but this was amazing and so, so, sooo easy! Everyone else's review on this is right: the sauce is absolutely wonderful over rice. I will be making this again very soon! Thanks for this recipe!

Sounded like a strange combination but we loved this chicken.  I did reduce the recipe in half as there are only two of us.  Made plenty with enough for lunch the next day.  I am definitely making again.

I also initially thought that this combination of ingredients was a bit odd, but it wound up tasting amazing after broiling in the oven. Like the other reviews had stated, I only used about half of the marinade and still had plenty (I used about a pound of skinless chicken thighs).

I made this for two of us, using boneless, skinless thighs. It was very tasty but do not  try to do this on the grill. The marinade really flames and it is difficult to get the chicken fully cooked without burning it. I ended up finishing the chicken in the microwave. It was very tasty and I will make it again, in the oven. I used about 1/4 cup of each salsa and salad dressing and marinated it all day, There wasn't enough marinade to boil down into a sauce but the chicken didn't need it- very moist and tasty. I added Parmesan cheese but my husband ate his plain. A keeper for sure.

i was going to have bf grill the chicken, but after seeing other reviewers cook it on the stove top in the marinade itself and use the liquid to pour over rice i figured i'd do the same.. i used chopped up pieces of chicken breast for the thighs.. and yes they came out very juicy, but i thought it was kind of bland.. this would go good in a taco or a salad where there are other flavors going on.. and the leftover liquid doesn't seem flavorful enough to serve over rice.. i'll stick to plain jane italian dressing if i'm looking for something quick and simple

I was skeptical but this was great!  I used boneless skinless chicken breast since that's what I had thawed out, and I did reduce the amount of salsa and dressing to 8 oz each. I had mango salsa and it added a sweet flavor. I followed a couple of other reviewers and baked it at 375 for about 30 minutes and turned on the broiler for the last few minutes to get a good browning. I reduced and thickened the marinade to serve over the chicken and rice (rice and kale, you can find the recipe on here as well).

The chicken picked up some flavor (marinated 2 days), but next time I will put some marinade aside (before adding chicken) and use it as a sauce.  It's good with rice.

I think the name of this dish is not very appealing and the idea of mixing salsa and italian dressing seemed odd but it really made a fantastic tasting chicken.  I don't care for thighs so I used boneless chicken breasts and  I reduced the grilling time.  Came out very juicy and had a nice flavor.

It's cooking right now, and smells great. I've always used Italian dressing for marinating veggie, but the combo seemed interesting. I added a small amount of brown sugar, salt, pepper and a tiny sprinkle of curry powder and a lot of minced garlic; because some of the reviews said it needed a little something the smells went together well in my head. I've never cooked anything just on broil, so i am nervous! But! I'm trying it this way, maybe it will open doors lol.
