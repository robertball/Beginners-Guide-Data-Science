My Mother was born in Scotland and raised in Ireland and used to make this lovely cake for us when we were children.  How we loved it!  Now that I am a grandma myself I will make Dundee cake for my grandchildren and set up a lovely tea party.  Can't wait.  Thanks for putting up this beautiful recipe.

A beautiful cake that's very easy. I cooked it at a higher level in the oven for the first 1/3 of the baking time, then moved it to the lowest rack for the remainder, turning it at the same time. I used half wholewheat flour but otherwise I changed nothing. Simply  perfect! Thank you for a great recipe.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, it turned out amazing! The crumb is very light and the cake is not too sweet, which is just the way we love it.
