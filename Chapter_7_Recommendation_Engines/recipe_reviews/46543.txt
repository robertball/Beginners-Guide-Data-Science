We love these pork chops, I use a whole pork loin when it is on sale, lightly freeze and slice very thin(no pounding necessary)...the first time I made them as is and they were good, but missing something. The second time I made them I seasoned the flour with garlic, ginger, salt, and pepper and they were fantastic! Such a small change made such a big difference in flavor!! My 9yr old that rarely eats much meat ate 6 of these...not sure where he put them ;-) Served with jasmine rice, stir fry veggies(frozen bag of stir fry blend + bag frozen broccoli), and buttered potatoes(chinese buffet style)...but the pork chops are always the highlight of the meal!!

This was really good.  The pork turned out very crispy and light.  Service it with Awesome Rice Pilaf and Lucy's Quick Tonkatsu Sauce both from AllRecipes.  Great meal.  Thanks for posting

This is ok but marinating the pork after being pounded thin, with Rice wine, and pinch of sugar and dash of sesame oil makes it more than a modified Austrian schnitzel which this basically is..

This was a great, basic Tonkatsu recipe!  I also seasoned the pork chops with garlic and some ground ginger for added flavor.  This was served with a salad and Tonton Ginger dressing (found at Wegmans and Costco).

Simple and delicious tonkatsu - it was perfect as is with no alterations. I did take some additional steps with some of my tonkatsu to make it into Katsudon. Amazing!

My boyfriend and I love this!  Need to make it again soon.  I made my own little sauce to go with (just ginger (used the stuff from the jar) soy, and wasabi!  Went soo well with it.  Can't remember exactly what I did for a side but I'm thinking next time just some kind of boxed Asian pasta....  Oh!  I used thin pork chops but I like one of the reviews about using a tenderloin...that would be even better! :o)

Delicious!  I used pork tenderloin which I pounded thin. Breading came out very crispy, while the inside was tender and juicy. I served these with Aldi's BangBang sauce because that's what I had on hand. Yum!

This recipe turned out great! As I was frying in a cast iron pan for the first time, I underestimsated how hot the oil would get, and ended up burning the first couple cutlets. After I changed out the oil and cooked on medium heat, they all turned out better than I expected!

This was good, but we all preferred the Chicken version.
