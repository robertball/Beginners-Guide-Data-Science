Interesting combination of flavors with nice presentation.  I only wished that I'd been able to roll out the dough a bit more to get a swirled/pinwheel effect when slicing.  Simply couldn't get it rolled out any wider, it just kept springing back, so I just filled, sealed, and baked it.  Before filling the bread, I cut it in half, served one today and froze the other one for later.  The melted apricot preserves really complement the bread's filling.  Very quick & easy to make and tasty.
