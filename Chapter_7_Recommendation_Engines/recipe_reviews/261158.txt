So happy to find this recipe, it's not an exact match of the restaurants (possibly due to my substitutions) but it is so close, plus it's still absolutely delicious, hence the 5 Stars! My son said it was his favorite meal that I had ever prepared. Minor changes as follows: for chicken I used 1/2 panko & 1/2 italian breadcrumbs along w/ garlic salt, dried basil and parm. I cooked chicken through in pan so I omitted baking it in the oven.  Be sure though that you keep it warm and crispy in the oven b/c you have many more steps that follow. I also subbed heavy cream for half and half and used cheap parm from a can, which I will not do that again - go for the good stuff.  Will definitely make this again, although it is labor intensive - it is so worth it! Thank You for submitting.

Turned out well but took a lot of prep time. I almost doubled the amount of chicken, while keeping the pasta measurements the same, then served the chicken on the side.

Dynamite...add lots of mushrooms and some zucchini and yellow squash (you need more veggies)...make more sauce also...and make lots of chicken for the next meal... this makes a lot of food.  I am definitely adding this to my go-to crowd pleaser file.
