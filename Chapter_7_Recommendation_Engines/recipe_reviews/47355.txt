Great!, I would cook them a little longer then 10mins next time. I like my mustard pickles a little softer then most. I would also add a little more mustard powder because the flavour was a little weak.

It was good but could definitely use some more mustard.

I tried this recipe out...cooked it a little longer (15 minutes) and it turned out nice. I wanted to show off the colour a little more so tossed a diced red pepper into it...might have used green instead, next time around. Wonderful....

After canning, these pickles need to sit for at least a week for the best flavor.

I came in search of a recipe for mustard pickles after my husband asked me to make them. I have canned for many years, but this was not something I was familiar with. Mustard pickles were something his former mother in law made, and he and his children used to eat them with pork chops. I did modify this slightly base on what my family was used to, and used pearl onions rather than sliced onions, and added cauliflower.  I have nothing to compare this recipe with, but have been told by him, and both his girls these are good. My BFF visited from TX this summer and stole a jar to bring home to her family, she has since requested the recipe at the demand of her oldest son.

no changes other than halved the recipe. good but not the thick sauce I was looking for and no mustardy taste despite doubling ground mustard.. taste more like bread and butter so salvageable but not the mustard pickles with cauliflower and pearl onion I was looking for

Good recipe, however would add a bit more dry mustard. A bit weak in flavour.

Wonderful recipe. Halved it because it was my first attempt ever at pickling. Omitted salt for my diet. Loved it. Never going back to store bought. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!
