100% Authentic and absolutely wonderful!  I was born and raised in Charleston, and come from a family of local cooks and this is truly authentic and what the locals recognize as shrimp and grits. The gravy is deeply flavorful, and the shrimp is just done, not overcooked.  You can add a tad of heavy cream towards the end if you want an even more velvety texture in the grits.  This is the real deal and as a born and raised Charleston, I say excellently done.

Outstanding!  The gravy is out of the world.  I served this to someone who'd never heard of shrimp & grits and turned up their nose......Total convert!  They were braggin about the dish to anyone who'd listen.  Wonderful Dish.  You can add more or less water to the gravy til it's your desired thickness.

Excellent recipe! making the roux  dark brown brings out so much flavor! My husband loved it.. and did I we will have this again. Optional tweak of recipe.. layer grits in a 9x13 bake pan.. and then layer the shrimp mixture and top with another layer of grits.. sprinkle with cheese of your choice.. and wham-o  you have shrimp & grits cassarole.. served like a lasagna.

This is a fantastic recipe! I agree with previous reviews that it does need more seasoning. I added Adobo, celery salt, and some cayenne for more flavor and it was fabulous! Also, I recommend that if you put this over grits, use a half and half mixture of water/milk when cooking the grits for a creamy texture. All in all this recipe is delicious!

Tastylicious! Great roux!  Make sure you cook the roux the entire 12 minutes and stir constantly so it doesn't burn.  I tasted at the end and felt like it was missing just a little something. I added a few dashes of Tony Chachere's seasoning...perfect!

These were amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly and the flavors were amazing!  This was my first-time to make a roux and it was really easy.  This was my mom's first-time to eat shrimp n grits and she loved them.  So did my husband who is a shrimp n grits conneisuer - he said this should be our new recipe for when we have company over for dinner!  I served this with the creamy cheesy grits recipe also on this website.

Very, very good.  It was my first time browning a roux and it took a long time, more like 20 minutes to get it dark brown.  When I first started the roux I didn't think it looked thick enough, so I added some more flour and the end result was just about the right thickness.  I used leftover Cajun spiced shrimp and a little shake of Cajun seasoning in the sauce.  The finished product was great.  I served it over Gouda cheese grits.

This may be authentic, but it's still a little blase.  The sauce was good, if a bit bland, and I'd definitely season the grits (if you have chosen grits for your base).  I think it would be spectacular over seasoned potato wedges (it needs a little 'kick'), but then it might lose its traditional-deep-south-appeal.

I'm not terribly familiar with what "real" shrimp and grits are supposed to taste like, but this dish was very very good.

if you use precooked shrimp, it's easy enough to put them in at the very end & just let them heat through.  delicious the second day as well.

I think I might have found a new all-time AR fave!  Wow, this was a spectacular dish, my husband and I absolutely loved it.  I started with really nice rough chopped pepper bacon, and fine diced my veggies.  I did add a stalk of celery to the veggie mix.  I seasoned the veggies and roux with some garlic salt, onion powders, and used Emeril's Bayou Blast.  I also seasoned my shrimp with a cajun blend, Emeril's, and a seasoned salt containg tabasco.  Other than the seasonings and celery, I prepared as written.  This was so delicious, a keeper and a definite do-over.  Thanks so much for sharing, ALRAYNA!

This was SO good!!! Just like a cajun dish. I also seasoned it with Slap ya mama cajun seasoning. I used 6 tbs of flour. I added some corn starch to thicken it because I made more sauce and doubled the chicken broth.  I served it over white rice.

I omitted the bacon. I didn't use chicken stock either. I sautéed the onions and peppers and shrimp, and used the liquid from that to replace the chicken stock. I served this over cheese grits, and everyone loved it and wanted to know how to make. This was a nice delicious meal, that I'll def. be making again one day.

I am not from the southeast so I do not know if this is authentic of not.  What I can tell you is that it was delicious.  It is worth the time to cook the bacon, make the roux and make the gravy.  I served it over some spicy and cheesy grits and will definitely being making this recipe to share with friends.

4-4-2017  ~With the only seasoning here being the pepper and seasoned salt, the flavor in this dish relies strictly on the ingredients themselves – and that worked for me! Some nice-sized shrimp, fresh peppers and onions and good chicken broth, not to mention bacon, made for a very enjoyable dish. Other than replacing the garlic powder with fresh, minced garlic and using red bell pepper in favor of the green, I stuck to the recipe as it was directed and was rewarded with a very flavorful dish, albeit with the simple flavors of its few, fresh ingredients.  Just the way I like it.

I thought it was good, not excellent.  Like some of the other reviewers, I felt it was a little on the bland side, and needed some kind of spice to fill in the blank. Maybe next time I'll add some cajun seasoning.

This was wonderful.  I didn't have green bell pepper so I substituted red bell pepper and I didn't have uncooked bacon so I used the precooked kind and a little canola oil in the pan to pick up the bacon flavor.  Served it over cheese grits.  The whole family loved it and we used a rubber scraper to get the last bit out of the pan!

Very tasty.  At the end, I thought it needed some spice and added some hot sauce and cayenne pepper.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Very Authentic and Delicious!  Used about 1 cup of chicken stock to make the gravy thicker - also added red and yellow pepper in lieu of green.  Serve with some hot sauce on the side and extra green onion.  Thanks for the recipe, a huge hit!

OMW!!! It was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for not having any seasoned salt but I did have tony's which is pretty much the same just spicier so I added a little less of that. It was so delicious I can't wait to eat it again! It is definitely going to be something we make often in our house, even my 2 picky eaters devoured it!

This is the shrimp and grits recipe I was searching for.  It calls for roux, not a can of soup (yuck) to thicken it, and the flavors are right on.  I added some smoked sausage and a stalk of celery, and Tony's instead of seasoned salt.   It's also rather quick and easy to make.  Will definitely put this in the rotation.

Holy smoke this is good! I prepared it exactly as the recipe is written & served it over cheese grits that had been cooked with chicken stock instead of water. It was unbelievably good.  I'm a SC native as well & have NEVER had better Shrimp & Gravy over grits. If I could give this 10 stars I would. YOU MUST TRY THIS!

I'm going to have to agree with a few of the other reviewers in that the gravy was quite bland even tho I did get the roux to a deep rich color. I kept adding in more seasonings along with cayenne to give it some kick and then in the end I added just a dash of Gravy Master. That seemed to do the trick to give it the richness I was looking for. Not a bad recipe at all; it just needs a bit of excitement. Thank you for a good start!

A friend served this to us and we were in heaven.  Being a New Yorker this is a new dish for me.  He served it with grits and it was truly a winner.  I am ready to make it for my company now. Other reviews suggest adding spices, don't.

The recipe was good...not great.  I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar to it because it was a little too salty and slightly bitter at first.  If my kids weren't eating with us I probably would've added some hot sauce as others have suggested.  The gravy was also very thin and I had to add a flour mixture to thicken it up at the end.  I served it over rice for dinner and was actually surprised at my families great response to it. I will definately make it again for them, with the tweaking.

This was a Delicious dish!! I just finished eating :) I did tweak it a little. I added celery, red pepper to liking and 1/8 cayenne pepper, and I sauted the veggies before adding to recipe. It came out amaaazing!! I was skeptical because a couple of the reviews says it was bland, but I did not get that!

Yum!  I have no idea if this was authentic, but it certainly was TASTY!  Even my picky teenage son said is was great.  Followed the directions closely, except had to substitute red bell pepper for green as that was that all I had on hand.  When making the roux (my first time to make a roux) be patient and cook it medium-low as directed, I turned it up and almost scorched it.  Served it with grits and it was excellent.  Definately making this recipe again.

This was really good, as I had 2 lbs. of shrimp I increased the bacon to 5 slices and added 2 ribs of celery to the veggies.  I also used Tony's in place of the seasoned salt as we like the heat of it.  Those were the only changes I made and those were based on personal tastes.  Served over cheesy grits and the entire family enjoyed it.

This was good. All of my kids liked it from the 10 year old to the three year olds. I omitted the green onions. Used already cooked shrimp and old bay seasoning and garlic powder. I have never tasted anything like it and we really liked it.

I followed the recipe exactly and served it over grits. It made more gravy than I thought it would and my husband wished that I had made more grits! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

A very good dish!  I sub'd cajun seasoning for seasoning salt.  I also added celery with a shake of cyan.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  While the dish was pretty amazing and full of flavor, I agree with some others that it lacked a kick.  I'm not quite sure what I would add though.  It was sooo good already that I was afraid to try anything extra and ruin it.  Try it!!

Exquisite, just as written.  I wonder if the people who said this was bland made the same recipe I did.  I definitely will NOT be going out to a restaurant to get shrimp and grits any more.  (Oh, and if you want a little kick, substitute 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning for the seasoning salt.)    Wonderful recipe.  Thanks for sharing this!

Delicious... last year, someone gave me a bag of 'ready to make' shrimp & grits (add your own shrimp of course) from New Orleans - it was ok, but inspired me to look for something more authentic.  Mission accomplished -this recipe is easy, delicious and a crowd pleaser!

Fantastic Shrimp 'n' Gravy I served it with grits and add some crushed red pepper for a kick.  I would use medium shrimp instead of large next time (wanted more shrimp) and add mushrooms.  Otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

Bland, bland, bland.  I also thought that there was too much onion and bell pepper.  I had to add more water to the recipe as well.  I think I will try this recipe again but make a few changes.

Excellent flavor! My oldest who is a very small eater actually went back for seconds. The rice did seem to dilute the flavor of the gravy so next time I will most likely serve it over biscuits.

I was looking for a great comfort food recipe and this was a hit.  My husband loved this.  I served it over Pillsbury biscuits and it was amazing.  Initially I was nervous about making a "roux" but it was painfully easy and it was amazing how quickly I made an amazing gravy that could be a meal with biscuits.  I added lots of green peppers, chopped tomato and onion to give us a good dose of veggies too.

This was very tasty!  I didn't have grits so I used white rice cooked with a bit of soy sauce.  Delicious, thanks!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. And how refreshing it was to be able to fix it just-like-it-says and have it turn out so great! The shrimp were not quite done prior to adding the chicken stock, but like the recipe said, they finally DID cook completely and were exceptionally tender. Only change I'll make next time will be to add a little red Louisiana hot sauce to spice it up some.  I served it over white rice.

I really enjoyed this dish!  Very easy to make!  I did cheat a little and added partially thawed frozen shrimp just before serving. I will definately will make this again!  I served this dish with biscuits but hubby definately was upset that I didnt make it with grits!

Yummy! This was simply delightful. 

The gravy was a little thin but I guess that could be fixed by reducing the amount of chicken broth.

Either way, it was even better on the second day. 

Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Took some previous reviewers tip & added to Cajun seasonings for flavor. I also added some diced celery to complete the trinity.

did add celery and smoked sausage only because my store was down to 10 oz bags of shrimp but I think this recipe as is is amazing. If it's not seasoned enough for you season it at the table.

This was really good! I cooked the roux at medium and it only took about 5 minutes for it to get dark brown with constant stirring. I served it over brown rice and the whole meal from start to finish took 45 minutes to prepare. My husband really liked it too- I sprinkled red pepper flakes on the top along with the chopped green onions and bacon. I will make this again- it's definitely company worthy, but the time spent in preparing it would probably make me hesitate - I like something that can be prepared mostly beforehand.....but all that being said- we will definitely make this again!

Made this tonight as I had all the ingredients on hand. First, I am not from the south, but after reading all of the positive reviews; I knew I had to try.  A little chopping, and my dinner was completed in about 25 minutes.  I must say the flavor was awesome!!! Those who posted negative comments, are those who probably salt everything or use Campbell's soup as a seasoning.  
I cook for large crowds for Dog Field Trials, and I am going to include this as one of my recipes as I generally serve 3 lunches for about 60-80 people.  
As I was cooking i was thinking of other items I could substitute in this if I don't have shrimp.  Thank you for such an awesome, easy, and flexible recipe.

this WAS AMAZING! INSTEAD of chicken broth BC I didn't have any. I used water with 1 tbsp 1/2 of seasoning salt... heat it for 1 minute and replaced. Also I used seafood seasoning as well... Old bay seasoning. soooooooo great!

Just like the picture and tasted fantastic.  I cooked wild and jasmine rice (Wal-Mart organic) and fried the bacon the day before. Also chopped all the other ingredients (adding diced garlic), peeled and deveined the shrimp the day prior to cooking and serving.  Used Kirkland organic no salt seasoning for shrimp. Added salt and pepper to taste prior to serving.  Followed the cooking instructions as stated. My husband loved it. I will cook this again!

Awesome recipe! Not sure why some people said it was bland - it was far from it! The only changes I made were to use 5 pieces of bacon (because - well, because!) and I used half seasoned salt and half Tony's Creole Seasoning for a little extra kick. Definitely a keeper!

I have tried several shrimp n grits recipes that I have found on allrecipes, but this is the first one that I have tried that we all LOVED.  As others have said, make sure to brown the flour well before adding anything else to it.  I also add garlic and some sharp cheddar cheese to my grits as well as plenty of salt. (Sometimes it's worth the extra sodium, just not always).

Delicious as written.  I served it over rice. I have also made it with a little Old Bay spice added to the shrimp to give it a little kick.  Either way, it is a keeper.

This was AMAZINGLY good. The only things I would do different next time is use tailless shrimp just for easier eating, and use more bacon it really adds to the dish.

This was great! Followed the recipe exactly and the flavor is really good. I make this frequently. My boyfriend really liked this as well. I've made quiet a few recipes from here and some recipes he has made fun of me for even attempting but this isn't one of those. It's a favorite of ours. Thanks.

This is my first time rating a recipe, but I can't give this one enough stars. OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is, as my teenager says, "Off the chain"! That gravy is so full of flavor, it could stand on its own. I follow the recipe as stated & served over cheesy grits. The only complaint my kids had was it was too hot to eat as fast as they wanted to. (Hot off the stove) I can't wait 'til my husband gets back in town so he can try it. He's picky, but I know he'll love it. This one is definately on my list of family favorites!  Thank you so much for taking the time to submit this recipe.

This was very easy to make and tasted delicious.  I would have preferred it to be a little more runny, more of a gravy consistency but I could just add more chicken stock next time.  Served over white rice.

Ok...the roux was easy to make. But I agree with some other reviewers that this was too bland. I had to add some Old Bay to it. I guess it just wasn't what I was expecting.

Thanks for a wonderfully easy recipe.  I made this tonight and it is absolutely excellent.  I used one stick of unsalted butter, and only a small pinch of salt with the shrimp.  I made creamy grits using chicken stock and boiled the shrimp tails in the stock, strained the broth for 3.5 cups, add .5 cup of water and 1 cup of half and half for smooth, velvety grits. Delicious for sure.

Very good recipe. Hubby liked it lots. we added cajun seasoning for flavor. we put it over fettucini noodles, we both agree it would be better over rice. I doubled the sauce but now feel that was not necessary as it spread the shrimp too thin. overall, very good

Really good, my husband loved it. I will definately add a little spice next time to give it a kick but it was very good and I know the leftovers will be great! Tip for those who feel it is a little watery... I scooped my shrimp out and boiled the sauce to reduce and thicken it and then dumped the shrimp back in. So they were cooked perfectly!

This was a good recipe. Followed it to the tee, but ended up adding a lil 'kick' to it at the end to suit the spicy tastes of my family.

I loved this recipe.  I made it because I wanted something different, and I use my boyfriend and his brother as my testers and they loved it too.  I did everything execpt for adding the bacon, (we don't eat prok) and I added a squeeze of half a lime, two dashes of hot sauce, and it was very tasty.  Thank you for whom ever created this recipe.

The gravy was very water but tasted good.  I served over rice.  A little more seasoning is need to keep this less bland though.

I think I made it a little too spicy but it had a great taste and was wonderfully simple. I wonder if it could be made a little healthier by using less butter.

Great recipe to try something new, but not a mind blower.  I have never been to Charleson so I have nothing to compare it to.  I like things spicy; next time I am going to add some hotter spices to see what that does to bring out more flavor.

I agree with pretty much everything JDVMD said about this earlier - it's good but not outstanding. I also thought the gravy needed a little bit of tweaking - I added lots of freshly-ground black pepper, and also a generous slosh of homemade hot sauce. I would probably make this again if I had shrimp that needed using up. Thanks!

Simply mouthwatering!  Be sure to only use fresh raw shrimp to start.  A little cayenne or spice is to taste, and the gravy is divine!  Way to go!

I'm not from Charleston, but since we have to give dinner parties for my husbands work, tried it out about a week before and the kids loved it.  It was a success at the dinner party everybody loved it.  We did use fresh shrimp.  Thanks for the post.

Great dish!  Not exactly like Charleston.  Their gravy is more of a cream sauce but still wonderful!!  Family loved it!  Best served over Charleston style grits made with cream.

This review is based on my husband's comments since I cannot eat seafood. He said it was good but not out of this world. Said the sauce needed to be jazzed up somehow so we added cayenne pepper, which helped. From a cooking standpoint, this came together extremely quickly and was a great way to use up some cocktail shrimp.
