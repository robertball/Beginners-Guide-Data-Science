These are fantastic! I was sceptical at first about cookies w/bacon in them, but they came out very great.  I made some changes for health reasons. I replaced the all-purpose flour with 1 cup of whole wheat flour + 1/2 cup of ground oatmeal (just put rolled oats in a food processor until fine). I only used 1/2 cup of unrefined sugar instead of 2/3 cup white sugar and used packaged cubed pancetta instead of crumbled bacon to make this even quicker. I loved the grapenuts addition - gave it a nice crunch!  Overall, a true winner that will go on permanent rotation! The texture reminded me of a scone - great w/coffee!

I didn't think these sounded particularly good, but the rave reviews threw me- I thought my boys might like them.  Unfortunately, the overly sweet cookie with bacon and eggs weren't appealing to them, either.  Also, the crunch of the grape nuts felt odd and out of place. .

Who doesn't LOVE cookies for breakfast?  My kids love grapenuts, but they always leave some in the bowl - so I don't let them have it very often!  This recipe turned out to be a great way to get them to eat a good breakfast - it made about 2 dozen "regular" sized cookies and we ate them all at once!!!

this recipe is a great item for my 2 year old.  Sometimes he isn't a big fan of breakfast, but he will eat these "cookies" everytime.  I use splenda instead of sugar and wheat flour.  They are also good with some cheddar cheese added in.
YUMMY!!

These were very easy and good.  I did use real bacon bits instead of cooking bacon slices.  I think next time i make them i will also cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup instead of 2/3.

These were amazing.  Little bit sweet, little bit savory. Perfect for breakfast. I increased flour by 1/3 cup 'cause I live in the mountains and they were perfected puffed. I added sharp cheddar and my husband raved.  The bacon and grape nuts adds good crunch and texture.

My kids love bacon and eggs but did not care for these.  "What a waste of bacon" was their comment.

I replaced some ingredients to make the bundles and added others so it became a revised version and the kids loved it. I will definately have to make it again!
