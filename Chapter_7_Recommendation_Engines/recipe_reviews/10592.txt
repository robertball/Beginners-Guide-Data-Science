This is the chocolate chip cookie I have been looking for, mind you I do not like cake like cookies. So, if you want a cake like cookie don't bother with this recipe. I feel if you want cake - eat cake.  If you want a cookie then the cookie should taste like a cookie and by that I mean the texture should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside and that is exactly what these cookies deliver.  I reduced the oil by 1/4 cup and   refridgerated the dough for 30 minutes, rolled the dough into walnut sized balls then flattened them slightly.  They baked up perfectly round, flattened, and slightly cracked in appearance.  They looked like they came staight from a bakery.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Just like everyone else, I'm very particular about my chocolate chip cookies. Frankly, I don't care if they're crispy, chewy or cakey so long as they're delicious and baked properly. The debate will go on forever as to which is "the best" as there are so many good recipes--and this is certainly one of them.  I prepared them exactly as the recipe directs, wanting to judge the outcome for myself, and they were perfect. I chilled the dough to firm it a little to avoid spreading, then used a small ice cream scoop and flattened them just slightly--I found they come out of the oven much as they go in. These are perfectly shaped, rounded, beautiful cookies that didn't flatten out--picture perfect. It is not a novel idea to use both oil and butter in cookies, nor is the addition of cream of tartar.  These were NOT greasy as some reviewers mentioned, and the cream of tartar gives them a pleasant, light and sandy texture.  I don't know if this is "the best" chocolate chip cookie out there(because there will NEVER be one) but these sure are darn good!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

If you like cakey cookies, stay away from this recipe.  Although the "typical" chocolate chip cookie lover likes his/her cookies soft and chewy, there are some of us that prefer a crispier cookie.  It is exactly as the name states: Chocolate Chippers.  Why there are so many people that gave it a bad review is beyond me.  I don't try recipes that don't sound like something I would like, so why would they??  Tina, I'm with all those people that think your cookies are great.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!  It seems like every recipe I try for chocolate chip cookies makes soft chewy cookies that just do not satisfy my cravings but this one is perfect.  For those that don't like the dough so greasy, if you reduce the oil to 1/2 cup it will give you a combo of both cripsy and soft cookie.  The taste is WONDERFUL!  Thanks again Tina!!

Overall, this was a dry cookie. I scaled to 24, used canola oil in place of vegetable and only a handful of crushed walnuts. I ran out of time and had to refrigerate the dough overnight before making.  The next day, I let dough come to room temperature before baking.  My first tray was 1 1/2" cookies baked for minimal time stated, bottoms came out too brown.  Next tray was 2 1/2" cookies and these were better.  I placed in an airtight container overnight but no difference in texture.

This is the chocolate chip cookie recipe that I have been looking for, and I to have been baking for years!!  It has very light and crispy texture. I did decrease the oil to 3/4 cup, baking soda to l tsp, and salt to l/2 tsp. I used a hand beater for the creamed mixture; but when adding the dry ingredients, I used a wooden spoon, as suggested by Tina. Bake just until bottoms are golden brown, watch closely.
Thank you so much for sharing Tina!!

sweet, light, and yummy!  these did fall apart a little when trying to get them onto the cookie sheet, but I love crispy chocolate chip cookies, so I didn't mind the dryness of the dough.  like I said....these are REALLY good cookies :)  thanks Tina!

This is now my best cookie recipe!  I use it for the basis of all my cookies and just love it.  I've made some variations but the original is also good.  I subsitute butter shortening for the vegetable oil and butter - I found that makes them softer.  Also I add 2 tablespoons of milk or cream with the eggs.  Thanks for an invaluable recipe!

I too have tried many many chocolate chip cookie recipes and have been baking for years.  These are indeed the very best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made.  They were a huge hit in my house! Thank you for the recipe.

Absolutely excellent choc chippers! I really don't like chewy cookies, and these were crispy, easy to make and perfect. Just some advice: lessen the oil slightly. Thanks for the great recipe, Tina!

I have a recipe I have used for a long time that is very similar to this only I use one tsp of cream of tartar and only one egg.  They are the weirdest cookies ever.  You will love them or hate them.  Half of the people I have made them for don't care for them at all and the other half are absolutely addicted to these. These are not my favorite cookies but once in awhile I really crave them.  They are almost more like a shortbread cookie with chocolate chips and not a traditional chocolate chip cookie at all.

These cookies were good. They melt in your mouth but have a fluffy, powder like cookie.  Also very oily.

I thought these were pretty good.  I only gave it a three b/c I like my cookies chewy and these were not.  They are very crisp and greasy (but not in a bad way).  If you like crispy chocolate chippers, this recipe is for you!

Ialso have been trying different Chocolate Chip recipes and these are very very good. I'm not a novice at baking. I never would have though to use oil and butter. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !! You'll put Mrs Fields out of business with these.

Great recipe that makes tons of cookies.  Did reduce the amount of Cream of Tartar that I used the second time I baked these as I could taste it in the baked cookies when I used all four teaspoons.  They are one of the best crisp chocolate chip cookies recipes I've tried, though!

These weren't bad but they weren't like a normal chocolate chip cookie. More like a butter cookie with chocolate chips.

I think these cookies are FABULOUS -they are different from the standard homemade chocolate chip - I was surprised about the oil, but they turned out delicious!  Crisp and light - very good!

These were really good cookies - they disappeared fast.  I was looking for a chewier cookie, but these were a pretty nice surprise.  Reminiscent of Famous Amos' packaged cookies.

Great recipe!  I finally got bored with the recipes from the backs of bags and the cookbooks in the house, so I decided to find a new one.  This is definitely my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe now.  I sometimes add a bag of butterscotch chips instead of nuts for a different kinda cookie.

I have been in pursuit of the ultimate chocolate chip cookie recipe for some time. I have tried many recipes and this is by far my favorite.  If you like a crispy, awesome tastng chocolate chip cookie, look no further, this is the recipe for you.  I even think this batter can be used many other ways, I will add crushed pecans, no chips and it will be identicle to the famous cookie we are familiar with.  I will also add peanut butter and milk chocolate chips for a different twist on this cookie. Do yourself a favor and try this recipe.

I made as directed, and found these cookies the type I have been searching for: crisp, buttery and crumbly texture.  I chilled the dough ~45 minutes before baking, and (like another reviewer) they are the first chocolate chip cookie that did not go "flat" on me!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Nothing special.  I didn't find them greesy.  I expected flatter cookies.  They are crunchy.  I wouldn't make them again.

I really loved this recipe, there was a great balence of all the flavors.  I noticed some of the reviews had a problem with the cookies being greasy.  Because I did not have vegetable oil I used corn oil and had no grease what so ever, maybe this helped.  I would have to try with veg. oil to compare.  I will always use this  recipe

A week ago I took the top six Chocolate Chip Cookies from this website and made all of them.  I took the cookies to work and my church social, and asked people to tell me which cookies were their favorite.  This recipe was the second favorite, though it was an extremely close second.  I did substitute applesauce for the oil, and because of that I had to add an extra cup of flour.  Everyone loved their moistness and texture.

These are absolutely delicious! I wasn't sure about them when I was making them but they turned out wonderful! These are a keeper! I baked half one night and then refrigerated them until the next night. They were great!

This is the best chocolate chip recipe I've ever had too!  The amount of cream of tartar is fine, just make sure it is not lumpy when you add it to the recipe.

So good that I had 4 yesterday! :)  But I made them with egg substitute and splenda baking mix.  A little healthier and still great tasting!

My family did not like the texture, they seemed more like peanutbutter cookies in consistancy.  Too much tartar for us too. Thanks though for the new idea

These were definitely NOT our favorites.  We prefer a denser cookier--one you can sink your teeth into.  These ended up being too light and airy for our taste.  Won't try these again. . .

Sorry, but while these cookies did melt in my mouth, they weren't substantial enough for me to consider them among the "best."  I prefer a chewier chocolate chip cookie.  Also, the cup of vegetable oil was a health turn-off.

THESE COOKIES ARE ABOUT THE BEST I HAVE TASTED SO FAR. I DID CUT DOWN ON THE CREAM OF TARTER BY 1 TSP. A SECOND CHANGE I MADE TO THE RECIPE WAS TO REPLACE 1 CUP OF ALL PURPOSE FLOUR FOR
1 CUP WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR. I SAY THESE ARE VERY MUCH WORHTH MAKING. THANK YOU TINA..

These are excellent. I was a little leary because it used oil. I used fructose instead of sugar and Splenda brown sugar replacement. The texture was crisp and flavor was great. Will make again!

These cookies are FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!  I loved them as did my children! :)  Perfectly crispy edges, wonderfully buttery and chewy center.  I would add about 1/2 cup more chocolate chips next time, but so good!! The dough could stand on its own :)
Thank you!!

These are very good and I even baked them a bit too long.  I like softer, cakey choc chip cookies, but my husband does not and these are very good.  I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 margarine, cut down on the oil to 2/3 C., added 2T of 1/2 and 1/2 and used a combo of semi and milk choc chips. There is a bit of a taste from the cream of tartar in them so I may try using a bit less next time, but I will make these again.  If you like a crispier cookie definitely try these!
