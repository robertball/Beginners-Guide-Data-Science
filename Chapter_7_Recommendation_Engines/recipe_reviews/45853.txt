This is a great pudding but 2 tsps of baking soda is too much.  Hence the reason it hits the top of the tin and also the taste of the baking soda is overpowering.   1 tsp. is adequate and I have even made it with 1/2 tsp. Hope this is helpful.

Yum! I recently bought a similar pudding at a Craft show and was hooked! This recipe used the same ingredients listed on the label of the one I bought and it turned out great! I don't have a steamer mold so I just used a loaf pan covered tightly with aluminium foil. Thanks for the recipe.. it will surely be a tradition in our family from now on!

This recipe has been in my family for over 50 years -- every year it is a given at Christmas or Thanksgiving meal.  This is the first time I have ever seen the recipe in print other than my own!! It makes a beautiful presentation on china plate with holly and cranberries around.

This is GREAT!.  The pudding itself is tart, but when served  with the sauce it is perfectly balanced.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to the sauce.  Make sure to grease the mold well, and don't forget the lid.  I didn't grease my lid, and when the pudding puffed up it stuck.  Then again, I doubled the recipe because it didn't look like it would make enough to fill my mold.  I didn't expect it to puff as much as it did.  I guess it's all that baking soda. :)  Once again, WONDERFUL.  This will be a part of my holiday table from now on!

This is a great Christmas pudding (in the British sense of a heavy, steamed cake, not in the American sense of a custard-y treat).   It's tart, heavy, and molasses-y - the cranberries make a nice contrast to the heavy batter and IMHO are a big improvement on plum or raisin puddings.  I don't have a steamer mold, so I used a greased ring mold, covered with tinfoil.

If you like molasses you'll like this pudding.  I used the mildest I could buy and sill didn't like it very much.  I gave it a 3 rating because the sauce is GREAT.  I'll find another steamed pudding to use it on.  Note:  1 tsp of soda was plenty.

I'm so pleased to have found this recipe. First, I'd like to say I've never made a steamed pudding of any kind before and was looking forward to trying something like this. I have imagined a bite of the pudding in "Scrooge" that sounds so delectable to the anticipation of the "Cratchit family" in story. I followed this recipe precisely...even down to the whole cranberries and am I ever glad I did. Perfect, but you must have the warm sauce to pour over. This may appeal to perhaps a more grown-up palate, but maybe not though. * Warning this is very rich and I can see why people make it for the holidays (only) as a special treat.

1st: thank you! 2nd: As a guy pushing 60, a recipe in the fam for 50 years is not something "old!". Mom would make this with a coffee can for the mold, and it was my favorite thing to eat on Christmas. I thought she was doing magic

I cut back on the baking soda (1 &1/2 TBS) and I used a Nordic Ware pull apart pan (snowflake design) and my turkey roasting pan as the steamer. Both covered with foil.

It was DONE in 1 hour (I probably could have pulled it at 45 mins.) I have to admit that I depended on the Teflon coating more than I should have, next time, unsalted butter, thick coating. It's Okay for us, but... I'm also thinking a silicon form would work well for the release...

Mom's coming over and I can't wait to surprise her! Merry Christmas memories.

Super easy to make. I do agree that the baking soda seems a bit high. I tasted a tiny piece and got the hint of baking soda flavour. Haven't had the chance to serve it yet so will update my review if it changes once I serve with the sauce. 
Love steamed puddings though

I made a lot of changes! I used wild dry berries mix along with candied dry cherries, and cut fresh cranberries in half as another person suggested. I put them into a ziplock bag, and added a bit of brandy, and allowed it to saturate about a week. 

I also added some finely chopped pecans and then made the rest according to the recipe. I do not have any issue with the baking soda as someone said they did, and molasses is a traditional sweetener of Christmas cookies, so that was just fine tasting too. 

The time was fine, and what I had was a 7 cup mold from Williams Sonoma which is non-stick, and I used butter to coat it before putting the batter inside. At first it did not want to tip out of the mold when done, so I just did like a cake and gently used a butter knife slowly around it to loosen. Then it plopped right out! It did not break either, nor crumble. 

I do have a steamer insert for a pan, but with such a tall mold no way a lid would fit! So, I improvised. I happened to have another pan, not even the same brand, and it just happened that it fit right on top and the handle helped hold it on. Luck of the Irish. Since steam rises, it went up, and then dripped bits of condensation onto the stove out of the bigger upper pan. Another site suggested to ensure the water level is about 1/2 the way up your mold, to be sure it cooks.

This is great pudding, but instead of heavy cream, I like using sour cream.  Creates a unique taste that grandma is sure to love!  -- Luke

On of my favorites.  Even my teen boys & hubby like it.  Skip the cream sauce if you are watching calories.  A little low cal butter/marg does the trick.   Enjoy!

Easy to make and doesn't require a lot of ingredients but is very satisfying, especially with the sauce.
I usually cook mine a little bit longer about 1h45m but i use a heavier bowl.

Were I to make this, I'd replace the Soda with powder, or make sure boiling water was involved, ALSO add spices such as ginger, cinnamon, a small amount of cloves to give this 2 dimensional cake some depth - Christmas Pudding is a spicy fruity mixture and molasses doesn't really enter into it.  Use it as a jumping off point to get creative- Orange rind and juice with those cranberries

Delicious though cranberries were a bit shocking to the taste buds at times.  Walnuts would be good in this. I served it with a bourbon hard sauce.  I love that it l not so sweet and that is controllable with the amount of sauce added to your plate.

I make this for our big Christmas dinner every year and it never fails to please. I don't make any changes, it always comes out just about perfect. I might try the sauce with sour cream as someone else suggested, just for a different spin. Sounds tasty! This is by far, our favorite holiday recipe, just like the one my mother made when I was a kid.

The recipe I have used since I was a child also called for 3/4 cup of raisins. This is one of my favorite things to eat but one word of caution. Don't try to eat the pudding without the sauce or you will definitely be turned off by it.

This has been my family recipe for 50 years too!  If you want to have flaming pudding, be sure the pudding is warm or the brandy won't flame.  As I recall, you can pour it on the warm pudding and light it, or put it in a long-handled spoon or ladle, light, and pour onto the pudding flaming.  We always cut the cranberries in half (easier to cut if frozen).  I steamed it in the top half of my double boiler (stainless) with aluminum foil tightly wrapped on top.  I then put that into a large covered dutch oven pan with the water.

Christmas in your mouth!! MUST cut the baking soda in half tho, otherwise that’s all you taste.  I made 2.5 batches to fill a tall solid mold and a smaller hollow-middle mold.  Decorated with candied lemon slices and sugar work. For flavor depth I added bourbon and whiskey to the hard sauce, complementing the rich molasses cranberry.  Rave reviews all around! This is my go-to for traditional Christmas dessert.

Delicious! I had never made a steamed pudding before and this one was easy and turned out wonderfully!
