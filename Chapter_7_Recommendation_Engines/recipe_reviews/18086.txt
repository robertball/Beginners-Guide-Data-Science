The bread was very tasty and easy to make.  The directions, however needed a little revamping--I added 2 tsp baking soda- the reciped never mentioned how much to add..and I also mixed the egg mixture in a separate bowl and then added the dry ingredients to it.  The recipe will make 3 medium loaves.

This bread is great! I added chopped dates to make it special, and also  put 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Everyone who has tried it loves it! Note- make sure you add baking powder or it will not rise- I added 2 teaspoons for each batch, and some extra cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice too.

Yummy! Wonderful flavor (i used the canned pumpkin that already has the spices in it) plus i include the called for cinnamon.Nice & moist. Watch the cooking time, tho, it needs more than an hour. i baked mine 1 hr & 20 min. Would definately make this often.

It was great!  My husband and kids couldn't wait for it to cool down before finishing a whole loaf.  Our UPS man came by 3 times to ask for more!

This is the "best ever" pumpkin bread. The texture is excellent and the men at the mill where my husband works can't get enough of it. I have sent many copies of the recipe to work with him. And honey if a man wants the recipe... it's good cookin.
I can't always find coconut pudding but have substituted other flavors, the cheesecake instant pudding is great! I too have to bake it longer, about 80 minutes or so.

My brother has been SOOOO picky all of our lives.  He ate TWO loaves of this at Thanksgiving and took the left overs home.  He didn't even want dessert, he just ate pumpkin bread.  Thanks.

Everyone I make this for loves it soooooo much. This is my daughter's all time favorite thing that I make, ever since she was 2 she asks me to make this all the time. I change a few things that I think make it taste better and make it healthier. I use half whole wheat flour, and instead of coconut cream pudding mix I use 1 sugar free vanilla mix, and 1 sugar free butterscotch mix, also use half a cup of oil and half a cup of applesauce, I double the cinnamon, and I add a tsp of nutmeg, and I only use 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups, also I use 3 whole eggs and 2 egg whites and I whip them for about a minute with an electric mixer before adding to the batter. It also takes 15-20 minutes longer than the recipe says to cook.
I know it is a lot of changes but it tastes amazing!

I also had to change a few things - added 1tsp of baking soda, 1tsp of baking powder, plus one cup of brown sugar and reduced the white sugar to 1cup.  Usually, I just throw in a little cinnamin, nutmeg, and ginger - but I don't measure.  Pumpkin pie spice would be great too!  My husband and I both really hate coconut, but it really can't be tasted in this recipe.  The first time I made it with one box (rather than 2), and it was superb!  Even with the full 2 boxes, it changes the flavor, but nothing is distinctly coconut - just super moist!    Great to eat right out of the oven or frozen for later!

My mom gave me this recipe years ago.  Many of my friends have made it too and when I make it for work, they always want the recipe.  I love this and so do my picky kids.  I have found that depending on the weather and the freshness of ingredients that sometimes it doesn't rise as well.  It has always been a huge hit at all family gatherings.

We love pumpkin bread and with a few revisions of our own, this recipe was a serious hit! We made 8 loaves and took to neighbors.  OUR VERSION: we replaced the 1 1/2 Cup of oil with two ripe bananas mashed and 1/2 cup of real butter softened.  The loaves were beautiful, moist and loved by all!  I added chopped walnuts to some for the people who love nuts it made this delicious bread even better!  This recipe is a keeper.   NOTE: We tried one batch with butterscotch pudding, 3/4 cup coconut, walnuts and butterscotch chips- It was amazing too!

This recipe is awesome. I made it to go along with our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! The coconut pudding is wonderful. There's just a hint of the taste in there - definitely not overpowering. You need to try it before switching to vanilla pudding. I did follow some other reviewer's suggestions and added 2 tsp. of the baking powder. Also substituted half of the flour with whole wheat. The bread is very moist so I did cut down on the oil to just one cup. Added plenty of cinnamon and a little nutmeg for a tiny extra spice...it was fabulous. I even impressed my mother-in-law who is a great cook!

I think the description at the top, "Think of this as pumpkin pie in sweet bread form" describes it best.  If you are expecting regular pumpkin bread texture, you may want to keep searching.  However, this is SO moist!  And if you bite into it remembering that it has a pumpkin pie consistency, you will love it.  I personally think it could have used a bit more cinnamon and possibly other spices like cloves, nutmeg, etc.  So next time I make this, I would probably add more spices and use vanilla instead of coconut pudding.

I made this in mini loaves and my kids devoured them.  My personal opinion is that it tastes better the next day.

I love this recipe and make it a few times every fall. I always substitute the oil for applesauce, the white flour with whole wheat flour, and the sugar with splenda. I also use more baking soda to help it rise. It turns out almost exactly the same but has way fewer calories and it makes it very healthy. My three year old gobbles it up!! So do all my friends!

I've been making this recipe now for about 4 years. It is a favorite here in our house. I make it a lot for playgroup too and always get asked for the recipe.  Sometimes I use 1 coconut and 1 vanilla pudding, but it is excellent as is. I'd give this 90 stars if that was an option!

Awesome sweet bread! I've made this in a bundt pan. Bake for 1 hour + 15 minutes. After it has cooled, you can drizzle with a glaze of 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 Tbl butter, 2-3 Tbl milk. To reduce fat and maintain the moist texture, I cut the oil in half and replaced with natural applesauce. I've also added pumpkin pie spice. Sometimes I add almond extract.
To cut this in half to make one loaf try:
1/3 cup oil
1/3 cup natural applesauce
2 large eggs
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup flour
1 cup sugar
1 box (3 1/2 oz) coconut cream pudding
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1 tsp almond extract

Excellent recipe!  I will use this for pumpkin bread from now on.  I couldn't find the coconut pudding (will keep looking) so I used a box of vanilla and a box of lemon (had them on hand).  Next time I may try just one cup of oil.  It was so moist, I almost couldn't get it firm enough, even with longer cooking time, and my fingers are very greasy after having a piece.  Great flavor!  Thanks Corwynn!

This bread is great!  I made one loaf and 12 muffins with my batch.  I did add the 2 tsp. or baking powder and I could only find the non-instant pudding mix, but it didn't seem to affect the product.  SOOO super moist and flavorful!!!

This recipe is very good!! My only reccomendation is using applesauce instead of oil. The first time I made it i used the amount of oil the recipe called for and it was way too oily.

So good!  I did as others suggested: double baking soda, cut oil to 1 cup, and a few sprinkles of nutmeg (next time I'll add a bit more)then I baked them in those Reynolds fun shapes for 15 minutes, wrapped them up, and put them with my Christmas baskets.  Yum-my!

I loved this recipe. I did cut down on the oil a bit (to one cup) and used vanilla pudding instead but it still came out delicious. A word of caution, this has more of a pumpkin pie consistency than a bread consistency (my husband complained a bit but I thought it was great!)

I wanted to like this recipe, I really did--but after TWO hours in the oven, there are still raw bits in the center. I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding a pinch of pumpkin pie spice. Very disappointing.

I always get a great reception from this recipe, and I've had several people ask for it. It's easy to make and a perfect seasonal gift. But really, who wants to wait for the season to taste this pumpkin deliciousness? :-) My older sister can't even wait for it to cool out of the oven to take a slice.

I made this and let me tell you its delicious!!! *** But the only thing I would do next time is use two VANILLA pudding mix instead of the banana I used. It can out to much like banana bread in taste. I also took some advise from another review and put brown sugar in too, I put 1 and 1/2 cups of white sugar and then 1/2 cup brown sugar for 20 servings.***

This pumpkin bread was absolutely the best I have ever had.  Moist, sweet, DELICIOUS!!!!!  As per previous reviews, I also made some changes to this recipe.  I used 1 C white and 1C brown sugar, used 1 pack coconut and 1 pack cheesecake instant pudding, added 2 t baking powder, and 2 t pumpkin pie spice.  It took about 1 hr 15 minutes to bake and it made 3 disposable-loaf-pan sized loaves.  You cannot taste the coconut (for those of you who were turned off by it) but the pudding flavor sweetens the bread so it really does taste like pumpkin pie in sweet bread form, just as the recipe says.  Give this bread a try if you are looking for a sweet pumpkin bread...it is so moist and scrumptous.  But be prepared...it's addictive!!!!

Great pumpkin bread!! I followed some of the other suggestions and added 2 teaspoons of baking powder. I also reduced the amount of oil that I added to the mix. My oven's not the greatest so I had to bake and extra 15 minutes too. The bread came out nice and moist and delicious!! I would totally recomend this to everyone!!

This was the best dessert ever! my whole family loved it! one of my friends was allergic to coconut so i used vanilla pudding instead and it was just as great! ive made this about 7 times! I cook it about 15 min more because it came out a little raw in the middle. THIS IS AMAZING!

This was very good bread. even better when cooled. I followed the advice of some of the reviews but I used all applesauce & no oil at all. I also used 1 frence vanilla pudding & 1 sugar free vanilla pudding insted of coconut. It was great. And my husband who likes nothing "low fat" could not even tell the difference. It was VERY moist though so if you like a firm bread consistancy this might not be the one for you.

This recipe is very good but with a few changes it can be a little healthier. I reduced the oil to one cup and use canola instead of vegetable oil. Canola has lots of mono and poylunsaturated fats that are better for you. Also, I used egg beaters instead of regular eggs. Also add 2 1/4 cups pumpkin instead of 2 cups and a little more cinnamon. We also used vanilla pudding instead of coconut and it is still delicious. It is by no means a lowfat snack but small changes can make a difference. Your family won't be able to tell the difference! I promise!

This was probably the best pumpkin bread I have ever made. My 13 yr old son just loved it and this morning it was the first thing he asked for breakfast! The only thing I did differently was because I couldn't find coconut cream pudding mix, I used Vanilla pudding mix and threw in about 3/4 cup coconut and it turned out great. Oh and the other thing I did differently was I read the mixing directions wrong and mixed everything together at once...don't know if that made a difference or not. I will make this again and maybe add Craisins or something.

i did as other reviewers suggested: added nutmeg, cut the oil to 1c, and upped the baking soda.

i used the recipe to make muffins rather than loaves and coated them with cream cheese frosting- they came out great! i love the hint of coconut flavor.

Simply wonderful! I reduced the oil to just a cup, and was still plently moist (next time I think I will try half applesauce & half oil). Great recipe!

Good recipe.  Modified it a bit- added allspice and nutmeg and used half the oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 c. all purpose flour and 1 c wheat flour.  Tastes great, my boyfriend loves it.  Only slight complaint is that it leaves your fingers pretty greasy...not sure if it's because I modified or not.  Thanks for the recipe.

Moist and perfect! Fantastic as cupcakes, just reduce the bake time. If you can't find coconut cream instant pudding mix, vanilla is a solid substitute. Best served warm, right out of the oven with a pat of butter on top.

I make this every year and my brother begs me to make it for him the second fall rolls around. I've noticed he doesn't eat pumpkin bread at parties, but when I make this pumpkin bread he hoards it. It's sweeter, richer and more flavorful than most pumpkin bread recipes.

This will be my go to pumpkin bread. I used fresh pumpkin that was not pureed and I did not use the extra 1/4 cup of oil. I added a half more cup of pumpkin instead. It turned out really moist and wonderful. Also, I did not have coconut pudding mix so I used vanilla instead.

This is a very moist yummy recipe.  I found that there is a slight after-taste and I think it is from the coconut pudding mix.  Next time I'll try a vanilla pudding mix.  I will also only use 1 cup of veg. oil next time. I will make it again :-)

SO DELISH!  It's a cross between cake, brownies, and bread.  I couldn't taste the pumpkin, but probably because I used chocolate pudding instead of coconut since that's all I had on hand.  I will make this over and over again...

This is a family favorite.  For the last 3 Christmases I've quadrupled the recipe and made 20 mini loaves to take to friends and family.  It's becoming a family tradition!  The recipe is just perfect as is.

I added the baking powder and my bread still did not rise very much.  I substituted 1/2 c. unsweetened apple sauce for 1/2 c. of oil and only used 1/2 c. oil for a total of 1 cup.  Used 1 cup splenda and 1 cup sugar.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It has a good flavor but is VERY dense and EXTREMELY moist - which is not a bad thing.  I have made other pumpkin bread that I like better so probably will not make this again.

This recipe was pretty good... The coconut adds an interesting texture, i thought i would taste the coconut more, so i was pleasently surprised. I forgot that other people said to add in some baking powder and I hadn't... And they still rose, just not by much.

Very good, very moist, and dense. However, I might double the recipe, but use three boxes of pudding... Make them for christmas presents. It was a little bit TOO dense and moist for me. My boyfriend really likes it though.

This recipe got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. People have been asking for the recipe left and right. I did not have coconut cream pudding so I used vanilla instead and I replaced the cinnamon with 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice. An Awesome recipe!

This was so moist and delicious. I'll definately make it again.  I modified it a bit by adding cinnamon, nutmeg, and 2t baking powder - also, baked for 1 hour 30 minutes.

i have to say I was very excited to finally bake this bread!! I've been craving it and this recipe surely does not let down! I did read the other reviews and added 1 more tsp of baking soda and some nutmeg and allspice. Also baked a little longer. I think the texture is perfect-just what pumpkin bread should be! Definately a great recipe!

Not bad, but needed more spice. I will probably make this again, and when I do, I will use a lot more spice. I liked the almost custard-like texture to the bread, but those who tried the bread thought it was a little bland. Somehow, it still managed to disappear within a few days.

Created this confection for the second time with the same results - FABULOUS! I have tweaked it for a bit more of a health kick. 1. Replaced half the flour with whole wheat. 2. Threw in about 1 Tablespoon of Flax Seed meal 3.Used 1 Cup organic virgin coconut oil in place of vegetable oil. 4. Added more spices (Cinnamon, cloves & nutmeg). 5. Folded in 1/4 Cup shredded coconut!

My family is totally in love with this recipe.  I changed the coconut pudding to vanilla, since no one in my family likes coconut.  I also upped the cooking time to 1 hour 15 minutes.  Other than that, it's a HUGE hit!!

This is very yummy.  The pudding gives it a nice flavor, not overwhelming, and an almost 'creamy' texture.  Mine took longer to bake (1 hour, 15 min), but everyone's oven is different.  I will definitely make it again.  Another winner from Corwynn for my recipe box!  Thanks Corwynn!

I made the recipe exactly except I used French vanilla pudding instead of coconut and 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. It made 3 loaves. Best pumpkin bread ever. I brought one loaf to work and everyone loved it.

I used this recipe to make muffins. The recipe made a batch of 24 muffins, and they turned out great and were baked in a little over half an hour. I should have read some of the other reviews because I would have used a little less oil, and a little more cinnamon and other spices, but other than that they were great, and I will definitely make them again.

I only had one package of vanilla pudding at the house so that's what I used and I love spices so I added some extra cinnamon and a little pumpkin pie spice and this is AMAZING! This will be my go to recipe from now. My kids (13,4,2) love them as well. I think next time I will try adding some walnuts too. Also, I made one good sized loaf and 18 muffins!

Have made this recipe many times and there is always at least one request for the recipe.  I noticed that previous reviews have had trouble finding coconut cream pudding and substitute other flavors.  I too have done this with french vanilla pudding, but I add shredded coconut to keep some of that flavor.

Was trying recipes to make for a brunch baby shower and this caught my eye.  Glad I tried it first.  It's not really a bread - it tastes like pumpkin pie with a bread type crust around it. I had to bake it for an hour and a half before I could get a clean toothpick.  Flavor was good but just not what I had in mind for pumpkin bread.  I used pumpkin instant pudding because that's what I had on had.

I halved this recipe and it really is melt-in-your-mouth.  Four stars because I'd like it a little more bread-like.  I used banana cream pudding mix instead of coconut cream, since the latter was nowhere to be found in the store.  The flavor wasn't noticeable, but it really made the texture silky in the end product.

I was hesitant to make because of coconut pudding but decided to halve the recipe and make just one loaf. I have a convection oven and kept checking and checking, but the bread never seemed to fulle cook in the middle, but started to really brown on outside. Almost to the point of being burnt. I finally just took it out after almost two hours. I thought it was ruined. But after allowing to cool, the bread had a "crust"  on outside and was just like pumpkin pie in the middle. The taste was good, but consistency was a little weird.

This was sooo good. I only had one box of instant banana pudding on hand so thats what i used.  I also added the suggested baking powder, and baked it 15 minutes longer.  I will definitely make this again.  **UPDATE I did make it again and continue to play with the add-ins although it is delicious as is.  I also have used wheat flour which needs more pumpkin puree to stay moist, flax seeds, different nuts, oatmeal. Ive even made a chocolate version. This is still my go to recipe for the base.

The best recipe i've ever used. Literally melts in your mouth. I had to cook for a little longer than the specified time, but soo worth it. I also added a few extra spices to give it a bit more flavor.

This was a moist bread but a little bland in comparison to other pumpkin breads that I have made, although it may be because I had to use vanilla pudding since I didn't have coconut pudding on hand.  Next time I will try the recipe exactly and hopefully it will be a 5-star!

My husband and 2 1/2 year old son loved this bread. They wanted a slice after every meal for three days. It is very moist. Personally, I like my bread with more spice and might try different puddings, but overall well-received.

This bread was very moist and melted in my mouth. I love the subtle coconut flavor.

Me and my mom have been making this recipe every Christmas for years and it's wonderful, we use vanilla pudding instead of coconut and the flavors blend together much better.

This is wonderful!  It is incredibly moist and freezes well.  I couldn't find the coconut pudding mix but used bananna instead and it was great.  My husband has requested that next time I add nuts.

Didn’t have baking soda or coconut pudding.  I used 1/2 self rising flour & also added a ts of baking powder.  I used 1 chocolate & 1 vanilla pudding.  I also beat the eggs before combining.  I added a second ts of cinnamon as well.  I greased 12 large muffin cups and it took about 45 minutes to cook.  PURE DELICIOUSNESS!  I would add a little more spice next time...

This is a great recipe., but you can make it more healthy with a few tweaks.  This recipe, as written, is more like a cake and is just too sweet for my family.   I cut down on the sugar and fat, only a cup of each, and only three eggs.  Plus, I used only one box of pudding mix.  I used a whole wheat finely-milled pastry flour to boost the nutrients.  Even with lower sugars and fats, this recipe is full of flavor and my family loved it!

I love this recipe. I did change a few things,  but use this recipe as a base. I've made it several times. I've made it into 2 loaves and/or  4 mini loaves. I use 1 3/4 cups brown sugar instead of white, but add about a 1/4 to 1/2  cup extra flour and I add a lil extra pumpkin. I also add more cinnamon and add ginger and sometimes nutmeg. I am really glad I came across this recipe. I still want to try it with Cheesecake pudding instead of coconut, but I haven't been able to find it at the stores I shop at. I think everyone should try this recipe at least once. It does need to bake longer than an hour. The mini loaves took about 50 - 60 mins and the regular loaf pans took close to 1 hour and 20 mins. I do mix the dry and wet ingredients in separate bowls before gently mixing the flour mixture into the the pumpkin/egg mixture. I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I think the instructions need to be a lil more clear and because it takes longer to bake than stated.  Also I want to say that, just because I tweaked the recipe to fit my taste, doesn't mean it's not already perfect. Everyone has there own ideas of yummy or good and I changed it to suit my idea of this. Thank u to the person who originally posted this recipe, it has been greatly appreciated.

Fantastic pumpkin bread! I tried this recipe and I'm going to use it every year to make pumpkin bread for family gatherings. It is so very moist and tasty and easy to make. I love the coconut in this - it adds some wonderful flavor, a little change to the usual pumpkin bread. I think it is a fabulous recipe but I did have to cook these loaves 15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for before it was completely set. But the bread turned out perfect and my kids love it! Maybe next time I'll consider adding in raisins or nuts to see how that works...
