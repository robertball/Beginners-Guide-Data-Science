Fabulous recipe, Chef! This is the way fried chicken should be made. I had to make acidified buttermilk (1 tablespoon of lemon juice per 1 cup of milk, allow to curdle for 10 minutes), but the preparation, to me, was effortless. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough oil for my dutch oven, so I used my skillet, turn the chicken over once after 10 minutes, cooking for 25 minutes total. Also I only had corn oil. I'll try peanut oil next time. Thanks again!

This was not a difficult recipe. I did use boneless chicken and followed everything else. I worked fine. This is not the BEST fried chicken I have had, but it was tasty and nice and crispy. I did not need 2 cups of buttermilk, so just pour in as much as you need to cover the chicken good. The rest of the ingredients I used the same. I used about 2 inches of oil to fry in and let it get good and brown.

This is absolutely the best fried chicken recipe ever! The outside is crispy & the meat is moist & tender. I made it exactly as directed except used boneless, skinless breasts, cut into thirds. My husband wants me to make this again (like tomorrow) & I'm happy to obilige.  Thank you for this terrific recipe!

LOVE this recipe, my whole family love it. I made little bit healthier by put this chicken in the oil for 3 minutes or until little bit brown on the outside and put the chicken in 350 F oven for 30 - 40 minutes or until the chicken all cooked.

I like this recipe when I saw the video.  However, when I saw the nutritional information, I groaned.  Of course, I knew fried chicken was high fat, but seeing it print detered me from making it.   I decided to use the ingredients and make oven fried chicken.   I use all the ingredients except the oil.   After coating the chicken with the seasoned flour, I sprayed it with PAM.   I used a non stick baking pan.  The results were wonderful!!

Really great after alterations. I can say with confidence that this would not have been as good without the changes. I doubled all the spices and seasonings (except salt, which I kept the same). The end result was perfectly flavorful, which to me means that it would have been bland with the written amounts. Also, I cooked the chicken between 275 and 300 degrees, and they were perfectly brown at 19 minutes cook time. The breasts were slightly dry, they should have been taken out earlier. The dark pieces were amazing, though.

Oh, yes!  truely scumpious, wonderful herb blend.  I did brown, then put on rack as directed.  However, I put the chicken in a 325 degree oven with the rack over a lipped cookie sheet and baked for 1/2 hour instead of the second frying.  It removed a lot of the grease.  Still crispy the next day, every bit as good as Day 1.  This will be a go to recipe for me.

I followed the directions exactly, except I used my heavy electric skillet.  Perfect!  My husband said it was the best fried chicken he had ever had!  It was incredibly moist and  flavorfull with really crispy crust.

Incredible...and easy! We watched the video and I saw how easy it was and decided to make it. I used a deep fryer and put the chicken in for 20 minutes. I didn't have the white pepper so I skipped that one ingredient, and it was still amazing. It was so moist that you could see the liquid in the chicken as you cut it open. Thank you for sharing!

It marinates long, but is well worth the wait. So succulent and moist on the inside and crispy on the outside, my family demanded that I make it for second day running! The blend of spices is also very, very nice. Except next time I'll omit oregano.

Great!! Made this tonight as a dry run for a Senior Luncheon I am doing this Friday in San Francisco. Wow!!! This is really good chicken and fairly easy to make (unless you don't like getting your fingers globby with Buttermilk and Breading mixture, which in that case you shouldn't cook LOL). Am serving with Syrian Green Beans from this site and Greek Salad also from this site, along with rice and gravy. one senior told me I had earned my place in Heaven chicken was so good.

Very crispy and delicious IF you double the flour seasonings.  I also added 1 teaspoon of bouquet garni as well as 1 teaspoon of chile powder (we like spice).  Next time I will try ancho or chipotle chili powder.  Let the coated chicken set for a few minutes so the flour coating was wet and pasty looking.  Used a deep fryer with the temp at 315-320F cooking the chicken between 13-15minutes in two batches as to not crowd the chicken.  Placed on a wire rack in a jelly roll pan and let rest in a 325F oven for about 10 minutes.  Very good and crispy!

It is worth marinating the chicken overnight, as the flavors are amazing! I used whole milk and lemon juice as a subsitute for buttermilk. It's best not to use yogurt as a marinate in this recipe. You will not get the same results. I also used a tall pot to fry the chicken, so I did not have to turn it. 20 minutes and it was done!  This was really good fried chicken!  Now I have to figure out how to get rid of the grease smell from my kitchen!

Took this fried chicken to a family 4th of July camping trip. Cooked up a huge bath of thighs and legs. Cooked in peanut oil made a big difference I believe, and adjusted the spices for the amount of chicken I had. When the grandkid's saw the big bowl of fried chicken they asked, " Who brought the Kentucky Fried Chicken" lol. Gone in a few hours, Granddaughter requesting I make for her birthday. I'd say a winner.

Absolutely delicious!  I marinated my chicken for about 8 hours and thought maybe the heat could have been a bit lower as it browned a bit too quickly, but YUM!  This is just the best, crispiest, fried chicken ever!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is my go to fried chicken recipe. Has made me quite famous in town (in a very modest, fried chicken lover kind of way). I usually add a bit more salt because, well, fried chicken should have more salt. One of the rare times I mess with one of Chef John's recipes.

i did this by the exact recipe and it was good. ive tweaked it a bit to my tastes with a simpler spice list including chili power, and omitting some of the other spices, while doubling them all but flour, and it is great. i strongly suggest using a plugin fryer or at least an oil thermometer in heavy, thick pan (dutch oven as stated) as the chicken will start looking burnt on the outside before it done inside if the oil gets too hot. oil temp is the key to getting this chicken to a 'golden brown delicious' color AND cooked to temp inside. brown not tan. its not a fast food chicken(kfc)color. it is a good idea to cut the breasts in half also. i love fried chicken and Chef John did us a favor by putting this recipe out there. best one I've tried and I've tried a dozen or so looking for that one good one. i especially like not having to use an egg wash part, as it is a messy step, and its not really needed in my opinion. thanks chef!

3-1/2 stars. Can not get buttermilk in Mexico so I subbed with yogurt. Chicken was quite moist and tender. But the flavor was not what I had hoped. I did add a few more spices but was not totally happy with the flavor. Needs to be fried at a lower temp as the breading browned too much and the chicken was not cooked through.

If you are using an electric fryer set the temperature to 305 and cook according to the recipe. These fryers stay much hotter than an dutch oven and your chicken will come out black if you fry it for 20+ mins at 350 in an electric fryer. Around 300 for 20 mins and my chicken came out golden brown and juicy, cooked all the way through.

I did not care for this recipe. Seriously lacked salt. I followed the frying instructions to the letter, even buying the more expensice peanut oil. I could fit all but 4 pieces of the chicken in the cast iron enameled dutch oven like he suggested using. And, with crowding all the chicken in at once, the oil temp plummeted to 250 and never got to 305-310 as he suggested. The result was more oil in the crust than I would have preferred.

This was PERFECT!! I soaked in buttermilk mix overnight. All the seasoning in buttermilk clung to the chicken and was under the skin also. Next time I will double most of the seasoning  (s&p, garlic, and definately the paprika or leave as is and throw in some Lawrys or dry Adobo depending on my taste). I used more than 2 quarts of peanut oil and had a lesson in how that decreases the cooking time for the chicken by half!! lol...Despite the BROWN chicken lol, it retained it's juicyness much to my relief heehee. Next time it will be perfect ;) Also, for that nice crispy coating, after I breaded chicken I set on wire rack and covered in clean dish towel until the flour turned to a paste consistency-about 20 min. I had a little trouble keeping the temp at 350. I found 375 to be too high. But I find that getting temp to 370 right before adding chicken is good, because the chicken will decrease the temp, then you just decrease the heat a little to keep temp at 350. My chicken breasts were freaking ENORMOUS and I would not use giant chx breasts for this ever again lol.

This was VERY good fried chicken - I rarely take the time to fry chicken any more, but made this as a special request for a granddarling's birthday.  I omitted the cayenne because of all the children, and this was still outstanding.  Everyone LOVED it and I'll be making this again!

This is the first time I have made fried chicken. I even bought a whole chicken and cut it myself. My husband said this is the best fried chicken he's ever had. I did not deep fry (oil is expensive) but fried in frying pan. Thank you Chef!! for making me look like a pro.

I love this recipe. It's definitely our "family & friends" favorite. I use what is called "Laban" (sort of a drinkable yogurt) in place of buttermilk. I don't have a Dutch oven so I use my cast iron pan instead, and only fry it until it gets golden-brown and sufficiently crispy. Then I pop them in the oven for about 8 minutes at 375F while I fry potato wedges in the oil.

I marinated in buttermilk for 1.5 days (just didn't have time to make it before)  I used peanut oil and it was easy to make and got rave reviews from the family

Yummy! This was tasty. I didn't have any white pepper so I just left it out. I used legs and thighs instead of a whole cut up chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!!  I let it soak overnight.  The herbs come through in layers.  First the crisp, then the sage, then the cayenne.  You can taste everything!!  Loved it!  My 2 year old was double-fisting pieces into his mouth faster than we could cut them.  Thank you!

I made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly, other than using boneless skinless breasts cut into strips. The finicky family loved it. Next time I may add some hot sauce to the soak. Thanks for a great recipe!

ok so i've been finding things to cook on this site for like ever and i must say...Chef John, you are AMAZING! this recpe was so good. i had to use bonless chicken because im scared to actually cut a whole chicken myself and the batter still stuck. My husband was all "you didn't use egg yolks?! gordon ramsey was chewing his chef out on hell's kitchen for not using egg yolks" when he was watching me cook...and of course he was quick to shut his mouth after tasting this recipe. he and I were so happy, the batter stuck really well even tho i didn't have a dutch oven to cook with. and it had so much flavor and 2 days later when we had leftovers night, husband was super excited that there was one piece left for him. i also appreciate that you mention other ways of cooking the same thing and when it's important to have the right tools and when it's not. You are awesome! And i will never use anyone else's recipes over yours again...EVER!

My wife loved it. She said it was the best fryed chicken she had ever had. The only changes I did was double the spices and browned it in a frying pan then cooked in the oven at 375 for 40 minutes. It was GREAT I'll make it many times.

This recipe was a big hit for my mom's birthday party!!  Thank you very much Chef John.  I was told it was just as good the next day as leftovers.  
The only thing I changed was the temp of my oil(peanut).  At 350*, the chicken was browning too fast and not cooking all the way through.  I found keeping my oil around 275*/285* was the ideal temp for the chicken to have a nice brown/crunchy skin and my chicken was cooked perfectly.  I made 3 family packs of legs and 3 family packs of thighs so I had time to adjust and find the right temp.  But if you are making a small amount of chicken you probably would have burnt under-cooked chicken @ 350*.  I hope this helps, happy cooking!!

This is very much like a recipe I got from my grandmother, added to it by advice from a military wife in Colorado, and tweaked a bit by myself.  Soak the chicken pieces in whole milk for about an hour.  Coat with a mixture of flour, salt, black pepper, ground sage, and poultry seasoning.  Nothing measured, just eyeballed.  Heat  about half an inch of oil in a heavy pan.  A dutch oven is perfect.  Brown each piece of chicken on all sides.  Remove to a plate or pan.  When the last pieces of chicken are in the pan, browning on the last side, replace all the chicken pieces in layers, add any drippings that have accumulated in the plate or pan of chicken.  Cover and reduce heat.  Cook until largest pieces are cooked through.  Remove the chicken.  Drain off any excess oil, leaving a little.  Make a paste of remaining flour mixture by slowly adding cold liquid (milk or water).  Make gravy by adding the milk in which the chicken was soaked,  the paste, used water that was drained from boiled, peeled potatoes.  There is a little knack with adding  the milk, flour paste, and potato water while beating with a wire whisk.  (Old timers can do it with a spoon without getting lumps.)  Taste it for more salt, pepper, or poultry seasoning.  The result is the most delicious gravy you ever ate,  served over mashed or boiled potatoes.

First, I love Chef John and find him very entertaining as well as giving some great recipes.
I will try this recipe on Sunday for my family who love great fried chicken.  I'm sure I won't be disappointed. Never have been with his great recipes and videos! I am going to try his two ingredient Chicken and mushrooms, also. He is a delight to listen to on his videos! I am giving this 5 stars because of my experience with other recipes by him.  
Thanks,
Julia in Kansas City, MO

The Good:
Very tender and very juicy. 

The Bad:
Borderline burned and little to no flavor. 

Double the seasonings, but triple the salt. Let the heat settle down to 250 after you initially put your chicken in the oil. I reduced the heat on my second batch to 250 and it had a lighter texture and color than the first batch. I used an electric skillet with 3 quarts of canola oil, and 10 minutes on  each side was about right.

This recipe is so good, I smiled after taking a bite. Added celery seeds and fresh chopped onion to the brine. After crisping the skin, put the chicken in the oven to bake all the way through. Garnished with sea salt. Very, very good!

I used chicken thighs for this recipe. It tasted great but is definitely not a recipe for a deep fryer. At 350 degrees the first batch burned after 10 minutes. I put the second batch in for 8 minutes and it looked perfect but neither batch was fully cooked through. Had to microwave them to finish cooking... thank goodness the buttermilk tenderizes the chicken and they didn't dry out. Next time I'll try actually pan frying it although I've never had success with that method. I'll also substitute some hot sauce (Franks, etc) for the cayenne pepper in the marinade.

The buttermilk soak was perfect, but I wasn't a huge fan of the coating. It got very dark, almost burned in the time it took to cook the chicken. Usually I nibble on the breading but this didn't do it for me.

I followed this exactly other than the peanut oil and used vegetable oil.  Was not overly impressed with taste but if you judged it by looks only it was amazing.  Not crazy about the batter or seasonings but the chicken was definitely moist.  Everyone ate it but we were in agreement it will probably not be a repeat for us.  (House smelled like oil all night)

I was craving fried chicken and found this recipe.  I wanted to use boneless skinless chicken breasts, but they were out, so I used bonelsss skinless chicken thighs. I  did everything according to the direction with the exception of cooking time.  They were done within 15 minutes.  The internal temp was 175 degree.  Extra crispy and flavorful and nice and moist!!!

Nummy, nummy!!!

ok so I didn't have buttermilk, though I did let them sit in whole milk so the seasoning worked in. And I used Mrs. dash cajun seasoning because I was lacking a few spices basically the same though. Over all It had turned out amazing thank you!

This was my first time making fried chicken, and it was easy enough to follow. It tasted just as good as any fried chicken you would buy. I made only chicken thighs, rather than a whole chicken. I would not cook it for more than 10 minutes on each side for thighs, since the ones I cooked for  more than 1 0 minutes started to look a little burned.

I was skeptical at first as I have yet to come across a recipe that made it easier to make moist and flavorful fried chicken. I did add a little more seasoning as I, if you'll excuse me, like to taste it  if I burp.

Allow the flour to dry (10-15) before frying (Which will also allow the chicken to come to room temperature, some what, NOT affecting oil temp as well, when cooking all pieces at once, when still cold).

I made this as-is. I loved it. My boyfriend did not (he insists it's way too heavy on the pepper). Five stars because the recipe works and it's good; spice is a simple matter of taste. Alter to your palate's desire. Thanks again, Chef John!

Everyone loved the flavor of the crust and the chicken. I only cooked the chicken 15 minutes in oil then the next day, baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  Came out juicy and tender. Ive never made fried chicken before and found this very easy to do.  I did check the temp of the oil as with each batch the temp of oil goes down so needed some time between batches to get back to the right temperature. Highly recommend this recipe.

Made recipe as is.  Breading is bland.  No mention of Do Not Cook Chicken cold.  Needs to warm up for at least 30 min before cooking.   Oil temp of 350 seems too hot burns breading and chicken is under done.  Not the recipe for us needless to say.  Baking chicken and using it for sandwiches .

I made this. The only things I changed was I left chicken overnight in buttermilk and spices and I used a pressure cooker.  It was the best fried chicken I had ever eaten supper moist even the left overs. My son that is now 28  never says to much about my cooking even if he loves it but even my toughest critic had nothing but high praise for this.

This recipe is perfect.  I like a little more garlic and onion powder.  The key to frying is enough oil that is peanut or canola in a Dutch oven with a lid. Came out beautiful.

This was outstanding! My boyfriend said I should open up a fried chicken shack because he doesn't know anyone who wouldn't like this! However I did alter the recipe to suit our taste. I used 2 chicken breasts  for the two of us but used the same amount of spices, I didn't use oregano or sage. i also used kefir instead of buttermilk, because thats what i had at home. For the seasoned flour, I used the same amount of spices as the recipe called for, for 1 cup of flour instead of two. And as I said, they were outstanding! And there's enough left over to make delicious wraps or sandwiches today ? very pleased I tried this recipe.

Thought this was below average in flavor and not traditional enough for me.  I think the sage was overpowering - took away from the other seasonings.  I doubled the seasonings in the batter and there was still no punch.

This got rave reviews from my Southern husband (who is son of the world's best cook).  I never would have believed I could make fried chicken that didn't come out of a cardboard box, but this was so worth it.  The buttermilk marinade made the chicken tender and the batter even tastier.  I did sneak a little teeny bit of Parmesan cheese in the flour mixture, but don't tell. ;-)   You simply can't go wrong when you follow Chef John's instructions.

Chef John you made another great recipe and made my hubby and me very happy.  I have to disagree with the reviews that said the chicken lacked flavor, I thought it was great flavor.  I also have to disagree with people about problems with frying.  You do have to keep a close eye on the temp of the oil and adjust accordingly, as everyone's oven is different, and can vary depending upon the amount and kind of chicken used (I used skinless single serve chicken breasts).  I will definitely be making again, Thank You!

OUTSTANDING!! I usually am not a fan of fried chicken; probably because I've only ever had store-bought fried chicken. This recipe is amazing. It makes succulent, moist, flavorful chicken inside a crunchy, tasty outside. YUM! I made this for extented family and everyone loved it! I'd say it's way worth the effort!

This was by far the best fried chicken ever.......my family absolutely loved it!  The only thing I would have changed since I did follow the recipe exactly as above is maybe not add so much of the spicy seasonings...it was a little warm for the kids.  Great recipe!

tastes great, I just need to work on the oil temp.
I followed the directions and the breading was getting burn'at before the center of the chicken was cooked.  Herbs and spices are the best.

Chef John - I promise I will try these again and upgrade my rating if it works out. Could be that my novice cooking skills failed me here. My chicken turned out burnt, and in trying a second batch, was done cooking through at 14 minutes. At 14 minutes is when the chicken would burn. I had a thermometer to ensure right temp. My best guess at what went wrong was my attempt to raise the oil temp back to 350 after chicken was inserted and lowered the temp to 300. Keeping at 300 will be the key.

I found this a little on the bland side.  I would have added a bit more spices maybe some garlic or chili flakes.  I removed the skin from the chicken to cut down on the fat.  Overall it was quite easy.

i made this according to recipe and the chicken was tender and juicy inside and crispy on the outside however i used a thermometer the whole time and the breading still got way too dark too fast.  i stopped frying it after 15 minutes because it was burning.  luckily i had only used thighs so they were cooked in that time.  i think next time i would try it at a lower temperature or maybe use boneless meat to cut down the cook time.

this was my first time making fried chicken. with that being said it took me a while to figure out how to best to coat the chicken tenders to get a nice crust. my family enjoyed the recipe but i felt it was a bit bland. i will try this again and double up the spices.

I used a deep fryer and set it between 325 to 350 degrees. At 350 chicken was too brown. I used all thighs without the bone. Added a bit more cayenne ... we like it spicy!

For the most tender I use only thighs with skin on and I cut them in half so that they cook well internally.   I also dip 4 pieces in in flour and fry small batches at a time and add oil as I need it.  My daughter asked that I make it again.

This chicken recipe is awesome! It was crispy on the outside. Inside, so tender & moist.  Even though I didn't have any thyme, the seasoning was perfect. This will definitely be my one and only recipe for fried chicken. Great job!

This is a great fried chicken recipe!! The only changes I made were minor.  I didn’t have peanut oil - used vegetable oil.  I didn’t have enough oil for Dutch oven or deep fryer so I fried in pan - same overall cooking time as recipe. I also only marinated for 3 or 4 hours - didn’t have enough time to go full 6 hours or overnight - but the chicken was still very moist with wonderful flavor. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing Chef John - I never go wrong with any of your recipes!

I loved this and it was pretty easy to make.  Came out perfect. Was like my Mom used to make.  I did finish off in the oven to cook through, used bone in thighs.  Was great as leftovers too.  Can't wait to make it again.  No photo, we ate it all

Best Fried Chicken Ever !!! 

Frying Tips :    Don't over crowd the pan. Always work in batches and let the oil come back to the proper temp before adding more chicken.      After coating your chicken in the flower mixture, let it rest for a few minutes before you fry it. This will help keep your crust on nice and tight to the chicken.

I love Chef John's recipes! They work every time! I don't have a deep fat fryer, so I followed his large frying pan option. And, used all thighs (my favorite piece). Otherwise I made no changes to his recipe and it received rave remarks from everyone who tasted it. I also happen to have a soft spot for cold left over fried chicken, and this did NOT disappoint! I will absolutely make this again, and have added it to my top 10 favorite recipes.

The flavor is EXCELLENT! Chef John, you're awesome!

I made this for dinner tonight and we loved it. The only change I have to make, and this has NOTHING to do with the recipe itself. I used my cast iron skillet and it browned a little too much. So, the next time I make this I'll be cutting back on the actual time it's in the oil. I did put it in the oven at 350 while I cooked everything else. So yes, my chicken was done to the correct temperature. THAT IS THE ONLY CHANGE I'M MAKING!  

I have a Culinary Degree and I've got to admit, this chicken is better than mine. So this is now the only way I'll be making fried chicken!

I did a double dredge (dredged the chicken, dunked it back in the buttermilk, then dredged again) and let the chicken sit for a few minutes before frying.  I deep fried for 12 minutes.  SO crispy and juicy, my family said it was some of the best fried chicken they've ever had.  I will so be doing this again!

Years ago (way before I knew there was a Chef John!) I came up with this exact method!!  I am still remembered for my fried chicken even though I've gone on to a  much healthier diet.   Every once in awhile my husband and grown children request this...for old time sake!  I never had any measurements (just threw it together) so it's nice to have this in written form so I can pass it on to my family.  Occasionally I would soak the chicken in salted water instead and when ready to fry I would then dip it in the buttermilk, etc.  This is really a wonderful way to fry chicken and always brings compliments!!!!

My hubby and I both agreed this was just as good as any crispy chicken we had had before from ANYWHERE.  So juicy and the crispy outside was absolutely delicious.

Absolutely the best fried chicken recipe!  I followed everything exactly, with  the exception of white pepper ( I don't have any).  My husband LOVED it.  Will definitely always use this recipe

I made this tonight because the grocery store had chicken legs on sale. I decided to make half of them this recipe and half of them Chef Johns Nashville Hot chicken (check over there for that review). Flavor wise, they turned out great! Super crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. However, I used the same temperature (I used a deep fryer so it maintains the correct temperature) and they came out super brown looking. They didn't taste burnt but they didn't look great. But they tasted great! So, if you're going for presentation and trying to impress someone, I would maybe go for a lower temperature for a longer time. My husband and I were the only ones to eat them, so they were good enough for us. I love Chef John and would love to cook with him someday, it's on my bucket list!

Used crushed red pepper instead of cayenne in buttermilk solution(out and improved) and let sit for 30 hours prior to dredging in flour. By far my favorite fried chicken

I used boneless chicken thighs and boneless breasts cut in 3. I also switched out the flour for PC All purpose gluten free flour and fried in a frying pan on the stove top.  Brought about 1 inch of oil to a boil and added chicken pieces turning them after about 10 minutes. Be very careful using this method, do not leave the pan of frying chicken unattended as oil can spatter out of the pan and cause fire if not monitored.  Very tasty will make again

The flavor of his spices were good, next time I am going to add marjoram to it. The chicken stayed moist. I will make this over and over again.

Tasted great. I used 8 chicken thighs, double breaded them, and had just enough flour. I used Cajun seasoning instead of the sage, extra cayenne and marinated for 24 hours. For the thighs, 350 was definitely too hot, so I set it to about 315 for 15 minutes, and if the middle still had trouble cooking, I cut each thigh open and fried them for an extra minute .

Great recipe for chicken.  Took some of the advice from reviews. Browned in peanut oil for 6-8 min then on rack in oven at 350 for 30 min.  Nice and moist and crispy outside. Used 24 drumsticks , had enough to make another dozen pieces.

Way too peppery--but that's just me. Buttermilk marinade worked and chicken was moist and tasty. I fried in skillet instead of Dutch oven. Nice crunchy breadlng. Will try again with less pepper.

I added cornstarch into mix with floured herb mix and an egg to make a batter.  I used an Italian herb mix and chervil. Lots of garlic salt and kosher salt. I kept my buttermilk marinate then dipped in flour and again in buttermilk then flour for 2 dips and coatings before frying it. Coating was delicious and chicken inside soft moist delicious. I used thighs so frying was not enough to cook them through. After frying I baked them for 20 minutes more with some oil in pan. Did not need any sauce. Plain was delicious. Ate them with a veg mix of carrots peas and corn buttered with salt and pepper. Next day I made potato salad for another meal.

My hubby took a bite and said, "mmmm this might be better than KFC!!!" And he's a KFC lover! I'd definitely make this again and my kids loved this! I gave it 4 stars because as per a reviewers suggestion, I doubled the spices to go in the seasoned flour (except the salt)  and it really needs that. It would be quite bland without it. Also I didn't have any buttermilk so made it with whole milk and vinegar and I just shallow fried it in a large pan which took about 16 minutes (used drumsticks). Edit: I fried some the next day but this time left the chicken dredged in flour for over an hour. The result was the crispy outside was falling off the chicken when it left to cool after frying. I won't be doing that again.

Sweet Baby Jesus these were amazing!   Anyone who enjoyed this should consider using Chef John's recipe for chicken fried steak, since the batter is different and IMO, only SLIGHTLY better  than this one - mostly due to the fact that the baking soda used in the other one makes the breading a little more fluffy.  Still, the flavor on these was amazing, and I didn't have the time to marinade in the buttermilk (only about 40 minutes).  I really winged it since I had a lot more chicken than is listed in recipe.  Also I had a couple of chicken breasts that I cut to be more or less the same size as the tenderloins.  My suggestions/modifications:  I could have used half the flour called for.  I also cut back a little on the cayenne since my picky kids donna lika the spicy!  :D

Also, I would pull the chicken out earlier than I did and that is suggested in recipe.  Some of my pieces were extremely juicy, but most were just a BIT dry.  Of course I used a blend of peanut and canola since I didn't have enough peanut, and put about 2-3 inches deep oil in a large, deep skillet (I don't own a dutch oven).  Worked great and not very messy at all as I was expecting (grease was not everywhere).    

As always from CJ, an amazing recipe.   Any recipes on here from him that aren't delicious?  Crazy.

Very good.  I, too, increased the spices in the flour mixture.  I also added some rice flour, panko,  and corn starch to the flour to increase the crispiness of the coating.  I pan fried the chicken to get the brown color and then finished it in the oven.  (I used a thermometer to make sure it was the correct temperature. ) Everyone loved it.

I made this almost as written except that I had already begun soaking the chicken in buttermilk.  I had it in a bag overnight with the buttermilk. I put the seasoning on it about 5 hours prior to cooking and then back in the buttermilk.  This is the first fried chicken I have ever made so I was really nervous about it. The temp of the oil came down to under 300 but I turned it up and tried to get the temp back up.  After the first 10 minutes it was still under 300 but I turned the chicken as directed and continued cooking.  After 20 minutes total, the chicken was getting dark so I checked the internal temp and it was 170.  I was also nervous about taking it out earlier than directed but it was done and was really good.  It was much earlier than I imagined and I will definitely make it again!

This was my 2nd attempt ever at trying to make fried chicken. The first was such a total disaster I did not try again for almost 20 years. Thank you for such an easy recipe with great taste! My husband and daughter both said it was the best fried chicken they have ever had, and the reason was the thinner crust. Now I know how to make fried chicken, and I can turn to this recipe time and time again. The flavors were great, and the chicken was very moist.

I made this recipe to test my new air fryer. I followed the recipe as written except cooked it in the air fryer after spritzing each piece with a little oil. Cooked it on the chicken setting (360 deg for 25 minutes) flipping it half way through in two batches. The chick came out fantastic!  Moist and juicy. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 rating is because of some of the spices. That said, the spice blend tasted better the next day on the leftovers. I suggest trying the recipe and adjusting the spices to your own taste. I repeated the recipe with the spice adjustments and again had beautifully browned, crispy, and moist chicken!  I’m a fan of both the recipe and my air fryer!

Perfection - I had to work on keeping my oil hot enough but that was my issue.  This reminds me of the chicken we used to have when I worked for Loretta Lynn in the 80s.

My husband and I very much enjoyed this recipe.  However I made the chicken in my airfryer and it worked perfectly.  We will have this again.

I tripled the recipe and fed many people at a gathering.  The chicken was universally loved.  Because of my last-minute decision to use this recipe, I soaked the chicken in the butter milk for only 4 hours.  It was delicious - I can only imagine what more hours (or overnight) would do for it.  This is highly recommended.

Not near enough flavor. I was hoping for a flaky crust and that the spices would provide an explosion of flavor and instead this recipe yielded a hard crust and despite the spices and peanut oil, had little flavor.

Batter is very thick and clean up is not easy.  You have to really season the flour.  I thought I had over seasoned it but no, it could have used more.  On the bright side it was very crunchy.  I suggest using a non stick pan if you don't have a deep fryer.  I made my first bath in one of the clay coated pots and the batter stuck to the bottom and the first round of chicken had no breading because it all stuck to the bottom.  I changed to a non stick pot and all was good.

Chicken Tender cuts. I added hot sauce and an egg to the buttermilk.  I also dredged in the flour, then back into the buttermilk and floured a second time (recommended from another fried chicken recipe). I might spice up the raw chicken before marinading in the buttermilk.
Very high in fat of course. Next time - try frying just a little, then baking.

Great tips and tasty recipe. Thanks! I always skin my chicken and instead of flour I dredged my chicken in seasoned Panko. . It leaves  a very tasty crunchy crust without all the skin fat. I do the flour, coat in beat eggs and dredge in Panko for all food that I deep fry such as chicken, fried zucchini, schrimp etc. in Panko. Makes foods a lot crispier than flour. This was the first time I’ve used buttermilk. I will def make again!

I totally screwed up the buttermilk with spices and ended up tossing them all in the flour. Still, it's crispy and good looking with the crust staying firm to the wings. Because I used wings, the cooking time was much faster. Overall, I agree with MSelvidio, who said that she'd double all the spices except the salt. I'll certainly make it again and might also add some Old Bay seasoning.

This was my first time making fried chicken, and it was delicious!! I combined another recipe by adding about 1/3 cup of coarse salt to the buttermilk to make more of a brine that it soaked in, and I used enough buttermilk to completely cover the chicken (about a quart). I doubled the spices in the flour mixture as others recommended. I completely omitted the cayenne pepper though b/c of wanting to please my little kids. 20 minutes deep-frying in my enameled dutch oven was perfect. Sooooo juicy and flavorful. Much better than store or restaurant- bought. Thanks, Chef John!

I make this *almost* exactly as posted here but with these healthy changes:
1.  instead of flour I use whole wheat Panko
2. instead of frying, I bake the chicken.  Follow the directions thru step 4 then place each piece of coated chicken on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Spritz the top of each piece with olive oil spray - bake for 30 minutes at 400. Flip, spritz again and pop back in the oven for another 10-15 minutes or until chicken is sizzling and golden brown.

I made chicken nuggets with this recipe. Cut 2-3 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken breasts into 1-2in. pieces, then prepare according to recipe except deep fat fry for 5 minutes in olive oil. I thought it was a bit salty, so I used half the salt after the first time and it was perfect.

Easy recipe.  I really liked how tender the chicken was and I liked the crisp to it.  However, the flavor was lacking a little - to my taste.  I didn't do it, but I agree with what someone else said...double all the Spices.  Still overall it was good.  We dipped it in honey and Franks Red Hot. Yumm!

I don't often make Fried chicken now a days
But when I do this is my goto recipe I use.
The chicken stays juicy and tender and the breading is to die for. But I  do use my Deep Fryer instead of a large pot the heat stays right on target .

Here I am, eating wings standing up by a kitchen counter, making such noises my neighbors must think I'm getting down and dirty. Perfect crust without breadcrumbs, perfect taste. I never knew chicken could taste so good. I love it and I will be making it like this from now on.

Instead of frying in oil I used my air fryer and they turned out wonderful. Maybe not as good as good 'ol deep fried chicken but as good as you can get when you have to be on a diet.

Followed the recipe as written. Love this chicken it was juicy, a little heat with the cayenne (I think I may have accidentally used a bit more). The chicken was delicious, crispy, moist and tender.  Can't eat this way very often but when you crave a yummy fried chicken dinner this is my go to recipe.

This will make everyone in the neighborhood wonder what you're cooking that smells so good! I just put some vegetable oil at the bottom of a big sauce pan and fried the wings for the allotted time. SO GOOD!

Was looking to use leftover buttermilk. Really good flavor. Subtle but distinct herbal compliments. Chicken was moist and tender. This is a keeper.

I have not had much luck in the past making fried chicken, but
this recipe turned out great.  Nice and crispy on the outside but moist on the inside.  I think I will increase the salt and seasonings in the flour mixture next time but will definitely make it again.

This is the best fried chicken recipe ever! Though they don't taste like the originals, the spices like oregano and thyme give it a great burst of flavor and make this recipe a great dinner for any family dinner or event. I made my own buttermilk with milk and lemon juice, it turned out great. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I'm not sure if it's cause I was cooking with gas cooktop or if the Dutch oven I used was too efficient but my cook time was 15 mins and it was perfect. Cooked a batch for 20 and they burnt and my temp was at 170 c. Other than that it was awesome.

Tasted great!  Next time I would add a bit more spices and get something that I can keep even temperature in, too hard to use a dutch oven over the stove and keep an even temperature.  Otherwise, fantastic and so excited to have a great fried chicken recipe!

Great recipe! I used this for some homemade chicken strips and it worked out wonderful. The chicken was tender and the flour stuck beautifully so that each piece was evenly covered and crisp.

Chef John is awesome.  I'm never afraid to try his recipes because I know they will work.  I made this recipe with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, frying them in coconut oil about 7 minutes per side and then sticking them in a 350 oven until my potato dish was done (about 15 minutes).  They were wonderful, and the coating is so, so good.  Thanks for another great one, Chef!!

I love Chef John's recipes and this one is no different.  The chicken came out very tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The only thing I would change for me and my family is to add a little more spice to the flour mixture.  Otherwise this will be my go-to recipe for fried chicken! Thanks Chef!

Doubled the spicies and salt to add stronger flavor and took out the breasts 5-8 mins before the dark meat to ensure they didn't dry out. Otherwise good basic recipe.

It went exactly as the recipe was published. No hitches!
Only thing different was I used canola & sunflower oil. It also has a high temp rating but a bit healthier then peanut oil.

This tasted great.  I had no luck at all putting spices in a bowl and moving the chicken around in it to get the spices on the chicken.  The spices all ended up on the first couple of pieces.   I'd suggest putting them in an empty spice jar and sprinkling them on the chicken instead.  I didn't want to wait 6 hours while the chicken soaked in the milk, so I heated it up to speed up the process and partially cooked the pieces.  Also the precooking reduced the time it needed in the hot oil--only about 10 minutes for me.  I used my thermometer to check the temperature of each piece and pulled them out when it read 180 degrees.  Nice spicy, crispy coating and the chicken was moist and tasty.

ok, so I usually don't review a recipe unless i've made it EXACTLY as written because otherwise I would be reviewing a different recipe. That being said, I did make this recipe....i just was distracted and made a mistake. I mixed the flour into the buttermilk part of the recipe accidentally. I didn't realize it until later...oops! I just went on with it, though, and sprinkled a bit more flour with the remaining seasonings in the shallow dish, took the chicken out of the (now) batter, dusted it with the flour mixture and into the oil it went! I don't know how big of a difference that really made in the grand scheme of things, but this chicken came out PERFECTO! I have never made true fried chicken. I usually like to oven fry it because it is a bit healthier and way less mess. My husband even commented that he has made fried chicken several times in the past and it never quite comes out right. He's often had the chicken undercooked with the outside a bit overcooked, too crispy, and burned. This recipe came out just right. The skin was thick and golden and the chicken was cooked and tender. YUM YUM! So, I might just keep making it my way....lol!

I loved this recipe. My change was I used a combo of 1/2 1/2 butter and canola oil to fry in and I pan fried each side for 4 minutes and then finished in the oven (350 for 30 min).  So delicious!

I liked making this fried chicken. It was easy and was very juicy inside. My family did not like the batter, but I  did. I would make it again for appreciative friends.

I read another review that said to double all the spices, so I doubled (at least) mine too.  It was phenomenal.  This was the first time I've made friend chicken and we absolutely love it.  Next time I'll do it when my wife is home so she can give me some pointers on the actual frying process itself.  For example, do you use a lid or not?

This recipe was a lot of work, especially the prep with the buttermilk six hours earlier.  It was so worth it though.  I will absolutely make this again and I will absolutely crank up the spices again when I cook it.

Only changes made was to add a half cup of cornstarch.  Only because my sister said it makes the coating stay on better.  I don't know for sure, but it didn't hurt the recipe.  DH said it was the best chicken he's ever had.  Sister said it was really good.  I loved it, it was well worth the work and will definitely will make this again.

This is delicious!  I have to say it took me a min to get the grease right so I didn't get the chicken to brown but even with it a little to brown it's still very good!  The chicken was in the buttermilk and spices all night. Very juicy and tasty:)

I forgot I had a huge thing of peanut oil so I used coconut oil.   It was fantastic.  I had extra egg and coating so I coated the fries too.   It was a fantastic change of pace I usually only eat sweet potatoes but a friend gave me some she'd grown.   

Around Thanksgiving I decided at the last minute I didn't want baked or whole fried turkey so I cut up a young one and fried the pieces using this method. OMG that was really good too.   I tried using coconut flour and regular flour both was tasty but I like the regular flour better for this recipe.

Sorry, this recipe didn't do it for me. Per other reviews, I doubled the spices in the breading and it was still very bland. Needed more salt, more kick. The marinade had potential...I would add Louisiana hot sauce to the marinade next time, and maybe some Cajun seasoning to the breading....I guess there's a big difference how we like our fried chicken in Louisiana!

I wanted to try a recipe for buttermilk fried chicken, and Chef John's recipes are always something I look forward to trying.  I was really disappointed in how this went.  The family did not like the flavor or texture of the batter.  I'll go back to the way my mom taught me years ago - just coating chicken in seasoned flour.  Much easier and tastes much better with a beautiful crust that's not so thick.

Had a nice flavor and was easy.  Tried to cook it at 350 for the 20 minutes but almost came out burned.  Just saw chef's note saying to cook at 310 for 20 minutes.  Will try again.

This recipe is fantastic! The only thing I changed was I used Crisco shortening to fry. I'm not a fan of oil. I fried the chicken in a heavy electric skillet so I could monitor the temp. at 350°. Wonderful, very crispy and juices ran down my chin while eating it. You should try it!

The first time I've been disappointed with a CJ recipe. The first batch I made was exactly as written. As several commenters have stated, it was bland, and way too dark and crispy using the given time and temp. Doubled up on the spices for the second batch, and reduced oil temp to 325, and reduced time to 10 min per side. It was ok, but nothing special.

Well this was my best batch of fried chicken ever! Mom passed away too soon and I could never duplicate her delicious fried chicken. This recipe sure was close! I followed the directions as far as the seasoning and soaking in buttermilk. (Also -appreciated the video tutorial on prepping.)The prep spices were tasty with just a tiny hint of some heat in the final product. 
Only had an hour to soak it, then added a well mixed egg  to the buttermilk/chicken. A 1/4 c of Lawrys seasoning salt went into the flour instead of mixing up more spices-because that's how Mom did it. Dredged the chicken in that flour and let it sit on a plate while the oil was heating-about 30 minutes.  16-20 minutes for my 2 batches of fried chicken to cook as someone previously mentioned. Incredibly delicious! Almost as good as Mom's ; ) Thanks for this recipe and tutorial.

My daughter has Celiac disease which was diagnosed at 18 years old, she is now 29.  I used this recipe to marinate the chicken strips, and adapted the dry ingredients.  Since GF flour is very gummy when wet, I used I cup GF flour and 1 cup GF bread crumbs, added all the spices as written in the recipe and deep fried in my fryer.  The  chicken fingers were fabulous.  My family loved them so much that they thought I should sell them, not likely but it was great to cook them something that we could all enjoy.  Thanks Chef John!

I made this recipe exactly as stated with the exception of using half the cayenne in both the buttermilk marinade and the coating. I thought that it may be too hot for my husband. This was actually a mistake. Next time I will use the full amount. The chicken was very juicy from the 6 hours in buttermilk.  Made sure that the peanut oil was at the right temperature It turned out great.

The chicken was very tender.  Despite all the spices, it lacked a little flavor.  Our family picked their dipping sauce of choice, which added the flavor we wanted.

I really, really love the flavor this brings, especially the final spiced flour mixture. I am hoping for our Chef John to recommend a different oil since many of my friends have peanut allergies (so far sunflower has been OK, but browns quickly even when I shake the excess flour off). The first time I made this I didn't have any white pepper, but adding it this second time around seriously increased the spice aspect. I recommend omitting either the white or cayenne pepper if serving to children. Thank you so much, John, for this recipe, and I look forward to using more of your recipes in the future.

I have always soaked my chicken in buttermilk and I add a splash of hot sauce.  After soaking I season the flour with 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, poultry seasoning, lemon pepper, basil, salt and pepper. A candy thermometer is most helpful when frying chicken. You don't want the outside to be too crisp before the chicken is done inside. I love fried chicken.

I made this with boneless, skinless thighs and it was fantastic.  Moist chicken and crunchy coating! Doubled the spices in the flour mixture and fried for 20 minutes.  Was afraid I was overcooking since they were boneless but I think sticking to the 20 - 25 minute cooking time is what made the coating so crunchy and delish.  Chef John...you're the best!

A winner!  The only change was I used vegetable oil instead of peanut oi.  It came out flavorful and moist with just the right amount of crunch.   I will make this again.  I just cooked legs, so the timing was easy at 10 minutes per side (these were very large legs though).

Very good. Crispy, and juicy. I have a vacuum packer so did all buttermilk and spices in that and put it on marinate. Cut the time down considerably.I've made this twice and it is turned out perfect both times. Only thing I would change is my chicken could've been a little bit more golden but that's my fault not Chef John's. Great recipe. Thanks Chef John!

I did let it soak in the buttermilk overnight and since my chicken was small it fried 12 mins totally in the Dutch oven.  It was delicious.  Oh another change was I used oil on hand which was vegetable.  Next time I make it I will use peanut oil.

Wow! I followed another reviewers recommendation to double the spices except the salt and otherwise followed this recipe. This was sooo tender and flavorful. An awesome dish if I do say so myself! Glad I made enough for tomorrow night's dinner too.

The chicken came out moist and tender, but we didn't care for the coating.  At first I thought the sage was overpowering, but it was the garlic.  I could taste the garlic, and garlic isn't something I normally associate with fried chicken so it was a little off for me.  I think I'll look for another buttermilk fried chicken recipe.

Having never tried to do this type of fried chicken, I decided why not?  So, indeed I soaked the seasoned chicken pieces in buttermilk, using what types of meat we prefer only, drumsticks and breast tenders, with NO skin on those.  It worked really well despite the changes.  AND, I used a gluten free all purpose flour blend and added the spices to it.  Dredging and shaking it well to coat.  Did not deep fat fry in large dutch oven, but in a cast iron enamel Le Creuset no stick  pan.  It worked well, but done in batches.  Not wishing to use 2 qts of oil.  I also used avocado oil.  Never peanut.  All told, it was time consuming due to the batches having to be done this way.  Next time will fire up my large vintage stainless skillet and cook the chicken in that.  The flavor was indeed great, but again, to me lots of work.  Can't wait to try the gravy I made out of the drippings, YUM!  With some fresh smashed spuds!  I also used these chicken tenders to top a lovely Chinese slaw salad.  Great!

This recipe was as good as the photo looks.  I did not deep fry, just pan fried and it was still crispy and spicy on the outside and tender inside.

Sooo good, so much flavour. I found it best to dredge the chicken, let sit for a bit then dredge again. This way I didn't get any blow ups and bare skin on my chicken pieces. I also marinated overnight. yumyumyumyum!

crispy skin and just perfect! Yes, I did follow the recipe exactly, but for those of you who complain about folks who change the recipe stop complaining. I would rather find a recipe close to mine than looking through 2 million slightly changes recipes. Get over it!

I really liked this fried chicken rendition. I was out of rosemary but used all the other ingredients as directed it came out delicious but I was constantly aware of the buttermilk and it was something I had to get used to as I am more into an ultra spicy hot chicken. The spices made it good, and it did remind me of something a nice restaurant would serve. I liked it much better the 2nd day but, based solely on personal palate preference, I am not sure I will make it again without alterations. Chef John, can you do a spicy hot version for us southern folk who like the burn? :)

Great receipe as is! Might want to just add a bit more salt and pepper. I just doubled only that part of this! Also... Do yourself a favor and mix up the chicken and buttermilk the night before and let it set in fridge all night. It was Soooo good! Tender, and tasted in so good! Thanks chef!

Very good! I didn't have sage so that omitted but turned out nicely flavored. Also, if you're in a crunch and don't have all that time to marinate, 45 mins will work just fine.

We liked this.  The seasonings used were perfect.  The chicken came out moist and tender. It was even better cold the next day for lunch.  I will happily make this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

It came out tender but the lack of flavor was NOT worth it. Next time I'll skip buttermilk fried chicken and do a brine instead.

Excellent method for fried chicken.  Like another reviewer, I doubled the spices to be safe.  Crispy and good.  I would rate this higher than most grocery chain deli fried chicken, but not quite as amazing as Popeye's.  ;)

This was very flavorful chicken. The marinade is essential for that. Followed the recipe to the letter but the chicken was too brown at 15 minutes of cooking even though the oil only got back up to 275. Was cooked through but the coating was thin. Think I'll try the double dip method and stick to a deep skillet and two batches next time.

I tried this recipe today it turned out wonderful. Followed instructions as written I cooked dark meat for 20 min. white meat for 15 min. at 275 it works very well with electric fryer then you have more control of temp. I also allowed chicken to sit covered after dredging until pasty helps a great deal. See photo.

I truly enjoyed the learning opportunity that this recipe provided. I watched the accompanying video to make sure that I followed the cutting directions correctly. I have a good size family and so I doubled the recipe. I have never gone from whole chicken to fried chicken pieces. Unfortunately, I was missing a couple of ingredients that I feel would have made a big difference. I thought I had buttermilk but didn't and instead had to substitute milk with vinegar added 10 minutes before to curdle it for the soak. I also only had skim milk and I feel that the lack of milk fat made a difference in the final product as well. I also did not have sage and I feel that having the sage would have made for a more robust flavor. I also found that for me, when I tried to keep the oil at 350 degrees and cooked it for the recommended amount of time, those pieces ended up overcooked and too dark. But in the end, even with those missing ingredients this chicken was still FAR superior to anything that can be purchased at a chain restaurant or grocery store. It was delicious, fresh tasting, and full of chicken flavor not salt. My family really enjoyed it and now we are probably spoiled for any other kind of fried chicken. :)

Honestly I've never had success with any of Chef John's recipes but this one came out delicious.  My family loved it.  I used chicken tenders instead of cut up chicken.

I made this for dinner tonight and absolutely loved it.  Had to have the mashed potatoes and peas too.  I can's say enough about how tender this was and what a treat for the taste buds.  YUM.  I'm going to make this more than a few times.  Thank you Chef John.  Once again another incredible recipe.

Outstanding.  My wife "lost" her ability to fry chicken a few years ago.  Long story, but she did :).  This is just fabulous, just like she used to do.  Highly recommended!

This is an awesome recipe. I have a question though? I used a metal pot for the oil and after I put in the chicken it never reached 350 again....does the material of the pan make a difference? The drumsticks were way too done at 300 for 20 minutes, however the inside flavor was GREAT!!! I will definitely make this again.

Excellent chicken recipe! The buttermilk soak really made the meat tender and juicy and I ended up adding more of the spicy components in an attempt for a bit spicier fried chicken. I didn't have anything capable for deep frying so ended up using a pan with a shallow level of oil but it still worked. I think the temperature setting might have been too high but I can't rule out the change in my method of cooking for that.

Also, thanks for that awesome video preparation of this. I DID watch the chicken cutting part several times to really be able to break down a whole chicken myself.

This was the first time I had ever made fried chicken and it was delicious. The breading on the chicken has a very nice flavor to it and the chicken was tender and juicy.  I let my chicken soak in the buttermilk and spices for 6-6 1/2 hours.

A keeper.  Used chicken thighs and swapped out some of the spices, but the core recipe is excellent.

This was really good, I really liked the flavor. I just need to perfect the cooking process for me and my family. I am going to keep this for future fried chicken cooking.
