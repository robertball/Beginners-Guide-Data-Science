I've made this as elementary school teacher gifts for the past two years, and the teachers love it. I omit the cayenne and halve the amount of black pepper, then call it "Kid Friendly Creole Seasoning." I keep a batch of this in my cabinet and use it in many things: steak on the grill, baked chicken, in soups and stews, while cooking ground turkey or ground beef; anytime a little kick is needed. I even used it on my Thanksgiving turkey.  Thanks for the recipe! Even my picky 6-yr old and 8-yr old kids eat this. Note: to reduce the salt, use Kosher salt; gives it a nice texture without as much salty taste.

Watch out Emeril, Joslyn's in town.  I was concerned this would be too spicy with all the peppers, but it's just the right kick.  It worked great on the Oven-Fried Catfish recipe on this site.  I mixed two tsp seasoning and 1/3 cup ranch dressing for a dip for cauliflower. SO YUMMY!  Halving the recipe will make plenty to last a while. Fun to put together. Did look great as a mix. Add to mayo or ranch dressing for any kind of dip.  Perhaps it was just a bit salty tasting. Might do a pinch less next time.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I needed some Cajun spice blend for a recipe the other day and paid $4 for a bottle of Emirel's.  I was so disappointed in the taste.  I love this and more importantly, I can make two versions - hot and mild depending on who I am cooking for.  Thank you so much.  This is so much better than the purchased type.

This is the best Creole Seasoning, and overall seasoning, I have ever tasted. First, I tried making it exactly as the recipe says and it was great. For my second time, I adjusted it slightly by only adding 1/3 of the salt (for my dad with hypertension) and replacing a generous ½ tablespoon of the paprika with crushed red pepper flakes. It got unspeakably incredible! Also, I mixed 2 tablespoons of the seasoning with equal parts olive oil and Sweet Baby Ray’s original barbeque sauce plus a dash of brown sugar, mixed them and brushed the mixture over some beer brats on the grill. It was the most delicious barbequed dish I have ever tasted- bar none! My boyfriend also says it is equally delicious on ribs, chicken, Chex Mix and steak fries. Enjoy everyone!

Thank you for trying my original Creole Seasoning Blend, and for your reviews. While Creole seasonings all have similar ingredients, the combinations and ratios do differ. I was never happy with the commercial blends so, through trial and error, I came up with a blend that has a good amount of heat while still allowing the flavors of the spices and herbs to come through. I’m flattered that “gumbopages.com” has chosen my original recipe to post on their website, although they tweaked the recipe a bit by adding celery seed and omitting the salt. Creole recipes always start with a roux and “The Holy Trinity,” which consists of approximately equal amounts of diced onion, diced celery, and diced bell pepper, so for me; I don’t feel celery seed is needed in this blend. I realize some of you may be on salt restricted diets though, and you can certainly reduce the amount of salt, or omit it completely. Happy cooking!

Wonderful!  I cut down on the cayenne for my little ones, and it was still really good.  I used it on baked tilapia.  I will keep this on hand and use it often!

Creole Seasoning Blend is a big hit at BBQs and reheated for an indoor dinner.  It's a great investment because once you mix the blend, it can be used for so many easy, delicious chicken dinners.

Yeah!  I halved the recipe, and when it was all made I loved how pretty it was.  And it tasted wonderful!  I tried just a fingertip's worth of it and it's very spicy with a great tang to it.  Using it in jambalaya tonight, but I think I'll use it for a lot of things.

Great blend for the oven jambalaya.  Easy to mix up and keep.  I have used this on chicken and porkchops as well.

This is a good, and pretty standard, recipe. I've made it this way for a long time, however I don't like salt and this is a no-salt eating family. Yet if you leave out 3 tbs of a zero hot ingredient, you'll get a bit more spicy, so to make up for that, I increase the garlic powder, onion powder and basil to 3 tbs each. That makes up the salt difference and it's really REALLY good that way.

Love it! I added more thyme and a little lemon pepper for some brightness. I use this is in rubs for meats, but my favorite is using this on seafood especially in fish & shrimp tacos! Marinate the fish and shrimp for 10 minutes in 2 tbsp. of Creole Seasoning, juice of a lemon, and zest/juice of a lime. Cook in a skillet with half of the marinade til opaque. Soooooo good!!

A good blend for anything.  A little spicy for the kids but what do they know???  I highly recommend mixing up a batch and keeping it near the stove.

I'd rather control the salt myself so I left it out and, in deference to Hubs' sensitive innards, I cut way back on the cayenne.  This is a little heavy on the oregano for me.

Amazing blend that will forever replace the generic store Cajun seasonings in my cabinet. I used it tonight in Boudreaux's Zydeco Stomp Gumbo, and I couldn't have been happier w/ the results. I'm going to give this Creole blend as little gifts this holiday season, and maybe include the Gumbo recipe along w/ it. Thanks Joslyn for a fantastic alternative to store seasonings, and one that I can adjust to our family's taste (less salt, less spice etc ...) But PERFECTION as written!

Good golly, Miss Molly was this ever good! It took no time to mix together and the seasoning amounts were perfect. Just a slight hint of warmth but nothing to worry about for those who don't like hot/spicy foods. In fact, those who like their food on hotter side could probably add more cayenne, but I thought it was perfect as written. I used it on a shrimp and spaghetti recipe from this site and I couldn't tell the difference from what's served in a fine restaurant (I used to eat out a lot). This has to be among some of the top recipes found on this site, actually should be 6 stars! UPDATE....I used this recipe for my fried turkey marinade, found on this site. What a lifesaver. Soooo easy and delicious. Thanks again.

I make this recipe exact, no changes. Stomps the processed creole seasoning into the ground. I won't ever go back to processed again. Not only does it taste much better but it's cheaper, too. NOTE: I do tell you that it's best that you make this in large quanities, I like to at least triple or quadruple the recipe and keep it in a large Ball jar. When I have all the spices in the jar, all I have to do is slap on a lid and have one of my kids shake to his heart's content.

I had the site calculate the recipe for 300 servings, then another 100 to give as gifts. I leave the salt out completely and adjust other seasonings to my taste. Its been a huge hit.

I made a double batch of this, and keep it in a jar in the frig. I first used it for jambalaya, and I have since used it on roast chicken, roast beef, roast pork, chicken fingers, even shrimp. It is a great all-purpose seasoning with a nice kick to it. Thanks so much!

Looks and tastes great! I chose to make only 4 servings; 1 tsp. each of garlic & onion powder & black pepper & hot chili powder & paprika & salt and 3 tsps. pizza seasoning (much like Italian seasoning; my spice rack is running low). I went with what I had, and I think it'll do great on my take on buffalo shrimp (from this site) tonight.

How did you expect it to taste if you didn't use the ingredients instructed. Using Chili Powder will make this seasoning taste drastically different.

This spice blend was wonderful on wings! Like a previous reviewer, I omitted the cayenne and halved the black pepper so my toddlers would eat it. The whole family enjoyed it! When using on steak, use sparingly.

Just the average spice mix....nothing grand about it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe though.

This recipe is the best thing I've ever found on AllRecipes.  I took a large used onion powder jar, filled it with this blend, and colored and taped a Creole Seasoning label onto it.  Bay leaves are also good to add to the jar, and to the pot.  I have already had to remix and refill it!  Thank you Joslyn!!

I used smoked paprika and used 1/2 t less cayenne because I thought it'd be too hot. Next time I make this I'd used the full amount of cayenne, it wasn't too spicy. Really good pressed onto salmon filets and baked or grilled, and really good mixed into rice.

I use this for an every day seasoning. Soups, stews, rubs for bbq. Wisk some into eggs for scrambled eggs. There is nothing this doesnt work on! Ive even added it to flour when i dredge chicken for frying.

Perfect amount of spice and cajun flavor - even my boys LOVED it!  I only used 1/3 the amount of salt though, as we are reducing our salt intake.  Came out absolutely amazing - so good that I am considering making bottles for Christmas gift giving.  Thank you for sharing!

I used this for the Colleen's Slow cooker Jambalaya recipe and it worked out so well! It made a huge batch though, and I now also use it for chicken dry rubs, eggs, cajun burgers...everything. Its so delicious! Its a little salty and I like salt, but it was too salty for a few family members.

This is really good, just as good as any store-bought Creole seasoning blend. What I love is that you can scale the heat and, most importantly for those of us on a low sodium diet, the salt.   I made mine exactly as written but added no salt to it. When I cook with it I just add the salt separately to taste. A perfect healthy, delicious spice blend!

This is an excellent spice that should be in everyone's cupboard! It IS hot but the flavors still come through! I used it in a pasta dish tonight but can't wait to use this on many dishes in the future. Remember - add this spice to your meal in small increments! More can always be added but it cannot be so easily taken away! Didn't change a thing! Thanks Joslyn!

This is a really nice blend.  Had to omit the onion powder (allergy) and decrease the salt to 2 T.  Being in control of what goes into a seasoning blend is wonderful.  Thanks, Joslyn

A great base recipe for a seasoning I use on so many things! I will cut back on the salt next time, or leave it out completely so I can adjust the amt depending on what I am cooking. You can also use this as a blackened seasoning by adding a little sugar and nutmeg to it!

Delicious! I didn't change a thing. Used on baked tilapia, and the flavor was spectacular. The recipe yielded quite a bit, so I'll be using this again very soon on something. I like the idea of adding less or no salt and cayenne and kicking up the flavor as needed in specific dishes. Will definitely use and make again.

Loved the Creole Seasoning.  Great in the Baked Jambalaya.  Instead of measuring in tablespoons, I used teaspoons in the same amounts.  (I wasn't sure that I wanted a large volume.)  It worked out fine with extra for grilled chicken.

Great seasoning blend.  It makes quite a bit-but it's good to have handy to add to dishes to give it some flavor.

Made Shrimp PoBoys (from this site) and needed creole seasoning.  Didn't have horseradish, but had just purchased a bottle of horseradish powder from Penzy's spices and it worked wonderfully.

Could not find my cajun spice and was in the middle of a recipe which called for it.  This was very good and it smells better than my store bought brand of cajun spice.  Maybe a side by side comparison would be beneficial if I ever have the time to do it.

We used this on tilapia to make blackened fish.  It was overall quite good, but too salty for my tastes.    First, I made the recipe as written, but I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon (to make it kid friendly).  My kids really liked it (even though they said it was spicy, they still ate it up!!).  
Then, I made my husband's and my fish, by adding back about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne to the remaining mixture.  I thought the spiciness level was good, maybe even a little much (just personal preference).  Overall it was good, but I gave it 4 stars because I felt it was way too salty as written.  I will make it again, though, but with much less salt.  You can always add salt once it's cooked, but you can't take it away!

Excellent recipe! The first time I made this I was out of cayenne pepper. I substituted the cayenne for a tablespoon of chipotle chile pepper which turned out incredible. Now I keep both versions on hand. Thank you Joslyn!

This is very good and a close copy cat of Emeril's essence. I happened to have it (Essence) on hand and taste tested the two. This was a just slightly warmer in heat from the cayenne while Emeril's was a little more herby (Thyme-y) and had a little "brighter" flavor. This made a large batch too. I used this to make Cajun roasted potatoes and some cajun meatballs and it really adds some heat. Both dishes turned out fairly spicy and I like lots of spice, but they almost bordered on too much heat for me.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We liked this.  I made it to use in Blackened Shrimp Stroganoff, also from this site.  I made half the recipe, exactly as written which is plenty, since there are just two of us.  I'll be happy to have this on hand to use when a recipe calls for a cajun or creole seasoning.

Easy shortcut.  I made this blend with plans to use it in Shrimp Creole as suggested by another reviewer.  I left out the cayenne pepper because I want to be able to add different amounts to different recipes.  This way I can adjust the "heat" according to who's coming to dinner.  Thank you JOSLYN for sharing your recipe.

Being a Cajun from South Louisiana, this is very close to Tony Chachere's Seasoning blend.  You can add more or decrease to your taste.  I personally add more cayenne for my family.  After mixing all the blends, pulverzie in food processor or blender to make fine powder mixture.  Thanks again for a great blend of flavors!

WOW!!!!! This stuff really ROCKS!!!!! I made up a batch for the "Oven Baked Jambalaya" (on this site) and never realized how much I would use this seasoning. Don't know how I even got along without it. I use it on everything... chicken, chops, stew, popcorn and even stirred it into mayonnaise for a "Cajun Mayo" for sandwiches. My friends and neighbors are getting a jar of this for Christmas next year... I know they'll love it. Try it you'll love it too!

This is a great spice blend!  Not only have I used it for the outstanding Oven Baked Jambalaya recipe but have used it on chicken and tilapia.  I cut the recipe in half so when I use some it is fresh.

This on its own is just so so. I prefer to omit the salt and blend it 50/50 wiih a commercial blend. I find I get a better mix of flavors and lower sodium content allowing me to use it more liberally in my cooking. Very good for the Blackened Shrimp Stroganoff on this site.

I needed a cajun seasoning blend at the last minute and made up a batch of this.  I didn't have the white pepper so I left it out and halved the recipe since I didn't need too much.  I mixed some of this with ranch dressing and used it as a dip with french fries (sounds weird, but sooo good).  Thanks for sharing Joslyn.

Used on chicken breasts, baked in oven and turned out moist and flavorful.  Some may not like the 'heat' but we liked it a lot.

I cannot have salt so I reduced to 1/8th of a teaspoonful.  Was great.  Especially on pork.  If you need low sodium. You could eliminate or reduce accordingly.  Cheers

I used this to make Maple Cajun Mahi Mahi from this site, and it turned out very well. The spice was nice, with a kick, but not too hot to handle. *Update 2/23/17- I make this and keep it on hand all the time. It works well for gift giving too.

Unbelievably delicious. Cut down a bit on the pepper and cayenne.  Used with a bay leaf in butter beans with shrimp and it was outstanding.

not sure it came out as it should, or maybe my spices are old, but didn't seem to be enough. I used it in the Chicken Roche recipe here on Allrecipes.

This is excellent!  I left out the salt because Creole seasoning is usually too salty for me.
Much better than anything you can buy at the store!

The only seasoning I use now.  I like that you can add more spice to make it hot or less to make it more milder for kids.  I have a tuperware of it in my spice drawer now!  Thank you.

A great multi-purpose seasoning blend.  I have used it in jambalaya and on baked checken several times.  I cut back on the pepper because I don't like too much heat and I have a 5 year old who also wouldn't go for hot and spicey. It really gives chicken a nice flavor. When I made this, I doubled the recipe and I just keep it in a ziploc bag in my spice cabinet.  It really does come in handy by adding nice flavor to my foods.

Yum!! I used this seasoning in jambalaya tonight and I believe it made the recipe. We will definitely keep this one on hand. Thank you! Addition: I use this seasoning all the time. It's great for fish! I've also used it on broiled shrimp and in brown rice. It's so fabulous!

I expected this to be a little spicier than it was, that's the reason for 4 stars. Easy to put together, and had a nice mild flavor will definatly make again adding a little more hot to it. Thanks.

I work in the foodservice industry and wanted to make a jambalaya for Fat Tuesday.  I'll review that recipe, too, but I also used this blend on both chicken thighs and tofu cubes.  A word of warning, though: I reduced the cayenne by half and I still felt it was too spicy.  (Most of the customers loved it!  I must be a wimp.)  In any case, just know that this is a very spicy blend.

This is a wonderful spice blend. When I first read
the ingredients I thought this had way too much
heat, but I was wrong, it's the perfect balance. I
have several Cajun recipes that this works so well
on. I've tried Emeril's "Essence" and several other
store-bought creole-blends, but this is by far the
best. Thank you Joslyn for a true 5 star seasoning
blend. Highly recommended!

In reading all the reviews, I took the advice of some of the others and decreased the amount of salt - I think that is why I didn't give it 5 stars since it had the nice kick, full of flavor but it was missing something - to me I think it was the salt.  Will use again but follow the recipe to the T.

This is great!  I use this with about 1/4 cup olive oil as a marinade for chicken and pork.  Even my kids like it, and they are the pickiest ever!

I’ve used this recipe several times, as a sub for store bought.  It’s delicious!  Since my first use I have cut back on the peppers a bit because of my younger kids but it doesn’t detract much from the original flavor. Excellent recipe!

I found this recipe about 6 months ago when my sister-in-law from Louisiana told me that a bottle of prepared creole seasoning is not "real" creole cooking. So I made this up for a recipe I had for shrimp and sausage pasta. It was awesome!  We use this on most things we cook for a flo or boost. The opportunities are endless from veggies, fish, potatoes, smoke rub and so much more. I made

I will definitely make this seasoning mix again; the balance of flavors was spot on for us.  However, it did not have enough spice for a creole seasoning in my opinion.  I have a 9, 10, and 12 year old--two of which added more of Tony's Cajun seasoning to spice it up.  I will add more cayenne next time I mix it up.  And I will be using it again.  Just know that you will have to play with the peppers to find the amount of heat that your family prefers.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I followed it exactly as per the instructions and thought that I would modify if I felt it was required for our household.  I wouldn't recommend changing a thing.  It is definitely not really "hot" but just right for us.  You could even make it a bit hotter.
I have used this for a ton of other things as well.  Great on fish, meats, sandwiches, etc.  Excellent!!

I needed a creole seasoning for the recipe "Simple Baked Chicken Breasts", by Always Cooking Up Something, which is also on this site.  This Creole seasoning blend is absolutely perfect!  You don't need more than a very light coating; just a few pinches on each side for a very light dusting on the two chicken breasts I made!  Scrumptious flavor and I am thinking it would also be awesome on BBQ'd back ribs!  This is a keeper for sure and it keeps in an air tight container too!  I will use it again soon!

I did not make any changes, and it was easy to put together.   As one person stated it's nothing grand, but the great thing about it is that it's so versatile.  It can be used on almost every type of food.  I speak from experience, (although now retired) I owned and operated a 63 seat restaurant for 30 years.  I will make it again.

I made this for a roast turkey I did for my co-workers. I did a 1:1 ratio on all of the ingredients except for salt and paprika.  I left the salt out because I was brining the turkey and it would have been too salty with extra salt. The paprika I did 5:1.  I wanted the flavor to be able to permiate deep into the meat so, I put all of the ingredients into my blendtec blender and turned it into a fine powder. The turkey turned out perfect and all of my co-workers raved about it. There was nothing left of the turkey! Because it's now a powder I may need to add some    to keep it from clumping.

I've been using this basic recipe for a couple of years, usually omitting the salt  and playing with the other seasonings a little- substituting chipotle or New Mexico chili  powder for some of the cayenne. I use it  primarily as a rub for meats, poultry , and fish before grilling or cooking in the slow-cooker. One batch lasts about a month and a half at my house. I wouldn't be without it in my cupboard.

This is great on sweet potato baked fries and adds a big zip to chicken and veggie soups. I, too, leave out the salt and salt on my own. Also, I make big batches to put in small jars to give as gifts, so no-salt is best.

Great spice mix.  Having high blood pressure, I totally omit the salt.  For the Paprika, I use 4 Tablespoons of regular and 1 Tablespoon of Smoke HOT Paprika.  I use it on steaks, chicken, jambalayas, heck just about anything that I want to give a 'little kick'.  Wonderful!  thanks for a really good and super tasty recipe.

I used the change serving button to make "1" serving. Worked perfect for the amount I needed for Allrecipes Chicken Guacamole Melt recipe. Having a 1/8 tsp. measuring spoon, came in very handy. Glad, I didn't have to go to the store to buy Creole seasoning. Thank you

Outstanding!  The recipe makes a good amount which I store in a Ziploc in the fridge.  I used it on baked flounder and after reading reviews, will try it in a dip for veggies.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

A nice spice to have on hand and I like that I made it up myself rather than buying it.  I made up a half batch and stored in a shaker bottle.  I originally made this to use in “Melody’s Corn Maque Choux” another recipe on AR.

I have been to New Orleans a number of times and this is the best Creole seasoning on this site. I've used it quite a few times and love it.

This spice blend was a first try for me, and I slapped it on some nice plain white rice. It wasn't particularily bad, but it just didn't  have a nice appeal to my taste buds. Not to say it was horrible, it's just alright. Didn't have cayenne or white pepper, substituted with some Chili powder instead.

we love Zatarain's gumbo, and I cut the black and white pepper by half and used only a tsp of cayenne (3yo eating this too)  We use spicy smoked sausage and that gave it enough of a kick all by itself.  LOVED IT

Yoewzer!  Made this tonight - put just 2 table spoons paprika and only 1 of salt (I don't use very much salt in anything) and it smells soooo good.  Can't wait to use this - will have to find some suitable recipes !

Great flavor. Used it for our deep-fried turkey and it gave the turkey a wonderful taste and aroma.  Cut  the recipe in half & had more than enough to put all over the almost 12 lb. turkey & inside the cavity.  Marinated it overnight & there seemed to be a lot of liquid.  Had to drain the turkey & pour liquefied seasoning into another bowl before putting the turkey in the deep fryer. Omitted the onion powder since I had none.   Willing to try this blend on other types of meat.

This was really good.  I used teaspoons instead of tablespoons and it still made a lot.  I used it to make southern-style oven-fried catfish from this site.  Just enough of everything, IMO, and I especially liked the onion and garlic powder and black and white peppers.

I needed some creole seasoning for a recipe and found this one.  Oh my, this stuff is great.  It has now replaced almost every spice in my cabinet.  I make it up in quadruple batches and put it on everything.  I LOVE IT!  The only thing I do is cut the cayenne down and substitute lemon pepper for the white pepper (that's what I had on hand)  Wonderful, thanks for sharing!

This is a great blend of flavors.  I used it to season the chicken for "Chicken Jambalaya I" and "Creole Green Beans," both from this site.  I scaled down the recipe quite a bit, but kept the same proportions.  This would be great as a dry rub for chicken, or any other meat!

We loved this! It had just the right amount of hotness-not too much for the kids to handle. Of course, I think it depends on how much you actually sprinkle on whatever you're using it on too! Great recipe, using all of the basics I already had in the cupboard-thank you!

I made this exactly as stated, and I thought it was boring. The oregano and thyme were over powering and I was disappointed after all the great reveiws. I will try something different when I want to use a creole seasoning again. note: I used this to season grilled orange roughy fillets

This was a little salty for me, but otherwise great. I love that I can make my own seasoning and avoid the salt-loaded commercial seasoning blends. Next time I make this I'll just cut out a tablespoon of salt. It'll be a while before I have to make it again though, cause this recipe makes a ton.

This is great!  I made a 1/2 recipe to try this out (and didn't want to use up all my spices in case I didn't care for it).  We loved this in Gumbo Style Chicken Creole.  I can't wait to try it as a grilled chicken rub, too!

I've used this about 5 times, and I kind of wing it every time since I don't have all the peppers, and it turns out great.

This is great, we'll be using it on a regular basis! As another reviewer suggested, we just substitute tsps for tbsps, so it doesn't make a huge batch and stays fresh. We also reduce the salt and pepper, because we prefer having more control over the salt and we like using fresh-ground pepper.

Perfect! Use it all the time on everything--shrimp, beef, poultry and pork as well as in a number of recipes that call for some creole seasoning. Didn't realize I had never reviewed it and I've used this for a few years now!

This is a great spice blend that I use all the time, especially on barbecued foods. I ran across it in a magazine and it is apparently one of Emeril's recipes.

Fantastic and versatile seasoning blend.  I used in the Oven Baked Jambalaya but could be used in place of seasoning salt in any recipe.  I scaled it down to 5 servings and it made plenty for my recipe with some leftover.

This seasoning mix is fantastic!  We first tried it in the Oven Baked Jambalaya and have been in love ever since.  I have replaced my old store bought blend for this and we use it on everything.

WOW!  I'll never buy cajun spice again!  What fun and how easy to mix this up.  And it makes a lot so cheap.  I use buckets of this stuff, and now I can make my own!  Planning on making some for gifts for the holidays.  THANK YOU for sharing this recipe.  And by the way, it is very similar to Emeril's, only more herbs and ratios are a little different.

Love this blend. I’m on my second batch. Black-eyed peas and rice will never be the same. Even on regular steamed rice , I add about a teaspoonful before its done and it’s fabulous. Goes good on steamed or roasted veggies. Thanks so much!!

I used this on a deep fried turkey and it was awesome. I still had some left over so I used it on a roast chicken. Just made another batch to do a chicken. It is now a family favorite.  Love the smell of it!

I have a few recipes that use "creole" or "Cajun" seasoning and I wanted to make my own.  I made it without the salt so I could control the level.  Much better than using store bought!

An excellent blend of spices that work well together. Decreased salt to 2 tablespoons just to lower sodium but still kept very good flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was pretty good. It is very similar to other spice fomulas I've made (emerel's, paul prudomme...) One suggestion, once everything is mixed whirl it in a coffee grinder or food processor to evenly blend it together. Another idea, when using this, season in layers, a little when you sweat the vegetables, a little more when adding other ingedients, a little more when adding liquids, and so on.

I used this for a Keto shrimp and grits recipe ... it was GREAT without being overly spicy. I used 1 T of salt instead of 3, per other people's recommendation that the seasoning was just a bit too salty. I made the entire recipe, and will use the rest for spreading on chicken or pork before barbecueing, etc. Thanks for providing this great seasoning!

This is pretty tasty.  I love making my own seasonings and a Creole/Cajun seasoning base was missing  from my spice cabinet.  Made as written- except had to decrease the cayenne by 1/2 to be all household member friendly.  : )   I used smoked paprika (all I have) which gives the mix a nice smoky flavor.  Used it in my gumbo recipe and will definitely use it as a meat rub adding a little brown sugar and cumin for that.  Thanks for posting this.

My wife discovered this seasoning that I made,  in the pantry and decided to try it....... that was a month ago.  She loves it enough that I just made my second batch today.  My only change is that I cut down on the salt - to one tablespoon, otherwise, this is a great seasoning blend to use on many preparations..... thank you

I seasoned halibut steak with this blend and it turned out tasty. I made 1/3 of the recipe (tsp instead of tbsp) to start just to make sure I really like it to make a large batch. Cooking for 2 people, I only used very little to season the fish. There is still quite a bit left and I kept it in a jar. I used 2 tsp salt instead of 3. I think oregano was a little too overpowering. And we love spicy food. So next time I'll used 1.5 tsp oregano, 1.5 tsp cayenne, and no salt. It should be good for different meat in many recipes including soups and stocks. Thanks for the recipe! It saved me money attempting to buy Emeryl's seasoning.

I use this on almost everything.  I make a big batch and then change it up by sprinkling on more of a particular ingredient or adding something like cumin to change the flavor. It’s the base seasoning for just about everything now.  Guests have loved the flavor. A pinch of sugar when cooking adds a little something too.  I make my base with half the white pepper because it was too spicy for some. Then I just sprinkle some white pepper if making something for adults who like spicy.  Rave reviews on all kinds of different meat and vegetables to.

THANK YOU! I am allergic to black pepper, of all things, so pre-made spice mixes are impossible to use.  I've tried several different creole spice recipes that just never taste quite right... with yours I substituted toasted white pepper for the black and wah-lah... PERFECT on my crawfish! (and chicken, and rice, and...)

Wow and Wow again!! I mixed this up and used it in red beans and rice I made for my vegetarian daughter. I cut back the cayenne to half (cause I am such a wimp when it comes to spicier food).  The recipe was not harmed by adjusting the heat to my taste.  This is beyond a doubt the best recipe spice mix I have ever used. Many Kudos and thank you so much for taking the time to post and share.

We use this creole seasoning on and in many dishes we prepare for our families.  It is our "go to" seasoning for meat, fish and veggies.  We follow the recipe exactly as written for adults, but we also make a milder version for our kids.  Excellent recipe!

I didn't have some of the spices and also needed to tone down the heat so that my kids would eat this.... Used: 4-tbsp Garlic Powder, 1.5-tbsp Oregano, 1.5-tbsp Basil, 3/4-tsp Black Pepper, 1-tsp Cayenne, 4-tbsp Paprika, 2-tbsp Salt. Great seasoning. Used over my tilapia for my Garlic Alfredo Tilapia tonight - yum!

This is a great spice blend (although I often cut back on the cayenne since my daughter doesn't enjoy spicy foods). I use it in the Quick and Easy Black Beans and Rice recipe also found on this site. It is a great combination.

For the first time I made Jambalaya without a mix. I I divided this recipe by half and added it to beef stock.  Then added 6 cups of water along with 4 packets of  chicken stock.  I waited until I had it all at a full boil before adding the rice (2c)  brought that down to a low simmer, covered and let cook 20 minutes.  I didn't have cayenne pepper or white pepper so I kept the full amount of black pepper. I added some sliced precooked sausages.  My son says it's the best Jambalaya I ve ever made.

Good Creole Seasoning to keep on hand and far better than what you will get at the store (no MSG and no additional strange ingredients). I would recommend adding additional amounts of this seasoning blend as needed, per your taste. Start with the amount called for in a recipe and add more as needed. Also, I'll probably leave out the salt next time. It wasn't too salty at all for us, but I find it easier to add salt as needed in the cooking process. Will be making a larger batch to readily keep on hand! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is by far the best Cajun seasoning I have used. I put it in the Cajun Chicken Pasta (recipe found in AR). It has just enough heat but definitely not too much. It can be blended with oil and used as a marinade. Also it would be great mixed with mayonnaise and used as a dip. 5 stars!

Great for Blackened Chicken.
I used this spice blend to make blackened chicken. My husband said, "I could eat this chicken every day and be very happy!"  The only change I made to the recipe was to add a little chipolte pepper to the blend (about half the  the amount of cayenne pepper the recipe calls for).  I will use this spice blend again and again!

Perfect seasoning for chicken. I boil up several lbs of chicken breasts, shred with hand mixer, and add this seasoning to the shredded meat.  The meat is great on top of salads, in tacos, or just as a snack right out of the fridge .

Great combination of spices! It only took me a few minutes to combine the spices, which I already had on hand.  I look forward to adding this to many Cajun dishes.

Just what I needed without having to run to the store. I used a new (for me) Spanish Paprika and found it to be a little overpowering, no problem, will just have to adjust next time. It's nice to be able to adjust the heat level for each dish, THANKS!

I cut the recipe to a 1/3, and it still made a large spice bottle full.

The best seasoning that exists by far. Melt some butter and mix the creole seasoning with the melted butter, eat with fresh bread and you have the best meal in the world. One thing though when done by this recipe the result is way too salty. I would reduce the salt by half.

Made a small batch of this. I used it as a rub on pork tenderloin. It was tasty. My dinner guests all liked it and asked for the recipe.  It had just enough kick  to it. Not too spicy. I did find it a bit salty,but I served a mushroom creme sauce with it so that offset the saltiness. Will make it again, but reduce the salt.

This is my "go to" recipe for Creole seasoning as its much better than ANY kind I've bought in the store! I make a batch and keep it in the cupboard in a jar. I use it regularly. I did cut the salt after the first batch just because I have to watch my salt. It's amazing as is though. No changes necessary otherwise. Thanks for sharing

I made this to add to the easy vegetable soup recipe on this site and it added so much flavor to the soup. My husband loved it! The kids and I found it a tab to spicy hot, but thought the soup was delicious. My husband even started eating the spice out of the container! Try it, if you need a creole seasoning.

I am not big on spicy food,  but this has a little kick without being overbearing.  Next time I'll cut out the cayenne pepper & halve the amount of black pepper for my toddler  I will use this recipe again.

This tastes very close to the premade kind at the store, only fresher.  Delicious!  I used it in the oven baked jambalaya recipe, and put the rest in my nearly empty Creole seasoning jar.  This recipe fills the jar!

I was directed to your recipe via another who recommended your seasoning.  Glad I did.
Easy to make and store in a Tupperware tub.  Nice base flavouring for many dishes.
I did omit the salt and cayenne pepper. Salt due to sodium issues and the pepper for the kids.  
Still tasted great.  Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe. I make a slow cooker chicken creole recipe with it and my whole family loves it. I usually make it as stated, but this last batch I was out of cayenne pepper so I substituted Ancho Chile Pepper and it was still delicious.

Thank you to the previous reviewer for her "kid-friendly" version! As she mentioned, I halved the black pepper, didn't use the cayenne and used kosher salt...it was definitely "kid-friendly" and perfect for our family! Delish!

This has been my "go-to" creole seasoning blend for the last 10 years!!!!! The flavor it creates in foods is AMAZING! The one simple change I make to this recipe? I use SMOKED PAPRIKA! It really makes it all that it can be!!!

I just finished making a andouille and cajun chicken pasta dish that called for cajun seasoning. Instead of a store bought kind, i just mixed all the seasonings I had on hand. The only thing I didn't have was the cayenne or white pepper but I substituted red pepper flakes and I love it! Living in Texas I saves the rest and definitely will be using it on our seafood and chicken dishes!!

This seasoning is wonderful and can be used in many ways. I added white and brown sugar and dry mustard to it and used it as rub for ribs. It was so good. Not a rib left.

Great flavor. I cut the peppers in half and cut one tablespoon of the paprika to suit my family's palate. It was the perfect amount of heat for us.

Didn't have white pepper, doubled the black pepper.  Used on ground turkey.  Ground turkey, bread crumbs, and creole seasoning blend made great turkey burgers.

Awesome!  Used this in "Bubba's Jambalaya" on this site.  Soooooo good!  Much MUCH better than store-bought as you can control the salt content.  I put in only about 2/3 of what is called for so, depending on how I'm going to use it, it still leaves room for addl. salt if needed, but doesn't overdo it in recipes that are already really high in sodium.  Love it!  Thanks Josyln!

I love this, use it for blackened tuna steaks, so easy! A bit too salty for me though, I would highly recommend reducing the salt.

SO GOOD!  I'm not a big fan of spice, so I reduced the amount of pepper - delicious!  Used it in Oven Baked Jambalaya on this site - yummy!  Highly recommended!

Yummy! We like the heat so I left the Cayenne the same. I did use less Paprika & salt. Thanks for a great seasoning blend.

Super easy to make! Makes a ton too. It filled up a one cup plastic freezer (jam size) jar. I used this to make Oven Baked Jambalaya and it seasoned it very well.

I make rotisserie turkey and use this as a dry rub and as a liquid inject sometimes.  It is my husband's favorite.  It turns an okay meal into something I crave.

Although I cut the salt down to one tablespoon, this creole seasoning blend was wonderful. I used this with Joslyn's oven baked Jambalaya.

Great seasoning. I used this in the oven baked jambalaya recipe and it was really good.
