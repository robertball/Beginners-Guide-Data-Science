I substituted wheat flour, added one apple, 1/4 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 cup milk.
I also took it out five minutes early.  Very good breakfast.

I made this for the first time today. After reading other reviews about it "needing something". I happen to have two ripe bananas which I mashed and added together with some walnuts.I also added 1/4tsp of vanilla extract. I would have added milk as suggested, but the bananas made it very soupy.  I left out the milk, and cooked it for the full 30mins. We loved it! Next time I'll add the milk too, just to see which way I like best.

The only changes I made were to use regular rolled oats instead of instant, and to bake it in a glass pie dish. It was delicious, like eating a giant oatmeal cookie. It turned out kind of crumbly, but I don't mind that. It was a great breakfast, but I think it would also be good served as a dessert with ice cream!

There appears to be something missing in this recipe, it was dry and powdery, no wonder there were so meny bad reviews.  However, I added 2 eggs, 2 mashed bananas, a handful of walnuts, and a handful of raisins.  A table spoon of baking powder, a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla, and more cinnamon, and a touch of nutmeg.  This is a keeper, so 5 stars with changes.

mmm...After reading reviews, it seemed this recipe would be dry and crumbly, I just wasn't feeling that this morning. So I halved the recipie, added about 1/2 Tb. extra butter (did not use margarine at all), splashed some milk into the egg before scrambling together (a little less than a 1/3 C.) and added just a splash of vanilla. It came out moist and deliciously. Like a brown sugar cinnamon oatmeal bar. mmm...5 stars after my mods.

Delish! I followed one members advice and added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 cup of milk and one apple. Was very, very good! I only cooked it for 25 minutes and it came out perfect!

These were just ok.  I wasn't impressed.  I threw the recipe away, then the kids and hubby asked me to make them again, since the first batch lasted less than a day.  So, 3 against 1, I guess they are great.  :)

This was good.  Not too sweet, so I didn't feel as if I was feeding a cookie to my kids for breakfast! :)  To combat the dryness, I added 1/4 cup of applesauce and left the rest as is.  It is yummy and is a great way to deal with those kids who are hard to wake up.

I followed other reviewer's advice and used 2 eggs, 2 mashed bananas, extra cinnamon and some nutmeg.  I also added a handful of walnuts and topped half of it with choclate chips.  I loved the choclate topped ones, however it does take over the flavor...but I didn't mind. Super easy and yummy pop and go snack.

I used packets of flavored oatmeal (i.e. Bananas and Cream, Peaches and Cream, etc.) and this came out great!  Like oatmeal cookie bars.  As other people have pointed out, the batter is thick and you don't really "pour" it into the pan but rather press it in.  It's quick and easy and good.

This is a very tastey dish. I did change some things. I added 2 eggs, 1/2 cu butter, more cinnamon, a splash of vanilla extract, and baked it for 10 minutes insted of what the recipe said. I made it for breakfast for my sisters and they loved it! I dont get why people rated it so badly...I guess they dont have taste buds. Oh well, it was freakin awesome. This is the teen signing off. ttyl

The batter was very thick and I could not pour it
into the pan as the directions state.  It was hard
to spread into the pan.  Baked up kind of dry and crumbly.  If I make this again I would try adding
some milk or maybe another egg.  My husband loves oatmeal cookies but he didn't ooh and ahh over this one!

Its so good. I did read the reviews that it needed something, so I added apples, a little extra cinnamon, a squirt of honey, and a shot of pear cider. I was also out of brown sugar and I used regular white sugar instead. It turned out great! I think I'll wait to add the honey as a glaze next time so it comes out a little more crisp, but excellent.

After reading reviews about being dry & needing something more, I too added banana. I also baked a second one using 2 cups of homecanned apple pie filling. Yum. One could probably use peach or cherry pie filling as well. If I did it, I'd probably add a dash of almond extract for those. I won't say for sure how long to bake-my oven's inconsistent. Around 20 to 30 minutes I'd guess.

I thought it was good, but I made some changes. I added 1/2 cup of milk, 1 tsp of vanilla like several others said to do, and then I added about a handful of pitted fresh cherries. My kids devoured it with the changes. It will become a staple when our cherries trees are ripe.

We, too, found this recipe "just ok" in taste.  Served at room temperature with cold milk or hot coffee the flavors are enhanced. We experienced all of deficiencies sited by other reviewers.  It definitely needs something additional.

There wasn't enough to fill an 8x8 pan completely, it looked unappetizing and tasted even worse.  What a waste of time, and ingredients.

This tasted really good right out of the oven but as soon as it cooled.. it was the dryest crumbly crumbs ever!  I won't make this again.  I was really thinking it might be like oatmeal cookies but.. it's NOT.

Me and a friend actually found this recipe to be tasty, although simple. It could be crumbly if you over cook it (I cooked it for 5 minutes less than called for) I also wouldn't offer it in the car, I think the recipe is meant to be more like a granola bar, but i like it soft.  I will try it again with dried fruit and nuts.

Like previous reviewers, I was disappointed with this recipe. The batter did not pour as instructed (too thick) and the final product was dry and crumbly with very little flavor. Definitely not a keeper.

This was more like an enormous oatmeal cookie, but very dry and not very flavorful.  I wouldn't make it again.

Just ok. Made it as written. I should have heeded the other reviews. It was dry and crumbly. It is essentially an oatmeal cookie in a pan. I already have an oatmeal cookie recipe that I love so I don’t see the point in trying it again.

Great and quick. Made it as stated the first time and ended up pouring fruit syrup (Saskatoon berry for one kid, strawberry for the other) on it. My kids loved it more when I added 2 mashed bananas and a handful of chocolate chips. Husband loved it the time I added a cup of mixed berries and 1/2 cup apple sauce. This is a great base recipe that you can change anyway you want! Walnuts, 1 banana and 1/4 cup maple syrup made for a very sweet maple walnut style dish. Chia seeds or flax are always a great addition in my house.

Meh. It was good straight out of the oven - I followed others suggestions and used 2 eggs, mashed banana, and about 1/4c cashew milk. Baked in a 9" pie plate 30 minutes. 
Again, it was good the first day... but the leftovers, not so much.  Relatively healthy though!

Terrific! Not too sweet, but sweet enough.  ACTUALLY stayed in the shape of a bar when I cut it.  Siblings loved it!  Going to be a regular breakfast option.  I quadrupled the recipe and put into two 9 by 13" pans.  I also added a little ginger and cinnamon and used bleached all-purpose flour.  I baked it at 375 degrees because I was running short on time.

After looking at the recipe, like so many others I thought it needed something, so I added a sprinkle of nutmeg and some wheat germ. I literally could not stop eating it! It's been my go to breakfast food for weeks, and it seems to taste great with whatever you add. I put light maple syrup in instead of the nutmeg a few times, not quite as good. Milk makes it more cakey, otherwise it seems to turn out as a dry crumble.

It is just a giant oatmeal cookie for breakfast. I've made this twice and it turned out dry tasting  both times. I didn't have any brown sugar so I used white sugar. Other than that followed the recipe.

I've made this a few times now, and it's always a hit. I stick pretty much with the recipe, bite I keep the 1/2 of oats scant and top it off with chopped pecans. Then I throw in just a handful of dried cranberries and a few dried apricots that I partially rehydrate in hot water and cut up small and mix in with everything else.  Don't overdo the additions or it changes the character of the crisps too much. You just want a little pop of flavor.

I doubled everything except the sugar and used a 10*10 silicon pan. Talking about the sugar, here's what i did: I creamed 1/2 cup of brown sugar with the butter, then diced a gigantic apple and tossed with another 1/4 cup of brown sugar. The apple was folded into the oat-butter mixture as the last step before I pop the tray into the oven. It turned out great, just like a apple-cinnamon oat bar. Maybe I'll do it again if I have a lot apples to kill.

I made this for my family one morning (mom, dad, my brother, and me). I agree with the other reviews, you have to be a little bit creative to make this recipe work. I couldn't find a cake pan, so I used a cupcake pan, and everyone loved it! Especially with the extra egg and vanilla extract.

Read reviews first before baking. Added 1/2 cup of milk, 1/2 cup applesauce, and a little vanilla and took it out five minutes early. Was more like a moist crumbly cake. I liked it. Would go good with ice cream.

I made this gluten-free by making it with gluten-free flour instead of regular and it was very yummy.  Next time, I'll make it on a baking pan so it will be a little thinner.

I used three cups of Rice Krispies instead of oatmeal and added an extra egg. There wasn't anything left after breakfast, not even crumbs

This is a staple in our home. We tried banana but prefer adding a diced apple and using real butter. Lots of fiber and adding egg for protein makes it stick with us for school!

This recipe was pretty good!  I thought it would be more like a scone, but the way I made it turned out to be more of a cake. I also added the apple, vanilla, and milk, but I added 1/4 cup more brown sugar.  Put a little Cool Whip on top and Mmmmm...

This was nice. I also added the apple, vanilla and milk.  I served it with yogurt on the side.  Nice treat from the regular blah breakfast cereal.

I added 1 cup milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla also.  The kids loved it and it was quick and easy to prepare. Will definately add it to the breakfast lineup.

The recipe as is isn't very good. It was good with some butter spread over the top right out of the oven, but as soon as it cooled, it was crumbly and flavorless.  It would be good with some apple pie filling and ice cream on top and served as a dessert rather than the way intended.

I forgot the butter only because I was in a rush... but it was great! But I did add 1 cup of milk and 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and I put it in my glass pie dish. Really GOOD!
