I was reading this recipe and it sounds great,, but why are we preheating oven in step 1 if these are not baked?

The principle was great, but this way FAR too sweet for my family's taste. I use natural PB without any sweeteners, and I still think even leaving out the brown sugar entirely would be plenty sweet enough. I'll try it again without the sugar, but as written, I think it's only just 'ok'. Sorry.  :-(

Hi, Rachelle, you could omit the peanut butter, but this recipe needs a "binder", something to hold it together, and the flavor would be altered.  Play with it, and send back any results.
Read your review Kristin, and your right, the pic. does not match the recipe, however, there are other pics. there, and one of them is mine.  Please check it out.

Easy to make and they taste good too.  And the recipe is easily modified.  I don't like coconut so I left it out and I didn't have any rice crispy cereal so I used corn flakes instead.  I added almonds to th dry ingredients and a little maple syrup to the brown sugar/honey mixture.  I liked them so much I made a second batch and added some dark chocolate.  When mixing the wet and dry ingredients I started out using a spatula but moved using my hands to finish combining them.

Great granola bar! I used light corn syrup instead of the honey and was very satisfied with the result. I also wanted to add chocolate chips to the bars but I didn't want them to melt when I stirred them into the hot mixture. Instead I mixed everything as the directions said and laid down a layer of granola, sprinkled chocolate chips on top, patted down another layer of granola, chips on top of that, and then a final layer of granola. makes a very thick and chewy granola bar, much better than those paper thin ones from other recipes.

Based on other reviews and my personal preference to minimize excess sugar I eliminated the brown sugar all together and just added a second teaspoon of vanilla. I opted to save time and microwave the peanut butter and honey in a glass bowl for 30 second incriminates for about 2 minutes...then you can just toss all the ingredients in one bowl. These are really tasty! There is a yummy  nutty flavor and if you use sunflower seeds that are salted the flavor pops even more! A definite keeper and recipe that I will make often!!

These were easy to make but really really sweet. Will make again but will definitely cut way back on the sugar the next time.

I have tried this recipe twice now and it is very good! I omitted the sunflower seeds because I didnt have any but added a bit more coconut because i love coconut. One person commented something about preheating the oven in step 1? Must have been some other recipe they were reading or it has been corrected since the comment. They are soft and chewy and stay very well at room temperature in a sealed container.

This recipe is great!  Why have I not tried making granola bars at home before this.  It was so easy.  I did change it up slightly, but that's the nice thing about this recipe, you could make it in many different varieties.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of applesauce as well as 1/2 cup of ground flax seeds.  Didn't have sunflower seeds, but used chopped peanuts once and walnuts another time.  I used chocolate chips in place of the raisins once and used the raisins the second time.  It was great both times.  Kids and husband gobbled it up.  You could easily add several Tbsp of brewers yeast and make these into yummy lactation bars!

I only used the first 6 ingredients. I actually used some southern style-Delta Cane flavor syrup(found in pantry, and needed to use up). I also chopped up about 1 cup of roasted almonds. These bars came out so good! Exactly what I was looking for and had the taste for. Great no-bake granola bar!

It is plenty sweet without any sugar at all.....I used about 2 cups of peanut butter and  about 2 cups of rice cereal and oats but no nuts or fruits (just the chocolate chips) and added 6 large scoops of Protein powder. Mixed everything in one bowl after heating up the honey with the Peanut butter in the microwave and it worked well.

Mixed in a few large marshmallows with the honey and sugar to give them more of a Rice Krispy treat texture/taste.  Soccer team snack!

I omitted the brown sugar as per other people's review, as well as the coconut since I didn't have any. I also used 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. I substituted the sunflower seeds with roasted soybeans. Good!

These were great and so easy! I only used 1/4 c. of brown sugar and they still seemed very sweet. I think I'll skip the brown sugar next time.

OMG!!  These were so frickin good!  I used plain Cheerios in place of the rice cereal and a mixture of chopped walnuts, pecans and peanuts in place of the sunflower seeds, left out the coconut since I didn't have any and they came out perfectly. At first it seemed like the mixture was not going to hold together as it was a bit crumbly, but once I PRESSED it in the pan and let it set for 15 minutes it came out to be a perfecly held-together granola bar. I love the fact that these are no-bake and ready within a matter of minutes to be eaten.  Awesome recipe!!

These were AWESOME!!! I added almonds and dry cranberries instead of raisins. That's what I had on hand. Also, sprinkled a tab bit of ground flax seed on top with a few sesame seeds. Hub loved them...I will definitely make these again. Thanks cowgirl40

Loved this recipe!! 
I done everything by direction, my ONLY alteration to the recipe itself was I used an assortment of dried fruits plus raisins (mixed both to make the amount called for in recipe).
That's what I REALLY like about this recipe is you can "work" with it to add or remove what you like best in regards to the dry ingredients.
I really liked the fact that it was sweetened by honey and brown sugar and the fruit. So not alot of harsh sweets.
The only thing I would suggest is when your mixing everything, at the point that it gets hard to mix, switch to needing the mixture. that seemed to work pretty good in getting everything combined for pressing into pan.

ALL in ALL.... I WILL be making this again. I have already started sharing it with others!!
Great recipe. Thank You Cookiegirl40!
