I LOVED this recipe!!!!  We love tomatoes so I added a 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and a can of diced tomates (drained).  Next time I will probably add more cabbage.  It was SO good my husband could have ate the whole panful himself!  This is the best recipe I've found on here!!!

This was very good, although I had to make many changes to match what I had in the fridge.  I used ground turkey, chicken stock, cole slaw mix, and brown rice, jar tomato sauce instead of the V8, and a mix of curry and cayan pepper instead of the soup mix.  But it was excellent, my boyfriend called it "a keeper", and there is PLENTY left so I froze some for another night.

Pretty good!  Good for a cold winter day.  I used real garlic, and skipped the onion soup mix.  I used tomato sauce instead of the juice cocktail.  I also used brown rice instead of white, so I had to add more water and cooking time.  I wish that I had used more cabbage.  So actually, I did change quite a bit, but that's okay; still a good base recipe that lends itself to adaptation.

What I loved most about this recipe is that it only required one skillet from start to finish. No browning in one pan and boiling in another. It's great for large families and limited time/energy. Very simple to prepare and 110% better than hamburger helper.
I substituted the hamburger for ground turkey and the beef broth for chicken but otherwise followed the recipe and the result was great! My kids loved it (even my 2 year old cleaned her plate)

This is an easy and comforting meal for a weeknight. I didn't measure anything, just sauteed some garlic, browned 92% lean ground beef, added shredded cabbage, a can of chopped tomatoes, water and beef buillon. Served over rice. Thanks for sharing this idea.

My husband and I enjoyed this very much.  It was very mild so I added just a splash of spaghetti sauce and topped it with Parmesan and Cheddar/Jack Cheese.  We will have this again on a regular rotation.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Made this last night and as many other reviewers have said...great one pot meal! I like a few others used brown rice (what I had on hand), so I increased the amount of liquid. The only thing I would change for next time would be to put the cabbage in (and perhaps add a bit more) halfway thru the cooking process as I like it to have a bit more bite to it. My husband thought this was fabulous! Thank you BINGOMOMMA56 for posting this easy recipe!

Overall, this was a great recipe. I used 3 frozen hamburger patties (Bubba Burger brand, vidalia onion flavor) instead of the ground meat, since it contains extra seasoning and is fairly easy to cook up. Also, just so you know, a 11.5 oz. (small can) of V8 juice is the perfect amount to use. Instead of white rice, I used brown to make this a bit more healthy. Everyone in the family enjoted this, some of us decided to add diced tomatoes and also thought that sour cream & shredded cheese would be good to add as well. We all agreed that this recipe is a lot like chili/sloppy joe/stuffed peppers. This made for a great 4th of July dinner!

Very easy to make and tasted great.  I added some shredded cheddar cheese on top, that of course made it taste even better.  Love the one pot dinner.

I just made this today I have to say it was very good however the next time I will use tomato sauce instead of the vegetable juice and also add a chopped green pepper to the onions and I also used fresh garlic. My mom passed away few months back and she made the best stuffed cabbage and always cooked a green pepper with it I wanted to try something like this because I have no patience to be rolling cabbage so this was somewhat close to her flavor but with a few changes it will be just the same. I'll definitely make this again :)

My mother made this tonight and I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was amazing with a little cheddar and sour cream on top. I'm not a fan of golabki so I was leary of this recipe. Nothing to be worried about! Great on a cold winter day.

I followed the recipe, except I had 4 cups of cabbage and I used 1- 15.6 oz  of diced tomatoes for the vegetable juice. My husband and I really loved it. Once the ingredients  were chopped and ready to go, it came together fast. I did mine in a Dutch oven on top of the stove, since I had more cabbage, I needed more depth, than my skillet allowed. 
I think this would be a great dish to bring to a pot luck , it would travel well and serves lots of people. I love traditional cabbage rolls, but can't be bothered rolling  , when this tastes so great. The only thing I may try next time is adding a small can of sauerkraut, my Grandma always added a can of kraut to her cabbage rolls as they simmered on the stove . Yummy!

i used long grain rice, so i par boiled it first.  cooked chopped onions w/beef.  did not use broth. sauteed the cabbage in bacon drippings.  stirred everything together, put in a casserole dish and added homemade tomato sauce and a small can of v8.  came out perfect for us.  thanks for the post BINGOMOMMA56!

Just plain awesome!!  How can you beat a one pot meal that  is inexpensive, quick to make, and tastes fantastic.  I love cabbage rolls but never have time or skill to make pretty ones.  Be careful to check your pot frequently...i ended up taking mine off the stove after 20 min. It would have been mush if I hadn't been so excited to taste it!

Loved this and have made it several times now.  I renamed it "Deconstructed stuffed cabbage" since that's the term the TV chefs are using these days.  Left out the onion soup mix and used Lundenburg's Parmesan Risotto (threw in the uncooked rice package and seasoning mix) in place of the rice.  Delish!

This was a great new recipe I found for ground beef! I made a few changes:
I used 4-5 cloves fresh garlic instead of the powder, and I used orzo instead of rice and it came out wonderful.  My kids even liked it.  It's a great homestyle recipe with inexpensive ingredients that is very filling and tasty.

Wife and I both enjoyed this quick, easy recipe.

Did not have beef broth on hand and used chicken, recipe came out fine.   Vegetable broth would probably have been fine as well.

I substituted brown rice for the white rice but other than that followed the recipe. I thought it was a great recipe that was super easy to make (walked in the door from groceries and dinner was on the table in less than 45 minutes). I love cabbage rolls but hate dealing with rolling them in the cabbage. This is a great alternative, same taste just much easier. DH would have ate all of it if I let him! Oh yes, I also added some paprika when browning the beef.

Stumbled on this when I was searching of a way to use some cabbage.  So glad to say this exceeded my expectations and we will be having this again soon.  Only change was making my own dry onion soup mix (4 teaspoons beef bouillon granuals, 8 teaspoons dried onion flakes, 1 teaspoon onion powder and 1/4 teaspoon pepper).

Made this tonight great recipe.  I did make a few changes...used ground turkey, had a package of Knorrs Dirty Rice and used it instead of regular rice.  Great recipe thanks for sharing.

Made as directed. This dinner was acceptable, but I personally didn't find it great. It was filling and relatively cheap to make, and it made a lot. Though I somewhat dread eating this for lunch for the next few days. The smell of it lingering in the kitchen reminds me of a cafeteria.

2 20 15 ... .http://allrecipes.com/recipe/75394/unstuffed-cabbage-dinner/ ,,, Easily adaptable recipe.  I made some changes, but not so much that I feel my review isn't valid.  I used 2c regular (cooked) rice, adding it for the last ten minutes.  Increased cabbage to three or three plus cups (about 1/2#, 1/4 a medium head) since I only used half pound ground beef.  I used a cup & a quarter beef broth (since I didn't need the additional liquid for the instant rice).  Subbed an undrained can of rotel for the whatI'mthinkingis V8 (Yuck).  I used half t each garlic powder & black pepper - being wary of the rotel's effect.  Taste:  I liked it better before the tomato addition.  It's nearly medium heat with the half t black pepper & rotel.  Hearty, pretty inexpensive meal.  Adding more broth & vegetables & you'd have a really good soup, I think.  :)

My roommate loved this, but I probably wouldn't make it again. The flavor was too simple for me. This would be good with a taco seasoning mix thrown in also.

Live down south and have 4 heads of cabbage in the garden left to harvest (3/5/2015).  Been making coleslaw regularly, but wanted to try something different.  Found this recipe and followed it to the letter, except I added a half a head of freshly harvested cabbage instead of just the two cups in the recipe.  I must say, this was awesome!!  After 30 minutes of simmer, however, the mixture was still very liquid so I added just a bit more rice (thin layer on top of the mixture and stirred it in) and after 50 minutes the liquid was absorbed.  I will absolutely fix this meal again.

I loved this. I made to recipe except I probably used a lot more cabbage. I didn't measure, I just chopped up half a head. I also added about a 1/2 a cup of water because it seemed to be cooking down a little too fast. It was great served with some Frank's red hot sauce on top and a little shredded cheese.

YUM!  Though I might cut back on the black pepper next time.  I decided to double the recipe at the last minute since we have 6 people in our family (totally unnecessary as it makes A LOT!), and used a can of tomato soup concentrate + enough water to make the total volume as a substitute for the can of tomato juice.  Will be making this again.

I love this recipe and so does my family and 1 & 3 yr old!  It is easy and is a perfect weeknight meal.  I use the spicy V8 and have used brown rice before too.  I also use more cabbage...I don't measure, I just use either a big or medium head.  Yum!

This gets only four stars for flavor, but five stars for ease. I LOVE these one pot meal. Like others, I made this healthier by using ground chicken instead of beef and brown rice instead of white (which necessitates using an additional cup of liquid and cooking for 50 minutes) . I also used a full onion, garlic cloves instead of powder, pure tomato juice instead of vegetable cocktail, and added a dash of soy sauce. This is very-kid friendly - even my pickiest eater had doubles.

I really liked this!!! I made a few minor changes...I used turkey instead of beef, omitted the pepper because I hate it, used beef boullion cubes and water instead of broth, and omitted the chopped onion because I was being lazy and I figured the onion soup mix would be sufficient...and it was. This was a hearty, tasty, and very easy meal!! Will make again :)

Very good stuff. I made this on Sunday evening since I had  a huge head of cabbage that needed to be used. Threw it in the freezer for dinner tonight. Really tasty and was quick and easy to make.

This was a great dinner and enough for leftovers! Just make sure to use low sodium beef broth and no extra salt. The onion soup has plenty for taste.

I made this last night and it is easy and it is nice that it is in one pan.  I was worried it was going to be salty, but I actually had to add seasoning.  The rice and cabbage must of sucked it up.  I made the recipe just as stated except I didn't have instant rice just the regular kind and it worked fine.  My husband thought it was good, my 13 year old picked at it my 16 year old ate it.  I just thought it was ok and I love stuffed cabbage rolls.  I know they take more time to prepare, but I think it is worth it.  Thanks for the recipe it would be good in a pinch, but I don't think I'll be making it any time soon.

It was really good. Everyone had 2nds and my teenager said “it’s bomb” I did up the cabbage, used 2 cloves fresh garlic, 1 can of diced tomatoes and used a can of tomato sauce instead of the cocktail juice. I also used regular rice instead of instant and didn’t add the cabbage until about half way through.  We’ll definitely have this again.

It was so good! Personally, it needed a little something so I added some scotch bonnet hot sauce and it was fantastic. A friend said it tasted just like goulash without the noodles. Highly recommend this recipe.

I made this today and both my husband and I really enjoyed it! I did have to make a few substitutions because I didn’t have everything in my cupboard and I didn’t measure anything lol. I didn’t have a lot of beef broth so I also mixed in some chicken broth and beef stock and instead of vegetable juice, I used tomato juice. Everything else was as the recipe was written and it turned out great! Will definitely be making this again.

This tends to be a bit on the bland and watery side.  If you make it with a jar of ragu and no tomato sauce, omit the onion soup mix and add taco seasoning to the ground beef its great!.  I put mine in a 9 x13 pan and add cheese to the top and brown its awesome.

What a quick and easy recipe. My husband and I loved it. The only changes I made were to add a can of diced tomatoes with green pepper and onions, and add a liberal amount of Italian seasoning and I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. The recipe made a good amount and we will have it again later this week. I imagine it will taste even better once all the flavors have a chance to mingle. I will definitely add it to my list of favorites.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Would’ve been great without the onion soup packet.  It was VERY salty but had great potential

Made as directed and it was great! More cabbage could be added to stretch it further and still have a rich taste. Sprinkled some cheese on top. This could be modified in many ways to please the individual family!!

I love stuffed cabbage rolls but they are kind of a pain to make so I’m glad I found this receipe. It’s actually very similar to a strata casserole that I frequently make. The strata is also more work but is topped with bacon (yum!) The only change I made to this recipe was that instead of tomato juice, I used a can of el pato hot tomato sauce which added a nice spicy kick. Maybe I’ll top it with bacon next time because I will make it again.

This was just o.k.  I added sauerkraut, bacon and caraway for a more authentic flavor, but it didn't come close to my babcha's cabbage rolls.

This takes me way back. My practice-husband's family was big on Cabbage rolls, but I just didnt have the patience to roll more than a few and not overly skilled to get the rolls tight....so unintentional Unstuffed cabbage dinner they became! Now, i can do it on purpose!
The recipe was good as is, but I would add some bayleaves next time , as my MIL always swore by bayleaves for cabbage roll flavor

We loved this! We also used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce in place of the vegetable juice. I also added some Worcestershire sauce to taste and three bay leaves. Next time I'm going to add a little green pepper as well.

Used ground turkey instead of beef, doubled the cabbage, could have used even more.  Only had instant brown rice on hand. Did not use the tomato juice. Used 8oz can tomato sauce, and maybe 1/4 cup of water.  Added a thin layer of sauerkraut on top, mix in when serving.  Nice meal, probably low in calories and low points if your a weight watcher! Will make again.

Made this exactly as per directions and ingredients. It did not  come close to tasting  any where near any type of cabbage rolls.  It went in the garbage.
This has potential, by doubling the cabbage (but do not shred) cut the rice in halve and use  some tomatoes (as per the picture shown).

I like meals I can cook one time and eat off of the whole week....this works and it's very good.  Only things I did different were;  didn't have minute rice so used boil in bag rice and slightly undercooked it.  I used a bag of shredded cabbage for cole slaw instead of chopping head cabbage....even easier!  I also added about 1/4 cup of ketchup with the v8 juice.  When slightly undercooked on the stove top, I divided into two casseroles, froze one and topped the other with cheese and baked about 15 minutes.  Next time I will try it with ground turkey or chicken!

I really liked it but added cayenne pepper, Italian seasoning, and dried basil. Instead of using the tomato juice I used one can of tomato sauce and one can of diced tomatoes.

Made this ahead of time so don't know how the family likes it yet, but thought it was very peppery. Used almost 4 cups of cabbage and added a can of tomato soup to give it more flavor.

I did this in the slow cooker after browning the meat, and it worked out great.  Two out of 3 kids loved it and even had seconds.  While it was cooking, I ended up adding twice the beef broth and twice the tomato sauce (instead of juice cocktail) because it seemed like it would be a little too dry otherwise.  It didn't turn out soupy at all, it was nice and thick.

I've made something similar before but really liked this recipe better. The seasonings added more flavor...I added more garlic power and a splash of Worcestershire sauce as well. I used  ground pork/ground beef because I had that on hand. Added an extra 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce as I didn't have the tomato/veggie juice. I had a pkg of ground pork/beef 2.25 lbs. so I doubled the recipe. It made enough for the Army.

We really liked this meal.  I've made a similar recipe that included rice.  Next time I will add the rice.
I also liked making it and leaving it in the skillet rather than into a casserole dish and in the oven.
I always cook my cabbage on top of the stove for about 10 minutes before adding to a recipe like this.

I really loved this recipe. I made some slight alterations both in how I prepared it and ingredients. I only did this due to what I had on hand, and time. I followed the recipe close to the same, but I shredded a full half head of cabbage. I used 2 small cans of Beef Broth, I did not have an onion, so I omitted that. I added extra garlic powder and some Tastefully simple Garlic Bread seasoning. I did not measure these spices; I simply shook them over the ground beef as I was  browning it. I made this with 1.5 pounds of ground beef. After adding the french onion soup mix and beef broth, and bringing it to a boil; I then poured everything into my crock pot. I oiled my crock pot with Extra Virgin Olive Oil very generously. I then added a cup of brown rice, a half cup of shredded cabbage, and 1.5 cups of Ragu spaghetti sauce. This then cooked on high in my crock pot for an hour, and came out perfectly!! This meal was absolutely delicious and very hearty!! I will definitely make this again and bring it to Pot lucks at church.

Yum... reminded me of my Mom's cabbage rolls.  Hers were heavy on the tomato flavor, so I added a can of Rotel & a can of crushed tomatoes.  I used an entire head of cabbage & added worchestershire sauce & crushed red pepper for more flavor.  I don't buy  instant rice, so I made the rice separately; using beef broth as the liquid.  I will definitely make it again...

I made this tonight and even my 3 year old liked it. It was quick and easy. I couldn't find tomato cocktail so used 1/2 can of tomato sauce. The only thing it was missing is a little color. The color was bland. I just like colorful food. It was missing something red.

Made this last night for supper and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe as written but found it had too much rice and not enough cabbage so next time I make it I will only put in 1/2 cup of rice and up the cabbage to 3 cups. Other than that it was delicious! Can substitute tomato juice for the V8.
Follow Up:  Aug.31/15. Made it again with the above mentioned changes and it was fabulous!

Delicious!  Comfort food at its best.  Only one change made....I subbed Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage for the ground beef.  That seemed to really kick it up.  My husband was going back for thirds until he realized he was full.  I'll most definitely make this easy and wonderful dish again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this exactly as is and give it 4 stars.  I made changes after I made it as written and would give it 5 with the changes.  I added a can if crushed tomatoes and extra pepper.  I also added a dash of paprika, garlic salt, a splash of white vinegar and a small spoon of brown sugar.  Delicious!

I used several substitutions & additions, from others' suggestions. I used a can of Mexican tomato sauce (el pato) and omitted the tomato juice cocktail & also added a can of diced tomatoes w/ green chilies, which I drained first before adding. I also added diced bell pepper, mushroom, garlic & paprika & replaced the ground beef w/ ground turkey. As in the recipe, I did add some garlic powder as well as a package of onion soup mix. I added a splash of red wine & a little brown sugar. I substituted chicken broth for the beef broth and cooked the rice separately. It was a lil sweet & spicy, with a yummy tomato broth. It was a great way to use up some cabbage in the fridge leftover from st. Party's day corned beef & cabbage. My hubby had seconds & asked what it was & said it was really good :)

Very yummy. My 6 and 9 year old both had seconds. Based on others reviews I used 8 oz tomatoes sauce in place is the vegetable juice and used one can of diced tomatoes drained. Before serving I drizzled on some cream and mixed. Delicious! If gluten free like our family, verify the soup mix is gluten free as many are not.

I have to qualify my five stars.  I loved it.  Two in my family hated it.  One said it was ok.

I used 98 pct lean ground chicken w 8 oz chopped mushrooms.  I deglazed w red wine, used cooked white rice, tomato soup instead of v8, and chicken broth.

Coking low fat and without beef, I find mushrooms and deglazing the pan w wine go a long way to add flavor.  

Final tip is I don't drink wine, but keep those little four packs handy for cooking.

Recipe was good and very easy.  I used 3 cups of cabbage instead of two and even my picky husband who doesn't like cabbage ate this up.  Much quicker and easier than traditional cabbage rolls, but really is a totally different meal that is not comparable.

It was ok, but we found it to be way too salty with onion soup mix. It's great for someone living on a budget since it uses alot of pantry items and a cheap cut of meat. Heathy with the addition of cabbage. An all around complete one pot meal. I also think it makes alot than just 4 servings. I have leftovers, enough for another meal or to freeze for an easy go-to option. Thanks for sharing.

This was a very good quick and easy dinner.  I used a box of long grain and wild rice mix and just added the seasoning packet instead of the soup mix, along with some onion powder.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef.

We loved this.  I added chopped onion and used tomato sauce instead of V8.  No onion soup mix either ... I didn't have any.  Makes a lot for 2 people, but we managed to eat it all  :)  Will definitely make again.

I didn't measure, but I did mix my ground meat like I usually do to make stuffed cabbage with egg, onion, ketchup, garlic powder, salt, pepper to taste and rice. I layered skillet with cut up cabbage then meat mix then more cabbage. I covered with 1 can tomato soup and water cooked it until cabbage and rice were done. Served with mashed potatoes and my husband said it was a keeper. Good for a quick meal.
