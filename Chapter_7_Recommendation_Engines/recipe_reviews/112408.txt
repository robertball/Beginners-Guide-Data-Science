I made these for thanksgiving and they were a huge hit! My husband and I love beets but i have never had them prepared like this before, but i loved the apple, and the holiday spicing was wonderful! Just the right amount of spicy and sweet. I will definitely make this again and again!

Freezing ahead of time was the initial appeal for me, but these were really good using fresh beets, and I wanted you to know that I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend and it was still great.  Looking forward to just thawing and serving this at holiday time!

It was nice to try beets in a new way.  We love them steamed with butter and salt and this recipe was delicious too.  Definitely very "holiday-ish", I might reduce the cloves to just a pinch next time since that flavor came through the strongest.

These were pretty good.  They tasted bitter when hot, but when they cooled down, they were sweet and tasty.  That said, it seems to me that beets are one of those foods that people have very set ideas about, either you like them or you hate them.  My husband and sons wouldn't touch them and my 33 yr old husband made horrible gagging noises after tasting one on my request (this is very out of character for him).  The baby and I liked them quite well though.

These couldn't be better.  The only change I made was to use honey instead of brown sugar, and the result was amazing.  I let them simmer while I made the rest of our meal, and then let them sit to cool a bit before serving.  So they were not hot when I served them, but warm, and everyone loved them.  The flavor is excellent, and I am sure I will be making these again and again.  Yet another wonderful way to eat beets!

I have never cooked beets before and was looking for a good recipe for my first test.  We got the beets without the greens and many of the recipes called for the greens, so I chose this one.  It was FANTASTIC!  We will definitely be making this again in our house.  I made no changes to the recipe.  My beets did take longer to cook but my sliced beets may have been thicker.

This was a very easy recipe and my family loved it. I used fresh beets. I boiled them until fork tender then plunged them into ice water to peel them. I used my egg slicer to cut them the perfect size. Then followed the recipe. I made them in the morning and just reheated them for supper. Yummy! I am now a beet fan!

These were just OK for me - others liked them better than I did but to be fair, I am not big into 'sweetened' vegetables.   Thanks, I made this for the Western Region Faceless Frenzy July 2012

I made this recipe for a family gathering. Everyone already loves beets, so this was a welcome change. I doubled the recipe, except the vinegar, increasing the water to make up the difference. It was just right! 
The sauce is also very beautiful.

I needed to use up some fresh beets and found this recipe. Followed it exactly, except I substituted maple syrup for the brown sugar. Served it for dinner along with chicken and potatoes, and everyone liked it.

Well if you love beets, I'm sure you'd love these.  At first i wasn't overly impressed.  They are good though, the kids liked them. 
There is something mildly addictive about them.... i think its the warm cinnamon that does it for me.

This is good but I think maybe a pinch of salt might help the flavours.  I just made it and will serve it tomorrow at Canadian Thanksgiving Dinner.

Great way to serve fresh beets.  I'm not a huge beet lover and this recipe won me over.  Maybe a little sweet so next time I'll try using 2 Tbsp of brown sugar.  I had enough to freeze so I'm going to try out that method as well (only 2 of us).  I used 3 different kinds of beets (1 each of red, white and red/white) so don't know if that made a difference regarding the sweetness.  I'm going to share this with my friends who grow beets in their home gardens.  Thank you for the recipe.

We made this for Chrismas dinner, and will definitly be making it again. we added 2 cut up apples in at the last stage and cooked until tender, served hot. even the beet haters in the family liked it. The recipe is great as it is, but I do like the added apple.

I wanted to try this because though I am a big fan of beets- they are not very versatile (every recipe seems to be pickled or roasted with goat cheese!) Only change I made was to use maple syrup. Found it took WAY longer than 10 minutes to cook beets, and then recipe was too sweet and cloying with cloves. Was good enough to serve for a casual dinner with parents, but wouldn't repeat or even save recipe to tinker with. Next time goat cheese it is...

The spices combination works well to give the sauce a tasty holiday flavor that will blend in with other offerings.  I do like the addition of that amount of butter to give the sauce that creamy mouth feel.  I will make this again, but now for others to enjoy.

These were wonderful. The only changes I made were to use lemon juice instead of vinegar. I also used the cooking water for the water in the recipe. I’ll be making these again.

Well, I like beets.  I like these beets as well.  I had no sliced beets because, go figure, just before Thanksgiving all sliced canned beets are out of stock.  The small town I live in has no "fresh" beets either.  So small canned beets it was.

The recipe is super easy.  Follow the instructions and you are golden.  The flavor is good, not overpowering.  I would certainly make these again.  I don't know how well the small round beets will freeze, but we will see.

I bought beets @ Farmer's Mkt today...brought em' home...cooked em' up...wanted something diff. besides butter, salt, & pepper.....found this recipe...it definitely is a "keeper".  Special was the fact I can freeze em' in small batches for later.

Great recipe! The spices are not too strong, just perfect balance.  I used 3 T butter. I didn't use the corn starch or the water and the sauce was plenty thick.  There was plenty too, just enough to coat the beets. Thank You!

I made this a second time and this time used the brown sugar. I love the tangy taste, but found that the sauce was too thick and would not pour. I had a little extra water and the butter to the sauce and then poured it over the beets.

I believe this is the only time I have reviewed a recipe.  I'm challenged in the kitchen and stuff doesn't usually turn out for me.  But this was easy...and super delicious!  It's a sunny day in southern CA and my husband and I are enjoying this dish with beets straight from our garden...you don't need to wait until Thanksgiving!  Good enough for dessert!

I had some  frozen beets left over from the garden last fall. This recipe was perfect for them. It was easy to follow the recipe. I substituted honey for the brown sugar & the flavor was very interesting. I will make this again. It's a good way to serve beets away from the boring way of boiling & butter.

These beets have much flavor.  Adding a sweetener to it combined with some vinegar gave them a more appealing flavor to the people who are not fans of beets.

We all liked these beets, however, the sauce was way too thick and there wasn't much of it.  I cut the whole recipe in half, but next time I would only cut back the beets and leave the other ingredients at the full amount.  I also added an apple becaue I can't leave recipes alone. One other point: The problem with beets is that they want to leave red all over the place.  I would make this again, especially for a large group of people.

These were quite good.  I've never really cooked beets before, but they are such an inexpensive (and healthy) vegetable, I thought I'd pick some up and find a recipe to make for Thanksgiving.  They were very well received by most (a few people didn't care for them).   The only thing is that I had to boil the beets for about 25 minutes to get them soft enough.  I plan on making this a regular addition to our holiday meals.

I don't like beets much, but had to give the another try. This is yummy! It's sweet so appeals to my southern taste buds.  I emergency substituted rice flour for corn starch and reduced cloves a bit.
