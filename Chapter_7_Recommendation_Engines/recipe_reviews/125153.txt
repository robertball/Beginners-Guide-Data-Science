My first quiche ever. Although on the second try, i added 6 ounces or spinach, 6 pieces of bacon, 5 eggs, more cheese, bell pepper, more onion, ground the bacon, pressed the spinach between two spoons to get it ultra dry, added about 1/4 cup less milk, and it turned out to be a perfect amount for the crust. On the top I added alot of cheese and some paprika. My god this was so good, once it cooled(45 minutes) it was gone it almost 3 hours with only 3 people. I am only 16 and my parents were impressed. Overall, the recipe is a good recipe to work off of according to the way you want it.

I've made this several times.  The first time I made it as written, and it was great.  Tonight I made a few changes and it was excellent.  I added finely chopped deli ham to the onions and sauteed with the spinach to reduce the moisture from the spinach.  I put some of the cheese on the bottom and baked the crust for 5 min at 400, kept the crust from getting soggy.  I also reduced the milk to 1 cup and added 2 additional eggs.  My 9-year-old had 3 pieces! It was perfect, and I will continue making it this way.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Per suggestions of other reviewers I also decreased the milk.  I used fresh spinach and put it in the blender with the milk, and voila!  Very yummy.  I will make this again and again.

I made this quiche without bacon and I was out of dry mustard, so substituted prepared mustard.  It was still the best quiche I have ever made!  My son, who is somewhat of a connoisseur of restaurant quiche, loved it, too.

This is a delicious quiche. I give it only 3 stars, though, because the recipe has two flaws. As others have noted, 2 cups of milk is too much. I used 3/4 of a cup, and with all the other ingredients as listed, the mixture filled my 9 inch (deep dish) pie crust nicely. The other flaw is the baking time. At 375 degrees, I baked it for 30 minutes and it was more than done.

Not the consistency of a restaurant quiche. I think there is a bit too much milk in the recipe, when I cut the quiche it was all watery. And I had drained my spinach rather well.

I rated this five starts because it is what it says it is, "Spinach Bacon Quiche" and it's a great recipe for that.  However, I needed to use up some veggies and added another egg because I only had one egg left over (who needs ONE egg?). I only had two slices of bacon, but it didn't matter. I used puff pastry for the dough. Delicious!

My first quiche as well, but I used a pie crust from scratch and it was delicious. It wasn't watery or runny at all - make sure you cook it long enough and check to see the consistency with a knife, as the recipe says.  My guests were impressed!

Easy and delicious.  Served it with steamed veggies, french bread,  and salad.  Took the advice of other reviewers, and cut the amount of milk by half.  Good thing too, because it would have overflowed.  MMMMMgood!!  Perfect!

Great tasting!  Was wonderful.  Make sure you have a deeper dish pie shell.  (Ours overflowed a little!)  Got compliments from a chef with this one!

This was Deee-Lish! I added 6 slices of bacon instead of four. Like people have already said I only used 1 cup of milk because 2 cups would have been WAY TOO MUCH.  I also added 4 cloves of garlic and a tablespoon of pepper. I like things a little spicy so I put some red pepper flakes in it! Also,  I doubled all the seasonings! Used Monterey Jack cheese too! All together very yummy!

Yummy!  The only thing I changed was I used half cheddar/half mozzarella cheese (it's what I had on hand) and I used about 3 oz less of the spinach.  There was still plenty.  This was great, except the filling was enough for two 9 inch pastry shells.  Good thing I had two on hand! lol  It should specify you need a deep dish pasty shell.  Also, they took almost a full hour to cook completely.

Very easy to prepare and very good! I didn't put in the onion because some of my family doesn't care for them, kept everything else the same. I used Safeway pie crusts (the ones frozen and in the pie plate) and it made 2 quiches.

We really enjoyed this quiche tweaked to suit our personal taste.  I used only one cup of milk and 5 eggs. I used fresh spinach that I sauteed, (just until wilted), in olive oil with the onion.  I sqeezed the moisture from the spinach and onion before adding it to the egg mixture. I will use only this recipe for quiche from here on out.

Use others' advice: browned onion and spinach with garlic....yummy. Also substituted heavy cream for milk. Added one egg. Used 6 pieces of bacon. I also didn't have much cheddar (only for top) so used mozarella and reg. swiss chesse for cheese...think I should have had some cheddar inside also. Used a regular "pie crust" (roll) and it wasn't quite big enough for this dish. Would have used a larger sized one if they make them. I will modify and make again. Thank you.

Really, really good!  I followed other reviewers suggestions.  Only used 1/2 of the milk, added 2 more eggs, used a deep dish pie shell and sauteed the onion in the bacon fat.  Super delicious.  Turned out perfect!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was awesome!  I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions:  added one egg, less milk, a bit more cheese and more bacon.  I also added the bell pepper which made it look really Christmassy with the spinach.  Very, very good!  I will definitely make it again!  Just a tip:  place the pie pan on a baking sheet with edges before pouring.  This will prevent spillage outside and inside the oven.

This recipe was pointed out to me by a friend and she added that you can add 3 eggs and 1/4 cup milk to make 2 pies. Works well and still full of the goodies and flavor. My 8 year old daughter loves it for breakfast which makes it quick easy and healthy  for this single daddy before getting her out the door to school!!

This was kind of bland.  I even sauteed the onion with some green pepper and mushrooms first.  It needs something but I can't put my finger on it.

Good, but I used it as a base to create my own. I browned 1/2 pound turkey sausage, 1/2 chopped onion, 1/2 chopped green pepper. To that I added 2 c. chopped fresh baby spinach with 1/2 t. Old Bay, 1/2 t. garlic salt, and 1 t. tomato basil seasoning and cooked it down. I used 4 eggs and 1 c. milk and added 1 c. shredded cheddar/mozarella. I tried the idea of pre-baking the pie crust with a little cheese on the bottom also which worked great. Husband loved it!

Watery because amount of milk and spinach is actually for two pies instead of one for MOST recipes. Use 1 lb of bacon, 2 cups of cheese, saute  a whole small onion in 2 TB of the bacon drippings and add 4 more eggs. Double measurements on seasonings and add 1/4 tsp pepper. Squeeze the spinach after thawed and drained. Divide into two pie shells. YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE

Great taste--held up well.  I used five eggs and reduced the milk from 2 cups to 1 1/2 cups.  Didn't have bacon on hand and it was still tasty.  If you're going to make it for picky eaters, reduce the spinach by half as it was loaded with spinach (which I love).

I appreciated the suggestion to use fresh spinach instead of frozen! I also used less milk - just one cup - plus about 3 cups of spinach and put them in the blender - easy and really good. The green color makes it interesting-looking as well!

As written, the recipe will not work.  It is far too watery, and I'm still waiting on it after an extra 10 minutes in the oven, hoping to get it to solidify without burning the crust beyond being edible.  I think the idea is great, but next time I'll be cutting the milk probably in half.  EDIT: Cutting the milk down to 3/4 c and adding a couple tbsp flour made all the difference - I also added a couple of small red potatoes, diced.  Used veggie bacon, and now I have something I'll cook over and over again!

I make this all the time and it is wonderful.  I find that it makes a little more filling than a deep dish crust can take which is perfect - since I can't eat wheat I fill up two custard dishes and cook small crustless quiches for me! (I bake alongside the regular quiche but remove after 20 minutes).   My family loves it!

I made it crust-less as I didn't have a pre-made one on hand (and no patience to make one that day), and added mushrooms I had on hand, with half the amount of milk (per other reviewers) and it was great!  Simple and pleasing.  Thanks!

Love this recipe.  It is now one of my favorites for brunch and as a dinner side.  I used much more garlic sauteed fresh spinach, 1 cup of milk and 1 more egg, added chopped bacon on top and lots of cheese.  It is a hit and so easy!

Great recipe!  I did as others suggested and added one egg and reduced the liquid to 1 cup (well 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream).  I also  used 7 slices of pre-cooked bacon because the pieces were pretty small.  I did one quiche as written (with those small tweaks) and one quiche using mushrooms instead of bacon (my husband has a sensitive tummy and can't eat pork).  I also used a blend of swiss, mozerella, and chedder cheeses.  It was delicious!

Loved this recipe. I used 5 eggs and the two cups of milk, 5 slices of bacon- cooked and crumbled, and baked it at 400 degrees for 45 minutes...I used one cup of cheese in the mixture but passed on topping it with cheese. I thought it might be sort of runny in the middle when I pulled it out but the crust was golden and the knife half way to the center came out clean. I let it rest for 15 minutes and when I cut into it, it was perfect! It was my first quiche and I'll definitely make it again- maybe with ham next time & more onions!

Definitely cut back on the milk. This is my first quiche, so I followed the recipe as is. Can't wait to try it again, but with less milk! Also, I had to use up Rainbow Chard, so substituted that for the spinach, and would use about 6 - 8 oz of greens next time, instead of 10; will definitely pre-bake the pie crust next time. Yummy as is, but improvements will make it amazing!

I will use less spinach and less milk next go around, was a little too watery and the consistency could be better, but overall it was good! I left out the bacon, and paprika, and the flavor was still excellent.

I combined this recipe with "Easy Pie Crust" and took it to work for a potluck.  One of my coworkers, who says she does not like pie crust or eggs, devoured almost half of the quiche by herself... plus it was super easy and you can be really loose with adding or leaving out whatever meats and veggies you want.

This was my first attempt at ever making a quiche. I made it for my mommy friends coming over for a playdate. They LOVED it! As did i! Funny thing is that i dont even like spinach. I am a very picky eater, so i for sure didnt think i would like this but turns out im the one eating most of it. Even a 4 yr old from the playdate loved this. I did make a few minor changes: I used sausage links cut up instead of bacon(approx.8), i grated my onion and cooked it with the sausage, i cut the milk down to 1 1/2 cups only, i cooked my spinach in butter until hot, and i omitted the mustard completely and lastly, its good to know that this recipe makes-2- pies. It could easily make 1 deep dish though. Overall this was great! I will for sure be making this again! Thanks!

I use the full 2 cups of milk, add an egg and extra spices (needs pepper and some real mustard, too), fill the pie crust, and pour the extra bit into a ceramic ramekin to make an additional 1/2 crustless quiche. I also prebake the crust for 5-6 minutes and saute the spinach for a few minutes in bacon fat to dry it out a bit. Always gets rave reviews!

This quiche turned out really good. Only thing I did different was use a cup less milk and one extra egg. I will be making this recipe everytime I am in the mood for quiche from now on. Thanks!

The milk does need to be reduced—the amount given would probably be perfect in a 10" pie plate. I used about a cup of ham instead of bacon, so that may have contributed. However, this was amazing!!! Wonderful, wonderful quiche recipe!

Like everyone else, I cut the liquid to 1 cup using 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk.  I did not have spinach, so I used a thawed bag of corn.  I only had a little cheddar, so I added Swiss cheese and I substituted smoked paprika for regular paprika.  It was great! Obviously this is a versatile recipe.

I made this with half and half instead of milk. Anyway this quiche tasted bland to me. It needs more spices and seasoning. The combination of the spinach and bacon is nice, though.

Next time I will cut the milk to 1 1/4 cups and drain the spinach very well.  It's probably better to put the pie shell in the oven before putting the filling.  Overall, the quiche turns okay...

Awesome recipe. I Only used 1 1/2 cups of milk instead of two because it was just too much. Also only about 6-8oz. of spinach. I also added fresh Mozzerella. Over all I could eat this every day!

I liked this recipe. I thought it might have needed a bit more direction but I now know what I will do  differently next time. Make sure to DRY the spinach as much as possible. I made 2 pies so I used a whole package of bacon,6 eggs 2 cups milk 2 cups cheese in mix and green onions. Really good starting point though, thank you!!

Not bad.I had a couple of issues, but overall the dish tasted good. The ingredients were way to much for my 9 in pie shell. I kind of made a mess trying to pur from one shell to another because I was runing over the top. Next time, I won't put as much cheese. I don't particular care for dishes where the cheese over powers the rest of the ingredients. But overall the receipe was good. EDIT: I read the reviews AFTER making and rating this dish. I would have know to cut the milk.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I changed it a bit. It was wonderful!  I cut the milk to 1.5 cups and used a pound of side bacon.  I didn't have any spinach so I used broccoli and mushrooms.  Sauteed them along with the onion for about 5 minutes. I beat the eggs, added the milk & beat again, then added all the other goodies.  Pre- cooked the shell for 5 min. and put a bit of cheese on the bottom.  Put it on top of a cookie sheet to bake.  Came out delicious!  Browned nicely and perfect crust.  I'll be trying this again but with the spinach next time.

I took a star off because I made modifications but I think the recipe is a good base. Like others, I also used 5 eggs and less liquid (3/4c evaporated milk to use leftovers then 1/4c milk) because my husband likes it a little more dense. I didn't have quite that much spinach and I also sauteed that with the onion and a few mushrooms. One other thing...I used the frozen pie crust and actually rolled it a little thiner (I'm not a pastry fan) and formed it into a spring pan since my pie pan is only 7.5 inches. It cooked in just 30 minutes. My finicky DH absolutely loved it and sneaked another slice when he thought I wasn't looking.

This an easy & delicious recipe, however had to tweak it a bit. The portions require a deep pastry shell. Also, remember to brown the shell for a few minutes to avoid a soggy crust. I had to increase my cooking time to 50-60 minutes so best to cover your edges to avoid burning. One cooked through, yum!

This was a great recipe!!!  The only thing I did was use 2 cups of Cheddar Cheese instead of 1 1/4 cups.  For this reason, next time I will try 1 1/4 cups of milk.  When I place all the ingredients into the pie shell it ran over.  But the outcome was fabulous!!  The pie was gone between 3 people by the end of the day.  I could easily eat this on a weekly basis.  Thank you allrecipes, you have been a life saver more times than I have time to share.  This is my favorite and best website ever!!!

This is a good quiche however I changed the milk quantity. Being  an experienced cook, I have never seen a quiche with two cups of milk. It will not fit in a 9 inch pan, its too  much. I always use a deep dish pie crust, I will decrease the milk by one cup. Thx for the basic recipe, everyone likes it at our house.

Im really sorry to have rated this only 3 stars but this recipe should be tweeked for 2 reasons..way too much milk made this watery and runny,also the eggs didnt set well because of it.Also,the crust was ultra soggy,almost gooey!Next time I make this I will pre-bake the crust and cut the milk to one cup instead of 2.I also sauteed the onions in a teaspoon of the bacon drippings and added them to the mix instead of raw onion.Hopefully that will make this better.I will definitely try this again being sure to add my changes!

This makes a quick, light lunch or dinner.  I did make this crustless to save on calories, and I used fresh spinach.  My only complaint (and the reason why this doesn't get 5 stars) is that 2 cups of milk is way too much.  I cut the amount of milk back to 1 1/2 c. and it was still watery.  I will cut it back to 1 c. milk next time.

I'm not a huge quiche fan but this was good.  I used 4 eggs, less than a cup and a half of milk, a combo of swiss and cheddar, about 7 slices of bacon and added some sauteed mushrooms.  I cut down on the spinach per other's reviews and still thought it was very spinach-y.  It fit well in one 9 inch standard (non deep-dish) pie.  Also I looked up whether to parcook the crust and decided not to.  I was pleased with the results, it didn't have a soggy bottom like I heard could happen.  I think quiches are even better the next day when cold.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  I made it for a brunch for a group of Navy officers.  It was the first one gone!  I found it was too much to fill one pie pan so a lot of the liquid was left in the bowl.  Consistency was perfect.  The second time I made it I bought a deep dish pie crust and it was too watery even after cooking it a bit longer.  Next time I'll cut the milk.  Rave reviews by all!

This is an excellent base recipe. Like other reviewers, I reduced milk to 1 cup, and that was definitely adequate. I omitted the paprika and mustard, and used plenty of freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I sauteed the spinach briefly with the onion and bacon to remove excess moisture. Loved the amount of spinach, it was perfect. I'll make this one often.

I thought that this recipe was great. Its a very easy recipe. I used sausage instead of bacon. I used two already 9 inch pie crust. I actually was able to make two out of this recipe I just used five eggs instead of four and a little more milk. Just make sure to drain the spinch really well if not your quiche could be watery. Overall great easy recipe.

I was planning on making this for breakfast on New Year's Day for a couple of guests that were going to be staying with me.  Unfortunately, my guests were not able to come, but fortunately I still made the quiche, and it was INCREDIBLE!  Over the course of the next 2 days, I ate the entire thing MYSELF!  I didn't change a thing except to add an extra egg and bake the pie crust for a few minutes before adding the egg mixture.  It cooked perfectly, and wasn't runny at all.  I will definitely be adding this to my regular brunch rotation.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I have never made a quiche before and this recipe was wonderful! I took another's advice and blended fresh spinach with onle 1 1/2 cups of milk. I also sauteed the onions with 2 cloves minced garlic. I will be making this again! It also make enough for 2 pies which was good considering my husband ate 1 by himself!

The flavor was fine, but the texture was completely off--far too runny. I used nearly a cup less liquid (I used cream instead of milk for more richness), and it still spilled over in the oven in the regular store-bought pie crust. This calls for deep-dish crust. I baked it for more than an hour, and it was still not the right springy-quiche texture. Also I would saute the onions first.

We all enjoyed this quiche dish. I thought 400 sounded too high so I baked my quiche at 375 until done. I used 3 eggs and two egg whites. It was just slightly soft in the middle, so next time I might modify with a little less milk and a bit more cheese. Thank you for the recipe!!

I am usually not a fan of Quiche, or anything that has an egg like taste.  But my husband and daughter love it, so I gave this recipe a try.  It was great.  The only changes that I made was that I used 1 c. of milk instead of 2.  I also used fresh spinach (because it was all I had) and sauteed it with just a little bit of garlic powder.  I will definitely make this again!

I served this quiche at my Chistmas brunch and it was a hit! I substituted the 2 cups of milk for 1 1/4 cup of heavy cream and used prepared dijon mustard instead of dry mustard. I also separted the 1/4 cup of onion and sautedd one portion with the bacon. I had too cook a little longer than 40 minutes becuase it was still a little loose. Great recipe!

This is great!  I did take the advice of others who said it seemed like too much milk so I only put in 1@1/4 cup of milk and that was plenty.  Also because I like spicy things, instead of putting in the onion I drained the water from a can of rotel and added that.  It was a great combination!

Did not have heavy cream, so I used 1 cup of milk.
Turned out great and delicious.

I am a beginner in the kitchen.  With this recipe, it is very important to precook the crust.  It could also use more bacon.  However, simple  and my husband enjoyed it very much.

Very good.  I was in a hurry and left the spinach out.  Added another egg and extra cheese and came out perfect!  This was great for a brunch and I got lots of compliments on this one.

Oh so good!  I also decided to use only 1 cup of milk and add an extra egg.  In addition, I had some extra tato puffs (tater tots) from another meal and tossed those into the mix. This was delicious; gourmet restaurant style quiche and it even looked like it came right out of a magazine!  Mangia Mangia!!

I used One 9" deep dish pie crust and one deep no-crust 5; diam ovensafe dish. --  5 XL eggs, 1 c heavy cream, 1c h&h, 1+c cheddar, 1+c Emanthaler, 1/2 t onion powder., 1/2 t garlic powder, 1 t Kosher salt, 1 T worcestershire s, ~4 oz fresh spinach, ~3/4 chopped sweet onion,~4 oz sliced baby bella mushrooms.  Couldn't fit all the liquid. Will use maybe 1/2c less cream next time and less salt. -- not bad, but too salty.

Excellent texture and taste was wonderful. I didn't use onions, I used onion powder instead. I also used mozzarella instead of cheddar cheese. I also did as previous reviews and used 1 1/4 cup vrs 2 cup. I highly recommend. This was my first quiche and my husband ate most of it (all in one day)

This recipe makes 2 normal sized pies, and I even decreased the milk to 1 cup! Also, the amount of spinach was too much in comparison to only 4 eggs. Next time, I will decrease the spinach and increase the eggs. I also could not really taste the bacon due to the overwhelming amount of spinach, so I think I will add ham next time also.

Pretty good. I made this as written and found what others did - that it was too watery with 2 cups of milk. Probably chilled it will be fine, but it's too soupy in the middle when eaten warm. Since I found this recipe a little too heavy on the spinach and prefer quiche with some or all swiss cheese, I think I'll try other recipes rather than fiddling with this one.

As other reviewers have said, definitely need to cut the liquid in half. Used 1 cup milk which was perfect.  Cooked almost one hour instead of the 40 minutes stated. Cut spinach.  Taste was delicious.

I made this on one of those crazy nights were you realize you have nothing for supper and it turned out so well (and took so little time to prep)that my husband kept asking me where I bought it!  I did cut back on the milk also, I added red and green peppers, extra cheese and 1 extra egg.  Great recipe

This made a really delicious quiche. I loved it. However, I ended up putting it in a deep dish pie pan instead of a regular pan. It was voluminous! If you only want a regular pie's worth, you might want to halve it.

Well, I made this quiche a few days ago and it turned out great. I made it for my brother and my friend. They both enjoyed it. It looked a bit watery before baking because of the amount of milk, but everything turned out nicely in the end. It may be a bit too greasy for anyone on a diet though.

Made this recipe to try something a little different for a change and my boyfriend and I loved it. Came home late from work and had a delicious dinner and lunch in less then a hour. Making it again tonight for lunches tomorrow. My only change was adding a lot of garlic and mixing swiss, cheddar, and colby cheeses. Great recipe.

As written, it gets three stars from me -- the consistency is not great and the spinach far outweighs any other flavors.  With the changes suggested by others (therefore making an entirely different recipe), my guests and I give it 5. I used 5 eggs, 1 c. milk, and 1/3 of the recommended spinach and it was excellent.

Great, I loved it and I never eat quiche. I added 4 strips of bacon, and 4 eggs, 1 3/4 milk. Note: less than 1 package of spinach if using a 9in pie crust. It wasn't watery, wasn't too dry, perfect next time I will add 1 more egg..

I think there is too much spinach in this recipe and not enough egg. Next time, I might 1/2 the spinach and maybe add an egg or two.  I liked one reviewers idea of putting the spinach and milk in a blender.  My quiche also came out watery when we cut into it, even with the knife coming out clean.  It was done, but I agree with other reviewers that there may be too much milk. Plus the spinach may have needed more draining, although I squeezed it out as best I could.  We like more bacon, so next time I would probably put at least 6 pieces in there.  Great with a home-made crust.  We'll make again with these modifications.

Great base recipe, but I absolutely love it with a few tweaks. I use 6 eggs, 1 cup of half and half, 2 cups of cheddar, half of a red onion (on the smaller side), half of a package of precooked bacon (about 5-6 slices), 1 tsp honey dijon mustard, 1/2 can of chopped spinach (drained very very well), one deep dish frozen pie shell, a few dashes of garlic powder/Italian herbs/rosemary, and a few grinds of fresh cracked pepper. The recipe doubles beautifully when you're shopping for ingredients. I put the pie crust in for 5 minutes (otherwise the crust doesn't seem to fully cook), then smooth out any air bubbles and put 2/3 cups of cheese on the bottom. I put the quiche in with aluminum foil over the top for the first half of the time, then rotate the quiche and remove the foil for the second half. I keep the temperature and time the same, and it turns out beautifully. Even my friend who's a chef said this is one of the best quiches that she's had.

Made this as written a few weeks ago.  It was very good.  This recipe is a great jumping off point for changes as well.  It give a very good set of proportions to use when substituting other ingredients. This week I'm using a box of chopped broccoli instead of spinach and a small piece of ham instead of bacon.

Love the recipe!  Made it crustless and it's just wonderful.  Followed other recommendations of adding an egg, decreasing the milk, extra onion, used a bag of crumbled bacon pieces and over 2 cups of cheese.  It is still a little watery, but not too bad.  Will make this one again.

This is my first quiche, and we loved every bite of it.  As a new cook, this is the first recipe I've made where I am wowed by the results.

There are four things I altered; egg product not real eggs, no onions, added two more strips of bacon, and instead of 1/4C cheese on top, I used about 1C.  My husband and I love onions, but I couldn't locate where my husband put them.  We also love bacon and cheese, so that is why I added more of it.

This will be the second time I make this quiche. It turned out perfect the first time and was a great option to get my kids to eat spinach. Everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly. When a recipe calls for frozen spinach I always put it in a colander and push the liquid through. This might help those who found this to be a bit loose.
