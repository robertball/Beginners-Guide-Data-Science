iusually make the real chicken version of this and except for the fake chicken strips the recipe is the same and it always gets raves. It can be baked for 30 min @350 with the cheddar cheese sprinkled on top (instead of using a slow cooker) GOOD EITHER WAY.

Everything about this recipe is perfect except that I substituted the "chik'n strips" with about 3/4C of TVP flakes which was absolutely perfect. I didn't think that the strips would provide the right texture and the TVP flakes were a good choice (and cheaper). I served it to my unsuspecting meat-eating family and it went completely undetected and there were no left-overs! Everyone loved my "chicken wing dip" and no one noticed it wasn't real chicken :-D Even my tofu-hating father had like four helpings!

Four stars because the chicken substitute tbe recipe calls for is terrible but my fix was perfect :) Try it again with textured vegetable protein flakes if it didn't turn out right for you with the other chicken substitutes. I know it sounds gross but it really is the best. And remember, buffalo wing sauce is NOT the same as hot sauce ;)

I was so excited to see a vegetarian version of this buffalo dip but was disappointed by the results. I made exactly as written and used all of the recommended brands. Next time I will try shredding the chik'n in a food processor instead of just dicing to improve the texture. I will also mix in blue cheese dressing take out some of the ranch and experiment with different types of cheeses. It was just a little too "blah" for me as is.

This was good but a little spicy for me. Next time I will use 1/2 to 3/4 the bottle of buffalo hot sauce. To decrease spiciness I added some chunky bleu cheese dressing until the heat was decreased to my liking. I also used Qorn Naked Chik'n Cutlets diced. Those are awesome.

If you are fortunate enough to be in an area of the country where Yancey's Fancy cheese is sold consider buying their Buffalo Wing Cheese. It's vegetarian and you can shred it add it to sour cream mayo and blue cheese maybe some diced celery as well and an extra dash of hot sauce for a really great meatless alternative.

Not good. Will not make again. Way to hot- the buffalo flavor was very overpowering. Perhaps if that was cut down and ranch instead of spicy ranch was used but I have no desire to try this again.

OMG! very very very good. but I used louisiana hot sauce instead of the redhot buffalo sauce and WOW is it hot! im actually eating it right now. If you want something pretty hot fire it up with the louisiana. I would recommend not putting a whole 12 ounce bottle in though. haha:)

I was really excited when I found this recipe. I had two parties in the same weekend. Made it for both and it was not a hit at either. Sorry.

This was yummy but after looking at some other similar (non vegetarian) recipes I decided not to use as much hot sauce. I only used half a bottle and am glad that I did.

This recipe was very good! Nobody knew it was vegetarian until they realized my vegetarian wife and daughter were eating it. I made it exactly as written. I will make this again! Thanks.

This is a great based for the dip. I did as a previous poster advised and used TVP and a few more alterations as followed: 3 cups TVP 16 oz of cream cheese I made my own ranch dressing (16 oz) and 13 oz of buffalo sauce. I didn t use a crock or but rather heated everything up in a pan on the stove and placed in the oven until warmed through. The whole family loved it (from Pre teens to 6 year olds).

Did not like. Way too much hot sauce. Might try to add more cheeses next time and a lot less hot sauce.

I followed the exact recipe except I exchanged the "chicken" for boca crumbles. My hubby and I are both fans! I will definitely make this again. It's a great dip for Sunday football.

Super good! Baked at 350Â° for 30 minutes but only used HALF A BOTTLE OF HOT SAUCE. I love spice and even the half bottle was a lot. It comes out a little soupy so even less ranch would be okay. Still came out super tasty and so easy.

I made as directed and it was good. I took 1 star away because it looks unappetizing. It is an odd peach color. Next time I'd use only 8 oz. of cream cheese. This might help brighten the color. Yes that would make it spicier but I can handle the heat.

This recipe can be very easily be manipulated. Meaning if it's too hot for you just add more ranch. Not hot enough? Add more hot sauce or another sauce that suites your taste. I like it hot so the consistency was great for me. I also love cheese so adding a little extra can cool it down too.

Great vegan option! I had to substitute all vegan products (vegan cream cheese vegan Ranch dressing and vegan cheddar cheese) as my daughter is vegan and I was making recipes she would be able to eat. I halved the recipe and we were on a time crunch so I just heated dip up in microwave until cheeses were melted and it was heated through. I did mix the cheddar into the dip prior to heating as this is how we like our Buffalo Chicken dip. this turned out wonderful! She absolutely enjoyed it with celery sticks as well as tortilla chips. I liked it a lot too.!
