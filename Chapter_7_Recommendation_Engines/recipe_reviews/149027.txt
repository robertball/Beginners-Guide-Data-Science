This was quite good. I did make some changes however, just because I have too when making a recipe that I am familiar with. First, I toasted the spices (cumin, cardamom, coriander, cloves) and then used butter (since I didn't feel like making ghee) to saute the onions and garlic in. I crushed the spices and added them to the onions, along with curry powder. I used a home made yogurt, which is more tart than what you generally find in the store. I served it with an Indian-ish rice I tossed together. So I really liked this, but agree that it would have been better with fresh spinach, but I didn't have any on hand. I think that adding coconut milk to this (as another reviewer suggested) would be a little odd.

This was decent if you followed directions exactly, but it needs to be cooked longer than "heated through".  Per another recipe on this site, the next day I heated up a little additional butter and added more garlic and 2 teaspoons of red curry powder- then added the previously cooked saag.  I added a cup of chicken stock and cooked for a long time (?- 1 hour?) and at the end added about 1/4 cup of plain yogurt.  THIS I could eat every day- it was delicious.

This recipe is tasty, however it did not taste like Chole Saag to me.  I substituted coconut milk for yogurt and fresh spinach for frozen which I think made it more bright and fresh tasting.

Great dish!! The only think I added that it did not call for was a 1/2 tsp (give or take) of garam masala. Also, I only used 5 oz of fat free greek yogurt. Fabulous dish to make for an Indian themed dinner.

Oh, my gosh, this was fantastic. We simmered a chicken breast cut into chunks in garlic, salt and pepper and olive oil in a separate pan until really tender and threw that in at the very end. What a great meal..we ate with some store bought naan. PRIMO!! We followed the suggestion and used fresh spinach.

I was looking for a chick pea recipe and found this.  The chick peas I had were cooked, dried chick peas (not canned), and I didn't have canned sweet peas, so I microwaved frozen peas.  I also substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth, added some extra water, and cooked longer than the recipe called for (based on one review I read and the fact that I wanted to put my daughter to bed before dinner).  The result was delicious!  For those who couldn't guess based on the amount of red pepper flakes called for, this is fairly spicy.  My husband and I ate it plain, but others might want to serve it over basmati rice or with naan (as a number of reviewers recommend) or, for those who really don't like spicy food, reduce the amount of red pepper flakes.

Amazing Recipe!  One alteration I made was to replace the vegetable oil with olive oil, and combining that oil with the garlic, red pepper flakes, cumin, and curry in a Tupperware container, then shaking the chickpeas in the mixture and allowed it to set in the fridge for 3 days prior to making.  This allowed the chickpeas to absorb all the spices and taste incredible!  For the final product I replaced peas with chopped green bell pepper and sauteed it with the onion, then added the chick pea mixture and served it over some thin spaghetti.  It is always amazing.

I thought it was wonderful. The spice got my attention, sweetness from the peas, healthy, and low fat. Now,  I did use what I have on hand, so frozen peas and beans, and used 6 cloves of garlic. I did increase  the temp to medium high to cook the onion, garlic, and spices until soft. Also, added plain greek yogurt on top after served in a bowl. Very good and highly recommend.

Great recipe!  I used fresh spinach and halved the red pepper flakes.  I also used mushroom broth instead of chicken broth. Tastes great over rice!  Next time - I will puree in the blender and serve as a soup with a drizzle of cream on top, with a side of Naan bread.

This was a great recipe to use up our extra fresh spinach from our CSA. We only had sour cream and frozen peas in the house and they worked well. We will make some sticky rice to eat with the leftovers. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a lovely dish, delicious. I did not have yoghurt so used creme fraiche and frozen peas instead of tinned  which worked very well. I also used vegetable stock as I think meat stocks are unsuitable for vegetable dishes. The result. excellent. Will make again and again

Absolutely divine! I added chunks of chicken thighs to the onion and sauteed, 2-5 oz. containers of plain Greek yogurt, garam masala as per earlier recs, and frozen peas since they were on hand. The real killer was adding raisins, which set off the flavors nicely with a wonderful contrast. Next time I'll add cashews too, for the ultimate in Indian flavors!

I at least doubled this recipe a month or so ago and froze some of it. The night I made this, I didn't really like it. HOWEVER, the leftovers were out of this world! The only thing I did differently is I added a little lemon at the end, and toasted my spices. It smells phenomenal and I will be making this again tomorrow! Thanks for a great recipe.

We enjoyed it and found it actually got better as left overs. We wanted it to be a main dish so added tofu and some vegetables to give it some substance.

Fantastic, crowd-pleaser, great flavors. Made vegetarian. I cooked onion, frozen peas, and garlic with spices (added some garam masala) in a bit of vegetable stock (oil not necessary.) I then put all of this in blender for a course purée. A cooked fresh spinach in veg stock and then added peas purée and chickpeas. I used a little veg stock as needed for moisture (1cup seemed like too much.) Add yogurt just before serving so it doesn't curdle. Make vegan by skipping the yogurt, but may want to cut back on the spices since the yogurt cools them.

This is a really nice everyday dish.  It can be thrown together surprisingly quickly...and is wonderful vegetarian comfort food if you sub. out the chicken broth for veggie broth!  Planned to give this one 4 stars, but after letting it rest for a while in the pot, it got even better, so it got a promotion!  I made it exactly as the recipe states at first, but the flavor wasn't quite strong enough for my tastes, so added another generous amount of curry powder and it was perfect!

This was so easy to make and really yummy. I used fresh spinach, vegetarian stock, and a little ginger. Omitted the peas.  I should have waited to the add the yogurt until the end so it wouldn't curdle as much.  I also threw in some soy sauce and some sriracha instead of red pepper flakes.  We ate it over yesterday's leftover brown rice.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband reduced some of the spices, so I am not sure how spicy it's supposed to be. It was warm in my mouth (spice wise), but VERY tasty. We used brown rice and it had a slight nutty flavor because we roasted the rice for a minute or 2 before cooking.

I love saag, so tried this with fresh spinach and added a tsp of garam Masala.  Very spicy, although I did use 1/2 hot curry powder, so yours might be on the lower end     If you have trouble with yogurt curdling, use full fat yogurt and bring it to room temp.  Then in a small bowl, add a tbsp of sauce, gently whisk in  repeat a few times to bring yogurt yep up, then add yogurt a couple of tbsp at a time to dish, stirring gently one direction till fully blended before you add more..... Willk make again

Make sure your spinach is completely dry! I made the mistake of skipping this critical step and ended up having to boil it for 30-40 minutes to reduce the sauce. It was surprisingly bland, but probably because of the spinach. I will definitely make it again. Any tips for better flavor, please send my way :)

Family loved this and it was so EASY to make!! I doubled the recipe and made a few adjustments for personal taste (butter instead of oil, and only a pinch red pepper flakes). My husband said he would like to make it a weekly meal!!

I've made this twice so far.  My husband and I love it.  I did find that we liked it better the first time I made it when I used 1.5 Tbsp of curry instead of 2.

I somehow had everything on hand to make this. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and added 1/2 tsp tandoori masala. Left out the pepper flakes because of my son, so can't attest to the spiciness. Overall, this was REALLY good, and was super quick to put together! I served it with naan and basmati rice. OH, I also let it simmer for awhile with everything but the yogurt.

Yum! This had a wonderful flavor, texture, and appearance . . . oh, and aroma too. I made it with a couple of small modifications: I used fresh spinach, added about a half teaspoon of Garam Marsala, and used coconut milk instead of  dairy. If you choose to replace the milk with coconut milk, you may want to reduce the amount of red peppers a bit since you do not have the dairy to cut the spiciness.

My family and our guests really liked this dish! It got rave reviews from everyone. Good flavor, good amount of heat, simple to prepare, and vegetarian  I'll be adding this to our rotation! The only thing I didn't do was squeeze out the frozen spinach, and next time I definitely will. Had to use a slotted spoon to serve it otherwise.

Just like my favorite frozen meal, Amy's Organic's Matar Paneer.  I used a kind of curry powder called Muchi Curry (there are lots of different curry powders, but that one seemed to work fine for this recipe).  Delicious!

The flavors are definitely there, but mine turned out awefully runny & I feel it could use much more spinach. Fresh would be MUCH better as well. With canned spinach it wasn't very good as a leftover.

I made this with doubled spices and fresh spinach.  Still missing something.... so I added 1.5 tablespoons of corriander chutney that I bought from a local Indian store.  Kicked up the heat and taste.  Too each his own!

I LOVED this!!! Will absolutely make it again!! May cut down on the amount of curry, b/c my daughter isn't much of a spice lover, but beyond that, it's fantastic!

I followed the comments and added a can of tomatoes, I also doubled the spices and I thought it was well seasoned. I used half dried chickpeas and 1 350 g can of chickpeas (not sure if it was 15 ounces or not). Really good and really cheap!!!

I was so excited for this dish based on the positive reviews, but was very disappointed.  There was a good amount of heat in the dish (I doubled the red pepper and cumin), but it lacked any other flavors.  Even my husband, who will eat anything, declined to touch the leftovers.

I've made this once so far.  It's definitely something I want to make again, but with some changes.    Instead of using curry powder, I toasted ground coriander, cumin, and ground red pepper (cayenne) all to my own tastes.  I substituted vegetable for the chicken broth.  For the directions, I sauteed the onion and garlic first (added ginger as well) then added my toasted spices.  Followed the recipe as is after that point.  Next time I plan on cooking my own spinach instead of using the frozen and pureeing that together with the peas and yogurt for a creamier texture.

This recipe was really good as-is, however, my husband prefers it to be more spinachy.  Because of this, I added one more package of spinach, some more spices, and a couple of spoonfuls more yogurt.  It was great as-is but just didn't have as much spinach as I am accustomed to!

Delicious! My husband and I love curry and this was amazing! I ended up using fresh spinach because that was what I had on hand and it worked well. Definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delicious!  This was the first time I have ever made any saag dish, so I didn't know if the watery consistency was intended.  After having read a couple of reviews that recommended coconut milk instead of yogurt, I decided to go half and half.  The outcome was delicious!  I also added a some more pepper flakes and used freshly chopped spinach.  Yum!

I originally gave this 4 stars because it wasn't quite the saag recipe I was looking for. But now that it's become a staple in our household, I think I ought to revise my rating! We love this. I measure the spices generously, use fresh spinach, and add a bit more spinach than is actually called for, but other than that, the recipe hasn't evolved much in the months that we've been making it.

This was OK.  Tasted better the second day, but even then and even with me adding a little extra seasoning and some paneer, it still tasted rather bland.  I think the chickpeas detract from the dish both in texture and flavor, and if I play around with this dish and make it again, I'll leave those out.  EDIT: On the third day, it actually tasted better still.  I think the key to this one is letting it sit for at least one day (this is like a lot of soups: they always taste better the next day) and making sure you add enough but not too much salt.

This recipe was good. I would make it again, however I think it needed some changes. For example another reviewer said to use fresh spinach and I really think that's essential. Also, it could have used curry paste as well as the powder. I felt the recipe made a lot, way more than the number it was intended to serve. I froze the leftovers for my boyfriend to eat when I'm out of town!

I have been searching for a recipe for this that was just right for at least 3 years.  This is just perfect.  It's nice with some lemon juice and cashews on top, too.  Good stuff!

This is a great recipe.   I used vegetable broth and tofrutti supreme instead of yogurt to "veganize" it, and it turned out great!  The taste was exactly the same as my favorite restaurant.

Wow!  This was really delicious!!!  I subbed heavy cream for the yogurt just because I had some that I needed to use up.  I added the broth, spinach and peas to the onions and used a hand blender to blend about half of the mixture.  Then I added the chickpeas and cream.  Next time I'll use yogurt.  My South Indian husband LOVED the dish!  I usually prefer my veggies raw; never in a million years would I have thought I would love a dish with cooked spinach and peas but this recipe was really really good.  I think I even like it better than Saag Paneer.

Great saag!  I did have to cook it a lot longer than the recipe said, as it ended up having more liquid than my family is used to.  After cooking it down, however, it was very tasty!
