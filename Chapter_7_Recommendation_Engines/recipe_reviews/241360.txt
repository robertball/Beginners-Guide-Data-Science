I love this recipe! The only change I make is using white chocolate chips rather than dark. It not only makes them pretty, but also gives them a different flavor, which everyone loves. I like to make them petite.

Great cookies! I only used 1 tablespoon of red food coloring instead of 2.  I also used white chocolate chips!

Half the red food coloring is plenty sufficient.

These cookies had a pretty good taste but it needed less sugar and a lot less food coloring. After I ate one I felt a little sick from the amount of food coloring

These are just wonderful! Very flavorful cookie.  Like someone else suggested, next time I will use White Chocolate chips just to give them a different twist.

These turned out amazing! I made some adjustments to try to make them a bit fluffier and more Christmas-y, so I used a little extra baking soda and baking powder (no more than 1/2 teaspoon extra of each) and used only 1/8 cup of white sugar and 7/8 cup of brown sugar. I also reduced vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon and added a teaspoon of peppermint extract. Additionally, I used chopped white chocolate and crushed candy canes in the cookies. Don’t use too many candy canes, though; you don’t want to overpower the chocolate! I used two candy canes for this recipe, and it seems to have been the perfect amount! I hope yours turn out well, too!

I only added 1 Tablespoon of red food coloring which I found to be just the right amount.
I added chocolate chips and walnuts.
    Really good, will make it again.

Quality overall is great; recipe is simple. However they aren't red at all. I used all-natural food coloring and maybe that's the difference. Will have to try again.

I made these cookies for the first time. My nephew asked specifically for red velvet cookies.  I failed to look at the amount of food coloring and thought I had enough and did not.  Other than the color being wrong the cookies were moist and tasty.  My nephew didn't like them because they weren't red but that just meant more for me.

The cookie was okay. I found it to be rather dry and flour-y. I wouldn't recommend this to very many people

Delicious, very good and doesn't need much more than chocolate chips. Easy to make, too.
