Initially I felt these cookies were a little on the bland side eventhough my whole family liked them.  I did however make a few changes to the recipe.  First, the dough was too dry, so I added 2 TB of milk.  Secondly, I could not find ground hazelnuts, so I tried to ground whole ones in my blender, but ended up with powdered hazelnuts.  If I'd had larger pieces I think these would have been better.  Lastly I frosted the cookies with Nutella which seemed to help a lot.

I agree with those whom were impressed by them, and disagreed with those that felt they were too bland, or lacked 'specialness'.  I think sometimes we Americans feel shortchanged if we don't get all the bells and whistles, or if every lily isn't gilded; gastronomically speaking.  On my perfect Christmas cookie platter, there are the 'fancy', rich, or showy ones, and then the 'plainer', simple, or unadorned ones.  There is a place for both, I think, and I thought these were wonderful.  It reminded me of a part of what best about German cooking.  Thank you Oma Kiener, and Oma Keiner's children!

These were good but lacked the specialness of a Christmas cookie.  Thanks for sharing.

My great-grandma always made these cookies, not with hazelnuts but with (yuck) walnuts.  These didn't taste like hers, but it's only because my great-grandmother made her own butter from raw milk in a churn.  So, it's very different taste than anyone is used to.  lol

These were easy to make. I might cut them a wee bit thicker next time though. I will definitely make them again!

I’m gonna confess right off the bat that I did 2 things different than the recipe: I only processed the nuts to a coarse chop, and I added about 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract. That said, WOW. These cookies are not knock-your-socks-off with flavor- but that’s OK, because the richness of the nuts and the butter makes up for it. They are certainly not bland.

This recipe was nice and easy to make. I added a bit of almond extract and chopped almonds as other reviewer suggested, but not to the batter, I thought they'd look nice instead of the sprinkles, and they did...no egg wash used either.
