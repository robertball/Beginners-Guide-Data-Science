I first learned how to make these as a small child at daycare. To this day, it's one of my most favorite simple pleasures. This is good with any kind of spread (nutella, marshmallow creme, almond butter.....) and is also good with chopped nuts. GREAT for a quick campfire dessert.

Better if you use PB& Choc chips in banana and then for the top layer, use marshmallows. Cook at 350 in foil until marshmallows at toasted. Then eat with a spoon. Excellent!

We have been making these for years, under the name of "Banana Boats".  W use a combo of PB chips and Chocolate chips.  It's also great with a spray of whipped cream topping on top when they are finished cooking. Yum!

My husband changed it by accident a turned out better. Instead of pb and choc chips he used an Oh henery choc bar cut in 1/2 lengthwise to fit into the banana . It was delish.

Tried to make in oven according to prior reviewers directions. It was ok but I think banana et al probably cooks better over a fire. I would have like my banana more well done (rather than just warm).

This is how we do this:  Peel back one section of peel and cut out a pie shaped wedge of banana.  Sprinkle in chocolate chips and mini marshmallows, close banana and wrap in foil.  Then cook it over a campfire and eat  with a spoon.  It is the best camping dessert ever!

It was great! We had this for dessert after camper pies and made them on the hot coals just as directed.  Delicious and simple, and other than the chocolate chips, good for you, too.

I am not a big peanut butter fan so I made mine with double chocolate and my husbands with the chunky peanut  butter and chocolate.  I grilled them and put into a bowl with a few scoops of French Vanilla Ice Cream on top.  WOW I have to say it was fabulous. Warm and cold all in the same bite.  MMMMMMMM GOOD!!!!

Wow, this was a great, warm treat for a chilly New England Autumn morning! Obviously I didn't make it over a fire... I baked it for 15 minutes at 350 as some other reviewers did, and it was soooo good! I'm not as into chocolate as most people are so I used about half the amount and it was perfect for my particular taste. Thanks for one of the best treats I've ever had!

I've made this since I was a kid, but never thought to put peanut butter in it.  It's also very good with marshmellows.  That's how I've always made it.

I made this in the oven and it was delicious. I baked them at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. I did not have chocolate chips so I used Hersheyâ€™s syrup in place of the chocolate chips. This is one of my favorite simple dessert now. My 7 year old daughter absolutely loved it and it was nice that it is a healthier dessert than most desserts!

Threw these on the BBQ when the burgers were done.  Really nice end to a BBQ dinner.  I used chunky peanut butter for mine and my son's, and smooth for my husband's (personal preferences).  Make sure you add enough chocolate chips!

These were good, easy, and pretty healthy (except when you eat them with ice cream like I did) I did cook mine in the oven at 350 for probably 15 minutes. Really good, fast treat!
