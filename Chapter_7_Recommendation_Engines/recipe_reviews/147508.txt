This is a pretty good marinade for chicken.  I couldn't understand why you would use undiluted pinapple juice concentrate and then add a whole cup of water so I just left out the water and used regular pineapple juice from a can with pinapple chucks.  I used low sodium soy sauce, 2 tsp. of minced garlic, 1 tsp. of ginger and 2 tsp. of Frank's red hot. I also added 2 Tbsp. of veg. oil. I cut up boneless chicken breasts into thick chunks for kabobs and let it marinate for over 24 hours.  I grilled them with red and green peppers, onions, and cherry tomatoes.  The chicken was moist and quite good, but the marinade needs something - brown sugar for a little more sweetness or red pepper flakes for a little more kick....

If you ONLY follow the recipe . . . you'll be disappointed.
This is the BASIC INGEDIENT list!  GET CREATIVE . . . Want more Garlic, Ginger, HEAT, Bourbon . . . JUST ADD IT!  It's YOUR marinade!  "Sweet Suzie" likes the basic recipe . . . but, then, she likes vanilla ice cream!   Get Creative - RUN with the BASICS I've given you.  If you don't like what you get . . .

I love bourbon so I thought this might be a winner. Sadly, it was a missing something. I thought the pineapple concentrate might make it sweet enough, but it still lacked any sweetness and not much flavor overall after marinating half of a chicken for 24 hours.  On to another marinade :)

It was an excellent marinade. Instead of pineapple juice, I used orange juice. It made the chicken with an orange flavor. I used Buffalo Trace Bourbon which enhanced the flavor. I am going to Bristol Speedway in August and will use this recipe on what ever I cook down there.

My chicken came out very tender, but very bland. I was pretty disappointed. But, it did make a nice dent in the fancy bourbon someone left at my house 5 or 6 years ago.

Followed another reviewers suggestions and omitted water and used pineapple juice. My family does not care for pork loved this recipe. Will be making again
