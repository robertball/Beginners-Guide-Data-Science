I have gone through a lot of ham and bean soup recipes in 40 years and found this one to be my favorite. It's so simple that the only thing needed on my grocery list was ham hocks.  Be sure to purchase meaty ones, and don't add additional salt, it's plenty salty with the ham hocks.  The only change I made was to strain the soup after cooking, chill the liquid, skim off the fat then add the liquid back to the rest of the ingredients.  My husband loved it and that's the clincher.

I was looking for a soup to use up a ham bone left from Easter Sunday, and this was perfect! It's similar to the way I usually make my bean soup, except this one has garlic and thyme. I did cut the celery back a bit, as I only had 2-1/2 stalks in the frig. A good hearty soup that we all enjoyed.

This soup turned out so delicious, I would rate it as the best soup I've ever made. I did not have dried beans so I used a can of white beans, a can of black beans and a can of red kidney beans. I rinsed them thoroughly as I did not want to add any extra salt. No "real" garlic on hand, so used lots of garlic powder. Threw everything in slow cooker with 6 cups of water and dissolved chicken bouillon in the remaining 2 cups of water. Cooked on high for 8-9 hrs. Fabulous!  Everyone raved about it, will definitely make again.

I really liked the flavor of this bean soup! I followed it pretty much to the T.  I did replace water with chicken stock for more flavor and added a bit more salt and pepper. I would make it again.

The basic recipe is good but my soup lacked a smoky ham taste so I added one package of Goya ham flavoring (I know it has a high sodium count) and the soup became flavorful and my family loved it.  Even better the next day.  I will make again when I have a ham bone left over to provide more meat and richer flavor.

This soup is so darned good.  My Aunt Dee has been making this for many years and she finally gave me her secret recipe and it is pretty much this very recipe.  But Aunt Dee is known for some shortcuts, so I tried both and as much as I want to insist that there is a difference, there is not.  Aunt Dee's "beloved" recipe is made with these same ingredients though from jars and cans.  Yep, I'm not proud. If you're so inclined to "take the easy path", this is it.  A 48oz jar of Randall's beans (mixed or Northern),  15oz can sliced carrots and the juice, 15oz can diced potatoes and the juice, 2-3 stalks diced celery,  3/4-1 cup diced onion, garlic or garlic powder to taste, 1/2t thyme to taste, pepper to taste, a bayleaf,  24 oz water, a big meaty hambone or hamhocks, and maybe even a handful or two of any diced ham that you may have in the meat drawer.  To make myself feel better about this cheating way of making soup, my addition was to add 3 or 4 handfuls of chopped kale (center ribs removed) and saute it in EVOO along with the celery and onions.  It made me feel better about myself.  Again, this soup is so darned good.

Delicious! !  I used quick soak method with the beans, and substituted a cottage butt for the ham hocks because it's what I had (and it's easier). Served with sweet cornbread and butter...amazing...bf raved!

I'm not a huge fan of bean soups but decided to make some to use up a ham bone I had. It was excellent even though I didn't have a bay leaf. Simple recipes are the best.
