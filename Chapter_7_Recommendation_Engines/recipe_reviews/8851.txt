My husband practically licked his plate!

This was a great recipe! Nice and quick and easy. Clear instructions and it tasted great. I made it two times in one week already.  Really nice. I used string beans and asparagus one time and string beans and carrots the next. Also, I substituted honey for the sugar - turned out great.

WOW!  Another fantastic recipe from this site!!  I followed the suggestions of several reviewers and added carrots and baby corn.  I also served it over jasmine rice.  It was a big hit with all 3 of us, including our 19 month old daughter, who is a very picky eater.  I will not only add this to my regular recipe rotation, but will share it with my family and friends.

it all started when i bought a jar of hoisin sauce for one meal and had about 3/4 of a jar leftover. so i did an ingredient search on here and it led me to this recipe. a really excellent, flavourful and light meal! i really enjoyed the wild rice instead of tradtional basmati rice. i also think that adding some yellow and red peppers would make it even nicer. i'll definitely make this again!

MMMM good!  I did make a few changes.  I added a little soy sauce, white wine, minced ginger, and garlic to the sauce.  I also added a drained can of water chestnuts.  Served over jasmine rice and it was GOOD!

I didn't have peanut oil so I used sesame oil instead and added 1 tsp of peanut butter to the sauce. Also, I used broccoli instead of asparagus. My 2 yr old LOVED it and even my picky 8 yr old said it was good and he doesn't like anything I make. I have also made this with salmon (I just used a pouch)and the kids still thought it was chicken. I will make again!

This recipe was awesome! I doubled the chicken and the sauce and used vegetable oil instead of the peanut oil and basmati rice instead of the wild rice as I didn't have those ingredients on hand.  My husband and I really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again.

Very simple and great tasting dish.  I added red bell pepper and green onions.  Would be an easy dish to customize any way you like.

This was delicious!  I added broccoli and red bell pepper to it, so had to double the sauce.  I also used frozen asparagus (which I defrosted) and used less peanut oil.  We served it with the wild rice as written and it was good and very healthy.

I only give this recipe 4 stars because I did make a few changes.  I used sesame oil instead of peanut as others recommend. At whole foods I found a spicy sesame oil that was wonderful. The hoison sauce I had was a little sweeter than I expected (this was my first experience using it).  Since we like food very spicy I also added red pepper to fire it up a bit more.  I also made it with snow peas and carrots.  It was delicious. Cooking the chicken in the hot sesame oil after seasoning with some salt, pepper, and garlic was great!

I just made this tonight for dinner and it's delicious! I will definately be making this again. I have never cooked with hoisin sauce but it is wonderful. It's a little on the sweet side so I might use a tad bit less brown sugar next time, but it is definately on the permanent menu. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made homemade hoisin sauce for this recipe, and it turned out great! I also served it with chopped peanuts on top.

This was really good.  I used 2 breasts and 2 thighs and 1 pound of asparagus with about a tablespoon of minced garlic.  I served it over leftover white rice, and it went over well with my husband and two teenagers.  I tripled the hoisin sauce and brown sugar to have enough sauce for added chicken/asparagus.  I also used olive oil for sauteeing, and added 1 teaspoon smooth peanut butter to sauce to make up for not using peanut oil.  Will definitely make this again, maybe experimenting with beef and/or another vegetable.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy to make and extremely tasty.  I am partial to brown rice (the 50 minute version) and used that.  I also added sliced garlic with the asparagus.  That helps to infuse garlic into the oil (which I didn't have peanut oil so I used 3 T of veg oil and 1 T sesame oil.)  The final dish was absolutely delicious.  A keeper in our recipe box.

I have used this recipes many, many times.  I now only eat my asparagus stir-fryed!  Broccoli can be substituted as can brown rice for asparagus and the wild rice, respectively.  This is also great with the addition of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce.

This is a really tasty dish!  I also added summer squash (yellow zucchini), round onion, and red bell pepper.  I doubled the sauce and served it with jasmine rice.  My husband and I both agree that this one's a keeper!!!!

This recipe was great.  I cooked the chicken first then threw the asparagus in rather than cooking the asparagus separate.  I also added chopped garlic, soy sauce, and hot sauce to the sauce.  I would definitely double the sauce to give the rice a little more flavor.  I'm not wild about water chestnuts, but the asparagus had the same crunchy texture with that yummy asparagus flavor.  I've made a lot of asian recipes, but this one is one of my favorites.  I definitely recommend it.

Very, very good.  I made some changes:  first (and I recommend this highly) I marinated the raw chicken slices in egg white (to tenderize), soy sauce, cornstarch and a little sesamae oil.  This makes the chicken tender and delicious.  secondly I used lots of onions, some scallions in long pieces and sugar snap peas as my veggies.  Then thirdly, I served it over jasmine rice cooked with fresh garlic.  It was a huge family hit.  This dish will make a regular appearance on our dinner table.  Thank you Geezer

Anything with hoisin is always delicious.  I found the 1 chicken breast for 2 servings to be on the skimpy side, so instead I used 5-6 chicken breasts, at least a dozen asparagus stalks, and eyeballed the amount of hoisin when it was time to add.  I must have added too much brown sugar, as it was a little too sweet.  I made my preferred steamed rice instead of wild rice.  Fast and easy, definitely a keeper!  

And don't throw out the "tough bottoms"...I did but found even the bottom of the stalks stir-fried well and remained delicately crunchy.

YUM! I didn't have any hoisin sauce but as other reviewer did, I did it homemade, 4 Tbs Soy sauce, 2 Tbs peanut butter, 1 Tbs molasses or honey, 2 tsp of rice vinegar, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 2 tsp of sesame seed oil, 1 tsp Chinese hot sauce (to taste), 1/4 tsp black pepper. Mix everything in a small bowl until well blended and let it rest while you cook everything else. It was great! This is definitely a recipe to keep :)

Made exactly as written. This dish is bland. boring and barely edible. My son and I both threw it out after a few bites.  One of the very few times I have been let down by the ratings on this site.

My intention was to make the recipe exactly as is, but it didn't turn out that way.  I used the recipe as a guide and made a lot of changes.  I added a red pepper, water chestnuts, and baby corn.  The grocery didn't have hiosin sauce so I just added just brown sugar, pepper and soy sauce (nearly double what the recipe called for).  When the chicken was near done I added cayenne pepper for some spiciness.  Turned out fabulous!  Next time I think I am going to add peanuts for a bit of crunch, but the right vegetables make the dish stand out!

Simple and delicious. I used plain old olive oil in lieu of peanut, and the tip regarding throwing out the tough bottoms of the asparagus was very helpful.

We liked this but I don't love the flavor of Hoisin sauce which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  It may depend on the brand however.  I did add a little ginger and garlic while cooking.  Also added fresh red pepper in with the asparagus.

Delicious!  I didn't have any hoison sauce so I substituted with oyster sauce. I added some garlic, soy sauce and a dash of white wine like one reviewer suggested.  I also added bell peppers with the asparagus.  I served it over brown rice.  Absolutely delicious!

This was delicious. Didn't have peanut oil so I just used olive oil but it still tasted fantastic. I will certainly make this again.

I made a few changes to this dish to use items I had on hand... I replaced the peanut oil with 1/4 cup PB, but we all agreed it made the sauce too thick. We liked the PB in the sauce so I'll just reduce the amount next time. I added a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp powdered ginger to the sauce which gave it a nice flavor, and also cut down on the sweetness a little. I added mushrooms, but didn't like those in this dish. Lastly, I don't have a wok so I used my big, tall-sided frying pan.

I loved it!  It is so simple and really delicious. I used regular long grain rice because my husband doesn't like wild rice and it was a huge hit with him.  My two girls liked the sweet taste but not the asparagus.  This would work well with broccoli also.  Will make again!

I made this last night and it was just delicious.  The rice took about 1 hour to cook, otherwise the recipe was very easy, and oh so flavorful!  I would make this again, and again.

Used 2 chicken breast and substituted asparagus with other vegetables on hand.  Omitted the brown sugar and added bit more hoisin but too sweet for my palette.  Also added tsp of soy sauce and bit of sherry wine, garlic, ginger.  Next time I'll try decreasing hoisin and adding little more soy sauce.

Delicious. I couldn't find hoisin sauce at my store, but I did have a Thai sweet and spicy sauce so I used that instead.  Also dropped the brown sugar as the sauce was very sweet to begin with.  Funny that the picture has carrots, but the recipe doesn't call for them... Will be making again soon - especially with asparagus season weeks away.

Easy and yummy! I cooked just as the recipe says and turned out great. My 4 year old son is super picky eater and won't usually eat chicken or meat. Well, today he finished it all, first time in his life he ate all the chicken pieces that was served to him!

Ok, so maybe I tweaked this so much it needs to go in another recipe but I have to give credit to VISTACO for the inspiration.  I used rotisserie chicken (approx 2 cups).  Steamed the asparagus before adding.  Didn't use peanut oil since son is allergic to peanuts.  Added 1/2 t sesame oil, 1 t ginger and 1 t minced garlic.  Stir fried until heated through and the flavors blended.  Served over wild rice.  Loved it!

I used broccoli instead of asparagus because it's what i had on hand. the steps are great and the finished product is beautiful and almost perfect... but WAY too sweet for me... and I love sweet!! I've made it a couple of times now and plan to omit the brown sugar completely in the future.

Very easy to make. Works well with vegetables only as well, if you don't have or want chicken.

This was DELICIOUS. A tad sweet, so next time I will decrease the brown sugar to maybe 1/2 T instead of a whole but overall it was very tasty. I'm rating 4 stars because of the sweetness, and because I added extra veggies which made it MUCH tastier. I think as is, the recipe needs more to it to earn 5. If you add other veggies and cut down the sugar, easily 5 stars. I will use this sauce for other stir fry recipes as well.

Excellent! Very simple but very tasty.  I to modified it some, but not a lot.  I used honey instead of brown sugar, and added water chestnuts and bamboo shoots, which resulted in me having to make a little more of the Hoisin sauce mixture.  For even faster prep I used bottled minced garlic and ginger to flavor the oil.

I have been looking for a recipe to really "wow" my boyfriend, and this was it! One chicken breast and a 1/2 lb of asparagus was the perfect amount for the two of us. I will definitely be making this again!

Thank you so much for a WONDERFUL recipe!  My husband has NEVER liked asparagus and he LOVED it!  I served over Jasmine rice...serves beautifully!  Funny, the utility man had stopped by as I was making dinner and even remarked how this meal looked and smelled, "looks like a restaraunt in here, as a matter of fact better"!  Anyway, just wonderful!  Thank you!

Very good! I didnt use 3/4 cup of oil. I only used 2 tablespoons for the asparagus, and 1 tablespoon for the chicken (which i boiled prior and cubed.) Also added a bit of onion powder and garlic powder. Very good. will make again. **UPDATE** Made it again... used sesame oil instead of peanut oil.  Added a spoon of peanut butter.  Added 1/4 cut of soy and tsp of minced garlic.  I think next time i might use honey instead of sugar. Sweet but not too sweet!  Yummy!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes.  It's fast, easy, healthy, and my whole family loved it.  I also added cashews (thanks for the idea) since I already had some, and it made the recipe a bit more gourmet.

My husband and I loved this. I had one leftover fresh chicken breast that needed to be used up. I pounded it thin and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Didn't bother with the rice. Added some fresh ground black pepper and minced garlic. Also, used olive oil instead of peanut because I didn't have any. This was so quick and easy to prepare. Will make this again.

My husband and I love this quick yummy meal!  I boil my chicken breast and shred, then add to the asparagus and sauce mix and serve over whatever rice I have on hand.  You can't beat how fast this comes together!  I've made it with frozen sugar snap peas too and it's just as good.

Pleasantly surprised...didn't think sauce would be enough to carry the full meal.  The sauce is super sweet and too much would be a disaster.  The Wild rice was not my favorite, but it did help cut the sweetness.

i enjoyed this recipe. i had some hoisin sauce that i wanted to use so this was perfect. be careful though because hoisin sauce by itself is sweet, so this recipe has a sweet twang to it. really good. everyone loved it. probably would make it again

I enjoyed this recipe.  Like some of the other reviewers I added red pepper in with the aparagus, made for a very pretty presentation.  I cut back on the oil, making it more diet friendly, and used only 1 TBSP.  Worked out fine, didn't stick at all with non-stick pan.  Will more than likely make this again.  13 year old son gave it an ok, but he only gets excited for hot dogs, he did eat some of the asparagus though and that was a first!

We thought this was very good.  Also took the advice of several reviewers and served it with jasmine rice.  Added a great touch to the meal.  I also added a few slice mushrooms to the asparagus while it stir-fried.  Great recipe!

Great flavor. Only change I would make would be to use steamed rice. Addition of garlic and red pepper flakes also enhances flavor.

Delicious!!!  My family raved about this, (even tho my 5 year old picked out the asparagus), and my hubby said that it would put our favorite Chinese food restaurant out of business.
Give this a try, you won't be disappointed!

Fast and easy.  My family loved it.  I didn't care much for the wild rice, but the rest was delicious.  I think I'll substitute our usual rice (brown rice or long grain with wild rice) for the wild rice next time.

Excellent quick dish.  Like another reviewer, I too made my own hoisin sauce - about 1/2 cup and it was just the right amount of sauce.  Didn't add anything else as it contained peanut butter, sesame oil and soy sauce and honey which gave plenty of sweet, salty sauce.  Added a can of baby corn but could have used peppers, brocc, carrots... next time!

This recipe is idiot-proof! I'm not that great at stir-frying but I whipped this up and it was delicious. It was so easy/tasty that I made it 2 nights in a row.   The second time I made it I changed the recipe a bit - I cut the asparagus lengthwise and chopped into peanut-sized pieces, and also chopped the chicken smaller. I added finely chopped orange peppers, 2 tsp soy sauce and some cayenne pepper, and it was perfect. My boyfriend loved it. A very simple yet satisfying recipe.

Great recipe!!!  I did make a few changes though.  I used sesame oil (it's what I had in the house) instead of peanut oil and added peanut butter to the sauce as one reviewer recommended.  I also added minced garlic and ginger.  Wow!!!  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe last night for dinner and it was great.  Perfect for 2 people.  The only change I made was olive oil for peanut oil.  Next time I will add in more veggies.  Definitely will keep it in my dinner rotation!

This is a good recipe that my picky eaters even liked.  I left out the brown sugar to cut some of the carbs and may even cut the rice next time.  It's one of those recipes that you can easily experiment with.

This was okay... it kind of started to taste better the more we ate it. We thought it was missing something and after adding a little bit of soy sauce, thought it improved. Served it with steamed white rice.

I gave this 5 stars because it was so easy and a very good stir fry...it really shows you how easy and versatile that stir fry is to do.  You can definitely make this with half the oil..without a problem.  Any added veggies you want to throw in for taste or color will add to the dish.  I do suggest doing the long grain or brown rice or something that goes well with stir fry as opposed to the wild rice.
Yummy!

Made this last night. Great base recipe. Infused the peanut oil with a little sesame oil, a clove of garlic smashed and a couple of slices of ginger (Removed before beginning stirfry). Mixed green beans in with asparagus. Added a tsp of peanut butter to sauce. Delicious! Will definitely make this again.

I made the H sauce from reading the comments.  Used white sugar and added a little extra molasses. Other than that followed the recipe. Will make it again as it was easy and delicious. I have liked all recipes from Allrecipes.

So easy and so good.  Kind of sweet though.  I'll leave out the brown sugar next time.  Also, most of us added wasabi or sriracha, so I will add a sprinkle or two of red pepper flakes.

Super quick and simple recipe which my picky girls loved!! Added a little garlic paste and ginger paste to the wok which added a little more flavor to the dish, as others reommended. My 8-year-old daughter said, 'Easy enough for a kid to cook!' (With supervision...woks get HOT!)

Didn’t have peanut oil. Used sesame oil instead. A hit with everyone in our 5 person family.

Delicious, simple and healthy. Good sauce. Also made parmesean pasta for the non-rice lovers.

Very tasty with the hoisin sauce. I used seasame oil and a half cup of chicken stock. The asparagus is the key here but I did add other vegetables (carrots, nappa, and water chestnut). I thicken the sauce with some corn starch.

This is a good basic recipe.  I did "doctor" it up a bit as some reviewers suggested by adding ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes to the sauce.

The chicken, wild rice and asparagus are wonderful together.  This was the first time I used Hosin and my family and I did not like the taste or smell.  Luckily, I had them taste the sauce before combining it with the chicken and asparagus.  We improvised with Italian flavors and topped off the meal with shredded parmesan.  My family enjoyed it this way.

Great Recipe! My teenagers loved it! I modified it a bit by subsituting fish sauce and adding peanut butter. A very simple recipe, which made it even better

We did this recipe with some changes. We did'nt marinate the chicken over night but we brushed with honey and vinegar just the same and it came delicious. The chicken was skinless and stuffed the chicken which was halved before.

This was terrible. I think it was the hoisin sauce that doomed the flavor.

I  made this for dinner tonight.  It was delicious.  However, I did find it a little on the sweet side.  Next time I will try half of the brown sugar.  I also added broccoli and cauliflower to the asparagus as my kids won't eat asparagus.

I used basmati rice instead of the wild rice.  My family loved this recipe!  My son added red pepper flakes for a little spice.  Next time I will use tofu and more vegetables.

Used brown rice because I did not want to purchase more rice.  Very tasty, my 6 year old daughter even would eat it.
