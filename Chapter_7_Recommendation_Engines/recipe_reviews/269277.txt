I just made this recipe today for a Christmas Eve party (2018).  The meld of flavors is awesome with just a bit of a kick.  The colors are something just perfect for Christmas - Red, White and Green.   I used Monterey Jack cheese instead of cheddar because I wanted to keep with the color scheme.  The taste is still yummy!   I will post a picture later and other peoples' opinions of the recipe.  I happen to love cranberries and jalapenos and everything else that goes into making these pretty pinwheels.

UPDATE:  Just added photo.  They are impressive.

I didn't have cilantro and to be honest it really didn't need it. Otherwise, these are awesome just as they are and so pretty for the Christmas holiday.

We've made this twice for parties and it has been a hit. 

As written, the recipe provides barely enough of the cream cheese mix to cover four tortillas. The second time around, I added a couple of ounces of whipped cream cheese to make it go farther (and to make it easier to spread). I also use more than the 1/4 cup of the cranberry mixture since it is so darn delicious... and there is still plenty left over to top turkey sandwiches!

I enjoyed how quick and easy this recipe is. There are a few changes I'll make next time I do this.  I liked the mix of sweet, tart and spicy.

I made this for Christmas Eve party & everyone liked it.  I wanted people to have a more healthy option besides all the goodies.  I made exactly as written, except my jalepeno's were frozen from our garden.  I think it mellowed them a bit..could have used just a tad more zing.  Pretty presentation and fairly easy to put together too !

Was a big hit at a family preChristmas get together.   Great blend of flavors.  Nothing overbearing.

I made the rolls and they were wonderful. They remind me of rice rolls very good and these rolls will help you use up all the left over turkey.
