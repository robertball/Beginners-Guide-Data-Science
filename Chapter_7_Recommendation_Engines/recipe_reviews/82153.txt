Great recipe!  I don't personally care for bottled ranch as it is too tangy, so I used the Hidden Valley Buttermilk Packets to make my own ranch.

Nice dressing, i think it would also work well as a dipping sauce.  Only change I made was to use homemade ranch dressing rather than the bottled kind.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Spicy Spicy Ranch Dressing Haiku: "What a funky dip! Good for 'Baked Zucchini Fries.' I'll make this again!" I scaled this waaaay back b/c we only needed a bit of sauce to dip our AR's "Oven Baked Zucchini Fries" in, and used Sriracha instead of Tabasco, and Texas Pete instead of Frank's. (Also used my fave Ranch dressing, Naturally Fresh Lite Ranch.) The seasoning and sauces provided a nice punch to the Ranch, and I'm anxious to try it again for dipping other things into ... I'm thinking Fried Pickles or dribbled atop a baked potato.

My new favorite dressing...so good! I didn't have Tabasco so I substituted Habanero sauce, which made it Spicy Spicy Spicy Ranch. Mmmmmmm!

This is delicious! I made the baked zucchini sticks that are on this site. So I was looking for a spicy dip. And spicy it is! I mixed a packet of ranch dressing mix with a container of sour cream. Everyone loved it!

It may be the hot sauce I used, but I did not care for this recipe. I also used a Kraft dressing, not Hidden Valley. It’s possible the combination of ingredients I used made it with caused the weird taste.
