Don't be fooled! This recipe will make you a plethora of cookies! I expected three dozen, but it made closer to 12 dozen. 

I made mine with Quaker quick oats.

Yes, cookies start out very tiny - a level teaspoon - they spread dramatically. 

Tip: if cookies end up touching, wait until cooled to break apart.

I just tried the exact same recipe out of my mom's 1963 Cooky book.  (Yep that's how it was spelled 50 years ago.)  I came on here to see if there was anything better because mine look like regular cookies in the middle and the nice stuff on the outside.  I didn't have a teaspoon to actually measure so this is probably my problem.  I also didn't use molasses.  After the first batch I took smaller scoops and patted them flatter.  Looking better that way, but I'll try to be more accurate next time.  Also in the same book, it later describes that there is a certain stage after baking where the cook(y)s are soft enough and strong enough to roll around something.  Makes for a very nice presentation; the kind of very special cookie people would look forward to at Christmas time!  Oh and I forgot to add that parchment paper was a lifesaver.  My spatula squished some of the beautiful crispy crumble, but parchment paper made it so simple.

Pretty good cookie!  Very delicate and candy-like.  I wouldn't recommend making them in a case where they have to be transported, as they are thin and break easily.  They're nice crumbled over ice cream or yogurt or served whole with coffee or tea for dessert.

This was the best oatmeal cookie I have had.  To make it a little healthier I used sucant (dried cane juice) instead of brown sugar and I used spelt flour instead of all-purpose white flour.  The cookies spread out quite a bit while cooking so right when they came out of the oven I gently pushed the spreaded out parts toward the center.  I had no problem with them sticking to the cookie sheet.  When they had cooled they held together well.

BEST COOKIES IN THE WORLD!!! I had rated them before but they didn't turn out right. Three words...NON-STICK PARCHMENT PAPER. Made all the difference in the world. I followed the recipe exactly, but used the parchment paper this time. Oh, and instead of stirring all the ingredients together, I used a mixer the second time. Made for a prettier cookie. They still look a bit greasy at first, but the longer they sit, this will go away... if you can wait that long.

The crunchy edges are wonderful. With the parchment paper, they lift right off the paper...no spatula needed to break the fragile edges. They MUST sit and cool before you remove them from the pan. It only takes 2-5 minutes for the to harden.

I wouldn't try these without the parchment paper again. Not a recipe for beginners, but as long as you follow the directions and time them just so, they are PERFECT! Best cookies ever!

Fabulous recipe.  I made it last fall for work and have been requested to make it every time since.  I have substituted all sorts of gluten-free flours for the all-purpose flours and they've been tasty.   (All sorts include sweet rice, brown rice, pre-toasted quinoa, lentil, garbanzo, teff, and millet)

I used dark brown sugar so I eliminated the molasses.  I'm glad I had a silicone sheet to use, so they didn't stick, but they look like they could have stuck a lot on an unprotected cookie sheet.  The taste was just so-so, very crisp and rather candy-like lacy edges, but the center tastes just like oatmeal with brown sugar on it.  I dunno, I just expected it to taste yummier somehow.

I've had this recipe for many years and just tried it again since many years.  I remember them as great tasting.  They flopped....I don't know what I did wrong.  I tried it on parchment paper, plain metal cookie sheet, same thing.  The butter/liquid portion separated and I was left with a lump of oatmeal.

These cookies are absolutely delicious. I did not add molasses. After pouring the melted butter over the oats, I let it sit for about 30 minutes. I was so anxious about making the cookies that I couldn’t wait any longer. Boy am I glad I didn’t!!  My recipe yielded about 7 dozen cookies. You won’t have to worry about having too many, they go really quickly.

My mother made these starting in the 1960s and I loved them; she rolled them on the handle of a wooden spoon to make horns and I thought that was wonderful! I just made them with my grandchildren, easy and we got  6 dozen. I didn't change a thing.

You need to specify quick oats. They don't work with old fashioned oats. They are edible but are not lace cookies. Worst recipe ever.  They are oatmeal cookies with lacy edges. I'd advise anyone looking for a lace cookie recipe that this is not it.

Worked out very well.  Pretty easy to make and  everybody likes them.  You definitely need to make sure you do not drop the cookies too close together on the sheet, they do spread.  They really have a nice appearance and right away you will see where the lace in the name comes from.

I've made these often and while they always taste very good, they always are impossible to get off the sheet in any semblance of a cookie.  They always end up looking like a ball of goe or (wife's description) like I made them.  Still, they taste great.

I make these for my daughter every Christmas!!!  It's not complete till she opens her tin of these light & crispy dreams.   This will be her 15th year of  me giving them to her!!  This year,,.. I thought I'd take a hint from another baker & roll them up while they're  still warm & pliable..&.... then,... after they cool off,... I'm going to dip just one end in some melted milk chocolate.  Looks like the special cookies (Florentines maybe?) from Pepperidge Farms.   Yum!

My family loved these cookies! It's a good thing this recipe makes a lot, because they would not have been any left for company!  I used Quaker Quick Oats, because that's what I had on hand and I eliminated the molasses because I didn't. It made about 96 cookies. They came out so thin and delicate - they melt in your mouth and taste divine. I'm more of a cook than a baker, but I had no trouble getting these right.  This recipe went into the favorites list and will definitely be made again!

I just made these cookies & they're very good! I didn't have molasses and used maple syrup instead. The time frame in the oven was off should be at least 9min so that they'll hold together better. Nothing was said about storing, I thing freezing them is not a option, , they'll probably soften.

I just made these (exactly as recipe shows) and the husband unit says they are fantastic! I remember having these as a child once I tasted them. I am not a huge molasses lover but added it after reading other reviews. I loved them as they are but will try to omit/replace molasses next time to see the taste difference. My favorite part of the recipe is that it came out exactly like it was supposed to :)
