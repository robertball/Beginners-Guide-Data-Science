One thing I see many of these fried rice recipes missing that I've found really makes a difference is to refrigerate the cooked rice overnight before cooking.

very easy and very fast.  i cooked the rice in chicken stock for added flavor (made sure to make extra to use in other dishes).  also added a white onion to the scallion, peas, and some bok choy.  Everyone went nuts!  definitely something to make in bulk for leftovers.

Really good!  Instead of chicken I used chopped shiitake mushrooms and peas.  It was Delish and it the spot for my fried rice craving!

Wow this was delicious. I used more soy than the recipe called for and simply added as I went. Also I added frozen peas and carrots before the rice was added. I will use one egg first and then scramble the other in prior to the end. This was absolutely fantastic with extra garlic!

Absolutely delicious! I added in a leftover chicken thigh baked previously in a sweet and spicy mustard sauce.

I made this yesterday and I would absolutely make it again.  Two things I wanted to add.  I made the rice and then put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes to cool it off.  Some of the comments for this and other fried rice recipes said to used leftover or cold rice Since I made the rice the same day I did this instead.  Also, the other comments are correct - put the soy sauce in to taste. I added peas and water chestnuts.  I think you could add whatever you like.

I was skeptical about this recipe because there wasn't many ingredients required. I thought I would need more ingredients for the Hibachi taste but I was so wrong. This was very good. Both me and my boyfriend thought it tasted exactly like the restaurant hibachi chicken and rice. It was ten times better. I cooked this with frozen spring rolls from the grocery store. I almost feel like cooking this again tomorrow because I don't have leftovers. The only thing that I would change is to use soy sauce according to your own desired taste. I decided to do this and it was perfect. I think if I used what the recipe called for it would have been too much. Try it you will not be disappointed.

Very easy to make recipe. My kids love it and have asked me to make it regularly since the first time we tried it. If you have access to a rice cooker, I would suggest using cooked rice from the same day cooked; it makes it easier to blend and less time consuming to break down. I have family who was raised on hibachi fried rice and have said that this recipe tastes very good.

This rice was amazing, I made it with double the rice and me, my wife and her cousin killed it.  Only complaint is I wanted more!  Not to change the recipe but I added a tiny piece of butter, maybe 1 tablespoon, and some more oil and soy to compensate for the extra rice.  My wife said it tasted exactly like the Hibachi rice from our honeymoon which she was obsessed with.  I will add this to our top list of meals.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was really good. Though I did make a few changes to make it healthier instead of white rice I use brown rice and cook it in vegetable broth. I also used onions, red and green peppers in the rice. I season my chicken with white pepper and adobo, and cook that with the snap peas and green onions and eggs together. I also use organic low sodium soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce, it came out wonderful! My boyfriend was scraping the plate.

This recipe was very good. Everyone enjoyed it but, they said a bit too much soy. We think you should let your guests add however much soy they want. We don't necessarily hate soy but we agree that to much soy can destrOY

I will make this again and again.  
I did increase the amount to 3 cups rice and used 3 eggs, etc.
It is wonderful!
Any meat or vegetables could be added for a meal.
I made with beef cubes seasoned with salt pepper and garlic.

This was awesome! I had been using another recipe I found on Pinterest for some time and I thought this one was way better.  Followed the recipe as instructed, but added a little bit of sesame oil. And enjoyed it with some sriracha sauce. Delicious!

Quick, easy, and only a few ingredients. We usually grill some steak or chicken, make this rice, and throw out some Terry Ho’s Yum Yum Sauce for our “home-cooked hibachi” night.

I use this recipe as a base.  I always add 1 medium onion, about a cup of frozen peas, usually 2 zucchini, and a can of water chestnuts.  I start with cooking the onion for about 5 minutes on medium, then add the garlic(which I always double, we love garlic) and zucchini.  After a couple minutes, I line the pan with all the veggies that I have cooked, making room in the center to cook the eggs.  I add 1 T. of butter in the center for cooking the eggs.  That little bit of butter adds another layer of flavor to the recipe.  Once the eggs are done I add the rice, rest of the veggies, and soy sauce(4 to 6 Tablespoons).  Before serving I also add salt and pepper to taste and about 1 teaspoon of sesame oil to it all and mix well.  My son doesn't like the texture of sesame seeds.  The sesame oil gives the taste of the seeds without the texture of them.  Every time I make this everyone raves about how it's better than take out and just as good if not better than the hibachi restaurant.  I hope this helps others.  When it comes to cooking recipes, I love experimenting!  BTW, I cooked the chicken separate.  My son is autistic.  I've learned to cook certain ways so he will eat everything.  And chicken on the side and not mixed in is another thing that helps him.  Enjoy!!

Made no changes to this recipe and it was a big hit. No leftovers at all. For my picky family that means it was really good.

This was great! I added some chopped bell pepper and a load of white mushrooms. Be sure to add soy sauce to taste. Crushed red pepper flakes added a bit of spice, too!

This is a good recipe! I used light soy sauce so I needed a touch of salt. Substituted chicken for chickpeas and added peas. Really yummy!

So fast and simple while being so flavorful! I did the freezer trick to be able to make the fried rice right after cooking my rice, and it worked well. I did half white rice and half brown for a little nutrition (it changes the texture a little but had the same great flavor as normal).

This was terrific but I added shrimp and sesame seeds. I also used a touch of sesame oil. You can really add a variety of veggies or meat. It's a versatile recipe and quite delicious.

Be sure to use SHORT GRAIN rice when preparing this, and ideally, wash your rice twice first. (AKA rinsing the rise with water twice before cooking it). And be sure the rice is cooled off (put in the refrigerator or freezer for a bit to get the rice at room temperature.

Ah-maze-ZING! I followed the recipe exactly but ended up adding a splash of water for additional moisture, a splash of sesame oil, and a splash of teriyaki sauce to balance out the sesame oil while cooking. Go VERY easy if you use sesame oil; it can overpower this particular dish very quickly. A teensy bit though added a wonderful depth of flavor. All in all, an excellent recipe.

Made it the whole family loved it and I adjusted the soy sauce to our taste and I put the rice in the freezer for 1 hour.  And I added the green onions at the very end. All in all the dish was amazing I plan on making it again. (I was unable to take a picture because the food was gone within seconds of it being made.)

I love this recipe! I added sesame seeds and three tablespoons of teriyaki sauce, and I also reduced the amount of soy sauce to two tablespoons. It was soooo delicious :)

I make this all the time. Kids love it. It’s as good as you’d get in a restaurant and you can customize it to your liking. I used 3 cups of rice but I undercook the rice, so it’s not too soft. My kids love the hibachi rice and they said my first few attempts at this were good but a little

I did add lots of veggies (broccoli, matchstick carrots, green beans, a little celery and water chestnuts.) Cooked using sesame oil rather than olive oil, and added some sesame seeds as well. I had more than 2 cups of rice (probably 3) and used 1/2 the soy sauce, but 3 tablespoons of teriyaki in addition, but I think with the extra rice and the add ins, I should have still used 3 tablespoons of soy sauce because it wasn't salty enough to me, and I am the type to rub salt off of potato chips. I forgot the cilantro, but I believe that would be a good addition for next time as well.

This was way easier than I anticipated, and the hubby loved it! I used brown rice instead of white, as that's all I usually buy. I've made it twice already! This will be a regular recipe for us, I'm sure. Cheap, easy, healthy.

I am not a big lover of rice but I have to say., This recipe was absolutely delicious.  Was definitely a winner with the whole family.  So simple to make. Will  make this a staple in our household.  I did use brown rice instead of white and had to go back and make a 2nd batch.

Perfect recipe. I just needed to get the basic flavor I was looking for. Now that I've made this a time or ten, I feel comfortable adding veggies and various meats that I like. Definitely my favorite go-to for leftover rice, in fact I find myself making extra rice so that this can be on the menu the next day.

I love adding mushrooms, baby bok choy, and shrimp. My favorite. I also cheat and use garlic paste. I also add a little sesame oil for flavor.

Seemed a bit bland to me but my two picky eaters loved it and asked to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I added shredded carrots and eyeballed the oil and soy sauce. Definitely a better alternative to the frozen fried rice I've been feeding them lately.

The rice was so good. I made it without the chicken since we wanted steak and chicken on the side. paired it with the yum yum sauce. My husband couldn't get enough of it. I will definitely be making it again.

Made this twice. Once as the recipe says, and once I replaced the soy sauce with Teriyaki sauce. I like it much better with the Teriyaki. But both are very good.

We added teriyaki sauce after it felt like it was missing something the first time we made it. That made it more to our liking, but I still feel like it's missing something. I just can't figure out what! Good basic recipe though!

Amazing! I substituted the olive oil for 5tbsp of butter, used 4 eggs instead of 2 (we like a lot of eggs in our Hibachi rice), added 2 tbsp of chopped white onions and 5-6 tbsp of soy sauce instead of 3 tbsp. It was absolutly  delish.

This was my first attempt at stir fry- loved it! Only reason I rated it a 4 star is because I made modifications to make it as tasty as wanted. For those of you who hate people that do this, I'm sorry. Feel this is a great base recipe and go from there. My cooking is never to the book! 

Seasoning I added: salt/pepper, ground ginger and garlic. Based on my mood this can change! Chicken bullion is a nice add as well. 

Veggies added: Bok Choy, water crests, shiitake mushrooms, mixed veggies (peas, corn, whatever needs to be used) 

Frying everything like this was quick, easy and a great way to use up leftovers !

The only slight change I made to this recipe is that I used cubed seared chicken that I made in the skillet before I made the rest of the dish. Aside from that, my only advice is to cook the rice the day before and refrigerate it, like other reviewers have said. The dish was perfect for two people with just a little bit leftover, it would be a stretch to feed three people and it definitely needs a side dish to go along with it. I will be making this again because it tastes authentic and great!

This was so easy to make and incredibly tasty!  I used 5 fresh garlic cloves (we love garlic) and it really kicked it up a notch.  My husband hates anything rice, but he loved this and came back for seconds!

I've made this recipe a few times without the chicken, and every time, it has ended up amazing! My friends and family adore the change from our old recipe. (I've even been asked to make a big batch for a road trip coming up!) This is a very easy, very delicious recipe. It's also great if you have to substitute onion and garlic powder (for those times you're mysteriously out of fresh ingredients (;  )if you don't mind the loss in texture.

This was so delicious and my family loved it!  I only made two changes - I used 1/8 cup of oil (instead of 1/4), and added a cup of frozen mixed veggies (thawed) to the pan before I added the rice.  So good!

Good tasting easy recipe. I used brown rice instead of white and added some steamed peas, corn and 1.5 toasted quorn patty. Next time i'de probably add more onions for taste and extra oil for some crisp.

This was great! I made it with shrimp instead of chicken...seasoned and lightly sautéed the shrimp beforehand, then followed the recipe replacing chicken w shrimp. I've tried shrimp fried rice before and failed but this was delicious! Highly recommend!!

This was great. Tasted just like getting it from a Chinese restaurant.  It is very versatile (add anything you like and want) and easy to make. Make sure to use day old rice. Using fresh rice makes it mushy.  I've made this for family and friends and they all wanted the recipe!  This is a must try. I have added it to our regular recipe rotation!

We had this twice in a week because my kids asked for it again. Everyone enjoys it! This dish is also good made with wild rice and I agree with others who said letting the rice chill for a while before making the dish makes it better.

It was so easy and very tasty.  I've done it a few times now throwing in random veggies like broccoli and mushrooms.  I usually use some white onion to that I throw in with the garlic and it's all been tasty.

I added peas, a dash of onion powder, and chopped spinach along with the green onion and garlic, and then after I added the rice I added two tbsp of butter. I suggest if you think it's too much soy sauce, use low-sodium instead. Me and my husband like it soy-flavorful, so we added 3 tbsp of low-sodium and then a big dash of regular soy sauce, and it came out fanatic.

This was pretty good. It could have used a bit more flavors, but it was was quick and easy to make. Would definitely make again.

Great recipe! I didn't have olive oil so I used butter, and subbed chicken for shrimp. Delicious!

My favorite recipe of fried rice! Instead of chicken I use shrimp though.
