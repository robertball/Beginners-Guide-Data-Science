We love the Diablo sauce from Torchy's. Your recipe is fantastic! Thank you for sharing!  We added our own tweaks. Added 2 tbsp of sour cream, 6oz of tomato puree and 4oz of tomato paste. Delicious!

its close. I doesn't have the same consistency but the flavor is great. I wouldn't say it was a knock off, but its a good hot sauce recipe.

I made this last night and  it was so good! We don't use soybean oil because it is GMO but we just replaced it with avocado oil. It  was very hot but on some chicken tacos with some mango or pineapple inside and it all balances out.
