It seemed obvious to me that the 1/2 tablespoon of butter is a typo.  1/2 cup of butter makes a beautiful crust.  I made this for a pot luck, and it was a hit!  I almost didn't want to tell people how easy it was.  More fun to let them think I spent hours and hours making it.

This recipe was so exquisite!  Thank you for sharing.  I used nectarines instead of mangos as the mangos at the store were looking pretty sorry.  It turned out great with nectarines too.  This was easy to make and absolutely delicious.  It looks elegant too.  My boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it.

It was incredibly simple to make and absolutely delicious.  One suggestion:  chill for at least 2-3 hours before serving for best results.

I agree with previous reviews that the crust need the extra butter.  Also, the consistency was very soupy although I added an extra 8 oz of cream cheese.  Has good potential though.

I also had the problem that the filling didn't set, but I just put it in the freezer for a few hours and then served it frozen and the flavor was still great. My husband gave it a good, which is high praise. I did use half a peach instead of mango's because that was what I had on hand and it seemed like what was called for in the recipe was way too much. I also made a graham cracker crust instead of the crust the recipe called for. But all in all the filling is what makes this dessert and that was delicious.

Chilled for five hours before serving at a dinner party, and it was like a pie plate full of soup. It never fully set. The taste was fine, but Iwon't be making this again.

I didn't have small tart pans, so used a regular size pie plate. Didn't feel like making crust, so I used a simple cobbler topping as the crust. Baked it for 25 min @ 350 degrees, let it cool, then filled it. The filling is delicious! It is soft and a bit runny as stated in other reviews.  I'm thinking next time, will beat the sugar and cream cheese together first, run the mango thru the fool processer, then stir it into the cream cheese mixture.  The filling  is worth making again. My husband said he could eat the whole pie!

I used frozen mango, 3/4 cup. Add a little vanilla or almond extract. You could also use some instant cheesecake pudding mix to thicken if it doesn't work for you.

This was a really great recipe - a great way to add fruit into the cream cheese filling.  I would advocate using only the freshest of each ingredient.

I used very fresh fruit and chilled the tart for several hours before serving, and it turned out beautifully. It's perfect for entertaining - simple but impressive.

It's mango season - We love mangos. Saw this recipe and dove in. It's quick and easy to prepare, summery and delicious. No problems with thickening. If you like mango, you'll like it.

While the mango flavored cream cheese was tasty, mine did not set either. and there obviously isn't the right amount of butter.  Use a regular shortbread recipe or buy a gramcracker crust for a short cut.  I don't know how to thicken up the filling,  Perhaps don't add all of the mango.

I wish I could give this zero stars. I added more butter to the crust, because it seemed like 1 tbls. wasn't enough. Even then, it was still as hard as concrete. The mango/cream cheese combination tasted like blue cheese with lemon juice. The WORST recipe I've tried off this site.

I quite liked the mango and cream cheese combo but my husband thought the amount of mango added was a bit overpowering.  The problem I had was with the crust.  1/2 tablespoon of butter seemed too little but no other reviews mentioned it so I went with it.  As a result I wasn't able to cut it in to get course crumbs and had to keep adding water to hold the dough together.  After a few hours in the fridge it hardened to a rock like consistency.  I'd love to try this again - anyone have any suggestions?

After reading the rave reviews for this recipe, I was excited to make this.  Blended mango and cream cheese is a terrible combination as prescribed in this recipe.  The only components worth eating are the fresh blueberries on top and the dough - hopefully neither haven't been tainted by the filling.

Finally found a yummy recipe to use my dad's frozen blueberries. I made a mini version of this with my pampered chef tart pan. I cheated by using prepared pie dough and used a kids cup to make tiny circles for my pan. I also substituted 2 tablespoons of canned mangoes that I chopped up. I stirred them into the filling after I mixed all the other filling ingredients. I also added 1/2 tablespoons of vanilla extract. For the dough I only cooked it for 8-10 minutes. Just until I could first smell them. For a topping I could only fit 3 blueberries, but man these were delicious! Taking some to share with co-workers tomorrow. I am sure they will love them too. Definitely a great bring to the party kinda thing!

I loved the taste of this recipe the mangos went well with the blue berries and it was a combination that I had not really to work well together.  The only problem is that my pie was still runny even after being chilled for 6 hrs.  I ended up placing it in the freezer, but in the end me and my family still loved the taste.  Could anybody please tell me what I did wrong, this is a recipe I would like to repeat but I wish I could do it right!
