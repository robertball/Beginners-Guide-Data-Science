It is critical to note that you DO NOT add the cola and milk in any order, you must add the cola prior to the milk or the carbonation will curdle the milk.
It is best to use a generic brand cola or to leave your "coke" open to the point where it is slightly flat.
Bar cola is rarely ever very fizzy and it is the reason it works well in the drink

I'm the original poster of this recipe and I just wanted to say that this isn't the recipe as I submitted it...I have never made this with coffee liquer...I'm sure that would be good though.

This was great! Has quite a kick. I didn't use the coffee liquer as original submitter suggested. Also, didn't have highball glasses so I used pina colada glasses. Thanks for the post! PS Also used Cherry Coke, gave a nice cherry flavor (:

I thought there was a little too much coffee flavor, but my husband really liked it. Next time I will use some of the other suggestions.

This was okay. Isn't this called a Black Russian, too? I think I've had it before. Not my cup of tea, but drinkable. I used Diet Coke and fat free half-n-half to cut calories but still get my drink on. ;)

This drink is suprisingly pretty good. I can only drink one becuase the consistency gets to me after that.

This was an awesome drink. The only thing I did was leave out the coffee liquer and used vanilla vodka.  Will def make over and over.

A diluted White Russian with added Coke. I liked the fizz the carbonation of the coke gave it. Will make again with less coke and in a smaller glass, like a tumbler.

Works perfectly. No curdling if you make the recipe in order they are listed. I clicked on this recipe b/c of your awesome user name.

Well I made one exactly as the recipe read, then I made another one exactly as the recipe read, then my rade anothur robe, and arothurrun... all joking aside this is DELICIOUS! Reminds me of a Black Russian, very tasty. I have to admit I got curious after a few and decided to mix a pineapple/coconut carbonated water instead of soda, it was pretty good but stick to the recipe you'll be pleasantly surprised.
