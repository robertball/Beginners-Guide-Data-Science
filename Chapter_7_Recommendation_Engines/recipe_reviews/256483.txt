I made a double batch of this as written for my husband and kids and they did not like it.  Even after scraping off the "sauce", they didn't like how it made the meat taste.

As noted, I used mayo instead of Helman's.  I found this to be a great way to cook the tails!  The meat was super tender and flavorful.  I will definitely use this again.

Made as written except that I used mayo instead of Miracle Whip as the recipe submitter mentioned in the footnotes. This was excellent! Thanks for sharing!
