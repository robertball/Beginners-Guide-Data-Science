This recipe is not written correctly.  First it has no sugar in the recipe and the amount of cinnamon is way too much.

I was looking at Apple Butter recipes & came across this one. I think it's supposed to read apple cider NOT apple cider vinegar. There would be no need to add vinegar, esp that much! Hope this helps. I haven't made this, so don't go by my rating, just wanted to help out.

I have to agree with TBURKE on this one. It has no sugar in it and is very bitter tasting.  I wasted a lot of money, not to mention time,  making this recipe.

Keep in mind that there are two types of apple butter, sweet and tart. This is a tart one, so if you want a sweet one, look elsewhere. Many people prefer it to be tart, so don't complain if you didn't think about the ingredient list.

This was a mistake. I only added half the amount of spices and I had to add 5X more apples. I could not rate it low enough -5 would be closer to correct.

This recipe should use Apple Cider and not  cider vinegar. Thats why it is so bitter.

I think you left a critical word out of this recipe.  In describing the apples, "PEELED, cored, chopped.

I added sugar, sorry I didn’t measure, just added to taste. But we love it. Will make again, mama thought it was too tart. Next batch will substitute ACV with water.  Love the tartness, she didn’t.

Made the mistake of using cider vinegar. Just apple cider should be used. Plus the spices are way off, especially the clove.

Based on the recipe, I could infer that this apple butter would be somewhat interesting, but would keep the traditional apple butter flavor. I was right! Original, yet traditional! Loved it.
