Excellent recipe! I stuck to the recipe but doubled it. I was hoping that it wouldn't be to spicy for the family, they said it had a kick, but they loved it! I usually add Sriracha to whatever I eat, not this time. I loved it!

Fantastic recipe, my family enjoyed it— I didn’t use fish— added calamari, mussels and clams— added a bit of Tabasco— wonderful! Thank you for sharing!!

I love this soup. This is a good recipe. I made two different batches. I doubled the shrimp since I did not have fish. I am a pescatarian so I left out the chorizo. I made a second batch for my boyfriend with chorizo. He is from El Salvador. He ate his soup with rice, corn tortillas, and Salvadoran cheese. I will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly with 2 exceptions — I diced a canned chipotle chile instead of using the ground chile and I omitted the cod as suggested by previous reviewers. The soup was hearty and had quite a kick — just the way I like it! A party in my mouth! I’ll definitely be making this delicious recipe again!

I thought it was great as did my guests!  I added a pound of mussels and doubled the chorizo with 42 oz of chicken stick!  I will make it again!

This recipe is pretty good. I used Johnsonville chorizo and sliced it up and it was wonderful. (Target didn't have original chorizo.) Very flavourful, just enough spice, but... the cod is a little too fishy tasting for me.  Also, it doesn't say where to add the salsa Verde so I just assumed to add it in step 2. I would make this again but maybe without the cod.

I will definitely make this dish again.  It was really good w/ just enough spice to satisfy me but not too spicy for my husband.

This was very tasty! The only major changes I made were to use fresh tomatoes and fresh corn, because I had those on hand and wanted to use them up. Nice amount of heat, and I think you could easily modify the amount by how hot the salsa verde you use is.

I wasn't able to find chorizo at the store so I tried to season the ground pork with homemade adobo spices. Didn't have quite the flavor I wanted until the next day. Really really nice flavors.

It had the nice slow roast spicy heat and was perfect as it. Next we're going to try some mussels & clams, cioppino style. Its our new base for when we want a spicy tomato seafood stew. Yum!!
