We did not care for this, especially the sauce. The lemon zest seemed to overpower the whole thing. I ended up throwing out the gravy and smothering the beef in a store-bought beef gravy.

Brisket was great!  I added 1 sliced onion when I was cooking the garlic and carrots and a head of cabbage (cut in 1/4) right before putting in the oven. I made gravy by adding 1/4 cup cornstarch to 1/2 c water to the drippings.  Delish!

The brisket was flavorful and tender, and the gravy was the best I think I've ever made. I normally use flour to thicken and have used water in the past to add to the pan drippings. Swanson Beef Broth gave it such a hearty beef flavor and the garlic really brought it up a notch.  The fresh ingredients also made all the difference. This recipe will definitely be in my future menus.

Don't let the 36 cloves of garlic keep you from making this awesome recipe.  The garlic was golden brown, nutty and not at all overpowering to the dish.  In fact, with the fresh garlic, fresh rosemary, and fresh thyme,  it all came together like the perfect song.  My husband, who doesn't really enjoy beef very much, couldn't stop taking bites of it.  Every time he put a fork full into his mouth, he made that ahhh sound.  Thanks Swanson!!!   I LOVE brisket but don't make it very often because of my husband, but now, I think I can  sneak this in every month without any static from him ;-)  I encourage you to try this recipe.  
I did salt and pepper the brisket before browning it and about half way through, I put in some Large chunks of potato, 1 onion, quartered with the stem attached so that it didn't come apart and some peeled carrots , about 3 inches long.  My husband is crazy about carrots and I thought they would compliment this recipe.  When I strained the pan drippings, I made the garlic mixture in my Magic Bullet.  That is a GREAT tip that I will use from now on.  The garlic mixture is genius and helped to bring the pan drippings together to make the gravy.  Another thing I learned from this recipe is the lemon zest!   I have never done that before.  I believe that the combination of the garlic mixture, the red wine vinegar in the beginning, and the lemon zest is the thing that sets this recipe apart from the others.  I couldn't be happier with the results of this recip
