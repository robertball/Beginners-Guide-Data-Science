I used a chuck roast that I cut in pieces and cooked in a pressure cooker for 45 min after it got to pressure. I'm not sure if it needed that long but I wanted to err on the side of well-cooked. It was very tender and delicious. I served it with garlic quinoa from this site.

This was killer! Oh my! The aroma while it was cooking was unbelievable and the flavor just wakes up all your taste buds!  We buy 1/2 sides of Black Angus raised on pasture with no hormones etc. It is very lean and must be cooked ‘low and slow’. This recipe was perfect for this beef. I made it while my husband was out-of-state to see if there was too much pepper for his tastes. (Translation: I get it all to myself - YUM!) I thought it was perfect as is but will probably will go a tad lighter on the pepper for my husband’s tummy’s sake the next time I make it. I have forwarded this recipe to Beam’N Boys - where we buy our beef - so they can share it with their customers. It really is that good. Thank again, Chef John!

This is fantastic! I made it as written. I definitely had to de-fat as my short ribs were pretty fatty. The sauce is just delicious!

This was a big hit over cheesy polenta.

It requires the full cooking time that Chef John specified and even though I used a dutch oven with a tight fitting lid I had to add some water to keep the liquid level high enough.  I crushed the pepper corns in a coffee grinder that I use for spices.

Made this last night for Friday night supper. Absolutely delicious - so flavourful. And even though it seemed like an obscene amount of pepper, it wasn’t!
I did have to adapt the recipe since I could only find strips of 1” short ribs for braising.  I just cut them into pieces and followed the rest of the recipe. The only difference was that the cooking time until fork tender was 3 h 15 minutes. And a lot more bones to pick out! I served it over Maple Chipotle mashed sweet potatoes and it was devine. Will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and it was very flavorful and moist! I served it over polenta made with fresh grated parmesan cheese, Hungarian paprika and black pepper. I will definitely make this again!

Did not have sage or tomato paste. I substituted some crushed tomatoes and had to add some beef broth after 2.5 hrs. Used Penzey’s Sunny Paris to season. Absolutely delicious and sauce was so yummy. I did take the time to trim the extra fat and pull off the membrane prior to cooking.

I made this in the pressure cooker on high for 30 mins natural release then strained the sauce and reduced on the stove top because the peppercorns still had a little too much bite for my toddler. I thought this deserved a 5 but the hubs wasn’t a fan so I knocked off a star. Perhaps the slow cooking reduces the peppers bite and wouldn’t need to be strained for the little one. She did however love it as well :) this was really easy to put together and was super tasty! For those who might want the bone in option but the meat looks thin just ask the butcher if they have any in the back. When I buy it I only buy the really thick ones. I served with polenta which was an excellent choice for the sauce.

This is, by far, the most flavorful and delectable beef dish I have ever made!!!  The pepper is balanced out so well by the wine and garlic.

Revised review - the next day after cooking the ribs they had mellowed and were very tasty.
Not our cup of tea - wasted $20 on expensive short ribs.
Made it exactly by the recipe, even watched the video.  I cook with wine alot, but never with chianti , didn't care for the taste.

This was yummmo.  I normally have tomato paste on hand. I did NOT for this recipe!! I had half a can of whole tomatoes that had to suffice. I massaged the heck out of those tomatoes and short ribs. I also did not have fresh herbs so I used dried. It took about 3 hours. I had 8 ribs but kept the pepper as the original recipe. It was great.  Served over mashed potatoes with a side of  fresh asparagus.  I had boneless ribs and I did not trim off the fat or silver skin and it was perfect.

I made it using stew meat, about the same amount that Chef John used for his, just no bones.  Took about the same amount of time because I followed the Golden Rule, "Don't stop cooking".  Too much pepper for my wife, but I loved it.  For a twist, I used cheesy mashed potatoes as a bed for it.  Came out amazing, definitely making again soon.

Please don't judge the dish to harshly based on my non-existent photography skills.
Definitely going to make this one again.
It was delicious, the meat just melted in your mouth.
I paired it with the recipe for couscous primavera and there was a nice spicy kick to accompany all the rich savory flavors from the beef.
Thanks Chef John!!

This is a really flavorful dish and one that is easily adaptable to a slow cooker.  I am not a big fan of short ribs, in general -- there is too little meat and too much fat --  but it was such an interesting recipe, I thought I'd give it a try.  The flavor was great and milder than one might expect.  All the pepper and garlic softened and melded with the wine and fresh herbs to produce a beautiful sauce.  The aroma of this dish, as it cooked, was out of this world!  The hardest part of this recipe was simply waiting for it to be ready.  Though my family and I really enjoyed it, I'm going with 4 stars, instead of 5, because of the excessive fattiness of this dish.  I had to discard  great chunks of  fat, along with the bones,  which left not much meat with which to feed four people.  That brings up the question of whether to choose bone-in or boneless short ribs.   I waffled and put in some of each.  I thought the bones would help flavor the cooking liquid, but the trade-off is the ribs were mostly fat and yielded very little cooked meat.  The boneless ribs are more expensive, but you can better judge yield amount and you'll have  better quality meat that presents in a much more appetizing way. Next time, I'll choose all boneless ribs.  Perhaps that choice alone will turn this into a full 5 star recipe.
