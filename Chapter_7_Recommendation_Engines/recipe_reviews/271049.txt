These. Are. PHENOMENAL! I’ve made them twice now. This second time, I made a triple batch to bring to an event. I used the croissant method of locking in a slab of butter rather than grating, because it seemed easier to me. I made the dough and shaped the pastries the night before, then let them proof overnight in their muffin cups, topped with greased plastic wrap, in the fridge. I baked them the next morning, just letting them rest at room temp while the oven preheated, and it worked perfectly. For the big batch, I had to use every muffin tin I had in the house, which included a silicone pan and individual silicon muffin cups: they all baked fine. (Don’t forget to put the trays on baking sheets to catch any butter drips.) I could eat these pastries every weekend. They taste best at room temperature, if you can wait that long. Oh, and be sure to bake them until they’re a deep golden brown so that they’re fully baked through in the centers and the sugar has a chance to caramelize.

I followed the instructions to a "T", with one minor exception - I used salted butter vs unsalted butter because that's all I had in the house.  I thought the results were perfection, but my wife thought they were just a tad too salty, although she ate them with relish.  So, next time I will make them with unsalted butter to keep harmony in the marriage.  But really - these are FANTASTIC!  They weren't as hard to make as I had thought.  Using the cheese grater to grate the frozen butter is pure genius - way easier than beating cold butter and rolling it out.   I will henceforth make these whenever I really want to impress someone - they are beautiful and delicious.    PS - I baked at 350 convection - took 29 minutes.

These are absolutely amazing. The only change I make is when I make the dough, i put it in the fridge to rise overnight and finish the next day.

The recipe is simple to follow but definitely time consuming since there is a lot of downtime while you waitFor the dough to chill. I’m always willing to try a recipe once before I decide if it is worth it and my conclusion is that it is definitely worth it! My family thoroughly enjoyed these treats and wouldn’t let me give them away

This recipe was a hit with everyone! I stopped part way through at the step before adding the sugar/salt to the dough and left this in the fridge overnight. It worked out great since I had a fresh batch with breakfast the next day.

Way too salty. I used unsalted butter and less than the amount of salt called for and they were too salty to eat. The method was great though and the texture of the finished pastry was perfection.

I used this recipe because it is recommended in the comments on other recipe site's versiin of this. I am glad I did! It is easy to follow , thorough, and very clear. Labour-intensive, but easy. I refrigerated overnight for the final refrigeration. The dough was very easy to work and roll the next morning. Christmas breakfast was a hit with everyone!

By far easiest method, grating the butter in.  I actually found them needing more salt and sugar (next time I will use Kosher & not fine seasalt).  I used Kerry Gold butter (higher fat, lower water).  They also took MUCH longer to bake than stated - used a light aluminum coloured muffin tin, but better long and unburnt.  The layers turned out beautifully well, next time will layer the sugar/salt mix between the last fold and turn steps. Tried other methods and recipes, this is by far the friendliest.

These came out *perfect.*  My one note would be to make sure you de-pan them quickly, before the caramelized sugar hardens!  I made a double batch and pulled them all out at the same time, lesson learned!  This was surprisingly easy though.  I used a food processor to grate frozen butter, and only used a little more than half of the salt for the sugar mixture.  This one's going in the recipe book!

Easy to make but very time consuming. I watched his youtube channel on how to make them exactly and I can tell you they taste amazing! They didn't turn out as dark but they are crisp on the outside and soft inside. Very fluffy. So good!

Just perfect. This is a time-consuming recipe, so it's best to make these pastries on a day that you don't have to be anywhere. When beginning, I put two sticks of butter into the freezer to make grating easier. I followed this recipe exactly as written. While baking, these pastries smelled delicious. After baking, they have a crunchy and tender, buttery flavor. I think these would go well with breakfast (if you wake up early enough to make them). This is one of those recipes that tastes like home.

These are amazing and a pretty good second to the ones from my favourite bakery, I did use salted butter cause that's what I had, so I didn't add the teaspoon of salt to the initial dough. Pretty sure it'd be way too salty with it as well.

I have made these twice. Wonderful. I'm tweaking these but the recipe is spot on. I've eaten these little babies at a bakery but for $5 they're spendy puppies. These took 4 hours and made 12. Chef John I LOVE you but my waistline doesn't.

Time consuming but worth it. Was a little salty for my taste but everyone else loved it. Maybe I’ll swap out sea salt for kosher salt next time or just reduce the amount a bit. Won’t be the last time I make these.

Wow, just wow! I made these on Sunday evening as part of my 52-week baking challenge and am so impressed! They came out all buttery and flaky and delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly. (I just waited to make the season salt until right before putting the pastries in the muffin tin.) Some of them flattened out on top, but I’m guessing that was due to the size of the slices. I can’t wait to have one with a cup of coffee at breakfast!

It is not so difficult to make, if  you already have done croissant in your life. But, it turns out, it was too salty. I would recommend to use just one teaspoon of salt .

I made these following this recipe exactly and here is what I would do differently next time:
1. Grating butter was too hard because not only did I lack the strength to grate two buttersticks, but because the portion I was holding kept melting from my body heat. Like another comment, I will try the "normal" sheet butter way used for croissants.
2. I would only use half the salt for the sprinkling sugar/salt mixture. It came out way too salty, I need to down a cup of water after eating one of these.

Also, I needed about an extra cup of flour as my initial dough was way too sticky. I got tired of adding little by little, that I ended up dumping a good amount at the end. Now I think I may have added a little too much since these kouign amanns are a bit tough and not as airy, not even a day after they have been made.

All in all, this was a fun pastry to make and I will probably try making them again in the future.
