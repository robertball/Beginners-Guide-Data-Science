This was excellent!  The only changes I made was I didn't have marinated veggies so I used the advice of another and used some canned artichoke and I didn't use cherry tomatoes, but thickly sliced zucchini.  My girls are 4 and 7 and they ate this up.  Husband claimed to be 'not feeling well' but ended up having seconds.  it was more stew-like that I thought it would be, but that didn't change the great flavor.

I doubled the recipe and used a combination of fish and scallops, substituted marinated artichoke hearts instead of the marinated italian vegetables (I don't like that stuff), and served this over rice for a dinner party.  It got RAVE reviews from everyone and several people wanted the recipe!  These flavors are AWESOME together and really make this a standout recipe!  Thanks for the submission- this is some good food!  Plus, it's healthy, too!!!  What a great bonus!

Very good; very flavorful.  I will try shrimp or scallops next time.  I cut the cod into little chunks, then served over rice, with foccacia bread -- a nice meal on this Friday night.  I could not find the marinated vegetables called for, so I used an equal amount of marinated artichoke hearts.  Thanks!

This fish had so much flavor. Everyone loved it. I was told I had to make this one often, and to try the sauce with chicken as well. It was alittle salty so definately don't add salt.

Delicioso!  Husband's comment:  "Make sure you tell them I said it was good."  Did my "prep" work in the morning, and when I got home from work, this was done in the time it took to boil the angel hair pasta I served with it.  This one's a keeper.

This was outstanding! Made me wonder why I had never eaten fish in a tomato sauce before. I used green olives, sundried tomatoes and marinated zucchini for the sauce and I firmly believe that even without the fish or any other addition it would make a wonderful pasta sauce. Served this one with rice. Loved it! Will serve it to company. Thank you.

After visiting Spain last fall, and often coming across cod served with tomatoes, I wanted to find a dish that incorporated tomatoes with the fish. This recipe is excellent. I do tweak it a bit, though. I add more Spanish herbs like thyme, basil, tarragon, rosemary.  I eliminate the Italian deli veggies and add artichokes, not necessarily marinated.  I add enough lemon so that I can taste it in the tomato liquid and that makes for a wonderful broth. And, I use only one type of pepper spice, not two.  We usually eat it over either brown or white basmati rice.  I have not served it at a group dinner, but only with family.  That is my next step! Thank you Lundegaard1 for this wonderful, nutritious recipe.

Pretty much followed the recipe as written but decreased the tomato sauce. Loved the combination of flavors with the addition of the chopped marinated Italian deli salad and olives.

this was very good.  i was looking for something different to do with the cod i bought other than frying it or baking it. the only substitute i had to do was the veggies.  i didn't have marinated veggies, i used some fresh zucchini from the garden. thanks so much for the post Lundegaard1!

This was just great! We had it with garlic mashed potatoes which went very well with the sauce.  My husband who doesn’t like olives (at all) liked the flavor very much.  The olives are not overpowering but add a bit of a salty taste. I can’t wait to try this sauce on chicken and even other types of fish.

This was recipe was amazing!  I think it would work well with most fleshy fish.  I didn't have tomato sauce, so used a can of diced tomatoes which worked out such fine. I also used diced whole tomatoes since I didn't have cherry tomatoes.  This will be another staple in my recipe box.

Perfect and easy - instead of picked veggies I chopped up some peppers and put them in with the unions. Also doubled up on the garlic

Fantastic recipe!  The second time I made it I forgot to add the halved tomatoes and it was still delicious.  Will definitely make this for company as it is so easy to do at the last minute.  I serve it over rice and with crusty bread and a salad.

I followed the recipe's advice and add a handful of shrimp.  The only changes I made was to add a little chicken stock to make more gravy for the rice and I used talapia instead of cod.  Using the cayenne and "hot" paprika will make a spicy kick, but not overpower the sauce.  Will make again, very yummy  My husband, 13 year old son and 2 year old daughter devoured it.

instead of tomato sauce, I used a can of chopped tomatoes, seasoned w/hot paprika...it was good to use some of my pickled vegetables up, and it added a nice bite. This was as good or better than anything you could get in a restaurant, and really easy...I'll be making this again, thanks!!!

Excellent, what a great dish, so much flavor. Only added more garlic (personal preference) and used artichokes in placement of italian veggies as suggested. Will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe.

Excellent, always rave reviews from guests, even those saying they don't care much for cod. Changed very few... I add about six ounces of chopped marinated artichokes to my marinated chopped Italian vegetables and sliced green olives. I serve with an artichoke salad.  It's easy and fun!

I don't include cherry tomatoes, but tiny Yukon gold potatoes that I drizzle with olive oil, sea salt, and Spanish paprika.  I microwave them for about 3 minutes and set aside (they don't need to be fully cooked at this stage. I then add them to the skillet ingredients once the diced tomatoes are added.; Secondly, I don't use tomato sauce, but diced Roma tomatoes. Third, Instead of the marinated veggies, I add about 1/2 cup of fresh tomato, onion, and jalapeño salsa, which is something of a staple in my house. Fourth, in addition to olives, I add 1 T of capers.  Finally, I add some cumin (about 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp.) because my family particularly likes that spice and a splash of sherry.  The heat factor can be easily modulated with the addition of more or less cayenne pepper and cumin.  With the addition of the potatoes, all you need is some crusty bread to sop up the rich sauce and a salad.

I used gardeniera salad and grape tomatoes instead.  Came out great.  I also added very hot pepper flakes that a friend of mine sent me from his garden.  A great side dish for this  is broccoli rabe sauteed in olive oil and sliced garlic.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Wait for the main mix to boil first and then add the fish ASAP.  Everything else doesn't need to be cooked just heated so adding the fish in right after the main mix boils will cook everything just right.  Broccoli rabe needs to be boiled first for 5 minutes in water then sauteed for 15 minutes in the olive oil and garlic.  So make sure you start that first.

Great Flavors!!  The only alteration I made was adding Frontera Roasted Tomato Salsa instead of the tomato sauce and a pinch extra of cayenne pepper.  I enjoyed the flavor of the "Italian marinated salad", which is also found under the auspicious name of "Antipasto".  Once I found that in the deli section of my grocery store I was good to go!  The vinegar flavor of the Antipasto made a nice addition enhancing all the different flavors.

I love cod, and I love the flavors in this recipe.  I didn't have the marinated vegetable salad, either, so I just chopped up a little yellow bell pepper and threw it in along with a dash of olive oil and a little balsamic vinegar.  You can also make do with some canned tomatoes, no problem.  Delicious!

I liked the sauce, but felt it would be better with chicken rather than fish, which defeats the whole purpose of making this dish.

Quick, easy and tasty!  I didn't have the Italian deli salad so just improvised with other veggies and added a bit of the green oil juice...yum!

Yum Yum Yum!  Very happy tummies!  I made two adjustments:  Used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and used a large chopped yellow squash for the Italian veggies.  Everybody loved it!  Served with Spanish rice.  We are adding this to our favorite dishes.  Thank you, thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome. I used canned artichoke hearts instead. I also replaced the cod fillets with small pieces of desalted cod, which made is a very stasty fish stew. Lovely.

Be sure everyone likes green olives first! Had great flavor, but definetly the green olives over-shadowed the dish.

My husband and I LOVED this! Instead of the deli marinated salad I added sauteed zucchini and capers w/ a little splash of caper juice. I also added a little red wine thanks to another reviewer. Oh, and I added a little honey to cut down the tomato flavor a tad as my hubby isn't a fan of heavy tomato sauce. My fish turned out super moist and the sauce was the best I've made in a while.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  It's a great way to add some zest to a very plain fish.  I substituted Spanish smoked hot paprika for the regular paprika and cayenne which gave it a very authentic flavor.  I also used cured olives instead of green olives and followed the other reviewer's suggestion of using marinated artichoke hearts instead of pickled vegetables.  Great idea!

Really really good, and easy.  I did add the artichokes like others recommended.  It still seemed like it was missing something, so I added a glug of balsamic vinegar and 2 glugs of red wine.  That helped round out the flavor in my opinion.  I think adding some kalamata olives or capers and mushrooms would be great too.  We took the leftovers the next day, and added some additional tomato sauce and some fresh mussles...so good!

Very nice recipe. Made it as per the directions. Had trouble finding "deli Italian vegetables" but used "antipasto" that was in the pre-packaged deli section at my local grocery store.
I cubed two cod filets and added about a dozen x-large shrimp, split lengthwise in two.
I served it over rice with a slice of italian bread,  buttered with garlic.
The next time I make it I expect to add more veggies, probably some celery, and green onions as a garnish. I will also add some parsley or basil.
I also would like to add just a bit of sugar and/or adding carrot "matchsticks" to cut the acidity a little bit.
A very nice dish.

Giving this recipe 5 stars is a insult -t is incredible! Make it w COD Chicken -Vegetarian whatever!
I bought ingredients at the grocery store olive bar-marinated green olives and than more than rrecipe asked marinated mushrooms, artichokes and red peppers.
I didn't use cherry tomatoes--I used chopped tomatoes vs tomato sauce & double amount. Extra garlic.
Other comments said they used rice, so I maid brown rice. Before dinner was done I thought I would regret it & should have made pasta---no way---rice  ABSORBED incredible sauce.
Love this sauce!!! Cod.....doesn't matter...sauce to good!

I actually made this recipe twice.  The first time I did as directed, using Giardiniera for the marinated vegetables.  Served with brown Basmati saffron rice and the wife said "it's a keeper, don't loose the recipe".  Yesterday I decided to give it another go, but making some additions.  After sautéing the onions and garlic (I used a whole red onion) I added 2 cups of sliced mushrooms and let them cook til they started releasing their juices.  When adding the tomato sauce (15oz can) and sliced cherry tomatoes, I added a cup of good Madeira wine and let that simmer til reduced a little bit, maybe 25%.  After the olives were added and cod (cut into chunks rather than as filets) was just about done, I added some canned peas and let them warm through.  Served this time with roasted fingerling potatoes.  
Believe me, this was even better than the first one!
Give it a try either way...you'll love this dish.

I had to change up the ingredients to what I had on hand. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and a can of Rotel. I threw in a bag of frozen mixed vegetables with a couple tablespoons of balsamic and red wine vinegar and let that simmer before I placed the cod in the pan.  I usually season my ingredients as I go along, but the cod was still a bit too bland.  The sauce on the other hand was delicious!  I served the cod and sauce over some long grain rice to my husband. He liked the idea of this dish, but wanted more seasoning on the fish.  I later ate the just the sauce and vegetables over the rice and loved it!  I'll make this again, but need to find a way to really season the cod.

I made this in the spur of the moment after searching for some cod recipes. I didn't have tomato sauce on hand so substituted with some marinara sauce. Also didn't have olives or Italian veggies so substituted with more onion, green bell pepper, and pickled jalapeños. In addition to spices listed, I added Cajun seasoning. I realize I changed a lot, but I used this as a base recipe and dinner turned out great. Served with rice.

It's a fair presentation of bacalao a la vizcaína. The proper one does not have the veggies, and instead of olives it uses capers for that tang. We also add raisins to reduce the acidity of the tomato. You may try those substitutions if you wish, but this is very good as is. The artichokes addition is actually good, they are tastier :)

BEST FISH EVER!!!This is so good and so very easy.  After reading all the reviews, I was able to assemble all ingredients and substitutions. The cod needed to be used. Now I cant wait to buy more!! My family demanded that this go into our rotation. What could be better than a healthy meal everyone eats. Leftovers? None here - plates were wiped clean with bread. Here are my changes - most due to pantry contents:
Used 1 zucchini sliced and sauteed with the onion. Used a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes - what i had. Added 2 Tbsp tomato paste to thicken sauce. Chopped 2 Tbsp capers, 2 Tbsp salad peppers, 2 Tbsp kalamata pitted olives for Italian veg salad. Served over couscous and a small salad. Thanks again for such a GREAT recipe which offers so many variations to taste and pantry content.

I made this over the weekend. We eat quite a bit of cod and I love Spanish flavors. I used the mixed vegetables from the grocery store olive/salad bar. This has marinated artichokes, garlic, sun dried tomatoes and black pitted olives. I chopped those removing the harder bits of the artichokes. I increased that to about 1/2 cup. I drained and chopped 2 Tablespoons of capers and added sliced lemon stuffed green olives,(they were what I had on hand). Overall it was a little over a Cup of veggies. I also used sweet onion and increased it to 1/2 Cup. 
I didn't have any Cayenne pepper so I used Chipotle pepper instead. My husband who claimed to not be hungry ate 2 helpings. The next day I had about a half pound of sea scallops, lightly browned those, and added them to the leftover fish and sauce. Fantastic.

I just made this recipe using canned artichokes instead of the deli mix and canned diced tomatoes (basil, garlic, onion) . I really like it. I am just getting over the flu and my buds are not at their best but this is very good and easy. UPDATE: WOW!!!! I just made this again using marinaded artichoke hearts and shrimp and it is amazing!!!!! I accidentally bought no salt diced tomatoes. Added some of the marinade from the artichokes and it tastes better than the last time I made it. I'm glad I doubled it for tomorrow. (If it lasts) I love this recipe.

Major hit with my fried fish only loving family.  It was easy, healthy, and in all a keeper.  As with others, I subbed marinated artichokes that I rough chopped for the Italian veg salad, which I couldn't find at local stores.  That was my only change from the recipe.

Ok, I was really skeptical because I am not a fan of fish done with tomatoes or even green olives, but the husband likes both and I needed a new way to cook fish. WOW!!! I can't believe how much we ate it was SO GOOD!  The only changes I made were to add mushrooms (I pretty much put mushrooms in everything) and I did add shrimp and I used canned tomatoes as I didn't have any cherry tomatoes, otherwise made it as written and it's fantastic!  We ate it over pearl couscous and while I thought I made enough for at least 2 full dinners for the 2 of us, there is hardly enough left for one lunch. FANTASTIC blend of flavors and much milder than I would have thought for all the green olives and pickled asparagus I put in.

I could not find the deli marinated Italian vegetable salad which may have made it even better.

This is a favorite for ourselves and to serve to company.  I haven't needed any modifications but sometimes substitute different olives if that is what's on hand.

This is a great dish! My husband, who doesn't typically like fish, loved this dish. I substituted cubed/steamed carrots and parsnips for the pickled Italian vegetables. I also added a half a small can of tomato paste and about 1/3 cup water to give the sauce more depth. I will definitely make this again.

AMAZING!  I threw in some little shrimp and added a small can of diced chiles because I didn't have the vegetable salad or green olives on  hand.  Also added a dash of hot red pepper, only on my portion, which was delish.  Made it more of a spicy Spanish cod, but it was excellent.

I am rating this recipe a 5 based on the sauce alone! I omitted the veggies, as I was looking for more of a plain sauce for fish, and it was amazing!! I used a 1/3rd of the fish since it is just my husband and I, but I cooked all of the sauce since we were having it over angel hair pasta. Unfortunately the Cod we used was VERY fishy, so I did not like the end result, but I am definitely going to try it again maybe using halibut or tilapia filets, or even chicken cutlets. The sauce could also just be tripled alone for a homemade spicy marinara sauce.

This recipe was very good and very easy to make. I used red and green bell peppers as a substitue for the veggies and served over yellow rice.  For a quick meal, everyone enjoyed it, I will make it again.

my boyfriend said "its like we have our own ivars in our kitchen" I am thinking he ment the nice fancy Ivars, not the fast food joint. I had to change it a little due to lack of ingredience... I used stewed tomatoes and omited the greek olives and spices.   only think I would really change is the name... Mediteraian Cod not spanish cod. and I made brown rice as a side to sop up the left over sauce.

This came out really good and I am not used to cooking fish.  I used marinated artichokes and sliced tomatoes but right before I served the dish I tossed in some whole wheat three cheese tortellini.  I also garnished with chopped green onions and parsley.  I also squeezed lime onto the pieces of cod.  Ok, I am done with my alterations to the recipe but seriously, it was amazing!

I thought this was okay, but then I substituted whiting fish for cod...maybe that's what made "only okay."  I did substitute the artichokes for the marinated Italian veggies.  I thought the artichokes gave the dish a slightly unusual flavor.  Not a bad flavor...just one that I'm not used to tasting.  I did use a diced regular tomato instead of the cherry tomatoes.

This is an excellent recipe made with chicken as well.  The other changes I made were using artichoke hearts as other reviewers suggested and some diced canned tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes.  This is a keeper.

This recipe is a keeper. It was delicious I followed the recipe as directed. I used jar giardiniera vegetables assuming it’s the same as Italian deli veggies. Did add some white wine to thin out the sauce as it started to get to thick . Served it over spinach  and wild grains with a sprinkle of parsley for presentation .

I don’t even know what deli marinated veggie salad is so took the advice of others and substituted with artichokes.  Very impressed with the results. Have lots of codfish in the freezer and constantly looking for ways to eat it in at least a somewhat healthy manner (i.e. avoid pan fried, fish and chips, and cod au gratin which although very tasty just don’t cut it). I was afraid it might turn out a bit bland and taste too much of tomato sauce but the other ingredients quickly blended into the sauce given the relatively short cooking time for the fish. Served with Spanish rice and sopped up the sauce with a few slices of multigrain baguette. Definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe, but added thyme, basil, rosemary, and sugar to add a little more balance. I didn't have Italian vegetables nor artichoke hearts, so I improvised with green bell peppers,  mushrooms, zucchini, and corn. Oh, and I made Mexican rice as the side!

This dish was so flavorful!  We added crushed tomatoes and adjusted the seasonings for that because we wanted more sauce. As a result we simmered a little longer than recommended. In fact, we think the sauce is perfect for pasta, using any kind of meat or no meat at all.  Try it! You’ll love it!

This recipe was delicious!  My husband said this was a restaurant quality meal! I made it exactly as stated.  I had all the ingredients on hand and I added shrimp at the end.  The sauce was thick, and once you add the fish, it thins out.  Served with some crusty bread on the side.  I will definitely make it again!

Love it!  The only change I made was to omit the green olives and marinated veggies and substitute with zucchini and it was delicious!  I made it again a few days later with shrimp instead of cod and it was an even bigger hit!  Thank you for a great easy and versatile recipe!!!

This dish turned out really delicious with these few modifications: I lightly salted both sides of the filets before placing them into the sauce to simmer (since the recipe didn't call for any seasoning along the way). I also added a 1/2 tsp of sugar into the simmering sauce before adding the fish to mellow out the tartness from the tomato sauce. Next time, I will use stewed tomatoes instead of the cherry tomatoes since the cherry tomatoes took a long time to cook down. Overall really quick and easy recipe.

This was one of the better cod recipes I've tried.  I wanted a explosion of awesome flavor, but it wasn't like that.  Even with the amount of garlic and olives/artichokes it still lacked that umami for me.  I think it's the cod!  That's how cod always will be for me!  Like another reviewer said, probably taste great with chicken.  
I used 5 fillets (the bag said 5 oz each).  Glad I did that, that way there was enough sauce.      Very easy!  Ate with brown rice.

Since haddock was on sale for $5.99 vs $12.99/lb for cod, I went with haddock & I've had something like this only in restaurants.  It had so much flavor and the 5 other people I served were equally pleased.  The 2nd time I added too much shrimp (1 pound) which led to a crowded pan and I felt it overwhelmed the fish but I'll definitely try adding small amts of seafood (scallops, shrimp, squid) in the future but will also be making the original recipe too.  It's easy and really impressive and, just my opinion, you can go with or without the marinated Italian vegetable salad, it's equally good both ways.

This is amazing! I subbed artichoke hearts and Nopalitos cactus for the Italian marinated veggies and made it with some Spanish rice.

As with everything I cook, I cook to taste and don't really measure and added a few things. After sautéing  the onions and garlic I added canned diced tomatoes  with the tomato sauce and cherry tomatoes. I did not have any green olives but I did have the pickled Italian vegetables, which lends a sour balance and gives the dish another dimension.

I also added marlin that I cut into chunks, which adds another flavor and texture, as the marlin chunks are firmer than the Cod. I also added shrimp which gave the dish a sweet/salty flavor. In all this dish was very good and is reminiscent of fish stew.

This was delicious. Lots of flavor. I used artichoke bruschetta in place of the marinated vegetables. I served it with rice and green beans. It was easy and quick. I will definitely make it again.

This was amazing!! I did like suggested and added 1lb shrimp since I only had two cod filets...kept everything else the same with the exception of adding a couple splashes of lemon juice. I did use the Italian vegetables because quite frankly I could eat them out of the jar! So yummy! May double the sauce next time because after serving it over rice there wasn't a ton left after cooking.  It's going into my favorites!

Loved this dish.  Minor changes based on what was in the 'fridge.  I added green bell pepper equal to the onion, teaspoon of fresh chopped basil and a splash of red wine.  Really reminded me of the same dish I had in Barcelona!

Delicious and flavorful! I made it without the marinated vegetables.. Sauteed some kale and dropped that in instead....I had also seasoned my cod with salt and pepper a few hours before and I chunked it up to ensure the sauce permeated the fish. Thumbs up!

Delicious!  I didn't have several of the ingredients (onions, olives, Italian Marinated salad) but even without those, the base itself was wonderful.  Easy to make, and my husband loved it too, it has a nice flavor and a little kick to it.  It's a keeper, I'll definitely make this again!

I used black cod and it was flaky and delicious. The tomato that I have used are overly sweet and my dish came out a bit sweet otherwise I would of given this dish five stars. I substitute marinated veg with artichoke hearts. What a simple and easy recipe to follow.

I have not had fish in tomato sauce for a long time, so this was a treat.
I did make a couple slight adjustments.
I used left over pizza sauce as the tomato sauce, and I did have to add a splash of water, because it was very thick in the skillet.
Also, I only used 1/4 cup olives instead of 1/2 cup, because I was afraid the dish would be too salty if I added all of them.  (Turns out that it would probably be fine will the whole 1/2 cup).
I served over couscous.
Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! It had just the right amount of spice and saltiness...I almost always put salt on my food, and this was just right! I added some shrimp like the recipe said and it made it just the right amount of food to serve over rice. You rarely come across something healthy and good. I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was fair. I felt it was to bland,and have had better. I will probably not make this again.
