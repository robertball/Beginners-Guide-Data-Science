I was a little disappointed based on the other reviews here.  I thought this was way too salty, and the citrus from the limes was overpowering.  If I make it again, I'd likely cut the salt and citrus in half.  Also, I'm not sure the 1/4 cup of oil was worth the added calories.  I may cut that by 1/2 as well.

Wow!  This was outstanding!  I only used one tsp. of cumin, but followed the rest faithfully.  I also served it warm because I tried it on a fall evening.  Can't wait to taste it cold.  Very very tasty!!

Note:  My review above was several years ago.  I have made this salad over and over these last few years and we absolutely LOVE it!  Hot and cold.  So does everyone we share it with. SO delicious!

Here are the changes i recommend:

I first toasted the quinoa for about 10 minutes with a little olive oil.  I also upped the quinoa to 1.25 cups (but same 2 cups water).
I only used one lime. 
I added about a cup of fresh white corn (2 ears).
I topped the dish with diced avocado.  

Perfect!!

This is a great recipe for summer parties.  I'm sorry I followed some of the suggestions.  I had no problem with the amount of lime juice, oil,  or salt, but then I doubled the recipe, used a can of black beans and a can of garbanzo beans, used fresh tomatoes vs. canned, and added cucumbers, fresh minced garlic, and a little honey.  I would caution folks to cook the quinoa al dente lest the salad becomes mushy.

This recipe was quick and easy and AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!  I made a couple changes to suit my taste...  I cooked the Quinoa in vegetable broth, I used only 1/2 tsp salt and closer to 2 tsp of crushed red peppers. Then I added diced avocado.  This will become a regular dish in my house for sure!

Outstanding combination of flavors. I haven't been a Quinoa fan until this salad. I concluded I prefer Quinoa cooked a little on the al-dente side so I cooked it for 10 minutes and then strained (to remove the excess liquid) and cooled it in a mesh colander. Used a combination of red and white Quinoa, sundried tomatoes to taste instead of fresh and reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Perfect! Delicious fresh made and delicious after it's been chilled. This salad is "company" worthy and one I know I'll be enjoying often on its own or as a side when grilling. Thanks scrumdiddly for sharing.

Loved everything about this dish. The lime juice, red pepper flakes, and cumin make an otherwise simple dish taste zesty and complex.

Instead of canned black beans, I cooked my own (VERY low sodium this way) along with garbanzo beans (chickpeas) and edamame. I used 3/4 cup each black and garbanzo beans and 1/2 cup edamame.

Brought this to a Memorial Day celebration where no one had tried quinoa before.  Everyone loved this salad!  It's easy, refreshing and versatile.  I followed the recipe with minor adjustments after reading the reviews:  Used 1 and 1/2 cup quinoa, 3 cups water, 1 and 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp salt.  Used about 1/3 cup red onion instead of green onion.  I loved and will make again.  Can't wait to try it with fresh corn or cucumbers, diced red/yellow peppers or sundried tomato.  Thanks!

I love this recipe. It is one of my go-to's. best part is it's great served cold and I can keep it in the fridge for a few days for lunches. I've made this a few times and have tweaked it a little. First. I toast the quinoa before letting it cook (just a drizzle of olive oil in the bottom of the pan and stir in quinoa for a few minutes). I then cook the quinoa with a little bit of vegetable stock in the water. I halve the amount of olive oil and lime juice out of personal preference. The veggies in the recipe are great but I like adding pretty much whatever I have around that I need to use soon. Bell peppers, mushrooms, red onions, celery, avocado, etc.

The recipe is great. But I am wondering why none of the recipes calling for quinoa ever note that you must rinse it thoroughly before cooking unless the package states that it is pre-rinsed? Unrinsed quinoa has a decided bitter taste that is very unpleasant.

This is insanely delicious. Like so delicious that I could eat the entire bowl myself (and I wouldn't feel guilty about it because it's QUINOA). I substituted the red pepper flakes for a dash of chili powder so it would have a fighting chance of being eaten by my picky, spicy food hating 5-year-old. I did everything else by the recipe and served it at about room temperature. SO GOOD.

I had some plain cooked Quinoa that was really not worth eating, so I searched allrecipes.com for the highest rated recipe using cooked quinoa and wound up trying this salad.  

I made the following changes: instead of fresh tomatoes, I used canned chopped tomatoes, used 1 tsp. dried cilantro, chopped white onion, and ground red pepper.  Because I used canned tomatoes, I reduced the salt to about half.  In addition, I added some sugar to give it a sweet flavor and refrigerated.  I could not stop eating this salad!  It is AMAZING!!!

I love this recipe and everyone who has tasted it said it's amazing too. I've used both green and regular onions (when I'm out) and even used canned petite diced tomatoes in a pinch. Still turns out nicely. Oh, and one time I didn't have lemons and used limes instead - still yummy although it needed more pepper. A great recipe that you can play with based on what you have in the house. And it's even yummier the next day - perfect for lunch!

We loved this and I highly recommend it. Personally I thought the lime was a tad bit overpowering and I would have given this a 4 star rating due to it but my hubby thought it was just right so maybe you should start with half and then add more if you want. The cumin was pretty stout too but it is one of my favorite spices. Again maybe start with half and add to suit your taste. Quinoa is fairly new to me but something tells me that I found a winner in this choice and this is one I will make often.

I am a mother of four and an avid runner. Eating healthy is high on our priority list. This recipe is great. I substituted steamed edamame for black beans, added a little extra lime and honey to vinaigrette and the family loved it. I can't wait to serve it again!

I give it 4 stars as-is, but with my modifications, it gets 5! I am a fan of spice, so I added a TBLS of crushed red pepper flakes, only used 1.5 tsp of cumin, 1 large lime, and half a teaspoon of salt (a teaspoon was just an insane amount of sodium). I also boiled my quinoa in vegetable broth for added flavor. I served cold; I prefer dishes like this that way. I did taste it warm though and it still had great flavor!

I loved this salad. After reading reviews, I only used 1 lime and it was perfect. I used both teaspoons of cumin because I like it, if you don't only use one. I doubled the cilantro and will reduce the oil next time but not to half. I like it warm and cold. Will make again.

LOVED this recipe, my wife was so impressed I made it. It really isn't that hard. I did switch up a few things, I only added 1 lime and it was limey enough, and I added 1/2 red and 1/2 yellow diced peppers. I heated the veggies with the sauce in a pan for a few minutes and served hot. Really great taste. Thanks.

Great protein filled dish! I've used lentils in place of black beans and that works just as well. I don't care for cumin so I leave that out, but that is just personal preference. This is a go to summer recipe when the tomatoes and cilantro can be picked fresh from the garden!

I made this for a lunch and it was well liked.  I found two limes to be too sharp, so cut the lime taste with 1 tsp honey which worked well. I only used three-quarters of the dressing because I don't like quinoa salad to be too wet and it was still very flavourful. I love cumin and spicy food but next time would reduce cumin to 1.5 tsp as 2 was a bit overpowering. Half a tsp salt was plenty. I tossed in one red and one orange pepper slivered, half a cup of thawed corn and half a cup of crumbled goat's feta, then served it with sliced avocado in a pinwheel on top and got lots of compliments for taste and presentation. It was served as a side dish to a frittata and there was lots left over with five women having it for lunch. The pepper flakes give it a nice after-kick without seeming overly spicy.

Very good. I cut the olive oil to about 75%, used one 1 teaspoon cumin, and less salt. Great flavor and texture. This is the first time I've really enjoyed a quinoa dish. I'm always looking for new ways to get vegetarian protein. So very glad I found this quick and easy recipe.

I had this at a family reunion in August and I could have eaten myself SICK ON IT.  I DID follow some of the other cooks suggestions.  I DOUBLED the recipe so I had to adjust a couple things.  I cut back and used 1/3 cu olive oil in total, 3 t. ground cumin and only 3 limes.  Everything else was double per the recipe amounts.  If it's SUPER GOOD right away I know it will be DELISH tomorrow.  I also plan on trying another cooks suggestion of gently browning the Quinoa in butter/garlic before putting it in the rice cooker next time.  OHHH DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN PRODUCE PERFECT QUINOA BY COOKING IT IN YOUR RICE COOKER???  1 cu. Quinoa with 2 cu. water.  I have an inexpensive rice cooker (no temp controls.. just load and push the on button). PERFECT QUINOA with out having to babysit it! It's just the BEST!!  I also may add some toasted pine nuts just for fun!

This recipe was really good!  I've had quinoa before but never made it so I thought this recipe was a good start.  I feel the flavors mix together beautifully but only after you let it sit for an hour or so before serving.  Gives time for the lime juice and other spices to soak into the quinoa.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe is so flavorful! We absolutely loved it! I did cut down on the salt and oil, just personal preference, but otherwise kept it the same. This will be a regular dish at our home. Thanks, scrumdiddly for sharing an interesting recipe!

I was shocked that I didn't screw this up and that it tasted so great!  I will use a bit less salt next time, but otherwise I won't change anything.  I will be making this again and again!

This dish had a very nice flavor but was a tad too oily - would agree with the previous reviewer who suggested halving the olive oil.  Since I served this dish during colder weather, my kids said they would have preferred it warm, so next time I may substitute canned, diced tomatoes for the grape tomatoes and serve it warm.

I made this for a ladies' lunch, so I followed the recipe exactly (if I'd been making it for my family, I'd have bumped the cilantro and red pepper a bit). I cooked the quinoa in chicken boullion, and thus did not need any additional salt at the end. I think it did benefit from sitting overnight in the fridge, and it was very well received by the group. As for me, I have found another staple salad to keep in the fridge for fast summer meals. Oh, and I think the serving size may be a bit off; if you only get six servings out of this, they must be very generous servings. I'd estimate at least 8 or 10 servings, even for an entree, served in a pita or over lettuce. It's a really, really tasty, fresh Mexican-ish take on quinoa. It'd be perfect for Cinco de Mayo, cause it can be hard to find Mexican dishes that are lighter and not slathered in cheese. I'll be making this often. Thanks!! UPDATE 8/12/15 I just made this again and didn't hold out much hope it would be as good as before, since I didn't have fresh cilantro or green onions. I used finely diced sweet white onion and a hefty shake (about 1.5 T) of dried cilantro flakes, and it came out amazing, again. It's an "OMG-that's so good" recipe for our household. Thanks again.

It was absolutely delicious! I wouldn't change a thing. I didn't need to add additional salt. The serving size is perfect for the week of you're always on the go, like me. This will be made again!!

Lovely dish.. I like it heated up a bit I used lemon instead of lime because that is all I had on hand and skipped the olive oil for lower calories. Next time I will add avocado as well.. very tasty nutritious dish.

I love this recipe. I add a can (14oz) of artichoke hearts, a small can (4 oz) of fire roasted diced green chiles, and a can (14 oz) of corn.  I used two teaspoons of cumin and add half teaspoon of smoked paprika.  Yum!

I really messed up this recipe.  Accidentally used Kasha instead of Quinoa, didn't have limes so used lemons, no green onions so used yellow, left out cilantro...turned out great.  Nice combination of flavors.  Can't mess up!

I found this to be very unpleasant to my palate.  Way too salty and the lime was over powering.  You may want to double rinse the black beans.

My husband usually expects good meals, so when he gets something that is good, he doesn't say much. But when he gets something that is GREAT ... well, today his first words were "Mmmmm, YUM!" (which was rather funny coming from my husband). Absolutely perfect the way it was and is a definite 5* in my books!

I used brown rice instead because that's what I had on hand. The spicy dressing is perfect with any combo of veggie/bean/grain ingredients you have. I used orange/red/yellow bell peppers, yellow onion, green onions, black beans, and maybe tomatoes. Was entirely devoured at a potluck... and I'm making it again right now for another potluck! I left out the cilantro, since about 50% of people seem to think it tastes like soap. Glad to have this recipe!

This recipe won hands down....Instead of black beans I substituted pinto beans with jalepeno's and it added an extra kick.  Also, a trick I learned to get the most juice from your limes is to cut them in half and micro for 30 seconds or so on a micro safe dish cut side down.  Even my husband who is not fond of quinoa couldn't get enough of this of this recipe.  I served it chilled, but it's good either way.

I never reviewed a recipe before, but this was sooo good! I also had never had quinoa before, so I was a little nervous. I added corn from a fresh cob; but other than that, followed the recipe. Scrumdiddly, you are responsible for my new quinoa addiction! I cooked the quinoa w/broth in my rice cooker and let it cool in the marinade in the fridge and it turned out great! Thank you so much!!!

Delicious!  Made this recipe as stated except did not add salt or pepper.  We ate it fresh, again the next day and loved the light fresh taste.  A wonderful ( and healthy) change from the pasta, potato and mayo salads, this will be a summer staple in our home!

This is a great recipe. I make a big batch over the weekend and then have it during the week. It's very tasty, keeps well and is probably 90% cheaper than buying it pre-made from a gourmet deli. Thanks very much.

Very good  -- I had to make a few slight tweaks due to ingredient shortages:  Instead of cumin, I used coriander, and instead of olive oil I used sunflower seed oil.  I can't say much about the oil replacement (not as much flavor), but the coriander worked out great.  If you have leftovers, top a serving with 1 avocado, 1 hard boiled egg, and a dollop of both salsa and sour cream.  Makes a meal that's full of flavor and nutrients!

This recipe is a staple in our household.  It is easy enough for a quick weeknight dinner and pretty and tasty enough to impress at a potluck.  My daughter brought it to a class party and the 9th graders devoured it.  My kids and husband love it and any of them can whip it up when Mom works late or is tired.  The quinoa is a complete protein so we just eat it as a main dish with a salad on the side.  We make it exactly as written, no tweaking necessary.  So easy to keep all the ingredients on hand.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!!

This is my favourite quinoa recipe.I take it to pot lucks and always get asked for the recipe. If I have time I will toast the quinoa first for a little added flavour and I always put fresh sliced avocado on top because it just seems to go hand in hand. This is also one of those recipes that even tastes better the next day

This is probably my favorite quinoa recipe. But note: it's called 'zesty' for a reason! If you have a sensitive palette, consider reducing the cumin and/or lime. Otherwise, leave it as is and enjoy!

I've made many variations of this recipe, and it never fails to please. I followed as is, except I had to leave out the beans because I absentmindedly purchased REFRIED black beans. Yeah, those wouldn't work too well! I also used a bit more cumin and red pepper flakes (personal preference).

This recipe is excellent! It also works wonderfully with couscous. ...which make the recipe even faster. The key ingredients are the cilantro, lime, and cumin. I tend to double the dressing but half the salt. Perfect! Though I haven't tried it yet, I suspect that the basic recipe would work just fine with white or brown rice if you have that on hand. Definitely worth a try! All around a solid keeper!

It was OK..kind of bla.  But then I haven't found any Quinoa Salads that aren't.  So maybe I just don't like Quinoa.

Wonderful!! This is a refreshing way to gussy up quinoa for all vegans and food lovers alike. Wouldn't change a thing....maybe I'd double the recipe so there'd be more leftovers for the week.

Perfection!  I suddenly have to avoid animal protein and found that quinoa is full of it - so I tried this salad for the whole family.  I love cilantro and the like so I doubled the recipe.  I'm so glad I did!  Great the first day - better the second.  My husband put chicken on it the next day and I added avocado.  I will keep it in my fridge from now on!  Teril

best quinoa recipe ever!  It is zesty and delicious.  I made this last night to have for lunch today.  I cannot wait to dig into it.  I couldn't stop "testing" it last night, LOL!  It is wonderful.

Eating and enjoying this now.  The only changes I made was subbing greek yogurt for the olive oil and I didn't have tomatoes so used diced red peppers.  Great quick, healthy lunch.

This recipe is great!  I loved the flavors.  I would probably cut the oil to 1/8 of a cup instead, especially if you're using olive oil.  Contrary to belief, there is very little to no benefits in olive oil, from a micronutrient standpoint.  Just fat and calories.  I would use hemp oil or other nutritive oils in place.  Otherwise, it's excellent!

Delicious! Made for a Labor Day cookout and it was a hit for all generations and diet types!!

I followed the recipe, except for switching green onions with white onions.

I  made a 1.5X batch, and I added some ingredients:

- diced jalapeño 
- diced avocado
- sweet yellow corn.

And, I saw a suggestion to boil the quinoa in a broth. I boiled mine in vegetable broth.

Love this recipe.  So easy and my husband even liked it!!  He is always apprehensive when it looks healthy.  The ultimate compliment from him is, "I would eat THAT again!"  
Very flavourful and a nice presentation.  I made it with the tricolour quinoa.  Thank you for submitting this recipe for all of us to try and enjoy!

Original recipe has a bit too much cumin. I now use 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin, 3/8 to 1/2 cup cilantro, and about 2 cups cherry tomatoes, quartered (up to the whole pint container.) Yum!

LOVE this recipe!! I am always asked to make this salad. The only thing I do differently is I make the quinoa in low sodium vegetable stock, not water. I think that makes it more flavourful. Thank you for this recipe!!

Made this for dinner last night--delicious.!  I added lots of minced garlic because we love garlic. Other than that, I made as directed.  Did add diced avocado and four jumbo shrimp, grilled in cumin and garlic powder, to each plate.  Yum. Certainly a keeper.  Always looking for new quinoa recipes.

Made this pretty close to the recipe. I love EVOO so I added a little more and a little more lime  and zest.  My family pretty much turned their noses up to quinoa till this recipe....I have had requests for this again and other quinoa salads from this food site.  Thanks for the creative salads.

This was my first attempt at a quinoa salad and it was delicious.  I cooked the quinoa in a can of chicken broth plus enough water to make 2 cups.  I didn't use the full amount of lime, because people said they didn't like it...next time I will try a little more than 1 lime.

This was my first time making Quinoa, and a perfect choice.  I made the following adjustments based on reading some reviews and adding my preferences.  I cut the cumin to 1 1/2 t instead of 2.  I used 1 1/2 squeezed lime instead of 2.  I added a tad of honey to the olive oil mix (maybe a teaspoon to 1 1/2.). Also when I added all the items in the bowl, I took minced garlic and just sprinkled it across the top before mixing (wanted garlic but not overwhelming it). This salad was so delicious! My husband even loved it. Can't wait to try tomorrow after sitting overnight.

This salad is wonderful just as it is, served chilled or warm. This time round I added chopped red pepper, 1/2 cup diced cucumber,  1/2 cup corn, and a 1/2  avocado chopped, in addition to the green onions, and added 1/2 tsp of honey to the dressing. I had no tomatoes, so I used 1/4 cup of sundried tomatoes. I also substituted a tin of chick peas for the black beans. WOW! It is incredible. The cilantro and cumin give it a wonderful kick. I think a chopped jalapeno and a bit of feta would be amazing too. Everyone here is asking for the recipe.

Have experimented with this from time to time.  The listed recipe is great! Sometimes will add some frozen corn kernels and substituted fresh minced jalapenos instead of chili flakes. A very versatile recipe that is light and refreshing.

My sister and I have tweaked this.... We add more cumin, a couple tsps of curry powder, cayenne pepper, and instead of green onions I sautee onion and garlic and add that. I add corn, and sometimes use red pepper instead of tomato. But it's fairly versatile so you can improvise.

I love this simple dressing! I added avocado, spinach, red onions and omitted the bell peppers. The beauty of this salad is that you can add anything you want and make it your own. The cumin does wonders to this dressing .

Really good.  I made it because I was specifically looking for a way to use some Quinoa.  But I actually like this better than the similar black bean salad.  My husband really liked it too.  Good for picnics as it doesn't really require refrigeration.  Add an avocado for extra goodness.  Thanks for the recipe - will make again.

Just be sure to use smaller limes so that the lime isn't too overpowering. 
Make it a healthy, filling meal by stirring in half of a diced avocado and serving over greens. Drizzle yogurt sauce on top and you're really in business.
Of course, delicious on its own too. :)

This is my favorite way to eat quinoa! It doesn't taste healthy, it tastes almost identical to chipotle. It is so, so delicious and refreshing - I've made it several times in the past month.  I add corn, only 1 (somewhat heaping) teaspoon of cumin, an extra half of a lime, and a lot of extra cilantro and green onion because it just really helps bring out that lime flavor.

This is one of the best lunch salads I've EVERY made....I add a little more crushed red pepper, but other than that, I don't change a thing.  I absolutely love it!  I also broil chicken breast and take a 2 -3 ou slices to eat as a small entre.  So tasty, full of flavor, and packed with lots of good nutrients.

Easy & tasty!  I didn't have quite enough cilantro on hand, and I think that would have made it even better.

I blew the socks off my entire family, and even myself, with this dish. I followed the recipe exactly, but added a few things based on my personal taste: 1 can of corn, rice vinegar, and topped each bowl with a little light sour cream.

This was my first time making this dish and although it was a little salty for me (I'll reduce it next time I make it) - it was delicious!  I wasn't a big quinoa fan before  - until this dish!  I'll be making this weekly!

Absolutely fantastic.  Very flavorful, and quick and easy to make.  Went well with Ham Steak, but I plan to try it on it's own this summer (I probably could have just eaten this alone!) with and without chicken, as suggested.  

I think this is my new summer staple!!!!

Tasted way better than I expected. I cooked the quinoa in chicken stock instead of water, and added grilled chicken. The black beans, lime, cumin, and cilantro gives it a Tex-Mex feel.

Very good salad. I did change the dressing though. The amount of salt and cumin sounded like too much. I cut them  in half.

This is a wonderfully tasty salad, and very easy to make. It is perfect just the way it is, but who can resist adding their own touch? I added half a can (drained) shoepeg corn, just for color, and I also was able to find yellow cherry tomatoes, so I used half red/half yellow cherry tomatoes.  This is now my favorite salad!

I always add a little extra cumin, cilantro, and lime juice. I think it gives the recipe a little extra pizzaz.

Hearty, excellent flavor. The cumin really has a great taste in this almost perfect quinoa dish. The fresh vegetables add a wonderful light balance to the heartiness of the quinoa.

I loved it.  I didn't have cherry tomatoes so I diced up 2 1/2 regular tomatoes. I used chicken broth instead of water to cook quinoa. I added leftover chicken and corn from the night before.  I also cut up a large handful of spinach into small pieces for added vegetable power. Since I knew we would have leftovers, I only added the spinach to the bowls we were eating.  I also added some feta and goat cheese crumbles.  So healthy and yummy!

I followed the directions almost exactly.  I halved everything because I was making it for only myself.  I diced a regular tomato because I didn't have cherry tomatoes and used a yellow onion.  It came out so delicious!!  I am not a regular eater of quinoa, raw onions or raw tomatoes, so I was a little apprehensive, but this was delicious and I will make this many more times! Thank you!

This is my favorite way to use quinoa so far.  I'm not a big fan of cumin, but it is perfect for this salad.  It is definitely better cold "the next day".  I've made it several times - I use a Thai chili powder instead of the pepper flakes.  This time I added a little fish sauce. We'll see how that works!

Wow, wasn't sure what I was expecting but this was very good.  I used less lime because I usually prefer less than recipes call for, and the only other change was to use garlic salt, because shouldn't garlic be in everything? I will need to double next time because there won't be leftovers today.

This would be one of the best Quinoa recipes I have had. Was full of flavor. You could vary the amount of lime and chili depending on your taste, I used exactly the amount the recipe stated and loved it. I was having mine warm and do not like uncooked tomatoes in a warm dish, so I substituted the tomatoes for corn. I did not add more salt when adding the pepper, I figured there was enough in the sauce. I will definitely make again 10

We bought Costco's last week and loved it so I thought I would try it. I used four times the amount of red pepper flakes and used pico de gallo instead of cutting up tomatoes and onions since that was sold at the store and seemed so much easier and we like things spicy.  I loved the recipe it is delicious. I will make this frequently. Thank you.

I started making this salad last summer and didn't write a review - because honestly I seldom write reviews about anything online!  I LOVE this recipe.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  I'm not a vegetarian, but my partner is.  She loves it too and just now she asked me to "make plenty of it" because as others have pointed out it's even better the next day.  Terrific to put in a container for lunch at work!

My sister brought this salad to a potluck dinner and although the combination seemed odd, my husband and I were pleasantly surprised - it was excellent!  So much so, I am planning to make it myself tonight, only 2 days later. Another perk - you can make it a day ahead and it doesn't need to be heated.

First time I have ever made anything with quinoa.  Didn't even know what it was:)  Delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

Absolutely loved the colour, texture and flavour of this salad. It has opened up a whole new world of quinoa for me. Easy 5 stars!

This is the best salad.   I followed the recipe exactly except adding some extra cilantro and it was hard not to eat the whole thing.  Great for a group or just a dinner for one. I bought the frozen quinoa which just needed to be defrosted so it was very easy and quick.  My favorite recipe!

I served this for a Memorial Day bar-b-que, and everyone enjoyed it! The lime kick went great with the chipotle marinated grilled chicken recipe from this site!  Thank you for this recipe!

Big hit! Followed the recipe closely but we didn't have cilantro and it was still delicious.  I'm already looking forward to batch No. 2 with cilantro.

I love this recipe. However, I do not use any oil and I add more lime juice. I found it's much better after some hours in the fridge or the next day. I've made this so many times,it's definitely one of my favorites.

This is my favorite way to eat quinoa. My friends made this for me a few years ago and I've been making it ever since. If you don't think you like quinoa, try it in this salad. You will fall in love.

I didn't change a thing.  Except I cooked the black beans fresh in the pressure cooker instead of canned. My picky husband and my children said it is the best salad I've made to date...and they hate quinoa! I love that now I can cook quinoa. I served it with BBQ salmon steaks. It was a great combination.

I love this recipe!  I too added a few items...kale, corn, edamame, and feta cheese!  I use Key limes, because it's what I have, so maybe just a sprinkle of brown sugar to cut the acid so much.

I made this last night, followed the directions and served it warm. I loved it, my guest found it too sour for her taste. I will make it again using one lime. I tried it again this morning cold, it was even better after allowing the flavors to marry!!

Made this for dinner one night, served warm.  Then had as leftovers the next day.  Huge difference.  It was so much better cold the next day, allowing the flavors to marinate longer.  Will definitely be making again!  And loved the suggestion to add avocado.  Heavenly!

Delicious! I didn't add extra salt, as it was perfect without!  I added chopped up chicken for a nice grilled chicken salad!  It was also nice rolled up in a warm tortilla with a little cheese:).

I really love this dish, but what made me rate it 4*s is the cherry tomatoes.  Now I will try this dish in the summer when there are actually delicious tomatoes to use and I bet it will be a 5* dish.  I made the dish exactly, but used 1 lime and since I had 1/2 lemon left over from another dish, I used that.  I don't think there is too much anything in the recipe.  I will experiment with this.  A far cry from the first quinoa dish I tried years ago.  That I hated, this I loved.

It would have been delicious if not for the overpowering of the limes.  Next time I will just use one lime.  I didn't have the beans and used avocado instead.

Love this dish. The only thing I change is adding less water (I prefer my quinoa less mushy) and sometimes I will add avocado.  It's also good in a flour tortilla with greek yogurt for sour cream :)

Loved it. Added chopped orange bell pepper for crunch and more cilantro, and a little less salt and oil. The lime is a huge win, keeps it light. Thank You srumdiddly!

Like a burst of spring in your mouth.  My whole family loved this salad.  I did make a couple small modifications: Used 1 large lime and only 1 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp salt.  Cooked quinoa 10 mins to avoid sogginess.

This is one of my very favorite recipes on allrecipes.com.  It's so easy to make, delicious, and healthy.  I usually just make a large batch early in the week, and try to ration it all week long.  Alas by Wednesday, I'm all out.

Absolutely loved it but I'm a tweaker so used chicken broth as liquid to cook quinoa.  I served at a bridal shower and needed to increase quantity so cooked additional quinoa and added a can of mixed marinated beans and some chick peas.  I sprinkled a bit of feta cheese over the top.  Everyone loved it - will definitely make it again - has such a fresh taste and it definitely is just as good or better the next day!

I doubled the recipe exactly with the exception of the lime juice, because my limes were quite large (limes vary immensely in size which those who thought it had too much lime should keep in mind) so that I could rate the recipe truly. (You can't make changes and then rate a recipe.  I found it delicious! (probably a 4 1/2 star- great for me...a little spicy for some)  After tasting and rating it, I added more fresh tomatoes, finely chopped carrots, 3 small orange/red peppers chopped, frozen corn 1 1/2 cups, and chopped avocado shortly before serving. Great recipe to add whatever you have on hand or desire!  It would be great with finely chopped chicken breast to make a meal for the men who can't seem to do without meat.

Really tasty. We replaced the quinoa with couscous.  Light and refreshing dish that we'll likely use to bring to grillouts.

This salad is really wonderful, since I have gone glutton free, we have tried quite a few and I keep going back to this.  I take it for lunches for up to three days and it still tastes great.

I have made this recipe many times, I agree with some who thought the recipe made as written was salty, I only added salt to taste.

I loved it!  I used a mixture of red and white quinoa and made it with chicken broth instead of water,  so deleted the salt.  Also added red pepper and black olives.  Yum!!

Ive made this a few times a few different ways. I do love the way the recipe is written. My favorite way is reducing the oil. toast the quinoa a few minutes then cook in chicken stock. Used 2 cans of black beans. I added 1/4 tsp curry and 1/8 tsp ginger. Roasted the cherry tomatoes. Instead of green onion, I used red onion. Added 2 cups spinach. Feta cheese crumbles on top.

Love, love, love this recipe! I cut back on the green onions and squeezed a little extra lime juice over it after it refrigerated overnight. I read reviews of which quinoa brand was best and bought Bob's Red Mill - expensive, but worth it. The second day I put some cut up leftover steak in it. Yum!

Awesome! I put in a little less lime juice. I also went to the olive bar at the local market and bought olives and garlic using the olive oil in the recipe. a little red onion to finish off. Yum!

This is a wonderful recipe - very flavorful.   After a few tries I made two changes that I always incorporate now.   I used purple onion instead of green onion.  It adds a great color and flavor to the salad.   I also add a can of corn, rinsed and drained, along with the black beans.  Again, great flavor and nice color.   The dressing is really tasty.   My family loves it, and I plan to serve it at Bunco.

This was fantastic as far as quinoa recipes go!  Will use this on a 30 day cut diet.  Didn't have limes, so subbed a few drops of lemon juice (as it was all I had).  I cut the cumin to about 1.5 tsp.  I forgot the tsp of salt, which I'm glad I did--a few dashes at the end, and it was salty enough.  I didn't add the cherry tomatoes and they weren't missed.  I also sauteed some white onions, which I subbed for the green onions.  My cilantro wasn't fresh, so I used dried which I'll do again next time.

So tasty. One thing I've learned to do different is for those with family or friends who do not like tomatos (go figure, right?) Just leave the tomatoes on the side adding them as you scoop out a serving if desired. Then those who love and hate tomatos are all satisfied.  I will make this again and again (about to make it again right now!)

this was absolutely delicious.  I used lemons instead of lime and did not have cumin.  I used a tsp of Asian spice.  Will definitely make this again. I've been looking for a healthy dish made with Quinoa.  Denise

Scrumdiddly hit this one out of the ballpark. WOW! Talk about a flavor party in your mouth. This will be a repeat in my household. So much flavor. I thought it might be a little too spicy so I backed off the red pepper flakes just a little. Next time I will put the right amount in because it wouldn't have been that spicy. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE! :)

This is a great recipe and has become one of my favourites. I've shared this with my family and coworkers and they all love it. Delicious served with goat cheese and warm bread. The second time I made it I didn't have black beans so I used chick peas. I've also added diced cucumber, diced avocado and on occasion, sprouts.

This is my first time having quinoa, and I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing so I can chill it in the fridge for dinner later! XD I made a few changes to work with what I had on hand: used lemon instead of lime, a combination of fresh cilantro and dill, replaced the tomatoes with chopped Japanese cucumber, and finally, added toasted cashews into the mix. I had thought that the oil and cumin would be too much, but I was wrong, the balance of the flavours is just nice! Salt amount was fine for me too. Ahhh it's delicious! Thank you for this recipe!

I've let it sit for a few hours before assessing.  I think that it's solid and as good as any of the quinoa salad at Whole Foods.  I look forward to dinner.  Thank you.

Outstanding!  This recipe is easy to make and tastes delicious.  I make it in the morning. let it sit in the fridge so the flavors meld, and then eat it later.  It's a super side dish, healthy snack, or even a light main course!

Great recipe!  I always cook my quinoa with chicken broth rather than water to give it more flavor.  I definitely think that 2 tsp cumin is too much - I cut that down to a single tsp, and added a little bit of zesty italian dressing because otherwise the quinoa gets pretty dry.

Looove it!  The first time I made this I allowed the olive oil and seasonings to sit for a while in the bowl before adding to the quinoa. It looked like more oil than was necessary, so I added the oil mixture by spoonfuls to the quinoa and other veggies, until I had all that I wanted. We also aren't huge tomato eaters, so I reduced this amount considerably. Second time around I used just over 1/8 cup of oil and nearly doubled the red pepper flakes. (I like a little spice.) Definitely a new favorite!

Delicious!! Left out the tomatoes and cilantro, was still fantastic.  The lime juice *makes* this dish. This is not that spicy, but for my roommate who doesn't like any spicy food, she heated it up with some sour cream and had nothing but rave reviews.  Perfect warm or cold.  So easy to make.  This is definitely going to be put into my every week rotation - perfect for packing for lunch or throwing together for a potluck.

This was an excellent choice for my staff potluck, lots of great reviews and very little left over! I was worried about the amount of cumin and oil based on other reviews but followed the recipe and found the flavour perfectly balanced. After sitting overnight it helped flavours meld better, but was a bit drier than I wanted so I  gave it another squirt of lime juice and olive oil and it was fine.  I added edamame which was a great addition. Next time will add avocado also. A keeper!

Initially I rated this after eating it warm on the first day. After chilling it overnight and eating it the next day, I am adding the fifth star :) It is GOOD! Yum! 
Below was my first review of the dish.
"I like this recipe. I cooked the quinoa in the rice cooker and used the low sodium canned black beans. This is only the second quinoa dish that I enjoy eating."

The flavor is great but a little over whelming.  I only used 1 lime and that was enough.  I even did 1 1/2 cups quinoa and 3 cups water to mild out the flavor.  Everything else I did exactly as the recipe stated.

This is a favorite at my house made exactly as it's written. However, sometimes we switch up the black beans for garbanzo beans and add sautéed super firm tofu and black olives.

i really liked it. I served it cold. I only used 1 lime and added lemon juice. I also added more cumin. Maybe i didn't measure salt but i did not think it was salty and i added some season salt and onion and garlic powder to it. I plan to make it for all my bbq's this summer. I used organic black beans in the can and rinsed it well before added.

Great recipe!  I doubled the recipe and added 4 ears fresh corn cut from the cob and most of a package of queso fresco.  It is chilling right now for a potluck tomorrow and I am having a difficult time staying out of it.

This was amazing.  It was my first attempt at making Quinoa and this is definitely a keeper.  The first time we ate this warm and there were no leftovers!  The second time I prepared this, I chilled it and then added sliced avocado right before it was served.  Excellent recipe!

Excellent recipe - and very simple to make - even my picky husband who is very meat and potatoes liked it.  Great to serve with grilled anything...everyone loved it and it is a nice alternative to potato or pasta salad.....(I did leave out the red pepper flakes, because we don't like too much spice, but I think I will try it with them the next time I make it)

I just made this salad and it's delicious!!  I think the versatility of this recipe is what makes it outstanding.  I had lemons, so used those instead of limes.  I also had a couple orange peppers and added those for a nice crunch. Definitely can adjust seasonings to personal preference but I do like the addition of cumin and red pepper flakes. Thanks for the recipe!

New to quinoa and wanted recipes that the whole family would enjoy. This is a great way to include quinoa in your diet. The salad is fresh and light, great for a summer side dish. Love love love this recipe.

This was rocking!!  I will probably add a little less salt next time, and I am a salt-lover, so I can see that some would find this recipe as-is too salty.  I used lemon juice instead of lime because that's what I had on hand.  I will be making this often - and in fact am thinking of making it tomorrow again (one week later) because it is so good.  I will use a bit more red pepper flakes next time, and can imagine that many more yummy veggies could be added or even grilled chicken if desired.  This is a new favorite.

Cut the salt by half!  The lime taste was so strong when we first had this- way too tangy.  After letting it sit in the fridge overnight this turned out excellent!  I used extra cilantro.

I made this for a potluck at work this week and several people asked me for the recipe.  There was another quinoa salad there that was good, but believe me this one knocked it out of the ballpark.  I never follow recipes exactly so I didn't use as much salt or oil.  Just created the dressing by taste.  So yummy.  Can't wait to make it for my husband.

Loved it!  I originally cut back on the lime as per reviews. After tasting it I added all, if not more, of the lime juice. I think the recipe is perfect. Can't wait for summer to roll around to have this as a side dish with some delish BBQ. thanks for sharing ;)

WOW!!!  I have never cooked with quinoa but trying to eat healthier so I pick it up at the store.  I loves this recipe. I used 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, right amount of heat for me.  Enjoy!!!

LOVE this recipe! It was the first one i tired from this site about a year ago and it was so easy to prepare and the flavors are blended so well that it was an instant hit. It's now my "specialty" and i bring to all my potlucks, social functions, etc. It's a great way to introduce your loved one to Quinoa and the amazing benefits of this grain. If you like this one, try the shrimp fried quinoa recipe too.

I absolutely love this salad! I skipped the oil because we just don't need the extra calories. I would not change a thing otherwise! This was my first time eating or cooking quinoa. I had to cook it a little longer than stated in order to get it to absorb all the liquid. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I loved this recipe!  After a weekend of failed cooking attempts, this was the one thing I loved.  I substituted fat free greek yogurt for the oil because I wanted to reduce the fat.  I also added 1 tsp of cumin instead of two.  It's a little salty but it's still very good.  I think you can get away with 1/2 tsp of salt and be fine.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent flavor and oh so healthy!!  It has a wonderful tang!  I could almost eat the entire recipe at one time!
As stated by a previous reviewer, it is even better the econd day as the ingredients have a chance to meld together.

Great fresh high protein salad! The only changes I made were to cut the crushed red pepper in half since I have heat-sensitive diners in the house and reduced the cilantro since I don't like that flavor too much. Half the batch stayed home and half went back to college with my daughter. She didn't look impressed when she put it away but the next day I received a text raving about it and asking for the recipe. Two days later the lime has mellowed but it's still delicious. Holds up well if you want to bring it to a party etc or just to pack for lunch for a couple of days.

I made this salad the day before for a funeral luncheon I couldn’t attend. The organizer contacted me afterwards to say this salad was so yummy! One of the attenders and three of the helpers asked for the recipe. That’s a keeper!

I live in Japan so my access to certain ingredients is limited. I substituted the black beans for red kidney beans, the cilantro for parsley and only used one lime. I also skipped the olive oil. I like things spicy so I added a LOT of red pepper flakes haha. It was REALLY tasty! Definitely going to make it again!

It's such a refreshing, tasty salad! I only had quinoa with red bulgur, but it worked out great as a substitute. I will definitely be making this again.

This salad is absolutely wonderful. I have made this many times and have tried various different versions. During the winter, I switch up the fresh tomatoes for sun dried tomatoes and even add roasted red peppers. Yum!!

I have been making this recipe many times since I first found it. I love it both chilled and I love it warm with some leftover grilled sliced chicken.Only change was to decrease the salt since we are trying to watch our sodium intake. I swear it tastes even better a day or two later. Yum!!! Thanks so much for sharing it!

I don't know if I've ever left a review for a recipe, but this one deserves it.  This was really delicious and fresh tasting.    I stuck to the recipe,  except I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes, and I used a little less cumin, because I don't really like how it's taste can overpower everything.  I'm already looking forward to making this recipe again.  The ingredients may seem too basic to be flavorful enough, but I think it should be made at least one time without substitutions. I'm looking forward to taking it to work for lunch.

This a fantastic recipe! I made a few changes based on my personal taste and what I had in the house. First I cooked some onion and garlic in a small amount of butter and olive oil, then added 2 cups chicken broth and the quinoa and cooked until done. I didn't have black beans so added a can of chickpeas and sliced black olives (my family doesn't care for tomatoes).
I'll be making this again to take to work for lunch.

I found this recipe to be quite bland. It needed red onions instead of green, fresh garlic, lemon juice instead of lime juice, maybe a dash of chili powder, the quinoa needed to be cooked in broth rather than water, maybe some corn for some crunch, and sprinkled with some cheese.

Really simple and good recipe for a tasty salad.

I found that once you make it , it can be a little to acidic (see other reviewers mention this) but if you leave it  in the fridge overnight the acidity tones down and it's excellent the next day.

So, I recommend if you need to serve it immediately then, use less lime juice. 

Another great addition is feta cheese - the saltiness of the cheese balances the lime juice well.

This recipe is amazing! I know there were a couple of reviews where they stated it was too salty but o did not find it so. Could be they might be a little salt sensitive? Aside from that I cannot think of a better recipe to make and treat others with. I shared with some of my coworkers, some of which who do not like cold quinoa, and they LOVED it just as much as I did. This will surely be a “go to” recipe for years to come.

This was a great recipe. The only changes I made were toasting the quinoa for 10 minutes in a little oil as a couple other reviewers suggested and I reduced the salt in the dressing by half. Will definitely make this again.

I made one of these quinoa salads and I felt it was so good for my digestive tract!  I actually lost some weight and I felt my intestine get strengthened.  I am so glad you have recipes like this for me so I can improve my digestive mobility and strengthen those long muscles that I will need for years to come.  Thank you Allrecipe website!!

I drizzled the dressing onto the salad and had some left over which I used as regular salad dressing. It tastes spectacular the next day. My husband is asking me to make it again.

Family said they loved it.  I like a dressing with a nice citrus tang and this didn’t quite have it, So that can be adjusted another time.  It  look s good too.  Served 5 as a side dish and leftovers at lunch the next day.

I would make it again with my changes .  I used half the salt and low sodium black beans.  Was very bland so added the remainder of the salt and more lime.  Now we are talking.  Also used Roma tomatoes, orange and yellow peppers and cucumber.  Everyone at party raved about it.    My first time with quinoa.  Easy.

I love this salad. This last time I made it for a church potluck hoping to add some healthy options to the mix. I heard positive comments from several pepole. Since I was making it for a group, I subbed chili powder for the red pepper. And, because I don't like tomatos that have been refrigerated, I left those out and added one red bell pepper and one yellow bell pepper (to a double recipe). I could eat this every day.

Tastes great! Adjusted slightly by using only 1/4 tsp of the red pepper flakes and added 3 mini sweet peppers. Straight after completion there’s great flavor and texture. Looking forward to the flavor tomorrow.

Super easy and tastes delicious! Hearty enough to be a meal.  Followed the recipe, and used tricolor quinoa, a very fine dice on the onions, and the juice AND pulp from the lime.  When I make it again, I'll definitely juice and pulp the limes again - it was so fresh tasting, and really brightens up the smokey cumin flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly when I first made it. Delicious! Then, we started to mix things up because of availability of ingredients and feeling creative. 

Add fresh-cooked corn cut off the cob (1-2 ears), so colorful; lovely, sweet burst. Try lemon, instead of lime. Toss in Cajun spice blend. Great with tortilla chips. Fold in pieces of grilled chicken. Make a lettuce or tortilla wrap. Sliced cherry tomatoes are the best. Diced regular tomatoes just break down and get lost. Be careful; the onions become stronger on the second day. Red pepper flakes are fabulous, but they can be left out if necessary. Cumin is critical. Oh, so good. We've made it about 10 times in the last three months. Never the same. Always awesome. Favorite new dish! Thanks!

Best Quinoa Salad Recipe EVER! I have stopped trying other quinoa salad  recipes...my family complains that it's not the same! We all like this recipe so I double it for leftovers...never lasts very long! I served this on a bed of fresh greens. Arugula pairs nicely with the spicy salad.

This was my first quinoa recipe and it came out so delicious, very light, & refreshing. I cooked dry beans, rather than using the canned. I used only 1 lime, because of a comment I saw about it being too sour . I also added a dash of cayenne, garlic powder, lemon pepper, & siracha for spice. I ate it hot and can't wait to try it cold. I will be making this again soon!

This is a great salad.  To kick it up a bit, I add corn, cucumber, red pepper, yellow pepper or orange pepper to it.  Also, if you want, you can add fresh avocado.  I wouldn’t put the avocado in the salad but just add it as a topping.  The rest can go in the fridge for a number of days.  I double the recipes.  We love this salad.

Did not add black beans...and added cubed sharp cheddar cheese. Cilantro was a bit strong, but could have been the fresh bunch purchased. Overall, it was a great salad!

I added grilled beets this time. Tasty as always. Don't forget the cucumber and sweet peppers, also. The blood orange olive oil and espresso balsamic vinegar and a touch of citrus habanero made a delicious dressing.

This was outstanding and my whole family loved it -  they are a really picky bunch and turn their nose up to quinoa, but they really enjoyed it.  I added radishes and bell peppers to get extra crunch and it was delicious.

I used only 1/4 tsp. of cumin.  I increased the cilantro to 1/2 of a cup.  The recipe is delicious.  I've made it twice now in just 2 weeks.  Everyone really liked it and asked for the recipe.

So good!! Doubled for my family of 6 for an easy/light summer dinner & wished we had more! The only changes i made was adding a diced red bell pepper & red onion. Wished I’d had some sweet corn to add to it too! Will definitely be making again!

Every time I make this for company (three X)my guests invariably request the recipe.  No doubt it's delicious & a crowd pleaser; served as a salad or side dish.  I follow the recipe as directed but use vegetable broth for half the liquid. 
I gave it a 4 rated because the prep time is misleading.  If you can slice onions, tomatoes & cilantro in less than 20 minutes I take me hat of to you!   Prep time of 35 to 40 minutes (I made for 10) is more realistic.

This is my go-to potluck contribution (I get so many compliments every time!) and my favorite summer meal. I like to add some extra cherry tomatoes and cilantro, and am generous when measuring the cumin and red pepper flakes. However, if you make the recipe exactly as it’s written, you will be VERY pleased. This one is a winner.

Salt could be left out to make  lower in sodium content. Great taste, although I used half the cumin and half the red pepper flakes; delicate tongues in family.

My favorite quinoa salad! I liked it room temperature and cold. Loved the taste of the cumin and cilantro and heartiness of the added black beans. An attractive summer salad- definitely a keeper!

Great salad. Be careful not to cook quinoa too long, it can get a little mushy. I will cook more quinoa and shorter time next time. I also added feta cheese, red bell pepper and avocado. Dressing was great, I used just a pinch of salt - people can always add more to their individual servings if they wish. Overall great, versatile recipe that’s easy to alter to fit individual tastes.

Tasty. Quick. I didn't have green onions. Red onions diced would work too. I added steamed corn on the cob. Very nice, filling, healthy, satisfying meatless dish that I can have warm for supper and leftovers cold for lunch tomorrow.

Tastes fresh and bursting with flavor. It's so popular in our house, I may need to grow more cilantro. I like to let it cool in the fridge for a couple hours and then add diced avocado just before serving. I might try feta cheese rather than avocado on the next batch.

I have a confession... I have never eaten quinoa, let alone made it, so when I volunteered to bring a quinoa salad dish to our Teacher/Staff Appreciation I had no idea what to expect. I made this recipe and followed it to a tee. Bottom line, it was an absolute hit. The teachers and staff loved it and were wanting the recipe.

I had received a recipe similar to this and lost it  
It was a great tasting salad option 
I was excited to see this recipe here  I did not add as much cumin and added more tomatoes,this seemed to balance it out 
Will continue this again

This is a fantastic healthy way to enjoy your food! We made it as a side dish and also put it into soft tacos with some spicy chipotle chicken both way were fantastic. One of the best healthy recipes I've found in a long time. My boyfriend loves it and we've made it several times already. It tastes a lot like tacos with all the cumin in it. Great vegetarian recipe as well. Passed it on to a couple of my vegetarian friends and they loved it as well.

I used red quinoa, a lot of cilantro, and a little less cumin than called for. Excellent salad, better the second day. A sliced avocado garnish and a dose of hot sauce put it over the top for me. Definitely will make it again. Thinking about trying barley in place of the quinoa.

This was an excellent dinner, and was a perfect side dish for my meat eating friends.  I used a smoked paprika instead of red pepper so it was not so spicy.  It was a hit!

This is really good!  Nice and light.  I fixed for two different dinners and it got rave reviews with second helpings.  If you like spice, you might want to add more chili flakes.

was really good but needed a bit more lime and added vinegar for some zestier flavor,  these made it much better and i would use less olive oil but that is my preference

Recipes like this make being a vegetarian EZ!  Add or subtract ingredients or amounts, it does not matter. Delicious in any combo. Avocado is our favorite addition.

This is a terrific salad. I took it to a party and it went before everything else. I never have very good luck with the grape tomatoes in the grocery store. It is well worth your while to invest in the better quality grape tomatoes since they are the star of the show. E.g., Campari brand or similar.

I first got to taste this at a local deli, theirs were a bit too sour but I still loved it. Since then, I was searching for this recipe but I do not know what it’s called. Fortunately, I found it here. I adjusted it a bit, lessen the cumin so my kids will like it, I used lemon because that’s all I have and used only 1. I rinsed the black beans in water and didn’t add much salt at all just a bit of pink himalayan salt because that’s all I’ve got and it is still soooo good!

I made it per the recipe, but for my taste felt there was too much cumin.   I would cut the cumin in half next time.  Interestingly, I have read a number of reviews that indicated there was too much lime.  I didn't think mine was acidic enough and added two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar!  I think added cilantro would be good also.  Overall, good recipe - just needs tweaking for personal tastes.

This turned out pretty well! I did cut back to 1 teaspoon of cumin instead of the 2 tsp listed. Added chopped avocado, corn, and cold sliced chicken breast.  A very healthy and filling dish!

My tomatoes went bad before I was able to make this recipe so I substituted diced cucumbers instead. I like the flavor and will make it again with more vegetables. I agree with another comment about making this hot. Tomatoes from a can when hot and fresh when planning to serve cold. I will definitely make again in some form!

Overall, this recipe was decent - I would make it again with a few changes. I personally thought it could use a little more flavor and maybe more variety in veggies? I added some chopped cucumber and a little lemon juice as well, just for some more variety in flavor.

Really good - made as instructed (except did the quinoa in chicken broth) and ate it cold.  I did add some rotisserie chicken to it so the men in my family felt they had enough protein!  Will be great for a summer meal!  refreshing!

I like this recipe and have made it several times. I find the recipe as written to be a little lacking in flavor (though a GREAT base), so have made a few adjustments. I've added ground beef, which I think adds richness and flavor, and have also added feta cheese in some iterations, which really adds something. I also add a can of corn and serve with sour cream or greek yogurt. Delicious.

I started with this recipe which I've refined many times.  The changes I've made have brought the calories down to 114 per cup (250g). I've taken out the cilantro and substituted parsley.  Instead of two limes, one lime and two lemons.  Added a chopped cucumber, taken out the pepper flakes, increased the salt to 2 ts. NO OIL, but 2 tb of fat free italian dressing, and added a roasted red pepper diced.  Any beans can be used, I like a 6 bean blend.  Best to let it sit a day before eating to allow flavour to blend.

Left out the tomatoes due to a picky eater but the whole thing was devoured. Used the dressing recipe the next day on a bean, pea, avocado salad and that was a hit too.

The struggle was real!! I'm meal prepping today and made the quinoa for my lucnhes this week..

HOLY COW! 

 I've been trying for years to find an exciting solution to make my quinoa tasty. This is spicy but not too spicy... just enough to remind you about your tastebuds. I also used tri-color quinoa to make it more interesting visually... I LOVE THIS RECIPE.

The only changes.. I used a bit of low sodium beef broth to flavor the quinoa.  This recipie is delish!!!

Love love this recipe ! I’ve made it so many times! I’ve added corn(fresh or frozen), garbanzo beans, cucumbers and/or  avocado.  Anytime I bring this dish to a potluck or party people are always asking me for the recipe! It tastes so good and fresh and keeps well in the fridge for a few days! It’s pretty easy to prepare too.

This is by far the greatest thing to ever happen to quinoa.  "Make this and be happy", said the Quinoa Gods.  I added chopped avocado and I think I died of deliciousness.

Excellent and easy!  Made twice in last 3 days. Once for party and once for me. Great warm or cold. Cooked quinoa in Vegetable broth and added extra pepper flakes. Otherwise no changes. Will be a regular addition to mealtime at my house.

This salad was a hit as my contribution to a potluck cookout for Labor Day 2018.  I modified it by reducing the red pepper flakes and the green onions by approximately half.  I also added a few tablespoons of chia seeds just before serving.

I made NO changes except to add a little more pepper flakes ( I love hot food). 

It was delicious, with enough for the next day! And a salad you can add meat–or tempeh, or seitan to for the meat texture.

I've made this many times and have changed it only slightly. I add corn, avocado and bacon.  I also use a ton of cilantro. It's one of my favorite go to quick and easy recipes year round.

First quinoa salad I've ever made and I love it!  I used 1/2 tsp less of cumin and about 1/2 amount of black beans because I'm not a huge fan... also didn't add any salt at end just the 1 tsp in dressing. Was delicious! Big hit- will def make again!

Delicious! I make this at least once a week now, and usually a double batch. I leave out the red pepper flakes and cut the cumin and lime just a tinch. It's so good and easy-- and it's now a family favorite.

I left out 1/2 of the cumin but think I will add it back.  Used regular one because I didn't have green onions.  Will use both next time.  Is really better next day.  Just appreciate this good recipe as it was my first good use of quinoa.  Tasty and good for you.

A favourite but I’ve changed quite a bit for a more flavourful kick. Keep quinoa moist. I also always double the recipe. I add chopped cucumber, green or red onion, peppers, crumbled feta or olives (skip salt if you use either), canned corn, crushed garlic and **lots of sweet balsamic vinegar** (This is key for added flavour boost. I don’t measure.)  Also try with dried cranberries or raisins and pistachios. I prefer the veggie version.

This is a wonderful salad on a hot evening. You can also add chicken or cooked prawns, to make it a main meal. I will definitely make it again.

This was amazing.  I did use chicken stock instead of water when I made the quinoa and I added fire roasted corn and skipped the tomatoes because I didn't have them.  I love the flavor of the lime and cumin!

I made this for a family BBQ and so many people complimented me on it! I left out the green onions because my sisters can't tolerate them but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

I love that you can make this in two stages. I cooked the (organic) red quinoa in the morning, and chilled it in the fridge until late afternoon.

This recipe was delicious!!! I went with half the amount of time juice and half the salt (as per recommended by an above reviewer) and I also added tiny chopped pieces of cucumber and red pepper and jalapenos for an extra kick! It turned out wonderful .... Due to the spiciness I also ate it with a spoonful of original Greek yogurt. Delicious!

This has been a hit both times I've made it. However just one lime is sufficient for us and even that can be a little overpowering so I used a teaspoon of vegennaise to soften it up a bit. Also I have to avoid nightshades (despite loving them!) and just chopped up what I had in the fridge: carrots, cucumbers, celery, red onions etc) and it still went down well.  Thank you!

This dish tasted great as is! I added a few things I had lying around for more heartiness and even more flavours; goat cheese, avocado, hemp seeds, and walnuts.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe, fresh and flavorful, and very versatile. I only had a few tomatoes so added corn, shredded carrot, edamame, and served with fresh avocado. I did not make any changes otherwise and was very pleased with the outcome. The dressing is zesty and gets a nice kick from the crushed pepper. Delicious and convenient as this can be thrown together quickly and served right away or made ahead.

Made it exactly per recipe and it was very good.  Next time, I will use less quinoa, and add more veggies.   Very versatile dish.  It's a keeper.

My friends rave about this salad when I bring it to gatherings! I add cucumber, fresh small sweet peppers or a red bell pepper, feta cheese, purple Bermuda onion, and garnish with avacado slices. 
It’s so colorful!

This is the BEST salad! I've made it twice already and you can't miss with it. I'm late to the quinoa bandwagon and just happened on this recipe. Stroke of luck!
Since I never have green onions on hand, I substituted yellow onion once and Walla Walla Sweet onion (from our own garden) once. Either way, it's terrific. I also substituted roma and regular small tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes. Lastly, I added frozen corn, simply because we like it in other salads/salsas with black beans. Otherwise I followed the recipe closely.  You cannot go wrong!!

I love citricy tasting foods! If you don’t I would suggest using less lime juice.  I’ve made it a few times different variations. It’s always tasty! 
1) It doesn’t taste quite the same when I use  regular tomatoes ?? (still good but not as good as with cherry tomatoes. 
2) same goes for the onions nothing like using the green onions.
3) I have always only used a pinch of Cumin.
4) I always add an extra can of beans. 
One of my favorites!!!

I've made this many times and get many requests for the recipe. The only change is that I chop up a red pepper. The crunch and sweetness are perfect additions. Sometimes I use 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes too.

Amazing salad! Great for vegetarians! Used only 3 green onions and it was perfect. You can let the quinoa cool and just mix in other ingredients to save a pan. Very quick and easy. Perfect measurements. Overall a great vegetarian meal.

Way too much lime. Counteracted with honey which wasn't bad. Despite this a very mediocre to poor dish. 1 star to compensate for all the 5 stars. Are these other reviews even real? Starting to wonder as many bad recipes are highly rated.

Love this! I followed others advice with the oil and lime. I added chopped cucumber for a nice crunch. I served it cold over arugula and hit it with another wheeze of lime. I will definitely be making this again!

Very flavourful salad  with lots of colour.  I used a can of lentils instead of black beans and chopped fresh chives for the green onions because it's what I had on hand.  I'm not 100% sure about the cumin, but loved the lime juice.

This is the best quinoa salad recipe ever! I added about 1 cup of feta cheese to the recipe and it tasted amazing. I encourage everyone to make this!

I didn't have any cherry tomatoes so I put in black olives.  I was just interested in using what I had on hand without a trip to the store.

Great recipe! Very tasty and better replacement for the Whole Foods quinoa salad we buy.  The only change was I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth instead of water.  Added a lot of extra flavor.  Very good!

Huge party hit and can be made in total of 20 mins! I cooked the quinoa for 10 mins while prepping all other ingredients and sauce. I then drained and cooled quinoa in freezer for 10 mins, then combined. Easy and delicious!

This is a great recipe for pot lucks, side dish etc.  One of my all time favorites.  Follow the recipe exactly or add additional veggies.  Just make additional dressing.

Super simple and yummy! Even my picky eater was a fan of this one. I have to admit that I did not believe the hype before making, but it exceeded my expectations. I did half the citrus, as recommended by other viewers. Other than that, no changes.

This was really good. I also cut down the salt and added 1 cup chopped spinach and a diced orange pepper to it. I didn't have lime so I used lemon. I will definitely make this again.

I used lemon instead of lime, didn’t use cilantro or cumin because I didn’t have any on hand, used regular onions instead of green onions, used salsa instead of tomatoes (all of this was because I just didn’t have what the recipe called for!). Used kidney beans instead of black beans and regular oil because I don’t like extra virgin. Also found out you really don’t need too much oil! Maybe half of what the recipe calls for (this could also be because I used salsa). But overall very yummy!!!!

This is so delicious!!! All I changed was added a can of corn for more color. I boiled the quinoa, but next time I’ll try cooking it in my Instant Pot. My foodie 19 year old son loves it, so it’s a double winner!

This is a delicious lunch.  The lime and crushed red pepper dressing is zesty with just the right amount of zing.  I cooked the quinoa in half chicken broth and half water andI added some cooked chicken and feta to make it an entree salad for lunch and everyone loved it.    It is easy and quick and very pretty.

This is probably my favorite quinoa recipe. I follow it pretty true to the recipe except I add a little more oil and lime juice because I like mine to be a little more "wet" and a back off on the cilantro and onion just because I think they can overpower the other flavors if you are heavy handed with them. I have substituted taco seasoning and chili powder for the cumin , white onion for the green onion, and red pepper powder for the flakes when I didn't have what I needed and it still turns out great every time. It's good warm or cold.

Recipe is delicious as written!  I first made it based on comments to reduce salt, lime, oil, etc. but wasn’t impressed so I brought those up to what the original instructions called for—much better!  I did add some organic corn and a little diced orange bell pepper.  This is so good and everything in it is healthy!  A real keeper!

Amazing taste!
Used less salt - sauce/dressing was outstanding!
Only thing I changed was the veggies, I only used a quarter yellow onion, 1/2 a red bell & yellow bell pepper each and sauteed those in some of the oil. That was it for veggies -  YUM YUM YUM cant wait to see how much better it taste tomorrow after it sits.  This is very versatile, the sauce is the true winner!

Delicious!  Four stars because it was a bit too salty and “lime-y”.  Next time I will add some garlic and cut back a bit on the lime and salt.  I always cook quinoa in organic chicken broth for flavor.  Served it warm for dinner and looking forward to having a nice bowl of cold zesty quinoa tomorrow!

This is a great base recipe. Honestly, you can add all kinds of veggies to this. I prefer more flavor in my dressing. I would recommend amping this up with a nice wasabi dressing. As is, pretty bland and boring. But as a base, full of potential and inspiring for this new vegan.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. This is exactly what I have been looking for. I think some of the ingredients could easily be swapped or added and still have a great salad. For example I would try adding chick peas, or meat or even dried cranberries. I used the 1tsp of cumin as others suggested and liked it so I stopped there. This is a very good basic recipe

First time I made this I followed everything it says and found out lime and cilantro isn’t my taste at all in this type of salad. The second time i made this recipe I used lemon instead of lime and i used parsley instead of cilantro. Also I doubled the dressing recipe and soaked the salad a bit more than the first time.

So good.  I made the quinoa with chicken broth and also added diced chicken breast & cubed feta at the end.  So delicious!  I'm keeping this one.

The only change I made to this recipe was to cut back a tiny bit on the red pepper.  I've made it many times for family and friends and it always disappears quickly. Everyone loves it..

This is delicious!
My changes: I used 1.5 limes and 1.5tsp cumin. Half the salt and olive oil in the recipe. These changes are to suit your own taste. I added a diced orange pepper. 

The recipe is extremely easy and very satisfying. Best served cold or at room temperature. It's filling and full of flavour. I think it would go well with chicken skewers.

I absolutely loved it!! I cut down the lime serving by 1/2 a lime, and replaced the beans with green beans instead. This will be my new go to salad for potlucks! Also, I doubled the portions because it certainly was not enough for  6!

Made it for a work event (ended up multiplying the recipe by 8).  Added about 1 bell pepper and a can of corn and it was well loved (especially by the vegans who rarely get to eat anything).

Great recipe and easy to make. I didn't have green onions so used red onions and added garlic to the olive oil and lime juice mixture.  Also threw in feta cheese for a little punch.

This is a dish that can include most of your favorite things...including your kitchen sink!!!  I threw in some salsa fresca instead of doing all the chopping...wasn't in the mood!! 
 Added some cucumbers in vinegar from the night before and cooked the quinoa in veggie broth with cumin in it, just cuz I like the added flavor.  Added no extra salt (ever) and added 1 rinsed can of black beans and 1 can of grabanzos because the essential aminos are good in our diet.  I love lime so squeezed two on.  The cilantro adds a zesty flavor and great combo with the cumin....will make every week!!!

I made this recipe on 2 occasions and the guests absolutely loved it. Can be made gluten free by simply using GF Quinoa. I did find it salty, so the second time round I reduced the salt to 1tsp. The volume of lime juice can vary depending on the size of the fruit. I agree that the lime can be overpowering. Next time I intend to measure the juice, add until it tastes right and note the volume of lime juice that worked.

Very good as written..but I followed the advice of a fellow reviewer and used broth to cook the quinoa in instead of just water (enhanced the flavor nicely). Had it last night for an end of summer BBQ, and it was a HIT..none left!

Great refreshing salad that I can eat as a meal.  I made it a couple of times and like to spice it up with jalapeno black beans.  You can also add bell peppers - all colors - for some crunch and color.

Originally made as posted. Loved the lime-forward flavor. Did decide on second go-around to add chopped cucumbers, yellow and orange peppers, and avocado. Super delicious!

This is so good I make it all the time, but I prefer using red wine vinegar instead of the lime juice. I keep mixing dressing until I feel it's appropriately dressed and usually add more cumin because I love the smoky flavor it gives.

Made a quadruple batch for a staff lunch at school.  Cooked quinoa with vegetable broth to keep it vegetarian for co-workers and otherwise reduced salt a bit.  It was a huge hit!

Great recipe! I added some feta cheese and cooked broccoli and it was wonderful- very fulfilling for a vegetarian lunch. Next time I make it, I think I will use a little less lime juice and substitute chickpeas for the black beans.

I thought this was delicious! I had to make a few alterations, because I did not have any cilantro in the house! I added some corn instead which gave it a sweet little pop now and then. I also used vegetable stock instead of water, and I added one clove of garlic - just because I love garlic! I garnished it with avocado.

The first time, I didn't LOVE it.  It has an acquired taste ... especially if you are not used to a healthy twist on foods....I find that after a couple of days, it taste better.... great for lunch.  I did alter the recipe to my liking.... this is what I did.  
Instead of water I used Chicken/Vegetable Broth.  
Instead of canned beans, I home cooked them with smoked Turkey.  
I added cubes of chicken
I added generous sprinkles of yellow corn for color and filling.  
When I'm really trying to be fancy I add slivered almonds.  
This is great for any occasion, concert, dinner, lunch, meal, side dish.  I hope you enjoy.

Great but I'd use less olive oil and lime juice next time.  Also reduce the amount of water a little when cooking quinoa.

Great recipe.  There is never any leftovers when I make it.  I usually cook my quinoa in vegetable broth instead of water, and add some defrosted, frozen corn kernels.  I will be making a double batch for a picnic tomorrow!

I made this for a family reunion (30 people) and it was a huge hit! I added more quinoa for the larger group, but kept the rest of the items as measured here. DEFINITELY will make this again.

Quinoa is pretty new for me  but I really enjoyed eating it this way. I thought the cumming was going to be overpowering but no, it was well balanced. We liked it.

I enjoyed the flavor combinations in this. That being said I'm now going to admit in adjusting the ingredients a bit. Sorry to the haters. I used what I had on hand. I scaled this to two servings for just me. I subbed lemon for lime and parsley for cilantro (not a fan of cilantro but LOVE parsley) and cut back on the cumin because to me a little goes a long way. I left out the beans this time because I wasn't going to open a whole can for only two servings. I agree with the other reviewer that said this was a little on the salty side so if I make again I will either leave out or lighten that up also. I have yet to find a quinoa that is not bitter to me even after rinsing before cooking. If I can get past that I will make this again.

I have just recently turned to eating vegan foods.  This qualified! So I tried it . Yum!  I always add some avocado on top too.  Even if I wasn't vegan I would love this.  Thanks!  It's a keeper.

I made it once following the recipe exactly, and it was great, I thought the dressing was just right. I just made it again substituting roasted sweet potato for the tomatoes (chopped, sprinkled with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then roasted at 400 deg for ~40 mins) and it's phenomenal!

This recipe has become one of my all time favourites.  I will make this again and again because it has so much flavour.  Additionally, I made the quinoa in my Instapot with my homemade vegetable broth (also made in the Instapot) instead of the water.  Even my non-vegetarian friends are wild for this.  It's a winner!!

This is my 'go to' recipe for potlucks, very easy to make and the ingredients are available year round. I am still learning how to cook, it's hard to find time when you work full time and go to school, I stumbled upon this recipe over a year ago when my co worker put on a last minute potluck, I didn't want to let down my co workers. Everyone loved it, it was a major hit, there were no leftovers. I followed the recipe as written, if anything I sometimes add more green onions. This dish tastes better after it has been refrigerated for a couple of hours, that's when the flavors become well absorbed and more balanced. This dish is also great if you're single and want to meal prep, I find that the quantity written will get me through the work week. I've made it with white quinoa and red (and a mixture of both). Fun fact: food coloring sticks very well to quinoa. I dyed the quinoa blue for fourth of July and my co workers thought it was really cool.

I added 1 can of corn & used a little hot sauce instead of the red pepper flakes. Double the dressing (I didn't, but will next time.) Turned out great!

Delicious and nutritious. I've  made this a few times and add a can of niblet corn, drained and rinsed  (peaches and cream). Apart from that, I usually follow the recipe exactly as written and think it's perfect however, when I made it today I used finely diced red onion as I was out of green onions. It was still very nice.

Really tasty!  Have made this dozens of times now.  I sometimes add variety with black beans, kidney beans, corn, garbanzo beans, bell peppers. . . usually adding 2 cans and upping the oil & vinegar to 1/3 cup.

This was so good!  I made a few modifications. I diced a jalapeño and added it to the cooking quinoa. Instead of pepper flakes, I used1 tsp chili powder. Lastly, I added a small can of yellow and white sweet corn.  I spooned a serving over a packet of tuna and mixed. It was delicious!!

This was excellent! I heated the rinsed black beans in a  skillet with a little bit of olive oil, the tomatoes, and onions (I used red instead of green onions) over low-medium heat for about 10 minutes before adding to the mixture. Also added 1.5 pounds of  ground turkey and 1/4 cup of diced jalapeno and tossed  everything together. The extra bit of spice was perfect!

Outstanding! I've made many times and have learned that I like to use half the lime, go very sparingly on salt and that a generous 1/8 cup of oil works very well. Also, it makes a lot so I only make a half recipe for 2 and still have plenty leftover.  It's handy when you're looking for something different to go with Latin dishes and adds an AMAZING kick when paired with scrambled egg dishes/omelettes. That's really my favorite way to eat it--though I never would have thought of it for breakfast  before I needed something quick one morning  and it was in the fridge. Very versatile dish! My favorite way to eat quinoa.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious recipe! I didn't have any tomatoes or black beans so I just used chick peas. I love the citrus taste and I added extra cilantro. Everyone's palate is different and this recipe definitely was good in my favor :)

This is soooo good. I have made it twice now and it gets better every time.  We like more beans so I added an additional can. Any kind will do. I had a can of "salad beans" that I used (garbanzo, kidney and pinto) . I also used garlic infused olive oil (1/4 cup + 1/4 cup regular olive oil) for some additional flavor. My husband who said he hated quinoa tried it and LOVED it. This is a super, healthy meal. Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I doubled it and used only one can of black beans and it was super tasty! I could taste a lot of the cumin and salt, so maybe next time I will use a little less :) overall, it was great!

Delicious!  I used chicken broth instead of water and upped the quinoa to 1 1/2 cups.  I toasted the quinoa  in little olive oil with a couple tsp. of minced garlic before adding the broth.  I halved the salt and doubled the red pepper flakes.

Wish I had read the reviews before I made it - definitely too salty - would cut the salt down to 1/2 or 1 teaspoon.  Otherwise, very good and I will make it again.

I made this last night as part of a meatless Monday dinner and it was fantastic!  Fresh and summery with the perfect amount of dressing.  I used regular tomatoes since that's what I had on hand and it was excellent!

Delicious.  

I cut the lime in half (one lime), often substitute black beans for chick peas in a can, and add lots of curry powder which makes it taste like a lovely indian dish.  If i want it meaty i'll throw in some shredded chicken.

This has quickly become a lunch favorite of mine.  I make a huge batch and eat it for several days.  I love this recipe and have made tweaks depending on what I have on hand.  For instance, I've also added diced colored peppers or fresh mango bits or used kidney beans instead of black beans.  I upped the spices to fit my preference.  Overall a really great recipe!

This is one of my go-to recipes. It's great as fresh lunch salad or as a side. Always a hit! I tend to use about half the salt though as I do with most of my cooking. Overall, this recipe is quick, easy, and a nice change to your normal weekly meals!

most excellent !  my family left not nary a drop in the pot (so to speak).  i only changed it because i did not have black beans on hand and substituted black eyed peas with snaps instead.  it was fine.   my family declared that this recipe should be a regular addition to our meals.

This dish hit the spot.  Nice blend of flavors.  I used the juice from one lime and then a bit of red wine vinegar plus a chopped avocado.  Worked out really great and was a good vegetarian dinner.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic. Easy to make without fussy ingredients, healthy and it had a very light and agreeable flavour. I made it ahead of friends coming over for dinner and let all the flavours mix - it didn't get soggy at all. I was worried about adding all the cumin into the dressing, but the lime balanced it out nicely. Even my hubby who hates beans loved this salad and already asked me to make it again. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

So perfect for my family's pledge to eating healthier! I doubled the recipe so we could make it our meal for the night and I enjoyed what was left for lunch the next day. I did everything as written. The only changes I made were I added sweet corn and a bit of honey in the dressing. Soooo good! Will be making often!

I can see myself making this often because I don't eat meat. Good source of protein and I did a lil tweaking  with some cucumber and I didn't have cilantro so I used recao. First time I made it I used chickpeas.  I love the taste of the lime and I look forward to making it some more in the future and making my own little versions. This is a great versatile salad.

Very nice salad. A bit too much lime sour flavour. I would just use one lime. I added some toasted pecans on top to serve.

This was delicious! I made the quinoa in the Instant Pot so the cooking time was much faster. I also added cucumbers to give it a bit more crunch. It turned out great!

Healthy and deliciously vegetarian. A good side salad but definitely not a main course. Will make again 100%

I made this in the evening for a light supper.  I thought the amount of cumin might be a bit much; however, it turned out to be perfect.  The balance of the black beans and tomatoes along with just the right amount of citrus and light olive oil gave it a flavor reminiscent of Cuban food near Miami and from recipes of friends in Tampa.

This is a definite do-over.   The unused portion is in the fridge, so we can test it as a cold side salad.

My one substitution was a 15 oz can of  diced tomatoes, since store-bought tomatoes are nothing like what we had on the farm in Tennessee.

Definitely worth a try.

AMAZING, though I made a few changes due to my lack of planning. Because I was out of the ingredients this called for, I had to sub in what I had. Instead of regular quinoa, olive oil, and cherry tomatoes, I used  tri-color quinoa, Tucson infused olive oil, and fresh salsa. The flavors melded PERFECTLY! This will be a new staple for me.

I was very disappointed in these recipe. I was really looking forward to it given all the good reviews, but I found the limes to be overpowering. I followed the recipe exactly, minus the cilantro because I think it tastes like soap, but the it was so citrusy and bitter that I could barely eat it.

I just made this with a few changes and it is fantastic. Instead of tomatoes I roasted an orange bell pepper. The addition of chopped rotisserie turkey made it a meal. Tastes great cold for a quick bring to work lunch.

I followed the recipe and really enjoyed the results. It had just the right amount of "kick" and flavour. I also had a few people ask for the recipe. In the future, I'll probably add corn for a little extra colour and texture.

This is really a great salad!  I absolutely LOVE lime, but I think 2 limes was a little overpowering.  I would probably reduce it to 1 big lime next time.  I followed the recipe in all other ways.  Some people said it was too much salt or too much cumin, but I didn't notice that at all.  Overall, a great recipe that was super easy to make.  UPDATE: The lime blended with the other flavors overnight and isn't overpowering to me anymore.  Very delicious!

So, so good!  My kids love it so much they renamed it to "Queen Mom Salad"  :)
The first time I made it as it is written and it was good, but  to suit to my own taste I now use more lime juice and less cumin. 
For the lime juice , I like to make sure I have at least 1/4 cup. And for the cumin, I use one 1 teaspoon instead of 2.
So, so good.

This is a great salad.  Refreshing yet hearty.  You can pair it with a nice baked salmon or grilled chicken.  I like to coat the black beans (canned, rinsed) in a tbs of red wine vinegar and salt /pepper to taste) while quinoa is cooking in the rice cooker (1:1 quinoa:water) for a little flair.  Def easy to make and solid!

I have not cooked with Quinoa very much, and when I have it was not very good.  I followed this recipe exactly as written except that I did not have cherry tomatoes, so I substituted a can of rotel tomatoes with chili's and I added a little bit of lime zest with the lime juice.
This dish was INCREDIBLE!   Excellent!  I knew with flavors like ground cumin, cilantro, red pepper flakes, and lime that it would have big, bold flavor, but this was much better than I expected!  I would have liked a bit more crunch...maybe more green onion?    I can't wait for the leftovers!
Highly recommend!
Update:
I have made this 3 times now.  Personally, I actually prefer it with rotel tomatoes with chili's vs fresh grape or cherry tomatoes.  I do add about 8 green onions now instead of 5.
Finally - I wish the recipe had tablespoons of lime juice instead of "2 limes".  The first time I made it, 2 small limes were perfect.  This last two times, 2 large fresh limes gave too much juice and the flavor was a bit too acidic.  I would recommend 1 1/2 limes to start and then adjust if you think it needs more tang.

My entire family thought this was wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it all so that we would have leftovers for tomorrow but it was SO good that we ate it all. I'm definitely going to make it again and hopefully get to taste it cold!

My 14 year old son just decided he is going to be a vegetarian. I made this salad because both he and I love spicy foods. I use this salad in place of hummus.. I dip all types of chips into it and also veggies.. it's soooooooo delicious!!!!!

Delicious! Made per recipe, except no cilantro as I was out. This recipe seems like it would be very adaptable to what fresh veggies are on hand. I can see this becoming a favorite.

Solid recipe! Suggestions: a (mostly) seeded jalapeño instead of the flakes; red onion instead of green (for color!), or both; the second time I made this I sextupled the cilantro to make it more of a salad so to speak, just add a dash more salt. One thing is I love cumin, but I held back a half-teaspoon each time. Also I added a pinch of garlic powder and turmeric each cause why not.

This is a great recipe! I added some fresh cucumber, but other than that made just as recipe calls for. Very flavorful and fresh! The black beans give it that meaty texture that most cold salads don't have. I did enjoy it better as a cold salad. Will make again for sure. Thank you for the recipe! :)

Loved the dish. I omitted the red pepper flakes as my mom does not like any heat. 

6 servings? what is the serving size? Cup is too big for 6; 1/2 cup is too small to get 6 (I got 10). Thanks!

I hate to review a recipe when I've changed it, but I loved it so much I couldn't keep quiet!  We reduced the salt and cumin (half of what was called for) and left out the black pepper.  I'm sure it would still be good as written, though, I'm just super sensitive because I'm pregnant.
Added 3 diced avocados and it was one of the best meals I've eaten in weeks!

This is a great recipe that you can easily make substitutions or additions if you don't have all the ingredients.  The core of the quinoa and beans is delicious and nutricious and the lime juice balances out the heaviness of the cumin and spice.  Excellent recipe - thanks for sharing!

It is a challenge to prevent salad from becoming mushy.  Recommend adding in dressing a little at a time.  Wasn't crazy about the red pepper flakes.

I'm going to give this a 5 star recipe although eating it tasted only like a 4 star. That is because I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and decreased the salt and I think it would have been better if I used the amount called for. It was awesome and colourful and healthy! And I will make it again

This is a quick, easy light salad.  I use ReaLime instead of real limes (1/4 cup).  Glad I didn't add any more, because it would have been too much.   As it was, I added about 1 tsp of sugar to cut the flavor of the RealLime.  I also added an avocado, which gave it a nice flavor.  All in all, I would make it again, adding the avocado.

This recipe is amazing! I made it for a party and it was a hit! My modifications, I used lemon instead of lime. I only had 1 lemon so I added a 2 tsp apple cider vinegar for more acidity. I added fresh cucumbers and a can of corn. Delicious!

This was an excellent recipe, especially the dressing! Regarding the ratio of quinoa to black beans, I did not use the complete amount of quinoa that I made. Rather, I used about 1/2 to 3/4 of the quinoa made to 1 can of black beans. I also added other vegetables to the salad, including red bell pepper, spinach, and romaine lettuce.

My whole family loved this.  I served it with a big bowl of cold watermelon and they were prefect together.  Next time I think I'll try adding black olives.  I cut up a rotisserie chicken into it.  My kids inhale this.

This salad is yummy! I add chopped sun-dried (in Olive oil) tomatoes. I also always double the recipe because I tend to make it only when taking it to a pot luck. It's always a hit.

I substituted the beans with 4 ears of cooked sweet corn cut off the cob. Added a chopped avocado and some diced red onion too.  Perfect summertime salad with the fresh corn and tomatoes available!  I sautéed the small red onion in a little olive oil until soft, added the quinoa and sautéed for a few more minutes before adding the water.  Rinsing the quinoa under water before cooking  makes a difference too.

This is tasty and easy!  I added grilled chicken and cut back on the olive oil just to make it more healthy.  I'll make this again!

Not usually a fan of quinoa, but this refreshing salad is easy to make and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. May include more veggies in the future.
Prefer to eat it cold

I did make a few small changes.  Since I doubled the recipe, I decided to mix the quinoa with some bulgar so that it wasn't too sticky.  It was great!

so yummy. I did cut out half the amount of quinoa. Just prefer the vegetables. I also cut the olive oil down to 1/8 of cup.. Again, just a preference in liking the lime juice more. Kept everything else the same.

Absolutely loved this recipe. I have made it a few times and everyone raves. I added fresh corn niblets, which gave it more colour and favour.

I love this recipe!! I have made it about 5 times now and I always have people ask me for the recipe. My husband who thought he'd never enjoy eating quinoa loves this dish! I've had it both warm and cold and it is delicious both ways. The first time I made this recipe all I could taste was cumin so now when I make it I only use one teaspoon.

I doubled recipe for a party of 10 and it was a true hit. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I will definitely make this again. However, I did make the quinoa chopped with a little bit of onion prior to adding liquid to cook. So basically I sautéed a little diced onion, added the quinoa, let those fry a bit in olive oil, then added the water to cook as instructed. I find the onion gives quinoa a bit more flavor.

Made it with a little less salt than suggested. My husband and I died from the yumminess!  Easy and very tasty. Lime, chili flakes and cumin give it a great zing!

Wow, what a great recipe. So easy to make, I just modified the amount of salt since I thought it was too much. Perfect result, now this Quinoa Salad is my favorite and I am spreading the word. I like the flexibility of it, you can eat it the same day or wait the following day a no brainer. Make people smile.

I made this salad following the recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious. The only recommendation I have would be allowing the quinoa to cool completely before adding the other ingredients to keep them from being mushy.

Wow! I couldn't believe my tastebuds when I took a bite. So. Good. The only thing I'd change is put a little less salt. Otherwise, the flavors are amazing. I don't think I'll have any left over for tomorrow to find out what blended flavors will taste like :)

This was awsome!!  I used black beans but kidney beans, white beans - either would be good. No cheese so its low fat  - and the cumin dressing is good, really spicy and -yes- Zesty! Didn't change a thing.

Two teaspoons of cumin would have been too much. I added just one teaspoon and it was fine. There is a lot of quinoa relative to everything else.  Next time I will had a diced green pepper and maybe some corn.

LOVED it! The only things I added were some chopped red onion, less than 1/4 cup, about 2 Tablespoons of chopped parsley, 2 Tablespoons of dried cranberries & a just a little balsamic vinegar. I could have eaten the whole thing by myself!! My husband & I were at a party the day before I made this & had some there. It was catered, so I couldn't get the recipe. He & I liked this one much better. I'm making it again today!

I made this salad exactly as written and we really enjoyed it. It's a perfect summer salad. It does make a very large amount though, so next time the only change would be to cut it in half.

This is a superb recipe. It is very flavorful and is a great source of protein, for vegetarians such as myself. It is versatile enough to add other vegetables you may have on hand. I added peppers from garden and it was wonderful! This is definitely a keeper for me.

Made as directed (just one lime) but added shoe peg corn too. Will try cucumbers and avocado next time. Really really good and even better the next day. Thanks! (Update 7/13/16: cubed avocado, added just before serving is perfect. Love this salad!)

Very Yum.  A little salty and a little limey as is.  I cut back the lime to 1.5 small ones and it was perfect.  It would be good with corn stirred in.

I made it as is first, and then I added some garbanzo and avocado after I tasted it.  It has a nice, fresh taste.  I think the garbanzo added some much-needed texture.  My hubby commented that serving it with a slice of lightly salted avocado "made" the dish for him.  I'm just happy that my son and hubby ate something healthy without complaining :)

Fantastic and easy! I did increase the amount of uncooked quinoa to 1.5 cups. I also added chopped red and yellow peppers, chopped garlic and a chopped (seeded) cucumber.
Would definitely make again!

Very tasty! I made it just as described.  We served it with a handful of baby spinach mixed in to each bowl for dinner.  I like the burrito bowl flavors.

This is my go-to quinoa salad!! I cut the olive oil down to two Tbsp to make it a little heathier. I also added red onion instead of the green onion, and added a diced avocado. Delicious! This is my third time making this but finally reviewing it. Try this recipe- you won't be disappointed!!

Citrusy and refreshing is a perfect description for this!  It may be a bit too spicy for some, but if so just halve or omit the red pepper flakes.  I made no changes to the vinaigrette recipe, but I mixed it with 3 cups of quinoa and 2 cups of beans (cuz that's what I had leftover from another dish) and it was still very tasty.  I'll be bringing this to a neighborhood cookout tomorrow!

I have made this recipe so many times I have lost count!  It is great as written.  My whole family likes it as a healthy meatless meal, or sometimes we substitute imitation crab for the black beans.

Fabulous recipe as-is! Consider adding a 1/4 tsp or so of smoked paprika. Remember to soak the quinoa for 30 mins prior to draining and cooking. It'll cook a bit faster, and soaking removes the bitterness sometimes present in quinoa.

Perfect! Did recipe as is.  Although, I think next time I'll make a little more dressing so I can add a bunch of salad greens and a bit of chicken breast to make it a big lunch or dinner.

Our guests loved this salad. It's super easy to make and the flavors are perfectly balanced. We doubled the recipe and used it as a salad and as a "dip" for chips too. I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

I've made this at least 10 times.  It is delicious!  Everyone likes it.  I have varied the recipe several times, using avocado and chicken, or feta and black olives.   Very versatile for whatever you want to do with it! One of my favourite salads.  High in protein too.

I made this recipe and enjoyed it however, I needed to make a second batch of dressing for there just wasn't enough in the original measurements. I also added a little extra red wine vinegar and a touch of sugar to balance some of the line acidity. It's a light healthy salad that I will make again.

The salad I changed based on what  had. Didn't have tomatoes,  but diced up red bell peppers & also added a 16oz bag of thawed frozen corn.

I wasn't sure about some other ingredients, like the cumin, but in the end I followed the recipe and it turned out fantastic! I make it every couple weeks now for school lunches, and it tastes better the second day. I steamed my quinoa instead of boiling it, and that doesn't seem to make a difference.

Tastes really good!  I didn't have green onions so I used red onion.  Also used regular tomatoes due to lack of cherry tomatoes.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this recipes as written and agree with some of the other reviewers that the lime juice was overwhelming.  I added about a tablespoon of  balsamic infused honey that I had in the pantry to see if that would balance the flavors.  It was an improvement, but the salad was still rather sharp.  I think this would be a nice accompanying dish with a rich, creamy dish...I'm thinking cheesy enchiladas.  I like the idea of the recipe and will continue playing with flavors until it suits my taste.

I will definitely make it again.  It's delicious.  I may reduce the olive oil a bit just for the sake of calories.  It is really high in calories, but waaay high in deliciousness.

This salad was very refreshing but needed a lot of adjustments. I wouldn't recommend putting that much cilantro in it. Cilantro has a very powerful flavor and its not for every palate. When making this dish you want to make sure to taste it as you add citrus because too much turns it into a sour mess.  I preferred it cold. The black beans made this dish better so I added 2 cans.

I'll certainly be making this one again!  I added more chopped cilantro but other than that made the recipe exactly according to the directions.  This is the very best quinoa salad I've ever tried.

This is a great treat. Quinoa has been new to us but we are finding wonderful recipes like this one that brings quinoa into our regular eating schedule. We did depart a little from the purist basic plan. I added three leftover grilled chicken breasts to the mix, and only used one teaspoon of cumin. As we ate we thought about adding peanuts and shredded mozzarella cheese. We did it and loved it. Next time we'll probably add a diced avocado just for fun. A real treat that you will enjoy.

Added 3 handfuls of fresh spinach, and sliced black olives. We also wanted a little more flavor, so added 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar.

Wonderful, easy, and healthy salad!  This is good ANY time of the year!  I didn't have limes so used lemons, so next time I'll be sure to use limes, which I think will make it even tastier!

Living in France, it can be hard to get hold of fresh herbs, even in organic supermarkets. I ended up replacing the coriander / cilantro with alfalfa, which worked really well !

Very good! I actually roasted the tomatoes to make them more tolerable to everyone who'd be enjoying the dish. After cooking I chilled the tomatoes and it turned out very well.

This is great as is, but it's easy to throw in extras like avocado, corn (things you'd add to a taco salad), chickpeas, etc. A note for first time users: the dressing tastes bitter all by itself. Don't worry! It blends in perfectly.

My version was not great, but it was good. I cut the amount of olive oil in half, as well as the salt. It was very tangy. Maybe too tangy. It certainly tasted better the next day. I would recommend trying something else before making this again, but I would not be opposed to trying this again. It was very easy to make.

Delicious! I followed the recipe (with the exception of substituting cayenne for red pepper flakes) & loved the flavor of the dressing.  I did cook the quino al dente & added a can of corn for color.  Served this at a gathering & everyone loved it.

Was looking for a recipe where we could use up some of our homegrown tomatoes. Halved the salt and cumin. Did not have green onion or cilantro - just used red onion. We both liked this change of pace type of side dish. Next time, will reduce the oil as well. Definitely worth a try. Easily modified to suit your own particular tastes.

LOVE IT! I did make some changes though since I love food that tantalizes my taste buds. I subbed black beans for organic spicy cooked black beans and skipped the onions (made this to take to school for lunch-- can't risk having onion breath). For everything else, I followed the recipe to the T and it came out really amazing! This is now a part of my monthly ritual for lunch. The portions were more than enough to last me 4 weekdays of lunch. I like to alternate our my lunch every week but this is now a permanent part of my foods to take to school for lunch.

Very nice fresh salad; the secret is in the sauce, amazing as a side salad since the ingredients are limited.

Quick, easy, healthy & filling so Overall this a great recipe. I have made it a few times to have prepared as weekday lunches because it lasts a few days in the fridge.  Also made it without the green onions and cilantro due to laziness of not wanting to go to the grocery store... And it's good without as well.

Best recipe for a healthy and protein packed meal.  I added avocado on top when I brought it to a family picnic.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Made this a couple of times now & I've changed the red pepper flakes to double out of preference.  There are other quinoa salads that are similar that I've printed also so don't know which one I'll keep.  It is very feeling.

I loved it! I also only used 1 tsp. cumin and 1 lime... and added extra quinoa. It was perfect and very tasty. If i can find enough recipes like this, I think I can easily become a vegetarian!

I have made this recipe multiple times & everyone LOVES it! I have swapped red onion for the green onion & I like it that way too. This is a winner to bring to pot lucks & cookouts because it doesn't need to be kept warm or cold.

This is a wonderful recipe. I added cucumbers, a can of chopped green chiles, and sliced black olives. I have made this several times. I have added fresh cut corn.  We prefer it without the corn though. I omit the salt altogether. It has plenty of flavor with all the spices. This is our favorite summer dish.

Recipe is good. I did 1 lime because of what I read in the reviews and it came out good. Hint of flavor but not over powering. I added extra cumin, salt and red pepper flakes but I'm don't really get any hint of heat. Which is okay. I added extra cilantro. A little too extra about 3/4 to 1 cup of cilantro. next time I make this I'll add a little less cilantro like what the recipe calls for or about 1/2 cup.

I cooked the quinoa (after rinsing with water) with chicken stock as directed on another recipe that I love (Best Greek Quinoa Salad). I had some left over quinoa from this other recipe, so I followed this recipe as directed. I like the heat of the red pepper flakes and cumin with the lime juice. Next time I make this I think I will add some avocado chunks and some Mexican soft cheese like Queso or Cotija to the recipe.

This is a great base recipe but I like a bit ore flavor so I had to zest it up.  As written it was still good though.

Just now made it and and am letting it sit in the frig, but I did taste a little and it was delicious. I doubled the quinoa. I put a little too much salt in it, but that was my own fault. I added sweet red pepper for more veggies. Yummy!! Thank you for the recipe.

I make this but I add a chopped jalapeño pepper, chopped red onion and a chopped green pepper with the can of rinsed black beans.  My kids love it. They like it as a dip for chips. I love it as a salad.

Wow! Oh, so good! I tried some of the recommended variations and liked the cucumber, avocado and red bell pepper. I will increase the quinoa next time, maybe because of all those extras.

Wonderful dish!  My husband ate 1/2 the bowl before dinner was served!
For me I would use 1/2 the cumin.  I will be making this again very soon!

This is the best quinoa recipe I have ever tried.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I don't even like quinoa at all, however I love this salad.  My husband almost ate all of it before I made it to the table...lol  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!

Yum!  SO GOOD!  I had a hard time stopping after seconds!  We cut the olive oil a bit, did a heaping cup of quinoa, sort of toasted quinoa a bit first, cooked quinoa in veggie broth, added a diced avocado, diced and sauteed a chicken breast, then added that, added half a yellow bell pepper, and a bit of cucumber.  Ate at room temp, but warm or cold would probably be best.  So fresh and healthy tasting!!!

I followed recipe to the tee and the salad was delicious. No need for additional salt; just fresh cracked pepper. I'll be making this one again! I concur with the 5-star rating.

I found this recipe for my vegetarian daughter, but my whole family loves it! I've taken it to many family dinners and potlucks and still get requests for the recipe. I slightly altered the recipe, as others did, by using only use one teaspoon of cumin and substituting vegetable broth for the water. This recipe is one of my AR favorites!

Made this last week, made no changes.  It is all gone and even my husband liked it.  He is really picky.  Will make it again!

Loved it. Enjoyed it as is and also served it on a bed of lettuce. I agree with another post that you could probably use a little less  oil- I didn't use the entire dressing either, but overall flavor & texture was wonderful.

Thanks, I enjoyed the lime, oil, cumin, and pepper flake dressing. I added some chopped red bell, carrot, purple cabbage, and cucumber. Added some sunflower seeds and almonds. Also put in some fresh basil.  Then topped with some avocado.

Hmm!!!! This recipe was very easy, and SO delicious! Honestly the first quinoa salad I've enjoyed in quite a while! I think two limes was a little too acidic for me as it slightly overpowered the other flavours, but its still really, really good! I also cut down on the cilantro because I personally am not a cilantro fun! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

I have made this twice. The first time it was good but I think I left out the salt. The second time I made a double batch and added the salt as directed and it was WAY to salty!   I love the lime and cilantro flavour but next time I will decrease the salt. Otherwise worth making!

I've made this salad a few times, just with leftover quinoa.  I've added canned hominy or blackeyed peas or the black beans.  I use Key Lime from the bottle and 1/2 the salt.  This is a surprising treat of a salad!

I have made this salad twice now, with slightly different veggies each time, and it is fantastic!  I have made this with plain quinoa plus red peppers and carrots and then I made it with red quinoa, a bit of couscous and carrots and I have to say it tasted delicious both ways. My money's with the dressing; it must be the dressing. Absolutely wonderful salad to eat right away and after a couple of days. My 13 yr old daughter loves it!

I made this salad, it was quick and easy.. I didnt have cilantro so i left that out and added red bell peppers. I left out the cumin because i dont like it. I cut back on the oil as well. As far as taste it was ok, i felt it was missing something or maybe it's the brand of quinoa i used. I gave it 4 stars not bad but not the best.

I really loved this salad, and I made it for a Christmas luncheon, so it works for summer AND winter! The ladies at the luncheon loved it and asked for the recipe. I should have made it the night before--I think it would have brought out the flavors more, but it was still excellent. Also, the serving size said 6, but honestly, it serves WAY more!

I am a little obsessed with this salad. Instead of straight quinoa, I use a mix of quinoa, basmati and wild rice. I made it for the 2 guys who were painting my house and they licked the bowl clean. I double the recipe now whenever I make it.

This is delicious! I used half the cumin (personal preference) and I didn't salt the dressing mixture because I salted and peppered the quinoa when I cooked it. I'm excited to bring this to a cookout tomorrow.

I made this today as written except I had to use dried spices instead of fresh and it was fabulous! I imagine the flavors will be even more enmeshed and zesty tomorrow.

This recipe is a definite keeper!  I might reduce the salt a bit next time though.  I added a diced avocado and it was fantastic!

It needed a bit more heat for me so I grabbed home grown jalapeno and chopped up fine (no seeds but most of the membrane).  Also did not have cherry tomatoes but have plenty of home grown slicing tomatoes, so plan to add chopped tomato an hour or so before serving.

This salad is delicious!! Unfortunately I didn't have any fresh limes or lime juice on hand so I had to substitute lemon juice. It worked well, but next time I will definitely use fresh limes. I also had a mango that I needed to use so decided to throw it into the mix.  Glad I did; it added a bit of sweetness. Thanks for sharing. I will be making this again??

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I put chickpeas instead of black beans, red onion instead of spring onion, and added red cabbage because that's what I had on hand. But the dressing- my god the dressing! It's amazing. It's my new favorite salad dressing. It would be good with just about any veggies you want to add! Fantastic!

I use half rice/half quinoa and add more cumin and hot peppers.  I also add a cup of frozen corn. This is one of my favorite dishes to share at gatherings of all kinds.

This one is a major winner! First time making it, brought to a BBQ, and got repeated praises for it all night. The bowl was practically scraped clean. 
Made a couple minor tweaks - used half a small red onion instead of green onions, added 3 ears of grilled corn and an avocado. Also toasted the quinoa first, then cooked in chicken broth. 
End result - Deeeelicious!

So I made this a few times.  I thought it was ok but I made it cause it was healthy.  But then I took someone's suggestion and cut the cumin and half and tried it warm, and it was amazing.  I Love it now and will make it often.

Very good basic salad. Excellent with some additions. First time I made it I followed the recipe pretty closely except I didn't add cilantro because I'm not fond of it. Second time I made it, I added a couple of cloves of garlic, minced jalapeño pepper,  more onion, about a cup of fresh corn, and chopped an avocado, gave it a good coating of lime juice and added it to the rest.  Now that's a salad!

So delicious and so easy! I added some cayenne for an extra kick as well as half of a diced mango for a sweet, fresh kick. I topped my leftovers with avocado slices and it was even better! Truly yummy and healthy.

The perfect balance of citrus, oil, and seasoning made this dish POP! I had kidney beans on hand and used those instead of the black beans. Otherwise, I followed the recipe completely and we absolutely loved it. This will be a new summer staple for my family and I.

Loved this recipe, no prob with the amount of line, oil or salt. I added one chopped mango, a handful of chopped whole almonds for some crunch and used about 10 fresh grape tomatoes sliced in half. Fantastic.

I can never get my boyfriend to try new things but we tried this and he loved it. Personally, I think it was missing roasted corn but it was delicious. I also cooked the quinoa in low sodium chicken broth instead of water.

Delicious!  I had to make some changes based on what was available (red onion for green, cayenne pepper for pepper flakes).  The dressing was quite tart so to balance the flavors I added fresh corn from 4 cobbs...uncooked.  This was a great addition and helped to stretch the salad so we could enjoy left overs the next day.  Even more delicious on day 2!  Thanks for sharing!

Great combination of flavors- works very well together.  First time making it, I brought it to work for lunch (with plenty to share). Everyone loved it!  Recipe is outstanding as is, but some of the variations mentioned above sound good too!

This recipe is great! I pretty much followed the recipe, but had to change a few things based in what I had on hand. I used red onion instead of green and used chick peas and white kidney beans when doubling. I also added green pepper and chopped kale. Good on its own, or with chicken and avocados :)

I have to share this recipe every time I share this salad with anyone.  I really like the combination of flavors: cilantro, red pepper flakes, lime !   I always only do 1 teaspoon of cumin and I do a heaping teaspoon of red pepper flakes (I like the spice).  I also prefer this salad with the black and white quinoa mix cooked in beef broth.

Delicious taste! I left out the oil completely and used mung beans instead of black beans (in my opinion, mung beans are the BEST for quinoa salad!). I added cucumber because I had some in the fridge! Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful!!!  I did make a few changes because I thought it could use some extra veggies and crunch.  Added seedless cucumber, diced red pepper and purple onion instead of green onion.   I only used 1 tsp cumin because my husband isn't crazy about it, but I think I would love it with 2 tsp.  so yummy and refreshing!!

Thought this was pretty tasty and simple. Perfect for a weeknight dinner and makes for a great lunch tomorrow. I used tricolour quinoa (because I had some), reduced the salt and oil by a bit and added more cilantro. Next time I'll add roasted corn.

I have tried it and loved it, after reading the reviews, I adjusted the salt to 1/2 tsp. and the cumin to 1 tsp. ( I used roasted ground cumin) I was short of 1 lime so I added the juice of a tangerine instead, what a delicious difference! I steamed my quinoa in Rotisserie chicken stock, it was very delicious, have made this recipe three times since I saw it about 6 weeks ago.  I also added a teaspoon of chopped, seeded jalapeno.

Tastes just as great warm or cold! Here are my changes: 
* Reduced cumin to 1 tsp (but ended up shaking a bit more for my own individual plate) 
* Added edamame and sweet corn (AWESOME! 10/10 would recommend. It adds another texture and flavor to the bite.) 
* Extra tomatoes
* Had to substitute lemons for limes since I didn't have any.

Next time I want to try adding chick peas!

This was great. I added jicama, corn, feta, red onion (insetad of green), lettuce, and used regular and red quinoa. Added Trader Joe's orange muscat champagne vinegar and sriracha to the vinaigrette. Next time I'll add avocado and champagne mangoes too!

I just made this for the first time.  I'm not a big fan of either cumin or cilantro--er, I should say I WASN'T a big fan because this recipe definitely changed my mind.  OMG, it is so good.  I added a half chopped red pepper just because I had one sitting around.  This is one of those recipes that will be made again.  Plus its so pretty with the variety of colors.  Per other comments, I cut down on the salt by about 1/2.  After the dish was assembled I tasted again and it did not need any extra salt.  I used the juice of two limes, but they were small.

This is one of my very favorite salads and is pretty much amazing "as is". Although, I added mint, deleted the onions, used Grape tomatoes, added Feta cheese and instead of limes - used lemons in the dressing.  Everyone RAVES when I bring this salad anywhere and everyone always wants the recipe. It is SO SO easy to make too!! Thanks for sharing!

Served this at a family gathering today and everyone loved it!  I read several reviews and combined some suggestions.  I would definitely make this the night before to let the seasonings blend.  I cut the sesame seed oil to one tablespoon as recommended.  You can taste a hint of it, but it was not overpowering.  I forgot to add black beans, but added edamame and flash boiled and chilled asparagus.  I did not use green onion and substituted for red onion. Other additions were craisins and celery for crunch. I made the salad to sit overnight then the next morning before serving, I added the cumin and cilantro.  I was not a fan of quinoa before, but made it for friends who are vegan.  Very delicious, will definitely make again!

Loved this dish! We used garbanzo beans in place of black beans because it was what we had on hand. We put in on a bed of lettuce with some grilled chicken breast, added a small amount of salad dressing and found it delightful!

Ration of liquid seemed better at 1 3/4 cup water to Quinoa. I used chicken broth but it would be great either way. Wow: even healthy for you.

Great and very easy to make.  I would slowly add the cumin and salt to make sure it is to your liking - some like it salty - I personally like it a little less salty.  But a very easy and delicious salad.

I've made this twice for my husband and me. We used it as the focus of the meal. As someone else suggested, I added a cup of (cooked) frozen corn. Otherwise I changed nothing. We love the spiciness, and we're going to share this at potluck events. No dairy, no gluten, no nuts, no soy!

A little dry, so I might make a bit more dressing next time, but overall super delicious! I left out the tomatoes and it was still a great salad. Perfect for a picnic or buffet.

I've been making this salad for a year and every time we have a family get together I'm asked to bring it.  I add a chopped avocado & a chopped mango.  Perfection.

I added grilled corn to mine. It was delicious but next time will reduce the cumin as others have suggested. What a delicious healthy dish! I will add it to the summer rotation.

A great introduction to quinoa, the first recipe I ever made with it included and one I'll be making again. Lends itself really well to grilled chicken breast or on its own.

Wow, this was really good.  I used white beans instead of black, because that's all I had and I didn't add any onions. Boyfriend doesn't like onion, but it was good without it.  I used about 3/4 of the salt and cumin that the recipe called for.  I love the lime and fresh cilantro.  I did use two limes, although they were fairly small limes.

i was completely underwhelmed.  i, like others, cut the olive oil by half, but followed except lemon-lime combo and garbanzos instead. found it to be surprisingly tasteless...even with the cumin, one of my fave spices.  i ended up adding diced red pepper and cucumber and a glug of champagne vinegar. and slivered almonds.  THEN it was delicious.

Made this last night. Added some edamame & feta that I had on hand, otherwise made as per recipe. Delicious, looking forward to leftovers for lunch today! Thanks Scrumdiddly for sharing a healthy side salad I will definitely make again.

First try with quinoa and it's terrific.  I added some frozen edamame and served the dish really cold. Doubled the cumin. I eat this nearly twice a week for lunch.  Super flavor.Low cholesterol. Big protein. Bigger flavor.

This is now my absolute favorite Quinoa recipe now!  It was super easy to make and the flavors are spectacular.  The only thing I added was some garlic powder.  Next time I make this I am going to mince some fresh garlic and either add to the vinaigrette or to the Quinoa while it cooks.

This is so full of flavor - it's just as zesty as advertised. I used 1-1/3 cup of water to 2/3 cup of quinoa so the grain wouldn't overwhelm the other great flavors. It was just right, for my taste. Highly recommend this refreshing salad!!

This was my first ever recipe using Quinoa.  I have just recently made a lifestyle change, and am eating healthier.  This was fabulous.
The flavors are amazing.  Made it, but added chicken, took it to work for a few other girls, and we have decided this is now our healthier alternative to Chipotle!

This is a really excellent quinoa recipe. The lime and pepper flakes between them add enough zing to counter the natural bitterness that can sometimes turn people off quinoa. The salt called for is way too much for me; I suggest you salt to your own taste. 

I had to sub out the tomatoes because of an allergy in the family, and found that frozen sweet corn kernels fit in nicely. My 7-year-old (the one with the allergy) helped make the dressing and pronounced it "the best quinoa salad ever!" I think this will become a lunch-box staple!

I always add more cilantro than called for, but ended up adding a little less tomato because I didn't buy enough. Also I used regular tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes to save on costs.  It turned out well and makes for a quick and easy snack because you don't have to heat it up.

I totally agree with dandan14.. I've made this twice almost forgot the second time that the 2 limes were to much.. I would Definitely recommend salting to taste also! I put a little more cumin and cilantro, but I also love spicy food. Happy healthy eating! :)

Made this for a birthday potluck at work. The Boulder "hippy" crowd loved it!  Everyone at least liked it - even those who never tasted Quinoa before! The 'girls' asked me to leave the leftovers in the fridge for the next day.  I did and we all feasted on it.  I took home an empty tupperware container so it was completely gone!

Will make this again for sure. Didn't change a thing either.

This is delicious!  My husband and I love quinoa, and we try to eat meatless at least once a week.  Since the protein is complete in this dish, we didn't need to add anything, but we did serve slices of avocado with it.

This is a quick and delish recipe that stores for 3-4 days in an airtight container, in the refrigerator. It is a great GF quick meal to have on hand when you're not in in the mood to cook. The kids loved it too!

I just want to say that this was SUPER delicious! My son hates quinoa and when he first saw that I made this he immediately started whining!!! I insisted that he try it...he loved it!! Success!! He even took some for lunch the next day...now that's a win win! I can't wait to make it again! 

~picture is before I added quinoa...

Finally a quinoa recipe with flavor!  Easy to make too.  I used half the salt, half the lime, 1/3 less oil, canned diced tomatoes, substituted paprika for red pepper flakes, mexican corn blend, and garbanzo beans.

I loved this recipe but did make a couple of changes. I only used the juice of half of a lime and then added a 100 calorie packet of guacamole to the dressing. I also added in a few teaspoons of diced red onion and crumbled some queso fresco over the too.

LOVED it as is!  But the 2nd time I made it I added 1 red pepper and to the dressing I added 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar.  I also added 4 C grape tomatoes to make it extra healthy.  I LOVE cilantro so I also put in the ENTIRE bunch of cilantro.  Other than that...followed it exactly.

This is my favorite quinoa salad recipe, I make it often and have passed it along to many others. I have changed it slightly be adding a cup of frozen corn and a teaspoon of chili powder.

Great recipe!!! One note: wayyy too much lime. Maybe my limes were extra juicy but I just used one and it was too acidic. Other than that..delicious! I also substituted black beans for chick peas.

I love this recipe!  At the suggestion of another, I lowered the cumin in the dressing because it seemed like a lot.  Next time, I will add more.  Should have trusted original recipe!  Delicious!!

This was excellent!! I wanted to use up my cilantro and found this recipe. I had quinoa once before and didn't like it but liked the sounds of this dressing so I gave it a whirl. I used a 'southwest veggie' frozen mix that had black bean, corn, onion, and bell peppers because I didn't have the tomatoes or green onion. I also used lemon juice because I didn't have any limes. Despite my substitutes this was still amazing! I used kosher salt as well which I sub for most salt in cooking because I think it tastes better. I can't wait for the opportunity to make it for a friends dinner or healthy potluck side. Gotta share the deliciousness!

This is great. Feel free to add other vegetables. We like it with garbanzo beans and cucumber.  Be careful - it was too salty for us as written.  Delicious and healthy!

I've been trying a lot of quinoa recipes for my family, and this is their favorite.  I'm a fan of cilantro, so I put a couple of teaspoons of fresh chopped cilantro in the salad the last time I made it.  We love this fresh, but it just gets better after a day or so in the fridge.

Delicious!  I used 4tbsp of lime juice since I didn't have any fresh limes and only used one tsp of cumin as per another reviewer.  I did not find it overly salty at all.  I also prefer it warm.

The only ingredient that I didn't have was fresh cilantro so I used about a tsp. of dried and it was fabulous! I bet it's even better with the fresh cilantro. Served this with walleye and a salad. I saved a little bit of the dressing for my salad. I may even start making it as a salad dressing it was so good. Thanks for the recipe.

Everybody I make this for loves it! The flavors are so refreshing,and this has become a regular dish since everyone's trying to cut out carbs. I just didn't add as much of the cumin and red pepper flakes for my non-spicy girls.Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have tomatoes, but I used everthying except the dressing and I added red bell peppers, cucumbers and corn.  For my dressing I used 2 tablespoons of Newman's Own Lite Lime Salad Dressing. It was the bomb!!! Thank you for your delightful recipe!!!

This was my first time cooking quinoa, so I was unfamiliar with it. On the package, it said to rinse the quinoa before cooking, I had a little difficulty as they were so small. I don't know if there is any easier way to do this. I used red quinoa, upped the amount to 1.25 cups/ 2cups of liquid. I substituted chicken broth. I did toast the quinoa in olive oil and garlic before adding the broth. It took longer than 15 minutes for all the liquid to be gone. I also roasted two ears of corn, and added corn at the end with the beans. For the dressing, I used a little less cumin and used one lime instead of two. I also didn't half the cherry tomatoes, as what I had were small anyway. I felt the prep was more work than indicated, but....IT WAS DELICIOUS! Great recipe. Hopefully, it won't take so long next time as I'll know what I'm doing.

Excellent!  Cooked the quinoa in a rice cooker and turned out perfect. Bringing it an event tonight. Will definitely be making this again!

Loved it! I couldn't find any black beans here in Australia so I had to settle for kidney beans. Still good, though! The cumin and lemon dressing combined with the cilantro was a delicious flavour. I also added cucumber as I had seen in another comment. Great idea!

This was a great salad. I made it when some friends asked me to bring a salad to dinner. All three of them said they liked it a lot. I made it exactly as written, but using just the 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I'd never cooked quinoa before, but I found it in my store, and it was a nice way to try it for the first time. I had a little left over the next day, and it was just as good. This is well worth making again.

I really liked this recipe! I made it for a pot luck and every one loved it! I found it delicious, although I did make some additions/changes to the recipe.
I was out of red pepper flakes, so I neglected to add those. I also added green peppers and cucumbers, and substituted the cilantro for fresh basil. (it grows in our garden) I also added a little lemon juice to the dressing. Very happy with how it turned out!

Amazingly delicious! I followed some recommendations by other reviewers and used 1 1/4 cup quinoa for a dryer outcome. I also added diced avocado before I served it. Everyone loved it!

Easy and a good combination of flavors.  Did think it was a touch too salty.  Hence, 4 stars instead of 5.  But otherwise, happy with it.

Delicious! Made a couple changes-Kidney beans instead of black beans, lemon instead of lime and black pepper instead of red pepper flakes. This would also be great with celery, peas, bell pepper, etc...

I make this monthly thinking of taking it to work for the week, only problem is it's usually gone by Monday!  I half the salt since we are not big on salt and will try halving the EVOO to lessen the fat & calories.  I also add a splash of apple cider vinegar because it seemed that it was missing a little something.  A go to dish in my recipe box!

So good!  I used more red pepper flakes, add some chopped fresh jalapeño pepper (yes we like spice) and grapeseed oil instead of olive.  

Also....this makes AWESOME wraps!  Whole family loves these for hiking or school lunches.  I just add some crumbly cheese...like feta or Mexican Queso Fresco, and sprinkle w/lots of pepper...super tasty!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

We love love love it!!! Everytime I cook it for our friends/family they ask for the recipe!!
I do add chicken and  avocado and sometimes leave the beans out, switch it up a little. Or put everything in it and you have a complete filling entree. I cook the quinoa in stock instead of water and don't add any salt. You can play with it, it's delicious, easy and perfect! One of my favorites of this moment!!

This was really excellent.  I don't like salad dressing and I found the seasoning on this to be in perfect compliment with the rest of the flavors.  I made the reciped as stated but added corn and used roma tomatoes as I don't care for cherry and a sprinkle of feta on top.  

I reccommend chilling it for at least half an hour before serving.  My boyfriend loved this and ate the rest for lunch the next day.  Thank you for an excellent recipe!

Nice recipe! I used only half of the olive oil and added 1 avocado. I may reduce the lime juice in half next time, although it is not bad as is.

This is a fabulous recipe that has become a staple on our family's menu.  

I do have to be cautious of the amount of lime, reducing a bit (1/2 - 1 lime) for our more sensitive members.  I also add other veggies when available, including cukes, black olives, sweet peppers, etc, as well as garbonzo beans.  And I usually replace the cherry tomatoes with diced organic plum tomatoes due to price and availability.  

I make a triple batch of this once a week during the summer, and I run out.  Highly recommended.

I am normally a mess in the kitchen, but not even I could mess this one up. It was easy to make and really good. I cut back on the lime just a little bit - used 1.5 limes instead of 2 - and it seemed to come out just right. Everybody who tried it loved it and came back for seconds (even thirds!). This is a keeper. Great for potlucks.

This recipe is great! I only made 2 adjustments. I used 1 tablespoon of cumin instead of two and I used Roma tomatoes instead of cherry because I am not a fan of cherry tomatoes. If you want it to be a cold salad I suggest making the quinoa ahead of time so it has time to cool and you can serve it immediately. I love love love this salad!

Awesome... no changes made although I may try to add some raw yellow or orange pepper to change things up.

I made this for dinner yesterday and did not change a thing.  This was the BEST quinoa I have ever tasted!  My family loved it, even my husband and he doesn't normally do healthy.  Definitely in my recipe collection and will be made often.

We loved this! My substitution was a jar of roasted red peppers in water, drained, instead of tomatoes; and chopped fresh basil instead of cilantro. Excellent.

Everyone loved this salad!  I used less cherry tomatoes and they were the yellow kind. (sorry, i'm not really a pro yet. not sure of what the yellow ones are called.)  The zesty sauce is absolutely delicious. My favorite part about this salad is that it is without gluten and dairy. My body really likes it. :)  
I like the idea of adding avocado.  I'm making it for the second time today and I will probably add avocado to each serving.

My husband and I decided to go vegan about 3 weeks ago to get healthy. I've never had quinoa before, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. We absolutely love this salad! Super yummy!

Really enjoyed this! I'd never cooked quinoa before so while looking for a recipe, found a different method of cooking that is supposedly better for salads because it dries out the quinoa a bit. I added the quinoa to boiling, salted water; then drained in a sieve and rinsed with cold water. Then I set the sieve over an inch of boiling water and covered with a clean dishcloth and lid for 10 minutes. Let cool before adding to veggies. I added 1/2 tsp salt and 2 T of Miracle Whip to dressing which gave it a nice zing. I omitted the red pepper flakes and added chopped red pepper and corn. I also omitted the green onion.

Love this.  Have made it twice and it does not last. I added avocado to this current batch and a little salsa that I had leftover.  This is a great salad to use "the fridge" in.

Loved this! And my family loved it! I am not a vegetarian or a vegan, but I could eat this almost everyday!!! No changes to the recipe, except for the red pepper flakes; I didn't have any. A perfect recipe and so good for you! A winner!

It's pretty good, but seems to need something, perhaps garlic.  If I make it again I may add a 1/2 tsp sugar to try to bring out the flavors.  Took it to a potluck and only had one positive comment.

This was ok, but I did not love it. I used just over half of the cumin called for and it was still just an overpowering taste.  I probably won't make this one again.

I liked this a lot. I followed some of the alterations for this (half the salt to start, and then the rest to taste; 1/8 cp of olive oil rather than 1/4 cp; 1 lime since they were on the large size; 1 tsp of cumin to start, the rest to taste) and thought it was pretty good. It was really quick to put together. If I were to make any alterations, I'd probably add at least one avocado - bet that'd be tasty - and maybe do half garbanzo beans rather than a full can of black beans. I might also consider adding corn. Anyway, it's a pretty versatile recipe, and leaves a lot of room for personal preference.

This is a great quinoa side dish!  I did however substitute 3/4 cup of diced sun dried tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes.  Made it for some family who came into town who know food and they loved it!  Made our BBQ dinner a huge success!!

We loved this!  It was easy and delicious!   I did make one small change; substituted one seeded serrano pepper finely chopped for the red pepper flakes, even my teenager who doesn't like quinoa or black beans said it was "pretty good".  The rest of us adored it - it didn't last long, and this recipe is going to see a lot of use this summer!

This is a nice main dish salad with a bit of zip.  I omitted salt and used cooked dried beans instead of canned to reduce sodium.  I reduced ground cumin as a matter of personal preference.  I enjoyed the salad but found it quite a bit too oily for my taste, so I will adjust that next time.  Will make again, thanks!

Decided to try quinoa for the first time and picked this recipe to start with. It was excellent!! I didn't have green onions so I left them out but I'm sure I would have liked it just as much. Ate it as a side dish the first night and then for lunch as tortilla filling for the next three days with plenty left over.

I like to keep this salad in my fridge for healthy snacking.  Have made it as shown with added English cucumber, tiny sliced radishes and a shake of Oregano and have also made it with lemon juice, a little honey, a pressed garlic clove, oregano, celery, radishes, yellow pepper.  I think this is one of those great recipes that you can vary with the veggies and citrus you have on hand.  I like the crunch of the veggies.  Hubby loves it, too!  I wish I could add my photo but it says it is too small.  It looks beautiful!  I will take it to my next family get-together (I am known for my great salad dishes).

Totally delicious! I used garbanzo beans instead of black beans and it worked great!

I have tried quinoa in other recipes and didn't care for it.  I had only a scant 1/4 cup left over so I cooked it with some chicken broth until al dente.  I compensated by cooking some short grain brown rice also in chicken broth.  I followed the recipe to the letter other than that except for not measuring the cilantro.  I will be making this again!

Very good. I added less onions and cumin that it called for and squeezed a lemon in addition to the limes. Would use less oil next time. Great to make ahead of time and take cold for lunch rest of the week.

This is incredible. So delicious - wonderful taste combination! I already had some warm...but I think it will be good cold also. Oh - I lowered the salt a bit in the dressing and didn't add extra salt later - that seemed to make it a good flavor for me.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't have any beans on hand so I just omitted them, and since I had some shredded chicken on hand I added it in.  The bf didn't care for the cumin (didn't bother me) so I'll just reduce the amount next time.  Great recipe for someone making quinoa for the first time!
