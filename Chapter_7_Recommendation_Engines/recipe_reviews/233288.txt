This is a very creamy and yummy soup! It makes a ton so I froze at least half of it. I was amazed that I got 3 cups of turkey off of the carcass which I thought I had pretty well picked over. I put the carcass in a crockpot and slow cooked it all night. Make sure you add at least 12 cups of water if you want to get this many servings. I followed the recipe except I didn't have any stuffing to put it. Hubby thought it needed more zip so I added a T of Santa Fe Blend & about a half C of onion & garlic croutons.  I also upped the amount of fettucine to 8 oz. as we like lots of noodles. I broke the sticks of fettucine into 4ths, but next time I'll break them into smaller pieces as they'll be easier to eat.  Yummmmm!

Absolutely wonderful!!!!!  Nice thick, creamy, hearty soup!  Add some crusty bread, maybe a small salad - you've got a full meal!  My 92-year-old Dad said he doesn't remember enjoying a soup so much!  I WILL be making this again!!!!!

The 'Creamy After-Thanksgiving Turkey Soup' came out wonderfully with a few changes.  The biggest change was adding barley for thickening, taste and health.   Great!

My go to recipe! I make this with the boiled chicken recipe as well all the time. I only use half the flour. I only use salt, pepper & garlic salt. I also added a bay leaf for additional flavor. Occasionly I add cooked rice instead of pasta. Alternatively I have used heavy cream to make it thicker as I use it as a base for pot pies, putting a biscuit on top. I recommend cutting the veggies nice & big. I also add cut mushrooms just cause I love a fungi! Hee Hee!

Holy Cow, this is one of the best tasting soup I have ever made!!!  The only change that I made is that I added a Tbs of minced garlic and used 6C of chicken broth along with the stock I made from my carcass.  Give this a shot - you won't be sorry!!  thanks for the fantastic recipe!

This was a total hit with the entire family!  A few got a touch of the flu after thanksgiving so I prepared this soup and made everyone feel just a little bit better.  The leftover stuffing really added some great flavors!

This is the best soup ever, I made it last year and I'm back for it this year.  I made as is even though I was skeptical about the stuffing, and the fettuccini parts, but believe me both added a lot to the recipe.

This turned out extremely well, with plenty of opportunity to adjust flavors to your taste. The only reason I substituted was to accommodate the leftovers I had. I had made a slow cook turkey stock the day before, which was thick when it cooled, so I used 8 cups of that with 4 cups of water with the broth. I also used leftover gravy (about 1/2 cup) instead of the poultry seasoning and salt (my stock was already seasoned and flavored, too), I also used more like a cup of the leftover stuffing / dressing. Lastly, I used fat free half and half, because I can never tell the difference. And I added a bag of frozen peas as others had suggested.

This was delicious! I was sceptical but decided to try it anyway. I substituted evaporated milk for the half and half because it was what I had on hand, and threw in the rest of the stuffing and mashed potatoes at the end and heated it through. I didn't add turkey. I will definitely make this again.

Deglazed roasting pan with medium dry sherry before straining and adding to turkey stock, tripled the amount of carrots and celery and included leek with veggies.   No bouillon or poultry seasoning since turkey had been roasted with a dry brine that included many species and turkey carcass boiled with soup greens.   Added three quarters cup stuffing instead of 1/4 cup...because...stuffing.   Prior to adding half and half, turkey, stuffing and fettuccini, used a stick blender to emulsify the veggies.   Absolutely fabulous flavor!!!!!!    Fantastic recipe.  Thank you.

I subbed 1/2 cup of cornstarch for the cup of flour, omitted the stuffing, and used gluten free corn pasta shells  instead of regular linguine to make this gluten free. I also cut the salt in half and used 1 cup milk instead of 2 cups half n half to reduce sodium and fat. It was still delicious!

My husband says this recipe was a home run with bases loaded. The only things I changed was adding a little extra sage (I really like this spice with poultry) and I added the drippings from the roaster to the soup to give a richer flavor to the broth.

It's the day after Thanksgiving and I have leftover turkey and stuffing.  I ususally make a big pot of soup but never usually a cream based one.  This one is absolutely delicious.  I had made a good bone stock using a couple turkey carcass' from turkeys I cooked for the church the day before  (turkey carcass, parsnips, carrots, garlic, Italian seasoning, onions-skin and all, pepper but no salt since I brine the turkey and the drippings are plenty salty.). I ran my cornbread stuffing through the food processor just so it would be more consistent in size.  The soup was simple to make and tasted delicious.  Since I was out of celery I just added celery seed.  Plus the stuffing had plenty of celery in it.  I think today I will saute up some kale and add that to the soup as well bc the kale will go great with the cream base.  I will be making this again, thanks for sharing it.

Ramp it up even more by sticking the carcass in the oven (at 350° F ) until it is browned nicely, include all the skin.  Add it all to the stock pot to make your broth. I add in bay leaf, carrots and celery trimmings, onion with its skin and parsley if I have it.  I cook it all on Thanksgiving day. Boiling it for hours for a nice bone broth.  I strain it and refrigerate it overnight (my garage is so cold I usually put it in there).  Next morning I skim off the fat and my nice broth is ready to make a soup of my choice.  Today, I will be making this one.

When your husband says “this is restaurant quality” you know it’s a good recipe! I added mushrooms, peas and corn because we like them. I was happy to read the reviews from the people who didn’t add the stuffing because I’m gluten free and wanted to make sure that it wasn’t an integral part. Used gluten free noodles but I’m not convinced the soup needed them. For us it’d be just as good without them. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great and a wonderful way to use left over turkey carcass. For the first time I did not have any leftovers beside the carcass and l have always given it away in the pass with not knowing what to do with it..  Glad I kept it! I found this recipe and I was skeptical on how it would turn out, stuffing? fettuccine noodles?  I made as written with an add of two chopped garlic cloves and 1/2 or 1cup homemade Turkey gravy made from the drippings. Kids (7-11) loved it and came back for 2nd helpings. Will make this always after thanksgiving!  next time i’ll make with gnocchi..

I made this soup last night for my family and we all enjoyed it.  Anything that starts with 2 sticks of butter is going to be yummy, but in an effort to cut some calories/fat from the soup, I used 1 cup 1% milk and 1 cup half and half, and it was still very creamy and delicious.  I didn't even have a full hour to simmer the turkey carcass, and it still turned out to be very flavorful.  1/4 cup of stuffing could easily be increased up to 1 cup, as this makes a lot of soup and extra broth, and I didn't even notice the stuffing in the soup with only 1/4 cup in there.  Overall - great recipe that is pretty easy to make.

This is delicious!!  I followed the recipe as is and just added other leftover stuff I happened to have in my fridge.  You cannot go wrong!  Raves all the way around.  It’s very much like a chowder, and so I definitely will use potatoes instead of pasta next time.  I will definitely be making this again.  Great way to use up leftovers!!

Oh my word! I followed the recipe exactly including some pieces of leftover stuffing. This soup was the BEST ever.  Invite a few friends over as it makes a huge pot.  I’d give it 10 stars.

I had to change this slightly to fit our dietary restrictions.  I used Coconut milk instead of half and half,  changed the butter to margarine and eliminated the extra salt as we're on low salt diets.  As others stated as well, I chose to add potatoes instead of fettuccine, to make it more like the restaurant version of this dish.  I should've added more stuffing as well, as others said, too.  We added it in each bowl when we heated it up.

I found that the potatoes sucked up almost all of the salt in it.  We added a lot more salt, and spices to enliven it, and it was then really good.  I messed up the flour roux so I had to add corn starch at the end to thicken it.  I used a stick blender to smooth it out, and my hubby didn't like that it was smooth and not chunky.  But, that's my fault, not the recipe.  

Overall, I will make this again and highly recommend.

Amazing. Rich, but not too rich. Hearty but not heavy. So glad i found this recipe. I thought the stuffing was weird, but it was amazing. I actually could've used more. Only change i made was rice instead of noodles. Just added rice to what i was going to use for dinner so it wouldn’t suck up all the liquid.  I want to try potatoes in it next. Thank you!

Delicious! I used what I had, omitted the celery and carrots, used a cup of leftover dressing and a good tablespoon of sage - so good!!! I'd like to figure out a cranberry relish to top it with!

This recipe is beyond delicious! The only changes I made was I added my left over corn to it (highly recommend) and I left out the stuffing. Instead of putting the stuffing in the soup, I toasted the stuffing and made it into croutons to top the soup- this was really good in my opinion. I will be making this soup every year with my leftover turkey.

I liked this soup. It reminded me of a wild rice soup I make but not the way the pasta cooked. I didn’t like the way the pasta stuck to the bottom of the pot. I think next time I would partially precook the fettuccine and then add it. I think next time I’ll up the amount of vegetables and try wild rice precooked instead of pasta.  This made a huge pot of soup so next time I’ll only make a half batch. This was a tasty soup and a bit different than most turkey soups. I will make it again.

Definitely will make it again. Got rave reviews. Even the 8 year old had seconds!  I used a bag of egg noodles, added a stick of butter to the pot, and used about 3 tbls of chicken boullion.

Loved it! Like other reviewers said, it really didn’t need the pasta - and I’m a pasta fanatic! I added a little leftover stuffing to the soup but what REALLY made it amazing was topping off each serving with a dollop (or more) of warmed-up stuffing. However, with all the butter and half & half, it is not a low-calorie soup...but it is worth the splurge!! I increased the amount of carrots & celery, and added onion. Might try it with chicken when I don’t have a turkey.

I simmered my carcass in the crockpot for like 8 hours and got the most wonderful gelatinous stock.  I took the meat off the carcass before making the stock to avoid it getting rubbery then added about 2 c. meat back in at the end.  I cut the liquids/flour in half to try a half recipe but I still used 1 c. each of the onion, carrot and celery.  I added about a cup of wild mushrooms, peas, and corn.  Rather than stuffing I used about 2 c. of the left over wild rice and mushroom side dish.  I also tossed in some leftover fresh sage, oregano and parsley at the end.  This is a wonderful, flexible and delicious soup.  I froze several portions and look forward to having Thanksgiving again this winter.

Fantastic recipe! The only real change I made was omitting the pasta; it simply doesn't need it. I added extra dressing, since I had it, and that made it hearty enough. I also added a box of chicken stock, which did thin it out a bit. I also used Creole seasoning and a bit of extra ground thyme in place of the poultry seasoning. This was the first time I roasted the turkey carcass and I'm a definite convert! The flavor was rich and light, for sure the best turkey broth I've ever made or tasted. Eating this soup is like eating a light gravy with bits of goodies in every bite. My family agrees this soup is a new Thanksgiving traditition, along with gravy shots at the end of the meal. :)

I made this soup, but modified a bit. I left out the stuffing and the half-and-half to save calories. All the flavor remained. I roasted my turkey with an herb-filled recipe so the leftover bird and resulting stock were amazingly flavorful. I used whole wheat wide, flat pasta and broke it into spoon-sized pieces. Quite yummy!

My go to!! Has amazing flavor and easy to make changes to your preferences. I use egg noodles (really want to try homemade noodles with this, but haven't yet) and I add chicken stock and always add the entire box of stuffing (also wanting to try homemade with this step as well.)  Also adds a ton of flavor if you do three boils instead of one. Makes your broth crazy rich!  Makes a ton and freezes great!!

There is nothing better than homemade turkey noodle soup. I found I did not need to add the milk. After the flour was added to the broth, it was thick and creamy! I added some leftover peas and corn.  Thank you!

Incredibly delicious. I did not add noodles but I added mixed vegetables and it was still very rich and fabulous. Also my guests at all the stuffing so there were only remnants that clung to the sides of the turkey. I boiled the carcass with celery and onion after having picked all the meat off. This gave the broth some extra  gusto.. I left off most of the butter lest I die of a richness overload.

I also had some leftover ham, so I increased all of the ingredients except the turkey by 50% and added 2 1/2 cups of diced ham when the cooled turkey was added as well as a diced green bell pepper (just trying to get rid of all leftovers).  It was fantastic and fed me at work for a week.

Just made this recipe and it turned out amazing.  Making turkey leftovers over and over after thanksgiving can get a little boring.  By making this, I was able to use a decent portion of the leftover meat and turn it into something different and delicious.  I'm so relieved to have this recipe in my cooking arsenal!  :-)
