I make halushki (cabbage and noodles) all the time, but usually use turkey kielbasa in place of the bacon and add a bit of butter at the end of cooking right before serving.  Today, Italy met Poland when I subbed Johnsonville® mild ground Italian sausage for the bacon.  Delish!  I still added 2 TBS of butter to finish.  Yum. Don't forget to use LOTS of fresh ground black pepper!

Per another reviewers suggestion, I used one pot, stirring the cabbage into the bacon & onions mixture. Per another reviewers suggestion, I added caraway seed - brilliant! I also added garlic. My Italian/Irish husband added Parmesan, and I have to admit it was a great enhancement.

I had made some extra wide noodles last week and had some leftover. This was Delish and went perfect with my pork roast! I cooked the bacon, sliced the onions and threw those in. Once they were wilted, I tossed in 1/2 a head of shredded Napa cabbage and sauteed a few more minutes. I did add some celery seed for a little contrast. Next time I would like to try caraway seed instead. Thank you lburger24.

This was pretty good.  My daughter (a bacon fanatic) loved it.  I remember eating "halushka" once at a heritage day at my old church.  One of the couples there were both from Poland.  He was born there but was brought to America as an infant.  She grew up there, only leaving when she met her husband while he was visiting his grandparents.  She prepared halushka, pierogi, and some type of delicious meatballs.  Her halushka did not have bacon in it.  Instead, she sauteed onions, leeks, and garlic with the cabbage in clarified butter.  Then, she added stock or water with the egg noodles and cooked it until the noodles were done and the water or stock was reduced.  She then, just before serving or even at the table, stirred in sour cream.

This is how she shared her recipe and it took me several tries until it tasted like hers.  Maybe no bacon since it was served with meat?  It is, though, the best kind of comfort food.

I made this dish and it was delicious! I sauteed the onion, bacon in the butter until onions were translucent and bacon was just starting to crisp, then added the cabbage and cooked it all together until cabbage was very wilted and cooked done. I added more butter when I added the cabbage. After I drained the noodles, I added all the incredients in the stockpot and it came out great! Of course, it's not a heart-healthy dish since you are using bacon grease and butter for seasoning, but still yummy! I will make again.

5+++. Excellent,  easy meal the whole family, including kids, loves. This brought back such good memories! It was a staple on the table of my German great aunts & my nearly daily dinner as a financially strapped, newly iindependent 20 something. In true depression era frugality,  my aunts taught me to keep a jar of ham & bacon drippings handy to make this when no meat was available. Serve with black caraway bread. Thank you for reminding me of this scrumptious dish. :-)

I have been making halushki for years.  Perfect comfort food, reminds me of dinners at my Hungarian grandma's house.  Like her, I add garlic powder, paprika, and plenty of cracked pepper.  Tastes amazing!

This was nothing short of fantastic! My Mom was visiting when I made this and she LOVED it! We all had seconds. I used less noodles than called for, just my own personal preference. I can't wait to do this one again. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Recipe Group:  I wasn't sure how I'd like this recipe, but ended up really loving it.  Will definitely make again.  Next time, though, I'll use only 1/2 or 3/4 lb of noodles, as it made a huge amount of food and I thought it would be better with less noodles anyway.  I followed the ingredients but slightly changed the cooking method just a bit.  I cooked the bacon, then drained the pan, reserving the drippings which I used as needed to cook the onions & then the cabbage, instead of using the entire amount.  When I stirred in the noodles, I added a few more spoonfuls of bacon drippings for some additional flavor.  There was still a fair amount of leftover drippings, and it still tasted fabulous, so I'm glad I didn't use the whole amount as I think it would have been too greasy, and we certainly saved a lot of fat calories.  Husband wants to try it with kielbasa instead of bacon, and I agree it would be tasty that way as well.

This is something I grew up eating. My grandma made it when my mom and aunt were growing up, and then my mom made it when my brothers, sisters and I were growing up. I’m 56 now, and it’s still one of my favorites. We always always served this with cottage cheese. They go great together! You should try it!

Made it with additions from other recommendations—like adding butter to the noodles at the end of cooking, adding caraway & celery seeds, and adding garlic. Came out superb!

Delicious!!!  I used more bacon than the recipe called for because quite frankly, who doesn't love bacon?   I added a bit of sugar to the cabbage as it was cooking and caraway seeds when I added in the noodles.   This was a winner and will be made again, often!!

This is a great recipe that requires minimal ingredients, is cost-friendly, and really tasty. For me, I prefer less bacon than the recipe calls for.

Try red cabbage with this! It's nice and sweet.

This was the way my husband's aunt made it (Czech background).  We found the additional vegetables (peppers, cauliflower, carrot strips) can also be added.  And since we have hot peppers, my husbands throws those in for an extra zing--removing them before someone eats them.  Great meal with fresh hot bread!

Recipe Group Selection:  08, August 2015 ~ Wonderful!  We really enjoy halushki and this quick and easy recipe didn't disappoint.  I made as written using homemade egg noodles.  The bacon added a nice depth to the recipe.  A recipe I would recommend and make again.

Recipe Group: Easy and very comforting. I loved the combo of flavors in that simple, good home cooking sort of way. I used Reames frozen homestyle egg noodles, which take closer to 20 minutes to cook. Thanks for sharing the recipe, we all enjoyed!

I make this with smoked sausage instead of bacon and cook it all in one pot, except the noodles - cook and add to the pot.  Caraway seeds are the icing on the cake in my opinion, they added just the right flavor.  I actually cook the onions and cabbage until they get a little brown around the edges before adding the sausage and noodles.  I only had the extra wide dumpling noodles.

I really like this dish, though I prepare it in one pot by adding the shredded cabbage directly to the bacon, garlic and onions while also adding a can of cannellini beans along with 2 tablespoons of Spicy Italian salad dressing and a tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce to add a little flavor and fiber. Then I add the cooked pasta just a couple minutes before I take the pot off the heat. I freeze 12 oz servings of this and they reheat well.

Lets call this an Austro-Hungarian recipe ( for all who remember  a pre 1918 time).  It is easy and delicious.  Caraway seed is my favorite addition but  some may prefer either celery or dill seeds.

Halusky is more of Eastern Slovakian dish made similar.
One with noodles, fried cabbage until it is brown, onions,garlic,salt,and pepper. Another one is you substitute potato dumplings, such as gnocchi, instead of noodles. My mother would stand over a pot of boiling water scraping off a small portion of a potato mixture to make the dumplings. Can smell the cabbage frying now.
Made about a month ago for Christmas with the gnocchi,it was great.

Delicious dish! Will make many more times but I will remove some of the bacon grease. It seemed just a little too much for me. It looked like a lot of food after slicing the cabbage and looking at a pound of bacon but after diner for the two of us there was only about 1/3 of it left. I would probably make it as a side to make sure there is enough food for six. My kettles aren't big enough to increase the recipe.

This is very similar to a dish I make.  I usually make it with sausage instead of bacon and add caraway seeds but without noodles.  I tried it with the noodles and liked it.  I think the caraway seeds really improve it.

This is a popular dish with my family. I sometimes replace the bacon with ground beef and garlic. Very good either way.

I made this recipe as is using old fashioned thing egg noodles. It was outstanding when seasoned with salt and pepper. It is also a dish I can play with. Caraway seeds being my first thought but really this is great as it is. For sure not a healthy dish but my polish husband loved it as a treat.

Oh my gosh this is so good! My new favorite recipe. It is so flavorful I can't believe it ! I didn't change anything except add a little bit more butter  because I was putting in more cabbage than what was called for.  But, it is incredible.  I can't believe such a simple dish has so much flavor !!!!

Like others suggested, I used one pot and added a pinch of garlic. I tried using shredded cabbage for cole slaw (had it on hand) but next time I'll definitely go with "real" cabbage! Would like to try the caraway seed next time too.

I make this but instead of bacon, I use hot sausage, which I drain.  Once in a while I add shredded carrot.  It is a fav in my house!

Delicious! I didn't have any bacon so I used turkey sausage instead and added a little olive oil and butter for more grease as the sausage was browning. I also added some fresh minced garlic with the onion and sausage. Turned out fantastic!

I only made this because I had some leftover cabbage that I wanted to use up since I’m trying to work on reducing my food waste.  What a surprise!  My BF wasn’t sure at first, but he went back for seconds. I did add in a few other bits based on others’ reviews-just a bit of celery seed and a bit of sour cream when serving. We will be eating this again and next time not just because I have leftover cabbage. This is good. Give it a chance. Simple, but tasty.

This is the Very best Halushki!!!  The only change I make is adding the bacon at the last minute; mine always gets a bit too soggy if I leave and let it cook/steam!!  My mouth is watering, dinner for tonight!!!

This was the BEST Halushki I've ever made! It was a hit at our company potluck too!  I grew up with Halushki as a family and social staple and we never made it with bacon, but I will be adding it from now on! Great addition!  I used Vidalia onions though I think caramelized onions as another reviewer mentioned would be great! Nice sweet and salty with the bacon.  This our new family favorite Halushki!

This was FANTASTIC.  I didn't have bacon except for bacon crumbles so I melted a stick of margarine with a bit of olive oil & followed the recipe.  It was & is so delicious & I feel just a tad healthier without the drippings from a pound of bacon. It's even delicious cold-I just had 2 forkfuls!!

Very easy to make.  I made it all in one pot.  Did not remover the onion and bacon....just poured the cabbage on top and mixed with the bacon and onion .  After the cabbage wilted a bit, then I added the noodles.  I didn't have any caraway seeds but will try it next time.  My  whole family loved it.

Balancing amounts of bacon, onions and cabbage with egg noodles quickly was seen in being the key to making this really really good Halushki --which I never tried before; the flavors compliment each other and I  love how quick and easy it was to make.  This dreamy Halushki recipe is going in popular family dinner rotation;  I already have some tweaks I want to try with it!

This was delicious!  Except for only using a quarter of an onion, because my hubby can’t eat very much onion, I followed the recipe to the tee. I will make this again. Both my hubby, myself and my youngest child had a second serving.  Yum!

Was a bit skeptical on this recipe.  I bit the bullet and tried it and it was delicious. My only regret is that I only used 1/2 pound of bacon.  I would definitely recommend this recipe to all!

This is great! I didn't have bacon so I used polish kielbasa instead. Also I made homeade kluski instead of the egg noodles.

Made this for supper tonight and it was very much enjoyed.  I made half the recipe  as there is only two of us.  Followed the recipe exactly, with the addition of some butter before serving.  Next time I will cut back  a little on the noodles and add some extra cabbage.  Very tasty!

Skipped the bacon and subbed 3/4 lb. Black Forest ham, diced. Used 12 oz. egg noodles. Gave half the recipe to my friends and they devoured it! Comfort food without the guilt.

I don't know what the authentic version tastes like, but I followed the suggestions some had of using mild Italian sausage with it.  It turned out great.  I made a mistake, but it was still very good.  I'll be making it again to work out my mistake and to try it with bacon next time.  Caraway seeds were a nice touch.

Excellent!  My husband was pleasantly surprised as he didn't expect to like it!  It was delicious and he had 3 servings!  I made it as directed; but half so as to not have a lot left over.  I'd make this again.

My children love this meal just as much as I loved it when my grandmother made it for me. Except she told me amazing stories of how they ate this during hard times in Czechoslovakia. The only thing I do differently...I use thick sliced pepper bacon and green onions.

I had purple cabbage (1/2 rather than a whole cabbage) and made the bacon, onions and cabbage in a roaster that had a bit of leftover pork loin in it.  It discolored the noodles a bit.  My first helping was a bit bland so for my second helping I added more salt and a bit of smoked paprika.  This helped immensely.  I have plenty of leftovers so I will be trying some caraway seeds and maybe some other things.

I LOVE THIS.....I used ½ and ½ Sausage and low fat ground beef instead of bacon.....and can eat this 3 times a day!   It's GOOD!!   Sometimes I put a dab of hot sauce on my serving...because I like "hot sauce" morning noon and night! haha.

Added sour cream, caraway (toasted) paprika and cayenne. Also 3 garlic cloves with the onion, then fried the cabbage. I made the noodles in bone broth for more flavor. This was especially good and my Polish husband immediately asked for more. Crispy bacon makes this dish, btw.
