I posted this recipe, I just wanted to let everyone know that curry powder is NOT the same thing as curry leaf. If you don't have the curry leaf, just leave it out, don't substitute with curry powder.

This is such a delicious and easy recipe!  My husband (who is Indian) loved this dish and said it tasted very authentic.  In fact, he loved it so much he asked me to make the same curry the following day but with chicken.  I did and that was also wonderful! Another reason I love this recipe because shrimp is rather expensive so you can easily substitute this with chicken.  We wnjoy it with Paratha's(Indian flat bread).  I followed the recipe exactly except omitted the curry leaves but the Garam Masala is a must at the end.  The extra flavor after the seasoning makes a big difference in the authentic taste.(in my opinion)  Thanks for the wonderful recipe! This will be a regular dish in our home.

This recipe is really good. My family is Indian and everyone loved it.  As ginger other reviewers said, instead of using garlic paste I used 1 tablespoon minced garlic and 1 teaspoon minced ginger. I also increased the chili pepper to 1.5 teaspoons and salt to 1 teaspoon.

The dish turned out pretty well, I used a can of diced tomatoes in place of the tomato because they're pricy this time of year.  Next time I'd use just a pound of shrimp - it's also pretty expensive, and I like a more equal tomato-to-shrimp ratio.  This dish could hold it's own if it were served as one of three or four for a meal.  Given the amount of fluid in the dish, you'll want to add extra pepper if you like it hot.

This was easy and quite tasty.  Only substitution I made was Madras curry powder for the curry leaves, which are hard to find here. This one's definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I have made this 3 times now and every time it gets better and better.  This truly is an easy recipe which is a good thing since I had never cooked Indian before!  Each time I've made this I noticed I put more and more spice in it, and the flavor gets more and more amazing!  I've also added a dollop of plain greek yogurt at the end to make the sauce a bit thicker which gave it a nice tang! This is definitely a keeper!

I will definitely make this again! With the understanding that curry leaves and curry powder are not the same thing, I still substituted ½ tsp of curry powder for the curry leaves. This cook is on a budget, so I always do what’s most economical, especially if I believe I can still get a good flavor. And a good flavor I did get! I also used 1tbsp of minced garlic and 1 tsp of ginger for the garlic paste as other reviewers did. I used ¼ cup of coconut milk instead of water.  Used a can of diced tomatoes that I mostly drained instead of fresh tomato. I’m glad I did not drain the can well, because I needed the liquid to make more of the sauce…which tasted great over rice. Added some celery and red bell pepper in with the onion.  I served this over plain white rice and it was delish. One thing to note: this dish is not spicy as written. Anyone can enjoy it! It was perfect to me because I didn’t want it spicy, but if you are looking for a spicier dish, just adjust the chili powder.

This was delicious!! I did not use the curry leaves and used parsley instead of cilantro. Served it over Jasmati rice and would definitely make it again.

Flavorful and filling!  For the ginger garlic, I used 1T chopped garlic stirred with ground ginger.  Used a full teaspoon of turmeric and cut the chile powder to 1/2 t.  I couldn't find curry leaves, but did use 1 t. of curry powder and the effect was good.  This was perfect served over a bowl of jasmine rice.

Absolutely Amazing!  Served it to my family and they gave it an A+.  Next time I will make it with tofu instead of shrimp, just for something different; dont get me wrong, the shrimp was awesome.  It was easy, quick and so flavorful.

I really liked this recipe. Hi like things spicy, but my husband isn't too much into spicy, so I used a 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper instead of the full amount the recipe called for and that was perfect. I also added some more water to the sauce as I like it a little more juicy. Overall, best authentic indian flavor I have made so far!

This is the best Indian recipe with shrimp I have made yet! And it takes a total of about 10 minutes to prepare :) I always use frozen shrimp and just dump them into the pan without thawing them & omit the water as a result. I usually actually put only a pound or a bit more of shrimp in rather than the 2lbs that's called for-it just changes up the ratio and gives a bit more of the sauce.I also used dried curry leaves and have gotten no complaints. My hubby is south indian and this is one of his favourite dishes-says it is completely authentic tasting.

Delicious... A true Indian dish. 1st time I have made Indian at home and been so satisfied. I followed the recipe as exact as I wanted to, meaning, I did not put a 1/4 cup oil, doesn't need it. A tbsp was good enough. May not end up with as much sauce at the end, sadly, but I would rather the less oil. Mostly when you want to lick out the bowl at the end of the meal. And I did not have curry leaves or cilantro, but I don't know how necessary it would have been, there is so much sinful flavor. I also used the Garam Masala recipe mix from this site. You will not be disappointed with this recipe. All must try it and make it their new favorite! Thank you for bringing spice to my table!!

Excellent!! No curry leaves available, so skipped those.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes (including liquid). Everything else I had on hand. I did use 1 lb. of large shrimp, but kept the amounts of the other ingredients the same. I think I would double the amounts if using 2 lb. shrimp. I used 1 tsp. cayenne for the ground red chile. I served it with yellow rice and baked Texas 1015 onions.  Wow! I'm embarrassed to admit my husband and myself devoured the entire thing! Thanks for an easy and delicious dish!

This was delicious. I had to make some minor changes to adjust to what I had on hand. I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the tomato and it worked just fine. To get away with only using 1/2 of a lb of shrimp I added some cooked and diced potatoes and some broccoli florets. I just nuked the potatoes in a little water for about 9 mins or so. In the end I added some more spices because I was scared the potatoes would absorb all of the heat. I didn't have curry leaves but the cilantro was great. I added some squeezed lemon. If I ever find curry leaves I will buy them and try this again. I served this over brown rice and some heated up flour tortillas with butter. Mrdrea says 5 stars!!

I really liked this recipe and so did my family. I found it somewhat confusing, though. The ingredients called for ground red chile pepper and the directions say add the "chile powder".  Not sure if I was supposed to add ground pepper or chile powder. Please advise. After thinking it over, I thought maybe a teaspoon of ground red pepper may be overwhelming- so I added 1/2 of both. It was still delicious, but I would like to make it as intended. Thank you for a great recipe!

This tasted amazing and was so easy!  I had to make some adjustments based on the ingredients I had available in the kitchen.  Instead of fresh shrimp, I used a 1 lb. bag of small frozen salad shrimp and it worked perfectly.  I added less water because I put the shrimp in the pan still frozen.  I replaced the garlic/ginger paste with fresh minced garlic and ginger and the tomato with a can of diced tomatoes.  I didn't measure the spices out, and probably ended up using more than the recipe called for.  This is a wonderful recipe that I highly recommend trying!

very easy to make and the flavours were what me and family usually like. I added a white fish (Basa) cut in chunks to it and lightly fried them first in a  mix of cornstarch, soy sauce (2TB ea) and black pepper (1/2 Tsp)  to give them a firmness and a base flavour. Thanks for sharing!

Yum - this was excellent.  Didn't have the curry leaves so just omitted.  Next time I may cut down on the water or eliminate altogether since the sauce turned out slightly runny.  It was still delicious and I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This was DELICIOUS!  I made a few tweaks. 

-Instead of diced tomatoes, I did a can of peeled whole tomatoes (that I pulled apart to make more manageable bites) and added some juice to the sauce
-I added snow peas along with the shrimp
-Didn't have curry leaves, so instead I added 2 tbsp. of curry powder

It was so good, albeit a bit spicy. On top of some basmati rice, it was as good as from a restaurant!

Thank you to the individuals who suggested using fresh ginger and garlic instead of garlic ginger powder. This recipe is very easy. I would only add that if you purchase your ingredients at an East Indian supermarket, you will find the recipe very inexpensive.

This is the first time I attempted to cook Indian on my own. My mother liked it but called it "basic Indian flavours." That means I need to branch out and find less common curry recipes. Great for first time though! Will make again someday :D

This shrimp curry had the perfect taste and was easy to make, but I would definately make it spicier. It isn't even near the heat that is a signature of curry foods.

Followed the recipe to the T with normal mustard seeds instead of black ones, absolutely delicious! And went great with a meal of traditional indian daal and basmati rice. Next time I would add some more chili powder and garam masala to spice it up a notch, especially for those from south asia who are used to spicier food. Loved the sugar addition.... Thank you!

We really like food with a bold taste, so I doubled the amount of spices. It's one of my favorite dishes at a local restaurant, but was disappointed at first in how "waterey" it's consistency was. I added half a cup of coconut milk and a teaspoon of brown sugar. The result was excellent! I do think I'll try tomato sauce next time. It's also a very quick meal to make, bonus for those who live at work.

This is one of the best recipes that I have made from this site.  We used 1/2 t of curry powder since we didn't have any curry leaves.  So yummy and very easy too!

I made this late in the evening after a long busy day.  I had a raw, cleaned pound of shrimp and made this recipe on top of the stove.  The flavor was absolutely fantastic!!  We had just enough butter sauce to use on the rice from last night's meal.  This is a definite keeper of a recipe!!

MY SO and I enjoyed this recipe ALOT!!.  I could not find ginger garlic paste, so I did as other reviewer's:  added 1 tbspn of crushed garlic and 1/2 tspn of ginger.  I also did not use garam masala in my recipe. I too used a can of crushed tomatoes and frozen raw shrimp.   The plate was a big hit, thanks for the recipe.

I hesitated too much to make this recipe because the spices were not so appealing but it came out a big surprise, all my guests ignored the other foods and focused on this one, not a single drop remained in the pot. Great recipe, authentic, tasty and light.

I just made this recipe for the second time tonight, and it was even better than the first.  The only difference this time was I used coconut oil to brown the onions, and I used 2 tomatoes instead of one.  My husband and I enjoyed eating this on roti prata bread!

This was good. I didn't have curry leaves so I left them out and I didn't have ginger garlic paste so I used minced garlic and ground ginger like another reviewer said. This isn't spicy so it was perfect for my little ones but you could just add more spice for your own plate. Nice to have a new recipe for shrimp that isn't a pasta dish. I love curries!

My family loved this curry.  The only changes I made was I didn't have the curry leaves so I added about a half teaspoon of ground curry. I used a can of dice tomatoes. I also removed the shrimp and thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch, then put the shrimp back in.

Great quick and easy curry recipe.  I could not find curry leaves in our town so I used a teaspoon of curry powder, upped the garam masala a tad and just a little hot garlic curry paste. Delish!

This tastes awesome!  I omitted curry leaves since I didn't have any on hand.  I also used frozen, cooked shrimp (after thawing and removing tails), and reduced cooking time after adding shrimp.  I served this with the Indian style basmati rice recipe.  This definitely tastes authentic!

I made a very small amount to try it out, since I live alone. I had no turmeric and no curry leaves... but I used a small amount of dried curry,mince garlic and ginger from a tube of chopped ginger that I keep in my fridge. I also added minced tred pepper ( to use it up). I used cubes of frozen chicken stock that I keep in my fridge. I LOVED IT, and will DEFINITELY MAKE IT AGAIN! THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE!

I've made this dish probably 10 times, it's excellent. Super easy, quick and full of flavor. I go very heavy on the heat. Curry Leaves are a must IMHO (without them it's really a different dish). The only changes I made were procedural in that I think this works better as a bit drier of a curry, and I find adding the shrimp as described is too early in the process. I let the sauce cook down a bit and add shrimps near the end. Tonight I'm going to try grilling the shrimp separate and combining w/ the sauce at the very end, then finishing with the Garam Masala and Cilantro. Thanks RK, it's a staple in our house.

Fantastic, and really easy (my 12 yr old made it)! Love South Indian food, but this was great.  We didn't have and tomatoes or diced canned ones, so we used a little tomato sause and it worked out just fine in a pinch.

This was fabulous. I am South Indian and this was authentic and not too spicy. I followed others and put 1tsp salt and 1.5 tsp chili powder. Next time I will cut the water in half.  Thank you RK!

This is a great and very authentic tasting shrimp curry.  I used canned tomatoes and the liquid in the can instead of the water asked for in the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again!  Try serving with naan or roti.

This was very easy to make, and sooooo great.  The flavor wasn't too spicy for the little ones and was still great for the adults.  I love spicy food, but not everything has to be HOT, this is a great recipe...we are making it again tonight!

Excellent recipe. I'm not sure though it did not come out very thick for me but good things thats how my family liked it. Very flavorful and my husband particularly does not like cream or coconut milk so this was perfect for us.

I used dried curry leaves, but they softened up and were quite edible. I also had two ears of corn on hand, so I worked corn in and upped the tomatoes for extra liquid. Everything else as per recipe, except only 1 lb. of very tasty shrimp. All in all, quite good. When I went out and then came back in the house, it smelled like Indian food. What more do you want?

This is an awesome recipe that I have used for shrimp, fish, chicken, and veggies (usually cauliflower). I have substituted tomato sauce for tomatoes when not available and it still works. Doesn't take long, tastes great, and very flexible! Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious, and every time I make it, it gets better. I have started adding some coconut milk to give it a slightly creamier texture and flavor, as well as modifying some of the vegetables in it. Overall, this is by far one of my favorite recipes I have ever made and I will be making it for years to come.

I have been using Allrecipes for many years and have never reviewed a recipe until now. This was delicious! I added a chopped garlic clove, some dried Thai peppers and a shallot and it came out perfect. I served it with jasmine rice and naan bread. This is definitely a staple curry in our house from now on! Thank you!!

I didn't have curry leaves. I used dried ginger powder and fresh garlic. It tasted great after squeezing fresh lime juice right before eating.

i added green bell pepper, eggplant and chayote and lessened the shrimp somewhat, for a more nutritionally balanced meal, and it was awesome!! 

thank you for this recipe :)

I used curry powder instead of curry leaves but otherwise followed the ingredients pretty closely. Wanted to make a shrimp curry without the fat from coconut milk, and this turned out just great served over plain rice.

This was excellent. I order take-out on a monthly, sometimes weekly, basis from a local Indian restaurant, and they never have anything this good. The only thing I did was doubled the curry leaves, and tried to spice things up. It was just spicy enough for me and another guest, however one person did ask for more heat. :-)

I love Indian food and curries, so I was surprised we didn`t care for this so much. I didn`t like something in the flavor. My mom found it a little spicy and she didn`t like this spiceness. Sorry, maybe just not our flavor.

This turned out well, but not great--probably because I had to make some adjustments.  I used curry powder instead of curry leaves and tumeric.  And I didn't have garam masala or coriander powder.  But it still turned out as a nice spicy dish, just missing something--I'm sure these ingredients would make a difference.  I am going to find a better spice selection somewhere and try it again.  Nice and healthy!
