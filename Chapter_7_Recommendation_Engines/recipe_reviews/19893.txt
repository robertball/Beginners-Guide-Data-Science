I have a trouble to rate this recipe, because this is a recipe with a different reaction in my family. This recipe was a completely new thing for me to make, so I want to write some tips. The recipe is not so difficult as seems. When you make the dough it will have a creamy consistency. Don`t be afraid, it must be creamy. It will become thick after refrigerating (I refrigerated for 3 hours). I made stencils (rounds) on a parchment paper with a pencil using a plate (10 centimeter). Then turn your parchment paper upside down, otherwise the trace of the pencil can be on your baked cigar. Be sure to make a thin layer, your cigars will look more beautiful and you will be able to put more filling inside. I baked the dough for 5 min and I think to rotate the baking sheet is useless. I rolled the dough without any problem, tearing or sticking. I tried to use a wooden spoon, but my cigar sticked to the spoon, so I rolled just using my fingers. Believe me, it is easy to roll. The filling was very tasty, I use only 2 cups whipped cream. But we didn`t like the dough so much. I expected the cigars will be dry like waffles for ice cream, but the dough was soft, similar to roulade dough. And I had a trouble to fill the cigar with the cream completely. I didn`t use grated chocolate to dip the ends. Overall, the recipe is unusual, but, in my opinion, doesn`t deserve a time and ingrediends wasted on it.

These had great flavor, but the cigar part didn't come out the way I thought it would, they were a little too moist and sticky.  The filling began to separate after 1 day.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but they tasted good enough to try again!

Time-consuming but worth it. The dessert overall is a great blend of coffee and sugar, not overly sweet. I made the cookie shells and stored them then made the filling when I was ready to serve so that the cookie shell would remain firm and not soak up the cream filling.  Like I mentioned it is time consuming but the finished product tastes wonderful.
