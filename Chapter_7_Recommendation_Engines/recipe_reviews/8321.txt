I have nothing but positive things to say about this recipe!! It's great!! I omitted the raisins (unfortunately, my family does not care for them like I do) and spread cream cheese frosting overall.  OHHHH sooo good!! Thanks Corwynn for sharing this one...its a keeper!

Wow! I just baked this cake an hour ago, and had to write a review. I was nervous about baking a cake with no eggs, or milk so I was expecting the worst. It came out GREAT. I changed a lot of the recipe - I added about 3/4 cup of cocoa powder w/the dry ingredients, omitted the raisins/cloves, used about a half cup extra of applesauce, and about a tablespoon of vegetable oil, and baked it in a small round springform pan. I topped it  with a simple glaze (ref: vanilla glaze recipe on this site), and then sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar. It came out fantastic this is a great recipe to get creative with - Thanks for posting!

I gave this cake 5 stars even though mine didn't turn out the way I expected, which was my own fault--I used Spenda instead of white sugar and the cake did not rise well. The flavor is still excellent, but I have a very dense cake. It is recommended that for cakes to use an 8" pan instead of 9" and add 1/2 c. non-fat dry milk and 1/2 tsp. soda for every cup of Spenda. Wish I would have checked into this before! Also, I left out the raisins, would be better with walnuts I think.

Absolutely AMAZING! I used about 2/3 cup applesauce sweetened with brown sugar, added a pinch of nutmeg, and only used about a half teaspoon of salt. I substituted the butter with 1/2 cup margarine and 1 tbsp fat free milk. I also used an 8x8 inch pan, and it turned out simply fantastic. It is in all honesty the best spice cake I have ever had. That applesauce adds an awesome flavor and texture

Very easy, very moist, and very tasty recipe. I omitted raisins only because I didn't have any in the pantry; and added 1 tsp. vanilla. The cake baked perfectly in exactly 50 minutes using a 9 inch square pan. I sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top before serving.   My husband devoured it.

Awesome. I didn't have ground cloves on hand, so I used allspice. I also substituted dark brown sugar for the white. Definitely a keeper. Thanks, Corwynn.

Super easy and super delicious AND healthy too!  Cloves were a bit strong.  Will reduce next time.  Only alteration was I put in 1/2 cup of finely chopped walnuts! Yum I am saving this one!

I was hesitant about trying this because I don't like spice cakes, but it was excellent!  My husband left (maybe) 2 pieces for me and ate the rest within a day.  I wish that it made a bigger cake.

Awesome! I only tweaked the amount of spices (I always add more cinnamon!). It's fabulous with cream cheese frosting. I made 12 cupcakes; they were baked perfectly in 30 minutes. Excellent - I'll definitely be making these again!

It was easy to make. Obtained a messy, sticky goo upon chopping the raisins with my food processer. Should be left as they are.

A long while ago I googled "cake no milk no eggs" (did not have any in the house) and up popped this recipe. It has been a favorite ever since. I am not a fan of raisins so I left them out, but the cake was moist and delicious anyway. My kids love it and it is so quick and easy. Powdered sugar and whipped topping makes this cake a little piece of spice cake goodness. Baking one now and wanted to share.

I love that this cake uses simple ingredients AND tastes great!  I replaced half of the flour with whole wheat flour and it turned out just fine...still very moist.  I also made a simple glaze to top the cake with and make it extra special (1C icing sugar + 1/2 tsp vanilla + 3-4 tsp milk).  This recipe is a definite keeper!

Great recipe.  The people who tasted this cake said it was one of the best cakes I had ever made.  Hope they were referring to the recipe and not my baking :)  I replaced 1/2 cup white flour with 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and used homemade chunky applesauce.  I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups (my applesauce was sweetened).  Will double the recipe next time as it didn't really make alot. As another reviewer suggested, a cream cheese icing would go really well with this cake.  Might also try adding a bit of lemon zest next time.

This cake is fantastic! Very moist with great flavor, and so easy to make! I didn't use raisins or cloves, so I added a 1/4 tsp. more cinnamon, and it came out great. Perfect flavor. I also used 1/4 cup canola oil instead of 1/2 cup butter. I wil definately be making this again.

Made this cake for my son's first birthday twice...once for family and once for his party.  Everyone gobbled it up both times.  I have since started making the recipe as muffins instead of cake.  I use whole wheat flour instead of white and nobody in my house has noticed the difference!

Can't get much simpler than this - what a nice little cake! Great on it's own, but adding nuts & some cream cheese frosting would be a welcome addition too. (I left out the raisins 'cause just not into them).

Pretty good. To avoid the dryness, don't bake quite so long.  Would be good with an icing (caramel or cream cheese) to balance the spice.

I first made this cake this past October.  I had applesauce to use up, and this sounded like a nice fall dessert/snack cake. It far surpassed my expcetations. Very moist, buttery and the apple flavor is perfect! The pinch of salt perfectly brings out the butter flavor and balances the sweetness. I use chunky applesauce that is sweetened, since that's what I keep on hand for my kids, and it turns out great...not at all too sweet. I just made it again for the fifth time.  It's a perfect, homey, comfort-food snack cake, brunch cake or dessert.

Delicious, moist and relatively healthy! i used 1/4 cup of butter and 1 1/4 cup of applesauce. I reduced the cloves to 1/4 tsp, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and omitted the raisins. I baked in a 8X8 pan for exactly 40 minutes and it came out perfect! I bet this would taste really good with chopped walnuts and finished off with cream cheese frosting!

Soooo Moist! I was looking for a way to get rid of a jar of applesauce and I'm so happy to have found this recipe. I omitted the raisins and cloves, but substituted a 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries and a pinch of nutmeg. The combination of flavors with the tartness of the fruit was divine. To top it off, I made the blueberry sauce recipe on this site (isybel's) and dropped it by the spoonful on top of a slice that I cut-out. This will definitely be made again.

Soooooo good.  I hope my family comes home soon so I don't eat this entire thing myself.  I halved the cloves since so many others recommended that.  This cake is lightly buttery and sweet but not overly so.  I started to chop the raisins as the recipe says to, but got annoyed so I just threw them in whole and it turned out great.

This was a soft, buttery spice cake.  Though it was pretty sweet, I think the cinnamon was overwhelming.  I'm really pleased with how it turned out, though - it was delicious!

Love this recipe. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, and didn't add the topping.  My kids loved them.  I will be making them again.

This was a hit at church.  Left over applesauce was not wasted and I had a great dessert for dinner.  Added about a cup of pecans and frosted with allspice cream cheese frosting.  Wonderful

For a quick and easy snack cake, you can't go wrong with this. I did not chop the raisins (just lazy I guess), but I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and it was perfect.  Just the right amount of spice, etc. Very moist & delicious.

I made this for dessert last night and this morning there was only one piece left.  A great, flavorful snacking cake.  Nice and moist.  I did add additional spices for more of a spice cake flavor and was not disappointed.  The family loved it.

Excellent recipe!! I would say about 4 cooked apples makes a cup and this recipe does not need salt. I put only a dash of cloves, I think a 1/2 teaspoon would be strong , I also added a couple dashes of nutmeg and a few  more dashes of cinnoman.And for a healthier version omit the butter and use canola oil. Before throwing the cake in the oven I also put more applesauce blobs on the top and "swirled" them in.

This cake is so good...at least I thought so.  My husband said it was ok then said it was pretty good by his third piece.  I am glad I didn't add the cloves.  I did also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and cinnamon glaze when cake was done.  Made it in my bundt pan.  Next time will double recipe to get a bigger cake.  Tasty...will definitely make again!

Wonderful recipe- very moist and (my favorite) it's very versatile!  I used about 2 tsp apple pie spice instead of the cinnamon/cloves b/c I was out of cloves post-Christmas, omitted the raisins (DH hates them) and frosted it with a buttercream frosting.  I also made it with homemade McIntosh Applesauce.  Yum.

I suprised myself when I didn't think that this was very good.  I usually love this kind of thing.  But the batter was too thick and when the cake came out it was too dry.  I used golden raisons, though, because that was all we had.  I also thought there was too much ground cloves, so I recommend 1/4 teaspoon.

This recipe had me scared for a bit. Read the review about the batter being too thick and upon mixing it seemed to be. I left out the raisins because my kids don't care for them, otherwise it was by the book. Poured (plopped?) the thick batter into the pan and smoothed it out. Baked it and everyone said it was delicious. My 6 year old is asking to make it again because it is so good! Thanks for the perfect cake!

This cake is addictive!  The butter makes it so tender and delicious!  I had no raisins on hand, so I left them out.  I was using homemade sweetened applesauce, so I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I also used 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon instead of 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves and added a splash of vanilla.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy and  delicious. My family devoured it. When I ran out of sugar and raisins, I made it with brown sugar and dried blueberries and it was every bit as good if not better.

This was delicious.  I was concerned about no eggs, and the batter was very thick, but I followed the directions and it was really, really good.  I chopped the plumped raisins with a chef knife and substituted coconut oil for the butter since I'm on a diary free diet and used an 8x8 pan since that's all I had.  Wow, great cake!

My husband said this was one of the best snack cakes he has ever had. I switched up the recipe by using 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar  and a teaspoon and a half of apple pie spice instead of the cinnamon and cloves. Great way to sneak in more fruit to my kid's diet. ;)

This is OK. I think it needs more spice (like maybe some allspice, ginger, and nutmeg), and definitely an egg added to the creamed butter and sugar for a little lift. Very easy and quick recipe. I used an 8x8 pan; it was done in 50 minutes.

I used shredded carrots instead of raisins and nutmeg and molasses instead of cloves.  I got 12 very small cupcakes out of this, but they were very goood.  More like cake than muffins.

Can't give this a 5 because I didn't follow exactly, but it's a great recipe- love it!
 I mixed all the dry ingredients together (no raisins), added 1 tbsp lemon juice, then the applesause and 1/2 cup canola oil.  Mixed together and made 14 cupcakes (baked at 350 for 25 min).  I LOVED the taste.  I added the spice amounts as indicated and thought it was perfect!
I've made this a second time and added the chopped raisins.  The addition of the chopped raisins really changes the flavor of the cake.  I feel like the raisin flavor overpowers all the spices in the cake and that may be why a lot of reviewers felt it needed more spice.  I'll keep this as a go-to recipe, but won't be adding raisins again.

I found this recipe to be delightful!  Perfect just the way it is, but I add black walnuts for my dad's benefit.  My husband eats the HECK out of this cake!  I've made it so many times I can make it from memory now.  It goes GREAT with Bumblebee's caramel icing!  With the icing, though, I don't use as much powdered sugar as it calls for.

Only 1 star be/c atleast it's edible, otherwise zero.  I baked it twice thinking I did something wrong wondering why it didnt fluff up and cook through the center.After preparing it again and keeping a watchful eye, it came out the same...raw inside this is not moist by all means its RAWish dough... It tastes like it could be great, so I'll keep looking

The only thing that I changed on this at all was that I used Craisins rather than raisins, as were more cranberry fans. After about40 minutes of cooking I checked it and the knife came out clean. I left it in for 5 more minutes. The cake hardly rose at all and was very dense. And while the outside was almost too done, the inside seemed extremely undercooked. I wonder if this is what everyone else calls "moist"..... It really is too bad, because the flavor is wonderful. But I will not make this again

Very good!  I am always looking for sweets recipes without eggs and nuts. I omitted the raisins as I didn't have any and my little guy doesn't like them anyway.  Made this as muffins and they turned out great.  Most of the cakes I make without eggs turn out so dense but this did not.  This turned out moist and fluffy.  The only thing I will change next time is to decrease the amount of clove.  It was a little too prominant for my taste.  Might try subbing WW flour as many reviewers did.  Thanks for a great recipe without eggs and nuts!  Will make again and again!

Very moist and tasty.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar.  Also, I didn't have any ground cloves, so I used 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

This cake is absolutely scrumptious!  My husband is still raving about it.  The only issue I had with it is that it fell apart when it was cut.  Nevertheless, it was extremely moist and delicious and I will make it again.

My girls loves this!
I made a few minor changes- they don't like raisins, left them out. And no cloves.
I only had 1/2c. applesauce so I chopped up a small apple to add to it. Plus a little vanilla. YUMMY! Will be making again soon.

This recipe was good. However, the cloves WERE a bit strong.  I forgot to add the salt, but it still came out well.  I used parchment paper on the bottom of the pan, instead of greasing and flouring.  This helps to get the cake out of the pan MUCH more easily.  Not my favorite applesauce cake, so I will keep looking... but a pretty good recipe.

Very good, very easy recipe. Didn't realize it until after I had put it in the oven, but I forgot to add the salt, however it didn't seem to cause me any troubles. The cake did rise wonderfully (I read a few reviews that said theirs didn't) and was very moist with just the right amount of spice. Sprinkled the top with confectioners sugar. Delicious!

This is so moist and delicious but I'd leave out the raisins and add a little bit of simple icing. Also, I'll probably double the recipe next time and make a 9X13-this will not be enough!!

Made this for my hubby who said it was definately "a contender".  He found the spices just right.  My only complaint was that it didn't rise hardly at all, but that's probably something I did.

I was really excited about this cake, but it turned out very dry on the outside and almost raw on the inside and was lacking in flavour.

Truly easy to make and perfect texture - you won't miss the egg. I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. according to other users' suggestions. I thought the cloves were a bit overpowering - next time I will make this using 1/4 tsp. ground cloves. Yum!

I liked the flavor of the cake, but the texture turned out too dry and was not coming out of the pan easy. I think that the applesauce wasn't a distinguishable flavor over the cloves. Just tasted like spice cake.

i had many leftover apples, so i made an applesauce(found the recipe in this site also). i was too lazy to  chop the raisins or mix it properly, so i just dumped all ingredients and adding semi-ground walnuts (about 100 gr) in a bowl, combine it by hand, and put it in a loaf pan. The cake didn't rise well (well, had been expected because i didn't mix it properly) but it tasted soooo good that i cancelled taking it to office and eaten it myself within 3 days. super yum.

I'm not sure if I've ever even had applesauce cake before. I know that I've never made one, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Boy, am I glad that I started with this one. I omitted the raisins, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I can't believe how moist it is!

Good cake and the texture was nice, however ws much more like a spice cake than an "applesauce cake". You could try to play with it, by adding apples, and cutting back on the spices (especially the cloves), but I won't make again. I would be nice for someone with milk or egg allergies.

I am not sure what I expected, but ithis tasted a bit like gingerbread to me. There are too many raisins for my taste. (I like raisins) The cloves are a bit overpowering too. If I make it again, I will cut the cloves down to 1/8t. It is very moist and I like the texture. I will take the rest to my Bible Study in 2 days and see what the ladies think. Maybe I will frost it with some cream cheese frosting and see if that helps...

I love this recipe and have made it many times over the years. It's great as is but also a perfect base, using cinnamon to replace all the spices and then can add blue berries or mixed berries or peaches. I also have used o make muffins and the muffins are even better than the cake. Same temp for 30 mins and makes 1 dozen medium (cup cake liners filled about 2/3) muffins.

Awesome!   I did use only 1/2 cup raisins which was more than enough.  Instead of butter, I subbed with organic shortening & I used an 8x8" pan.  I will be making this often!!  Thanks for a great simple, awesome recipe.

This recipe turned out better than expected.  Used a 9" round pan (too big) but next time will use an 8x8.  Hand chopping the raisins is better than putting in a processor which turns to goo.  Did add walnuts because we like them.   Used my homemade lightly sweetened chunky applesauce and could have reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4 in the recipe.  My husband has be raving about this cake since I made it and already looks forward to my making it again.

This simple cake turned out great. I was a bit scared when I saw how ugly the batter was, but it finally came together nicely. I used 1/2 cup whole raisins and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I also added a little vanilla. Good and easy for those of us who are baking challenged :)

Turned out great.I doubled the recipe to make a layer cake. I substituted coconut oil for butter and also added 1/2 tsp of allspice and 1tsp of nutmeg. I made a cream cheese frosting to top it off.  Definitely a keeper thanks for sharing.

Made this cake with just a few changes.  I chose to leave the raisins whole, added a dash of vanilla and upped the applesauce by about 1/4 cup.  I also added chopped walnuts to the top prior to baking.  Served it at a potluck and it was a big hit.  It was moist and delicious.  Definitely a keeper!

This cake turned out great! Was easy to make and very moist. I used cream cheese frosting on top and that was a wonderful addition!

This cake is so easy, moist and flavorful. I think the spice levels are spot on and the only thing I change is using half white sugar and half brown sugar. It's great plain but add a vanilla glaze drizzled across the top if you want to really show it off.

My husband loves this cake! I left out the raisins at his request, but it is still his favorite! I serve it warm with whipped cream! I use my own applesauce. Next time I will make it with pear sauce and see. Will let you know how it came out

I reduced the cloves by half, and added a pinch of nutmeg and ginger. I didn't chop the raisins; I don't think it's necessary. I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I'm definitely keeping this recipe so I can make it again!

This recipe is excellent! I used homemade applesauce  (minus the sugar the recipe called for). I also made an adjustment to the spices - I used 1/4 teaspoon of cloves & 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. I then topped it with a cream cheese frosting. Very moist & the flavors meld together very well! If you like spice cakes, you'll love this one.

It is quite tastey, nice spice taste.  I put a cream cheese frosting on it which added sweetness to the cake.

Excellent recipe!  I made it with gluten-free flour, half the sugar, and no raisins (didn't have any), and the flavor was fantastic.  The texture was very good, but it fell apart, due, I'm sure, to the gluten-free flour.  I will add an egg or two in future to help with that.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Although easy to make, this was just okay for me and didn't have quite the flavor I was hoping for, and I was hoping this would taste better the next day, but it got stale very quickly.  Other than using my own applesauce, and not chopping the raisins, I left everything else as directed.

Made this in a 9x13 cake pan therefore I made a few changes.  Pecans and no raisins, but you can even add both. 3/4 c butter, 1 1/2 c sugar, dbl the soda, applesause, flour, cinnamon, cloves,and added a pinch of nutmeg.  I will add even more applesauce if I have it next time or decrease flour by 1/2 cup as it was very tasty but I like a little more of a moist cake. Thanks for sharing.

35 min. and it was done, moist, sweet, and just plain good. The toothpick came out clean in 30 min. but I put it in for another 5 and I'm glad I did. I made the applesauce from scratch too. I wouldn't put icing on this one though, its kind of muffiny.

Yummy! I didn't have cloves, instead used nutmeg. I also baked it in a muffin pan for 35 minutes. Topped them with butter frosting. Not one was left. Next time, I'll add walnuts. Super easy! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Just baked this recipe.  It baked quickly, done in 30 minutes and did not rise much, however the cake tasted light.  Seems like there is a bit too much salt in the recipe.

This cake is delicious and the applesauce makes it SO moist! I didn't change a thing and it is now my favorite snack cake recipe. I made one for my neighbors and they loved it, also.

Oh my yummy!  This cake was awesome.  I made it for hubbys birthday and he and the kids loved it.  The only changes I made were adding a cream cheese frosting and a shredded zucchini (I was out of raisins).  It was a little rich with the frosting but great just the same.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!  (In case anyone has trouble finding a frosting recipe like I did, 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted, 1/3 cup lite cream cheese, 1/2 tsp vanilla  Combine and spread on warm cake)

This is the first thing I've ever baked in my life!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great!  It's a bit sweet in my opinion, so next time, I'm going to try using 1/2-3/4 cups sugar instead of 1 cup.  Other than that, AWESOME recipe!

A very nice moist cake and easy to make.  I used sweetened apple sauce, doubled the recipe, and added 1 cup of sugar instead of 2.  Came out perfect in a 9X13 pan.

I made this recipe for my career cooking class.  It was so good!  Everyone loved it, except for those picky eaters who won't touch raisins.  It takes awhile to bake, but it's worth it!
