I tried this recipe because I didn't have any ideas for the sauerkraut.
This was so simple to make and took so little time.
My family loved it and I couldn't believe how
little you could taste the sauekraut.
I highly recommend this to anyone who
appreciates good food.

When I saw the one negative comment, I almost passed this recipe by. I am really glad I didn't because it is the best rendition of Pork and Sauerkraut that I have had. 
It is easy to make and you can play around with the ingredients. The last time I made it I didnâ€™t have spiced applesauce and found that regular worked great. We also like to add apple slices to the mix. 
Sliced Pork Tenderloin is the best pork to use. I usually double the mix ingredients because of the amount of meat from the tenderloin.

I loved the sweet/savory flavor of the apple kraut in this recipe. It's very forgiving. Substitute other liquids or kraut juice for chicken broth if it's not on hand. Use a dollop of prepared mustard if you don't have powdered. I skipped the bacon completely.

I used this recipe twice with a pork loin, once baked and once in the crockpot. I served the kraut and mashed potatoes as a side. Some buttered spaetzl with carraway seed would work too.

I made this on New Year's Day for my husband, it is their family tradition to have sauerkraut and pork on New Year's Day for good luck in the new year.  This recipe is awesome!  I added a chopped granny smith apple and a sprinkle of caraway seed.  I left out the bacon and juniper berries (I didn't have any).  If I could give this recipe ten stars, I would.  My husband can't stop raving about it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved it. Wasnt sure because the combo of apples and kraut seemed strange. I dredged boneless porkchops in a flour and herb mixture and then browned the chops in oil. Skipped the bacon but bet its yummy. Skipped sugar and broth.  Put the chops in a greased casserole dish. In a mixing bowl I mixed the home made applesauce, drained and pressed canned sour kraut. Eyeballed it about 2:1 applesauce:kraut. Covered the chops with the mixture, covered with foil and baked for 20 mins. Rested for 20 mins covered (I needed my oven for 2 loaves bread).  Uncovered casserole and baked uncovered 5 mins at 450. Used meat thermometer to monitor doneness. Served with broccoli, home made whole wheat bread, green salad. Yum. Easy! Tastes and looks like you worked hard. Love it. Family loved it. Would be great with caramelized onions and caroway seeds added or those french onion crunchy things over the top.

This was easy to put together. We didn't have spiced applesauce or the juniper berries, so we used some homemade applesauce instead and omitted berries. We had thin pork chops, so we only left it in oven for 50 minutes. It still turned out wonderfully! Pork was very tender and juicy. Mashed potatoes were the perfect side for this dish. We are thinking about using this recipe for pork loin in crockpot next time.
