This recipe is worthy of 5 stars, only I think maybe ( and this could totally be only me that thinks this) the instructions should have included a bit of water in the bottom of the pan to keep the honey mustard sauce from burning onto the bottom. Keeping just enough water in the bottom throughout the baking process makes a really flavorvul juice that would go well with throwing some potatos in for the last 30 mins. However the combination of flavors are simple and wonderful and I am quite happy I found this recipe. Thanks V Greer :)

Used the slow cooker for this and it was delicious.  I had a 1 1/2 lb pork loin.  Laid it on a piece of foil (without browning it first) and poured the mustard mix over it.  Wrapped the foil tightly around it and place it flat in the slow cooker, on high for 2 hours, then another 7 hours at low.  Actually did this overnight.  It coated beautifully and was SO tender.  Used only about a teaspoon of black pepper.  The only change I will make next time is to directly salt and pepper the pork all over before laying it on the foil.  Easy!

We loved the flavor in this recipe!!!  I wish I had taken the advice of other reviewers and added a little water to the bottom and made a sauce.  I added some potatoes to the pan for the last hour and they were wonderful, but I was really looking for a sauce to put over the pork roast when we ate it.  These flavors were soooooo good, I wanted more!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Even our Miss Picky 2 year old ate it!  UPDATE - 10/18/06  Made it again with a little water in the bottom (about 1/3 c) and put a can of whole potatoes in the same pan to roast.  The water helped to make a little sauce that was DIVINE on the potoates and the meat. Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, goooooooood!

Five Star Plus - I used the exact amts stated for the sauce - will use a little less pepper next time.  I also put slivers of garlic into the slits before I brushed on the sauce. I cooked it for 20 min. at 400 degrees, added water to cover the bottom of pan as others suggested (it keeps the roast moist), lowered temp to 350 and cooked it approx. another 60 min. basting frequently and adding water as needed. I saw no need to turn the roast over. There was a nice amount of pan gravy to use over mashed potatoes.  We really enjoyed the flavor!  Thanks submitter!!!

This was sooo easy and sooo good! Based on previous reviews a) used 1 tsp pepper but might increase to 1 Tblsp next time, b) added water to cover bottom of pan and that was a great idea, c) covered pan after turning roast over. Came out wonderfully moist and tender. Wanted lots of sauce so diluted about 1 Tblsp cornstarch in 1/2 cup water, added to drippings and boiled. Yum, yum!

This was an unbelievably moist and tasty roast. The unique honey/mustard/pepper marinade made it very flavorful. I, like many others, cut back on the pepper. I used only 2t which was quite pungent enough for my family. I cooked mine covered for two hours, then uncovered for one more hour. Three hours at 300 degrees was perfect for a 3.25lb roast.

Well, I tried this a few months ago and wasn't too impressed, so I decided to give it another shot today and see if I could improve it.  I used this recipe in the crockpot, and doubled the amount of sauce (except for the pepper, only used 2 teaspoons).  Placed it in the crockpot, added a 1/2 cup of water to the bottom and cooked on low for 8 hours.  Pork wasn't as tender as I'd hoped, but I think that was my mistake - the cut of roast was too thick to tenderize in 8 hours.  The sauce tasted pretty good, especially after I boiled the drippings and added some cornstarch for a gravy.  Yum.  I had added potatoes under the pork with a layer of onions on top, hoping they'd soak the flavor of the honey mustard, and, unfortunately for me, they did.  Folks, honey mustard and potatoes do NOT mix, so don't do what I did.  Ended up tossing out the potatoes and saving the roast.  Stick to the recipe and double the sauce and it'll turn out great.

Pork loins were on sale this week, so I needed a recipe, I cooked two loins about .75kg each (l & 1/2lbs)in a roaster, no lid and a tad of water on the bottom. I included pepper, but not nearly the amount called for in the recipe. Could'nt find thyme in the house so I used an Italian Seasoning which had thyme in it. This roast was juicy and delicious. Don't forget to make a pork gravy to go with it. I will make it again, and would definetly make it for a dinner guests. All the best!

We really liked this, but it wasn't as tender as I hoped-probably my fault.The sauce was to die for. I used more mustard, less honey, less pepper and thickened it up. Will make again and might try an oven bag when cooking next time.

I've never had a pork roast seasoned with honey and mustard so I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I was anxious to give it a try.  What I DID know was that I don't like sweet on meat, so I immediately knew I'd have to reduce the honey to 2 T., which worked out well for me.  I added about a tablespoon of whole grain mustard along with the Dijon to give the rub more complexity, but that certainly wasn't a necessary addition. Whether you'd use freshly cracked pepper or just regular ground pepper, 2 T. is excessive, so I just gave it several grinds of the pepper mill, to taste, as well as some salt.  As a matter of personal preference I used fresh chopped rosemary, about a tablespoon, rather than thyme, as well as 2 cloves of garlic, minced. This rub was gorgeous and I hoped it was a sign that this roast was really going to be good.  Since pork is now so lean, I didn't want to risk it drying out in the oven so I wrapped three strips of bacon around it which also gave it great flavor and was a wonderful contribution to the pan gravy I made from the drippings. Finally, I felt more comfortable with a higher roasting temperature, so into the oven at 350 degrees it went, for about an hour and twenty minutes - no slits, no turning, no brushing with more of the honey-mustard mixture.  It was perfectly done, moist and tender - but you've got to like "what's on it," as Hubs put it.  I did, he did not.  Except for 2 T. of pepper (!)  this is a nice recipe.

So Yummy! I doubled the sauce, used only 1T pepper and added 1/2 cup water. Threw the everything in the slow cooker on low 8 hours. Everyone loved it. My picky 5 year old asked for seconds.

I used a 4 1/2 Boneless Pork Loin Roast, put the Honey Mustard mix on the night before so all the flavors married together. I wrapped in bacon and roasted for 1 hour on a wire rack in a roasting pan. I then covered with foil and roasted for another hour and a half. It was super moist and tender, with plenty of tasty drippings for gravy. Served with mashed potatoes with the gravy. My guests loved it!

I grilled rather than cooking in the oven b/c we love the taste of the grill on our pork & to speed up cooking time.  This was SO GOOD!  A keeper for sure!

OMG!!  This was sooo good.  I didn't have any djion mustard, so I used honey mustard instead, used Italian seasoning and added garlic and turned out awesome.  My hubby loved it.  I loved the extra sauce on the mashed potatoes.  I don't really measure everything exactly, so the extra sauce was handy for basting especially after I had taken it out of the oven.  I basted it every 5 mins so it was nice and glazed looking.

I tried this with chicken breasts instead of pork and it worked pretty well.  Despite all the pepper I thought this didn't pack a whole lot of punch and needs some more spices, or maybe some garlic, to give it some more zing.  Over all though it's a healthy recipe that is cheap and easy to make and tastes fine.  It doesn't wow, but it's good.

Made this using a 2 lb. roast and as other reviewers suggested I added some water to the pan, cut the pepper back to 1 t., used fresh rosemary rather than the dried thyme and added a couple of cloves of fresh garlic, minced.  I didn’t cut any slits and didn’t turn the roast.  I also roasted this at 350 degrees to an internal temperature of 155.  If you roast this to 170, it’s bound to be dry and probably tough.  Remember that the temperature will continue to rise once out of the oven and standing for 15 minutes.  My roast was still moist without a hint of pink (which wouldn’t have been bad for us).  The au jus created by the honey mustard and water was very good drizzled over the pork when serving.

I've had this in my recipe file for sometime and keep coming back to it. Why? Because it works, it's delicious and easy to make with on-hand ingredients. Out of the ordinary but somehow, just right. Many thanks for another great "go to" that puts a little spark into family mealtime!

Nice recipe with a great taste.  I mixed up the ingredients as written, but used the slow cooker for my cooking method, due to the length of baking time.  Didn't want to be eating at 9:00 after work.  The slow cooker worked great and the marinade stuck to the meat.  When I got home, I pulled the roast from the slow cooker and put it in oven for about 30 minutes with additional marinade.  It browned up nicely.  Definitely will be using this recipe again.  Probably using the same cooking method.

Let me start by saying that I completely lost my taste for pork almost a year ago.  Until tonight.  I thought this was fantastic.  I cut back on the pepper, and used fresh ground.  I also used 1/2 the honey, and suplimented with some deli mustard for a little extra "zing".  The flavor of the glaze was amazing.  A family hit and sure to be made again and again!!

Excellent! After reading some reviews I cut the pepper back to about 2 tsp. but would probably increase that to at least 1 Tbs. next time.  I put just a little water in the bottom of the pan and roasted with some baby potatoes, about 1 and a half hours at 350 for a roast under two pounds.  It got rave reviews.

I followed this recipe exactly EXCEPT for the pepper, I cannot imagine using 2 tablespoons of pepper. I used 1 teaspoon and the sauce was great and had just the right amount of kick. 
I doubled the sauce and added carrots, potatoes, and an onion (half way through)... it turned out pretty good but I would cut the potatoes pretty thin.

The glaze itself was ok.  The thing that made it amazing was making a "gravy" with the pan drippings.  It made a delicious honey mustard sauce that was enjoyed by the whole family.

The flavor was there, but let me give you some advice and line your baking dish with foil. The sauce will ruin the dish.

yum yum  very good recipe I only have one suggestion that is to cook the pork to 160°F (71°C), this will produce a juicy tender meat, anything higher and you risk your pork getting tough :) 160°F is an absolutly safe temperature to cook your pork by the way :)

This recipe was a good one. I used a two lb. pork tenderloin, doubled the honey and mustard, used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, and added several cloves of finely chopped garlic. Wrapped it tightly in foil as another reviewer suggested and cooked it in the crock pot for about 7 hours, half on medium heat and half time on low. Very tender, came out a lot like a pot roast, shredded easily with a fork! Will throw BBQ sauce on leftovers to make BBQ pork sandwiches.

This was a great VERY simple way to prepare a pork roast. I cooked mine in the slow cooker with cubed potatoes and carrots on the bottom. I made the sauce as written except for less pepper than was called for. The smell in my kitchen was fantastic! I will definately make this again, but use a little more honey and mustard and cut the Thyme down to 1/4 tsp for preference. I may also add some fresh minced garlic too. I didnt add any water to this sauce as the cooker does that on its own.

This is a keeper! Very tasty, but did cut back on the pepper considerably. Glad to have enough left for sandwiches tomorrow. Accompanied the roast with the herbed roasted vegetables on this site. Great combination. Thanks for the recipe.

VERY GOOD!  My husband and I loved this, but my son turned up his nose and wouldnt even try it, he said meat shouldnt be sweet!  We didnt care left more for us! I only used 1t of coarse ground black pepper, and thought it was just right.  It made excellent sandwiches the next day for lunch.  I will use this receipe often.

Great recipe. I added about a 1/2 bottle of white wine to the bottom of the pan. Adds moistness as well as keeps it from burning.

My family gobbles this down every time I make it.  I always wrap it up in tin foil before throwing it in the oven.  It keeps it nice and moist.  The flavor is great and it is always a hit.  This is a must have for a nice supper!  I make cheddar mashed potatos, a veggie and some sweet dinner rolls with it.

Very good.  This was the first time I made a pork roast and it turned out very well.  Everyone liked it.  NOTE: I used 1 tablespoon pepper and it was still to spicy for my husband (Wow, it must be SMOKIN' with 2 tablespoons!:)  *I* liked it and found it just spicy enough with the 1 T.

I would rate this many more stars if it were possible!  I have been looking for a great pork roast recipe for awhile, and I have finally found it!  Yummy!  Tender, juicy, and ohhhh so good!  A great, great meal - definitely my preferred way of making pork roast!  Like others, I would suggest including a layer of water at the bottom of your pan.

My husband raved about this recipe, but it was *way* to spicy for the kids & me.  I even decreased the pepper to 1 TBSP like other reviewers had suggested.  It was really good, but next time I will add more honey & mustard and less pepper.

Absolutely delicious.  I only used 1 T of pepper since I have little kids and it "kicky".  We also sliced it up and basted each piece and then put it in the oven for more flavor once it was done cooking....

This was delicious on oven roasted pork tenderloin.  I added both tablespoons black pepper with a little reluctance and 2 cloves crushed garlic.  Glad I didn't skimp on the pepper.    Thanks for sharing.

Love it!  Excellent flavor and ridiculously moist!  Used coarse ground Dijon, rosemary instead of thyme, and reduced pepper to about 1 1/2 TBSP.  Served with mashed potatoed and sauteed green beans.

I thought this recipe was perfect exactly as written.  My husband loved it and said "it's a keeper!"  I don't think the 2 T. of pepper is too much at all.  I cooked the roast covered in my dutch oven, flipping it after the first hour and adding potatoes and carrots at the same time.  I did add about 1/3 cup of water as recommended here so the roast didn't stick.  I defintely will be making this again - thanks!

Lovely and moist.  But 2 teaspoons of pepper was plenty enough for me and hubby.  It is VERY peppery.  You can ALWAYS add more, but you can't take it out.  Could have used a little more honey.  Did put 1/3 c water in pan as suggested, and used it to make a nice gravy afterwards.  Filled the pan with veggies during the second hour.  Cooked 1 hr uncovered and 1 hr covered, until internal temp was 160 degrees, then rested on a warm plate with a foil tent and temp continued to rise up to the 170 degrees recommended.  Wonderful meal, with no messy browning on the stovetop necessary!

I followed the ingredients to a T.  The only change I made was I used a sliced pork loin and "grilled" it on the stove using one of the square grilling pans.  Maybe it's due to the way I cooked it, but I felt like the honey over powered the dijon.  Next time I make this, I might increase the dijon a bit, or add some more while the meat it cooking.  Either way, this was still very good, and it will definitely be served again.

Far too much pepper; my husband & I trimmed off the outside because we just couldn't eat it. The inside, however, was juicy & tender, very good indeed.  Next time I make it I will reduce the pepper to about a teaspoon.

I did a 4 1/2 lb roast.  Did divide sauce into thirds, and on the last turn covered it with aluminum foil.  Did cook it a total of 3 hours.  The whole family loved it.  Even my husband.  He kept sneaking some behind my back before and after dinner.

My husband loved it, me and the kids thought it was pretty good. I ran out of Dijion mustard so I used dry mustard instead. I didn't crush the thyme- because I didn't read to until after I had put it in the oven but besides that I think I followed the recipe. I did have to cook it longer then directed- I used a pork lion tip roast (don't know if the cut is the same width as a regular pork roast?) and cooked it about 1 and 1/2 before it read 150- It was 160 by the time we ate it and perfectly juicy. Will make it again because my husband loved it.

The first time I made this I cut the pepper in half and added some water to the pan. It was good but still very peppery. Now I only use 1 tsp fresh ground pepper, add water to the bottom, and add some fresh garlic. I cookd one hour covered (basting occassionally) and 45 minutes uncovered basting frequently. It really is good and has been addes to my recipe book.

All I can say is YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!  I couldn't get enough of this roast and my husband loved the leftovers for sandwiches the next day at work.  I did cut the pepper to 1T so my toddlers would eat it...and they did.  The sauce it made was out of this world.  Will use this recipe over and over.

Usually, I cannot stand pork, especially pork roast..  But for our Sunday dinner, we had a pork roast.   I opted to make it since I was bored with the ho-hum pork roast we usually have.  

I can tell you this, this made me enjoy having pork roast!!  This recipe was fantastic..  the pork was tender, juicy, and very very flavorful.  I will be making this one again!

Tried this dish out for the first time today. I had a cook from frozen pork tenderloin. I did miss out the thyme and reduced the black pepper a little bit. At first I was rather disappointed with the dish no cooking smell coming from the over. Went back into the kitchen at the end of the first hour and OMG the smell was to die for.
Now my partner is rather fussy with his food and even he loved it. And even Spike the cat loved it. Will be doing this again and will try it with chicken breasts and salmon fillets. This one is a keeper

I had a 2 lb. roast. I adjusted the pepper to only 1 teaspoon for a double recipe of sauce. I cooked it in the crock pot with potatoes and carrots on low for 6 hours. I will definitely make it again.

This roast by far exceeded my expectations.  It was moist and tender, spicy and sweet.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I will definitely add it to my recipe box.  :)

It was way too much pepper for either my husband or my taste.  I had to wipe it off.  The pepper overwhelmed all the other flavors.  I typically use mustard and apricot preserves for pork; wish I had! If you make this don't use more than 1 tablespoon pepper or your mouth will be on fire!

A little too much pepper, but otherwise very tasty and easy. I didn't have dijon mustard and used regular yellow mustard - very good! Next time will cut back to 2 teaspoons of pepper rather than 2 tablespoons.  :)

Is 2 tbsp black pepper a right? My mouth is on fire. Overall good flavor, but next time I'll use less pepper.

Loved it! Even my kids thought it was great! Definite keeper. The ONLY thing I changed was I cooked it in my counter top rotisserie rather than baking it. This gave an even crust all the way round.

This was ok. I didn't follow recipe exactly, and I wish I did, with the exception of the amount of pepper. I didn't use the full amount of pepper because of the kids. Put a foil tent over the meat and I used about 3/4 cup of water to help make a sauce with cornstarch after I took the roast out. Though it tasted pretty good, it looked very unappetizing, just kind of gray. I may make again because my husband and kids liked it fairly well, only I'll follow the recipe more closely and not add the water until maybe towards the end.

Very good recipe, only I feel it calls for too much pepper; and this is coming from a pepper lover.  It was a good flavor, but next time I will cut the pepper in half.

I just made this for dinner and my fiance loved it.  However, although he loved the spiciness, I am cutting the pepper a little bit next time.  It was a little much even for me.  

What was awesome: added about a cup of water to the pan like many others suggested.  When I rotated the loin half way through I dumped the rest of the marinade over the top.  Took it out, set aside the roast to rest and made gravy with milk, wondra-flour for sauces and gravy, and a few big scoops of sour cream to take the edge off the spiciness.  Turned out amazing and served it with mashed potatoes.  

Really good but very spicy.  If you have weak taste buds, cut the pepper by at least half.

This was a very good and flavorful roast.  My family thought it was very good...it was easy to make too.  I thought it was kind of dry myself, although the flavor was good.  I will definitely make it again, but I think that next time I will try it in the crockpot...one reviewer did it in the crockpot wrapped in tin foil!  Usually the crockpot produces a more tender meat!

Very good recipe, and leftovers tasted even better the next day. A little sweet for my tastes but my husband loved it. I might up the mustard and reduce the honey next time, because this definitely is not a "spicy" recipe. It is a must to add just a little water at the bottom, but I overdid this and my sauce wasn't as thick as I would have liked.

I thought this was delicious. I cut way back on the pepper (only used about 1 1/2 t.) and it was plenty for us. I also cooked it a little longer. Wonderful, my small kids liked it too!

Followed the directions (w/ a slight reduction in pepper) and found that this came out a bit dry.  Next time I would make some extra sauce and add it in the last few minutes of cooking or afterwards.  Nice flavor though.

This was the best roast I have ever had!!! yummy, everyone couldnt stop raving about it. I cooked a roast 4 times the size of this recipe, I multiplied all ingreadients by 4 except for the pepper. I still only used 2 tablespoons of pepper. Definately would have been way too strong with the allocated amount of pepper.This is well worth cooking. Very easy to make.

Was a great recipe. Very tender meat and the sauce was wonderful once I added about a T. of flour and whisked it.  I put all the ingr. in/on the roast the night before.  This will be made again for sure! Oh.. I did keep it covered the entire time.. doesn't say either yes or no on the covering in the recipe.

Very easy and moist!  I used half the amount of pepper and not spicy at all.  Turned heat off when meat thermometer hit 170F and left in the oven for almost 1 hour before serving.

This is a great recipe, especially if you love spicy
food.  If you don't cut the pepper to about 1/4 of
what is stated in the recipe.  The sauce is incredible!
Works well with pork chops too.

My husband told me he loved it but I think it is because we had an argument earlier in the day and he was trying to be nice. I didn't particularly love this recipe. I didn't use all the pepper the recipe called for because I didn't feel like melting away. I made it with creamy garlic raffaelo pasta shells which was good. Easy to make though but wouldn't make it again.

This was wonderful.  Because of previous comments I cut the pepper way down, to just 1 t.  We used the juice left in the pan to pour over.  I had to turn the oven up to 350 for the last half because of other things in the oven - I put foil over the roast and it was still just great.  Very juicy and tender.  I'll make this again, also was asked for the recipe by a very good cook.  Thanks.

This was the first Pork Roast I had ever prepared and I couldn't have been happier with the ease of preparation and the delicious flavor this recipe added to the meat.  I will definitely use it again!

This was pretty good on the flavor. Some notes to consider. Do not roast this for almost two hours. Use your thermometer and check that way. Secondly, I recommend using a pork loin...it will be more tender and also not take as long. Thirdly, the author clearly said you night want to use less pepper depending on your taste buds so it's not fair to complain it was too peppery. Lastly, as always, you shouldn't rate it badly if you didn't make it as they said, like using a crock pot when it clearly called to be roasted in the oven. Using a crock pot for a pork roast is not really a good idea to me. Would explain why some of your roasts came out tough or rubbery. Anyway, the flavor was awesome. TY, Chef Cosmo

Very easy and yummy! Two slight changes: added white wine to bottom of dutch oven, and because my hubby doesn't care for pepper that much, I substitute Montreal seasoning for the pepper. Cooked with cover on for first 30 minutes, and uncovered for the rest of time. Very tender and delicious. Will definitely make again soon!

I made this as one of the main dishes for Easter.  I brushed the roast with about 1/2 of the glaze, and left it to sit overnight.  When ready to roast, I took out of the fridge about an hour before roasting time.  I brushed about 1/4 of the glaze over roast.  Roasted my 3 1/2 lb. roast on a rack at 425 for about 20 minutes, then turned oven to 350 and roasted for about 90 minutes more.  I brushed with the remaining glaze before serving.  Everyone loved it!

Other than cutting back on the pepper a bit and adding some Apple juice to the pan, made as directed and was delicious.

I wasn't overly thrilled with the flavour profile. The only change I made was cutting the pepper in half (and we like pepper). It is not something I would make again.

Whoa pepper! The roast was moist and very good, but way too peppery. I would highly suggest using significantly less pepper, like maybe half. The ends had so much pepper they were hard to eat. I will try this recipe again, but with less pepper.

Maybe I should have put water in the bottom of the pan to make more use out of the glaze because it needed more. Also, way too much pepper! I do like the honey and Dijon mustard combo.

Excellent.  I omitted the salt, used less fresh ground pepper, and did not have thyme, so I used italian seasoning instead.
I marinated the roast for 5 hours, then seared the roast on all sides on the bbq then continued to cook on the bbq.  I used a disposable foil pan, thank you I would still be cleaning the pan. I threw out the sauce that I used to marinate, then made 2X to cook with.
I will 4X the sauce next time for more gravy.  I also added water to the pan while bbq for extra sauce.

Awesome recipe!  Make sure that you cook the roast in some sort of dutch oven pot.  We found out the hard way the first time and it took forever.  We also cut the black pepper down to 1 tsp..  it was way to hot even with half the recommended amount of black pepper.  This is now one of our favorite recipes and so easy to make.

I really liked this. Add some water in the pan definitely, and cut up small pieces of potatoes for the last 45 min. They are good! I used a picnic roast and left the net on. This was a keeper!

my husband and i love this recipe.. though i have to make some modification like reducing dried thyme cause my husband is not fond of it, so i tried to cut it half.. and if you just have to cut half the black pepper if you're not into spicy food..

absolutely i'll recommend this recipe for everyone to try.. :)

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I messed up the recipe. I could tell it would be really good. I made my 1.5 pound pork roast in the slow cooker, and per the advice of another reviewer I cooked for two hours on high and seven hours on low. This was WAY too long and it came out very dry. Next time I will either make it in the oven or in the slow cooker but with a lot less time. I could tell this would have been delicious, I can't wait to try it again.

I wanted to make this and the recipe with sauerkraut so I made some changes. Followed recipe through #3 cook for one hour, remove and flip in pan, then I slit down the middle about 2 inches and added 1 cup + of kraut stuffing in the 2 inch slit then poured the remaining sauce over the roast, and cooked an additional hour.  Next time I’ll double the sauce as others have suggested.  Served with green beans w/almonds.  Everyone loved it.

I made this in my crockpot.  I seared the pork well.  Then I mixed the honey mustard with Ginger Brandy.  Served with Sweet Potatos and  cole slaw. Awesome

This was delicious! I had a 3 1/4 half pork loin bought at Aldi.   I used my Pampered Chef rectangular baker with the Large Bowl they used to sell that goes on top as a cover to roast the pork. I turned the heat up to 350 so it would cook a little faster, used about 2 tsp. of pepper and did not turn the roast. I also added some slivers of garlic in the slits. I added the 1/3 cup water to the bottom as suggested by several reviewers.  Once the roast was cooked, I removed the drippings to a pot and tasted them. They were VERY salty...the pork loin must have been enhanced with saline. I used 3/4 cup of milk shaken with 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it (a great trick for gravy making that I found in a Mennonite cookbook.) The gravy was way too thick, so I thinned it down with some of the potato water from boiling potatoes for mashed potatoes. I also added a tsp. of Kitchen Bouquet just to add a bit of color.  It wasn't exactly gravy, but it still tasted great on mashed potatoes and fantastic on the meat itself, which was moist and tender. My husband gobbled it up!

Left in all the pepper for a spicy sweet flavor. We had a larger roast so it cooked a little longer. My husband says he would have added an additional star if it were available. This made great sandwiches the next day with coleslaw up top.
*2 MONTHS LATER*
tried recipe again & it was just OK. I believe the difference was the pork roast. 
The first was a boneless pork butt (5lb) & longer cooking. 
The 2nd less tasty was a pork loin & 1hr 45 min. Although it was good just not as yummy- probably the fat!

I made this in the crockpot with a 3lb boneless pork shoulder picnic roast. I placed on a piece of foil then poured the sauce over it and wrapped the foil up. Set it to cook on low for 2 hours and high for 3 hours then removed the drippings and added flour & milk in a pan and made a gravy to pour over top. The gravy was wonderful, the meat however didnt absorb alot of the flavor, could have been my fault though. Overall very good recipe, I did leave out the thyme and used about 1T fresh ground black pepper.

It may not be fair to rate this recipe because I used Pork Chops instead of the pork roast.  (I was thinking about doing a pork roast for Easter and wanted to try the sauce before springing it on my family.)  I also substituted the Dijon mustard with spicy brown mustard, so that may have made a difference in the flavor of the sauce.  Also, the recipe called for 2 Tablespoons of black pepper and I thought that was too much and I used only 2 Teaspoons of the black pepper.  Now I know that 2 T was too much.  I did not care for this recipe and out of 3 I tried, this was my least favorite.

I think that it's best to sear off a roast before taking it to the oven.  I did that with this recipe and the outcome was spectacular.  The glaze works perfectly with the combination of temperature and time, and the spiciness suited me and my dinner companions.  You will do fine to take the roast to 165F only--it will be much more moist than a 170F roast, and won't be any less safe.  (The bad stuff doesn't make it past several minutes at 147F.)

Thie recipe is great. I did follow others recomendations and cut the pepper and added water to the pan. I also made a double batch of the "sauce" since I had a rather large 3 lb roast with a bone. The only complaint was from my wife and that was because the sauce made a mess in the pan that had to soak for days to come clean.

The sauce for this recipe is awesome. I didn't have a roast so I used pork chops. I doubled the sauce recipe (except the black pepper, only used about 1 Tbsp total). I put about half of the sauce on some pork chops and put them on the grill. Then I mixed about 2 tablespoons of mayo into the remaining sauce. Served the sauce along side some grilled potato wedges I made as well. My husband and son ate every bite and they don't even like honey mustard!

Everyone liked this.  I put water in the  bottom of the dish and made an interesting, sweet gravy with that.  I roasted this for about a half hour longer.  Succulent.

Very good recipe, I used 1 T of the pepper and it was just right.  I also put the water in the bottom of my dutch oven, and after removing the roast, deglazed the pan with white wine, added some cornstarch and served with the sauce.  VERY GOOD.  Even my picky eaters (who claim not to like mustard) gobbled it up.

Outstanding recipe! I added water to the roasting pan and cut a large Vidalia onion in wedges and roasted them along with the pork. At the end I made gravy form the juices left in the pan. Incredibly delicious.

Way too much pepper. I like my food well seasoned, but the pepper left such a burning sensation on my tongue I didn't care for it. And I only used 2 teaspoons of pepper.

I added 1/2 cup water to the baking dish as others suggested and marinated the pork in the sauce for about 2 hours.  (Glad I added the water). I thought it was okay, my hubby loved it.  Next time I will add crushed red pepper and more thyme to kick this up alittle bit.  It just tasted sweet to me, with no real complimentary flavor to go with the meat.

Not a big black pepper fan, so cut way back on the black pepper.  This had a really nice flavor that I knew my husband would love.  Was really surprised by how well my kids liked it!  Even my super picky 7 year old gobbled this down!

wow..this was really good! I cut back on the pepper...and I did have to increase the cooking time approx 45 more...until the pork become fall off the fork tender. This was more than likely due to the fact that I had a 3.85lb roast. This tasted alot like a smoked ham! Yummy:)

Oh My God...This recipe is amazing!!  I have made this a few times.  I double the sauce recipe, but I don't double the pepper because that makes it a little too sharp.  It is plenty spicy without the extra pepper.  Be prepared to pig out (no pork pun intended) when you make this dish because it is so good!!!

this was good. i did take the advice of others and cut down on the pepper (thank god because that would have been way too much), i used 1tsp (2tsp since doubled and it wasn't spicy at all but i wouldn't want to add too much more).
i also doubled the sauce since i like a lot of sauce.  one other thing that i thought was that the thyme was quite overpowering!. you could really taste it in there in a strange sort of way.  i will cut down on the thyme the next time i make this -(i haven't read anyone else say this so it must have been just my partner and i who thought that).  i feel like the mixture also needs something else added but i'm not sure what, maybe some garlic?.
it wasn't too  sweet for my taste.
it's definitely different from other pork roasts i've had.

I used this on pork fillet and it was really very good--just a bit too sweet for me (and I really like sweet meat!).  I will definitely make it again with just a touch less honey.  Also, it couldnt be simpler!!

I used a lean pork roast which didn't have much fat at all.  Came out a little dry.  I think a pork butt roast would have been more moist.  It was good but we prefer the "Tangy Slow Cooker POrk roast" from this site way better.  Thanks Michele, Cambridge Ontario

Wow...I think this was the best pork I have ever made.  It always seems to come out dry for me, but this was delicious.  Perfect as is.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

This was good.  I ended of overcooking, so was a little on the dry side.  Will make again, but will make sure I don't overcook.

This was divine. I used a pork shoulder roast, and cut out most of the fat. I didn't use all of the pepper, but the sauce was delicious. Didn't overwhelm the meat, and the meat came out very moist. Not dry at all. I didn't even make a gravy, and we didn't need it. I think this may be the only recipe for pork roast I will use.

This is VERY quick and easy and was a big hit with my family, which includes 2teenagers! I only used half the recommended pepper, as my son is somewhat intolerant to hot spices, and it was still good. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was my first time cooking a pork loin roast, and I was very pleased.  I used half the black pepper called for, and the sauce was delicious.  We made sandwiches with the leftover pork slices.

This recipe is just great!  I made this the first time I had my parents in-law over for dinner and they absolutely loved it, and still talk about how great it was now.  This is a great recipe for someone who doesn't have a whole day to spend in the kitchen and makes a fabulous meal for company. A+!

Yum! This was fabulous! We like spicy, but the 2 Tb of pepper seemed unfathomable, so 1/2 Tb was used instead. Turned out great, a little overdone, will watch that when we make this again, which we certainly will!

I only used 1 Tablespoon of pepper as suggested by others and found it was still a little too hot.  Next time, I will try 1 teaspoon of pepper.  We like our meats well done, so our 2.5 lb took 2.5 hours ( longer than called for).

We really enjoyed this recipe. The pepper was great to us, but then, we like it hot! However, it took 2.5 hours for it to cook for our 2.25 lb roast so be advised it takes longer than it says.

We love this one, but 1 3/4 hrs seems a bit long for the roast. You may want to adjust the cooking time. Otherwise an excellent recipe for pork!

WAY too much pepper!!!!!  I decided to cut the amount down to 1 tablespoon and it was still too much.  Will try this again sometime, but will only put in 1 or 2 teaspoons of pepper.

This was pretty good.  After reading several reviews, here's what I did.  I had a 4lb pork tenderloin, so I increased the honey to 1/3 cup, mustard to 3 Tbsp and thyme to 1 tsp.  I rubbed 2 tsp black pepper into the roast, poured the sauce over it and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Before putting it in the oven I wrapped it in bacon and then baked covered for 2 hours and uncovered for 1 hour.  300 was fine.  It turned out quite delicious.  I also thickened the sauce in the dish while the roast was resting and poured that over the roast.  Yummy and not at all dry.

I used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, and added onion powder and put it in the crock pot on low for about 4 hours and it was AMAZING! My Mom does NOT like honey but she loved this! It made a lot of juice so we made a gravy with it, which was not very good, but not bad either. Probably too sweet from the honey.

This was a big hit on a day when I had no clue what to do with a pork roast I'd thawed out! It was one of those days when I wanted to make something delicious, however,  was so tired after housework and gardening all day, that I needed something easy to throw together and just sit back while it was  cooking...Here are just a couple of personal notes and tips:

1) I made the mistake of adding my potatoes a little too soon. They, turned out fine, but I'll add them about halfway through the cooking time when I make it again
2) I made a Gravy Sauce from the drippings in the pan, but I found that it wasn't necessary because everything was flavored and juicy on its own :-).
3) I added water, as suggested by other reviews, which was a great idea!
4) I've always wondered how people get that caramelized look on their roasts to make it look as good as it tastes, so I decided to experiment by roasting it under the broiler on high for about 5 minutes, just before the meat was finished cooking, which was perfect!
5) For our personal taste, I'm going to lay back on the pepper and add a little bit more honey next time. my family could use a little bit more honey than vinegar, know what I mean? 

The bottom line - my family is usually hard to please & they went back for seconds, which says a lot about how amazing this recipe is. Thank you :-).

4.30.18  Sorry, even with the all the good reviews, this one just didn’t measure up for me.  I had doubts about the 300º temperature, and after close to an hour, the roast had barely changed color, so I bumped the temperature up to 350º.  I baked to 145º, but it still did not have the nice brown color that many of the photos show, and it was tougher than shoe leather.  Not sure what happened here, but I won’t be trying this again, just moving on.

Didn't think it was anything unusual. Used the slow cooker: 2 hrs high, 7 hrs low. Only used 1/2 tsp pepper and wrapped it in foil while cooking. Served it with a whole cranberry sauce that was a plus.

Sorry but this was Not Good!  I hesitated using 2T of pepper and used 3/4T instead and it was WAY too much...cannot imagine what it would’ve tasted like had I used the full 2T!

Doubled the sauce, and only put 1 Tb pepper in it, and it was still to much. Next time I will use 2 tsp.

Super easy, and great taste.  Everyone loved it.  Silence at the table = happy bellies!  Followed exact recipe except decreased pepper to 1 TBS, but think 2 would be fine, as directed, and added a bit of water to the bottom which made a great sauce/baste.  That is a must!  Moist and delicious.

I didn't use as much pepper but it was delicious nonetheless. I halfed the sauce and put a new coat of sauce on it once I turned it over at one hour. Definitely will make again.

To much black pepper.  Wish I had read the reviews, and
only used 2 Teaspoons of pepper.

We had to tone down the pepper (1tsp instead of 2tbsp) in order to enjoy but after we did that it became a family favourite.

I made this in the crockpot and let it stay for approx. 7 hours on low.  Didn't add any fluid because I knew the fat would be rendered and would provide the fluid necessary.  Then made the drippings into gravy to spoon over the slices.  I used less honey than written...maybe 2 tablespoons.  We liked it very much.

The whole family loved this, including my daughter who is generally not a pork fan. No change in the ingredients for me, but I cooked the pork at 350 for 35 minutes. I didn't realize the cooking time, so used the info on the package.

Used a pork loin sliced in to medallion otherwise I used all ingredients listed.  My husband was still talking about how good it was the next day to friends.  I coated the meat  then did a quick sear on stove,  followed with poured the rest of the  mixture on and  put in the oven to finish it off.  Served with sautéed apple, mash potatoes and kale salad.  I plan on using this recipe with all  types of pork cuts.

I marinated the pork in the fridge for 3 hours then grilled it on the BBQ which was underwhelming. I'm guessing it would be better as a roast so it has more time to soak in its juices while it cooks. I'll increase my rating from my actual rating of 3 stars to an embellished rating of 4 stars since I didn't roast it like the recipe suggested.

Pretty good. I used 2 Tbs of whole peppercorns and then crushed them, instead  of 2 Tbs of ground pepper. I also put water in the pan as others recommended to make a sauce, and to decrease the cooking time I started with 20 mins at 400 then 50 mins at 350 (and my 3lb boneless pork loin ended up a little overdone!) The pepper overwhelms most of the other flavors, but it's still pretty tasty.

Came out really tender and flavorful without the sauce overwhelming the pork.  One change, I baked it covered in a casserole dish.

This is a great recipe and I can't wait to try it out as a marinade for pork chops! For my version of this recipe, I only had 1-1/4 lbs of pork tenderloin so I reduced the ingredients by half. Then I added 1/4 tspn ground cayenne pepper and I used freshly ground McCormick's Pepper Medley in place of the regular black pepper. Awesome flavors!! Tasted great! The pork came out nice and tender. Done to perfection! I did cut the cooking time in half but added 50° F to the oven temp setting. I also checked with a meat thermometer to ensure the center got hot enough.

I cut the pepper in half and it was too spicy for us.  I would use at the most 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.  The rub on the roast was okay.  I am glad that I put water in the bottom of the pan.  I cooked it covered most of the time but uncovered  the last half hour so that it  would brown.

Yeah!  It came out moist.  Granted, I'm not the greatest cook and after many years of dried pork roast, I tried this recipe and it is fabulous; moist with great flavor.  Picky, picky husband (the fact that he's picky has nothing to do with my poor cooking skills :)  )  loved it.  I took others advice and added water to the pan and yes, it made a wonderful sauce.  This will be my go-to roast pork recipe from now on.

I did my own twist, I marinated it with salt, adobo, pepper, and lemon juice the night before. It really gave it a lot of flavor too. And I broiled it for like 10 minutes after the first hour and it came out so beautiful and crispy on the outside and juicy.

I used the exact amts stated for the sauce. I also put slivers of garlic into the slits before I brushed on the sauce. I cooked it for 20 min. at 400*F., added water to cover the bottom of pan as others suggested (it keeps the roast moist), lowered temp to 350*F., cooked it approx. another hour basting frequently & adding water as needed. I saw no need to turn the roast over. There was a nice amount of pan gravy to use over mashed potatoes.

I loved it!! Will definitely make again...I loved the pepper.  My husband wasn't a huge fan.  It was super moist & I was scared because I usually cook this type of meat in a slow cooker/crock pot because I don't want to dry it out.   I did cover with tin foil then removed for last 1/2 hour.

Purchased a 3.5lb boneless pork loin.  Stabbed it all over with a fork, used the original ingredients and amounts to make the sauce (reduced pepper to 3/4 T) but also added 1T apple cider vinegar.  Basted the meat with the sauce, poured 1/2 c water in the bottom of a crock pot and cooked on low for 6 hours, basting occasionally.

The flavor in this recipe is wonderful. The meat stayed moist and absorbed a good amount of seasoning. I used a smaller portion of meat and cut back the pepper by half.

Excellent and delicious sauce! I cut the pepper waaaaay back (1/2t) and we LOVE spicy stuff! I can't imagine 2T of pepper! Otherwise a very simple and delicious Sauce! I also recommend what another reviewer stated and add 1/4 cup water to the pan to make a yummy sauce. Two thumbs way up.

Delicious! Though, I think the listed calories is low. A serving, using 3lb and 6 servings, should be over 500 calories per serving.

Absolutely delicious.  Made it exactly as the recipe states.  Sometimes pork is rather bland and this adds such a wonderful flavor.  The pepper does give it a little heat, but I like spicy foods.

I will definitely be trying this again without the thyme. It overpowered the honey mustard and was all I could taste in the sauce

Recipe is definitely worth making again, but I think must have used too much mustard... it was ok, but nothing truly special. We all needed to tone down the mustard flavor with some bbq sauce on the side (that was a very nice combo, though!), and hubs LOVED it... In fact he ate about half by himself. LOL

I reduced the black pepper to one tablespoon, and added one tablespoon of Herbs de Provence. I also substituted the half teaspoon of thyme with a half teaspoon of garlic powder. My husband loved it.

This was wonderful!!!!!!!!!!! the only thing I did a little different was I added minced garlic, and as others did added water to the bottom of the pan, and it made a wonderful aujus. How anyone wouldn't like this dish is beyond me. I can tell too, the sauce can be used on other meats . Again, a wonderful recipe!!!!! Oh yeah, on the last hour of cooking i turned the oven up to 350 and the meat was sooooo tender. ENJOY!!!!!!!!!

I took the advice of others and added some water to the bottom of the pan other than that I followed the recipe it turned out good. It was flavorful, tender and juicy. I like pepper,  so not too peppery for me but I can see how it would be for others.

This was very good and a great go to dish on vacation.  I cut back on the pepper and didn't add the thyme, but also added a little horseradish.  It gave it a nice kick. I also put water in the pan.   Very moist pork though.  Will keep it and maybe tweak the mustard and pepper to give it a little bolder flavor

This Pork Roast is delicious. I made this for my boyfriend twice now and each time he says how wonderful it is. I do think I will add slightly less pepper the next time I make it though.

This was very good, although I didn't add quite as much pepper, and a little more honey and dijon mustard.  I did however baste it often and for the last 5 min. of cook time I turned on the broiler to give it a nice crust.  I took the advice of others and added water..(it is better to add it).  My kids who hate pork devoured this in record time.  This one is a keeper...YUM!!

This is a really great recipe - thank you so much!  I did make a few changes though - I doubled all the ingredients except the pepper so that I had a lot of extra sauce.  I made the recommended slices in the roast and put it in a bag with all the sauce and let it marinade for about 4 hours.  Then - I put the roast and all the sauce in the oven as directed.  No change in cooking time or directions.  When it was done - I took all the drippings, reduced and filtered - in a frying pan and made a really nice gravy to serve with the roast.  It was FANTASTIC!  I served it with roasted potatoes and carrots and it was the perfect compliment!  Really great recipe - definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe as written the first time making this roast and the results were good.  I did have a problem with the honey-sauce burning and sticking to the bottom of my pan.  I also found the roast to be a little too peppery without enough of the honey and mustard flavors coming through.  But, the meat was juicy and the flavors were good.  Upon making this again tonight I used a much smaller boneless roast and halved the recipe - except I increased the amounts of honey and Dijon a bit.  I also added a mixture of water and Jack Daniel's honey whiskey to the bottom of the pan to prevent burning.  The results were quite tasty and the clean-up was much easier.  Served with the Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes recipe and peas.

This was so good! I used a little more honey and dijon (I had coarse ground dijon) than called for, and about half the pepper. I also added a little garlic salt. I used a boneless rib roast (probably more like 2.5 lb) and the meat came out so tender and juicy. The sauce mixed with the meat juices was so good! This one is a definite keeper, some of the best pork I have ever made.

This is so easy to make & tastes so good. I love the flavours of the seasoning. I also added water into the pan to make a sauce & added in potatoes, zucchini & cherry tomatoes during the last hour of baking.

Really loved this.  I, too, think 2 T is too much pepper and will adjust next time.  Made pork fried rice from the leftovers and the spicing made that better than normal.

Love this recipe.  I only used less than half the pepper though.  I used the pan juices with an envelope of brown gravy mix and it made an awesome gravy!  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.

This was alright. It was easy enough to throw together and the pork was tender, but the taste of the finished product just didn't impress me and I usually really like the combo of honey and mustard.

This was yummy, my roast turned out nice and moist with good flavour!  Like many others, I added some water to the pan and reduced the pepper by at least half, 2 tbsps of pepper seemed like way too much!

Very good!  I only added 1 TBS of pepper.  2 TBS is a lot of pepper.  I did have to turn the roast over to keep it from burning on the bottom.  It turned out very well.

Amazing recipe! I too added about 1/2 cup of water to the bottom of pan, and did not flip the roast (the top had a beautiful brown on it and it was fully cooked through). The sauce was amazing but I did cut down the pepper to about 1tsp, which was plenty. Added some chunked red russet potatoes for the last hour of baking, came out perfectly done and deliciously seasoned! Will certainly make this dish again soon!

I made this according to the instructions, and it came out fantastically.  Am making again today, and I can't wait.  Definitely going to add some potatoes and make the gravy this time...

Absolutely delicious - added water in pan as suggested by others and cooked 1 1/2 hour covered; 1 1/2 hour uncovered - my oven ususally takes longer - definitely a keeper!

Maybe our tastes are a little different, but my boyfriend and I weren't too impressed.  I had high hopes for this recipe since it got such good reviews.  We were going to a potluck and I was looking for ideas for a pork roast.  I was actually a little embarassed to bring it.  After it was done cooking, it just didn't seem seasoned enough.  I added more salt...a little garlic powder and some parsley to let set for awhile before serving to spice it up.  There were plenty of leftovers, so I'm guessing the other people weren't too impressed either.  Sorry for the bad review, but I'm just being honest with my our opinion.

It was Delicious!!  I added water to the bottom after reading many review.  The peppery honey mustard taste was excellent!  I didnt have any thyme though so I grabbed some Italian seasoning instead and used garlic and onion in the slits.  I cook in a toaster oven, so the time of course was a long longer but I didnt have to turn it over durring the middle.  I will again make this

A good hit on a lazy day. After a long day at work, my boyfriend loved coming home to it. Love the mustard taste and the pepper flavor was just to our liking.

Wow!  Very peppery.  I cut the pepper in half as suggested by some others.  It was so tasty and easy.  We absolutely loved this.   I am always looking for recipes that come together quickly, that can be thrown in the oven, so I can do other things.  This will be added to that list!  thanks.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and put water in the bottom of the pan.  I also added sliced potatoes for the last hour.  I didn't have any thyme in the house, but didn't miss it.  I used raspberry honey (all I had) and a lemon pepper steak rub instead of plain black pepper. It was delicious.  This one is definitely a recipe I'll use again!

This recipe is very good.  I was continually impressed with each bite.  I often feel like I have failed after making pork dishes as I tend to make them dry and a little lack luster in the taste department, not the case with this recipe! Thanks a million!

This was very good but next time I will increase the mustard and reduce the honey.  It was a little too sweet.  I put it in the slow cooker for 9 hours on low wrapped in foil as suggested by someone else.  It was so tender it cut with a fork.

This was very nice pork. I reduced the amount of black pepper per others reviews, as well as added a bit of water to the bottom of the pan. I liked the strong flavor of the dijon mustard and the subtle sweetness of the honey. We used the leftovers the next day on Cuban Medionoche Sandwiches from this site which were great!

Delicious!  I followed the advice of reducing the black pepper (to 1 Tbsp), and I'm glad I did.  It was REALLY spicy.  I might even go down to 2 tsp next time.  But, that aside, this was still terrific!  My husband was wowed and thought I'd worked so hard on it - nope!  It's incredibly easy, so I'll definitely be making it again.  Thank you!

It was good.  I may make it again but I was not "WOW'd" by this pork roast.  I made it with the full amount of pepper which wasn't bad on the meat but if you choose to make a sauce from drippings, as suggested by other reviewers, it's way too peppery. You also loose all Dijon flavor I forgot I even used it until I wrote this review.

This was great.  I did decrease the amount of pepper; based on some of the other reviews, and used about 1tbsp.  I'm happy I did, the pepper stood out without being overwhelming, and the honey gave the pork a subtle sweetness.  Thanks.

This was good - but it took forever to cook and I only had a 2 lb roast!  The glaze flavors were nice, but quite subtle - maybe next time I need to make more slits in the roast so it will soak in better.

Awesome!  I make this all the time.  I don't really like much spice though, so I decreased the pepper to 1/4 tsp (not spicy at all then).

This recipe was very good, but I am glad I took other reviewers suggestions and cut back on the pepper.  I doubled the recipe and only used 1 Tablespoon of pepper and that was plenty.

I also decreased the pepper a bit...and I must say that this recipe ROCKS. It's simple to make and VERY tasty. It's a HUGE hit in a house full of carnivorous men. Definitely a staple recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the directions with no alterations and it came out wonderful!  I feel that it needs a little something extra still though, like maybe marinating the pork roast in a similiar glaze over night.

Nice change of pace for pork roast, excellent gravy.  Just didn't think it was quite a 5 star recipe, but I would make it again.

This is delicious.  The black pepper really gives the roast a nice bite to it.

This recipe was excellent.  The pork was moist and had a lot of flavor.  I was concerned it may be too sweet but the pepper balanced the flavor.

Simple, excellent recipe that produces an extremely moist roast that is very flavorful.  I would not change anything, and I will definitely make it again.

Cooked it tonight--my family loved it!!  I didn't have thyme, so I used ground parsley, and the we really enjoyed the sweetness of the honey.  We're looking forward to the leftovers! This one is a keeper!

Easy to make and very tasty for an otherwise dull pork roast.  I substitute jalapeno mustard for the dijon and this works quite well.

I only used a tablespoon of pepper, and didn't cook my roast as long as the recipe called for.  I wasn't crazy about it, and neither was my husband.  The pepper overwhelmed the honey-mustard flavor.  I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't make it again.

I used half of the called for pepper and it was still a bit too peppery, and I like spicy foods....next time I will use 1/4 of pepper that was called for. Otherwise it was delicious, and smelled so good cooking!

My husband doesn 't really care for pork, but he loved this roast! The honey-mustard glaze adds wonderful flavor, but cut the pepper down by 1 tbl. and it's perfect!

this recipe very good.  Very spicy if you use all the pepper.  Quick and easy.  Recommend this to anyone who likes honey mustard.

It packs quite a punch, but it was delicious!  Thanks for the change from the usually boring pork roast.

Made as directed, but had to turn the oven up half way through. I would've liked a "crust" with the honey & dijon mustard, but didn't get that cooking at 300. Next time I'll use only 1/4 tsp pepper & make sure I only use 1/2 of less of the sauce at 1st. When flipping I'll put more so at maybe 350 it'll crust up.

This truly was the best pork roast that I have ever had. It was so easy and moist. I made it for company and they loved it as well. My husband said that it was his new favourite! Left-overs were wonderful on sandwiches the next day. I will definitely be making this one often. Thank you!!
