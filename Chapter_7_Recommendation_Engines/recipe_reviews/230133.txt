i have made these for years. they stay soft for days, if they last that long.  you can use cream cheese  and jam instead of butter and cinnamon in the middle for a different taste. the whipping creme is the key to these rolls. you will love them.

I love this recipe. Very easy and the rolls come out just like my mom used to make. To get the bread dough to rise properly, I take one loaf from the freezer, put it in an 8x8 or large pie pan, rub a little butter on top and cover with plastic wrap. This allows it to rise without getting those hard spots. When it has thawed and risen, I take it out and roll it into a rectangle, then add the filling. After cutting and putting the rolls back in the pan, I cover it again and let them rise until cooking (at least a couple hours, sometimes overnight). I have never tried to get two pans from one bread loaf as the recipe says. Seems to me they'd be very small.  Oh, and before putting the rolls in the pan, sprinkle more brown sugar and a little butter. This gives the rolls that nice, sticky bottom.

At this moment the rolls, such as they are, are rising.  I thawed the dough in a baggie overnight in the refrigerator.  When I tried to roll it out to the dimensions in the instructions, it kept springing back. I was never able to get it flat enough to roll up very well.  Any ideas?

I  was amazed at how easy they were to make but also how really yummy they were too! This recipe is great anytime but especially when you don't have the time to make dough from scratch!

These were easy and delicious! Much cheaper than the store bought version as well. Cinnamon rolls are a Christmas tradition at our house and these will replace the store bought version from now on!

Dear CLOUDY 14, the Heavy Cream is poured over the dough in STEP 3. (it is written out after the oven temp setting.) Hope that answers your question.

I tried this using the overnight method suggested on another site. The taste was yummy, but the dough was very tough. I don't know where I went wrong because they were minimumly handled. Not to be outdone, I tried this version and they were perfect...soft, fluffy, delicious.  Success feels even better after a failure!

Absolutely amazing! I made this recipe for my mom for mother's day, she was delighted when she woke up and found out what I was up to, but also a bit sad because she was on a diet (unknown to me at the time). She said she would have one, but she ended up having two, and one more the next day! These cinnamon rolls could not have been more delicious. Using frozen bread dough is so much easier and just as good as making homemade dough. I exchanged pecans for walnuts which turned out great! Definitely worth a try.

They just came out of the oven and they are so tender!!  The heavy cream really added to the tenderness.  This is my go to recipe from now on.  Using frozen dough was perfect and saved time.  It's hard to improve on this recipe; I just used pecans instead and made a mistake and added the heavy cream to the icing but I wouldn't change what I did...it added to the flavor of the icing.  I just added more sugar to get to the consistency I wanted.  My photo was too large to upload... :-(  Thanks so much...

SO GOOD!! OK, I'm a totally new baker, and doughs are still really tricky for me, but I did these!  Just a few thoughts for other noobs:

1.  I thawed the frozen dough overnight in the fridge in bread pans.  Make sure to spray the pans and plastic wrap covers.  Then, I took them out and let them rise for 1.5 hours.  I covered a silicone cookie sheet on the counter and shook some flour on it and the rolling pin, rolled it out to fit the silicone, then used the silicone to help me roll it up.  I used dental floss to cut them into 2-3 inch rolls, putting them into a buttered baking dish with a little space between each.  I covered them back up, and let them rise for another 1.5 hours.  

2.  I almost forgot the cream!  I put them in, after 10 minutes let out a shriek, poured it over, continued cooking.  What I didn't know was the cream makes a kind of caramel when it cooks with the cinnamon/butter/sugar in the rolls dripping.  DELICIOUS!!

3.  I took the first pan out too soon, because the tops were brown, but the whole centers collapsed!  We ate them anyway...lol.  Second batch, I covered with foil and gave them an extra 10 minutes.  PERFECT.

So, delicious, easy, best ever cinnamon rolls.

Perfection for those who want a homemade tasting cinnamon roll using frozen bread dough. Be patient with the dough when rolling. It needs to rest a few minutes inbetween rolling out. The addition of the cream seemed weird to me but trust me when i say it doesnt make it soggy just wonderful. The rolls are good with or without the frosting!

ROLLING THE DOUGH: I would help my mother make pecan rolls using frozen dough. The "KEY" to rolling the dough is to allow it to rise first before rolling it out. Thaw in fridge overnight then put in any large bowl, just be sure to coat the inside of it with a bit of butter/cooking spray to prevent sticking and cover to prevent a crust from forming. Once risen, deflate and start rolling on a lightly floured surface.

Absolutely amazing! We're getting hit with a snowstorm and it put me in the mood to bake so I actually made these as a spur of the moment thing. I always have frozen bread dough on hand and usually end up making monkey bread with it and, for use in a different recipe, I happened to have heavy cream so, tonight I tried something different. I followed this recipe almost to the T, with the exception of adding a little more cinnamon while excluding the walnuts, and the rolls were superb. 
My husband is finicky about certain cinnamon desserts but when he went back for seconds I knew it was a hit. 
I was sceptacle about the heavy cream but after tasting them...all I can say is...delicious! 
As for the "glaze", I doubled the recipe and added a little extra vanilla. 
Definitely will keep this as one of my favorite recipes.

Disappointed! Turned out doughy on bottom even though let them get deeper golden on top then would have like. Really questioned the dumping of the cream on top!

I cut the rolls into fairly good sized pieces - about an inch each and baked in large parchment paper lined spring form pans for 33 minutes.  Eight or nine 'buns' per pan seemed about right. They were excellent and very well received! I did add cream cheese to my icing for extra flavour and less sweetness.

I will definitely make these again.

These taste excellent. The only trouble I had was rolling out the dough. I should have allowed to thaw more completely. I also replaced Raisins for the Walnuts. So mix the Brown Sugar and Cinnamon together, sprinkle on the buttered dough. Then sprinkle your raisins on top of the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.

These rolls were very tasty and sweet.  The reason for only 4 stars is that it was hard to roll the dough thin enough to make the jelly roll style, and when they rose, they uncurled quit a bit, but everyone liked them.

Easy enough, but don't need the icing because they're sweet enough. Next time I'll cut the brown sugar back. This would be a 5 if it was a sweet bread dough instead of a regular bread dough.

Not only did I like this recipe for its time saving feature, but the fact that it calls for way less butter and brown sugar than many other recipes.   The  taste and texture was really good and they were quickly devoured by my clan.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It's definitely going on my "keeper" file!

To Cloudy, I believe the heavy cream would replace the milk for the topping for the rolls.

This turned out beautifully,  and was super fast. I added pecans to the crumble. I only used half of the cream, which was plenty.

I took a chance and substituted 2% milk for the heavy cream.  It's only 1/3 cup so I was careful with spreading it, and It turned out well that I couldn't make it without.  I made 10 rolls from one frozen loaf and liked it that they weren't too small.
      ....if someone has a milk allergy I think almond milk would work well as it has a higher fat content.  
  ...   So glad I did not make icing as I found these sweet enough.  
...now I have to try and make homemade frozen dough with whole wheat.  I looked at the storebought dough and it contains ammonium somthing...i have no idea what it is..but it doesn't sound good.
THANKS for the recipe!

I added raisins but otherwise followed the recipe.  Texture-wise they turned out beautifully.  But they were way too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will use half the sugar and forget the icing.

I make cinnamon rolls from scratch and I'd have to saw that this recipe almost beats mine!  This is a keeper, as I love how fast this can be put together in the morning when you defrost the bread dough overnight in the refrigerator!

I don't baked a lot and chose this recipe because it was supposed to be easy but by the time I (barely) got the dough rolled out, I wanted to scream. I forged on! Finally ready to roll it up...OMG...SHOOT ME...fail! I'm sure they will taste great even though they look terrible. Serves me right anyway, cuz I should have used handmade dough.

This recipe is so easy. I followed the instructions to the letter. My cinnamon rolls was the best. They taste better than the ones in Burger King.! My husband loved them. I'm in LOOOOOVE with this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this easy recipe.
