I recently bought and prepared some sweet potatoes, wondering if I still hated them as much as my childhood memories told me I did.  The roasted sweet potatoes I made with them were a vast improvement, but neither Hubs nor I were fond enough of them to eat them again. So what to do with the four or five baby sweet potatoes I had left?  I chose this recipe, thinking I might as well embrace the sweetness of the sweet potatoes in something like this rather than fight with them in another savory vegetable side dish. And if it wasn't for having these leftover sweet potatoes I never would have experienced this simply excellent bread.  Hubs would never have tolerated the coconut or the nuts, but since he wasn’t about to eat anything “Sweet Potato” anyway, I included them both.  As I measured out the cooked, mashed sweet potatoes, I found myself about 1/3 c. short (1/2 recipe).  Not a problem–I just grabbed a jar of strained baby food carrots and used them to make up the difference.  I liked this –it’s moist, not as heavy as other breads of this type, not as sweet (and I liked that!) and is delicately spiced (and I liked that too). I also liked the flavor only butter can impart.  Until I made this I probably would have thought it similar to pumpkin bread, but it’s really not.  It’s lighter and brighter in color, almost like mango, and has a flavor all its own. Not sure I’ll buy sweet potatoes again, but as this recipe’s first reviewer I can tell you I couldn't have been more pleased.

This is a great recipe!  I didn't have any walnuts, or any other nut for that matter, but it still was good.  This is so moist!  I made a few smaller sized loaves, and they were done in about 50 minutes, so make sure you adjust the time if you decrease the size.  I also added a handful of chocolate chips in one of the loaves - mmmmm, that was also really good if you like chocolate.

Very nice moist loaf.  I substituted 1/2 the butter for coconut oil and enjoyed the enhanced coconut flavor; also substituted 1/2 c of white flour for flax flour.  This is a keeper.

I love to bake pumpkin bread, but have never tried making sweet potato bread before. My first thought was, "YUM!" This bread has all the best flavors of autumn, and is incredibly moist and satisfying. Because I like to eat breads like this for breakfast, I tweaked the ingredients to make a more wholesome and nutritious bread. I used white whole wheat flour, replaced the 2 cups of white sugar with 1 cup of sucanat (natural dehydrated cane sugar), and replaced the butter with applesauce. Amazing!

Switched out the walnuts for pecans, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It's delicious - not overpowering one way or the other as far as taste goes.  Not too sweet, not too cinnamon-y - very nice quick bread that uses up sweet potatoes when you've got extra.

I loved this! It turned out perfect! Not too sweet but very filling. I didn't add any nuts but I think it would taste great with them. Other than the 1/3 cup of baby carrots I added when I ran out of sweet potato, and the lack of nuts, I didn't change the recipe at all and it was very satisfying!

I would give it 6 starts if i could. I tweaked it a little but it was unbelievably good. I used half butter and half coconut oil,  pine nuts and a raisin/cranberry mix.  After I had the batter in the pans, I sprinkled a mixture of brown sugar and shredded unsweetened coconut on top before popping them in the oven.   My family loves it! And it's become one of my go-to recipes to take to friends' houses.

To make this heathier I used 1 cup coconut oil in place of butter. I also used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup coconut oil. Less calories and still great flavor. I also increased the salt to 1 teas. This recipe is great

While this was simple to put together and it baked up just fine, I thought the flavor was just "OK."

I bake healthy when possible, so I made the following changes: replaced half the butter with plain Greek yogurt; 1 cup almond flour replaced equal amount wheat flour; 1 cup bulk monk fruit sweetener replaced equal amount sugar; 1/3 cup egg whites replaced 2 eggs. Also increased cinnamon to 1-1/2 tsp and doubled nutmeg.  The bread is delicious! Not overly sweet, it has a great texture from the coconut (almond flour could have affected that also). Wondering how it would taste toasted...will be giving that a try. Thanks for a great recipe!

This loaf is not sweet and is very dense. I just took some out of the freezer from last year, and it froze very well. I believe I made a half recipe at the time. Now I'm thinking that maybe coconut oil could be worked into this bread somehow, possibly replacing some of the butter. A delicious loaf and distinctly different from pumpkin bread that can be too spicy sometimes. Thanks Maybelle, nice recipe!

Great recipe!  I baked a large sweet potato the night before and only got about 1 3/4 cups of potato so I used canned pumpkin to make up the rest.  The potatoes didn't mash very well so I pushed them through my potato ricer and they came out great. I used sweetened coconut since it was all I had on hand and it worked well.  I'll be making this again!

First of all, I made half a recipe, so I could make just one loaf.  I followed the recipe exactly, and only did one (fabulous) change:  I added a half cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, because I couldn't resist.  I mean, really, how can you go wrong adding chocolate to this yummy, moist cake-like loaf?  Everyone LOVED it and I will definitely make again.  It is really more like a super moist cake than a bread.

Great anytime. I also split sugar to One Cup White and one cup Brown Sugar. I roasted the walnuts before making. I have made it using roasted pecans.

Outstanding!

I followed someone's suggestion and subbed out half of the butter for coconut oil. I also toasted some of the coconut before adding it to the bread mixture for some additional texture. This recipe is one I'll make many times. I may add raisins sometimes too.

Loved how moist this turned out! Made it exactly by the recipe for the first try, however it lacks enough spice, coconut, and nuts for me. This will be a go to recipe, but I'll definitely up the extras hereafter!

Fabulous loaf. Substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 the butter, to cut down on fat. So good.  Made it in 2 Pampered Chef loaf pans and shared  with our nephew and his family and kids. Everyone LOVED it. Thanks for a great recipe.

Loved it! - great flavour, nice and moist. Needed to substitute Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour in place of regular wheat flour - and added about 1/2 c. of raisins, in addition to the coconut and walnuts. Gave one loaf to a friend for his birthday - his comment: "Excellent!".

Excellent bread. Easy to make. I did not add the walnuts, as my husband prefers bread without. And, I used yogurt in place of the butter. It is moist, flavorful, and healthier than most bread recipes.

I cut back on the oil, using 1/4 cup of olive oil, and 1/4 cup of peanut oil, as well as a very thin (1/4 inch thick) pat of butter.  Also, I used two teaspoons of soda and only one of baking powder.  (I'm not fond of b. p.)  My husband and I loved it, and so did the friends with whom we shared.  Even though it's made with sweet potatoes, it reminds me of the fig cake an older generation of South Louisianians used to make.  Another point in its favor is that it was equally good to the next day.  Surprising!

My husband and I were looking through all the recipes on this site one day and we came across this recipe. He likes sweet potatoes and wanted me to try it ; however, I do NOT like sweet potatoes. I was hesitant but decided  my hubby was worth it. OMG, I am glad I did! I followed the recipe exactly, but added raisins that I had soaked in orange juice for about 30 minutes. This bread is sooo good and tastes even better the next day. My husband loved it too! I even took a loaf to my husbands family and they loved it. I will be making this bread for the holidays every year. Thanks!!!!

Made some substitutions for what I had on hand and it tasted very good!  My 2 year old even gobbled it up.

-Agave syrup instead of white sugar (2/3 cup to 1 cup ratio)
-Eliminated 1 egg because of the agave
-Canned sweet potatoes instead of cooked and mashed
-whole wheat flour instead of all purpose

Dang girl, this is really a wonderful bread. I love love love the combination of the sweet potato, and coconut...and the spice level is great.  I left out the nuts, I find they distract me when I am enjoying a quick bread. I made it in a loaf pan and it was perfect.  Next time I may fancy it up in a tube pan, but it is a beautiful thing even when it is loafing.  thanks.

Made it as written, substituted 1/2 the flour with wheat and 1/2 the sugar with splenda. So delicious even my 2 and 4 year olds liked it. This will definitely go on my make again list!

I desperately was looking for a good bread recipe that used gluten free all purpose flour..... so I substituted regular flour here with gluten free all purpose, added 1/4 C applesauce because I was 1/4 C shy of mashed sweet potatoes, and also used pecans instead of walnuts (forgot to get done).  I’ve tasted gluten free breads and many not so good, but this recipe held up really well and got my family liking sweet potatoes another way!! Woohoo, great recipe and fabulous taste!

I loved, loved, loved this bread.  It was delicious and everyone who had some raved about it.  I love pumpkin bread, zucchini bread and all those breads.  This one tops them in my opinion.  I love coconut flavor and this hit the spot!!  A new favorite.  Thank you for this recipe.  I made it as written.

This was a pretty good basic recipe to start with.  I am one of those people that can't seem to follow any recipe as written.  My creative juices start taking over, and off I go. I don't like anything super sweet either,  so I started off with a cup of sugar, and added a maybe 2 tablespoon pour of molasses I brought back from the Barbados.  Now I know where that phrase slow as molasses comes from. It's at least 2 times as thick as Trader Joe's, and the flavor was so intense. The bread turned out sweet enough for my taste, so glad I cut back. I substituted coconut oil as the recipe stated as an option, but I think next time, I will use butter, as the coconut flavor did not come through as well as I know the butter would have. In addition to the walnuts and coconut, I added some chopped dried pears and a finely minced slice of Candied Siracha honey Benton's bacon jerky I made. Additionally, I added coconut tossed in sugar on top, as another reviewer suggested.  Most flavors all came through, except next time, I will either leave out the jerky because it was barely detectable, or double to 2 slices if I have any on hand at the time. I will most definitely use this recipe again.

I was looking for a way to use up some sweet potatoes. I'm glad I found this recipe. I used sweetened coconut and half brown sugar and half white sugar. It came out very moist and cooked in about 60 minutes in two loaf pans.

I will be making this bread again and suggest you try it.

I'm a terrible baker but have been able to make do with familiar standard recipes. This one (made exactly as written) was delicious. Really nice change from pumpkin. The sweet potatoes really have a different flavor (from pumpkin) and there's enough coconut in it that you can really taste it! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

What an incredibly tasty bread! All I did was lessen the butter to 3/4 cup and the sugar to 1 and a half cups. Otherwise followed to a T. Thanks!

I got so many requests for this recipe when I made it for my work! As the introduction says, I used 2 loaf pans instead. You need about 3 medium sweet potatoes. I didn't use the nuts because of preference.

a good way to dispose of mashed sweet potatoes; it makes a decent sweet bread, wich keeps tolerably well and is good eaten alone or sliced and lathered with something (my family is partial to cream cheese, but I daresay you coud use plain butter or jam or lemon curd, whatever). Amazing to say, the coconut doesn't come across: you are very hard pressed to detect it. I substituted butter with olive oil and think it didn't suffer from it, on the contrary, it's healthier I think. Nothing to rave about, but a nice comfy cake.
