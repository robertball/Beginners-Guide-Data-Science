Made these for dinner tonite!  My family really like them.  The only changes I made were garlic salt instead of fresh garlic, jar mushrooms instead of fresh and 1/4 cup of cream cheese and 1/4 cup ricotta.  The filling was to die for!!!  Quick and easy will def make again.

I really liked the lasagna roll-ups. The only changes I made was to use turkey sausage because I really don't like ground turkey. I also used part skim ricotta & mozzarella to make it even lower in fat  & calories. I like using the spinach to add extra nutrition. You can add or subtract spices according to your tastes, as well as add more or less jarred tomato sauce (or make your own tomato sauce) according to your family's tastes. Overall very good & much healthier than regular lasagna roll-ups! Thanks, Babs.

Made this tonight for the first time. I added more garlic but thought it still wasn't enough, at least for my husband and I. I'd also add more  seasoning. Easy to prepare and the turkey makes it slightly healthier than the usual ground beef in lasagna. There was enough for us to each have all we wanted and at least one more dinner for later in the week.

This was so good and so much better for you using ground turkey.   I used a package of ground turkey - which ended up being 1.3 lbs.  I used 3/4 of a 15 oz. container of ricotta and 3/4 cup of mozzarella because the mixture seemed a little dry.  It had the perfect consistency and rolled without the filling coming out of the sides.  Very important you follow the recipe submitter's advice and leave 2" on the end of the lasagna noodles.  As you roll the filling will push to the end - if you don't leave the extra room the filling will push out the end.  Thanks for the recipe Javaqueen - I will definitely be making again!

Delicious! I had 1.5 pounds of turkey and I used more ricotta cheese - it came out delicious! I will certainly be making this again!

Great taste!! And a little tricky to figure out how to roll the noodles with the filling in it, but it could be due to my noodles being too wet.  Hubbie said "the inside was missing something."  We desided the next time there will be more mozzarella added to the inside and subtract that ammount from the amount of mozzerella put on the top.  I also added onions to the meat mixture out of pure habbit.  Will make again!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Love it! Turned out great! I used Whole Grain Lasagna noodles, low fat cheese and added 3/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Made this for meal prep for next weeks (or 2) lunch.
