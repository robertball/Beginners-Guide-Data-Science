I made a number of substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I used one head of cauliflower and no broccoli, but did not decrease the sauce because of other reviews.  I used Jarlsberg Swiss rather than cheddar, and 2% milk.  I used multigrain tortilla chips.  I forgot to add the mustard!  Still, the flavor was wonderful and it made a satisfying lunch for my husband and I when accompanied by a tossed salad.

Not bad, but also not something I'd make again, as written. The flavor was weird with all the extra seasonings in the roux, and it could have been significantly simplified. I really didn't care for the nutmeg or mustard in the roux. And the sauce was not nearly enough for the volume of vegetable called for! Almost needed to double it. 
The second time making this- I followed more of the base from the Brussels Sprouts Gratin recipe on this site- just left out the bacon. And it turned out WAY better! Using heavy cream instead of making a roux & cheese sauce was much easier, I just added a bit more shredded cheese to mix in before baking, and left the seasoning to salt, pepper, and a bit of garlic & onion powder. 
Following the other recipe the second time around, it took half the amount of time. Boiled the veggies, added seasonings, cream, cheese & then topped with bread crumbs & Parmesan before baking. The consistency & flavor was complimented. 3 stars for the base... but leave out the unnecessary spices & double the sauce. Otherwise- just use the Brussels Sprouts Gratin recipe & sub in the cauliflower & broccoli.

I only used one head of cauliflower so the sauce was enough to coat all of it. I also added about 1/8 cup of water to thin it out a little bit (to make sure it could coat the cauliflower). I have two little ones so I also left out the red pepper flakes. Will certainly make it again!

The cheese sauce in this is excellent and came together beautifully. The one problem for me was there was not enough of it to coat and entire head of broccoli and cauliflower. I recommend either doubling the cheese sauce or only using 1/2 head each of the broccoli and cauliflower. I will most definitely make this again with my changes. Excellent! Thanks for sharing!
