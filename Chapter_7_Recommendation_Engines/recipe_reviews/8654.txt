This is a family favorite. I modify the recipe slightly by adding a clove of garlic and omitting the butter. I prefer to saute the chicken for a few minutes first, then place all ingredients in a crock pot; the chicken gets very tender this way. I serve it over spaghetti noodles with parmesan. Very good.

This recipe was very good. I used whole boneless chicken breasts
instead of cutting them up. I also added onion and garlic during the 
sautee process. Good served with mashed potatoes.

This was delicious! I used boneless skinless thighs instead (personal preference), left them whole, added 3 cloves crushed garlic into the mushrooms, and doubled up on the sliced mushrooms and artichoke hearts. I left it uncovered during baketime (oops), but it was just fine with the little browning. If I'd have used breasts, it probably would have dried them out. This will be a regular for me, my whole family loved it.

Wonderful! This will become a regular meal for us. The chicken is very tender, the sauce is tasty (I used half stock and half sherry) and one of the easiest meals I have ever made. Highly recommended.

The sauce had a nice flavor but next time I will double it.  Only changes, I used Enova oil instead of butter and corn starch instead of flour (to make South Beach Diet friendly).  Whole family enjoyed and they don't even like artichokes!

I have tried hard to like rosemary, really I have, but to me it tastes the way Pinesol smells.  So instead of chopping it up where I might have to bite into a piece of it, I just placed half a sprig on top of the dish before baking to just perfume the food.  DH thouht it was wonderful, but next time I'll use bay leaves instead.  Also 3 pounds of chicken seemed like a lot, so I just used 2 large-ish chicken breasts.  Everything else I kept the same.  I did reduce the cooking time a bit to keep from over-cooking the chicken.  This tasted incredible before I put on the rosemary, and it's certainly not the fault of the recipe that I can't stand the stuff.  Thank you so much for the post, Christyj.  I'll be making this again.  With bay leaves.

This recipe was great!  Chicken is tender, and mushrooms, artichoke hearts and sherry delicious.  I followed an earlier suggestion to use half sherry/half stock which gave it extra flavor. Next time, will try adding garlic in saute step as someone suggested, for a little more punch.  Served it over white rice.  Very tasty!

This chicken and artichoke casserole has been a favorite in my family for about 35 years.  I usually make twice as much sauce and serve it over rice. It's still a hit at potlucks, etc.

Excellent recipe.  This is very tasty and easy as well.  I added a tad more Sherry for flavor, but I like to cook with wines a lot.  A definite rotation in our house. Thank you!

This was one of those really hearty meals that I will probably make every once in a while. I wasn't sure what to cook with it and served it with some French Bread. That was delicious with the sauce of the chicken.

I made this last night but didn't have some key ingredients like mushrooms and sherry but it still turned out really well.  My kids loved it (3 and 1) which was shocking but I put it over whole wheat spaghetti and they call it white spaghetti.  Will make it into our rotation for sure.

This was by far, one of the best recipes I have gotten from allrecipes! Made it for my husband and his family and everyone loved it... even my sis- in- law who isn't a big fan of artichokes! It was also my first time cooking with sherry and needless to say, I will be cooking with it more often from now on. Very yummy dish!

This was good, but next time I will leave out the paprkia and add more of the other spices. I like the taste, but the paprika makes the juice look like it is full of oil when it's cooking and look bad on the plate. Just a preference. But still a good dish.

I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and a little bit of water instead of real mushrooms and broth and it turned out very juicy and flavourful. I also sprinkled just a bit of poultry seasoning and bay seasoning on top of everything just before putting it in the oven. I cooked chicken breasts whole also instead of chopping them up. Went well with rice, but I think it'd best be served with mashed potatoes and green beans.

This was fabulous, made a few changes based on family taste ~ doubled mushrooms, artichokes, and sauce. Left out Rosemary (kids don't like it) and served over wide egg noodles. Will definitely be making again!!!

This was fantastic.  Doubled up on sauce-and used half broth and half sherry. Added grated garlic and one-half chopped onion.  Didn't have any rosemary-so I used Thyme and italian seasoning.  Don't forget the bread-YOU WILL WANT TO DUNK.

Delicious and easy.  The sauce was especially easy.  I've managed to mess up many sauces, but this one was hard to mess up.  :-)

I followed the suggestion of some other reviewers and added a chopped onion and 3 cloves of garlic, I did not have any sherry so I used white wine instead as well as fresh rosemary. While we really enjoyed it if I were to make it again dh requested more mushrooms and I would have liked more artichokes. Instead of cutting the chicken into bite size pieces I'd probably slice it into thinner pieces.

We absolutely love this recipe.  I've made it twice now.  I don't change a thing about it and I serve it over  spaghetti, either whole wheat or regular and have salad with it or asparagus.  The flavors come together in this dish so nicely.  I use a really good sherry and I think it makes a difference. Thanks for the recipie, it's a keeper!

This was a pretty good recipe!  I think next time I will add even more garlic (I read the reviews and added a small amount).  I halved the amount of chicken and doubled the amount of sauce & mushrooms, then served over whole grain pasta.  We still have enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow too!

Very good dish.  I did double the sauce and served it over lemon garlic rice.  The lemon was a good complement to the artichoke and cut the richness a bit. My kids, 6 and 2, cleaned their plates quickly.  Kids and husband say it is a "keeper".  Thanks!

Good. Great for company. Can't figure out why 1 tsp. of paprika would make the dish oily. It shouldn't, and doesn't for me. When buying the artichokes, make sure you get ones that aren't marinated.

I thought this recipe had a great flavor!  I wanted to cut down on time and dishes so I cooked the whole thing (not the noodles) in the skillet.  It was super fast!  Thanks!

Followed advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 sherry and 1/2 chicken broth.  And I added 1/2 cup Chardonnay.  Used artichoke bottoms in place of artichoke hearts, as they are not as sharp tasting and bottoms are soft all the way through.  I filleted  the chicken breasts.  Chicken was over cooked - my fault.  Needed to shorten cooking time with such thin breast pieces.  Really liked it, as it is easy and makes good left overs.  Thank you.

Excellent!  I made changes b/c of lack of ingredients;  no sherry, no paprika.  I also took advice from all the other reviews & after pounding my chicken I seasoned it with Penzey's Florida Seasoned Pepper (has lemon peel and other citric).  I sauteed the mushrooms in garlic-infused olive oil and 2 pressed garlic cloves.  I also added an additional 3/4 cup chicken broth before baking uncovered.  Served over angel hair pasta.  YUUMMM!

For some reason, this came out EXTREMELY salty for me. I added brown rice to try and cut it which helped a little, but still very salty. Next time I will omit salt altogether; I think the salt in the broth is plenty. I will also use more wine. I know this recipe has potential, though, so it will definitely get made again!

My family loved this recipe.  To add color, I added a handful of dried cherries to the saute.  I also topped with a parmesan bread crumb mixture and removed the foil during the last few minutes of cooking.  When I'm short on time, I use the meat from an already cooked deli chicken and canned mushrooms and reduce oven time to 20 minutes.

I thought this was a good, simple dinner.  I used a can of quartered artichoke hearts.  It was good for lunch the next day, too.  My kids did not really like it, but I expected that!

I used a lot more mushrooms and more artichokes in this recipe and only a little olive oil to brown the chicken. The dish wasn't very pretty to look at, but is tasted very good. I served this over brown rice and it was very filling.

MMMMM THIS WAS SO GOOD!  Other reviewers used garlic so I took up on that and it was a great addition, also I cooked it in the crock pot for 2 hours and WOW yummy it made the chicken so tender.  Another person said they didn't like the was the paprika made the sauce look oily, my suggestion is to use a slotted spoon when dishing it up and then you get just the right amount of sauce without the oily look.

I loved this recipe.  Will definitely make it again.  I used a half pound of mushrooms instead of a quarter, and fileted the chicken breasts instead of cutting them up.  I also did not cook for the full 40 minutes.  Baked covered for about 25-30 minutes and then uncovered for only about 5 minutes.  So delicious.

A hit with my family.  Although the kids were not thrilled with the artichoke hearts - a little too much bitterness for them.  I served it with white rice.

I read some of the comments and added minced garlic to the mushroom, but still the overall dish was bland.  Not bad after I sprinkled on some Jane's crazy mixed up salt seasoning. But this recipe needs more tinkering

Sorry, but none of us cared for this one.  I did as the below reviewer and just simmered on the stove top.  It was one of the most bland dishes I've ever made.  Are the artichokes supposed to be marinated?  It was edible, but won't make again.

This was very easy to make and tasted nicely.  Not sure why the recipe would have this in the oven for 40 minutes??  After browning the chicken, I added garlic to pan (as others have done) then followed recipe until the baking in the oven -- after the mushrooms & sauce were done, I returned chicken to pan, added the artichokes (I used only artichoke bottoms rather than hearts since hearts can have chewy leaves that are hard to eat), then covered & simmered for a few minutes.  Turned out wonderfully without baking.  Served over brown rice.  A very brown-looking dish but tasty. Thanks!

I thought this was pretty good, with a few adjustments.  First of all, i used canned mushrooms because I didn't have fresh on hand.  That seemed to work ok.  Second, I added minced garlic before cooking the mushrooms in the drippings.  Third, I added a little lemon juice to the finished product before serving to add a little zing.  Turned out good.  Would make it again.

I did not like this recipe. Perhaps it was the brand of artichokes I used, but they gave the sauce a really bitter taste that I didn't like at all! I also don't think the paprika went very well with the flavors of the sauce.

I might try it again leaving out the artichokes and paprika and perhaps replacing the sherry with dry white wine, as the chicken itself tasted ok.

everyone in my family enjoyed this recipe..I am a total artichoke lover but everyone else is not.. but no one seemed to mind them in this recipe. I did slightly alter it by using a white merlot instead of Sherry and I also butterflied the chicken as apposed to chunks. The gravy it made was excellent and plenty enough for potatoes, couscous or rice. I will be sure to make this one again, so I can have my artichokes and everyone will still actually eat them!

The flavor of this dish was excellent.  The chicken was moist but not very tender, and I used pretty large pieces of chicken breast.  I think next time I will start checking the temp of the chicken at 25 minutes to try to avoid overcooking it.  I will definitely make this again!  I served it with angelhair pasta and green beans.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very good dish!  It had lots of flavor and even looked pretty in the glass dish I cooked it in.  My husband does not like artichokes so I made it with lots of extra mushrooms and he loved it and it turned out great.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This is a great recipe that I will continue to make. I made a few changes based on personal preferences. I added some minced garlic when sautéing the chicken also sine I didn't have sherry in the house I used an aged fig balsamic vinegar instead. We really like mushrooms and I probably used close to a pound of baby Bella's. My mom liked this so much she actually used her fingers to get every last drop from her plate. You could serve this with either rice or pasta but I just served it with a lightly toasted baguette to sop up the "gravy"

We'll make it again! Served it with quinoa and it fit my husband's request for some healthy dinners! Next time I'll  be sure to use all the salt and pepper- I just sprinkled what I thought was enough to season the chicken and it was a little less flavorful than I'd like even though I threw in a tsp of squeeze garlic as I sauteed it.

After i sauted the chicken and made the sauce, i thought it was a mistake to then put it in the oven on 375 for 40 minutes.  WAY too long- and too hot and not necessary.  I think this step could be completely omitted.  You can cook the chicken in the saucepan then make the sauce- which had a nice consistency, and viola- be done.  Putting it in the oven made the sauce too thin and made the chicken taste like it had been in a crock pot all day. Unless that is the taste you are going for, don't do it!!!!  It would have been much better- NOT in the oven!

This came out nice.  Used garlic as suggested in reviews and only cooked it half the time suggested.  Mistakenly used the marinade for artichokes but served the sauce as gravy.  Thanks!

I made some alterations to this recipe.  We typically don't keep alcohol around so I replaced the sherry with buttermilk in the mushroom saute, to which I also added onions.  I kept the chicken as whole breasts instead of cutting into bitesize pieces (the servings were prettier) and it was kept very moist.  My changes worked well but I probably will try a different artichoke chic recipe next time.  Something was just missing in this one...

I used whole boneless skinless chicken breasts and followed another reviewer's advise by adding garlic powder to the chicken and I doubled the sauce ingredients and added parsley and less rosemary. I served it over brown rice and my husband really liked it.thanks Christine.

This was absolutely great!  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  This may have been the yummiest dish I've ever made.  It tasted like something right out of a fancy restaurant.

Fantastic Recipe. Easy to make and very impressive. I served it along side with some coconut rice. My guests loved it. Highly Recommend, although I did add some more mushrooms than the recipe called for. That made is extra special. Enjoy!

This was tasty, but not on the top of my list of chicken recipes.  One objection is the cost of the artichoke hearts...$4.50 for a can of 5 hearts is a little too much for my blood.

This is very tasty, and is served best with thin pasta in any kind of paprika herb seasoning

This is a keeper! Great and easy, and anyone can modify recipe to taste without fear of messing it up. I like spicy dishes, so instead of regular paprika I used chinese-style marinated paprika in a jar (spicy) - about 1 teaspoon per 3 lbs of chicken. Also, I made a mistake and bought artichoke salad instead of just artichoke. No time to go to the store  - I just used that salad (has artichocks, thin strips of sweet red pepper and a few olives), and the juice from it I added to chicken stock and sherry . Everything came out great! Thank you so much for excellent recipe!

Just tried this and must say I will do it again.  VERY GOOD and EASY! I only added a little garlic powder to the chicken.

I followed the suggestions to add garlic, serve over pasta (I used chesse filled tortellini) and to spped things up - make it all in the saucepan. It didnt bomb - but just wasnt as fabulous as teh description says.  It was edible, but no one wanted seconds. Hubby even made a PB&J in place of seconds.

Use half sherry/half stock for better flavor.  Add garlic in sauté step for a little more punch. Bay leaf vs rosemary. Serve with spuds or white rice. Very tasty and so easy!
