I took a look at this recipe, and decided to try it, since we love oven baked asparagus.  However, for 2 people, 1+ teaspoon of salt and 1+ teaspoon of pepper sounds like quite a lot!  I wound up using much less--about 1/4 teaspoon of each was quite enough for us, on about 3/4 pound of asparagus.  In addition, I coated the asparagus with 1 tablespoon of olive oil before I placed it in the oven, and when done, I tossed it with only 1 tablespoon of lemon juice combined with 1 teaspoon of butter.  This was ample seasoning for our tastes.  Of course, more of any of the ingredients may be added, if desired.  Oh, and I only did 5 minutes under the broiler.  15 minutes would have turned my beautiful asparagus into crispy critters!

I tossed the asparagus with extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil before roasting and I also went a little lighter on the lemon juice, salt and black pepper in the second coating. Very tasty.

Fantastic!  I have NEVER had such good asparagus.  I was afraid to use the broiler (I haven't done that before)so I baked it at 450 for about 20 minutes.  Instead of vegetable oil I sprayed with Pam.  Oh my God this is good!  Thank you SO much for sharing!

Better than my usual salt, lemon pepper and olive oil roasted asparagus. We really enjoyed the change.

I made this using olive oil, and the juice of a quarter of a lemon (that's all I could spare). Was delicious! Will make again!

I took the advice of those that had made this before and used olive oil, 1 T butter and 2 T of lemon juice.  Also, cooked it over a charcoal grill. It was amazing.  Will make this again and again.

Loved this!  The cooking time is on point!
But I didn't use FRESH lemon juice (I didn't have any), so I used equate brand lemon juice instead and it came out VERY citrusy and sour.
What I'll do next time:
- coat 2 bunches of asparagus with olive oil and salt and pepper and a sprinkle of garlic powder
- mix 3 tbsp of butter and 3 tbsp lemon juice together for the sauce (a little goes a long way)

Cooked in less than 15 minutes, but I may have had the broiler set too high. Otherwise, quite tasty. Love the sauce just as it is  - might add a bit of garlic powder next time.

Great flavour! Like some of the other reviews I broiled the asparagus for 5 minutes and cut the lemon back to 1 tablespoon and the butter back to 1 teaspoon. I served this with  Quick Garlic Aioli and Poached Salmon ll, also from this site. Thanks for sharing.

Everyone loved this. I did cut the lemon juice down to 1/4 cup and was still a little too sour for me. But overall the asparagus turned out pretty good!

Super easy, fresh, and delicious, pairs very well with light seafood dishes.  For example I served it alongside seared scallops on a bed of cauliflower purée.  I will definitely make this again.
