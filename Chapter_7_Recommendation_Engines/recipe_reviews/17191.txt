Great recipe. I tossed in a bit of crushed garlic for additional flavor. I was not sure what type of goat cheese to use so I picked chevre -- which was awesome. It made a creamy sauce to complement the spinach and tomatoes.

I served this pasta dish on Valentines days with filet mignon.  It was the perfect companion.  Next time, I think I might add a little black olive, but I can't wait to make it again.

I think this recipe would be much better with a little less goat cheese. I used the full 8 oz. and it was way too rich for me. I just couldn't eat very much of it. Maybe it's just me though. Very good otherwise.

My family including our dog love this dish!  I do add fresh sliced garlic to  the olive oil and then grill chicken breast to go on top of it.  The first night I had made it I had cleaned up dinner and then got a phone call that my daughter had broken her ankle and needed to go to the ER.  We rushed out and when when we got back I stepped on something squishy,it was a piece of pasta on the floor.  In our rush out of the house, I had left the leftovers on the counter and my dog had decided that was her dinner.  She ate all of it with the exception of a tomato or 2.  Now whenever I make it she comes into the kitchen and wags her tail and expects to eat with us.

This recipe was good but a little bland for flavor. I highly suggest adding garlic, basil, sun-dried tomatos, and a little parmesan cheese when making. Also, I used the "garlic and herb goat cheese" and don't recommend it unless you like a LOT of oregano flavor. There was also WAY too much spinach in this recipe for me. I do like the idea of a light pasta recipe...this is very light and with my alterations on the recipe I'll be making it again.

Pretty good - A "light" dish.  The goat cheese gets a little "too much," though.

Excellent! I infused the olive oil with minced garlic and basil, substituted plain feta for the goat cheese, and added some shredded basil with the fresh spinach. This is one of our favorite recipes.

This was my first time cooking with goat cheese, and I love it! However, it is extremely rich. Add only a little bit at a time or it will overpower all other flavors. To avoid a "bland" recipe reported by other users, I marinated the tomatoes in balsamic vineger while the pasta was cooking and added basil.

This pasta is quick, easy, and delicious.  I used wheat pasta and added a little parmesan for some extra flavor. I loved how the goat cheese melted and made a creamy sauce for the pasta.  I made a smaller portion for just one, and I really just eyeballed everything as far as how much spinach, tomato, and goat cheese to use.  I also cooked my tomato and spinach for just a few minutes in some olive oil and garlic.

I had leftover goat cheese froma party, that I didn't know what to do with. This recipe was simple and tasty. It was a nice light lunch for me that used up items that I had on hand!

Love this recipe.  My favorite pasta.  Of course this needs to be adjusted for your tastes with the goat cheese, and I always add chicken.

This was so yummy!  I sauteed mushrooms and garlic along with basil and the spinach for 2 - 3 minutes before adding the chopped tomatoes.  I also cut the amount of cheese in half as some other reviewers suggested.

Wow, my husband could NOT stop talking about this one!  Thanks for the great recipe, I'll try others tips next time.  I used whole wheat pasta (al dente!) and instead of mixing it together, served it over an Italian blend salad mix.  Will definitely make again!

*Update* Still a favorite!  Have added more seasonings and tried black olives with it, too.  Great for a light evening meal, or a beautiful side (compliments fish nicely)

So easy, and it makes a really good summer pasta. Try selecting the freshest of ingredients for a dish like this, as it is guaranteed it will not taste as good using frozen/canned. I love goat cheese and bowties so this really hit it home for me, although in addition I also put in some feta cheese and fresh black olives -pitted- to compliment the dish. Very simple, as the only thing that needs to be cooked is the pasta! Makes for a delicious pasta salad too that can be served for lunch or dinner. Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty.  Used only 6 oz of goat cheese and added pine nuts.  I was a little hesitant on using goat cheese, but I think using anything else wouldn't have been as good.  I used the full 10 oz of spinach.  My family loved it, but we are big spinach eaters.  I think if you only "like" spinach, vs. "love," use about half as much.  Pine nuts were a great addition, really gave it a restaurant quality feel.  I served it under some spicy lime grilled chicken and it was fabulous.  Pure culinary heaven.

So simple yet delicious! I have made so many recipes with pasta, tomatoes, and goat cheese, but adding the spinach really made this one different. Love it and will make it on a regular basis because it was so easy. I should note though - I only added half of a 5oz bag of fresh baby spinach and I thought it was plenty. I see some other reviewers have substituted feta, but I think the goat cheese is better in this.

Wonderful!  I added some kalamata olives and used a container of Chavrie goat cheese with basil & roasted garlic.  My husband only likes things with meat so I cooked a few sausages for him and sliced them on top.  Thanks Kymanne.

Thanks for such a great, versatile and easy recipe.  I added one clove of chopped garlic, some red pepper flakes and only 4 oz. of Goat Cheese.  Very flavorful and great with a nice red wine! My husband even liked it and he normally dislikes any new recipes I try. This is a keeper!

A MUST to add double the basil leaves you think you might need, and also used a goat cheese with a mix of sun dried tomatoes, and medderterrian spices, only 1- 4 oz container, because everyone was saving its too much. Honestly it NEEDS THE 8 OZ OF goat cheese !  I also  added 2 sauté garlic cloves, and a half of can of corn. Although the amount of tomatoes seems like a lot, I didn't add that much and it was a mistake. It tasted better the next day after it sat in the refrigerator over night. THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MAKE AHEAD SALAD FOR YOUR BRUNCH THE NEXT DAY! Lots of salt and pepper needed to.

A great recipe, and very easy to make.  I added olives and sundried tomatoes to give it more flavor.  I think it would be too bland without it.  I served with chicken in white wine sauce, but next time I think I'll just mix everything together for a one dish meal.
My family loved how colorful the dish was!

This was very good- and with an 8 week old- very quick, too!  I am unsure about the 10 oz. of spinach.  I used a pre-packaged container of baby spinach, which was 7 oz.  I only used about 2/3 of the package and it was more than plenty.  Perhaps it was because it was baby spinach.  Anything with olive oil, spinach and goat cheese is bound to be good!

We thought this was a delicious and quick light pasta recipe...I served it warm...I did make a few minor changes...first I used less spinach then it called for and I added a bit more olive oil...I also used a clove of fresh garlic, minced.  I did add some pecorino romano cheese and used feta instead of goat cheese...I added ground red pepper also....Delicious!  I certainly will make it again soon..

I made this for the family the first time the other night and everyone loved it! I gave it a 4 because I think it is just fine with a little less goat cheese (I used about 6 oz instead of 8) as others have recommended. Also, I added a little minced garlic that I sautéed with the spinach.

I like it but did it a little different.  I sautéed garlic in the olive oil and then lightly sautéed sun dried tomatoes.  Rinsed my pasta in cold water to cool it off.  I also used my home made Chevre with Herbs de Providence.  Served the cold salad with baked salmon on top!  Yummy

I tried this recipe last night and my family loved it.  Like several other people, I also added a clove of garlic.  Also, when I was shopping for the ingredients at the grocery store, I forgot the fresh spinach, but had a box of frozen spinach in the freezer.  It worked fine.  And I just chopped up regular tomatoes instead of using the cherry tomatoes.  It was so easy and my daughter asked to have the leftovers in her lunch today!

So good, although I had trouble "crumbling" the goat cheese.

Funny ,I created this recipe over 5 years ago and people are still making it.  I love that people change the recipe, take away this, or add that.  When I made it it was food on the fly, shows that quick food does not have to be "fast food" ,which was the point of the recipe. 
 I myself would cut down the cheese to 6 oz, throw in some toasted pine nuts, and roasted garlic. :) but that is just me:) Enjoy

This was good, but not anything really out of the ordinary.  Simple to do, though.

Maybe it's jsut because I had never used goat chesse before and didn't know that none of my family would like it (myself included). We thought it was terrible. If I ever use this recipe again it would be with Feta cheese as opposed to the goat cheese. It's now a joke at our house...If we don't like something we say "It must have goat cheese in it!" No offense intended, but this was terrible.

As my family is not goat cheese lovers, I replaced it with feta cheese and added a bit of basil and some black olives. It gave it a Greek / Meditarranean feel to it. I received thumbs up from my husband and all three kids!
