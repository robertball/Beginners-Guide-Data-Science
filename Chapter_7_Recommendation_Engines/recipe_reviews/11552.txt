Something went terribly wrong with this recipe; my first AllRecipes flop. They came out like pancakes. The flavor was all right, but the cookies were pancake like and fell apart. Will not make again.

A delicious spicy cookie!  I didn't have semi-sweet chips on hand; I substituted white chocolate chips instead.  My husband loves these cookies warm with a cold glass of milk.

This cookie got mixed ratings. My husband and I enjoyed it, but the younger kids didn't. It tasted like a soft gingerbread cookie, with the coffee as an undertone. Thank you for the recipe.

I made these for a Christmas parade and they were devoured. I did omit the raisins and the cloves however. My grandmother's taste a lot like this and they are fantastic with coffee or without cold or warm.

This recipe looked so good.  After adding only 3/4 cup of well-flavored coffee, the mixture looked far too sloppy - and so it was.  I, too, baked a set of pancakes that ran off the sheets and burnt at the edges within 7 minutes.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  It is a shame to waste all these lovely and expensive ingredients.

My daughter used this recipe as her first solo baking project for school.  The batter prior to adding the coffee was very dense.  She added the brewed coffee, hot (because the recipe did not say cold and it said brewed).  The mix immediately became the consistency of a cake mix.  So she put it in a 9" x 13" pan that was greased and floured, and baked it for 25 minutes.  It came out fine.  However, the flavor is very mild.  (Not to my liking).

The flavor on these cookies is okay at best. I had hoped for much better.

The bigger problem though is the use of too much leavening agent. The cookies were entirely too spongy.  I would cut the baking soda and baking powder approximately in half.

I've made these cookies plenty of times and I love how they come out soft and not too hard. I've made alot for my granny and she really enjoys them. Everytime I make them I get so addicted and want more of them. The ground cloves, raisins, brewed coffee gives it a great taste. When they come out of the oven I can smell the pleasant aroma. I will definately continue making these cookies again.

The taste is alright but the cookies come out quite flat and pancake-like as someone else mentioned. A cookie just doesn't look right unless it has some height to it. It smelled really good baking due to the cloves but unfortunately I won't be making this again. Sorry.

Alright! I would recommend using a larger bowl when making them as there is a lot of dough. I'm not sure how big they are supposed to be but mine made well over three dozen. They were better when they were fresh the first day. Once they cooled, the next day I thought they were too soft.
