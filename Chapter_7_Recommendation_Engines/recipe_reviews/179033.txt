I substituted the soup broth with water and bouillon (sorry Campbells!); used 2 cloves garlic vs. garlic powder and brown rice rather than the white...the kids and hubby were practically licking their plates, needless to say there were no leftovers!

I had cooked the Minute Rice recipe for Broccili Rice and Cheese the night before and had most of these ingredients left over. I didn't have any basil, so I had to leave that out, but it was easy to cook, delicious, and healthy meal, which fits my bill perfectly. I halved the recipe, and will have plenty left over for lunch tomorrow. I will def. cook this again in the future!!

This was pretty good! My husband and 20-month-old both liked it too. Could have used more seasoning since it was a little bland.

Sorry, but this was bland and nothing I would make again.  I should have known that the chicken would be bland when it is only cooked in a TBSP of oil.  So blah even my dog passed up the leftovers. . .and she'll eat most anything!

I have Interstitial Cystitis, and this is a quick and easy (and bladder-friendly) recipe for a busy night. All the ingredients are things we have on hand!

I like versatile meals like this.  Of course I added a handful of other kinds of vegetables for the kids.

I thought this was a pretty easy dinner to whip up for my husband and I after a long day at work. I didn't have any broccoli on me, but I added in some celery and carrots instead and I also added extra garlic salt and some cajun seasoning as some people reported this to be a little bland. I had the leftovers today for lunch and added a little milk to it which I thought made it taste even better :)

I needed something quick and usually suck at chicken and rice. I always make it too dry but this was delicious! I used real garlic and took out the broccoli. It turned out really good and was moist.

I used this recipe as a base. Instead of water, I used 1/2 cup of white wine & 1 3/4 cups of chicken broth. I used about 1 teaspoon of italian seasoning. I fried the chicken thighs in a bit more olive oil than recipe called for, deglazed pan with broth & wine, brought to boil, added instant rice, let simmer 10 minutes, put chicken back in pan to simmer another 15 minutes, added some frozen french cut green beans & yummy. Thanks for the base to get me on the road to enjoying an easy chicken & rice dish.
