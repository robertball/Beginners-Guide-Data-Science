I'm changing my rating to a 2 star.  I hadn't made these cookies in a while, and I forgot about my notes in my first review below.  I didn't add the extra flour and baking powder this last time and this cookies ran like crazy!  I now understand why some where so disappointed. The extra flour REALLY makes the difference.  Without this alteration, the original recipe is not good.
Hope this helps!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In an attempt to make "perfect" cookies the first try, I read many of the reviews here.  Guess what!  It worked!  These cookies are fantastic.  I did soak the raisins by putting them in a colander, placing the colander in a saucepan and running hot tap water over them enough to cover them.  I let them soak while preparing the dough.  Another concern expressed in other reviews was that these cookies came out flat and ran into each other.  To try and avoid this happening, I used 1/4 cup more flour and added 1/2 tsp. baking powder.  These did not run at all, and are slightly poofy.

This is a great recipe! I've read most reviews about the recipe and the most common concerns seem to be that the cookie spreads too thinly when baked and that it is too sweet or bland. I have cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup each of brown and white sugar and added 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp of ground allspice. Also feel free to add more cinnamon if you like. This made the cookies very flavorful. The trick  is, however, mixing the dough by HAND and NOT overworking it. Follow the recipe and incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet in three stages. Do not use a mixer or you will overwork the dough and get flat cookies. I have also soaked the raisins in hot water and drained them in a sieve prior to adding them at the end. Bake the cookies on a cookie sheet at 350 or lower depending on your oven (I baked mine at 325 because my oven was too hot). Regardless at which temperature you bake them, make sure you keep an eye on them after 5-8 minutes and take them out when the edges are golden brown. I had no problems baking these or removing them from the pan. They are moist, flavorful, and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe! This one's a keeper.

for those folks who had issues with the cookies sticking to the pan, etc...since these cookies are made with butter, you need to use a non-insulated shiny cookie sheet.  This will allow the whole cookie to bake without the butter melting first and the cookie turning out flat and crunchy.  (If you substitute shortening for the butter, you can use an insulated pan without a problem, too.)

Delicious cookie.  I tweaked it slightly, though; I used more raisins and soaked them in boiling water first (they were moister and plumper this way), I added a bit more cinnamon, and the batter seemed wet so I ended up adding more flour and oats.  However, I would not recommend adding more oats; it was too overpowering.  I decided to make monster cookies, hoping they would turn our big and chewy, which they did.  I got 20 large cookies from this recipe.  Watch the baking time carefully, only adding a minute at a time, if you want chewy cookies.

Tried and true my foot. My boyfriend had a craving for oatmeal cookies last weekend, so I wanted to make him a treat. These were the worst cookies I've ever made. I consider myself a pretty good cook. When I read the reviews, a couple people said that it didn't work for them. My boyfriend and I assumed these people must not have been following the recipe correctly. These cookies had the worst consistency ever. They hardened up into flat discs as soon as I took them out of them oven. Somehow they stuck to my non-stick, commercial baking pan, even when it was greased. I had to chisel them off (and clean the pan between batches). When I put even a teaspoon of dough out for each cookie, they would spread flat and the raisins would burn. I even tried freezing the dough for the last batch. After about an hour out of the oven the consistency would turn flimsy and sticky. I wish I took a picture to submit. After three batches, all the cookies went into the trash. What a waste of time. It angered both my boyfriend and myself. This recipe either needs to be rewritten or taken out of the tried and true section. I took the leftover dough and added baking powder, another egg, more flour, more oats, applesauce and some spices (poppy seeds, orange peel, vanilla, and coconut). I put the dough in muffin tins and made great muffins. if you have the same problems I had, you might want to try this. The extra ingredients help the dough stay together and rise.

This recipe came out perfectly for me the first time I tried it. They are a hit with my family. I read most of the reviews here prior to starting. I did soak my raisins which made them extra plump, but I found I did not need to add the extra flour or baking soda, as the dough already had a nice consistency. My cookies did not run at all, and puffed up quite nicely. I cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup, but kept the brown sugar at 3/4 cup. This did not affect the taste of the cookies, thanks to the raisins, which add natural sweetness. I also added a little extra cinnamon as well as ground star anise (1/2 tsp) to this recipe, which gives a nice flavour. For baking, I rolled spoon-sized amounts of the dough into balls. I turned my oven down to 350, as I found the first batch to be browning a little too quickly on the edges. My cookies needed about 9 minutes, but I had to watch them. They aren't the kind that you can pop in the oven and walk away.  Here's a tip: if you want a slightly flatter cookie, press the cookies down with a fork about 1/2 through baking.

I will definitely be making these again!

Really good cookies! I cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup, bumped cinnamon up to a whole teaspoon, and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. If you are having problems with them sticking, it is because you have to let them cool a little on the sheet pan. I used a baking spray and they came off easily for me.

This was a very tasty recipe, exactly what I was looking for.  It's hard to find an oatmeal raisin cookie recipe that uses butter instead of shortening.  I was a little leary before making it because some people said the cookies turned out hard, but I have just finished baking them and they turned out perfectly moist.  Maybe others baked them too long.  Make sure you don't overbake if you want them moist, maybe even take them out a couple minutes early.  Great recipe, thanks!

An exceptionally good recipe. No, it doesn't need extra flour as a few dissenters insist.  That might make them thicker and maybe softer, but they would lose their chewiness. If your not after a nice chewy cookie, find another one to make. I hope I speak for the hundreds and hundreds of us that had no problems and loved these cookies when I say to the small handfull who struggled and then went on in bitter rants about how it must be a bad recipe, "Its not us, its you."  There are a thousand things that can affect a recipe turning out right from atmospheric conditions to the type of ingredients used to the skill of the person making the food and sometimes we all experience something not turning out right.  My experience was this: the cookies are fabulous.

Nothing to change, nothing to criticize.  I prepared the recipe just as directed and was very pleased. I did, however, use chocolate covered raisins which made these extra gooey and good. And, as I always do with cookie doughs made with butter, I refrigerated the dough for about an hour until it firmed up a little. I used a tablespoon-sized cookie scoop and flattened them just slightly. They're soft and chewy, but still a little crispy along the edges. Everything you'd want in this type of cookie.

Wow....lots of reviews on these cookies and quite a bit that were negative...and I do not understand why so many people can have such vastly different results.  I followed the recipe to the letter and my cookies turned out PERFECT! Chewy, slightly poofy, the dough did not run or spread and I always, always, ALWAYS bake cookies on parchment lined cookie sheets - NO sticking and you don't need to grease them therfore adding extra grease of which I think is the major culprit for cookies that spread to much.  This recipe is fabulous as written, someone else suggested putting allspice or nutmeg in, which would definitely enhance that 'spiced' cookie flavour, but if you want just an oatmeal raisin cookie - then this is it! Thanks for the great recipe! Hubby and I hoovered 4 each after they came out of the oven! :)

It drives me crazy when people give a recipe 5 stars, but then include a lengthy list of changes they made to the recipe.  I feel like that was the case with this recipe.  I made this exactly like the recipe, and they turned out flat, runny, and stuck to the pan (even when I used non stick spray).  This recipe definitely needs some help.  But I didn't bother reading the reviews because it was rated so high, I figured I didn't need to.  But now I realize that the rating isn't a true rating because people rated it after they tweaked it.  I am so frustrated at the way people rate their recipes on this site!!! I don't have time to read hundreds of reviews. +

I added a dash more cinnamon and fourth less salt and omitted the raisins.  My daughters loved them. They are picky teen girls. I made them twice already.

I haven't ever really learned to bake since my mixer caught fire in my hands the first time I used it hah (traumatic experience, trust me!). But I figured I"d try baking this year for Christmas. Hubby doesn't like chocolate, and I don't like raisins, so I used dried cranberries instead. I read the reviews, and added 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda because we like soft cookies. I also used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup butter flavored shortening. Also made it a full 1 tsp of cinnamon. I just pulled the last cookie sheet out and they are AWESOME. With those changes, I will definitely make this again using the dried cranberries instead.

5 stars only because I used the modification listed by another user and didn't stick to the original recipe.  I added 1/4 c flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda and the cookies turned out almost perfect.  The only thing I'd change is next time I'd add another 1/4 c raisins because I really like raisins!

Remember that ingredients, especially flour, vary a lot in how much moisture ther contain by geographic location.  I'm in Denver, and flour etc is very dry.  I've made this recipe twice: once increasing the flour by 50% as recommended, and once as printed here.  The result was *much* better following the recipe here.  So, before you are overly critical, consider that maybe your location requires a modification that does not apply to all bakers.

Just took the 1st batch out of the oven....and  ohhhhhhhhhh man...they are GOOD! I love oatmeal raisin cookies, but for some reason, never made them before. I used large flaked oatmeal and Thompsons raisins for my ingredients. The only thing I tweaked was the amount of salt. I always find that oatmeal raisin cookies are salty, so I only did a shake of my salt shaker, as I thought the recipe called for waaay too much. Baked for 8 mins, and they are perfect. Thanks so much for the great recipe!!!!!  ----------------  * little side note. I just read through some of the other reviews and noticed that there were complaints of the cookie falling apart/being too soft/runny...I noticed that they were soft too, coming right out of the oven....I left them on the baking sheet without touching them for 3-4 minutes. They firmed up nicely enough to transfer to the wire rack, and finished cooling there. If you read whole recipe directions, it will tell you to do the same!

I tried making this recipe(as written) twice. Both times the cookies ran and turned out flat.  While they tasted good, but didn't look nice enough to give to other people. (I was going to give out at Christmastime.) They broke up easliy, into a granola-like consistency. Maybe next time I will try to increase the flour and baking soda as others suggested.

The ingredients in this recipe are almost the same as my gramma's (the only cookie my dad will eat!). But she used vegetable oil instead of butter and soaks the rolled oats in it for at least 1/2 hour. Softens the oats and they are really delicious. I always make one batch with raisins (adults favorite) and one with chocolate chips (the one the kids like!)

I found these cookies to be quite delicious. I had none of the problems that some reviewers had regarding consistency. My cookies weren't thin, dry, or crumbly. Nor did they stick to the baking sheet. I baked the cookies for about 10 minutes, cooled on the baking sheet for 2 minutes and then transferred to a cooling rack. Came out chewy and moist. Perfect amount of cinnamon, in my opinion. Maybe next time I'll substitute some dried cranberries for variety.

This recipe was great! It is about the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever had. Like everyone else has said, the outside is crispy but the cookie is still chewy. I did add 1/3 teaspoon of nutmeg though. I just made sure to put the cookies in a ziplock bag as soon they were cooled down. They stayed fresh for over a week, or at least that's when they were all gone.

These were great!  After reading a ton of good, bad and iffy reviews, I was a bit nervous to make 'as is', but I'm glad I did.. well, mostly. :)

Things I changed: increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp, added a couple of dashes of nutmeg and clove, threw in a small palmful of ground (in my coffee grinder) raw flaxseed and chia seed (as I am making these to be a good snack for my kids and wanted to give them an extra BUMP).

Comments:

People who's cookies ran together- were you ovens at 375?  At 350, the butter is going to melt faster than the cookie can bake, therefore making it run.  I had zero problems with my cookies crisping up too fast at 375, and I have a crappy oven, lol.

People's who's cookies fell apart, crumbled and stuck.  You have to let and cool and I mean COOL.  As much as you want to, you have to let it be and 'set up' or yes, it will fall apart and stick.

I did not soak my raisins and they were fine.  Baking in the oven for 8-10 minutes plumped them up enough.

I used old fashioned rolled oats, not quick oats. Not sure if that made a difference in the runny cookies, but mine are just like a normal cookie consistancy.. a little thick, bumpy, chewy, buttery cookie.. delicious!  

I will definitely make these again, and am thinking up a good 9x13 casserole recipe for them as a bar.  

Thanks!

This recipe is a MESS ! The cookies come out stuck to the sheet. The timing is wrong ,DO NOT attempt to add softened raisins just makes the cookie harder to bake. The cookies fall apart.I even added 1/4 more flour,and a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.And it still was overly runny. If you are a novice baker please understand even the pros have a hard time adjusting to this recipe.I'm reporting this frustrating cookie mess to the editors of this site to be fixed correctly or just taken off. Please do not waste your time on this recipe.It will just frustrate you. Thank-You!

I'm not exactly a cooking expert but I know a few things here and there. This has to be the coolest and easiest recipe I've had the pleasure to use. My trick for the way they came out is the butter. SOFT BUTTER!! SOFT! SOFT! SOFT! ALSO,  I mixed the key ingredients using a blender then I used a spoon to mix in the rest. Over mixing can happen and it makes the cookies flat. using a shiny pan helps prevent burning.  I sent these to my husband out in Iraq and he loved them!  THANKS AGAIN! :) P.S. I'm looking for the perfect Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe... anyone??

The only problem with this recipe is the flour measurement.  It should be 1 1/2 cups, not 1 1/4 cups.

I was so excited to make these and saw that it had a great rating. I followed the recipe precisely, measuring everything out, stirring ingredients together just as it says to do, cooked them at the right temperature for the appropriate time, and they ran and stuck to the pan. I had to literally scrape them off into a pile and then put them all together in a casserole dish and now have to figure out what else I can do with it. I will not use this recipe again, and after reading the other reviews, people should not give the actual recipe a good rating unless you follow it exactly. If you have to add half a cup of flour and cut some of this and add some of that for them to work and be delicious, then they are not the same recipe.

I think I know what happened with people getting runny cookies. I just made this recipe twice: once with quick-cooking oats, and once with old fashioned rolled oats. The ones with the quick oats were extremely thick and cakey (great if that's the kind of cookie you prefer), and the ones with the old fashioned oats spread all over the cookie sheet, and were a delicious something, but not really cookies. 

Perhaps if the original recipe were revised to say quick-cooking oats, it would help people get the results they want (also, smash the cookies out flat before baking because they won't spread at all with the quick oats).

These cookies are the best especially if you love chewy cookies!!!  I've never gotten so many compliments on cookies before.  I even had a friend's mom ask for the recipe and she owns a bakery.  Like others, I've cut both white and brown sugar down to 1/2 cup each and soaked the raisins for 10 minutes in hot water.  Easy to make and great to eat!!

This was a sensational recipe.  I added a little extra cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg, and just fell in love.  I generally don't care for this cookie variety, but when I finished, I wished I had doubled the batch.

My husband loves oatmal raisin cookies (his absolute favorite) so I wanted to make them homemade for him. I halved the entire recipe (since he's the only one who eats them), added 2 extra tablespoons of flour, soaked the raisins in hot water to plump them up, and used old-fashioned oats instead (couldn't find rolled oats at the supermarket). The cookies didn't run together and plumped up nicely. Outside was crispy, yet the inside was chewy. My hubby loved them, so the recipe will definitely go into the recipe box!

An absolutely perfect recipe with a few alterations. I took the advice from other reviews and cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup, added 1/4 cup flour, changed amout of cinnamon to 1 tsp, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and soaked the raisins in boiling water before adding to the rest of the batter. 
Also, I baked the cookies at 350 degrees for 6 minutes, rotated the baking sheet and baked for another 3 minutes. They looked slightly underdon when I took them out of the oven (brown around edges, but shiny in center) so I let them cool on the baking sheet and they finished cooking this way.
Absolutely perfect!

If you use this recipe as is, your cookies will NOT be good.  Before baking the consistency of the dough looks good, but the dough spreads really flat once baked.  I did the cookies over and added an additional 1/4 cup flour.  I also turned my oven down to 350 and baked for 12 minutes.  The cookies were good after that and very yummy.  I gave such a low score b/c the recipe, unchanged, just doesn't work.

These cookies were perfect!  They were delicious.  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and mixed the ingredients by hand to prevent flat, hard cookies.  They turned out crispy on the outside & moist on the inside, I couldn't have been more pleased.  I also adjusted the temp. and cook time as suggested by reviewers.  All I can say is they turned out perfectly.

Very, very yummy. Moist and chewy. I used high fibre oats, Nutri Blend flour and threw in some flax seed. I also used half raisins, half chocolate chips. They are so good I can't bake them fast enough!

No issues with running - the recipe is perfect!

Great recipe! One point of advice though....slightly beat your eggs and combine with the raisins, before making the cookies -- let stand for 15-20 minutes...then combine egg (along with raisins) as recipe calls for. For best results, let raisins and eggs stand in your refrigerator 45 mins to 1 hour before making cookies, and you'll have amazing results!

With a few alterations these cookies turn out great. I read some of the reviews and here's what I did: 1st I soaked the raisins in hot water while I mixed up the rest of the ingredients, I added 1/2 tea of baking powder, 1/4 c. more flour, 1 tea of cinnimon instead of 1/2, and a pinch of nutmeg. Turned my oven down to 350 and baked for 14-15 minutes. Perfecto!

I've read some reviews and noticed that when people complained about the cookies being flat, etc., they used the term baking "powder."  Make sure you use baking "soda."  It makes a world of a difference

I judge a recipe based on how it's written and not by how I altered it.  I tried this recipe EXACTLY as it's written.  My "cookies" turned into flat discs of oatmeal and raisins. They litterally flattened out into a big sheet of cookie on the baking sheet.  Thankfully, my 4 year old doesn't care as long as there is sugar in it.  The flavor was there, but I'll never make them as written again.   

After the first two dozen turned out like an oatmeal raisin waffle cone, I added another 1/4 cup of flour and about 1/2 tsp of baking powder to the remaining dough. They actually held a cookie consistency after that.

Great recipe. I followed the recipe but I added 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder like someone suggested and they turned out amazing. I've tried making these cookies several times but always failed but I finally found the recipe to make them great and will defiantly be using this recipe again!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten or made. I followed the core recipe exactly until the very end. I split the dough in two before adding raisins. I added 1/2 cup of raisins to one half of the dough. I added 1/2 cup of sweetened dried cranberries to the other half plus 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. Then I chilled both doughs in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes before baking. I made sure to grease the baking sheet. No issues with sticking to the sheet or running. The end result was two delicious cookies from one easy to follow recipe. Yummy! Chilling the dough keeps the cookies from running and it doesn't affect the integrity of the dough or the flavor.

I have never given a 1-star rating before, but these cookies just simply didn't work.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and they were extremely flat, hard little cookies.  On the last pan I finally did a larger scoop, lowered the oven to 350º and baked a minute or two longer.  This seemed to help a tiny bit, but these cookies still were not good.

I hate giving a bad rating, and can't figure out how this worked so well for so many, but these cookies didn't work.  : (

Baking these as I write - no problem with portions or cookies "running" - they taste great and are chewy!!  I'm sure the putting raisins in warm water and adding nutmeg and other add'l spices would enhance the flavor even more - do keep an eye on these after 8 minutes to get color and texture just right - they are delicious!  Enjoy

Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Delicious. I went to a 5-month culinary school training and the last month and a half was spent on baking. I got a Kitchen Aide for my graduation and use it sometimes. I cooked it a 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes. Check after 8 minutes. Should be medium to dark brown outside and medium brown inside. Check with toothpick. Perfect! Yum!

Ok, here it is! The cookies themselves tasted good, however, the cookies were a disaster. As a reviewer mentioned, they came out like a flat crumbly disk. I thought I had overmixed the butter. So, for the second batch, I placed the batter in the fridge for 1 hr. No change! They reminded me of Queen Anne's Lace Cookies not oatmeal cookies. A reviewer before me stated it was not the fault of the recipe, however, she had to make adjusts. So, I am sure if followed the recipe as written as I did, she would have had the same experience! I am a very experienced cook, baker & culinary graduate. I don't mind adjusting recipes to my taste but I don't like fixing a broken recipe!

I baked these cookies and as soon as i got it out of the oven they started to fall apart on me. I followed the directions as stated and before i put them in the oven the dough was too runny. I would not recommend this recipe to anybody because unless you want to fight ot get cookies off the plate don't chose this version go to the Quaker Oats box.

I reduced the butter to about 1/2 cup so that it wouldn't spread like what the other reviews said. The texture came out just nice. Crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Not bad overall, but it would taste better with more cinnamon.

My husband is a diabetic and Im always trying to find cookie recipes that taste good with a sugar substitute. Well, this recipe was great. He loved them. I used 1/4 cup sugar free syrup and 1 cup splenda for the brown sugar and 3/4 cup Splenda for the white sugar.
Thanks a bunch for the recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as listed and I found that it turned out very well. I sprayed the cookie sheet with some canola oil cooking spray and had no problems with the cookies sticking as long as I let them cool on the pan for a few minutes first.

Very good tasting cookie. I did not use extra flour, but did add extra cinnamon. The cinnamon was the only change I made. Used old fashioned oats, not quick. The texture was chewy, not crunchy. Bake at 375 for 9 minutes as per the recipe. I used parchment paper to line the baking sheets and had no problems with sticking cookies. These cookies are very rich tasting and highly addictive!

The only substitution I did was using margarine instead of butter I do that for all my cookie reciepes as it is cheaper and not that much impact to the flavour.  Turned out great mine did not run but I cooked at 350 C and I cooked for about 12 mins

This was a very tasty cookie.  I agree with the other reviews-they were quite flat and required a little more flour, however I chose to make them exactly as they were and they were still delicious!!

The Oatmeal Raisin Cookies I is one of the best oatmeal cookie recipes that I have made and would rate as 5 stars had the flour amount was correct.  I agree with one reviewer about the flour amount should have been 1-1/2 cups instead of 1-1/4.  Too little flour makes the cookie too soft to keep its shape, especially if you like a moist, chewier oatmeal cookie.  Watch your baking time, because the flavor and the moist texture is best when it is not over baked.

I thought these were going to be perfect since the rating was so high, but i was somewhat dissapointed with them. They were just too bland for my taste, and they ran a little. I added ground ginger and honey to the next batch and they were better. Good base recipe..

We love this recipe because they turned out a little crunchy on outside and chewy on inside.  I made it for the first time today, and I used Crisco instead of butter, only because I like the texture that Crisco produces.    I will not use another oatmeal cookie recipe in the future.

These turned out really flat on the 1st batch. I did end up adding some additional flour about 1/4 cup and about a tsp of baking powder to my dough and the next batches came out perfect.

I have been making these cookies for over a year, and they are always well received.  Initially, they were not chewy enough for my liking, so I made the following adjustments over time. -- Increase butter to 1 cup.  Replace 1/4 cup of white sugar with brown sugar.  Increase raisins to 1-1/2 cups. -- I also increase cinnamon to 1/2 TBSP and dust the unbaked cookies with cinnamon sugar.  Bake on insulated baking sheets to keep the bottoms from burning, and enjoy!

Very good recipe. I have baked these several times, and I always double the recipe.  I do not drop them however, instead I roll them into small balls and place them on a baking tray lined with Baking paper. They have never run, or have I had burned butter in them. They all come out perfect and I make them perhaps too small but they fit nicely into the small chubby hands of my Toddler.  The cookies do not flatten out to much but have a nice thick, chewy middle. I use California Sunmade Raisins and have never needed to soften them. I made them last summer for a family get together, and no one believed that I baked them as they were all relatively the same shape, size and too perfect to be made by hand!  One tip, when I am rolling them out, I have a small bowl of cold water, that I dip my fingers into so that the dough does not stick to my hands. When two trays are in the oven, I pre-roll for the next batch and line them up on another sheet of baking paper, so I can quickly return the baking sheets to the oven.

Pretty good uncomplicated cookie.  Easy to make with my toddler on a rainy day.  Only thing I didn't have any AP flour so I used whole wheat flour instead.  The overall taste was good but they didn't spread while cooking so I've ended up with cake like cookies.  Not a bad thing though!

Simply fabulous. If you have the mini-muffin trays I would highly suggest using them...they need a bit longer to bake but then turn into delicious three-bite treats.  I used a dash of nutmeg as well.

I read the reviews for this recipe and I adjusted it based on what everyones comments were.  I definitely wanted to avoid a "way too sugary" cookie so I reduced both sugars to 1/2 cup each.  I also took reviewers' advice and added 1/3 teaspoon of nutmeg and I doubled the cinnamon and the cookies are just perfect...taste wise.  I could not have even imagined how bland they would have been without the additional spices.  Soaking the raisins for 10 minutes in hot water was a great tip, they were so plump and juicy!  The down side to my cookies is that I listened to everyone when they said that they were coming out flat and crispy.  Because of this, I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and my dough came out super stiff, almost too stiff and they barely spread at all.  They came out more something you would have for breakfast rather than dessert.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.

terrific cookies! some of those complaining might have used margarine instead of butter. that will affect the consistency of your dough. the sticking to your pan complaint has more to do with your preparation than the actual recipe. i used my pampered chef stones and all was perfect. when i removed them from the oven, they seemed to be "not quite done"; i could see a bit of dough in the center. but waiting a few minutes for them to set up was the trick! taking them out of the oven at the right time prevents them from becoming too hard. my oven at 375 worked perfectly. i agree with the poster who said let them cool slightly before transferring them to cooling rack. i got 36 medium-sized cookies. oatmeal raisin is my husband's favorite, and this recipe has just moved to the front of my recipe box!

these cookies can be hard, or soft. Chewy, or crunchy. Thay are very good, and you will love them. Trust me. If you have kids, hide the cookies from them.

EXCELLENT!  I just made these cookies for the first time and I was delighted with the flavor and texture.  
I made the following changes/additions to the recipe:
-Used 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour as substitute for the 1/4 cup of white flour.  Next time I will try half wheat and half white flour.
-Added a dash of nutmeg, cloves, and ginger
-Added 1 tablespoon of ground flax, and will try adding 2 next time

I just can't say enough good about these cookies.

perfect. i like these cookies b/c they are crunchy and chewy, not "cake like" as i have seen some cookies made. delish.made this with no changes,as is. larger cookies take 10-11 minutes. i had no problems with sticking and i used my grandmother's cookie sheets, which have to be at least 30 or more years old.(i have had them about 12 years myself..)
thanks for sharing

I soaked the raisins as another review suggested to plump them up.  I also added more spices, cloves, nutmeg and extra cinnamon.  Anyway my 17 year old son took some to school in his lunch and shared them with his buddies.  They think I am a cookie goddess, high praise indeed since most things I bake are nothing special.  This is a good solid recipe!

A real family favourite. For variation, I sometimes make it with dried cranberries (instead of raisins), lemon zest (instead of cinamon) and lemon juice (instead of vanilla extract). Dried apricots too if I'm feeling really healthy!

This is the greatest recipe for oatmeal cookies ever. My family can't get enough. However, there are three things that I have found make them turn out better and prettier.

The first is use parchment paper. This recipe tends to run and flaten. If you use parchment paper and mound your dough, you will get nice cookie shaped cookies. 

The next thing is, only the bottoms should be brown if you want a cookie that tastes great and is moist right out of the oven and tomorrow, too. 

The third is this recipe needs room in the mixing bowl. Use the largest you have or use a fruit bowl or salad bowl for mixing. It can get heavy and sticky quickly and you will need room to make sure that all the ingredients get well blended. (but not over blended)

I substituted cranberries for raisins.  The general problem with this recipe was that the cookies were too crunchy.  Next time, I will use half butter / half crisco to make it softer, and perhaps a different baking soda / baking powder combo.

Receipe was followed to a T but these were rated F- by my husband.  Not sweet enough.. not enough flour.. quick oats would have worked better than regular rolled oats.

This is truly the BEST oatmeal raisin recipe I;ve ever tried- every other recipe Ive ever tried (and Ive tried quite a few!) comes out either too crispy, or too runny- these turned out perfect and the cinnamon is in just the right amount! For a special treat, soak the rasins in brandy beforehand- mmmm!

Award winning instead of white sugar I used raw honey and only brown sugar for a healthier version.. Also used cranberries instead of raisins ..and when I was done mixing the cookie dough I used about a half of cup of rolled oats to blend in with the cookies so you can see the raw oats on the outside of the cookies

I just whipped these cookies up as a Sunday afternoon whim and they are very yummy!  I am new to the world of baking so I LOVE easy and successful recipes and this one is both!
I noticed a few reviews said that the dough ran and to not use a mixer but to hand mix.  I used my KitchenAid, with the dough hook for the flour mixing, and my cookies did not run at all.
First off I only made a 1/2 batch (2 dozen).  I used craisins instead of raisins and I soaked them in hot water while prepping the dough.  I did cut back the white sugar by about 1/4C and I added Nutmeg.
They are sweet and tasty without feeling heavy.  I won't feel guilty when I binge eat the babies!  :)

Just added one more item to this recipe and that was M&M's (the peanut ones), and boy Oh boy did they ever turn out perfect! Just look at my pic of them, I got 34 good size cookies out of this recipe, and yes, I followed what other users said and that is to soak your rasins in a bowl of water for at least 30 min. prior to mixing and boy do you ever have a super moist cookie with rasins & M&M's :)  Just mix in the M&M's with the rasins, the end result is you have a fiber moist/crunchy rich cookie.  Fiber is important in today's diet and just look at all the cookies you get from this recipe, at least 30-36 good size cookies. Enjoy!!!! See my pic with rasins & M&M's

I love this recipe!  I always get compliments on these cookies.  I, like many other people, soak the raisins in hot water for at least 20 minutes prior to adding them into the batter so their nice and plump.  If your cookies are coming out flat as pancakes, your butter is too warm.  Don't melt it in the microwave and then throw it in your mixer.  Bad idea.  Let your butter get soft on our counter OR rotate turn the stick of butter on a different side every 4 seconds for 4 total rotations (sometimes it's a little less time depending on the microwave).

I'm sure the US version of this recipe works perfectly and is lovely, but when you translate it to metric, the quantities go all wrong. The US one calls for 1.5 cups of sugar total and 1.25 cups of flour. In the metric one it tells you to use more than twice as much sugar as you do flour. I don't know if this is human error or your conversion system is just atrocious, but it's responsible for all the runny cookies.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe, AS WRITTEN. I read some of the negative reviews and I think they are written by people who prefer a more fluffy, cakey cookie like those you would find in a pepperidge farm bag. Myself, I like my cookies chewy in the center with a little carmelization crunch on the edge. They did spread quite a bit, but I would liken the effect to a typical chocolate chip cookie. My husband loved the cookies too, and I will be making them again for certain. And I definitely won't be adding extra flour to this recipe, as I fear it would throw off the delicate balance between chewy and crunchy this cookie has going on.

I didn't read the reviews before trying this recipe, and I have to say the cookies turned out perfectly without any alterations.  I used parchment paper on my cookie sheets and had no issues with sticking or running.  Everyone I've served these to has agreed, they're delicious!

I gave this recipe four stars because I decided to use the suggestions of others and increase the flour by 1/4 cup and added 1/2 tsp. baking powder. With these modifications, these cookies came out wonderful. I baked them on air bake cookie sheets so I increased the temperature to 380 degrees. I baked them for 9 minutes. Two days later they are still nice and chewy, just the way I like them.

I want no stars but it made me pick 1. They ran all over, were burnt on the edges and raw in the middle and when a chunk of cookie fell off the edge of the pan when I was turning them it started a fire in my oven! These might as well be gooey coasters. Ugh!

This is my official go-to recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies.  I have now made it twice, once with butter-flavor shortening, and once with real butter, and I definitely prefer the butter version.  I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup more of flour, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, and a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  If you use the butter-flavor shortening, do not increase the flour; the cookies will not flatten.  I always bake cookies on parchment paper, so there is no issue of sticking.  Most importantly, soak your raisins in a strainer in a bowl of boiling hot while you make the dough; it makes the raisins super plump and juicy.  I make these and immediately bag them up for friends and coworkers; otherwise, I'll eat the entire batch!  :)

These were AWESOME and just what the doctor ordered, to satisfy my craving. =D I was a little unsure of the recipe 'coz a couple of the 'most helpful' reviews, tore this recipe to shreds. Hence, I halved the quantity and made only 24, which I heartily regret. I made a few tweaks (although nothing earth shattering). I used dried currants instead of raisins (coz I realised I didn't have raisins only after I'd started making this =P ), and added a bit of ground cloves and allspice to the flour mixture. Also, sine I'd halved this, this called ofr a little over 1/4 cup of brown sugar and whi sugar, so I used the brown sugar and added jut a tablespoon of white sugar to it. It was easily sweet enough and definitely healthier. =) I baked these at about 180degrees and they took 12 minutes to reach my preferred chewy state. Oh and as suggested by many reviewers, I soaked the currants in hot water whilst preparing the rest of the batter of the cookie. Thanks alot for sharing Darlene. This is definitely a keeper! =)

I loooove these cookies!!  The key is to not overbake them and you will have a lovely, tasty cookie that stays chewy inside!  I usually make half of them with chocolate chips and the other half with raisins.

I followed this recipe exactly, although I did about half white flower and half whole wheat flour, but they came out DELICIOUS.  I don't know why so many people had consistency issues...

Theses cookies were great! I suggest using a little more than teaspoonful drops for bigger cookies or shorting the baking time. They were brown before 8 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe. At first I thought it called for too much rolled oat, but I was wrong. I did not add the raisins and it still turned out moist and yummy.

I made the changes that the first reviewer did (added 1/4 c. flour and 1/2 tsp. baking powder) and was SOOO happy to have my cookies come out plump and chewy and delicious, with no flattening!  Love it when that happens.

Okay, these are the best cookies I've ever made!  I used margarine instead of butter, increased flour to 1 1/2 cups, added 1/2 tsp baking powder , increased cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons and increased raisins to 1 1/2 cups.  I did need to flatten the cookies slightly before baking.  These were so very moist!  Texture was perfect. This will now become my "go-to" oatmeal cookie recipe.

All I can say is OMG!  Finally, an oatmeal cookie that doesn't run off the cookie sheet.  I read all of the reviews, added extra flour, plumped my raisins, added a pinch of freshly ground nutmeg, and for some extra flavor, about 1/3 cup of sweetened, shredded coconut.  These cookies were awesome!  This will definitely be my "go-to" recipe for oatmeal cookies, which are my husband's favorite and I anticipate rave reviews when he gets home.  This recipe has eliminated a lot of guesswork for me.  Gotta go!  2nd batch is ready to come out of the oven.

Great recipe. I read a bunch of the reviews and added 1/2 tsp baking powder, added 1/4 c extra flour, a little less sugar, more cinnamon, and used coconut oil instead of butter (personal preference). They were slightly fluffy, chewy and very addictive. Oh, I also soaked the raisins in hot water to plump them up. Thanks for all the reviews guys!

These cookies were amazing and so easy to make! I dont know what the bad reviews were all about because they baked just as you place them on the baking sheet, they dont spread. i did boil the raisins for a few minutes and added walnuts to get that crunchy texture. If you dont have such a sweet tooth u can definatly cut down on the sugar, they are VERY sweet. The mix looks dry when ur done but it will bake just fine.they came out moist in th emiddle and crunchy on the outside (cooked the full 10 min.)Great cookies!!!

I would give this recipe 5 stars with some simple changes I made, some suggested by other reviewers.   I boiled the raisins in water and let them soak for a few minutes. This made them plump and moist! For spices, I did 1 tsp. Cinnamon, a dash of Nutmeg, and 1 tsp. Allspice. I also added a Cup or so of chocolate chips, along with the raisins, and really enjoy the cookies that way.    These turned out AMAZING! The best oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever eaten! Make sure you take them out of the oven soon enough. Just when they start to brown on the edges. They may still look a little too soft on top, like they need more baking, but they will settle quickly and be nice and chewy while not underdone! Mine took ten minutes, but that's just my oven... Enjoy!

As always, I followed the recipe exactly as written, so I could give a true review. Mine turned out great! They were VERY moist and chewy and yummy. I only got 24, but used TBS instead of dropping TSP on the cookie sheet. I used parchment paper, and they pulled off easily. I guess since I dropped TBS instead of TSP, my cookies were puffy and gorgeous.

August 2012 - made these again and only changed things by adding extra half cup of flour. OMGoodness, they were AWESOME! Used parchment paper, chilled dough while pan was cooking, and baked for 11 minutes..that was the best time for my oven. This recipe rocks and I upped my stars!

I rate this a four with modifications, a three without. I did a first batch exactly as the recipe and what I got was more like oatmeal lace cookies. I didn't *not* like them, but wasn't expecting that consistency. So then I did a second batch, added 1/4 cup flour, scooped 1 and 1/2 t dough for each cookie, (about 28 cookies) baked for 9 minutes convection-bake and removed them from the pan to a cooling rack immediately. And they came out great.

I enjoyed these cookies though had to add some extra flour so they wouldn't spread so much.  I also doubled the cinnamon and vanilla and was pleased with the results.

With changes others have mentioned it's a 5 star: Up the flour to 1 1/2 cups, reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup, pre-soak the raisins, add 1/2 tsp baking powder.  I noticed that the cookies I made towards the end of the bowl (after dough sat for about 25 minutes) were considerably less spread out than the others. Next time I'll let the dough sit for a while before baking the first trays. The flat ones are plenty tasty, but would prefer the rounder ones.

I love these cookies.  I realize that cookies made with butter spread out a lot, so I space them far enough apart on the cookie sheet.  And I add a little bit more cinnamon.  Other than that, I follow the recipe as written, and they turn out great.

These cookies turned out Awesome!! i was told the secret to plump oatmeal cookies is to make sure your baking soda is fresh, I also increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. i love cinnamon but it is up to your own preference. I am making these cookie to send overseas to my brother and his platoon!! I know these guys will appreciate some homemade treats!

I read almost all of the other reviews and was nervous that the cookies would spread like most others said. I followed the recipe exactly(scaled down to half) and the cookies turned out great! They didn't spread anymore than any other cookies do. . . worth a try, great flavor!

fabulous! perfect just as it is- i didn't need to add extra flour or anything, they were perfectly chewy throughout, and crispy on the edges.  i wonder if people had problems with these when not using rolled oats; maybe folks are using quick oats, which won't work in this recipe.

I honestly don't see why people are having trouble with this recipe. The DH and I wanted to make some oatmeal raisin cookies for his grandparents and I searched the net and found this recipe. I'm glad I didn't read the reviews at first because if I had I wouldn't have discovered this amazing recipe. I am definitely adding this one to my staple cookbook recipes. LOVE IT!!

VERY good.  I added choc chips & cranberries and cut the raisins down by about 1/4.  My husband needs to leave some for the kids' lunches tomorrow.... RIGHT DARLING?

Really nice cookie but a little too sweet for me. I am not a tremendous oatmeal raisin cookie but my boyfriend happens to be so I am always in search of a good recipe. I soaked the raisins in a some hot water for about 15 minutes to make them plump and softer. Put in some chopped pecans for added texture.  I did put the dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes and I think that did the trick to make the dough firmer and not run while baking. Also used whole wheat flour because that was all that I had. Will make them again.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because I never tried it as is, I ended up tweaking it with others suggestions, but it was fantastic!  As per suggestions I added an extra 1/4 C flour, I also added 3/4 tsp cloves, 1 C coconut, 1/4 C butterscotch chips, and 1/4 C walnuts.  What a delicious treat!  These cookies have it all and taste divine!  I also dropped the temperture down to 350 degrees as people had mentioned the tendency for these cookies to burn.  Perfection!

I am not a huge fan of oatmeal raisin cookies but i made them because my husband wanted them.  This is, by far, one of the best cookies i have tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect! NO FLATTENING OR RUNNING! They did NOT burn, they were soft and chewy and plump. I was very worried as the first batch was in the oven because it wasnt then till I looked at the reviews.  But I am VERY GLAD that I didnt use any of the changes suggested. Enjoy this great recipe!

You know, I love a good oatmeal raisin cookie.  However, I was out of raisins and substituted orange-essence dried cranberries, and I may never go back!  They were just absolutely delicious.  This is a softer cookie - not a crisp cookie.  I like both kinds, depending on my mood.  I also liked the size of this batch - about 24 good sized cookies, so not so many that they'll go bad before we can eat them.  Very yummy iced with cream cheese frosting, still warm with a glass of ice cold milk.  I substituted all of the regular granulated sugar with Splenda, and it didn't hurt the appeal at all!

Not only did these cookies run into eachother, they baked down to little oatmeal crisps that were quite disappointing to my family and I. I will continue my search for a recipe but certainly this was NOT close to it.

This is the first time i tried, my hubby and my girl like it very much. The texture is just nice, the only thing i did was to read the reviews first before i proceed to bake. i took the idea of reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup each and bake it using the cooking sheets. it really make it easier to bake, is cleaner too.

I really like this recipe, to me it is very simple and basic. In other words you can modify as you like without harming the cookie. For instance Iwanted to make it as healthy as possible,considering that it is a cookie! So I divided the butter and used Coconut Oil as the other half. I added about 1/4 cup of coconut milk and then added about 1/2 cup of freshly ground flax seed meal and about 1/4 C. Pecan fines because I am trying to use up what I have on hand, (poor teeth, really)I also had about two handfuls of carob chips, so add 1 hanful.Then I found that the cooking time was a bit short for my additions so I lowered the temp to 350 and extended the time to 15 to 18 min. I just don't think that there is any way you could harm these cookies. Of, course listen to the other reviews and get them off the baking sheet immediately, then enjoy. What a cool recipe. btw I two soaked the raisins a bit but don't think it too necessary deepending on the condition of the raisins, if pretty dry then by all means soak. Ginny

These cookies were delicious and I don't even like oatmeal raisin cookies!  I cooked them for the full time and they were still a little soft even after they cooled but definitely cook a couple minutes less for softer cookies!  I can't wait to make these again....they did not last long!

I know this recipe was featured in the cookbook, but I thought it was average. The dough needs more flour or the cookie crumbles. Also, I would lessen the sugar. I do love the amount of butter as it makes the cookies chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges. Add more cinnamon too or the flavor is a bit bland.

The best ever!!  I only made one substitute.  I used the Quaker instant oatmeal that comes prepackaged in different flavors.  I had the maple and brown sugar flavor handy so that's the kind of oatmeal I used instead of regular/plain.  They turned out awesome.  Definitely bake them the minimum amount.

They were too sweet, not very flavourful, and stuck to the pan the first time I made them, so I made some changes to the recipe for the next batch. I reduced the white sugar to 1/3 cup and the butter to 5/8 cup, added 2 tablespoons of real maple syrup, omitted the vanilla, and doubled the amount of cinnamon. I also greased the baking pan well and baked the cookies at 350 degrees instead of 375. They came out wonderful!

I followed the recipe very closely, and had the same problem that a few others did--the very flat cookie that was near impossible to get off the pan.  I tried refrigerating the dough, turning down the heat, greasing the pan, using a different cookie sheet, making larger cookies...none of these helped much.  I found that if I just scraped the cookies off the pan as fast as I could once out of the oven, I didn't have such a problem with the pan being encrusted with crunchy cookie residue.  Once these cookies were cooled a bit on the rack, they were delicious.  I like thicker cookies, but these still managed to be chewy in the center, though crunchy around the edges, and the flavor was good despite being *slightly* too sweet.

These were the absolute best oatmeal raisin cookies ever. For some of them I left out the raisins and they were also DELICIOUS. I also soaked the raisins in warm water for about 20 minutes. These were gone in 2 days. Everyone loved them. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!!

Recipe as is is flatter than a pancake, looked more like lace with airholes than a cookie. Finally got a good cookie by adding enough flour to have a stiff dough, chilled dough baked at 375. Here are all the things I tried first: Let cool a little then tried to get off pan, fell apart, so mushed it together, discovered it makes a nice oatmeal raisin popcorn like ball (walnut size) so did the same to each of the baked cookies.  Rescued my first pan efforts and ingredients, the cookie ball tastes great:)  Next tried putting in fridge to chill, dough still baked the same. Reduced heat to 350 same result. Added more flour to remaining dough, baked on air sheet and also on regular cookie sheet still not enough flour added a bunch more ... GOT A COOKIE!!!

Excellent cookies.  I made this for my sister and her unit who are in the Army.  Thumbs up all the way around.

This recipe is better than the recipe listed on the box of Quaker Oats! It's delicious and the cookies are moist, not crispy and dry.

I noticed many previous postings added extra flour and Baking soda. I Think the Reason some of the previous posts had thinning and Sticking and burning issues was I believe was because the amount dropped  per cookie the recipe calls for a teaspoon per cookie I used a Rounded  TABLESPOON  size drop per cookie.I consulted another tried and true Oatmeal Cookie recipe on the Oatmeal Box it recommended the Tablespoon Sized drop per cookie this made for a  Big Flavorful Moist and Chewy  with NO BURNT BOTTOMS even without parchment paper or greasing the cookie sheet or cooking spray or Extra Flour and Baking Soda this Recipe turned out to taste pretty close to the Cookie I remember my Mom making as a Kid

These cookies are awesome just as the recipe reads.  I have made this recipe more then  30 times, and people always say they are the best oatmeal cookies they ever tasted.  I think the problem with other reviews saying the batter is runny, is they are making the butter too soft to start with.  That will give you runny batter.  I follow the recipe, but I don't measure the cinnamon, so I know there is more then 3/4 teaspoon in there. I add chocolate chips and raisins, and they are perfect!

I followed the recipe to the letter. I lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper (as I do when I bake all cookies) for easy removal and clean up. I used an ice cream scoop and doubled up the scoops to achieve a jumbo cookie with a chewy consistency. I was pleased with the results and so was my husband. I will definitely use this recipe again and will recommend it to others.

I used regular oatmeal the first time and they were flat -this time I used old fashioned rolled oats like the recipe states and they were great! I cut sugar to 1/2 c each - mixed by hand no mixer!! Tip - if you soak raisins you will need extra flour because your adding moisture !! Yes they would go flat ?!

I love these cookies! My Mom used to make these exact cookies for me when I was a child, but we had lost the recipe. When I found this recipe I ate the whole batch in one night! I honestly cannot make this recipe and keep them all for myself because I will eat them all. I usually make them when I am going to visit family so I don't eat them all. My family adores these. They spread quite a bit when baking so they make really large cookies. I don't find that they are too thin, because of their size it kind of evens out. I bake them just until cooked so they stay soft and moist. I am a total cinnamon lover though, so I do add extra (instead of  3/4 tsp I use a heaped teaspoon, I always add extra cinnamon in any recipe). I don't find them bland at all. They are such a classic recipe. I honestly wouldn't add nutmeg or anything because this is a simple oatmeal raisin cookie and taste like a classic cookie. A word of warning: once you try these you will crave them, they will change your life!

These are fantastic! I halved the recipe because I don't want that many cookies around. Glad I did, because I would be eating all of them right now if I had made more. I didn't change anything in this recipe.

I did what the one lady said and added the cloves and allspice and upped the cinnamon to a teaspoon. I liked the edges best on my air bake sheet. I baked seven min's and they are PERFECT!!! The best tasting oatmeal raisin cookie I have ever made. You will love them! I did not grease or spray the pan, just cool for a min or so before removing. They came off just great! They look just like the picture. ?? yummy!

These cookies are deliciously chewy and yummy. The only problem I had was that they wanted to stick to the pan making it difficult to get them off without falling apart.  I got around that by using a sheet of parchment paper on the pan which worked great.

I made these cookies last night. Other reviewers mentioned that their cookies were kind of runny spread too much. I used half butter and half Crisco. I also added pecans as that is what makes my better half go "nuts".  Those changes not withstanding, I think these are too sweet. Next time, I think I'll reduce the total sugar to a cup instead of a cup and a half. 
     After chilling the dough for an hour or so (mom duty called, I'm not THAT awesome) theses cookies baked up beautifully. They were also soft but not too soft. It's a keeper for me!

This recipe is just "off" and, although I followed it to the letter, the cookies were a mess.  First baking sheet, spread all over and into each other.  Added a bit more flour for 2nd baking sheet and they were okay but not very flavorful.  3rd and subsequent baking sheets, I added a bit of brown sugar and they were better.  Wouldn't use this recipe again and can't understand all of the high ratings.

I actually modified this recipe so it would be gluten free. I made it with about 1.25 cups almond flour, 1/8 cup ground flax meal, 1/8 cup corn starch, 1 tsp xantham gum. I also had to increase the oatmeal to 3 cups so the cookie dough had the right consistency. Delicious!

This recipe was quick and easy. The cookies turned out perfect-nice and chewy.  I followed the suggestion of a few reviewers and cut sugars to  half a cup each, and they were sweet enough. Great recipe!

Okay I know I'm not the first person to say this judging from all the wonderful reviews, but these cookies are great! So my first try in making these, they did in fact turn into flat UFO disks. I followed the recipe exactly how it said and I could taste that the flavor was there, but the puffiness was completely missing. Yesterday, I had  craving for them and decided to give another whack at it. I used the advice from another fellow reviewer by cutting out some of the sugar (just half a cup of each), turning down my oven temp, and making sure to mix everything by HAND until it was just incorporated. Trust me, it made all the difference. They turned out chewy and delicious and (most importantly) PUFFY! I also added some walnuts to the mix this time and sprayed my pans really well with cooking spray to avoid sticking. Don't give in after the first try!

I made these yesterday and they were a huge hit, BUT after reading some reviews I did not stick to the original recipe so I can't really rate the recipe as it is exactly. 
The changes I made are: I used an extra 1/4 cup flour (1 1/2 cup total); used shortening instead of butter (equal amount); doubled the vanilla (we're vanilla fans); added 1/4 tsp nutmeg; added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (this gave them a nice subtle pumpkiny flavor, if you're into that). Also, while I was preparing the dough, the raisins were plumping in a bowl of hot water (with more vanilla) and they were so moist and yummy in the finished product. Adding walnuts would have been fantastic, but I didn't have any on hand and will definitely try next time.

Perfect template recipe. Instead of 1 cup of raisins, I added 1/3 cup cranberries, 1/3 cup walnuts and 1/3 cup chocolate chunks. I also added a 1/4tsp allspice and 1/8tsp nutmeg. Perfect oatmeal cookies. Soft and chewy. I might do 1/2cup each of cranberries, walnut pieces and chocolate chunks next time. They make good big cookies but it takes a few extra minutes.

I was skeptical at first reading all the negative comments on this recipe. However, I tried and just finished baking the first batch of these cookies and wow, these are really really good! I followed everything according to the recipes but when I shaped the cookies dough I did open the window to let the cool air in and keep the dough from melting too fast in the oven. The cookies came out nicely - no flat shapes whatsoever. The dough came out a bit soft at first so I left them on the baking sheet for a while before transferring them to the cooling rack. I will definitely bake them again!

These were so good I immediately threw away all of my other oatmeal raisin cookie recipes. Yes, it's that good. After reading the reviews I made the following adjustments: I soaked the raisins in hot water while I made the dough, I added 1/4 cup of flour, and 1/4 tsp baking powder, I left them on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes before removing them to cooling racks. Cookie nirvana achieved. Perfect seasoning, lightly chewy, awesome recipe!

I haven't even finished baking the batch and I'm already writing a review.  These are exactly what I have been looking for!  A nice chewy oatmeal cookie.  I can't stand a cakey cookie and these are perfect.  The only thing I changed was to add 3/4 cup of raisins and 1/2 of walnuts.  Otherwise, perfect.  For my notes: reduce temperature to 350 when using convection.

This recipe did not turn out well for me.  Here is what I did:
I followed recipe exactly except I doubled the vanilla extract and cinnamon.  I initially creamed the butter and sugars by hand, but that didn't work so well, so I switched to a hand mixer. When it was time to mix in the flour mixture, I did that by hand, gradually pouring in a little at a time.  I then placed the batter in the freezer for about 18 minutes.  I did not waste anytime and then scooped out medium size balls onto a parchment lined baking sheet.  I then baked the cookies in a 350-degree oven (I felt 375 was too hot), checking after 5 minutes.  After the first 5 minutes, the cookies had spread quite a bit, but they were no where near done in the middle.  So I baked them for 3 minutes longer and they were done, but flat as pancakes.  I was so disappointed.  I tasted them and thought they tasted good, but I'm giving this recipe one star because the shape of the cookies were just awful.  I will not be making this recipe again.

Best Ever thou I did add extra raisins & nutmeg and simmered them on stove for about 20 min then drained them, ended up using almost 2 cups of raisins and took them out of oven in about 9 mins due to my oven being a bit hotter and temp was set at 325 let them cool on cookie sheet about 5-8 min then transferred to wire rack, this one is for sure a keeper.

Just made these cookies and didn't change a thing other than using craisins instead of raisins.  Batter was the perfect consistency for drop cookies.  Just remember 'softened' butter, not 'melted' butter.

This recipe by itself is more like meh, could have made it better.
I did! Changed the increments of flour to 1 1/2 C and baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp. I decreased the rolled oats to 2 C, 1/2 C butter then added 4 Tbsp apple sauce, then added 3/4 C craisins along with the 1 C raisins. My family loved my updated version. I may use less butter and more apple sauce next time around. :D

Perfect old-fashioned oatmeal raisin cookie - crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Quick & easy!  I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't have asked for a more delicious result.  Nothing like a wonderful homemade cookie with a nice hot cup of tea or a cold glass of milk!  This recipe was exactly what I was searching for, and I'm so glad I found it here.  Thank you so much for sharing with us!

Oatmeal Raisin Cookies I' Haiku: "Wavered on 3 stars. No fault of the recipe, I followed reviews." Blurgh, so I read loads of reviews, and reduced the sugars and the temperature, and first batch was smoosh, smoosh, batter smoosh, then Blammo, one minute later they're burned. So I tried the recipe's 8-10 min. at 375 deg. instructions, and had to crouch by the oven and guard-dog the last batches to ensure that they didn't burn. Oh, and I flattened mine a bit w/ a fork so they wouldn't have that mutant mountain look that oats do to cookies. They were pretty tasty, and had just the right sweetness.

First, would like to say I am not an oatmeal cookie fan. More of a choc-chip kinda gal. Was baking these for a dear friend who cannot eat choc-chip due to migraines- oatmeal raisin is his fav. 
That said, I LOVED this recipe. I did two changes - #1 used all dark brown sugar - I was all out of white. #2 increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. Used a mixer until I put in the raisins - but kept it running very low. Baked on aluminum cookie sheets with a piece of parchment on it - this resolved the sticky cookie difficulties. They turned out beautiful, tasted yummy.

I have made these before and they turned out perfect, today they are a mess! They were flat and so hard to get off my pan. I had 2 sheets of one large cookie!
I always measure perfectly and never stray from the directions. 
Im so frustrated, Im going to try to add more flour and see how that works.

Followed TraceAddict's recommendations and these were DEVOURED! Reduced sugars to 1/2 cup, added 1/4 tsp ground cloves and allspice.  Yum!

Very good recipe! I cooled the dough And made 40 gram balls, let them stay in the fridge for a while and then baked 6 at a time for 9 minutes on 190 degrees. They came out perfect and tasted delicious! I used 2 cups of instant oats, brown sugar flavor and 3/4 cups regular oats. Forgot the cinnamon but didn't miss it in flavor.

These are not my favorite. I added the extra flour and they STILL were runny and thin and crispy. They also have an odd flavor. I don't know what the flavor is, but it's too strong.

great basic recipie!  I substitued 1/4 cup of butter for coconut oil, though, and added almost a cup of chopped walnuts.  I dont know why so many people had issues with their cookies running (maybe an altitude issue or something?)... mine came out perfect and delish!

I don't see any new reviews for this, but this recipe was very straight forward and simple.  I followed this recipe almost to the T, except I added more cinnamon, and a sprinkle of ginger and cloves because I like the way it tastes.  Other than that everything was the same, and my cookies were not running or anything! In fact it was really hard to mix all the oatmeal and raisins into the mixture.  I cooked mine for exactly 8 minutes and they turned out PERFECT! And they taste awesome! :)

These are fabulous cookies!!  My husband just tried them and told me they are the best I've ever made (and I bake a lot!)  I made a few revisions based on previous reviews.  I doubled the recipe, mixed in a stand miser, reduced the sugars, added 1/2 c flour, added 1 tsp baking powder.  I also added craisins, dried cherries and dried blueberries, 1/2 c chopped almonds, and 1/2 c flax seeds (measurements for the double recipe). Letting them stand on the cookie sheet to cool for 3-4 minutes allowed them to be removed easily.  I agree that location (altitude) can make all recipes vary slightly so take that into consideration when making adjustments to recipes.  I was looking for the perfect "loaded oatmeal cookies".  I came across this recipe, added the extra ingredients I had in mind, and they turned out perfectly.  These are yummy!!!

Awesome with half reg. oats, and half quick.  A little chewy, a little cakey and soft. I  decreased white sugar by 1/4 cup and added a little extra baking soda (like 1/8 or 1/4 t.).  They rose just right and are perfectly sweet. I cooked about 10 minutes at 350 on convection.  They looked a bit gooey when I took them out (I let them cool a minute or so on the pans), and are perfect cooled.

I read the reviews and made the following changes: boiled the raisins. Cut the butter in half and used half shortening (still get the butter flavor but makes a fluffier cookie) added 1 extra teaspoon vanilla, cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup, bumped up the flour to 1 3/4 cups.  The oven temp was lowered to 350. I chilled them a bit while I was waiting for it to preheat. Rolled them in balls and baked 9min on a well seasoned cookie sheet. At 9min they came out perfect! Not flat, didn't stick, nicely browned bottom, chewy, the raisins were yummy! I think they are perfect now!

It sounds like to me that some people are using instant oatmeal and not rolled oats. There is a difference! Instant oatmeal will make them run all over the pan and burn. I liked this recipe but didn't love it.

Good recipe! I took advice from other reviewers & added 1/4 c more flour, 1/4 tsp baking powder & 1/4 tsp more cinnamon.  Cookies turned out perfect (crispy edges & chewy in the middle - not flat or too puffy) & VERY tasty.

I absoutly LOVED these cookies!!MY dad loves oatmeal cookies without raisins so i simply left them out,on the other hand my mom loves them with a ton of raisins. I decided ,because my mom loves a soft doughy cookie, took off a minute of baking time and let them sit about 10 min before eating them. I will definatly make these for my next cookie craving!!!

Pretty good. These were fluffy, and I baked for 11 mins at 350 degrees. Would have liked a bit more crisp on the bottoms. Flavor nice, could use more cinnamon, oh and I did add 1/4 cup more oats.

I have always followed the recipe off a box of oatmeal.  This time, we had the oatmeal without the box; therefore, Allrecipes.com here I come.  

I read through the reviews and made the following changes.  I used only brown sugar and did not use additional brown sugar because some had said the cookies were too sweet.  My family is not big on super sweets.  I also used fresh ground whole wheat flour.  My grinder is very fine, so the consistency of the batter was very good.

I modified the recipe accordingly:
1 C butter
1 C packed brown sugar
Removed white sugar
3 C oats

I felt the cookies came out very good.  My husband really liked them.  Since I am making them for church and for Father's Day, I made the cookies into heart shapes...

Just made this.  A bit sweeter than I would like, but it still tastes great!  I took the advice about heating to 350.  I doubled the recipe since I was making a batch for the family and another for the school.  I also took the advice about soaking the raisins in warm water (I boiled a 1/2 cup in the microwave and then soaked the raisins).  The cookies came out like pralines with a bit more fluff in it.  I also used an IKEA kids' spoon to size the drops of cookie dough. I cooked for 10 minutes each on the middle shelf.  I put the cookies in a GladWare container with 1 piece of white bread to keep it soft.

These were really good.  They made quite a lot.  I had read from previous reviewers that they couldn't get them on the pan easily.  I added just a tad bit more flour (maybe a quarter cup?) and they were fine.  Didn't have a problem any more than normal "sticky-cookie-fingers."  Also pre-soaked the raisins for a few minutes before adding.  Am making them again for my dad's bday!

My son who is 13 made these and they were fantastic. Like others, I don't know why anyone would have difficulty making them. He soaked the raisins, but that's the only change he made. The cookies were soft, chewy, and delicious. We will be making these again.

I have been making Oatmeal cookies all of my adult life (and that's lots of years) but this is by far the very best oatmeal cookies ever. Thank you Darlene

With a couple of small changes as per the suggestions of other reviewers (adding 1/4 cup of additional flower and soaking the raisins in warm water prior to adding them), these were the best cookies I've ever made!  I'm literally the only one in my house that eats oatmeal raisin cookies and the entire giant batch didn't last 3 days between the four of us.  I've been requested to wait at least another month before making them because we all end up eating too many at once. :)

I made these exactly as the recipe says and they turned out amazing! I had no issue with them being runny, or bland. I didn't pre-soak the raisins and again I never had an issue. Perhaps the difference when it came to taste came from the fact that I used Harvest Crunch Cereal instead of just rolled oats. Great cookies!!!

I have no idea why so many people seem to struggle with this recipe or need to add more flour.  The only adjustment I made was to pre-soak the raisins and they came out perfect!  My household polished off 2 dozen within an hour of them coming out of the oven!  Even the next day the few that were left were still chewy and delicious.  I'll definitely be making them again (and probably soon the speed they ate them)!

Double this recipe, because they go FAST!   I made the dough ahead of time, then 10 minutes before the kids came home from school started baking them.  Next time I might use 3-4 cups of oats, and perhaps some chocolate chips with the raisins.  Thanks for this recipe!

After reading the reviews, I decided to just go with the stock recipe. I added a bit more cinnamon, and baked them on parchment paper because of the comments about sticking. They turned out great! I made them a bit larger than the recipe indicated, baked them for 10 minutes and they remained delicious and chewy.

This was the first time I made cookies from scratch and this recipe was excellent. I think what I liked the most is that you can tweak it to your taste. I followed the advice of a few others and soaked the raisins and used 1 1/2c. of flour. Next time I will use more spices (nutmeg, more cinnamon, ground cloves). I cut back on the sugar as some suggested and used only brown sugar but next time I will add the sugar as the recipe calls for and I added walnuts. I don't understand how this could have possibly been runny as others have stated. When mixed, I got a good hearty dough and the cookies baked just like I like them with crispy edges and a nice chewy texture. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe it will definitely be a go to recipe for me!!

These turned out absolutely divine for me!  I followed past reviewer's advice and reduced the baking temp to 350 and increased the baking time to about 12 minutes, baked the cookies on top of a layer of aluminum foil, soaked the raisins first (I actually added craisens as well), and made sure to hand mix everything so as not to over work the dough.  They were moist, fluffy, and delicious!  Best oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted! (My husband even asked me to bake another batch so he could bring them to work to share with his coworkers!)

I made these cookies for my family and they loved them.  I had no raisins in the house and added 1 cup of chocolate chips instead and they came out delicious.
I even made some cookie pops on a stick for my son.
Great recipe!

Great recipe! I hadn't read any reviews and just made as it said to, but cut it in half. They turned out perfect and chewy. Just the way we like them. You have to wait a few minutes before removing them from the cookie sheet so they can "set". Yum!!

I think some people do not realize that depending on where you live you will either have to add a little "water" or add a little flour to some of the recipes because of the altitude! So please do not blame the recipe for lack of knowledge!

"THE" go to oatmeal raisin cookie recipe.I did change it a bit tho, I added 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda & 3/4 teaspoon of baking powder instead of 1 teaspoon of  baking powder. baked 12 mins at 350. I ALLWAYS do a test cookie,just to make sure that the consistency is exactly how I want it before I cook a whole "batch"

The dough tastes good, but other than that, something's just not right with this recipe. They spread out all over the cookie sheet and cooked unevenly (raw in the middle, nearly burnt on the edges). They were really soft when I took them out of the oven, but hardened quickly and I had to scrape them off the cookie sheet.   I tried again with more flour and a lower oven temperature... same thing.

Delicious and chewy oatmeal raisin cookies. I did turn the oven down to 350 and cooked for about 12 minutes after the first batch came out a bit more crispy around the edges than I like. Oh, I also soaked the raisins just because I never had before and that was yummy. Other than those two things I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have any problems. It is a dense chewy cookie, which, in my opinion, is just how an oatmeal raisin cookie should be. Two days later and the cookies are still chewy, not hard at all. Thanks for this recipe, it's perfect.

These cookies were pretty yummy.  I used butter flavored shortening instead of butter so they would be more crispy.  I also substituted dried cranberries for raisins.  I think they could use some more spices, they were a little bland but were still pretty good.

I changed the original recipe to suit my taste after reviewing the comments and came up with this: bake @350 for 9-10 mins, decrease sugars to 1/2 cup each, add 1/4 tsp cinnamon,nutmeg and cloves. Spray the cookie sheet and the cookies were perfect. Would recommend this to everyone . ENJOY!

We just finished baking these and they turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing i added was fresh ground nutmeg. They did not flatten as others said, and they turned out  slightly puffy, moist and chewy just like I wanted! Im not sure if altitude or the lack of humidity here in Denver had anything to do with it.. but they're Great!! Thanks for the recipe!

I had no issues with running. They are very tasty and look very good. They are a bit sweet - maybe next time I'd also cut down the sugar to 1/2 of each - but all in all, great recipe. Thanks.

good cookies....however, the directions leave something to be desired.  If you use this recipe, you'll have to use your experience and best efforts to make this work. PS - be sure to ensure that you've used all the ingredients that are listed... as the directions don't call for all of them.

These cookies taste AMAZING. I love the soft and crispy edge texture. It's really the butter that does it, use real butter and make sure it is at room temp, otherwise expect uneven mixing. I like adding an extra egg just to make more moist cookies  Ive replaced raisins with craisins (dried cranberries), and it was awesome.  Ive also used this recipe to make a chocolate oatmeal cookie, just don't add raisins or cinnamon. My friends thought choc. oatmeal cookies was a nice twist.

I tried this recipe this morning. My batches turned out just about perfect. This is one of the better oatmeal cookie recipies I have tried over the years. I suggest to let them cool a bit on the pan before putting them on the cooling racks.

BEST oatmeal cookies ever!  I have no idea why people would give this recipe a bad review. I think they must have done something seriously wrong or have been baking on terrible cookie sheets.  I've made these twice so far and each time they came out perfect! Slightly crunchy outside and chewy inside--delicious! The first time I followed the recipe to a tee and of course, they came out good.  The second time I made them I only had margarine and not even quite enough.  I also lost track of how much oats I put in, so I think I screwed that up too.  And after THAT I ended up putting everything together in the wrong order. I was sure they weren't going to turn out, but they tasted great, if not better! Just in case you haven't baked a cookie of this consistency before, it's better to let the cookies slightly cool before removing it from the cookie sheet, otherwise, they may break while you try to remove them...but that's nothing new.  Also, I use a stoneware baking pan to bake cookies on, but I'm not sure if that necessarily makes them turn out any better.  So glad for this recipe and this is my new favorite cookie!

These cookies rawked.  The recipe works as is, but I also made bigger cookies with 3 additional minutes.  A shade crispy on the the edges, soft in the middle and slightly puffy...YUM!  I reduced the crispness on the bottom via a silicone baking mat, if desired.    Hints I use for reducing "runny" cookies (but I didn't use for this recipe): Use butter with at least 50% oil, or substitute a portion of white flour with a equal amount of sifted whole wheat (usually only a quarter of the total and max amount is 1/2 of total.), and don't forget to rotate the tray halfway through the baking time.    Future tweaks:  using nutmeg, apple spice and/or dried fruit/berries (rehydrate?)  *Note-also works well with replacing white sugar with Splenda.

Loved this recipe. I am making these for a second time and doubling it because we went through them so fast. Better to have these than processed granola bars. THANKS!

what a disappointment.  followed directions to the t.  not happy at all as these turned out to be puffy dry little cake type things.  they dont spread at all.  all they do is puff up and stay whatever size you drop them onto the sheet.  wont be making them again.

I read the reviews before making these and was a little apprehensive seeing all the comments about the consistency.  However I followed the recipe exactly, the batter did seems to be a little on the soft side, but these cookies turned out amazing! Just follow the recipe... they will turn out! No extra flour or oatmeal needed despite the reviews. This is a new house-hold favourite and will be a regular!!

I'm not usually a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, but these were delicious! I thought the flavor and texture were perfect as it. Because they tended to flatten, I just made more smaller cookies so they wouldn't run into each other.

I made these cookies for a coworker's birthday last night and the result was AWESOME! I followed the same suggestions as other reviewers and reached cookie perfection: used only a 1/2 cup white sugar, let the butter soften naturally, increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp, and lowered the oven temperature to about 350 degrees, letting the cookies bake for 15-20 minutes. The batter was simple to make and the end result was fantastic. Thank you for this great recipe!!

I made this recipe today  with no alterations. I baked them for 8 minutes with no burning or falling. Cookies came out moist and tasty. I used unsalted room temperature butter. I find if I bake cookies using microwaved or melted butter/margarine, that they will fall flat and bake crisp/dry. I also have tried avoiding salted butter, as  I suspect the excess salt has been to blame for more than one batch of dried out cookies in the past. (but I am no Martha & I have no idea how to alter a recipe to correct it)

This is a great recipe! after reading several of the reviews I decided to follow the recipe as is and see how everything came out before making any changes. I typically use half sheet pans for my cookies with baking sheets. The cookies did stick  a ;ittle more than expected on the baking sheets but they came out great. At lower temp(350) they were flatter but at at 375 they stayed higher. Either way they were great!

I just tried make these using the recipe given here, and they melted into one giant flat cookie! The resulting mess is actually delicious, but zero marks for presentation- I had hoped to give these cookies as a holiday gift for a colleague, but this recipe does not deliver a presentable gift cookie. However, my husband is thrilled with this, as he now gets to eat 4 sheets of raisin-oatmeal sludge...

I did not care for this recipe. It spread on the sheet like a flood.  I salvaged the last 2 sheets by adding an additional 1/2 c flour.  I believe this recipe needs more flour, a bit less oatmeal and another 1/2 c of raisins.

I made this recipe and followed some of the other reviewers' advice and added 1/4 cup of flour and some baking powder.  Also I soaked the raisins in hot water for a few minutes.  I cover my cookie sheets with parchment paper.  They turned out chewy and moist--really good.

These were Yummy! I did soak the raisins in boiling water for a few minutes. I also cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and put 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of what the original recipe called for. I added chopped walnuts to half of the batch and those turned out great too! They were soft, moist in the inside but crispy on the outside. They were pretty to look out too! :) This recipe is a keeper!

I liked these cookies a lot. I added 3/4 cup of diced walnuts to the recipe. I made larger cookies then the recipe called for so I cooked them 10 to 12 minutes. They turned out great.

I made these exactly as directed and they were very good. I would add some spice next time, some clove or all spice, as they were a bit bland. The texture was great, and I didn't have problems with them being runny like other people have mentioned.

Lol 4 dozen my foot...I did kinda make bigger cookies but who cares how many you make when they taste this good? I did put in more cinnamon but it's because of a personal preference. Other that that I did soak the raisins and they turned out plump and wonderful in these cookies

FINALLY a cookie without shortening!!! These were great. My husband said they were the best cookies. They were big, chewy and fluffy at the same time- just like a bakery!!! I did add chocolate chips and pecans in  with the raisins. They will be good without the chocolate as well! Thanks for the post!

I loved this recipe, atfer reading everyone's comments on this recipe I tested to see if I would have the same problem of the batter running but I didn't. Thats because I used this little trick, before you add the raisins coat them in 1 tablespoon of flour then add them and the oats to the batter. It stops the raisins from sticking together and it makes the cookie stay together and not run. My cookies came out perfect using that method. I hope this little hint was helpful.

would be 5 stars AFTER all the recommended changes.  
my cookies turned out fine after I did the following:

 - cut brown sugar AND white sugar to 1/2 cup each.  
 - used 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup raisins
 - added 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 cup flour.  
 - baked to time required.  more like 20 min for first batch and 10-15 min per batch thereafter.  

i like the cookies after all the changes, but can't imagine liking them without all the additional ingredients.

 - one alternative instead of the cloves and nutmeg is to add another 1/2 to 1 tsp cinnamon

tried this recipe for the 1st time and i didn't do anything different except use an organic assortment of raisins from the farmers market and a bag of milk chocolate chips and they came out perfect. i always use parchment paper and a cookie scoop so recipe was super easy and was exact at 48 cookies. minimal running (like any other cookie dough) and i kept the dough refrigerated in between batches. my hubby can't stop eating them!! super soft and chewy!

This was a great recipe! Quick and easy. I mixed everything by hand. My family loved the final product. I did half the batch without walnuts, then i added 1/2 chopped walnuts to the other half of the batch! Perfect!

I followed this recipe to the letter except that I did cut the sugars to one half cup each.  They turned out great.  I did mix my hand as there are few things I use my stand mixer for.  It's easy to over work things when you let a machine do the work.  You do have to let them cool for at least 8 minutes before you try to take them off the cookie sheet, otherwise they will fall apart.  That is the nature of the beast when using oatmeal in cookies.  Great recipe!!

I was looking for a recipe that would be easily adaptable...this was it. I used 1 cup of dried cranberries, 1/2 crushed macadamian nuts, 1/2 cup white chips and about a 1/4 cup of choc chip. They turned out pretty good too. I also enjoy the original recipe tooo. Thanks for a great recipe...

I'm 4 months pregnant and have been craving oatmeal raisin cookies and these have hit the spot!  I boiled the raisins first so that they would be softer, and I didn't have baking soda so I used 2 1/2 tsp of baking powder and they seemed to be come out fine anyway..

No problems!! I read some of the advice, and so reduced the sugar and added a tiny bit more flour. I didn't soak the raisins, but will next time. I also added a few more spices. Great cookies!! Thanks!

I followed this recipe except I did not have any brown sugar and instead replaced the 3/4 cups brown sugar with 1 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoons of unsulphered molasses.They have a wonderful taste.My family and I like them better with the molasses than with regular brown sugar.

crispy on the outside, chewie on the inside.  I used quick cooking oats.  Baked them for 9 min.  Make sure you let them sit for a minute then remove to cooking rack.  If you don't they crumble and if you leave them too long in the pan, you may have problems as they stick to the pan.  Brown sugar in a cookie recipe ...  makes the cookie a chewie one.  Great recipe.

Delicious cookies, no problem with spreading.  I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and soaked my raisins beforehand.  Kids and husband gobbled them up.  Thanks for great recipe!

I always use baking paper when I make cookies so I had no problems with the cookies sticking like others did.  I did have my first batch turn out flat and a bit runny like some other reviews, so I took the advice and added a bit more flour to the mixture and the next batch turned out perfect.  They smell so good when they are cooking, that added cinnamon really makes them taste yummy!

This is an excellent recipe. I looked at several and chose this one because it had such good reviews. I couldn't be happier. After being married 3 years my husband finally tells me Oatmeal Raisin are his favorite cookie. I can't count the cookies I've baked over the past 3 years and Now he tells me....Of all the cookies, I had never made Oatmeal Raisin. These were soooo good! I had to omit the vanilla only because I was out, but they still turned out great! Thanks so much, I'll be saving this one.

This recipe worked out fairly well. I used dark brown sugar as opposed to light brown sugar and it gives the appearance that the cookies are burnt. They taste great either way, but you'll see more dissapear if they aren't "burnt looking".

I'm not a big oatmeal raisin person, but these aren't bad! I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup apple sauce, and I used bread flour not all purpose. They came out fluffy and moist!

I have not made these cookies in a while and just made them this morning. They came out waaaaay too sweet and runny as other reviews said. I will try to put half the amount of sugar and see if it works better.

Absolutely the best Oatmeal Raisin Cookie ever!  I cut back on the white and brown sugar to 1/2 cup and upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and added 1/2 cup butterscotch chips.  Took them to church and got rave reviews from everyone there.  Low calories and good for you!  Can't beat them!  It's added to my recipe file!  Thanks!

This recipe is almost perfect. I use a little less sugar than the stated amounts, and always use golden raisins.

Having never made oatmeal raisin cookies, I was nervous. This recipe is easy, and delicious! Don;t modify anything, it's perfect the way it is. Your baking time may vary, mione was 7 minutes, but you always have to watch.
Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Cookies came out way too sweet. Great recipe otherwise. I would just recommend cutting back either the white or the brown sugar to 1.2 cup.

These cookies were VERY tastey! They definatly live up to the reviews. However I added 2x the amount of cinnamon which it needed for flavour.

made a double batch for my boss' birthday.  they came out excellent!  Very easy to make.  I had no trouble with the cookie being flat and I don't own an electric mixer and did it by hand.  I soaked the raisins in warm water first.  Very good cookie!  Highly recommended!

Husband requested the addition of chopped walnuts and Splenda instead of the white sugar.  He and the kids loved them and they didn't last long!  I thought they were a little on the dry side and may add some applesauce next time.  If you have a big sweet tooth, like I do, you may prefer a different recipe.  Five stars from the family and easy to make, can't ask for more than that!

A great tasting oatmeal cookie. The only thing that I didn't like about the recipe is that it produced a thinner cookie than what I was hoping for.

Great oatmeal cookie--I followed the recipe except I soaked and blotted the raisins, and used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  They turned out well.  Mine are thin, but still tasty.  When I looked at them after 8 minutes, I thought they looked way to wet to be done...I kept cooking until they appeared to be done.  Well...they are quite crisp after a couple of minutes out of the oven.  Subsequent trays were removed more promptly, and are not nearly as thin and crispy.  Next time I make them I will try some of the suggestions for making them a little "puffier"...but the extra cinnamon and nutmeg make the flavor perfect.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I really love the texture and consistancy of these cookies.  I just love how chewy they are.  HOWEVER, they are a little... bland.  I even added extra cinnamon and some ground cloves, and they were still on the bland side.  Until the next day, that is!  Then the flavor was fantastic.  These definitely improve after sitting a bit.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I halved the recipe, used less than a quarter brown sugar (ran out of it), around a quarter white sugar and increased raisins to 3/4 cup, used instant oats (that's the only one I have at home). And it turned out just sweet enough. Follow the baking time if you prefer your cookies soft and chewy. I left mine in the oven for until brown as my husband likes his cookies harder. Overall, a really nice & easy recipe. Will be making it again. : )

This cookie came out very flat and hard. I followed the recipe to the T. I always think of oatmeal raisin cookies and being thick, soft, and cakey.

Mmm, I'm eating one right now!  This is a great recipe.  My only modifications were as follows (and out of necessity):   I only had a half cup of butter so I used margarine for the rest, and I ran out of brown sugar so the ratio was a little under cup of white to 1/2 a cup of brown.  I soaked the raisins in boiling water while I mixed up the dough.  Baked for about 11 minutes and they came out perfect - chewy and flavorful.  Thanks for the recipe Darlene!

Considering that this recipe was so higly rated, I have to say I was a little disappointed. I found these to be a little tasteless and too sweet on the first batch, and so I added a teaspoon or so more cinnamon to the dough and they tasted much better. I also found that these were very difficult to store and eat whole, for they kept falling apart and sticking to one another (and I'm pretty sure they were properly cooked). I soaked the rasins, which gave a pleasent plumpness to them when the cookies were eaten, and I think that other than the points I've mentioned, these were quite enjoyable. Just enough oats and fruit and a nice flavour.

This was both really tasty and easy to make. I made it better by combining powdered sugar and milk for a glaze, I thought it made them look a little fancier and gave them a slightly sweeter flavor

This is a wonderful cookie- great texture, nice and chewy, and fabulous flavor. My kids love them! I always soak my raisins, so when I added them, the dough got a little sticky from the residual moisture. 1/4 c extra flour fixed that right up. Also added about 1/2 c extra raisins. Baked on cookie stone, as always. These are a flat cookie; if you're looking for a puffy, mounded cookie this isn't it.

These are very good cookies.  They aren't terribly sweet but that's the way we like them.  If you like them sweeter, try adding a half cup of chocolate chips.  I did notice that if the butter is too warm, the cookies flatten too much.  They looked funny but still tasted great!

My father loved these. We kept them in a zip-lock bag for him and he wouldn't let anyone else have any. I used 1-minute oats and they turned out great. I found them a bit hard, but I made them larger than the recipe called for (I ended up with about 25 cookies), and I must have baked them a bit too long. Great cookie though!

These were great Oatmeal raisin cookies. The only thing I would do different is grease the baking sheet 1st. Mine tended to stick to my ungreased-nonstick sheet.

I love this great recipe!  Cookies taste great and were simple to make. After being dissapointed by so many other oatmeal cookie recipes on this site, I have finally found a keeper!  Thanks for sharing Darlene! *****

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING !  I was looking for a recipe that was a little crunchy but chewy and slightly soft.... THESE ARE PERFECT. For all the people that said too sweet, they are not. for all the people that said add more stuff....you don't have to. I didn't soak my raisins and they still tasted great in cookies.  I used 1 1/2 tbsp scoop to drop my cookies before baking and I didn't make mistake of letting butter get too warm before baking so they didn't spread out all over cookie sheet. I used quick oats, because they are cut thinner. Cookies were perfect,  just follow recipe exactly and wont have any issues.

Not sure why so many people had trouble with this recipe. I made this recipe with the ingredients as written except I wanted two different kinds of cookies so before adding the raisins I divided the batter in two and added 1 cup of raisins to one batch and 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, 1/2 cup dried cranberries to the other. Both varieties were absolutely delicious! I will definitely make these again. The only thing I adjusted was I baked at 350 instead of 375 so my cookies required about 14-15 minutes of baking time.  I used parchment paper and had no issues of spreading or flattening.

I don't think this is an entirely fair review because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I added in the extra 1/4 C flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder as others suggested. I also increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  However, these came out amazing! I cooked them at 350 for about 11 minutes. My Dad's favorite cookie is oatmeal raisin, and I made him these for his birthday. I cannot wait for him to try them!

I started by adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour, doubled the  cinnamon.  I cut the sugars both to 1/2 cup.  Soaked 3/4 Cup raisins in hot water  (drain before adding shaking off extra water). I add 1/2 cup coconut, 1 Cup chocolate chips and 3/4 cup chopped nuts. I have found its important to use a cookie sheet with sides to get them to set right also cool in pans 2 minutes before placing on wire racks.  Test your oven as each is different  I bake mine  on 350 for eight minutes in mine but it's important to finish then on the sheets 2 minutes to set up.  Most the time I refrigerate the dough for 8 hours but an hour works.

I made changes based on other reviews. I lowered the sugar (white & brown) to 1/2 cup each.  I added 1/4 tsp. Each cloves, Allspice & Nutmeg. I was liberal with the raisins & cinnamon. I mixed everything by hand & didn't overwork the dough. I soaked the raisins in hot water before draining & adding them at the end. I baked them at 325 degrees for 5-8 minutes & brought them out when they were golden around the edges. The family loved them!

Upon taking the suggestions of other reviewers, my cookies came out wonderfully. Soft, sweet, delicious!
These are the suggestions I followed:
-  I reduced the oven temp to 325 degrees (baked 10 min)
- I reduced the sugar to 1/2c of white and 1/2c of brown
- I used 1t of cinnamon, 1/4t of allspice, and 1/4t of nutmeg
- I whisked by hand instead of an electric beater
- I added more raisins and poured boiling water over the raisins to make them plump
- I sprayed my cookie sheet with nonstick oil
- I used a fork to flatten the cookies a little halfway through baking

Made these night before last. I followed the recipe and yes, they fell flat and crisped too much all do to too much sugar. Before the second tray went in I added more flour and it helped balance out the sugars. The cookie itself is still too sweet but at least it's a cookie and not brittle. reduce sugar and increase flour and oats until the batter is slightly stiff and bake for an extra minute.

Yummy! I had a craving for oatmeal cookies and whipped this up quick and easy. I added about double the cinnamon and 1/4 tsp clove and nutmeg; cut the white sugar down to 1/4 c. It's surprising to read about others' runny cookies. Mine were very fluffy; so much so that I'll squish them a bit before baking next time.

Runny batter is likely because the egg/butter/sugar mixture isn't beaten enough (should be fluffy like the recipe says) prior to adding dry ingredients and/or the batter gets overworked while adding dry ingredients.

Melted into hard disks. Not like a cookie, more like brittle. The dough is yummy but the cookie isn't something you could serve... Crumbs

These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have made!  The only thing I did different was add more cinnamon, and I also added about a tsp of nutmeg. I sprinkled some cinnamon on top before baking, too(I'm a bit of a cinnamon addict :) ). Make sure to take out of the oven when they look a little underdone, or they will get pretty crispy!

I'm not a huge fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, but I made these for my husband and he loves them! He's already had four, and they haven't even finished cooling yet. For those who had issues with them getting too flat while baking, try using your hands to roll the teaspoon of dough into balls rather than just doing drop cookies. This is what I did, and it worked great for me.

I enjoy trying new cookie recipes when I have my grandkids here, my family also eats as healthy as possible. I doubled this recipe as usual. The only thing is they spread way thin it was like the middle ones didn't cook evenly & seemed a little undercooked... They taste great for the most part not to sweet not to bland!!!

My family LOVES these cookies. They do come out flat and  stick to the baking sheet, so I use parchment. The cookies are crispy on the edges and chewy in the center. I use golden raisins, which add different - almost butterscotch flavor. Very addictive

I made these cookies today mine came out great, but they did stick to the cookie sheets but were still easy to remove from the sheets. I used Root Beer concentrate instead of vanilla Extract. I have this thing of using root beer in all kinds of baking.

Really good cookies!  Took the advice of others and upped flour by 1/4 cup.  Also added 1/2 tsp baking POWDER.  I  adjusted oven temp to 365, and set timer for 9 1/2 min.  I will definitely make again!!  NOTE:  I added dried cherries ((NOT cherry-flavored cranberries) and white choco chips -- very tasty!

Yum! I had no issues with this recipe. I took the suggestion of others and cut my white sugar to 1/2 cup and added a pinch of nutmeg. I did not have stand alone raisins so I used a package of mixed dried fruit (raisins, cranberries, cherries and blueberries). They were already moist so I did not need to plump them. I used my stand mixer for everything but the dried fruit and oatmeal which I incorporated by hand in three parts working till just blended. The mixture was quite sticky. I used two teaspoons to drop blobs onto parchment paper lined sheets. 8-9 minutes in oven at 350, just till edges are brown and then cool on sheet for a couple minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. I think the butter-based batters are often quite mushy when you first take them out, then they firm up. Agree with comments about watching them closely so they don't overcook. Will def make these again!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I always sub a little applesauce for some of the butter and I cut the sugar in half, which is plenty sweet.

PERFECT. I was looking for a good oatmeal cookie recipe and chose this one to try. Upon reading some reviews I mixed together a few tips and my batch came out PERFECT (if I say so myself). I only put in 1/2 cup with the sugars and to take care of the running problem added 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. Also, while mixing the batter I put a cup of raisins in a pot of hot water and put the stove on *very* low. By the time I needed to add them they were nice and plump.

They taste great, but were extremely flat and ugly. I guess I should have read the reviews and added more flour. Lesson learned!

I made this recipe with a few different suggestions left by others on this thread. First I added the extra 1/4 c of flour and 1/2 tsp of baking soda. I soaked the raisins in the slightly beaten eggs for about 15-20 mins while I measured  out the other ingredients. I omitted  the salt and used salted sweet cream butter instead, and only used 1/2 c of white sugar instead of the 3/4, added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. After you have your ingredients mixed let it chill in the freezer for 20 minutes. Have your oven preheated at 375, bake for 9minutes and make sure to rotate your baking sheet halfway through baking and let it stand at least  4-5min before transfering to wire rack. They tasted even better the next day. I ate 5 after they cooled and 4 more during breakfast. Definitely a good base recipe and with the tweaks made an even better one. ** as always make sure your eggs, butter and flour are at room temperature**

My first batch of these cookies turned out flat, so I threw the dough into the fridge for about an 1 hour or two. This solved the "flat cookie" problem, but the end result was still disappointing. My cookies look half baked, despite me doubling the cooking time.

Very easy to make and I love that they are all ingredients that most would have in the cupboard! I do wish they hadn't flattened out so much though. I like my cookies fluffy! Otherwise super yummy!!

Very sweet, buttery, high-energy cookie. Made them as both muffins and cookies. Many people said they turned out hard, but that was not the case with me. They turned out moist and soft and paired great with cold milk. Yumm

Outstanding. But read the reviews first. I cut out the white sugar and
used 1 cup of coconut sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon and reduced the baking
soda to 1/2 tsp. Then added 1/2 tsp each of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of Bakewell Cream. 

Instead of butter I added 3/4 cup soft coconut oil. Instead of wheat flour I added 2/3 c tapioca flour and 2/3 c of oat flour. Next time
a pinch of xanthan gum will help strengthen them.

I've made these cookies many times. I love this recipe exactly the way it is. I have not had the problems other reviewers have had. These are not runny cookies at all. The only thing for me is I like to bake organic, so I buy organic  bulk rolled oats & organic Thompson raisins in my local grocery store. I believe no matter what you are baking, quality ingredients are just as important as a great recipe. I use unbleached all purpose flour and have never had a problem, this cookie dough is always stiff and the cookies come out perfect every time. This will always be my go to for great oatmeal raisin cookies. Love them. Thanks

in orden to bake anything successfully you must first understand melting point and the tricky nature of butter. i tried this recipe and i must say, it is good but not the best. since i grew up cooking with coconut  oil and coconut milk, butter has always been considered a flavor enhancer rather than a binding ingredient. also, whoever said egg whites was meant to be used in cookie recipes. blending the butter with a few tsp of coconut oil,coconut milk and nutmeg will eliminate problems associated with premature meltdown.

The cookies were flat and crumbly, getting overbaked on the edges while still raw in the middle.  I tried adding extra flour and that helped a little but this was still a total disappointment.

I love this recipe! Although I did change it up a lil bit. I took the advice of the other ladies who reviewed and soaked the raisins in hot hot water in a small mesh colander for about 5 and that plumped them up. I also didn't feel like cutting up a stick of butter to get 3/4 cup, so I used both sticks and upped everything else by 1/4's except the eggs.  I stuck with only 2 eggs and they still came out delish.  Before I baked them tho,  I put the dough in the fridge for a few hours so it was easier to handle and the cookies didn't flatten out much. I also cooked them at 350 for 10 minutes but kept an eye on them. Best homemade oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had!

First oatmeal raisin cookie that ALL kids seemed to like! Converted me too! The softening of raisins by presoaking in boiling hot water suggested by reviewers and reduction of white sugar to half a cup  is great. Like a recipe that you don't need to refrigerate before baking. Much faster!

I made these yesterday, I only had bread flour which includes the baking powder and salt, so I omitted them from the recipe. I also added extra raisins and cinnamon, that's just how I roll. These came out great! I followed everything else, first recipe I've found that uses more oats than flour and I absolutely love it!

These were great cookies! I always come to this site for all my recipies nd so far have not been disapointed. I did make a couple changes after reading the reviews. I added the extra 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder. Also (only because I did not have any) I used margarine instead of butter, which does in my eyes affect the taste but it was what I had on hand. I turned my oven down to 350° due to them looking brown on edges and still not done in the middle. And baked them for 8 mins. Kids won't stop eating them! Just to add to my previous rating. I used instant oatmeal packettes (mostly plain but there was a couple cinnamon and spice flavor) and I did soak the raisins in some hot water with a touch of sweet n low

This is a great recipe delicious! I usually don't write a review but before I tried this recipe I seen all the 5 stars then I seen the one star review. They must have not read the directions or missed a step maybe didn't put in the baking soda or something because these were easy to make and yummy!

Used 2 cups flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder as previously suggested. Also added nutmeg and ginger - maybe 1/2 tsp each. Baked for 10 minutes and AMAZING!!

These were great, with some modifications. Soaking the raisins is a must! Added more cinnamon and some nutmeg. And smashed the dough after putting it on the pan. Also reduced both sugars to 1/2 cup each.

I made this recipe according to original directions with one exception I used shortening instead of butter which I tend to do with all my cookies and they came out amazing! I didn't have a problem with them spreading too much. I also made a simple icing of confectioners sugar and milk to top them.Great recipe!

As a base recipe, this is fine, but I only gave this a 3 because I had make too many changes so it was not the original recipe in the end that I tested out.  I think the amount of sugar recommended is too sweet.  I cut back to 1/2 cup of white sugar and it was still too sweet personally.   I also used wholemeal flour and not white flour. I wanted to make mine a bit healthier so I added about 1/4 cup of ground flaxseeds.    My oven is super hot so baking at 190c started to brown them too quickly so I had to lower my oven down to 160c.  I also found that after just 9 minutes, they were turning really brown at the edges, but were just too soft even after cooling.  I ended up putting them back in the oven on low heat 150c for another 5 minutes and left them in the oven to cool. This created a much firmer cookie that held it's shape and still soft and chewy when bitten.    Some people said their cookies were flat when baked.  I had the opposite problem. My cookie dough mixture was very firm (even without cooling in the fridge) and I actually had to flatten the tops of them before baking otherwise they were just too thick in the middle.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out dark, flat, crunchy around the edges and the cookies just didn't stick together. I used a dark pan and a little bit of Pam also. I will wait and see if they set up better after they cool, but I doubt it.

Not a bad recipe at all. I didn't have any issues with it. I just stayed true to the recipe and it made a nice old fashion Oatmeal Raisin Cookie. Thumbs up to Darlene.

This recipe was perfect.  The "only" thing I really did differently was soak my raisins in hot water at the beginning for about 10 minutes.

The cookies were chewy and not hard at all.  After three days they still taste fresh.  No more purchasing cookies from the local supermarket.

I would highly recommend making this recipe.  I was very hesitate after reading some reviews of the batter running while in the oven; however, using my amazing Kitchenaid mixer, made the recipe work like a charm.

Thanks for posting!

I was skeptical to make this because of some of the reviews but I made two batches. My boys and husband usually don't care what kind of cookies I make, just so long as I make them but now all they want are these oatmeal raisin cookies! I didn't change anything except doubled the recipe and now I am off to the kitchen to make them again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful recipe. The only thing I did differently was in place of the e 1 C raisins I used 1/2 C raisins - 1/2 C craisins and 1/4 C walnuts. It was awesome!!!!! Will definitely be making these again

I ended up having to double the cooking time to even remotely have something I could lift off of the aerated cookie sheet. Even then they barely stayed together. I certainly wouldn't make these again.

Excellent oatmeal raisin cookies. Admittedly, I read through a half dozen reviews and decided to add the extra quarter cup of flower and bit of baking powder to the mix to make sure the consistency was right. (Also a few dashes of nutmeg and a bit more cinnamon than the recipe indicated for flavor.) Long story short -- made 3 dozen cookies not including the ~2 that I ate raw, cooked in 8 minutes to 8 minutes 15 seconds...tastes great, texture is good and looks about like you'd expect.

Great recipe. Great cookies I couldn't leave alone until they were all gone.. thankfully had friends over for coffee when we tried these. I would like to try a variation of this by adding some unsweetened applesauce, since that's how we used to make them when I was growing up. Or, if you just want a great traditional home-made cookie, this is it.

Use real butter! I used 1/2cup of real butter and 1/2 cup of butter crisco! I used parchment paper to bake on. And baked 9 mins. Cookies came out perfect. Tips, Soften butter to room temp, and eggs also.

These cookies were not good at all. They cooked perfectly. But the cookies were bland and minus any flavor. I'm not a professional but I've done better baking up a batch of cookies freestyle. This is not a keeper.

Mmmmm! Fan-fricken-tastic. I think its the Vanilla that makes these oatmeal raisin cookies special. I had NO trouble with sticking (as opposed to other cookies??) Maybe you need new cookie sheets if this were a problem.) I tried the raisin soaking tip - Thanks Karen_M! Made them nice and soft after being baked. ZEROGIRL42 try only baking them for 9 minutes. They turned out soft and chewy for me! A++

Made these today.  I should have read the reviews first!  The flavour is excellent, but they are too 'soft'.  They didn't run but I should have added the baking powder and more flour like some of the reviewers said.  Next time I will!

I tried this recipe today.  Unfortunately, my cookies stuck like glue to the cookie sheet.  I tried greasing the sheets and I tried using parchment paper.  No luck.  These cookies turned out very flat.   I was really disappointed.  I added additional cinnamon, cloves and allspice as well.  The flavor was acceptable but the cookie was just too much trouble to try again.   I'll be looking for another Oatmeal Raisin cookie recipe.

I love the texture of these cookies,but its a good thing I added extra spices,because they were kind of bland. Three teaspoons cinnamon and one each of nutmeg and ginger.I was out of allspice,that would have kicked them up a notch. All those added antioxcidents!! YUmmy!

This recipe didn't work for me.  These weren't even cookie-shaped; it all just spread into 1 pancake on the sheet, and in 4 minutes the bottoms were already brown, but the top soaking wet. I followed the recipe to the T.

I am not a cook, baker, or super talented in the kitchen to say the least. I just started to really dive into cooking within the last 6 months. I have to say I have made these cookies about 4 times in the last 3 months alone. The best oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted ( and I have eaten a lot of OMR cookies in 26 years ) They came out soft in the middle and hard on top, and I could REALLY taste the cinnamon. They also freeze extreamly well, and great make ahead cookies!! 

Few things I did do differently after I made them a few times 

1. Plump the Raisins : I brought a cup of water to a rolling boil then added a splash of vanilla, a bit of cinnamon, brown and white sugar  and  and placed the half of cup of raisins in the water for about 10 to 15 min with the lid on. Took them off the heat and let them sit till the water was cool ( about a hour or so) Then drain them of ALL the excess water so you don't have soggy cookies. Use as normally would. It makes all the difference. 

2. After you make the cookie dough you must let it sit in the refrigerator for about 4 hours. This is not a deal-breaker but it just makes the flavor of the vanilla and cinnamon much more powerful. I found this out by accident when I was called about for the afternoon and put the dough in the fridge. I will never make cookies ..any cookies without letting it sit for an afternoon.

Delicious cookie!  I followed the basic part of this recipe but used cherry infused dried cranberries in place of the raisins.  I added chopped almonds and white chocolate chips.  The second batch I used blueberry infused dried cranberries, lemon in place of the vanilla and added a few dark chocolate chips and some pecans.  Great recipe and I used up lots of little bits of ingredients I had around.

I've made these twice. Turned out perfect the first time, the second time, they didn't have as much flavor, so I sprinkled them with cinnamon. (obviously I did something wrong)
I'm getting ready to make them again. KEEP IN MIND.... this recipe calls for LIGHT brown sugar. Dark contains more molasses. I only ever have dark on hand, so I cut t with white sugar. I also used 1.5 cups of flour and added 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp cloves as others recommended.
I always use my silicone pan liners or parchment paper when baking. Never an issue with stuck cookies!
Bottom line.... A KEEPER!! Thank you for sharing, Darlene!

After many modifications suggested in many other reviews, and a few of my own, they turned out well. For someone who has never made cookies from scratch this recipe and reviews of the recipe is a gook place to start. I reduced the recipe to half and I still reduced the flour to 2 cups instead of 2 1/2 as suggested. I halved the amount of brown and white sugar and added a little bit of honey. I used baking powder rather than soda I doubled the spices suggested, and added some apple butter I happened to have. I thought they weren't spicy enough, and kind of thick. My neighbors loved them though!

I tried these cookies today. I bake at least twice a week and was looking forward to using a different oatmeal recipe. I won't make these again. While the batter tasted amazing, they came out completely flat and stuck to my cookie sheets. Unfortunately they looked nothing like the ones in this picture. If you don't like flat cookies (I know that some people do), these probably aren't the ones for you.

Good recipe. i changed sugar to 1 cup dark brown (all I had) and used coconut oil instead of butter. They were moist and chewy delicious.
Thank you for the recipe.

These cookies are delicious!  However, I needed to add extra flour(1/4 c.) so they would puff up insead of going thin and flat.

I followed the recipe as written except I decreased the cinnamon and put in 1/2 cup golden raisins and 1/ cup craisins...they turned out pretty good. They did spread out a bit but they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I will make them again and add more raisins and craisins.

Some of the reviews scared me off and tried another receipe, shame on me!  These are the best, just what I wanted, not flat and crispy but not doughey and tasteless.  There are just right!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfection.  Perfect combination of a little crunch and a little chew!  Why make cookies if they aren't 100 times better than anything you can buy??

I made these cookies last night - and they were a hit! Added a full teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as extra raisins. Rolled the dough into balls to get the circular shape cookies (like in the picture), all baked evenly. No issues with cookies sticking to parchment paper! Overall, will definitely bake again!

Add an additional 1/4 c. flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder and they won't flatten out into paper-thin sheets.
9 min was perfect baking time for me.

Oatmeal Raisin are one of my favorite cookies.  No complaints here.  I did add a little more cinnamon.  They turned out great.  Some said they were too sweet.  Not at all.  But I don't think anything can be too sweet.

For those who love sweets but are watching calories and fat content, I used Splenda in place of white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and substituted butter for 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil.

Taste was excellent however cookies didn't spread because of lack of butter and where a little cakey, but none the less good texture and flavor.

A NOTE for those who use butter... my baking experience with butter based cookies is after mixing everything, put the bowl in the fridge for 15 minutes to harden up the dough a bit and in between batches. helps a lot in keeping the cookies from spreading too much.

Do not waste your time or ingredients on these cookies.  I even mixed by hand as one reviewer recommended, and they still came out flat and the edges cooked way faster than the middle and they were hard to remove from the pan, and when I did get them removed, the cookies fell apart.  I have had  much better tasting oatmeal raisin cookies.

The recipe is easy to follow along. I found the final product not good, though. The cookies turned into flat, hard disks. Not chewy at all. I think the oats should be reduced and perhaps add a bit more flour. I would also add a bit more cinnamon because the final product wasn't cinnamonny enough.

Awesome cookies!  Made a few changes as I wanted an applesauce/oatmeal cookie.  I used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. applesauce; eliminated white sugar and used 1 c. of brown; 3/4 c. unbleached flour and 3/4 c. whole wheat; 1 t. of cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg; soaked raisins in warm water while mixing the batter.  Baked for 10 minutes at 350 on parchment paper.  They turned out extremely soft and moist, didn't spread very much, which I like.  I didn't taste the applesauce very much, but I wouldn't increase it without adding more flour.  Not sure what that would do to the texture.  All in all, a very yummy cookie!  I might substitute chocolate chips next time for the raisins.

Good recipe! Was crunchy on the edge and soft and chewy in the middle. My only tweak was adding an extra tsp of cinnamon and only using 2/3 white sugar.

These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had! They are soft and moist when they come out of the oven and when they cool they are chewy and delicious! I will definitely make these again! Oh and BTW these work great with whole wheat flour... a healthier choice! Thanks for submitting.

If you like your cookies moist and chewy, refrigerate the dough for 10-15 min. before baking them. Drop the dough onto the cookie sheets and refrigerate, then bake until the top is golden. I did this unintentionally and they came out GREAT! I love chewy cookies even though my sons prefer them crunchy.

Awesome!  They were excellent added coconut, choc. chips too! Honestly, everyone enjoyed them ....  I printed out the recipe & 14 copies later still getting rave reviews.  
Depending on your oven u may want to take them out a few mins. before cook time. Also just to be safe I did spray the pan.  No air cookie sheets , use a regular cookie sheet.
Enjoy they are so good!

I did tweak this with a little more flour and less sugar (1/2 C white, 3/4 C  brown). I also used white whole wheat flour, which adds some fiber. I rolled the dough into balls, which made for very nice, puffy cookies. As others have noted, don't use a mixer after creaming the butter and sugar. Mix it in by hand and DON'T overmix.

These turned out perfect for us, although we did use shortening instead of butter (no other ingredient changes).  I also heated the oven to 350 and then turned it to 375 when I put the cookies in.  I cooked them like this for 9 minutes and they were perfect!!!

Easy recipe! I substituted 1/4 t pumpkin pie spice for 1/4 t cinnamon. I made large size cookies and they taste GREAT! 

MIX BY HAND! If you overwork your cookie dough these will turn out flat :)

With the tips that Rebecky gave, these were just perfect. Here in Korea, I have to use a toaster oven and cookies usually go flat. I was reluctant to use my hard-to-come-by oats, but so glad I did. Tastes just like home sweet home!

O.K. So I am not a great cookie baker but these seemed easy enough! I should have read the reviews first, they taste great but completely flattened when I baked them. They were edible but my kids had to eat them like granola, all broken and crushed. They really stuck to the pan too.

What a wonderful tasting cookie!  Since we are not big raisin fans I put mini choc chips. Some people added extra flour because they do bake up as a thin cookie if your batter is not slightly chilled before baking.   This is definately a keeper!

I always have my two year old help me measure and add ingredients. i now have granola chunks instead of cookies.I am very dissapointed that if there is a problem with the recipe, the owner/author doesnt acknowledge it and go back and add/change it. they are delicious, but what. a. mess. Please, author, fix this recipe.

These were delicous and baked up perfect once I got the hang of it.  I started baking them on convection mode but they were browning too quickly so I turned off the convection and lowered temperature to 365F.  They were so good.....I might bake them a tish shorter next time so they turn out chewier and maybe add some pecans or walnuts..  Will make again!!

Excellent! I omitted the raisons b/c I had none on hand, added 1 tsp of cinnamon and I mixed everything with a wooden spoon not an electric mixer. I used parchment paper to bake. They turned out perfect and delicious.

This cookie receipe is AMAZING! I am limited in my dessert options because I nurse twin boys that are allergic to Milk protein, Soy and Tree nuts. With this receipe, I can substitute butter for my dairy and soy free butter for an 'MSPI diet' approved dessert!

These were amazing, however if you like some spice in your cookies you will need to add more cinnamon! Otherwise these had a great light texture and stay soft and chewy!

I have only made an account so I could review this recipe. I must say that I had very high hopes for these cookies; went out and bought the ingredients about a week and a half ago, was really excited about baking these because they're my favorite type of cookie and my fiancé has never had them before. I really raved them up! I followed the recipe, taking note of what other reviewers have stated. I'm not a newbie when it comes to baking. I do know a thing or two about cooking/baking so I wasn't expecting these to be such a disaster! 

They're all completely flat and they've all fallen apart - I've even left them to cool for nearly 20 minutes. And now I'm stuck with about 50 cookies. I baked them for a friend's house warming party, but because of my time constraint I had to go out and buy stuff from a bakery. 
Never before now have I given a recipe a rating of 1/5. What a disappointment!

These were amazing! I added more cinnamon and cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup. I did not need any extra flour. The cookies were NOT flat. Oh and I did soak the raisins in hot water to plump them up a bit. I will definitely make these again!

These were a hit! Read a lot of reviews on this and changed 2 things. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. I also added 1 full teaspoon of cinnamon. I soaked the raisins in warm water for an hour before adding them to the mixture, they were perfect. I used quick cooking oats instead of rolled oats. I've made this recipe 3 times now. My friends and family loved them. I've already shared this recipe with 2 other people, will keep spreading this one around.

Exactly what I was looking for! Stayed gooey, and thicker, not flat like a pancake the way other recipes have turned out. I used Craisins, and they were awesome! Would be great to add pecans too.

Making these cookies right now for my husband for Valentines Day since he LOVES oatmeal raisin cookies...just sampled the first batch...delish!  The cinnamon adds a lot and the taste is different than any other oatmeal cookies.  For me they are too sweet and I would reduce the sugar next time but I think my husband will love them the way they are ...yum..yum

I halfend the receipe just to test. Totally great! I let the butter set at room temp until soft. I used hand mixer just for the butter & sugars then used a large spoon for the remaining mixing. Instead of all raisins I used some cranberries also and few pecans. I baked on parchment paper about 12 minutes though. Otherwise I used the exact amount of ingredients the recipe called for. My hubby was impressed!

I really like using butter so this recipe is great. The only change I made was I used golden raisins instead since that's what I had on hand. The family LOVES them. (9 minutes in the oven is perfect--I thought they seemed too soft, but don't let that fool you)

Amazing recipe as is. I have to keep them in my oven for exactly eight minutes and they come out perfect AFTER you cool them. Wait to eat them or they'll be mushy (but also wonderful!)

Just Perfect!  I often find when following a recipe exactly as it is written the first times leaves little room for disappointment.  I did this, only adding a little nutmeg and ground cloves to the cinnamon(I'm a spice girl).  8 and 1/2 minutes is the magic baking time for me and my oven.  They came out wonderful.  To those who had a bad experience I cant imagine why if the directions were followed.  All I can guess is a runny consistancy can result from MELTING the butter instead of SOFTENING it.  Also I have never heard of presoaking the raisins, it is completely unneccesary and would also add to a runny texture, as a result of too much moisture.  Anyway, I misplaced my standby recipe.  I'm glad I did, I found this one and it's my new go to oatmeal cookie recipe!

I loved these cookies!!  I did make some changes as well.  I find that if you use 1/2 cup of shortening and 1/4 cup of butter you get a cookie that is not flat and not real fat either.  I also used more cinnamon about 1 1/2 tsp.  Will definately make these again.

They tasted fantastic! Like true oatmeal raisin cookies. But baking them was a horror. Every batch was stuck to the pan, despite using every cookie trick I knew. The were flat and lifeless. It really dissapointed me because I have found so many great cookie recipies on this site, but this one I will not be using again.

This is the best oatmeal raisin cookied I've ever made.  They come out super soft and flat which I like.  I don't like a cake like cookies.  Superb flavor, I ate half the batch in one sitting.

Good recipe. I followed the previous reviewers' advice and added 1/4 cup extra flour and the cookies came out great. I have made them with 3/4 cup each walnuts and chocolate chips, or walnuts and dried cranberries, and they're both delicious.

Did add a little extra flour, cinnamon and less sugar...and soaked the raisins. Don't think that you could burn these cookies crispy! They are soft and chewy just they way I wanted. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe! The cookies were so good. I would recommend half cup of white sugar and half of brown it is plenty!, I didn't add the salt and I love cinnamon so I did 3 tsp and vanilla 2 tsp.  Next time I will add craisins and some allspice.  Try this recipe, they vanished from the cookie jar...

This recipe makes the perfect oatmeal raisin cookie!  I made this exactly as written and they were incredible, especially the next day.  They were chewy, not too doughy, densely packed with oats and had a wonderfully rich flavor with the perfect amount of cinnamon.  I wouldn't change a thing!

I'm giving this recipe a lower review because you need the substitutions to make really great cookies.  I followed the 1/4 c extra flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder additions.  along with soaking the raisins.  The cookies turned out great- no flat or running-together cookies.  They aren't too sweet either.  I'm glad I didn't risk my ingredients by trying to recipe as-written.

Really tasty recipe, but didn't quite turn out like I would expect a cookie to. It was more to the consistency of a soft rock cake. Very good either way!

very good cookie just as it is. Mine did not run, but I did use 1/4c whole wheat flour and 1c white. Next time I will use half wwflour and half white flour and add some ground flaxseed for more health benefits. I read the reviews after and maybe a good thing. I wish I would have doubled the recipe this time! I baked with convection and they baked equally as good on metal and stonewear.

I added the extra flour and baking soda and the cookies turned out great! They are a family hit! Also some people were complaining that the cookies stuck to the baking sheet, well with the alterations I made and with a little non-stick spray mine didn't stick at all. I am only giving four stars because I did have to alter the recipe to make it perfect. I wish I could give it four and a half! This recipe is worth making!

I read the reviews, but I am not sure what the problem other people had, this was an AWESOME cookie to make it, was not runny, in fact we found it a little dry. I used shortning instead of butter. We got 4 1/2 dozen cookies and they were not small, i took them out of the oven at 10 minutes and they didn't stick at all. To compensate for the dryness of the recipe, I added 1/2 cup of maple syrup but they are perfect and taste fabulous!!!

I made these cookies for a large family gathering. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out flawless. They were a huge hit. I think next time i will substitute craisins and add walnuts for some variety, but they are absolutely wonderful as is. I love finding recipes like this!

This is a great recipe, it was easy to make and the cookies were delicious. They're also great with certain add ons of your own (chocolate chips, walnuts, etc.) My daughter couldn't stop sneaking them from the cookie jar. I walked in on her pushing her toddler chair to the counter and quietly sneaking a couple cookies. LOL TOO CUTE!!

I have made this recipe twice, once with rolled oats and the second time with quick oats (didn't add raisins either time since I don't care for them).  I preferred it with quick oats.  Using the quick oats, I baked them for 7 minutes at 360 degrees (8 minutes for the rolled oats).  The second time I also added about 3 tablespoons extra flour.  I also added peanut butter chips (both times) which went really well with the oatmeal.  They were quite the hit at work!  I should have made a double batch because they didn't even last half the day.  Will definitely make again with the peanut butter chips!

Yum!  After reading some other comments I went ahead and halved the sugar...and since I'm always looking for healthy substitutes I used whole wheat flour (but added choc chips for the kids).  They were great!  I had to bake them slightly longer (could be my oven, not the first time that's happened) but they were great.  A soft, moist, perfect the next day, oatmeal cookie!  Will definitely make again (and will try adding some other goodies next time too to make them even healthier...ground nuts perhaps?)

Far too buttery-tasting for me.  Other than that, the consistency is perfect.  If I baked them again I would cut the butter by half, maybe add some applesauce and also cut down on the white sugar.  Would be good with nuts added.

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have made.  I added a touch more cinnamon.  I used golden raisins and I soaked them for a bit before adding them to the batter. The cookies were soft and chewy. A "healthy" treat.

These cookies are awesome!!    So easy to make…I did change a few things.  I only used ½ cup of white sugar, I didn’t have any raisins, so I used chocolate chips.  I baked the cookies at 350 degrees for 10 mins on parchment paper.  My family loved the cookies!!!

Not sure what happened, the cookies came out tasting fine, but the consistancy was all wrong.  Too crumbly; most of them broke when I removed them from the cookie sheets.  I reduced the sugar by about a third, and they were still more than sweet enough.  I increased the cinnamon and added a pinch of cloves.  As some reviewers suggested I soaked the raisins first, not sure if that affected the texture.  Also the cookies were burning at the edges but not cooked in the center after 9 minutes, so I think a lower cooking temperature would be better.  Will try other oatmeal cookie recipes.

This turned out great!  I halved the recipe and added 1/4 c extra flour and about 1/4 tsp b. powder, but judging by how well they kept their shape, I'm not sure I needed it.  I also added chocolate chips instead of raisins and cooked them on 350.  One tip for people who were having problems: if you grease the baking sheet, the cookies will spread while cooking!! make sure it is ungreased!  Thanks for posting, I will definitely keep this recipe around!

After reading the reviews about the cookies spreading too much, I was determined to make it work.  I chilled my dough for about an hour and a half before baking the cookies and I had no problems.  They required about 13 minutes to bake, but they turned out beautifully.  I always soak my raisins for baking in boiling water to soften them, and this time I got the inspiration to add some rum.  I really liked the additional zip that gave the cookies and would do it again.  Overall I was very pleased with these cookies.  They have a nice outer crunch with a softer center, and taste just like an oatmeal raisin cookie should.

Great cookies.  I followed others by using 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of 3/4, I also doubled the cinnamon.  Lastly, I soaked the raisins in warm water prior to adding them to the dough.  Came out great.

This was actually the first recipe I've ever used to try oatmeal raisin cookies and its great! I added a cup of butterscotch chips and they tasted soooo good that I'm making another batch to take in to work just for the heck of it!

I followed Rebecky's recommendations and the texture was perfect... crispy on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. Very good. I also soaked the raisins in hot water while I was mixing everything up which was a great idea... they came out plump and juicy. I have to say though that these cookies are quite blah in flavor. I doubled the cinnamon the second time which made them a bit tastier.

I followed this recipe to a T and it came out perfect!  Cookies were moist, soft, and a bit chewy.  Not sure what other reviewers meant about the cookies not being a flat because mine came out as flat as normal cookies are supposed to be.  I did soak the raisins in boiling water, as suggested by some reviews here, for a minute or two, and they became plump and softer.  I also used my KitchenAid mixer to stir the ingredients together rather than by hand as some reviews suggested, and again no problem on my end.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I love this recipe - but the first time I made it, I didn't have plain oats.  I had instant quaker oatmeal, apple cinnamon.  Guess what?  I sifted out the cinnamon best I could and some of the apple, didn't add cinnamon the way the recipe said, and the cookies came out absolutely delicious.  Either way, thank you Darlene....

These cookies are awesome. This recipe was passed on to me by a cowboy friend of mine who loved them, so I decided to make them to see for myself... and they really were delicious. My 50 yr. old aunt said they were the best oatmeal raisin cookies she had ever tasted in her whole entire life. :)

I have made them EXACTLY to recipe at least 10 times and they have turned out beautifully every single time. I have started making them with whole wheat flour now and we think they are even tastier this way.

These were really good. I did make a lot changes because they're for my dad whose trying to lower his cholesterol.  Ener-G Egg Replacer instead of eggs, Smart Balance Light instead of butter, and replaced 1/2 the all purpose flour with oat flour. I also only used a 1/2 C of each kind of sugar.

This recipe is, unfortunately, unusable without changes which is why I can't give it more than two stars. When you initially put the ingredients together (following the recipe line by line), it ends up looking like batter rather than dough.   I had to add an additional 1/2 cup + of flour to it. I added more cinnamon and nutmeg, but that's simply a matter of taste.  So while the end result is fine, it just wouldn't work "as is."

I had to make adjustments based on what was in the house.  Thankfully, all of them resulted in a better cookie than I would have gotten if I had stuck to the given recipe!   I only had one stick of butter, which turned out to be a good thing from the reviews of greasiness.  I've learned to always use at least 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I wondered if they were really serious with that 3/4 tsp.?  I also added nutmeg.  The only white sugar I had was powdered, so I used it and am glad I did.  My butter wasn't soft and I think that was a good thing.  I melted it down some on the warmer and then just cut up the rest of the cold butter into cubes.  I also simmered the raisins in warm water and cinnamon so they would be plumper, which is good.  I let the batter rest so it wasn't too runny before I put it on the cookie sheet.  I usually make cookies bigger than the recipes and that avoids them being too crispy - a good call for this particular recipe!  I fit about six on a cookie sheet.  The baking time was off so I just baked until they didn't look raw in the middle.    With these changes to the given recipe, the taste was great and so was the texture.  They weren't too crispy and didn't stick to the cookie sheet.  I ended up with yummy, chewy cookies that my family loved.  Unfortunately, this recipe needs too many changes in order to have yummy chewy cookies.  Next time I will just use the box top recipe.  I'm not printing this one out or saving it.

These came out great! I followed the recipe to a tee, and instead of 48 cookies, made 24. They tasted great. Despite what others said, these were a perfect consistancy before being baked...maybe others added too much butter? I got a little less than 24 cookies, but for some reason that always happens. :) Hope this helps.

Amazing Cookies!! However instead of putting the oatmeal as it is I blend it in a food processor beforehand that way the oatmeal is more combined and not as Chunky.Beforehand my family didn't like oatmeal cookies because you could taste the chunks and pieces of oats, now the cookies are devoured and everyone says they are DELICIOUS!!! I did however also cut the sugar a bit and only put 1/2 cup of each type of sugar and it was perfectly sweetened! I will def be making these cookies again. Also I add about 1/4 cup extra flour , without it I find that the cookies don't keep their shape, and are a bit too flat

I just made this recipe after searching for days for my mom's lost family recipe. I did what most people suggested and added 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2tsp baking powder to make sure the cookies didn't spread out too much. I alter all of these recipes to fit into my boyfriend and my vegan lifestyle (butter substitute and egg replacer) and this recipe turned out great. I will definitely use this recipe in the future, maybe adding some nuts next time...

These were awesome. I just added a bit of allspice and nutmeg to spice it up and they came out great. I found that if I let them cook for a bit longer then asked they are firmer. Enjoy

This was excellent and everyone loved them.  I ended up using all white sugar and dark molasses since I was out of brown sugar and had to add extra flour because of the molasses.  I mixed this using my kitchen aid and had no problem with the cookies being flat and found that the oven temp and time was right on.  Will be making this again soon.

i tried this recipe, never again.  when i baked them it turned into an oatmeal raisin pizza, they all ran together and i had to scrape them off the pan and wash it and tried again with smaller portions and same results.  I threw the rest away, did not work at all.  I am on to another recipe and this one goes in the trash.

They turned out like burnt flat mooshy disks. They spread out really flat and were greasey yet somehow managed to stick to a nonstick pan. Do not make if you want good cookies!

ADD MORE FLOUR& BAKING SODA!! I broke my cardinal sin when baking from allrecipes, I forgot to read the reviews. These cookies taste perfect, but they fall flat, you need to add more flour and baking soda (1/4 c flour and 1/4 tsp of baking soda) they will fall flat and be runny if you don't. But, like I said taste wise these cookies are perfection! BTW, the batch I just cooked without the extra flour and baking soda, will somehow still manage to get eaten ;)

These are incredible! I've tried dozens of recipes for the perfect oatmeal raisin cookie, and this is the best one by far. Follow the recipe exactly (except for adding a few extra raisins!), the cookies spread out to the perfect thickness and are very chewy.

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe indicated, and the cookies came out perfectly! The kids and adults all loved them.   Next time I will probably take out a bit of the white sugar, just because there's so much of it, but this will be our standard oatmeal raisin cookie recipe going forward.

This is the worst Oatmail raisin cookies I have ever made. I did not read reviews before backing, all the cookies turned out flat and a lot of holes inside. I think this receipt needs to be refined.

I would give these cookies a five!  Our family whole family liked these cookies.  The second time I made them I did add an extra 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon... a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. ginger.... by accident (as I had another cookie recipe on the go) I put in a package of vanilla instant pudding mix.... o.k. will keep doing that, but not by accident.  I also cooked the raisins up ahead of time so that they would be plump and will definitely do that again as well.  Totally a keeper. With my modifications... I would like to give them six stars, but that isn't available.

very good when you get the oven temp just right. 375 was too hot for my oven, had to use 350 and adjust the timing. by the time I got all that figured out, only got a few perfect batches. Even over cooked they taste good. Thinner then some other oatmeal raisin cookies, but they held their own in my house! Thanks Darlene!

These were DELICIOUS, especially warm! I did make some modifications based on other users experiences. I increased the flour by 1/4 cup to reduce the flattening. I was short of oatmeal, so I reduced it to only 1 1/4 cups. Instead of raisins I chose to use chocolate chips. I baked them on a non-stick, ungreased cookie sheet for 7-8 minutes. They were the perfect thickness, size and taste! My husband's not a big cookie eater, but he devoured them! Thanks for the tasty recipe! This is definitely a keeper!

i just got done making these cookies and they are so delicious! i didnt read any of the reviews before making them and followed the recipe exactly until i got to the part to mix in the oats and raisins, i noticed the dough wasnt very thick so i added another cup flour. i would NOT recommend using only 1 1/4 cups flour use 2 1/4! i bake cookies at least once a week and ive learned to get the fluffy cookies that are soft in the center and crunchy on the outside you need the right amount of flour the dough needs to be kinda thick. very good recipe. i will use it again!

Best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had! I used 1 tps of cinnamon instead and heated the oven to 350F, but followed the rest of the recipe exact and my cookies came out perfect, the edges are crispy and the middle is moist and chewy.The recipe was simple and easy to do. I'll be making these again very soon.

I doubled the recipe but made it as written.  It was ok...the baking time was a bit off....different ovens probably.  Maybe because I doubled the recipe is why mine werent so good.  They weren't thin...almost too thick.

Wow, these were great!  The dough was absolutely delicious (I can't help but sample the dough before baking...mmmm).  I ended up burning the bottoms of the cookies since I put two baking sheets into the oven and I think this trapped the heat in the bottom half of the oven.  But that was my fault!  I froze some of the dough for another day.  Yum!

I love this recipe.  This is my Husbands favorite cookie.  He works away from home  for weeks at a time so I always make sure there is a fresh batch waiting for him when he gets in.  He thinks I did something really special.  But it is so easy, and that is coming from someone who doesn't like to cook...

YUM! ADVICE: Definitely go with the extra 1/4C flower and 1/4t baking soda. Bring raisins to a boil and then take them off heat let them soak while making the mix. ALSO Im a huge spice fan so I added 1/4t nutmeg and then 1/8t ground black pepper.. sounds weird but it just gives it a delicious flavor boost! Also I used LESS SUGAR. I find that decreasing the sugar in most cookie recipies by a good 1/4C make SO little difference.. and especially with the raisins being so sweet already. Definitely making this again.

I made these cookies twice.  The firstime I baked them on an insulated cookie sheet and they were flat and greasy.  The next time I baked them on a shiney non-insulated cookie sheet and they turned out perfect.  Do not use an insulated cookie sheet when baking cookies with butter or oleo.

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made.  A huge hit with my husband, I too found that my first batch did stick a wee bit to the cookie sheet, but, then I used parchment paper on the cookie sheet, and cooked them one minute less, they were great, didn't stick to the paper, and no messy cookie sheet!!  they get 5 stars from me

This recipe was my first attempt at making oatmeal raisin cookies and it turned out amazing. I made this recipe for my boyfriend because oatmeal raisin cookies are his favorite, and he absolutely loved them. I'll definitely be making them again. Also, the touch of cinnamon in them is great!

I have had these cookies requested by dozens of people after I made them the first time.  The trick is not to bake them for the longest time, 8 minutes at MOST for me, they will not look done, but they are!  Also, make sure that they are allowed to cool on the baking sheet for approx 5 minutes prior to moving them to a cooling rack, otherwise they can be a soft gooey mess.  I also found that you absolutely can NOT melt the butter, it MUST be soft, but not melted if you want your cookies to turn out top notch.  EXCELLENT recipe, I make them at least once a month for family and friends.

Outstanding. I didn't add the full cup of raisins, and it helps if you let the butter soften completely before creaming (I creamed by hand). Tasted exactly like what my mother used to make. Delish.

I had trouble with my first batch of "test cookies": they turned out really flat.  After talking to my mom, she suggested that I chill the dough between batches, chill the pan, and lower the rack in my oven to one below center.  That helps the bottom of the cookies set sooner so they can't spread so much.  After making those changes, I had pretty good results.  I used chocolate-covered dried cherries instead of raisins, and substituted about 1/3 of the flour for whole wheat flour.  I also added a few extra spoons of flour because one reviewer mentioned the recipe needing more.  I'm pretty picky, so the fact that I'm willing to give these cookies as a gift shows that I liked them quite a bit.

I am sorry to say I had the same result as some other reviewers.  Flat, hard and greasy.  I added more flour to the second batch and they held together better but were still to greasy.  I would say the recipe needs some work.

This recipe is terrible.  I have baked alot in the past, and I like to consider myself to be a decent baker. I just made these cookies, and they turned out fine when I took them out of the oven. But once they cooled and sat for even 5 minutes, they turned hard and crunchy, like discs.  They're bareable, but not even close to wonderful.

I just finished baking these cookies and they turned out really well. I took another reviewer's advice and added 1/4 cup of flour and a 1/2 tsp of baking powder. Next time, however, I think I'll skip the extra flour so I can get a chewier cookie because that's the way I like 'em!

I just baked these cookies for the first time and they turned out GREAT!!  The only things I did differently were, instead of beating in the dry ingredients I folded them in my by hand.  Also, I soaked the raisins in boiled water for about 20 minutes prior to stir them into the rest of the mix.  I put ALOT more cinnamon, I kinda just shook and shook until I could smell the cinnamon from a distance (that's only because I LOVE cinnamon)  Wonderful recipe!!

The recipe was good...except my 1st batch turned out really flat & crispy! So I added a bit more flour & sugar, enough to make the dough easy to roll. I then rolled them into balls & baked em for about 9 minutes & they turned out much better. But hardened really fast...great coffee dipping cookies I guess!    :-)

These are yummy, chewy cookies. I had no issues with them being too flat like some reviews said. I baked them at 350 for 10 minutes and they came out great. My 3-year-old and I had fun mixing them by hand and getting messy!

Delicious. I made these exactly like the recipe called for.  I think using a heaping spoonful helped.  The cookies need to cool thoroughly before being moved, too. Yummy, chewy cookies...check after 5 minutes, though.

I wated to be nice and bake my grandfather some Oatmeal Rasin Cookies for his 76th birthday, as they are his favorite! I could not find my recipe that I usually use because we moved recently, and this one looked compatible. Seriously, the batter tasted great, but once they were cooked the cookies  flattened out and hardened immediately! I had to scrape them off my non-stick cookie sheets! For the second set that went into the oven, I reduced the amount of dough for each cookie AND the cook time! Same thing! And the third sheet I reduced the cook time even more - I was down to like 7 to 8 minutes at the provided temperature! All were hard as rocks!

This was my first time to make Oatmeal cookies and they turned out really well. The dough seemed a bit too sticky, so I'd maybe add some more flour next time. I took the second batch out of the oven a little earlier, so that the cookies are more moist. I would also put less sugar in them. Other than that, they were great! Everyone loved them and they were gone really quckly! Thanks for the recipe!

I just baked these and they smell delicious (the batter tastes great too!) My only addition to this recipe would be another 1/4 c of flour, 1/4 c of walnut pieces, 1/4 c butter, and some flaxseeds. You get a good dose of your omega-3s and some fiber! Super Power Cookie!

I just kind of eyeballed everything.
Did run. I learned to use a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon.

wow! This is the first perfect cookie I've ever made! I am so thrilled! I altered it just slightly with more 1 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup of white, also, when I went to add the oatmeal, I noticed that I had run out, so I substituted the oatmeal with instant oatmeal, the cinnamon flavor and apple flavor! It was so delicious! Thanks!

After reading the reviews- I changed the recipe slightly and the cookies were WONDERFUL!
Hand mix for sure all the ingredients and then I was able to roll into balls, and flatten slightly.
I increased the flour to 1 3/4 c, increased the oats to 3 C, and increased the baking soda to 2 tsp.
I also used 1 cup of chocolate covered raisins, and 1/2 cup of regular raisins.
EVERYONE LOVED these cookies! They raised well and had an excellent flavor! Will make them again and again!

These cookies tasted absolutely delicious. I read the advice not to over stir a little too late. I think that may have made them a little thin. I soaked the raisins too. I'll make them again for sure.

This is the recipe I have been looking for. I left out the raisins and added,   coconut and ground flax seed and ground hemp, which give them a nutty flavour. Delicate and light, very nice

These cookies were delicious!  The only thing I did differently was to soak my raisins while I was preparing the cookies and I added extra cinnimon.  They were chewy and tasty.

I absolutely loved these oatmeal raisin cookies.  I am a novice baker but trying new things.  I searched for a oatmeal raisin cookie recipe on the internet and this was the first one I found.  The recipe looked good so I tried it out.  I did everything according to the recipe and they turned out amazing.  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to beat the butter with the sugars and the flour.  I however, mixed the oats by hand.  Also, I used quick cooking oats because I had no rolled oats, so that may have made a difference.  I just signed up with allrecipes.com and next time I want to make something new I am going to search for recipes here.

I thought they were delicious. They're not the prettiest looking cookie, but they taste delicious. Crispy on the outside and chewy towards the center.

Excellent recipe! I normally make spicier oatmeal cookies, however I found this was perfect for substituting blueberries for raisins since the berries were not overpowered. I couldn't resist adding a little dash of nutmeg hough. Very versatile.

Great taste, but like the other reviews, the cookies ran, came out flat and stuck to the pan.

I just added more flour to the remaining dough...I'll keep my fingers crossed on how the rest turn out.

These were just okay for me.... some of them 'ran' on the pan, and they stuck slightly.... I tried them on ungreased pan, some on silpat and some on parchment and they all slightly stuck.  Nothing major, only ruined 1 or 2, but worth mentioning.  Worth making, good taste combo, but definitely not the best

My husband is not a big fan of sweets, but he has asked for these specific cookies more than once since I made them. They are perfect! I did use butter(as advised) and they were a nice height and consistency. I did refrigerate my dough in between baking sheets. Thank you! These are wonderful!

This is the worst recipe I have ever used for cookies.  You must be missing an ingredient because they come out like flat bricks that are stuck on so badly I had to use a grill scraper to get them off the pan.  I was so disappointed in this recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! I did have to toss the first batch, but my oven was running extremely hot. I reduced the heat to 350 degrees an the rest of the cookies came out beautifully. The trick for me was letting these cookies sit on the pan for a couple of minutes before I moved them to the rack, or they would fall apart because they were just too warm. Sent these to husband's office, didn't get a single one back!

This is a delicious oatmeal raisin recipe! The cookies come out soft and chewey...They are delicious! I didn't have light brown sugar on hand so I substituted with dark brown, but I changed the measurement to 1/2 cup (I still used 3/4 cup of the white sugar). I also used a teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 3/4 tsp. Overall, I'm very glad I found this recipe! For me, these cookies didn't spread out flat at all. They came out perfect. I'll definately make them again and again.

These cookies are very good! Very moist and fall apart, easy, simple, a great cookie for all ages. The only thing that I can suggest is to lightly grease the cookie trays so the cookies do no stick as much when taking them off. Other then that awesome cookie, recommend to everyone!

Great cookies, soft middles, chewy edges. A bit on the sweet side though. The raisins are really sweet in this, so maybe you could cut back some of the sugar? Mild flavor, not spiced as a lot of oatmeal cookies are. These didn't spread much at all. I used margarine instead of butter. Thanks Darlene for a very good cookie!

These are spectacular and highly addicting. I found them to be too sweet however. They also had trouble holding but I will experiment with cookie size, and baking time. Great recipe!

These turned out really good! I had a craving for oatmeal raisin cookies so I chose this recipe to make them. They're chewy in the middle and a little crispy on the outside, exactly the way I like them.

I just now finished making these cookies and as a first time oatmeal cookie maker, I found these cookies to be very quick and delicious. The only modification I had to make was to double the cinnammon as another reviewer said. They turned out a little flat but very very good! I hope my husband likes them but he is picky sometimes so if he doesn't like them then there's more for me!

These were really good!! I added just a touch of ginger and a teaspoon each of ground cloves and allspice for a little extra flavor. I also doubled the cinnamon. Cooking for 10 minutes left the cookies too soft for the cooling rack, but 15 minutes worked perfectly! Loved these!!

These were the BEST oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever eaten.  I added about a cup or so of Butterscotch chips and a few extra raisins.  I couldn't keep my hands out of the cookie jar! They were gone in no time at all.

These made one of the moistest cookies ever. Everyone loved them! Between my house and office, the batch barely lasted three days. The only change I made was cutting each of the sugars down to a half cup. I also used extra moist raisins meant for baking (just to give it a try), which I think made a difference. I will definitely make these again, and double the recipe this time!

This is a great recipe. I adapted it and used a combination of cransins and chocolate chips instead of raisins. People love these cookies and beg for more!

Fantastic cookies!! I didn't do anything special although I did bake them at 350 (for about 11 minutes) and they came out terrific - I added a cup of chocolate chips and deleted the cinnamon and I added probably more than a cup of raisins although I didn't measure.  Didn't stick or fall apart - they are great.  Hubby and son are working their way through them quite quickly! Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper.

These cookies were great.  I thought the recipe was very easy to follow and they came out perfect. I bought Sun Maid 'baking raisins' so I didn't have to boil them. I added a little extra cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg and they turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

We have been through a lot of different oatmeal raisin recipes and most have turned out very puffy and dry. This one was not. Very good and a household favorite so far. Thanks for sharing!!!

I just made these. Yum! After reading several reviews, I boiled my raisins, then dried them. I also added 1/2t baking powder (since some reviews mentioned them being flat), and an extra 1/2t cinnamon (because I love it) and a 1/2t nutmeg. I think they'd be even better if I had bigger oats... mine were rather small, even though rolled.

Just finished baking them! Really good. I added more cinnamon and a pinch of allspice and had to substitue a bit of oil for a missing egg, but they came out fabulous! I used all organic ingredients which makes the flavors much richer (and better for you!)

Chewy and tasty.  Love the cinnamon!  Of course, I used more raisins than called for.  Will make again, maybe try with dried cranberries and raisins next time.

My husband's favorite cookie! I am a chocolate chip girl, but these come in a close second. I add a little nutmeg and cloves to give them extra spice and only bake them for 8 minutes. They look underdone when you pull them out, but they firm up when cooled. So soft and chewy!

The cookies became really runny on the cookie sheet,several of them turned into giant globs of oatmeal cookie, lol.  They *are* thin, as many have said, but I sort of enjoyed the crisp edges and softer middles.  I like fluffy cookies also, but the "thinness" didn't bother me.  I always grease the pan though, so I didn't have any problems getting them off.

I might make the recipe again...

As for taste, this cookie is fantastic. But I do have to agree with other reviewers--the cookie flattens out a whole lot and breaks easily (I had some trouble getting them off the cookie sheet. I would recommend greasing, though the recipe doesn't call for it.) I don't remember anyone else commenting on it, but this recipe makes more than 48 for sure! I made them bigger than the recipe said to, yet I made 5 dozen--with a little extra batter left to spare. And that's with my cookies getting progressively bigger by each batch. For the bigger cookies, I just turned down the temp 20 degrees and cooked an extra one or two minutes. I also didn't put cinnamon since I discovered that I didn't have any after already starting--oops. But it still turned out tasty.

These cookies taste good, however, the really flatten out.  If you are looking for a fluffy cookie, this recipe isn't for you.  Also, they break apart very easily.

Excellent recipe!  Everyone that tastes these cookies adores them.  This recipe is also great with small substitutions, i.e. chopped up dried apricots instead of raisins or some semisweet chocolate chips!  A favorite!

Amazing! I love this recipe. I've never been quite satisfied with my oatmeal cookies in the past, but I can finally say that with this recipe, I have pride in my cookies. I made some without raisins for my picky younger brothers and they also tasted good. I added a bit more cinnamon and vanilla to make them more fragrant, and they were totally amazing. Thanks! -peace

Very easy to make, with soft, chewy results.  I made slightly larger cookies, ending up with 35, so they took a little longer to bake, about 12 minutes.
I took these to work and within 4 hours, they were nearly gone, and everyone went on about how fantastic they were.
I'll definately be making these again.

These cookies were so easy to make and they came out great. Follow the baking time if you want cookies on the softer side. I left mine in longer and they were pretty crispy. Still good though!

These cookies were great. I had to cut back the temp. on my oven to 350 and cook a bit longer because the first batch appeared to cook to fast. When I did this I just left them in the oven a bit longer..but they turned out great, and I plan to make them again..ty

These were ok.  They turned out really thin and went hard almost instantly.  They were not all that tastey. I wish I would have stuck with my other oatmeal cookie recipe, kind of a waste of ingrediants.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and everyone that tried these cookies, loved them, especially my husband.  I did make a few variations to the recipe as another person suggested in the earlier comments.  I soaked the raisins in warm water prior to proceeding with the recipe.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and an additional 1/4 cup flour.  Great recipe.  If I could, I would give it 100 stars.

These were EXCELLENT and I SUCK at cooking!  I didn't have rolled oats, I only had quick oats and they still came out wonderful!  I soaked the raisins in boiling water, which was recommended in the reviews, and what a difference it made.  I recommend this for all people who want to pretend they know what they're doing!

very good! I suggest adding more raisins than what the recipe calls for. Maybe a half a cup more. Just be carefull not to leave them in a minute too long or else they will be too hard.

We made this recipe using only 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar  and these turned out well.  We made 1/2 the batch with raisins and 1/2 the batch with chocolate chips.  A good simple recipe.

Very easy to make and very yummy.  Made these for an oatmeal raisin cookie lover for his birthday and he absolutely loved it.  Especially since I followed others suggestions and made them with the blonde raisins.  Very nice twist to an old fashioned cookie.  Will definitely make again this time for the entire office.

I make these cookies all the time and everyone loves them!  I use 1/4 more of the following: butter, sugar, brown sugar, oats, and flour and add 1 tsp of nutmeg.  They are a hit at work.  Everyone begs for them.  They say they are the BEST oatmeal raisin cookies ever.  They stay soft for a long time and are yummy!!!  Great recipe!!!!!

Yummy!  These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies i've made yet!  They stay nice and soft, but not crumbly soft.  I did add about a half teaspoon of ginger powder, about a teaspoon more of cinnamon, and two pinches of all spice, and they came out great!  Thank you

This cookie recipe is great!  My husband and son, both chocolate cookie lovers and oatmeal haters, LOVED this cookie.  I did alter the recipe a bit--I used 1 c brown & 1/2 cup white sugars, doubled the cinnamon and added 1/2t nutmeg. This cookie does spread while baking, so it is really important to heap the dough on the baking sheets.

This is the first time I've tried oatmeal cookies,don't have them in New Zealand, so I can't compare this recipe with any others.This recipe is very easy and quick, I think next time I might try it without the spice.

Super flavor in these cookies. They stayed soft for several days. I will use margerine instead of butter and all brown sugar next time as they spread to be very thin during baking. The amount of oatmeal and raisins are PERFECT in this recipe. I can't wait to try it with the alterations.

Myself and 4 kids made these for a family party and everyone loved them. This comes from a person who barely knows where the kitchen is. My only complaint is, I did'nt make enough.

I've been searching for years for an oatmeal cookie recipe that I like and I've finally found one!!  Not too crispy, not too soft, much better than the one listed on the Quaker Oats containers. My whole family loved them :).

I was disappointed by this recipe, given the terrific reviews. I added chocolate chips to this recipe and doubled the cinnamon. Despite this, I found the cookies to be a bit boring with an overwhelming taste of oatmeal (yes, I know it's an oatmeal cookie!). I think this recipe is more fit for oatmeal lovers. The cookies, however, did stay moist and chewy when cooled.

This is an easy recipe but the amount of flour needs to be increased by approx. 1/2 cup because the batter is too soft & the cookie spread out too thin. The other option is to blend some additional oats to make approx 1/2 cup and add to the batter.

This is a great recipe. I followed the recipe and the cookies came out great. I read other reviews and some said their cookies came out dry. So this is what I did:

Soaked the  raisins in vanilla extract and 1/2 cup of Baileys Irish Cream

Added more of:

3 TBSP of butter
1 more TBSP of cinnamon 
A pinch more of salt

My batter was a little wet so when you scoop it onto the parchment just form them into round circles, I pat mine down so they would bake evenly (don’t like soggy cookies!) I baked them on parchment paper (on the cookie sheet)  and when they were golden brown, I let them cool for 5 minutes, then I inverted them onto the baking sheet, baking  the underside to make them crispy on both sides. They were delicious with  that CRUNCH! 
 Hands down a simple and easy recipe. I had some left over batter so I sealed the rest in a Tupperware to bake throughout the week. 
Thank you for this easy and delightful recipe! My kitchen smells wonderful!

I’ve made these cookies at least five times now and the whole family loves them! I’ve recently made them for my neighbors and they’ve asked us to make them again! The only minor adjustment I would make is the size of cookie mix you lay out on the pan. It’s best to make it about teaspoon size plus a little extra. Besides that, it tastes amazing and fresh every time you make it!

I cut the white sugar by 1/2 cup and added 1/4 to the brown sugar. But I prefer a less sweet cookie and make this adjustment with most recipes. Once offered to co-workers, they were gone within 15 minutes.  So everyone had 3-4 cookies. Will make again.

Made this with Craisins instead of raisins.  They were fantastic.  Put half in a tin with a piece of bread for soft and the others in a normal tin for crispy.

I substituted the sugar for splenda and the brown sugar for splenda brown sugar blend to cut down on the sugar content and they turned out amazing!!!!   Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!!! 
P.s. I don't do well with sugar and that's why I chose to substitute the sugar.

They're tasty, no doubt. BUT, there is absolutely no reason to use as much sugar as is called for in the recipe. I should have cut down the sugar a bit and they would have been perfect.

Directions are easy to follow.  I made adjustments for cooking in a convection oven for the time.  I discovered that using the convection oven I still needed to set the temperature at 375 degrees to keep the cookies shape.  It tasted delicious.

I used craisins and walnuts and substituted truvia for the white sugar.  They baked on parchment paper. The result was a very tasty cookie with a perfect balance of crispy to chewy.

These cookies turned out AMAZING! After reading the reviews I decided to use 1/2 cup of sugar. I used almond extract instead of vanilla and it gave the cookies a awesome flavor! Will definitely make these again

First time making this! Loved this bread! Only 2 changes. I used 2 cups of sugar and 1/2 c oil and 1/2 cup  applesauce for the 1 cup of oil. In making any  bread I always cut down on the sugar and split the oil to a 50-50 oil/applesauce ratio. After making this it seemed to lack that punch of spices maybe it was that extra cup of sugar I left out  hum Pairing it with a  sugar cinnamon butter! That was the ticket! Delicious!

Followed recipe except per others' suggestions: soaked raisins, cut white sugar to 1/2c, added 1/4t allspice, 1/4t ground cloves.
To try and preserve the body of the cookie, I was careful to barely mix the dry into the wet, then minimally fold in the raisins.
Result: held together perfectly, sweet enough, tasted good although no cloves next time.

Really good recipe, I added 1/4 cup more flower and steeped my raisins based on others suggestions. I do think it was a tad bit too salty. With baking soda and salt I woud use a bit less next time.

Followed recipe exactly.  The cookies were delicious and I would definitely make them again.  
Note:  when I previously posted this review, I failed to add that baking on a non-greased cookie sheet didn't work! Luckily the  one batch I tried  according to those instructions came off the baking sheet intact, but I had to use a metal spatula and work to get them off.  For the remaining batches, I used a baking mat which worked perfectly.

This recipe is great. As I’ve grown more comfortable with it I’ve modified it a bit and my most recent modifications won a little baking contest. I’ve posted below if you’re interested...

- Double the called-for cinnamon, so 1.5 tsp
- Add 50% more vanilla, so 1.5 tsp
- Use “Golden” raisins instead of traditional, 1 full cup
- Add craisins, 1/4 cup
- Chill overnight

I don’t know why, but chilling the dough and scooping it out with an ice cream scoop while still chilled REALLY impacts this. The cookies turnout AMAZING.

Had to add 1/4 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder to the mix. Used parchment paper on a dark cookie tin - 350 degrees for 10 min and they turned out way better!

My daughter and I made these, we forgot to soften the butter, added more raisins, and only had instant oats, but they turned out great. I feel like oatmeal cookies are pretty foolproof, so you can add other things like cranberries and chocolate and still have something delicious.

My husband, who normally hates these types of cookies, asks me for these on the regular.  The only thing that I changed was to double the cinnamon and add 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. I also added 1/4 cup extra flour to keep them from flattening it too much. Having all your ingredients at room temperature seems to help, too.

I made these cookies and for the most part, they taste very nice.  they are easy to make and bake well.  They don't really come out as "cookies"; they are more of a bar.  They do not taste sweet enough; more sugar is needed.  They are pretty good but not the best that I have tried.  TIP: cook for less time than says because they burn easily on the bottoms

Added a little more cinnamon! Put in refrigerator for a bit so they didn’t flatten out while baking (just a personal preference). Turned out great!

The cookies are soft with crispy edges. They are delicious! Some teens will be here to work on my yard and I'm sure they will love the, too.
I made mine extra large, about 1.5 inch scoop so I baked them for 20 minutes.

My favorite oatmeal cookie recipe!

I always soak my raisins in hot water to make them plump and juicy.  Other than that, I followed this recipe exactly and I can't keep out of these cookies!

Ok, I read alot of reviews on this recipe.  I used all ingredients exactly as written.  To those who gave 1 star, there are issues in your kitchen. These did not spread out flat or stick to the pans.  Slightly crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. They taste great!  And I did come out with 48 cookies.

These cookies were so soft and chewy. I substituted the eggs with apple sauce. The butter with a dairy free butter. And the flour I used a wheat free flour blend.

Wonderful! We make these all the time and everyone eats them so fast! 10/10 would recommend. I sometimes put cranberries and white chocolate instead of raisins.

Delicious.  After reading reviews , I thought soaking the raisins sounded like a great idea.  Then I thought,  maybe I could substitute dried cranberries.  Guess what?  Cranberries taste great after soaking in........... Bourbon!    I added a few chopped pecans and this is now part of my  holiday baking  extravaganza.

Taste great but spread incredibly thin. Next time I will add more flour and maybe chill the dough.

These cookies were just ok  hence the 3 stars . I didn’t read the reviews before making them and I wish I had ,  these cookies spread way to much,  as good as they were thin and crisp I was craving a thick  oatmeal and raisin cookie. I will makes them again but wut use the pointers in the reviews xtra flour and baking powder... .

First, I hate raisins, so wouldn’t use the anyway. Second, I never use butter in cookie recipes, so I wouldn’t have used that either.  I used chopped dates and butter flavor Crisco.  I made no other modifications at all. These cookies turned out wonderful. I use a small ice cream scoop instead of spoon dropping them onto the baking sheet and I slightly flattened them with a fork.  8 minutes and they were prefect. Thank you for the recipe, I plan to make these again soon.

They tasted great... the ones that survived did.  The recipe makes them delicious but does NOT work very well. I put in all the right ingredients, and the right amounts, however, it did not work out. The dough for me made about 30 cookies, only 12 were salvageable. They all stuck to the pan, and would come off in a hundred pieces. To remove them, I had to push very hard with a spatula to get them off. I now have calices on my hand due to how much I had to push. Good taste, bad for baking.

I would make this again, but I would add an additional cup of flour. The cookies turned out too flat and not really thick. 

The flavoring with the cinnamon and brown sugar, however, made it taste very well. I actually added in an extra quarter teaspoon of cinnamon for taste.

Perfect! Just what I had in mind. Slightly chewy, slightly crunchy. I didn't have brown sugar so I used white with a 1/2t amount of molasses.

I decreased cinnamon to 1/2 tsp and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I'm a nutmeg fan so that made sense for me.  We like raisins so I increased those  by 1/4 cup.  I read the comments about the cookies not being chewy so I refrigerated the dough for 2 hours before baking.  The cookies turned out moist and chewy.

I love this recipe...simple and quick. Use small cookie scoop. Cream butter and sugar till light and fluffy, then add flour, oats and raisins. gives the cookies a great ‘spread’ when baking.

They turned out amazing, I’ve always liked oatmeal raisin cookies and turns out my whole family does to. It’s only been 2 days and we’re down to one cookie. Definitely a keeper.
                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   Edit: just remembered I used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1/4 cup or self rising flour along with half of the baking soda required which may help people who've had issues with the cookies being too thin

I use gluten free flour, omit the white sugar and use the 3/4 cup brown sugar only, and add more raisins.  They are amazing.  Everyone always asks me for the recipe.

Definitely keep an eye on them - they cook quickly, even at 350. I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup (as other bakers recommended). They turned out great!

This Is An awesome recipe. But, as other reviewers have already said, I'd certainly add A quarter Cup more flour a half a teaspoon more baking soda. This recipe can also be done in a convection oven, temperature 350 And 8 to 9 minutes. Before making this recipe, Just check out the other reviews For more information regarding the flower, Because by me It was a little runny after baking for 8 minutes.

These cookies came out WONDERFUL just as the recipe is. I added nothing, nor did I take away anything. For those ppl which had problems with the cookies sticking to the pan... use parchment paper n let them sit for a minute or two on the pan b4 you transfer them to a cooling rack to cool completely. They came out great!

This recipe made delicious cookies with a couple of tweaks. I’m giving it 4 stars since I don’t think it would be as good without my changes to the recipe. I don’t like oatmeal raisin cookies but these turned out amazing! I took the recommendation of another reviewer and mixed the dry ingredients into the wet by hand, which gave me a nice fluffy cookie. I used my mixer when creaming the butter and mixing the rest of the wet ingredients though. 

Other changes:
1) increased cinnamon to 1 tsp
2) freshly ground the spices (added 1/2 tsp or less of nutmeg, clove, and a little allspice) in my mortar and pestle, then poured it through a sieve to make sure only finely ground pieces made it in
3) soaked the raisins in hot water for an hour
4) chilled the dough for an hour
5) decreased sugar to 1/2 c of brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar.

Making sure the butter is cold when the cookies go into the oven is the best way to avoid flat, crispy cookies. That’s why I chilled the dough, along with the fact that’s the flavors mesh well together.

To dry, I think I mixed them wrong. Everyone said theirs spread a lot, mine didn’t spread at all. I think I needed more butter. I probably won’t use this recipe again.

I gave this three stars as I made the dough exactly as the recipe stated (except I accidentally added almost double the cinnamon but that turned out in my favour) and followed baking directions (didn’t leave them alone but put them in for the minimum time specified) and they ended up burnt. Then I started playing around with the dough and oven temperature. I added an extra 1/4cup of flour as I found they were spreading too much, reduced the temperature to 345 and tried again... still too flat and burnt. So I stuck the dough in the fridge overnight, scooped some out and baked at 300 for 8 mins and they came out perfect. I let them cool on the sheet to set up a bit but they are delicious. I really recommend nd reading the reviews and using a timer to help you keep track. If you take them out when the edges are just cooked (tiny bit golden) they will be perfect

I will definitely be making this recipe again!! However, I did make a few adjustments. I added 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar to help the baking soda fluff up the cookies a bit. I also used flax “eggs” instead of chicken eggs and vegan “butter” instead of regular butter (I’m vegan). I ended up baking the cookies for 11 minutes instead of 8-10. With the adjustments I made, these cookies turned out perfectly chewy and delicious! They remind me a lot of the oatmeal raisin cookies sold at Subway sandwich shops (which used to be my favorite)!

Made this recipe with some changes. I used 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c plain Greek yorgurt and 1/4c of vanilla protein powder. I also added flax and chia seeds with the oatmeal. These changes have made these cookies something that the kids can grab in the morning or for an afternoon snack and I feel good that they are getting a fairly healthy bite.

Great recipe!  A few tweaks:
-Add 1 1/2 Tbs cooking molasses to wet ingredients 
-add 1/2 tsp allspice 
-add 1/4 tsp cloves 
-substitute 1 1/2c Craisins (dried cranberries) for the raisins 
Note: I didn’t have rolled oats so used quick oats instead and the first batch started sticking to the pan so I used parchment paper for the rest
The cookies turned out kind of dark but were delicious, my family loved them!!

Chewy and delicious! We use quick oats (not instant, just the cut rolled oats!) so they're smoother and canola oil instead of butter. Come out great and don't stick to the ungreased glass pan.

4* for having to modify the recipe , but the flavor is definitely a 5* . I did 2 diff batches - I added 2 cups of flour & baked as directed , they were very flat (  but still chewy ) the second batch I decided to chill the dough for a 1/2 hr ( still used 2 cups of flour ) that second batch turned out a bit better & definitely more eye appealing . Sometimes you have to chill cookie dough that calls for a lot of butter ( or crisco )  before hand or they spread into nothing . This worked for this recipe as well . They are delicious!

Per other reviews, I half the white and brown sugar, plump pup the raisins in hot water, and dropped baking temperature to 350F. Other than that , following everything else (even though I also throw in 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of almond slivers).  Came out perfect after 9 minutes

Very good cookies!  I didn't have enough butter so I used 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c coconut oil.  Since some of the reviews said these were flat, so I added 1/2 tsp baking powder.  We are gluten free so I subbed 1:1 GF flour too.

I made this recipe exactly as written excet, I added roasted pecans and chilled the dough overnight. I dropped with scoop and had to cook 12 minutes in my oven.  They turned out really tasty. I you chill the dough, they won't spread.

Delicious!! Cut sugars to 1/2 cup each and it was plenty. Used 1 1/2 cup white flour and added 1/4 tsp. baking powder. Dough was sticky so I refrigerated it for 10 minutes. Next time will make smaller scoops.

I also increased flour and baking soda as others have recommended. Also refridgerated dough for 2 hours. Used parchment paper and had no  problems with cookies sticking  or spreading too thin. Baked at 350 for approximately 8 1/2 minutes and came out perfect. Recommend this recipe for a moist, chewy, and  delishhhhh cookie!! Thanks for sharing Darlene

Love this recipe! I did cut the sugars to 1/2 cup each, added a 1/2 tsp. More cinnamon, and used 1 heaping tsp. of soda.  I baked at 350, for 9 minutes, and greased my cookie sheet.  The cookies were chewy, and plump! Will make these again!

I made it exactly as presented in the recipe and it turned out as promised.  Chewy, moist and delicious.  I used large rolled oats (not quick oats) and whole wheat flour  ... maybe that makes a difference.

Yup, these were very good. Only thing i did differently is to add 3/4 cup more flour as batter was still wet, and used my hand to mix after adding the raisins and oats.

Very good with extra cup of oats, a few shakes of cinnamon, whole wheat flour for the AP flour, and dried blueberries and pecans for the raisins. I also baked on convection 10 min. Original batch (without extra oats) really spread—I do think this probably has too much sugar without the extra oats, as another reviewer said. Will try it with less next time.

Original recipe had too much butter and not enough flour. The cook time for me was 15 min. I reduced butter by 6 tablespoons. After the first batch at 10 min was still raw in the middle and merged into a flat pancake on the cookie sheet, I added more flour until the consistency was like normal cookie dough.  After that, the cookies were amazing. A huge hit!!

Per the reviews, I simply reduced the butter to one stick (half a cup) and they baked beautifully and didn’t go flat. And I even live at 6,500 ft above sea level.

This is the perfect Oatmeal raisin cookie. I used 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c coconut oil.  Only because I ran out of butter. It made the flavor absolutely delicious!

I followed every part of this recipe except for the baking part. I set the temperature to 350 F and baked then for 17 minutes. They were absolutely delicious!!

I love love love these cookies! The only thing I did different was add mini chocolate chips to the recipe. They would have tasted great without chocolate.   This is an easy and quick recipe. Thanks!

Everyone loved them! The second time I made them I only had 3/4 c white sugar available and 1/2 c raisins . I just added more nuts. All I has was walnuts. Still a great cookie! I didn't even notice the 1/4 c less sugar. Didn't have any chocolate chips either. Definitely a good base to clean out your holiday pantry leftovers.

I was looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe that would give me chewier cookies. This was the first one I looked at and it was a surefire winner. Kept the raisins out, and they still turned out great.

Made these exact to the recipe,  I made the cookies larger, as we all like big cookies.  Got 18 4" cookies and they were wonderful.  My wife loves Oatmeal Raisin cookies, but can't cook.  Being a chef I have no fear even if I fail.  First time making these, and wifey is extatic so I must have done well,. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I really liked these cookies. I didn't have enough rolled oats but had apple cinnamon instant oatmeal and added enough packets to make the full amount. I also added about 1/4 tsp. cloves and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. The hint of apple in these cookies made them the best I believe I have ever had for homemade.

These are wonderful! Best oatmeal cookies I've ever made! Not ever going back to my old recipe.  
I added 1/4 cup more flour, as was suggested by others in the comments. Also, if you only use teaspoonfuls of dough, your cookies will be really small. I used heaping tablespoons of dough and had a nice sized cookie.
For a variation, omit cinnamon and raisins. Add 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon peanut butter. Yummy!

I made this true to the recipe but had to make slight (very slight) tweaks just before baking, for obvious reasons, or there's no way I'd have kept these. The batter is too wet and thin with the recipe as is, that you're going to have to put more flour, oats, & soda. It'll also be painfully sweet, especially with the thinness of the dough, so cut the sugars — I used less brown and a little less granulated, but it's still quite obviously sweet. It is okay considering my slight fixes, but it'd definitely be at a 1 star-rating otherwise.

Love this recipe. I've used it dozens of times. Only difference is I add 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and double the amount of raisins. And I soak the raisins for about 30 minutes in hot water before adding them to the batter.

Just finished baking this wonderful recipe! It’s the best, and I will definetly use it again. It has the perfect flavor. When you smell the batter, it smells like heaven! We ate up almost half of it as shown on the photo. It’s also quite light, so not a very heavy desert but a yummy snack! It reminds me of my mother’s cookies. Thank you and keep up the good work!

Great recipe as written!  The neighbors say they're the best cookies they ever had!  
Personal preferences: increase raisins and one cup chopped walnuts. 

My ex always swore I added chocolate chips- that he watched me do it.  I never added chocolate - I guess he can't tell a raisin from a chocolate chip!  He "loved the chocolate chips in them."

These may be the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever made! I followed other commenters and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour,  1 teaspoon of cinnamon (instead of 3/4 tsp), 1/4 teaspoon of ground clove, 1/2 tsp baking powder, and soaked the raisins in warm water. I turned the heat down to 350. Wow! So delicious!

These came out great. A little crispy on the edges but soft and chewy in the middle. I followed a few recommendations from other reviewers: 1. I soaked the raisins in hot water and 2. I added about 14 cup extra flour and 3. I added about 1/2 tsp extra cinammon.

Great cookie, my grandson wanted an oatmeal raisen cookie and this one seemed quick and easy and it was. I cut the white sugar to 1/4 Cup and brown sugar to 1/2 Cup because the raisins add sweetness. I also added chocolate chips. I baked the cookies on parchment paper. Grandson loves them and so do I. I will add these to my Christmas cookie trays.

No changes made to the recipe. I made it twice both times the cookies were flat and ran into each other. Used ALL new ingredients purchased that day. Very disappointing; guess I will  go to the store tomorrow and purchase cookies for our  holiday get together.

Made these for my boyfriend and his friend and this recipe did NOT disappoint! They were amazing! My first time ever making oatmeal cookies and they turned out fantastic. I also changed the recipe by substituting the raisins for chocolate chips for half a batch, and the results were still perfection!

I made it, and love it. I added baking cranapple flavored cranberries and pecans, and mixed in nutmeg with the cinnamon, and added a little extra imitation vanilla...it tastes like apple oatmeal. Its delicious...not one cookie stuck to the pan and I didn't use any type of sprays; I just let the cookies cool for about 5 minutes before removing them. Not extremely soft and not hard, but just right.

I agree with many who said that these cookies turn out runny. They certainly are delicious though. To combat that issue I actually put them in a pan and made bars instead. Definitely one of my favorite cookie bar recipes. Try them with cranberries instead of raisins and einkorn flour instead of regular flour.

What an amazing recipe! I followed it and then baked a batch and they were terrible flat crisp discs... so I chilled the dough... still not right. On other attempts I added two tablespoons of flour and a smidge more of baking soda, I changed the pan I was using (even though the pan I had has baked perfect cookies before) and I turned the oven down to 300 and baked them longer. Finally some edible cookies! It’s f*@#ing amazing I had to do all this for some edible cookies... Trust me, if the comments all look like this (“I had to...”) just use a different recipe.

Wonderfully classic! So yummy! So easy! Great wrapped up as a gift. I made them for my Dad and my husband requested a batch when he snatched one... I used 1/2C whole wheat flour and 3/4 C white flour ... And lucked into filling 3 half sheet trays with 10 PERFECT cookies each. Made 3 more times. Loved them each time.

Great base to make any changes you like.  I used cherries instead of raisins and added chocolate chips.  I soaked the dried cherries in boiling water then drained before adding.  After the first batch I added about 1/4 cup flour.  I think the cherries added a little too much moisture to the cookies.  I cooked 9 minutes in my convection oven.  Crunchy edges and chewy centers.  Perfect!

Changes - added 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2 tsp. baking powder; also cut white and brown sugar to 1/2 cup each.  Did not add any extra spices besides the cinnamon the recipe called for. Cookies came out fluffy (soft inside and crispy on edges) and had no issues with running.  Baked at 375 for 11 minutes - till bottom and edges were lightly brown.

The flavor was good but the cookies spread way too much. I first thought it was because I was making them jumbo sized and they burned on the edges and spread out.  I made them smaller according to the recipe and still spread too much . Watched them like a hawk.

Very tasty and hold together well. I added white chocolate chips and walnuts to half the batter for special Christmas cookies; don't really need any additions, though; great just following recipe.

Really good cookies! Maybe a little too much butter, as they spread more than I like. Great flavor though. I live at sea level and found that 12 minutes cook time worked best.

Perfect oatmeal cookies. I did mix it up a little by using craisins, dried blueberries and raisins. Turned out great! 
Thanks for the recipe!

We did not care for these cookies at all. I consider myself a fairly seasoned baker. My friends and family get so excited when they find out I'm baking something. I followed this recipe to a "T" and the cookies came out as flat, chewy discs. It's like the batter disentigrated and the oats are being held together with a rubbery glue. According to notes I found after the fact made by other bakers, adding more flower and baking powder help keep this from happening. This has been a complete waste of time. You're better off using the recipe from the Quaker Oats container.

Made these twice, they're great. They can seem a little gooey when they're done, but they're likely done. Just let them cool and they'll firm up a little. Great, chewy cookie.

Went for diabetic. Used sugar substitutes, and 1/4 cup applesauce for 1/4 cup butter. Added 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon cardomon, 1/2 teaspoon allspice, & increased raisins to 1 1/2 cups, after plumping them. Also added 1/4 cup flax & 1 tablespoon of chia seeds. Refrigerated dough for 1 hour. After 8  minuets of baking turned cookies over & cooked for 2 more minutes. Excellent chewy cookies not too sweet. Healthy for a breakfast on the run.

These are the strangest looking cookies I’ve ever made- but yummy! I added the baking powder, as suggested in other reviews, but opted not to add extra flour, fearing they’d turn out dry. So, they’re flat. And the edges got quite brown, while the middles looked white as I took them out of the oven at 7 minutes. As they cooled, the color evened out some. I put the bowl of dough in the freezer for the last batch, and they turned out a bit puffier. DEFINITELY NEED TO ADD MORE FLOUR!

I have always made the oatmeal cookies on the side of the Quaker oats box..I think I will stick to it. I didn't like the cinnamon with raisins and I have always put tons of pecans in the cookies and extra raisins.  If you also worry about sticking...Try a baking stone! Makes the cookies soooo good.  This recipe needs tweaking in a big way...

My family absolutely loves these. I have made these as is, and subbed dried cranberries for the raisins, and added 1/2 c. Chopped walnuts. They were fantastic both times.

Um not why anyone would give these 1 star. These are the best cookies. Secret to best tasting is eating them the next day. They are just ok when fresh off out of the oven. Thank u for sharing this recipe I make them all the time.

This recipe looks good, but for me as with so many others it came out flat, runny, burnt. After adding a total of 1 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and reducing oven to 350 I got 3 edible batches out of 5. Others said they added flour, reduced oven temp, refrigerated dough, made balls instead of spoonfuls, and hand mixed. At what point does it become a different recipe?  It's misleading to make sometimes a significant change such as 25 degrees less oven temp then give a recipe (any recipe) a high rating. I would love it if somehow there could be a category of "no changes made" with a rating for that.  I have to also mention that I made these cookies only once, it shows twice because of a glitch on my tablet.

I looked at some reviews and made a few changes, which I do not always do. Added 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 c flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder.  I did cut back a little on both sugars -probably put in 2/3 c of each and regretted doing that. I also soaked my raisins in hot water and let them dry off a little before stirring in. Used 1/2 old fashioned oats and 1/2 quick oats because it was all I had.  Baked 9 min per tray. Turned out great except that next time I'd add the full amt of sugar.

Followed the recipe exactly and ran all over my baking sheet. Added about 1/4 cup of flour and got a little better but they just didn’t do it for me. My husband loves oatmeal raisin cookies but I’m actually not even going to show these to him. To embarrassed. Will be looking for a better recipe to try

I made these after reading through the reviews, and did make a few changes.  I added 1/2 cup flour, before refrigerating for 30 minutes.  I switched up the butter to 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup of shortening.  I also added 1 Tablespoon of molasses.  I used a size 30 scoop.  They turned out great!  Oatmeal Raisin cookies are my husband's favorite - and he loved these.  .

I decided to make these following and after reading many reviews, I lowered the heat to 325 degrees and put them in 6 minutes originally and then stood by the stove for another 2 minutes and another 1 minute. After this,  the edges and bottom were brown. I took them out and let them sit. Because I used my kitchen aid blender, others were right about the mixture being soupy. I let them sit for 15 mins and  came out thin but tasted great. I had half of the batch left in the bowl so I added a 1/4 cup of flour and a 1/2 teaspoon of baking Soda. I used a melon baller this time to put them on a cookie sheet for 6 minutes and another 3 minutes at 1 minute intervals. These ones were smaller and the texture was perfect! I recommend as someone else said adding a 1/4 cup of extra flour if you want a more solid cookie texture but still taste great but if you mix them and they come out thin. ITs a personal preference imo. I made them for my boyfriend for a hunting trip for him and his friends. He loved them!

I am not an oatmeal raisin cookie expert, I am making as a surprise for a friend. I did taste one and have to say it was pretty tasty! This recipe calls for cinnamon, you can definitely taste it, not sure if it is normally in this cookie. Definitely worth making.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies were delicious!

Be sure to use real butter and not margarine.  Also, you need to soften the butter and not melt it. I also let the batter sit out for about 10 minutes before scooping spoonfuls and putting them in the oven. 

They taste much better the next day.

I made these oatmeal raisin cookies tonight. An absolute disaster, they turned out extremely flat as if there was too much butter. They still taste good however this recipe definitely needs to be altered as they turn out so flat and thin. Will never make again.

WARNING! Not 5 stars! So runny. Even took advice from others and added extra flour and baking powder... still so runny. I’m very disappointed. I agree with the one lady who said this recipe received 5 stars only because most people tweaked it to their liking, then rated that 5 stars. People, that’s not how you rate a recipe post.

I substituted 1/2 cup of cranberries and 1/2 cup of raisins. While mixing I also put in a few more handfuls of raisins. Follow the cooling off time on the cookie sheet before moving to wire rack.

Very good and easy recipe.

This is a very good recipe, but I can’t seem to get them quite perfect. I’ve made these 3 times and each time they’ve been not quite... I don’t know, they’re missing something. I did make a few changes though. They were good, but... anyway. Good luck with these!

RAW on the inside. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with rock hard cookies that were 100% raw on the inside. I even tried baking the second batch  an extra 8 minutes.  STILL RAW. Also, they had an overpowering baking soda taste.

Good recipe but instead of making mini cookies I made large ones and baked for about 12 minutes. They were much nicer and were chewy.

Followed directions as written. They baked well, but the flavor came out a little bland. Deemed good enough to try again with tweaking to achieve personal taste perfection.

Just the way I like them! Not too spicy and perfectly moist. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because I made slight changes suggested by another reviewer. 
I added 1/4 cup extra flour and 1/2 tsp extra baking soda to keep them from running. I also soaked the raisins in hot tap water while mixing the batter. The suggestion to pour them into a colander and place them on a saucepan worked perfectly. Because my oven tends to burn cookies on the bottom, I raised the oven rack up one slot and baked them for 10 min. Very yummy!

These were a hit with my family. The only thing that I changed about them was the cooking time. 8 to 10 minutes was not long enough. I had to leave them in for 14 minutes and even then they were still kind of soggy. So, cook them longer then the recipe says!

These cookies were amazing! So moist, and oh so delicious. I made plenty of changes instead of 3/4 cups of the suagrs, I did 2/4. Added 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp ground allspice, and uped the cinnamon to 1/2 a teaspoon. And also, like many others, I soaked my raisins in hot water beforehand. Hope this helps!

Add half a cup of flour if you want anything other than a sticky, chewy mess that spreads. Tried it according to the recipe and they were thin and borderline inedible. I felt like a bad person for making them for someone. Added flour, reduced the cook temp to 350, baked until golden brown, and they were way better.

I made these using only 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and kept everything the same. Baked at 170 degrees C for about 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. They came out sweet enough for my liking (I do have a high tolerance for sugar and think the original amount of sugar would have been too sweet). I did not have any issues with the cookies being runny, instead they kept their shape and only rise and spread a little. The cookies came out crunchy instead of chewy but they are still a keeper. I live in NZ so I think the ingredients here may slightly be different to what I would get in the States.

This recipe is very good. I inadvertently misread the amount of flour and added an extra 1/2 cup. This did not by any means meant trouble. I however did consider the suggestions of adding 1/2 cup of each of the sugars and probably add a bit of another spice. For me it was a bit of nutmeg. My cookies came about as I expected them: round, chewy, sweet enough, and flavorful. By the time they cool completely they came out a bit crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Will make it again and will definitely be my go to/base recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies. BTW, I did not soak the raisins in water and it was good.

I love these. I did have to turn the oven down to 350 and I added about 1/4  cup of flour more. Also I'm chilling the dough and see if that helps the spreading. So delicious. This is by far my favorite cookie.

We regularly use this recipe to make home made ice cream sandwiches. I scoop and bake the cookies, and then I freeze them. I melt ice cream slightly, then I lay it in a cookie sheet to refreeze. Once both the cookies and the ice cream is ready, I cut the ice cream and assemble. I then bag up each sandwich individually, and refreeze. Delicious!

The recipe was good and easy but a little sweet for our taste, made as written. Will make again with less sugar and walnuts.

I read the other review and only used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar and used 1 t cinnamon. It was great. I also used parchment paper so I had no problem with sticking.  In measuring the flour I was generous with my measurement because of some of the other peoples complaints, and because I had cut back on my other dry ingredient, the sugar.  There was no reason to do this as they turned out perfect, it was obvious that they would never came close to melting as some complained about.  I will use this recipe again.  They were great. If you love super sweet cookies follow the recipe as is and you will do fine.  I do like the extra cinnamon though.

This is now a go to staple in our house. My husband LOVES these and he doesn't have a sweet tooth! My eldest daughter doesn't like raisins either but LOVES these cookies. They say it tastes like oatmeal on the go! Yum!

I made them per the instructions, with only adding additional cinnamon (because I love it!).  The cookies tasted wonderful, but appeared a bit flat.  I don't care though - because they were very good.  :)

I have to agree with the reviewer that talked about the 5 star reviews on a recipe that’s not on this page.  My cookies didn’t run at all - in fact, the dough was very dry.  I like nice chewy oatmeal raisin & this recipe (unaltered) does not deliver that result.  The flavor is good so it gets two stars for that.  Won’t be making this one again

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (using my stand mixer from start to finish. I dropped them by tablespoons and baked for 16 minutes. The right amount of crisp with the perfect amount of chew. My husband loved them!

Best Oatmeal Raisin cookies I ever made!  I added ground cloves and some nutmeg to the cinnamon, and creamed the sugar and butter by hand, then added the dry ingredients slowly.  I baked them at about 360 for 10 mins. because my oven is unpredictable.  They came out crunchy around the edges and soft in the middle!  They’re going fast!

First batch was exactly as written. They were pretty good in my opinion, a classic oatmeal raisin cookie. The second batch I added more cinnamon, cloves, and allspice and mixed in some craisins. Mmmm, sooooo much better! A little sweet though so next time I'll cut some sugar out. 

I did notice they stick to the pans, even with a ton of cooking spray. I let them cool before removing though, and used a thin spatula. Worked great! I also used room temp butter, I'm not sure if that helped mine stay cookie shaped or not. 

Overall, I'll probably make again.

Have made this recipe a million times and they come out perfect every time! Honestly not sure how these cookies could come out runny or flat.... use proper amount of REAL butter and don’t overnight mix...you don’t need your electric mixer, just use a wooden spoon ans a little arm work. Also..if you are soaking your raisins, obviously the added water is going to cause issues...even if you drain, the moisture comes out while baking. If you have to soak the raisins (never soaked them for cookies) you obviously need more flour.

These cookies where great and did not last at all. The best advice I can give anyone having a hard time with this would be to not use an electric mixer on the badder. You over mix this kind of cookie and it goes flat. The butter and stuff? Mix it with an electric mixer (You can make the butter sugar eggs fluffy with a mixing spoon or anything really, but that will take a long time. I did it that way just to see if I could and it worked even though it's a bit of a workout), just when you add the flour into the butter use a mixing spoon and fold in the raisins or just don't mix them too much. 

One last thing that needs mentioning, don't use the microwave to soften the butter because that also makes flat cookies. If the butter is too cold and you want to jump right into making these cookies (Any cookie) cut the butter up into small pieces and mix them that way until the small chunks of butter are soft enough to blend together and then add the rest of the ingredient as the recipe says, however, that part needs to be done by hand because cold butter is not soft and will stick to an electric mixer.

Butter that is too cold is one of the main causes of ruined cookies, next to over mixing the badder. 

If they don't turn out the way you would have imagined they should try again. Making messed up cookies does not mean you're bad at making cookies, it just means you need to keep practicing. Trial and error, that's how we all learn.

These turned our great for me, but I made a few changes. I used one teaspoon of cinnamon, substituted 1/4 cup of butter with vegetable shortening and dissolved the baking soda in a teaspoon of cold water first. I think they were better than way too.

I have never made cookies before, so this was an experiment.  I chose this recipe because it looked simple enough.  I did read all the reviews but the only change I made in the recipe was to cut it in half because I didn't know how it would turn out.  With the first batch, at about 4 minutes of baking I was concerned because they weren't spreading, so I took the pan out of the oven and gently pushed down on each cookie with a fork.  I did the same with the second batch.  They turned out fine.  Perhaps I didn't use enough sugar because they certainly aren't  very sweet, but that's okay too.  I like this recipe and I'm going to experiment with other cookie recipes now.

I was actually surprised on how well it worked after such mixed reviews. I followed the recipe pretty closely (with the exception of adding another 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg). They came out soft and chewy. Some tips to get them to come out this way without adjusting the recipe is to soak the raisins in warm water while you're preparing the batter (drain them before use), and to stir the batter by hand to get the right consistency. If you're getting all 48 cookies like I did, they need to be pretty small, but they bake up to a decent size. Mine baked at 350 for about 7-9 minutes, depending on the batch.

Instead of flour, I used baking soda, instead of baking soda, I used vinegar. I didn't have any oats so I used premium smoked  oysters. I thought the butter was waaaaaaay too unhealthy so I added some spinach. Instead of unhealthy sugar I used stevia and honey in a 1/2 and 1/2 ratio. This was so delicious! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Delicious cookies, I couldn't bake them fast enough and before long they were gone, I made a batch and used chocolate chips in place of the raisins and they were just as delicious. I'm a novice baker and my family loved the cookies, I'll probably use this recipe again, maybe mix it up and use butterscotch chips in place of raisins or chocolate chips sometime.

I baked for 8 min and was afraid I had taken them out too soon, but after they cooled, they were perfect! Soft & chewy. My family loved them!

The flavor of these is really good but I broke my own rule and didn't read the reviews first and wish I had.  They spread fairly flat (though remained chewy).  Next time I would try less sugar and maybe sub shortening for some of the butter and/or add more flour.  They did stick a bit to my stoneware trays - next time I would use parchment.

I didn't change anything and they were just blah. I would have given more stars if they didn't taste so much like flour. They're also a little too sweet and a little bland, if that's possible.

Great recipe.  I did adjustments based on reviews. Added 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, tossed raisins in 1/2 c boiled water and drained. Instead of 2 eggs, I used 1 egg and 2 3.2 oz packets of applesauce because of my son's egg allergy (the ratio is 1 egg per 1 c flour).  Came out delicious! Kids loved them!

These turned out very good. My boyfriend's favorite kind of cookie and he loved them. Very thankful for the comments and people saying what worked and what didn't work because the actual recipe was a little runny for my liking. But all around a great cookie and will make them again.

This is the perfect oatmeal raisin cookie recipe. I've made them much more than the 4 times I marked on here. The only time they "spread out" on the baking sheet was the very first I made them. I had used non-stick cooking spray and those first 9 cookies thinned and stuck to the pan. Those 9 cookies, however, tasted great. They just weren't as pretty. 

When I made them the second time I added dried cranberries and pecans along with the raisins.  My boyfriend loved them, I loved them and my coworkers loved them. 

This recipe has been added to my tried and true favorites list. That may not seem significant, but that list includes my mother's blondies (secret family recipe,) her sugar cookies, her peanut butter cookies, and my almost famous banana nut bread. 

Most definitely a must-have

Cookies are just fine the way they are.
I even used my blender to add the flour, oatmeal and
raisins. They Never ran or broke apart.
I did let them rest for a few minutes on the pan
before transferring to cooling rack to cool longer.
(as most all cookies or baked items should rest before moving)
My Family Loved them.

Really nice and so easy to make. Didn't spread much so not too flat. Soft on the inside crispy in the outside. My eggs were small so maybe that's why they stayed put. I used self -raising instead of baking soda. All worked really well.

Best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had!!! Followed the recipe exactly. They smelled like heaven while cooking, and to be honest, my daughter and I weren't able to wait for them to cool before we snagged one from the cookie sheet. It was worth every burned taste bud!!!
***note*** we used parchment paper on the cookie sheet and baked ours at 375 for 12 minutes (apparently my oven runs on the cool side)

I almost made these exactly as the recipe says. I added the dry ingredients and then stirred by hand so I didn’t over mix the batter and I rolled the dough into balls. Make sure to take the cookies out on time. They will get a little darker when cooling on the pan. They are delicious.

These didn't last around our house! Oatmeal raisin cookies are my husband's favorite and probably my least favorite, but even I liked these. I accidentally went a little heavy-handed when measuring the salt, but that little bit extra made all the difference! Of course, I really enjoy salty/sweet treats. Anyway, this will be our go-to recipe now. Hubby raved about them, kids liked them, and I did too!

Soaked Golden raisins in bourbon. I stirred the flour mixture, oats and raisins in by hand. Refrigerated about 15 minutes and baked at 350. Perfect! Be sure to use old fashioned oats and not the quick cooking kind.

I bake all the time. Normally I will ise the quaker oats recipe when making oatmeal raisin cookies. However, it wasn't handy so I figured why not just use my all recipes app (which I LOVE) How different can they BE, right? Wrong! These arw by FAR the WORST cookie I have ever made! They were FLAT, dark and SO STICKY, THEU DONT HOLD TOGETHER when trying to remove from cookie sheet!!! At first I used foil

I made it with dark brown sugar instead as that is what I had on hand and with 1/2 raisins and 1/2 craisins.  It turned out very nice.   Both batches of 36 I made this week  are all gone.  :)  They were flat-ish but tasted just fine.

Just not as good as some recipes I've tried. I had the exact opposite thing happen to most people in that they didn't spread out? I did two things different then original recipe. 
1. I used brown sugar Stevia instead of brown sugar
2. I didn't have enough all purpose flour left, so half was bread flour. Maybe that is what made the difference.

You really need to change the flour to 1 3/4 a cup to 2 cups, the cookies are soooo runny if you don't add that extra flour. The first time I made them they wouldn't even stay together and I could barely get them off of the pan with out them falling to pieces!

first time making cookies and it was fun, easy, and very tasty (had to stop eating the batter).  I did adjust somewhat for portion size, but the ratio of sugar to cinnamon is spot on.

This was my very first oatmeal raisin cookie recipe from online, I enjoyed the cookies(as well as my entire family)so much I had to sign up and give them a review. I let my butter get room temperature and my eggs slightly above room temperature. Soft, chewy, and fluffy! I added a smidge more raisins. These were absolutely addicting delicious! I made a few dozen and they were gone in a matter of hours. I made larger cookies so I added a bit of time. I just can't believe how good these were they're definitely going on my routine cookie bake list thank you so very much for a great recipe!

I guess I thought that a recipe with so many good ratings did not need to be adjusted to make it right. My bad. I made these to surprise my coworkers on a big day. I’m leaving them at home.

Excellent recipe.  Almost like the one on the oatmeal box.  I did use 1 packed cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of reg sugar.  I used 3 cups of oatmeal and added an extra egg, so 3 eggs.  Used 1 tbsp less of butter.  I added 1/4 cup more of flour cause of our high altitude here in Denver.
They were so sticky, even with a spoon to put on "parchment paper"., so I rolled them into balls making sure my hands were coated with flour.  
They came out perfecto!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I have a friend who has attempted this recipe several times with unacceptable results, and for me it seems to narrow down to baking soda instead of baking powder. I can't imagine using baking soda in cookies...but maybe someone has had a different experience.

Crispy on the edges, chewy in the middle, thin. Did soak the raisins in some hot water for a few hours first. Use silpats and only 9 per mat, perfect at about 10 minutes in my oven.

I haven’t had the issue with the cookie spreading.  In fact I make these into bars most of the time because it’s easier.  One thing I do though is I allow the raisins to soak in bourbon.  Yum.  I also add freshly grated nutmeg.  It really brings a lot of flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly and was extremely pleased with the results.  Baked on parchment paper for 9 minutes @ 375.  I separated dough and baked 3/4 of them with chocolate chips (son & grandson's choice) and 1/4 of them with raisins.  I didn't even soak the raisins.  I tasted one of each after allowing to cool for an hour.  Personally, I preferred the cookies with the raisins.

This recipe came out great, although I used it mostly as a guideline. At the time, I didn't have regular flour so I instead opted for 100% whole wheat and substituted the brown sugar for Poloncillo: which is a latin very dark brown sugar which comes in a cone. I also couldn't find raisins so I used white chocolate chips and they're a hit. In my oven I opted for 11 minutes and broiled the cookies for an additional minute and a half to add a crisp outside. I hope this helps.

I loved these cookies! I used only 1/2c of brown sugar and 1/2c of white sugar. I added more cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. I put mine in the fridge prior to baking to keep the dough firm. I didnt use the mixer, i think that would over mix it and would lead to runny cookies. With most cookies or brownies i always mix by hand and gently fold in the ingredients. Will definately make this again!

The recipe "as is" is very bland.  I allowed the butter to soften naturally, used the right kind of shiny aluminum baking pan, etc., but they still spread a lot and had no taste.  I think I will use a recipe that calls for more butter and less sugar next time.  These might be okay with the modifications that others called for, but as is, they are pretty bad.

Very good, not too sweet; just sweet enough. Used cranberry and orange zest instead of raisins and cinnamon. Makes small cookies if using teaspoonfuls

Great recipe! Delicious cookies. I would however use less raisins, I find 1 cup is a bit too much.

The people who complained their cookies came out flat, I'm wondering if they might have used instant oats instead of rolled oats. It cooks faster and will make your cookies come out flatter.

These were good, but they spread out too flat and thin. The recipe states drop by teaspoons. I'll admit that I did drop by my usual tblsp. That didn't work here. On one sheet, they spread out and all joined together! I was making these to give away, so I lost two sheets of them. I salvaged the rest by dropping in teaspoons, and it worked better. They're still too thin and flat for me, though.

I never review. But after reading reviews this morning on this recipe I was hesitant to try. 
But I did anyway and I followed the recipe exactly minus the eggs I was out so used a replacer. 
The cookies turned out amazing and my husband who hates sweet things turned to me and said I think you should make these every week. Thank you. Just trust your instincts these cookies rock.

Loved these cookies the only thing i did differently was used a half cup less quick oats  and a half cup more raisins in a double batch.. this recipe will definitely be my go to from now on.

 If your having issues with your cookies spreading thin while cooking try chilling your baking sheets and cookie dough in the fridge. While one tray is in the oven cooking,  have the other chilling...this will stop your cookies from spreading flat

Very tasty cookie, not too runny like some others are saying. Use old fashioned oats, not quick cooking, as they are a firmer texture, and try them with cranberries and pecans. Make sure your butter is cold when mixing and add an extra splash of vanilla for fantastic flavour. I took these to work and they were a huge hit. I'll definitely make these again.

Delicious!  I substituted coconut oil 1:1 for butter, because that's what I had in the house.  Followed the rest exactly.  These are "super delicious", as my 3 year old would say!

I made this as written except I didn't have enough raisins in the house.  Luckily dark chocolate chips go well with raisins!  Now, my next challenge is fighting off the little (and big) cookie thieves sneaking in & out of the kitchen!

I made this recipe for the first time today.  After I had the first batch in the oven I came to read these reviews.  I saw that some people said they spread out too much and some said they came out hard.  I also noticed that it says to drop by a teaspoon on an ungreased cookie sheet.  A teaspoon is pretty small so I would imagine it was meant to say heaping or rounded spoonful.  I had cut down the recipe so I was dealing with amended measurements.   I followed the amended measurements exactly, except for adding 1/2 cup of Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chips to the recipe and although the amended ingredients called for  1 & 1/2 eggs,  I used 2 eggs.  I used an even measure of a size small cookie scoop, lined the cookie sheets with parchment paper and baked at the 375 F temperature as directed for 11 minutes.  The cookies came out lightly browned on the bottom and edges and soft and chewy otherwise.  They are delicious and my husband said they are a favorite of his!  Whatever size spoon you use though, you always have to watch the cookies and judge the baking time by their sight as to when they're done.  Lightly browned on the edges and on the bottoms are done!

I'm no expert on oatmeal raisin cookies, but they seem very sweet to me. This recipe calls for the same amount of sugar I use in chocolate chip cookies. I'm sure the raisins add to the sweetness. I will try this recipe again, but definitely cut down on the sugar.

These cookies are amazing! I am a terrible baker. After four failed attempts at making cookies for my boyfriend, I found this recipe and tried it out. It was so easy to make and they came perfectly. 

As mentioned above, I am no baker, but I think it's really important for the butter to be SOFT and not MELTED. If the dough is on the liquid-y side, the cookies will melt into discs. 

I also follow cooling directions closely. I let these sit on the cookie sheet for about 30 seconds after taking them out of the oven, then move them to a cooling rack. 

Wonderful cookies. A new favorite!

Really good cookies. Made them as instructed but used whole wheat flour and added walnuts and some flax seeds. I also used half salted and half unsalted butter and didn't add any additional salt. Whole family loved  them. They did not spread very much which is great (used shiney cookie sheets)

Awesome base for amazing oatmeal cookies.  I added the extra 1/4 cup of flour. I did not have the baking powder so I didn't add it and it turned out great! I got creative with the ingredients and made an assortment with blueberries, cranberries, raisins, white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and pecans. I did soak all of the dried fruit before baking and it totally makes a difference! 8-10 minutes was spot on!

This is very delicious; for a first time baker like me, I couldn't be more grateful of having this tasty recipe as my first try! It was good!

I followed the advice on some reviews to soak the raisins in a boiling water. It tasted much better.

I have to disagree with a couple points in the most helpful review. I tried their suggestion to reduce sugar and reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. The cookies were not sweet enough. I tried their suggestion to cook at 325 and after 14 minutes my cookies still were not browning on the edges. I turned my oven up to 350 and the remaining batches still took at least 12 minutes. I will leave my oven at 375 next time.
I soaked the raisins in hot water and added 1/4 cup extra flour. I added 1/2 tsp Baking Powder. I used 1 tsp Cinnamon, 1/4 tsp Nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp Allspice. The Allspice adds an interesting new flavor, you will have to decide if you like it or not yourself.

These cookies were awesome. I followed all the instructions directly, except for adding a bit more cinnamon and setting the heat to 350 degrees. If you have a problem with the cookies sticking to the pan then just use wax sheets underneath.

I used to always get frustrated with flat cookies when following the recipe on the Quaker oats lid.  I finally tried again following the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup more flour along with 1 tsp of baking powder in addition to the baking soda the recipe calls for and I added a pinch more cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg along with chopped walnuts and my cookies finally came out perfect! They were delicious and my family couldn't get enough! I'm so relieved after all these years I can finally make my own oatmeal raisin cookies! 5 stars!

This is a great recipe.  Our child (9) made this as his contribution to the Christmas spread and everyone was surprised how well they turned out. These really do stay chewy.  We used old fashioned oats and added nutmeg. Kept the dough in the freezer in between batches.  We got thick, chewy, moist, results.

I actually changed the recipe a bit: One cup of brown sugar and no white sugar, but then I made a frosting drizzle with confection sugar and butter. I also made them into heart shapes by using a cookie cutter! My grandmother loved them!

It seemed like too much butter because the dough was too moist and the cookies came out really flat. It still tasted really good, I will just reduce the butter next time.

I added a 1 1/2 c of flour instead of a 1 1/4c and I did 1/2 tsp soda and 1/2 tsp powder rather than just a full tsp soda. I also soaked the raisins in hot water while prepping the dough, and they turned out great! My husband and sons love them!

Frustrating!  For once, I didn't read the reviews before making a recipe...won't make that same mistake again!  These turned out flat, flat, flat - super disappointing!  I thought it was my pan, so I tried three different pan types and I was going to try the toaster oven next, but after reading reviews, I see that it won't help.  Darn it....have to start again from scratch.

Hubs said best cookies Ive ever made-8 years of cookies folks! Used Crisco instead of butter and brown sugar in place of the white. Added a handful of dried cherries to dry mix before incorporating. Keeper.

This is a great recipe!!! I have used it before but I changed some of the ingredients. Instead of a cup of rasins I did a 1/2 cup of rasins and 1/2 cup of crasins. These tasted amazing and we are making them again. If you would like to try this recipe, let me know how they turns out!!!

I followed the top two commenters' special instructions and these cookies came out perfect. Soaked the raisins, added a little extra flour and some baking powder, baked at 350. Great oatmeal raisin cookies!

This was the best Oatmeal Raisin recipe I've tried yet! My husband is a huge oatmeal raisin fan, and this recipe was finally the one to win his heart! I used 3/4 cup Tenderflake in place of butter, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and beat in the dry ingredients gradually, by hand. I used 1 tsp. cinnamon (instead of 3/4), 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves, and 1/4 tsp. allspice to spice the batter. I then used a 1 Tbsp. cookie scoop to distribute the batter on ungreased pans. I baked for 10 minutes each and they were perfect, chewy, and delicious! My husband couldn't stop eating them!

Really good recipe. I did tweak it (hence the 4 stars), I used 1 1/4 cups of Demerara sugar instead of the others. If you like a sweet cookie you'll want to add more, but this was enough for me. Definitely worth a try!

I played with the recipe a little bit. I added 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder, as recommended by others.  I also made a few substitutes. I substituted maple syrup for the vanilla and nutmeg for the salt. 
They came out so good that while taking 4 of them to a elderly neighbor that I had promised some to, my husband and son finished  the remainder of the 3 dozen. Good thing I had one before I left. 
I'll be making these again.

I am not sure what a 5 star oatmeal raisin cookie actually tastes like, but if I had to guess, this one comes pretty darn close.  DELICIOUS.  Perfect texture and flavorful.  Will make these every fall!

Did as recipe said and like many others it was a disaster. I bake a lot so it shouldn't have been operator error. I would suggest reading suggestions in comments before any recipe, like I didn't, even 4+ star ones. Off to make other batches of cookies for a Special Olympics bake sale. Sad this didn't turn out.

Recipe makes 3 dozen cookies. Good recipe and not too hard to follow though I wished it said to mix in separate bowls. I think I would add more raisins. The oats felt a bit under cooked and added to the chewiness. I am not sure how I would address that. The cinnamon adds a great dimension to the cookies and is not over powering.

These are ok.  Make sure you use parchment paper as the cookies will stick on some sheets. I used two different ones, and my Williams Sonoma sheet stuck, the USA pan did not. I also had to cook them for 12 minutes in my Thermador oven, not 8-10. I would also add some cloves for next time, as these are pretty bland. They are flat, but that didn't bother anyone. All in all, I think this recipe could be tweaked to make it better. I'm always mystified when people say it's a great recipe but they've made big changes to it!

Very good!  Mixed on high speed using a hand held mixer to whip the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla (using 1/2 c each of the sugars as suggested).  Hand mixed in flour and spices.  Was generous with the spices using 3t cinnamon and 1/2t each nutmeg and allspice (because that is what i had).  Had dried cranberries and raisins from left over salad mixes so I added these at the end (after soaking in boiling water).  Will make again :-)

I followed the directions to mix in the oatmeal and raisins by hand. Used an ice cream scoop for nice big cookies. Turned out great! Not flat at all. I'll probably add more cinnamon next time. My husband loves cinnamon :)

My first test batch came out flat and a really darkr.  However, once they dried, I crumbled them up and filled a Dixie cup with the mix and handed it to my husband and told him it was home made granola.  He liked it!  lol! But really, after that batch I added a little more than 1/4 th cup of extra flour and lowered the oven to 355 degrees.  I watched them carefully and they came out great at 10 minutes baking time. Oh well...live and learn.  That's why I always make a "test batch" of 6 cookies.

I changed the recipe.  I added an egg yolk to increase the chewy factor. Instead of raisins, I used dried apricots cut into raisin size pieces.  Instead of cinnamon, I used powdered ginger.  To add to the ginger flavor and to give these cookies just a little bit of heat, I added in finely chopped crystalized ginger and a tablespoon of grated fresh ginger.  A little upgrade from the standard cookie and very yummy. Thank you to my husband and brother for cutting up the ginger and apricots.

Yikes! I should have listened to my instincts and add some baking powder. I had to throw out half my dough due to two batches coming out flat and they stuck to my cookie sheet. Tasty, but messy cookies! This recipe needs to be revampted and updated to fix these issues. Total Bummer.

Baked up beautifully... with modifications 

I read through the reviews and followed the recipe with the following modifications: reduced sugar to 1/2 cup each white and brown; added 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp each of ground cloves and allspice. Baked @ 350 for 11 mins. They are perfect looking cookies and just the right amount of chewiness for an oatmeal raisin cookie. They still could've used more spice in my opinion, but I like a spicy oatmeal cookie.

I feel like this is a baseboard recipe. Something to build off of and maybe not so "tried and true". I took Ms. Becky Black's advice and added the 1/4 cup more of flour and the extra 1/2 tap of baking powder to prevent running  a flatness. I would suggest using 2 1/4 cups of oats instead. The amount listed was actually overwhelming. Lastly, placing the raisins in hot or boiling water would definitely give them that plump look and fluffy taste. 

** I also added shaved coconut in mine. :)

Made this recipe almost as stated (used dried cranberries instead of raisins).  I did have a problem with running and I used a cookie scoop for measurement.  The more I packed them in before dropping the less they ran so that may be the key to the perfect bake.  My bake time was also more like 11 minutes and I have a gas oven which tends to bake faster.  They turn quick so you def have to watch during baking.
They are good but I do think they could use a little more flavor thus the 4 star rating.

I made the cookies according to the recipe and loved texture and taste. I just had to watch my oven carefully.  I didn't walk away.  It turns out  I had to pull out my cookies at 7 minutes instead of 8 minutes, which was the minimum bake time.  They turned out great.

I'm not too fond of a recipe that you HAVE to tweak. The consistency of these are terrible, they run too much and become too hard. If you cook them any less the middle falls out.  Frustrating and a waste of time. Adding more flour and baking soda probably would have helped but I wouldn't make again.

So good! I only had quick oats and I did big cookies, so I had no problems with them being too thin. I had to put them in for about 11 min because of how big I made them but came out chewy and awesome!

With absolutely ZERO alterations, this recipe rates 5 stars. It is a perfect oatmeal cookie. I used parchment paper and baked as directed. No undesired spreading or inconsistencies. I left the butter out to soften naturally. Maybe that helped.  I highly recommend this recipe!

The best oatmeal raisin cookie I think I have ever had! It does spread a little thin, but is still chewy in the center if baked properly. I didn't have any raisins so I ended up using dry tart cherries instead- still phenomenal! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have made these twice now and they have turned out great both times. In response to the negative reviews about the cookies spreading or the cookie dough being too wet- it is probably due to the raisins being soaked in water. The recipe is NOT to blame, because the recipe does not instruct you to soak the raisins. I did, however, soak the raisins, but I patted them dry with a paper towel before adding them in the second time which really made a difference. I also took the advise of another reviewer and baked them at 350 for 9 minutes and that worked really well for me also.

Sometimes I wonder about ppl's reading comprehension skills vs baking.  I didn't change anything on basic ingredients and cookies are perfect.  Now since this was my 3rd time using this recipe I jazzed it up...added 1/4 tsp cardamom, added 1/4 tsp allspice, upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  Added 1/4 tsp almond extract.  For the plumping of raisins, I had made myself a pot of Earl Grey and used the leftover tea as the soaking liquid.  I'm really delighted with the outcome.  Already had a neighbor ask what I did differently.

I upped the butter to 1 cup and up the flour to 2 cups. A couple of tips, have your butter and eggs at room temperature, but make sure your butter does not get too soft. Just at or even slightly above room temp will be perfect.

I followed this recipe as written and didn't have any problem with them being runny at all.  I went pretty easy on creaming the butter and sugar - just until it was "almost" smooth and then mixed other ingredients until just incorporated.  Turned out perfect!

I will defiantly make these again. You have to watch the cookies while they are in the oven though cause if u go a little bit over the time, some of the cookies get burnt. When they are done baking they look a little bit raw on the inside but you have to give them time to cool off. I absolutely love this recipe!!!!!

Update: Oh drat! I forgot to read my own notes. I just made this recipe at home for the first time (after making at the cottage a zillion times) and took out my city mixer. Oh so wrong. The cookies did not turn out the same as when stirred by my "husband mixer." My electric mixer overworks the dough. And my city gas oven was too hot, baking them crisp on the edges and raw in the middle. My electric cottage oven worked so much better.  Turn hot ovens down to 350! Good luck!

----------------------------------------------------------

Original: This is a wonderful recipe and I made it almost exactly as directed. The only thing I added was a tbsp of molasses to deepen the flavor. I made them with just a spoon and a bowl because I was at the cottage so no risk of overbeating. My flour was not too dry and I used baking soda, not to be confused with baking powder that the recipe does not include but many reviewers used. They came out as promised, toasty on the outside and chewy on the inside. They are a flat cookie, not a round cakey one, but I like that. Excellent recipe. A keeper! My husband hoovered them down pretty fast, musing that they were healthy enough to eat with his morning coffee. Uh huh, any excuse would have done.

One warning, don't substitute margarine instead of butter. I always bake with butter but all I had was margarine so I gave it a shot. I still gave this recipe 5 stars because it is delicious but it came out too crumbly.  They fell apart trying to get them off the pan and also in your hand. They still disappeared quickly in my house! Next time I'll definitely use butter.

I have finally started reading most of the comments before I make recipes here.   I was running low on flour so I didn't add any more,  though I did pre-soak the raisins in the beaten eggs and vanilla, as many ORC recipes here called for.

They were nice and poofy and came out medium rare at 8 min, just how I like them.  (I always turn down my over-hot gas oven down a bit, so at about 355 degrees.)  I put sheets of foil on my cookies sheets to avoid the sticking people here mentioned.

I love this recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I skipped the white sugar altogether and used a rounded 3/4 cup of dark brown sugar.  I used extra cinnamon and approx 1/2 cup more raisins. I soaked my raisins as I usually do.   I added 1 cup chopped walnuts and 1 rounded 1/2 cup of  flaked coconut.   Because I had added extra ingredients I decided to add approx 1 tbsp of olive oil after I had creamed my sugar, butter and added the eggs.  The cookies turned out great and were a big hit with my family.

Great recipe! I followed all the ingredient proportions except cinnamon (I put in 1 tsp. instead). Following some advice from others, I soaked the raisins in hot water as I was preparing everything. I had to put the butter and sugar mix in my freezer for like 5 minutes because I had it set on my stove top and my inductor cooker turned out so it melted a little bit of the butter and sugar mix! I freaked out a bit because I was scared that my recipe was all ruined and would be runny but that didn't end up being the case. I also put the cookie mix (without the raisins and oatmeal) in the freezer for about 30 minutes.I cooked it in a toaster oven and the timing was right, which was about 8 minutes. My toaster oven's temperature is always not accurate. The oven temperature is actually lower than what it says on the oven but at the same time, it works! Maybe it's because it's so small and the contact is close to the coils. However, I think 190 degrees C on my toaster oven was too high so I had to lower it to 180 degrees C. The cookies turned out great! I would definitely keep this recipe.

I actually cut the sugars in half ( I took a chance) and they turned out good. Not overly sweet, definitely not bland.  Now that I'm a retired Teamster trucker, gotta make sure I don't over do it with the sweets. Thank you for a very simple and delicious cookie recipe that was not time prohibitive and was much better than store bought.

These cookies are so delicious! I made these for the first time yesterday and they are so soft, chewy, and flavorful. I will definitely be making them again. I made the cookies bigger than the suggested teaspoonfuls of mixture, so I cooked them for slightly longer than the suggested 8-10 minutes.

I don't know what people are complaining about. They were very good. I might cut the amount of sugar down a bit but that's just my sensitivity. They were not rock hard, they did not stick to my non-stick and no one was angry because of a cookie fail. (Really? People get angry about this?)

Turned out PERFECT! Nice and soft with a little hint of cinnamon makes them to die for! I added in some extra raisins as I like more in my cookies, also I used a cooking sheet on a metal tray and they turned out better than when I used a glass tray. Next time I will substitute in chocolate chips for the raisins and even add in walnuts! Enjoy!

Five stars - after these tweaks. I halved the recipe - so don't know if that will affect the success of my tweaks should you choose to try them. First, I substituted whole-wheat flour for white. I used just 1 quarter cup of white and brown sugar, omitting the extra table spoons. I added 1/4 teaspoon cloves and, for the heck of it, 1 table spoon organic chia seeds. I used 1/2 cup raisons and, well of course, added 1/2 cup bitter-sweet chocolate chips. I baked 8 minutes at 375, then turned the sheet around in the oven and baked another 9  to 10, depending on how they looked. Oh. My. Gosh. Mmmmmm

Excellent recipe as written!!  My whole family loved them.  I was careful not to overwork the dough and added the dry ingredients in thirds, by hand.  With my stove 350 was the magic temperature and I carefully watched them from 6 min on, removing them as the edges started to brown.  They came up easily, they didn't run, and were slightly chewy which we love.

To keep any cookies from running/spreading,take butter  right from fridge and use cheese grater to grate in mix..it works wonders

After reading the reviews, the dough was made as originally instructed, and only six cookies were baked as testers.  They turned out perfectly.  An additional 1/4 t. cinnamon was added to the rest of the dough out of personal preference.

Note to self:  Raisins were soaked first.  Non-insulated pans were used.

I had to forceably scrape the cookies off of the sheets and they fell apart in the process! They were golden brown around the edges and bottoms and "done" in any other cookie baking standard.

These were perfect. I needed to bake them a little longer than recommended (12-14 min) but they were perfect. I will definitely make again.

My cookies were on the small size ... may be needed to be super heaping teaspoon size.  Raisins are plump cause I soaked them.  Needed to remove the cookies 30 seconds after coming out otherwise they started to stick.  Delicious and a good portion size for eaters who "just" want to sample one.   Made a lot!

Perfect cookies on a cold winter's day! My first ever cookies and they were just to die for! I used Muscovado sugar  and added more raisins. I also baked them for 8 minutes. The result was amazing! Just how like my cookies - moist, chewy with caramel flavour. Couldn't stop eating them.

I've made these cookies a couple of times but I made the adjustment a couple of other reviewers suggested: 1/4 c. extra flour and 1/2 tsp extra baking soda. They were wonderful, lovely texture when baked, and a yummy cookie dough :)

I love this recipe! I've made it just about 100 times and they are always enjoyed by my family. I tend to put in more cinnamon than required and sometimes I add a tablespoon of dry, unsweetened cocoa powder. It doesn't tasted like a chocolate cookie but it gives the flavor just a little bit more depth. Great recipe! Will be making it again, again :)

Several changes because I had only one egg and wanted it extra healthy. For missing egg I used abt 3 tsp chia seed soaked in 2 Tb warm water and dded 1/2 tsp baking powder. Also subbed coconut oil for butter (it was solid). Soaked yellow raisins in warm water 15 minutes then drained. Added more spices-cardamon, nutmeg, allspice, ground ginger. Came out perfect and hardy. I will freeze and  use for picky teenager's breakfast snack.

I just made these, and love them! I have a 5 month old son and I was able to make these while wearing him in his baby wrap. The recipe was simple and easy, which is always a plus! I read the reviews before making them, and I did what one commenter said to do and added an extra 1/2 tsp of baking soda, and an extra 1/2 cup of flour. They rose like they were suppose to and weren't flat at all when I did that. I sprinkled the top before baking with a just a little bit of extra cinnamon, and everyone has loved them so far! This recipe made me 32 cookies that were ranging in size from medium to large! 
I would definitely make these again, I'm glad I found a recipe for my favorite cookie.

These cookies come out perfect in a dark mini muffin top tin.  The only thing I changed was using extra cinnamon and dark brown sugar. It completely changed the taste to the cookies and I've made these cookies dozens of times now in the last 6 months.

I used golden raisins otherwise, they were awesome, moist, great flavor, and a great recipe! I did bake them a full 10 minutes @ 375* on a slipmat, with a heaping teaspoon of dough...turned out perfect in shape and size. Will make them many more times!

The cookie recipe as written makes inedible cookies. Far too much sugar and butter. The cookies flattened out to gooey chewy patties of burned sugar. A great waste of ingredients.

This recipe was amazing, and did not give me any difficulties. I was a little worried due to some of the reviews I read before making these cookies, but they were very easy to make. The final product was not flat and did not stick together at all, and I did not make any alterations except reduce the butter (to make it "healthier"). They are very soft and flavorful, and the only part I was iffy on was that the texture was a little like cake. Even then, this recipe turned out great for my first time!

I had to add extra 1/2 cup of  flour so it wouldn't be too wet. Using cookie scooper,  cooking time for my oven is 11 mins @ 375F. Would make it again.

Loved this recipe. I used 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce per egg since I realized a little late that I didn't have any eggs. The cookies came out so soft and delicious. I didn't make any other changes otherwise. The first few in the oven, I over baked a bit since they still seemed mushy. However, the others I realized that they solidified nicely during cool down and remained a great amount of chewiness. Didn't even have to worry about them being undercooked since I didn't use eggs.

Perfect, soft cookies. I undercook just a bit and let cool on pan, also roll into balls larger than a walnut and get about 52 cookies. These are my partner's absolute FAV cookie, so I make them a lot!

My first time to try this recipe I added chopped cashews instead of raisins. I've been doing so ever since and it was perfect for me! I just drop a small amount of the batter because it spreads out wide, and the result is a soft chewy oatmeal cookie but still crunchy on the outside. I was able to make A LOT with this recipe. Note: I baked this in a turbo broiler for 3-4 mins. for that perfect "crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside" oatmeal cookie.

The flavor of this recipe was great but these cookies did run even after I added 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder.

I have been baking for 30 years and usually use the Quaker oats vanishing cookies.  I prefer a much more thick, chewy cookie and this recipe just isn't them.

So, so, good! Made these last night and I couldn't stop eating them.  Wish they weren't so sweet though. Woke up this morning and they are still moist and chewy. I always do a small test batch following the recipe exactly and also because everyone's oven temps can run differently. I found that dropping small amounts of the dough to bake (12 fit on my cookie sheet) worked pretty well and they baked just fine at the temp the recipe says. They are a tad bit too sweet, I may hold off on a little of the sugar next time although my husband and son LOVED them.

I really wish I had read the reviews before I made these. Thee spread and stuck to the pan so badly I ended up with granola.

I used 1/2 cup white sugar, soaked raisins in hot water while mixing dough and baked at 350 instead of 375.  They came out perfectly! Moist, chewy, and slightly crispy edges.

Followed directions  completely.  Watch to make sure they don't get over cooked. Parchment paper is a must.  Yummy! Crispy and chewy.

This is a great basic receipe. You must refrigerate the dough to keep it from spreading.   I also use raisonetts (chocolate covered raisins).  They add a much better flavor.  , really chocolate covered raisins, how can you go wrong?

I used the suggestion of reducing the white sugar and using just 1/2 cup. I also added a dash of nutmeg for flavor... Yum. This is my first time doing this recipe and it came out great! My husband couldn't stop eating them.

I have tried this recipe several times and my cookies don't seem to be cooked well at 375 for 10 minutes. I would do 400 to get them cooked and have a crispy edge.

I'm looking for a good Oatmeal cookie. I always read the reviews for a little insight. I don't like to waste my time or money making something that isn't what i expect. I made the cookies with the following changes based on the reviews. Added 1/4c flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup. Baked at 350 for 10 min convection oven. They turned out great. They had a nice rise, crisp on the outside and soft inside. No issues with sticking. Thank you to the original submitter and all the reviewers.

A also added 1/4 cup extra flour. I also substituted 1/2  shortening for 1/2 the butter and added the extra spices (1/2 tsp allspice and 1/4 ground cloves) Husband loved them but I think they were a tad dry. So I added 1/8 c vegetable oil next batch. They were perfect and still didn't run.

Had to add about a half cup more flour to prevent spreading. I also kicked up the spices. Added alot more cinnamon, nutmeg , clove, and vanilla. I found these to be bland and too thin. . Use more flour to stiffen it up and it will be better.

Delicious. Required a couple of extra minutes in the oven to become the texture we were looking for. I used quick oats, which was the right choice for preventing spread. I should have used parchment, because they did glue themselves to the cookie sheets.

i did mix by hand. tried my hardest not to over-mix. also, i made big balls about palm-sized in fear of them flattening out too much. baked at 350 for 10 minutes, checking at eight. also, for the flavor. i did add a little root beer extract instead of vanilla. cinnamon. salt. sugars. soaked the raisins in hot water. turned out pretty great

I added a full tsp of Cinnamon instead of 3/4 tsp and soaked the raisins in boiling water before adding them.  Otherwise, I kept the recipe exactly the same and the cookies turned out amazing!  Will definitely be using this recipe again.

The first sheet came out flat. I added 1/2 cup more flour to the remaining dough. That took care of it and the rest were good.

These are very good, but need a few adjustments.  I don't think they are overly sweet.  The sweetness is just right.  They are kind of flat tasting though.  I made a 1/2 recipe, did a sample cookie first.  Then added about 1/8 t. more salt and 1/8 t. more baking soda.  If baking these in high humidity, I'd add 2 T more flour.  I made them in the dead of winter with very low humidity and they were the perfect consistency.

These turned out amazing! I took them to an ice cream social and they were wiped out! I did microwave the raisins with a tsp of water to plump them- made them softer and juicier. I totally recommend this recipie!!!

The original recipe is lovely home style goodness. I wanted something a little more refined so:

I adjusted  by replacing rolled with steel cut oats. Replaced the cinnamon with tsp. ground cardamon and tsp minced orange zest. Replaced the all purpose flour with a cup of white bread flour and a quarter cup of rye flour.

Minor changes: 1 stick butter, 1 stick margarine, 18pkts of saccharin (instead of 3/4 cup sugar), and 3 cups of oats was a little easier and still came out good. My diabetic version. Seemed to get darker than I wanted in a faberware convection oven. I had to lower the temp to 340 and 8 min was plenty.
Thanks,

I made these cookies for the very first time today. I followed the directions EXACTLY and they came out perfect. The only problem I encountered was I ate too many of them while watching football. Oh, I paid attention to the color and in my gas stove 8 minutes was The appropriate baking time.

Followed exactly and loved the results. If you drop by teaspoonfuls, you'll end up with way more than 48 cookies. Try it by tablespoonfuls.

I did not care for this recipe. Followed exactly; baked for 9 minutes.  I was dubious of the 375F and lack of flour.  Cookies spread to a crisp.  I think you'd have to up the flour and lower the temp.

I could only give 4 stars due to modifications.  I did as other reviewers said and added 1/4 c of flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder. These are the BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever had! I also added cranberries and soaked the raisins like suggested as well. Will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just tried this recipe and found it to be one of the best Oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten! I followed the recipe just as it was written and used a Kitchen Aid blender to mix all ingredients. I did kick the cooking time up to 13 mins. then let the cookies completely cool before removing them from a "FOIL LINED" cookie sheet. This recipe is a Keeper! Will use again & again.

I followed some suggestions from the other reviews... used 1/2 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown.  I also added 1/2 tsp allspice.  In my oven I cooked them at 350 degrees for 9 minutes, and they came out super soft.

I made these with butter Crisco and they almost didn't make it in the oven the batter was superb. I know, I know don't eat raw cookie dough. Just the best and everyone loved them. I found if I baked them for 10 minutes and rested them for five they came off the pan perfectly. 10/10 will back again. Thanks.

I like this recipe .. I tried 4 ways of baking ( non stick , aluminum pan with and without non stick sheet, and one pan of lightly pressing them down ) and they all still came out the same way .. I made the recipe as it was writen and it came out great ... a bit too sweet for me so I will down the sugar next time .. the raisins were sweet enough !!

First attempt at baking cookies and as oat meal and raisin cookies are my favorites I gave this a try!! Turned out very well just as it is  written in this recipe - the whole family loved them including my one year old grand daughter. My husband said " don't change a thing"

I made two batches from this recipe. The first batch was made per the recipe. Wet ingredients were mixed with a hand mixer, dry ingredients were mixed by hand. They came out too crunchy and a bit bland for my liking. For the second batch, I added 1/2 cup applesauce, extra Cinnamon, a dash of Cloves and Allspice. These changes made the cookies much better, moister and more flavorful.

OMG I have tried so many recipes for Oatmeal cookies and these are definitely the best. I followed the recipe to the tee and they turned out nice and chewy but not flat. My husband had six right out of the oven!!

Easy & delicious recipe that took virtually no time at all to make. For a healthier alternative, I substituted the butter for applesauce and reduced the sugar slightly to compensate for the extra sweetness. I also used all organic ingredients and an oil spray to grease my stainless steel cookie sheet. Turned out perfectly, slightly crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside! The only slight modification I will make next time is to soak the raisins as others have mentioned and possibly add some chocolate chips! 2 thumbs up!!!

We used old fashioned Quaker Oats and I think that may have been a mistake - they were super dry and oat-y if you know what I mean.  I think Quick Cook oats may work better and next time we'll also soak the raisins in boiling water and use parchment paper on the pans - they were really hard to get off the pans without parchment paper.  I'd try a totally different recipe next time.  Very disappointing.

Taste is good.  Like many other reviewers, I found the texture to be way off.  I like oatmeal cookies to be dense, thick and chewy.  These spread right out and were almost see through.  I even added 1/4 c flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder per another reviewer's suggestion... I might try it again sometime adding more flour since we are at 4,000 feet above sea level.  Or I might just move on to another recipe.

Look no further for a soft good oatmeal cookie. My cookie never spread or anything but then I did not use a mixer I just used a wooden spoon to mix everything and for my family I added ground cloves and a little more cinnamon for extra flavor. The total cooking time was 8 minutes and they were perfect and still chewy the next day. I find the recipe versatile because I also added chocolate chips and walnuts but even without them this cookie is a winner. Thanks for sharing.

The only things I did different was I used 1/4c less white sugar and I soaked the raisins for 30 minutes in hot water with a little vanilla added... these are perfect! The less sugar is strictly a personal preference and doesn't reflect on how good this recipe is as written (my kids tell me good ol' water is too sweet for me! lol)!

Excellent cookies, crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle. Thanks to everyone who encouraged us to follow the directions and let the cookies cool slightly on the cookie sheet. When they first came out of the oven they looked beautiful but crumbled when I tried to remove them. After a few minutes they crisped up nicely.

My husband loved these cookies! I have often had trouble with cookies being flat. Thanks to LORR4824. I followed her advice of using a shiny cookie sheet instead of the insulated kind. They turned out perfectly. It did take longer than 8 to 10 minutes to bake, but that may have been my oven. Perfect cookies!

Awesome recipe!  Only changes that I made were using 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbs less butter, and cooked them at 350 for 10 mins.  I also made a batch using craisins and they were great too. Easy, delicious cookies!

I made these cookies for our Christmas party and my guests raved about them! I used bakers sugar, bread flour, and raisins I brought back from Italy...They tasted amazing: chewy on the inside and crispy on the edges. Perfect!

These were great! I followed the recommendations by Rebecky to increase the flour and presoak the raisins. I left the baking soda alone, however, because I didn't want them to come out too puffy. Instead of using an ungreased cookie sheet, I used waxed paper and had no issues with it. They came out soft- but not too chewy- and delicious!

I made these today exactly as written.  If you like a flat/crisp cookie, than this one is for you.  I like them, but my family likes a 
softer, chewier cookie.  Good flavor and easy to make.  I used a special "baking" raisin that is moister, so no soaking required as some members have suggested.

This is worst cookie recipe I have ever had the misfortune of trying.  Wish I could give it no stars.  Bland, flat, and a vague disagreeable flavor.  Stay away!

I followed the recipe exactly and the first batch I put in the oven came out flat. I put the rest of the batter in the refrigerator for 1-2hrs and the rest came out great. The taste is good and it has just the right amount of sweetness.

I loved these and so did my neighbors and colleagues... Don't let them bake too long if you want -soft on the inside cookies- pull them out when they are still soft and they will be perfect! Thanks for the awesome recipe... You can add more cinnamon and they come out awesome too!

Really great cookies.  One tip if you don't want your cookies to spread as much is to replace part of the butter with Crisco.  I added 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup Crisco, otherwise, I made the recipe as called for.  My result was a moist, chewy cookie with good body.  Now let's hope I don't eat them all before the kids get home from school!

I do love these cookies but I only gave it 4 stars because I found I had to tweak it quite a bit:
Because I found the batter a bit thin I added and extra 1/4 cup of flour. I used an electric mixer until about half of the flour was in then added the remaining ingredients with a wooden spoon. I do this everytime and they always come put perfect.
And for personal preference I add an extra 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of each cloves and allspice.

To be honest I only got to taste one cookie out of the batch but I liked it.  I used 1/2 c white sugar and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Baked them at 350 for 10 mins.  I will be making these again especially so I can try more than one!!

Very good. Actually had trouble getting these to spread out so flattened them a bit. Used 1/2 teasp. cinnamon, 1/4 teasp. nutmeg and 1/4 teasp. Allspice too, and a cup of chocolate chips. Would make them again.

i substituted the egg with warm water and flax seed meal, the raisins with crasins, the white sugar with splenda, and i accidentally put in only 1 and 3/4 cup of oats rather than 2 3/4 cups of oats and they still came out amazing! i basically made a vegan version of this recipe (i have vegan butter too). it was so easy and delicious. i love when recipes call for what you already have in your house.

These came out awesome. Followed the recipe to a T, except I did soak the raisins in hot water while I mixed up the dough, then chilled it all in the fridge for about 39 minutes. I made large cookies (18) and baked them for 10 mins. Yum!

I have NEVER made cookies before, actually I have never baked anything other than store bought brownie mix.  These cookies turned out perfectly!  I didn't change the recipe at all, just soaked the raisins in some hot water first like some people have mentioned.  I uploaded a photo of how they turned out (my cookies are on the plate with the cherries design).  I'm not sure why the recipe didn't work for others, maybe I have beginners luck.

I love this recipe! I did add the extra flour and soak the raisins. Next time the only thing I'd do differently is not soak the raisins. This is the best recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies I've come across!

My biggest issue is there isn't a high altitude conversion, other than that, I think the cookies will be good and yummy.  They are looking strange, a bit runny, but still have a little time to cook.  I will write another review after we eat them.  I am hoping to pack a few in my REI no sit zip pants for our hike tomorrow.  You can get everything in those pants and you don't even need to sit to unzip.  The cookies are going to be flat, but they should fit even with the added walnuts.  I didn't soak the raisins, but if I did, maybe they would make the cookies plumpier and even then I could put them in the REI no sit zip pants.

For some reason the cookie dough was so thick that the cookie barely spread on the pan. They cooked really fast so I had to turn the heat down. Overall they were okay but I won't be making again sorry.

recipe was easy to follow.. however, did read around and cut sugar (used only 150g brown sugar) and also popped mixture into the fridge for 10mins... also used chopped cranberries and walnut to replace raisins... tasted great! will try again using lesser sugar as our family palate is not on the sweet side... will also want to make it more chewy vs crispy. thanks everyone!

I loved this recipe. I am one of those cooks who rarely follows the ingredients to a T and I added about 1/2 cup coconut and doubled the raisins. I also boiled the raisins for 5 minutes and added them at the end. I also added extra flour because the raisins were so moist. They turned out wonderful. I also used a stoneware pan- no need for greasing the sheet. Thanks for the recipe. Loved it.

Highly recommend to cook closer to 8 minutes then 10, wish there was something a little extra in terms of flavor.  For my taste they are missing something but not sure what.  Taste better when softer and warm.

Great recipe! The cookies had a perfect consistency, golden brown on the outside and chewy on the inside! Normally I like my cookies a little sweeter. If you like your cookies really sweet I would add a little more sugar.

these were so amazing but i made sure to add a 1/4 cup of extra flour, it really does make them come out amazingly!! they were done in less than a day, ohh and i added 1tsp of cinnamon because i love it, and also 1tsp of allspice, gave them that wonderful smell that made you want to take them out of the oven before they were even done!!

I chopped the oats in my food processor before adding.  These cookies are really good.  Not too sweet with a hint of the cinnamon. I will make these again.

Some reviewers said they weren't very chewy so to combat that I added coconut and dried cranberries. Also reduced white sugar to 1/2 C. These were very chewy and flavorful and will make again with these modifications.

I absolutely should have read the reviews before making these. They taste great but spread WAY too thin. The sugar needs to be cut down to about half. I ended up baking them on parchment paper and the spreading wasn't as bad but I still will go back to using my grandmas's tried and true recipe.

For everyone who had trouble with it turning out flat and crunchy, I recommend that they keep it in the oven for 10-12 minutes and even if it looks a little bit soggy, to take it out. It will harden if you give it 10 minutes to cool but the inside will be chewy. 

I loved it and it was very easy to make. A little bit too much sugar, but that can easily be changed.

I think this is a very good recipe. I reduced the both sugars by 1/4 cup though as I don't like very sweet cookies. I also used crasins instead of rasins. They came out just like I had hoped. No problems with running as described in other reviews. This is a keeper IMO.

I'm not sure what the problem is with this recipe. These cookies are a good consistency. I added a bit of nutmeg and cut both sugars to 1/2 cup as some had suggested they may be too sweet. And I added 1/2cup of small chocolate chips. I put the oven at 350 as I think 375 is too hot. They are great cookies this way, not troubles with running or sticking.

Luckily I read some of the reviews about the thinness/running....my first batch was way too thin.  I added less than 1/4 cup (maybe an 1/8) of flour to the remaining batter, dropped the oven temp to 350 and baked for closer to 10-14 mins (depending on size).  I did not soak the raisins as others suggested.  The slight modifications worked wonders and the cookies were delicious.  Everyone loved them.  Yummy and chewy.

Ok so I give this one 4 stars after I tweaked it. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 3/4 c. unbleached flour, 1/2 c. each white and brown sugar and 1/4 unprocessed bran, I omitted the salt as I do in all my cooking and substituted with 1/4 tsp. baking powder. I had no problem getting them off the cookie sheet as I use parchment paper. Great healthy cookie! Yum

I was so excited to try this recipe. Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite but these were not great. Some ran into each other but it could've been that I made the scoops too large.  They were very bland and lacking flavor.  After baking they were stuck to the pan and flat.  In my opinion it just needed more kick and raisins as I could barely taste them.  I was hoping to have a go to recipe but instead got a burnt on cookie sheet to scrub.

I just baked these and they are delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I added just a tad more cinnamon because I love cinnamon and I added some walnuts.  The cookies were not a doughy mess, nor did I have an issue with the cookies sticking or falling apart. Maybe it's because I let them cool for a few minutes on the sheet before I transferred them to the cooling rack. Do not overbake or they will be dry.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These cookies are good, but do not taste like 'traditional' oatmeal cookies because of the heavy influence of the spices.

I am glad I doubled this recipe because these cookies were loved by everyone! I made a few adjustments since I was working with what I had on hand. I used half Country Crock butter substitute and half Crisco. I also used half of the raisins, since it seemed like a lot. Next time I will use the correct amount. I made sure to cool the dough before spooning onto aluminum foil lined pan. My cookies were not flat like some people described although I had to cook them a little longer than the time listed. Since I lost my own cookie recipe, I am adopting yours.

My son's girlfriend wanted Oatmeal Raisin cookies, and I could not find my old recipe.  I made these as directed.  They came out wonderful.  I used my old air-bake cookie sheets ungreased and there was no sticking, no running, etc etc.  The raisins were nice and chewy like they should be and the cookies were soft even after a few days.  I used my kitchen aid mixer and the consistency of the dough was perfect.  I only baked the cookies for 8 minutes as my electric oven tends to run a little hot.  Came back to save the recipe to my box and will most definitely make again.

I loved them. Like others, I used less white sugar (-1/4 Cup) and added more cinnamon because in my opinion you can always go for more cinnamon. Overall, delicious and soft! Yumm. It would be great with some vanilla ice cream...

This recipe is awesome! Turned out fluffy and chewy. I added a little more cinammon and a dash of nutmeg. I cooked mine on parchment paper, too. Parchment paper is a godsend, for anyone who doesn't really know their baking pans.

We loved the cookies made with this recipe. It's fairly simple and fast, but I use it as a base for monster cookies. Rather than raisins I add a cup mixed with dried cranberries/cherries. I also add about 3/4 c each of pecans and chocolate chips. I also use ICBIN butter to cut back on fat. The first time I made these they came out thick and chunky (the way we want em) but last time they baked very flat. They taste the same and I didnt change anything - but why did they come out flat?

I followed the recipe but used craisins instead of raisins.  I cooked them for 9 minutes and they turned out perfectly chewy.  I'll definitely use this recipe again!

These cookies are awesome!!  They did not run at all.  I did only use a 1/2 cup of white sugar and used 3 cups of oatmeal and used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, because we both love it, next time I will use a little more!   Also I halved the batter and added raisins to one half, and quartered the other 1/2= 1/4 with butterscotch chips and the other rest with the chips and walnuts....mmmmmmmm

Great easy recipe for making these type of cookies.  what I have done is cut both sugars to only 1/2cup each to cut the sweetness.  Everyone loves them. Have been makiing them almost once a month since September.

I made a lower fat version of these and they were fantastic - not quite the same consistency as a regular cookie, but a big hit.  I followed the other advice listed - decreased sugars to 1/2 cup each; added 1/4 tsp each of allspice and cloves, and soaked the raisins in hot water.  I used only 1/4 cup of Becel and added 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead - yummy and very moist!

Phenominal! I also added pumpkin spice and nutmeg to make them more tasty! Also microwaving the raisins covered in water for 45 seconds worked well. Finally, the extra 1/4C flour and soda helped shape the cookies- I don't think they would have been as tasty without it! They're a favorite!

This is the second cookie I have ever prepared. it came out great. I read the other reviews (which were   very helpful thank you). I soaked the raisins and held back the white sugar. I didn't add any  extra flour and the consistency was nice, firm yet chewy.

I found this recipe a great one, the only thing I changed on it was to add about 1/4 flour more as it was quite wet, but found it worked perfectly.  The other comments as to it not working is maybe they melted the butter instead of letting it get to room temp that is the only thing that would make it not work.  Great recipe and makes a lot of cookies, great for freezing also.

Attention all cookie lovers out there:  If you are frustrated with cookies sticking to the pan, you really need to invest in a Silpat silicone baking mat.  I don't know how I lived without it!  Cookies slide right off the mat.  Also indispensable is a melon baller for scooping the cookie dough onto the mat, makes neat, uniform cookies.  I loved this recipe and will definitely be making these cookies again.

I don't know what to think of these... they taste awesome but the cooking process is a guessing game. They browned way too fast on the edges even at 350 degrees and this was using my convection oven. Perhaps they need less butter. Sorry for the mediocre rating, but I don't have the time to mess with difficult cookies ;) I followed the recipe less 1/3 C white sugar. The dough's consistency was fine, it's just that baking issue...

I followed the recipe exactly. These came out perfect. I am not a fan of Oatmeal Raisin Cookies but made them for my mother, who loved them. 

I had no problem with sticking to the cookie sheet (use cooking spray) and you should clean the sheet between batches. And dough was perfect consistency.

Awesome recipe thank you! It is a keeper.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, and they came out perfect! I struggle at times baking in a high altitude, but these came out just great. Would highly recommend. :-)

I hardly ever have my baked goods come out "pretty", and these actually did!  I rolled them into nice little balls (not globs) and they came out very nicely. The only changes I made were to add 1/4 cup extra flour, 1/4 teaspoon extra baking soda, and a full teaspoon of cinnamon. Delicious!

I followed the suggestions of other viewers by decreasing the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, soaking the raisins, increasing the cinnamon to 1 tsp, and mixing the dough by hand. The recipe doesn't specify which kind of rolled oats to use. So I used the Quaker 100% whole wheat old fashioned rolled oats. The cookies were wayyy to oaty. My boyfriend said they were "decent" and tasted like eating a granola bar, and he was being nice. They were dry and crunchy and difficult to eat. I dont think I will be making these again.

Basic good recipe. I tarted it up with 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/4 cup dried blueberries and 1/2 cup walnuts. The best! I baked them for 11 minutes at 375 in a gas oven and after 5 minutes turned them out on a cooling rack.

Easy recipe and a good, basic oatmeal raisin cookie. Not overly sweet. Texture of cookie is on the cake-y side so you may want to press them down if you want a flatter shape.

In an attempt to be cutting out white flour and white sugar from my baking this is how I altered these cookies.  I used Turbinado Raw  sugar in place of the white sugar... it worked well but I think that if I grind it in a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle it would be a bit smoother.  I also mixed my flour 1/4c barley flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1/2 white.   I used semi- sweet chocolate chips however because I had no more raisins in the house. Perhaps I should have checked that before trying to make oatmeal raisin cookies.

Anyhow, the cookies turned out fantastic, they weren't runny at all, perhaps because of using the heavier flour and they taste amazing, could even use a little less sugar next time.

These turned out to be really good! The only changes I made was to add 3 cups oats and let the dough chill in the frig overnight. I scooped it outwith a small ice cream scoop and set them on the cookie sheets. Baked 15 min at 375. They came out  with crip edges and soft in the centers, not hard and dry like oatmeal cookies tend to be. I"ll be making them this way again.

The cookie itself is fantastic. didn't add anything. The only thing I didn't add was Raisins because I didn't have any. My husband despises oatmeal cookies, he can't keep his hand out of the cookie jar with these. 

I used tablespoon and still got over 40 cookies.  It made the cookies thicker. They are also very soft and fluffy. :) Will definitely keep this recipe

I LOVED this cookie recipe! Only changes I made were a dash of all-spice, a little more cinnamon, dash of pepper, and yogurt-covered raisins. Awesome!

My version turned out pretty well. Made the cinnamon a round, whole number at 1 teaspoon. Added 1 tsp allspice. Took out 1/2c of the white sugar, and also hydrated the raisins as I prepared the dough. I ran out of baking soda, so I put in baking powder instead.
I hand-mixed as suggested by the other reviewers and although a little tired out was pleased at the consistency. Baked at 180 degrees Celsius so I ended up cooking it twice as long as indicated. Chewy, yummy and flavorful :)

My sister and I wanted to be nice and cook a batch of oatmeal raisin cookies for her roommates to say thankyou (as I am imposing myself on everyone for two nights).
I consider myself an alright cook and had a bad feeling about the extremely runny consistency of the cookie mixture. My sister, on the other hand who believes in following things by the book, assured me to just follow the recipe and go ahead and bake them as they were. 
What a disaster. Firstly they were ridiculously runny and became flat like giant pancakes. We had to chisel them off the non stick, heavily greased baking tray ( by the way what kind of a cookie recipe needs you to grease the tray??). Even though golden brown and cooked for the advised time, they were cakey and soft. I like chewy cookies, but not cakey soft cookies, weirdest consistency raw and baked. This mixture DEFINITELY does not need 2 eggs,  unless you want to make oatmeal raisin muffins or cake. 
If you are going to bake these, don't add the second egg and use a lot more flour or find any other recipe than this. 
However, good flavour.

I lost the tried and true cookie book I've used for 21+ years, so decided to make these based on the high ratings. Mine were bland and dry, and did not flatten at all. They were hard, dull little dry lumps. They need more cinnamon, butter, sugar, and raisins, and less flour. I added chocolate chips and craisins to salvage the last bit of dough and these were much better. Time to buy another cookie book, if I can find the right one.

Very delicious..I took the advice from others and used only 1/2 cup sugar and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.I baked at 350 for 10-15 minutes which worked great I did have to watch them..I did use a little nonstick cooking spray and removed from pan right away to cool..Since i was also in the mood for chocolate i used raisinets instead..They were great..Will definitely use again..

Chose this recipe because it was healthy. Though first time, chose to cut down on the sugar by half and added more cinnamon and vanilla, just in case. Perhaps this is why the cookies didn't flatten like they were supposed to? Either way...delicious, healthy, and excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing!

These were quite tastey, but not very thick.  I added just a tablespoon of flour and they thickened right up.  So good my even husband, who is skeptical of oatmeal cookies, liked them.

Well, I was nervous after reading the reviews, but was the better for it. I made these for my 3 year old who has dairy allergies. I never made cookies for her before and am not the best cookie baker, but these came out GREAT. I used smart balance light butter (which is surprisingly dairy-free and recommended for vegans). In replace of the eggs I used "egg replacement" (which can be purchased at whole foods). When I finished making the batter, I was afraid it was a little loose, so like the some of the other reviewers I added a little flour (roughly about 1/4 cup). After I added the oats, the batter thickened again. I baked them with my fingers crossed and my goodness they came out perfect!! Even my husband, who is not to crazy about sweets, loved them. But best of all my sweet little angle (who helped mom make them) love them as well. Thanks for sharing this recipe and thanks for reviews!

Well I read the reviews and the only thing I did differently was add 1/2 tsp baking power just in case the cookies flattened out.  I have not tasted them yet but I have very flat cookies.  I have been baking for years and I have never had any problems.  I will try this recipe 1 more time and follow a few suggestions if they taste good.

This was a really good recipe. I used 2 cups of rolled oats, and 3/4 cup shredded coconut, and the cookies came out wonderfully.

These cookies turned out great. I gave it a 4 star because the cookies did stick to my non-stick pan...even though I greased it too. However, unlike other reviews my cookies turned out fluffy and not flat and hard. The batter was just perfect not runny at all. My husband loved them and almost ate the entire batch by himself! I followed the recipe word for word and then turned out just fine.

This is one of the absolute best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever made! I also add about 3/4 C. craisins along with the raisins, and it makes them even more fabulous! Thanks for sharing it!!!

These turned out quite good but I made a lot of changes after reading other reviews hence the four star. Here's what I did - reduced fat by cutting butter to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup oil, upped the flour to 1.5cups (50% whole wheat and 50% all purpose flour), reduced sugar to 1/2 cup each. Added 1.5tsp of baking pwd and 1/2 tsp baking pwd. I also added a cup of milk (because the mixture was too tight) and added chocolate chips.

SO GOOD AND YUMMY!!!  Make sure not to overbake them or they won't be chewy.....still good, but we like our cookies on the soft side.

We added craisins in addition to the raisins and they were delish!

My boyfriend and I LOVED these cookies.  We added chopped walnuts and took out a little bit of white sugar and they came out perfect.  We made bigger cookies and we liked them chewy so we made sure not to over cook them and they were slammin'

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe.  I usually add a cup of raisins, but with or without they are so good.  I like to use a good cinnamon since it really is the standout favor.

I just made these cookies and there great!  Although I didn't have 2 cups of oats so I only put 1 1/2 cup   Also at 10 min at 375 was a great time to bake them at!    A good tip for help on sticking to the pan is to put parment paper on the tray, my foods teacher taught me that.    :)

The dough is DELICIOUS! The cookies just weren't right.  They flattened out and completely stuck to the baking sheet.  Would be a 5 star recipe if you can get them to not spread out so thinly.

I found these cookies to be just wonderful!  I followed a few of the recommendations from the other reviews and they turned out perfect.  I used a sil-pat(silicone baking sheet) on my pan so they wouldn't stick and I rolled them into balls before placing them on the sil-pat.  They didn't get flat at all instead they stayed nice and fluffy.  I also increased the cinnamon to a full teaspoon and decreased the white sugar to just half a cup and the raisins really do give it just the right amount of sweetness.

I'm not a cook, but this recipe was easy. I followed some of the reviews, less sugar, craisins not raisins and used 1 tsp ground cloves.  I couldn't keep my wife away! I will make these often and tweak them for other tastes.

Turned out flat nothing like the picture!! Taste good but you have to get past their appearance and most people eat with their eye's,  why would I pick these cookies over a snickerdoodle or chocolate chip cookie. I sure won't bake them again.

With cutting down the white sugar to 1/2 cup and the addition of ground clove and ground ginger (which were suggestions from other reviewers) These cookies turned out great and I'm not even a big fan of oatmean cookies. I made them for a Christmas tray I'm giving to family members who love these cookies. So they must really be good. Thanks to all for the suggestions.

Just made 8 dozen of these exactly as given in the recipe, except for adding a couple teaspoons of Chai Spice.  They came out perfectly as a crispy, tasty cookie.  I hope I can do as well with my next project!

I followed the recipe exactly and these cookies turned out PERFECT. A huge hit with the whole household. Thinking next time I might add some cream cheese frosting after they cool.

My wife made these but made two changes,used 1/4 cup butter 1/2 cup margarine and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts,she used the quick oats and the texture and shape came out perfect.My teenage grandaughter and friends loved them too and are going to buy the ingredients and pitch in for an upcoming bake sale at school.

THE BEST OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIES I'VE EVER MADE. The only thing I did differently was use 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of craisins because that's what I had in the house and they were AMAZING!!!

They came out a little soft (tending to fall apart easy), but they taste fabulous.  Might add more cinnamon next time.

So far the only problem I am having is it is taking much longer to bake, but I decided to try omitting the butter and substituting with applesauce. This is actually the first time I have used applesauce so I wasn't sure what to expect. I also used fresh cranberries instead of raisins, just for fun. Just tried one and seems to have baked ok, and the cranberries still add a little sweetness/tangyness, just needed more time I guess.

YUMMY! Used wheat flour instead of white, these came out nice. I also grated a few pieces of chocolate in the batter before baking. 4 of 5 wish these were a little more moist.

This was similar to a recipe I used to use, but have since lost sadly.  I added about a cup of extra oats, and another half cup of flour as I thought the dough seemed a bit runny.  I added an additional half cup of raisins, and I also soaked my raisins in boiling water for about a half hour before I started baking, it mad the raisins plump and moist.  I also used about a tablespoon more butter, and an extra half cup of brown sugar.  I dropped them a tablespoon at a time on to the pan and they came out nice and moist and did not spread at all.  The next time I make them I will definitely be adding more raisins!

These are ho-hum oatmeal cookies. I added a 1/4 c of flour and a bit of baking powder as suggested by another baker, and they didn't run flat, but they didn't have the taste or chewiness I was looking for. I won't use this recipe again.

Great recipe, a little on the sweet side but went over very well.  I added walnuts and soaked the raisins in boiling water for a few minutes to make them plumper.  Will definitely make this recipe again.  Husbands office asking for more!

Wonderful!!  I did make changes.  1/4 additional cup of flour. 1/4 less cup of white sugar. 2 tsp of Baking Powder to replace the baking soda. 1 tsp cinnamon.  This recipe was so thick I worried that the cookies would be dry, but they weren't.  So delicious.  I can't help wondering if the problems mentioned by others about "spreading too thin" have to do with calling for baking soda instead of baking powder, which I used.  Anyway, I probably won't add the extra four next time!

These were awesome!!!!   Chewy with a little crisp.  I have no idea what the rest of you were having complaints about.  Runny,flat,hard,sticking??? No way.  This was my first time making cookies from scratch and they fulfilled my desire for oatmeal cookies exactly as the recipe was written. I baked these for the full 10 min and they turned out perfect, they were nice and golden and all around 1/4 inch thick.  This one is a keeper.

These are DIVINE!!!  I just made them and they are absolutely PERFECT.  Perfect texture, consistency, flavor... however, I did make a couple adjustments - I used honey instead of white sugar, palm sugar instead of brown sugar, and I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves.  AMAZING.

This recipe was so good I can't understand why tweaks needed to be made by a lot of people! Mine came out perfectly moist, chewy and delicious, and I followed the recipe and cooking instructions exactly. I loved them! Yum~

I have never EVER cooked or baked anything in my life (Ramen noodles don't count) and I needed a snack to serve my speech class. I was tired of serving store-bought cookies, so I decided to try to make some from scratch. I guess I had beginner's luck, because they came out GREAT. Everyone loved them. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat them myself because I'm lactose intolerant, but they must have been great because everyone wanted more. They were also fun to make. Awesome recipe!

Hard to review on original recipe because I made some changes...1 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup white sugar.  1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  2 cups large flake oats & 1/2 cup quick oats.  Soaked raisins in 1/4 cup brandy for 20 minutes (discarded extra brandy after soaking).  Not dry at all.  Great flavour with additional spices and brandy.

The only adjustment I had to make was I had to bake a little longer.  Taste was great! Mosit.  Family loved them. Cookies didn't stick, I let cool on cookie sheet for a few mins before removing. I use a stone cookie sheet

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out very nice.  If anything, next time I'll cut the oatmeat back to 2 1/4 cups.  Very good cookie.  Watch the time though!

I tried this recipe earlier today and was a little disappointed. I read the reviews and added more baking soda and flour but they came out runny anyways. Instead of cookies, I made oatmeal raisin bread crumbs. Except for the flour and baking soda I followed all the directions.

These cookies turned out really good. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion to add more flour and baking soda which created a nice consistency. I was trying to use up a large bag of Craisins and used them instead of raisins. They were a hit. No problems with the cookies sticking to the pan either.   I'll certainly make these again but will cut out some of the sugar. In my opinion, they were too sweet.

I am 13 years old and I made these. They turned out perfectly! I love love love this recipe and would recommend it to anyone! :) But, when I took them out of the oven I realized that they hadn't spread out. That wasn't a problem though. They were just pretty small.

don't know what all glowing reviews are here but here's the truth;  cookies come out way to thin, sticking to the cookie sheet terrible, get parchment paper and use it, I use air-bake cookie sheets and had to use a pastry scraper to save the ones I could. thank goodness I didn't use regular..would have gone to the garage for a chisel. taste o.k. but you can't serve them to anyone all broken up like that.

These turned out just the way I wanted! I did end up adding more flour a little sprinkle at a time since the batter seemed too wet. They probably would have been good without the extra flour too. I will add some more cinnamon next time. Overall great!! Thanks for sharing!!

It's the best cookies I've ever had!!! I modified the recipe a little: used only half cup of each type of sugar and added a teaspoon of honey ( as I didn't have vanilla powder) and the cookies came out super delicious! My husband loved it! Thank you for the great recipe!!!!

I'm not sure why others had a problem with this recipe being too runny - I found it perfectly dry enough to stay in mounds when I spooned it out.  I did use the metric measurements so maybe that makes a difference.  Really delicious, just baked them now and waiting for second batch to come out of the oven - a massive hit with the kids.

A little bit sweet but I was able to successfully use Earth Balance in lieu of butter (for my milk allergic son) by scooping out the dough into balls, placing them on a cookie sheet, allowing them to freeze and them baking them.  It kept them from spreading out as badly as they did when I scooped the dough straight from the mixing bowl.

I've always been kind of paranoid when it came to buying already made and packaged food from the store so that's why I make everything from scratch. These cookies were good but not quite as good as the store's, sorry to say. I made a smaller recipe and I soaked the raisins before I put them in the batter which I know should've boosted them up, but the thing is this recipe is a tad bit plain. Maybe next time I'll add a tablespoon of cinnamon or maple syrup along with maybe 1/2 - 1/4 a cup of brown sugar or possibly white depending on my sweet tooth that day.

I used this recipe more for a base for my own. I modified and use about 3 tbls of vanilla, also increased cinnamon to double that which it calls for. I did not have the full 2 3/4 cups of oats (unexpectedly)  so I added some wheat bran about 1/2 cup and also some milled flax seed. They turned out VERY soft and airy. They went over well, my family was eating them right off the pan as soon as they came out.  They did turn out more like a cross between muffin and cookie. I also put my raisins in the microwave with about 1/2 cup of water for about 4 mins, they became soft and plump and were delicious in the mookie (muffin/cookie).

I followed the recipe as it said to do.....with a few additions.  Added some flax seed and some orange zest and juice from the fruit.  They turned out perfect for me! I think the key is to not over work the dough.  Yummy!

Not too bad.  I made 1/2 batch and used 1/2 cup demera sugar and 1/2 cup each of white flour and whole wheat pastry flour.  That was a good amount of flour for them.  Next time I'll add some ground flax too.

I followed the recipe almost to the tee. I did add a little extra baking soda per some of the reviews. The flattened out so much and got soooooo thin! Tasted good though. I "may" try them again some day, but there are so many recipes to try!!

This was a pretty good recipe for chewy oatmeal raisin cookies.  Mine spread out a good bit, but my husband likes his cookies thin so it worked out!

Great recipe! I don't know why everyone else had so much trouble! I basically followed it to the letter--though I'm not the biggest fan of perfect measurements. I think I used a tad bit more brown sugar than called for, definitely more cinnamon, and a few more raisins (just cause i love my raisins). They turned out GORGEOUS and even. No running into each other or anything.   Only problem was that I left them in for 15 minutes, and suspect they could have even gone longer! Maybe it's because I live below sea level (New Orleans) at a super-low elevation...but I think that only works the other way around. Anyway, they're beautiful cookies.  I used Quaker 1-minute oats and had no problem. You can totally use instant oats in this recipe.

When I prepared this recipe, I added 1/2 t. more cinnamon, 1/2 t. ginger, and  because I didn't have enough dark raisins, I fulfilled the raisin requirement by using Golden Raisins. I also rolled the dough into balls and smashed them down with glass dipped in flour and confectioner's sugar.  Nice circular cookies

I think these cookies came out great.  I read that a lot of people had to tweak the recipe, but I made them just as the recipe was written and they came out yummy.  I think I will double up on the cinnamon next time though.

These tasted quite nice but they spread a lot more than I expected and I ended up with one large, thin cookie. I added nutmeg as suggested by others but didn't really like it as an addition.

Like most posters, I made a few tweeks to this recipe. Because the dough was thin, and taking the advise of previous posts, I added 1/4 cup of flour. I also upped the cinnamon to 1 1/4 teaspoons and added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves for added flavor. I soaked the raisins in Rum and increased the amount to 1 3/4 cups.  The first batch were thin cookies, crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. They were uneven shapped and wonkey. So, I lowered the oven to 350.  The remaining batches turned out soft moist and round on the edges.  I did yield aprox 4 dozen. I only give 5 stars to recipes that need no tweeking. These cookies did turn out great. However, there was added work needed to get them that way! Happy Baking!!

Really yummy recipe! I added 1/4 cup extra flour and a 1/4 tsp baking soda, and here's the kicker 1 tsp Chai Tea Marsala. I used Laxmi brand,. It has cardamon, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and of all things black pepper. I better give a bunch of these away or I will be in trouble!

I used 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1.5 tsp of baking soda plus I did the raisin soak and added 1/4 cup of coconut to give it some strength. I also ended up accidentally halfway melting the butter in the microwave but it didn't hurt the recipe. I chose to use a rubber spatula to fold the flour mixture in 3 stages and to mix the oats and raisins into the dough. It saved me overworking the dough and you know what? This recipe with it's alterations proved to work perfectly! Yum!

These were great.  I followed the recipe exactly and made sure not to over stir the dough.  Even though my cookies spread out very thin, they were still chewy and tasty - which is all that matters anyway, right?

I just made these following the exact recipe nd thought they were pretty good, if they would have been chewier I would have given 5 stars! I would however warn about cooking more than 8 minutes, thats how long i cooked them and any longer than that they would have burned!

While they're not as thick as some other oatmeal cookies, I think they're still really good. Everyone I've offered them to has asked for more so they can't be as bad as some of the previous reviews say. 2 thumbs up from me!

This is a wonderful cookie.  I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and a cup of pecans.  Timed them to slightly under cook and they were moist and chewy.  Everyone at work loved them.  This is a keeper.

These cookies came out wonderfully! I'm sorry the last reviewer had a difficult time with them, but I do not think it's the fault of the recipe. I am an experiences baker as well and because I read the previous reviews, I knew to add the additional 1/4 cup flour. I also prefer a spicier cookie, and so added extra cinnamon and a bit of ginger. Yum! I baked these on a stoneware baking sheet, a silpat, and a cookie sheet. They came out best on the stoneware, but only marginally, as the cookies baked on the silpat as well as cookie sheet were also very good. Enjoy!

I used whole wheat flour instead of AP flour. I also cut down on the sugar a but and I definitely didn't miss it. The cookie was still sweet. It was still delicious! Next time I'll try boiling the raisins. :)

These cookies are AMAZING!  I read the reviews and went with the extra 1/4 cup of flour.  I also decided to soak the raisins in warm water before adding to the mix.  This made them just melt right into the cookie.  I also toyed with this recipe by baking first on a round baking stone, then on a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  The parchment paper tended to make them a bit dry, but the baking stone made them absolutely perfect!  I just had to bake them longer for about 13-15 minutes.  I love my oatmeal cookies sweet and chewy and these were definitely my favorite so far!!

Unlike some of the negative reviews I read that the cookies "ran" or were "greasy" or "flat disks", not at all, I thought they were excellent. I was looking for a soft, chewy, flat oatmeal cookie better than the recipe I had been using and these were delicious. I took the suggestion of someone who used a full cup of butter instead of 3/4 and they came out just like I wanted them to, not greasy, just a perfect oatmeal cookie!

These cookies are one of my favorites! I've had some of my creations sit in the kitchen untouched, but these cookies are gone by morning. I've substituted the raisins for cranberries and chocolate and both batches turned great. Next time I do chocolate chip, though, I'm not going to use an entire cup of chips as it turned out to be a little too rich. 3/4 cup might work better. I've used baking sheets, but found that there's enough butter in the cookies to use the recommended ungreased cooking sheet. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These cookie were great.  My husband and son loved them.  I was a little short on the regular oats so I made up for it by adding 2 pouches of cinnamon raisin oatmeal.  That made them delicious1

this recipe was ridiculously disappointing. i can't even eat the cookies because they're plastered to my cookie sheet!  i even added a 1/4 c more of flour and the extra baking soda as stated previously. i was supposed to bake these for a family reunion and now i will be forced to buy store cookies instead.

Unfortunately, I did not read enough of the reviews before I started, I would have added more flour for sure.  As written, for me, this recipe produced flat gooey disks that I tried to salvage using a pizza cutter and spatula, but to no avail.  I was so angry at wasting the cup of raisins, oats, and sugar while getting nothing in return.  The people who had luck make them sound so good too.  I'd add more flour if I were you, but I'm not going to try again on this recipe.  Unless it gets re-written, I know I followed it exactly.

This recipe is perfect just as it is! I just made them and they turned out soooo good! For those that have issues with the cookies sticking, this might help - I line my cookie sheet with aluminum foil and spray that with non-stick cooking spray. The cookies don't stick at all! This is a great recipe and I will definitely be making these again.

For a novice baker, these were easy to make and taste great.  I did lower the temperature of the oven due to the cookies browning too fast, but that was the only thing that I changed.

These were yummy! I cut the white and brown sugar to 1/2 c. and the cookies tasted perfect- not too sweet, not too bland! I love spices so I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg as well. I also reduced the oven temp. to 350, which was perfect for 8-10 minutes of baking. I flattened the cookies 4 minutes into baking with a spatula to make them look a little better. After I tried a cookie I realized something was missing- walnuts! A cup of chopped walnuts would make this recipe even better.

I don't know what the people who said that these were dry were talking about.  I have made these about 4 times and I followed the recipe exactly (except I used vegetable shortening instead of butter)... these cookies were amazing!  The last time I made them, I used mini-chocolate chips instead of raisins and in a word "HEAVEN!"

I had to add A LOT more rasins and extra flour. 
I also was using Splenda and had to add some applesauce to give a "brownsugary" taste to the mix.
They turned out okay, but not impressive, which makes me a little sad since I was baking to impress for a Relief Society party tonight.

I have made these cookies several times now. The family and I love them. Instead of using raisins, I use cranberries. The only thing about them, they are very thin. I will continue to use this recipe.  

Thanks

Very good cookie and true to the original recipe, it made forty. It was, however, a little on the thin side and so it required very much watching while in the oven so they didn't burn. It just needed some more body, and maybe something besides butter would do that. After all, we aren't paula dean, are we.

I made this exactly to the recipe. My cookies came out flat, thin, crispy on the edges, slightly chewy, very buttery. This was exactly what I wanted, I like this better than a cakey cookie. One thing that helped was baking on parchment paper so they could really form up and cool thoroughly without disturbing them. I just pulled the whole sheet of parchement paper off the sheet and set it on a wire rack to cool. 

Yummy! They didn't last long!

I think this is a pretty good recipe.  For those in the UK who use gas, I baked mine at gas mark 5 for anywhere between 7-10 minutes.  My first batch was a bit pale looking and fell apart when I tried to remove them.  The next batch I baked almost 10 mins (peeking at them at 5 mins) and they were much better.  I let mine get to a golden brown, instead of just brown around the edges.  I'm not much of a baker and this was easy and pretty much hassle free.

Awesome Recipe! I added almost 1/4 cup of additional flour. The cookies really are delicious. Crispy outside, chewy inside. I also added dark chocolate chips to a couple of batches. Yummo!

The flavor is fantastic, but my cookies came out very flat even after taking special care not to overwork the batter.  I had to add a couple minutes to the baking time because at ten minutes they were still very mushy.  Leaving them in for 12 minutes gave me a very moist, chewy cookie that fell apart easily.  Leaving them in for 14 minutes gave me a pancake-flat, crunchy version.  Either way, they taste very very good and both the chewy and crunchy versions got rave reviews at my house.

Loved these cookies! I cut the sugar because hubby doesn't like things sweet, and honestly, they don't need that much sugar. I did, however put in chocolate chips because I had them and not raisins. Loved it! will make again.

I added a load more cinnamon, and some allspice. Also, I soaked the raisins for a while. Dip them in milk as soon as they come out (Hiyaaaa!!), and eat. The mixture is also delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly and it tastes great and was strait forward to make. It only made about 30 small cookies (not the 48 that it said it would). I recommend flattening cookies while the dough is in your hands instead of pressing them down on the sheet. Mine did not stick at all as other people had mentioned.

I added more cinnamon- 1 1/4 t. I usually like cookies baked at 350. These turned out pretty good for higher heat.

Great recipe! I am a disaster with any cooking that involves ovens, but I felt like making cookies today. Halfway through the whole mixing process, I realized I didn't have raisins or baking soda, but I went ahead anyway. I substituted a little jam on the top of each one for raisins, and did without the baking soda, and they came out great! I also added sesame seeds for color (the black ones), and substituted some of the sugar for honey.

I misread the recipe and instead of teaspoonfuls, dropped tablespoonfuls of dough onto the cookie sheet then wondered why they were taking forever to cook! So don't make the same mistake I did. :) The teaspoonfuls came out perfectly at about 13 minutes. These taste amazing...I don't think I'll ever go back to store bought oatmeal raisin cookies! I did add extra cinnamon and I think this gave the cookie added flavor and made the house smell like Christmas!

The cookies tasted great, but spread too much and turned out flat. Perhaps it calls for too much butter? Next time I try I will cut the butter to 1/2 a cup.

Simply delicious!  I have made it many many times. All my friends and my family members loveed it.  To make the cookies  healthier, I used whole wheat flour and reduced the sugar total down to 3/4  cup. By the way, I used nonhydogenated butter, that is, butter made from vegetable oil so that there is no trans fat nor cholestrol. It still tasted wonderful. Thank you so much!

Alright, I'm no expert but one thing I can make is cookies and these were anything but amazing-I lessened the sugar and soaked the raisins and they turned out cake-y and crumbly. I also found there were just too many raisins and not enough flavour. Choose another recipe!

These are sooooooooooo good, I don't even like rasins. My brother made them for a friend one day and i had some and loved them, can't get enough. If you really don't like raisins this recipe is also good if you substitute chocolate chips for rasins. Great both ways!!!

The cookies come out very tasty.  However, the butter melts pretty quickly, which flattens them out.  Make sure to leave enough room between each cookie.

What a great cookie. I have a cookie jar on my desk at work. I make cookies each week for the jar. And the rave reviews I received from the people at work were amazing. Make them and you will see what I'm talking about.

cookies taste ok, not as moist and chewy as I hoped for. I used old fashioned rolled oats, I think if I try it again I will use quick oats.

This was the first time baking the cookies, and I followed the instructions but scaled it down for just a dozen cookies. At first when mixing it was too dry, and I poured a little warm water, to moisten it up. It was just fantastic. I put in in the oven for about 12 mins, and it was crunchy on the outside and a little soft on the inside. My husband absolutely loved them! He said,"why buy oatmeal cookies when you can bake them??" thanks for a great recipe. Really tried and true...even if it's your first time baking! :)

These cookies came out delicious. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of a middle eastern spice called Baharat. It really gave it an extra spice kick.

Wonderful cookies.  My 2 year old "helped"--very easy to make.  I cut the sugar down a little bit, and added more cinnamon.  Use something to lift off the cookie sheet as they will fall apart.  But once on the cooling rack, they crisp up very nicely and the middles are soft.  House smells great!

This recipe is great, although I might leave out the cinnamon next time. It's just me I guess because everytime I put cinnamon into cookies, it seems to taste a bit weird...and I like cinnamon!...kind of odd. I also cut down the sugar, as I do for all recipes on this site. Otherwise, this is great! Thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe.  It was so easy and all the ingredients are things you have in your pantry.  I boiled the raisins for a couple minutes, and instead of just regular cinnamon, I add the Pampered Chefs cinnamon plus.  They were a huge hit and they only lasted a couple hours.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the most awesome oatmeal cookie that I have ever eaten. It taste just as good as the cookies from my favorite bakery and what makes it even better is that I made it myself. I burned them because I wasn't watching them closely but even the burned cookies were better than my former recipe at it its best. Thanks for sharing

Very good - has just the right amount of cinnamon.
Although, since I didn't grease the sheets, some cookies broke when I tried to transfer them.
When I did when they got right out of the oven, they were too soft, so some  broke too. 
But overall, it's all nice.

These cookies came together very easily and looked delicious.  But taste?  A little on the bland side.  I'm not sure what I might have done differently but I don't think I'll make them again.

Mmmm - these cookies are good!  I rated them 4 stars because the next time I make them (and there will be a next time), I will reduce the amount of white sugar to 1/2 cup (we found them a bit too sweet) and increase the raisins by an additional 1/4 - 1/2 cup.  The only change I made to the recipe was to soak the raisins in the egg and vanilla for an hour or so...this plumps the raisins up and makes them nice and soft (yet still chewy).

A Big hit, although I thought they were a little on the sweet side, I took the suggestion to make it one teaspoon of cinnomon and half of nutmeg which made them perfectly spiced

Chewy, delicious goodness that is so easy to make! I substituted 1/4 cup of the flour with oats for extra crunch! The cookies might need some additional monitoring during baking depending on your oven.

Seems like a love/hate kinda cookie.  Mine turned out overly bland and crunchy.  I even added a dash of clove on someones recommendation, and it still seemed bland.

Very good cookies! I added just a pinch of nutmeg for warmth. The only complaint I have is that mine stuck to the cookie sheet (but I used margarine rather than butter) so make sure you grease the sheet if you do not use real butter.

This recipe was FABULOUS!!!  Nice and soft and so tasty!!  I made them for a work function and everyone gobbled them up!!  I wish I would have soaked the raisins like some other people noted, I will try that next time.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe and it turned out SO good!

I made thses with whole wheat flour, all brown sugar and some mini chocolate chips instead of raisins [just because I didn't have any.] They were STILL fabulous. They were so "healthy" that I ate them ALL myself. [Well, almost.] I feel better already!

Delicious and quick recipe! I did find that at the recommended baking time, the cookies were still very soft and fragile. I baked the cookies for about 15 minutes total.

I think these cookies were fabulous! Mine had a nice raise to them and were nice and chewy. I did add 1/2 tsp. of baking powder and I soaked my raisins and added a 1/2 tsp. ground cloves along with the cinnamon. These will be added to our family favorites!

These may not have been the best I've ever tasted but when you take into account the ease of making them you'll see why they warrant the full 5 stars.  They taste great, very cripy at the ends while chewy & moist in the center.  The only mods I made to the recipe was double the raisins, cinnamon, and vanilla.  The batter tasted almost as good as the cookies!  Will look forward to making again.

Great oatmeal cookie just like i remember as a kid. A few comments depending on the weather, humidity etc. the amount of flour  can need to be increased. This is a normal problem that is why most chefs and in europe flour is done by weight not buy measure try to tell a european what a cup is and you will get a very funny look.

I got a new cookie for the holidays now!  This was so good and it's not to sweet.  I added 1 1/2 cups of raisin instead of one.  It was so delicious and my house smelt good too.  Thanks!

I've been searching a long time for the perfect Oatmeal-Raisin cookie...I'm pretty sure this is it. I used bread flour instead of AP; I like the texture better. I got 17 4" cookies from the batch.

I have tried MANY other oatmeal raisin recipes but this one has the best flavor(I added a pinch more cinnamon).  They did harden a little the next day, all I had to do was close them up tight so as not to get dried out and they were fine.  Thanks!!

I don't typically like oatmeal raisin cookies, so I didn't think temptation would get the best of me with this recipe.  I was wrong!  They were delicious, and were a hit among my coworkers and family.  This is one of the best cookie recipes I've had!

I am not a big oatmeal cookie fan in general, but the rest of my family is, so I made this recipe exactly as written, with one exception. Instead of making the cookies with teaspoonsful of dough, I used a slightly overflowing tablespoonsful, and then I cooked them for one or two minutes more. My husband declared them delicious and my kids all scarfed down their allotment in minutes. Thank you!

What a nice cookie! Everyone who tasted them, loved them. I did add a hand full of chopped walnuts and an extra 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. They have an "interesting" appearence. But its chewy goodness outweighs its looks by a long shot.

These are very addictive and tasty oatmeal cookies and the first we've ever made at home! My daughter and her friends made them for her little End-of-School party. Instead of vanilla extract, they used just some vanilla beans and it was still tasty. They also added some pumpkin pie spice which contains cinnamon, nutmeg, and other spices. We used light margarine because we had no butter so it might of made it healthier. They smelled so good when they came out but the girls made a huge deformed cookie instead of individual. The edges of the big cookie were crispy but the rest were chewy and cake-like. Delicious! Will make again.

they did not have the consistancy of a traditional oatmeal raison cookie. Infact, I thought it was more like a regular cookie with raisins.

This recipe is very good. Makes lots of chewy cookies. Next time though I will use a little less salt. I think I over measured. Overall an excellent cookie.I also reduced my temp but I oven tends to burn everything if over 350.

Very soft and tasty.  I used only one brick of margarine and 1/4 canola oil, though I wasn't sure if that made it a little healthier, but these are my favorite oatmeal cookies ever.  After I baked half the batch, I put in a little over a cup of chocolate chips to the rest of the batter and they came out soooo good!

This recipe was fantastic! I am sort of a new baker (being as I am only 19) but I traded the raisins for dryed apples. It turned out really well and has a sort of apple pieish taste. Yummy. I also didn't have a full 3/4 cup butter so I used 1/2 C. Butter and 1/4 C. Margarine.

My husband has always wanted me to bake these cookies for him, but i was reluctant. I'd never really baked much before, so before he had to leave for sea (he's in the navy) i baked a good sized batch for him, and they were gone within 2 days. They were the yummiest cookies EVER! My 11 month old baby girl especially liked them. Thanks for the great recipe! We LOVED them!!

Yum! I just pulled a half batch of these out of the oven. They flattened out and are crispy on the bottom (after baking for 9 minutes) but are soft in the middle. A perfect oatmeal-raisin cookie. Thanks Darlene!

the cookies smell great and taste good too, but my dont flatten when they cook and the middle never gets all the way baked. I did one minor adjustment to it that may effect it, I took the butter and melted it so i didnt have to kill my hard tring to mix the sugars all the way.

very very good taste =P they were a little TOO soft for me unlike some of the other reviews... i think it might have been my oven though- we had to keep sticking the cookies back into the oven until they firmed up. these cookies aren't too pretty either but the taste makes up for it... YUM

Took advice of other reviewers and these were GREAT.  I made them with golden raisin and will now always use them.  You can also freeze leftover cookie dough for another time.

Chewy and delicious!!!! My two year old had a fit when I wouldn't let him have anymore, and he's picky!!!  Mine turned out a little flat, but my oven is ancient (original in house when it was built in 1955).  Very good!!! Will make again when I get new oven.:)

These are some of the best cookies I have ever made.  They were super easy to make, the taste is amazing, and they cook perfectly.  My cookies didn't go flat, and they didn't burn.  They are not too soft, not to crunchy.  This is the easiest recipe and it produces some of the greatest cookies I've ever tasted.  Thank you!

very easy to make , when cooking found it is easier to remove cookies when hot, in stead of letting cool.

These cookies are really quite good.  I doubled the amount of raisins (to 2 cups) and added 1 cup of shredded coconut.  My 6 year old and 3 year old give them two thumbs up.  I would definitely make these cookies again.

These cookies are delicious! I used whole wheat flour instead of white and they still tasted great... and maybe a little more filling.
