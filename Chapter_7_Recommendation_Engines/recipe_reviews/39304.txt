At the farmer's market I bought a basket of very small baby patty pans, 1-2 inches across, some the pale green, some bright yellow, and some the dark green.  Obviously I couldn't stuff them so I cut them in half horizontally and layered the rest of the ingredients on top in a casserole dish.  Baked for the same amount of time and OH MY GOODNESS...it was soooooo good.  I did sprinkle the top with a bit of extra parmesan to give it a nice browned topping.  EXCELLENT.  I think this would work no matter the size, the large ones would serve more than one person.  I love the tender tiny ones.

This was incredible. Everyone in the family loved it. One thing though. Next time I don't think I'll saute the onion in the bacon drippings but olive or some other unsaturated oil instead. I don't think that would hurt the dish. My arteries are begging for mercy!

I made this recipe for just me using one squash! It was a great lunch. The only changes I made was to use a little provolone cheese as well as parmesan, added fresh basil and oregano and used panko bread crumbs. Cooked it in my toaster oven and it was delicious!

This was excellent. My husband is not a big squash fan and he loved this. It was perfect as a side dish or a main dish for a simple lunch. Very tasty. I did cut back a bit on the amount of breadcrumbs used.

The recipe looks fantastic, but I'd like to know how big the squashes are &  how much mixture this recipe makes: 1 cup, 2 cups, etc. Also, the squashes pictured are NOT considered pattypans in my area; the little tag that comes with the plant called mine pattypan squash, but are very large - up to 6" to 8" across, greenish-white and have scalloped edges & no green "turban" on top.  So, I am not sure how much mixture to make. Thanks for your help! :)

These were delightful in every way!  I'd never cooked pattypan squash and had actually bought them having no idea what I was doing and they turned out great!  I did forget to add the parmesan but instead dusted a little on the top of each squash and they looked so pretty!  I also added a clove of minced garlic; definitely will make again thanks!!!

VERY YUMMY!!  And they are so cute!  My husband made this and he cut back on the amount of breadcrumbs, but I think I would have wanted more in there.  We also only had colby-jack cheese so we put that in there, though I wished there was more cheese - I LOVE cheese.  I would have added more.  This is like nothing I have tasted before.  An excellent use of the patty pan squash!  We will be making this every summer with our patty pan squash!  THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!

Very good.  I added some fresh oregano and extra cheese to the bread mixture.  Also baked it longer than the instructions called for.  Excellent low calorie meal with a side salad.

My man made this for me, along with 'Mediterranean rice' recipe from the BBC Food website. The meal was absolutely delicious. 
It was even great as leftovers for lunch the next day!

A co-worker of mine gets veggies from a CSA and when this "weird squash thing" (her words, not mine) popped up in her basket she gave it to me, knowing I love squash.  I had no idea what it was either, so after determining it was a pattypan squash, I turned to Allrecipes and found this!  It's uh-mazing.  I think I cooked my squash a bit too long, as the skins were falling apart when I scooped out the middle, but it was still a mighty tasty dish.  I only had two squash, so I pared down the recipe accordingly.  I brought the second to work for a reheated lunch and got oohs and ahs from co-workers about my cooking skills.  If they only knew how easy it was - ha!  I will be hunting down other CSA'ers in hopes that I will procure more of these tasty little squash.  Hee hee!  The only change I made besides the measurements was that I used turkey bacon.  Top-notch recipe - thanks for posting!!

Delicious!  We have recently joined a CSA and since we don't eat a lot of zucchini we were looking for recipes to use with it.  I first tried this with two small pattypan squash, and it turned out beautifully.  Tonight I cooked a big yellow summer squash by boiling it whole for 10 minutes, sliced it in half lengthwise, scooped out the middle and proceeded like I did with the pattypans.  I think the long squash was easier to work with, but the results were very similar.  Any summer squash/zucchini would work fine.  I increased the bacon a little since it is JUST SO GOOD, sprinkled a little extra parm on top and drizzled with a tiny bit of olive oil before baking, to brown it.  YUM!!!

I had an abundance of pattypan in my garden and a group of friends coming over for dinner, so I thought I would give this a try.  One of my friends has a wheat allergy, so I substituted the bread crumbs for cooked jasmin rice.  I also added fresh chopped parsley, basil and chives.  I saved the sliced off tops and put them back on the squash before baking like little hats. It was delish, easy to make, and a huge hit!

I use all sorts of stuff for stuffing... But I give the squash an ice bath and cook it a tad less then fork tender. I also use both green and yellow...the color is much better with a cold bath...

I was seriously disappointed. My squash was gross from the beginning though, after steaming the 4" white squash, the insides were snotty slimy. Kept the firmer flesh to be chopped into the filling & rest of the snot & seeds were destined for the garbage disposal. The filling was DELICIOUS except for being overly salty. I added a half tsp of sea salt which was a huge mistake - I should have tasted the mixture 1st, but I had only used half the bacon! But it was still really salty once combined with the cheese (I used 1/4 c of parmesan blend that includes romano & asiago cheeses as well). After seeing how slimy & wet the insides of the squash was, I only used half of the soft bread crumbs I had ready & used nice dry panko for the rest. It did the trick & the squash was NOT slimy after baking at least. I also shredded in a handful of spinach leaves and chopped some sun dried tomatoes & threw in for some color and flavor depth and it was soooo good. The squash on the other hand was a flavorless wet mush on the outside of a really tasty stuffing (maybe it should have been basted in garlic oil then roasted or cooked in chicken broth prior to stuffing instead of steaming it??)

I did not like this at all ... it was bland, dry ... looked pretty on the plate, but beyond that ... I'm surprised so many people have rated this so highly, although I have noticed that a lot of the great reviews involve changes to the actual recipe, which is what I used ....

This recipe was the basis for a wonderful dinner for my husband and me.  I had a large (6") patty pan from my garden.  Rather than boil it, hubby sliced it into two rounds, and used an ice cream scoop to remove the seeds and most of the flesh so about 1/2" was left as a bowl.  I chopped the removed squash and set it aside.  

Then I heated a Tbsp of olive oil in a skillet, added some Kirkland bacon bits, a small chopped red onion and a minced garlic clove.  When the onion was transparent, I added the chopped squash and sauteed a bit longer.  

I mixed in Panko bread crumbs (instead of fresh), some basil, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and 1/2 cup shredded Mozzarella. I put the squash halves in a baking dish sprayed with non-stick spray, added the stuffing, and sprinkled a bit more cheese on top.  Covered with foil, and baked at 350 for about 45 minutes, until the squash was tender when pierced with a fork.  

Meanwhile, I heated about 1 cup of Stephanie's Freezer Spaghetti Sauce from this site, which I spooned over the baked stuffed squash.  Served with fresh corn on the cob.  Amazing Dinner!!

Like others I added garlic, basil, oregano and less panko crumbs (1 cup).  It was delicious! No blandness in this dish.  We eat it as a main course. My only suggestion refers to the size of the squash. If they are large, they require longer boiling and longer baking.

I can appreciate the creativity of this dish, but it did not work for me.  Although the dish looks pretty and appetizing after it is made, it tastes so dry.  The bread crumbs, bacon, parmesan all made me thirsty and had almost no flavor when combined with one another.  You can taste the individual parts, but they just don't work well together in this dish.

This is a great way to serve pattypan squash! The flavor of the stuffing is phenomenal and comforting, as well as a great compliment to the squash itself. Fast and easy, with great results! Thanks for the recipe! :)

I used on larger squash (5-6 in) and prepared the stuffing for 3 servings.  I did saute the onion in the maple smoked bacon drippings (omg good) adding a little prepared mustard ( 1/2 tsp or so ) and added a blend of Italian seasoning to the panko bread crumbs I used.  I baked it for 35 minutes due to the size of the squash.  Yummy and really quite easy.

This is really easy to make and very delicious.  I used Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs and didn't use any salt or pepper.  

Sometimes I skip the bacon and use leftover chopped meatballs or other cooked meat that I have in the fridge.  Chopped fresh basil mixed into the stuffing at the end is nice, too.

This is one of my favorite fast and easy meals!

So tasty! I only made one small change. I added shredded mixed cheese to mixture. I will note that I used a 3 inch wide patty pan and I cooked it for only 5 min in the water, then 20 in the oven. My squash did not turn out mushy at all this way. As far as portions for 1 squash...I used 2 tbsp of onions, 1 slice bacon, 1 tbsp breadcrumbs, abt 1/4 c shredded cheese, about 1 tbsp parmesan and it looked like about 2tbs of the scooped out squash. Oh, I did put in a pinch of minced garlic, pinch of salt & pepper. This was perfect for 1 serving. It was delicious!

This is a keeper. I got pattypan squash in my CSA box and had no idea what to do with it. Ive used bacon bits from the fridge and sauted with some olive oil and used real bacon and both turned out great. Im not great at stuffing things though so I cut them enough so they lay flat and dolloped the bread mixture on top.

This recipe tasted pretty good, but it took almost two hours to make, start to finish. As others have said, I added garlic and fresh basil and substituted Panko breadcrumbs.  In my opinion it was not worth the effort.

My family loved them. Easy recipe! I used 3 very large patty pan squash.  Needed more stuffing, added more bread and cut out more of the inside of squash to add to stuffing, I usually don't measure exactly, I just add ingredients as I go and guess. hee hee! I believe I used more parmesan too. I baked them for 45 minutes as every oven is a little bit different. I will make again!

First time trying pattypan squash. 
Scalled it down to serve only 2. 
Next time I'll add more bacon or maybe sausage.

5 stars for flavor 4 stars for the technical difficulties.  The outcome was delicious, I just wish there was some way to tell the amount of squash to use by weight or size.  I used three fairly large patty pans (about 5 inches across) and ran out of stuffing before the third one was full.  Also the prep and cooking times are a bit longer than the recipe indicates.  Still the flavor was great and I would make this again!

Very tasty.  I had some trouble gutting the squash without splitting the sides, but they still held together pretty well.  I used sausage crumbles instead of bacon, and it was super tasty.  I also used mozzarella instead of Parmesan. Also, make sure you spray just a bit of cooking spray on the bottom of your baking dish to get the squashes off easier if you use mozzarella!

This has become one of our regular dinners in the summer.  We often tweak the recipe depending on what meat is available at our farmers market.  I've substituted sausage, ground beef, bison, goat, and even mushrooms for the bacon.  All have turned out yummy!

Made this with the addition of blue cheese, fresh basil & bell pepper and used panko instead of bread crumbs & was it good! Boil em til they're good n soft, 10 minutes wasn't nearly long enough for me.

Delicious, but with some time adjustments. The prep time can not be correct, nor the bake time. It took me 15-20 minutes to scoop out 3 squash. Next time I will steam the squash upside down and bake for 30 mins. I did take the suggestions to add basil and oregano and pepperjack and sub panko for the bread crumbs, since I had all on hand. Also added a dash of ancho chile powder. I will definitely make again.

Tried this recipe just as it's written, altered for 4 servings. The kids loved it, I loved it, and none of us love squash. When I make it again, I'll use some fresh herbs to give it a bit more flavor, but it really was fantastic.

This was great!  It exceeded my expectations.  I was a little confused when the recipe called for me to have stem removed and then told me to remove the stem in the directions, but I just left them on and removed them after cooking.  I did use reduced fat colbyjack and parmesan, and it was wonderful!

I used 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, and put slice mozzerella on top. I also got rid of about 1/4 of the squash innerds and still had more than enough to stuff the shells. VERY GOOD!

I love this recipe - it's one of my summer staples once the squash plants in the garden take off.  I did notice that as written, the stuffing is very dry, so before stuffing the squash I add about a cup of chicken broth.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were delicious!  I used cubed, pan-fried potatoes instead of bread crumbs and sausage instead of bacon.  We made five huge stuffed pattypan squash with this recipe.  They had to boil a little longer and then bake longer too, but it was a great use of overgrown pattypans from the garden!

This recipe was bursting with flavor! I actually used meatless bacon since we are vegetarians, but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely look forward to pattypan being in season again next year!

These were such a nice change of pace for the bounty of patty pan we have had this year! I hate to be one of those that says, "It was great/not so great, but this is what I changed", but the only change I made was using Kirkland bacon bits instead of frying up bacon. I love how they are "all meat" and not fatty at all. The whole family enjoyed them and my husband asked for them again the next day. I also had to share on FB for my other gardening friends.

What a great dish! I made these for dinner tonight served with a big garden salad. I had very tiny pattypans, so i just halved them after boiling and served them like mushroom caps (like another reviewer suggested). 

the changes i made: made them gluten free by using TJ's ryeless rye bread - put into the food processor with fresh dill. used diced pancetta and american cheese (all that i had, but was delicious) and added some ground mustard seed. 

mmmmm! my boyfriend liked them - i think even more than i did :)

I just made this for dinner and it is fabulous.  It was a hit with my family.  I added fresh oregano, basil and garlic for a more Italian taste and served it with spaghetti sauce with sausage. Yummy!

I also used the stuffing for zucchini and yellow crookneck squash and they turned out great.

The recipe did not work out for me at all. I was so excited for it and was very disappointed. Perhaps the patty pan squash I bough were too big...but also the stuffing had a weird taste to it and I did follow the recipe completely.

I was looking for a recipe with sausage in it, so I replaced the bacon with 1lb Italian sausage.  I also did not add the scooped squash back in because it wasn't going to fit - instead I added water for the bread crumbs.  It was just what I wanted and everyone loved it.  My picky 3 year old even ate it.

My husband loved this!! My kids were not as big a fan, but they are not used to eating squash.  I am a big believer in putting new foods in front of them a few times before they learn to appreciate the taste.  Will definately try again!  I used three small pattypan squash and one large pattypan squash which seemed to work with the ingredient amounts listed.

Excellent! I'm a vegetarian so I used a small amount of olive oil and added olives and tomatoes to the filling. My husband loved this recipe too, and he is a carnivore. Squash turned out tender, tasty and pretty. I will make this again since I have an abundance of patty pan squash from my garden. Thank you for sharing!

Wow, I was very impressed by how easy and delicious this recipe was. I also added some little cherry tomatoes from the garden, which added a nice flavor and some color. Beautiful dish!

Delicious!  I added some mushrooms to the stuffing (since i had some that needed to be used).  It was very, very good.  We had really large pattypan squash, so we just scooped out the center of each and filled it with the stuffing.  It turned out great!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for this recipe!

It was ok.  I used another separate squash in order to create more filling.  I added the Parmesan on top.  It was more work than I expected.  All of the bacon grease gets soaked up in the stuffing mixture.

wonderful.  Son loved the stuffing and he ate the pattypan.  Our pattypans were white and pretty big and they were sweet and tasty.  I am going to plant pattypan next year just so I can make it more.  I did add more cheese

I followed the method but changed the recipe up.  I stuffed the insides with the chopped squash, breadcrumbs, and cheddar cheese.   At my grocery store the little yellow ones are called "sunburst squash" and the green are called "pattypan."  I don't know if there was something wrong with my squash but they tasted way bitter.

I only had 2 squash so changed the serving size, but still used twice the (turkey)bacon & cheese. I always have a difficult time refilling these squash, so i scrape out the seeds and make a hash out of it. I cook the bacon, then onion, and then add the squash and cheese. It was SO good it was devoured in minutes. There was none left!

I thought this was very good.  My husband only ate one-half of one.  I would make it again but use smaller patty pans.  Not real small.  Just medium size.

I used leftover herb bread for the bread crumbs and leftover ham instead of bacon. It was good but a lot of trouble to stuff the little squashes. I might make it again if I happen upon more pattypan squash.

Did not need to boil the squash as long as required.  Could use any kind of meat or protein. I added some hot peppers to the stuffing.

I made it with chorizo instead of bac on. However, the author of this recipe didn't mention deseeding as said in the pattypan with chorizo.  We grew pattypan this year in our garden. Pattypan is full of seeds.  Not much pulp to use on the recipe so it would behoove someone to use cooked squash from another type of squash to add to the filling.  It was dry so we added some liquid.  Also, the cooking time for the squash itself needs to be longer.  I think that the squash could be cooked in the microwave instead of boiling it do death.  The taste of the filling was OK without  much cooked squash in it.

I added a touch of oregano, rosemary, and garlic to the stuffing which picked it a notch. Broiled it a couple minutes at the end just to crisp the stuffing a little and topped it with parmigiano, black pepper, and paprika then melted the cheese under the broiler.  Big hit and will make it again. Will add crawfish and crab meat next time and may add some water chestnuts for a little crunch.

I used 1 cup of bread crumbs, substituted the bacon for Italian sausage ( which I just had lying around), and  added 1 crushed garlic clove to the filling. I liked it but I did have to change a lot about the recipe so that is why I didn't  give it 5 stars.

I am Gluten free and didnt notice bread in recipe until I decided to make it.  I had never cooked PP squash but grew it this year.  My first issue was size..some were about 6" across not minis.   I got center cut bacon from a local butcher and it is lean so not alot of fat ( mostly water) , so I uped to 10 slices and did saute onions with bacon.  Not reading closely I added 4 cloves of garlic...doesnt garlic always go with onions?  :). I then added 3 cups of cooked jasmine rice.  Now, my squash..I had to seed out large seeds but I was afraid of cutting skin of squash if I scooped out much flesh to add to my rice mixture.  In place, I added corn..I only had frozen but the extra moisture helped the rice mixture.  Added the cheese...was temped to add toms but decided NO I wanted a non tomato based squash.  So glad I didnt add toms...just salt and pepper.  My PP squash took about 1/2 c per larger squash and 1/4 cup smaller squash.  It was surprisingly delish!  I did drizzle  1/4 tsp walnut oil to each stuffed squash because I wasnt sure if rice would dry out...only used walnut because I was out of olive oil but it did add a little sweetness, like a little kick.  I am not a fan of GF breads but the rice was great.

The recipe looks and sounds really delicious. I had a number of squash in different sizes from the garden. Once they were fork tender, all went downhill fast. If I do this again, I think an ice bath would work great to cool off the squash. The squash were too soft & too hot to handle. I had many seeds, that I was trying to pull out of them, as the flesh was disappearing. The squash ultimately fell apart and were a big mess. I had bacon cooked & onion in the skillet, so I turned this mess into a pasta dinner. I added back to the pan what I salvaged, some white wine, chicken stock, parsley, and garlic. It was edible. My husband said it wasn't the best thing I ever made, but it was good. I like the idea of the horizontal slice, and may try that next time. I also think I will under cook the squash, so it is not as soft. This may be operator error, but the seeds were not addressed in the original recipe.

This recipe appeared to have potential. However when I made it, the stuffing turned out very dry and the squash was al dente. I wish I had taken the advice of other reviewers and added liquid.

I made a version of this today for a potluck using a pattypan measuring about 8inches across. I used a combination of gluten free bread and quinoa. I pulsed together in the food processor onions, mushrooms,red pepper, asparagus,zucchini, and sautéed in a little coconut oil. It was delicious. (I couldn't rotate my photo.) I will make this again.

This looks good and tastes good, but I'm giving it 3 stars because of the length of time it takes to prepare it.    Much to long.   Took to much time to scoop out the meat and it was difficult getting rid of all the seeds.    You really wouldn't want to leave them in it as they are tough.

The stuffing was good, but I personally just think nothing can make summer squash taste good. The stuffing was flavorful, but with a mouthful of the squash bowl it was watery-tasting. To me, there are too many other good summer vegetables to waste time on summer squashes. I'll wait for the fall ones!

Amazing! The best way I've ever had squash prepared. The bacon and cheese really make this 5 stars for flavor.

It was okay - thought the kids would gobble this up but one didn't care for it and it was just so-so for the other. Probably wouldn't make again as it was a little time consuming for an okay meal.

We didn't care for this recipe as written. I'm not sure if I will try this again because it was time consuming to make.

My husband and I weren't very happy with the taste or how long it took to make. We didn't really care for the texture or the combination of the stuffing. I might try it again just to see if I can tweak it.

Pretty yummy!  This the first year for pattypans in my garden so I was really looking for a way to cook them.  This was great, but I think I am going to keep tinkering to find additional ways to prepare.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are awesome little things.  :o)  I'd never had pattypan squash, but they looked so cute at the farmer's market I had to try.  Bf said this recipe reminded him of stuffed mushrooms.  Maybe so, but I definitely prefer the squash to the mushroom base!  The squash is tender and sweet and the stuffing is salty.  Perfect combo!  Thanks for the recipe!

We only had 2 pattypans from our CSA, so the scaled the recipe down.  We didn't have turkey bacon.  Instead I chopped a couple of tablespoons of leftover shitake mushroom stems, used italian breadcrumbs and about 1/8 tsp each of the following: Basil, parsley, minced garlic, minced onion, and oregano.  

Other than that, followed the cooking directions and came out beautifully with an added kick!

This dish is excellent! Since I'm unfamiliar with pattypan squash and had trouble finding it at the grocery store, I stuck with yellow squash and it turned out great. I boiled 2 10" squashes in enough boiling water for them to float freely in and made sure to turn them so they would cook evenly. I shaved off a side lengthwise to hollow them out, and then followed the rest of the recipe loosely. With the combination of bacon, onion, breadcrumbs, and cheese, you can't go wrong! I did cut down on the breadcrumbs to have a more balanced stuffing. After about 12-14 minutes, a single squash was a hearty side dish to split for two, and was a nice change from the usual potatoes we have on the side. Great recipe!

Made this at Thanksgiving last year and the folks really enjoyed it. They're even better as leftovers. I love yellow squash and am always looking for alternative ways to cook it.

Thanks for the great recipe.

There were great! I used a little less bacon than called for to cut down on fat and sodium. A great recipe with wonderful flavor.

What a great way to use up a whole bunch of pattypans.  I used "fakin bakin" instead of real bacon and it turned out really well.  I had to cook the squash a little longer than recommended to scoop the insides out properly.

I had not had pattypan before.  This method of cooking was ok, even for my picky daughter!  THanks!
