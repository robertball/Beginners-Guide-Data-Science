I used Trader Joe's kosher split turkey breast and so cut this recipe to 3 servings.  The turkey only sat in the brine in a freezer bag for 4 1/2 hours in the fridge, and when I put it in the oven for just a little less than 2 hours at 350 degrees, I didn't do a single thing to the meat.  It turned out just great!  I froze the bones from this and will do one more at least before Thanksgiving because I think this will give me the very best turkey stock for gravy on the Big T-Day!  I highly suggest that people try this because it was extremely tasty.  Thanks so very much, Henry!  Excellent!

This was the first year I brined a turkey! This was so good!! The only thing I left out was the savory, I didn't have any in the pantry and the market was out! I left mine in the bucket overnight in our very chilly basement! This was a great recipe :)

I have tried many turkey brines over the past few years but nothing can compare to this recipe. Most of the brines I have tried are sweet. This one is savory. It enhances the flavor of the turkey instead of masking it with sugar.
This is now my go-to recipe for roast turkey!

The breast should be cooked to 165 F and the thigh 175. I believe the author of this recipe should check USDA recommendation for safe cooking temp.

Nice Balanced flavors!  I made a small modification in the technique.  In a quart of the water, I dissolved the salt and added the spices and brought it to a boil then simmered for 5 minutes to open up the flavors more.  Then in a large brining container, poured the cooled spices over half of a 7.5 pound bag of ice (approximately a gallon of water).  Adding the bird, I then mixed in more ice to keep it cool.

I had never brined a turkey before but this was absolutely wonderful. It was moist and very flavorful. I simmered just enough water (4-6 cups) to dissolve the salt and to release the flavors of the spices, allowed to cool for about an hour then added ice to quick chill the brine, immersed the turkey into the brine adding more water and covered with more ice. Put it in the garage for 24 hours, keeping an eye on how quickly the ice was melting and adding more as needed. WOW.....the best.

Modifiers: I used vegetable broth, onion powder and coriander powder. The turkey turned out very good (but I also rubbed spices before roasting)

Awesome brining recipe, fused this recipe with another roasting focused recipe on ‘all recipes’ specially for stuffing inside turkey and around the roasting pot. Turned out to be really good, even got compliments from my wife who dislikes turkey.

Will use this brine again!  I did not have the coriander seeds, but everything else combined made it delicious smelling and our bird was very juicy.  Soaked for about 20 hours and it was a 13 pound turkey.  Cooked ours on the grill with a smoker box.  Super super yummy!

My turkey brined for 19 hours.  Best turkey I've ever eaten.  So flavorful and juicy.  After brining, I stuffed mine with a cornbread stuffing.  I'll never cook another turkey without brining it first.  No more dry, flavorless turkeys!  Now I know.

My turkey turned out so juicy and it tasted amazing I will definitely be using this brine from now on, even better the drippings were so flavorful that I didn't have to add any additional spices to flavor the gravy.

I made this and it was tasty. I also smoked the turkey on my primo smoker grill. They next time I mite soak the wood chips in advance and use the beautiful Amber water that the wood chips leave behind after soaking and see if that gives the turkey that little extra yum. Not sure if this is ok so if anybody has tried this before would be nice to know ahead of time.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and it was a hit. I will do the same again this year. The turkey was really juicy and had a good flavor.
