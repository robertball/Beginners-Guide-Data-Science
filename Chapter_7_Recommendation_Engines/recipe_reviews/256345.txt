I made it on the stove top.  I sautéed the veggies as noted in step 1 and then added everything else except the cabbage, bok choy and miso and cooked for about 45 minutes.  Shredded the chicken and then Added the miso, bok choy and cabbage and cooked for about 5 minutes.  I added the bok choy leaves after the soup was removed from the heat.  Delicious.

I made it exactly according to the recipe, although my five carrots yielded much more than a cup and a half (used them all anyway).  This soup was delicious!  Make sure you use the reduced sodium soy sauce though -- I almost didn't and was glad that I changed my mind and followed the recipe to the letter.  I think if it were any more salty, it would have been too much.

Simply amazing. And easy to do. The flavors blend so well with each other you can still taste the individual flavors but at the same time taste the soup. We couldn’t find grapeseed oil and just used some coconut oil. We didn’t add the siracha either because kids. But it didn’t need it. We only made 4 servings because our kids haven’t been eating much recently. (We have 4, ages 8-4).  They devoured it! (All except our 4 year old who refused to try it) they Had multiple helpings. We actually ended up not making enough.  Our seven year old asked if we could have it every day. Definitely making again. This will be a recurring dinner. Thank you!

Just realized we didn’t add garlic and used double the ginger.  Will do that in the future because it was wonderful!

Side note we also used all organic fresh ingredients.

We made this and it was excellent. We changed it up a bit. We first browned the chicken in the pot, removed it then added the veggies (including the garlic) and scraped up on the good brown flavoring. We then added the chicken, broth.  soy sauce, sriacha and a tablespoon of fish stock, then continued with the recipe.  We did take the chicken out and chop instead of shred.

We will definitely make this again.  I am passing this recipe onto my niece!

Wow! We had a cup of miso left over from another recipe, looked this up and are so happy we did! Our leeks were quite large, and we had a big head of bok choy,  so we had to add 4 extra cups of chicken stock. Substituted reaper sauce for sriracha, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Spectacular recipe!

I could not find bok choy or miso paste in my supermarket.    Called the other store nearby and they did not carry miso paste either.  Did not add onion or garlic due to diet restrictions.  The amount of ginger seemed to me like it would be overpowering so used it but a smaller quantity.  I added a half of a package of rice noodles.  Added a small amount of purple cabbage since that head was smaller than the napa cabbage at my store.  The soup turned out OK, not very flavorful given my changes, but, it is a good base to make chicken noodle soup.  Not sure if I will make this again since I could not find key ingredients and do not have an Asian market close by.

Very good flavors, left out the srichacha bc I can't do spicy. Subbed baby bella mushrooms because I had those on hand and I added a tablespoon of minced lemongrass since I had that as well.  I think you could throw broccoli, spinach or whatever other veggies you prefer in here and they would be fine.  I might consider cooking chicken separately and then adding in the the carrots and mushrooms since they get overcooked in my opinion. Does not look pretty, as the pics prove, so not much interest from the rest of my family in trying.  Oh well, healthy lunch for me for a week.

Turned out perfectly! Will definitely make it again. Super easy prep and clean up. Instead of miso paste, I used Trader Joe’s miso soup packet. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.

Yummy! Everyone enjoyed it!  I do not own a pressure cooker so I made it on the stove basically as instructed except simmering the chicken (breasts/halved)with the pot covered for 35 min. Since I used low sodium miso I doubled the soy sauce (low sodium) and sriracha and also added the fish sauce (1T) as previously suggested. We had some leftover rice which I scooped into the soup bowls before ladling the soup over top for my Guys with healthy appetites. Have been requested to make this again tonight!

This was my first Instant Pot Soup and it turned out great.  I used all low sodium ingredients which I would recommend.  Don't forget to add extra time for the Instant Pot to get to the right pressure, if you're planning for it to be done at a certain time... the 7 min cook time is really closer to 25.

Holy cow this was delicious. Made twice as written and it is easy and so, so good. It takes several days to finish it all and it gets tastier every day. Made with Savoy cabbage because Napa wasn't available and was no difference in flavor. I have served it with rice noodles, bread, it's good with everything.

I followed the recipe for slow cooker version. The aroma while cooking is tantalizing. The finished product excellent.
