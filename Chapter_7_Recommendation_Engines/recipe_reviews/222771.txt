I changed up the ingredients in this recipe to lower the calories and make it a little lighter so that I could indulge without a lot of guilt. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk, sugar free CHEESECAKE pudding and a mix of fat free evaporated milk and fat free half-n-half. The almonds are optional, I did not add them as my husband does not like almonds. I do NOT have a ice cream freezer, I combined the ingredients and poured it into a freezer friendly container. After it firmed up, I scooped it out and ran it through the blender until smooth, then poured it back into dixie cups to make freezer pops (once semi-solid, I inserted popsicle stick in the middle of each filled dixie cup). I was worried that the ice cream would be too sweet because of the sweetened condensed milk and the instant pudding but it really wasn't. We all enjoyed them, even my husband who isn't a fan of banana-flavored anything. My mind is already working on a spin-off recipe making this into a Banana Bread Ice Cream Pops.

Great recipe thanks for sharing.  I made a bit of changes as follows.  I only had a 2L ice cream maker so I used about 1 - 1.5 cups ripe mashed bananas to top off to the 2L.  I used 4 cups of whipping cream, 1 cup 2% milk and I made a mistake and instead of getting plain sweetened condensed milk I got  dulce de leche version - and a yummy mistake!!!  I mixed all very well using my kitchen aid.  DELICIOUS!!!!

A good way to use up ripe bananas, when you are burnt out on always making banana bread! This was so simple to make, and is really tasty. I did add about 1 tsp of vanilla while it was churning in the ice cream maker. I love the addition of the almonds. Thanks for the recipe!

Recently bought an ice cream maker from a local store.  This was the first recipe that I made in the mixer.  The texture and flavor is really good, for added flavor I added vanilla extract the second time I made it and the flavor was much crisper.  Next, I will look at mixing in other fruits such as strawberry and using a chocolate pudding for the mix to experiment with flavors.

Needs almond extract. Otherwise very good!
