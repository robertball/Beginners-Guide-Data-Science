Enchilada Pasta Bake Haiku: "Wow, this makes a ton! (I used spirals, and not shells.) Nice, make-ahead meal." I prepped this for a crowd of kids chowing dinner b4 trick-or-treating, since it was a basic, not too spicy, noodle dish. It was gobbled down (well, they left plenty of room for Halloween candy), and w/ plenty of leftovers for the adults, since this made ALOT. My personal taste resulted in me adding hot sauce, since it was on the mild side, but for ease of preparation, and for items typically on hand, it was a dinner success.

Very delish! It's simple and quick to make. I used hot & spicey taco mix. I would suggest that if you like it hotter.

I thought that this bake was pretty good, and a quick weeknight meal. 
My boyfriend hates buying the mixed spice packs because they are a rip-off, so we concocted our own tace seasoning, and it turned out great. Two cups of cheese seemed like a lot to put on the top of this bake, so we only did about a half cup, but if we were to make it again would use a whole cup because it does bake down into the casserole. 
Very delicious!

This was awesome!  My husband and I both loved it.  I added a couple things based on the other reviews.  Since some people said it was a bit dry, I added about a quarter cup of cream cheese to the tomato mixture. I also added a can of sliced black olives and some crushed red pepper, and topped off my plate with some avocado.  Next time, I'll try it with sour cream and salsa.

This was very easy and yummy. I used ground turkey instead and added some salsa as well to make it more "saucier". Everybody loved it, would be a great potluck dish too. Serve with sour cream and salsa too.

Made this for church Christmas social, it was a hit! I did add 8 crushed dried cayanne peppers to it for a kick, as i felt it was a tad bland. The salsa n sour cram was a nice touch to an already yummy dish. Will make again for home & church socials!

I made my own "take" on this for dinner last night.  Since so many of the reviews said it needed a little something "more", I used this recipe as the base and made the following changes/additions:  I grilled two chicken breasts in a pan with half of the taco seasoning packet until it was completely cooked through then diced and set aside.  To the pasta I added two cans of diced tomatoes with chilies, the other half of the taco seasoning, chicken, a bunch of chopped, fresh parsley and cilantro, the whites and greens of 3 green onions, some sauteed diced bell peppers, a pinch of cumin and garlic powder, a few dashes of Franks Red Hot sauce, about 3 squirts of lime juice, and swapped out chickpeas for the black beans because it's what I had on hand.  To all of that I mixed in some cheddar cheese and topped with more cheese, baked until cheese was melted and heated through, and served with sour cream.  The bf and I both really enjoyed this.  I think the recipe over all would be fine alone if you are in a hurry and don't want to "spice" it up, but for us it would have been too bland on it's own without the additions that I made.  Good base to build on and a quick meal. :)

This is a good basic recipe, but definitely needs help.  I used a box of whole wheat spirals (that is the 4 1/2 cups).  I added a can of mexicorn, but next time would probably just throw in 1 c of frozen corn.  Also added a can of green chiles, poured a can of red enchilada sauce before I added the cheese, and topped with 6 oz can sliced black olives.  I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site instead of the seasoning packet.  Served with sour cream and hot sauce.  Definitely needed hot sauce.  Next time I will add a second type of bean (maybe pinto beans) to the black beans and add at least 1 c of jalapeno jack cheese stirred into the base, plus the 2 c on top (we added more cheese when we ate).  Also can take more cilantro and green onions.

I made much of this the night before.  I boiled the penne, fried the veggies and mixed in the tomatoes, beans, chicken and seasoning.  Then cooled and covered it for overnight storage.  Today I only had to add chopped cilantro, green onions and shredded cheese before baking.  (Baked an extra 10 minutes because it was cold to start.) Even though I also added fried garlic, 2 bay leaves and some fresh chili powder, I found the recipe somewhat lacking.  It needed something that tasted fresh and tangy to offset the "dry and heavy" flavours of beans, cheese, chicken, pasta, etc.  Maybe some freshly chopped tomatoes or pico de gallo?   My hubby loved this, as did my guests, so I'm still giving it 4 stars.

Great!  I did not use the green onions or cilantro, but I did add a 4 oz. can of green chilies and an 11 oz. can of mexicorn.  If your chicken is already pre-cooked, it goes pretty quick!

I agree with the others who said this was too dry.  It also seemed to be too much pasta for the other ingredients so I did not add the full amount cooked.  The taste was good though so next time I will add more tomatoes or even salsa.

I've made this recipe with ground beef. It's fantastic! I highly recommend it!

I've also added a can of corn kernels, drained.

Delicious! I made minor changes; ground turkey for chicken and diced tomatoes with green chiles- I like spicy. Quick to make, a little chopping, and you throw it all together to bake. Will certainly be making this again!

My wife always did the cooking while I was working but after I retired it was my turn. I am not a good cook but am trying. I made this dish the other night and it was great! My wife lived it! Easy to put together and delicious

As written a bit bland. I added some tomato sauce, a diced shallot, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt and pepper to the mix and let simmer for a bit. Tossed the cooked pasta in a bit of cream cheese as well. I also used shredded chicken that I had left over instead of the diced chicken and I added corn instead of beans. It was good.

I read the comments about it being dry so I added picante to the mix. Also, the noodles I got were medium shells. It was a little too.. pasta-ee. I will make it again with the picante added in and smaller pasta. It had good flavor though :) Oh yea and it does make a lot. Perfect for a large family. I also used half an onion and half a bellpepper instead of a whole one.

I added a can of green chiles and a giant scoop of cream cheese so it wasn't dry. I also added some Tapatio for some spice. It was good but not amazing.

This was a fun, easy dish, but I found it to be way too bland. Next time I will add fresh jalapenos and spicy taco seasoning. The concept is great though, and this would be delicious for a potluck where not everyone enjoys extra spice.

Nice meal for the big family. I didn't use cilantro since I was missing it. I added an extra cup of chicken, as well as cheese. I used two real tomatoes instead of canned dice. It turned out very good.

My family enjoyed this recipe and most went for seconds. I did use hamburger instead of chicken as that is what we had and the only other change was that I added a small can of red enchilada sauce when I added the tomatoes because some of the reviews said it was too dry. This recipe is very versatile and can be adjusted to individual's taste and ingredients on hand which is why the 5 star review.

Nice recipe. I didn't have a taco seasoning one so i used a chilli seasoning. I think that was a little to much flavor. I think i would add a little more sauce next time too

I modified it, using what I had in the kitchen.  Instead of chicken, I used 1/2 lb of ground turkey meat that was seasoned with taco seasoning.  I used 2 T dried cilantro.  I used 1 green pepper and 1/2 yellow onion (instead of red and yellow pepper and green onion). I also added 3/4 of green chili's can (4 oz), because I was afraid it would be spicy.  Husband liked it, kids didn't really.

We enjoyed this dish!  After reading other reviews, I wanted to make sure it wouldn't be dry, so I added a 10 ounce can of Las Palmas red enchilada sauce, spooning this over the top before adding the cheese (of which I only had 1 cup, but it turned out to be just fine to our liking). I also mixed in a small can of diced green chiles, as well as a few dashes of cumin for extra flair.  Also agreed - don't forget the sour cream! A great casserole ;)
