Love the secret ingredient – peas.  I now make this regularly, but do a couple of things differently  - personal preference.  I use 1 egg plus 2 egg whites, 2 scallions instead of 1.  I also add ½ tsp soy sauce. Dark sesame oil is a must - use about 3 drops.   This is a quick, delicious meal for one.

It's  an okay recipe. I didn't like the sesame oil. Otherwise it was a nice meal.

Delicious and perfect. I just added a bit of soy sauce at the end. Thank you!

This soup is fantastic! I did take some of the suggestions and added a bit of soy and extra green onions as well as egg white. I also put a little chili sauce in my own bowl for a little kick. My husband raved about it! Even my 7 year old thought it was great. Easy, quick and tasty! Oh and South Beach friendly!

I loved this! I would give it 6 stars, but the men didn't like it as much. They like the thick bulky soups better.

I like this recipe. For my taste I had to season it up a little more but all in all it's a very good recipe. I added more pepper, a bit of garlic salt more green onion and just a bit of diced (very small) carrots and doubled the peas. Once in the serving bowls just a dash of Huy Fong Foods Garlic Chili Sauce. This stuff is awesome! I was first introduced to it in one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. Can be bought at most groceries.

I added quite a few more veggies, but in small amounts, one thinly sliced mushroom, a few thin slices of carrots and celery. I par-boiled the carrots and celery in the chicken broth, added the sesame oil and peas. I also added a dash or two of soy sauce. It was pretty good, but for me, it was still just a little bland. I will keep making this and playing with small additions.

Family loved this soup. It's easy to add peas, shredded carrots, mushrooms, water chestnuts or other veggies if your choice. I used low sodium broth. Definitely will make it again.

Simple and tasty.  I added a bit of soy sauce to boost flavor.  The peas were okay and added some umph but I wouldn't buy them especially for this soup.  I guess mushrooms or tofu would have been my first thoughts as additions.
