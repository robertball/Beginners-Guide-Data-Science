I followed the basic recipe but substitued one cup of chopped frozen strawberries for the ice cubes.  I also used fresh whipped cream and added a generous squeeze from a lemon as well as an additional cup of strawberries. Exactly what we were looking for!

I made this using a chocolate graham cracker crust and it was terrific! This was even after being interrupted several times, once for hours. The jello set up before the Cool Whip thawed, so I had to microwave the jello back to a liquid  state. Then the time waiting for the mixture to mound was longer than intended. So, even tho it looks a bit strange because of that, it goes to show you that you can really mess it up and it will still turn out to be a family favorite!

This is a really fresh and light dessert. The only change I would suggest is to add additional whipped topping on the top before serving. Once it sets up it needs something on top to make it look "finished". Otherwise a five star recipe! One more hint... make your own graham cracker crust. It just tastes better.

This was so good!  I took someone else's advice, froze a bunch of chopped strawberries and used them instead of ice, because I wanted the strawberry flavor to pop.  My fantastic-cook-of-a-neighbor thought it was awesome.  It's rare that I have a recipe good enough to share, but she wanted this one!  I do wish I had made my own graham cracker crust.  The ones at the store just don't taste good with a decent recipe.

This is THE best strawberry pie I've ever had. My family has been making this pie for I don't know how many years, but we always called it Light and Fruity Pie. Mmmmmmm!!!! Absolute heaven! :)

This pie tasted wonderful, and was a hit at my house. This is a keeper for the recipe box. Instead of making it with sliced strawberries, I cut the berries into cubes and mixed them in with the filling. The effect was a bit of fresh strawberry in every bite.

I'm rating 4 stars because doubling the strawberries will make it 5 stars.  I also used frozen and chopped strawberries in place of the ice cubes.  I brought this to a ribs/corn cobb dinner I was invited too and it was a hit!  Even among my husband who said he wasn't really fond of this type of dessert.  Easy and refreshing summer dessert!

I wasn't sure I was going to like this when I mixed the jello and cool whip, it may have been my fault for not letting the jello cool and thicken enough because it looked a little funky. BUT much to my suprise and the delight of DH and my kids, it was FANTASTIC.  Light, creamy, and cool.  I may add more berries next time but it was a really wonderful treat and between the two adults and three kids, there are no leftovers. I love how simple it is too, I was able to let my girls, 6 and 4, help quite a bit :)

ADD MORE STRAWBERRIES! One cup is NOT enough.  Also try with OREO crust (oreos mashed with one cup butter, cool 30 min)  Easy as Pie! :)

What a terrific, light pie!  I used strawberry/banana jello sweetened with Splenda and Splenda-sweetened whipped topping as well.  It was a hit!

This was very easy to make. The only thing I did different was to put it in the freezer for a little while(20mins) to speed up the process. Everyone loved it.

We love it! So light and strawberrylicious! I whipped up heavy whipping cream instead and added frozen strawberries instead of ice cubes to the gelatin as suggested. Also, an extra heaping cup of fresh strawberries doesn't hurt :) I'm going to make this pie again and again this summer!

Made this today but it's not going in a pie shell! I am putting this on top of a homemade Strawberry cake. Since I am putting it on a cake I didn't use the full cup of Strawberries. I wanted to make a Strawberry Mousse cake, similiar to a Chocolate Mousse cake I make. This was the only recipe I found that I thought would make it work. I made fresh whipped cream and finely chopped the frozen strawberries I had. I am putting sliced fresh strawberries on top before serving.

My pie is still setting up, so I can't verify 5 stars yet, but it tasted really good going in! I am using a Oreo Cookie crust (strawberries and chocolate, come on!), I used Mixed Fruit Sugar Free Jell-O because that is what I had and I tossed my strawberries with a little bit of spoonable Splenda before I stirred them in! I needed 6 ice cubes to set up the gelatin but it came together fairly quickly.

Maybe I did something wrong, but when I made it the pie never really set. Also a little too much strawberry flavor for me, I might try it again using pudding instead of gelatin.

I have tried this using orange Jell-O with mandarin oranges and lime Jell-O with pineapple tidbits.  Next I may try raspberry.  This is a very easy and versatile recipe.  Using sugar-free Jell-O and sugar-free frozen whipped topping and a reduced fat graham cracker crust, this is only 7 Weight Watchers Smart Points for a 1/8 slice of pie.

This was sooo good. My cousins were fighting over it on Easter..lol..of all holidays to be unruly. I made my own crust and whipped up some whipping cream over the top. It's strawberry season folks.  Try this super easy..kid friendly recipe.

Extremely easy to make. Very delicious and light does not make you feel bloated or gross like some other desserts do. It’s perfect mix of fluffy and sweet. Highly suggest making this pie for every occasion.

I was looking for something that was quick and easy and this fit the bill. It is nice and light, not too sweet   I topped it with a dollop of whipped cream and added some strawberry slices and fresh blueberries  for presentation.

My husband loves this pie!  Easy & delicious...when the hubby says it's better than Mrs. Edwards, I know it's a keeper.   I also added frozen strawberries instead of ice cubes.

I guess this is the same cool whip recipe I had as a kid. Just does not taste the same to me. Much too artificially sweet tasting. Not a fan.

We didn't love this one and we didn't hate it.  It was okay. Not spectacular.  It was light and refreshing.  
I used a Nilla Wafer crust which was good.

It tasted like Jello...too imitation strawberry flavor for our tastes. We wanted it to taste fresh, not like it was purchased at a local corner store. But it was edible.

Hubby loved this pie. Quick and easy.  Topped with additional whipped topping and strawberries.
