Made this exactly as written the first time around.  My husband said he would order these at a pub any day! The second time around, we added garlic and a small, diced jalapeno and loved it even more!  We're adding this to the monthly rotation!

I have made many recipes from this site, but never rated one ... before now.  THESE. WERE. GREAT.  Made a few changes: I halved the recipe, used dark brown sugar, and baked in the oven on 350 for one hour.  I loved how soft and flavorful they turned out to be.  The pan juices, mixed with spicy brown mustard, made the perfect condiment.  Thanks for the Great Recipe pljma5!!

Made these in the crockpot. Used Johnsonville "sweet" brats and instead of all water, I used half pineapple juice. The smell of these cooking is IN-sane. I was actually quite surprized by the end result of cooking it in the crockpot. I thought that the onions and apples would be inedible because they cooked for so long but once I drained off all of the liquid, the apples and onions made a kind of relish that went perfectly with the brats. Flavor was very good. Family ate every bite. I will most definitely make this again.

These got the thumbs up from the guys. I had deer brats and wanted to disguise the flavor a bit, so I thought this would work. I don't have a roaster, so I just used a 9x13 in the oven for about an hour. I only had 8 brats thawed, so I used 3 onions and 2 1/2 apples. A nice change from the usual. I would like to try it again with regular brats as well. Thanks for sharing!

These were quite good and it's my fault they weren't better-I don't have an electric roaster so I baked them but I made the mistake of covering the pan.  If you decide to bake these, I highly recommend you do so uncovered because the brats didn't brown up/caramelize and I had tons of liquid when it was done.  My results came out 3* but I'll give it 4 because they would be much better dark and candied as the recipe states, and it's my fault they weren't.  Will try again!

I cut the recipe down to our size since we only had a little over a pound of brats.  I also cooked them in the oven at 350 for about an hour and they turned out just right.  My husband says he likes the brats cooked this way better than on the grill.  But I prefer the brats on the grill.  Served this with dinner rolls, potato salad and delicious baked beans.  Made a great dinner and something outside the usual.

I made these brats for a staff lunch meeting and they were a hit! So simple and cooked perfectly. Just followed the recipe as is; only changed the number of servings to fit my group. Definitely a hit and will be making this again.

These are so good. I had to reduce the recipe since there are only 2 of us but I have made it 3 or more times and Hubby likes it too. I serve with smashed potatoes and a salad. Num

Good.  A different way to prepare brats.  We have them quite often in Wisconsin!

We liked this recipe as an alternative to the brats in beer option which we don’t like. I don’t have an electric roaster so  I followed the advice of other reviews to bake in oven at 350° for 1 hour and that didn’t work for me. After 1 hour it hadn’t even started to carmelize so I raised the oven to 400° for another hour. Next time I’ll cook at 325° for 3 hours and watch them. The flavour was very good and I’ll make these again.

I've never prepared brats any other way than grilling.  Our grill is put away for the season and I had some in the freezer I wanted to prepare so I came here for ideas.  I scaled down for four brats. These were so good!!!! I thawed them and baked in the oven at 350 for one hour UNCOVERED and they browned up beautifully!!! I added a thinly sliced large jalapeno as well. They tasted amazing and the onions and peppers were delicious and went well with the apple!! It was a nice change in the usual fall/winter dinner rotation to have something we normally only enjoy in the summer.  I will make these again!!

I added some hot dogs to the brats and cooked everything in my slow cooker for about four hours on high. It was delicious! I’ve made this recipe twice so far and will continue to make brats this way in the future. Thanks!

Delicious!  Used with deer brats.
