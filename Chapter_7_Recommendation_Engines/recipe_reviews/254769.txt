Absolutely delicious!  I served with a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette and it was just fabulous.  This does make a LOT of salad, though- next time I will cut recipe in half.

I boiled the barley in broth to kind of help it along with flavor, used lemon and lime simply because I had some that needed to be used. Other than that I made it exactly as written. It's delicious, but makes a LOT! You might want to cut the recipe in half.
