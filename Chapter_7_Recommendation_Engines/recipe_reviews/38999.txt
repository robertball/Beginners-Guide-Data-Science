This pie was really good, I made it twice. You do need to let it set, and I don't think 3 hours was enough. I would have liked it to be a bit creamier or lighter, like a mousse, because it tasted like a big chocolate chip. Everyone else liked it a LOT, I am just a perfectionist and chocoholic.

This pie did not turn out good for me and chocolate is my middle name. I followed the directions & ingredients to a tee, but the chocolate filling never hardened. It was still somewhat of a liquid. The flavor was great, but I needed a soup spoon to eat it.
