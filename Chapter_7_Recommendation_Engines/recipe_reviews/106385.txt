The cherry lends a big blast of flavor.  All in all, a good snack.

Good recipe. Good presentation & nice texture, maybe fell apart a little too easily (this could be appealing though).

Cherry muffins are very tasty.  The flavor is not too sweet, and tastes just like cherry muffins made with sugar.
