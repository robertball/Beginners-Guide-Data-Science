I saw these in the allrecipes magazine this week and immediately knew that I needed to add them to the Breakfast Baskets that I was making for the preschool teachers during National Teacher's Week. They were the favorite by far! I used both mild and cheddar cheese and made a Chive Cream Cheese instead of the butter since I was making a breakfast treat. Super easy to make, they had a great flaky texture and the cheese flavor was so delish. Best served warm so they are melty but I ate plenty at room temp and never complained once!

These are so delicious! I would recommend adding slightly more salt to the butter.

Tasted Great! I rolled the outside of dough square a bit too thin before cutting so the outer pieces a bit more dense, but the middle biscuits were perfect and had the fluffiest texture! They needed only a minute to cool and the chive butter really brought out the flavor. I used dry chives and need to cut down the amount to 2 Tbsp next time and a hint less cayenne but it was delicious as is.
