I am one of those who see a recipe and change something about it, usually always.  I was short on time so I plopped everything in a zipper bag, poured out 1/3 cup, for basting it later, and threw in the turkey tenderloins.  Left it to marinate overnight and fixed it on the grill tonight for dinner,  we all scarfed it down!  It was SO good, and I didn't change a thing, highly recommended!  I am always looking for different meal options, and this will definately get fixed again at our house.

We all loved this recipe!!! We didn't marinate it more than a couple hours, and it was still great on the grill. Thanks for sharing.

This was one of the best recipes I have found.  We had to cook some tenderloins, but were on our way out of town.  They were in the marinade during the trip and then overnight.  We grilled them at a friend's house.  Even my very picky boys loved it!!  This is a keeper!

I fixed this exactly as written and it was absolutely delicious!!!  The marinade is so good we want to try it with steak.  It's moist and very flavorful.  I usually don't care for turkey grilled due to the dryness but this was really good.  I will definitely make this again and again and am anxious to try it on steak. UMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!  And, it is quick and easy.  I marinated it overnight then put in on the grill, baked some potatoes and fixed some peas and had a great meal!!!!

I followed the directions exactly but I think overnight is to long. Turned out pretty salty. Maybe 4 hours would be enough. I think I may leave out the teriyaki sauce and increase the lime juice next time

I had turkey "filets" wrapped in bacon in the freezer and wasn't sure what to do with them.  As usual, I went to Allrecipes for inspiration.  I had all of the ingredients in the house and I followed the directions exactly.  I didn't have time to marinate overnight but it did marinate for about 6 hours and it turned out wonderful.  Normally, I use a recipe as a jumping off point and add some changes but this is great exactly as written!  I'll try it for steaks and chicken in the future - this one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks Linda!

Outstanding!  I purchased "Turkey Mignon" & was looking for a way to marinade...boy did I find it.  We marinated overnight & grilled to perfection.  I haven't had a piece of meat that moist, tender & delicious in a very long time.  You got rave reviews from my husband & daughter as well.  Thank you so much for the post.

Extremely good...I was very suprised!  I used turkey cutlets which are about 1/4" thick so they take all of about 5 min on the grill. I thought with all the soy and teriyaki it would have an over powering soy taste, but it didn't. Granted, I only marinated about 20 min in my vacuum sealer container which is like quadruple the time. I also didn't put in the full amount of soy & teriyaki, but put alittle extra red wine vinegar.  Well done on the recipe!

This marinade is killer! Everyone loved it!  It's the first time I'd every cooked tenderloins. My issue was that it was difficult to get the tenderloins to cook all the way through without burning the outside. I think next time I will use chicken breasts but the marinade is definitely a keeper. YUM!

My husband was getting sick of grilled chicken so we thought we'd try grilled turkey.  Like many other, I had no clue what to do with turkey cutlets.  This was so, so good!  I used olive oil vs. canola.  I marinated the turkey all day and it was very moist.  Next time I would cut the amount of pepper in half.

Great recipe....marinated for 24 hours and then grilled. The turkey was so moist and very flavorful. Loved the marinade....the only thing I did different was add only 1 tblspn. of olive oil instead of the full amount. Will make again!

I could not believe how juicy this marinade makes turkey cutlets! I marinated mine for only 2 hours and they came out beautifully on the grill!  I omitted the teriyaki sauce and used 2T lime juice in it's place.  Fantastic!

Amazing!  We always buy the Jennie-o tenderloins, but they already have a marinade.  I was excited to finally find the plain ones so I could try this marinade out.  It was a HUGE hit!  I prepared exactly as the recipe, but did not have basil, so I subbed Herbs de Provence.  Truly fabulous!  Only had time to marinade 2 1/2 hours.  Look forward to letting it marinade more next time:)

Awesome!  Didn't have dijon mustard, so used brown mustard.  Had to broil it because we don't have the grill up and running yet.  Took about 25 minutes total.  Big hit!  The whole family (even my 4 year old and 2 year old) cleaned their plates!

This had a very nice flavor even tho I screwed up and forgot to set some marinade aside for basting.  I marinaded all day while I was at work and put the tenderloins on the grill when I got home.  Quick, easy, and delicious.  Thank you for sharing.

This is one of my favorite family recipes.  Kids love it!  And I only marinate for thirty minutes sometimes.  It still taste great.  Oh, and instead of soy and teriyaki sauce, I use Soy Vay Veri Veri Teriyaki.

Best overall marinade I've tasted.  I used olive oil instead of canola.  I use this on turkey, chicken, pork & fish, & steak, on the grill and in the oven.  The longer the mean marinates, the better.  Depending on the type of fish you are using, don't marinate too long or the fish will be saturated.

Bought some tenderloins on sale; had NO idea how to prepare them.  Found this recipe; only marinated for a few hours (as I had to use up the meat!) and then grilled them.  Wow!  Was I pleasantly surprised!  We loved the taste and the moistness of the meat.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This marinade was just "okay" to me.  Nothing about the flavor stood out to me as being spectacular.  I will probably make it again - just not very often and not anytime soon.  I enjoy finding new recipes on this site and trying new things.  Thank you for adding this - it just didn't fit my taste personally.

good. very good. Marinated the night before, threw in more galic, yummy. Grilled it in a grill pan on the stove and took the rest of the marinade and brought it to a boil in a sauce pan and served with dinner. Will make again.

We went on a family holiday to a cabin on a lake and I made these ahead of time. They were tender and moist and grilling them worked perfectly.

I found this recipe because I purchased turkey cutlets and had no idea what to do with them.  The turkey marinated for about 2 hours, I forgot the dijon mustard and the basil, and it was still fabulous.  I served it with "cafeteria macaroni & cheese" from this site and got a thumbs up from the family for the entire meal.  I'll definitely be making this again.

My husband & eldest son reallyy liked but my youngest son and I thought it was just okay.  So I am rating the recipe a 4 to be fair.  It wasn't the recipe itself that I had a problem with but I think the two of us are just not fans of the type of meat.  I will make again for the other 2 who gave it a 5 rating.

A little too salty for my liking but overall is was good. I think it would be real good with fish.

Delicious!  These definitely need to be marinated overnight to get the full flavor.  It was too cold and snowy to grill outside, so I broiled these in the oven using the recommended cooking time for the grill and they were cooked perfectly.
