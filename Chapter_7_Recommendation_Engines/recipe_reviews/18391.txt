I made this for Easter and it was a HUGE hit.  I double the recipe and used a 9x13 pan and it came out perfectly.  Not a bit leftover.  The only thing I did was use 1 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple and 1 20 ounce can of chunk pineapple.  I also sprinkled a little cinnamon on the top, I got that idea from another reviewer who used pumpkin pie spice which I didn't have.  This is a new family favorite!

We really enjoyed this, but the 2nd time I made it, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Was not quite as sweet and still delicious.

I have been making this stuffing for years and it's delicious! My family requests it for Thanksgiving, as well, and I'm not allowed through the front door unless I've made it. The only differences between this recipe and the one I use is that I use unsalted butter instead of margarine, bake mine covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes and use a 2 quart casserole dish. Try it, I promise your family will thank you for it!

My mom has been making this same recipe for years and now I make every holidy for my in-laws. We use butter instead of margarine.  And I cook it with foil for the first half hr and without for the 2nd half hr so it gets a golden brown color.

I was intrigued by this recipe and everyone I told about it was skeptical . . . but it was so delicious (especially with ham)!!  Super easy too.  My alterations:  used half brown sugar, half white sugar, and added some pumpkin spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, etc.) on top.  Yum!  I accidentally cooked at 400 instead of 350, but it took a lot less time and still came out great!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe has been in my family since before I was born!! I absolutely love it!! My family makes this side dish for almost ever holiday. There is a few things we do differently....1st we use butter to grease the baking dish, 2nd we only use 3/4 cup of sugar (anymore is too sweet and takes away from the pineapple taste), 3rd thing we do a little differently is instead of creaming the butter and sugar together we whip the sugar and eggs together then mix the pineapple and the bread cubes in, last we mix in little cubes of butter. Pop it in the over until it's lightly brown on top. Absolutely Yummy!!!!!

This tastes like a buttery pineapple bread pudding, and we REALLY liked it with our Easter Ham dinner. When we first took the dish out of the oven, I thought it would be too buttery.  The butter was bubbling all around the edges of the Pyrex glass dish.  After sitting for 10 minutes, however, the butter was incorporated into the dish and it was perfect!  Now the changes:  we don't like really sweet food, so we cut the sugar by half. We also followed the suggestions to use half brown (1/4 cup) and half white (1/4 cup) sugar, as well as we sprinkled the top liberally with pumpkin pie spice. Baked for half the recommended time covered, and half uncovered for the other half.   With these changes, it was a 5 star for us!   We have added it to our "family" cookbook!

Okay.... I love this and only added a teaspoon of khoser salt(like that the best of all salts) now I followed every thing else.  I had a formal engagement the day before my party of 50.... never saw that anyone made this ahead.. well i did and it wa perfect. Can;'t wait till I make it fresh and try it. But freezing and thawing then cooking was a real treat.

I've always wanted to make a Pineapple Stuffing dish, but was afraid.  Until this dish.  This was easy to make, yet tasted like it took hours.  I invited our entire family and my son's soon to be in-laws (about 25 people) and made this recipe.  It was delicious and to quote one of the little ones who said "Aunt Donna, this is slamming!!"  I guess that means it was good in young people speak.

This is a favorite at Easter dinner. A little too sweet, so the second time, I reduced the sugar by half.  Use butter instead of margarine for better flavor.  To keep the stuffing from drying out, cover with foil for about 1/2 of the baking time.  Spray the foil with cooking spray on one side so it doesn't stick to the top of the stuffing.  Half way through cooking, remove the foil and bake uncovered for the balance of the time. Great stuffing with a crispy top.

For anyone having a consistency problem with this--> You have to double the bread.   I've been making this for years with regular sandwich bread.  Keep all other ingredients the same.  It's perfect.  Try it.

This is an easy no-fuss recipe.  I live in Japan and I had this at a cultural exchange meal.  I loved it and had to get the recipe and my friend said she found it here!  I quadrupled the recipe for a large gathering (fits great in large roasting pan) and had NONE left over!  I added cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg since it was a holiday meal and it was twice as nice.  Thanks for the dish.

This was so easy... and I even made it easier by just tearing the bread up and pouring the liquid over it and stirring it a bit in the pan! Still turned out great!

In our family we have this on Easter or with any special ham dinner. Everyone loves it!  We use 6 slices of bread... of course we use real butter for a holiday dish and if you are doubling the recipe,just use 6 eggs. Do not double your eggs.

I have made this recipe for several holidays now and now that the holidays are over, I find myself wanting to make ham for dinner just to have an excuse to make this dish! It was such a big hit! Something so different, that everyone was talking about it and asking for the recipe! I wish it was more healthy so we could have it more often! I did use half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I also used half pineapple tidbits (which leaves it a little less mushy) and half crushed pineapple.  I thought it was perfect! Definitely a keeper at this hosue!

Delicious!  I used 7 slices of bread and only 3/4 cp. sugar and it came out great.  I made a double batch for Christmas dinner and at the end of the night it was all gone.  I was told this would be the dish for me to bring every year!

I am not good at making stuffing but this was SO simple and SO easy, how could you mess it up? I did cut the sugar in half and used a 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup regular white sugar. I did sprinkle the top with pumpkin pie spice as another reviewer suggested. My family went CRAZY over this! It will definately be a well used recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing!

I used 1/2 c. salted butter, 3/4 c. sugar, 4 eggs, 20 oz. pineapple chunks which I cut into extremely small pieces, and 5 slices white bread.  It cooked for a half hour under foil, and a half an hour without foil.  Next time I will up the bread to 7 slices.  It was a little too wet for my liking with the 5 pieces, and I felt like the pineapple:bread was a little off...too much pineapple for the amount of bread.  I made this for a "Breakfast Night" dinner, and everyone loved it as is.  I just think it could be improved.  I wouldn't go more than 3/4 c. of sugar for this recipe.  3/4 c. seems to be the perfect amount of sweetness.  I am fairly certain with the adjustments I'm suggesting, you will end up with a 5 star recipe.  I also sprinkled some cinnamon over the top of it.

GREAT recipe.  The kids didn't especially enjoy this (they're not cooked pineapple lovers so I didn't expect them too).  The grown ups all loved this recipe - didn't add as much butter or sugar (used 1/2 splenda as well).  I agree that this recipe goes beautifully with ham.  Will be making it again for sure - thanks for a keeper!

I always ate this with ham growing up.  And I always forget the recipe, so this is the one I use now.  This is exactly how my mom makes it, and I make it exactly as the recipe says.  Make sure your pineapple is not sweetened, just in juice.  This recipe is supposed to be sweet, it ofsets the saltiness of the ham.  I don't add anything to it, because for me, every time I have this, it is a childhood memory.  I also usually make a double recipe of it.  I do use a 9x13 pan, because we like to have it a little drier and with a nice crispy top on it.  Even my picky husband gives this one a thumbs up, and it is one of his favorite side dishes.

Outstanding. I was responsible for the stuffing this Thanksgiving for about 20 people. I made a regular stuffing and this pineapple stuffing. I came home with some left over regular stuffing. There was none of the pineapple stuffing left. This receipe is a keeper.

I love this!!  My kids love this!!  It's so simple to make.
I do lessen the sugar to 3/4 C & I lessen the margarine to 1/3 C & it's still perfect.  I also use 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar.  The brown sugar gives it a little stickiness/crunchiness.  Awesome!

Yummy.  A real hit.  Like most others, I used only 1/2 cup sugar.  In making it ahead of time and refrigerating before baking, I found it required less baking time (about 45 minutes), perhaps because the bread absorbed more moisture.

This was fantastic.  We only used 1/2 the sugar and it was plenty sweet for us.  I could see using this as a light dessert too.

I make this for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. It also is so easy to make, when I bake chicken I make it as well.  I changed the recipe a bit, using 7 slices of bread instead of 5.  It makes a bit more (which is always eaten up) and it is not as sweet. I also cube the bread and then dry it out a bit. Delicious!

Wow! This looked beautiful coming out of the oven, and it was the hit of thanksgiving! As suggested i used less sugar and butter, and used a mixture of hawaiian rolls and sourdough bread, and a can of crushed and one chunk pineapple. a new staple :)

I took the advice of others and cut the sugar in half, and did 1/4c brown & 1/4 cup white sugar. I always use butter in place of margarine, 1 can pineapple tidbits and one can crushed pineapple and I sprinkle all spice on top. Cover and bake for 45min and uncovered for 15min. DELICIOUS!!

This is really a 5-star recipe, but it does need a bit of "tweaking" to get it there. It's a good foundation for a number of great variations. Making it as-is results in a very sweet dish that more closely resembles a dessert. I'd recommend reducing the sugar to 3/4 or 1/2 cup for good stuffing. In an effort to get rid of some random foods in my fridge, I chose go it more in the direction of a casserole by reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup and adding cubed ham and sautéed onions. I was skeptical, having varied from the recipe, but I am shocked at how amazing this turned out. Adding the savory ingredients counter-balanced the sweetness. By far one of the best dishes I have ever made. Little variations will suit a number of different tastes. I didn't have any canned pineapple but I did have a lot of leftover fresh dices so I just put them in a bag and mashed them with a meat mallet. With a little work, this dish is amazing.

I rated this recipe based on the outcome I had with my changes. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the bread slices. I made a double batch of this and it fit in ( i think) an 11x15 pan. So in all I used 20 slices of bread, 1 cup of BUTTER (plus i greased the pan with butter), 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 20 oz cans of crushed pineapple not DRAINED, and 8 eggs. It came out PERFECT!!! I personally could have added about 1/4-1/2 cup more sugar but it was fine with just 1 cup total for a double batch. I baked it covered for the first half hour and then uncovered it for the last half hour. Then it sat for about an hour in a warm place while I cooked everything else. Went VERY well with ham and everyone that ate it loved it!

Excellent with a few modifications. I make it in a 9/13 baking dish. I use almost a whole loaf of brownberry buttermilk bread-good texture. I use 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar which is plenty. I add one can of drained pineapple tidbits and one can of the crushed drained pineapple. It keeps it from being too soggy this way. I cut the butter to 3/4 cup. I add 1tsp of cinnamon to the whole mixture and add more on top. YUM!

A little too soggy/buttery the first time I made it, but I didn't give up, because I liked the idea and the combo.
My suggestions after working with it several times: 
-double the bread (I use sweet rolls or whatever I may have on hand) and cut up and let dry for several hours
-Use only 1/4 cup white and 1/4 brown sugar
-Saute a few onions and celery and then add in with the pineapple
-Sprinkle a little nutmeg in with the onions/celery
These changes make it a little more like a side dish as opposed to a dessert!

This is essentially greasy pineapple bread pudding.  The flavor is too sweet for a side dish and it's dripping with butter.  Would not make again.

Way too butter even though I cut the butter and the sugar like the other reviewers said. I didn't like the texture of the white bread and it tasted just like sweet and butter. It had no flavor. Next time, I would use hawaiian bread or cornbread, add some spices, and use less butter.

Super good--doubled the recipe, used one 20-oz can of crushed pineapple and one 20 oz can of pineapple chunks, and sprinkled cinnamon on top as other reviewers suggested. Barely a bit left, even the picky eaters loved this. I was afraid it would be too sweet (with both the sugar and pineapple), but it was just right. We had this with ham, and it was the perfect side. Will definitely be making this again.

A perfect side dish with ham!  I modified the recipe and used cinnamon raisin bread instead of white bread.  I also forgot to drain my pineapple so I increased the number of slices to soak up some of the extra juice.  Turned out great!

This has become a yummy favorite of mine!  I like to make it more like a dessert, adding a bit of cinnamon and vanilla, to taste, to the mix.  It is very good served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Mmmmm!

FIVE STARS all the way! I have tried other recipes and his one tops them all! I tripled the recipe and it just fit into a 9x13...use a drip tray though (my mistake). I baked it covered for 45 min and then took off the foil to brown for 15 more min. I found the stuffing to be a bit moist, but I left the stuffing in the oven with the oven off to keep warm until dinner (~20 min) and was perfect!

I made a couple changes ( I know I hate me too sometimes :-)  Used 1/2 brown sugar, and added dried cranberries and chopped pecans, it puts this recipe OVER THE TOP! Soooo good with ham! :-) :-) :-)

I had never heard of this until I started dating my current boyfriend and his mom made it for Thanksgiving.  I didn't care if I had anything else on my plate--all I wanted was this stuffing.  No turkey, no potatoes, no green beans, no gravy, just this stuffing.  That was five Thanksgivings ago and I've since introduced it to my side of the family as well.  It was really just a ploy to get to eat it four times a year (both families make it at Easter too, since it goes GREAT with ham).  Some people have complained that it's too sweet, and it IS really sweet.  I like it just fine anyway, but if your group doesn't love sweet stuff, just cut down.  This recipe is so un-fussy that you can make alterations without worrying about how it will affect the outcome.

This was soooo good! I don't typically like pineapple, but this was amazing. It almost tasted like a bread pudding. I will for sure make it again.

I followed other reviewer's advice and used less sugar than called for and I also used Cinnamon Bread instead of white bread.  The results were amazing!  I was going for more of a dessert than a side and this was the perfect solution!  Some guests added Cool Whip to theirs for an extra something but most enjoyed it just the way it was.  5 Stars for sure!

Made this for a labor day pot luck dinner that had a Hawaiian theme.  I followed the recipe and didn't add or change anything. This dish is too sweet to be a stuffing or dressing and there is no other flavor besides sweetness. It just lacks flavor and it wasn't a hit.

Great Easter side. I used 3/4 cup sugar per reviews and would do 1/2 next time. Very sweet, but very tasty with Easter Ham.

Made it in the blender, used more bread -- left over sesame seed hamburger buns and some white bread slices -- forgot the cinnamon sprinkled on top, and still it was the hit of Christmas dinner.  Everyone loved it, especially the teenaged boys, who would not allow the leftovers to leave.

I made this with ham for Sunday after Christmas dinner--very delicious and my family thought it very good.  Made it just like the recipe but used butter and texas toast w/crusts removed and cubed.  Had given the recipe to my aunt and we both made it alike--her family had it Christmas dinner and raved.  So give it a 10--5 from me and 5 from her!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used Brownberry unseasoned stuffing bread cubes that come in a bag.  45 minutes into the baking I poured some pineapple chunks over the top and baked 15 more minutes. Let cool. This was well received and had excellent taste and texture.

Excellent recipe.  I made this for a crowd of about 30 adults.  I tripled the recipe and cut the sugar to 2 cups instead of 3.  People were reluctant to try it based on its name, but all were pleasantly surprised.  I even received compliments from one of the pickiest eaters I know.  I have been told this is my new standard dish to bring to all family functions.

Wonderful stuffing. It's stuffing with the flavor of a pineapple upside down cake. I made this for a Christmas dinner yesterday and EVERYONE at the table commented on how good it was and ask for the recipe. The only thing I did differently is I cooked it a little longer than suggested and I only used 3/4 c sugar. It was delicious.

Wonderful recipe! I've made this for years. I just tripled the recipe for my daughter's wedding shower and received many compliments and requests for the recipe. Before baking, I sprinkle a little cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg on top. After baking, I arrange some maraschino cherries on top for appearance. This is a big hit at all functions and extremely easy to make.

SO GOOD!!! I've made this a couple times, the most recent to accompany Easter ham. The recipe as is, can be compared to a bread pudding. People are often impressed when they hear there are only a handful of ingredients for this dish! For something so easy, it tastes so fantastic.

Family loved this. I made this with the tangy honey glazed ham for Easter dinner and my family ate it up. I'm not a big stuffing fan (don't like moist bread) but the hubby and kids do. I took the advice of others and cut back the sugar to 2/3c. and hubby said it was just right - just sweet enough.

Thank you for posting this!  I had this at a family dinner several years ago and have wanted to get my hands on the recipe.  My family loves this with Easter dinner in place of traditional stuffing.  It's also good cold the day after. Reminds me of a Pineapple Bread Pudding. YUMMY!

I doubled the wet ingredients, using 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar, and used  1 bag unseasoned white breadcrumbs.  It fit perfectly into in a  9X13 pan. Sprinkled pumpkin pie spice on top and it turned out great!

I make this literally every year for my family and it’s phenomenal. The only change I make is using way more bread. I use about 12-15 slices of bread instead of 5 to give it the right consistency. It’s always a crowd pleaser when I make it.

I made this for they family Christmas. Everyone loved it. I did make a double Batch and used a can of crushed pineapple and a can of chunked pineapple. I mixed it the night before and baked it in the morning. That was something my mom always did with her stuffing she said it helped the stuffing set better.

My favorite side dish now! I get asked to bring it to every holiday meal. I follow the review below and double the recipe below using 1 can crushed and 1 can chunks. Sprinkle both cinnamon sugar and pumpkin pie spice on top - so delicious!!

I cut the sugar in half (or less) and add a small can of Ortega green chilies. Makes it more of a savory side, and less of a dessert. Also use butter instead of margarine.

This is now a holiday staple in my house for the last 5+ years. It's requested by my quests and there are never any leftovers.  I usually make two pans just so there's extra to go around!

Awesome recipe!! My family LOVES it! It goes great with ham. I reduce the sugar to half. I add cinnamon on the top before baking. I cover with foil for 45 mins and then take the foil off for 15 additional mins.

This went great with a ham or as a brunch side dish.  I added only 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also added 1/2 cup of whole cranberries in with the pineapples.  It made it sweet and tangy at the same time.

This recipe is a hit everytime I make it! I did cut the sugar down to 1/2 a cup, added a splash of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  For portion control, i baked this a cupcake pan for 30 -35 minutes.  This one is a keeper!

I had a similar dish years ago and wanted something different to serve this Easter. I made first dish as recipe stated and it was too sweet for me so I made again and had to tweek it up a bit and it was absolutely delicious! Here are the changes I made:doubled recipe for 9x13 cake pan; used butter instead of margerine; cut sugar to about 3/4 of what was called for and used half white sugar and half light brown sugar; added 1 teaspoon salt; 1/4 teaspoon cinnimon and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg; used day old rustic tuscany bread with great chew; added a little more bread to make it feel like a wet stuffing; and to make it more like a bread pudding added about 1/2 cup milk; and finally 1 Cup chopped walnuts mixed through plus 1/2 chopped walnuts on top. It tasted great with crispy edges and nice texture like a moist cake. My favorite way to eat leftovers is to cut a piece heated in microwave then slice about1/2 inch thick and lay on toasted tuscany bread with mayo and leftover sliced ham.

I used 1/3 cup of butter and 3/4 cups of sugar and everything else as written.  This was a side for Easter dinner with ham and turkey.  I doubled the recipe and had very few leftovers.  This was perfect.

Absolutely scrumptious! The whole family loved it and asked that I make it again. Used a little less sugar than called for, otherwise didn't change a thing with the recipe. Might add some cranberries for color at Thanksgiving.

I wasn't too sure about this one but tried it for the Christmas party and it was a hit! I cut down on the sugar to 1/4 cup of Splenda blend (1/2 cup sugar equivalent) and it was plenty sweet. One of the hits at the party. Will definitely make again.

Before I made this recipe, I read reviews and made adjustments.  I just used 1/2 cup sugar, 6 tablespoons of butter and used 12-grain bread.  I have now made it for two events.  People have raved about it.  With these adjustments I give it a 5-star rating.

This tastes really good, just like pineapple upside down cake.  It is more of a dessert than a side dish.  If you plan to make it as a side dish with ham, I would suggest reducing the sugar by half.

I made this for a family function today, but I don't think I'll make it again.  It was edible, not spectacular.  I'm glad I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup after reading some reviews because it was still quite sweet.  Although some people said they liked it, a few noted that it tasted more like a dessert or a variation of pineapple upside-down cake than a side dish.

I just recieved this recipe from my girlfriend who has an annual Luau. It was FABULOUS! I am now making it for another Luau we are going to this evening! I will use butter instead of margarine and ~10 slices of bread (mixed with 1/2 white bread and 1/2 Hawaiian bread). YUM... thanks for sharing!!

This pineapple stuffing is such a great side dish with any ham dish.  This stuff is to die for!  I loved it.  I make for almost every Easter.  Very highly recommend.  I did use butter instead of margarine.  Not for anyone watching their weight.  haha

A nice, easy dish that is more like a dessert, since it is more sweet than salty for a typical stuffing. After my cousin made it for a holiday meal, everyone loved it so I tried it myself. It is delicious, but in small quantities. If I made this on a regular basis I would substitute egg beaters, olivio, whole wheat bread, and possibly even use a sugar substitute.

Been making this for EVER. I use butter, regular salted butter. And I have switched to pineapple tidbits. I like to see and taste the pineapple. It is always eaten or taken home. Sometimes I save a little and hide it so I have some for the next day. I bake it ahead in a glass dish and reheat in microwave. Perfect.

This recipe is always a hit!. It is so easy to prepare. Like all cooks I made a slight modification.  I make  a flour, butter, brown sugar crumble for the top. Who doesn't like crumble. This is a must for all holidays.

I've been making this for years. I cut the sugar by 1/3 and add about 5 slices of cinnamon swirl bread cubed and do a split of half crushed pineapple and half pineapple tidbits. By doubling the bread you get a firmer mixture that's more like bread pudding. We eat it hot or cold and can be served as a desert!

This is a bread pudding in my experience. Delicious and simple to make. I used fresh crushed pineapple and the flavor was that much better. Highly recommend.

I added some pie spices as suggested, & dotted the butter on top. It was  too sweet, so I will cut down the sugar in half next time.  I will definitely make this again.  Served it with ham...very good!

I made this on a whim to add something new to our Thanksgiving dinner.  My sister was skeptical so she made traditional stuffing as well. 

All of the stuffing I made (this recipe) was GONE in a matter of minutes.   The kids were asking for MORE of just the stuffing. 

This will be a staple for all our holiday gatherings going forward.

Simple and delicious. We paired this with ham as suggested by other reviewers and my husband and I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the amount of sugar involved will keep it out of our regular rotation, but it's a nice treat maybe on a holiday.

This recipe is outstanding.  I've made it a number of times already during the holidays and it absolutely disappears.  As others have suggested, my changes are that I use real butter, 1.25 melted sticks; 5 eggs; 9 pieces of white bread, cubed; .25 cup of white sugar, .25 cup of brown sugar; sprinkle in some pumpkin spice; when pouring into greased pan, sprinkle a little more pumpkin spice on top.  Then bake half hour with tin foil cover; then, half hour without.  DELISH !!!

I’ve been making this dish for Easter & Christmas for years now. It is a family favorite. The only thing I do differently is, I double the amount of bread it calls for. I use at least 10 slices & I always use 20oz can. I usually have to double the recipe tho, everyone Lo

I served it with a baked ham. It did not go over well with my guests, but I liked it.  Most of it, I threw out.  I rate at four stars, because it tasted good.   I realize that this review is conflicting, but I liked it, I ate it.  Sometimes a successful recipe is about correctly reading the guests to whom you serve it.  Enough said.

I bless the day I came upon this recipe. Can't do ham without it!! Recently I finally decided to alter to create more a Pina colada taste. I already had coconut extract so I added few drops (probably 1/8-1/4 tsp) and OMG!!! It was soooo good. Try it! Cinnamon on top also helps with a beautiful color as well . BON APPETIT!!

Great base except I always double and use real unsalted butter and instead of all pineapple I do half pineapple half mandarin oranges. Always a hit!

Doubled the recipe  for Easter dinner using 1 can crushed and 1 can chunk pineapple. OMG everyone went crazy for this and I printed out 4 copies of this recipe. Also used 1/2 C white and 1/2 C brown sugar as suggested. I served it along with slow cooker ham, from this site, potato salad, baked beans and deviled eggs and a loaf of challah bread. Excellent  dinner and excellent recipe!

I made this for Easter dinner and it serves as a nice side to ham. I doubled the recipe and used only 1/2 cup each of brown and white sugar. I will make again, but will use less sugar. I'm sure 1/2- 3/4 cups of sugar would be sufficient.

This makes a small amount so to make it 9x13 for 10-12 people with the right amount of sweetness I do this: 2 sticks butter at room temp, 3/4 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 8 eggs, 2 20oz can crushed pineapple in juice drained, 1 20oz can chunky pineapple in juice drained, 10 slices thick/hearty white bread cubed.  Follow directions.  Sprinkle cinnamon on top. Bake 30 min covered, 30 min uncovered. Let sit 20 min to firm up.  Watch it ALL disappear.

Great recipe for a ham accompaniment. I did cut the sugar in half and it was PLENTY sweet. Also, I made it twice, once with crushed and once with chunk pineapple. Definitely crushed was better because it permeated the dish more completely. Will only use crushed in the future. Lots of raves and compliments from the extended fam on Christmas Eve.

Very tasty and super easy. As others suggested,  I halved the amount of sugar and did 1/4 C brown sugar and 1/4 C white sugar. It'd be way too sweet with one cup of sugar. Had a can of pineapple chunks so I rough chopped them and they were fine. I used egg whites too. Covered it for the first half of bake and then uncovered to brown it a bit on top. I'll absolutely make it again. Everyone loved it with their Christmas ham.

I made this for our Easter dinner and it went perfectly with the ham. After reading the reviews, I used half the sugar since it sounded like it didn't need it and it was still plenty sweet. I also used six pieces of bread instead of the five that it called for.   I doubled the recipe and it fit perfectly in a 9x13 pan.  Great recipe!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It is absolutely delicious with ham. I made a double batch, and doubled all the ingredients with the exception of the sugar. I kept the sugar at 1 cup. My family raved about the dish! This will be my go-to side dish with ham. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it would have been way too sweet with the full amount of sugar as directed in the recipe. I may even reduce the sugar content even further the next time I make it. I also used a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple and a 20 oz. can of pineapple tidbits as suggested by another reviewer. That gave it a good texture.

Loved it, the liquid does absorb back into the stuffing while sitting.  Could double as a dessert.   Used butter instead of margarine.  Yum!

My husband makes this as a dessert for parties, and it's always a huge hit. We both agree that it's way too sweet to be a stuffing. He puts it on the dessert table labeled pineapple bread pudding, and it vanishes every time.

When your kids want ham for Thanksgiving and all you really care about is the stuffing----this is the happy compromise.    It was ridiculously easy and very flavorful.  I cut the sugar in half, as other reviewers recommended, and it was the perfect sweetness for most of us (one child thought it too sweet----but she doesn't like chocolate, so that throws her credibility out the window here...)   I also used a bakery bread loaf which made for a thicker, more substantial bread bite.  I kept thinking about what a fun and delicious bread pudding could be made from this recipe!   We will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing, BBHealy.

I combined several of the suggestion like adding onions to make it less like a dessert.  I also cut down on the sugar.  My family still found it too much like a bread pudding.

this recipe is awesome!! Its too sweet to serve as a stuffing for ham so I also doubled up on the recipe add cinnamon vanilla extract and a little nutmeg and serve it as a dessert.  a definite crowd pleaser.

I absolutely love this dish. I make it for Easter every year.  It goes great with ham. I also have made this using splenda and truvia for baking. I have used whole wheat bread and hawaiian bread.  It is just sweet enough. I use real butter too. If it were'nt so full of calories I would make it much more.

This has become a requested dish for all holiday meals. It's quick and easy. I'm a fan of brown sugar, so I usually do half white/half brown sugar. Either way, it's great!

This is always a huge hit especially at Easter.  HAs anyone ever made in advance and refrigerated overnight before cooking? Does it work out okay?

I made this recipe last year.  Decided to make it again at Easter and again at Thanksgiving.  I made a few changes!  Intead of bread I crumbled Nilla wafers, and used very little sugar.  This turned out like a pineapple souffle' and was delicious.  Everyone just loved it.  Will be making again this year!,

Loved this BUT ....cut the sugar waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay down! I used 1/3 of the sugar. I wanted a side dish, not dessert. I also added nutmeg and allspice for extra flavor. Other than that, very very yummy. Great for serving with ham.

This was unbelievably simple and delish! I cut the sugar in half and used brown sugar instead. Also, dusted the top with cinnamon. I'm adding this to my niece's wedding menu. It's THAT good. Cheap and easy too. Delightful!

Only change that I made is that I cut the sugar amount in half.  Some of the people seemed to enjoy it, I did not like the consistency at all.

I made this as a side dish for the "Rosemary-Scented Pork Loin Stuffed with Roasted Garlic, Dried Apricots and Cranberries and Port Wine Pan Sauce" for Christmas. It was a hit.  As previously mentioned, I cut the sugar in half and doubled the recipe adding 1 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and 1 20 oz can of chunk pineapple.  I used 10 slices from a loaf of somewhat coarse oatmeal bread.  I baked it in two 8-in square pans to try to decrease cooking time. I haven't tried freezing it, but will again double the recipe next time and try to freeze half for later.

Made this for thanksgiving. It was a huge hit! Used half the sugar and it was plenty! Put it in 8x8 pan. Used probably about 10 pieces of bread. And as baking the juices started to puddle.. So I broke up some more pieces of bread and stuck them in there as it was baking to soak up the rest of the juice! It worked great! I highly recommend this! Will be making again

Love this recipe with ham or pork.  I use 7 slices of bread and 3/4 cup of white sugar and BUTTER.  I also use a long rectangle pan so it doesn't become too juicy.  Family Fav!

I made this receipe for 10 servings.  I tasted it after I had made it and was not liking it.  The stuffing tasted like scrambled eggs with very little pineapples.  I will not make this again.- Frackville, Pa

Our family has been making this recipe for about 10 years. We like to cut the sugar to about 3/4 cup and use butter rather than margarine. Sometimes I add a tablespoon of ground flax seed to this dish ( as well as many other recipes ).

I'm still on the fence about this recipe.  I did make with half the sugar called for which was a good call.  The texture was a little funky.  I wonder how adding some sweet onion would be?

Just OK,but that may have been my fault.  I did not have crushed pineapple so I substituted with chunk.  I think that made a difference.  I will try this again using both the crushed and the chunks.

This is a great simple recipe. I use English Muffin bread instead of white bread and the nooks and crannies are great for soaking up the juice. I also half the sugar and butter when I double the recipe and use chunk and crushed pineapple with a bit of cinnamon on the top.

This was very simple and easy to make. I must agree with the other reviewers that this tastes more like a dessert. I served this with ham and it was a hit for those who like the texture of stuffing or bread pudding. I used a 20 oz can of crushed pinneapple, however, next time I may add a little more since that was my favorite part. I covered mine with foil the first half of the baking time and then removed it for the second so that it would brown.

I doubled the recipe and each time I scooped for the sugar I used just slightly less than a cup. I used butter as well. Came out just perfect as always. My husband loves pineapples and really loves this stuffing. Everyone was raving and my kids gobbled it down. I got some yummy sweet bread at a french bakery and cut into cubes and toasted in the oven at 200 degrees for a couple hours until nice and stiff. I will never buy stale bread cubes again.

I made this recipe to go with ham on Christmas day and it was a hit!  I have a very picky family and everyone raved about this dish.  I used Texas Toast for the bread and crushed pineapple in it's own juice. I will be making this again very soon.

This has been a traditional easter dinner side dish in my family for YEARS. It is delicious and always gets rave reviews because it is so different and tasty! I would cut back on the sugar ( 1/2 of what is suggested, actually) and we always use a mix of pre-toasted (or just dried out) "kings Hawaiian bread" and Texas toast. Yum!  I don't personally think that cinnamon would taste too hot with this, but perhaps a tad dash of cloves.

I was skeptical - but this was delicious and almost too easy!  I made it two nights in a row - once for my family and once for another family and reviews were great!  A definite keeper.

Delicious stuffing. It is almost like a bread pudding. We even like to munch on the cold leftovers as a snack.

Very similar to a recipe I made a few days ago. I am trying out different ones to serve for Thanksgiving. While this is very good, I liked the other recipe better because it included the spices. Perfect with a ham, pork tenderloin or turkey. And very simple to prepare.

This is really wonderful with ham.  The contrast of salty ham and tangy sweet pineapple is just delicious!  I think this recipe has a little too much sugar, however. I've had it before (made by someone else) and it was fruitier as opposed to sugary.  Nonetheless, it's still worth making and serving with your next ham!

Loved it - ate it hot, warm and cold.  Tasted great @ all 3 temperatures!
