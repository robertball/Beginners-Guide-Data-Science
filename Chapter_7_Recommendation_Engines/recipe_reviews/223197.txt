Really delicious!  Will definitely be making this for bbq's this summer.  However, I will be reducing the salt.  A little too salty for my taste when 1 tsp is used.  I would recommend using half a tsp and tasting from there.

Fabulous! I substituted 3 medium sized tomatoes from the garden rather than the cherry tomatoes and followed the rest of the recipe and it was excellent! Don't delete the mint! It gives it a fresher taste!

An excellent fresh salsa.  If you have good summer tomatoes you don't have to use cherry tomatoes.  The mint is a different addition for me.  I liked it - hubby didn't like it as much so I would say, for us, the mint is optional.  I made this for Faceless Frenzy July 2012 - thanks for a good recipe to give a face too.

Not a big fan of this one but it is prob just our tastes.  i used early girl and roma tomatoes from our garden that had been skinned and de-seeded.  I didn't really measure all that closely which may be part of the problem too.  I found it to be a tad too sweet for my tastes and the mint was too pronounced.  Also the peppers I used were not spicy (you can just never tell) and we like a salsa with some heat so that turned us off a bit as well.

Not your average "salsa".  It is crisp and clean and citrus-y with some heat.  It is exactly what Chef John says....addictive.  At first I thought there was too much lime but then as you eat you look forward to it.  A 1/2 bunch of cilantro is left up to the cooks discretion as all bunches are different sizes.  I put a tad too much in ours but it doesn't make it a deal breaker.  I plan to serve mine with chips...yes...but also carne asada tacos.   Can't wait.

It wasn unlike any salsa I've had.  I like the fresh, crisp flavors; too much lime juice.

I made this and it’s really good, but I like salsa very spicy, since everything else is chopped/diced, I chopped up a Thai pepper instead of Cayenne. It was nice and hot.

We made this salsa and it is delicious!! This was my first time making salsa and I'm a fan of chunky salsa. this is fresh and so good! I am not fond of mint so I skipped the mint, I also blended a third of the salsa to make the consistency less watery. I also recommend letting it sit over night for the flavors to fully develope. I had so much left over that I seen a spicy chicken crock pot recipe on here that called for salsa, so I used the leftovers to this on it and it turned out wonderful! Will make again!

Wow!  A super fresh tasting salsa!  The mint adds an unexpected accent.  Used roma tomatoes and it worked out just fine.  Definitely make a double batch.

I tweeked a little just for our taste.  Adding a lot of jalapeno and jalapeno juice for a little extra bite.  I've made this a few times now and my granddaughter even asked me to make it for xmas eve.  When I make it I have to make extra so I can send some home with my grandkids.  (at their request)

this was amazing!! I had to force myself to stop eating it. The only change I made was I put everything through the lime juice in the blender  because I was using thawed frozen tomatoes then added the rest after mixing well. I will definitely make this again

Just finished making it to put atop fish.  I followed the recipe exactly but deleted the sugar.  Delicious. Tastes just like the salsa in Mexican restaurants.

fresh, simple, delicious, and unique with the hint of mint.  Don't forget the pinch of sugar- and salt to taste. If eating with chips- be sure to buy the "scoops"... The salsa is so good you'll want more than a dip on each chip.
