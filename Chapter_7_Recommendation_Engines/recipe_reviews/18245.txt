I reciently retired and my wife still works so I've been learning to cook so she would have dinner ready when she comes home. I've found that I really enjoy cooking.  Anyway, I made this baked corn recipe along with a meat loaf (also a recipe from this site).  The baked corn tasted great but I did make a change. After adding the two cups of corn, I only had a little bit of corn left in the frozen bag so I dumped the rest of it in to eliminate any left over corn. I should have added more flour and milk but it still came out great. I finished the left overs the next day and it as just as good warmed up!

This was very good and easy to make. Others said it was a bit bland, so I diced half of a jalapeno pepper and added that.

I think this recipe is great! If you love corn, here's another way to prepare it.  It's really different, and very tasty!

I have been making this for family meals for a few years now because it's always requested.  I got the recipe from a cookbook and there it calls for additional ingredients (1/2 tsp. paprika and 1/4 tsp. dry mustard).  It's always a hit!

I didn't have corn on hand, so I used 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables and doubled the cracker topping. There were no leftovers, its a keeper!

I used canned Green Giant sweet corn that I rinsed several times, omitted the green pepper, and used crushed croutons. It made a nice change from just plain old corn but it was WAY TOO SALTY!!! It would have had a nice taste if not for the saltiness. I recommend that if you used canned corn, you CUT THE SALT IN HALF.

This is wonderful!  Since it's summertime I used fresh ears of corn.  I used red pepper instead of green, and I stirred in about 3 T. shredded parmesan before pouring into the baking dish.  MMMMMM!

We had company and I made the "Baked Corn" for the first time.  It was just delicious and after dinner I cleared the table and the husband went and got the casserole dish and finished off the corn.  He thought it was just great.

I didn't really like this recipe becuase it was a little bland.  Needs some more spices definately.  My boyfriend on the other hand liked it a lot.

You'll like this recipe if you like baked corn with a Mexican flavor.  The pepper and onions are nice if you're in the mood for something different. My family enjoyed it.

Nice different way to prepare corn.  I do agree that it was a little bland, next time I will add some garlic and a few other spices, but overall good recipe.

This was really good and really easy. I tasted the mix before putting the crackers on and, like some of the other reviewers, thought it was a bit bland.  So I added a tsp of Badia Complete Seasoning, and it came out really good! I will definitely make this again.

I omitted the cracker crumbs because I was going for low-carb. The taste was great! But the egg was a little too eggy. I think next time I'll try it without.

My sister who said "I never like scallop corn"  ate it and loved it.  Well done, thanks!

For the cracker topping I ussed Cheez-It's and it brought out a great flavor.

I've made this a few times, and have used yellow bell pepper to disguise the pepper from the kids.  It gives it that pepper flavor without being obvious-looking that it is in there.  Also, I don't put the crackers on top and it is still good as a different side dish from normal.

This was very good. Something different to do with corn. I used corn on the cobb, boiled it and cut it off the cobb. I will definately make this again and again.  I can't wait until homegrown corn season!

This recipe was too dry and plain.  Needs something to give it a kick and some moisture!  Using creamed corn might help.

I am just learning how to cook and this was very easy to make and VERY delious!
I did add a little hamburger to it so it could be a little filling but even w/o the hamburger it would be great!

For such a quick and easy recipe, this comes out great and uses ingredients that you are likely to have on hand. (I used frozen corn kernals.)

Good! I didn't have the crackers to put on top, but followed the directions besides and my pickiest eaters ate it up. Leftovers were not good heated up... maybe better with the topping?

I added red peppers and green peppers to this recipe and also added some Red chilli powder along with the salt and pepper and it turned out great!

This was very good, what a different way to serve corn. I didn't use the green peppers(there was no way for me to pass it off to the kids) but it was still great. I will be making this very often.

Thanks for an awesome corn recipe. My boyfriend and I had to fight for the leftovers to bring for lunch!  I followed the recipe exactly-adding even the green peppers.  Thanks Cheryl for a great recipe--it will be a regular at our house!

This recipe came together beautifully! I loved the taste and so did my entire family. To avoid a strange green color in my corn I used yellow pepper instead of green.  That substitution helped with the lack of heat most people commented on. Will be making this for many more occasions!

We all liked this corn dish alot!! Ofcourse, I added the onions and green peppers! I don't think it makes a lot so it might have to be doubled when serving a crowd but we thought this was great and will make again!! Thanks Cheryl!!

FAAAAB-U-LOUS!!! I make it for all our big family dinners. I usually have to make a triple recipe bcz everyone LOVES it.
My changes:
I use a full sleeve of Ritz  (5/3 cup plus 5 tbsp butter)
I use sweet red peppers instead of green.
I cut the salt in half bcz Ritz crackers are already so salty.

Thank you Cheryl for this great family tradition.

Went together beautifully - - this is NOT sweet but rich and flavorful.  I added a bit of garlic salt and more pepper.

My hubby and I made this together, and we used 2 cans of Libby's whole kernel sweet corn - making it 3 cups of corn (15 oz cans). We kept the rest of the recipe the same, and it is perfect! The tsp of salt seemed a little much, but it was perfect for us.

This recipe is fantastic. My family and I loved it. The only changes I made were to addd a small zuchinni, diced and some sharp shredded cheddar cheese that I mixed into the mixture, before adding the cracker crumbs. It was absolutely delicious and will definitely be made on a regular basis. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us Cheryl. It was a big hit.

This was a very tasty recipe. I used thawed, frozen corn, chopped green onion, red pepper instead of green and skipped the cracker crumb topping. (I didn't want to add more fat to the recipe.) It was quick to make and came out wonderful. This will be a great recipe for a holiday buffet!! Loved it!!! Thanks!!!

I made this with canned white shoepeg corn, and it was WONDERFUL. I ended up putting a little less corn, and a little more bell pepper than in the recipe because that's what I had. I didn't think it was bland at all, but that might have been because of the extra bell pepper. My husband who loves corn made me promise to make this "a lot"

I followed recipe but added some fried bacon pieces for more flavor based on "bland" reviews.  I also substituted canned corn and it was good.  Will make again.

I would have given 2 stars but surprisingly the leftovers are tastier. A tasty dish perhaps but I found it a little bland. Thanks for the recipe, its not bad at all, its just my tastebuds like spicier things.

I only had frozen corn, which I cooked and let cool.  Maybe that's why I really didn't care for this.  IDK.

I needed a simple, tasty corn sidedish for Thanksgiving and this was perfect!  I left out the pepper this time, because I didn't feel that it was necessary to my menu.  Maybe next time I will try it with the pepper.  I also did not use the margarine at all, I only use butter.
