3.26.18  Added just a bit more soy sauce to the shrimp when it was in the skillet, but I couldn’t have been happier with the way this turned out, tender and succulent.  It just doesn’t get much easier or quicker than this.  Served tonight as an appetizer, and I definitely will be making this one again...and again!
