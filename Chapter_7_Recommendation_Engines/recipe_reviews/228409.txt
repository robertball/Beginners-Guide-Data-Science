At first the dumplings threw me off (I have never made ANY before!) but they turned out delicious!! Instead of two cans of cream of chic i used one of chic and one of celery. I also added a couple stalks of celery 2 carrots half a green pepper and some boiled then shredded chicken oh and some garlic(3cloves)! Simmered for two hours. It was DELICIOUS!! Even the kids had seconds!! I will definetly be making this soup again!!

I have made this several times. I follow the recipe exactly. What makes this the best is boiling the potatoes and dumplings separately. The only thing I do that is different I drop the dumplings by teaspoon. I don't cut them up.

Good! I added 3-4 Tbs of butter and it really made a difference! I have found you can add the dough directly to the soup.
