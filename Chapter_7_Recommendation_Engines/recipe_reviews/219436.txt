The Cheerios and pureed kiwi was an interesting twist so I wanted to give it a try. To be honest I didn't know what to expect after I decided to make this recipe. I happen to have all the ingredients on hand, well I had Peanut Butter Cheerios and Chocolate Cheerios so I went with the Peanut Butter. The cookies didn't brown much when I took them out of the oven. I allowed them to cool and tasted and was surprised this is a fantastic cake-like cookie.

I to randomly had all the ingredients, i used rolled oats and mine were just a hair on the dry side. But supper easy. I love the kind of recipes that you just mix it all together and bake. They were devoured at my house dry or not.  And my 4 yr old just loved helping me make them.

I didn't care for the cake-like texture so next time I'll just omit an egg. Love the multigrain cheerio idea though. I may try the peanut butter ones next time also.

Didn't care for texture of dough, plus lacked in flavour.

I was seriously disappointed with this recipe. They may be healthier, but for me it definitely took a toll on the taste.

Love this recipe, these cookies disappeared in a blink of an eye. Trying it with sound other mix ins, and fully expecting it to be equally fantastic.
