I really enjoyed this!  I didnâ€™t have any shrimp so I used some shredded chicken. I loved the flavor of the curry and apples!  My 4yo, 3yo and 1yo love it and so did my wife and I. Great recipe!

10.13.16   Had my doubts about the apple in fried rice, but was I ever pleasantly surprised.   First, I think I had the best Gala apple ever (seriously crisp and sweet), but what that apple brings to this recipe is really unique, the perfect complement to the shrimp and curry I might add.  Wouldn't change a thing, we loved it.  LHOON thanks for sharing an outstanding recipe, one that will be made again (and again) in this house.
