Great cookie! I followed the suggestion of others and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup each for the brown and white sugars, increased the vanilla, added an extra egg, and increased the peanut butter to one cup and it was great.  I also baked for about 10-11 minutes and they came out perfect and didn't crumble at all.

These were very tasty and everyone liked them. My only problem with them was when I was making them, it was really difficult for the dough to stay together. It kept falling apart and was in pieces. Anyone have any advice on what I could do differently next time?

My husband likes 3 kinds of cookies, so I looked on ingredient search for a recipe that incorporates all 3: peanut butter, oatmeal, and chocolate chip. I made the recipe as stated except I did not have WW flour so used AP, I had old fashioned oats & chopped them up a little in the food processor; I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/4 teaspoon almond extract (a tip from Yummy Peanut Butter Cookies, this site), and 1/2 t cinnamon. Just like What A Dish says in her review, they are soft but crisp on the outside. My husband rated these a 5 and asked for me to make them again. Great cookies Laurie!

This is the best peanut butter cookie I have ever tasted!  I am a purist and like it even better without the chocolate chips.  I wanted the cookies a bit larger and made only about 2 1/2 dozen, increasing the baking time to 10 minutes.  I think the cookies should be rolled into balls and pressed with a fork.

I had to package these up and drive them to my husband's work so I wouldn't eat them all.  I made them exactly as the recipe indicated and wouldn't change a thing!  These are AWESOME!  The oatmeal adds texture, the peanut butter is a wonderful twist and the chocolate is always a plus!  I love these and will doubtless make them time and time again.  Thanks for a no-fail pleaser!

Good cookies!  I, too, cut down on the sugar to only 1/2 cup each.  I also used 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  I used natural no-sugar peanut butter. I loved the texture of these!  Soft but crisp enough on the outside.  Easy to make too.

Great cookies! Be sure to use regular oats, not quick. I might try a little less white sugar next time. Also, be  sure to leave them on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before removing- I only waited 1 minute & they fell apart. I also used mini kisses. YUM!!!

I was disappointed the first time I made these cookies.  Working with the dough was a sticky mess and I ended up with extremely crumbly cookie dough.  Moreover, the cookies did not flatten and only tasted so-so.  But the second time I made them, I used cookie dough that had been refridgered for several days.  Since last time they hadn't flattened, I  shaped the dough into flat cookie shapes instead of balls and baked them for about 20 minutes in a toaster oven.  The results were fantastic cookies that were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside with a smooth peanut buttery flavor all over. 
Per other reviewers advice, I did make some modifications to the recipe.  I omitted the wheat flour and upped the all-purpose flour to 1 cup.  I decreased the white sugar to 1/2 cup and used natural peanut butter sweetened with honey.  I pulverized the oats too and used vanilla sugar instead of vanilla extract.

Best PB cookie I've tried yet - will be doing for my cookie swap.  Only difference I made was using all white flour and they came out great...

I had to modify the recipe a bit. It would of been helpful if others would say how much to decrease the sugar to. I decided to only add a 1/2 cup of each sugar and I added an extra 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour. The results were wonderful. I baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. This is a great cookie.

This is a great peanut butter cookie recipe.  I used the Smart Balance Omega peanut butter (chunky) for a healthier cookie and used Heath Toffee Chips this time and they were awesome!! Definatly try them with the toffee chips!

Very Tasty.  The first batch I didn't flatten (as the directions didn't call for it) but the remaining batches I did.  They cooked better flat.  I also used a convection oven, so 6 minutes was all that was needed at 375.

the cookies are pretty good, but not mind blowing.  PLEASE leave them on the cookie sheet for a minute or two after removing from the oven.  If you don't they WILL crumble into a thousand horrible (but tasty) pieces. :)

I customized this recipe and it was so GOOD. My middle son loves chocolate and I didn't have morsels SO... I added 2/3 C  cocoa and 1/3 C water with white chips. All other ingredients the same. REALLY SCRUMPTIOUS!!!!

Fabulous recipe!  My wife and I only use 1/2 cup each of the sugars.  Per other reviews, we also omit the wheat flour and just increase the white flour to 1 cup.  We have to add a tablespoon of milk to the dough when all is said and done to get the correct consistency.  (We also use butter flavored Crisco instead of butter.)  These cookies are divine.  I highly recommend them!

Jh Said good. Made them exactly as directed. Do not spread at all. Cooked 10 min. so they were more done, a bit dark on the outside but 8 min. too doughy.

These we a bit crumbly and I had a hard time shaping them into little balls but they did have a really nice flavor. I used a tablespoon to measure them out and shape them,used 1/2 c ww flour and1/2 c ap flour and sub splenda for white sugar. They turned out great. Baked them for 10 minutes rather than 8 because they didn't seem done.

Terrific cookies -- I've made them several times.

I've modified them somewhat, and I've arrived at what I consider to be the perfect peanut butter/chocolate chip cookie.

Here's what I do:
Decrease the white sugar to about 1/2 cup
Use unsweetened/natural peanut butter
Use all-purpose flour only (I don't keep whole wheat around, and can't be bothered to buy it)
Pulverize the oats in a food processor before adding them
Up the chocolate chips to about 1 1/3 cups

I think these turned out excellent.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat simply because I prefer to use the whole wheat and had more of it on hand.  Mine needed to bake about 10 minutes and turned out wonderful.  I will certainly make these again!

AWESOME cookies! Totally will make again! I suggest swapping the whole wheat flour for white, and the white for whole wheat cuz it gives them a great texture! I also used an extra egg to get it all to stick together well, a full cup of extra chunky peanut butter and doubled the vanilla. Very tasty! My husband is a cookie monster, so he ended up eating most of them and our 4 kids were complaining that they didn't get as many as they wanted! I'll double the recipe next time!

Fantastic peanut butter cookie!! Chewy and soft! Followed recipe ingredients exactly. The recipe did not say to pack down the brown sugar like alot of recipes do, so I did not pack it down. Turned out delicious!! Now the first batch i made, i baked for 8 minutes like the recipe calls to do. They were still soft but seemed to flatten out a little more than i like so the second batch I put in for  7minutes 30 sec and they did not flatten out so much and were perfectly soft and chewy!! Two enthusiastic thumbs up!!

I made these exactly as the recipe stated, only I used 1 cup of all purpose flour (didn't have wheat flour).  I also put my rolled oats in the mini food processor to grind it up a bit and make it more fine.  Turned out delicious!  Didn't last long at my house.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe almost completely but cut the choc chips and 1/4 of white sugar. I added 3 tsp. of honey instead. They came out flat, chewy, and delicious. They aren't the prettiest cookie I've made but they are certainly one of the healthier and delicious. The honey made the cookie stick nicely together and added some natural sweet. The cookie is really delicious without the chocolate, for those of you who are into a more natural cookie. And finally, let the cookie cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes before moving them.

These were really dry and crumbly, fell apart well after they had cooled. Taste wasn't great, texture was dry. Won't make them again.

These are very good!  I made some modifications based on other reviews.  I used only 1/2 a cup of each sugar and 1 cup of peanut butter.  I put the oats in a blender before adding them and I used about 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips.  I also used 1 cup of regular flour and did not use the wheat flour, which I don't keep on hand.  They turned out perfect the dough was not at all dry.  This recipe combines 3 of my favorite kinds of cookies into one!  It's great!

This recipe was so great... I made a few changes I used 2 tsp of vinalla, all white flour, no chocolate chips and I added a 1/2 cup of coconut... Great nice and chewy... thanks for the recipe!

These cookies have a great texture - crispy outisde and chewy inside - but they are way too sweet.  I wish I had read the previous reviews before I made them.  I will make them again but will cut the sugar back a lot.

I just made these and we were all excited given the review. They are way too sweet! My 8 year old son said this independent of me- said he didn't like them because of the sugar- and we like sugar! Maybe if the sugar was cut down? I could barely taste the peanut butter due to the over-sweetness. Too bad- I doubled the recipe.

These were great. I used 1/2 cup raw and 1/2 cup regular sugar instead of listed amounts. And because my husband "doesn't like chocolate"- I omitted the chips and then after flattening on baking sheet I pressed an indentation into the middle of each cookie and put about 1/2 tsp of strawberry jam. Baked for 8 minutes and they were perfectly soft and delicious! Also -- definitely take advice of many reviewers and leave them on cookie sheet for a minimum of 5 minutes otherwise they break. But they lift perfectly if you let them sit first!

I liked the cookies but they were't my favorite peanut butter oatmeal cookies , they taste much better the next day .
the cookies were thick and crispy from outside chewy from inside , I used less sugar 1/2 cup each and I think that was enough . the reason I gave it 4 stars because I like large cookies and they came a little bit crumbly but I think for smaller size I would't have this problem

I had no problem with these cookies holding together and maybe it is because I used egg whites only and used maybe a total of three egg whites and added 1/4 cup more of flour. They baked for about 10 min. I didn't think they were too sweet and I'm not a big sweet eater. I would make them again and by the way, I used regular oatmeal and quick cooking oatmeal and they taste just fine. I did not grind down the oatmeal to make it finer. If I make these again and use whole eggs maybe I would use two large eggs and then again, maybe not. They were very good.

Excellent recipe. Cookies were crispy on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. I didn't use the chocolate chips.... I just added in a little more oats instead.

These are super!  I used dark chocolate chips and all-natural peanut butter with honey.  I also made 30 cookies because I made mine a little bit larger and baked them for 10 min. Perfect!  I will be making these again.

What a great recipe!  I used only AP flour (no wheat flour), increased the peanut butter to 1 cup, and didn't add chocolate chips (I'd already made chocolate chip cookies).  I baked for 8 minutes and they turned out so chewy and peanut buttery!  My family loved them.  This will be my go-to recipe for Peanut Butter Cookies from now on!

This is a really good cookie.  I cooked these on parchment paper and reduced the temp to 350 because my cookies were getting a little too brown.  After trying some dropped, I rolled them into balls and flattened with a fork to give them a little bit or a "peanut butter cookie" look.  They look nice like that.  I reduced the sugars to 1/2 each and they were perfect!  I also used peanut butter chips in them.  Yummm!  Thanks for sharing Ruggles!

I was looking for a "healthy" cookie recipe for an after-school snack for my kids and although this is a healthier version of a cookie, it does not skimp on taste in the least! The only problem was they were so good we couldn't just eat one! I only added 1/2 c. each of the sugars, and did 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. white. They didn't seem heavy at all. It already is a more dense cookie so that hides the whole wheat flour beautifully. I also added 1/8 tsp. almond extract as someone suggested and that helped add to the flavor too. I also didn't have quite 1 c. chips (prob. 3/4 c.) and that seemed like plenty too--if you wanted to cut down more you could easily do 1/2 c. NOTE: Definitely press the cookies down before baking! The first batch I didn't do that with and they held the exact shape they were as dough. Flattened them with a fork for the second batch and they were perfect. I'll definitely be making these a lot. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I am an absolute cookie monster, and these cookies were by far the best cookies I've experimented making! I followed the suggestion of other reviews and added only 1/2 for each of the sugars, as well as a tablespoon of maple syrup, and a cup of oatmeal. It made them perfect!

The cookies were good with the modifications that I made.  I used 1/2c of brown sugar and 1/2c of splenda.  I also used 3/4c of white flour and 1/4 of wheat bran.  The cookies turned out nice and they were still REALLY sweet.  I think they would have been too sweet using 3/4c of each sugar.

my husband of six months asked if i could make a "peanut butter chocolate chip oatmeal raisin cookie", then smiled really big, thinking that it couldnt be done. i said yeah, i think i can do that. and he got super excited. 

so i looked and looked for recipes,  and this is the one i went with.. doing half raisins and half chocolate chips.

its definitely a good enough balance that you can taste whatever cookie you want it to be.. oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, or peanut butter... but then again it all goes so well together. 

he told me i can make these any time.. 
his band loved them too. 

(i didn't pack the 3/4 C brown sugar, to cut back a bit.)

This is my favorite Peanut Butter cookie.  I use a stand mixer until dough is stiff and then use a melon baller to scoop out dough on to cookie sheets.  This keeps the outside crisp and the insides soft and almost gooey. I also let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheets before trying to remove to keep the shape.

Wonderful!! Crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  If you want a pure peanut butter cookie, just omit the chocolate chips and they are just as good!

These cookies were good, but not my all time favorite peanut butter cookie.  Also, if made according to recipe, the cookies would be way too small.  I made about 3 dozen cookies out of this recipe, but I don't think I'll be trying it again.

Delicious cookies!!  This is the perfect peanut butter cookie!  I only made one mistake and set the timer for 8 minutes and the cookies were a little burnt.  So the next batch, I set the timer for 7 minutes and they were perfect.  Firm on the outside, chewy in the middle.  I guess my oven just cooks a little faster.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I have been looking for a recipe to use up the remaining wheat flour that I have. Also, I only got about 3 dozen cookies. But nevertheless, they were good!!!

I made these cookies once and was hooked.  They are absolutely the best cookies I've ever eaten.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, blissful all over.  When friends and family come over they BEG me to make these cookies, so I know its not just me.  If yours didn't turn out well then you might want to double check the recipe, because the slightest mistake will affect the outcome (as with most recipes)

It’s a very good cookie and gets docked a star because even though I decreased the sugar it  was still too sweet.  They are also a tiny bit dry after they cool down, but taking them out a minute earlier might address that.  I halved the recipe and made the following changes: I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup each; I used one whole egg instead of 1/2 of one; I used white whole wheat flour instead of a mix of white and whole wheat. The sugar needs to go down to no more than 1/4 cup each for a half recipe, possibly less. Also, the cookies essentially still looked like little balls 2/3 of the way through cooking, so I flattened them very slightly. I did increase the peanut butter slightly but won’t do that next time.

These are really delicious. I followed others' suggestion and used only 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, but increased the peanut butter to 1 cup. I also baked a little longer, 11-12 minutes. I cooled almost completely on the baking sheets before moving the cookies to wire racks. Everything turned out superb. Would definitely make again.

It's just too much sugar for me.  I'm kicking myself because I almost always go down and read the reviews before I make a new recipe.  I saw a lot of stars, oatmeal and peanut butter together, and just went for it.  I think it either needed more flour or less sugar for sure.  I subbed coconut oil for butter,  I'm not sure if they had an effect on it.  I omitted the chocolate chips and turned them into button cookies by pushing a chocolate kiss in the center right when they came out.  I baked them for 10 minutes, however I only made 21 cookies, so I think mine were kind of big.  I'd like to try them again with less sugar.  I'm going to send most of them to work with my boyfriend.

As suggested by others, cut the sugars to 1/2 cup, added a extra egg, and upped the PB to a cup.  Best PB cookies ever!

Most SCRUMPTIOUS and MOIST cookies ever!!! I have never tasted such a delightful creation before. If I was a food critic I would award this 1st place!!!!! I felt like I was in heaven. I didn't add white sugar though, I just used 4/4 of brown sugar and they turned out fantastic!!!!! I found the cookies quiet easy to make.

Very yummy. Had to substitute baking powder for baking soda because we were out. So, 4 tsp. of baking powder instead of 1 tsp of baking soda. Made them really fluffy.

I've made these twice now. First time with quick oats and the second with old fashioned. Both were good, but I prefer the quick. I did reduce the sugars and increase the peanut butter, as mentioned in a few other reviews. The cookies are EXCELLENT. Will make them again and again.

Great cookie texture and a classic peanut butter flavor.  For this recipe I used 2/4 less of white sugar and added a bit more chocolate chips (just because of personal taste).Remember that, when you bake cookies, they come out a little soft and harden when left to cool in a cooling rack. Recommend it 100%! Enjoy!

These cookies were great! Some people said they needed more eggs, so to avoid too much egg I doubled the recipe but used 3 eggs. I also used all white flour and doubled the vanilla. With milk chocolate chips, these were a real hit with my family.

An excellent cookie recipe. I reduced the amount of white sugar by 1/4 cup and increased peanut butter to one full cup. I used natural crunchy peanut butter so I would not have any partially hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup. The extra oil in the peanut butter did not effect the recipe at all. I used dark chocolate chunks as that is my favorite....Fantastic!

These were awesome.  Made them for my friend in Afghanastan, but saved some for myself as well.  Making them again for us both.  I had the same problem of the being very crumbly.  So, when putting them on the tray, I rolled them into a ball.  They stayed together better that way.

I take these to reunions and other pot luck functions. They are always a hit. I put the oatmeal thru the blender so they are not so coarse. It gives the cookies a better texture. I like them better than the "famous" chocolate chip cookie recipes. My grandkids like peanut butter and chocolate so this is a special treat for them.

THESE ARE THE BEST !!!  I am just now trying these 'hot out the oven' PAN COOKIE BARS - I used a glass 13 x 9 pan (lightly greased) and baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes - PERFECT !! 

Per others suggestions - used only 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup splenda and 1/4 cup white sugar - had milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet.

Glad I found this on AllRecipes - it will be my 'go to' recipe from now on - THANK YOU !!!

I'm pretty sure my husband says this about all of the peanut butter cookies that I make, but these are now his favorite.  Great combination with both flours.  I reduced the sugars to 1/2 cup each.  Love the addition of the oats.  And these are not flat cookies.  They are puffy, chewy and soft cookies.  Just perfect!

EXCELLENT recipe! I would definitely make it again!  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar as others suggested. It took about 10-11 minutes to cook.

YUM!  These are great!  Used all white flour because I didn't have wheat and no oats also because I didn't have them and they turned out really well.  8 minutes is perfect for the cook time!

These are my new favourites! The first time I made them exactly as written, but the second batch I added 1/4 tsp of almond extract and 1/2 cup of walnuts and they were perfect.

I really enjoyed these cookies!  I followed the recipe almost exactly the first time, just adding a little more peanut butter, and then the following week I made them again to take to a kids' activity and I doubled the recipe (it just doesn't make as many cookies as my usual cookie recipes do.  If I'm going to make cookies, I want plenty of them so they last a few days!) but used less chocolate chips than called for because I still actually found them a little too chocolaty (and I love chocolate!)  They are more crunchy than I expected at first, but I really found them delicious and addictive.  Will definitely keep this recipe and make again!  Thanks.

OH MY GOSH THESE COOKIES ARE SOOOOOO GOOD!!  They just may be evil.  My husband, one of our friends, and I could not stop eating them!!!  I had to give some away to other friends b/c if not I would have eaten them all!!!  I am going to try to find a way to make them healthier....if that is possible.  Oh and you have to use all natural peanut butter!!!  Delicious!!

These were really good!  My family loves both peanut butter AND oatmeal cookies, so this cookie was defintely the best of both worlds.  Word of caution:  Use unsalted butter since this recipe calls for salt.  If you have salted butter, I'd leave out the salt.  The first time I made these, all I had was salted butter on hand and I found that the cookie was a little bit on the salty side when I also added the 1/2 tsp. of salt.  I've used both salted and unsalted butter now and I've used or omitted the 1/2 tsp. of salt accordingly!  Also, the perfect time to take these out of the oven (in my oven, anyway) was 8 minutes.  Since not all ovens are created equally, look for when the cookies start to brown on the edges and slightly brown on top.  Once removed, they will set nicely!  (Oh, and use parchment paper!!)

This is by far my all time favorite cookie ever! I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now. I follow the recipe but use just a skiff less sugar than required and I add closer to a cup of peanut butter. I use my smaller sized cookie scooper, set my over at 370 and bake for 6 minutes. I almost forgot to mention that I grind the oats just a little bit for a preferred texture.

These cookies rate very high on the family's list. I haven't even finished the batch and they're disappearing.  I used 2 eggs instead of one, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and I had no problems with either the dough being too dry or the cookie crumbling after baking. Off to make another batch for my co-workers.

These cookies were amazing.  Took others advice and cut sugar down to 1/2 cup and added a little almond extract!  Maybe 3/4 tsp.  Loved the change!  Leave the cookie on the sheet for at least 15 minutes or will fall apart!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I only made a margarine-for-butter substitution.  The cookies were a hit, but I can see how some may think they're too sweet.  If you like peanut butter, you'll love these.  I didn't think 8 minutes was long enough, but if I had let them cool a little longer before transferring them, I might not have needed to bake the second batch longer than 8 min.  Just a thought.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I doubled the recipe for Labor Day and ground up the oats in the blender -- to disguise them. Kids and adults both liked them. Thanks for a good new recipe combining two favorite cookies. This is a keeper!

Just made these cookies tonight and we loved them.  My husband had requested oatmeal chocolate chip with pecans, so when I found this recipe and saw it was so well reviewed, I had to make it, and add his pecans.  Very good.  I also submitted a photo of my cookies.  I can't wait to see if it is posted.

Lately I have been in a real cookie slump! No matter what kind I make, chocolate chip to sugar cookies, my husband says they are just "alright". This recipe put a end to that! They are delicious! No real changes made except that I didn't have whole wheat flour so I just used all-purpose. For the chips I used a bag of the REESE'S Premier Baking Pieces. They are tiny little Reese cups! I love those things! I also used 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips.  My husband and kids kept talking about how great they tasted. I had to make a new batch the next night. Thanks for getting me out of the "alright" cookie drought!

Yum! Thanks for this great recipe! My friends LOVED them. I did, however, make a few small adjustments. I didn't have brown sugar on hand, so I used a one cup of Splenda. I was also out of vanilla extract, unfortunantely. But they turned out great anyway. They also didn't flatten out, so I had to press them flat. But otherwise, they were great!

These are so good! I made the recipe to the 'T' except I used all AP flour. Some people thought they were too sweet, but I thought they were perfectly sweet. The texture is great, and unlike many cookie recipes that use 2 sticks of butter, this only calls for one, so maybe they're a little better for ya too! ( ;

I thought that the dough was too dry and added an extra 1/2 stick of butter, and that was probably a mistake -- too oily.  The peanut butter itself already has a lot of oil  However, the recipe as listed is TOO sweet. I already reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still too sweet. I also replaced the chocolate chips with Reese's peanut butter chips.  Overall the recipe is great the way it is... just reduce sugar, maybe by half.

These cookies were awesome.  I did make a few changes--I increased the butter by about 3 tablespoons since other reviewers had problems with dryness.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half regular.  The cookies weren't dry at all and they tasted great!

These cookies were good but not the best.  They were a little too dry for my taste.  I agree with others in that you should grind your oats.  It helps it mix together better.  I don't think I'll make these again.

These are delicious cookies.  I only had medium eggs and all-purpose flour.  I used 2 medium eggs instead of 1 large and they were very moist.  The cookies were even better the second day.  Will make again and recommend to friends.

Alas, the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe.  Great texture, flavor and appearance.  Just enough chocolate. Light and crispy.  Just yummy.  I Will try to make them again.

These are good.  I omitted the vanilla and used all freshly ground whole what flour.  They came out with firm texture and not overly sweet.  The chocolate chips add the perfect flavor.

These cookies were absolutely delicious! This is a must-try recipe. The only thing that I was disappointed about is that it doesn't make the number of servings listed in the recipe.

I am not crazy about peanut butter, but these cookies were good.  If I had to eat a pb cookie, these would be it.  They just tasted a bit too sweet to me.  They were crispy on the edges, chewy in the middle, and looked very gourmet-ish.

These cookies were wonderful!  They were chewy in the center and slightly crisp on the outside.  A flatter cookie, not puffy.  Just the way my family likes them.  I will definately make these again.

I thought these turned out pretty well, although I think the suggestion to slightly cut down on the sugar/add more peanut butter is a good one. I didn’t do this this time, as I wanted to try out the recipe as it was. The addition of the chocolate is nice but it does tend to overwhelm the pb flavor. For the peanut butter, I used Peanut Butter & Co Smooth Operator. The one major change I made was to store the dough in the fridge for over an hour before baking. Someone asked how to cut down on stickiness, and fridge storage definitely helps! I rolled the dough into balls and wondered if they were a little too large. Maybe they were, or maybe the baking time is off, because 8 minutes was not nearly enough. I ended up doubling the baking time, which was probably too much, although it didn’t ruin the cookies— it just made them crunchy and browned on the bottom. I usually prefer chewier cookies, but crispy can be good, too! I have some of the dough saved and will try again, this time using a 12 min baking time.

Fantastic cookie! I added a extra egg and used 1 cup of peanut butter as suggested by other reviewers. I will not add the almond extract next time I make these, I didn’t care for the flavor in this particular cookie. It competes with the peanut butter taste, IMHO. Will definitely make these again!

Made as directed.  Had to bake for 9 minutes (maybe I made mine bigger - got 26 cookies). Truly love the flavour and always nice to have some whole wheat flour and oats, for a heartier snack.

I baked up the first pan as written and the cookie dough wouldn't hold together. enough to form and bake. Reviews were all over the place with changes so I added 1/4 c each PB and white flour, and more butter,  another duck egg, and when that didn't bring it together I added 2 T milk. That fixed it and they baked up much better. They do taste delish and hubs likes them alot. I was grossed out by the amount of fat in my hand as I formed them. BTW these were not too sweet as written. I used Kirkland Organic crunchy PB which has 2 gm sugar in 3 T. My Skippy has 3 gm sugar in 2 T. I would omit the wheat flour all together and replace it with whit

These cookies turned out so soft and chewy with just the right amount of peanut butter taste. Tip: If you spend a bit longer beating in the egg and vanilla in until it looks fluffy like buttercream I find that they turn out better.

I used a combination of flax flour, coconut flour and almond flour to replace the white and whole wheat flours. It made them less chewy than the time I followed the recipe, but still quite delicious. I  also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup each.

Go with the changes the "most helpful positive review" gave, and it's perfect. :) It took 10 min in my oven, and I let it cool on the parchment paper on the baking sheets for several minutes before moving them. I also flattened them a bit with a fork before putting them in the oven.

I admit I messed with the recipe a little! I followed Marian and went with one cup of brown sugar only, two eggs and 2 tsps of vanilla. Otherwise I followed Ruggles recipe as is. They are great! How could they not be? 2 of our favorite food groups, peanut butter and chocolate!

Excellent cookies. Followed suggestions to reduce sugar to 1/2 cup each of brown and white, as well as increase peanut butter to 1 cup and vanilla by half teaspoon. I also added some diced pecans,  maybe 1/2 cup.  Yum!

I made this recipe and was surprised by how quick and easy it was. My family devoured them warm right then and there, but I liked them even better cold the next morning! My tip would be making a double batch for a party; they disappeared within a day for a family of five.

Sooo delicious! I used natural unsweetened unsalted crunchy peanut butter and reduced the sugars by about one third. The result is great.  Best peanut butter cookies I have ever had.

These turned out pretty good. I reduced the amount of sugar though and it is still sweet to my taste. I will reduce even more next time. Thank you!

Made this recipe twice. First time I found 375 for 8min and the bottoms came out a little burnt. Fine for some but I can't chew them. Made it again @350 for 8min and they came out perfect.

these turned out pretty awesome, I think I got the measurements incorrect so I did what some of the others did and adjusted for the sugar, peanut butter, and AP flour because I didn't have wheat flour, so I didn't add the baking soda or powder, I used Quaker instant apple cinnamon sugar oatmeal but I didn't add the chocolate chips, this turned out Devine and thank you for the inspiration, I am really glad I found a good peanut butter receipe not too rich, tart or sugary.

Followed the suggested alterations, using 1/2 cup of each sugar, 2 eggs and 1 cup of peanut butter. Also used all AP flour, and instead of chocolate chips or chunks, I used peanut butter M&M's. Baked for 10-11 minutes. Phenomenal!!! Great with a large glass of milk.

I substituted almond butter for the peanut butter just because I had it and wanted to give it a try. I followed the rest of the recipe to a T. These cookies are great! Moist, chewy, full of flavor. Everyone who tried them went back for more. This is a keeper, no matter which butter  you use! Thanks.

Easy and delicious! I had everything on hand and was looking for something somewhat healthier than just a regular peanut butter cookie. These were perfect. I love the addition of oatmeal and whole wheat flour. Thanks for the recipe!

I have a sweet tooth but really have to watch my sugar intake, so I used a tablespoon of Stevia instead of white sugar, and only 1/4 cup of brown sugar and they were still good, and plenty sweet.  Didn't flatten much at all, and didn't stick together well once baked, but how can you go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate; am I right? ;-)  The flavor was still great and it's an easy recipe. Just wish I could have made it as directed and used real sugar. Still good, though.

Used 1 cup PB, 1/2 cup both sugars, 2 eggs, and added a hint if almond extract along with vanilla as previously suggested. 375 degrees in my oven was too hot.  I decreased the temp to 350 and baked extra minute or two.  My hungry farm boys said they were just an OK cookie.  But they were gone in 1 afternoon!  Oh by the way, they could not tell the sugar was decreased.

It was yummy I love it. But we had a hard time with the dough. It's dry to but it makes sense because it's peanut butter. Maybe if you could find a way to make it a little more moist I'd give it five stars. The cookie is soft and good. I give this good mark nice job.

Boyfriend approved! I read the reviews and decided to switch the measurements of brown sugar and white sugar and cook for 10 minutes. My own substitutes were out of necessity I only had half a cup of chocolate chips so the other half was peanut butter chips. I also only had chunky peanut butter. Next time I'll be sure to do the full chocolate. I also popped the oats into the blender for 10 seconds because I prefer the consistency. All in all these are a winner!

The cookies are great.  I sure wish you would specify on your recipes what size cookies a recipe makes; I doubled this one hoping to get 96 cookies and ended up getting only 48!!!!!  And these weren't HUGE cookies, 3 inches approximately.  To get 48 cookies from this recipe you would need to make them 1 inch or smaller!!!!!

Best cookie ever.  I used just 1 cup of palm sugar instead of the white and brown sugars, (I live in Bali, so palm sugar is pretty much a staple in my pantry), added 2 eggs instead of one.  I used my own homemade butter which I had made with coconut oil, so the cookie had a lovely subtle coconut taste that was just lovely.  Everything else I kept the same.  Was nice and crunchy from the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  BIG hit.

Everyone in my family loved these, I didn't change anything. THe dough itself was a little dry, but if I rolled it into balls and squished it it didn't fall apart when baking, and were chewy and moist when they were done. They were also largely approved by the teenage homeschool community, when I shared them with a large group of my friends. Definately will be making these again.

Oh my goodness this recipe is a life saver!! I don't need the cookies until later so I was just testing them to make sure they're what I want. And my goodness they were! They're slightly crispy on the outside but gooey on the inside! Just perfect!!

These are amazing cookies! I made no adjustments aside from adding 1 tbsp of cinnamon. What else can I say but Oh man are they good!

Great cookies!! I cut the sugar by 1/3, added an extra egg, increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp, increased the peanut butter to one cup and increased the oatmeal to 2/3 cup. 

We will make them again with a little less sugar and a little more oatmeal.

I loved these cookies! I did change the recipe based on previous reviews, 1/2 c sugar 1/2 c brown sugar and  used only white flour. Added only 1/2 c peanut butter. The cookies were great. The dough was a little flaky but squeezed together fine and the cookies do not change form much when baking so they were big and fat, yum!

These are not what I consider a traditional peanut butter cookie, but they are delicious with the addition of the oatmeal and chocolate. They were a big hit at my house.  Thanks for sharing your recipe,  Ruggles!

The dough does not hold together as is. I baked anyway, and the cookies fell apart. Luckily all the crumbs are actually really tasty, so I think I'll save them and sprinkle on ice cream or roll bananas in them

I love this recipe, but I alter it slightly. I use all white flour, only 3/4 cup oats and no chocolate chips. The baking time is perfect for a cookie the embodies both crunchy and chewy at the same time. I made them yesterday and they are already gone! They just disappear!

I cut the sugar in 1/2, and the only other change I made was substituting wheat bran for the whole wheat flour. I also refrigerated dough before baking.The cookies do need to cool, or they will crumble.  They are absolutely delicious.

Loved this recipe, really good. I used only AP flour, didn't have WW. Also along with the chocolate chips I added peanuts, about 1cup. Great result. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent cookie once I added an extra egg, 1/4 c.  peanut butter, and  1 to 2 tablespoons of water. I found after a bit of trial and error, 375 Greece for 10 minutes worked well. I gave each cookie one gentle press of the spoon before baking-no rolling was needed! OH!- this was for a double batch!! ????

These are awesome!  Changes for me were: 1/2 cups brown and granulated sugars, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 eggs and I blended the oats into a course flour. Baked 10-11 mins and they are perfect!

Simple recipe to follow. I used some all natural peanut butter so the taste wasn't as strong as I'd hoped but that's on me. Also, like others said the dough was a bit crumbly for me but after handling and putting in my mini-oven the cookies held and came out great.

Way too sweet.  I'd make them again, but i'd reduce the amount of sugar down to 1/2 cup per white & brown sugar.  Also the amount of semi-sweet chocolate chips can be reduced too.  After all these are Peanut Butter cookies.

These turned out well! The only adjustments I made were using only all purpose flour (because it's all I had), adding a smidge of almond extract, and of course doubling the recipe, because who ever makes a single batch of cookies? I will roll the extra dough into balls and freeze it for easy cookies later.  The best part of this recipe is the crispy outside but chewy inside... if you take them out at the right time!

These were OK, but I'm not too impressed. I followed previous reviewers' advice to reduce the sugars and leave sitting on the cookie tray a few minutes. Was too much peanut butter for my taste, and I like peanut butter.

I did as the recipe said and my cookies came out flat and rather burnt (because I put it in for longer because they weren't ready) and they're very crumbly. I tried picking one up and it broke to pieces. Why did this happen? It tastes good, it does, but the texture of the cookie let me down.

My husband describes these cookies as "devilishly delicious".  I made them as recipes states but added 1 tsp of cream of tartar to make the tips crack like store bought bakery cookies.  I also baked them for 12 minutes because I don't like my cookies raw in the middle.  They were perfect!

These cookies are fantastic! Daughter and husband both loved them. I substituted the 1/4 cup wheat flour for chocolate peanut butter protein powder and it was still great! No weird texture or anything! Next time I may do 1/2 and 1/2 protein powder/flour and maybe experiment with other substitutes, this recipe seems very adaptable.  Oh and I also used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.  Thanks for a great cookie!

Very good cookie. That being said, instead of 3\4 cup brown sugar and 3\4 cup white sugar, I used 1\2 cup brown, 1\4 cup yellow and 1\4 cup white sugars. I also left out the chocolate chips. Because of the sugar, I had to keep it in the oven for another 4 minutes. Turned out amazing.

Yum!  These cookies are SO delicious!  I made just a few changes: 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1/2 c white flour, 1/2 c white sugar, 1 c peanut butter.  I ended up with 2.5 dozen cookies that I rolled into small balls and flattened before baking for 13 minutes.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Ruggles!  It's a keeper!

these are excellent.  I used all white flour since I had no whole wheat and I did cut the sugar to 1/2 cup each.  I followed Grannyloohoo's suggestion of the almond extract and instead of chocolate used peanut butter.  I was in a really peanut buttery mood today.  :)  Great base recipe.  I'm sure that made as written they are fab also!

Great recipe! To make them Christmas festive, I rolled the dough balls in red or green sugar then baked. Right when they came out of the oven still in cookie sheet, I put one unwrapped Hershey's Kiss on top of each cookie. Then let each cookie cool for about 5 minutes before transferring to cooling rack. Yum!!!

This was by far my favorite peanut butter cookie on this site!  I used 1 cup of all purpose flour, as I did not have whole wheat flour on hand.  They were divine.  I used a pampered chef medium cookie scoop, and got 2 1/2 dozen cookies, so I must have made them much bigger than the original recipie.  They do not seem to spread very much, and I did not press them down, so they came out like delicious, soft and crumbly mounds.  I highly recommend this recipie!

I am not a big baker and have tried many recipes with peanut butter and chocolate chip. I didn't realize this was going to have oatmeal til I looked at the recipe. I cut the recipe in half and I added a little more chocolate chips and these were delicious! I made them for my husband who comes home Wednesday but i think I'll have to make another small batch before he comes home. I don't think these will last that long!

Made this recipe for my son and his friends.  They gobbled them all up, so I had to make more for my husband and I to sample.  We liked them too! I did reduce the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup, as the dough didn't want to bind with so many chips (in my opinion).  This recipe is a keeper, for sure!

Its good but its still your average peanut butter cookie.  I liked that I only needed to use 1/2 cup of butter.  Other recipes ask for 1 cup so that's why I gave it 4 stars.  Will use this one again.

I followed the suggestion to ad an extra egg, and to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup each. The cookies turned out perfect! My husband loves peanut butter cookies, but I don't like crumbly cookies. These cookies are a perfect match for us. I may need to double the recipe next time!

I followed the recipe as written and I would agree that it is too sweet as is; will consider making again and reducing the amount of sugar and possible re-rate again.

These cookies are delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as is.  It is important to let the cookies cool on the sheet before you move them; they will fall apart otherwise (learned the hard way).

These cookies are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but did have to use the "halved" quantities because I only wanted 24 cookies. I let the cookies rest on the cookie sheet for about 15 minutes before using the spatula to remove. They were not crumbly at all. I actually froze several little balls of cookie dough so that I can make a cookie for my grandson as he "needs" one (hehe). I read somewhere that all cookie doughs can be frozen...we shall see. Loved this cookie!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!! My family can't get enough of these cookies. I've made them several times in the past couple years and my husband recently said, "You're not getting away without making these cookies every year during the holiday season!" lol. They're very peanut buttery, soft on the inside, and a tad crisp on the outside. If I don't double the recipe... the 2 1/2 dozen that this recipe makes, disappears in 2 days or less! They're always the first to go. A Must try.. especially if you like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Its like that.. but in cookie form.

I loved that three of my family's favorite cookie ingredients were included so I tried this recipe. I'm also on a health kick right now so I tweaked it...but I promise they turned out great! I used spelt flour and used 1 cup of turbinado sugar instead of the other sugars.  I also used fresh ground peanut butter from the grocery store.  I used regular Quaker regular oatmeal but added a tablespoon of flaxmeal.  I had to bake for 10 minutes.  They are delicious!!!!  Melt in your mouth and don't even taste healthy!...probably from the fresh ground peanut butter....

I'd hoped these would taste more peanut buttery.  It may be because I elected to use up the rest of our salt/sugar-free PB (which made up about half of the total PB content).  Otherwise they turned out very well.

This recipe was pretty good.  Followed the recipe to a tee and mine took around 11 minutes to bake.  You definitely need to let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes.  They were crunchy but not chewy like some others had mentioned.  A little too sweet so if I make them again I'll probably cut back on the sugar.

Excellent taste and texture! I used all white whole wheat flour and left out the chocolate chips. I've never made peanut butter cookies with oats in them, but they gave the cookies a nice crunch on top of the chewy texture. This will definitely be my #1 peanut butter cookie recipe!

I have tried a lot of peanut butter cookie recipes over the year but this is my favourite so far! The only thing I changed was using 1/2 cup of vegetable shortening instead of butter and they turned out great. SOO yummy! I'm using this one from now on!

These were great. I used all whole wheat flour and cut back on the sugar just as suggested by others and we all loved them. It was a bit on the thick side so instead of making individual cookies I just made them into bars. They came out perfect.

This cookie was just what I was looking for.  I made it just as it said but will try the almond extract next time for I love almond flavoring.  I did add some walnuts to part of the batter.  I rolled in balls to bake but will try making bigger cookies the next time and I think they will be just as good.  Love Love Love them!!!

I just made these for my husband, and they are amazing! I cut the chocolate chips to 1/2 a cup and added just a spoonfull more peanut butter and I also went with AP flour because I didn't have whole wheat, they are yummy!

These were yummy, but so crumbly. They were very difficult to work with, and fell apart after baking. Very disappointing.

These cookies are very good.  I tweaked the recipe to have low sugar by using 1/2 cup splenda brown sugar mix and 1 cup regular splenda.  I increased the peanut butter (no sugar added) to 1 cup and decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp because I used salted butter.  The only complaint I have is that there is no way anyone would get 48 cookies out of this recipe.  I got 34 tablespoon size cookies.  Still, it is an excellent recipe and I would highly recommend!

Tons of compliments.  Just made a double batch to send with my husband and son for a trip to a men's retreat with a bus load of guys.  I didn't have brown sugar, so I substituted with more white sugar + molasses.  Tasted just the same.  I always double the batch and use 3 eggs instead of two.  Makes them wonderfully gooey and not dry.

These cookies are amazing! I had to make a couple changes. Sadly, we were out of chocolate chips, so I had to leave those out. Instead of 1/2 c of butter, I used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c applesauce. Then used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar a little over 1/4 c honey (I love PB/honey combo!). I also ended up stirring quite a bit more rolled oats once everything was mixed together. Maybe another 1/2 c, I didn't measure... just kept mixing till it looked as thick as I like it. I used a cookie scoop, then flattened each mound with a spatula. The cookies were perfect after 8min. I was able to get about 50 cookies, but they were pretty small. I think this batch barely lasted 48 hrs in our house. We will definitely be making these again! I don't even think I will add the choc chips. They were great w/o them!

These were exactly what I was looking for! I used natural peanut butter, and with the oats and whole wheat flour, they had a great texture and a delicious nutty flavor. I have one or two great cookie recipes that I make all the time, and it's rare that I find a new recipe that I like well enough to add to my repertoire, but I think I may have found one here.

The only change I made was to use all purpose flour instead of wheat flour. The cookies turned out perfectly and got rave reviews from everyone who tasted them. Great peanut butter flavor , oatmeal gave them a great texture. Will make these again.

These cookies are so good.  I reduced the sugars to 1/2 cup each and they were still sweet.  The texture is perfect.  Slightly chewy with crispy edges.  I had to increase baking time to 10 mins.

These cookies turned out fantastic!  I only made a few alterations to the recipes: reduced both sugars to half cup each as others suggested, I added an extra egg and extra peanut butter. I had to add a couple extra minutes cooking time because I used rounded tablespoons full so the recipe only really made 2 dozen for me!!

Make sure to only use about a tablespoon of batter for each cookie.  Otherwise, they are to soft to get off of the cookie sheet without squishing them.

Loved These Cookies!  I found it easier to roll the dough into balls instead of dropping by the spoonful.  The texture was also better.  I experimented with smushing them down with the palm of my hand and leaving them in round balls before baking.  I liked them BOTH!!  They had more of a traditional peanut butter cookie texture when smushed. :)   (I used 1/2 cup of each of the sugars, i figured my peanut butter was sweet enough)   I WILL be making again!

These cookies are absolutely phenomenal. I have never made PB cookies with chocolate chips, but these cookies are even better than I thought they would be. Even w/out chocolate chips, they make a great PB cookie. I am guilty of changing the recipe a tad per the previous messages of other reviewers, however. I used 1/2 cup more PB, 1/2 cup of each type of sugar (brown sugar was packed), 1 cup of All-Purpose flour (did not have any Whole-wheat flour), and 1/2 cup of rolled oats. My reason for putting in half of the oats was b/c I have never used oats in PB cookies before. I will try a whole cup of oats next time because This was the best cookie dough ever--so light, fluffy, and Peanut-buttery with the perfect consistency. After 8 minutes in a preheated oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit, these cookies were soft, gooey, melt-in-your-mouth good. I cannot stop eating them! My first batch was a little crumbly during the transfer from cookie sheet to cooling rack. I found that I just needed to wait about ten minutes for them to cool before taking them off of the cookie sheet. This may sound obvious, but I have gotten away with taking many a cookie off the cookie sheet after waiting only a minute or two for them to cool. Crumbly or not, these truly deserve 5 stars!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

These were suprisingly good! I followed the recipe exactly and had great results. My 1st batch was in the oven for 8 minutes but seemed slightly not done in the middle so the next batch I left in the oven for 10 minutes and got a perfect cookie. Not too hard, not too chewy. Just right and great with a glass of milk. I kept some leftover dough in the fridge for a couple days and that seemed to do fine.

Not only do these taste fantastic, but they don't require refrigeration before baking, which I never have the patience for. They are still great with whole wheat flour and other figure friendly alterations I tend to make.

FANTASTIC cookies! I followed another reviewers recommendation and used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour. Also cut sugar to 1/2 cup of each white and brown. Finally, used natural peanut butter and mini unsweetened chocolate chips. They came out great and you can even freeze the dough and bake them later...

I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing! I found that the best way to tell that these are done is to wait until the top just barely starts to crack. Don't depend on color or they will be overdone.

Off the chain! Best pb cookie to date, buttery crisp. I used all white all purpose flour since i didn't have wheat, and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp and used trader joe's creamy unsalted pb, quaker quick oats and ghiradelli semi-sweet chips. They may be even better the next day than fresh out of the oven. Mmm-yeah.

An excellent recipe!  Soft inside, crunchy on the outside.  Nice oat and whole wheat flavour.
Like to bake at 325 for 9-10min, maybe it's my oven.

AMAZING!!!!  These cookies were so good that I wish I could give them 10 stars!!  I did add two eggs only because I like a little more of a "fluffy" cookie and I also blended the oatmeal in the blender.  Otherwise, they are TERRIFIC!!  The second time I made them I used Dark Chocolate Chips and liked them even better!

I think these are going to be my all time favorite cookies! They are outstanding. I followed the directions exactly, except I used 1/2 c of each sugar. The dough came out crumbly but I just rolled it into a ball and had to press them down on the cookie sheet. Next batch, I will roll them and press them with a fork. They didn't spread at all. I wonder if I use reduced fat PB if the texture would change at all?
I used Trader Joes all Natural Salted PB so I think next time I will use 1/4 tsp of salt instead of the 1/2 tsp. I used unsalted butter and Old Fashioned Oats. They came out cripsy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I baked these for about 11 mins on 375. 
 My husband would not stop making "mmm" noises with every bite. Even the next day he said they were the best cookies ever!  I just realized that I used baking powder instead of baking soda and they still tasted good...
**UPDATE: I just made these again for a work party and I used Baking Soda, 1/2 c of each sugar and Reduced Fat Jif PB. I also left the butter at room temp for the whole day, I then mixed the oats with the flour and added it to the cream mixture, then I mixed in the chocolate chips. This time the dough was just like Toll house cookie dough and it was easy to spoon on the pan. They came out nice and flat, but still soft and chewy.

I made these today. My oldest son came in as they were cooling and ate 4-6 commenting "Boy these are really good!". I made a couple of variations to the recipe: used all purpose flour; decreased the white & brown sugar down to 1/2 cup each; used margarine instead of butter. Made them bigger on the cookie sheet and baked for 10-12 mins. They are really good cookies and will be making them again. Thanks for the recipe.

I substituted soybean butter for the peanut butter because of peanut allergies in the family, and used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour & 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  Delicious!

Still giving these 5 stars even though the dough was SO dry and crumbly! I had to make them into balls by hand and even in dough form they still kind of fell apart. But the end result was SO good, it was worth it. I broke up a bar or milk chocolate so I had big chunks of chocolate. I felt like I didn't need to add the oatmeal, it was so dry, but did anyway. I put it in the blender first as other reviews advised. These didn't make 48, but rather 24, so I guess you have to double the calorie count. Still, will make these again because they were so good, everyone loved them. Had to bake a bit longer, more like 12 mins.

These cookies are a definite keeper.  When you take them out of the oven they are very gooey.  Let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute and they'll "harden" enough so they don't end up mush by the time you get them transferred to the cooling rack.  These produce a really nice shaped cookie that is delicious to boot!  They'd be great for a bake sale.  Thanks!

Great cookies! No need to use the wheat flour - 1 c. of reg flour is fine. For a little variety, sometimes substitute smooth peanut butter for chunky style peanut butter.

Wonderful! However, I added about 1 tsp. of cinnamon, which I believe made these much more interesting. They were best while still warm - after cooling, they became more crispy. Overall, great different recipe.

The mix of chocolate and peanut butter is just right, but it was a little too sweet for my taste - I think next time maybe I'll use half the sugar.

This is a very good recipe.  The cookies are easy to make and yummy, too.  The peanut butter flavor comes through clearly, while the chocolate chips add a nice touch.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and had no problems.  The dough was a bit crumbly, but I simply squeezed it with my fingers and it stayed together nicely.  I loved the fact that these cookies stay thick and brown nicely.  My husband even enjoyed them, and he does not like peanut butter cookies usually.

Yummy cookies that everyone liked.  I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I just increased the regular flour and it was fine.  They didn't spread out as much as I toll house like cookies, but I squashed them down a little and they were great!

Great flavor, but I found them to be dry. The dough crumbled when I put them on the cookie sheet. I also thought the cookies tasted dry. I used regular oats. If I tried them again I would decreased the oats to see if they would be more moist.

I had no whole wheat flour OR oatmeal, so I substituted 1.5 C all-purpose flour, plus 1/2 C wheat germ. The wheat germ gave the cookies that same grainy texture as the oatmeal does (if you blend your oatmeal first). This was a GREAT cookie! Some said they used less sugar--I used the recommended amounts in the recipe, and the cookies were GREAT! Also, I DID get the 4 dozen cookies the recipe calls for, unlike some reviewers who came up short. Maybe I just make my cookies smaller. The difference I found was that my cookies took 10-11 minutes to bake completely, as opposed to 8 minutes as stated in the recipe. Can't stop eating these...I will make them again...can't wait to try them with the proper ingredients!

These just were not all that good.  A little dry and bland.  I added chocolate chips and it didn't help.  My husband brought them to work though, and everyone ate them there so maybe its just me.  But either way, I'll never make these again.

After mixting the butters and the sugars let it mix for a min. straight. the recipe is easy to follow. there are some ingredients that you wont have in your kitchen. you have to stir in the chocolate chips and not let them mix in the blender because they wont mix very well.The cookies were good they tasted like peanut butter cookie. They were hard but soft and chewy. When letting it bake let bake for 8 to 10 mins for they all could cook at the same time.

I have packed away my cook books and found myself in need of a peanut butter choc. chip cookie recipe, this is similar to the one I would make, a little too sweet for me, but a nice and easy recipe to follow.

This recipe was great.  I changed it just a little bit.  I reduced both sugars to 1/2 cup, increased the all-purpose flour to 1 cup, omitted the whole wheat flour, and ran the cup of oats through the blender before adding.  The dough is kind of crumbly so I just rolled it into a small balls and squished it down a little with my fingers.  Great recipe!

It was a hit in this house.  I used less white sugar (1/2c) and used mini-chocolate chips.  I will try mini-m&m's next time.

These cookies are pretty good.  I followed other suggestions and decreased the sugars and increased the peanut butter, probably by about 1/4 cup each.  I increased the flour a little bit to compensate for extra peanut butter.  These cookies taste good but the dough was very crumbly, no way I could have dropped them on the cookie sheet, I had to press into balls then flatten a little.  I also added peanut butter chipes and chocolate chips to mine.  Overall they were OK, don't know if I would make again.

These cookies were loved by all.  The oats add a little more texture than you regularly find in a peanut butter cookie. I will make them often.
