I really like this for an afternoon pick me up.  The flavor is great but next time I will add just a bit less sugar, I found it a tad too sweet for my tastes.

5.5.16   The Thai ice tea that I’ve had always has layers of color, dark tea on the bottom, topped with the milk.  You stir in the evaporated milk with the sugar on this one, so it’s all one-color, but that’s not to say that it’s not good (it is).
