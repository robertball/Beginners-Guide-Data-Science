The cake came out dense and moist.  I used lemon curd instead of pie filling- my store didn't have it.   Instead of vanilla I subbed lemon extract- I have a boy that LOVES  lemon. Really good cake!

This was delicious and great for a crowd since it is a sheet cake. I could not find the 18.25 ounce cake mix so I used a 15.25 and just added a couple of tablespoons of flour. I also added a little lemon juice along with everything else for the frosting. I will definitely be making this again.

This was so easy to make and so delicious to eat.  I did bake the cake for five extra minutes—at 20 minutes, it did not appear baked through to me.

Simple to make,  excellent to take to a church dinner or picnic.  Tastes even better chilled from the fridge the next day.

Tasty and easy!  Great lemon flavors and turns a box mix into a fancy desert.  I used "cup" cupcake molds.  Nice recipe in a pinch!  I will make this again.
