i am so, so sorry to put a bad review out there.  i made this thinking i couldn't go wrong with two of my fav. things in the world--spinach and jalapenos.  there just aren't any words to describe how foul this was and i can't think of any ingredients to make it *right*.  i made the recipe exactly as written, took it to a fancy family dinner, and threw all the leftovers away (there was a LOT b/c no one ate it).  the flavors did not meld one bit.  it seriously tasted like taking a bite of spinach, then biting into a jalapeno.  good luck to you if you decide to make this one!

I very successfully converted this recipe into a dip by 1) doubling everything but the spinach (which makes it much creamier; more like a sauce than a side dish) and 2) leaving out the breadcrumbs.  It was a *huge* hit at the dinner party: first thing gone, and I had folks asking if I had any more.

I've used a similar recipe for years with raves from friends/family (a holiday favorite).  I used to use the Kraft 6oz roll of jalepeno cheese (instead of pepperjack) but can't find it anymore.  I've taken to substituting jalepeno cheese whiz. This recipe stretches just by adding more spinach.  It is really best if refrigerated overnight for the flavors to blend.  It also freezes.

This recipe was awesome!  I used 1/2 fresh minced onion, 2% milk, and cubed my cheese (no grater).  It paired really nice with salmon and carrots.  I am never buying premade creamed spinach again!

Update: Tried again only subbing motzerella and a scotch bonnet pepper.... Yum

Made this twice. First time I followed the recipe as-is and really enjoyed the outcome.   Second time, I substituted Gruyere cheese and added pepper flakes instead of the pepper jack cheese. It was a creamier and smoother mixture.   I also substituted about a 1/4 of the spinach for mustard greens to give it a bit more of a bite. That tasted really good when it was a fresh dish but the mustard greens had lost too much of their flavor in the left-overs.

Great recipe!  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I did not use the jalapeno pepper and used both grated monterey and grated pepperjack cheese as not everyone in my family is a fan of very hot dishes.  But when I make it next for myself I will add the jalapeno

This was was a great and easy dish. I used an onion roll for the bread crumbs and it added a nice flavor. The jalepeno i used was pretty big, so this dish left an impact on my tongue! It was perfect for my husband and I who both love spicy stuff. He suggested that it might be good with tortilla chips - like a spinach dip. I'll prbly try with the leftovers - what little there are!

This is a really delicious way to eat spinach! I agree with others who say it's more like a dip than a side dish. Next time I make it, I'll add more jalapenos too, as the creaminess dulled down the spice (I like it hot!) I'll definitely be making this again.

Very good!  The crumb topping was WAY too much, and it's definately better as a dip than an actual side dish.  Mine was SPICY! and delish!

I almost didn't try this after reading the only other review but I really liked the ingredients so decided to give it a try.  I did add one more jalapeno and a bit more cheese than called for.  I thought that it was a great side dish.  I will make it again.

This exact recipe has been around for eons, aka Spinach Madeline, and is one of my top 5 favorite foods.  You can also use fresh spinach; just use a little more evaporated milk and eyeball it so it isn't too soupy.  I never use bread crumbs, just because they aren't necessary.

This is SO good and easy!  I follow the directions as stated but if I have a red bell pepper on hand I love to finely chop one up and add it in with the onion and pepper.  It adds a nice color contrast.  Also, I've tried using many types of cheese in this dish and they all seem to work great.  My latest version had mozzarella and feta and it got rave reviews at Christmas dinner!

I was hoping that this recipe would be good, but unfortunately cannot give a better review. I can't pinpoint what was wrong with it, other than the overall taste was off. I made it for a family dinner, and although a couple people said they liked it, others couldn't get it down.

This is one of my (and my husband's) favorite side dishes on this site.  Soooo tasty!  Even my kids brave the spiciness to try it. I usually use a pile of deli sliced jalapenos from a jar instead of a fresh one, just because I like the taste.  And sometimes I experiment with different cheeses.  But it always comes out great!

This was a great sidedish for Christmas dinner (roast tenderloin with bearnaise sauce, deep fried turkey.....) I used 2 big bags of fresh spinach, half & half and added a little extra jalapeno.  Delish!

Loved this recipe.  This was the real winner this Thanksgiving.  I doubled this recipe and it worked out well.  I used fresh spinach and 2% evaporated milk.  I also did not have the celery salt and used regular instead.  My picky husband really enjoyed this the most.  I will be serving this again.

I doubled the amount of spinach but forgot to increase the liquids.  I omitted the jalapeños because my son can't eat them.  It had a good flavor though, which we enjoyed.

I accidently purchased fresh spinach; therefore, used fresh spinach....and it was a little runny, but still good. 
Can't wait to try with frozen spinach :)

My husband, who is a great fan of creamed spinach, was disappointed with this recipe.  However, my stepson liked it so much he asked for the recipe.  It's more of a spinach casserole than creamed spinach, but quite tasty.

This was just okay, but had potential.  I left the crumbly topping off, and in the future will probably continue to do this and just craft it into more of a dip as others have suggested.  I'm thinking of trying to incorporate it into some sort of ravioli filling, also.

Tasty, but way too greasy and fattening.  There must be a way to cut some butter and calories.  A little more time consuming than most creamed spinach dishes.

My husband really enjoyed this.  I added a seeded tomato to the spinach because I had one I needed to use; it gave it nice color.  I also used plain monteray jack cheese instead of pepper jack to be sure it wasn't too spicy.

Good recipe.  After making this a few times I decided to experiment by switching out the crumb topping with Parmesan on top before baking.   We liked it a lot better.

This was a delicious side dish for dinner tonight.  My cooked spinach did not yield a 1/2 cup of liquid so I had to add more milk to make the 3/4 cup necessary.  I had decided before starting not to add a jalapeno because I was afraid the pepper jack cheese would be hot enough.  In the end it was not.  I used Panko bread crumbs instead of regular.  I'm glad I found this recipe and probably will be making it again.  Thanks!

I have made this recipe for Thanksgiving and other special occasions for many years. I love it -- the jalapeno gives it a kick that is a wonderful surprise for those who have never tried it before. It really complements a roast turkey dinner. The recipe I have calls for two packages of spinach and 1/2 cup evaporated milk -- otherwise, it is pretty much the same. I have also substituted pepper jack cheese in this recipe with success. I use a full 8 oz. block. I don't do the bread crumbs and I use sea salt instead of celery salt, and it turns out fine. This is a superb and easy side dish.

It's spicy. Probably not good for a toddler or younger child. What is extra nice about this is the spinich is creamed but you can still taste the spinich. It's not creamed to death! Worth it!

This is the best for MY spicy taste for sure!  I did adjust it somewhat.  I cut up half of a larger onion, doubled the evaporated milk to 1/2 cup, used 1 full cup of cubed pepper jack cheese, and omitted the bread crumbs (because I didn't have any).  I will try it next time with them.  I also omitted the jalapenos - glad I did because it was perfectly spicy.  Next time I will double the recipe to have more!!!! I will make a great dip too!

This was tastey, but I think it would be better as a dip than a side dish--too rich.

I made this a couple of weeks ago and it was really really good.  I used a bit of skim milk since I didn't have evaporated milk and even added some ground red pepper.  My husband really dislikes spinach but he was happy to eat this dish.  I think I used it as a side with perogies.

This was so yummy, yet so easy.  My fiance was very impressed with it!!  I will definitely make this again - and would like to try it as a dip as well.
