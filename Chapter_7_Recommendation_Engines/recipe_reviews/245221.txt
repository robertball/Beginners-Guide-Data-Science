My husband picked this from the magazine, though he is usually a meat and potatoes kind of guy. I ordered wild rice special from the Great Lakes area. Followed Elise's recipe almost exactly, trying sourdough bread crumbs and prepping the batter the night before, moist but not really wet.  I tried to use my waffle plates on the combo grill, because some folks had been saying the fritters fell apart. It fell apart in the waffle iron too, but was nicely browned on the edges.
Added a small dollop of creme fraiche and a touch of dried tarragon and I'll tell you what, it stood up to the heavily seasoned steak my hubby grills! Even crumbly as mine was, it would have made an impressive stuffing for maybe a cornish game hen! 
With a nutty flavor this was something different that we both enjoyed.

This was a huge disappointment.  I really wanted to like it.  I am always looking for fun, savory uses for zucchini, rather than bread or muffins.  This one sounded healthy, and different.  It made a huge  mess on my stove, was a lot of work, and just bland.  The second half, I added some parmesan cheese (about 1-2 tablespoons) and about 1/4 cup of mozzarella, hoping to make them stick together.  Also added some herbs to up the flavor.  Then I baked them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes, flipped them and baked another 20 to 25.  FINALLY, they stuck together.  But still rather bland.  Maybe a bit of garlic and cayenne would have helped.

This recipe was in Allrecipes magazine by Ms Ballard.  It did not contain baking soda.  It was very bland and I really can't recommend it.  Perhaps some garlic, Parmesan cheese and bit of flour would help it hold together and have a taste beyond bland.  It is very good looking with some pimentos and parsley  added.   The hazelnuts were expensive and added no taste, but a nice crunch.  I'm glad I test drove it, before serving it to guests. I think I'll add it to a casserole for filler rather than dispense  those great ingredients.  It just didn't have the taste to match  its presentation.

The fritters would not hold together when I put them in the pan.  Also did not like the hazelnuts.  threw the rest away.

Unlike the others, we really liked the taste. The hazelnuts added a wonderful flavor. However, the fritters kept falling apart. The second time I tried them, I drained the zucchini overnight and dried them a bit in the microwave. I also added less milk and egg and again, they wouldn't hold.

The magazine didn't include the backing soda.  This was really really bland.  I was thinking more onion, maybe some green peppers, a little red pepper flakes.  Anything to give it some flavor. Parmesan cheese  and garlic would be a great additive.  I would try this again with some major changes.

I saw this in the magazine and decided to give it a try.  It was a lot of work but they were delicious according to one teen and three adults.  I agree with the other reviewers that they need more flavor. Next time I'll throw in some garlic powder and maybe a little more salt and pepper.
