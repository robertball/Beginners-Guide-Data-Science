This was very good I ve been cooking for almost 50 years so could adapt the recipe. My changes: 2 cups of milk 3 eggs. I used about 2 cups of Swiss cheese. I made 3 layers of bread leeks bacon & cheese in a 9x9 pan. Baked 30 at 400. Turned out nicely & was very tasty!

I added an extra egg and an extra 1/2 cup milk and about 1/2 cup more cheese. It was very tasty. I will make it again. Maybe next time I would add some sauteed mushrooms.
