You need to wash the collard greens really good or you can use canned or frozen. I added Jalape√±o peepers too.

Very yummy !!!   I agree, probably not as much water as this called for, but other than that, delicious !!  Thank you so much for sharing this...we are looking for more vegetables to add to our diet, and collard greens are supposed to be a wonderful source of vitamins !

If you're a greens lover, this is fantastic!  One side note, i found that i only needed to add about 1/2 c of water, maybe because the amt of greens i used was a bit less?

I had leftover collard greens from Thanksgiving that were waaaayyy to spicy and I wanted a way to use them; not throw them away and this recipe was my answer. I used no-salt canned tomatoes and white beans and added onions since mine did not have many. I omitted the rest of the seasonings since my collards had plenty of flavoring. I then added broth and water and turned this into a soup. This is definitely a recipe that can be used with leftovers. Great idea! Thanks for sharing!

I used mixed greens, fresh tomatoes, beef broth and added sweet red peppers, black and green olives and marinated artichoke hearts and oregano, basil and thyme. Squeezed lemon juice over it when it was done and then drizzled olive oil to add some richness. Served with a Mediterranean quinoa and a glass of Pinot Grigio. Delish!

insaneley easey and delish!!! i mean who would think you could actually like collard greens or white beans for that matter! to wash the collards though i highly reccomend filling a sink with water and letting em soak for an hour to make sure all the grit is removed. you'll be amazed by how much sand are trapped in these leaves!

This was a good way to eat collards.  I sauteed my onions and garlic in olive oil rather than water, and I only used 1/2 a cup of water after that.  It was plenty.  I also left out the bouillon.

I didn't find this recipe fast as suggested. It took over 30 minutes of cooking plus preparation for a side dish. I followed the recipe exactly except I used an equal amount of frozen collards. For some reason after all of the cooking time, I felt the collards still had quite a bit of a bite to them. I guess, I will only use fresh from now on. I never tried the frozen before. After it was done, it badly needed salt of some kind. I had some Adobo seasoning on my stove so I sprinkled some on. It wasn't bad, but not a repeat a recipe. Just missing the texture and flavor for me. However, a nutritionist would give this 2 thumbs up.

It was surprisingly good.  I didn't have the vegan bouillon so I used a Knorr bouillon. It was perfect. Doubling the recipe next time.

This was a tasty and healthy side for pork chops.  A few minor changes:  I used a 1lb. bag of chopped fresh collards and used a 1/2 c. of chicken broth to replace the water and bouillon cube. Ohtherwise, followed it to a T!  Flavorful, healthy, and easy makes this a recipe for the file.  Everyone loved this!  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious!  Used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon cubes, and used 1 can of Cannellini beans + 1 can of black beans.  My family of picky eaters inhaled this!

This was excellent! I do agree with adding less water. I used canned collard greens and added real bacon bits. Our family is far from being vegan.  I would recommend this recipe. I was concerned about the 3 tablespoons of garlic and all the onion. It was really strong cooking it in the beginning before adding the rest of the ingredients. It was a perfect blend of flavors!

This was so incredibly delicious!! After I ate this, I felt so like I had so much more energy to think and do everything I needed to.  I made it for my husband when he was not feeling well and we both felt so much better, more energized, and happier afterwards. I think it was a good, healthy meal that gave our bodies much more energy to heal!  I'd definitely recommend it.  I would say it needed more salt(try sea salt! It's great.), and I also added McCormick's Garlic Salt to it after, which really added to the taste.

I loved this!  Like others, I cut the water (I probably only used about 1/4 cup).  I also skipped the bouillon cube and used two fresh tomatoes instead of a can of diced tomatoes.  With a dash of salt, a generous grinding of black pepper, and the 1 tsp of sugar -- this was a fantastic side dish!

We used black-eyed peas instead of northern beans, It was delicious! It's the first time we've had greens since we gave up pork, because we thought it would be gross without the meat products. I actually think it was better this way!!! Thanks!

Wonderful veggie dish for the collards my Farm Fresh to You   order contained.  I had to sub kidney beans for the white or Great Northern I prefer because that's what I had.

This was a very satisfying dish for this vegan.  The only thing I added to the recipe was a sprinkle of ground red pepper.  I served the Collard Greens with White Beans along side couscous and Buffalo Wings by Morningstar Farms.  I will definitely make this again!

I make this dish for the holidays pretty frequently and it is a favorite, but I make a few changes.  I use oil to cook the onion and garlic.  I use tomatoes with peppers instead of plain tomatoes.  And I finish off the dish with just a sprinkle of smoked Gouda- which gives it a touch of smokiness and makes the dish a little heartier.

Delicious!  The only changes I made were using broth instead of water, leaving the beans out (only because we had navy bean soup for lunch that day).  In the future I won't use as many onions, and I'll add a few more collards, as I thought it was a lot of tomatoes for the dish.  This is another way to eat collard greens that is completely different than my usual  - 7 minutes in the pressure cooker with a little olive oil and sea salt.

this was really yummy! Reminded me of something my grandma used to make when I was a little girl. Instead of using all the water I just use one can that I got from the canned tomatoes and it turned out wonderful thank you for sharing!

Wonderful! How am I, 30-years a vegetarian, just now discovering the flavor and texture and affordability and how to prepare collard greens? Don't be afraid, just try this recipe. The ingedients combine for a unique, memorable meal. Yes, I parsed the liquid until greens were cooked al dente; also added some chopped jalapenos and used high-protein cannelloni beans. A great entree and definitely a take-to dish.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe.  I followed the recipe with two minor exceptions: I used chicken bouillon because that is what I had on hand and also reduced the amount of water (used about 3/4 cup).  The recipe was fantastic and the leftovers were even great the next day.
