This was good. there is no need to boil the potatoes first because they will cook through when covered for the 45 minutes directed. I had to take off the lid to firm up the crust before serving and raise the temperature to 400. I served with warm blueberry muffins and it made a delicious and filling meal.

This is the best.  It just needs some scrambled eggs on top.  It is perfect for my family because one of my little boys is allergic to eggs.  Thank you for this yummy recipe.

Nice recipe all by itself but it reminds me a lot of breakfast. For a layer of eggs and topped off by biscuits, it has all the ingredients for a breakfast cassarole. I'll have a glass of V-8 please.

Excellent!! Easy to make and great for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

I was skeptical, but even my husband enjoyed this one (and he can be kind of harsh on new recipes!).  I had a bunch of left over cooked sausage from the weekend which I chopped up and placed over the potato layer.  I followed the rest of the recipe pretty close to how it was written, but added some extra spices (cajun blend) to the sauce.  This was a great hearty meal and I bet it would be awesome with all pork sausage crumbled in it.  A very yummy and versatile brunch or dinner!

This was a GREAT recipe! It was very filling! To my surprise my husband and daughter loved it and want me to make it again! I added more potatoes (about 1-2 cups more) and more cheese (about 3-4 cups total)and cooked it in a 9X13 class cassarole dish covered with tin foil. I couldn't be more pleased, thank you for sharing.

Good recipe- made for my husband even though I don't typically like sausage, but it has enough flavor that I enjoyed it as well.  Agree with other reviewers, no need to boil potatoes ahead of time.  I even added some peppers and onions for added flavor.

My family loved this!!  I even added an extra pound of sausage and there wasn't a leftover found.  It reminded me a breakfast casserole without the eggs.  Next time I will make scrambled eggs and biscuits to go with it.  Great recipe.

I've made this a few times and I think I like it best with 1/2 of the saucy topping and a little more grated cheese. It's a great breakfast dish for those who can't eat eggs. I also tried substituting brown rice for the potatoes, delish!

I used turkey sausage instead of pork, diced celery along with the onion, (also used Smart Balance margarine, skim milk, and fat free cheese) and kept everything else the same.  This was not pretty, but it was quite good!  My family asked me to make it again. Thanks!

This was pretty good.  Not super dooper fabulous but good.  Very simple to make, good for dinner or breakfast.  I followed the recipe exactly other than adding a bunch of fresh mushrooms.  I would also add a bell pepper next time I make this.   I would make it again.

Very good!! We added a little green bell pepper (cooked it with onion and sausage) and also used thawed hashbrowns (only baked for 30 min) It was much better than I even expected. Will make again for sure!

It needs a little more as far as seasonings go, but other than that it was a success. I'm sure I'll be using it again.
*EDIT*
I forgot to mention that I served it topped with scrambled eggs with cheese, YUM!

This made for a savory dinner paired with green beans.  I love that it could be used as dinner or breakfast food.  I made the recipe as is and I don't think I would change a thing.

Absolutely delicious. I didn't change a thing when I made it and it turned out fantastic. I made it for a brunch and it was gone in seconds. Definitely a keeper.

I'm not really sure how to rate this, I liked it but I thought it would have been better all mixed together instead of layered. It was very filling. I only used 1 1/2 cups milk and had to swap out smoked sausage for the rolled pork sausage, only because I couldn't find the rolled one in my fridge! Served with scrambled eggs. Not sure if I would ever take the time to make it again though.

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and didn't boil the potatoes - I thought it took a little longer to get the potatoes just right in the over, but otherwise I followed the recipe and this was delicious.  My boyfriend and I both took left overs for lunch the next day and it was just as good reheated!

This was delicious, but based on other reviews, I added to it.  First, I used both mozzarella and cheddar cheeses, and used a little more than the recipe called for.  After it cooked for about 30 minutes I added some eggs scrambled with basil on top.  Then, I added a can of refrigerated biscuits and put the whole thing back in the oven for 18 minutes.  It was sooooo good and I will definitely make it again!

This was good. The potatoes were nice and tender but the sauce lacked any sort of flavor. I guess I am used to sausage gravy. I will use that nixt time. Thanks for the recipe. My picky 6 year old loved it and even asked for seconds. I will make this for Sunday School. They will love it

This was great.I made it for my neices birthday party and eveyone loved it. Used hot sausage for a kick, made all in a pot on the stove, and then put in the crock pot for 1 hour on low. I did cook potatos first since I did not put in oven. Will make again and again.

MMMMMM...YumYum!!!  I didn't have cheddar so I used swiss cheese.  Also, I cut up some fresh mushrooms, put them on top and added some extra swiss on top.  My hubby gave me millions of extra kisses for the wonderful breakfast.  That was even better than the breakfast ;-)

A new favorite in our house!  I didn't bother boiling the potatoes, I just sliced them thin and layered them in the bottom of the pan, scallop style.  I used kielbasa as that was what I had on hand (turkey once and chicken the second time), and my hubby LOVED the dinner!  Thanks so much for the super easy dish that we all love and will make many times over!

This was an excellent quick and easy meal, and a nice alternative to potatoes au gratin. I used the slicer on my kitchenaid to cut the potatoes. I also cheated a bit on the sausage and added a few tablespoons of flour directly to the sausage after it was cooked, then simply poured the milk in to make a sauce (like sausage&gravy for biscuits). I used hot italian sausage (omitted the salt & pepper) and added some mozzarella and grated parm instead of cheddar. I added less than a cup, just enough for flavor. Its much healthier and you don't need the butter, even with really lean sausage, and it was still delicious. Even for my finicky husband who took 2nd helpings! This is definitely going to be on the menu again!

This is my go to recipe in the winter for a hearty dinner serve with green beans or for a great breakfast/brunch serve with scrambled eggs.

My family really liked this. I actually used 1 lb. of pork sausage and about 1/2 lb. of hamburger because I had used a few more potatoes. They commented on how good it really was. Will make again.

This was a super recipe for us to use up some ground pork we had.  It was very good, and I typically don't even like ground pork.

Very rich dish.  I boiled the potatoes til tender and then reduced the baking time down to 20 minutes since everything was already pre-cooked, just needed to heat it through.  Boil the potatoes in salted water, they needed some salt. I think stirring all ingredients together, rather than layering them, might be better.

Yummmm!  I used kielbasa, cut it up and fried it with about 3 onions.  I also sliced and boiled the potatoes for 5 minutes.  Assembled the whole shebang, covered, cooked for 40 minutes and this was one easy, awesome, stick to your ribs, meal.  Ohhh and I used about 3-4 cups of cheese (hmmm, maybe that's why it tasted so good), I put some potatoes down, cheese, more potatoes, and than more cheese, the sausage and friend onions, and sauce.

I've been sick so can't taste much but from what I could taste this was good. The BF really liked it, he cleaned the dish, no leftovers! I didn't make any changes.

Nice, quick with a food processor and tasty. Very rich. Nice breakfast casserole when you want something savory without eggs.

I used sweet Italian sausage with this, and we all loved it.
