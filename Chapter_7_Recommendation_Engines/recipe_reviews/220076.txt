Great Recipe !!!                    
Made some modifications to "kick it up a notch". I added 6 oz. of tomato paste instead of 2 tablespoons, Added 3/4 cup of Worcestershire Sauce. In addition to the 2 tablespoons of chili power I added 1 envelop of Chili Seasoning. "Man -O - Man Was It Good". My family and Iloved it. I will be making MVP Chili from now on throughoutthe winter and as we watch our favorite sports teams !!!!!!!

Made a tomato based pasta sauce with italian sausage and only half of the family cared for it, so I decided to use the leftover sauce to make chili.  I'm happy to have found this recipe, I just added the missing ingredients.  I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and since I used mild johnsonville sausage I adjusted the seasonings so added a bit more chili and cumin as well.

I cooked this Chili tonight with a few changes. I added sugar, cinnamon, yellow curry, and ginger. Omitted black pepper and used sea salt. It was very delish. I also used turkey ground meat and one link of beef sausage.

Had to change a little bit- added the packet of chili seasoning, went ahead and threw the whole can of tomato paste in, and other than that, added cayenne pepper to spruce it up a bit more.  It's a decent quick chili!

What a great recipe-I used light beer since it's all I had on hand, and it was really good.  No black beans for us, so omitted them, but the sausage really added a new and different taste to the usual chili we have. I also loved the addition of the corn.

It was ok. Followed recipe exactly. Did not remind me of chili. More like a pizza sauce in a bowl but not as red. Went well with some fritos. Probably will not be making this again.

Followed this to the letter EXCEPT used ground beef instead of sausage. It was mild, perfect for smaller kids, but excellent. Also slow cooked it for 5 hours. Finally, a purpose for corporate beer.

This is a great recipe! I used it as is to a point, I didn't use any of the beans ( personal taste ) and the beer I used was bud light. To the people who don't like to use beer, it was only a high note you could taste. The dish was so amazing! So I would advise this recipe for someone who wants a good meal !

I can only give this a 4 because while this is my basic go to chili recipe I do thinks a tiny bit different.  I use 1 pkg hot and one pkg mild sausage, I saute 1 finely chopped carrot and 1 finely chopped stalk celery (figure I have to sneak in all the veggies I can), I used diced tomatoes, 1 can plain and 1 can with chilies, and always add a lot of fresh ground pepper.  I bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer and let it go for up to 2 hours.  If i have time, make a day ahead, because always better the second day.

This was very tasty. I did change it a little. I needed a large batch of chili so I used 2lbs Johnsonville Ground Mild Italian sausage and 1lb of ground beef. Went a little heavier on the spices. I also was out of black beans so I just used kidney beans. And I left out the corn. Personal preference. Very good chili. My family loved this.

I made some significant modifications to this to suit our taste and my review is based on those changes. I added 1 pound of ground beef in addition to the hot Italian sausage for a meatier chili. The directions don't mention this but you'll want to be sure to drain off as much grease possible after you brown the meat. I upped the amount of cumin to 1 teaspoon. I also omitted the tomato paste and instead added a 14 ounce can of tomato sauce. I was concerned the consistency would be very thin and liquidy with the addition of an entire bottle of beer and the tomato sauce adds some body. Most importantly, after everything is added, I brought the temp up to bring it to a boil then lowered the temp, covered the pot, and let it simmer for an hour to allow the flavors to blend, cook off a bit of the alcohol, and help the sauce thicken. It was VERY good with these changes and I'd definitely make it again. The Italian sausage adds great flavor!

This is a very good recipe and reminiscent of the chili Mom made for us growing up.  I tripled the recipe but substitute half of the Italian sausage with ground chuck, mixed both ingredients together well before browning. I also increased the amount of chili powder and ground cumin (as suggested) and kicked it up the flavor a little more with a pinch of cayenne pepper. Works well in the freezer too so you can make a little extra and have some that can be used later for those colder days ahead.

3.16.17  Used hot Italian sausage, Heineken beer, and added some hot peppers.  Gotta tell you this one surprised me.  I had my doubts about making chili with ALL Italian sausage, but we enjoyed everything about this chili.  The ingredients are in perfect balance, and the tomato paste really intensifies the flavor.  Definitely will be making this one again.

Great chili and yes a good chili has beans. I didn't use the kidney beans simply because I don't care for them so I subbed pinquito beans. Hot sausage works best.

I have used this recipe for years,and it's awesome if you just make the following changes to it. I doubled the recipe and I also used (Jimmy Dean) ground sausage 1 pkg. of Hot and 1 Mild and use a dark beer it makes all of the difference. I use guiness stout or black and tan 2 bottles. Just double all of the cans of vegetables and spices  use 6oz tomato paste and 1 small can of green chilies or 2 depending on taste preference. Also to take away the acicidity of the tomatoes I used 4 tbsp of A1 steak sauce. It also needs to be cooked longer than the 8-10 min. it states in the directions about 1 -2 hours on low is perfect. I made this for a restaraunt I managed  and cooked for, and was told it was the most awesome chili they ever tasted.
