I love the flavor of almond and lemon.  So, I thought this recipe would be ideal. 
I followed the recipe exactly as written.  They looked came out looking just like  the photo.   The texture and taste of these cookies were NOT what I expected.    My husband took one bite and that was enough. I'll keep looking.

I made these this afternoon, and they were wonderful!  I’ve never had them before, but they are almost like a little teacake.  Recipe went together very easily!

These are so yummy and moist ... were a huge hit!  I increased the two lemon items (lemon juice to 3 TB  and  lemon zest to 1 tsp).  I did not make the frosting but instead added a lemoncello chocolate almond on top.  Next time, I may lesson the almost extract to 2 tsp because there was a bit of an aftertaste (and I LOVE almond extract).  Will definitely make again!

I have three cookie scoops of different sizes. The recipe was unclear how big the cookie should be, so I used the middle size scoop and had to nearly double the baking time. I wish there was clarification on the size. Otherwise the cookies are delicious!

The cookies are so tender they almost melt in your mouth. They are not too sweet which is lovely.  I will be making them again, but I think I will use a slightly different icing next time.

Not lemony enough for us even after doubling the zest.

I give them a 4 for flavor. The flavor is great. However they aren’t cookies. They are little dense cakes.  I enjoy eating them but know if I will make the recipe again.

I reduced the sugar to 3/4 C and used fresh squeezed lemon in the icing.  They were so light and delicious!
