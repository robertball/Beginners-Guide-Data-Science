For our tastes anyway, hubs and I both agree sugar does not belong on broccoli. The sweetness was VERY noticeable and was not a good complement. We would have much preferred this with the sugar left out altogether.

Yummy! This is my new go to veggie recipe! It tasted like Chinese takeout. Next time I am going to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch.

Very easy and tasty. Good change of pace from our usual steamed broccoli. I added a touch of sesame oil because we love the flavor.

I used fresh organic broccoli, less sodium soy sauce and brown sugar (for a deeper flavor). This was good but next time, I'd use sesame oil instead of olive oil and I'd cut back on the vinegar and use more soy sauce. It's good but not quite there for us yet.

This was really yummy over rice, the leftovers of which I was anxious to use up. I only used half the oil, and that was plenty. I cautiously used all the sugar, and I liked it. I agree it could have used a bit more flavor, so when I make it again I will add a smushed garlic clove to the heating sauce, and then remove the clove before pouring on the broccoli and rice. A bit of ginger would be really nice as well.

Very good way to get yourself or other reluctant broccoli eaters to eat up!  I only had a bag of frozen broccoli but it worked just fine.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks!

This is a very fast and easy recipe for broccoli. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't spectacular. I don't think the sauce was quite flavorful enough, and it was a little oily. The flavor that it did have was good, it just needed more. I'm not sure if I would make this again.

A nice change of pace from broccoli with cheese sauce - even my two picky kids liked it!  Thanks - I've been looking for something like this.

I thought this was just ok.  It was a little sweet for my taste and would probably decrease the sugar some.  I also decreased the amount of oil and agree with others that sesame oil would probably be better.

I love this recipe and make it all the time - even for company.  The sweet and sour is a good combination, very pleasing.

I substituted toasted sesame oil for the olive oil and my three year old twins cried because they wanted more and I hadn't made enough!

Excellent.  We've been using this for years as a sauce over steamed broccoli.  I frequently omit the sesame seeds and it's still great.

I loved this.  I will be eating this all the time.  Anytime I need an oriental veggie.  The sesame seeds added great flavor :)

This recipe is great! I got this out of a taste of home magazine. The only thing is it does not make a lot of sauce, so I would double what the recipe says for the sauce.

This was alright, but the vinegar/sugar/salty combo was a little off. I made it first as written, and the second time I made it I left out the sugar and vinegar and added sesame oil. With those modifications it came out great.

This was just OK! Not great but not bad. I think next time ill try using seasame oil. I also used frozen next time ill try using fresh and add a few gloves of minced garlic.
