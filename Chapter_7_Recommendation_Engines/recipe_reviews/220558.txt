I tried this recipe for my husbands birthday dinner. He loved it!!! As did I! I am NOT a good cook. This was so easy and most of the ingredients used are things you would already have on hand.

I have been making this for YEARS!  It is delicious and simple. We call it "Anticipation Chicken" though, because I usually cook it in the crockpot and we can smell it cooking all .... day .... long. Yum! Definitely not a dish I ever get negative comments about!!

Very good-my only issue is it took quite a while to cook.
