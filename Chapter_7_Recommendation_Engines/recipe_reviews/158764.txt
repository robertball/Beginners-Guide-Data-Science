My mom used to make these in a pan when I was young and I loved them! On the grill is even better. I get requests for them at every party. If you are using small olives, you can cut the bacon slices into quarters and they fit nicely around the olives.

I make these all the time and they are always gone immediately!!!  I use the large jalepeno stuffed olives and bake at 350 until bacon looks cooked through, turning a couple of times.  Yummy!!!!!

I am sorry to say that even though I am a major olive lover I could not do this recipe!

It was WAAAY too salty!

I even purchased UNcured bacon to cut down on the salt but this was almot inedible!

I had a large dinner party and had this as an appetizer. I did not test prior to since I was so sure it would be great! I was shocked to see a guest's face all puckered up. I grabbed one and saw what she meant....

out of all of my apps this one was barely touched! I guess I can chop up and put on things later..but as a one bit app it does not work. 

salt salt salt....sorry to say.

These are a salty treat!  They are very easy to make and people tend love them or hate them, but I always get a ton of attention when I bring these to a gathering!

We had this Saturday when we were tailgating.  My friend wrapped up the olives before we went, so they just had to be thrown on the grill when we got there.  Before wrapping, she put a little bit of canned cream cheese in each one.  YUM!

We had these once at a work function and they were so good I immediately searched for a recipe. Tip: as olives are very salty and so is some types of bacon you can cut down on the salty taste a bit by soaking the olives in a bowl of water in the fridge for an hour or so prior to making these. I also prefer them backed in the over instead of grilled. I cook them on a rack placed over a cookie sheet which helps cook them evenly all around without the need to turn them, they bake nice and stay round (without the "flat" bottom things tend to get from sitting directly on a pan) and when raised like this they bake up nicely instead of just sitting in their own grease deep frying. Brushing them lightly near the end with bbq sauce is also VERY good!! :)
