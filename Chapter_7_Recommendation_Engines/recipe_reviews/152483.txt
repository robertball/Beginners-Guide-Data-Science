The second time we made this, we used fat free sweetened condensed milk and light butter, and it was just as great!!

I'm not sure why it would be soupy, perhaps the caramel never candied?  Make sure you cook the caramel mixture long enough before adding it to the apples, so possibly longer than 12 minutes.  We have a very hot gas stove.  Also, we used VERY large apples, so many more apples would be necessary.  I really hope it turns out well for you; we absolutly love this dish and are also making it for Thanksgiving :)

I just made this for Thanksgiving tomorrow and mine came out "soupy" also.  I'm very dissapointed although I have other desserts my family was really looking forward to this one.  I'm not sure what happened but along with it being soupy it was very greasy.  My topping never got crumbly either.  This was a huge dissapointed the night before Thanksgiving and I don't think I'll try this one again.

It was like "soup". I have added 1/2cup tapioca to it and rebaked it after a day to try to thicken it up. Very greasy with all the butter. Would never make it again. Have been baking for 40 years and never had such a flop.

Darn it... I was really rootin' for this recipe.  Yup... Totally 'soupy' and greasy.  Almost too sweet, even with Haralson apples.  Stuck this in the freezer, to get it to "firm up" - but then it just got ugly... (All that butter coagulated and looked utterly disgusting)  I did use OATS instead of PEANUTS not just out of preference - but I didn't have any peanuts.

I just made this recipe and it came out soupy for me also.  It had lots of butter on the top hen it came out of oven.  I scooped some of the butter off and put it back in oven to see if this would help.  Is there anything wrong with using margarine instead of butter?

it was a nice idea, and once the caramel part actually comes together, that itself isn't too bad, but the whole thing together, not so great.  sorry.

Very soupy and greasy, even with less butter in the caramel.  You might be better off stirring caramel squares in with apples in regular apple crisp.

I give this recipe a 3 star for taste but also mine came out soupy. would be excellent over ice cream. Followed recipe exactly but still came out very soupy.
