this cheesecake is DELICIOUS!!! i used pre made dulce de leche sauce that I found at Costco. I also sprinkled with crushed filberts.It was a hit. Next time I will also put a slice of honey crisp or granny smith apple with each slice.

Amazing dessert! A huge it at the party I brought it to.  Would recommend leaving the sauce in the oven a bit longer to brown.  Tasted sensational.

Easy and delicious! Saved time by buying la lechera dulce de leche (already caramelized condensed milk) and putting the graham crackers in the blender! Almost doubled the crust part, and added about 1tbsp sugar to it. Otherwise followed it exactly!;)

This is to rich in my taste. The eggs make it too heavy for cheesecake.

I have made this countless of times and the recipe never fails me! I substituted one of the eggs with chia seeds and it came out better than I expected!
