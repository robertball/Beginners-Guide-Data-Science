This recipe needed a lot of help. As it was written, it was a pile of peanut butter and chicken noodles and no other flavors. I added snow peas, carrots, red peppers, more lime and more soy sauce. Much better! I really don't know how much this sauce contributed to the flavor.. I could get the same effect really with using chicken stock, basil and some cornstarch

I've never had this style of recipe before, so based on that, we really liked it. The sauce was nice and different. But I have used stir fry noodles a lot. The one thing that I saw that needs to be noted is that the sauce needs to be heated separately from the chicken when adding the noodles. Combining the noodles into the chicken and sauce mixture, makes the noodles clumpy and harder to distribute the mixture through out the whole dish...rather difficult. I would rinse the noodles as directed and place into the sauce, then add the chicken. But overall we thought it was quite nice. Will make again.
