I made this last night and it was a nice twist to plain old boiled cauliflower with butter, salt and pepper.   I did do a couple things differently.  I didn't boil the cauliflower quite as long as suggested because I didn't want to end up with a mushy dish.  I also fried it longer in the pan with the bread crumbs, butter, and onions.  This not only helped the bread crumbs to stay crunchy but the extra frying time added more flavor to the cauliflower.   Overall it was a very yummy dish and I would also give it a 4.5 if I could.  We will definitely make it again!

Enjoyed this very much.  It was a hit with everyone.  Made it instead of potatoes, rice or pasta and it worked well.  The crumbs will be dry but they become kinda crunchy which I think is the intention.  No need to add additional butter.  When I added the cauliflower the bread crumbs stuck to the pieces....just stir it well in the crumb mixture.  Will definitely make again.

I divided the cauliflower into small florets, and then simmered them til tender. I thought the finished dish was ok as written, but a generous sprinkle of freshly-grated Parmesan made a huge difference. I think I'll make it with Gruyere next. Thanks!

This was not a good recipe for us. Came out very dry. We added more butter but that made it into a mush. We enjoy our vegies and I thought I would give this a try. Cauliflower is a delicate dish when cooked so you have to be careful with adding ingrediants. So far just plain old butter, salt and pepper work for us. Thanks though.

Had this recipe last night and my kids loved it.  I must note that I did add about 3 tablespoons of additional butter so it wasn't so dry (from the breadcrumbs).

I only made a few changes, I cut up the head into florets and steamed in the microwave until al dente, so that they could continue to cook in the pan and not turn out mushy. The end result was super yummy, I had 3 helpings! One thing that I would like to note, is that there was no bubbling mixture after I added in the bread crumbs, they completely absorbed the butter. And then they stuck to the cauliflower fairly well. There was quite a bit of extra bread crumbs in the bottom of the pan that I just couldn't get to stick. That was fine with me, they still got eaten. 
And I would like to point out to the people that complained that this was mushy, it is not the recipes fault that you over-boiled your cauliflower and then added more butter than the recipe called for. I imagine that would turn out mushy.

VERY GOOD!  Using what I had on hand (frozen cauliflower, margarine, unseasoned bread crumbs) and tweaking it a bit to our liking (added Italian herb blend, Mrs Dash, garlic powder), it turned out excellent.  The family loved it and has asked that I make it again.  We ate the entire batch!  Not the healthiest way to prep a vegetable, and will keep that in mind when deciding what to serve with it, but will definitely be serving it again.

I have never cooked cauliflower before and was unsure of how it might turn out. I didn't really measure out the ingredients, but just eyeballed it. The only thing I added was some garlic powder to give it a little more flavor. It turned out wonderful! I will definitely make again.

I made this tonight and it was a huge hit.  The pan was scraped clean!  I didn't have italan breadcrumbs so I used regular and added oregano and basil.  I also added more butter. All 3 of the kids loved it very much!

Did not like this recipe at all and neither did my guest. The bread crumbs was not a good combination for the cauliflower. This doesn't even deserve the one star on here.

Really good!  I didn't have bread crumbs so I smashed up some Ritz crackers and used them instead.  Very good side dish!  I give it 5 stars for taste, but 4 because I feel guilty about all the butter this takes.

What a nice way to serve a vegetable that on its own doesn't have IMO a lot of flavor.  I steamed the cauliflower florets in the microwave for 3 minutes,  and they were then ready to go  into the skillet.  Only deviation from the recipe was adding 1 clove of crushed garlic to the bread crumb mixture.  Definitely will be preparing fresh cauliflower like this in the future...tasty and fast.

Um... besides the onion, this is just buttered cauliflower with bread crumbs sprinkled in it. I thought it would be more saucy, but the sauce would only be tons of butter anyways so..... I'll give you two stars for the effort though.

Delicious, and a lovely way to bring flavor to cauliflower. I used italian-seasoned Panko bread crumbs, and the texture was perfect. Thanks!

I thought this was very good. I used chopped onions and I added a tablespoon of olive oil to the mix. It wasn't dry at all. Excellent. My husband and my two teens said it's one of the best ways they've eaten cauliflower. Thanks.

This was just ok, to us. I cut the cauliflower into florets and steamed them rather than boil, and added shredded parm during the last bit of pan frying time, as one reviewer suggested. Although it was good, it’s not anything to rave over. Better than the plain-old steamed cauliflower.

LOVE!! This was so easy and tasted great! I usually don't cook much cauliflower because most recipes don't give it much flavor but this was FULL of flavor! I actually ate more of this than anything else I made for our meal! Will definitely be added to the regulars list in our house!

Delicious alternate for keto/ cauliflower lovers! I added a healthy sprinkling of parmesan on top once it was finished and put it under the broiler to melt/ crisp up a bit.  I also used crushed pork rinds instead of breadcrumbs (for keto diet) and seasoned them with chives and parsley.

I've now made this twice. Used more butter than it called for to fry onions (3tbs), a happy accident. Very good flavor. Paired so very well with the Chicken Cordon Bleu I made my wife. Delicious apart from and with that wine sauce. I'll never see cauliflower the same way.

This was good. I used olive oil instead of butter.  It was even better when I added some grated Parmigiano Reggiano and hot peppers. Thank you for the recipe.

The bread crumbs soaked up the butter and it never started to bubble. So I added one more T. of butter.  Next time I will put the breadcrumbs on after I finish it.  Also will add parmesan cheese.

I cut the cauliflower into florets, then microwaved.  After I added the bread crumbs, it seemed a little dry, so I added 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Before serving, I sprinkled with grated Parm.  Yummy!

This recipe is quick and easy and is a great replacement for potatoes. I slightly undercooked the cauliflower and used seasoned panko instead of bread crumbs and it was fantastic!!!

This was an okay dish as written. It was sort of dry and not a lot of flavor. I might try again with more butter, less bread crumbs, and maybe garlic or something. It was edible but not very good.

This was a nice treatment of a less popular vegetable in my house.  This recipe enhanced rather than covered up the cauliflower.  Like some other cooks, I micro-steamed the florets (not quarters) for about 5 minutes so they were tender crisp but not totally cooked.  I used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs for a bit more texture.  I did find that adding at least 1 1/2 Tbsp. of butter was necessary to adequately moisten the crumb mixture, although I think 3 Tbsp of butter might indeed be overdoing it.  I microplaned fresh parmesan cheese I had leftover instead of the canned stuff.  I also added some garlic salt. My 2 sons, aged 23 and 19 thought it made a passing grade---for them, that's doing good!

I have not made this yet but gave it 3 stars cuz everyone seems to like this. but Im reviewing to say that all the people that feel guilty for using alot of butter due to trying to eat healthy... You dont have to just switch to LandOLakes, its all natural and you can use it without worry!

I would give this 4 1/2 if I could. It was good. It was very interesting. I am definitely considering bringing it to Thanksgiving but it is a little rich for everyday.
