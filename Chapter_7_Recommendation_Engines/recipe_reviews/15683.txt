This is an excellent recipe.  A couple little hints may help those that are having problems.   I didn't freeze my pie crust.  I lightly brushed the crust with a beaten egg white, let it dry (while I was peeling apples) then put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 5 minutes.  Also, adding a  heaping TLB of INSTANT TAPIOCA to the apples when you toss them will thicken any excess juice without adding additional flour.  It won't change the taste.  I do this to all my fruit pies whether the recipe calls for it or not.

Wow, wow, WOW!  Fantastic pie!  I'm extremely fussy about apple pie and this is the best one I've ever made in thirty years!  I did tweak the recipe slightly, taking into consideration all of the previous comments.    Here's what I did: 

1. Used a good homemade all butter crust and a glass pie plate   2.  Used half Fuji and half Granny Smith apples, totalling 3 pounds (a little more than five cups)   3.  Increased the flour to a rounded quarter cup   4.  Omitted the lemon zest (don't like lemon and apple together) and the allspice (didn't have any) and substitued quick oats for rolled ones.

I also discovered that you can do the initial baking of the apples and crust ahead of time.  I had to leave, so I just took it out of the oven, lightly covered with foil and when I returned 3 hours later to finish baking it, it worked out great.  

With the full three pounds of apples I used, and all that streusel topping, it looks HUGE before it bakes but it comes out the perfect size.

With a glass pie plate I dropped the oven temp to 360 degrees and I ended up baking it much longer (at least ten or fifteen minutes longer) until I could view the browned crust on the bottom (easy with a glass pan)  This is crucial because otherwise you get a soggy crust on the bottom.

We ate the pie after it had totally cooled and the slices held together perfectly.  Delicious!  Give it a try!

I only bake pies once or twice a year, but I like to make many of the same kind at once.  Having said that, I found a few things with my second batch of pies that I would like to share.  The crust does indeed go soggy and tends not to bake at the bottom, so for the second batch of 3 pies, I first brushed the frozen pie shells with lightly beaten egg whites before filling (it acts as a barrier and prevents the sogginess) and I also baked the pies at the lowest rack setting of my oven for 20 minutes at 425 degrees.  Once I lowered the oven temperature to 375 degrees, I placed the pies back on the middle rack.  I also used three LEVEL tablespoons of flour in the filling...I found the three heaping tablespoons recommended by other reviewers to be too pasty and two tablespoons to be too runny.  I didn't have any problems with the apples not cooking through, but I sliced them very thinly because the lower sugar/water content in granny smiths tends to make them hold their shape and stay firm otherwise.  It is a very good recipe and  definitely worth a try.

This kicked a$$!!!  to get rid of some of the moisture, mix apple mixture first and drain before putting into shell.  This was the best topping ever!  I had to patch up parts of the pie where I ate the top off while cooling.

This is an excellent Dutch Apple Pie recipe that will make your Grandma proud!  Very east to make.  I made a few minor changes:  I didn't freeze the pie shell - couldn't see the advantage.  And I didn't have allspice, so I found on a website a perfect substitute:  1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves and 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, mixed together. This will make more than the 1/4 teaspoon called for, so I just saved the extra, put it in a little jar and labeled it "allspice" for my next recipe that calls for it.  This pie is scrumptious - especially with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream!

I made this recipe as is except for the lemon zest.  It is very tasty! I had no problem with the crust and I did use the egg white trick. The resulting pie is super tasty, although I think it could use a little more cinnamon! Served with vanilla ice cream to guests and was told that I was "missing my calling" that I need to start a restaurant right now!

OMGosh!!!  This was fabulous.  I am not big on apples, but I LOVE pie; but have never made a good apple pie until now!  My husband, who is an apple pie connoisseur also LOVED this.  I made this pie to serve tonight for our second night of Sukkot (The biblical Feast of Booths/Tabernacles).  Many of our neighbors came to fellowship with us and EVERYONE raved about this pie.  There was none left.  THe plate was licked clean!!!  This one goes in the recipe box and will be used often.  The only alteration I made was to omit the lemon zest, just did not sound good to me.  Anyway, this is a must try!!!  We love it.  Thank you and God bless!

I've tried a bunch of apple pie recipes searching for THE ONE and I've finally found it! This recipe is perfect! The filling has just the right amount of sweetness and spice and the streusel makes a yummy, cookie-like topping.   For those of you having issues with how much flour to add, every batch of apples is different so the amount you need will vary from pie to pie. The best way is to coat your freshly cut apples with about 1-2 tbs of lemon juice and 1/4 c sugar, let sit in a colander for 15-20 minutes and the excess juices will run off. If your apples are really juicy you will need more flour, if they are on the dry side, you can use less. If you want, you can do this over a bowl and save the juices to reduce and mix back into the pie before it bakes, or use as a glaze on top. I used two heaping tablespoons in mine and it was perfect.  Also, when using flour as your pie thickener, it's very important that the filling come to a BOIL! If it's not vigorously bubbling the flour will not thicken properly; your pie will be runny and you will still have that "flour-y" taste. And remember, the pie needs to cool for at least a few hours so the juices solidify before you cut it. Even the best made pie will be runny if you cut into it right away.

My family loved this recipe! I made two of these (and one pumpkin pie) for 9 people and these two DISAPPEARED before I could blink. Sorry, pumpkin! I used Jonagold in one, Granny Smith in the other. I used some of the suggestions in the reviews (no lemon zest, 3 T. flour). I find Granny Smiths will stay too firm for my family's liking at only 40 min. baking, so for that pie I cooked the apple mixture for about 5 min. in a saute pan with 1 T. unsalted butter. Softened them just slightly enough to come out perfect after baking. YUM!

Baked this for our Christmas dinner this year and my father-in-law declared that from now on, we'd have Apple Pie for dessert at every family get-together.  That speaks wonders for a man who rarely touch his sweets.

Tweaked the recipe slightly:
(1)  Made the crust from scratch using the  1 1/2 x of the butter pie crust from this website; 
(2) Baked the crust in the top shelf for 5 minutes (at 220C) before adding the apples;
(3) Used 6 sliced apples (2 huge fuji's and 4 granny smiths)and still found I'd need more apples - will add use 8 in all the next time.
(4) Added cranberries to give a great twang to the tart filling.
(5) Used demanera sugar (unrefined) and have reduced the sugar for the filling to 1/2 cup; and 1/2 cup (unpacked) for the streusel.
(6) Added finely chopped cashews (the only unsalted nuts I had with me) in the streusel and this added to the cruch and flavour beautifully!  Will use walnuts next time.

(7) I did bake the streusel for about 50 minutes.  Afterwhich I'd removed the foil and let the top brown nicely.

I've used a glass bottomed pie dish as suggested by an earlier reviewer (so that I can tell if the crust is soaked through.  With the amount of apples used, they appeared "too much" and over-flowing initially; but after 10 minutes of baking, they've settled down well.

Will use a deeper pie dish next time.

Served the warmed pie slices with my favourite ice-cream but would probably do better with just vanilla instead coz that was a tad too sweet for

Very yummy pie!  I used a deep dish pie pan, so I used about 6 c apples (and would probably use even more next time) with the same amount of sugar mixture and it was awesome.  I also added some cut up caramels to the filling.  Mmmmm.  Definitely a keeper.

I don't usually follow a recipe to make pie...just a bit of this & that.  But I followed this recipe exactly, only changing to 3T of flour instead of 2T (and a home-made crust).  It was wonderful!  Just the right thickening, just the right sweetness, & the topping was just what I was looking for.  Thanks for sharing!

My family requests this pie on numerous occasions...the most recent being a pregnancy craving of my daughter.  I use A full 3 pounds of Granny Smith apples. I put the prepared and sliced apples along with 3 Tbsp butter in a sauté pan and cook while stirring well for about 7 min. Just until they start to soften up. I then combine in a separate bowl the 2/3 C white sugar w 1/3 C brown sugar, 4 Tbsp white flour, 1 and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3/8 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp  allspice. Stir together well. Dump this combination over the apples in the sauté pan with the heat off. Stir well, and let sit like this while you brush prepared pie crust with beaten egg whites and bake for 5 min in a 400 degree oven. When it comes out of the oven, I raise the oven temp to 425,  fill the crust with the apple mixture, then place a foil shield around the crust edges to protect from over browning. Let it bake for 10 min at 425 degrees while I prepare the Streusel topping with the following: 3/4 cup flour, 3/4 cup instant oatmeal, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. Mix together well. Add 1/2 cup slightly softened butter. Cut in well, then I use my hands to get it mixed together well to the large crumble state. I just don't seem to be able to achieve this delicious state of large crumbles with any utensil.  Remove the pie from the oven. Leaving the foil shield on the edges in place, I add the crumble topping to the pie, and lower the temp to 365 degrees for my glass plate pie, retu

FANTASTIC!!! This was my first attempt at making a pie from scratch; I must say it was a total success! No fail Dutch apple pie!! I read through some tips, and the only thing extra I did was add 1/3 cup brown sugar to the filling and some butter. **for a quicker pie, use a premade crust and simmer the filling mixture on the stove for about 10 minutes* this will also help you gage how runny your filling is and will allow you to add more flour if necessary (I used about 4tbs of flour). Also, if you like your topping a tad crunchier, toss in some extra oats!

Very good pie, but beware that this recipe makes enough streudal topping for at least two pies!  Just make 1/4th to 1/2 of the topping called for and lightly sprinkle it on top.  Don't pack it down or it turns to a solid brick because of all the butter.

This was my first apple pie and it turned out AMAZING. I used a different, all butter recipe for the crust, but baked everything the same. TIP FOR CUTTING THE JUICE : toss sliced apples in 1/2 of the sugar (1/3 cup for this recipe) and place in a mesh colander over a bowl for a good hour, or longer (I did this while my crust sat in the fridge). You'll find a nice 1/4-1/2 cup of juice in the bowl when you are ready to use the apples. You can put this in a pan and cook down to a sticky syrup to add back into your pie filling or just toss it, but this step will keep your pie from being runny.

After picking some fresh apples, I decided to try this recipe. This was so good and did not last long enough for seconds.  I made the following changes after reading reviews 1: used  frozen pie shell, and brushed it with an egg white. Bake it for 5-10 minutes, then proceeded with recipe. 2: Increased flour for pie filling to an even 1/4 cup. 3:Omitted lemon peel/zest. 4: using 'quick cooking' oats.   Other than that, followed the recipe.  Everyone LOVED this...I will be making it again for thanksgiving!

Absolutely the best applie pie I have ever had!  I used Macoun and Jazz apples and they were great.  The only thing I changed was I added 2 tbls. of cornstarch to sugar mixture because my pie fillings are always runny.  It came out perfect.  I sliced apples thinly (not cubed) just like picture showed and I am glad I did.  It was layers and layers of soft, sweet apples.  I saw some reviewers who said bottom crust was not cooked all the way and a little soft.  I love my crust like that and that is how it came out (I'm a little weird I guess), but that is an easy fix.  Just brush crust with egg and bake 5-10 minutes before adding filling.  My husband likes his crust crispy so I do that for him.  Excellent, excellent recipe.  Make this tonight!

Very tasty and well worth the effort.  I made my own pie crust, and after mixing the sugar mixture with the apples (I used granny smith), I let it all simmer slowly in a covered pan on the stove for about 15 minutes before filling the pie crust.  Also baked it the whole time at 425.  That was a mistake, but a serendipitous one.  The family loved it.

This is one of the best pies I have ever made.  It will be a family favorite for years to come.  I also found they freeze very well which is great for holiday time or whenever you want to keep a dessert on hand.  I froze the apple filling in the pie crust and shrink wrapped it.  I thawed the pie before baking and made the streusel topping fresh.

I have made dozens of pies but never apple, until now.  I tried this after looking at dozens of recipes and I'm so glad I did - it was stupid good.  Two things I'd recommend: 1.) put your apples and sugar into a bowl and let this sit for about ten minutes - the sugar will draw out a lot of moisture that you want to discard before putting the filling into the crust.  Once you've drained the apples, mix in your spices.  2.) instead of flour, I use 2 tablespoons of tapioca - I always use tapioca in fruit pies, works beautifully every time.  This is a really excellent pie, thank you for sharing!!

The best Apple Pie!  The Oatmeal Streusel is amazing.  I like to make regular apple pies, but didn't have time to make 2 crusts and I had one store bought crust in the fridge.  I find that most streusel toppings are very 'floury' and bland, but this one was like a crispy oatmeal cookie on the top that blended well with the soft apples underneath.  And it is made with basic ingredients that a stocked pantry would have.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and would not change a thing next time except to use different apples.  I jused Granny Smiths and they were a little tart.  Other than that, good consistency, just the right amount of topping, and the pie held together nicely.  Will make again!

I read the reviews for this pie and saw that it got great reviews so I decided to give it a shot. It tasted somewhat good, however the pie was so runny, it was more like apple pie soup. I cooked the pie according to directions and when I took the pie out of the oven the apples were still very hard. I tried to make this pie again. This time I cooked the apples before I put them into the pie, it turned out a little better and a little less runny, also the oatmeal streusel isn't the greatest. This certainly is not the greatest or easiest recipe available. Sorry.

After reading the reviews, I made some revisions to the recipe, and made THE BEST APPLE PIE ever!  For the apples, increased flour to 3 healthy tablespoons, reduced sugar to 1/2 cup.  Subbed Chinese 5-spice for the nutmeg and allspice.   For the crumb topping, reduced the flour and oats to 1/2 cup, and the sugar and butter to 1/3 cup.   This pie was incredible, my husband couldn't stop raving!!  (Note:  only used the tinfoil for the first 10 minutes) Thanks Ginny.

The taste of the pie and streusel topping very really good, however, after the pie was all cooled and we cut it there was approximately 1 cup of liquid on the bottom and the crust didn't cook on the bottom. I followed the recipe exactly.

Though I've been baking since my teens, I'd never made a Dutch apple pie. Today was the day, and I am pleased with this one. Since I don't like things overly sweet, I only used about 1/2 cup sugar in the filling, since my apples weren't at all tart. Used 2 HEAPING tablespoons of flour. For the topping, 1/2 cup both flour & oatmeal, and 1/3 cup both brown sugar & butter -- same cinnamon, no zest. Was the perfect amount of topping for me.  I DID use foil.  With the little extra flour, the filling was not runny at all. Served still slightly warm -- wow!

WOW! Delicious and easy! I followed this recipe closely, except put in 1 heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. I used the "No roll pie crust I" recipe from this site, and did bake it for 5 minutes before filling, as others have suggested. My husband says it is the best apple pie he's ever had, and my mother-in-law asked for the recipe. Two great compliments from people who have tasted lots of apple pies :) This will be my apple pie recipe from now on.

This recipe was marvelous, especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I had to bake it an extra 20 minutes before the apples were done, so the total cooking time was more like 50-55 minutes.  I would remove the lemon zest from the streusel topping because the lemon taste really conflicted with the cinnamon-nutmeg-allspice taste.  Oh and I would also add more cinnamon and subtract some of the oats.

This was incredible!  My whole family loved it.  I followed the recipe with only two minor changes.  I used lemon juice instead of zest and I pre baked my crust after brushing it with egg whites, as suggested by other reviews.

Very tasty. The amount of streusel on top was almost a little much for me, but it was still excellent. After baking, I cooled it down completely and then heated it up in the microwave if people wanted it warm with ice cream...SO good!

!!Great!!!  I took the advise of someone else and used the French Pastry Pie Crust(reduced for one crust). I also exchaned one fourth of white sugar with Brown and used three tbsp. of flour for thickening instead of two. It was absolutely outstanding and it cut perfectly. Not runny, thick with apples(I used golden del.) and perfectly sweet. I have only made three pies in my life, I am a cake person, but whew, I have found a winner! Thanks.

This is a good pie. I've used all types of apples with success, and like many others, found myself increasing the flour to no more than 1/4 cup to combat the sogginess - though to be honest, scooping out the apples into the pie crust and leaving the juice at the bottom is the smart thing to do for any pie using fresh fruit that's not being cooked on the stove first to create a thickened filling. I've made the pie with a frozen crust, but prefer the standard brushing with egg white and allowing to dry or baking for 10 minutes then cooling prior to filling. I used McCormick apple pie spice - my normal go-to - rather than the separate spices listed. The only thing I did NOT like was that the amount of sugar in both the pie filling and the topping is excessive. In my opinion, it could be cut to 1/2 c in the filling and 1/4 c in the topping. Good recipe, though and I appreciate your posting it. I will bake this pie again.

Another way to avoid a soggy bottom crust is to mix together 1 T each of cornstarch & white sugar,  then sprinkle it onto the bottom crust before you fill it with the apple's.  Work's every time !

the spicing and flavor of the filling and the crumble top is perfect (i used 1/3 cup of Splenda in the filling and 1/2 cup Splenda Brown in the crumble and omitted the rest of the sugar), but i don't see the purpose of the crust;  i'll stick to making apple crisp.  Still, if you're looking specifically for a pie, this one's a winner.

Tantalizing! You won't know whether to eat this pie or smear it all over your body.  My dog even loves this apple pie.  I did make a few alterations: added lemon juice rather than zest to enhance flavor of the apples, and used a homemade, never-fail crust using butter-flavored crisco.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Made according to directions with one exception....did not use Nutmeg because I did not have any on hand.  Excellent recipe, made this similar recipe out of the Betty Crocker cookbook years ago. My husband used to dislike this apple pie version (he was brought up on store bought pies)but he said this was excellent.  He is finally coming around to what Home baked food should taste like!

I added just a pinch of salt to the streusel topping but otherwise made as is.  Great way to use up a store-bought pie crust I had in the freezer and a few Granny Smith apples.

This may well be the most delicious apple pie recipe I've ever made. Both the filling and the streusel topping were very tasty and, in my opinion, a cut above all the rest. I used a combination of Granny Smith and Honey Crisp. I brushed the crust with egg white before putting in the filling and my crust was not the least bit soggy. I didn't have time to freeze the crust and don't see how that could have made it any better. Perhaps if you do the egg white thing, it isn't necessary. Thanks, Ginny, for an excellent recipe.

I'm not a fan of apple pie, but my parents love it so I thought I'd give it a whirl for Christmas. It was good. I used a pre-made, deep dish frozen pie crust. It was a little soggy and I did prebake it, so next time I think I'll try brushing it with egg white. I used 6 small Jonathan apples, which was a bit more than 5 cups. I also used 3 level tablespoons of flour in the pie mix, and quick oats and liked the results just fine. I probably made and used a bit too much of the streusel topping because I knew I'd love it. Next time I will try another reviewer's idea and cut up some caramels to made it even yummier.

Sorry but I did not like this. I gave it 2 stars because hubby said it wasn't bad but for the topping absolutely killed it. I should have realized when I saw the oatmeal ingredient that it would not be the nice crumb topping that I wanted.
I would still encourage others to try it because the filling part tasted good and if you like the oatmeal topping you may like this as well. I will find a similar one with the crumb topping I prefer. Thanks

This was really good.  I used both white and brown sugar in the apple mixture and omitted the butter (my filling was NOT runny).  I omitted the oats for the topping and just used flour, sugar, brown sugar and butter.  I put the topping on the pie and baked uncovered all at the same time for 50 minutes at 375.  Just a tip, put pie on a cookie sheet to catch any overflow.

I made this as written and it was pretty good; just not great.  I had to cook it twice as long as the recipe called for in order to get the apples soft enough to eat.  The topping seemed a little mushy, not what I expected.

Great!  Didn't really change the recipe at except for using 3T of flour.  Used lemon juice in filling instead of zest since I didn't have any on hand.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!! I am an apple pie fanatic! I love it all year long not just for the holidays! I didnt change a thing and probably wouldnt want to simply because I wouldnt want to mess the wonderful flavor!  The only thing that wasn't really even a problem, was that It was a little runny in the first & Second slice. Someone mentioned how Instant vanilla pudding helps that. SO I will do that next time, and there will be a definite next time!

This turned out great, I should have used more tart apples, but that has nothing to do with the recipe.  Just a suggestion.

The times for this pie are definitely low, at least for me and I'm just about at sea level. After 35 minutes the Fuji apples I used were not cooked and there was a lot of liquid so I put it back in the oven for approximately another 35 minutes. If I had to do it over again I'd probably cook the pie at 425 for 20 minutes and adjust the time at 375 accordingly.  On the bright side after cooking the pie longer the liquid became thick and delicious and the streusel is perfectly crumbly. It's a great recipe, just be mindful of the cooking time and test the apples for doneness.

The topping was great, however the baking time for this pie is seriously wrong!  Any apple pie that wants to get cooked needs longer oven time.

This is my 3rd year making this pie. I make it every thanksgiving or when i got a sweet tooth. I LOVE this pie...i never expected it to taste so good! My family loves it so much i dont even get a chance to eat it LOL. One hint is to cover the edges of the pie with tin foil bout 10 minutes into baking cause they have a tenancy to burn over time in the oven. make sure you have a cookie sheet below cuase if its cooking right...it will start to leak a bit. also wait a hour or two before eating cuase if you cut it hot the filling from the rest of the pie will seep into the space you cut out. I find adding 1/4 a teaspoon more of nutmeg/cinnimon/cloves into the apples and the streusel makes it a bit more flavorful..and adding a few more chunks of butter to the apples never hurt no one either ^_^

Made this for family Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  Personally thought it tasted a little doughy.  I used half Granny Smith & 1/2 Rome apples, and frozen pie crust from grocery store.  Overall very tasty.  Next time I will decrease amount of flour in filling.

I used a deep dish pie crust and made 1-1/2 times the amount including topping and it was delicious! I also added a little vanilla to the apples.

I had a few minor problems with this pie, but once I got them resolved, it was wonderful.  I used granny smith apples, and the first time I made it, the filling was super runny and the apples were still way too crunchy for my taste.  Still, my family liked it, so I made it again.  The 2nd time, I mixed up the filling, adding a little more flour to the mix, and threw it in a covered baking dish and baked it until the apples were soft.  Then I put it in the pie shell and followed the directions the rest of the way.  It turned out awesome!  I will make it again with golden delicious and I think it will be even better.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the BEST apple pie I've ever had! The streusel topping is perfect. I used two packets of Maple and Brown Sugar oatmeal (per another reveiwer's comments) for the topping and it was delicious. I thought it might be too sweet, so I slightly decreased the amount of sugar and it turned out just right. I also increased the amount flour in the topping to 3 level tbsp. and the filling was the right consistency. I also didn't use the lemon zest. This is THE apple pie recipe I will be using all of the time. I can't wait to make it for my family on Thanksgiving. Thanks for a great recipe!

I had a bag of small MacIntosh apples to use up. I love apple pie but I also love apple crisp. So when I found this recipe that combines the 2 I was in heaven...and even moreso after eating it!! I made it for company and everyone wanted the recipe! I tweaked it according to previous reviews - increased the first amount of flour to a heaping 1/4 cup, reduced the Allspice to 1/8 tsp and omitted the nutmeg and lemon - but that is just according to our taste. Reduced temp to 360 and cooked for 50 minutes. It cut well and stayed together wonderfully. Warmed and served it with vanilla ice cream! Excellent!

This is just a fantastic recipe.  I used a combination of sweet and tart apples, and it was a good balance.  After slicing the apples, I cut them into smaller pieces.  I used the "Shortbread Crust" from this website, and it was a great combination.  I didn't use the lemon either.  My only problem is that after the designated cooking time, my apples were still pretty crisp.  We still ate it that way and it was delicious, but I'd like to try maybe steaming the apples until slightly soft in the microwave before mixing them with the sugar and flour mixture.  I will be making this recipe again.

This pie is awesome! Just for kicks, I added some caramels (cut in half) under the topping. Also, I used one packet of Apples & Cinnamon and one packet of Maple & Brown Sugar oatmeal instead of regular for the topping. Very yummy!!!

This recipe was great! Everybody loved it, but I did need to bake it a bit longer. Also, I would bake the crust longer before i put the filling in next time. I used jonagold & granny smith and it was awesome! Thanks!

The best apple pie I've ever had! I followed the recipe almost exactly, with only a couple slight changes. As another person suggested, I applied egg whites to the crust and baked it for 10 minutes while I prepped the other ingredients,  and that did the trick to keep the crust crusty even after the pie sat overnight. I also like to cut my apple into cubes rather than slices to keep a little bit of the apple texture after baking.  And I may try this recipe again with brown sugar instead of white, because that's usually my preference in an apple pie. But this is now my go-to pie recipe. Love!

This was my first successful attempt (seriously) at apple pie and it received rave reviews from my co-workers.  I am usually not very successful with fresh fruit pies so I stick to custard pies most of the time.  I followed the recipe exactly except a uded 3 tablespoons of flour in the filling mixture as recommended by others.  I will make this again....and use homemade crust next time.  That should really make my husband dance.

this is a good recipe. i used my own homemade butter crust and didnt have the other spices, so only used cinnamon, and i used gala apples.   the crumb topping i expected to be a little more crunchy so i was disappointed in that.   but i followed the directions on making the topping, so dont know why it wasnt. but overall, a good pie.

made another one and cooked it 40 mins cuz i made my own crust and it seemed to turn out better

I made this pie for my husband before heading out of town. I partially cooked it and left him instructions to preheat the oven and put it in for another 15 minutes- cause nothing beats homemade apple pie with vanilla icecream! All I heard was "OMG, SO GOOD!" via text and he managed NOT to eat the whole thing in one sitting (I only made a 4") Will make this again!

The topping is amazing, I would absolutely use it again. The filling isn't great because like so many other reviewers said, it's very runny. I doubled the amount of flour (so a total of 4 TB flour) and I added 2 TB of cornstarch to guarantee a thick syrupy filling. That didn't happen ... After a few pieces were cut, the liquid started leaking out so there was a layer of apple-cinnamon liquid on the bottom of the pan. It didn't affect the taste too much, but it wasn't pretty to look at. I would use the same topping for a different filling recipe next time.

This pie is amazing. I have been making it for years and the only thing I change is that I add a full teaspoon of cinnamon in the apple mixture. This pie even won me $100 in a bake off :)

It would have been much better without the allspice and nutmeg and with more cinnamon. I baked it 35 minutes after adding the topping, and the crust and topping were nicely browned, but the apples were very undercooked. The apples should have cooked longer during the first baking. This pie wasn't very appetizing. Waste of ingredients. UPDATE: I increased my rating from 2 stars to 3, because after I refrigerated it overnight, and the pie did taste a little better cold.

Fantastic apple pie!  I made this for my Dutch In-laws and got the approval! yum, my mother in-law told me she was keeping the left overs........no questions asked;)  I had my apples sit in the sugar mixture while I was preparing my crust.  By the time I was ready to fill, there was a bit of liquid at the bottom of the apples.  So I drained it a bit - but not a whole lot.  Also - there is A LOT of streusel, I could probably cut it in half next time.  This turned out great, thanks!

This pie is excellent!  I made it with empires and cortlands since that's what I had picked at the orchard.  I definitely could have used more apples (I didn't know how many apples translated to pounds).  I loved the oatmeal streusel on top - so much better than plain crust.  Serve with vanilla ice cream and you have DELISH!

so in all of my years of cooking, i have never made a pie... until tonight.  this pie was a HIT!!!  not one drop left in the pan...  i followed the recipe to the T (mostly)..  i did omit the lemon zest, and in the "filling" i doubled the cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice... served it with some vanilla ice cream...  yum yum yum!!! i will definitely make this again.  i already have requests to have it for dessert/breakfast/afternoon snack... LOL  i don't know if i did it wrong but the streusel topping ended up being more of an oatmeal cookie top, but it was good good good!!!!!

I LOVE this pie!! I've made it 3 times now and have taken some advice from others to make it perfect for my family! First I brush the crust with egg whites and bake at 400 for 5 minutes to prevent a soggy crust. I increased the flour to 3 TBSP. I use around 7 granny smith apples and slice them into about 1/4 inch slices so that it is layered and beautiful. I haven't used the lemon zest at all. Also increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and sugar to 1 cup. It's definitely not too sweet. The steusel is the best part!! I have to bake it for 45-50 minutes everytime, but that could just be my oven? Perfect! This is a new holiday tradition for us!

This was a great recipe to get things started. I ended up not using the allspice and 1/2 the nutmeg in the filling while adding 2TBSP of tapioca. I also increased the amount of brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I have heard nothing but great things when I serve this pie (I am not personally a fan of apple pie) and have been requested to enter a pie contest.

I bake pies frequently, and was visiting my daughter. So I looked up this recipe, as her husband likes dutch apple pie.  Most other reviewers gave this recipe a good rating. After making the pie and having to throw it away, because the crust was nicely browned on the edges but upon cutting the bottom crust was not even cooked. the whole pie was ruined. I came back to your site and read the other reviews.  Everyone gave it 4 or 5 stars but said that the bottom crust did not cook, so they either did not freeze the crust or baked it longer. It is ridiculous to give a recipe a good rating if following the recipe as written gives a bad result.

This is very good. I like that it is not over sweet. 1. I followed the advice of others and added a tablespoon of tapioca to thicken it all up. (I will actually add two tablespoons next time. It was still a bit runny/mushy.)2. I did brush the crust with an egg white to keep the crust from going mushy. 3. I did not have allspice or a lemon and made the recipe without them. It still turned out great.

I really like this pie.  I have found that this pie is great with all granny smith apples (I usually mix two kinds of apple for a pie).  The tartness of the granny smiths is perfect with the sweetness of the topping.  Don't leave out the lemon zest - it really makes it!  Once I subbed orange zest and it was great too.  The mix of spices makes this more fitting for a winter pie than a summer one, I would think.

Very good! Did not follow suggestions about using egg in the crust and it was a bit mushy - will try that next time. Streusel was a bit floury and not quite sweet enough for me, but the filling was delicious! Will adjust streusel mixture next time, but will certainly make it again!

I always use Granny Smith apples and so I add a little more sugar than called for. I also use more cinnamon, because I like it. I don't always have nutmeg or all spice in my cupboard, but it doesn't matter. It's just a great topping!

I love apple pie, and this was a good recipe, but in my opinion this isn't exactly the best I've ever had.  However, I'm giving it a 5 since everyone who had a slice said it was amazing.

YUM... I can not say enough wonderful things about this recipe. It was probably the best apple pie I've ever had. The lemon added a little bit of a zip that I wasn't expecting, and I may try it without the next time but I also loved it with it.  Will definitely make again.

I was disappointed in this pie.  I am known for my pie making skills, and thought this would be the ultimate - great pastry, filling and a crisp-like topping!  My crust was good - my usual recipe.  The pie filling was ok, a little tasteless, but the topping was powdery and dull tasting.  
Next time, I would increase the amount of butter/margarine in the topping, add more flavor to the filling.

I made the following modifications as suggested by others:  I used half granny smith & half fuji apples (although i'll use all one or the other next time);  added 1 TBSP of Tapioca to the existing 2 TBSP of flour (this worked brilliantly -- the pie wasn't runny at all and unlike other reviewers, i didn't drain any of the juices); added 2 TBSP of brown sugar to the existing 2/3 cup of white sugar.  I brushed the pie crust (set in a glass pie dish) /w egg whites and pre-baked for 10 mins or so at 400 degrees.  I also pre-baked the fruit filling in a glass casserole dish for 15 mins at 400 degrees prior to dumping it into the pie crust  (to address the crunchy apple issue mentioned by others).  The pie turned out excellent.  However, I wasn't "blown away" by this pie.  In fact, I was annoyed at all the modifications necessary to make the end result "perfect."  It was a lot of work for a pie that is slightly above average.  It is also missing something, but I can't put my finger on what...  It has a bland flavor.  It needs a bit more "zing", perhaps the reviewer that suggested adding some cranberries was on to something.  Overall, I might make this again, but only if I'm extremely motivated.  There are easier and better recipes available.

I am a pie diva, they are my specialty.  This was pretty good, I'm not sure if I liked the topping enough to make up for the extra calories though.  I will probably make it once more before I completely write it off.  The only change I made was to use my own homemade crust.

I was in a hurry and purchased the ready made pie crust which i put in a glass pie dish.  Took the advice of other cooks and brushed the pie crust with an egg white.  I used Golden Delicious apples with 1/2 cup of brown sugar with a tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Didn't use any allspice, 2 Tbsps flour. 
   Do not make this pie unless you are have other people around to help you eat this pie.  It is too tempting,  It's the best apple pie I've ever made..  I've made two pies within two weeks.  This is a great pie!!

Yum! Turned out great! The crust was golden brown, the filling held together well, and the apples were fully cooked. Here's the modifications I used, some suggested by other reviewers: -I baked the pie crust for 5 mins before adding the filling. -I used Gala apples (what I had on hand). -I used the 2/3 cups white sugar, plus about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar in the filling.-I also added an extra tablespoon of flour to the filling.-I omitted the lemon zest from the topping. -I baked the pie for 40 minutes, taking the foil off for 5 minutes toward the end. We loved the streusel topping! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I dont usually like apple pie, but this one was pretty good. The family liked it too.  I thought the apples were a little crisp and the bottom was slightly soggy though.

My husband and I have fallen in love with this pie! The things I did differently; start with a good homemade crust, then I used about 11 apples of 4 different varieties. Like JCAFELD I omitted the allspice and lemon zest. For the amount of apples I used I also had to double the dry mixture to put on them. A drizzle of caramel or some whipped cream on top, and this is heaven!

I followed this recipe almost exactly, and like other people, found that it came out too watery. Also, I thought the streusel top had too much butter in it. If I make this again, I'll add more flour to the apples and cut the butter down by half. The flavor of the pie is excellent, I must say.

This apple pie was amazing!!  It was the first apple pie I made from scratch and it was so easy!  I used one of the apple peeler/slicer/corer tool which made it so easy!  I took it for the 4th of July to a party and it received rave reviews!  The strusel on top makes the pie!  This is definitely a keeper!!

This pie was sooooooo great!!! I'm definitely going to try the instant tapioca addition next time......I used fuji apples this time and the pie was perfect! Also, I used one of those frozen pie crusts from the store.....They're the greatest invention!

OK, I can only really rate the oatmeal streusel part of this recipe. I seriously cheat and use a frozen crust, canned apples (dressed up with more cinnamon, nutmeg and butter) and the topping. It makes a really tasty pie and somehow nobody ever knows that it's not fully homemade! Even my family (two are professional bakers) was fooled! I did make this pie fully according to the recipe once and the filling came out way too runny. Extra flour would have done the trick.

My husband is an apple pie FANATIC, and I have been looking for a yummy and easy Dutch Apple Pie recipe, and I have found it!  I made a few changes; no lemon zest (don't like it), added a bit extra flour (per previous reviews), and I ground the oatmeal to a fine powder in my coffee grinder (didn't want whole oats in there).  I've made it three times and gotten it almost perfect!  I say almost because I can't seem to get the apples tender enough.  I've added to the cooking time by about 15-20 minutes and experimented w/ different apple types (tried Jonathan and Jonagold), and still a little too chewy.  No complaints though that I will have to keep on experimenting!  My husband says it's the best he's had!!

Wow, this is great!  I incorporated a number of suggestions.  I used a whole wheat pie shell (my suggestion!), 5 granny smith apples (just under 3 lbs), 3 heaping tablespoons of flour, only 1/2 cup sugar with the apples, and I omitted nutmeg and added 1/4 teaspoon each clove and ginger.  I was sure when I tried to pile the apples into the shell that this recipe would fail! I had to carefully stack them into the shell and it just seemed wrong.  Then, oh my goodness, trying to add the topping was even more difficult.  I gingerly packed it around the side and sprinkled the top. I had to bake for an HOUR!  Taking the foil off for the last 15 minutes.  So, too many apples perhaps? or maybe granny smith are too dense?  Regardless, it came out soooo delicious and I will defintely make it again.  I will try a combination of apples and perhaps cut down to 4 apples/2 lbs.  But maybe not, because this is the best apple pie I have ever made!!!

I used a pillsbury frozen pie crust on the bottom but followed all the other directions closely. The pie hardly browned at all; I ended up removing the tinfoil completely and letting it bake 5 minutes longer. It came out runny! It tastes fine, but it just doesn't look that great. I'm hoping that it will firm up a little by tomorrow morning. I like the flavor and this is definitely easier than making a two crust pie, so I may try this again baking it a little longer and maybe taking the tinfoil off half-way through. Thanks for sharing the recipe! :)

I did not use this recipe to make a complete pie, as I enjoy my grandmother’s pie recipe. I did however use this recipe for the crumb topping to make my basic recipe into a Dutch apple pie verses a traditional 2 crust pie. The crumb topping was a fantastic addition to my pie & I will be using it again in the future!

I loved it. I pre baked the pastry until it was brown before filling. I always do this and find the crust doesn't get soggy. My family wanted more apple so I will increase the Apple by 1 cup next time. I found the recipe didn't require any other thickener but the flour. I was careful to mix the apples and flour until they were completely combined before adding to the crust.. I think how much apple  or thickener needed depends  on how much the apple you're using cooks down while baking. This pie was a cross between a pie and a crisp. I found I had to explain this to my family.

There must be something wrong with me.  EVERY recipe that calls for struesel topping makes SO much of it - I always have WAY too much of it when I follow the recipe.  But I faithfully follow the recipe every time!  Duh!!  half of it didn't fit on the pie!!  - We'll see how it turns out.   I hope I don't have the soggy mess that lots of other cooks have.  I swear I don't even know why I bother with others recipes!!

I didn't stray away from the recipe but I did do a few things differently when it came to the freezing/baking. Also, a lot of comments are excluding the lemon zest but I thought it was an awesome touch to the topping. This was my first homemade pie and it turned out amazing!

1. I lightly brushed the crust with a beaten egg white and did not freeze it.

2. I let it bake longer than it called for and always with the aluminum foil on top until the last 10 minutes to give it a little crunch. I had the pie/topping in the oven for about 20 minutes extra. That caused the extra liquid to cook off and the apples were perfectly done.

Overall a great basic recipe..i did make some changes but mostly because i don't like premade pie crust and felt too lazy to make pastry the day i wanted apple pie. 
So...I made a great graham crust that just pressed into the pan: 
1 1/2c of cinnamon graham cracker crumbs, add 1/4c brown sugar, mix well and add 7TBSP of REAL butter, melted until the crumble will hold together when pressed in a pie plate. trust me, the cinnamon graham crust is perfect with the apple pie and when it is baked it does hold together like regular pie crust. 
When it came to the filling, i added about 1/2TBSP of dry Madagascar vanilla. (I found this in whole foods and it is great for anything you don't want to add extra liquid to) after all the filling ingredients are mixed together, I had a grinder of spices called "winter spice" from whole foods. this is amazing and fresh grinds all those wonderful spices. (in addition to the ones in the recipe) I just ground some extra in until it "smelled right."  
From there I just dumped the apples in the crust and followed the remaining instructions as written...it was amazing and I got so many compliments.
....I made it another time and put all of the peeled and cored apples through the food processor shredder. they looked like hash browns, but what an interesting and easy to eat texture. this technique does require some good firm cooking apples (I used "Limbertwigs" they were delicious!

Very good pie.  Easy to make and a nice lemony taste with the apples makes it perfect.  I do like a bit of tartness so I did add the juice of the lemon to my apples/spice mixture.

I am not an expert at making pies, but I do like to bake.  After getting the pie completely assembled I realized there is no salt in the recipe.  I always assume a recipe calling for butter is for unsalted butter.  So at the last minute I sprinkled some salt on the top of the crumble hoping it would soak in to the butteryness.  It did help the crumble top, but next time I will add 1/4 tsp of salt to the apple mixture.  

As far as method, I took advice from one reviewer and baked my pie shell for 5 min before adding the filling.  The bake time was longer by 10 min and I broiled on low for the last 2 min to get a bit more brown on the crumble.

I made this pie last night and it is absolutely delicious! My one and only problem--it was SO RUNNY! When we cut the first piece (after it had cooled), the pie dish flooded with liquid. I am going to try it again but use the suggestion that Barb Maxwell gave of adding 1 TBSP of instant tapioca to the apples when tossing. Fingers are crossed it solves my problem because this pie is just too yummy to give up on too quickly!

Tastes wonderful, if not a bit too sweet for my taste, but is definitely watery(even though I added a bit of extra flour to the apple mixture.) I'd definitely recommend adding something to thicken it up to make this a perfect recipe.

Gave up on soggy crusts by using 9X12 cake pan, (no crust). Tripled pie ingredients, doubled streusel, added 10 minutes cooking time. Added 2 tbsp. corn starch. Problems solved.

I really wanted to love this pie....but didn't.  I agree with others about the apples being too firm and the pie being runny.  The topping just wasn't right either.  If I were to bake this pie again, I would put more flour in the apple mix, leave the oatmeal out and bake it twice as long.  But wait, I'd just rather stick with my tried and true double crust from the Betty Crocker cookbook.  Christmas dessert was a runny, undercooked disaster.  Didn't have time to read the comments, just trusted the 4 1/2 stars.

Excellent! I made this pie with the exact ingredients in the recipe. I used Granny Smith apples. I took the suggestion from another review and drained the apple filling before putting it into the pie shell. The pie turned out moist but not soggy with lots of flavour. If I hadn't drained the apples I think the pie would have been soggy. Loved the topping but I think I would prefer a bit less of it. Also, I baked the pie for an additional 10 to 15 min, but that maybe just be my oven.

Delicious! Great flavorful pie with the following adjustments as per many other reviewers' suggestions: Brushed a pre-made crust with egg white and baked at 425 for 5 mins. Added 3 roughly level tablespoons of flour to apple mix along with the juice of half a lemon, 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, and upped all the spices - I used cinnamon and cloves. I used a mix of Granny Smith and Golden Delicious apples. Try it!!

Very good tasty pie!! I did leave in an extra 10 minutes as one reviewer suggested & would NOT do that again. The topping got a little crunchy. Not holding that against the recipe though, that was my own fault. Good easy pie recipe.

This is fantastic!!! The only thing I did was take 2 T of the sugar and allowed the apples to sit and drain while I made the crust.  This made it so the crust wasn't soggy.  The pie was a big hit for Thanksgiving.

I've never tried Dutch Apple Pie. I always made traditional apple pie. My husband requested it so I found this recipe and tried it as is. Delicious! I made it for our "Pre-Thanksgiving" with family and friends. It was gone in no time! Thanks for the great recipe!

Lord this is SO good!  I have to admit I was skeptical while I was making it.  I have never used nutmeg or allspice in pies before, but I decided to follow the directions.  Now here it comes:  3 things I did differently - I didn't use the lemon zest, and I used more apples than the recipe called for, and I used at least 2 tablespoons of cinnamon.  Other than that I followed it as written.  I did have to bake it longer - about an hour on 375 (after the first 10 minutes), and some of the apples still had the slightest hint of a crunch, which isn't a bad thing.  I had many apples that needed to be used, so I mixed Grannies, Jonagolds (my favorite baking apple), and Honey Crisps.  Oh I'll be making this one over and over again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Made two of these pies and followed the tip to put a rounded 1/4 cup of flour in the pie and to leave out the lemon zest.  Instead of using nutmeg and allspice, I used the same measurements for apple pie spice since that is what I had on hand.  I also used butter in the pie and margarine in the streusel topping.  The pies turned out wonderful!  This recipe has been added to my personal collection with recipes I have gotten from my mom and two grandmothers.  You won't regret making a pie following this recipe.

I should have demonstrated some restraint when pouring the topping onto the apples, but I have a weakness for streusal and wanted to capture every last bit!  Since I used it all I had a mound of crumb topping that was too dry atop my apples.  Next time I would reduce the amount of oats/sugar a bit and keep the butter measurement as specified.  I did not have issues with excess liquid; I leave my pies in tact overnight prior to slicing into them.  It gives the juice a chance to soak back into the fruit!

BEST EVER!  This is an AMAZING recipe!  I once tried freezing the crust & it made things complicated.  I suggest just keeping the dough room temp.  Otherwise, the crust cooks strangely...I put tin foil loosely over the crust for the first 10-15 mins to prevent burning.  I also add walnuts or pecans to the streusel & it gives it an extra oomph, not that this pie needs it!  My apples (always granny smith) are always cooked to perfection but we use an apple peeler that cores, peels & cuts the apple thin & into a round apple ring.  Therefore, the apple pieces are thin.  We cut them in quarters making the apples a perfect bite size.  I don't like chunky apples! It tastes very much like a warm caramel apple with an amazingly delicious streusel topping & we add french vanilla ice cream to top.  Everyone LOVES this recipe, I get so many kudos.  It's a pie TO DIE FOR!

Very good.  I might leave out the lemon zest next time, but it was still delicious.  Our 13 yr old actually made it mostly by himself.  Thanks.

Very good, solid recipe. Family liked a lot, even my husband who doesn't like desserts very much.

 I used Granny Smith apples and the pie was neither too sweet or runny. Also, the pie sat for about an hour before we cut into it, which helps the pie firm up and not be runny.

I didn't freeze my crust.  I used it straight from the fridge and the crust was fine, both around the edges and in the middle.

A good apple pie.  A little sweet for my taste, especially the topping, so would cut back the sugar in the future.  Not sure if I liked the lemon zest in the topping, so might leave that out next time to gauge our preference.  The pie is gone though, so this recipe is still a keeper!

A delicious and flavorful pie. I baked the crust on 350 for ten minutes to keep it from getting soggy. The streusel topping helps it stand out from your average apple pie.

A very good apple pie... the spices were no too over powering and it reminded my dad was an apple crisp... that is pretty much what a good dutch apple pie is an apple crisp in a pie shell... cooking time for me was about 20 minutes longer than suggested... in that last 20 minutes I removed the foil over the top... good tasting pie... I am not sure if freezing the crust is necessary though...

My Father in law gave me the best compliment on thas pie he said "this is the best apple pie I have ever had"! He is 70 yrs old! The only spice I used was cinnamon and it got gobbled up! My husband was so sad that he had no leftovers. Will be making this regularly for sure!

Filling would be MUCH better with just a small dash of nutmeg and allspice and adding more cinnamon.  Found this pie to be kind of overwhelming with too much of a spice flavor.  Although I wasnt crazy about the pie, my husband said it was pretty good.  My suggestion is to use the spices in moderation.

As always with pie recipes, I made this in oven-safe ramekins without a bottom crust.  Needs less baking time.  Excellent recipe!

I made this pie yesterday--it turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have allspice and I didn't add lemon zest. Didn't miss either ingredient because the pie turned out great. I made a homemade pie crust.

This is my go-to pie for any occasion! My boyfriends' Dad requests this pie for his birthday (or any other holiday!) The only change I make is to bake the crust and apples for an extra 10 minutes (so 20 total) before adding the topping, and I don't add the lemon zest, but that's just personal preference. Great recipe!

I love dutch apple pie and this recipe makes the best one I've ever had.  I add butterscotch chips to the apple mixture.  When making the crumbly top, I melt the butter and stir it in a bit at a time which seems to make better crumbles.  I also use the "Best Ever Pie Crust" recipe, which makes 2 crusts.  Coating the crust with egg white and allowing it to dry prior to adding the apple mixture keeps the crust from going soggy on the bottom.  No one can resist this pie; even if they think that they don't like apple pie, they come back for seconds.

I made this for our potluck last night and it was by far the best apple pie ever eaten.  I used Ida Red apples since my grandmother always used Ida Reds for her apple pie's, and a crust made with canola oil. Everyone loved it.

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup for the apples (granny smiths) and added chopped pecans to the  streusel. All tasted great, especially with the bit of lemon zest, tho still a little sweet.  I tried the prebake the crust method mentioned in adaptations and ended up with a short edged crust. I will just bake it as per usual next time, as I never have mushy crust with 2 crust apple pies.

GLUTEN FREE: This pie turned out awesome. I used equal replacement of the flour with Gluten Free Pantry All Purpose Flour and Bob's Red Mill Rolled Oats. While we all loved this pie, I would suggest adding half of the zest to the topping and half to the pie. Or just subbing it for a teaspoon of lemon in the filling. While the lemon did a good job of keeping it from being nasty sweet, we didn't care for the super citrus-y flavor in the crust. But, all in all it was a great pie.

My husband and I LOVE this apple pie.  I made it for Thanksgiving and today (3 days later) it is gone and he has already told me that I need to make it again.  I used a 9x13 glass pan as well as instead of a pie crust, I used a graham cracker crust (made from a cheesecake recipe on here).  The pie took much longer to cook than instructed, I did decrease the heat to 360 F from a suggestion by another reviewer as I did use a glass pan.  I will never make or search for another apple pie recipe, this is fantastic!!!!

This recipe was amazing! I did my first thanksgiving ever this weekend, and this pie was a hit! I took some of your advice and added about a tbs of flour to the filling and i also brushed beaten egg white on the bottom of the crust and baked it for about 5 minuets before filling it. I added about 1/2 a cup of chopped pecans to the topping , and it was amazing!

Used Pamela's Products baking mix to make crust.  Followed other directions only added 1 extra tablespoon of gluten free flour to mix.  Multiplied filling ingredients to 1 1/2 and used a cake pan to make deep dish.  Yummy :-)

I am not rating the whole pie (I make my own filling) just the topping.  This is a good topping.  I get frustrated when a recipe doesn't make enough topping to cover the fruit.  This makes plenty of yummy oatmeal streusel to cover a 9" pie

I have made many Dutch Apple Pies and found they turn out soggy in the middle, this one is excellent my husband said it's the best pie I ever made, I highly reccomend it. The oatmeal topping gives it a crunch, also I used Granny Smith  apples I think they make it a good tart pie.

Delicious!  Made as directed except with closer to 3T flour as other reviewers advised.  No runny filling here.

I have never made an apple pie until now. This recipe is pretty easy to make. I used pillsbury pie crust, followed recipe accordingly and I must say it's been quite a success. My house smells absolutely amazing! The Struesel topping came out a bit thick and pasty, which I didn't expect. It was kind of messy and sticky but I worked with it, spread the gunk it as evenly as possible and it's actually REALLY good. I rated this 4 stars because the topping was a real pain in the butt. If you're patient it's well worth it

I made two of these for a potluck, and everyone raved about them. I followed the recipe as it was written but forgot to put dots of butter onto the apples. That ommission didn't seem to matter.

The best dutch apple pie I have ever made!  Don't use a frozen crust though - make your own or use a refrigerated crust.  Very tricky to keep the pie from being too soupy though.  I used the trick of letting the apple slices sit out on paper towels before baking.

I made this for my BIL for his birthday and he loved it, so five stars based on his report. Super easy to make. I did have to bake mine about 10 minutes more to get the bottom crust browned (used a glass pie pan). Thanks so much!

This pie is amazing! I added an extra 1/8 cup of sugar and doubled the spices per others recommendations. It turned out so well! I used a whole wheat crust recipe from Very Best Baking that I have used before and it worked out great. Hands down, a great recipe!

Great recipe! I used half granny smith and half jona gold apples.  I also ended up adding 2TBL of tapioca to help the insides thicken.  I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust (from this site) for the pie crust.  I also used less lemon zest...maybe less than a pinch.  I couldn't find rolled oats, so I used 2 1/2 packages of instant oatmeal for the topping and it turned out great!

I consider myself a near-expert with cookies and cakes.  This was the first pie I have attempted to bake.  It baked beautifully, but needed an additional 20 minutes of baking time.  Also, the flavor was generally lacking.  I am not sure if this was due to my using Granny Smith apples, or if there weren't enough spices included.  I am going to bake another one, but use different apples and twice the spices and see if that helps.

If you take the lemon zest out...it may have made a 5 star pie, but that lemon zest was overpowering and ruined my apple pie!

I gave this a 4 star because I liked it better than my hubby did.  He likes plain crust on a pie while I like this type.  I felt it was really good and if just me, I'd give it about 4 1/2 stars - which can't happen, thus the 5 star rating.  If you are looking for a really good crumb/Amish/Dutch crust, this one is well worth trying.

Very good recipe.  I used 1/2 of Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe and made a deep dish pie in one of those cheesecake pans with the sides that come off.  Maybe because it was deep I had to bake it for about 50 minutes.  Mine seems like it could have used a bit more thickening but I really can't complain because I'm usually pretty bad at making pies!

Totally Two thumbs up!!!!  It was pretty close to perfect. After I made the pie and put it away, my family kept coming back for more to munch on. I do have a tip: If you are buying a pie shell, buy the deep dish one! I bought the regular, and the recipe makes more apple filling than you can fill the shell with! It ended up making 2 pies.

Excellent pie! We would definitely make it again - as recommended, we baked the pie crust for 5 minutes. We also added an extra T. of flour and nutmeg to the topping. It came out great - thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this recipe exactly as stated for several years now, for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It is a family favorite.  I really like the oatmeal in the topping.  The best combination of apples for this pie (I think) is Courtlands with Golden Delicious.  I will continue to make it.  My family will be dissappointed if I don't!

Made this just as was written and it turned out phenomenally!  Did cheat and use Trader Joe's gourmet pie crusts.  They are better than anything premade out there and the results are great.

I received numerous compliments on this pie and don't think I will ever make a different recipe.   I use 3 Granny Smith Apples, 1 Jonagold, 1 Cortland, and 1 Gala.  I read others tips and brushed the pie crust with an egg white, then baked for 5 minutes at 400 degrees before adding the pie filling.  For the pie filling, I increased the amount of flour to 1/4 cup.  For the first 10 minutes of baking, I baked the pie on the lowest rack.  Otherwise followed the recipe to a tee!!!  So good!

GO AHEAD AND PLAN ON MAKING 2 PIES AT ONCE IF YOU WANT MORE THAN 1 PIECE! ITS EXCELLENT!  ONLY RECIPE I WILL USE FOR NOW ON..I did do a little different:  Used 10 inch deep dish frozen pie crust and baked 10 min in 300 degree oven..used about 7 cups apples..increased flour/sugar little bit..no allspice or lemon zest..it was so good that I have to make it again 4 days later! I really pushed the apples down and piled the crumb mixture..looked like alot until it cooled and it was wonderful.

I wasn't so crazy about the spice combo in this- I think the allspice gave it a flavor I wasn't expecting, but that's just a matter of personal taste; it's overall a pretty good recipe.I used about 6 1/2 cups of apples to fill the crust all the way, and added some extra flour to account for that. I also left out the lemon zest- I just wasn't in the mood for it. Note that if you use unsalted butter, you may want to add some salt to the topping(which you will probably notice anyway, when you're eating the topping while you mix it-it is so yummy!).

Very good Recipe, first time I ever made a pie.  I did cut the apples to thick butthat is my fault and not the recipes. I used the flaky pie crust recipe ofthis site as well and that went good with this pie. Will definitely make this again.!

This is a very attractive looking pie. I used the Harden Your Arteries Pie Crust for the bottom crust. I made no changes. I used Granny Smith apples because I like those best for apple pies. This took four really BIG granny smith apples. Cooking time was accurate, I did have to cover it halfway through with foil to keep the top from burning. After it cooled, I tried a second piece. I found it to be a little flour-y. I think if I were to make it again, I'd use tapioca or increase the liquid or something. It kind of takes away from the pie's flavor. Otherwise, this is a great pie. NOTE: I suggest you pre-bake your crust for about ten minutes, and prick it with a fork before you bake it. If you don't, your crust might turn out soggy. And noone likes that.

It was good, but I don't know what I did wrong. Maybe I should have added another tablespoon of flour to the chopped apples, like another reviewer suggested..? It came out with a whole bunch of juices! It was like someone poured water into the pie after it was baked. I used golden delicious apples.

My husband absolutely loved this! Lemon zest in the streusel was fabulous. Try it! I thickened the filling additionally with 1 Tbsp. of quick tapioca as one reviewer recommended, but I think it made the pie too thick (I used granny smith apples). Next time I will make it just as the recipe says. I had to bake the pie an additional 30 minutes, but I am at high altitude, so that can be expected.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the lemon zest and it was really good!! I wanted a 'dutch style' pie but with a crunchier topping- this did it :) MMmmm!!

My husband really likes apple pie but I like apple streusel, so this was a perfect compromise. I did as one reviewer suggested and brushed the pie crust with egg white to prevent it from getting soggy, but it didn't work! I also used 3tbsp flour rather than the 2 as other reviewers suggested and will opt for 3 heaping next time as it was too runny. Delicious overall though!

I have NOT tried this recipe. But I do plan on doing so. . .I just thought I would let you all know that whenever I make "crumb" toppings, I use less butter, and substitute the sugar for Maple Syrup. And it is just tasty! Thanks so much!

I followed instructions exactly, and should have paid more attention to comments left by others. Filling was extremely runny and apples undercooked. Next time I will add less spices, and use tapioca in the filling. I would also increase the baking time at least 20-25 minutes.

This was a hit at my house.  I don't bake (if I can avoid it) so when I was asked for a birthday pie instead of cake, I panicked.  This was easy and tasty.  And I didn't mess it up.  Always a possibility when I am baking anything.  THANKS!

We love this pie!  It is so easy and so delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  I served it while it was still just a little bit warm because it smelled so good and we really didn't want to wait any longer.  It was just a tad bit runny but that didn't stop us from eating it and definitely didn't affect the flavor.  Today it is firmed up very nicely in the fridge.  When it is completely chilled, it slices cleanly and the layers of apple are just gorgeous!  Served this with vanilla ice cream, which was good, but the pie really can stand on its own!

Very easy and delicious - I used a cheese slicer to slice the apples and it was perfect.  The streusel topping is amazing - I kept it simple and served it with vanilla ice cream - it got rave reviews.

My first time ever making an apple pie and it was excllent!!  Everyone wanted the recipe at Thanksgiving.  The second time I made it though the filling seemed to be just a little too runny, so next time I'll add maybe just a little more flour.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was amazing! The spices seemed really concentrated when mixing but were perfect after baking. Oatmeal Streusel was a wonderful topping. Defiently one to add to te recipe box for Thanksgiving or Christmas.

This was the best apple streusel pie I have made! I used locally grown apples that were green and tart and put them in a normal pie pan and just piled the 5 cups of apples HIGH! After about 15 mins. I added the topping by pressing it on the apples (no sprinkling allowed with the tall pies!) I baked it about 50-60 minutes to make sure it was totally done. It was awesome! I am entering this pie in an upcoming local pie contest!

Too sweet.  It also took an extra 25 minutes to cook this pie.  Not worth all the extra effort.  One of my kids was put off by the "granola" on the top, but that part tasted fine.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used whole wheat pastry flour and reduced the butter by a third in the streusel.

I made a couple of changes to the recipe after making it once.  I did not add the butter to the filling and cut the amount of butter to the steusel topping by 2 Tbsp.  Also, I cut the amount of sugar in the filling by half. It still tasted great but not quite as sweet or buttery.  Also, I did not have allspice so I replaced it with cloves using the same amount. Anyone having a problem with this recipe must not have followed the directions carefully because it was bar none the best apple pie I have ever had.

This pie was really really good! The Oatmeal Streusel is delicious. I didn't know what apples to use, so I used a combo of Granny Smith and Golden Delicious and it turned out great. We topped it with vanilla ice cream while it was still warm. Soo soo good!

Yum. Yum. Yum.  This is the first time I have ever made an apple pie from scratch, and the family raved.

I did change the seasonings: no lemon zest in the topping, and I doubled the cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg and did just under a cup of sugar.

Very good. I did add a little extra flour to pie as others suggested. I think it was missing something. But everyone else loved it. Next time I will add some cranberries. Thanks

Wonderful recipe! I usually make a double crust apple pie, but everyone loved this variation, especially the kids. I hate Granny Smith apples in a pie (I know, I'm probably in the minority), so used American Jazz and the pie was perfect. I also added an extra tablespoon of flour as others had recommended, and used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon because my kids love cinnamon. Yum!

I first made this pie at Thanksgiving and got great reviews from my boyfriend, who is a very picky eater. The only thing I changed was omitting the allspice and lemon zest, which I didn't have on hand and don't care for. I made it again at Christmas, but use a little more than half the amount of butter called for in the topping because I had accidentally not put enough sticks out to thaw for that and the other recipes I was making. I was worried it would be too dry, but it actually turned out better. My family LOVED it, and I think it was actually one of the best apple pies I've ever tasted. Great recipe--I am so glad I found it, because Dutch Apple is my favorite!!!

I can not rate on the whole recipe because I make my own apple pie 'filler' in the fall and jar it but I used the topping and it was very yummy.  Hubby and I both loved it and will be using this recipe (for the topping) again!

My sister, who doesn't like pies generally, gobbled this one up. My husband said this was the best apple pie he ever had.  I loved the sweet, crumbly topping, and the perfectly cooked seasoned apples!

Really great! I followed the suggestions about the egg whites and the additional flour... tasted phenomenal!! I used a variety of apples and it gave it a little something extra from your traditional apple pie. ps. the streusel portion of the recipe makes enough for two pies...

I used this topping on my apple pie and it was like nothing I have ever had. I am not big on apple pies (living in the Northwest) I guess, but I loved this recipe. My sister-in-law likes nothing I cook and even she said this was the best apple pie she had eaten. I did do something diffrent but is was an accident. I put the toping on right away instead of waiting like the recipe said to but it still cook good and came out super. It'll looks real rich like maybe it's to sweet but it does not taste too sweet. So for you who love apple pie try this recipe, you will love it. One other thing, I used 2 diffrent brands of apples and it came out great !!!

Loved this recipe!  I did make some changes as per some other reviewers and it turned out perfect: 3 level tablespoons of flour mixed with the granny smith apples (not runny at all), didn't use any allspice, did put the lemon zest in the crumb mixture.  My family said it was awesome!  You definitely should try this recipe. It's a keeper!

I followed the recipe and this didn't work out for me at all.  The pie crust turned out great around the edges, but it was mushy and undercooked at the bottom.  The streusel, although tasty, got really crunchy and seemed a little dry.  The filling tastes great and we're still eating the pie, but I wouldn't want to serve it to guests.

Great recipe. Though the first time I baked it, apples came out crunchy like mentioned in previous reviews. So after mixing the sugar, spices and flour with the apples, I threw them in a pot and cooked them on the stove for probaly 10 minutes. Added the 3 tbs flour like someone else had mentioned and precooked the crust with egg white also. Came out perfectly. Much better than the first attempt.

I tried this on Thanksgiving and it went over very well. I added 1. C. of sugar so it would not be as tart.I did this because I used about 6 Gala Apples.Next time I may add another Tbsp. flour (3 Tbsp. all together) as so the bottom of the pie crust will not get to moist or soggie.
The topping was Yummy! Thanks~

I read the reviews of this before I baked it so I made sure to take the following steps: added extra flour, brushed crust with egg whites, and baked it longer. I still got a soupy mess with crunchy apples. The streusel topping was great, but I am very disappointed I wasted the apples I bought at a farm specially for a pie.

I followed the recipe 'almost' exactly and the filling came out way too runny.  I also would bake it about 10 minutes longer if I made it again, the apples were a little too crunchy for my taste.  The only thing I did differently from the originial recipe was that I used instant oats instead of rolled oats.  Definitely wouldn't do that again.  They didn't seem to cook entirely.  Overall, with a few changes this might be an OK pie.

This is a wonderful apple pie!  This was the fist apple pie I have ever made and it turned out great!!  I made two pies for the 4th of July and they were loved.  I followed the other suggestions and added 3 TBL flour and left out the zest...  Must try this recipie.

Delicious!  I added some chopped walnuts to it, but otherwise followed the recipe verbatim.  Absolutely delicious - this was my first "real" apple pie and everyone was thoroughly impressed.  Used 1/2 granny smith and 1/2 fugi, as another user suggested.  Tart and sweet (but not too sweet) - loved it!

Delicious pie recipe!!  It was a big hit for Thanksgiving when I froze one and thawed it that I had made during apple picking season.  Just used splenda instead of sugar.  Lemon zest was my favorite part!

Yummy pie and my father-in-law said it was "superb".  I was actually able to make two pies in normal frozen pie shells from this one recipe.  The streusel topping did not come out as crunchy as I would have liked - not sure why, but the flavors overall were fantastic - don't skip the lemon zest - it does add a bit of something to the taste!

I loved the topping, it was more like an oatmeal cookie topping than streusel to me!  Awesome and easy recipe!

If I could give this a 10 I would! I made two pies at the same time, and both were gone in a matter of a few days! I omitted the allspice and lemon zest b/c I just didn't have it. I brushed egg white on the bottom of the piecrust, and instead of freezing, baked for about 5 minutes.  Followed the directions in the recipe for the filling and the topping.  EXCELLENT!  Better than my regular apple pie!

This was incredible!  But I actually made this as an apple crisp rather than an apple pie.  I made 1 1/2 times the apple filling, and kept the amount of topping the same.  The spices in the filling are outstanding, and the lemon zest in the topping really makes it taste special.  This is going to replace all of my apple recipes.

Sooooo good!  I used an 8" frozen whole wheat pie crust.  I left the skin on the Jonagold apples (color + fiber) and diced them so they would cook.  Based on other reviews I used 3 Tbsp. of flour with apples (and they seem not too runny) and reduced the crumble topping by 1/3 (due to smaller crust).  I couldn't wait for the pie to cool all the way so I snuck and piece and mmmmm how good!  Definately going to use this recipe again.

This was a very good recipe.  I think that baking the apples in the crust before adding the topping is a good idea.  It prevents the topping from getting over done!  I was missing two ingredients, but it turned out very good.  I did not have the nutmeg, so I used more cinnamon.  I also was missing oats, so I added 3/4 of a cup more of flour to the topping.  I had made dutch apple pies before with just a flour/sugar/butter/cinnamon topping...it was good!  Thanks for your recipe.

I make many apple pies in the fall to freeze for winter use. My husband picked up a bushel of Cortland apples for me...and I decided to try a new recipe.  Am I glad I did.  This was a great alternative to the traditional two-crust pies I freeze.  The Cortland apples held up well and had a great flavor.  I liked the topping as directed; next time I may add some pecans for a little more flavor, though.

I wanted to make the apple pie recipe on the Splenda bag but didn't have two crusts.  I used that recipe for the Splenda pie and substituted top crust with this oatmeal topping using 1/4 c. of Splenda brown sugar blend instead of regular brown sugar.  It was delicious!

LOVED it! I jazed it up a little by adding about 1/2 cup of sour cream to the apples. I then diluted and added a couple tblsp cornstartch, and a few extra tblsp flour, just so that it wouldn't be too mushy. Very tasty! :)

I used home jarred apples I had on my shelf instead of fresh.  I did not add allspice, but used a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg.  The crumb topping turned out great although I had about 1/4 cup too much.  I wll make this pie again and reduce the topping.

This was good, but not perfect.  I really liked the seasoning in the pie, as I like a lot of flavor.  Some may find the allspice a little strong, however.  I felt like the topping was a little "much," and it seemed to overwhelm the pie.  When I make it again I will reduce all the topping ingredients (especially the sugar) so that the apples are better highlighted.

I had planned on making my usual 2 crust apple pie and a sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving only to discover I only had two pie crusts.  I chose this without any hopes it would turn out and so I threw it together as directed but w/o the lemon and allspice (had none)and sliced the apples thin and broke them up with my hands when tossing.  This was gone within minutes of serving it and everyone raved, personally I'll never try any other Apple crumb pie...EXCELLENT!!!

This pie reminds me of an oatmeal cookie with apples! It is wonderfully flavorful, but for my son I will omit the nutmeg and allspice next time. I increased the flour to a heaping 1/4 cup and baked the pie at 360 degrees for 50 minutes. I used cameo apples also and they were the perfect sweetness. I didn't use the lemon zest and used Pillsbury's roll out dough. I will definitely make this again and again!

The flavor was quite good, but it was very runny.  I will add more flour next time I make this.  I also added chopped pecans to the topping for a bit more texture.  My household really enjoyed this.

I made this pie about 5 months ago as a birthday gift for a friend(i know i'm a little late with my review!) I didn't have any of the pie, but I was over at his house the next day and the pie plate was licked clean! He said it was the best apple pie he'd ever had and he's very picky! So try this pie, it's a definite crowd pleaser!!

Very good!  I loved the topping.  Just don't pat it down so much and level it up.  It looks better all bumpy.

This is an excellent pie.  I made it tonight for all of my friends.  If you don't have the responsibility of kids or dogs I would recommend you make this pie every night.  Enjoy!

Very good, the crust was a little soggy in the middle.  I will cook it shortly next time before I add the filling.

This pie was good except I thought it had too much allspice and nutmeg for my tasting.  Next time I might use half the allspice and nutmeg and add more cinnamon.  This pie is very good with vanilla ice cream.

My family really loved this pie.  It was made with easy to find ingredients and even here in Penang, Malaysia we had a bit of good old American apple pie flavor.  I think it tasted better after one day in the fridge.

Great recipe! I actually made 4 of these last year throughout apple season, and forgot to review. Well it's apple season again and every function I go to they all remember this pie, so I am and will be making many more. I highly recommend you try this, you'll get raves from family & friends! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is fabulous. My family loves anything with baked apples and this disappeared at one sitting. I made this in a 10" deep dish pan, so I just put in more apples and more spices. Unfortunately, I only made the smaller amount of streusel that others had recommended. I won't make that mistake again! It was all delicious, and sadly, all gone.

This is a terrific apple pie. I was scared at first because the apples were piled up so high I though everything would run over.  Not the case. I did increase flour to 3 heaping Tablespoons.  This is a keeper!

I just made this tonight and it turned out great!  The topping really adds a nice touch to it, not to mention makes it easier and tastier than another crust.  I did up the flour in the apple mix to 1/4 cup as others suggested, but that was the only change.  I had Fujis and Goldens on hand and they worked great.  With the upcoming apple season, this will definitely be a staple in our home!  Thank you!!

The easiest and best dutch apple pie I've ever had.  The filling wasn't runny and there was the perfect amount of streusel.  The streusel formed sort of a crust on top.  Served warm with some vanilla ice cream and everyone will be smiles!

Like the other reviewers, I drained the excess liquid off of the apples.  It was fabulous, but next time I'd leave a little of the liquid...apples were a little firmer than I'd like.  Definitely a recipe that has made it in to my "forever" recipe box.

With a scoop of icecream...MMM, YUM! I loved the cruncy topping and not too sweet apple filling.  This is better than any Dutch apple pie you can buy from a grocery store.

I added 1/4 cup flour instead of the 2 tbsp, reduced the sugar slightly, and drained the apples after sprinkling them with sugar.  The pie was rather soupy right after I took it out of the oven, but perfect after it cooled.  Next time, I'll cut the amount of streusel by half.

After reading the reviews, I was nervous.  I didn't want it to be too soggy.  I used 6 apples, 4 granny smiths & 2 donagold.  All were pretty dry so I didn't have to drain the mix like one of the reviews said.  I used the whole oatmeal mix and loved it.  Also, omitted the lemon zest. This was a great mix of tart and sweet and mine turned out GREAT!!  We will be making this next holiday.

Blend of spices for filling ..perfect. However too juicy thus soggy bottom crust. Much to much topping for recipe.  I doubt I make it again.

Everyone loves this pie!  I like to use a variety of apples for really great texture and taste. The topping...Divine!  The kids really gobbled it up, even my husband liked it and he doesn't like sweets too much.

All the apple pie lovers in my family say this is absolutely the best they've ever had.   The only thing I changed was using fresh ground nutmeg.  I'm not a big fan of nutmeg and have found that fresh ground makes a world of difference in any recipe.

Great pie! This is my new go-to Apple pie recipe! I didn’t make my crust—I used a store-bought refrigerated crust. I didn’t freeze the crust, either. In fact, I let mine come to room temperature so it wouldn’t break apart while unrolling it. I also substituted a gluten-free flour blend for the AP flour. Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

So much better than canned pie filling pie. The topping is worthy of being its own oatmeal cookie recipe.

Great recipe.  My family loved it!  I used some gala apples that were getting a little old, also part of a honey crisp.  One important change.  I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup to mix with the apples.

I have always made my apple pies with a top crust.  I was short on flour  and made my pie with this crumble crust.  Everyone went crazy about this pie.  I have to admit I will probably not make another apple pie with a top crust again.

Put a scoop on top and wow! They do not come any better.

I have made this a couple of times now. It is exactly what I was looking for. I have an apple tree, an old fashioned heirloom tree called Early Strawberry. They are wonderful for applesauce but usually cook up too quickly to make a good pie (they make almost an applesauce pie when cooked the recommended time). So I bake this crust beforehand, put my apples in, and top with the streusel. I only cook long enough to brown the streusel and it's perfect! They are a marvelous, tart apple. So good!

I love the flavors! I tried it with fresh grated spices (with a bit more cinnamon than called for) and homemade pie crust and it was out of this world! The lemon zest gives it an extra something.

That said, I had the same issue with the filling being kind of a soup. Some of that may be user error, I could have drained off a little more of the apple juice, but I didn't want to lose too much of the yummy spice mixture.

With a couple adjustments, this could be a permanent favorite.

We made this pie and were pleasantly surprised. I took other reviewers suggestions and put the apples along with the white sugar in a colendar while preparing the crust. There was approximately 1/4 to 1/2 a cup of liquid that would have made for a runny pie. We used a store bought pie crust and as was also suggested by other reviewers,  baked the crust for 5 mins after brushing with egg whites. The bottom crust was cooked perfectly.   My husband and I have decided that we will never buy an apple pie from the store again.  This pie was just too easy to make.

Very good pie. I made some changes. I added an additional 1/3 C of brown sugar  and 3/4 tsp salt to the sugar/spice mix.
I added 1/4 C ground walnuts to the topping.
I lengthened initial baking time to 15 mins.
Simple and delicious.  I'll be using this pie and topping recipe going forward.

Delicious recipe! It was a big hit for our Thanksgiving dessert. The only thing I would change is that the streusel topping was a little dry. I would add another tablespoon of butter to the dry ingredients.

Amazing apple pie!!! I did the egg wash on the frozen crust and it helped. I also used 3 kind of apples - honey crisp, Granny Smith, and a fuji. Everyone loved the pie and said it was the best pie. I was told I will be bringing this to every family gathering from now on.

Great pie recipe. But definitely had to use the egg white trick and bake without filling 10 minutes so the crust doesn't get as soggy on the bottom, as a seasoned pie baker and has adjust baking time (I live 300 feet above sea level and needed 10-15 minutes more without aluminum foil) to get my streusel more crisp and slightly brown. Thanks for sharing!

This is my go to recipe every year for the holidays and everyone loves it. I cut out the allspice, nutmeg and lemon zest and use a pre-made frozen pieshell. I take out a stick of butter and let it soften for the topping before i cut it into the other ingredients.

I just made this pie with Granny Smith apples sliced thinly. Baked the first 10 at 450, the last 45 minutes at 375. The flavor is good, but the apples are still crunchy. Waaaahahaha !

I have an apple tree. It is an heirloom tree known as "Early Strawberry" and the apples are ready in mid July. They are tart and tasty for baking except that they are not crispy and soften too fast. The tree was renowned for applesauce and that's mostly what I do because they cook up so fast they usually have applesauce texture in a pie. But I found that if I cook the bottom crust first, put the apples in, and put a Dutch apple streusel top and only bake it long enough to brown the top, it's really good. I used this recipe and it was wonderful. I'm always on a diet, so I used white whole wheat flour, truvia, and splenda brown sugar blend as well as cutting the butter in the topping to 1/4 cup and not putting any in with the apples. It may have been more crumbly than designed, but it tasted great. My husband, who is not dieting, thought so too.

I put together the crust and filling first and had it refrigerate overnight (due to not having time to make the whole thing the next day), and drained off the excess liquid that had collected before baking. There was another review that mentioned it was soggy, this may have been their problem.

I used this with Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe. (Surprisingly, I baked a Sweet Potato Pie I recipe, and that crust turned out horribly, LOL!) I was actually surprised that I actually like the finished pie. First, the crust did not have the consistency of beef jerky (yay!). I used 2 granny smiths, 2 golden delicious, and 1 gala apple. I had 2 galas, but while I love eating them, after tasting the slices alongside the GS and GD, they didn't have much to offer with regard to taste. The streusel topping mixed up quite well, though I had to add an extra tablespoon or so of  butter so the crumbs were big and moistly packed instead of small, loose and dusty-like. I added chopped walnuts. The only thing I wish I added was about 1/2 teaspoon or so of salt to either the filling mix or the crumble. Maybe because I substituted the allspice with cloves/ginger, I thought the flavor lacked in depth. It was sufficiently sweet (I use 1/3 cup white and 1/3 cup brown), but it wasn't really flavorful in an exciting kind of way. I was expecting the tartness of the GS (and lemon bath) to balance out the sugar, so while I wanted to add a pinch of salt, I decided against it. Nevertheless, I actually baked this for a love interest who's suddenly disappeared himself. So it'll be flavored with PURE SPITE, and I will enjoy eating every last piece by myself. For whatever it lacked,  this pie is still too good for him. And so am I!

Excellent apple pie! I cooked it a wee bit differently - placed oven rack on lowest position, preheated to 425, did not freeze the crust, skipped the foil-covered pre-bake and put the streusel-topped pie in the 425 preheated oven and immediately turned heat down to 350 and baked for 1 hour. It's spectacular.

This is so good. I decided to make it because I love apple pie and apple crisp and this is like a combo of both. I used a mix of fuji and granny smith apples. After reading other's reviews, I used 3 tbsps flour in apple mixture. I also brushed crust with egg white before adding apples. I didn't put crust in freezer and I used a store bought crust. Absolutely the best. Will make many times over. Oh and I also let it rest an hour before slicing just to help it settle a bit and not have liquids run.

Delicious! I made exactly as the recipe said, no changes. It was pretty liquidy, which made it impossible to dish out pieces that were pie-shaped. Even being a little messy in the bowl, once I topped it with a scoop of ice cream it disappeared in under a minute! The juices mix well with ice cream, and my husband made me promise to make this recipe "forever". I bet the juices will solidify a bit overnight, or I could tweak the recipe a bit, but honestly, it tastes AMAZING the way it is. YUM!!!

Absolutely amazing! The only change I made was painting the crust with egg whites (rather than freezing). New family favorite. Will definitely make again!

I followed this recipe to a T, except for omitting lemon zest and adding a bit of cornstarch to the apple mixture. Other reviewers mentioned using tapioca starch as a thickener but I didn't have any. The pie looked and tasted great; however, it was super watery. When I sliced the pie it was all soupy and the bottom crust essentially washed away. This was rather disappointing, thank goodness I didn't make it for guests. The good news is, it tastes great and I'm just going to pretend I made an apple crisp.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I made two of them.  I used Fuji and Granny Smith apples. I made the first half of the recipe - minus the crumble topping- in the am. Let them cool and put them in the fridge to finish later in the evening.   They turned out perfect... 
It is my husbands new favorite dessert.

This is a very tasty pie. The crumb tops it off apples were tender. They should have told people to let it sit and cool before you cut into it. If you don't it will be like liquid.. Mine turned out good.

I use this recipe just for the streusel topping to make apple crisp. I use oat flour instead of regular floor to make it gluten free and it comes out perfect every time. This is one of my favorite dishes to make in the fall or when I have a lot of apple lying around.

Fantastic!! I used the suggestion others posted to pre bake my frozen pie crust with egg white. I thought they the pic was way to high up but then realized that it worked out perfectly. I used gala apples ( discount apples bag from Kroger) This turned out absolutely fantastic and it was not runny and wet at all.i sliced the apples very thin and this made them cook evenly. Also don't forget to have ice cream it's a must!

We all loved this pie!! Except for the lemon zest. It was way too overpowering, so much so that we ended up just eating the bottom half and just nibbling at the top. And I always make my cinnamon measurements on the extremely heavy side, so it was very good that way. Also, I didn't freeze my crust, and it turned out fine, just had to cook a little longer for the topping to brown.

I've been making homemade pies since I was in 4th grade.  This is one of the best apple pies we've ever made.  It set up really well so it looked great on the plate.  I loved the flavor and texture.  I didn't add butter or allspice and made my usual crust.  Other than that, we followed the recipe.

I made this for my boyfriend. I bake a lot, but I've not made many pies. This tasted very good. Instead of store bought,  I made a crust from this site. The filling was a little watery.  I may add a bit more flour next time, but I will make it again.

The mistake I made was on the struessel topping. Make sure your butter isn't overly soft. I forgot to take mine out of the fridge to soften and put it in the microwave on defrost for a few seconds. It seemed ok until I added it in.  It made the strussel  more of a dough rather than crumbly. However, I was still able to put it on top. It hardened while it baked and still turned out awesome. Two other things i changed were: I let my pie crust thaw out before baking and I also baked my pie for 45-50 mins. Not 35. But this recipe is on point! So yummy!

This was exceptional! I followed another reviewers suggestion of adding a heaping tablespoon of Tapioca to the apple mixture, as well as, brushing the crust with egg whites, letting it dry and then baking for 5 minutes before adding the apple mixture and baking. (I didnt freeze it.) The crust came out perfectly, not soggy at all. I used granny smith apples and the combination of tart and sweet was perfectly balanced. I will absolutely make this again using these same suggestions. Delish!

Made it as written and it was fabulous. Baking time was longer than noted in the recipe. Slice apples very thinly to get that stacked look and to be sure that they bake correctly.

Made this for my family - Christmas Eve dinner. It received 5 stars from everyone! I took the advice for the crust and brushed with a beaten egg white and baked it for 7 minutes @ 375.  I also cooked the Granny Smith apples (used about 10 or 11 medium sized & sliced thin) in a heavy iron skillet for 5 minutes then added the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg mixture but used 2 tbsp tapioca instead of flour and cooked another 10 minutes. Added Apple filling, baked for 10 minutes, then put the streusel topping on and baked for 25 min. with foil placed on top. I allowed the pie to cool for several hours to allow juices to set before cutting. Served w/ vanilla ice cream.

It was delicious! Because I was making two pies, I doubled most of the ingredients, but not the butter.  Still super good!

I've made is pie three times now and everyone is asking to make it as a new holiday tradition. It's easy to make, even for beginners like me.  It's sooo good it will make you look like a professional pastry chef.

I made a few tweaks after the first pie. I used instant apple cranberry oatmeal which gives it a slight tang and emphasizes the apple flavor in the topping.  Also try the filling with a touch of ground cloves. I also did not freeze the crust and increased the initial cooking time mixture to about 12 minutes.  Lastly, I sliced the apples thinly and layered them evenly in the plate to make sure they evenly cooked through.

I baked it much longer -- 15+ minutes, and the bottom was beginning to burn so I had to take it out.  Too much topping; the filling was just barely bubbling through.  .; I'd omit that, add a a little corn starch to make the filling hang together better, and a little more sugar to the apples.  I used apples from our tree; they were softer and sweeter than the usual pie apples, so they did cook through.  Not sure I'd make this one again.

10/25/15 ~ I'm not an apple pie eater, but my family is.  They said this pie is wonderful and the oatmeal streusel makes the pie.   I did not place my crust in the freezer before starting.  I did brush with egg white and let dry while I proceeded with the recipe.  My pie was done at the 35 minute mark.  A pie the family enjoyed and I would make it again.

This pie was absolutely delicious! I did not change a thing. The lemon zest was AMAZING...at first I wasn't sure, but it gave the oatmeal crumb part a boost of flavor. The spice was evenly balanced and not overpowering at all. The  granny smith apples came out just right. Served warm with caramel drizzled over it was my fav! Be careful with the caramel though as this pie is quite rich. Other than that...I have nothing but rave reviews for this delish dish!
Oh! Quick Tip: If you do not want to make a pie crust here is a quick step I chose instead...buy the Pillsbury deep dish pie crust instead...Follow the crusts directions for baking along with this recipe and you will be set for a successful turn out. I did and I loved it...no one could tell I had used a store bought crust...it was flaky, buttery, and very very close to the one I usually make from scratch. Hope this helps..Happy Baking!

Very good pie! I didn't make any changes but I may use a bit less sugar next time. There will be a next time! I used butter flaky pie crust which was perfect.

The pie was yummy. But the pie was quite soupy and the apples were undercooked.  If I make this again, I would modify to address these issues.

I loved this recipe!  I used 3 Jonagold and 2 Golden Delicious apples.  The main change I made was the baking time.  I followed the guidelines regarding temperature but overall I baked the pie for nearly 1 hour. I also added walnuts to the streusel topping, the result was delicious!

Made exactly as posted.  My apples were a little thicker (I like a little crunch left in the pie), so It took a little longer in the oven.  VERY good!  Got race reviews from friends and family.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. It was very easy to make, I substituted sugar with sweetener that can be used in baking. It tasted wonderful and I served it warm with vanilla ice-cream. My family loved it! I also made these individually as opposed to one big pie. Really wonderful.

I hate cinnamon but I love apple pie, only the british kind without gobs of cinnamon. My husband likes cinnamon and apple pie though so I searched for an answer and this pie was it. I followed the ingredients exactly and it has the perfect amount and combination of spices to be very tasty but not overwhelmingly cinnamon dominated or filled with dark brown goo. This pie is perfect. The only thing I would do is bake the crust for 5-10 min empty with the edges covered and then follow the recipe as it instructs. Great pie; it is the only one I make when I make apple pie now. It's always a big hit. Oh, I also cut my apples into chunks per my husband's request, but I do prefer them sliced like the recipe calls for. And I use Gala apples which come out beautifully.

Wow, this is the best apple pie recipe! I read suggestions on here and added the tbsp of tapioca which was definitely needed. I used Granny Smith apples and it was a hit at Christmas.

Wonderful pie. I doubled cinnamon & omitted the lemon zest. I love lemon but not in apple pie...a personal preference. I did cook pie a tad longer but every oven is different. I suspect if a pie is too watery, maybe putting the sugar on apples & let them sit before baking causes the apples to weep & sugar dissolve. I did put the crumbled topping on pie from the beginning. I just covered crust edges for 35 minute, uncovered & baked 35 more minutes more.

This pie is so delicious, I hesitate to make a "regular" apple pie again.  If I could, I would give it 10 stars.  This recipe is similar to one I had 40 years ago and lost.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Everyone LOVED this pie! I don't really like pie all that much and I even LOVED it! I added salt to my streusel because I only use unsalted butter and it was great! I also put my apple in lemon water to make sure they don't brown then drained the water and put the sugar and spices in there and I also added some of the liquid to the pie which cooked out and it turned out really moist! SO delish! For my apples I used Granny Smith and fuji apples mixed up! gave it a sour sweet flavor!

Makes too muh streusel topping (and I truly can't believe I'm saying this).  The topping was very thick & flour-y.  I would cut the amount of flour in the topping WAY down.  THEN this pie would get 5 stars from me.

I have made this recipe so many times . It is the best apple pie I have ever had. The only thing I would say is make sure you mix the apple filling and drain off the excess liquid.

BEST TIP EVER: Freeze your butter solid, then shred it with a food processor. Makes it so much easier to work it into your recipe! I doubled the flour, added 1/4 tsp salt to the filling, and 1/2 tsp salt to the topping, and I used 6 cups of apples. The apples were just done enough. This may have been the best pie I've ever made. Thanks!!

This is soooo goood! I did make a few modifications based on how I traditionally make apple pie. I added a few sliced fresh pears in with the apples to add a little sweet to the tart. I didn't have any lemon zest, so I used dried orange peel. I couldn't taste the difference. I doubled the crumble recipe (since one of the reviewers raved about it, but turns out I really didn't need to... I have enough for a second pie, which I plan on making later this week. Also, my streusal crumbles were a little dry, so I did brush the crumbles with melted butter, whiched helped make the crust golden perfection. YUM!

Like some other reviewers, my pie came out very soggy (there was actually a pool of liquid in the bottom of the pie pan) not sure if I had abnormally juicy apples or what happened. The flavor was great and we loved the crumble topping.

Would consider making this again but would need to experiment with how to improve the consistency and thickness of the apple portion of the pie.

Good recipe. I omitted the lemon zest and baked for 20-25 minutes longer, removing the foil for the last 5-10 minutes.

I tried this recipe for the first time today and it was a big hit. I did not use a frozen pie shell though. I made a cinnamon sugar pie shell and baked it a little first and then added the filling, baked the 10 suggested minutes, added the topping and finished baking. My husband who is not a fan of apple pie said he would so eat apple pie now thanks to this recipe.

This apple pie was amazing!  My son requested for his birthday pumpkin or apple pie, so I made the pumpkin and decided to try something new for the apple pie.  I have never made a great apple pie..... till now!  This was delicious.  I did not add the lemon zest (did not have) and next time I will add tapioca (which I did not have today either)as I always add that to help thicken friut pies.  Other than that,I followed as the recipes states and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!!

This pie was pretty good. I used Golden Delicious apples which, I usually love but, I would have preferred a more tart apple with this recipe. I didn't have any problems with a runny filling like I've had in the past with other recipes so, I thought this was great. I did like the oatmeal streusel topping but, I think I just prefer a regular crust. That's just me though. All in all, a good apple pie recipe that I will probably use again. Thanks!

It was our first attempt at pie, and it went over pretty well. We used a store bought crust.  The streusel topping wasn't my favorite, so I subbed it out with a streusel I make for coffee cake and that worked wee.  A very uncomplicated recipe that tasted good.  It probably won't be anyone's favorite, but it's good.

Just made this. Looked over the recipe 3 times to make sure I didn't miss a step in regards to cooking time. I baked the pie an additional 25 minutes with the foil off to allow for crust and topping to brown. Apple's weren't done after 35 min. Taste is good.

This might just be the best apple pie i have made! i left out the lemon zest and didnt measure the apples. i used 8 granny smith. then followed the rest of the recipes. i had to bake it about 15 minutes longer than stated. i like that there wasnt a bunch of extra ingredients that overpowered the apple flavor.

Been looking for a long time for the perfect Dutch Apple - as I remembered from high school years.  I absolutely love the hint of lemon in the topping - it gives it the unique touch that I was looking for.

This was very good! Followed directions as stated except for time and it turned out great.  My oven doesn't read true so I baked the pie until its juices reached the point of slow bubbling around edges, approx. 45 minutes.

I have been able to find good pie recipes for every kind of pie except apple......until now.  Now with this recipe I can say that apple pie has been mastered.  I have requests for this pie all the time.  Tastes like expensive pies you get from a country market.  The trick is slicing apple extra thin.  Perfect pie!!!!

I have made this many times & always get many compliments.  I do put extra cinnamon  & a dash more lemon juice with granny smith apples. I often get requests for this oie for potlucks. The sweet crunchy topping & tart apples are a great combo!

This pie is so sugary sweet it kind of makes your teeth hurt and its so runny, you may think you've made a soup rather than a pie. I notice that almost every person who's rated this pie has altered the original recipe somehow. They seem to have the best results.

I omitted the pie shell, added some oats to the apples, and added crystalized ginger to the streusel to make an apple crisp type dessert.  It didn't last long, people loved it!

very good! i was afraid that i would be disappointed in this recipe because there is nothing "special" about it but when i tried it, i was very impressed. i thought it would be dry but its not, i used a bit more sugar than it calls for, turned out great!

This was really delicious! I love pies with a crumble topping as opposed to a pie crust top...it's like having a fruit crisp and a pie in one :)  Yummy!  Hubby loved it too.

After tweaking the recipe 2x, this pie came out perfect!  I had to use Macintosh apples and cook the pie at 425 for a total of 50 minutes (10 before topping, 40 after topping was added).  The first attempt was under cooked at such a low heat and for only 35 minutes after the topping was added.

to cut carbs (and work) a little, I have been dispensing with the lower crust. I just bake the filling with a little tapioca, as suggested by another reviewer, and then bake on the streusel topping. Always a well-received dessert.

I would definitely make this pie again. Will be the only apple pie I ever make! I made it for Thanksgiving and we were too full to eat it. I had a little taste while it was still warm and it tasted great. We had it cold for breakfast with ice cream and it was amazing!

PERFECT!!!!  I've never had one complaint about this pie by ANYONE! It's a little saucy, but I love it that way, and if you serve it cold from the fridge it thickens up even more.  I love this pie so much I even eat it for breakfast sometimes. A+

This pie is so easy to make and delicious!  I love the streusel topping.  It made a lot, so I actually didn't quite use it all.  Also, instead of using 2 T flour, I used 1 T flour and 2 T instant tapioca.  This helps thicken the filling.  Overall, a great recipe!

This pie was delicious and very easy to make.  I didn't have any of the problems that others seemed to encounter. I bought a frozen pie crust and baked it right in the aluminum pie pan it came in.  I will definitely make this again.  Everyone loved it.

Made this for the first time yesterday. Next time I would omit the lemon zest, and reduce the amount of cinnamon, all spice, and nutmeg - it was a tiny bit overpowering. Great pie though! Everyone who tried it, liked it.

enjoy the taste.. the topping turned out.. interesting. flavor and texture wonderful, but all that butter melted into the pie.. when  i cut into the pie it was a little runny. most of the butter pooled into the place the slice use to be. very buttery taste.. i like.. but i think i might need to relook at the topping and try that again.

AMAAAZING! I will no longer search for a Dutch Apple Pie again. This is it. Soooo good. I just use about 8 or 9 apples piled way high on the dish. Use a lot more of the seasoning than asked for and the same with the topping. After it cools it shrinks down a lot a leaves a pretty little hump on the pie. Sooo gooood!

Absolutely the best apple pie ever!!!  In the past my apple pies were a hit and miss, sometimes too watery.  The only thing I did per a couple of other reviews was to add a bit more flour and some tapioca to ensure that it wasn't too watery.  It is an awesome pie - Thanks

I used the No Roll Pie Crust II and put it in the refrigerator while I was making the pie filling.  I cooked the apples, flour, spices, and butter on the stove until the apples had cooked down slightly and the filling thickened.  I prebaked the pie crust for 5 minutes and then filled it with the cooked apples, and the topping.  The pie turned out really good. (I omitted the lemon)

Filling gets 5 stars, streusel gets 3 stars. The streusel had a pretty good flavor, but was too dry and flour-y. I'll try again with 1/2 c flour, 1 cup oats, and 3/4 cup butter, and the same spices as the filling.

This is Dutch Apple at its finest.  I am a nut for adding small bits of healthy into my recipes, so I used a crust with part whole wheat flour, and I loved that this streusel called for oats.  I left out the nutmeg, allspice, and lemon zest (picky parents).  I love apple pie in all forms, but this is one of the best.  I will make this one over and over and over again.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! The topping is awesome! I did a banana apple pie cause I didn't have enough apple. It tasted great! Probably the best pie I ever made. The only thing I did different was the way I cooked the apple mixture. I mixed all the ingredients like it says but instead of putting it in the pie crust and cooking it in the oven I cooked the apples in a pan.Not for very long but enough so that they were a little tender and then I added the streusel part. It turned out awesome and easier for me LOL! This is definetly my thanksgiving/christmas apple pie recipe!Thanks for posting it!

This recipe was great! I used my sister's pie crust recipe for the crust, whih is pretty simple, just flour, butter, and ice cold water. I also double layered the top crust by placing a regular pie crust on top of the streusel topping. Because I did that it took a little longer to cook, but everyone at home and at work loved it! I definitely plan a repeat for the holidays. Plus, be sure to put a baking pan underneath the pie pan to catch an overflow of filling! :)

The pie itself is wonderful.  I wasn't too crazy about the topping, however.  It turned out dry and rather hard, but did soften a bit after a couple days covered in the refrigerator.

This was a good recipe -- easy to follow, beautiful presentation etc.  I got many compliments on the pie, and did feel like a hot shot when people asked where I bought it.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because like other reviewers mentioned, the addition of the allspice was a nice added depth of flavor, but maybe a little too heavy for my taste.  I will definitely make this recipe again, just easing back on the allspice a bit.

This is a GREAT pie! I made my own crust and I used the suggestions and brushed with an egg wash and put it into the fridge while i was preparing the apples. I did not bake it. It really made a difference. I also cooked it covered for almost 1 hour. I like my apples really soft and it cooks away the liquid. Also, I baked it on my lowest rack in a glass pan and the crust was perfect.

I'm not a fan of apple pie, but I make it for my husband and kids. This recipe was so good I will not make it any other way now.  It was a combination of apple pie and apple crisp. Very yummy!!!

This was a great pie! I had never made an apple pie before and was a bit nervous.  I think I might of used the wrong kind of apples cus they did not shrink during cooking...they stayed piled high. I did use 3Tbs of flour and brushed my shell with egg and did not freeze.  My crust still came out a little soggy but the pie was good.  My son said he did not want a piece cus he said he does not like apple pie but ended up having two pieces. Very good..will make again

This apple pie is absolutely delicious! Its a big hit for family and friends and I make it at every holiday. I gave it 4 stars because I did make changes based on other reviews.

I found the last line of the instructions misleading - I thought the pie needed to be covered with the foil the whole time, but the topping came out totally uncooked and I wasn't really able to salvage it. It smells great and I'm sure it's yummy, but it doesn't look right. :(

I made this for work and the reviews were beyond positive.  I went to get a piece after putting out in the common area and it was already gone, 10 minutes in!  I used a frozen deep dish pie crust and baked it for 5 minutes before putting the apples in.  I made my topping in the food processor and it didn't have that oatmeal look, but it tasted wonderful, and browned nicely without foil on top.  The only thing I omitted from the recipe was the lemon zest.  I used Gravenstein apples that made a beautiful inside, firm and tasty without being mushy.  5 plus stars!

this was excellent. I used a homemade crust and put it in the freezer. I thawed 8 cups of thinly sliced apples that I froze last fall, patted them dry and used as directed. I also took the advice of others and added 2T tapioca. Substituted cloves for the allspice, used a little extra cinnamon and omited the lemon zest. I also never covered with foil.  My hubby who was sure he wasn't going to like it, LOVED it! Will be making it for my in-laws tomorrow.

Just finished making this pie and it is tasting really good. I took the advise of other reviewers and omitted the lemon zest.  However, for the filing instead of using white sugar I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and found it sweet enough.  For the streusel top I found that it was not crumbly it was soft I added more oats, flour and sugar.  This may be because I used margarine, will use butter instead the next time.

Very very good dutch apple pie! My family absolutely loved it too! Next time that I fix this pie, I will use less oats though and leave it in the oven for about 10 minutes longer.
