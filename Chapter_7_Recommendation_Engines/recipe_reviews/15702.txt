As for the flour/butter alteration dispute, it is how you add it that will make the difference in the result. I dissolved the flour in the melted  butter before mixing into the rest of the ingredients and my pie was velvety rich, smooth and delicious. If you want to impress them at Thanksgiving, this is the one!

Wow - no wonder all the reviews for this recipe were so positive!!! Made this last night. Following the suggestion of another reviewer, I added 1/4 cup of butter and 1 tablespoon of flour. This is truly the PERFECT pecan pie recipe! Cooked it for the exact time stated, and after it cooled it set perfectly. I will pass this wonderful recipe on to my daughter - Thank You!!!

I tried baking this, but I used some of the suggestions in the review box. DO NOT ADD BUTTER to this, it won't solidify if you do. The recipe was probably fine as is. It actually tasted very good, but the extra butter really ruined it. I would also suggest adding a lot more pecans. 

I can tell this recipe will actually taste good, though, so I'm going to make it again - I just won't add in any alterations from the comments ever again LOL.

This was the first pie I have EVER made and all I heard was, "This is the best pecan pie I've ever had." My dad, father-in-law, mother and a few friends all loved it. I added a 1/4C butter and a tablespoon of flour to the recipe. It set up perfectly. I also added whole pecans to the top of the pie to give it a nicer presentation. I was asked to make this pie for both of my family Thanksgivings! Will be making this pie for the rest of my life!

I used this pecan pie for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I did add 1/4 cup of butter and 1 Tablespoon of flour as suggested on a review. The trick is to melt butter mix with flour then add to other ingredients. Cook for the exact time stated turn off your oven an let it cool on the oven rack. It will set perfectly. I also added pecan to top . thanks for this recipe it was easy and tasted great.

I had never made a pecan pie, so I came here searching for a good recipe for a tough crowd at Christmas.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I altered to some of the different suggestions offered in prev. reviews by adding a tbls. flour and 1/4 cup butter.  Not only was the taste amazing but was firm even after setting out most of the evening.  This one is a keeper and a hit with my family.  Thanks!

I made this pie for a party I had to attend, and everyone said it was the best pecan pie they had ever had.  I did switch the white sugar for brown, added the 1/4 melted butter and 1 tbsp flour.   I will be making this again many times.

Very good! I think it would taste even better with more pecans and brown sugar instead of white. After 40 minutes baking, the center was still a bit runny but it set as cooling down.

I followed the recipe exactly. I made two pies; one for home and one for others. Across the board the response was that the pie was good. I didn't get a great. There are some other pecan pie recipes on this site that got better reviews. I probably won't make this one again. Thank you.

I just can't seem to fix a recipe as directed and this one is no different.  I added half a stick of butter (I hadn't heard of pecan pie without butter) and an extra egg.  5 stars all the way-it was perfect fixed this way!  (sorry I messed with our recipe Pat-I couldn't help it!)

Great pie! Not too sweet, but still sweet enough & the right texture.  I did follow the reviewer who mixed melted butter (1/4 cup) and flour (1 TBSP) together and added to the mixture.  This pie came out perfect.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Any recipe from a 78 year old baker who says it's her mother's recipe HAS to be a winner in my book!  I made this as my first 'from scratch' pie ever (I'm a cake person) using the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe.  The pie baked perfectly ~ was set in the middle right out of the oven and the flavor was delicious! The crust was very flaky!  I did use the tip of adding the 1/4 cup of butter and 1 Tbls of flour.  I've never thought Pecan Pie would be one I'd like but I fell in love with it becuase of this recipe!  The only change I may try eventually would be to use brown sugar rather than white.  This was a wonderful pick for my first ever totally scratch pie! Thank you so much for posting it to All Recipes.com!  Aunt Tilly

I've eaten a lot of homemade pecan pies, & the filling is never smooth & creamy like the commercially produced ones. It's always runny &/or clabbered looking - ewww. Well, THIS recipe was awesome! Super smooth filling...just can't say enough good things about it. The only thing we did different is that we added the EXTRA 1/2 CUP PECANS as another viewer had suggested, & I think that it was needed. Also, our pecans were a combo of large broken pieces & halves, not chopped. I think that one thing that may have  made a difference is that we beat the mixture really well with a fork before adding the pecans & baking. The sugar was pretty well dissolved by the time they were added. Also, you may want to cover your crust EDGES ONLY with foil strips at the beginning instead of waiting till mostly baked. It was really a pleasant surprise because this was our first time ever making a pecan pie! Thanks sooo much for the great recipe!!!

I never made a pecan pie before because I thought it was too complicated!  NOT SO!  This was an awesome pie.  I followed the advice of others and added the butter and flour...it came out perfect.  Thanks everyone!

This was the first time I ever made a pecan pie.  I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar(my preference) , but followed the rest of the recipe just as it says....this was the best! My family loved it and wants me to make more for Christmas.  I didn't bake any longer than the recipe said, I let it cool for an hour and it was perfect!!!! You can't mess this up!

This recipe was PERFECT!  Definitely a perfect Southern Pecan Pie.  I made the other recipe titled "Pecan Pie" which has the Allrecipe Symbol beside it and it doesn't even come close to this one.  Plus, the other one was much too complicated and difficult to make and no one really liked it in my family and extended families.  This one - Pecan Pie III - is the way to go.

I hate to give too poor a rating because I didn't follow the recipe as posted.  I folloed the suggestions to add butter and flour.  When the pie cooled I ended up with pecan soup.  I will stick with the recipe on the Karo syrup from now on, since that has yet to fail me.

For the life of me I could never get this pie to completely set, even after cooling for a considerable amount of time.  I put it back in the oven for a good 20 minutes but to no avail, still soup.  Sorry, Pat.  Possibly a tablespoon of flour would help?  I'll investigate.

Don't mess with perfection.  Make the pie exactly as directed in the recipe.  We accidently burnt the top of one and it was still good.

This is an awesome pecan pie recipe.  My husband said it is the best he has tasted.  I did as one reviewer and added the 1 TBSP of flour and 1/4 cup of butter.  Cooked same amount of time and it turned out awesome.  This will be added to my holiday recipes for sure.

The pie never set, no matter how long I cooked it.  The pie crust was also mushy even though I followed the directions.  Under no circumstances would I try this again.  I was doing a test run for Thanksgiving and I thank God I didn't try this on Turkey Day.

My advice to all is do not fool with perfection.  This is the BEST pecan pie I have ever eaten.  I've tried  many of the variations recommended  but I found that it was no where as good as Pat's grandmother's pie Thank you Pat!!

I don't even like pecans and I'm going crazy over this recipe. I made it in a deep dish pie shell, so I used 3 cups of pecans. I added another 1/4 cup each of corn syrup and sugar, an extra egg, and a bit of extra vanilla. This will be my holy grail pecan pie recipe from now on. YUM.

I added the tblsp of flour and 1/2 cup of butter as recommended and even my 72 mother said this one is a keeper and I agree!  After baking the pie shell, I covered the edge of the pie with foil so it wouldn't burn.  Turned out perfectly set - not runny at all.  Will definately be sitting on my dining table this Thursday (Thanks Giving)!!

Yummy and I never knew making pecan pie was so easy.  Used with Best Ever Pie Crust from this site and it was a huge hit.  Next time, I'll probably go 1 1/2 on the filling ingredients since I like a deep dish pie (it may have been my pie plate, too).  But this was great and definitely beats the freezer pecan pies I'm used to!

there's no bad pecan pie but this one lacked a little something in the filling...maybe  butter/ or maybe brown sugar instead of white. my father in law liked it though and it was easy to make.

this recipe is excellent, i have tried so many and this one came out perfect, i,  just did a tiny change, instead of light corn syrup, i went for pure maple syrup: more expensive, but gives it a richer taste. i also cut the white sugar in half and substituded it with brown sugar, finally i wanted a spicy taste to it so added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. will sure bake one for christmas!

The only thing that disappointed me about this pie was my store-bought pie shell (NOT doing that again!!). I didn't measure my pecans, but I'm certain I used more than 1 cup- probably 1 1/4 cups. I used 1/2 cup honey and 1/4 cup butter in place of the corn syrup (mine had gone hard as a rock, didn't realize that before I started baking!), and it still turned out wonderfully. I think that substitution will become a permanent part of this recipe in my kitchen from now on.  We served this pie warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side- SO GOOD! Very easy to make, about 5 minutes to stir it together and get the whole thing in the oven.

This is the first pecan pie I've ever made and it was awesome! I accidently put in a whole cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup but it was still just great!

This pie was delicious, although a little dense to cut through on the day I made it.  The day after the texture lightened and was great.  I used a pre-made graham cracker crust so to keep this pie lactose free.  I used 1  1/4 cups of chopped pecans.  I may have over baked the pie by 15 minutes(in my convection oven) since I forgot to check the pie after 30 minutes as suggested.  I will make this pie again.

Very yummy!  I took advice of other reviewers' and melted 1/4 c. butter and dissolved one tablespoon flour into that.  It was soooo good, the first pie I've ever made...thanks for a great recipe!

I have tried a few other pecan pie recipes, none of which have turned out well. This on the other hand was simply great. I substituted brown sugar for white and took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4c melted butter and 1 T flour. It set up beautifully and had a wonderful taste. I will definitely make this one again.

The best! With adjustments. Melt 1/4 cup butter and LET COOL first before making the filling. Replace white sugar with BROWN sugar, and remove a couple of tablespoons from the 3/4 cup called for. Use 1 cup broken up pecans PLUS pecan halves for the top. Bake until top is cracked, and let cool slightly before slicing to prevent the runny mess. Actually, if yours is runny, its underbaked. I have made this pie twice already and its not runny at all. Will try to cream the butter & sugar, then eggs next time and see how it works. Maybe it will puff up in the oven more than usual, but I guess it will subside when cooled. At least no more melting! Will let you know after I have eaten all of the 2nd pie I made!

The only thing that made me rate this a 4 star and not a 5 was that it was runny in the middle when I first cut into it. It definitely was delicious, and once my family got past the runny stuff in the middle they raved about it.

Very very good flavour, but took a REALLY long time to get it to set up in the middle.  Maybe I did something wrong, although I thought I followed the recipe to the letter.  I ended up over baking it just to get the middle cooked. Still, it didn't last 24 hours at my house.  Will definately try again.

I used dark karo syrup and white sugar. I added 1/4 cup butter and 1 Tbl spoon flour. Melted butter & added flour to butter & dissolved, then added to rest of ingredients.  Added pecans last. Also coarse chopped pecans & used 1 rounded cup. Best pecan pie I ever made, and I have made a lot of them over the last 50 years. I baked in a Breville convection oven @350 for 37 mins. Perfect!

I've never been a fan of pecan pie, as the one I tried years and years ago was sickenly sweet.  However, I made one for my neice last night using this recipe and now I am a loyal fan.

I did add the butter and flour, and used half a cup of brown sugar and 2 tbsp of white sugar.  I was distracted by a phone call and even managed to leave out the vanilla and salt (!) yet this pie STILL turned out to be amazing.  It was a little loose in the center as the recipe says, but it set perfectly once cool.

It was such a hit with my husband and neice that I'm trying to decide if I want to leave the vanilla and salt out next time on purpose!

I think precooking the pie shell for 5 minutes really made a difference, great tip! This was the best pecan pie I've ever made! I also added the butter and flour to the mix, and it worked great, it had a perfect consistency :)

Easiest pecan pie I have ever made and it turns out every time.  The first time I made it I put in a tablespoon of flour because pecan pies don't always set but didn't need it.  Yummy...I will make it again and again.

By far, this is the best pecan pie I have ever tasted. I felt so proud when my boyfriend, whose favorite dessert is pecan pie, loved it. As for the flour/butter mix, I halved the suggested amount and mixed them together before putting it in the rest of mixture...Absolutely PERFECT!

I did not care for this recipe. After baking and cooling for designated times, this was still as runny as soup. Good thing I had an apple pie to serve as well for Christmas dessert.

I couldn't find my old recipe for pecan pie, so tried this one.  I did notice that it was different, but was anxious to maybe shake things up with a new recipe.  Well, I broke the cardinal rule and made this recipe for the first time for Thanksgiving.  This recipe was not good!  I decided to stick with the recipe as written, and thought everything was going just fine.  Well, it would not set - it never did.  The body of the pie stayed liquid no matter how long it cooked, then sitting on the counter, so we ended up with no pecan pie.  Thank god my friend had brought the pumpkin or there would havebeen no pie at all and my lovely holiday dinner would have been missing dessert.  After a full 24 hours on the counter I finally gave up and scraped the pecans off.  At least we had candied pecans to eat.  This recipe is a waste.  Luckily, I have now found my old recipe and will stick with that one from now on.

Great recipe. It was a little too sweet for our taste. I'll omit the sugar next time I make it. Took a while to sit but that was okay. Turned out great in texture. I added 1/4 c of butter and 1 tablespoon of flour like others suggested. Will be making this again!

I cooked this pie and went to sleep. When I woke up it was gone. I complained and my mother said she would make another. She did . It lasted half the time as the first one. I was satisfied. This time I got some of the pie. The next day she cooked two more. It must be the perfect pecan pie.

I liked the smooth texture of this filling. Most fillings can be jelly-like. Will make this again.

I tried many other pecan pie recipes to no avail. This was my LAST attempt at making pecan pie myself. It was great!  I added the flour and half the butter, the pie was perfect. My husband liked it as well and wants me to make it again. Thank you for saving me from buying supermarket pies.

I will try this pie again before looking for a better recipe. Next time, I will try the following modifications as recommended by others: substitute brown sugar for the white, add 1/4 cup melted butter, add 1 Tbsp flour. Also, be sure the pecans are chopped well.

WONDERFUL!! Never made Pecan Pie before--even though its always been a favorite. I added the flour and butter along with using half brown sugar---I was out but had splenda br. sugar---next time I'll try all splenda--it was splendid! Thanks

This recipie is great. I'm pretty novice when it comes to pies so the simplicity of this recipie was very helpful. I took the suggestions of the other reviewers and added 1/4c butter and 1 Tbsp. of flour. Several people told me it was the best pecan pie they'd ever had. My sisters boyfriend said he didn't even like pecan pie but loved this one!

This pie recipe was incredible!  I followed the recipe but added what other users recommended.  1/3 cup of butter then I substituted brown sugar for the white (much better flavor) and then added 1 Tbs of vanilla (I make my own with bourbon whiskey and vanilla beans).  I always make the crust 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat.  The perfect pie.  My father told me it was better than the pecan pie his mother used to make.  Now thats a complement coming from my dad. :)

I have never made a pie in my life.  Feeling quite domestic yesterday in my single life and decided to make my favorite the pecan pie!  It turned out amazing,  I'm sad that I have no one to share my first pie with.  So I share with all of you who know.   Thank you so much,  It actually is the best pecan pie I have ever tried.

I made this pecan pie for Thanksgiving and it was devoured!  Everyone loved it!  My husband said it's the best pecan pie he's ever had!  I followed the advice of others and added the 1/4 Cup butter & 1 Tablespoon of flour, and it firmed up beautifully.  I used a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla-butter-nut flavor, instead of 1 full teaspoon of regular vanilla.  I also crushed the pecans up pretty fine for more of a "crumble" type top.  Thank you so much for this simple, but absolutely delicious recipe for a traditional holiday favorite!

Update: This pie was excellent! Great taste, everything a pecan pie should be. I will make this one again! It was gone by the end of Thanksgiving day. Note: Made this exactly as recipe is written. Original review:I will update on taste, as I can't get into this pie until tomorrow afternoon. It turned out very dark, so I am worried I over-cooked it. I made another pecan pie from this site that I made last year and it has a light, golden color to it. Will update...

This pecan pie was really tasty - I made it for Thanksgiving.  I did find that it took longer to cook (the middle was way too runny).  We finally took it out of the oven and let it set and cool a bit - we ate it but it was still runny.  My husband had never had pecan pie before and he said it was the best pie he's ever had and he even made one for himself the following week (it tastes better the next day also).  Overall a terrific recipe and will make again.

It is the first time I make pecan pie, it turns out really good.  My husband loves it.  I just can't believe how easy to make this delicious pie.  But just a little bit too sweet for me.  Next time I will put less sugar.

I have been making this particular pie with the addition of butter and flour for 30+ years. As stated above, it is best to mix the flour in with the butter ahead of time. It gets rave reviews from my immediate family, extended family and friends! They always look forward to my pecan pies over the holidays and I always make sure my dear brother has one for himself =0)!!  I do double this recipe and cook at least an hour for them to set properly and I have always used Imperial for this recipe.

I have made several great pecans pies before, but this was easily the worst. The pie was near overcooked and it was still runny. I would love to give this recipe just one star, but I did the flour/butter alteration instead of the original recipe, so it wouldn't feel right.

My daughter made this for thanksgiving yesterday and it was amazing.  As others said, the middle wasn't firm when we cooked as directed, but it firmed up perfectly once we let it cool. Highly recommended - my favorite pecan pie ever.
Thanks for submitting it

Perfect just the way it's written.  This was my very first Pecan Pie, and I was incredibly impressed.  Not too rich, and it set up just perfectly.  My husband doesn't like pecan pie, but he is thinking about having a second piece (he tried it just because I made it).

Not my favorite at all. My husband said it tasted like the store bought minature type pies you buy. I will not be making this again.

My partner asks me to make this all of the time.  It's REALLY GOOD.  Although - sometimes the inside comes out perfect and other times it's really runny.  Not sure what that's about, but whatever - grab a spoon and GET IT!

Wow!  An amazing pecan pie.  Not as cloyingly sweet and gooey as other pies, which is a plus in my book! I added 1 TBSP of butter to the syrup mixture.  I will certainly use this again.

Wow!  I just made this tonight, practicing for Thanksgiving.  Awesome!  I did add the 1/4 cup butter and tablspoon of flour and it was perfect! I added pecan halves on the top and my husband loved it!  This will be on my table in a couple of weeks!

I followed this recipe exactly. I have to say I was disappointed with how it set. It had great flavor but I was nervous about not cooking it longer than the recipe stated because it looked soupy in the middle after the 45 minutes in the oven. The recipe says to not overbake it but I had faith and hoped it would set after it had cooled. Bringing this pie over to a friend's dinner I was embarrassed to see the first slice cut out only to drip and ooze over the server. It had completely cooled at this point and still hadn't set! Perhaps if I had popped it into the fridge for a few hours it would have set better. If I ever decide to make pecan pie again I will try that.

This is the first time Ive tried this recipe. It worked perfectly as written --- with the addition of 1 tbsp flour mixed into 1/4 cup melted butter and then added to mixture. I checked it at 30 mins and it was still VERY jiggly, so 45 mins was perfect. If I can do this right...anyone can. Its awesome and satisfied my craving for pecan pie...

This is my second failed pie. I made this exactly as written, but added a little more time at the end. I'm not very experienced at baking pies, and I live at a high elevation - I wish I knew how to fix "soupy" pies. I used a store-bought refrigerated crust, put it in a disposable metal pie tin, and used sea salt. Testing at 45 minutes, the center was quite liquid and the crust wasn't even browned. So I added 5 minutes, which barely improved things - but I heeded the warning to "not overbake". I wonder what would happen if I cooked it a lot longer - would the filling finally "set" sometime? As it is, this was disappointing - the taste was good, but appearance- and texture-wise it was a gloppy mess. (I usually read all previous reviews before posting my own, but I'm skipping all 129 this time.)

I followed the recipe exactly how it was written. Even after the pie has cooled down it didn't look or taste done after baking for 45 minutes. So I put the pie in the oven for another 15 minutes and let it cool. I did not like how this pie tasted. I've made pecan pie before and will not use this recipe again.

Great taste and it looked great. But when I cut into it was not set all the way and it was a bit runny; I even added the flour/butter addition sggested by others. It was still great though- esp. for my first time!

dark corn syrup makes this 5 stars without any whipped cream necessary.  I get raves and recipe requests every time i bring it to parties and I ALWAYS have to make 2.   If you like the nuts more than the filling, reduce the corn syrup by 1/4 c. and increase the nuts by 1/4 c.  This slight change CONVERTS non-pecan pie lovers...including myself who only tried this recipe to please a boyfriend

I made 2 pecan pies for Thanksgiving, one fr. the back of the Karo's bottle and this one.  This one won overwhelmingly in terms of taste, just the right amount of sweetness and pecans, but the center just didn't set for me.  I added 4 tbsp. of melted butter w/ 1 tbsp. of flour as other reviewers suggested and I think this really improved the taste, but may have contributed to the pie not setting. This tasted so good that I'm willing to play around with it to get the texture right. I hope another 10 minutes in the oven will fix this!

I made this (exactly as written) for Christmas, and my guests raved about it. The taste was outstanding, and it was very easy to make. The only problem was that after 45 minutes, the filling was still wobbly all over, not just the center. I baked it for another 10 minutes, then took it out and let it cool for about 1/2 hour while something else was in the oven. However, the center still had not set in that time, so I put it back in the oven for another 10-15 minutes. That seemed to do the trick. It was certainly not overbaked. I will definitely make this again, with a longer baking time than the recipe calls for.

I added a couple of pats of butter.  This pie is wonderful.  Mine set up just fine.  My husband loved it and wants me to make another one today. This is now our favorite pecan pie recipe.  I was worried at first because the part that ran over in a pan dried brittle hard.  But all was well.

I tried the recipe twice- once, exactly as it said and the second time I baked it even longer.  Both times it came out like soup.  Won't attempt again- you'll never know if it will set!

I tried this recipe last night for a Thanksgiving party. It was really tasty except for one problem: when the pies were done baking, they were still very loose in the center. The top baked perfectly, but the inside was really runny. I would suggest adding some flour, maybe 1/4-1/2 cup to the mixture before baking. Otherwise, great recipe!!

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great. One thing, though...it was a bit runny, but my oven might have been low on the temperature side. The pie firmed up when it was cut anyway, and the 10 slices of pie disappeared in a matter of minutes!

My pecan pie lover husband said this is delicious and it sure is a keeper.  However, I made couple of changes.  I used honey instead of corn syrup, added 1 tbs flour and 1/2 cup of pecans on top.

This was the first pie I had ever made and it was very good! I made it for my Mom's b-day and she said it was the best pecan pie she had ever tasted! The pecans tasted wonderful and it wasn't too sweet. I did add 1/4 cup of butter and 1 tblspn flour and it turned out good, but next time I might omit those. I also had to bake it at least 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe said, but it could also be my oven. I highly recommend this recipe!

This is by far the best pecan pie I've ever had, as long as you add the butter and flour as suggested by other members.  Definately a keeper and if I could give this six stars I would.

Two thumbs up!  I read all the reviews and I added the butter and the flour.  It was my first time making a pecan pie and it was a hit at Thanksgiving.  I slighly burnt the crust, but that didn't stop anyone from eating it.  This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe was ok, I have made better pecan pie recipes than this. I tried it and we ate it, but I think that I'll stick to my other recipe.

This is the first time I have attempted to make a pie & this one was a winner! It was so easy, there's no going wrong with this recipe. I did use the suggestions others provided, 1tbsp. flour & 1/4 c. butter.  I will be making this delicious pie again & again!!

First time to ever make pecan pie- and everyone raved about it! I made two for thanksgiving- neither one lasted long. Great way to please the father-in-law, for sure! I added 1/4 c. butter and a little flour as suggested by other reviews. Easy recipe, will use again for sure.

Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly and the only reason I don't give it five stars is because mine came out a bit runny...I will adjust for this but this is a new staple for my pecan pie...will make again, Thanks!

Great recipe, turned out a very nice pecan pie. I added about 1/2 c extra nuts. Used pecan halves because it's our tradition. Worth making, good enough to keep this recipe.

I thought I'd try making a different pecan pie. It was good but not great.  I went back to my old recipe which has a little less sugar, a little more corn syrup and 1/3 cup melted butter. However, this time I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract.  Finally, I have the perfect pecan pie recipe.  My friend and "official pie taster" agrees.

Not only is this recipe quick and easy...it is DELICIOUS! It isn’t quite enough to fill a deep dish but still baked up beautifully (I did take advice of others...1 TBS flour whisked into 1/4 cup melted butter). This is not too sweet either. Just a delicious nutty flavor. My husband says I’ve outdone myself!

My mom had given me her recipe for pecan pie. I stored them all on my computer and lost many of them. She is gone now and my sister has most of her recipes. So, for Thanksgiving I took to all recipes to find her recipe and I did. This is an easy and delicious pie! Thanks for sharing

It was my first pecan pie and it was delicious!
I blended the flour and butter as other reviewers suggested and used my own crust. I will definitely keep and use this recipe again. I made it for my boss for his birthday.

I have NEVER had a Pecan Pie NOT turn out so I was so disappointed and upset when my Thanksgiving pie didn't turn out. Not turning out is an understatement - when I pulled it out of the oven - I even let it cook 5 minutes longer than it stated too - to make sure it was done and the knife came out clean.. It was perfectly set up. I let it cool for a couple hours - then put it in the fridge. Why then the next day was it like water. You would have needed a straw to eat it. I was so upset but I am so confused as well. What could have happened? Any ideas?

I made this pie exactly like the recipe called for and nothing else. I baked it for 45 min. took it out It was real runny in  middle. I let it cool then cooked it for 10 more min. took out cooled, still runny. I put it in for 8 min. speed bake. took out let sit all night and in the morning it was still runny in the middle. We sliced it and ate what we could. Good taste even if it was real sweet and runny. I won't make this one  again.

Excellent, and a far better outcome than my first pecan pie... anyway to keep the crust from sticking to the bottom of the pie plate, though?  Pretty pie slices would have made this a 5 star!  ** edited a few days later and upgraded to 5 stars:  even with the sticking my 80 year old uncle said it was his best pecan pie EVER... and I have been requested to repeat at Christmas!

I should have tried the original recipe first, before the butter and flour fiasco. I'm sure the recipe would be fine, just as written, and I do not recommend the alternative. I will definitely try this again "AS WRITTEN", and am sorry I didn't do it that way first. I wish the people that add the butter and flour would put a picture up of that pie, cause it did not look like the beautiful pie there now.

This was like one of those "Way Too Sweet" Pecan Pies you have at someone else's house. It was a little mushy inside when I cut it and the slices didn't present well. After 40 min. in the oven, it was very loose, cooked 3 min more, still too loose, 3 min more, still too loose but removed it. I"m looking for a firmer less sweet pie.

I made this for my mother and grandmothers birthday lunch. SOO yummy, everyone had seconds! My mom asked what recipe I used because she always had a hard time finding a pecan pie recipe that would set at our high altitude. This pie set perfectly. I added the butter and flour as recommended in some of the other reviews. I will definitely be making this pie again.

This is a good pie, thickened very well just as the recipe is written.  I don't feel any changes need to made.  A small piece goes a long way, sweet and nutty.

Tasty, cooked as directed and ended up with an inch of watery syrup in the pie pan. If I use the recipe again, I will add the flour and butter to thicken it up. Otherwise, very tasty and good.

Came out really well, but the top of the pie and the crust both burn very easily. :[ A little too sweet for my tastes, I would reduce the amount of sugar to a little less than 1/2 a cup.

Very easy and very good. I bought the wrong pie crust and the shallow one didn't hold all the mixture, but I followed the recipe otherwise in measurement and time and it was awesome! thanks! My brother took home seconds which is saying A LOT!

For Thanksgiving dinner with my family last year, I made my first pie with this recipe. The only thing I did differently was that I used a frozen pie crust for convenience. Just so you know, MY FAMILY IS ADAMANTLY REQUESTING IT AGAIN!!!! Thank you,  Sun Flower :)

this was just OK for me. I followed the recipie as intended. If you follow the directions it says to cook 45 min middle of pie will be loose. The reality is that the whole center of the pie is loose. I kept cooking it expecting the center to firm and I think it over cooked some. Not my fav. pecan pie.

Good basic recipe. We didn't think it was overly sweet or rich for pecan pie. We made the recipe as is and it took between 40 to 45 minutes to bake.

I'm a novice when it comes to making pies and pie crusts, but when I was called upon to make a pecan pie for my family's Christmas gathering, I knew it had to be perfect--I did a lot of research and decided on this recipe, following the advice of other reviewers (adding about 2 tbsp. flour and 2 tbsp. butter.)  I also added an extra 1/2 c chopped pecans.  The pie came out wonderfully!  (Well, aside from the fact that the crust I prepared from a Martha Stewart recipe was a bit crumbly.)  This pie was not as terribly sweet as other pecan pies and the texture less runny, making it less overwhelmingly sweet. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again!

I substitute 1-2 cups of oatmeal instead of the pecans to create an oatmeal pie ..and since I love pecans and walnuts, I add some to the top. Goes great with cinnamon ice cream.

This recipe worked great.

Husband & I loved it.   The taste was great and it was easy.  I used 6 small kebbler pie crust rather than 1 large pie crust.  My husband says he normally doesn't like pecan pie because they are to sweet but he said this one was perfect because it wasn't.

This was the best pie ever! I took the advice of adding butter and flour and also added an extra cup of pecans. It was fabulous!

I have never made pecan pie before, but I will be making it now.  I added 1/4 cup butter and 1 T flour like others suggested and I was amazed at how well it turned out.

I cooked this in a dark non glass pie pan and it came out really dark so I was worried it would not be good.  I was wrong! It was amazing!

Best pecan pie I've ever had, hands down.  Per other reviews I added 3 Tbsp. melted butter and 1 Tbsp. flour.  I don't keep corn syrup around so I just mix white sugar and spring water until I have a syrup (isn't that all corn syrup is?)  Thanks for sharing!!

My first attempt at pecan pie, and it turned out quite well. A big hit at Thanksgiving.
