Tried it as written, but didn't like it broiled. As another reviewer suggested I tried it again, but baked it and it came out great. Will bake it from now on.

This was super simple and turned out pretty good. I used a 12 ounce salmon filet an it was perfect. I think it would be a little too sweet for our liking if I would have used this much sugar and maple on only 6 ounces. I'll try grilling this the next time I make it to see if I cannot get it caramelized more than the stove did. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.
