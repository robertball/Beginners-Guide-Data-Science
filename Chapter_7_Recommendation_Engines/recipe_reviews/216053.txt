I made these after my daughter wanted them (because of the TV show), but the entire family enjoyed them.  We've made them several times.  There is something so tasty about the flavor of the corn taco shell and the spaghetti together.  The contrast of textures is very nice, too.

I made these because my niece kept talking about them and how she loves them and boy I'm glad I did.  Something so strange turns out so delicious.  I added a meatball for the guys in my house along with a little mozzarella.  They are a great way to use leftover spaghetti and perfect for a quick meal.

I made these for my kids as well.  The star rating will vary based on the type of spaghetti sauce you use.  Not something I want often, but it made my kids smile and that's what it's all about!

my daughter requested these kind of as a joke. so i made them as kind of a joke. we were all a little surprised at how good they were!! i added a pound of ground turkey, about 2 Tbls each cumin and chili powder to kick up the flavor. warmed the shells a little, filled them with mixture, topped with a sprinkling of oregano, parmesan cheese, and mozzerella. then put them back in the oven for a couple minutes. the fam went back for seconds!!

I cooked this last night for my iCarly loving daughter and she was thrilled!  We added about 1/2 lb of ground beef and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top.  Served them with salad and it was a meal that the whole family LOVED!

These took only a few minutes to throw together and are very inexpensive. They tasted surprisingly good  for what they are.

LOVE THIS:) are there any kids that don't watch that show?? LOL They really do taste pretty good but the biggest thing here is that the kids get to eat something they saw on tv! I usaully add ground beef to mine too and it's optional if you put it in the taco shell since not everyone wants theirs that way.

I have followed this recipe exactly in the cooking class.  Students loved it.  This year I changed from the angelhair to spaghetti squash.  Students loved it even more!!!  Saved a ton on calories and fat.  I also use sugar-free spaghetti sauce (Hunt's) for the sauce.  TERRIFIC!!!

Okay, this is totally one of those weird combinations that just works!  As many people have said, we made these after much pleading from our children after watching episode after episode of iCarly.  I did add cooked ground beef to the spaghetti sauce.  And surprisingly enough, these were pretty tasty!  You should definitely try them!  Messy, but super yummy!

We heard about them on iCarly, too.  The corn tortilla taco shell just makes the spaghetti taste so good.  Plus, it's fun.

This is literally a meal you can make in 3 minutes. (If you have left over spaghetti.) I had plenty left over and remembered seeing this on this website.  My son said he had always wanted to try it because of the TV show.  We placed shredded cheddar cheese on top of the spaghetti.  It really was a good meal.  I was hesitant at first, but I had two tacos with extra cheese.  I would make this if you have little one's in the house.

We too made these due to the kid's TV show, but when we looked elsewhere we saw that they added fresh cilantro which made these simply FABULOUS - also, for the extra taste and protein, we always added meat sauce to our spaghetti before filling the tacos!

I made these for my son, (he had seen it on a t.v. show) and lo and behold, these tacos were GREAT!! I wanted it to be alittle more filling, so what I did was cook a pound and a half of hamburger meat,  add a pound of tomatoes, diced,and two cans of tomato sauce.  Cook these all together for about 30 minutes.  
I also chopped half a head of Iceburg lettuce, also chopped a few more tomatoes, half a bunch of Cilentro and some HOT peppers for me.  I added the speghetti in the taco shells, then put the meat sauce on top of the speghetti, THEN added the lettuce, tomato and cilentro.  These were SO good that several neighbors (3) come over whenever they know I'm cooking these tacos.
Most importantly, my son KNOWS he has to eat the tomato, cillentro and lettuce BEFORE he can get to the meat and spaghetti.  These tacos are messy to eat, but really, they're SO good!!!

Sorry...these are just...weird.  Love tacos.  Love spaghetti.  Just not together!  When I made this for my kids, ages 9 & 5, they thought I had lost my mind.  I thought they'd get a kick out of them.  No such luck.  Pizza in the oven as I type!

These were awesome! I made my own sauce by cleaning out the fridge (diced tomatoes, chopped onion, minced garlic, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, etc...). It's a bit difficult to "stuff" them, but the end result is pure deliciousness. Thanks for the creative idea, mamakitty.

Well, I tried these for the same reason as everyone else - the TV show!  And guess what?  They were surprisingly very good.  I put turkey meatballs on the bottom, covered them with shredded mozzarella and filled the rest with spaghetti!  I will be making them again soon!

I had to laugh when I ran across this today.  My son begged me to make these after watching the show, so I did.  He talked his younger cousin in to trying them and she loved them too!  Now they have something special to share when they get together.  The rest of the family refuses to eat them, and my sister-in-law refuses to make them, but I enjoy making them and eating them too!

It's a fun dish.  The combination may seem strange but the crunch of the taco shell with the spaghetti is actually quite tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

I made my Spaghetti Sauce the way my family normally eats it with meat and home canned.  Used thin spaghetti noodles because that is what I had on hand.  My kids and I LOVED IT.  I know for sure there will always be taco shells when we have spaghetti from now on & what a great way to use up "left overs"!!!

Slight modification make INCREDIBLE flavor improvement.  When you're simmering the spaghetti sauce, mix a packet of Old El Paso taco seasoning with water according to packet directions.  Add the taco seasoning to the spaghetti sauce.  Simmer for 20 minutes on low so the flavors will blend.  Add browned groud beef if you wish.  This significantly changes the flavor and is deeeelish!  You'll love it!

These were pretty good.  I used regular spaghetti noodles because that's all I had, which may be why they were sort of hard to eat.  Very messy!  I added Bob Evans' Italian sausage and used Parm cheese on top.  Next time I may try adding some shredded cheddar cheese or Fiesta cheese to give it more flavor.  Kids liked it and overall it was pretty decent and super easy!

Who would have thought?  These are really good!  I haven't made spaghetti in over 5 years because of having it so much when I was younger, but these made me suck it up and make the forbidden food.  My husband and I have decided that we may have these once every few months. I made this 'as is' the first day. For the left overs, I added hamburger & sausage and they were amazing.

I'm not sure what exactly I was hoping for when I made these, but they were exactly what they said they were... Spaghetti Tacos. I usually love texture variances like this in a dish however, these were just not great.

As a kid who grew up watching iCarly, I wanted them so bad but my mom wouldn't make them so me and my friend made them at her house. All I can say is Spencer had the right idea when he took leftovers and put it in a taco shell! I totally forgot about them and can proudly say they are kid friendly!

Have have made these for my kids too. Pretty much for the same reasons.... The TV show. I sprinkled the taco shells with garlic powder before I baked them. Then sprinkled parm cheese on top. I think I liked it more than the kids.

I won't even lie- I'm in my 20's and watch icarly when it's on, and one day had a craving for these, it's very good like you wouldn't even expect! the crunchy cheesy and tomato-y just works, and it's like mexican crunch+ italian seasonings, comfort food

Even after reading all of the "surprisingly good" and "better than I expected" reviews, I was still thinking these were going to be just 'ok'. Well, I have to admit that this is going to be another "better than I expected" review, because they were stellar. This is a great recipe for one of those "I want to make something different but I don't want to go out and buy a bunch of ingredients" nights, because most of the ingredients are very common. Putting mozzarella cheese on top also was a nice addition.

After being asked several times to make spaghetti tacos I have in. I am giving this recipe 5 stars because I did not make the spaghetti as described in the recipe. I thought it would be better with a southwestern style spaghetti. So I added red and black beans (drained and rinsed) along with corn (drained) and some cumin (1 teaspoon) into my regular classic style sauce made with half ground beef and half ground sausage to equal one pound, and from a kids perspective it was awesome, from an adults perspective it was okay. Was worth the try. I added a picture.

The kids loved these!! I had never heard about Spaghetti Tacos but they had and when I mentioned them they were so excited. I thought they wouldn't be good but even Dad loved them!! I had made spaghetti and used that with some added cheese. The shells cost $1.00 and the rest was leftovers and they loved it..........can't beat that!!

My kids(ICarly fans) love this dish! Tried again, this time added meatballs (sliced in half to better fit in tacos) and taco seasoning mix. The added taco seasoning was too spicy for my taste--but my kids still devoured them. I agree with previous reviewers "great meal for left over spaghetti". (side note: also tried with wrap/soft tacos--works too).

Surprisingly good! I didn't have crisp taco shells so I fried up some small flour shells I had on hand. I also added ground chicken to my spaghetti sauce. My kids approved!

My kids LOVED this idea from watching the show also... I tweaked the recipe though. My kids love ground beef so I browned 1lb of Ground Beef, drained it, added one small can of Goya Tomato Sauce (the one with the green label that has cilantro in it), 1 pk taco seasoning, 1/3 cup of water. I combined it all with the cooked pasta. It was a hit at my house...even my boyfriend liked it.
