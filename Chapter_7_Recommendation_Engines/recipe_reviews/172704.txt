Made it without marinading...just threw everything together after browning the steak strips in the oil.  I doubled all the other ingredients and completely forgot to add the tomatoes. (the main reason I chose this recipe) Still Delicious!  Oh, I did use fresh ginger that I was trying to use up instead of ground.

This is great the way it is. I wish people would review the recipe not add there own sweet and sour version of it. Add a new recipe with your sweet and sour version. I think it inappropriate to add in the comments.
Thanks for your original recipe Mrs Wilson.

This recipe immediately went into my recipe box!  Will definitely make it again.  My dinner plans changed so the meat marinated for 24+ hours and was very delicious - I would recommend marinating at least a few hours or overnight.  I only used red & yellow bell pepper and green onions because I had no fresh tomato.  Added garlic and crushed red pepper for extra kick.

This was the best pepper steak recipe I've tried! I gave 4 stars though because I added garlic and didn't use tomatoes, but that's just a personal preference for me.

Looking over the recipe I noticed I was to add a lot more sugar (sweetness) than I knew I’d like, so I reduced it significantly, probably by more than half.  Also, I sliced the meat considerably thinner than the 1/2” the recipe directed. (Freezing the meat briefly, 20-30 minutes, makes this much easier. As for the preparation, I did that a little differently.  I cooked the meat first, set it aside, and then cooked the onions and red, yellow and green peppers, combining it all at the end.  I certainly didn’t want to take a chance of overcooking the meat.  We did enjoy this, but I think it would benefit by the addition of garlic and, in my opinion, by the omission of the tomatoes.  What I particularly liked about this dish was its flexibility (add or use any meat and stir-fry appropriate vegetables you like), the fact that  we generally have the ingredients readily at hand to prepare it, and that it’s nutritionally sound.

This is a great base recipe. I had 1 1/2# of beef so I doubles the sauce, and I was glad I did to have plenty. I omitted tomatoes (didn't have any). Used fresh ginger.. the balance is pretty could in this recipe but at the end it needed a tweak. I added garlic.. 2 cloves... 2 tbls. of oyster sauce.. yumm.. would definitely use recipe again with these modifications..  thanks

MrsWilson, Thank you so much for posting this recipe! My mother had this same recipe which I could not find. The only thing I remembered was the recipe came from a box of cornstarch and had tomato wedges. Again, thank you so much for posting, my search is over and time to cook.

This is delicious! I had a few sirloin steaks and decided to try this. I trimmed off the fat and cut the pieces into thin 1" pieces, so they cooked in the 3 minutes or so suggested. I finally found the method to getting stir-fry to crisp, and not steam, by cooking 1 lb in 3 batches even if more will fit in the pan! I didn't have a green pepper, so I used an orange one with the red. I probably cut those a little smaller than suggested also as well as the onion. For the red onion, I just used a 1/2 of a large sweet yellow onion. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used 1 can of diced tomatoes very well drained. This smelled so good while it was cooking. It doesn't make a lot of sauce, but it isn't loaded with oil like take-out stir-fry either which I liked. I used low-sodium soy sauce and it didn't seem to be a problem. I served it over brown rice, from the rice cooker. I would make this again. Thanks

This was really good. I doubled the sauce for 1-1/2 pounds of steak. Added about 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. Also added 1 teaspoon of crushed red pepper near the end f the cooking time. Used red & yellow bell pepper instead of green. Did not use tomatoes.

Great and simple. If you like more sauce to go over your rice like I do, double all of the sauce ingredients EXCEPT the cornstarch. Turned out great.

Surprised to actually see this recipe here.  
This is the first pepper steak I ever made and that was too many yrs. ago to think about, but it is still the best and always well received.  
Thanks for reminding me of it.

EXCELLENTE!
I was craving for Chinese food, but didn't want to drive to town. And I found this recipe.
OMG! This is so wonderful! I marinated the beef overnight. The beef was to tender. I added sliced celery and YELLOW onions. I remembered to add tomatoes. I added the tomatoes last just before serving and after I turned off the stove so as not to overcook the tomatoes. First, I cooked the meat in 3 portions. Do not cook the whole batch of meat at once or it will become soggy and watery. Then I combined all the meat and veggies and cooked it for 5 minutes. I also added oyster sauce. 
PERFECTO!

Good. I think it was better with chicken than beef. I made it all at once putting the chicken in first, then veggies, and lastly the beef. I would add more ginger next time. Did not use tomatoes because I forgot.

Great flavour. Doubled  Sauce mixture cooked . As directed..added water just before serving to thin out sauce. We like extra sauce to cover rice and it didn't ruin the flavour.

This is a great recipe!  I prefer using fresh ginger (2 tsp) , and it really punches up the flavor.  I also add a little beef broth to the marinade, as I cook brown rice in it to add flavor there. The tomatoes are a fantastic addition.  Also, any type of onion works - I've used red, white, yellow or even scallions (my favorite). I've also made this adding celery and/or mushrooms. You just can't go wrong here.

This is a keeper! An entree has to hit three bells to earn a spot on my Weeknight Dinner roster: 1) Inexpensive, 2) Non labor intensive (which, to me, is very different than simply "fast". I don't care if what I'm making takes an hour to COOK as long as it doesn't require an hour of prep in order TO cook!) and 3) Tasty! This dish hit ALL 3 ... especially tasty 'button'. I gave up trying to cook anything Asian years ago! Seemed that no matter what the recipe called for, MINE would always end up getting a resounding "it's ok" (w/complimentary shoulder shrug)  or, worse, me sending someone somewhere to get us something to eat (and knowing I'd never be given the change back from the $20 bill I would fork over).

wonderful recipe.  The only reason for the 4 stars is that I added crushed garlic to the mixture while cooking and added approximately 1 cup water to increase the amount of sauce and give it better smooth texture
I will be making it again.
Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  I used the little yellow, red and orange peppers in place of the bell pepper and used some tomatoes that I had diced for salad.  I did not double the sauce, and wished that I had.  The recipe does not say to add the sauce to the dish, but I added it and served it over brown rice.  I'll definitely be making this again.

It was a great recipe and the steak came out amazing... I did make some adjustments though. I used pork instead of beef, skipped the tomatoes and added minced garlic. Also when cooking I added water to make a bit more sauce. Still it came out fantastic, and hubby came up for seconds... and thirds. 
It was my first time trying to cook something asian, so I think the recipe is great if it came out this good the first time around. Will definitely be making this again! Thank you for sharing.

This was great, I actually took suggestions from other reviews and used sesame seed oil to saute the beef. I didnt have hosin sauce, so I used oyster sauce instead. Not sure how that affected the taste, but we enjoyed it an I'm sure to try it again.

This was really, really good! I made it as recipe states except I made 1 1/2 x's the marinade & added 1 tsp red wine vinegar as another reviewer suggested. I also added mushrooms & topped with sesame seeds. I thought the tomato in it was sounded weird but tried it and loved it as did my son who doesn't like tomato. This made 3 good but not huge adult portions, not 4. I have another pound of steak and will try to marinade and freeze it for next time.

Very delicious.  I never realized the importance of cutting meat across the grain.

I added a photo....I added red pepper flakes for some spice and a tiny bit of jalapeno juice. Put it over white rice and had it with some sliced cucumber. Will definitely make again.

This was amazing :) I did not have all of the ingredients (mostly ginger) but I added just a dash of sesame oil and it was so good. I cant wait to go to the store and get ginger so I can try it this way too. Thank you so much for this wonderful and easy recipe!!

Just marinate the meat in 1/4 cup of oyster sauce, then you don't have to add sugar and cornstarch, all the stuff is already in oyster sauce and it has more flavor.

If I could give 3-1/2 stars I would.  For our taste, the addition of garlic was a must.  I made with only the ginger initially, but added the garlic after tasting.  Also used brown sugar, as it's always my sugar of choice with soy.  Doubled the sauce.  Added mushrooms.  It was good, but I still felt something missing, probably the oyster sauce.  Will make sure Togo back to fresh garlic and ginger next time.  A recipe worth tweaking.

This is a delicious dish - very tasty and full of flavour. The only reason I've given it 4 stars is 'coz with the given measurements, there just isn't enough sauce although it definitely was moist and wasn't in the least bit dry. What I did do was marinate the steak overnight (to the marinade, I added 1 small slit green chilli to give it some kick). Next time, I'll follow some of the other reviewers' suggestions and double the sauce, add in some crushed garlic, and skip the tomatoes (and perhaps add some crushed red chilli too). With these changes, this recipe's definitely worth 5 stars if not more!! Thanks Mrs. Wilson for sharing this recipe! :) P.S: I just read the suggestion of another reviewer who subbed mushrooms for tomatoes, that's a lovely idea that I'd love to try next time! :)

I doubled the sauce and used fresh mushrooms instead of tomatoes and it was delicious!  I also added oyster sauce and extra ginger as well as black pepper (about a teaspoon) as recommended by others and served it over fresh steamed jasmine rice.  Wow what a treat it was, better then I've ever had out

This recipe is easy enough, I just prefer my pepper steak to have a slightly sweeter sauce, so I added more sugar, it wasn't quite what I was looking for, but it did come closer to the recipe I was use to, but can no longer find.

Doubled the marinade - except for the sugar and cornstarch - and added garlic and red pepper flakes. Had about 1 1/2 lbs sirloin tips. Sliced one onion, one green pepper and one yellow pepper into strips. Used cherry tomatoes cut in half which I added at the very end. Followed the rest of recipe as written.  Excellent!!! Will make again.

I used flank steak and fresh ginger, not powdered.  I added a little fish sauce while sauteeing along with the soy sauce.  Delicious!  I will make it again.

This turned out great! It was fast and easy to put together. I didn't use ginger because I didn't have any, but I will keep some on had just for this recipe now! I would also skip the tomatoes next time, I just wasn't a fan. I also used a yellow and a red pepper instead of green, and they were fine. The meat was tender and flavoful, served with rice was a delicious, easy, quick meal!

It came out colorful and very tasty. Next time I'll skip the tomato's.  (Not my favorite.) The meat was unbelievably tender and very good. All in all a great recipe.

Family loved it. I needed to use what I had on hand so I used flank steak instead of sirloin. Flour instead of cornstarch, olive oil instead of veggie, green and red peppers but no tomatoes. I also added some red pepper flakes to spice it up. I'm sure the recipe is great as it is and it is great to use when you have to make substitutions. I will make it again. thanks

Followed the recipe as is and cooked this for lunch with rice. It was okay but it lacked zip. I think I would add something like balsamic vinegar next time. Thank you MrsWilson =)

Delicious recipe even after a minor alteration. I thought the sauce was too thick so I went ahead and added about 1/4 cup of red cooking wine to thin it out just a bit and the end result was a nice consistency. This is a savory dish and adds variety to my weekly dinner schedule. By the way, this dish has pretty colors, thus making it look appetizing.

I made some mods, but my mods didn't change the way it taste. Aminos for soy and powdered konjac root for cornstarch.
Yes, I will make it again. Next I will add toms right before serving to preserve the tomatos rich color. I doubled the recipe to freeze and serve at a later date. Thanks for the recipe!

Now I have to  say, I have not made this  recipe, but it is exactly the recipe ,my mom used when I was a kid. As one reviewer said, the recipe was on a box of cornstarch. I looked at the pictures, and only a handful looked like it is supposed to look. I will be making this tonight as written. I can taste it already! So sorry that people think they have to change a recipe before they try the original  ones. What an insult to the person who submits the recipe.

What you have here is actually a version of Peruvian lomo saltado. The addition of tomato, which never existed in China, is a dead giveaway. Lomo saltado is a Chinese/Japanese-inspired dish that was created by Asian immigrants to Peru, who used local ingredients as necessary, hence the addition of tomato. However, the tomato in lomo saltado is cooked down a lot more than in this recipe.

everyone loves.  i do not use tomato.  Fyi, the meat is more tender if you marinate for a couple of hours but you don't need to.  we throw it over rice but i like to steam veggies and throw over that and get carbs elsewhere.  no need to change the recipe bc it is great the way it is and that is EXACTLY what you want to hear when you read a review.  my kids get most excited when i make enough for school lunches the following day, but note when we pack lunch bowl, we mix the meat and sauce in the rice so the rice stays soft for next day lunch. enjoy!!!

This recipe is delicious! I make mine a lot of times in the crock pot.  The meat is so tender and tasteful!  Let it cook on low for 4 hours,  then add the bell pepper for another hour.  5 total hours.  ??

I made this with round steak as opposed to sirloin and substituted half of the oil with sesame oil. Added chopped green onions at the end and this could rival the local take-outs! Wonderful recipe.

Very tasty. Easy and quick to make. The cook can adjust the ratio of meat to veggies. With the addition of sugar and ginger, this isn't the type of pepper steak some people might expect. I cut the white sugar and cornstarch in half so it wasn't too sweet. The cornstarch coats the meat nicely and on high heat, adds a bit of char (not too much though).

I loved this!!!! I used some London broil that I got on sale, and was lucky enough to have all ingredients on hand, except the peppers and onions, which I just went to my local Dollar Tree down the street and got some frozen pepper stir fry packs. I did marinate the meat for about 2 hours, then cooked in batches, as recommended in another post, setting aside, then quickly sautéing the frozen veggies in the same oil as the meat, adding 3 cloves of minced garlic, and some red pepper flakes, then adding the meat and marinade, simmered for a few,then added the corn starch, (only because of the water in the frozen veggies) and it made a delicious thick sauce!  Cooked white rice in beef broth with some butter and served the meat and veggies on top! This is definitely a keeper!!!  I also used about a lb & a half of meat and 2 packs of veggies, I like a lot of veggies!

I was so hoping this would be great but not much flavor...I did not put but 1/2 teas sugar because we do not need that much sugar so maybe that was it.

I made this dish exactly as it was written the first time I made it, and it was 'pretty good'. For our taste, this recipe needed to be slightly 'tweaked'.  I made it again last night, and I only used 3/4 T sugar, half of a green bell pepper & half of a red bell pepper. We didn't care for the tomatoes, so I substituted sliced Baby Bella mushrooms (since we love 'shrooms). I served this over a bed of wild rice (cooked in low-sodium vegetable broth), & sugar snap peas for a side dish.  It was very tasty, and definitely 'company worthy'.

Very good. Adapted to put into a slow cooker by slicing all veggies the night before when I put the meat to marinate. Then just dumped the meat, marinade, and veggies into the crock, set it on low and came back after work to a wonderful meal. Beware, the peppers were soft, but that is normal when slow cooked.

This was OK, but it was kinda bland for my taste. Also it seems that the order of adding the sauce to the meat and then cooking it didn't work.  The sauce then stuck to the bottom of the pan and started to burn. Finally, I found the water balance off quite a bit. I added quite a bit of water to get it to make a sauce.

I was not happy with the directions. It tasted fine and I ended up making it the way I was raised by adding the marinating  to the skillet after everything was cooked

The recipe seemed great until it called for TWO tablespoons of corn starch for only 1/4 of a cup of liquid. The end result was so inedible, even after trying to doctor it up, that I threw away 10 dollars worth of steak. IF I make it again, next time I will use only  1 teaspoon of FLOUR.

Made this for dinner tonight-my daughter loved it.  I used flank steak I marinated overnight- have to remember not to add cornstarch when marinating.  Also doubled the sauce & used fresh garlic and  ginger.  Added s little beef broth.  Was yummy and easy!

I made this recipe as instructed. Ended up having to add about 2 cups of water because there was no sauce. I probably did something wrong to cause that problem. However, the flavor was good overall. That said, I don't think I will make this again. But ONLY because  am the only one in my household who enjoys Chinese cuisine.

It was very yummy- even better with fresh ginger root, if you have it (I keep mine in the freezer for convenience, and running it over a microplane while still frozen).  I did end up adding additional liquid as it seemed to be lacking any real sauce.  I like a little bit of sauce to soak into a bed of rice.  Good with venison, too!

Came out so delicious. But I just cooked all of my beef at once, and added more water and soy sauce to make more of a gravy. Tasted like take out. Will definitely make again.

I made the recipe as directed. In future, I would use a generous amount of minced or grated fresh ginger instead of the powdered ginger. In my opinion, the yellow onion would add a better flavor than red. One tomato was plenty.  The taste of the dish was very bland.

This was good.  I added ginger and garlic paste (2 heaped tablespoons) to the sauce, and a bit of water just before serving to make a little sauce / moisture.  Next time I would reduce the sugar a little, but this is an easy, tasty, quick dish that stretches a small steak quite well.  Thanks!

Yes I made it . Against my better mind I put the tomatoes in . It would have been much better if I would have left them out. Ruined the authenticity of the dish. My Chinese friend said " nooo tomatoes in pepper steak ". I agree.

The beef can benefit from a bit of acid coupled with a slightly longer marinade.

This is my fourth time cooking this recipe, and it is a hit!  Today, I had some sun dried tomatoes which I have had in the refrigerator for quite some time.  I threw theses in along with some fresh garlic at the end nd will definitely do both henceforth!  Great recipe!

We loved this recipe! I skipped the tomatoes and had to use flour because I did not have cornstarch. It was perfect..and so easy. I love a recipe that I can prepare ahead and put together a few minutes before dinner..

4 stars because I did not follow exactly. Added 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce and glove of chopped garlic. However I did follow cooking directions exactly and I think this is why is came out so well.  Unless you have a REALLY large fry pan, stir fry MUST be cooked in batches.

Really liked this recipe,  tweaked it a bit added 1 tbsp minced garlic and 1 tsp crushed red pepper, had to triple for 3 lbs of meat. Perfect balance of sweet and hot, only thing I will change next time is less cornstarch with water for a thinner consitancy,  very thick sticky coating, but thats just a personal preference.

I used a little extra sauce and only half an onion and one tomato, and it came out good.  I think I would cut back a little on the sugar next time.  My family liked this dish!

Instead of white sugar I used brown sugar and instead of a red onion I  used a white one. I also marinated the meat for about 2 hours and added a small spoon of red wine vinegar to the marinade to help break down the meat some to ensure tenderness. I added season salt, minced garlic, teriyaki sauce, and sesame oil to the marinade as well. This was yummy. A definite keeper.

Yum!!  A keeper!  I will make this one again. 
I used low sodium soy sauce and fresh roma tomatoes, I left out the onions as I fogot to buy some.  The green peppers gave this dish a WONDERFUL flavor.  Next time I may try fresh ginger instead of the dry and add a pinch more sugar to the marinade.

Awesome recipe, the sauce is delicious. I used frozen onion and pepper mix because that was all I had. I didn't have any ginger, so I omitted it, but it was still very good. Added some garlic also. I think I will also try the sauce on this recipe using chicken and broccoli instead of the steak and peppers. Pretty sure that will be a good combo too.

I tried this recipe last week and my family loved it. I wanted something different than just steak, starch, and vegetable. I thought about the pepper steak from the Chinese restaurants and wanted to make my own. It turned out great. The recipe was easy to follow and the ingredient mixture was great.

Good but a little too salty. I added a few garlic cloves and marinated the meat for about an hour prior to cooking   I also doubled the marinade since I like more sauce for the rice.  After everything was done cooking, the sauce was too thick so I added about 1/2 cup water to the mixture for a smoother consistency. Family loved it.

I've been thinking about eating/making pepper steak for days but was waiting to pull the trigger because I wanted it to taste just like take out but couldn't find a recipe that I was ready to take a chance on.  When I found this one I decided to give it a shot.  So glad I did, it was AMAZING!  The only thing I did different was double the sauce, tenderize the steak really well before I marinated it and added a lot of fresh ground black pepper.  I let it marinate for about 3 hours.

I like onions to be cooked really well, so unless you like them on the crisper side I suggest you cook them a little before adding the steak and the peppers in.

Will be make this again for sure!

I just made this for supper with rice. It was okay but it lacked zip.   I ate it the way it was but I think I would add something like balsamic vinegar next time.  I did not use the tomatoes but I did add sliced portobello mushrooms.

Delish!!! My 18 month old even loves it. The only change I made was substituting fresh mushrooms for the tomato.

This was very tasty!  I doubled the marenade and let the beef sit in it for about two hours. I cooked the beef/peppers/onions at the same time for about 4 minutes. Poured marenade in until it thickened. While I was cooking I added a half teaspoon chopped garlic and 1 cup beef broth for more gravy to the double batch of marenade.    Family loved it...will make again :)

The flavor was excellent. My meat came out a little chewy but I think I over cooked it a few mins too long so do be careful to follow the cooking time. I am still looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow even knowing it will be a little work to chew it :)

After having some terrible pepper steak from a new local chinese restaurant, I set out to find a good recipe to cure my craving for it. This was definitely it!! To personalize it a bit, I doubled the sauce (we like extra) and I cut back a bit on the ginger. That's the great thing abt this website. All the tips & reviews help you tailor a recipe to your family's preference and ensure success. Thank you for sharing this recipe.....well worth a try!

Delicious!  My husband gobbled it up.  I didn't have any tomatoes but I had red, green, and yellow peppers, so I used all those instead.  Otherwise made exactly as it was written.  So good!

The only thing I did different was to let the meat soak in the marinade for a couple of hours. This is definitely a keeper.

I made a healthier version with coconut aminos instead of soy sauce, pyure organic stevia & Erythritol instead of sugar (half the sugar required by pyure), olive oil instead of vegtable oil
and green onions instead of red onions. Was very good and would make it again.

I used stew meat we had on hand and cut it in bite size pieces and marinaded it for about two hours. For the marinade, I used low sodium soy sauce and only one teaspoon of sugar as my husband is diabetic. For the veggies, I used a green and a red bell pepper, the red onion and mushrooms.  I browned the meat in the wok, added the onion to the meat with a little more soy sauce, cooked covered for a few minutes, then added the bells and mushroom and cooked a few minutes longer. Served over brown jasmine rice. It was very good. I will definitely use the marinade recipe again. The marinade gives the flavor and for the stir fry, I think one can add any veggies one likes.

This was delightfully easy and flavorful: the way the sauce caramelized on the steak gave it plenty of zing with the rice without needing any actual liquid, but the slight stir-fry oil of the green peppers and onions and the light tang of the tomatoes formed a fantastically simple flavor profile.

Made it exactly but added yellow bell pepper too.  Doubled meat.  Butcher said to use Angus sirloin steak.  He was right.  So tender and yummy.  Will be one of my go to recipes.

I always use Worcestershire Sauce instead of Soy Sauce (because it contains way too much salt).

Changes were only to amounts and no tomatoes; substituted Celery slices.  Interesting, and will make again.   Good thing is the versatility the base of this recipe seems to have.

Made this recipe just as directed, except for the tomatoes. Family love this dish... labeled it a "keeper".

Be careful when stir frying the steak in  the oil; there was a lot of splatter when we were doing it.

Very tasty, but I used strip sirloins cut to one inch pieces. It needs a sauce according to my family. It's a great fit for Keto diets as well.

I came home late from work at 9pm.....tired but hungry. I made this, added lots of garlic, but otherwise left it written. 

It was fast and very easy and I would make it again.  I might add chopped celery, more soy sauce. I served it over rice.

I confess I have not made this version yet, but I’ve had the recipe for years. The onion and tomatoes will be welcome additions. My recipe is for a crockpot and uses round steak, in case you’re on a tight food budget and like to have dinner all ready when you get home from work.

It was good but I wasn't amazed. It probably because the steak didn't taste good. I followed the recipe as is.

Loved this recipe. However next time I will take out the tomatoes as we found they didn’t fit with the other flavours. This will definitely be on our regular menu rotation.

I have made this many times,  I work cooking for several guys,  This is one of their favorite dishes.  I rated a four star due to the fact that I did change it up a bit.  I used flank steak cut into serving sizes.  I Browned the meat then put everything in a baking pan and baked it 350 for 2 hours.. Meat comes out tender and flavorful.  However I did add hoisen sauce and tiger sauce for a bit of a kick. Definitely make extra sauce.

Thanks Kim for this delicious recipe, my son couldn’t stop eating it he liked it so much!  I did follow your recipe with just a couple minor adjustments. I had multi colored small peppers and a green one so I used all colors and instead of whole tomatoes, which aren’t in season here, I had a large can of diced tomatoes that I drained and used instead.  I added these items in when your recipe called for it and I’m happy with the way it turned out but all credit goes to you for the ingredients and especially the marinade, that was key to this delicious meal.

Yes, found not enough gravy with it so I added half a can of golden mushroom soup. Delicious. I also threw in left over marinade. If you have a suggestion for more grave I am all ears!  Thanks.

I used presliced steak and a precut container of peppers and onions (don’t judge me...I work a lot lol) from Walmart. Also added mushrooms since it’s my babes favorite veggie. Doubled the sauce as well. I never knew to cook the meat in batches but upon doing so noticed it’s the way to go. It doesn’t boil that way. I did have to stop and wash my skillet tho after all that due to the excess sauce sticking to the pan. If I hadn’t it would have had a burnt taste. Decided to use a reviewers recipe for home made sweet and sour sauce for on the side. This was so incredible. After I cooked the meat my kido was coming stealing bites. The sweet and sour sauce I gotta say is top notch if you like it. Best I’ve ever made, cheaper than the bottled stuff, and way better. I will make this again. So versatile and so yummy.

Husband enjoyed it immensely! Asked to have it again soon. 
I doubled the recipe, as I thought it may not be enough for dinner and lunch leftovers. I was SO wrong.... this recipe makes plenty using the original amounts. 
I'm glad we all liked it so much, because we had lots of leftovers.

No changes, pretty good, everyone ate their plate full! Not a WOW! but will make again, very good for those who know little about cooking, like myself! 
Update! I've made it a few more times, and it just keeps getting better! Adding mushrooms to it makes it even better

Great recipe. I used London broil because it was on sale and it worked beautifully. I'm also allergic to soy, so I had to use mock soy sauce. For those can't use real soy sauce, I would suggest not adding sugar. It came out a bit too sweet but I wanted to try the recipe first. Will definitely make this again!

Wow! This was so easy to make. Dinner was on the table from start to finish in around 30 minutes. I used 2 bell peppers and 3 tomatoes (my tomatoes were small). I made jasmine rice to go along with it. I didn’t think there would be enough sauce to accompany the rice but, it was perfect. My husband thought it was delicious as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I had extra banana peppers so I used a mix of those and bell peppers from the garden, added fresh Thai basil from my Aerogarden as a finish because I had plenty and I like the flavors it added.   Will make again (soon) because peppers are piling up.

Follow the recipe but it was not as authentic tasting as I would have like to be, in fact it tasted pretty bland to me.  It was ok for those who are not into hot and spicy types of food.  I won't keep this one, I will go back to the traditional recipe I got from my mother in law.

This is a very tasty dish! I often cook it for my family. Not only that it’s yummy but it’s quick and always have the ingredients in my pantry. My daughter doesn’t like vegetables but she eats the pepper and tomatoes from this dish. If you feel like Chinese food but healthier for you , give this dish a try!

This is a good basic recipe - but I prefer fresh ginger and garlic to give it more zing.  I added 1 TBL fresh ginger and 1 TBL of chopped garlic to the beef marinade.  If  your marinade is runny, I drained it and added it back at the end.  I also didn't return the beef to the wok when I sautéed the veggies.  I thought it would over cook it. (it would have).  We used a NY strip and just got it browned and removed it from the wok.  Once the veggies were browned and sautéed, we added the beef back.  We added mushrooms.  I think the tomatoes are wrong, and wouldn't use them again.  Also, next time I want to slice the veggies in thin slices rather than 1 inch squares.  I just like the look of long thin pieces and I think they will cook faster and brown better.

I made this with London Broil. It was 2 lbs, so the marinade was doubled, and this was left in a gallon zipper bag for two hours in the fridge. It was browned in several small batches for two minutes each in peanut oil and left to rest. Doubled remainder of the recipe, and Salt was added to the veg once the peppers went in. Remaining marinade was poured in during addition of tomatoes. THEN I ADDED THE BEEF BACK DURING THE LAST 3 MINUTES.  Serving with light soy sauce makes the flavors pop.

Really enjoyed this recipe...marinated the steak in the sauce for the time it took me to slice onions, peppers, fresh mushrooms and shallots....added the onions to the marinade with the beef and stirred it around to coat it all the put in a frying pan and fried it all together...adding the rest of the vegetables once the beef and onions had cooked.  Wanted more sauce since we were going to have rice with it so I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to it .  Very happy with the taste and results and hubby loved it!!

Snowy day, wanted something different, and based on what on hand I found this recipe. Awesome!!! I cut up the beef and put it in the marinade this morning. I didn't have any tomatoes, but I'm not a huge fan anyway. I did add mushrooms and a little bit of sherry. I think this was actually better than what I get from my usual take out place!

I love how versatile this recipe is. It was delicious. I substituted yellow onion for red, a yellow and orange for the green,  used only one Tablespoon of sugar and left out the tomatoes. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I can't wait to try it again.

This is a keeper for sure! I doubled the marinade since I like extra sauce on my rice. Side note, if doubling sauce don’t double cornstarch. I ended up having to thin it out in the end...still yummy tho!!

Pretty good. I doubled the peppers in lieu of tomatoes as this really is not a tomato dish. I need to learn to "get wild" and cut my onion pieces larger in Chinese dishes. 

I might add a tiny bit more sugar next time, and also cook the beef slightly less, as they were a bit chewy. Pretty quick and easy dish to make though. Will try again with the above changes next time.

Very good recipe    I marinated and chopped the vegetable,  ,cooked the rice at home and made this on a camping trip. The meat marinated all day and I added a clove of garlic and omitted the sugar as I was out in the RV!  Will definitely make again as it was simple,  easy. and tasty! Thanks for the recipe

I tossed my beef in the marinade, then poured the beef and marinade together into the hot pan. I didn’t get the timing of the onions and peppers quite right so the steak ended up a little over cooked. Next time I’ll cut my steak slightly thinner and just add everything at once. I added a few slices of a jalapeño for spice. Very easy recipe, no weird ingredients I’ll never use again, and tastes delicious!

I added some hot pepper sauce and minced garlic to the marinated steak because of our love for spices.  Great recipe, no changes needed.  You must use the tomatoes, that's the way it's supposed to be made!

Very delicious and full of flavourful. However, I had to substitute flour for the cornstarch (didn't have any on hand) and I added carrots and broccoli. I also forgot to add the tomatoes, but it was a great dish.

Delicious recipe! Only changes I made was that I simmered mine a bit longer in order for the meat to be a little bit more tender and I added white rice to mine (personal preference)!

I made the recipe and it was okay. It tasted fine, but I was looking for more of a spicy pepper stake.

Doesn't taste authentic. Will not make again. Doesnt have any sauce to spread over rice. Searching for another recipe for a more authentic taste.

Left out the tomatoes, doubled the veggies and sauce, and used 1.5lbs of steak. I also added water chestnuts. My 14month old, my husband and I thought it was great!

I recommend leaving the sugar out or at least reducing it.  This is a really good basic pepper steak recipe.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I drained a can of Diced tomatoes.  I will make it again.

My boyfriend asked for this upon request. I found the recipe online and decided to go for this recipe because it has a really high rating and a lot of people rated it.  It came out really good and my boyfriend loved it.  My one big question is when do we add the vinegar? It’s in the ingredients list but I don’t see it anywhere in the recipe.

I didn’t have any Ginger, so I used Chinese 5 spice. This was so easy, and even my picky eaters loved, and said we need to have this again! Just a little rice leftover, yummy!

This is a really easy recipe and it’s delicious! I didn’t add tomatoes this time but I definitely will next.


Made again tonight but I used chicken. Added tomatoes this time but I used grape tomatoes because I like how they pop in your mouth  and a lil extra heat with red pepper flakes. Delicious.

Thank you so much for this great recipe. It was delicious!.  I did edit  it a lil but did as you said and it was great. My husband don't like peppers so I did not  add them. Only thing I did diffrent was to season my meat with a lil adobo  Goya and paprika before marinating the meat for 20 mins.  Other  than that  I Follow  the rerecipe and  from now on 
I  am cooking my own pepper steaks always. Sorry chinese reataurants.

Definitely needs to be marinaded overnight for optimal flavor. I also prefer twice the sugar, add one tablespoon of minced garlic, and a tablespoon of sesame oil.

My mother made a nearly identical recipe in the 60's but used Canada Dry gingerale so there is no need for the sugar and ginger ingredients. Tthe taste is very similar, both are delicious.

Thank you for this easy recipe.  The only change was a bit less sugar since it was for one person.  My husband has some trouble swallowing and is a meat lover.  This was perfect and he loved the taste.  I may also try with chicken sliced the same way then both of us can enjoy it.  I too did not add the tomatoes but that's minor.  The flavors were spot on.
Thank you for a great addition.

All I can say is...mouth watering tender soft steak with a delectably delicious sweet marinade.  I want more already!  I marinated the steak for 4 hours with some fresh cracked black pepper and a pinch of  pink salt.  Followed the directions for cooking practically to a tee and it worked for me - I just wish that you could see the picture that I took for thee.

Used flank steak instead of sirloin; omitted the tomato; cooked it in a wok, used low sodium soy sauce. This was delicious! Not many ingredients, not fancy, but  an excellent recipe. I suggest putting 1 T oil in the marinade instead of adding it  to the hot pan by itself.

The meat was super tough. If you weren’t eating tough meat or rice it seemed like you were just eating a ton of onions. I followed the recipe exactly and will admit that I hate cooking. I would not make it again.

This recipe is so easy to prepare and fast the entire meal start to finish was less than an hour. And the flavor is delicious. I followed the recipe with just one exception. I added garlic to the meat and veggies. It has been close to three hours since dinner and cleaning the kitchen and the house is still smelling Devine. This is a keeper!!!!

Made this tonight and we both loved it! I added brown sugar to the sauce to sweeten a bit, but then made it as directed in the recipe.  Serves 2-3; we would have been hard pressed to serve four people!  It is a keeper recipe.

Used this recipe as the foundation and added my own little tweaks... Absolutely mouthwatering, delicious, I'm-getting-seconds worthy. And instead of buying the individual vegetables I bought the stir fry vegetables from Trader Joe's out of simplicity. Definitely will be making this again and my husband loves it which is what matters most to me! See my pic in the photos section :)

I'd say this recipe is a keeper, with a few minor tweaks for personal preference. Next time I will try adding fresh garlic and more ginger ( I did use fresh ginger), and may cut back on the sugar.

We all really enjoyed this dish. The only changes I made were adding 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the marinating meat along with fresh chopped ginger rather than ground. I used red, green and yellow peppers and I added water chestnuts and snow peas. I didn’t see how long to let meat marinate but I let it set for about five hours. Served with rice and it was delicious!

This was an "okay" recipe.  Easy to make, but didn't impress me.  Other raters omitted the tomato ... I downsized this ingredient to halved cherry tomatoes.  This recipe can impress without the tomatoes, I think.  The key to this recipe is it's ease in making.

I followed the receipe to a "tee", except sprinkled a little combination spice called ginger/garlic before frying meat.  It was all absolutely delicious.  Surprisingly the meat did not turn out tuff...I will make this again!

My picky g-daughter said it was the "BomB. My partner said it was better than any restaurant. (I admit, he is not hard to please)
I cooked all the beef first, set aside. Then cooked the peppers (all colors) & onion. Then added the beef, stir, simmer a moment.
Served on white rice.
Next up: tonight, trying chicken & Chinese noodles.

I added 3 cloves of garlic and some scallions to the veggie mix; also substituted Chinese 5 spice mix ( ginger, clove, cinnamon, star anise, and anise seed) for one tablespoon of sugar.
My husband loved it. He’s the cook in the family, so this is a compliment. He went back for seconds....
Easy to make. Great for leftovers, too.

We enjoyed it.  Didn't add tomatoes but did include snap peas and broccoli. I cooked the meat separate from the veggies because of they required different cooking times.  When the veggies were done, then I added the meat and this way it wasn't overcooked.

For this review, I made this exactly as written . Something was missing in this recipe.  After the 2 batches of meat were done, the cornstarch formed a thin coating at the bottom of the skillet.  Everything was dry until the tomatoes had a chance to cook down a bit and even then, there was no moisture to speak of. Combined with the soy sauce, I found the aroma rather unpleasantly salty. The taste was so so,  the dish if made as written did not work for me.

This was really good! My whole family loved it. We like A LOT of sauce, so I doubled the sauce part of the recipe. I was glad I did as, doubled, it made just enough to cover the ingredients and have a little bit on the rice when mixed. Next time I will triple the sauce.  I also cut back on the sugar and added a little rice vinegar because we like a little tang, but that's just a personal preference. Will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe! The only thing i change is i dont add the cornstarch to the mix until after the meat is coated with the soy sauce, ginger and sugar. Then i add the cornstarch to the meat. I cook the meat then remove it but dont return the meat back into the pot until all the veggies are done. Doing it this way wont overcook the meat. I also add a tablespoon or two of water make a little extra gravy since it will thicken quickly on high heat because of the cornstarch. Its amazing every time i make it

Followed the recipe except I didn't use tomatoes and I used a white onion.  I doubled the recipe (large family) but will triple it next time because I want leftovers of this!  Served it over Chinese fried rice.  Very tasty and enjoyed by everyone in my family.   Will be making this again definitely!

It was good. Quick and easy to make. Great recipe to use up the veggies I had. I doubled the sauce, I didn't marinate, added a lil salt and pepper and added sesame seeds at the end. I will use no sugar next time.

This reminds me of the Pepper Steak I made for my children when young.  First time I had this was at a Richmond VA Chinese restaurant famous for this very dish.  I made it exactly as you suggest, except I omitted tomatoes.  Thank you for bringing this back into my favorite foods!

Was looking to make Pepper Steak as I remembered it, with a bit of soy based sauce to put onto the rice with the onion, green pepper, beef mixture. I'm thinking this isn't what I was looking for. Began cooking and my first question was "Why the sugar?" so I only put in half and it was still too sweet for my taste.  The marinade is just that - only for marinade - so there's no sauce. That leads me to my second question "Why the cornstarch?" if there's no sauce. The cornstarch in the marinade clung to the beef forming little cornstarch balls when the beef was cooked. I added a bit of water to dissolve the starch balls and that at least gave me a touch of sauce. I cooked in my wok the times indicated and the peppers were still too hard and had to be cooked longer. This recipe isn't what I remembered and it was too sweet for my personal taste and was lacking in sauce. I'll continue to search for the recipe to make Pepper Steak as I remember it.

Made as written.  This is a wonderful pantry meal as the ingredients are easy to have on hand & are not speciality items.  The only down side is that it doesn't have a lot of brown sauce and would be better with fried rice since there isn't a sauce for the white rice.

It was a big hit. My wife complained that I used too much steak but at the end of the day it was all gone. Next time I'll take pictures.

I loved it! It's been the best Chinese Pepper  steak recipe I've tried. I doubled the sauce since my hubby likes it with gravy it wasn't as liquid as I wanted but still great! I think it didn't liquify because I used a wok. Next time I'll cook the sauce in a non stick pan. Thank you!!

This was absolutely delicious.  I whisked up the marinade after my morning coffee and I let the steak tips marinade for a few hours on a Saturday while I did yard work.  Note:  I subbed the sugar for Truvia Baking Blend.  I chopped up the veggies ahead of time and put them in the refrigerator, so when it was time for dinner, it took less than ten minutes to cook everything .  The tomatoes were an interesting twist, but once I tried it, I realize their natural sugar added to the dish.  I I might sub tomatoes or add red bell peppers and jalapenos next time :)  

Not only is this delicious, this is a great high protein meal that has you feeling satisfied after even a modest portion.  I will be making this at least twice a month.  I love it.

It turned out great. I grated in frozen ginger and used red pepper instead of green and it was very good. I will be making it again.

Fantastic! Just as good as my favorite Chinese restaurant.

I used top sirloin and minced ginger instead of ground ginger. I also omittdd the tomatoes as a personal preference. I did think it was a tad too sweet, so next time I will only use teaspoons of sugar instead of tablespoons, but that's just another personal preference. The meal is delicious as is. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was excellent- a huge thank you to the reviewers who suggested adding garlic and cutting the sugar. I did use a variety of my frozen garden peppers; I  wasn't sure how they would hold up in a stir fry but was really pleased with the result. I did t use the tomatoes because I have never encountered tomatoes in Chinese food. I also used fresh grated ginger.

I made this tonight and it was a hit.... I omitted the tomatoes as my son doesn't like them. As mentioned by other reviewers I did add garlic, oyster sauce and rice wine vinegar. I also used brown sugar instead of white. This recipe will definitely be in regular rotation.

My husband and I really liked this dish. Made it as directed. I will definitely make it again, however, next time I think I will do a quick sautée on the veggies first, and set aside. Then cook the beef and add the veggies back. I felt like I was over-cooking the meat while waiting for the veggies to cook/warm up. Tasty!

I thought it was delicious. I always add a bit of my own seasonings for that specified taste but other than that I wouldn't do anything different. One thing I did do different was simply place the stove on low so the green peppers and onions can REALLY get soft!

This was easy and very ta,ty. I added carrots sliced on the bias, just because I like lots of veggies. I added some minced fresh garlic and used cherry tomatoes instead of sliced, since that was what I had. Added then the last couple of minutes, whole, and they were wonderful. Next time I will make more marinade to pour over the rice. The beef was tender and flavorful.

I did this tonight, the wife loved it and told me to give it 5 stars, so this is for her :) . Will definitely be a repeat dish. The steak, tomatoes and peppers all come out fresh, tender and tasty. This will definitely lessen trips to the Chinese restaurant.

Very good, i may like it more than the croc pot recipe. One thing ....The veggies require a lot more time than a few minutes to soften more like 10min, which effects  the sauce it disappears. So next time I will Sautee veggies first.

Taste was good. I made it in a fry pan rather than a wok. Beef was rather tough. I cooked it much longer than the recipe called for and added water periodically to tenderize.

I made this and it tasted great! It tastes very similar to the take out version. I left out the tomatoes in my version since I like the steak, onions and bell peppers only, I served it over brown rice.

Was really good. I made double the sauce because I have a family of 5 so I doubled all ingredients. I also added red bell peppers and no tomatoes, with rice on the side. My only downfall was I should of added more veggies. We love eat.. great meal.

I cooked it how it was supposed to by cooked and enjoyed the flavor of it more or less. I'd say it was good but not great. I'm going to make another batch again soon and see if I can spice things up a little. It just needs more potency IMO

I cooked the meat in sesame oil instead of olive oil, and I added beef broth to make more sauce.  I used red peppers instead of green, and skipped the tomatoes. My family loved it!

This was great. But I suggest leaving out the tomatoes. They don't belong in pepper steak. I also used yellow onions. I think they go best with the other ingredients for this dish.

Good base recipe. I followed the instructions and I thought it could've used more sauce and a bit more flavor. But it was still good, especially with the texture the corn starch adds. I served it with white rice and soy sauce. I'll add more veggies next time and will double the sauce (set aside half the sauce to mix in after

This was a quick and easy recipe to make, but as always, I improvised, adapting it for what I had on hand. I omitted the tomatoes but added a handful of  baby carrots thinly sliced on a diagonal along with the onions. A few sweet, diced mini-peppers  took the place of the green pepper.  I wanted a little more sauce to serve with this dish, so a little "dipping sauce" from a bag of potstickers, combined with a bit more water and sugar was added at the end until heated through. 
Next time I'll make a little extra marinade and reserve some of it to add after cooking the meat and veggies.

This was fantastic,  the first dish I cooked in my new wok (thanks babe!). Added a little garlic to the marinade and doubled it like some others suggested. Also added some green onions that I needed to use up. Very forgiving recipe, thank you!

I pretty much followed the directions with these exceptions:
Used 1/2 of the sugar, eliminated the tomato, added 1/2 clove garlic. And because I used more meat, I doubled the marinade.

Better then take out!!! I marinated  the beef overnight so it could really soak up the flavor but truthfully cause I had to run an errand last minute. I also added a little sesame oil when frying  the veggies and steak. I also added mushrooms cause we love them. This is so quick and easy there's no need to buy takeout again. This is a keeper

Made it as written except I let the beef marinade for 24 hours.  Was concerned it would be too salty but it was excellent.  Meat extremely tender, flavorful, etc.  (Used the low sodium soy sauce).  Definitely would recommend.

Delicious!  Better than any restaurant version.  Followed the recipe exactly, except marinated the steak for about 4 hours first.

They had pre-sliced beef at the grocery store -- it was sliced very thin -- much thinner than I could have done myself -- and it was delicious in this recipe. I cut the sugar by about 1/4 and added some lime juice.  I had to cook the onion and pepper much longer than stated to get them to our liking. Used some red, green and yellow pepper. Did not add tomato. Then added beef back in for just a minute.

After meat was done, tossed it in sauce without cornstarch in it. Gave it sauce to toss vegetables in and to pour over rice when serving. Had to cook vegetables a little longer than suggested. I added yellow onions and preferred them to the red onion. Great recipe though. I've tried a few for pepper steak and this is the best.

Delicicious husband and kid loved it. He said it made his tastebuds jumped. I saved the sauce from the meat as I marinated it right before I cooked it. Then I tossed the sauce in the pan so that my white rice would have a little gravy. Yum

Always a tad wary of cornstarch because if not prepared properly can cause meat to become slimy, but no worries here. Excellent recipe! Easily changed ingredient amounts to make a larger batch. Wife and our girls ate every bite. No leftovers, bummer! We will likely make this a staple.

I used low sodium soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce and I increased the green bell peppers to two instead of just one. My husband is crazy for green peppers. Chinese Pepper Steak is one of his favorite dishes and he definitely gave this his seal of approval! Very easy and quick! I will use this recipe again.

I changed the recipe a little by adding fresh ginger, garlic, chives, maple syrup and lemon juice to the marinade. I used cooked pork, that I just laid on top of the cooking vegetables so it got steamed, and it came out more tender than ever! I found this recipe to be really yummy.

I doubled the recipe for the sauce, and I was of tomatoes,  so I added a TBSP of ketchup instead.  This is one of my new favorite recipes to make, and I have it every few weeks.

This is a perfect recipe: fast, easy, and tasty. I live in the Middle East where the beef just doesn't taste that great. It's too lean and too chewy, although it's probably pretty healthy. Since I like beef, I am always looking for ways to make the beef here more edible. This recipe really does the trick. My wife and I just ate a whole recipe (without rice) for dinner tonight.  This recipe is a keeper for us. (I did add 1.5 tsp red pepper flakes when I made it tonight...not necessary, I just love pepper.)

I made this recipe recently for mother's day and it was so delicious!!! Everyone couldn't stop telling me how good it was. I substituted the tomatoes for chopped garlic and doubled the amount used for the sauce to give the meat extra flavor. I also cooked the steak first than added everything else afterwards. I topped this recipe over white rice. Definitely will make this again!

This was excellent! I made the following changes: I didn't marinate it, I cooked the onions and peppers separate then put to the side then cooked the meat with chopped garlic put that to the side, made the sauce and added back the meat and veggies. I also used ginger paste. Hubby and kids loved this will definitely be a regular in my house.

I don't understand the negative reviews. This tastes exactly like the Chinese restaurant around the corner from my house. Very very good. I substituted Splenda for real sugar because of my diet. I added it up and, if this feeds 4, it's about 8 carbohydrates per serving. And low cal and lo sodium so you've got a winner diet dish with flavor.

Just like another reviewer said, it was  "just ok."   That was despite adding fresh garlic and fresh ginger.  I also marinated for 24 hours, and it was still just ok!!  Won't make again....

Delicious! I used a rib eye steak, and used coconut oil to stir fry. Honey wants me to make healthier choices in food prep, and asked me to try coconut oil. I don't know if that made a huge difference, but I can tell you it's AWESOME. Try it!

pretty simple to make and extremely delicious, the marinade gives an interesting taste to the meat and I personally recommend making it WITH the marinade. The mix of ingredients add a very unique feel to the dish, crunchiness of green peppers, juiciness of tomatoes, all of it adds a very nice and fine detail to the meal. Very tasty

Great recipe! Was looking for Chinese style food for the evening. Ran across this recipe. Decided to use what I had meat wise. I used venison steak and added some sesame seed oil and topped off with sesame seeds. Good stuff!

I made this 2 days in a row! It's super easy and delicious. I forgot the ginger the first day but my family pretty much ate it from the skillet anyway. The next day I used squeezable ginger and 2 teaspoons of chopped garlic - perfection! I have never had tomatoes in pepper steak so I left them out. This dish is definitely in the dinner rotation from now on.

Just made it but I used more steak and soy sauce. The "gravy" wasn't as as much present as I would like do I added a little water and more corn starch. Came out awesome! I forgot the tomatoes in the fridge!!! I'll have to make some more soon

I actually made this a few times just to see if the family really did enjoy it and not because mom made a "new dish" for dinner. Family loved it each time it was made and has been requested to add to the dinner rotation. I did omit the tomatoes and added red pepper flakes for a little heat. Loved it.

I love making this with boneless pork chops.  A lady next door gave me the recipe years ago and one day I tried it with pork and never looked back  :)  I also serve it over steamed rice.

I used honey instead of sugar and put salt & pepper on the peppers and onions before I put them in the pan. I did not include the tomato because I don't care for cooked tomato. I compensated by using more peppers. In the future I would add garlic and marinate the beef longer.

I can't really rate the true recipe because, like many others, I omitted the tomatoes. I didn't think the acidic, mushy, cooked tomatoes would help the dish.
I also forgot to marinate until an hour before cooking, but it still turned out great. I like garlic, a lot, so I added a minced garlic. Also at the end, I deglazed the wok with a little rice vinegar and water then added that to the pepper steak. Very tasty and didn't change the flavor, just added more sauce which I love.

This is a great recipe - I don't know why it says to brown the beef 1/3 at a time but i just throw it all in the wok at once. then we use it to fill burritos. It's delicious!

really nice. I made it with the tomatoes and I think it added something. 
Had lots of the marinade left so I added it at the end of the cooking.

This was delicious. The only changes I made were that I used a frozen bag of mixed peppers and onion, and added nutmeg instead of ginger spice.  Stir fried steak first, then threw in sauce mixture and turned to coat. Then added the previously defrosted peppers and onions, stir frying until hot. So quick and easy. Served with brown rice. Everyone loved it!

I reduced sugar by half (thanks to a previous experience of it being too sweet for my taste) and added a cup and a half of water.  I didn't have cornstarch on hand so I used 3 T of flour as a substitute.  Also added some Montreal Steak seasoning for a little more kick.

Made almost no changes - was a bit short on soy so added 2 tbsp of worcestshire to make up for it. I thought it was a teeny bit bland but my kids thought it was FABULOUS over rice and it was super duper quick and easy, so I can't complain AT ALL.

My family loved the flavor of this dish!  I made according to the recipe except the tomatoes because my family does not care for them.  The only complaint:  Not enough sauce.  Next time I will add the marinade in with the onions.

I have been searching for a Pepper Steak recipe for years. I tried this  and it was great. First I used fresh ginger and  added garlic. Sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I marinated it overnight. I did not add the tomatoes. Followed the cooking directions and wow it was just like the restaurant take out.  I cannot thank you enough for this treasure of a recipe.

It is easy to make but pretty bland. I marinated the meat for 24 hours and included 2 cloves of garlic in the marinade to give it a better chance to be savory, and cut the sugar and tomato in half, as these were common alterations from prior reviewers.  Otherwise followed the original recipe. If I make it again will spice it up more and cook garlic in with the onion rather than restrict it to the marinade.

Very easy. I let the meat marinate overnight and used sirloin steak. I added a small amount of clove garlic and left out the tomatoes(did not have any). I added a little beef consume to the mixture. My husband and I both loved this very easy and tasty meal.

This  is a very good basic recipe.  With modifications, it's outstanding.  I added some red pepper flakes,  garlic, and left out the tomatoes.  I also substituted yellow onion for the red onion and some brown sugar for the white sugar.  After tasting it, I added some unsalted peanuts to simulate Kung Pao Beef.  My spouse and I loved it, as did my extremely picky mother and sister.

My whole family loved this ....there was not even a pepper leftover. Simple ingredients.  Easy to make - I used pre-sliced beef angus to save time.  I doubled the recipe.  Next time I make this I will not double the cornstarch to have a little gravy.

This is a family favorite!  5 stars exactly as written!  I do have some simplifications that I use, and it is still 5 star even when I am not able to prepare it as written. 1) this turns out just fine if I cook all the meat at once instead of in 3 batches. 2) I don't commonly have red onion on hand, but this is still perfectly tasty with yellow cooking onions. 3)although the tomato really puts this over the top, I often don't have any, and would still rate this 5 stars without it.

This recipe is a keeper. Quick and easy to follow. I took others advice and added garlic, but omitted the tomatoes since my son doesn't like them. I was pleasantly surprised. I am definitely adding to my rotation.

I haven't even made this but know it's great because I make an almost identical recipe that we love! My recipe came from an Avon cookbook that I purchased in 1982 ( I think). In mine you cook the tomatoes and green pepper for 15 minutes. The tomatoes cook down and mostly disappear but the flavor they add is wonderful!

I omitted the tomatoes.  I doubled the sauce/marinade ingredients (as another reviewer suggested) but reduced the amount of sugar by half.  Using a work, I stir fried the onions and peppers together with  3 cloves of minced garlic and then added a little beef broth and covered the wok to let the veggies wilt down a little. When I returned the beef to the stir fried vegetables I also added about 1/2 cup of beef broth.  This increased the amount of sauce in the dish but it was still thick enough.  I served it with steamed white rice.  My husband and I loved both loved it!

Very good flavoring. I did marinate the meat for a couple of hours. Also next time I will not add the recommended corn starch. I would make it thinner

Made this recipe without the tomatoes. I didn't think the sauce would be as thick as it was but I like to have some actual sauce left in the pan to use over the white rice to go with the pepper steak. The sauce tasted ok but was a bit sweet for my liking.

This was delicious! I used 1/2 the sugar, doubled the soy sauce, added 1 cup of water, chopped carrots, broccoli, celery. So good Thank you!
Made this again, no sugar but used a tablespoon of honey. Also, bought filet mignon because it was on sale and omg.....sooooo good!
Making this again using the left over roast from last night. Obviously no need to marinate. Cooking  the vege's first then adding the beef. Also adding broccoli.

Loved it!!! Tweeted it by grating fresh ginger very small amount and 1 clove garlic too. Served over brown rice. My 3 year old gobbled it up with us. I will make again.

I loved it so much. I didn't use ginger. I used garlic. I don't like tomatoes so I added different color peppers. This was so good :) thanks for an amazing recipe. My family loved it and want to make this a recipe for every week. Thanks a bunch.

This was great! Super easy to make. I doubled it up and added more veggies. ( I added peppers of all colors and mushrooms) .  This recipe is just as good the next day and is perfect for lunch leftovers. 
I will be making this again, thank you for sharing!

Excellent recipe! Both wife and I absolutely loved it ! And so easy!

I added a bit of Sriracha sauce to the marinade and marinated for about an hour. Didn't use tomatoes - looks like nobody did!

We reduced the ginger and cranked up the soy sauce a little. I would probably use more meat next time.

Omgeee! This was sooooo good! I tripled the recipe just to make sure I had enough meat and my kids loved it! The meat was super tender. It took longer than 30 minutes for me to make, but it was well worth it! I will definitely make this again!

great and easy recipe. omitted tomatoes because did not have any and added a jalapeno pepper because my garden is full and added a little kick. Going to try today with chicken because I have a no beef eater in the house. Thanks for the great easy recipe.

I used flank steak and real grated ginger(a few tablespoons) I also added sugar snap peas. This was excellent , will definitely cook again. This will be a fantastic, fast and easy weeknight meal for me. My three year old didn't think it was the best in the world, but the grown ups liked it!

I really liked this recipe. It worked out great because I didn't have fresh ginger on hand and it called for ground ginger, which I had. The taste was very good. Even my hubby liked it and he usually dislikes my stir fries. The only thing I did differently is use a slotted spoon to drain the beef I put in the wok/pan so it could stir fry instead of thicken the sauce before the veggies were cooked. I then added leftover sauce at the very end when the veggies were done. Stirred fried a minute more and the sauce thickened nicely.

This is a keeper! Our dinner table was silent tonight!! My son and husband LOVED it! I doubled the sauce and cooked the rest as directed. I also omitted the tomatoes. I served it over steamed rice. We used Sriracha sauce on the side to add some spice!! PERFECTION!!

Good flavor!  I also added broccoli and used canned stewed  tomatoes because I didn't have any fresh tomatoes.  I marinated the beef for a few hours and doubled the sauce.

Took a litte longer to make than indicated but it was good. I prefer my veggies cooked a little more, something the cook can control. We ate it over white rice, even the teenager cleared his plate. We will be making this again!

I made this recipe exactly as written. My family and I liked the flavor, was not a big fan of the tomatoes. I will likely make this again adding garlic and nixing the tomato.

This is delicious! My fiancée and I both loved it. I was a bit worried that the beef would be a bit tough since I didn't marinate it, but it was fine. Next time I'll add just a bit more ginger, but it was a great flavor as I prepared it.

This was very good, although I arrived at the finished product following some of the reviews. My NY sirloin strip steak was already in the freezer, so when it was almost thawed out, I sliced it (easy slicing this way) into thin slices ~ 1/4" thick. I sauteed the slices briefly and then removed from the pan, not wanting to overcook them later. In the same pan (without wiping out), I sauteed green and red peppers, a white onion, and some minced jarred garlic (skipped the tomato, personal preference). When that was cooked to my liking, I added the steak strips back in, along with the sauce and cooked for a few minutes. My steak was small, but I kept the amounts for the sauce the same. I also added about 1/2 cup of water towards the end because it seemed like it needed a little moisture. Enjoyed this with brown rice. Thanks for the nice recipe!

This was delicious! Very easy and fast to prepare.  I added mushrooms which were perfect for this dish.  Used 1 1/2 lbs of top sirloin and there was plenty of marinade to go around.  This will become a regular menu item for us especially when the weather prevents us from grilling.  The tomatoes I am gonna leave out next time.

We liked this recipe, basically followed instructions except used 1/2 red and 1/2 green pepper.   Used Splenda in place of sugar (faster dissolve).  Next time I will double the marinade (for more sauce over the rice) and let it soak for awhile as the meat was rather chewy.  I will also reduce tomato (roma) to 1 (family preference) and maybe toss in a few sliced mushrooms.  Easy & tasty!  A great way to stretch 1# of beef too.

For the sauce, I omitted the ginger and sugar and added 1tbs red pepper flakes and 1/2 tsp garlic. I marinated the steak for 2 hours and then cooked. For the veggies portion, I omitted tomato and added mushroom and broccoli. Husband loved it, I will be making this often!

A very easy and tasty meal that can be made in no time.  I wish I had fresh ginger to use, but it was still very good.

This recipe was amazing, my family loved it. They couldn't get enough of it. The only thing I did was I added 1/2 tsp of minced garlic. I have made pepper steak before but wasn't as good as the recipe I found here. So thank you so much MrsWilson...

5 Star all the way! Way better than any "take out" I've ever had. Used 1.5lb venison. Marinated for 6 hrs, doubled the sauce (used aloha shoyu soy), cut out the tomatoes and added mushrooms. This is now a household favorite.

absolutely fantastic! My only recommendation would be to fry the onion and pepper together for 5-6 minutes, then add the beef and tomatoes. A keeper recipe!

This is the closest recipe I have found to the pepper steak I order in Asian restaurants. It's really good. I had to cook the meat longer than the recipe said to do. I also ended up putting some water in after I got the vegetables cooking so there was sauce as it mostly absorbed into the meat initially. Adding the water made a perfect sauce and I served the dish over rice. The recipe has really good flavor without being too salty.

Better than my fave Chinese take-out! I followed the chefs instructions and all turned out better than I expected. Tender beef and tender/crisp veggies. Used onion, green pepper and celery since that's what I had on hand. Served with Minute Rice. Dinner served in less than 30 min! Thanks Mrs Wilson!

Added mushrooms, red and yellow pepper. Switched from Red Onion to Sweet Onion. Much better the second time. Kids want to not have tomato next time.

My family and I loved this. It was great. It think it got better as it set. Left overs were even better than dinner. I don't think the Prep/cooking times worked out for me.   It took me at least 45 minutes to prep and cook. Not a week night quick dinner in my opinion but a super Saturday night meal.

I just made this fantastic dish! Here is how I did mine...I followed the recipe as stated......However,  I made a few changes. I marinated the meat for 24 hours and added garlic salt, sesame seed oil and a little peach juice, this addition to the marinade seem to make the meat sweet and juicy. If you decide to add these ingredients, it's an acquired taste. You can add as little or as much as you want, there is no measurement required. Try this dish and enjoy! PS I posted a photo of my completed accomplishment .  Shelene

Pretty good, nice flavor to the marinade. I left the meat in the marinade for a few hours instead of just 30 minutes, and I threw in some sugar snap peas with the green pepper for even more crunch. My husband complained about the tomatoes, claiming stir fry should NEVER have tomatoes in it! I also cooked all the meat at once instead of 3 batches, then did the onions and peppers and snap peas at the same time. Didn't make sense (to me) to do them separately. Tomatoes or no tomatoes, this was good. May add some water chestnuts next time for even more crunch!

The beef was very tender.  I tasted an oily taste when eating it.   Oil too much or too hot in my wok? I cooked the beef first, removed it and cooked the onions and peppers then added the beef back to the wok.

My husband and I loved this.  I used leftover beef from the Christmas roast. Marinated as I cut everything else. Stir fried the whole batch briefly and then continued as directed.  Fast, easy, tasty.  Five star food!

I loved this recipe and will be making again. I only made a few changes...I added mushrooms, garlic powder, pepper and crushed red pepper flakes. I also doubled the meat and tripled the sauce and put it over noodles instead of rice. It was delicious. Thank you!!

Quick, easy, tasty recipe.  I liked the addition of the tomato (sweetened the dish), but my family didn't.  I also found that putting in the sauce with the meat made it stick to the pan.  Next time I will cook the meat, then add the veggies and add the sauce only the last couple of minutes.

My BF & I loved it! I didn't have any ginger though, so that wasn't included in the marinade.  But, it still came out very good.  I let it marinate for abt 2 hours before cooking.  Then, I added like 1/4 cup extra water towards the end to make it a lil more saucy.  I added 2 pics.

It was extremely salty. It would have been better with low sodium soy sauce. It wasn't a hit and I won't be making again.

Had this last night and hubby ate a huge helping of it. Easy to make, just chop everything before hand. I marinated the steak for a couple of hours and did double the sauce. Did use fresh ginger, otherwise made exactly as directed. Will definitely make again.

Will DEFINITELY be making this again. It was very tasty. I did add garlic (2 cloves) as a couple of others had suggested. I also doubled the sauce since I had 1lb 9 oz of meat. Will be adding this to my regular rotation as it was super easy. I marinated the meat for a couple of hours and I think that helped with the flavor and with the tenderness.. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I LOVED this! The flavor was great! I did double up on the sauce (I Like my Chinese dishes extra saucy!) I also cooked the left over sauce with the veggies and added lots of fresh garlic. You can also reduce the sugar if needed and it will still taste good :)

I had some left over London broil.  I added some onion and peppers to it, no tomatoes and put it over some brown rice.  Yummy and easy.

This recipe surprised me with the technique of marinating the steak in the corn starch.  It totally changed the texture of the meat.  It was so delicious I could not get enough.  This will definitely be a new family favorite.  Love it.

We thought if was very good. Very salty - I did not use the salt like the recipe called for and the other reviewers said to omit. I also added chopped garlic to the marinade and did not use tomatoes or ginger (did not have on hand). Next time I would use low-sodium or find something to mix with it. I used 1.5 lbs of meat and thought I needed to quadruple the recipe bc the sauce didn't seem like enough. It ended up being too saucy and I should've made extra to keep on the side and add in as needed (I should've just stuck to doubling it). Overall it had a great taste and thick sauce and rated great over rice. I sliced the beef according to a you tube video and it came out tender.

This was quite good. Made it without cornstarch to cut the carbs. Also used honey instead of sugar. The only problem was that i found it to be too salty. I ended up adding a little water and then spooning the extra liquid out. That helped to decrease the saltiness. The texture still turned out good.

It's great.!  Doubled the sauce too.  Used london broil (toughest meat)  turned out very tender.  I did marinate it for 2 days (work kept me from cooking).  Used a little Sesame oil mixed with regular oil in the wok (frying pan), don't have a wok-electric stoves do not create the right amount of heat.  I did add the tomatoes (don't know why it calls for it), but the whole meal (with cooked rice) came out great.  I do appreciate other reviews: helps me decide how or what to add.  Wish I could add the fish sauce, shrimp sauce, sauces like that but makes me ill.  Thanks for recipe.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I modified it just a bit.  My kids have trouble with corn starch, so I made a roux and used that thicken the sauce.  I also added 1 tsp of minced garlic to the sauce.  I then browned all the steak before adding it to the sauce.  Then I dumped the steak and sauce with the onion and cooked it until the onions were tender. I then added green and red bell peppers.  I've never heard of Chinese Pepper Steak with tomatoes, so I left them out.  It was really good and we will definitely make this again.

This was good considering how few ingredients the marinade had. I did use sesame oil to give it more flavor and served it over brown rice.

This is sooo good! I used twice as much meat sliced very thin. I used two bell peppers, and two yellow onions sauteed, tripled the sauce, and put the raw meat, and sauce in to the pan with the peppers/onions and a cup of water to make more sauce. I cooked it on med. high until the beef was cooked and the sauce thickened.

This recipe was terrific! I did omit the tomatoes, and add some fresh garlic. Next time I will be sure to double it! One reviewer said she marinated the meat overnight, and I would highly reccomend this. I did, and it was great.

I enjoyed this thoroughly.  I stir fry a lot (I highly suggest the book Wok Fast), and this was just plain old yummy and simple.  
Couple of things:
1. I thought the marinade looked a little bland.  Fine for marinading, but if I was going to use it as a sauce as well (which you should NOT do with chicken), I wanted some kick so I added in a couple squirts of sriracha.  YUMMMMM.
2. For those who left out the tomatoes because you don't like them: If you have never stir fried tomatoes, I highly suggest giving a try with little tiny ones (I think they are called grape?) cut in half.  I NEVER eat tomatoes, but I love them like this.  Plus, very good for you.
3. Someone above suggested adding celery, and I think thats a brilliant idea.

By far the best recipe I have tried. I make my own version of this and then I decided to try this one. A different version with a few different ingredients. My family loved it. Will definetly be cooking it this way from now on. Only thing different I doubled the sauce. Mmmm good!

A very good pepper steak recipe, and so quick! I ran out of soy sauce so I did half soy sauce and half hoisin sauce, which made a nice gravy. The recipe doesn't say whether to add the gravy back into the pan after cooking the beef, but I did this and it added a lot of flavor to the veggies. Didn't have tomatoes so I added two bell peppers, plus some mushrooms I had on hand. This is a keeper!

We like to have extra sauce so I also mixed about 1 Tb corn starch into 1/2 cup beef stock and added that at the very end of cooking.  I then simmered a few minutes until thickened.  I also added minced garlic to the marinade for a little extra flavor.

One onion is too much. The beef was excellent, but we used 2/3 of a red onion and there was still too much onion. We also did not like the tomatoes with it but we added peas and that made it great. Overall, it was really good.

SO GOOD! Living in SF they don't make Chinese food the way they do up north, so I decided to give this a shot. My boyfriend and I loved it, the only thing I did differently was add the beef in all at once and I added a little more soy sauce when it was finished. Served with white rice. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first try at Stir Fry.  Have been trying to change up our old boring menu.  My kids absolutely looooved this!!  Not one drop was left!  The only thing I did leave out was the tomatoes as I have one kiddo that doesn't like them.  They raved and raved and asked me to cook it again!  I didn't alter one thing of this recipe other than leaving out that tomatoes, but that's just personal preference.  :)
