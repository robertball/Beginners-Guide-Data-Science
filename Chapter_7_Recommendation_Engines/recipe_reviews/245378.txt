The cake is delicious and ended up being very dense and moist.  There was a little confusion when it came to making the mousse.  The recipe calls for a 1/4 cup of warm water, but there is no use for it in the instructions.  I ended up using a few teaspoons because the chocolate mixture was so thick, but not a full 1/4 cup.  There was also no sugar called for in the mousse.  I added 1/4 cup thinking the water was a typo.  I'm happy I did because the mousse would have been too bitter without it.
