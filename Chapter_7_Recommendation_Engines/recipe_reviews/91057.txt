The thing I liked the most about this recipe is that you can change it up as much as you like. You can go savory or sweet with it. I did have to add about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup of extra water though as the recipe was too dry (I did the recipe without using a mixer). Still a very easy, flexible recipe.

Was very easy to make and very tasty. Did not add any more water, but did add some sugar and cinnamon. Served them warm with honey. YUMMY!

This was really good, being that I had very minimum ingredients on hand for other types of bread.  I added a bit more water as one reviewer noted, which made a significant difference.  After I rolled it out, I just cut into 16 pieces and fried instead of cutting afterwards.  Overall, very good.  Thanks!

Great, simple, unleavened bread. My family loved it and it was fun to eat something different. Served with honey.
