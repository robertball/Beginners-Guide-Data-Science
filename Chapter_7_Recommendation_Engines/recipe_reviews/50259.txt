I used Great Northern Beans and baked for 6 hours.  I forgot to soak the beans overnight - but boiled them for 10 minutes or so and let them sit for an hour.  This was worth having the oven on all that time.  Everyone loved these!  *** UPDATE*** Tried again with Kidney beans, but put in a crockpot cause it was too hot for the oven to be on all day.  They were good in a crockpot - but sooo much better with Northern in the oven. . . COOK the bacon before you add it to the beans and bake.

I was relieved to find a recipe without any canned beans!  I used white beans, and a combination of molasses and maple syrup rather than sugar.  We took it to a BBQ, and it went so fast, I had to scrape the pan to get a taste!

I made these overnight last night. I used Northern beans, which I prefer for baked beans.  I used a whole pound of bacon and the flavor of the bacon is really nice. I found the overall taste REALLY bland. So this morning I added: ~ 2 tbsp Worcestershire, 1/4 cup ketchup, 1 tsp onion flakes, 1 tsp dry mustard and about 1/4 cup of real maple syrup.  There's already an improvement. I will serve them tonight to my BF, who tasted them this morning and also thought they were bland.  We are really partial to Clark's canned baked beans and I have been trying to replicate their recipe for quite some time.

This recipe is a very good starting place.  If you like sweet beans with no hotness or spice, this is for you.  I will make this again, but will add some zip to it.  Jalapeno, hot sauce or something like that.  Very flavorful.  Kids love the sweet taste, but need to get paste the texture of kidney beans!

First off. I'd like to thank whoever posted this for putting a recipe out there that didn't include 'Can(s) of Baked Beans' in the recipe. I doubled this recipe and threw it into a big ole slow cooker. I gave 8 hours on high and then another 8 on low. The beans kept their shape but melted on the tongue. The taste was spot on. Thanks again for a great recipe.

We loved these beans, they were so easy to prepare! I have a recipe for beans that is similar in flavor but much more labor intensive! These beans rock!!!

Bf said he really liked these but could do without the onions and with less bacon.  I used turkey bacon and less of it, but it definitely was a bit of bacon overkill.  I also got a little crazy with the water--I cooked in the crockpot so probably didn't need as much.  I used canned (don't have dry right now) and used 1 can of kidney and one can of black beans.  Tastes great in the crockpot, so I'm sure it would be even better baked in the oven as directed.  Thanks for the recipe!  We'll make again with less bacon and onion powder instead of onions.

I used this as more of a base recipe. Like one other reviewer had mentioned, it is so hard to find a recipe without using canned beans. I used Great Northern Beans, a mix of maple syrup and dark brown sugar, paired with a little mustard, some small swigs of hot sauce, a little sage, cumin, onion powder, a little garlic powder, salt and pepper. I started the beans out in the crock pot, but switched to stove top in a large pot when after several hours, when they still weren't boiling. I simmered the sauce ingredients on the stove top and then added to the beans. While beans were in the crock pot with the water, I added chopped onion and green pepper. We had these with beef hot dogs. I thought they were good...even better the next day!

This sounds like my Grandmother's recipe that was lost years ago! I am going to try it right away.  One question, does the bacon make them greasy?  I know she used a piece of salt pork.
