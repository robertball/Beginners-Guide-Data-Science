Neither of us were a fan.  I halved the recipe and followed it except to add the 1/4 c of Mexican blend cheese since I didn't have any.  I just don't think it would have made a difference.  We ate it with corn tortilla chips and while both of us ate some, it was not something we wished to repeat.  Sorry.

Served this for Super Bowl. Easy & yummy. The only thing I would do differently would be to add another can of chicken. So much cheese that the chicken was almost unnoticed.
