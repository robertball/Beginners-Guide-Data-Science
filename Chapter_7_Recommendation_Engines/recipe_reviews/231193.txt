Yes, simply delicious! Such an easy and filling recipe. I used chicken breast meat left over from making Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style, omitted the leek because I didn't have it, and sliced up baby carrots. The broth was very flavorful due to the spices. A wonderful soup that I look forward to making again this fall and winter.

This was a nice, basic, quick, and simple chicken and rice soup that was exactly what I was looking for to use up some turkey leftover from Thanksgiving.  The recipe was very good exactly as written, but next time I think I'll add an extra carrot, some mushrooms, and some parsley.  I will make this again.

Super easy and tasty! I made this for a potluck and had several people ask for the recipe. I always add more spices than recipes call for, but this one doesn’t need much. I just add more poultry seasoning (I really think that’s what makes it so good). I also add a little chicken bouillon too. SO GOOD. I make this several times a year

This is a simple and very good recipe. I’ve made it with rice and noodles. It’s great either way. When using noodles it doesn’t have to cook as long as the rice.

Super Yummy.  I added too much rice and needed more stock but had none on hand.  So, I added a cream of chicken/mushroom can and the required water to the soup and it was amazing.   I had no celery but added broccoli.

03.23.17 ~ My MIL LOVES soup, of any kind, any day of the week, any month of the year.  I try to make it often and freeze individual containers for her.  It was a snowy March day when I whipped up this recipe.  She loved it, DH liked it but wished I would have added more vegetables.  They both commented that it had a nice flavor to it.

Nothing really stand-out about this, but it's a solid, satisfying chicken soup.
