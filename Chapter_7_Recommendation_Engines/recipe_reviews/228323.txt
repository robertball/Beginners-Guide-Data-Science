This was quick and delicious. I used about ten mini Oreos to make this. I skipped the whipped cream to save on some calories (LOL), but I think it would be a nice decadent touch. The only thing I'd warn is that, if you're going to serve this to two people, the servings will be VERY small. I made the whole recipe and got one rocks glass worth of milkshake. That's okay: I wasn't going to share it anyway.

No homemade whipped cream on hand, I used Cool Whip. I made no other changes. The kids told me that this was the best milkshake they'd ever had. They were still talking about how good it was this morning over breakfast.

Awesome recipe! But if your making one for just you do 2 servings and not 1 because 1 serving is very small otherwise it tasted great

We used cookie dough ice cream and golden Oreos and a frozen banana.  My daughter said it was just like an Dairy Queen Blizzard!
