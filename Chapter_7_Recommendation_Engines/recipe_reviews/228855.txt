I used a homemade freezer jam in this recipe. I'm sorry this wasn't for us. Noone really liked it.

I used home made jam for this. The first time I followed it exactly and it was good. But the second time I added extra jam and a little less milk and it was lovely. Thick and creamy - a very quick and easy dessert or breakfast dish. Thank you.

Delicioso! I used greek yogurt and extra cherry flavored gelatin powder and more milk. The yogurt had blueberry so I omitted the jam. The only one who did not like I was my 5yr. old but I loved it. Thanks
