Another take on a simple breakfast favorite that allows for a great deal of latitude and versatility to accommodate individual tastes. (And to use up things in your fridge you don't want to go to waste when you're headed out of town)

I used fresh tomatoes instead of salsa. Since my dad's stroke his taste is very different and trying to find things he'll eat is difficult and he wanted seconds of this!

I used the bigger tortillas and made burritos. I also added sour cream. Will definitely make them again.

Will definitely make it again. I had no salsa though, so I used taco sauce and I also added some leftover corn
