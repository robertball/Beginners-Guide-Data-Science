It was the Easiest recipe I had the pleasure of making from this site!  My picky husband acutally had 3 servings!  Didn't have canned vegetable soup, so used a can of undeluted tomato soup, and it turned out perfect.  I did add a little squirt of BBQ sauce, and it was very delicious, hit-the-spot quick meal.  We'll be having it again. Thank you for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exact and really it was just ok.  My other half still says Manwich is the best.  I will not be making this recipe again.

I couldn't believe this recipe was on here!  My mom made these for me as a kid and I make them now for mine.  Even my eleven-month-old, who is just learning to eat table food, gobbles them up.  I keep mine pretty simple--a can of alphabet vegetable soup (yes, with the letters), a little water, a bit of seasoning salt, and a tablespoon of tomato paste.  That's it.  The simplicity of it is the beauty.  Goes great with macaroni and cheese.

this is a recipe i grew up on, my mother learned it in home ec in the 60's and we ate it all the time because it was a favorite.i never change the recipe and my son eats almost half of it himself. i was surprised to see it here because whenever i mention it to someone they don't understand how it would work i guess becauge of the soup.but it's an awesomely delicious quick lunch or dinner

I made these last night -- I added a few extra flavors for my taste (like worcestchire sauce, extra ketchup, and a teensy bit of BBQ sauce), and it tasted pretty good. Not the most amazing meal ever, but the best part was that my insanely picky three-year old ate it up. At first he just wanted to eat the bun, but I made him try it with meat in it and he ate almost a whole hoagie roll with the joe inside. I'll definitely make it again- I like the addition of the soup.

I used a can of cream of broccoli soup and it was delicious. I also added some chopped celery to the hamburger and onions. I salted the beef while it was cooking and did not add extra salt to the sauce. I served open-faced, piled on the toasted bun halves and with a salad. The variations are endless...I want to try cream of onion and cream of mushroom

This was awesome! The only thing i did differently, mostly due to lack of onions, was use a handful of frozen chopped onion and red and green bell pepper mix. Husband said it was the best sloppy joes he's had.

Surprisingly good. As I was making it up, I was really convinced it was not going to taste at all like real sloppy joes. Boy, was I wrong! They were great. Only draw back is that I couldn't find vegetable soup without alphabet noodles in them. Kind of funny to have a random "K" or "P" in your joes.
