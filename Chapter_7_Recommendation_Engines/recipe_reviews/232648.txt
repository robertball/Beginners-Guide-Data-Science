Fabulous! And, not to mention a wonderful Greek twist on a classic grilled steak! Since my husband loves steak this proved to be a nice change of pace from our standard way of preparing these. The cucumber and tomato salad was a delicious accompaniment - all we did to complete the meal was add a baked potato and a nice glass of wine!

We rubbed the steaks lightly with olive oil in addition to the Greek seasoning. I think they could've used a bit more flavor, or sat for a while before grilling to soak up the flavor. The salad was refreshing and I did drizzle it with Italian dressing.

These steaks were amazing. Cooked mine medium rare and loved the flavor of the seasoning with them! The salad was a bit lacking (guess I'm not used to simple ones) but was still good. I look forward to tweaking it next time!

This recipe is just fabulous. The first time I tried it just as I got ready to light the grill the sky suddenly opened with a total deluge so I had to broil it. It was great. But I did a redo tonight cooking ir on my Weber grill and it is spectacular! The best part is that it is so simple. I want to try it yet again using some wood chips to smoke it a bit. It would be a great choice if you want to impress a date.  Watch for t bones to go on sale if money is an issue. You owe it to yourself and your family to try this recipe.

I used a Mediterranean seasoning with this recipe.  This recipe contained such a small amount of ingredients to use and packed with flavor.  Don't cook your steaks until they're well done with this!  Medium rare to medium is perfect.  Some might prefer a bit more salt, but I really enjoyed the simplicity of this dish.  Wait until you have it on the table and decide to salt later.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Also, it might be tempting to add some oil to the salad, but refrain!  You won't miss it!  I have an infrared grill and put hickory chips in prior to cooking the steaks.  I put the steaks on when they started to smoke.  This is a simple recipe to make with great end results (especially if you're experienced with the grill).

We LOVED this recipe.  I made my own greek seasoning and mixed that in about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and brushed on the steaks before grilling.    We used a porterhouse and it turned out delicious.  Since I was out of feta cheese, I used blue cheese instead.   Thanks for an excellent recipe.

We love a good steak in Texas, and this lemony version was very nice for a summer cook-out. The salad was a colorful and nutritious pairing. Very good! Make sure you let the steak rest for a few minutes before slicing into it.

We thought that this was pretty good, however, I think that the temperatures given in the recipe are way too high.  For medium rare I cook to about 125.  With a 10 minute resting time it is perfectly medium rare.  To cook to 165 for medium for me would be way overdone.  Of course this is totally subjective.  
We only eat organic beef and a T-bone was not available so I used a Rib eye.  Spices were nice.  Thanks.

This was sooo good!  I didn't change a thing and it turned out great!  I did sprinkle some fresh basil on top of it just because I love basil :-)  I will make this again!

Wow! If you like Greek flavors this is a delicious, simple and quick recipe that packs alot of flavor. The only changes I made was to use a beautiful Prime grade tri tip from Costco that I had in my freezer and I added some olive oil to the rub/dressing. If you do not have Greek seasoning, there is a pretty good recipe for it here on AR. I would add a teaspoon of dried mint to that recipe though. We love the rub so much that next time I will double it. What a wonderful & simple dinner on a warm summer night. Thanks so much for sharing!

This was a fantastic recipe for a warm summer night!  I rubbed my steaks with Persian lime olive oil and then the rub and let them sit while I made the salad.  The flavor of both the steak and the salad was delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The steak was super simple and the salad was great with fresh sweet grape tomatoes and cucumbers fresh out of the garden. I used Greek Seasoning Blend from this site changing it to 2 servings and it made the perfect amount for this recipe. My steaks were thin and did get a tad overcooked so be sure to watch that.

We will make this again and again.  The zingy, bright salad is the perfect complement to the rich, juicy steak.

Exceptional - and be sure to make the accompanying cucumber and tomato salad, it's fabulous, especially with my Sweet 100 cherry tomatoes from the garden. This is a keeper.

WOW, I can't say enough about this marinade...such great flavor on the beef along with grilling!  I made a Greek salad with the cucumbers, tomatoes, garlic and herb feta cheese, and I added in some kalamata olives...sooooo good!!!

I made my own Greek seasoning using a recipe on this site and let the steak set for about 45 minutes after applying the rub mixture. So very good I will make this recipe again. Fresh cucumbers and tomatoes from my garden made a good salad even better. Yummy.

We make steaks often and this Greek version was a nice change-up. The flavor was not too overpowering and it complimented the beefy taste of my porterhouse steaks very well. 
I did not make the salad, only because I made this in a pinch and didn't have the ingredients on hand. I will definitely make it to go along with the steaks next time.

What can I say, but, fabulous!  Based on the suggestion of mauigirl I used the greek seasoning recipe from this site with the addition of fresh garlic.  I rubbed the steak lightly in olive oil and massaged the dry rub into the steak.  It was the perfect balance of herbs with a light citrus taste.  I wasn't sure if I would like the salad without any oil added, but, it was very good and had a refreshing lemon taste.  Very yummy!

This recipe packs insanely delicious flavour. Plus nothing, minus nothing. Crank your grill up to 500° for those must have grill marks, and in less than 30 minutes you'll have a dinner cheaper, and tastier than what your local steak house will make you!
