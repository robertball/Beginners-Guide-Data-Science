I had to tweak this a bit to use what I had on hand. No whole wheat bread, but I did have some leftover bolillo rolls (1-1/2 to be exact) that needed to be used up, so I just cubed those up instead. I used leftover ham from yesterday's Easter dinner and a tiny chunk of fontina cheese and a bit of Pecorino Romano to make 1/4 cup. I don't buy the diced tomatoes that contain the basil, garlic and oregano because Hubs hates them - so I used a can of plain diced tomatoes, and then added my own fresh basil, some dried oregano and fresh garlic. Because I used fresh garlic, I cut the garlic powder back to 1/2 tsp. It was DELICIOUS! Pretty much the same recipe, just subbing to use what I had on hand. That's what I love about recipes like this . . . with the same basic ingredients, you can create something fabulous! This is going to be a light dinner for tonight, after our food coma from yesterday's Easter feast!

This was a very good recipe that is easy to tweak based on what you have on hand.  I didn't have any cream so I used 2% milk instead.  I didn't have the canned tomatoes the recipe called for but I diced up two fresh Roma tomatoes and added some fresh basil.  Instead of whole wheat bread I used the cheese/garlic bread from Costco.  I decided to add some green onion and diced red pepper too.  This one's a keeper!

Found the recipe this morning & decided to make it for Father's Day.  I used chopped up sausage patties, because my husband prefers that.  I realized I had prepped too much sausage & broccoli, so I used a larger dish and increased all the ingredients a bit.  I only have no salt added diced tomatoes (without the herbs), so I sprinkled in some Italian seasoning.  And I used half & half instead of heavy cream, because that's what I had.  ~~ It came together easily & we enjoyed it.  My husband said he would prefer it without broccoli, so I'm knocking off one star for that.  This is a flexible recipe, which could easily be modified to have a Tex-Mex flair with some sautéed onions & peppers and a little different seasonings.  ~~ Thanks so much for sharing the recipe, Muffin Boots!

I am giving this 5 stars as I believe it would be great as written. We gave been snowed in so I had to use what i had on hand. In place of the pepper jack, I used shredded Mexican cheese and 2% milk for cream. I didn’t have the seasoned canned tomatoes but had a Roma and a few grape tomatoes which i seasoned with 3/4 tsp dried basil and 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano along with garlic powder called for in original recipe. I only baked 30 minutes as i like my eggs less firm. It was easy and delicious! Next time I will do as another reviewer and try turkey sausage.? Also as I am a broccoli lover, I will add a bit more! Thanks for great recipe!

Great recipe!  I will be making again, I did make modifications as one of us is gluten free and cow dairy free.  So I used homefried potatoes for the base and a milk substitute for the whipping cream and goat cheese.  Everyone loved it! Thanks for a great base recipe, so versatile can make lots of changes for suited for you...this one is a keeper!

Delicious!  I added 2 more eggs and a little more cream and baked for 30 minutes.
