I cut this recipe in half down to 16 servings. Instead of using 1 1/2 eggs, I used two full eggs. I did have to add a little more oil than what was asked for because using half wheat flour made it drier than I think it would have been had I used all AP flour. I made this into muffins instead of one big loaf. I did not get 16 muffins, I got eleven and they were on the smaller side. Before baking, I sprinkled each muffin mound with a little cinnamon sugar. Very nice, basic zucchini bread recipe. It reminds me a lot of the one my Mom made when I was a child.

This zucchini bread is not as sweet as other zucchini breads I have made.  The nuttiness of the whole wheat flour gives the bread great flavor and texture.  Out of habit, I beat the first four ingredients together very well before mixing in the zucchini, and then mixed in the entire amount of the dry ingredients.  Also out of habit, I lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper for ease in removing the bread from the pan.  If you are looking for a little variation in zucchini breads, this is a nice recipe to try.

This zucchini bread was awesome.  I did add more cinnamon but the fact that its half enriched white flour and the other half is whole wheat is a bonus.

I used 2/3 C of applesauce and 1/2 C coconut oil. I did not have two loaf pans so I made a dozen muffins and one loaf. I baked the muffins and the loaf at the same time but took out the muffins around 25 minutes. Turned out really good??
