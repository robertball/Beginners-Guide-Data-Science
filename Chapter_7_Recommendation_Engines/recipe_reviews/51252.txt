It is a great authentic recipe especially for Korean BBQ beef except that we don't frequently use flour in it(never heard of it, actually). Add 1Tb rice wine(don't substitute it with vinegar) or any kind of wine available, 2Tbs corn syrup or honey, 1/2 minced or finely chopped small onion and it would be perfect. Can be used for 1 1/2-2lbs beef depending on the saltness of soy sauce.

I tried this recipe with beef short ribs to make Korean kalbi and it tasted just like my mother's home cooking!  The only thing she does differently is to rub the sugar onto the meat first and let it sit for awhile before marinating it with the rest of the ingredients.  Anyway, I really enjoyed this recipe and will use it again.

Very good! A tasty marinade that smells wonderful while the food is cooking. I made a couple of changes that enhanced the recipe for my family. 
#1 I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar; the brown sugar gives a deeper color & flavor.
#2 Like other reviewers, I used sesame oil {dark} in place of sesame seeds.
#3 I used lots more onions in addition to scallions.
  Thanks, Curlie for a delicious marinade.

My girlfriend and I enjoyed this recipe.  I especially enjoy marinating meat for a couple of days before grilling, broiling, or frying.  I substituted the sesame seeds with more sesame oil.

This marinade was awesome with boneless chicken breast and grilled.  Even my pickiest eater liked it.  I took leftover marinade and sauted fresh green beans in it, which made for a great side dish with the chicken.  Thanks, Laura

My in-laws are Korean, and my mother-in-law is famous for her Korean barbeque marinade. After making this recipe, I now have my own version that I am proud to share with my in-laws! It is excellent, and is useful with just about any cut of beef, especially short ribs.

It's very easy to do, all the ingredients are right under my cupboard.  My husband loves it and it's very simple to do (or did i say that already?).

Awesome Marinade! I had to substitute a little onion powder for the green onion. I cut up a sirloin steak and soaked it in the marinade for one hour.  Then I threaded it on bamboo skewers for kabobs on the grill and served with fried rice. I have another keeper thats not just the same ol' same ol'!

This fell really short of my expectations I guess. I just didn't like it much. I think I will try it again with a longer marinade time (was overnight).

I'm Korean -- born in Seoul and raised in CA by immigrant parents.  I vividly recall the Sunday-after-church-Korean-BBQ-beef -- and this recipe is what I share with all my friends b/c we all love Korean BBQ, so I'm talking authentic.  It's AGAIN, authentic, and amazingly simple and DEELISH.  I add a little extra garlic, but for those who are not comfortable with the white sugar and flour, you can sub with brown sugar (you'll need a bit more) and use half the recommended flour.  Believe me, I've looked at other recipes online and they can't touch this.

I scaled this recipe down by half to marinate about a lb of beef. As suggested by other users, I added 1 tbsp of rice wine. I omitted the green onions simply because I never have any on hand. I use this marinade for beef stir fry. It tastes great!

What a fantastic marinade! I marinated turkey breast cutlets over night and made turkey lettuce wraps for lunch. I just diced the meat and threw it in a skillet with some vegetable oil, a diced jalapeno, matchstick carrots and chopped mushrooms. I poured in the leftover marinade, and when the turkey was done cooking I stirred in some diced water chestnuts. We wrapped the mix up in lettuce leaves with a dash of Sriracha and we had a delicious meal! I didn't deviate from the recipe at all, except I used yellow onion instead of green onion because I was out. This was the perfect amount of marinade for a little over a poud of meat. I will definitely try this with chicken, pork, and beef. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Wow, wow, wow!!!  Made this for one of my weekly "friends" dinners, everyone loved it.  I marinated strips of Sirloin for stir-fry for 8 hours or so, added some sliced red peppers, onions, baby corn, and water chestnuts and served it over rice.  I added fresh ginger (because I use any excuse to use ginger).  My only regret was not making more for leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe, can't wait to try it on loin chops for the grill...

This marinade was pretty good.  I altered the recipie a bit by using red pepper flakes instead of black pepper, and omitted the seseme seeds (because I didn't have any) and flour.  I also added rice vinegar to the marinade.  Overall, it turned out okay.  I would have liked a stronger flavor, more intense flavor.

This marinade was great. I used it on a 1lb pork tenderloin. I was only going to use it for a 24hr marinade, but plans changed, so it was 48hrs. I had to use minced onion as I was out of scallions. I also added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce to it as well. Was absolutely fabulous. The next time I use this I will be using chicken and following it to a "T". This is just a great marinade.

I will definitely make this again.  I didn't have any green onions so I substituted chopped white onions and was still delicious.  You must use sesame oil though, there is no substitute for it!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out fantastic. I live in an apartment and so I don't have an outdoor grill. I pounded the chicken thin and then used my George Foreman grill. My husband loved it and it's nice to have something else to do with plain chicken.

This is an awesome Marinade! We Marinaded chicken in it overnight & cooked it on the grill. In a separate bowl I marinated broccoli, sliced onion & a green bell pepper. I threw marinade & vegetables in a pan and covered them and cook until the veggies were soft. I tossed the veggies & the grilled chicken together when all were done and served over white rice. The marinade boiled down to a wonderful sauce! Everyone LOVED it!

Fabulous marinade! I sliced my chicken breasts into thin filets. I made the marinade almost exactly as written. (I omitted the green onions). I marinated the chicken breasts for two hours and my husband grilled them. They came out wonderfully and my kids ate them up. I might try skewering them and making them as an appetizer sometime. I served this with a side of vegetable lo mein for a super tasty meal.

Awesome!!  I used this marinade to soak chicken breast strips, and grilled them skewered on bamboo skewers (accompanied by the rice and cold beer that the author recommended!)  My only changes were personal preference; I omitted the flour, and substituted about a half teaspoon of Vietnamese chili sauce for the black pepper.  Plenty of flavour, and used the leftovers to add to "Fried Rice with Ginger, Hoisin, and Sesame" (elsewhere on this site) for a great flavour combo.  I will use this marinade on EVERYthing I grill!  Fabulous!

Had Skirt Steak with this marinade on top of Jap Chae - it was very good.  The addition of the flour to the marinade makes it "stick" a little better to the meat.  Everyone asked for seconds!

I was looking for a marinade without white sugar. So, I used this one, but replaced sugar with a squirt of agave syrup. I also added a tbsp. of tequila. Marinading overnight (mine were chicken thighs) worked well.

I used this on beef flank steak (sliced it up first) and sliced yellow onions tonight.  I used 1 lbs. sliced flank steak and 1 medium size yellow onion.  I thought the flavor was good but definitely too salty for my taste.  I used Kikkoman organic soy sauce (imported from Japan) and served these over rice.  Next time, I will use 3 onions (they shrunk quite a bit) and maybe even add sweet peppers or something, though they are not authentic Korean dish just to knock down the salty taste.

I love korean food! My mother is korean so I grew up eating it. However, when I asked my mom for a recipe, she didn't help me out too much. She used a little of this and a little of that. I was so excited to find this recipe. It is almost what I remembered her using. I used it to marinate some kalbi (korean short ribs). I left out the flour because I have never seen my mom use flour. My husband thinks that this is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

Great on flank steak!  Brought it to a BBQ with rave reviews.  I grilled an extra steak to slice up cold later in the week over an Asian style salad.  Delicious hot or cold!!!

This was one of six marinades I made several months ago to prep and freeze 40lbs of chicken breasts. I made the recipe as written - minus the flour because I wasn't sure how well that mixture would freeze. I just cooked it tonight as a Stir Fry. The chicken was marinated and frozen as half breasts. Before stir frying the (defrosted) chicken, I sliced it (about 1 - 1.5 lbs) into thin strips, then added to a hot pan with 1-2T vegetable oil, reserving the remainder of the marinade. After the chicken was throughly cooked, I removed it from the pan, heated up the skillet, and added about 1 cup of sliced carrot rounds, 1 cup of broccoli florets, and 1 whole red pepper cut into strips. After the veggies had cooked down quite a bit, I added the remaining marinade, and cooked it throughly for several minutes, then added the reserved chicken back in and cooked for a few more minutes. We served it over white rice and loved the flavor! Thank you for a delicious recipe.

This definitely satisfied my Asian food craving. I marinated chicken breasts and served them Korean-style soba noodles. the chicken turned out slightly salty (even with reduced sodium soy sauce) so next time I will not add any extra salt. I cannot wait to try it on other meats!

This is actually an amazing tofu marinade, believe it or not!  I have to admit I made a couple changes to make it a true 5 star recipe, but this recipe served as a great base.  I used agave nectar instead of sugar, 1 Tbsp. sesame oil instead of 2, added a bit of garlic & onion powders, and the juice of half a lemon.  Oh, and I omitted the flour.  Thanks for the great idea!  I loved the addition of sesame seeds.

A nice marinade, made a few changes the second time, based on preference and need. I omitted the flour  - I am a celiac, also used gluten-free tamari soy sauce - but feel that any flour, if it is wanted, or if deep-frying the meat, should definitely be added to meat after it is marinaded and before cooking, not to marinade itself. Also used brown sugar, 1 tsp. more brown sugar than recipe amount, 1 tablespoon rice wine, 1 extra garlic clove and 1/4 cup fine chopped regular onion in place of the green onion, and two generous pinches of black pepper. I used this variation on 2 cubed pork tenderloins, in marinade for 45 minutes. Added a touch more sesame oil in place of sesame seeds, as we were grilling the pork on the barbecue as kabobs (I don't like burnt sesame seed, which will happen on the barbecue).  Will try adding a drop of hot sauce or Chinese chili sauce the next time, as I like a little heat, but this version turned out quite well, husband really enjoyed it and has requested a repeat. Leftover pork was just as good the next day.  A handy marinade that you didn't have to think about or make the day before. Thank you for adding it.

Yum!  This was so good. I marinaded chicken thighs in a ziploc bag.  I was planning to marinade it overnight but plans changed and it marinaded for 2 days.  I was a bit worried that it might have over marinaded, but it was awesome!!

Super marinade!! Used it on boneless beef short ribs and it was perfect. I did omit the flour, cut back a tad on the sesame oil and, for a bit of spice, added a tablespoon of Korean hot pepper paste but red pepper flakes would do in a pinch. This one will definitely be used again and again!

I really like this. I did make a change or 2. I used brown sugar in place of white, I used 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2 olive oil with a pinch of chili sesame oil. (I was running low on sesame oil and didnt want to use it all), and I added 1 Tbsp of honey for the extra stickiness. I had never heard of putting flour in a marinade before, but I did put it in, and I cant say it hurt it any. If anything, made it thicker upon cooking the steak which I really enjoyed.  A definite save to my recipe keeper!

This was delicious, but I did cut back on the sugar as I usually do. The marinade is good to add to anything that you are sauteeing, like I did when I added a small amount to green beans (also think broccoli, asparagus, shrimp). It turned something boring into something great! If you have it on hand, you don't have to mix up all of the items separately when you need them for a quick meal. It's much better than what you get at the store, and you control the ingredients. Thanks Curlie!

Very good marinade.  I used it with thin cut pork loin slices which we grilled.  Love the sesame flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The flour wasn't weird at all, just thickened a bit so it was like the consistency of teriyaki sauce.

Way too salty for my taste, I'd recommend reduced-sodium soy sauce (and I used less than listed). I marinaded chicken and used it in a stiry fry which left a gray paste-like substance all over the pan and chicken (assuming from the flour and its meant more as a grilling marinade).  Might try again with low-sodium soy sauce, but it was nothing outside of a basic marinade.
