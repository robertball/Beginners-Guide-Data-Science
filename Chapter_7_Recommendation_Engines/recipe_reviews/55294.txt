This was fantastic!! I suppose that you could leave out the pecans if you or someone in your family doesn't like pecans,but I think the pecans add a certain something to it! I tried this out in hopes that I would have something new to make for the holidays and I think I have it!! Adults and kids in the family loved it!!

If you like Reece's peanut butter cups you'll love this pie! It was easy to make and super delicious! I suggest using a deep dish 9" ready made crumb crust or make your own deep dish pie crumb crust. The filling was spilling over the sides a bit that's why a deep dish would have worked better. Make sure you leave enough time for it to freeze up...This is a great pie to make the day before and let it freeze overnight. Kids & adults alike will love this pie!!! Enjoy!

This is a yummy pie, but be sure you love peanut butter.  The pb definately overshadows the chocolate (I was expecting something similar to a Reese's PB cup).  It's a great, easy pie.

This was excellent.  I just made it and only made a few changes.  I used only a bag of milk chocolate chips and used cool-whip fat-free topping to fold into mixture.
