I made the following changes: frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed mostly dry, shredded mozzarella, and a large shallot in place of the onion.  Also, I only used 1 sprig each of mint and basil.  These were pretty decent, very juicy burgers.  If anything,  I under seasoned them, so they were a bit bland, but nothing a little seasoned salt won't fix.  Served one patty over sliced tomatoes and cucumbers with a large dollop of artichoke jalapeno dip over all.  Great lunch!

I made these this summer for my friends and they were a huge hit! Make sure to serve them with the Tzatziki sauce.

Great recipe!  I used a 10 oz. box of frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) and my son requested meatloaf instead of burgers so I just mixed up the meat mixture and put it in a loaf pan, baked for about 1 - 1 1/4 hours.  I also made the spread for us to put on the meatloaf as we plated it.  Great will definitely make again!

My burgers fell apart on the grill a bit (probably too much stuff, not finely chopped enough and not enough meat in mine), but they are frickin' delicious!  I was pleasantly surprised by the mint. I was wary but it adds just the right touch of...something.

12/27/216 - Made the burgers but not the sauce, excellent flavor and presentation!  6/8/14 - Made burgers, left off the mayo sauce - was amazing!  So moist and flavorful and delicious!  Looks great on the plate, too!  I made a double batch and froze half for next time!  Love!

This was so easy and tasted great. I used frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) and I used a small jar of roasted red peppers from the store. This cut out a lot of prep time. Plus one pound of meat made 5 large burgers. Next time we will make 6 patties out of it. Very hearty meal. It even stuffed my husband.

Good flavor!  I did add a little Greek yogurt to the meat to help it stay together but it was still a little too tender - had to use care in flipping.  It browned up really fast so a lower temp is recommended.  Very juicy and so nice to have something different!

This did take alot of prep, specially cause i had to go and buy all the fresh herbs these burgers required but it was well worth all the effort. It was delicious! I found that the spread needs to be thinned out with a bit more mayo and lime juice but other than that i followed the recipe with very good results.

So good!!  I don't like peppers so I excluded them, and I added chopped kalamata olives, but I had everything else on hand and it was wonderful!  Very thankful I got to use the 3 herbs I grow in this so I didn't have to buy all three.  Oh, and it made 6 good size burgers.

Turned out really well. I used ground turkey instead which wasn't as flavorful but the rest of the ingredients were awesome. The sauce wasn't as good, needed more seasoning which I added to taste. Will definitely make again though!

I would recommend either cutting down on the spinach (about 4 oz) or increasing the amount of beef (1 1/4-1 1/2 pounds) or possibly both. Either way this will yield more burgers (we got 5 out of the original recipe). Additionally, we only used 6 oz of spinach and 5 oz of feta in the burgers and they completely fell apart. Again, I have no complaints about the taste (amazing!), but this recipe may be much better suited to a meatloaf.

Delicious! We used plain greek yogurt in place of the mayo for a tzaziki sauce. We also used jarred roasted red peppers to make this easier.  Great recipe!

These were amazing burgers. I served them last night for dinner to my husband and two young children. A great way to sneak in the veggies. We ate them without buns and just added the tasty sauce on top. I will definitely be making these again!

I love this recipe!!  I went with what I had in my fridge, so I got a little creative! I used half lamb & half beef. I didn’t have lime, so I used lemon, which was ok, lime would be better. I also used grilled onions because I had leftovers- and they were tasty with the red pepper.  I didn’t have spinach either, it didn’t matter, flavor wise, but I would like to try it with next time.  The flavors really “pop” especially with the sauce!!

Really good my husband and I both liked it I  followed the reciepes with no changes.  My husband suggested turning it into a meatloaf for a change. I think that’s what I will do, nothing to loose.

These sounded amazing to me.  However, I didn't find them that way. I don't know if it was just my personal taste for feta, but I found that it had too strong of a flavour.

I don't typically like just a big hunk of meat, so I was searching for a way to add more veggies and flavor to a boring old burger. These turned out great! I had a ton of feta left over from something else, so I used a bit more than what was called for in both the meat and sauce. I also subbed sour cream for the mayo in the sauce because I didn't have any. I would definitely make these again.
