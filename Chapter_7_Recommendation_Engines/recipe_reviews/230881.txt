Hi, I'm from Turkey and this is how we make Turkish coffees.

First, you need a coffeepot(we call it cezve) for Turkish coffees.

And you need a cup for Turkish coffees. 

''Turkish coffee cups called -fincan- are a necessity for serving Turkish coffee. These new cups were the half size of a typical tea cup of that time. It could hold 2-3 fl. oz. / 60-90 ml of liquid. They have a height of 2-2.5 in. / 5-6 cm. They were accompanied by saucers (“coffee stands”) which had a diameter of 4-4.5 in. / 10-12 cm.''

For one fincan, you put 2 teaspoons of the coffee. 
if you want to have low-sugar coffee: you need half of the cube sugar.
if you want to have medium-sugar coffee: you need 1 cube sugar.
if you want more sugary: you need max 2 cube sugar. 
or you don't even need to add sugar at all, it's your choice.

but as an advise; the more sugar, the less taste of the coffee.

So this is how it goes:

1. take your cezve and put 2 teaspoons of coffee. if you are 2 person then you'll need 4 teaspoons of coffee.

2. if you want, add your sugar. Max 2 sugar is also enough for 2 person if you want to drink sugary. 

3. then  take your -fincan- and fill with water (not milk). if you are 2 person so you need 2 fincans of water in the -cezve-.

4. before taking -cezve- to the heat, you should mix all together and for 35 seconds. 

5. take the cezve with the mixture to the low heat and continiue to stir. make sure you stir nice and slow. stir until it bubble ups.

6. then take the coffee from

The whole idea of me looking for a Turkish Coffee recipe was to see a recipe from scratch,with the individual ingredients, spices, that make it "Turkish". This is a real disappointment. I'm right where I started: Having to go out and buy a prepackaged mix.

I bought a bag of Turkish coffee, but wasn't sure how to make it, so I looked up this recipe.  I made this with cashew milk instead of regular milk. Otherwise followed the directions, and found it a bit too strong and rich.  Also, I need two servings and it only came out to half a cup. I'm not sure if Turkish coffee supposed to be drunk in smaller cups. If so, then it makes sense.

this is definitely more mild than traditional Turkish coffee. I used a cezve. This is a pleasant drink for those who want a creamy coffee.
