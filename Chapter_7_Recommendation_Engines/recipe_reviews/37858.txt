This was really easy to make. I added extra white chocolate in the pastry, because I love white chocolate. Will definatly make again. This would be perfect for any party.

At first, I was saying, "I don't know about this one..." - but this ended up being great!  My husband ate it for dessert, breakfast, snack... I'm not a big white choc fan, but the pears made this great.  We really liked it!

Very yummy, quick and easy!  I made mine as individual triangles rather than one big one. Only took about 15mins to bake. Served them hot with vanilla ice-cream. Can't wait to try with different fillings such as banana, milk chocolate & toasted almonds, yum!

Very simple, but surprisingly good.  The cranberries add zest to this dish, which is mellow and subtle.  Yummy.
