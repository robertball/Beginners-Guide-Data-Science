I would definitely classify this as a sauce, and not a salad, but that doesn't diminish the ease and relative tastiness of the recipe. (Almost like a mild tzatziki sauce.) It was extremely good, but also a bit runny, so I'm glad that I went w/ Greek yogurt, as well as using a third less than the amount of yogurt called for in the recipe. It couldn't have worked out better that the night I prepared this, I was also making "Baked Falafel" from here, and the 2 together were divine! (I also toasted the walnuts b4 stirring them in.) I think next time around, I'll go lighter yet on the yogurt, add a squirt of lemon and perhaps some minced garlic. (My husband smeared his Zucchini onto warm flat-bread b4 adding sliced olives, crumbled Feta and the Falafel, and I heard lots of "mmmms" a la "What About Bob?" in b/t bites.) My toddler, on the other hand, flung a handful of "kookini" across the table b/c she's going through an anti-green-food-phase. Keep the great recipes coming, Asli!

I love this salad. It is also deliscious with dill chopped in it. U can also melt a teaspoon of butter and olive oil and add some paprika to that to make it red and spoon it on the salad. Yummy either way.

I made this at Thanksgiving. I liked it but my guest did not seem to care for it.

i make this all the time.  I serve it as a side dish with heavy bar-b-que or take it as a dip with crusty bread, pretzel chips or carrots. 
I add a tablespoon of crushed garlic and a dash or two of hot sauce just to let it stand on its own.
Always better the next day.
