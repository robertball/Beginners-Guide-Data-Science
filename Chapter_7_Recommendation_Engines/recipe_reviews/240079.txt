The title says it all, almost. It's rich and spicy....but it left out creamy and smooth. Yum! This is a great combo of texture and flavour. It is hard to believe you can say so much about hot chocolate but it really is that complex. It is very spicy. I couldn't taste the vanilla. I suggest decreasing the amount of cayenne and tasting it; you can always add more before it is served. I used almond milk and coconut cream instead of dairy. I didn't have mint but think the submitter is right and a touch of mint may very well be a plus here. That will be for the next time! :-) Thank you ScratchCook for this delicious recipe.

It IS rich and creamy, but the cinnamon and cayenne overpower it.
