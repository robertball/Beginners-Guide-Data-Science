Very tasty, quick, and easy recipe. Kids and adults love it. I made only one change, I used dry taco seasoning mix instead of chili powder. Only suggestion I have is I made batches with both regular cupcake pans and mini cupcake pans. The regular sized ones came out slightly harder to eat, and stuck heavily to the cupcake wrappers I used. This was quite irritating when trying to eat them. Also, there was almost too much cornbread to hot dog ratio.(cut each dog into 1/4 pieces)  On the other hand, the smaller Mini ones I made with my nonstick mini pan, I cooked a few minutes less, in these I used 1/8 of a hotdog pieces, and it worked perfect. They were so yummy, everyone ate these and left the big ones after tasting both. Perfect hotdog-corn mixture ratio. They weren't as floppy as the big ones.Fun to eat! I will definitely make these again, but from now on will use the mini cupcake pans only.

I cheated and used a Jiffy Mix instead but with same results.  The kids went crazy for these!  All were gone as soon as they left the oven!  Great lunch for little ones to help make....my son called these Corny Puppies!

These are a definate make again.  DH and I both ate a bunch of them, but the toddler just picked out the hot dog and ate that.  So the spices make these suitable for the more "refined" palettes in the household, hahaha.  The dipping sauce got bettr and better the longer it sat in the fridge (I think it took sometime for the flavors to meld), so my suggestion would be to make the sauce 1/2 a day before the muffins and let it sit (covered) in the fridge until serving time.

Easy and better than corndogs. I added about 1/2 tsp. more garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper. This was easily made vegetarian with veggie dogs and soymilk.

These are fantastic! I ended up being out of chili powder so in desperation I subbed an equal amt of chili seasoning mix. I also chopped the dogs up & mixed them right into the batter when I added the cheese. I got 12 perfect, reg size muffins out of it. They were delish!! I opted not to make the sauce but may make some today to try w/the leftovers we'll be having for lunch. Thank you!

I imagine these just wern't our taste, although I thought they would be.  I didn't care for the dipping sauce at all, and I love dips.  I think it was the mayo.  Maybe use all sour cream?  Honestly, if my kids loved them, I would have rated them highter (being a kid pleaser recipe and all) but they love regular corn muffins but only ate half of one of these and picked out the hot dog and left the rest of the muffin.  Sorry I coudn't be more positive--we just did not like them.

Love, Love, LOVE THESE!  I made a batch (mine made 48 mini muffins) took half to a party where they were gobbled up, and sent half (a few at a time) with my son's lunch to school.  This was a great shake up from sandwiches and even just plain hot dogs.  My husband loves these for a midnight snack as well.  These are the BEST!!  Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

I truly have a special place in my heart for corndogs.  These little guys are FANTASTIC!!  I used 3 veggie hotdogs for 24 mini muffins.  I cut each hotdog into 8 equal pieces.  Using a small cookie scoop, I put a full scoop into each well of my silicone mini muffin pan, placed a hotdog chunk into each one, and topped them off with about 1 teaspoon of batter.  I added 2 teaspoons of sugar to the dipping sauce, decreased the taco seasoning to 1 tablespoon, and added 1 tablespoon of milk to make it taste like Taco Bell's Santa Fe sauce (the sauce they so cruelly discontinued!).  SO GOOD!!!

this was exceptionally yummy - I cut the hot dogs up small so my toddler could eat it too and I increased the oil to 1/4 cup - I had to increase the baking time about 5 minutes but the end result was yummy - nothing stuck to the paper liner - I would mix the sauce first before starting on everything else though, really yummy

Made these for my teens for lunch. I used a mini muffin pan to make them bite size, so my hot dog pieces were smaller. Serving size was 12 muffins.  The did eat them but no comment as to whether they liked them or not (they usually tell me how good a recipe is).  I suspect they will stick to eating their hot dogs with coney sauce and shredded cheese (or plain old ketchup)!!

This recipe receives a 5-star rating because:  1 - DH doesn't like hot dogs, 2 - DH doesn't like corn bread, 3 - DH really liked this recipe!  Go figure.
The Fiesta Dipping Sauce is very good with this recipe, make sure you do make it.   You could always make with your favorite corn bread recipe and it would turn out great.  I started with the 4 hot dogs and had to use a fifth as I had corn bread left.  My mini's must be smaller because I got 42 muffins with this recipe.  Thank Athena for sharing your recipe.

Great little muffins, even for grab-n-go breakfast! They were better as mini-muffins. I diced the hot dogs, and although I left out the chili powder and cumin for my short people, I did keep the garlic powder for flavor. The kids loved too that these had cheese.

I love these! I didn't know what to expect becauce there's another corn bread recipe that I really love that I was tempted to use - but I did follow this recipe exact (well except for using 1/2c whole wheat flour and 1/2c all purpose). These were really tasty - my son and I really loved them. DH not so much but he's never liked corn dogs so that's not really about this recipe. The mini muffin pan I have is apparently really mini lol I got 48 cute little pop-in-your-mouth muffins but we liked the size so I will make this again :)

I cut the sugar a bit because I don't like sweet and meat. Also, I switched the hot dog for sausages (like cheddarwurst), cut the spices just a little and took them to school for breakfast. They were gone before even half the faculty arrived.My kids liked the plain corn dogs but my son wanted less cheese in the muffin, my daugher wanted less taco flavor. Guess I'll be making several versions! Also thinking this makes a nice replacement for sandwiches in boring school lunches when a microwave would be available to warm them.  Also thinking about replacing the cheddar with american to cut the oil/grease in the batter.

I used a "flax egg" instead of a regular egg since I was out (1 T ground flax seed & 1 T water) and less sugar than called for (~1//4 cup).  It still turned out great and my kids liked them.  I found the mini muffin tins took 10 minutes to cook and the regular muffin tins took almost 15.  We just dipped ours in ketchup.

I cheated and used Jiffy Corn Muffin mix as well,  2 boxes. I also made this a southwest type mix by adding 2 packages of taco seasoning to the mix.  For the hot dogs I used the smoked little weenies and cut them in half.  I poured the batter in mini muffin pans.  I took them to our football tailgate this past week-end, and everybody raved about them.  I came back empy handed too!

This was really good. But the kids did not like it. I added green onions, lemon and cilantro to the dipping sauce. I will make these again and maybe put some onion in the muffin mix. I would also add less sugar.

I like the idea of the recipe, but didn't care for the cornbread recipe here and would use one I've made and liked instead next time. I used a few more hots dogs to evenly distribute them, left out the cheese as I served these with a baked macaroni & cheese and skipped the dipping sauce (we used ketchup and mustard). As a stand-alone snack, I'd use the cheese. I do think you could change the seasoning to something less fiesta-y (like garlic powder, onion powder, some kind of green herb) to make it kid-friendly taste-wise. I made them into heaped mini-muffins (I got 24) and can say I probably ate most of them to myself ;)

This was a fun recipe to try! I made it by following the recipe - the only alteration I made was that I chopped up some of the hot dogs and scattered them throughout the batter - I also used full-size muffin tins. The dipping sauce was a great addition too!

What an excellent way to use up some unwanted hot dogs.  I made these into 12 regular muffins, chopped the hotdogs into pieces and used pepperjack cheese for some added kick.  I doubled the cheese, but also used a course grate.  Hubby liked them topped with mustard and I thought they were great plain.

VERY good! Use mini-muffin pan as suggested by others. Does not need the sugar called for, makes a sweeter treat than desired. Added Cayenne, lots of it!

I have done this myself but using Jiffy corn muffin mix (my personal fave).  I love the dipping sauce, I usually just mix ketchup and mustard together, but this sauce is much more  fun!

I made this exactly according to recipe SANS dipping sauce, only because we were having these with chili. As is, darn tasty. Not my favorite cornbread recipe but it totally mimics fair corndogs, but with a little kick. It works together. I used pure beef hotdogs. Totally awesome and went great with chili. If they're this good with chili, I can only imagine what they'll be like with the dipping sauce. I'm going to make this again for Superbowl weekend with the sauce as mini-muffins. Thanks for the new fave, Athena!

I especially didn't like the chili powder or cumin in the muffins. I didn't taste the cheese, so maybe it would be better left out (less calories.)  I made them with homemade baked beans and coleslaw. I would'nt make them again.

Loved these...with a salad they made a great lunch!!!  I also cut up the hot dogs in small pieces and added more cheese.  For the sauce, I mixed 8 oz container of sour cream with 1 cup of mayo and the taco seasoning I recipe from this site.  The remaining sauce was used for salad dressing.

These were fun and very tasty!  Loved the kick of the spices in the corn muffin.  I did cut the hot dogs into smaller chunks and put a couple of pieces into each muffin.  The dipping sauce went perfectly.  Thanks Athena!

I probably messed this one up...but I got confused with this and another recipe...I used the Jiffy mix, added alot of cheddar cheese and two cans of green chilies...the rest of the spices and baked.  They were really good....I guess I really didn't use this recipe, just liked the idea.

These are okay...not something we would want on a regular basis.  Rated 3 and 1/2 to 4 stars because these are inoffensive and tasty enough...and...just okay.  I like another reviewer's idea of making these into mini-muffins--might make a neat and different hors d'hoeuvre for a BBQ or informal get together.

I made these for breakfast. I substituted corn oil, cheddar cheese and chopped back bacon for the last three muffin ingredients, since that's what I had. Everyone in my family really enjoyed these and they were easy to make. Thank you for a lovely savoury muffin recipe - they are so hard to find!

These were really good.  I didn't change anything but I didn't make the fiesta dipping sauce because I didn't have any sour cream on hand although I want to try them with it. I only had two problems with these first I ran out of batter the last 3 were quite small. Second they were still not cooked after 10 to 12 mins. I ended up cooking them for about 15 to 18 mins.  My 9 year old loved them but didn't care for them dough part in ketchup so she took them apart and dipped the hot dog in the ketchup.

ok so i used this as a jumping point and i used a cornbread recipe which i think went perfectly. i chopped my hotdogs really small so you got a bite of hotdog and a bite of bread. i made a small thing of the fiesta dipping sauce and one of honey mustard and my kids had them as a snack before bed and my son had some for lunch for school today. thank you for the recipe. ( i know i changed it but it is a GOOD idea.)

I give these a five, but I have to say if you don't like cornbread don't make them, my husband and child were not as excited about them as me.  My hubby only like the hotdog and my daughter only liked the cornbread part!

I didn't make the sauce and I made some muffins with a large piece of hot dog and others with small pieces cut up in them... They had mixed reviews only because some in our house don't like cornbread.

Oddly enough, these were really good.  Didn't make the sauce or have the cumin.  I was unsure about the cheese, so I only put it in half the batter.  Silly me, everything is better with cheese in it!

These were alright, but my kids barely touched them.  They love corn dogs too.  I guess I'll just keep buying the frozen state fair ones they love.  Too bad because it's such a cute idea.

I made these for supper one day, they were quite good. I used a whole pack of hotdogs, and chopped them up smaller and threw them in. The Fiesta Dip is AWESOME! I added some shredded montery jack cheese to it, and heated it in the microwave for about 4 mins stirring after each minute, and it went very well. I am using the leftover fiesta dip with jalapeno poppers, and it is FANTASTIC!!!! GREAT sauce...

I thought these were ok, but my husband, the corn dog lover, really enjoyed them minus the fiesta dipping sauce. If you want to save on calories, leave out the cheese. I couldn't taste it in them.

These were fun and easy to make.  Made them for my grandsons 2nd birthday party.  I made mini ones and I cheated and made a corn bread recipe that I always use and just added the hot dogs.  The dipping sauce was good too.  They were a hit because they were easy for the little kids to pick up and walk around while they munched and played games.  Would definately make them again.  Next time I will take the time and make them from scratch according to the recipe.  I don't usually alter the recipe when I make it the first time but I had to make so many that simplicity was a must!!!!  Give them a try, you will like them alot!!!!!

I only had 3 hot dogs thawed and with those cut into little pieces the amount of hot dog was too much to get the muffins out in one piece.  The flavor was okay- the kids ate them, but wanted seconds of the hot dogs without the muffins.

These were great! I made them for my kids lunches.  This recipe made the muffins from scratch (no mix required) which was a plus for me.  I made these as mini muffins and left out the chili powder, cumin and garlic.  I did not use the sauce at all.  The corn muffin baked up light, sweet and with gentle corn flavor.  They were a hit with both preschoolers.

These were really good! I used cajun seasoning instead of chili powder and I also forgot the cheese (again), but they were still very good. I doubled the batch, good thing too, my kids had 3 each! The sauce is great too and could be used for a lot of different things. Thanks for a great recipe! I will make this again and try not to forget the cheese! LOL

I would give this recipe 5 stars...my husband and I loved it. However, my kids didn't like the spiciness of the muffins. Instead, they tore them apart looking for the hot dogs. We used veggie dogs in place of the regular hot dogs. I didn't even bother with the sauce. It was nice change from the same old stuff.

This recipe could have been better.  First, either the recipe was off or my ingredients were.  I followed the recipe exactly and was only able to make one tray of 12 muffins with the batter and I only had a couple of hot dog pieces left over.  The cornbread was tasty, but I felt like there was way too much cornbread for the amount of hot dog in the middle.  My husband ended up peeling half the cornbread off to get to the hot dog.  If I were to make this recipe again, I would use as big of a piece of hot dog as I could fit in the muffin well, and I would probably lay the hot dog piece sideways to fill more of the muffin.  I probably won't bother to make again because there just wasn't enough "corn dog" in these corn muffins.

. Pretty good, but no magic.  True, I didn't make the sauce.  'Only change to muffins was reducing the cumin to 3/4t.  I couldn't detect much southwestern, if any; which, I suppose, was fine, but it surprised me.  The cheese wasn't evident either.  I wonder if topping on the muffins before baking would be better.  A hit of mustard may be a good addition; chopped jalapenos/onions.  Twelve fullsize muffins.  Oh, decreased sugar to 1/4c & it wasn't too much or too little.  I'm thinking one more doggie, too.  Four hot dogs probably means a half pound, but OM wieners come ten per package - so five would be a half pound.  I'm weird about numbers sometimes.  I know.  ;)

Very nice. I made them as mini muffins. The cornbread, with about 2/3 the sugar, was excellent. They were good with hotdogs but would be even better with something a bit spicier. They would also be good vegetarian mini muffins with some jalapeno and corn or some other filling. I didn’t make the sauce.

the recipe was not quite enough to fill 24 regular muffin tins. When I make it again I will definitely make maybe 18 and cut the hotdogs pieces smaller so there's more per muffin. I did not try the sauce since these will be packed as kids lunches. They taste great though and I really love the slightly spicy taste. I think with slight modifications these will be 5 star.

Really great recipe...thank you.  I did make a few changes as I didn't have the cheese so I omitted it but  I am sure they would have been even better with the cheese.  I am also GF so instead of flour I used 1/2 cup Arnels GF flour and 1/2 cup Cassava flour.  I also used taco seasoning as another rater suggested.

Super yummy and great lunch idea for kids!  I used Jiffy mix in place of cornmeal because it was all I had on hand.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe, cooking the muffins an additional 2-3 minutes. The batter only made 14 muffins for me.  Next time I will cut the hot dogs up into small pieces and mix throughout the batter.

So yummy!  The spice was mild enough for my kids, and they thought they were fantastic.  I used a mini-muffin pan as well (they baked up in 7 minutes). I stuck lollipop sticks from the craft store in them per my 6 yr old request, "to make them like a real corn dog".  I didn't make the sauce, as the kiddos just wanted to dip it in ketchup.  Definitely going in circulation.  Thanks for the lovely recipe!

WOW! I thought my kids would love these for an easy, quick after school snack... But only made the sauce for my husband. Now I'm thinking there won't be any left by the time the kids get off the bus! I only adjusted the amount of chili powder to half of what was called for and these are SO DELICIOUS!

Did these in mini form for my kids. They seemed to like them. They didn't really care for the sauce, (I liked the sauce)  they used honey mustard to dip them in. I thought they were a cute idea and a nice finger food. Would be nice for a large crowd at a get together. I think next time I will add a bit of honey though. Thanks!

Great lunch food for kids!  My 4 year old loved them!  I was a little concerned about the chili powder being too spicy, but it was perfectly seasoned for kids.

We make these in a mini-muffin pan.  The perfect hot dog/bread ratio for us is 1/8 of a normal sized hot dog.  The batter fits perfectly into 36 mini muffins. The only change we make is to double the cheese. The sauce is good - however if you let it sit over night it becomes great! My husband eats these cold the next day.

These would be much better if the hot dogs were cut into little chunks, instead of one big chunk in the muffin.  I thought my kids would really like them, but they just picked out the hot dog chunks.  A really cute idea though...

Really good recipe, made a few changes; less sugar, more "spicy" spices, and used the mini muffin pans, 1/8 hot dog ratio like other suggested.  All in all a really good change up for hot dogs.  Didn't try the sauce because I don't like taco seasoning.

Great idea!  I cut out the cumin because I just don't like it.  Dipping sauce was so-so.  I dipped mine in good ol' ketchup.

I made regular sized AND mini muffins and preferred the mini ones over the larger ones, the proportion seemed better.  After I made them, I wondered if I could have added the rest of the taco seasoning (what I didn't use in the dipping sauce) into the muffin batter.  May try that next time!

I made these half of the batter with the spices and half without.  I thought my kids would like them without the spices.  I thought they were just ok and my kids and husband hardly ate them at all.  Sorry.

These are pretty good! I used vegetable oil(because I had no canola) and I used mozzarella(because I had no monterey jack). Half of my kids liked them and the others just dug through to get the hot dog, so I probably will not make them again. I would make the cornbread muffins again without the hot dogs and serve it with homemade beanie weanies. Thanks for sharing!

These are easy, quick, and very good.  I did put two pieces of hot dog into each muffin.  It did, however, overflow a few of the muffins, so although I will probably do that again, I will make a few more muffins to balance it out.  I really liked the dipping sauce, too.  Didn't think I would.  Bf and I both liked it, and it's better than frying corn dogs.  Thanks.

These were ok. My kids picked the hot dogs out of the cornbread and just at them. I liked the sauce, just not with the corn dog muffins.

I made these for the kids in my daycare for lunch.  I served it with raw veggies to dip with.  Most of the kids weren't thrilled with the dipping sauce, but they all liked the muffins.  Thanks for a fun lunch recipe.
