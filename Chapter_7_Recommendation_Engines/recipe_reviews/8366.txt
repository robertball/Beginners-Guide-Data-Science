This recipe had lots of *****, but the experienced cooks gave mixed reviews, so I gave it a try.  Didn't change a thing.  I have baked and decorated lots of cakes, and although this icing was pretty, and white/white, it was totally tasteless.  I even added 2x the vanilla after making it, but it didn't help.  I would probably add some butter extract next time. Also, the recipe calls for salt, but doesn't include it in the directions.  Piped well. Not a bad recipe if you're looking for that grocery-store no-taste icing.  Texture is there. I'll stick to buttercream. I find it is way more flavorful and if you add 3Tbls. of Karo clear syrup to a buttercream, it spreads and smoothes better than this.

p.s. Don't overmix the last addition of powdered suger in this recipe or it tends to curdle the satin-smooth consistency a bit. Do just like it says, only mix til blended.

This is the recipe I have been searching for!!  Excellent! I have tried at least 20 other "white icing" recipes-and this one has the best taste, consistency, etc.  If you are looking for that "bakery cake" icing for birthday cakes, middle of sandwich cookies, cupcakes, etc.--try this one!  Couple of notes--Did taste a little "almondy" first time I made it, so reduced the almond to 1/8th tsp. Be SURE to beat it the first time for at least the 5 minutes--that will get rid of the "shortening" feel.  It's a huge recipe-if you aren't frosting and decorating a large sheet cake-you may want to half it.  Also--if you don't want it to taste like a "buttercream" icing (which I did not)--do NOT use any butter or butter flavored shortenings.  Thanks SOOO much Cherie!!

I had been looking for the perfect "wedding cake" icing, and this is it! I've made 3 practice cakes using this icing and they've gone over well! I used water from the water cooler instead of tap water, and the first mixing only took 5 minutes. The second time I made this icing, I added 2 Tablespoons cocoa powder to half the batch for a chocolate cake, and it was great. My family has requested to not have a "Bought" cake anymore! Thank YOU for this recipe!

I wanted my cake to taste as close to a bakery cake as possible and this icing did the trick.  It was delicious!  Several people asked me where I bought my cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  It also make LOTS of icing.  I was able to ice a 9x13 cake and about 30 cupcakes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I changed the servings to 8 and it was more than enough for frosting a 9X13 cake. The measurements appeared to be just right as it was the perfect consistency. I did not have to add any additional water to it. I did use all vanilla extract instead of vanilla and almond. It was DELICIOUS!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I've used this recipe for a lot of different baked goods requiring icing.  It has a fantastic texture, is very easy to work with, spreads out to a satiny smoothness with an offset spatula dipped in hot water, and can be very versatile with a few drops of your favorite extract added.  Definitely a keeper!

Ideally I'd rate this 4-1/2 stars, just short of perfect because it's just a little too sweet for me. Generally for this amount of fat, whether it's shortening or butter, I prefer a ratio of 1 cup butter or shortening to four cups of powdered sugar.  This recipe was TWICE that amount of sugar, but I wanted to give it a try. I used an egg white for part of the water called for and eliminated the almond extract just as a matter of preference.  I kept adding the sugar but finally stopped at 7-1/2 cups, thinking "enough is enough."  This frosting is beautiful, fluffy and elegant white and even tho' just a wee bit sweet for my tastes (others, like my husband, would disagree on that point) it tasted pretty darn good too - but keep in mind that when I make any shortening type frosting I use hi-ratio shortening, which makes an incredible difference in taste, mouth feel, consistency and stability.  This is frosting I'd be quite confident to use again, even tho' it's a little different than I'm used to.

Great frosting!  The almond extract really sets this frosting apart from the others that I have tried.  It worked great for piping and making roses.  I will always use this recipe from now on, love it!

Hands down the best textured and most stable frosting of all the different recipes I've tried from this site! I tried it once as it is written and it was great if you need a pure white and professional tasting icing like for an actual wedding cake.  The second time I made a chocolate version.  I replaced half of the shortening with margarine, eliminated the extracts, and added 1/4 cup cocoa powder.  That was even better!  The margarine made it creamier and more spreadable than the original.  Both were great though and I feel my search is over!

best recipe for cake icing i've made yet. Used real vanilla extract. Very easy to make, tastes great, looks great, and decorates perfectly whether it's for piping rosettes, or even for making roses. Just add more milk for the softer decorations like the piped leaf, and less for the rose.Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it is what I was looking for!UPDATE-------------It's now been a few years, and I have tried many other icing recipes, and this one is still my favorite. I now use half butter and half shortening and it works perfect! I think that I'll try it with all butter the next time I need it for a serious fancy cake!

I have made this icing two times now, the first was okay, the second time was perfect!!!  The big difference? The brand of powdered sugar!  The 'okay' batch was store brand and had way too much corn starch; it was all I could taste. With 8 cups of the stuff in this recipe, picking the right powdered sugar is important.

I bake so often that I often rely on other people's reviews of the things I make to help me determine if I should make things again.  My husband's mother and step-mother both said this was the best frosting they'd ever had.  That's a good enough reason for me to use this forever.

This is my favorite cake icing.  It's the very sweet icing used in bakeries.  My original recipe called for 1/2 t almond and 1 1/4 t white vanilla.  If you like almond flavoring, you might want to make the adjustment.  Also, beat 10  min on high , then 5 min on low.  This makes a LOT of icing, but it keeps for 6-8 weeks in an airtight container at room temperature.

Loved it.  I didn't have almond flavoring, so only used vanilla.  But also used butter instead of shortening.  It was perfect and had just the right flavor.

EXCELLENT RECIPE! I cut this in 1/2 all the time to ice a sheet cake (at home).  Anyone that thinks it's greasy-you did not follow instructions.  By beating the shortening, water, flavoring and 1/2 sugar, u are incorporating the water/moisture into the shortening, which lightens it.  If you don't follow that step (yes, mixing about 10 min prior to adding the rest of the sugar) it will leave a film/be heavy tasting.  I did substitute the following:  1/2 C shortening, 1/2 C unsalted butter to my version.  FANTASTIC flavor!  Have a cake baking right now my daughter made just to have the frosting again!

I love this recipe. I have used it a lot and will continue to use it. It gets very still and makes wonderful roses, but do not leave it uncovered for very long. I drape a wet hand towel over what I am not using to keep it moist. It is very sweet, obviously, but I have had no complaints with it. And it is very important that you mix it for the time it says. I, also, suggest investing in a Kitchenaid mixer if you will be using this recipe very much because it does get very hard to mix as you add the powdered sugar.

You know those people who don't follow the recipe but then they review it anyway & maybe give it reduced ratings? Yeah. That's me right now. 

So I was looking for a sugary somewhat stiff frosting/icing for a cake for my boyfriends b-day and this seemed good. BUT a bunch of people were complaining about flavor, consistency & etc. 

So I made the following changes. Color wasn't vital to us since it wasn't for a white wedding. So I used TRIPLE the amount of vanilla extract it called for & put that amount in the 1/2 measuring cup before I put the water in to avoid too much moisture. I used ALL butter & less salt since my butter was salted.  My last change was to omit the almond extract. I used C&H sugar, btw.

I followed the vague instructions. Saying to "mix" but not at what setting & saying to mix for 5-10 minutes but not saying what consistency you're looking for is bad recipe writing, in my opinion. I used what felt like "logic" when deciding how to approach those two vague elements. I started out slow & creamed my butter first, then added the wet and then the dry ingredients and upped the speed to about 4 on my KitchenAid mixer. After several minutes the color got MUCH lighter (butter and dark vanilla extract made it come out a pale ivory in the end, color-wise) & MUCH more volume & fluff to it. I add the other half of powdered sugar but w/ powdered sugar "cups" are flexible so I kind of eyeballed it.

My results: Very flavorful, pale, tasty frosting. He loved it!!

This icing was great, two things though, I think it is important to add a cup of confectioner's sugar at a time to guage how much you want, I was able to ice a whole two layer 9-inch cake with 5 1/3 cup sugar. Also, I subbed shortening with 1/2 crisco butter flavored shortening and 1/2 cup butter.   Lastly, I think it needs a few hours to sit, I don't know if maybe this is because of my alterations to the recipe or what but the icing wasn't that great until I let it sit awhile. A few hours after I made it it was perfect and the taste wasnt as sweet as it was at first.   I also switched the almond/vanilla around and did 1 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and just 1/4 vanilla as my cake had a vanilla flavor already.

Absolutely fantastic!  I tried it both with regular shortening, and the butter flavored.  The regular gave it that perfect, bakery white icing taste that I was looking for, but the buttercream flavor of the butter one was to die for.  I've used this recipe three times so far, once with my old (dying) mixer, and ten minutes was perfect for beating, but now, with my new (supercharged) mixer, 5 is more than enough.  After that, it starts getting a little grainy.  That, though, is the fault of my mixer.  And a spatula dipped in water and smoothed over the iced cake made it nice and pretty and smooth.

Did not turn out good at all, the texture was unappealing, even after I mixed it for 10 mins, and I did not care for the taste. I'm sorry, but I won't make this again.

Wow! Wow! Wow! This recipe is fantastic! I try to make everything homemade and I never could find a recipe for an icing that I liked. Everthing was too sweet, too runny or tasted like pure sugar. And then... I found this one. I didn't have shortening on hand (nor have any idea what it is) so I used butter instead. What a beautiful buttercream icing!!!! The only advice I can give is refrigerate the cake and just chill the icing for a little while. For me, it prevented alot of crumbling. Thank you so much. I have hope for recipes to come knowing that I have a a@# kicking (I can't find a phrase that is remotely close to how I feel) icing to put on top. THANK-YOU!!!

I make professional cakes and this is my recipe for them and people act like I've made something sooooo wonderful.  The only thing I do different is I use clear butter flavoring instead of almond flavoring.  It gives it a better buttercream flavoring.

I usually have Creme Bouquet Flavoring on hand, and use that instead of almond or clear vanilla extract.  It gives it a super-creamy taste, and kills some of the sweetness!  But I have used this recipe for YEARS, and it is THE BEST!  Works great for any type of cake decorating.

I really like the taste of this icing, it does taste professional. Here's where I made changes, I didn't add the salt and where it calls for additional water I added a little pineapple juice at a time to get the desired taste. After I let the icing set in the fridge I put it on a pineapple cake mix (not pineapple upside down mix). It tasted like the cakes this cake baker we know used to make for our family. Also I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because I tried food coloring on some of the icing and it didn't mix well no matter how long it was mixed. Also I agree with the others that say it does taste greasy while preparing, but once it's set in the fridge, been put on the cake and your eating, it will not feel or taste that way.

Excellent! Taste was much better than the basic butter cream recipe given at cake class. The texture was great for decorating, though I did also use it to frost the cake with a little extra water. This will definitely be my staple recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

I followed the ingredients and instructions exactly and got a stiff consistency icing. It does not taste like a wedding cake icing like those delicious wedding cakes that you ate at a wedding. It taste very sweet and plain. Disappointing! It is a good icing if you like a very sweet icing for a birthday cake or other occasion. Not for wedding. It was hard for us to finish our cakes because we are not used to very, very sweet food. (we do not eat sugary food very much, so that was why we were not used to the sweetness of the icing.)

YUM!  I cut the recipe in 1/2, swapped the almond extract for Coconut Extract.  I think it's great.  I used it to frost a chocolate pound cake, and the coconut was subtle, but pleasant.  I'll make it again, a full batch for a 2 layer round cake.

Best homemade icing!! This recipe's consistency is very easily changed with adding more confectioner's sugar. However, I found it challenging to spread onto the sides of the cake. The flavor is amazing and all of my friends loved it!

This was perfect! I needed a thick, rich frosting for a friend who is allergic to dairy. I used butter flavored crisco and almond milk instead of water. Thanks for the instructions to mix for 5-10 mins. The consistancy was perfect!

I am making my third wedding cake right now, and OMG! I wish I had found this recipe for the first two...  spreads so smooth, it's wonderful!  I used butter flavoring instead of vanilla as I did not have clear vanilla and I wanted the frosting to stay snow white, tastes great!!

This recipe was great for a wedding cake I did.  Had great flavor at first but tended to loose it after being refigerated but it stood up to the heat (over 95 degrees).  All of the quests thought that it was bakery made.

This icing is nice and white, but I wouldn't use it to ice a wedding cake.  It hold shape well, and the piping worked well, but I wasn't happy with how it spread.  But most importantly, the taste was not pleasant.  Just another greasy icing that coats the roof of your mouth and no one enjoys eating.

The recipe doesn't tell you what speed to "mix" it on so I'm not sure mine came out right/wrong.  The icing was okay; a little to sweet even for my taste and I usually like sweet icing.  I will try it again with a few changes to see if I get the same results.  Thanks for sharing though...

This was the perfect frosting! I did not have butter and some other ingredients a lot of the other frosting recipes called for. I left out the almond extract, used real vanilla extract and it came out sweet and tasty. My daughter did over mix it the second time so it was as "fluffy" as it could have been. But a keeper for sure. No reason to ever buy store bought cakes or frosting ever again.

Good! I only used vanilla just because that's the flavor I needed to ice my cupcakes, but I'll definitely try this again using the almond too. I'd never made an icing using water before; turned out pretty well. Thanks!

Followed the recipe as written. I found this icing very time consuming and had diffuculty getting it to the right consistency. Very disappointed in the results. Could not get the icing smooth on my cake, and I have done that before easily with other frostings. Tasted all right, but not great.  I will be a bit embarrassed by the way my cake looks, but I don'[t have time to redo it. Will never use again and don't recommend it.

recipe was great, totally worked for me. i took the advice of most reviews (about it needing more flavour) swapped the amount of almond and vanilla - more almond less vanilla and it turned out well. used it for  my son's backyardigans cake and needed different colours/consistency and the recipe worked for switching consistency.  i'm giving it a great rating because it was 1. delicious 2. easy to work with and 3. EASY!!! thanks for sharing this recipe!

The icing was stiff enough that it didn't slide off the sides of the three dimensional baseball cake I made for my nephew's birthday.  The sweetness, however was overpowering.  I tasted the icing before I added the second bag of confectioner's suger and it was really good.  I wish I'd stopped there actually.  I ended up having to add a good deal of milk to thin it out.  So, it decorates well but the suger will make your teeth hurt.  Three and a half stars.

Excellent frosting.  Half the recipe made just enough to frost the top of a 9x13" cake - without piping any decorations.  Light and fluffy, not too sweet, a big hit with everyone here.

This icing was excellent. Turned out perfectly white and worked well for decorating. The only thing I changed was to substitute butter flavoring for the almond extract, otherwise it is perfect as-is!

I did not like this icing at all. I followed the directions exactly, mixing very little after adding the remaining powdered sugar. The only additional mixing I did was when I stirred in some color. The icing was not stable at all and started separating, and it did not taste good either. Even my 9 and 5 year old boys, who love icing, did not eat this. At the time, it was easier for me to check online than hunting through my recipes for my usual icing, but from now on I will take the time!

not sure if it was me or not...I'm usually a pretty good cook...but one cup of shortening..with 8 cups of powder sugar...was a bad bad combo...first...way way way toooo sweet, second..too crumbly, I ended throwing the whole thing out, as all I could taste was powdered sugar. and instead I took 1 cup of butter flavor shortening, 1 cup of regular shortening, 6cups of powdered sugar, eyeballed some almond extract, and about 6oz of whipping cream...yummoooo :) and it set beautifully. but this was just too sweet, and hardened to much.

Be careful to use only 2 Tablespoons water if using margarine. Add additional water drop by drop. Margarine has a lot of water in it. We made the recipe for a wedding cake and used margarine. The result was an icing the consistency of pancake batter. We had to add another 6 cups of sugar to thicken it. It would be better to add only a little water if using margarine and then adding additional water only a drop at a time.

Excellent. I was a little skeptical because I have always used butter over shortening but after making this I have finally realized the difference between buttercream and white frosting. I definitely prefer the latter. This was a wonderful recipe that went over well with all ages of the family. We made Valentine Cupcakes (tint of pink of course) and they were superb! Thank you!

The first time I made this it was with vegetable shortening...wasn't happy with the result. Then, I gave it another try with butter shortening and it was perfect. Exactly the icing we were looking for.

This turned out great! I love the flavor that the almond extract gives it.  The one thing I can't seem to get rid of in my homemade frostings are the "crunchiness" that the sugar gives it.  Somehow, I can't seem to get my sugar to ever blend in perfectly for that "smooth" taste.  If anyone has any secrets for that smooth texture, please share!

This is very good, and was fairly easy to work with. I used butter flavor Crisco sticks for the shortening.  Do make sure you beat it the 5-10 minutes that it calls for. Had a tad bit of shortening taste is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Everyone thought it was very ood though.

The almond taste is really strong.  So, if you don't like almonds, don't use that much extract.

I rated this as it's written because I was looking for a more classic almond wedding cake frosting and this just tasted like sugar. After I added nearly a Tbs (possibly more) almond extract it became a 6-star at least.  My husband practically swooned over it.  I can see it being easily modified to other flavors. It's a keeper

I made this for valentines day cup cakes. I used the servings table and typed in 10 servings. Didn't turn out well. Was thick runny even after adding more sugar than called for. Not a good taste either.

loved this. just made this tonight for cupcakes for my daughter's 6th bday and her kindergarten class! The only alteration is I did 1/2 cup shortening, and 1/2 cup of butter, and I increased the almond extract to 1/2 tsp.   Super awesome Icing!! You have to try it!

This icing tasted horrible.  The roof of my mouth was greasy.  Could not use it.  I do not understand the reviews that say it isn't greasy.  It had beautiful texture, consistency and spreadability though, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars.

Amazing! Halved the recipe for two 10 inch round pans. I used butter instead of shortening and it turned out great. I did add a bit extra vanilla since i had no almond extract at hand but it would have been fine without  it.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe for good.

Tried this today...was skeptical about adding half the sugar and mixing for 5-10 minutes, but it made for a very fluffy frosting, but still spreadable.  Sometimes this type icing is hard to spread, but this was great.  I think it has a very good flavor and not greasy.  Looks great on my son's 2-layer birthday cake with plenty to use for piping (used chocolate filling, did not use the wedding cake between layers)!

This tastes like what you get when you order a cake from the grocery store, which is what I was looking for. I followed the recipe and added a little water to thin it out because it was pretty thick.

This is a great basic white frosting recipe. It holds up well without refridgeration. It is also good for dairy/egg free allergies and vegetarians. I usually half the recipe for one batch of cupcakes or 9X13 cake.

Very tasty!  I had to use butter flavor Crisco since it was all I had on hand and it still tasted great, although it was no longer a "white" icing, which was OK since I was coloring the icing anyway.  Will definitely use again!

I found this recipe delightful.  I also found that if you add a little touch of butter flavor it gives it that "buttercreme" taste.  Only had to add a smidgeon of water to make spreadable.  My only confusion was the time for mixing.  between 5-10 minutes was pretty vague, but I went with 8 and had the best consistancy.  Yummy!

This was great, but I'd leave out the almond extract. It made it taste almost medicinal. The recipe was great without it. Perfect without it.

This is the best recipe for icing that I have ever used. MAY WANT TO TRY USING BUTTER CRISCO STICKS INSTEAD OF JUST PLAIN SHORTENING. Thanks for the recipe.

I am so sorry to whomever made up this recipe, but I am glad I tested it before making it for my son's wedding cake! I took all the suggestions, creamed shortening with butter over 15 minutes; VERY greasy & awful tasting!

Finally I have my perfect frosting recipe!!  The only changes I made was:  I used 2 tsp. of Wilton's clear imitation vanilla and left out the almond flavoring, as we don't particularly like almond flavoring.  I also added 1 tsp of fine salt instead of 1/2 tsp (I used canning salt because it's the finest I had).  It turned out to have the particular taste I was looking for.  My family loved it.  It will be the only recipe I use from now on!

Halved the recipe,because I was only frosting 2doz cupcakes. This left my mouth with a nasty greasy feeling and I used high quality shortening and beat for the recommended time. I couldn't serve this to people. Scraped off what I had done and ended up using a classic buttercream instead. Search continues for a white frosting.

Awesome recipe! The best I have tried. The only thing I did was cut the powdered sugar down to 6 cups instead of 8. I wanted a icing not as sweet so I cut it down. And I omitted the almond extract because I wanted the vanilla flavor. But other than that it is perfect! It is pure white and perfect for a wedding cake. Will be using it more often!

I liked this a lot! Very simple. I used milk instead of water, and you need to add a bit more milk than water, perhaps another tablespoon or two (a note on the milk - I knew I had room in the fridge for all the cupcakes I made, but if yours are staying room temp, keep with the water. In theory, shortening, water, powdered sugar, and extract are all fine to keep at room temperature). I also put a touch more vanilla in and used butter-flavored shortening, which gave it a bit more flavor than if you used normal (though I'm sure that'd be good too!). Otherwise, didn't change anything. Delicious!

This icing ruined my cake and I had to buy a cake to save the party. This does not have the texture or the look of a wedding cake. I made this recipe for my daughters birthday. The taste was good, but I couldn't get the icing to do what I wanted. I followed the directions to the letter. After a few minutes it just started breaking down and sliding. I added more sugar to stiffen it, but that didn't work. I even refrigerated it to work with it. Total waste of my supplies. Will not use this icing again!!!!

Tried this for the first time while making my neices wedding cake, not bad a bit sweet, and I cut the powdered sugar by a 1/4 of a cup to make it easier to spread. We will see what the wedding guests think...............:)

This was a very good white icing recipe. I didn't try it with the cocoa powder. It was REALLY sweet though, just as the other reviews have said. I don't know that the milk really did much, but that's just me.

I loved this recipe, especially the addition of the almond extract which you don't find often. I didn't use the electric mixer but was able hand mix it to a nice, shiny consistency. I added a couple of tablespoons less water and couple of tablespoons of corn syrup for shine at the very end of mixing. Looked good, was easy to use to decorate a giant cookie for my daughters and tasted great!

I have been making a similar icing since I was young - I divide the 1 cup shortening and use 1/2 c shortening and 1/2  c butter and substitute milk for water - this icing is so popular people request it and my kids eat it with a spoon - I make all our family cakes with this - great recipe

Made this icing and it received raves all around.  I used it on "David's Yellow Cake" found on this site.    Changes I made to the recipe were: 1/2 salted butter-1/2 plain crisco 2 teaspoons real vanilla 1/2 cup milk 6 cups(2 boxes)confectioners sugar  I tasted it, and it didn't leave any greasy coating in my mouth like others claimed.  Will definitely use this again as it holds up well in the heat.

I made this icing for my daughters birthday cake and we loved it!!  I don't bake and this was my first attempt at baking a cake, which I also got a recipe for from this site, and icing it from "scratch".  I love bakery sweet cakes and that is exactly what I got from this icing.  I will defiently use this recipe again!  I followed the directions exactly, where it states to beat it for 5-10 minutes, I went with 10.

I used this to top white almond wedding cake cupcakes (found on this website).  At first, I thought it was going to be too sweet as I was taste-testing it from the bowl.  Once I put it on the cupcake, it was perfect.  I doubled the almond extract and added one more tablespoon of water.  I did not think it left a greasy feel on the roof of my mouth like others described.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks!

What an excellent frosting! I followed the recipe exactly, didn't need to add any extra water. I have this on vanilla cupcakes and the cookies and cream cake on this site. It most definitely tastes like bakery frosting to my mother and me.

Yup, tastes just like a wedding cake. I went up to a 1/2 tsp of almond extract simply because I love that flavor.

lot's of compliments on the icing.  I used it to ice my wedding cake.  It was a good consistency for spreading and decorating.  Used a pastry knife dipped in water to get the smooth flawless appearence.  My husband says it's his favorite frosting ever!

I thought the almond was a little strong. But that could just be because of other foods I ate today. I can't imagine anyone calling this tasteless thought. It has plenty flavor.

I was looking for a recipe that will crust beautifully and this was it and with the use of Viva paper towel I got a very nice and smooth cake the only problem that I had was the greasy after taste in my mouth but for the rest it was wonderfull will make this again.

Quick and easy to make - i added red food coloring to make it pink. Spreads nicely and evenly over the cake. I left out the salt.

This icing was incredible!  It was definitely "professional" in taste and appearance.  It was very helpful to use an electric mixer since it needed to be mixed for so long in the beginning.  I used the frosting for a 4-tiered red velvet cake, and it was magnificent.  Next time, I am going to try piping it and using it for roses.  Thanks for sharing such a terrific recipe.  It was perfect!!

LOVE this recipe! It was a little too sweet at first, so I added 1/8 tsp almond extract and it was great (not necessary if you like very sweet frosting).  It's a little thick but if you wet the spatula to smooth it on, it makes for a great professional-looking finish.  People didn't believe that I made the cake myself!

This was great. Don't worry if you don't have clear vanilla extract. There is so much sugar that it still comes out snow white. I made several days before and refrigerated before use and also froze cake after icing and it thawed great. Just make sure to follow instructions excatly. However, make sure that none of your guests will be allergic to tree nuts.  This is not buttercreame... if you are looking for that taste, use that recipe. But, if you need something white, this is it!!!!

This icing is very good. It tastes like traditional icing that you would find on cakes bought from a store bakery. I actually added more vanilla and almond to my icing because I like the 'amaretto' flavor to stand out a little.

This was good.  I halved it using the tool on this site but put too much almond.  I didn't have an 1/8 so I used 2 1/4 which I knew was wrong.  I will try again with less almond.

I had an unpleasant experience with this icing! I made it for a friend’s birthday cake, carefully following the recipe, and was appalled because it came sliding off! Also somewhat embarrassed because I didn’t have time or inclination to re-do! So I kept patching it up with a spatula.... And it kept melting right back off!

Even guests with advanced taste buds have said it tastes just like wedding cake frosting.  It's a bit solid so I wouldn't recommend putting it on a crumbly cake....best for a dense cake.  It makes alot....I plan to make again but cut recipe in half :)  The shortening yields a nice white frosting :)

Omg this icing was horrible. I followed the directions exactly. The shortening and almond extract gave it a weird flavor and texture. It almost felt like I was eating a lump of grease with some sugar and nasty almond extract mixed in. I was going to take it to thanks giving for cupcakes I made. Thank God I ran out of time to frost them, and forgot the bowl of frosting in fridge.  I will not be making this again. It was just plain nasty.

I made this for a meal our church was catering.  1 recipe for a white cake and 1 recipe for a chocolate cake.  I added 1/4 c. cocoa for the chocolate cake as well as a little more water.  Everyone thought it was very good.  I think the extra water and beating longer makes it fluffier.  Will definitely use it again.

Piped stiff yet creamy and nice on my cupcakes. Flavor is great. Sweet but to be expected- it's icing. My kids loved it. I does develop a crust on it rather quickly. That's the only thing I don't like but I suppose that is normal.

This recipe was so easy, I used the exact instructions.  Didn't have a sifter so I didn't even use "sifted" powdered sugar, lol.  Still turned out great and I added food coloring (purple) cause it was just for a everyday you're special kinda cake.  Will definitely make this again, tastes great!

This is my go to icing. I like the consistency better when I mix just the water and shortening for five or so minutes. Then I add the first batch of powdered sugar and mix for a minute or so more. Comes out very creamy. Also, I like the almond taste so I tend to add more.

I agree with others that the recipe as written is a bit bland.  I made this as icing for a lemon cake so I added lemon zest and juice and it was great (about 1 tbsp zest and 1/8 cup juice).  For a layer cake, which I made this for, make the whole recipe if you want to cover all surfaces.  I also recommend as others have to use the "best" sugar possible with the least amount of corn starch.  Definitely wait to put the second batch of sugar in and I mixed it with a spoon to start and then about 10-15 second with the mixer.

I didn't change a thing.  It was perfect, taste just like the frosting I love on bakery cakes.  This the recipe I will be using for the rest of my life.  I will no longer buy bakery cakes, paying 30.00 and up.  I paired it with the Wedding Almond Cake recipe.  Slam dunk in my family.  I made it Thanksgiving, it was a hit!  Thanks for this recipe.

tasted good but thin. I had to add more sugar to thicken it and it was still to thin to pipe out. Flavor yummy though. Next time I might add more butter or cut back on the water

Sooo sweet and makes tons!  Made half batch.    Used half butter and half crisco.(BUTTER FLAVOR works best).  After whipping 10 min i liked the flavor much better.  Added the rest of the sugar and did not care for the sweetness, too stiff and no longer had any almond flavor. Make again using 3 cups p.s. and 1 tsp almond. Half batch covered dozen cupcakes and 13x9 amply with left overs.

This is like mine except I add 1 tablespoon of meringue powder, 1 teaspoon butter flavoring, and only 1/4 teaspoon salt. I use a full 2 lb bag powdered sugar and all Crisco. Love it.

This recipe was just ok.  It works fine for what it is - plain frosting.  For some reason after I made this I couldn't help but notice a strong taste of shortening.  This recipe is arguably a bit better than what I could get in the store can, but I think what I'm searching for is more of a buttercream.  I will keep searching.

I used this icing recipe for my own wedding. I didn't have almond extract so I used double vanilla. The Cake turned out wonderful, and I used it with the recipe for Heavenly Wedding Cake (recipe found on Allrecipes). Everyone really liked the cake! The recipe was easy and delicious.

This is an awesome recipe! I did 8 servings for a 9x13 cake. It was the perfect amount. I also tweaked it a little. I wanted a little bit stronger taste of the vanilla/almond. So i did 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of almond. It turned out fantastic-will definitely use this recipe again!!!

Everyone raves about this icing when I use it on our cakes or cupcakes. It is the perfect white icing for wedding cakes, yet if you substitute butter-flavored icing for the shortening, you get a fantastic buttercream flavor.  It does tend to separate if color is added, but I only notice the separation in the piping bags, not on the cake.  It does make a lot of icing, but stores well in the refrigerator.  Thanks for sharing! :)

I followed this recipe to the tee and it came out perfectly! I had made devil foods cake and didn't have any frosting so decided to give this one a try. I'm a beginner cook so this was easy enough for me to make. Tasted just as good as the cake at the store!

This recipes was fabulous. I would not recommend cutting this recipe down as another reviewer suggested. I iced a 9x13 and about 4 cupcakes and I didn't really have enough icing to put it on quite as thick as I would have like. I received lots of compliments on this icing.

I like this recipe.  I colored the frosting with liquid color, and piped it onto my daughter's birthday cake.  It worked really well.

The second time I made this frosting, I cut the recipe by quite a bit, and added a teaspoon of peppermint extract.  Perfect on chocolate cake!!

It piped well. Not very tasty though. You could really taste the powdered sugar. The texture when you're beating it for 10 minutes was wonderful but then when I added the additional powdered sugar it turned abit "blah". I used it to frost cupcakes that were made with the "Most Popular Cake in America" recipe from this site. I thought it tasted OK but my 7 year old said they were terrible tasting and he loves sweets. I did follow the instructions EXCEPT I did not have Almond extract. So maybe that one ingredient ruined it.

i used this recipe about a week ago. this tastes just like the bakery icing. Its really easy to apply and work with. u cant go wrong with this icing. first time i tried it came out perfect. its set up in the room really good. i was even in a hot kitchen. i found a trick to when u want to make it really smooth. take a pan with some luke warm water in it. then dip ur utencil in it and touch up rough spots it smooths right out.      GREAT ICING FOR ANY CAKE ANY TIME> thank you for ur time to put this on the internet      LOFA T.n.

Loved this!  I changed the serving size to 4 and it was just right for icing my daughters 9x13 bithday cake!  I don't like super thick icing though, so just adjust to your own taste.
