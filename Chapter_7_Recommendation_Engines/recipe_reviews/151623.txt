I really like this one.  After I made it a couple times I started chopping up red and yellow bell peppers and throwing them in as well.  It's a great addition.

I loved this, it has a nice flavor and was easy.  I used more cheese and chili powder than called for though.  I didn't measure, I just tossed in a nice looking amount.  Our biggest complaint was that the sauce tasted good, but biting into the chicken was bland.  I made it again but let the chicken marinade overnight in Italian dressing before cooking.  It was a lot better.  This dish also tastes just as good (if not better) reheated the next day.

I changed this recipe a little bit...added Mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, fresh chopped garlic, broccoli, and some chopped red onion. I put it in the slow cooker and later put on top of pasta. Worked Great!

This was very tastey and so so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and 3 year old loved it.  I mixed in some frozen mixed veggies and it was great.  This is a keeper.

This was a tasty, easy and quick dinner.  It's definitely not gourmet, but it did the job!

This was great! I cooked my chicken with garlic powder just to give it a little something extra. Next time I might add a little more chili powder to spice it up a bit but all in all this is a great dish!!

My husband adored this dish.  I sauteed onions and chopped garlic instead of using garlic powder.  I will be making this again.

This was great! My kids and boyfriend really liked it. My boyfriend took left overs to work and had a couple of guys try it and they said it was a hit. I did change one thing, I guess its about personal preferance. I use 1 cup of milk instead of 1/2 a cup b/c I like a creamier and thinner sauce. I found the 1/2 cup of milk made the sauce a little to thick. Thanks for a great tasting fast dish.

I thought this recipe was delicious as did the rest of my family.  I added some brocolli in it, and that turned out great.  This recipe is a keeper!

I'm sorry, we just didn't really care for this one. We ate it only because it was all we had to eat, but I wouldn't make it again.

I thought this was very good, but I did make some changes (mostly due to what I had on hand).  1. when cooking the chicken, I added some chopped onion 2. I used regular Cream of Mushroom soup and added some dry basil and parsley for the herbs 3. for the pasta, I used Wacky Mac 4. I served more Parmesan cheese at the table...yum

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that next time I want to tweak is some more.  I think it would be good to either marinate the chicken or rub garlic powder on it.  It was really good, though, and was great left over.
