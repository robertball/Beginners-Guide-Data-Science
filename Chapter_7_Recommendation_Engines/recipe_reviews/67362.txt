I used a can of Sierra Mist instead of water, and added the juice from the can of pineapple rings, as well. It came out PERFECT. Check the photos I posted! :)

I really liked this recipe. I only used 1 cup of water instead of 2 and I used a small roasting pan. I used half of the drippings to use for the glaze. It takes some time for the drippings to get thick so don't get discouraged it will thicken up.

As other reviewers have stated, the  syrup mixture needs to be thickened with cornstarch, otherwise it just runs off the ham. And next time I'll reduce the water to only 1 cup.  Due to the volume of water (combined with the ham juices and the syrup runoff), the ham was literally boiling in deep liquid toward the end when I went to baste it. I won't use cloves anymore since they only flavored the ham immediately surrounding each one, and they are bitter when accidently bitten into (they are small and easy to overlook). Flavor was good, would probably be much better with a thickened syrup which remains on the ham instead of running off.

I ended up with a good ham considering how much I drifted from the original directions.  I preped up the ham as directed (pineapple and cloves) and poured half the maple syrup, brown sugar, honey and butter mixture over the ham, but ended up basting it with the pan juices which was the water and suryp mix and only basted a few times at that.  Next time I will follow directions verbatum and even though I got plenty of compliments today I'm sure I'll get a lot more then.

I had to modify this recipe, I had no pineapple and only crushed cloves. I mixed the crushed cloves into the glaze and it worked wonderfully. That ham was a big hit! I look forward to using this recipe again.

This was a big Fathers Day hit at our dinner table.  I really wanted to try this glaze but all I had to work with was a large bone-in half-ham.  So I baked it following the package directions, then the last hour is when I added pineapple rings, cherries and cloves.  It made a beautiful presentation and was just as tasty as it looked pretty.  I arranged ham slices on a pretty platter, poured some of the glaze over the meat, and garnished the edges with the pineapple and cherries.  Very nice.

I just made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out great.  I love the flavor the marinade gives to the ham.  I will definitely make this again.    Note - use a precooked, boneless ham for this recipe.

I look at all the reviews and the only thing different from the recipe I did was use the pineapple juice instead of the water and some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Came out great thanks for the sharing the recipe!!!

As sujested by someone else, you should thicken sauce. Otherwise you are basting all the time with watery baste, also didn't want to waste the expensive maple syrup!!

THIS RECIPE WAS THE BIGGEST HIT EVER!!! I DID MAKE MINOR CHANGES THOUGH. I DID NOT ADD CLOVES TO IT B/C I WOULD LOOSE THEM IN THE HAM AND ACCIDENTLY EAT THEM. GROSS!! Any ways i bought an already cut with bone in spiraled ham. I personally think its so much better to use if you want the best taste/flavor. I made the sauce like the recipe said but i added another cup of mapled syrup and i also got liguid brown sugar and added the whole bottle to it. Anyways i mixed it all up with the other ingriedients this recipe calls for and heated it on the stove. Then (THIS IS A BIG ONE)instead of constinitley basting the ham i cut the ham up into its already thin spiral slices. I lay out the ham in a foil pan and add the sauce to it, so that it covers the ham completley, so its just sitting in this sauce. I add the pineapples and cover it with aluminom foil. I then put it in the oven on low heat about 300 degrees and i let it cook for about 4-6 hrs. This way the flavor is unbelievable and i promise you ever time i make this for big holiday parties, its a huge!!! hit. Try it and you will see!!!

A great recipe. Ham was tender and juicy. The sauce was a great compliment to the ham. Added a little cornstarch to thicken, and when drizzled on the ham, it was the icing on the cake!

My ham would have turned out better if I had made slices that criss cross over the top of the ham so that while basting, the mixture from the stove would have baked within the ham more.  I only forked the top, which is why it turned out bland. The skin was the only flavorful part of the ham.

Tastes great! Used half the water and skipped the cloves though (personal taste).  My family loved the maple flavour.  Also, we used a spiral-cut bone-in ham because it tastes more natural and less rubbery.

This recipe has good potential but needs tweaking. Don't get me wrong the ham still turned out great but I was expecting a thicker sauce, lost all that maple syrup in the water. I should have read the other reviews closer. No need to put 2 cups of water in, and the sauce needed to be a LOT of thickener.

I made this ham for Christmas last year and plan on making it today as well. The compliments are out the roof. My only substitute was using a smoked bone-in ham. This gives it a real gourmet look and the flavour is enhanced by keeping the bones intact.

This is by far a favorite recipe.  I made this for the family, and they have requested it for the holidays instead of the ham we normally get from the Honey-Baked Ham Company!  When this recipe dethroned the "king" of hams, I knew this would be a recipe handed down to the next generation.

This is a great recipe although it was not clear regarding the water and syrup from can of pineapples. I believe you do NOT add the water to the syrup mixture that you heat, water just goes at bottom of pan to steam and keep the ham moist. Can of pineapple syrup I wasn't sure so added 1/2 the can to the heated syrup mixture. I also added a tsp of liquid smoke to the syrup mixture.  Turned out great!! Thanks again for the recipe!

I did this ham last year for Thanksgiving.  I took out the cloves cause I don't care for them. I used Sprite instead of water and added the juice from the pineapple to the sauce.  I also used a 12Lb bone in ham (had to adjust the amount of ingredients).  The ham was sweet all the way into the bone.  I had read some reviews that said not to rebaste with the sauce after it had been mixed with the Sprite, but I did and the ham was PERFECT!

Made for Christmas dinner, and it was fabulous very nice flavor. however, I only gave it four stars because I altered the ingredients..I only used one cup of water and used the extra pineapple juice, and I did not use cloves! the sauce does need to be thickened with cornstarch as well but a very tasty ham none the less! :)

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I have to give it four stars though because I didn't do exactly like the recipe said. I used half the amount of ham and didn't use pineapple just because I didn't have any.  Also, instead of the whole cloves I just srinkled on some ground cloves before baking and it was perfect mixed in with the sauce.  I halved the sauce and water.  Super yummy.  The sauce was awesome, loved the maple flavoring.  I will definitely do this again.  Thanks.

Ham came out EXCELLENT!!!  I didn't have whole cloves, so I mixed ground cloves in with some pineapple juice from the can and injected it into the ham.

This is an excellent recipe.  While fine as it is, I changed it up a little bit to suit personal taste and ingredients on hand.  I had to skip the cloves since I had none, but cloves are not my favourite taste anyway.  I brushed maple syrup on my ham about 2 hours ahead of time and let it set.  I also added a few drops of liquid smoke to both the water my ham was baked in as well as the stove top sauce, to give it a hint of hickory which we love in this house.  I baked it about an hour earlier on a lower heat.  I made a double batch of the sauce since we LOVE sauce on our whipped potatoes, which we always have with ham =o).  I also thickened with a little cornstarch.

Great base recipe, easily altered to suit your personal taste!

This is a simple but very good way to make a holiday ham. My mother, who's been making hams for 30+ years, actually asked me for the recipe after I served this! I think that cooking it in water makes it a little more juicy than it would be otherwise.

I am considering trying with slow cooker and leaving the entire day for work....not sure if this recipe will work though, I will not be basting ham throughout the day.

I did really enjoy this recipe however did follow others with reduced water to 1 cup to avoid "boiling" the ham. Awesome recipe and the kids all loved it!

I made ham and pineapple kabobs on the grill tonight and i altered this recipe a little bit to use as a marinade. I made the portions a half size larger and added the juices from a 15oz can of pineapple and didn't use any water. Also I forgot to buy cloves so I didn't use those either. After heating up all the ingredients together I marinaded ham chunks and pineapple in it for about 3 hours and grilled them on skewers. AMAZING!

Excellent!  I had to use ground cloves (instead of whole), light corn syrup (instead of honey), and baked a much smaller version but it turned out wonderful and very tasty.  I will definitely add this to my holiday recipe list!

I served this for Thanksgiving and will again this Christmas! I dont eat meat but I did take a nibble to test it and it was juicy and delish! I did not use cloves because I dont like that flavor and I pricked the ham and did not use the drippings as gravy, instead, I used a gravy my mom makes using those very ingrediants. It was the first big dinner I prepared, first ham and your recipe made it a positive one :) Thanks

This is a keeper and the recipe I will use for our Easter ham dinner.  I have made this a few times, it is so flavorful and the ham is so moist.  I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing. very good.

I used sierra mist instead of the water like most of the other reviews had suggested to, also I made it with a 10 lb bone in shank and left the cloves and pineapple out. my family loves it and now I have to cook one for every family get together.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I did make a few modifications to it.  I always make sure to score or poke holes throughout the ham to better absorb the maple mix.  I decrease the water to 1 cup in the pan with the ham.  I make the maple baste as directed, but add 1/4 cup of water & add 1-2 shots of Jack Daniels to the mix (depending on the size of the ham).  It has great flavor & comes out perfect!

Working with ingredients that I had available,  I added 1/2 tsp of ground cloves to the syrup mixture instead of putting whole cloves on the ham. I also substituted the pineapple rings with chunks, which I also added to the syrup mixture, and used the pineapple juice from the can instead of the water. I simmered the mixture for quite a while after baking but it didn't thicken much. Still it was delicious when served over cut ham slices.

Used this recipe for a last-minute glaze since a different recipe wasn’t working out for us. While we were unable to follow the full recipe (basting throughout bake time with the butter, maple, sugar, honey mixture) the end result was very good! I can only imagine how the flavor would be with the full baste time. Looking forward to trying this recipe again just as written!

Delicious.  I did add about 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs to the sauce and didn't add much water.  The crumbs helped keep the sauce on the ham and gives it a nice delicious crust.  Thank you for the recipe.

Big hit with my crowd.  I cooked 3 hams for two family meals and we barely had any for leftovers!  I tried cooking covered one day and uncovered another.  I found the uncovered version was more juicy, as you would expect.

I used the pineapple syrup and not the water and ground clove that ran off into the sauce. It is a little runny but works well. Cooked it for Christmas Eve dinner and we we will enjoy leftovers.
