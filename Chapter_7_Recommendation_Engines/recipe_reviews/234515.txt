This was good but it was missing something. Not sure what, maybe sour cream in the sauce? The only thing I did different was to cut the corn tortillas into triangles.

This is my recipe--obviously it's not going to win any awards for healthy eating but it was  good. I think I had thirds!

This recipe has too many steps making it unnecessarily lengthy - does the chicken really need to be cooked 3 times? 
I roasted the chilies on the gas burner. 
I don't know about you, but my pie plate is not nearly enough to hold 2 1/2 cups of broth, let alone the other ingredients. Did two layers and that was about all it could hold.
Like the other reviewers, it was a little too spicy (but I'm guessing hat really depends on the peppers, which can be unpredictable) and that the 1/2 cup of chicken grease at the end is not really necessary. Shredding the chicken should be in the recipe someplace.  Might make this again with a few tweaks.

I used my cast iron dutch oven for each of the cooking steps. The flavor infusion was perfect. It took a little longer, but it was worth it. I also used Mexican oregano, fire roasted diced tomatoes, colby/jack cheese and the thighs started with skin and bones. I left the chicken thighs on the bone while they cooked, but trimmed away all the skin and fat. I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious! Light and fresh tasting. I used Hatch Chile's from my daughter in laws garden. So good.  I also used shredded chicken breast since that's what I had. It will become a regular dish here. Next time I will add the black beans. There are a lot of variations you can do with this recipe.

This dish was so delicious!! I added sour cream to the cheese layer and it made the sauce extra creamy. The next time I made it I'll probably use shredded chicken.

This is the best Enchilada Pie recipe out there! So good! I couldn't find Hatch Chilis so I used Pablonos instead but still turned out delicious and not too spicy.

Really enjoyed the recipe. I substituted pork stew meat for the chicken, and loved it.

Great recipe. I used the roasted chicken from the market. Cut out a lot of time. And my Hatch Chile's were already seared. Everyone loved it.

When I make this again I will use 2x the Hatch chili sauce.  Rave revues from 3 out of 4 of us.  Used the hot hatch chiles & must admit, it was at the upper limit of my heat index (& I like hot!)

Terrific! I held back from stirring in sour cream, which another poster had suggested adding, and I couldn't have been more pleased. I browned the chicken thighs really well, but was slightly thrown off when I couldn't find instructions for chopping or shredding them, but that certainly didn't require  rocket science to figure out. I cut the tortillas into wedges to scatter about, to make serving with the spoon easier. I suppose the additional broth before baking is to ensure the tortillas have plenty to soak up, without drying out the casserole.  I will definitely make this again.

It was a good base recipe. I did add some corn in with the chicken. Perhaps next time I would add beans  as well, to give it a bit more texture. Also not convinced the 1/2 cup of stock poured over the top is necessary.
