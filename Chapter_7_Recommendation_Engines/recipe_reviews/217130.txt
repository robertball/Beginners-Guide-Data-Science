I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about them.  The recipe made 96 plus I had enough left over to make a full size pie.  I brought the left overs into work and everyone loved them there as well.  Frosting was my favorite part!

Wow!  So good!  These were a big hit at my office Thanksgiving party.  Next time I'll probably half the recipe though, but there definitely will be a next time!

These tarts take some time to make, but it's really fun to do!  And delicious!  I made them for a party, and people thought I had bought them.  I plan to make them again this fall, and it will be part of my annual fall baking from now on!  The frosting went fast for me by using the trick of putting it into a Ziploc bag, cutting off one small corner, and piping it on.  **This recipe does make a LOT.  I did half the recipe, and it made 48 tarts.**

I make these at least once a month. I make them gluten free by substituting rice flour for all purpose flour.

These do take a while to put together, but they are worth it.  At first I thought the flavor was a little lacking, but after they sat for 24 hours in the fridge, the taste came through.  These are perfect to make ahead--especially for a celebration.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This was a great recipe! It took me about 3 hours but it was worth it! I don't think it will take me as long next time. I used a regular muffin tin and it made exactly 3 doz which is a little more reasonable than 96. I did have a ton of extra frosting that I plan to use for cinnamon rolls. My family and friends were very impressed. I think the crust got the most complements because it was so flaky. It just melts in your mouth. Such a fantastic addition to my holiday baking list!

These are lovely and nicely impressive.  Buy yourself one of those wooden tools that is large on one end and small on the other for making the little cups out of the dough.  It worked very well for me.  The frosting on top was delightfully different!

I made these for Thanksgiving and OMG, were they good.  I did not change anything in the recipe.  It does make a lot.  I will make these again for Christmas.

Made these for a harvest themed pot luck at the school where I teach. People were stopping by my classroom and stopping me in the hallway to tell me how delicious they are.  Use a good quality cream cheese.

This was amazing, my first time I have every made tarts before. I was worried of how it was going to turn out. In the end everyone loved them, and the fact that I made 96 was perfect to give to friends and family!! Yummy :)

I've made these tarts a couple of times and everyone absolutely LOVED them!  I've never been asked so many times for a recipe!  They take quite a bit of time and are a little pricy to make, but TOTALLY worth it!

Made this and was underwhelmed.  We are big pumpkin pie lovers and this lacked the pumpkin pie taste I was expecting.  Perhaps should have realized based on the amount of cream cheese in the recipe that it’s a definite cross between a cheesecake and pumpkin pie.  As I’m not a huge cheesecake fan it fell short for me.  The pastry was really easy to work with which was nice - but it was not flaky , just kind of tough for me.

These were every bit a 5-star recipe!  I love the fact they are small enough to bring to work or a function without needing utensils.  The crust was nothing short of divine.  Made them exactly as written.  The marshmallow paired well with the cream cheese in the frosting.  Going to try making them with eggnog filling for Christmas (pre-bake shells) and garnish with nutmeg.  Also going to use a pretty cookie cutter for fluted edges; honestly, they're cute enough as is, but I'm up for the challenge.

These turned out very yummy. A step up from normal pumpkin pie and at a grab and bite size. I didn’t use nuts (my preference). I didn’t have marshmallow creme on hand so added a teaspoon of vanilla to frosting and it came out amazing! I used a cookie cutter on the dough to give pretty scalloped edges.

Enjoyed by all & went fast at the office party.  Since I didn't have very many mini pans, I used  mini paper cups & baked them in a regular size pan.  It worked fine but wasn't as pretty.  The "icing" didn't look whipped at all & made Waaay too much.  Will halve the recipe & quarter the icing next time.

I really wanted to love these.  I did like them but was a bit underwhelmed given the amount of time went into them.  I just felt you could get a very similar result with fewer ingredients and in less time.  with all the cream cheese in them I expected them to be absolutely delectable but just they were merely good.  I also had lots of filling and  topping left over even though I felt I was generous with both so it feels like the amounts are off although I may try them again and make sure I use everything up.  perhaps that will make them as delish as I had it in my head they would be.
