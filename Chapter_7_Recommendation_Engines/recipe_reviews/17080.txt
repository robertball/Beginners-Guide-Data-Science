Good recipie, easy to prepare but not as spicy as we would have liked.  I substituted diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce and will do so again.  Next time I'd follow others' advice and substitute taco sauce for the water, add a small can of green chilies, and a small, finely chopped onion.  I may also use refried beans over each layer of noodles before layering the other ingredients.  Following others' advice, I baked the lasagne in a 350 deg oven for 40 min, covered in aluminum foil to prevent it from drying out.

Great recipe!  I did reduce the tom sauce to 1 15oz can, added a large 17oz jar of med. salsa and left out the water.  With the extra salsa and the hot taco mix, it added great zip.  Also added some taco shredded cheese into it.  Hint-taco chips don't reheat well. Left them off and added fresh ones each time we had it.

This is so good! My husband says this is his new favorite! I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked it in the oven on 350 for 30 minutes covered with foil. I just think microwaving something like this dish would come out soggy. I recommend the oven.

Easy to make - You definitely want to BAKE this recipe at 350 for 30 minutes, and don't leave out the crunched up taco shells!  They're cheap, and really made the dish have some 'pop' besides cheesy taco meat.  Remember you should have 3 layers (I only had two, oops) and also you might want to layer multiple noodles on top of each other, I had a lot left over and it was too late to go back and add them because I had already added my sauce and cheese.)

This was a great recipe. I did 4 noodles in each layer. Used spegghetti sauce along with the taco seasoning. I did not measure the cheese, so I just did a pound of it grated. Instead of chips, I use a box of tacos crushed. I cooked it at 350 in the oven for 40 minutes.

I love this recipe!  I have made it several times, and it always turns out great.  I definitely recommend baking it in the oven as several people have mentioned.  The main other changes I have made are using 2 pounds of ground beef because I wanted it meatier, and using flour tortillas instead of lasagna noodles. The tortillas make it lighter and give it more of a mexican feel than the lasagna noodles, and they don't get soggy like the tortilla chips would if you are planning to make several meals out of it.  I do crush tortilla chips or Doritos over the top when I serve it.

I made this tonight because I had some left over lasagna noodles cooked that I didn't know what to do with. We browned 1lb of hamburger and added a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes with 2 packets of taco seasoning. I put some olive oil on the bottom of my glass pan (9x13) so the noodles wouldn't stick and layered noodles, warm refried beans (made it easier to spread) cheese, meat and tomatoe mixture then more lasagna noodles. It made about 3 layers. We put it in the oven for 25 minutes at 350 then added a layer of cheese then broiled for 3-5 minutes. Added crunched up tortilla chips, diced up mixed baby green salad and sour cream with home made jalepenos on the side... BEYOND AMAZING!!! We have decided that Taco Night is now Taco Lasagna Night!

This was a good dish with some modifications.  I did not have any tomato sause so I substituted one can of diced tomatoes (14.5 ounce) and 8 ounces of mild sasa.  I also added a can of black beans to stretch it out some more. 

The kids I was with did not care for it but the mother was not surprised by this and was happy to have the leftovers.

This was very good! I used ground turkey instead of beef. I loved the taste with the taco seasoning. I feel you could even use 2 packages of taco seasoning for extra flavor. I also used taco mixed cheese instead of Cheddar. I served it with sour cream. Will make again!

I really liked this, but I followed some of the other reviews and baked it for 30 minutes covered and 10 uncovered.  I also used a mexican cheese blend and cut it to about 3 cups and changed the tomato sauce to 2 cans diced tomatoes and left out the water.  I also added sliced olives and green chiles.  I also divided the recipe in half and froze the other half.  It was way better after having been frozen.  I think I cooked it for 1 hour and then 10 minutes uncovered.

I thought this recipe was very good, the family really liked, especially my 6 year old who is a taco fanatic.  I did add some green pepper in between the layers and next time I would use taco sauce instead of tomato sauce to give the lasagna more zip, was a little too mild for our tastes.  Will be making this again.

The only issue here is using plastic wrap in the microwave since that leeches toxins. However Parchment paper or a paper towel is better. For a really fast (but not as healthy way) is using taco meat already prepared and seasoned (in the tubs) and no boil noodles. It was great but while cooking in the microwave I preheated the stove to broil and then added cheese and crushed chips on top...it gave it a baked look and the family love it and had no idea it was mostly a fast microwave meal!

This was pretty good and easy.  Taste's somewhat more like a frito chili pie instead of taco though. Maybe it was the corn chips.  lol.

This recipe rocks! Has been enjoyed by many family and friends. One slight option: if you like spicey foods buy the 'hot' taco seasoning and maybe use 1.5 packs, it brings an extra punch!

My small family loved this dinner.  The only thing I changed is sliced olives and an extra lawyer of chips in the middle, including on the top.  Thank you!!!

This was very good, although 8 cups of cheese sounded like an awful lot so I used 4 cups and it was just fine.  Could use a little more zip and will maybe add some chili powder next time.

Very good basic recipe.  I modified the recipe by adding 3/4 cup of cooked rice to the sauce mixture and adding thin layers of refried beans.  One thing though, be sure to only add the crushed chips to the portion that will be eaten right away.  The chips get stale upon reheating.

5 stars with quite a few changes - otherwise probably only 3 stars.  I make my version of this in my regular rotation - my husband and I love it!  After browning the meat, I mix in a jar of salsa, one small can of tomato sauce, and a packet of taco seasoning.  I then layer a tiny bit of the meat sauce in the bottom of the pan, followed by three cooked lasagna noodles, 1/3 meat mixture, 1 cup taco cheese, and repeat two more times.  On the final layer, I add crushed tortilla chips before placing in the oven.  I usually cook in 350* for 20 minutes, uncovered.  Delicious!

This was so amazing I made this for my fiancé and he loved it as well!! Some changes I made were while the meat was browning I added hot chili flakes, tex  mex spice and a package of hot and spicy taco mix! Next time I will add hot sauce ! Just a couple dots. Or some medium salsa. Some other changes I made was i also bake it for about 20 minutes with cheese on the top and all throughtout the layers and I added green onions for a fantastic taste . I also added a can of black beans !! So good :)

I am giving this only 4 stars because I changed things up a bit.  I try not to do that too often but with this recipe I felt that tomato sauce and water would not lend enough flavor, even with the taco seasoning.  I used 1c of enchilada sauce and 2c tomato sauce and omitted the water.  I made home made taco seasoning from this site and only added about 1T since the enchilada sauce already added spice.  And instead of microwaving it I put it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes and put the chips on top as soon as it came out.  It was delicious and a nice change from traditional lasagna.

My entire family LOVES this recipe! Even my picky 5-year-old, who won't eat "standard" lasagna, loves this! I made it as the recipe states, EXCEPT -- I used no-boil noodles (much easier) and baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes (covered with foil half of the time). LOVE LOVE!

this was soooooo good. I baked mine in the oven with diced tomatoes, green onions, black olives and crunched up cool ranch Doritos on top

I just printed this out today-did not have a clue what to make we wanted taco something-so I followed the recipe and it is in the oven! I don't have crushed taco's so I used crushed nacho doritos instead. Hope it turns out good. It turned out great -my son loved it and my Husband! Thanks AllRecipes.com for dinner tonight!!!
