pretty good, it's a nice and filling snack that gives a decent amount of protein.

I topped with home-made whipped cream instead of caramel and almond slices instead of peanuts.  Delish!

I am a good baker, and typically a sweet is what I bring to the many potlucks here where we live.
I wanted something interesting for Sunday's brunch party, and what a hit! Just the presentation is wonderful.
I didn't put the carmel on because I am not a fan of carmel, and I thought it would be too sweet for a morning dish, so I just piped whipped cream along the sides. 
It was really good.
Make sure you put the almond oil in, it really adds a lot!

I thought this was really good. The mixture of peanut butter and cream cheese was different. I was amazed how easy it was to roll, unroll and then add the filling and re-roll. It didn't fall apart at all!

This was a bit of a challenge as I haven't baked a lot.  The idea of rolling, unrolling, and then re-rolling the cake was a bit intimidating, but it worked perfectly!  This was delicious and very pretty for presentation!

There seems to be an unfortunate imbalance in this recipe – way too much almond extract in the filling, too little pumpkin in the cake.   I was really looking forward to this dessert to finish off our holiday dinner & unhappily, lead the way with less than favorable critiques.     The crunchy peanut butter/cream cheese filling had a pleasant texture & wasn’t overly sweet but I think probably 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract would’ve been plenty.   I don’t know if the peanut butter-almond just overwhelmed the pumpkin flavor of the cake but, as a Lover of anything pumpkin, this was just…eh.  you know??     On the whole, it’s remarkably easy to put together & has a lovely presentation – no caramel topping necessary.  We just used a little whipped cream & nutmeg to accent. I’ll try making it again…when I have more time to “tweak”!!

The Pumpkin Roll was not hit at our Christmas Table this year.  My family and guest all love peanut butter but it just didn't hit the mark.  The roll was too moist and was more of a disappointment for the amount of effort it took in preparing.  I am not sure what could have made it better.

I love this recipe.  I am a novice at cooking and thought this recipe would be complicated, but it wasn't.  The icing tastes great.  Only two suggestions, make two cakes (use up your pumpkin if you got it in a can) to one filling.  MMM MMM good!!!

I reduced the sugar in the cake to 1/8 c powdered sugar and 1/2 cup regular sugar, and this version was teriffic!  I kept the filling the same.  I will make it again!

I like that this recipe is a bit unusual. Very yummy! Will make it again.
