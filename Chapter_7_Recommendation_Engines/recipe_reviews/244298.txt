I added black beans doubled the recipe and made a mess in a 9x13 lol. I would recommend for not doubling 8oz velveeta and 4oz cream cheese. The measurement seemed a little off but I used my knowledge to adapt then and it was amazing. Well definitely make again and again

A few additions of my own like green pepper and onion were great. For cheese I used 100g of Philadelphia Creamy Cheddar and it was tasty. The taco seasoning was a little salty for my taste so I added the sour cream right into the mix and that cut the salt. Topped with green onions just because I had some. A nice one dish meal but not a healthy one therefore the 4 star.

I doubled the recipe using a 15x10 casserole dish and it worked great. Skipped the cream cheese and used a little more Cheeze Whiz and cut back a bit on the olives. Served to a group and they all loved it and it went quickly. Will definitely make again.

"Mmmm..... it's a keeper." That was the wife's assessment after the first taste. I divided ALL ingredients in half and put in a pie pan rather than a larger pan. I also used sweet peppers on half since the wife doesn't care for jalapenos. I also included some chopped onion to the top of the mixture. The finished product was just enough for two of us and a leftover lunch for me. This recipe will be making a regular appearance at our house.

Since I only had canned Mexican corn that was what I used along with a can of black beans and some diced onions that I had in the refrigerator. My husband loved it. Delicious and very easy!

This was different and very good. Mine probably needed to be cooked another 5 minutes (so 30 instead of 25) but that was the only change I would make.

I'm one who loves to do my own thing so I added black beans bell peppers cilantro and used cheddar for the cheese. I also switched the cream cheese for sour cream. I left out olives and jalapenos too. It was very good!! It made a lot so I have some great leftovers!

I didn't add the olives or jalapenos... but everyone loved it. We used the little that was left over on chips like a dip.

Add some taco sauce to it and it is the best meal I have made. Mind you I am a dad who has not cooked much in the last 10 years. Not only did I like it but the kids asked if I could keep making dinner now.

Excellent. Made it for large church group and everyone enjoyed it. Adjusted the servings to 36 and it worked out fine. Followed the recipe except added black beans. Just to make it go a little further. Thank you for a great easy dish!

I substituted corn with peas because of corn sensitivities and switched to ground turkey instead of beef. It was a huge hit! Easy to make and definitely yummy.

We really enjoyed this! Leftovers even better! Followed recipe 93% guessed amount of home made pickled jalapenos black olives (big can not sliced; guessed how many) and amount of cheese. Very good! Will definitely use less corn next time. Also put tots on top and followed directions for them so they would crisp up. Sour cream is a must! Have to say as a Minne-soh-tan I think even my personal tator tot hotdish recipe is a bit too salty and this is a nice way to mix it up. BF approved!

This is an excellent way to use up leftover taco fixings. Very tasty and a nice change from a "normal" tater tot casserole (though I do like those too)

My husband liked this. I like a bit more sophisticated flavors. Kids didn't care for it.
