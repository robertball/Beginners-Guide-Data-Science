thought this was excellent. yummy. did not put in the microwave; rather cooked the chicken in a pan with a little olive oil, at the same time mixed all the sauce ingredients in a bowl. took chicken off the heat JUST before it was done and sliced it then put it back in the pan and poured the sauce over it. let it simmer for a good 1/2 hour - be patient... it WILL thicken. it was not bland at all! you have to let it reduce to concentrate the flavour.

DELICIOUS!  I doctored it up, but then I always do.  Borrowed some tips from previous reviewers.  I threw in some parsley, extra lemon pepper, garlic and 2 cans of mushrooms.  Amazing flavor, and I even used fat-free sour cream.  Tossed it over bowtie pasta and steamed zucchini and dinner was smashing!  Thanks to the submitter and the reviewers!

Very good! It is definitely like chicken stroganoff, as one reviewer suggested, and SO EASY! I've made this recipe 2x - 1st exactly as stated in the recipe, and it was wonderful - it cooks so quickly in the microwave that the chicken stayed nice and moist, and it made a thick, rich sauce! The 2nd time I cooked this on the stovetop & made a few changes, just to mix it up a little bit. I quickly browned the breasts over hi heat 1st, then poured in *ONE QUARTER CUP* of chicken broth & stirred in the wine, parmesan, & fat free sour cream, & a little extra lemon pepper, and reduced heat to a simmer. I left the breasts whole so they would stay nice & moist, and simmered the entire mixture for about 30 mins. I cannot understand why some reviewers stated that the sauce did not thicken - I actually had to add a splash more wine to mine because the sauce was a little too thick. THe only thing I can think of is that they used ALL of the reserved chicken broth, INSTEAD of just 1/4 cup as the ingredient list specifies?? I mean, if you do the math...it's 14 oz. of sr crm and grated cheese, with less than 5 oz. of liquid = a fairly thick sauce. Thanks, Alice, for this good & easy recipe.

This is a good recipe.  I actually made this on the stovetop as opposed to the microwave.  I simmered the chicken in water w/ bouillon for some added flavor, then threw in some seasoned salt, pepper and paprika with the sour cream and parmesan.  I also threw in some peas for color and simmered for about another five minutes.  I totally forgot the white wine and it was still really tasty!  I served this over rice.  This is good for a super fast, super easy, tasty chicken dish.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

This is one of my favorite recipes. Made it for company last week and had to give them the recipe! DO not use the microwave though. I cook the chicken in a skillet or george forman and simmer the sauce on the stovetop. I add whatever veggies are on hand and it's always great!

This was average at best.  Very little flavor and the sauce was too thin.  I baked mine, covered, at 350 for 30 min.  I won't make this again.

This was very easy and very good, but I did not cook this dish in the microwave.  Instead, I cooked the chicken in a skillet and browned it.  I deglazed the pan with the wine, and then added the remaining sauce ingredients and simmered it for about 20 minutes.  I did add 2 cloves of pressed garlic to the sauce to give it extra flavor.  I served it over rice, and my family enjoyed it.  I think that next time, however, I will make more sauce.

This recipe was great.  I did take some suggestions as to add mushrooms and garlic, I also added some onion.  Another suggestion was to cook it in the oven at 350 which I did.  I would definately try this again.

This was a good recipe, but with some additions.  I added quite a bit of spice - oregano, garlic, cayenne.  With those spices, it was really good over egg noodles, and I will make it again.  It probably would be pretty bland without more spices.

This is delicious. A few changes I made are: sauted chicken in skillet with garlic, salt and pepper.  Mixed sauce in separate bowl using rest of ingredients plus 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  Sliced browned chicken diagonally and put in baking dish and covered with sauce and topped with parsley.  Baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Sauce bubbles and thickens.  Served with wild rice and brussel sprouts.  I will definitely make again.

This was really easy and good.  I used a combo of low fat and non fat sour cream and it was still good!  I think it would be great on baked potatoes with steamed vegies.

Delicious!  Every time I make this for company, they ask for the recipe!  I did notice that it tastes better with a sweeter white wine.  Also, I cook it on the stove, not in the microwave, and the sauce always turns out nice and thick and tasty!

This is okay. The sauce never really thickened up and was still runny even after sitting out for a bit. Went fairly well over egg noodles. I wouldn't go out to buy sour cream just to make this, but if we had some that needed to be used I'd make it.

Very good. Except I made it on stove top and added dry chicken gravy mix at the end to thicken it up. Tasty. Would make again.

I liked it, boyfriend liked it okay.  I added garlic, and lemon juice(instead of the lemon pepper), and ground white pepper.  I also added flour to thicken up the sauce.  I cooked it over a stove top instead of in the microwave.  I left the chicken breasts whole as opposed to cutting them into pieces.  I'll definately make it again sometime.  I really enjoy recipes with wine, and recipes with sour cream, so this one was a good one for me.

A definate favourite of mine! The sauce doesn't thicken all that much, but I used less cream and seved it with rice which soaked up the extra juice. Delicious. A real bonus that it's so easy to make!

Made this 1st time without sour cream - pan fried chicken in olive oil & fresh garlic, and then added wine, lemon juice, cheese, the sauce was never thick but it was very good. Second time I followed recipe exactly but didn't like it as much with the sour cream, too rich.

I did this on top of the stove and it was easy but needed something.
I added some cream of chicken with herbs soup which also helped thicken
it, plus peas, and served it over rice.

Very, very good!  I, too, made this on top of the stove instead of in the microwave.  I just browned whole chicken breasts in some olive oil and then followed the ingredients as stated. Simmered in the sour cream sauce, the chicken came out moist, tender and delicious!

Decided to pour the sauce over four chicken breasts and put it in the oven until cooked thoroughly. Next time I might try the stove top method but I thought the oven way worked very nicely. It coated each breast with the sauce. I planned on serving over rice but ended up just eating the breasts out of the pan. The tartness of the lemon pepper and sour cream complement each other very well. Loved the flavor and ease of preparation. Taste the sauce before you pour -- if it doesn't hit you just right, adjust the flavors a bit more by adding more. I added more parmasan cheese as well as lemon pepper. Otherwise I think it could be bland.

We liked this!  It was easy I cooked the whole thing in one skillet.  I did add garlic and some flour to thicken.  Turns out like Chicken Stroganoff.  I thought it was good.  Served with a Ceasar Salad - was a nice compliment.

This was an excellent dish for a picky husband.  I left out the white wine and added extra stock instead.  I also baked it in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes instead of cooking in the microwave.

So, SO good! A few changes. We pan seared the chicken with garlic and olive oil. Then sliced and put in a baking dish. For the sauce we doubled the parm, doubled the chicken broth, and left out the wine. We also used salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and some splashes of lemon juice. Melted that in a sauce pan and poured over the chicken. Cooked in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes and served over noodles. FABULOUS!

I made this for my GF who love love loved it!!! She even asked for the recipe. I also modified the recipe. Browned chicken on stove top, I may try grilling the chicken next time with Laurys seasoning salt. I also made the sauce on the stove top not microwave for me, sorry I just only use it to warm things up. My issue :) Doubled the sauce added mushrooms, onions and peas for color.  Served over bow tie pasta. My sauce actually thickened quite quickly and I had to add more wine, and more wine and more wine:) The wine makes the dish, use a good wine not something you wouldn't serve your guests. I'm really not sure why others have had trouble with the sauce, I highly reccomend this receipe. Thank you so much Alice!

Very easy! I didn't make this in the microwave though. I cooked this in the skillet. I did make extra sauce with it and I put it over noodles. It was kind of a alfredo type sauce. I will make this again.

This started out looking great, but once I put it in the microwave to cook, the extra juices from the chicken thinned the sauce waaay down.  I thought the flavor was excellent though.  I took the advice of some others here and sauteed the chicken pieces in a little butter and minced garlic before adding it to the sauce.  Next time I don't think I'll use the microwave, or else I'll just cook the chicken and the sauce separately and combine on the plate.

The flavor was good but I couldn't get the sauce to thicken up in the microwave.  I was also afraid to over cook the chicken.  Wouldn't try this one again.

This was very bland and in need of some flavor.  My husband who claims to hate sour cream loved this, and ate quit a bit.  I didn't use wine--subsituted it for chicken broth.  I was impressed with how fast & quick it was to make, but more than likely wont be making this one again.

This is very good, I doubled the wine and then added chicken bullion to it instead of chicken broth (cuz I didn't have any)  I added a little more sour cream too.  Made an excellent sauce.  I served it over rice!!  Thanks Alice!!!

Unique.  Good but not excellent.  I don't like the sauce by itself much (i.e. I would not like this mixed in with noodles, or worse, rice) because the wine and sour cream didn't seem to match, in my opinion.  But once put together with the chicken it was fine.  Kinda grew on me as I went.  I did add more salt and lemon pepper because otherwise it seemed a bit dull - a pinch of those just didn't do anything.  I did everything on the stove.  I don't get the point of the microwaving - it's really not faster or easier, probably doesn't thicken as well (tho I didn't try it), and it just dirties another dish since I put everything in the pan I cooked the chicken in.  I also cooked the chicken fully and added to the sauce when it was done just to heat.  A weight on the chicken would be helpful.  I'd also suggest not listing the broth as an ingredient, but simply say in the instructions to reserve 1/4 cup of it - first time I made it I measured out canned chicken broth before I realized.

I'm sorry to have to review this badly, but I did not care for this recipe. I did not care for the taste, and I am a huge fan of sour cream. It just turned out to be a waste of a dinner.

This was really good. I made a few changes...added double the parm and only had a blush wine instead of white and it tasted great. My kids weren't overly thrilled with it but my husband and I liked it. So maybe meant for a more adult pallet. I also served it over agg noodles.

I'm giving this two stars b/c we were able to eat it ... honestly, it should probably just get one ... I did not do it in the microwave, but I used the ingredients listed ... it was beautiful to look at on the plate ... but as far as eating it goes ... it just had a weird taste ...will definitely not be making this again ... thanks anyway!

Cooked on stove, not in microwave.  Went well with the same glass of the wine I added.  Nice over rice pilaf or wild rice.  Sauce did not thicken, but was delicious.  Next time will cook chicken, remove from heat, and cook sauce until thick then add chicken.  Very tasty.

Used this recipe with a few changes.  Took the ideas of one of the reviewers and added basil, garlic and mushrooms and then used ground pepper, salt and vinegar instead of white wine(had none).  Use the vinegar as a 1 to 1 mix with water.  It turned out great.  I agree that the chicken should be cooked in the pan.  Microwaved chicken is too rubbery and lacks color.

This dish far exceeded my expectations!    Like other reviewers on here I did a little altering.   First I coated the chicken breasts with the lemon pepper and pan seared them.   I increased the sour cream to 16 ounces and increased the parm cheese to 1/2 cup.  After chicken breasts were seared from pan I removed them and cut up.   I deglazed the pan with about 1/2 cup chicken broth.  I let the sauce simmer down to thicken up then added chicken pieces back in.  I did not use any salt in this recipe.   Will be making again and again.

All my family and friends loved this recipe! I made a few adjustments: My chicken breasts where HUGE, almost 16oz, so I doubled the sauce part of the recipe. I halved the amount of wine, and for my broth in the sauce I used the reserved broth from cooking the chicken. I browned the chicken seasoned with garlic, lemon pepper and fresh squeezed lemon in a cast iron skillet with garlic browned in a little bacon grease and butter.  After browning I reduced the heat and simmered in it's own juice. I halved the amount of wine in the sauce, used juiced of 1/2 lemon, and 1 1/2 tsp pepper. I also added 1 cup frozen peas and 8 oz fresh diced mushrooms. I sliced the chicken length wise and served it over fettechini ladling the sauce over top. A small hint, though I did read that the sauce would thicken eventually but, mine did not, maybe because I cooked it separately from the chicken. Instead I took very fine metal strainer (or you could use a sifter) and slowly stirred in about 1 tbs flour, or until desired thickness. I like the sauce a little thick for angel hair, Spaghetti, or fettechini noodles or rice and a little thinner over any tubular noodles. For a low calorie alternative, you can use yogurt instead of sour cream with little to no difference in taste. Another plus I discovered the next day when I reheated it is that it does separate when reheated in the microwave like a lot of milk based cream sauces do. A winner all around and is definitely going into my recipe book!

There is no lack of flavor.  If you reduce it, it becomes full of flavor.  That said, I didn't really enjoy that flavor, but my wife liked it.

I tried this, and I was disappointed, but I am not giving up on it.  I will try it again with a few changes.  I did everything exactly as the recipe said, but my sauce never thickened.  I also felt as though the sauce needed more cheese (and I would use shredded Parmesan, not grated), salt, and more color.  I would also add garlic next time.  It seemed to be screaming for garlic.  As far as the sauce thickening, I am not sure how I will handle that.  I might add some flour to the mixture.  Anyway, my hubby and I both like the overall flavor of the dish, we just wanted it to be more robust, and we wanted to sauce to be thicker.

I thought this recipe was great!  I don't normally make recipes that call for wine so this was new for me.  You most definately could taste the wine.  Because of this, my daughter did not like it.  I think the next time I will try with less or no wine.  But, overall num num.  I also did it on the stove because I didn't trust any of my bowls in the microwave for that long.  This will most definately make it to my table many more times!

Excellent recipe. Changes were - we pan fried the chicken instead of using microwave, and omitted the parmesan cheese. Was sweet and tangy and delicious - a keeper for our family!

I made this tonight for dinner with gnocchi.  I did not do it in the microwave.  I browned the flattened chicken breasts on the stove with salt, garlic pepper and garlic powder.  removed the chicken and put it in the baking dish.  Added chicken broth to the pan and deglazed it, added the rest of the ing and heated up.  Poured over the chicken and baked at 350 in the oven for 30 mins.  very good

I didn't really enjoy this.  I wanted to give it a try but I had to hand it over to my boyfriend, who will eat pretty much anything.  I thought it was a little bland, the chicken seemed overcooked and the consistency was too thick.  I won't be making this again.

I liked this.  Of course modified a little.  I cut the chicken into chunks and cooked it with minced garlic, shallots, salt, and pepper.  I nixed the chicken broth as I had none.  Once the chicken was cooked through I added the sr. cream, parm, and white wine and let simmer for about 30 minutes.  I served with penne pasta and a spinach salad.

FANTASTIC! I also cooked mine in a pan. I used the leftover broth to boil some egg noodles. The only down side is that the recipe doesn't make very much. Next time I'll multiply it. The flavor was fantastic!

The kids were happy to eat it without any complaints.  My husband and I thought it was okay, not great.  I probably won't make it again unless the kids ask for it.

I absolutely loved this dish.  It does take about 25 to 30 minutes for the sauce to thicken.  I cooked the chicken with a little olive oil and garlic.  I'm not big on microwave cooking.  Very nice dish.  Thanks

My family enjoyed this pretty well, however I did not microwave it because we are not fans of microwaved food. We only use it to reheat things or popcorn. Thanks.

Eh... kind of boring. I ate it because I was hungry, but will not make it again. The sauce does thicken if you give it enough time to reduce, so be patient for sure.

I don't really like cooking with the microwave for some reason, so I just put the chicken in the pan, poured the sauce over, & baked at 350 for 40 minutes. The sauce did separate- I just plucked out the pieces of chicken & served 'em up. The whole family ate it- even my picky 6 year old. So... I'll try to add some thickener next time.

UPDATE: The leftovers were terrible. I have decided not to make this again and to reduce my rating to one star. Sorry.

This was edible, but barely.  I may try it again, simply because it has potential, but needs some help. First, it was really DRY.  I would double the sauce.  I cooked it on the stove top and the sauce thickened no problem. Also, as others have suggested, I did add more lemon pepper and a little white pepper. But it still needs something else. My husband seemed to like it. I served it with vermicelli and broccoli, but it still was just okay. I am not sure what else to do besides doubling the sauce. Maybe add some cream of mushroom/chicken?

I made this in the microwave and it was really quick and easy.  I did add fresh garlic and extra lemon pepper after reading the reviews.  My husband liked it, but my kids wouldn't touch it.  I thought it was a little bland.  I will definately add more seasonings if I make it again.

This dish was very wine tasting. I decided to toss it onto noodles, which made it better. It was good and I will make it again and maybe use less wine.

It was a little bland at first, but tasted better after sitting in the refridgerator overnight.  I used all chicken broth instead of wine, and added about a spoonful of chopped garlic, as well.  It might be good with cayenne instead of lemon pepper.

Great flavor--and so easy to make!  I added garlic to the recipe.  Originally served over rice, but had leftovers over egg noodles, and that was a better combination in our opinions...

Everyone in my family loved this dish but next time I would definitely make some rice to go with it. I added mushrooms and garlic as suggested. I left the chicken whole and after It was done boiling I coated it in flower fried it then put it in the sauce and cooked it in the oven. It was very delicious. Thank you for the recipe I would definitely make it again.

This was quick and easy. I liked the combination of wine w/ sour cream. I added some chopped mushrooms and black olives (from a can, of course!) and it really added some pizzaz.  The cheese gives it a little punch.  I even threw it over "left over" take-out Chinese rice which had been sitting in the fridge... and it was fit for company!  Bravo, Alice!

I made it in a skillet and it was terrible.  Maybe it is good if done in a microwave, but I will never waste good chicken breasts again.

The flavor on this was great!  I added fresh mushrooms and garlic and cooked it in the oven--after browning the chicken breasts on the stove top.  The sauce came out a bit runny, though, possibly because of the moisture from the mushrooms.  I'll try reducing the liquid (and maybe some of the sour cream) next time.

EXCELLENT...I did not use the microwave,
did add mushrooms and garlic to sauce and
oven baked at 350º for 30 minutes. 
Served over rice.  My family made several
most favorable comments during the evening
on how delicious this recipe was and wanted
to be sure I would make it again SOON.

So simple and tasty!  Although my kids are plain food eaters (the kind who like using divided plates so one food doesn't touch another), they told me to make it again.  Was great over egg noodles.

What a really good, easy tasty recipe. We really enjoyed it and since I don't always know what I want to do with my chicken it is nice to have one that I don't have to do a lot with.

I used Kraft Mexican Four Cheese, white cooking wine, a dash of lemon juice (fresh), a dash of pepper, and a pinch of salt. I did not cook in microwave. I put it in a saucepan and simmered until the thickness I wanted and drained the chicken and cut in strips and put back in pot I boiled the chicken in and simmered until I thought it was done. Wonderful!!! Hope my husband likes it!

This was delicious and easy to fix, exactly what I needed. The only change was that I used 3/4 cup of sour cream and 3/4 cup cream cheese because that was what I had. I also prefer to use the stove when I have time, and cooked the chicken in the pan with olive oil then, just before taking them out to slice, I tossed in slices of green, yellow and orange peppers. After 5 minutes of sauteing, I added the sauce, heated it to boiling, then reduced the temperature and simmered for 30 minutes. Served it over egg noodles with clives sprinkled on top. Wonderful recipe!

This recipe was really disappointing. It was not very flavorful, and does not have enough sauce if you follow the recipe. The sauce part of the recipe should be doubled. I will never make this again and only half ate the meal last night because it was just not very good.

This did not turn out well at all.  It was really bland and the chicked topping was soggy, in spite of the fact that I put it on broil for a minute at the end.

Very good and flavorful. I used MAIALE's advice and cooked the chicken with olive oil, cut it up and then simmered with the sauce for 30 min.  I also added probably 3 times the lemon pepper and a couple dashes of garlic salt.  I poured the sauce over spaghetti when it was done.

Excellent!!!! I made on the stove. Cooked the chicken first in olive oil. The cut in slices and cooked some more until slightly browned adding two cloves of fresh garlic. Mixed the sour cream, basil, rosemary, garlic salt, lemon pepper, pepper, white wine, water instead of chicken broth and added frozen green beans and mozzarella cheese. Added sauce to chicken and sauteed until sauce thickened. Then topped over white rice. Lots of flavor and very good. I will try with pasta next time. Very enjoyable.

Well....I might make this again, I might not. It wasn't that bad, my kids just weren't nuts about it. I didn't microwave it either. I brown the chicken for about 6 minutes, took it out amd started the sauce. After I got the sauce going strong, I put the chicken back in and simmered the whole thing for about 1/2 hour. I made double the sauce and I'm glad I did.  I didn't have very much left over. I boiled up some bowtie pasta and served the chicken over it. It was good, just not for my family.

I did not care for this recipe. I didn't follow it exactly (did it on the stovetop instead of a microwave; added some dill and used nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream), but I don't think that would have changed the outcome much. Not impressed.

This recipe was good. I omitted the wine and just used the broth because that was all I had. My kids loved it. I served it over buttered bowtie pasta. Thanks for the recipe

This recipe went over very well in my house. I took some of the suggestions and cooked in a frying pan instead. I also added fresh garlic, parsley, and chopped portebella mushrooms.

Family loved this but I made a few changes. Instead of cooking in water I used chicken broth and added a clove of garlic. Didn't cook in microwave but in skillet on stove top. Was delish!

Delicious!  Cooked it exactly as recipe states and everyone loved. Cooked it another time by using less of this/more of that and it didn't taste very good. Stick with the measurements listed here!

Loved it.  Very like Alfredo sauce, but so easy.  I also sauteed chicken chunks in a big pan, then removed them to start the sauce with a little sauteed garlic.  I didn't have any chicken broth, so I added a little extra wine (used sherry).  No problem thickening - full fat sour cream is pretty thick to begin with.  Returned chicken to pan soon after sauce started. Yum!

I ended up browning my chicken in olive oil and garlic. I mixed all ingredients and added Sun-Dried tomato seasoning from Trader Joes and a minute splash of Stevia.  I baked at 350 degrees (uncovered) for one hour and served with salad.  The Sauce thickened and it was great.

Following previous suggestions, I browned the chicken in olive oil and minced garlic and then added quite a bit of garlic to the sauce.  Then I baked the chicken in the sauce.  Angel hair pasta, broccoli, and garlic bread completed the perfect dinner. It was fantastic!  Better than I've had at some expensive restaurants!  My husband even liked it and he doesn't like many dishes with sauce over the meat!

Great flavor, though sauce was a little runny, easily fixable though.  Very picky 2 year old loved it!  Will make again soon.

This had good flavor. I,like others, cooked it on the stovetop, added garlic and recommend serving it over rice or egg noodles. I used real lemon juice instead of lemon pepper and thickened the sauce by adding flour. My husband and 3 yr. old daughter enjoyed it.

This recipe has a very unique flavor, easy and quick to prepare.  I added garlic 
and mushrooms.  Sauce cooks up very thick, wonderful over rice.  This is not a
dish for children, they probably won't care for the taste.  I will make this again.

Awesome Awesome Awesome!  I love this recipe.  It tastes amazing and is SO easy and quick.  I make it with low fat sour cream to cut the calories.  My husband liked it and I have also served it to guests now and it was a hit.  I like to serve this with rice.  This is definately going into my recipe box!

I felt that this needed garlic, THEN I read the reviews and think I'll also try garlic and mushrooms next time.  I also used Romano since I had it, and didn't have Parmesan.  It was very good with the Romano.  This is on the verge of being an excellent dish!

Maybe I made this incorrectly, but my family did not find it pleasing.  The sauce was gritty.  I'm not sure what needs to be changed, but I don't think I'll be making it again to find out!

Sauce didn't thicken as expected.  I think it's helpful to add pasta or rice (I used orzo) and veggies, and then microwave.  I also cut up the chicken and browned it first so it would cook faster.  Very tasty though.

This simple and delicious recipe moved into the meal rotation after I made it a couple times.    It is quick, easy and so good.   I serve it with noodles and I usually fix a salad and peas with the dish to round out the meal.

I liked it.  I probably wouldn't make it again or if I did I would slowly add a bit more seasoning.  Apparently being from the Caribbean raises my level of "need to spice it up" :)  Thank you for the recipe. It allowed us to try something new.

Another review.  I had some leftover cilantro.  Chopped it up and added it to the sauce before cooking.  WONDERFUL!  And I agreee with cooking it in a pot or skillet as opposed to microwaving it.

Cooked on the stove w/ leftover rotisserie chicken and served over noodles. Used cream of chicken soup instead of chicken broth so it was nice and thick. Also a tbsp of garlic salt and a tsp of cajun seasoning. Tasty.

This was delicious!  Of course I made my own adjustments, but I will definitely make it again!  I did not use the microwave, as other reviews suggested, and simmered everything for 30 minutes...the sauce thickens!  I also used red wine instead of white wine because that was all I had on hand...and it came out wonderful!  In addition, I diced up some onion and tossed in some minced garlic and sauteed it with the chicken before I combined everything.

Like others, we skipped the microwave.  I greased a cast-iron pan with olive oil, and cooked the chicken covered, turning once.  (This kept enough liquid in I didn't need to add any.)  Then I drained the liquid it made and added the rest of the ingredients as specified, and simmered uncovered for maybe 30 minutes.  No need for it to be too thick -- the sauce is delicious on rice.

This recipe turned out horrible. Maybe I did something wrong. I did not cook it in the microwave as specified. I cooked in on the stove. We actually threw it away and I cooked something else. It turned out that bad. Sorry.

This was tasty to us.  I started with leftover cooked turkey, did the sauce on the stovetop, and added the bite-sized turkey at the end just to warm it.  I served it over brown rice because that's what we had.  Quick and yummy if you have the ingredients on hand.   I had made the turkey using Ina Garten's roasted turkey breast from another site.  The stock made this recipe awesome!

This was pretty tasty, only I cooked it on the stove instead of the microwave.  I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder and it had a taste similar to garlic bread.

Perhaps I didnt make it correctly. The sour cream congelaed with all the cooking and the consistency was bad. The wine was the only flavor and not palatable to the kids.

I did what MAIALE suggested and it was FANTASTIC. I loved the rich, sour cream taste that didn't overpower the chardonnay. What I would like to do next time is use spinach fettucini, simply for looks.

Something different for chicken.... the taste was ok - a little rich though, maybe less sourcream and more chicken broth? I had browned the chicken in olive oil and foud the resulting sauce to be sort of separated....I will try it again though with some modifications.

Didn't like this at all. The chicken tasted microwaved and the sauce was really bland. We ended up leaving the meal and going out for dinner.

I browned the chicken and sautéed some mushrooms on high, then added the rest of the listed ingredients (doubled the seasonings, added some red pepper flakes, used non-fat sour cream, and the pizza-type Parmesan since I had no other kind).  I simmered this for 30 minutes, added a tiny bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce, and served it over pasta and with the Italian Peas recipe from this site.  I left the chicken breasts whole, but would probably slice them up once all the ingredients are mixed together since they were a tad bit dry after simmering (the sauce didn’t completely cover them).

This was pretty good although the sour cream was very overpowering. Next time I will add half the sour cream. My husband and kids loved this one though.

This was good, but needs additional flavor. I had half the sour cream requirements, so I added a few oz. of cream cheese. I also used mozzarella and parmesan, added minced garlic, onion powder, garlic salt and tripled the lemon pepper. I used prior cooks' advice to brown the chicken in a skillet. However, I diced the chicken prior to browning it. Delicious. I will make this again and experiment with flavors.

I don't know if I can fairly rate this recipe because I changed it so much.  I followed Justiceamsin's review for the recipe and it really completely changed it.  It turned out good, but I think the next time I would leave out the lemon pepper seasoning.  I actually hate lemon pepper seasoning so I won't miss it.  Even a tiny amount goes a long way.  Thanks for the base starter.

I tweaked this a bit and really liked it.  I left out the lemon pepper altogether and used regular pepper and tons of parsley with extra parmesan.  I cooked the chicken in a skilet with olive oil and fresh garlic until almost doen then cut up and added to simmer in the sauce awhile then served over rice.  Pasta would have been good too.  I can't see doing any of this in the microwave though.  worth trying.

I thought it was pretty good I tossed steamed broccoli in it last minute. The chicken was super tender! My boyfriend didn't like the taste of the wine in it so when I make this again I will leave out the wine.

Was an ok recipe, but I just did not care for the taste personally. Followed everyone's additions when I didn't care for the taste of the original, but still was not completely happy with it.

I liked this one. My husband thought it was okay but a little bland. I cooked mine on the stove top in both whole and cut up pieces. I omitted the wine and added more broth and parmesan. I served the chicken over linguine and broccoli which was very good. My husband isn't really into pasta, so I gave him broccoli and a baked potato covered with the sour cream sauce.

After reading other recipes, I cooked this on the stovetop.  I omitted the lemon and the wine, and added more stock.  I also cut the breasts into bite sized pieces and added garlic powder.  When served over noodles, it was like chicken stroganoff.  Yum.

I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. It would be very elegant over egg noodles with a green salad. It is a rich entree.

This is superb when you want a gourmet meal, but don't have the time or budget, it presents just like a gourmet, restaurant meal.  Serve with rice........wonderful!!!  Don't forget the candles!

I thought it was edible.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  It did make my pregnant wife sick, but I think that was due to the sour cream, not the recipe as a whole.
