I make this all the time & we LOVE it (especially my father-in-law)!  I use tri color rotini, grape tomatoes, pepperonchinis instead of the green peppers, and some chunked red onion.  I also use a whole 16 oz. bottle Wishbone "Robust Italian Dressing".  I learned that if you "dry" (like pat them with a clean dish or paper towels to get the water off) the noodles, the dressing will really stick a lot better.  Pour 1/2 the dressing on right away, refridgerate, and pour the other 1/2 on before serving prevents it from drying out (the noodle will soak up the dressing).  Delicious, it goes great with Italian beef.  Thanks Desiree!

For as easy and versatile as this one is, it deserves 5 stars! I made this for a bridal shower and it went over as a huge hit! I did omit the olives and used a little less tomatoes BUT I then added some chopped zucchini.  Also, I sprinkled in just a little parmesan cheese and added a little white sugar...believe it or not, the touch of white sugar takes the edge off the Italian dressing without making it sweet.  I had people who came up to me at the shower and told me that they don't normally like these types of salads but LOVED the way this was made. They couldn't believe that the secret ingrediant was the dash or two of sugar! A great summer pasta salad! Thanks Desiree!

This is a great pasta salad because it has things that just about everyone likes.  I added zucchini, a red bell pepper, and some fresh mozarella, and i only used a small can of sliced black olives.  I put about 8 oz of Italian dressing on the night before [Newman's family-style italian, our favorite] then another 8oz right before serving.  Great recipe!

I am so picky when it comes to pasta salad!  This is Awesome!!  I followed the advice of MC_MA_OF_3 and dried the pasta on a clean dish towel.  I also substituted the green peppers for pepperonchinis.  I added red onion and sprinkled with parmesean cheese!  Yummy!!  My husband absolutely loves it.  He ate 2 huge bowls last night and took another huge bowl to work with him today.  Thanks so much Desiree for sharing your AWESOME Pasta Salad!

this was a big hit with everyone.  Based on previous recommendations I used robust italian dressing. I skipped the salami, but added about 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan and a half a red onion (finely diced) which I think added some depth of flavor.

Wow!  Everyone loved this.  Followed other reviewers suggestions...added zucchini.  Omitted olives and pimentos.  Used small vine ripened tomatoes cut in half.  Wishbone Robust was discontinued so just used my personal favorite locally made Italian dressing.  Also...when it says 16 servings it means 16 servings.  This recipe made a huge bowl, and it is also very pretty.

This a favorite summertime recipe that I love to take to picnics!  I omit the pimentos, and I add black olives, pepperoncini peppers, and a combination of fresh mozzarella and provolone cheeses.  I use Ken's Steak House light Northern Italian dressing, it's wonderful in this!

This Pasta Salad recipe is so very easy to adapt to personal taste and a great recipe to start with. I never measure amounts when making this salad yet it comes out great every time. To me, the pasta is not the star of a pasta salad but a supporting player to all the rest of the  ingredients. I know many people like to use the tri-color pasta but not me. When it cooks the colors wash out and the pale pasta colors really distract from the beauty of the colorful vegetables and other ingredients. I use quite a few regular tomatoes cut in half (seeds removed) and then cut in little wedges. I use quite a bit of quartered and sliced English (seedless) cucumber (patted dry on paper towel). I do use green pepper in small one inch slices. Definitely add some finely chopped red onion for flavor and a lovely color addition. I don't add olives because I don't like them. I don't add pimento. You can change up the cheese. Last time I used a "Cheddar-Jack" cheese and it was great. I do use the salami and I use turkey pepperoni (so much better and less greasy than regular). My one and only "MUST" when making this salad is NOT to use a bottled Italian dressing. The national brand that you make yourself is 10 thousand times superior to the bottled stuff. Try it next time and I think you'll agree. Whether you make Irlandes recipe as written, or change it up to suit your own taste, you'll end up with a wonderful salad sure to please your guests. Thank ou so much Irlandes for sharing your recipe.

Here is a great tip to kick up the dressing for any awesome pasta salad: for every 3/4 cup Italian dressing (I like Zesty Italian) add 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp white wine vinegar, and 1/4 tsp onion salt.

Great salad.  Did leave out the pimentos and added some chopped red onion. Used about twice as much dressing, having poured some the night before and then again before serving.  Excellent!

This recipe seems delicious, although I have made a few of these salads before, I'm almost wondering if it is going to be too oily from the dressing? Usually what I do for these, I take 2 bottles of the italian dressing(usually house Italian or Robust) and before I shake them up, I open the cap(holding them so that the bottom of the bottle is down, the cap should be aimed at the ceiling) and squeeze out all of the oil that has seperated to the top(dont squeeze too fast or you'll have a big mess). Once the oil is completely out of the bottles I use whats left in the bottle as my marinade for the noodles! Just doing this adds a great deal of flavor to the dish!

I served this at a large family gathering, and got rave reviews!  I added broccoli, and subsituted most of provolone with mozzarella and cheddar cheese just because of personal preference.

This is the pasta salad that I have been making for nearly twenty years. The only difference in this recipe and mine is that my recipe calls for finely diced red onion, and  1 drained jar of pimento-stuffed green olives, along with the sliced black olives (no pimentos necessary if you use the stuffed green olives). I use Good Season's Zesty Italian dressing that I make myself and jazz up with two pressed cloves of garlic. This salad is a meal in itself and my family and friends frequently ask me to make it. I hope you try it too!

Awesome recipe!  I made it for my family (I used tri-colored pasta instead of fusili) and they loved it.  I'll definitely be making this again soon.

This had promise, but there was not nearly enough dressing.  Came out kind of flavorless.  If I made it again, I would use a full 16 oz of dressing.

I've got no complaints!  It's the same pasta salad style I've been making for years and so have my Italian Aunts and cousins from Boston.  
Seeing this made me want to make it again.  The only thing different is that I had to use slices of Provolone and salami, no pimento, and I used Wishbones new MEDITERRANEAN ITALIAN.  I also added a pinch of sugar.  It's just enough but not too much.  Sometimes I do a mix of yellow and green peppers but this time it was just green.
This time I also had to use the very small garden tomatoes, deseeding some of them though, and cutting into small chunks.
Might toss in some fresh basil next time. THANKS FOR SHARING this simple yet SO YUMMY and fast meal made for lunch on the go!

Good and very easy.  Bf made it this morning to use up some meat and pasta we had.  I'd go ahead and add italian dressing several times:  first when you make it, then later as you serve it, just bc pasta will absorb the dressing.  It's a nice, very simple pasta salad that tastes very good.  thanks for the recipe!

Made this salad for years! Sooo easy! I go to the deli and ask for one 1" thick slice each of genoa salami, pepperoni, and provolone or 2 slices depending on how many people. I prefer to let this marniade overnight but when I followed this recipe, I needed it ASAP! Just as good!

I tried this recipe this past weekend for a baby "sprinkle."  I used the exact amounts listed for about 15 people and there wasn't a bite left.  Everyone loved it!  I omitted the pimentos & olives, and added 1/2lb of fresh mozzarella cheese, cubed.  I threw in just enough dressing so the pasta didn't stick beforehand and added the rest about 1/2hr prior to serving.  I used one 16oz bottle of Newman's Own Family Recipe Italian Dressing (pkg says made with Extra Virgin Olive Oil).  Huge hit!  I never write reviews but I felt obligated to this time!

I used all sliced turkey pepperoni, as that was all I had on hand, red bell pepper (we don't like green bell pepper) and I used Newman's Italian Dressing. Very tasty and came together quickly! Next time, I might increase both the provolone and pepperoni as well as add some chopped red onion. This would make a great summer salad to take to a potluck.

Maybe this should be named Pizza Pasta! Tastes like a pepperoni pizza in a bowl. Use more dressing. Personally, I'd halve the meat and add some veggies to lighten the pepperoni/salami taste, but if you're a big meat lover you'll love this recipe.

I made this for my husband's office Christmas party and it was a huge hit! I used Kraft Tuscan House Italian dressing. The only changes I made were to use regular (not tricolor) rotelle pasta, and I replaced the green pepper with broccoli florets. It looked very Christmasy with the broccoli and red tomatoes. I will definitely make this again!

This salad is really good.  I especially liked that both salami and pepperoni are in it, but I might use more pepperoni next time.  I used a red bell pepper instead of green (not a fan of green) and eliminated the pimentos.  I used Newman's Own Family Recipe Italian dressing...the ENTIRE 16 oz. bottle.  I think I would've regretted not using the whole bottle if I hadn't.  Next time, I might grate some fresh parmesan in.  This makes a HUGE bowl of salad..don't make it if you don't have a crowd to feed or you don't want to eat leftovers for a week. :-) Again, this is a really good pasta salad.  Try it!

This is a great recipe that has endless possibilities for personalizing to your taste.  I omit the pimentos, use mozzarella instead of provolone cheese and add marinated artichoke hearts. I took people's advice and went for a robust dressing.  I used Bernstein's restaurant style Italian and it was perfect!

I'm a little late in reviewing this but I made this in July for 20 people at work. Everyone loved it! It is Dec. and they are still talking about how awesome it was. I'm sure I will be making it again for them. I did use robust italian dressing. Poured half of the dressing over the salad at home and when it was time to eat added the rest of the dressing. And I did use more dressing than the recipe calls for. Very good.

I liked this but it wasn't a big hit with others. I used the tri color rotini and would recommend using more Italian dressing than listed in the recipe.

This is the best pasta salad I've ever had. Made as written, or adjusted to your own preferences, you just can't go wrong with this recipe. I've done it several different ways, adding avocado, sliced black olives, cucumber,red onion, various cheeses (feta is really good), anything and everything works in this pasta salad. So, so good. I think I'll have another bowl! ;)

This was really good for a quick pasta salad.  It took a very short time to throw together.  I did use my favorite Italian dressing though (Newman's Own Family Recipe Italian) and I wouldn't suggest it for this, as it's not a very zesty dressing.  It's my favorite Italian for green salads, but it was too bland for pasta salad.  I'd definitely use something more zesty next time.  Since that's the only ingredient to flavor it, I think the success of this recipe is all in the dressing you use.

I made this recipe as a side dish for my daughter's basketball team dinner. They loved it. They ate every bit of it!! I did add sliced pepperocini's to it, as well as some sliced red onion. I  substituted mozzerella cheese for the provolone cheese because I didn't have any. I also left out the pimentos. Great recipe!!!

Trust me this is great! I made some exchanges with the pasta.  Use colored pasta wheels and don't  over cook.  In fact, cook " Al Dente" and drain WELL! Otherwise, the dressing will not adhere to the pasta. Next, I used half of the pasta wheels and had replaced the other half with cheese tortelina(cooked "Al Dente"). You will find this in the refrigerated section in your supermarket. Make sure both pastas are drained well and cooled. I like to cool them in ice water for a few minutes...Refrigerate while you prepare the other ingredients... Then I use some red and yellow bell peppers with the green.  Don't add the pimento.  Use remianing ingredients listed in the pasta dish.  I do sprinkle some Kraft shredded three cheese(parmesan,romano&asigo)
cheeses. I had to add more dressing. You can add amount of dressing to you taste.  Also, I 
always use the Robust Itialian Dressing. This has been a winner everytime I had taken it to a potluck.

I added 1/2 of the dressing and refrigerated the salad for a gathering tomorrow night. I will add the remaining dressing tomorrow. I can not stop eating it! It's that good! I went to the deli counter and got provolone and salami cut really thick. It makes it so much easier to cut and cube the cheese/meat.

I was introduced to this type of pasta salad about 20 years ago and have been making ever since.  It's a fantastic summer side or lunchtime meal.  I prefer to make it without any meat or cheese so it's really a light and healthy dish.  I typically add a variety of veggies (celery, carrots, red onion, red bell pepper, small broccoli florets) in addition to those mentioned here.  I learned over the years to stick with crunchy type veggies as they hold up better in the dressing.  I usually cook the pasta while chopping the veggies and then rinse the pasta well in very cold water to stop the cooking and remove the starch.  I put the pasta and veggies in separate bowls to marinate in the frig overnight.  That's REALLY necessary in order for the flavor to be absorbed.  Then before taking somewhere or serving at home I mix the two and add additional dressing.  I use at least a bottle of dressing for each batch.  Preparing as I mention definitely results in a flavorful, crunchy, colorful salad that's hard to resist.  My kids have always loved this dish and are thrilled whenever I make it.  The recipe makes a very large bowl of pasta salad which is good for pot lucks but also is good for large families or even small families with teens who like to gobble up a veggie pasta salad!

I have a recipe very similar to this one, however, I use red peppers instead of green, no pimentos or salami, add green onions and use Zesty Italian dressing.  I save about 1/3 of the dressing to add just before serving.  I then add a little parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

I make this Pasta Salad when I go on camping trips. It can be made the night before I plan to enjoy it and is a welcome meal after kayaking or other outdoor activities. It would also be good when making long trips if you don't care for fast food.

this was ok, but nothing really special.  it did taste better the next day after it had sat overnight. I guess the flavors melded.  Overall for pasta salad, I think you can do better with other recipes with less ingredients (less expensive).  I don't think I would bother to make this again.

Made this to take to class. It was a huge hit.I used one package of Hormel Pepperoni Mini's instead of cutting the pepperoni. I also had the salami & cheese sliced at the deli before cutting it into small chunks. It allowed more cheese per bite. This is the best pasta salad, and I don't like any other pasta salad.

I did not care for this at all. It was bland, and seemed to be missing a key ingredient, but I can't put my finger on what. My guests enjoyed this much more than I did, but I will not make this again.

This recipe is awesome! you can basically add all kinds of goodie's.
I used garlic summer sausage instead of salami. Better to use a good tangy salami. I used pepper jack cheese instead of provolone. Better to use a sharp stinky feet cheese in this recipe for sure. You need that bite. Did not have pimento's. Added a few chick peas. Still very good. No cherry tomatoes either. This recipe will make a ton of salad.
I made a small test batch first.

I always have to chuckle when people ask me for my "recipe" for pasta salad... I always thought it was a fool proof side but maybe not for everyone.  Anyways, I've been making this, or a doctored up version of this since I can remember, and before me- my mom did as well.  Just a few differences.... I can't stand raw peppers so I use jarred roasted red peppers instead.  I do add pepperoni but not salami.  I add both green and black olives, cucumbers (sliced and quartered), broccoli, sliced carrots, celery, grape tomatoes, and my cheese of choice is cubed muenster.  I also make sure to use a zesty Italian dressing but the amount I use is probably different with each batch- eyeball and taste it.  The pasta will suck up the dressing like you wouldn't believe, so if I remember, sometimes I chill the pasta overnight in the fridge after I cook it and it seems to help.  Either way, I almost always have to add a little more dressing on the 2nd day and give it a toss to revive the flavor.  I get asked to make it at almost every picnic, which is flattering but , all that chopping does get tiresome!

This is a great recipe that I make all the time.  In the summer I add some chopped zucchini and cucumber fresh from the garden.  I often change up the pasta as well, adding bow tie, wheels, or shells.  Enjoy!

I am eating my second bowl and each of my sons is on their second bowl.  This is really yummy salad.  I made it exactly as written and used a robust Italian dressing.  I was hoping for leftovers for lunch, but it is going fast.  The only reason that I would not make this weekly is because it is pretty expensive.  I also had to use Roma tomatoes, but I know it will be even better with grape or cherry tomatoes.  Thanks for the wonderful summer recipe.

Made this today and WOW it's so refreshing! Wonderful! I had the deli cut the meat and cheese extra thick so I would have nice chunks and then I added yellow, orange, and green peppers. My young children even eat it:)

This is one I would recommend to anyone wanting a new taste treat. Very Easy to make and taste better after setting in the fridge over night.

I have been making this recipe for a year.  I use mozzarella chunks instead of provolone, light or fat free italian sald dressing, and I add basil and garlic seasoning to it. I omit the black olives and pimentos.  I make it at least once a week for my house, and I have to double the recipe because it goes fast!!!

Totally easy and versatile.  You can add more veggies, different meats or different cheeses, not to mention different pasta shapes for fun.  Delish!

Had no salami so substituted chunk tuna. Added onion and pepperoncini feta and Swiss cheese. Mixed with 8oz. of dressing the night before, refrigerate overnight and mix in 8 more oz. of dressing before serving.

I am not a pasta salad fan, but I will admit this was pretty good! The only thing I changed, because I had to, was I left out the pimentos. I didn't have those. This is a pretty tasty salad.

I also add Parmesan cheese...and pepper jack if you want a little kick. :)
Also, the instructions above didn't say anything about refrigerating it. I don't think I'd like to eat this warm; mine is always served cold.

Very easy recipe,  made a bunch to have for us adults lunch or a quick snack for the week. Did not use pepperoni,  used salami in place of,  1/2 the amount of cherry tomatoes was plenty.  Doubled the black olives and used the pimento (great flavor,  I have never used them before) and the real keeper is Girard Champagne salad dressing! GREAT flavor.

This was good but had too much meat in it for my family's taste. I thought my extended italian family would like it but just not enough pasta in relationship to the meat and cheese for our taste.

Awesome is right! What a fantastic salad!!! I made this for our Father's Day cookout with my in-laws / bro-in-laws and everyone RAVED and helped themselves to seconds!!! Since I was feeding mostly men (my MIL and I were the only females in the bunch), I wanted something hearty to serve alongside our grilled sausages and brats. Because I was feeding a small crowd, I halved this. I knew I hit the jackpot when my father-in-law asked that I make this the "go-to" salad for every get-together from now on! My pasta salad hating hubby likened this to an Italian sub and I have to agree. Having said this, I do think my personal changes made this extra tasty. Since I am not a fan of olives, I replaced them with thinly sliced (partially seeded) peperoncini peppers, about 1/2 of a 16 oz. jar's worth. I also added about 1/2 of a finely diced red onion and 1/4 c. of fresh grated Parm cheese. I used Olive Garden's signature Italian dressing (the full 8 oz. called for - half right after I tossed everything together and the other half right before serving) and really enjoyed it in this. All I can say is WOW! Totally worthy of any summer BBQ and 100% man approved. Thanks for sharing, Irlandes! :-)

Oye.  Very meh.  Had it a 20 times from deli's and this version is more money & more work.  Sorry, not worth making again.  Very bland & not much flavor.  Just expensive to make.

This is a great, easy salad to make! If you do not have Italian dressing on hand, you can always substitute it with Ranch dressing! Either way...it's good!

I used Wishbone Italian dressing, my favorite, but this just wasn't anything special.  Just OK.  Lots of pasta, not much other stuff and the pasta seemed to soak up all the dressing and needed more.

I make this salad all the time and everyone just raves about it! I've made the following changes but it's still the same base recipe. I've omitted the olives(wife hates 'em), quarter the pepperoni slices, minced a small green pepper, also added a small minced red or yellow pepper. I've also substituted extra sharp cheddar cheese for provolone at times. Also, for dressing, I use Fat Free Kraft Italian and add 1/3 cup of a flavorful, extra virgin olive oil. 

This is my go-to pasta salad and I thank Irlandes for posting this recipe.

A perfect make-ahead hit!  I used tri-colored pasta for added color, halved the recipe, (this makes a ton), added a pinch of sugar, and eliminated the salami.  I used Wishbone Robusto and put in half, then right before serving, added the other half. It is such a beautiful, flavorful dish!

This was a hit at the baby shower I brought it to.  I used tri-color pasta.  I only used about 1 1/2 c of cherry tomatoes because the bowl was almost overflowing.  I used mozarella cheese as my store didn't have provolone, and it worked fine.  I thought 1-inch pieces for the green pepper were too big, and I ended up chopping them into smaller pieces.  My store didn't have pimentos, so I used a jar of green olives stuffed with pimentos instead.  I also added about 1/2 of a red onion.  This makes a lot, and I didn't think 8 oz of dressing was enough; I ended up using about 12 oz.  It takes time to chop everything up, but it's a very easy and tasty recipe, and I'll be making it many times again.

Very good! Expensive, but it makes an ample amount of food.  I didn't add any pimentos because my grocery store didn't have any :(.  This recipe was begging for Pepperoncini peppers if you are into that sort of thing.

I had to bring a pasta salad for a 4th of July bbq and since I don't like the traditional creamy variety I was happy to find this one. I left out the cheese for the lactose intolerant family members and the black olives because some of my family dislike them. Even without those it was a great tasty salad and I got lots of complements on it. It made a TON! I had lots of leftovers and it was even better the next day.

Deliciousness. I used tri-color rotini, No pimentos, subbed diced up pepperoncini and black olives. Only used a half bottle of Italian Salad dressing. Amazing result, fantastic pasta salad. Will make again and again!

should be renamed "pretty good pasta salad for potluck"  It's your typical potluck pasta salad and it's pretty good.

I used mozzarella cheese, and omitted the green pepper.  It was pretty good.  I do think next time I would add some shredded zucchini as others suggested

Love this recipe!  Sometimes I make it with cheese tortellini instead of the spirals and leave the provolone out.

Delicious pasta salad. I use monterey jack with jalapeno peppers to give it a little kick and only 2 cups of grape tomatoes. A combination of green and red pepper give it a little more color as well as using tri-colored pasta noodles.

This recipe is really good! I changed the recipe a little bit, though. Here's how:
Instead of using pepperoni I used just ham. I also used parmesan ranch dressing and took out the veggies, since my kids are not a big fan of them! I would suggest taking out the veggies if you have kids who don't like them.

I just made this pasta salad for a BBQ we're going to this evening - it turned out great! I used rainbow pasta and I didn't even include salami as I found some dry pepperoni and cut that into cubes - it's plenty of meat for this dish. Nice and easy!

I make my pasta salad almost identical to this one, except I do not use pimentos, or green pepper.  In place of provolone I use 2 pkgs feta tomato & basil cheese and don't use salami.  Unbelievable.  It gets ate up in a heartbeat and I'm always giving out the recipe.

I believe most pasta salads are the same with the exception of the dressing.  When I made this I used bottled Italian Salad Dressing (Wishbone).  I was disappointed.  I wouldn't change anything if I make it again except with a homemade dressing.

This recipe rocks. I add another bottle of dressing right before I serve it, just to give it a more "wet" appearance. Otherwise most of it soaks in and it looks like there isn't anything on it. This is a perfect pasta salad, the addition of the meat and cheese makes it a meal in itself!

This recipe was awesome!! Made for a large  group of people of all ages. Big Hit!! Got recipe requests and some even took a bit home to eat later. I did use a variation of the recipe however. I uses 1/2 provolone and 1/2 cheddar (1/4 lb. each) to add nice color. I also used green and black olives, and as many reviewers suggested, zucchini. This dish was perfect though, will definitely make again! Thanks Desiree!

DEFINATELY a keeper!!  I had a guest who doesn't eat anything with mayo...and I'm so glad I found and tried this one.  I left out the pimentos and used shredded cheddar instead of provalone.  Everyone LOVED it!!  I made it 24 hours in advance, and forgot to add extra dressing, but I thought it was fine.  If you are serving a very large group, I think adding extra pasta & dressing would be fine without adding extra of  everything else.  Thank you for all the great reviews!  That's what made me try it!  :)

I knew better but I followed the directions and used bottle dressing and after tasting it I wished I hadn't. I find bottle dressings bland and only used them sparingly.  I will make this  pasta salad again but next time use my own dressing.

The minute you put a bell pepper in a salad all you can taste is the pepper.  Unfortunately the flavor of raw peppers is all pervasive.  Without that the salad is the bomb

There's a recipe was very simple to make and delicious. The only thing that I did was add more Italian dressing because I felt that you couldn't really taste it.

Made this today for a trial run for upcoming get togethers.  It was great, followed other hints and added peppercini.
Love the combination of colors, textures, etc.  I will definitely make this again.

I love this salad - though have my own version, I always make this at least one day before serving. I use both salami and pepperoni (get both in half inch slices from the deli, much easier to cube that way), along with cubed zucchini and yellow squash, two types of cheese (one smoked one sharp), but do not use peppers as my family is not a fan.  I use both green and red onions, plus I use a combo of Kraft fat free Zesty Italian and Kraft Sun Dried Tomato dressings - they are lighter and zippier tasting.  I use half the dressing, mix well,cover then refrigerate over night. I add the rest of the dressing the next day before serving.  It makes a lot, but I send home leftovers with both my kids.

To quote my kids, "This is banging."  A good mix of flavorings, easy to make and a large salad at the end.

I forget to buy the pimentos and the recipe still rocked. All my family members loved it too. Big hit at our party. Definitely a keeper. And it was super easy to make. FYI I used Safeway brand Italian Salad Dressing.  The recipe makes a lot. Perfect for a party but too much for a family of 3. Make sure you change the serving size unless you want lots of left overs.

Just made this for dinner tonight -- letting it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before we dig in. While tasting it after combining all the ingredients, I felt it needed a bit more Italian flavor, so I added a few shakes of that spice combo (Italian Seasoning).  I debated about adding red onions, and in the end, I decided against it since there were so many intense flavors going on anyway.  I did leave out pimientos since I don't care for them, and added way more salami and pepperoni since we're dedicated carnivores here in this household.  Also added a jalapeno havarti as the cheese, since couldn't find provolone at the store.   Magnifico!

Love it!! I added mozzarella and pepperoncinis, and used tricolor rotini and extra grape tomatoes and omitted the olives and pimentos. I also used a bit less dressing and this recipe was amazing!

This was good, but as written it needs some flavor work.  So three stars.  The base recipe is good though.  It just needs some zest, pep, SOMETHING to liven the flavor up.

Hold down the cost of this salad by asking your deli person if they have a meat ends price (for whatever butt ends they have left over that they're either throwing out or using to make antipasto).  I got half/pounds of salami, ham, turkey, and muenster at the meat ends price and it made the costing on this much better than if I'd paid the regular price.

This was really good! I left out the pimentos, added shredded Parmesan cheese, and upped the salad dressing by adding a little more right before serving. Will make again!

I liked this pasta salad, but didn't love it. The pepperoni was overkill, and I ended up removing them after the first serving, as they took away from the dish, rather than adding to it. The remaining pasta salad tasted just fine, but it wasn't extraordinary. I probably wouldn't make it again.

I followed the recipe to the T and took this to a potluck today.  I came home with leftovers.  I thought it tasted great but people loved a buffalo chicken cheese dip more....lol.  I will make this again for another potluck to try my luck.  I think it is a delicious pasta salad.

This recipe relies heavily on the type of Italian dressing you select. I make my own oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar. I make my dressing ahead of time and add until the salad is coated to my desired consistency.

Prepaired as stated, Should have reduced amount so I had a lot of salad for one person so gave some to neighbors and they ask for the recipe. Only change was that I could not find  whole salami to chunk so I used sliced and was great.

This is very close to the way I make my pasta salad except I add peas, minced onion, artichoke hearts, mozzarella cheese instead of provolone, and mix the Italian dressing with mayo for a creamier taste. It's a lot better if you let it marinate in the fridge for several hours or even over night.

This is an easy and yummy salad, I omitted black olive and pimento, but added one avocado. And I used different pasta as that's what I have on hand. Next time I make it, I'll replace provolone cheese with fresh mozzarella, since it's too salty with pepperoni, salami and provolone altogether for me. Would give a 5 star if it was mozzarella.

Solid recipe. Makes alot could only make for bigger events as we are a family of 3. Used Mozerella instead of Provolone as it was what I had on hand.

So easy and very versatile. The secret is in the italian dressing you use so splurge on the good kind! I added small mozzarella balls because it's not a pasta salad without my favorite cheese. Huge hit- everyone will love it!

SO YUMMY! So versatile too! I looked up a few recipes to help keep my cholesterol under control and this was one of the options....I made this for the first time today and LOVED it....I left out the salami and added 1/2 block of Pepper Jack cheese and added a few suggestions from others and added Parm and shredded Mozz cheese and it turned out great! I also used green olives. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe....its the perfect base to a great pasta salad!!

You are right!  This salad is awesome!!!  The only ingredient I added was about 1/4 cup of finely chopped red onion.  My family loved this recipe!

This was a hit at the Memorial Day BBQ I went to. I used all ingredients as it called for but added some red onion. I used a Robust Italian dressing and it made this dish very very tasty! Not sure why you'd omit the pimentos - that added a nice touch. Will be making again!

Fabulous recipe! I substituted Kielbasa for the Salami, used fresh diced sweet red peppers and 2 finely minced fresh Jalapenos. The black olives were a condiment on the side for the people that do not care for them. The bowl was "almost" licked clean!

Sometimes the heat here in central VA doesn't appear to be all that but the humidity is killer. This salad can beat the heat any day! Even better when allowed to sit in the fridge over night and served for lunch or dinner with a great crusty bread. Easy prep, onhand ingredients, colorful, and delicious!! Oh, almost forgot.. it says it serves 16 and as a side dish that's probably accurate but last night I had 6 adults, served it with tall glasses of iced tea and French bread and there wasn't enough left to fill a cereal bowl!  I look forward to doing this again!

This is a wonderfully refreshing salad.  I used the tri color pasta because that is what I had on hand.  The recipe would be good for a crowd because it makes a lot.  Thanks for a nice pasta salad.  Very good!

This should be called Antipasto pasta salad- if you like Antipasto you are going to LOVE this salad!  Perfect recipe- I only made one change (which is rare) I used banana peppers and green peppers because I had them from the garden. This salad looks almost as good as it tastes.

I make this recipe all the time and my guests love it.  I use mozzarella chunks instead of provolone, add artichokes and leave out the salami. Also I use wishbone red wine salad dressing with a little more balsamic! Yum!

I made this for a huge baby shower that I had and made double the recipe. This is the only thing that there was NONE left of! I think almost every single person asked for the recipe (there was 56 people there) Used penne and substituted mozzarella for provolone. I also used lowfat pepperoni and salami and added garbanzo beans. I used Light Cheese Fantastico salad dressing. Superb!! Will never make it any different!

TEN STARS!!!  Just what I was looking for - and I used Fat Free Italian to lighten up the calories.  I made 1/2 recipe for 6 adults and had lots left over for 6 to have lunch the next day! Sent some home with a friend and he called long distance the next day to rave about how good it was on the third day!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love pasta salads & this is now one of my favorites.. Don't skimp on the tomatoes as I did(didn't have enough) because you need these to counter the saltiness of the meats & dressing(used Kens Northern).
Enjoy!

I whipped this up for dinner tonight. I was very happy with the results. I was REALLY satly because of the dressing and the other ingredients, but that can be fixed. I was really suprised that my daughter liked it as much as she did. I didnt change anything and it was very delish.

This was good - I substituted quite a bit.  I used tri-color rotini, pepperoni, mozzarella cheese, canned tomatoes, green peppers, and Italian dressing.  It was delicious with our cheeseburgers on the grill and corn on the cob - but next time I will probably put more Italian in it, I don't think my version had quite enough flavor to it!

Like most people, I liked this pasta salad, and it's a great base recipe to what you will with.  I did mine with no pimento, and I used bowtie pasta, added the small Mozerella "balls". not sure what they are really called, but it all was fine.

This recipe is very good! I substituted fresh mozeralla balls instead of provolone.  I couldn't find fusilli, I used another type of pasta.  It was just as good.

I made this for a cookout this weekend. There was none left over. My husband was disappointed because he wanted some more the next day. This was very easy to make also.

I doubled this for a picnic & used fat-free zesty Italian dressing. Everyone loved it, including my 2-year-old niece. I thought there was plenty of dressing, & it tasted better the next day.

Great recipe! Took it to a potluck supper. Everyone enjoyed it. It has a wonderful combination of flavors and textures. The only thing I did differently was add a little more dressing and substitued grape tomatoes instead of the cherry tomatoes.Thank you!

I never make changes to a recipe. I figure someone worked really hard creating it so I stay the course. If I don’t like it I won’t make it again.

Use the pasta and Italian dressing as a jump off point for creativity.  Have used kalamata and green olives, mozzarella pearls, pepperoncini, marinated mushrooms, marinated artichoke hearts, cucumbers, garbanzo beans, mini pepperoni's, hard salami.  So many different options if you like strong flavors.

Made it for a picnic and every one loved it. Thought it was store bought.  So easy and so good.  Going to try some of the other suggestions next time around, though I think it is perfect the way it is.

It's delicious!!  I made it with Olive Garden Italian and one dry pack of Italian seasoning  dressing as suggested. Green Olives instead of black and added 1 cup of baby carrots for added color and variety.  The good thing about this salad is you can choose what you want to add or change.  But the secret ingredient is the Italian seasoned dressing, perfect!

I love this Italian pasta salad. It's very similar to what I make. I've never made it with pimentos, sounds like a great addition! I always use banana peppers and red onion and I throw in a jar or two of artichokes, drained. And if I have it on hand, I throw in a few handfuls of fresh baby spinach when the pasta is still warm just to wilt it a little. This is such a great recipe to change up with different vegetables, cheeses and meats. Whatever suits you!

Good pasta salad. Can stand alone as a lunch salad or accompany other picnic type foods. Made according to recipe but put some dressing on right away and added more before serving.

I was really looking forward to making this after I read all the reviews. To be honest...it was just ok, I don't really understand all the hype about it though. It was easy and it made a large amount which is always good to have the following day so I may make it again. I didn't change anything in the recipe and followed it exactly but it seemed to have something missing.

Used Trader Joes Tuscan Italian with Balsalmic and that worked very well. Added 1/2 a green bell pepper and halved the dressing, pasta, meat, and cheese amounts. I like it better with mozzarella than provolone the second time. Yum!

I don't like pasta salad usually, but I really liked this one.  I did add chopped red onion and cucumber (seeded & chopped) like some reviewers suggested.  Also, used 16 oz bottle of Ken's Steakhouse Zesty Italian Dressing which was another suggestion and I liked it very much (not too much vinegar), putting on half the day before when I put everything together and half about an hour before serving. I used yellow pepper due to personal taste.  There are so many variations you can make with the cheeses and vegetables to add.  Can't go wrong with this one!

I hate pasta salad! I was given the task to make the pasta salad for a family reunion today and even though I hate pasta salad I said okay.. So I found this recipe and made a double batch with one can of olives, a whole huge bag of pepperoni, cubed cheddar cheese, Italian dressing + Roasted parmesan Italian dressing, a green bell pepper, 2 cups cherry tomatoes and a cup of parmesan grated cheese and boy was it AMAZING! You just have to tweak it the way you want it. It was so easy, quick and everyone at that reunion ate it up! It was VERY good!

Loved this.  It was easy and so tasty.  I used Good Seasons Italian Dressing with Balsamic Vinegar.  I also added ham (I bought it in a chunk like the salami and used sharp provolone) YUM!  This will be my "go to" dish when having or going to a party!

I added chicken instead of the salami and pepperoni and it was delicious!! I also did not add the pimentos and put in a red pepper instead of green because in my opinion red peppers taste better than green. Definitely would make this again,recommended !!

This is a great recipe in which you can add anything you want to and make it your own.....we've made this for years, but we only use Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing.........For some reason, this just tastes the best with this brand.......  My family devours this when I make it.........lucky if I get any......and I am always asked to bring to get togethers, family reunions, etc....!    lol......you may need a couple bottles of dressing, for I always keep adding ingredients and run short of dressing, because you can keep thinking of more things to add to it as you're making it........and ps.....those little corn on the cobs in a jar are wonderful in this as well !

I made this the night before for Independence Day and it was a hit! Everyone loved it and went back for more. I forgot the bell pepper when I went to the store to get the ingredients so I added a jar of banana peppers instead (and some of the juice). It added great flavor! I also used Wish Bone Robusto Italian dressing like another reviewer suggested. The only bad thing I have to say is that I had none left to take home with me. This will be my go to pasta salad from now on. I think I'll make it for the block party next month. Thanks for sharing!

My family enjoyed this dish more than I did.  I thought it was slightly bland overall even with my subsitution of Cesar dressing for the Italian (son does not like Italian), using very high end salami, addition of artichoke hearts and less pasta.  I believe this recipe would benefit from additional vegetables.  Next time I'll add brocolli and califlower.  I will also ask the deli for much spicer salami.  My family is adament I make this salad again..so I most definitely will.

Delicious as is, but I sometimes vary the pasta - orzo, farfalle, seashells, etc.  I have also used different cheeses - farmers, white cheddar, etc.  Finally, I also sometimes add grilled vegetables - asparagus, summer squash, red onion, etc.

I have made this for years HOWEVER the dressing was on the back of the pasta box and I cannot find it anymore.  I think it was on Muellers box. I have even checked their site and its not there.   I am not crazy about the Italian dressing on it but would like to find original recipe.

Since I am not a fan of the traditional Italian dressing, I have made this with Ranch, Greek, Peppercorn Parm and even Creamy Italian dressing.  I have also used a Canola/Olive oil blend in place of bottled dressing, Kalamata olives instead of canned black olives and Pepperoncini over pimento.  Chopped red onion is an absolute must.   This recipe is a good base that can be modified to suit everyones needs & likes.  It's a staple for summer gatherings.

My kids and I just made this recipe and it was delicious! We like lots of flavor and a little heat so made 3 slight modifications by adding: (1) italian seasoning; (2) crushed red pepper flakes; and (3) shredded parmesan as garnish.

This will definitely be my go-to summer time side dish. 

Thanks so much for sharing.

Very good. Lots of flavor.  Have the salami cut a little thick so they do not stick to each other with cutting up. Seemed to taste even better after sitting over night in the frig.

I loved the basic idea, I did use tri color vegie pasta,  1 jar chopped artichoke hearts, 1 bunch chopped green onions, 3 gloves minced garlic, 1 tsp wine vinegar, and yes a lot more Italian dressing.  Everyone loved it and had to make another bowl the next day.

Delicious! I left out the pimentos, but used green olives stuffed with pimentos instead of black olives. I also couldn't find any block provolone cheese, so I used mozzarella instead, and it worked well. And I couldn't find salami that wasn't already sliced, so I just left it out completely. My only suggestion would be to maybe use a little less of the Italian dressing, taste the salad, and if you want more then add some more. I used less than what was called for, and I still almost thought it was a tad bit too salty.

I made this for a camping trip. It's amazing! I made it the day before and it held up well, stored in a ziplock and stuffed in an ice chest. For the dressing, I used a Tuscan vinaigrette that had a balsamic base. It worked very well. We are foodies with a wide variety of tastes and our friends like traditional dishes without being too exotic. This pleased all of us, including picky kids. I'll definitely make it again.

At first I was like "Who in the world needs a recipe for pasta salad. It's just noodles, random veggies, some cheese and dressing." But after trying many times and failing to get pasta salad right I decided I wanted to try a recipe for my daughter's birthday and I'm glad I did. As far as pasta salads go, this was awesome. I really enjoyed it as did everyone at my daughter's birthday BBQ. It's so simple yet so good. This will be my new go-to for potluck BBQ's!

Loved this salad. Great flavors, light and refreshing on a hot summer day. Everyone at the picnic kept asking for the recipe.  I've made it twice now following the recipe exactly the first time and the second time changed it up a bit using fat free zesty Italian dressing, green olives and didn't put the pepperoni in it since I didn't have it on hand at the time and Havarti cheese instead of provolone. Such an easy recipes to change it up a bit.  New summer pasta salad favorite.

I have made this recipe a thousand times over the decades.  This is the best basic recipe.  Tweek it to suit you and your family.  Tri-color Rotini is what I use.  Plus use the McCormack salad supreme seasoning in addition to zesty Italian dressing.  Use this basic recipe and add what strikes your fancy that day.  Banana Peppers, cucumber, green olives, some in my family like broccoli (yuck).  This is a summertime staple.  Every young chef out there age 10 plus should learn this basic recipe.

VERY good!  Will be making again.  I used Robust Italian as suggested by reviewers.  Eight ounces of dressing was enough for us.  I used mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, black olives, green pepper, and pepperoni.  That was enough to make this perfect.

This really should be made at least 8 hours prior to serving so the flavors can meld.  It needs a little onion and a very flavorful Italian dressing.   If it is dry when serving, add a little more dressing.  I have also made it with shredded Parmesan.  (not the kind in the green can, but the refrigerated kind)  We liked it.

This is a wonderful pasta salad!  I made it for a graduation barbeque for my granddaughter.  It was truly a hit!  Tastes like antipasto in a salad! Used sliced string cheese instead of provolone (because that's what I had) and diced red pepper instead of pimento.  Also used fat free Italian dressing.  Yummy!!

I loved it! I did make a few changes.. I used Colby & Monterrey Jack cheese instead of provolone.. I added in carrots and cucumbers .. I omitted the olives just because not everyone in my home likes olives.. It's a must-have for BBQs.. Yumm!

Remember guys that the pasta is going to soak up the dressing! I use 1/2 of the dressing and let set for a few hours or over night and then I pour the rest on and it turns out very flavorful and not dry.

I only made one change:  I used just enough Italian Dressing to coat the pasta lightly.  Then when I assembled it I added Ranch Dressing to taste.  Of course, you can change the ingredients added to the pasta to your own favorites.  I like to use pepper jack cheese, diced jalapeno and chopped cucumber in addition to the other add-ins.

My Husband came to me 3 hrs before we were to attend a graduation party telling me we had to bring something...like pasta salad.  He wanted me to make the boxed stuff. haha So I turned to All Recipes and found this highly rated pasta salad. I made the salad using a little more pasta then recommended to accommodate for the large crowd, filling a large aluminum pan.  The pasta salad turned out great and was a huge hit.  My husband took the salad to the party and I arrived a few hours later to find that out of all the side dishes on the table this salad was almost gone and was clearly the crowd favorite! I was glad I was able to get some.  I think it turned out delicious and I am planning on making it for my family this week.  While my salad was a hit at the party I think I would have left it sit in the dressing for a little longer so the Italian spices would have had time to soak in and marinate the noodles. I also used one of the other reviewers recommendations and added a dash of sugar.  Thank you for this recipe! It is a keeper in my book.

OMG... this has got to be the best Pasta Salad I have ever tasted.  The first time I made it, I used Zesty Italian and the last 5 or 6 times I have used Creamy Italian and it made all the difference.  I added cucumber and sprinkled parm cheese and bacon bits across the top.  My co workers, family and friends all love it and it'ssince been requested at every function.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Really good pasta salad! I've made this twice. The first time I added more dressing as one reviewer said it was dry. My husband found it too greasy. The second time I stuck with the recipe and it was perfect. The only changes I made was a little grated Parmesan and a few sprinkles of Italian herb seasoning. Delicious!

This is my favorite non- mayo pasta salad!  I often can not find fusilli at the supermarket and use other kinds of pasta.  I add extra dressing.  If I am bringing this to a party I bring an extra bottle of dressing and find guests usually like to add more dressing.  Its also good to have extra dressing for leftovers the next day because the pasta will dry overnight.

This is  AWESOME, my husband said good for company which means he loves it.  I used smoked provolone  and fresh garden tomatoes to enhance the flavor, and sprinkled Pecorino Romano cheese on top.
Wonderful summer salad.

This was awesome.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was very good, but the recipe made enough for a small army.  It would be good to make if you were going to a cookout or gathering or having a party.  Sent some home with company, gave some to the neighbors and still have plenty for a few days.  It taste better everyday.  This recipe is a keeper.  Rate a 5

I liked the mix of flavors in the salad.  The amount of salad dressing was just right to me; not too much, but still added flavor.
I did a rough half recipe, substituting whole grain elbows for the pasta, lite Italian dressing.

Made this for mothers day. Family raved. I cut back on the canned sliced olives to half a can and I chopped up a cucumber.  Used all the peppers in the other reviews.  Makes a ton.  Feeds at least 10.  Excellent and easy!

Great recipe.  I add cheddar cheese cubes, broccoli, cauliflower, and artichoke hearts (they especially soak up the flavors).  I make my own homemade Italian dressing as well. This salad is a meal in of itself.

This truly is an awesome pasta salad.  I use red or orange bell pepper, Kraft Roasted Red Pepper and Parmesan dressing, a few shakes of grated parmesan, about a tablespoon of Salad Supreme seasoning and skip the salami. Always a hit!

Light tasting and versatile which I liked. I don't use italian dressing much so I don't know if my dressing fell short on flavor.  I had no problems with it though. To my availability, I used genoa salami, red bell pepper, red onion, green onion, asiago cheese and pepperoncini. I'm very pleased with all the ingredients combined but will add the pepperoni, tomatoes next time...black olives? IDK. Also, i added a touch of sugar and s&p.

WOW!!  This is amazing.  This is definitely a good summer meal.  I used tri-color pasta, omitted the green pepper, added some small peperoncinis, mild banana pepper rings and topped with shredded parmesan cheese.  My favorite italian dressing is Ken's Steakhouse Lite Northern Italian dressing with basil and romano.  It's wonderful with no sour tang to it.

Very good salad...everyone loved it.  I added more veges, and used less meat, but that's the great thing about these kinds of salads.  You can alter to suit your own tastes.

I have never made a pasta salad like this before and it is really, really good!  I didn't change a thing on the first try but the second time I forgot the pimentos, but they weren't missed.  It is now a request from those who have tried it. Donna, Oxford OH

This really was an "awesome" pasta salad.  I substituted mozzarella for the provolone and added a zucchini.  Yes, it made a TON and we had a lot of leftovers (it was just us, no guests), but I'm not complaining!  The 8 oz of italian dressing was perfect for me.  I used a parmesan Italian and thought that added a nice touch.  I will definitely be making this again, even if I have to halve the recipe so I'm not eating it for a week if we don't have company... lol.  Love it!  Thanks!

I made the same substitutions as a lot of the reviewers suggested but one thing I also agreed with that I didn't like was how the Italian dressing made it taste a little bitter. So after adding 1/2 a bottle of that, I went out a bought a bottle of creamy italian and added that. I think that helped a lot. People did rave about it and ask for the recipe.

I absolutely love this pasta salad! I  I substituted a couple of things like instead of provolone, I use asiago cheese and since we don't like black olives, I add artichokes.  It is packed with flavor and everyone loves it when I bring it somewhere.

I made this pasta salad yesterday to bring to a BBQ and I have to say this pasta salad was the hit of the BBQ.  It was literally gone within an hour.  The only changes that I made were I omitted the pimentos and I added frsh mozzarella.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

This is a great recipe! I didn't put a whole bottle of dressing in it, as half of bottle was more than enough. To make it even more heartier, I added some cubed chicken. Highly recommend!

This is pretty easy and good, but I didn't think it was great.  Just needed a little more zing.  I did use fat-free dressing, but the Wishbone is fairly zesty and is what I use for everything, so I don't think that's it.  And I don't think just adding more dressing is what is needed.  There's something else... don't know.

This was a very good pasta salad recipe and easy to adjust to your own taste. I highly recommend you use an Italian dressing you LOVE, and then you just can't go wrong.  I didn't have any of the meats and my family still enjoyed it!

I made some changes, I omitted the blk olives (we don't like them much)  & the pimentos ( only because I didn't have any on hand. I added cubed cucumbers.  It was just delicious!  I accompanied this with a Rib end Pork Roast ( I seasoned with S & P, lots of minced garlic and olive oil, some oregano and Adobo - spanish seasoning powder.  I had BBQ sauce handy, in case anyone wanted to add on.  Also, a side of fresh corn on the cob.

I am typically not a fan of pasta salads, but this one is really good.  Nice combination of flavors!  The only thing I substitued was grape tomatoes for  cherry, personal preference.  Took it to a party and recieved rave reviews.  Great recipe, thanks.

Excellent salad!In my opinion it was even better with the following changes: used ham instead of salami, cubed pepperoni instead of sliced, omitted black olives (like them, but not in this salad, also omitted pimentos, and added chopped red onion instead.  As others suggested, I dried pasta(whole wheat) on paper towels and used Good Seasons dressing.

This pasta salad is really good!!! I left out the tomatoes and used good seasons italian. It made enough for an army and there is just two of us! We had no problem finishing it up ourselves in a few days! This is very simple to make and has a great taste. I would bring this to a get together this summer!!

I added a small jar of drained artichoke hearts, some green olives, a little red onion, and only salami, no pepperoni. I also used half the Provolone and more of the mozzarella, and used Kraft Zesty Italian to taste. I found a GF rotini pasta and now it's the most requested side dish for my GF friends

I’m not much of a side dish maker, so I stretched myself with finding something for a family summer event. This salad was a hit- super impressed!

Great pasta salad for a crowd. Next time I’ll make half the recipe. Great combination of veggies and protein. I would definitely make this again but substitute ham for the salami.

I was the best pasta salad i'be ever done. I doubled the quantity for church Christmas party, and it was nothing left in this huge bowl only 1 hour after the party began.
Thank you so much, and looking forward to do, excitingly, other recipes :)

I received a lot of compliments on the salad.  I added pepperoni, cherry tomatoes, chopped red onion and cubes of cheddar cheese.  I found the Wishbone Italian Robusto dressing and put about 8 oz on which seemed to be more that enough.  It provided a nice flavor without being drenched in oil.  I'll definitely make this again.

I've made this pasta salad several times now and I really like it.  I've used different cheeses and different mixes of veggies depending on who I'm making it for. I've sometimes made it ahead for the next day and when I do that I always have some extra dressing to add before serving just in case it seems dry, and I also add the tomatoes and softer cheeses at that time so they don't get mushy. I also take the advice of other reviewers and dry the pasta before putting it in the bowl.

This is always a hit with my family. I like to use the Kalamata Olives, so I use them for myself. My mother likes regular black olives and mozzarella cheese, so I sub that for the feta. I have made this several times...always good!

I made it exactly as recipe said.  I thought it was a little bland.  Next time I will add some onion and a little garlic.  It is a good start to a recipe with possibilities.  It just needs more flavor.

Made this for a gathering, this is the pan which was full- after 1/2 hr. I used Wishbone Italian. Crowd pleaser! I did t have pimentos and added a couple extra veggies we had in the fridge.

Excellent.  I used cubed ham instead of the sliced pepperoni, but other than that made it to the recipe.  I did end up using a full 16oz. bottle of Italian dressing (I used Newman's Own Home Style.)

This recipe makes a big bowl of pasta salad!  I ate it both as a side dish and as a lunch - it was great.  I added a small drizzle of additional dressing to the salad as needed after it was in the refrigerator for a few days.

Will definitely make again.

The only change I made was using green and yellow peppers, shredding the cheese instead of cubing it and using half Olive Garden dressing/half Kraft Zesty Italian. I want to eat this every day of my life!

I agree with everyone....this is a great side dish! I took it to an HOA BBQ last weekend and it got rave reviews! As many have done, I took liberties with the added ingredients, but what I kept in place was the rotini pasta and robust Italian dressing. Scrumptious!

Simply DELICIOUS. Can alter ingredients with little to no concern for a negative impact. We started with a light Zesty Italian dressing but found it lacking so finished off with Olive Garden Italian Dressing...MUCH better. Black olives, green olives, ham, pepperoni, hard salami, red pepper, mozzarella cheese and pepper-jack cheese in ours and onion. Will DEFINITELY make again and maybe add banana peppers.

Good summertime pasta.  Best to cut pepperoni/or used cubed pepperoni as sliced tends to stick together.

We love this pasta salad recipe, the only change we made is to skip the pimentos, I don't like them.

This was delicious. When I make it again, I may sub a softer cheese, Colby jack.  But other than that, 5 stars. Super easy and delish!

Excellent recipe. We are remodeling our house and staying in our travel trailer, so I needed an easy/no bake recipe for a Senior Citizen's lunch my son's 4-H group is hosting. This was perfect!  The only disappointment was not getting to have it all to myself!

I tried 4 grocery stores and couldn't find fusilli pasta anywhere.  I used Rotini instead.  I haven't tried it yet, but taking it to a family reunion tomorrow.  Crossing my fingers!

Great pasta salad. Made tonight for tomorrow's gathering. Gave hubby a taste, and he asked for a bowl. Omitted the black olives 'cause we don't like, but added all the peppers we had on hand. Red, green, yellow and orange. YUMMY!

I've made it a bunch of times. I add what I have fresh in the fridge at the moment. It's always great ! Black olives, salad olives, no green peppers though, too strong, love it.

I read all the comments when I make a recipe and adjust accordingly.  I followed the directions with these changes:  added more dressing.  I applied once to the noodles after they were cooked and then again when I mixed the salad. I used Italian dressing mixed with a Balsamic garlic dressing.   I added some zucchini and parmesan cheese too.  I brought the salad to a family dinner and it was a hit!  Everyone took some home afterwards too because I made a double recipe.  My husband, who does not like cold salads, even ate two helpings.  :)

Good but the dressing drowns out the meat and cheese.  For the health benefit, I would go with another recipe.

I have been making this salad for years and it is my go-to for potluck dinners. Mine is a little different ingredients almost every time I make it. What is in it depends on what I have for fresh veggies in the fridge. And instead of meat, I use shrimp and/or imitation crab. I use whole grain rotini for the pasta, and the beautiful color comes from the bright vegetables. Just a few colorful vegetables that I use are sliced green onions tops and all , cucumbers, broccoli, green peas( use frozen and no need to cook them), all colors of bell peppers....green red, yellow and orange, red onion, diced, zucchini squash, salad tomatoes, celery,. I have used several different dressings...Italian, Ranch, Vidalia onion. and have even used ranch mixed with a little Roka (roquefort cheese). I always add more dressing before serving as the pasta absorbs a lot of the dressing.  I never bring home any leftovers from potluck.

I have been making this for years and have used different kinds of pasta to change it up. Tri color bowties and  spagetti also make this a wonderful pasta salad. My recipe also calls for half of a jar of salad seasoning. It is the McCormick Perfect Pinch brand.  This gives it so much more flavor!

When I saw the name of this recipe I was excited that it might mean a good recipe for pasta salad dressing.  Bottled Italian dressing is a pretty subjective thing and a lot could go wrong there.  As many of the commenters say, there are a variety of ingredient combinations that make for a good pasta salad.  That said, I did make the recipe just as stated and with Kraft lite Italian dressing.  The meat addition is new for me and was nice.  All good but I am still looking for a great scratch dressing for pasta salad.

Yes, I used the Ruffles Garden Vegetable pasta, chopped onions, diced dill pickles and Newman's Own Garlic Parmesan Dressing. So very delicious and  a family favorite. So easy to make and a definite crowd pleaser.

Lose the lunch meats, it's PASTA salad!  I use Robusto Italian dressing and it's too bland unless you use 1/2 container Salad Supreme seasoning. I add green pepper, black olives, onion and grape tomatoes. Always a hit!

When I make a pasta salad, I like to keep it as healthy as possible with lots of fresh veggies and not a ton of dressing. I can't imagine a pasta salad with salami and pepperoni - all that fat and salt! This just sounds very unappealing.

I make this without the green pepper and add extra Italian Dressing.  
Best to let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours to let all the flavors blend.

Fantastic recipe!  We omitted the jar of pimentos.  We used sea shells as the pasta, and added a sliced, quartered cucumber.  We made it the night before the party, and the day of added more dressing.  We used more than 16 oz of Italian dressing.  Everyone enjoyed this pasta salad.

Super easy and delicious. Nice to eat on a warm day. I have made this multiple times. My BF says he loves it because it's like eating pizza. That's sort of what the flavors come together as when you eat it. We put a small amount of Italian dressing just to keep the pasta moist, and added chopped spinach or kale some other times. Hardly any dishes after making this which is a plus!

I have made pasta salad several times. This one was a nice change. It makes my normal recipe seem bland in comparison.

I added shredded Parmesan cheese for flavor. This is a complete meal in a bowl or a great side dish.  I served this at a large party and it was a hit.

I was looking for a side salad to bring to a bbq full of meat-eaters.  This salad was the first to go!  I added a little extra of the salami and pepperoni, and some extra pepper jack cheese to supplement the provolone, as well as a handful of finely chopped red onion.  Also, I only had 45 minutes to prepare it, and I was concerned that the flavors wouldn't have melded.  No one had any idea that I hadn't prepared it a day in advance.  The Italian dressing is the way to go!  All in all, this was a hit, and my new go-to!!

I left out the provolone and swapped salami with 97% Fat Free ham. It's amazing!! I make a huge bowl and leave the Italian Dressing off till I dish it out. That allows it to be in the fridge for days without going bad.

Added 1/4 chopped red onion, and used approximately 10 oz Italian dressing versus the 8 in the recipe.  Really good and flavorful and makes a nice light meal with all food groups included.

Very flexible recipe that provides a good base that you can build/change as you see fit.  Honestly I swapped so many things in and out it really isn't for for me to say too much. Personally though, the oil amount was just right for us.  I did add roasted peppers and pepperocini's  instead of green pepper (and ham instead of salami, penne instead of rotini, etc you get the point). Thanks for this recipe, will make again.

Not exactly a hard recipe to master. A great dish for any occasion! I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck and had multiple requests to make it for our Christmas potluck. Only changes I made were using mozzarella cheese instead of provolone and no pimentos. It was a hit and I will be making this dish much more frequently now. yum!

Yes this one is a keeper!  It is delicious in the summer time but needed some lunch options over the holidays and it made a nice change up from all the heavy ham, gravy and turkey options.  Fantastic all the way around. Thanks so much for the submission.

All the ingredients come together for a nice, unique pasta salad. The taste never quite popped enough for me, but I think using a favorite dressing would bring more flavor this this!

Just used salami as that was all we had, and used cheddar instead of provolone for the same reason, but this was a hit and goes well with any BBQ meat.

This is very good. Will make again. I left out the pimentos , added some dried oregano and basil. Used mozzarella instead of provolone as this is what I already had. Also used part Garlic Expressions  vinaigrette salad dressing and part Italian dressing. Shout out to my niece Melissa for sharing info on Garlc Expressions.

Super easy recipe!  I omitted the olives and pimento for my liking.   I always use Wishbone Robusto Italian dressing for all my salad dishes because it has extra bite and flavor.   I thought this turned out very tasty.

We made this tonight and it is great.  We did put a St. Louis twist to this by using Imo's Dressing (which is a St. Louis Pizza place) instead of Italian Dressing and it turn out great.  So if you are from the St. Louis area try it this way, the taste is great.

This is a great basic and very flexible recipe.  I usually fry some shrimp in oil with garlic and red pepper flakes and add that.  Also I cut up broccoli crowns and stems, steam or boil them with the pasta and add those.  Also good are those artichoke pieces that come in jars, sun dried tomatoes,  and parmesan cheese.

I made it with the changes that "I'M NUTS TOO" suggested, except I bought a bottle of Olive Garden Salad dressing.  FANTASTIC!

I used garden tomatoes, both cherry and full sized ones cut up. I only had pepperoni and mozzarella so that's what I used. I also substituted bow-tie pasta for the spiral pasta. Turned out VERY yummy! I will make this again!

I personally would have liked a more flavorful taste, and hence should have added more of the Italian Dressing, but my friends thought it was wonderful and kept going back for more. I might even try changing the brand of dressing to Kens. It's a little more expensive, but it's also worth it.

Made it yesterday for a family gathering and it was a huge hit! I followed some of the suggestions from others who made this dish.  I added mozzarella along with the provolone.  I added zucchini as well.  When I served it I had additional dressing available for those who wanted to add some and parmesan cheese for topping.  I will make this again, it will be a regular salad for me.  It's almost a meal in itself  Thank you!

I made this for a recent summer party and it was a big hit! I liked using yellow , red and  orange peppers instead of green to make it a little sweeter ! Forgot the pimento and used Monterey Jack cheese for my cheese . Also recommend Wish Bone Robusto Italian and plenty of it! It was Delicious!

Easy recipe. I love it. Made it the exactly as recipe state, but only split the dressing. Put half when I made it and the other half right before I served it.

Can't believe no one suggested adding half a jar of McCormicks Salad Supreme to this recipe!   Find it in with the spices in any grocery store.  It adds so much to any pasta   salad!

I made this for my Independence Day cookout. It was fantastic and everyone loved it. I didn't have tomatoes or olives but no one missed them. I did have to add more dressing. A whole box of pasta makes a lot. Probably 20 servings or more with all of the added ingredients. Next time 1/2 a box.

I love this salad. Like others I also add what I have on hand (celery, baby cucumbers, chickpeas, etc.) To make it extra special, my local market has an olive bar. I fill a little container with assorted olives, marinated mushrooms, marinated artichoke, etc. I drain and throw that in. A lot cheaper than having to buy separately! Ohhh so good!

GREAT PASTA SALAD! A few additions include Good Season's dry salad dressing mix added to the cooked pasta and then chilled. Also added chopped celery, chopped zucchini, red instead of green peppers and chopped scallions. No pepperoni but added chopped cooked salami, chopped cheddar, chopped ham. Rest was same. Everyone at picnic enjoyed it.

I used 3 cups Zima golden grape tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes,  and couldn't find a 16 oz box of colored fusili, so I used the plain store brand rotini.  I mixed up some store brand Italian dressing instead of bottled dressing, and EVERYONE LOVED IT!

My wife and I have made this recipe many times.  We think it is wonderful with a "dressing" of your choice.  We also add a head of lettuce (chopped) to the recipe because we like leafy vegetable in our salads.  It seems to go well with the rest of the ingredients we think.

Better on Day 2. Used 16 oz Kraft Zesty Italian + the seasoning pack of Hidden Valley Italian. Tri-Color rotini, grape tomatoes, pepperoni, salami, celery, zuchini, yellow squash, cheddar cheese squares, sugar snap peas. Day 1 was ok salad. Day 2 leftovers were delicious!

I have made this countless times, this recipe is loved by all. After reading many reviews...the good and the not so good. I have added (2) drained jars of marinated artichoke hearts. A reviewer suggested using 1/2 the salad dressing on salad when making this awesome pasta salad and when serving add the other 1/2 of the salad dressing. This way it pasta salad gets that perfect balance of the salad dressing. And I use a Balsamic Vinaigrette from a famous movie star...it's my favorite...a touch of sweetness!  YUMMINESS Plus

Loved this pasta salad. I used tri-colored noodles, I used dry packet Italian dressing that I then made, used sliced black olives, red and green bell peppers, skipped the pepperoni and pimentos.

I used hot pepper rings instead of the pepper, and omitted the salami, but other wise made as directed and was delicious.  I have also made this using only olive oil instead of salad dressing and very good also.

Excellent and very easy. I made just a few minor changes;. I added parmesan cheese and used an entire 16 ounce bottle of Ken's Zesty Italian dressing. I also sprinkled on some salt, and fresh ground pepper. Recipe was delicious.

I omitted the pimentos and olives (just a personal preference).  Substituted pepperjack cheese since that is what I had on hand.  Used grape tomatoes.  Poured the dressing on a couple hours before.  Next time I might make even earlier because it was even better the next day.

Made this last night. It is really good! I used tri-color Rotini pasta and sliced salami and quartered them. I also only used about 6 oz of sliced olives and a couple table spoons of pimento. I  used 16 oz of Wishbone Robusto Italian dressing and finished off my portion of the salad with redpepper flakes and grated parmesan. I will make this again for sure. I am going to add zucchini and red onion next time. ??

Great recipe! I followed the advice of another reviewer and used Ken's Lite Balsamic Vinaigrette which was perfect! I also omitted the olives because I don't like olives and I used finely chopped red bell peppers. Delicious recipe! Thanks!

Didn't follow the portion suggestions- just put in however much of each ingredient I desired. I substituted for feta cheese and it was amazing! I also added some onion. Great recipe! Make sure you add some more dressing right before serving.

This was good, but didn't wow me the way some of these pasta salads have at parties.  I didn't feel like the green pepper fit in, and though I made the night before so it could marinate, I would try a different type of Italian dressing next time as the Kraft Lite Zesty didn't have enough flavor as tastier versions of this salad.  I agree that you need to add a bit of dressing just before serving because it soaks it up!

I made this pasta salad for my son's soccer banquet.  People LOVED it. It made a huge bowl to feed a lot of people. Not only was I asked by several people for the recipe, but I didn't have any left over take home which is is always a good sign.

Tasty. I skipped the olives and pimentos and cut the Italian dressing by about half. I served this as dinner with some bread and butter. It will be really good in the summer.

Such a delicious, full of flavor and colorfully appealing dish! I use purple onions, pepperoni minis AND about a can of garbanzo beans! Garbanzos are an absolute must in my house,  however, depending on how many servings you're making,  a whole can may be too much. It adds a great texture but too many can overwhelming since its a very dry bean. I also use Italian seasoning, red wine vinegar and olive oil in place of Italian dressing.

I made this and really liked it, but I have to agree that it needs more dressing.  I added enough dressing so that it wasn't dry.   The pasta tended to soak up some of the dressing.

I have been making almost the same salad for years.  It is my families favorite in the summertime.  I prefer diced sharp provolone.  I also add mushrooms, green olives and use Ken's Creamy Caesar dressing instead of italian.

This recipe has a good base but it needed a lot to make it great in my opinion. I made exactly as stated for a BBQ early in the summer and it was very bland and I didn't like the dressing. I will make again with changes.

There is a lot of chopping of ingredients but the recipe is easy to make.  It makes a TON, this recipe is good for a large get together.  I made it for a going away party, everyone said they liked it.The only ingredient I did not use was the pimentos. Other wise I followed the recipe to a tee. I had the deli slice the provolone & salami  1/2' thick.  I used Kraft Zesty Italian dressing,  it needs something with a kick and lots of flavor.  If you use a mild dressing it will taste VERY bland....I'm speaking from experience.

I've made this salad twice now and both times it was a huge hit! I left out the pimentos, added some cucumber and used a orange, yellow & green bell pepper for extra color. I made it the night before and used about 1/2 bottle of dressing and then added what remained the next morning. Took it to a potluck at work and it disappeared in no time! Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a 4th of July cookout for family and came home with an empty dish! This is definitely one of our favorites and it's very easy to make. One of the great things about this recipe is that you can pretty much make it using anything you have on hand and it will still be delicious!

First time making this dish and it won't  be the last.  Had to use 2 large tomatoes  instead of cherry tomatoes.  Added green olives and mozzarella  to the mix as well as using  medium shells instead of the spirals.  Full of flavor.  It's  going to be on my table a lot.

I've made this for three separate parties and it's always a hit.   I buy the expensive sharp provolone cheese and good Italian salami so it becomes expensive to make, but people have loved it.   I will probably make it for my next summer party too.  I do add some chopped red onion but it's not necessary. .

This salad is my new staple! I followed the advice from previous reviews and doubled the dressing. I used Good Seasons..added some sugar. I also added Parmesan cheese as well as red onions. Some new advice: upon draining the noodles, place the colander of noodles in the freezer for 20 minutes. This will dry and chill the noodles. It soaks up the dressing right away. I also added Italian seasoning, pepper and garlic salt. This really brings out the flavor.

We made this for a Cub Scout banquet. We used whole wheat penne. We used a robust Italian dressing and added a packet of dry 7 Seas dressing mix. Otherwise it was right to the recipe. Everyone loved it.

This pasta salad is delicious as is, but if you're looking for a little more flavor use 'Robusto" Italian salad dressing, and add in some "McCormick" 'Salad Supreme', which you can find in the spice section.

This WAS awesome!!  I took to a ladies dinner (where apparently EVERYONE ELSE had pasta salad on the brain!)and it was yummy!  It did make a TON so had to pawn some off since I didn't need that much in leftovers but will definitely make again.

First entry was 3/16/12:   
Update:3/25/16:  I used sun-dried tomatoes, Ken's Three Cheese Dressing, spring onions, cucumbers, red, yellow, and orange bell peppers and luncheon turkey meat.  Wonderful dish.

This is a great salad!  My picky guys loved it.  Great for cookouts and can easily be made the day before.  It's now THE pasta salad in my family.

The recipe name fits this dish perfectly, it is so good! I used red and yellow bell pepper as well as the green, because I only had a half of green pepper on hand. I also used grape tomatoes that I halved instead of the cherry tomatoes. Those were the only slight modifications I made, otherwise I didn't change a thing. Great recipe, Desiree!

This recipe was really good, however the amount of italian dressing is not enough if you are going to let the salad sit overnight. At my husband's request, I added some broccoli and some carrots and omitted the olives and pepper. I found that after sitting overnight it was a bit dry, so I suggest adding more italian dressing right before serving so it is to your liking. That's the only reason this received 4 stars instead of 5.

This was wonderful.  I did add 1/3 cup sugar to the dressing. I didn't have any red onions, so just used green onions instead.  The third time I made it I didn't use garlic in the dressing and you couldn't tell the difference.  I HIGHLY recommend this!  I also chopped everything up, including the pepperoni and olives, just makes it easier to fork!

Really lovely pasta salad!  I didn't give it 5 stars because I've changed it a bit - I use tri-color pasta, keep the meat the same, do half provolone cubes and half colby jack (a family favorite) and add olives and use a yellow and a red bell pepper.  Light and delicious any time of year!

I loved this salad.  It's so versatile.
I didn't have pepperoni, so I doubled up on the salami. I used plain old elbow macaroni too and it was great!
Thanks!

Made it to take to a picnic, it was simple and tasted great!  I took other's advice and left out things my family didn't like and added additional cheeses but it would have been great with just what's written.  Thanks!

This is probably a recipe you grow to like more every time you try it.  We liked it but it was different for us.  I had company for supper and they all preferred the other salad I made witch is Sue’s Taco Salad from this site.

Very good.  I added Penzey Spices Salad Elegant seasoning to the Italian dressing before adding to pasta. I used thinly sliced meats, next time I will get the deli to slice thicker, since the meat stuck together.  I also omitted the olives(we do not like them).  Great salad for BBQ, will make again.

I took this pasta salad to a carry in dinner.  It was a hit!!  At least 10 seperate people asked me for the recipe after the dinner, and I am asked from now on to bring in this pasta salad for future dinners.
