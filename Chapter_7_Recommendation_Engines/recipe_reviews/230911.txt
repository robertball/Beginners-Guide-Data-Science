This is a fabulous, fresh-tasting, but simple dessert, that I willbe We had it for Easter dinner and it was a perfect ending to a big meal - not too sweet, not too heavy. Toasting the angel food cake adds a great textural contrast to the  cream and berries, and the citrus in the cream adds a lovely fresh note. Other fruits, such as peaches and blueberries would also be good. Thanks for a new family favourite!

I made a homemade pound cake that I used for this recipe.  The Whipped Topping was so tasty with the berries (I used strawberries, blackberries & raspberries!)  A simple but lovely dessert.
