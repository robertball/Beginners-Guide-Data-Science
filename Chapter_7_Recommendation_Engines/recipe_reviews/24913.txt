I thought this appetizer was simple and extremely tasty.  I decided to double the gorgonzola (and leave out the cheddar and paprika)...I thought the level of blue cheese taste was just right (not overpowering).  I served this with slices of toasted baguette, and with slices of pears (soaked in lemon juice to prevent browning).  I was able to make everything hours in advance, and everyone loved it.  Thanks Sandra.

This recipe was devoured at a recent Christmas party.  It has been requested that I make this for every family get-together from now on.  I had a bottle of Reisling on hand, so that's what I used for the white wine.  Delicious!!  Even those who weren't crazy about bleu cheese loved it.

Not bad. Everyone seemed to like it, at our family christmas get together. I think next time, I will add more gongorzola cheese and a dash more wine.
Rolled it in crushed almonds and pistachios.

I changed it a bit - I added dried cranberries, pecans and a splash of lemon juice - I put it in a small crock and let it sit in the fridge for about 5 hours then served - it was delicious!

I added twice the amount of bleu cheese to the recipe and it turned out fantastic.  The presentation is very pretty and looks like a lot of time went into it.

This is a super cheese ball. It has a definite Greek flavor to it. It's a bit different from your regular cheese balls. The wine adds a great touch.

This appetizer was easy to make and tasted very elegant and delicious.  I used slightly more gorgonzola that the recipe called for. I took this to a wine tasting party at my friend's house, and it was a huge success!

I'm not a huge Gorgonzola fan, but the party ate this right up! Easy to make and great presentation. Was a hit with all the blue cheese fans out there.

Oh my was this amazing! I used a Pinot Grigio that I was sipping as I prepped for Xmas brunch. Tossed in about 2 tablespoons of 2% Velveeta had left over from previous recipes. Never made a cheeseball before though I've been an avid fan of them for years. Didn't know about the elbow grease it takes to properly blend all the stuff together. But turned out absolutely amazing, great flavor. No paprika and couldn't find a small bag or pistachios in the store so rolled in diced walnuts and pecans that were around the house. Could not pry my blue cheese loving grandma away from the cheeseball!

This is going in my best cheeseball file--and there aren't many that make that list!  It is delicious, even my daughter enjoyed it.  I served it with simple&crisp dried apple & pear slices and it was incredible!  The only change I made was subbed dried parsley for the paprika.  MMMmmmm!

Tasty and very lovely. The flavor is pretty much blue cheese however so it limits the audience. A great option for wine tasting and when there are multiple appetizers!

i read the reviews first, then took everyone's advice and added more gorgonzola cheese. I used fresh chopped parsley to give a "christmas look". It was wonderful. I plan on making more to give as gifts!

This recipe is good, but nothing fantastic.  I used more gorgonzola cheese as recommended and was glad I did, but still the cheeseball lacked something.  I used pecans rather than pistachios and that worked out well and are easier to find already chopped at the store.  Overall good, but would not make it again.

This was excellent.  I rolled the cheese ball in chopped pecans, instead of pistachios, right before serving and it was a hit!  I also didn't use the paprika, but again, it didn't matter.  Great recipe!!

The only thing I changed in this recipe was that I used pecans instead of pistachos.  The pecans should have definitely have been toasted but that was my error.  I will try this one again.

If you love blue cheese you will love this recipe.  The sharp white cheddar really compliments the blue cheese.  I used Stilton Blue Cheese and added extra as noted in other reviews.  I also used sharp white cheddar.  Took it to a Christmas party and everyone loved it.  I'm making it again today for two small parties so I'm going to make the full recipe but divide it in half and serve it in small ramekins rather than as a ball.

I made this recipe by the book a day in advance. It's good, just not spectacular. BUT I will add my husband hates blue cheeses but ate  more than a polite bite, which I had not expected at all. Blue cheese is very polarizing but if you follow the recipe it's quite mild. Also I halved the recipe and toasted my pistachios.

Very yummy, I couldn't form it into a ball after just mixing it but I wrapped it in wax paper and twisted each side of the wax like it was a candy inside. It was delicious.

Yumm I think this is great! Giving four stars because I did double the gorgonzola. Lots of flavor and perfect with wine. Used chardonay and make sure to use salted pistachios- a hit- and festive too.

This is so good!!!  It is very easy to make and looks great.  Wonderful combination of flavors.
