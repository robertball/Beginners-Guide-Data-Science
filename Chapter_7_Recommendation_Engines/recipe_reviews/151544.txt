I changed this quite a bit according to what I had on hand: instead of one cup of orange juice, I used the juice from a can of mandarin oranges, some white wine, and some water; I also used roasted garlic chicken broth; and I added frozen french-cut green beans and mandarin oranges at the end. I also removed the chops after browning and sauteed the rice and onions together before adding the liquid and then returning the chops to the pan.

This is good...but I think the next time I make it, I'll use boneless pork chops. The rice was delicious and had a great flavor - I would never have thought of orange juice and chicken stock for cooking liquid, but it was just right. We had this for dinner with broccoli, French bread and a spinach salad - delicious and filling, and most importantly, very very good. Will make again.

The was fantastic!  My pork chops did dry out a bit, so if I had to make any suggestions, it would be to remove the chops to a plate after browning and about 10 minutes before the rice is finished, put them back in the skillet to cook a little longer and rewarm.  The rice tasted absolutely wonderful.  I'll be making this one again, for sure!  Thanks!

After reading the other reviews about this being bland I added 1/8 tsp. crushed rosemary, 1/4 tsp. oregano and 2 tsp. light brown sugar.   I found it to be very tasty.   I used a pork tenderloin cut into medallions (seasoned with garlic pepper before searing) but found that the amount of rice was too much.   Next time I will cut down on the amount of rice.

After reading all the reviews I thought uhoh I should have read these before so I looked in my pantry and found a Lipton Savory Herb and Garlic soup mix and I mixed that in the Chicken broth along with the orange juice and the rice was wonderful.  I bought some expensive chops and I was disppointed they came out dry and tough.  Since I made the changes I only used 2 chops afraid to ruin 4 expensive chops.  All in all I think the dish was good I would make the rice again but use dark meat chicken or turkey.  I also thought about using onion soup mix which I had but went for the Savory!

Would remove the pork chops after browning, they were a little dry. Added more rice for 7 person family should have added more orange juice.

This was wonderful and very easy to make...  My only change was using beef broth instead of chicken because that's what I had.  Will make again.

This was great! I used thinner boneless chops because they were on sale which worked out better because they were easier for my kids to eat. I also didn't use the canned soup to make it Gluten Free. I used Better than Bouillon instead. Whole family loved it.

I made this last night and it was a big hit, we all loved it.  We did add a little soy sauce to the pork chops when served.  I will make again for sure.

I was making this for one, so I really had to do some adjusting.  I added one garlic clove and salt & pepper.  The rice was a bit sweet, but it was a great compliment to the pork.  I imagine this would be even better with boneless chicken and a splash of tequilla :-)

I even seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper before searing them, because I couldn't imagine how bland they'd be without that.  The flavors just didn't meld together and I will definitely never make this again.

Used low sodium broth.  Did not use orange slices as my family does not like fruit on their meat.  Used cooking spray instead of oil

As a meal this is very good but the rice portion is my new go-to side dish (without the chops) Hubby loved it and he hates rice! Great flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  My whole family enjoyed this easy to prepare meal, and this will become a regular dinner option for us.  I might add just a tad less orange juice next time, as it was a little too citrus-y.  Other than that, this was a wonderful meal!

Amazing rice in this tasty dish. I was looking for something quick to throw together with what I had on hand and this recipe came up. I seasoned the pork chops before browning, removing and keeping warm while I prepared the rice. In the small amount of oil that was left I pan fried 2 cloves of  chopped garlic along with the onions  and rice. I browned that for a few minutes before adding the orange juice, low sodium chicken broth and the fresh parsley. I added the chops about 10 minutes before the rice was done so they would not dry out. I left off the orange slices.

I give this a 5 because it gave me the idea. Based on other comments about the meat being dry I switched the order and sautéed the onion and rice first (threw in a couple of chopped cloves of garlic, a jalapeño, and a red bell pepper for flavor and color). Also switched out the OJ for some left over holiday sparkling apple cider. Added more spices, pepper flakes, and it was great.

My husband and I agreed that it was not our favorite pork chop recipe.  I didn't like the orange element, it was either too overpowering or too one-note.  All I could taste was orange juice.

This recipe is good, however i do suggest taking chops out while rice is browning. And I also used a bit of pineapple juice to mine as well, very tasty!!
