This is a fabulous recipe! I have made it twice now and it gets better and better! The sauce makes enough so that you can serve it with rice or broad egg noodles and have enough. Very tasty!  I cooked it once on the BBQ as recommended and the last time in the oven at 375 and it turned out just as well.

Really enjoyed this, and it turned out to be far easier to make than I expected.  First, I'd just sharpened my knives, the key to an easy job of butterflying any piece of meat.  I used fresh chorizo, so I browned the meat and drained it.  The pork tender was stuffed, tied, and put in the fridge early in the day, as was the cooked sauce.   I used peach salsa (which had a little kick) because it's what was in the fridge...perfect choice for this recipe.  I think this sauce is spectacular and would be great served with chicken, shrimp, and so many other things that it makes my head spin.  Side dishes were Blister Beans and Lime Cilantro Rice from the AR site, and they were prepared in advance as well.  We went to the beach today, came home,  heated up in the micro the beans, rice, and sauce, grilled the rolled pork tenderloin and had an incredible cuban-inspired dinner.  Winner, winner IMO!

The sauce for this looks a little scary but it tastes excellent. I used hot salsa which gave it a great kick. I will definitely be making this again!

I've cooked this recipe at least 3 times. it is good every time! Tonight I cooked the stuffing on a griddle and made the mango salsa mor like a sauce by adding a little more OJ. I grilled some boneless pork chops on a charcoal grill and put the stuffing on top for a few minutes before I pulled them off. Then I placed the sauce on it just before serving. tasty shortcut to this meal.

I would give this 10 stars if they had 'em.  I opted for chopped pepperoni for stuffing (who knew pepperoni could be so upscale?) and it was fabulous.  Just a wonderful blend of flavors, very easy, looks fancy -- you would be happy to get this in a restaurant.  One of my very top favorite recipes from this site.  Thanks!!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  The stuffing inside the pork is just great.  Simple and great.  I was very unsure of the salsa with the mango and orange juice... but after reading the reviews... took a chance.  Loved it.  Everyone who tried it loved it.  This is a simple recipe and is a keeper.

I thought the salsa was absolutely gross and I've had "Mango Salsa" before. However, everyone else who ate dinner that night thought it was a hit. Make what you will of it.

Perhaps my husband cooked it a little too long.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor though.

Very easy and tasty meal for anyone you want to impress!  Used heavy whipping cream and a yellow tail moscato.  The moscato was a little sweeter than what was called, but still was an amazing dish.  Kudos!

this was great!  Served it to a dinner party of friends, got lots of rave reviews.  You can regulate how hot it is by how much chipotle salsa you use and how much chunky regular;  I mixed half and half, and it came out perfect -- tangy but not too hot.  If you like really spicy food, by all means make it all chipotle!  I went a little lighter on the cilantro, just my personal taste. Loved it.  Served with rice with bell peppers, onions, and peas.
