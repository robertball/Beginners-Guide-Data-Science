QUITE YUMMY. I tried as per recipe and topped half with a little cinnamon sugar.. those were better.. it may have been the submitteR used sweetened applesauce.. I cut them an then re-baked for 10 minutes more .. gave a firmer texture.

My family enjoyed my version of this recipe. I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon, plus a little stevia based on other reviews. And I added a peeled,chopped apple. I think you could easily substitute other fruits into this basic recipe. It is a great starting point!

I had apple sauce left over from my yearly canning. I made a double batch and added a bit of cinnamon, cut the squares after 10 minutes and put it back in the oven for another 20 minutes. Easy to make an healthy. I will make thesecagain and I think Iâ€™ll add diced cranberries next time and maybe a bit f vanilla.
