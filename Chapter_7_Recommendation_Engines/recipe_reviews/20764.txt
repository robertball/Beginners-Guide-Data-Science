THIS RECIPE IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. I USED A TURKEY BREAST INSTEAD OF A WHOLE TURKEY TO TRY IT.  NEXT TIME I HAVE DECIDED TO DO THE SPICE RUB THE NIGHT BEFORE AND LET IT MARINATE IN THE REFRIGERATOR.  I USED A REGULAR SMOKER WITH THE HARDWOOD CHARCOAL.  IT WAS VERY MOIST.  THE CHILDREN EVEN ATE SECONDS.  I AM PLANNING TO HAVE IT AT THE CAMP GROUND THIS SUMMER.

My 1st smoked turkey, wonderful! For a 12 lb bird (breast side down)I used a Brinkman Smoke-n-Grill charcoal 2 layer smoker (w/seperate water pan) and soaked hickory chips. No tin foil tenting required! I used 2t dry (vice 2T fresh) spices and did not soak in brine. I let rub sit overnight and got under the skin too! I filled the cavity with celery, carrots, apple and orange qrtrs, discarded when done. I allowed 30-40 mins per lb for cooking, flipping the bird (lol) after 3-4 hours breast side up, adding charcoal as needed. No burning, moist! For bigger birds I recommend using an o/nite brine soak and an indirect heat (barrell type smoker w/seperate fire box) charcoal smoker (~$88 on sale) with a coffee can of water, applejuice, wine, beer whatever! Being my 1st smoked bird, I have nothing to compare it to, soo the **** rating... Try this now!  :)

I loved this recipe.  But I do suggest that you use apple wood.  I have made this throughout the holidays. Everyone loves it.

This made for an incredible Thanksgiving turkey! I used less salt because I used a brine to soak the turkey in for days before cooking.  Its a new Thanksgiving tradition for our family!

I just tried this recipe for Christmas and everyone just loved it!!  It was moist, slightly sweet and delicious! My wife and I decided on this one because it would free up the oven for the pies, cakes and dressing.  I will use my grill from now on when ever we cook turkey.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Perfect. Everyone loved it. We did use a charcol grill and it took a lot more time, but maybe that was because I didn't pay attention to the directions!

I tried this for 4th of July and it came out great. It fed 8 people, and there
weren't a lot of leftovers. This is a good recipe if you don't want to heat
up your kitchen in the summer. It was pretty easy and quite yummy.

This is an outstanding way to cook a turkey.  Everyone raved about it.  I did a trial run with a turkey breast.  It got kind of burned on the bottom because I did not cook it indirectly (used a gas grill).  But the whole bird on Thanksgiving turned out beautiful and tasted even better!

This was really good!  My first time ever smoking a turkey.  I used a breast (just because it was my first time) and basted the first time after 1 hr of cooking w/ 3oz of honey.  After 30 min basted second time w/ 3oz of honey mixed w/ 1Tbs of butter and let it go for another 15 min.  I also used apple chips.  Wonderful will do again!!

Looks good but there is one thing I would recommend, soak the wood chips in water for at least 1 hour.  This will cause more smoke to be produced.

This turkey is excellent!!  I'm not a big turkey fan, I find it too dry (unless it's a Greenberg smoked turkey from Tyler, TX), but this turkey was so juicy and tender!  The meat was falling off the bone.  The flavoring was delicious, thought I might use more honey next time.   It was much easier than I thought it would be, and we followed the directions exactly.  We will definitely be doing this again.  It was worth braving the cold wind to grill outside!

Excellent recipe! I soaked the turkey overnight in a light brine, and I used apple wood chips instead of mesquite, then stuffed the turkey with fuji apples and yellow onions. On my gas grill, the high heat burnt about the first 1/4 inch of the turkey's breast, but it added a whole nother layer of flavour!
Very juicy, and very flavorful! I didn't know turkey could be so good! This will be a tradition in my house.

We used a turkey breast and reduced the total cooking time to 1 hour and 50 minutes. I cut the seasonings and oil in half and rubbed it on the turkey and let it stand for a few hours in the fridge before we cooked it. I wasn't sure that my husband would like the honey roasted on this, but he loved this turkey and it came out moist. It wasn't as tender as I am used to getting with a whole oven roasted bird, but it was very good. Thank you!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe! Last late Summer used this recipe exactly, then the 2nd & 3rd time changed out the mesquite w/applewood & cherrywood wood chips. Excellent all 3 ways, Double the amount of apple & cherry wood chips and increase cooking time by 45minutes..Oh Wow! Excellent in salads and Turkey melt sandwiches also!! :))  mmm good! :)) Love it!

I did this recipe last year and it was great! The only different thing I did was to marinated the turkey overnight. The turkey came out awesome with great flavor. I'am going to do the same thing with this recipe this year.

Nice recipe.  I used peach wood to smoke, and it gave the meat a nice even blend with a subtle finish.  I also prefer wildberry honey over clover honey when using fresh basil.  they compliment each other well.

This turned out delicious, but I think it had more to do with having brined it beforehand and the actual smoking than the basting glaze. Needing to use an aluminum pan made it take a little longer to cook than usual and we didn't feel like the glaze added much flavor at all.

I have made this recipe several times and follow it exactly.  It is totally awesome.  We have made it for at least 25 different people and everyone who tries it loves it.  No changes additions/deletions, etc. needed.  Make it "as is".

I have been making the turkey using this recipe for three years now. Love it comes out great! Instead of using mesquite like it calls for I use apple wood chunks still gives it the great Smokey taste but it way more subtle then mesquite ever can be. Instead of sage we use Rosmary and I stuff the inside of the bird with green apple, red onion, and thyme. Slather it with honey and butter as it's cooking about every hour.

This was so good and easy.  I especially liked the honey glaze.  I just used a weber barbeque with charcoal and wood chips.

I've been making this recipe for about 6 years. It's the only way I'll eat a turkey now. It's become our family tradition.

Too well done folks. Follow the recipe but put a temp probe in Approx. 3/4 inch away from the Breast bone and push it all the way in till it hits the  bone then pull out about 1/2". Remove the turkery @ 160 F. Wrap bird with foil and rest for 20-30 mins. The turkey will still cook to the finish temps of 165f.

I do lots of smoking and cook mostly off from the top of head.  Have my own bee hives etc.  This recipe seemed interesting and followed it close.  doubled the size because I was doing a 26 lb turkey.  The flavor was ok.  would not do it again.  Was using a Treager smoker which worked great.  This is my 3rd time using this smoker.  I have 2 others much larger.  I would think maybe this honey rub would taste better in an oven rather than on a smoker.
