I love this cake, but I made mine a little different. I made regular cake mix and made the filling from scratch. But all in all, this is one of my family's favorite. P.S. I hope you don't mind me adding a picture of my cake.

This is so delicious! Didn't change a thing, perfect as is. Separate your eggs when they are cold and let the egg whites sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. They will have more fluff to them when you whip them. Add sugar only at the end in small amounts at a time.

So good!! Everyone loved this cake. I will absolutely make it again!!! My only recommendation is to use more egg whites for the meringue. It calls for 2 eggs and I used 3, and I was still short.

Everyone loved this cake for me wife's 33 birthday party. The cake was not too sweet. I had to cook it a little bit longer (20 mins) so that the tops would brown. Everyone liked.

I made this for my best friends birthday.  She is a lemon freak.  It turned out amazing.  Im not good at making meringue so that took me two times to get it right to spread on cake.  This cake is so good and you will be the hit of any party.

I am surprised that nobody has mentioned any problems with layering the cake yet. I followed the instructions exactly, and my pie filling kept coming out of the sides. Additionally, the layers were sliding around. So what I did was stake the layers with some chop sticks and stuck it in the fridge for a while, so the pie filling could harden up. After a while the pie filling stopped being pushed out and that is when I put the meringue on. Took the chop sticks out and stuck it in the oven immediately. I was hoping the meringue would seal the pie filling but it didn't. As soon as it got heated up, it was leaking to the bottom of the cake, making the cake look like a mess. Will never make this recipe again.
The only change I made to the recipe was the meringue. I used a recipe that I use for my pie recipe that uses cornstarch, egg whites, sugar, salt, and vanilla extract.

I just used the meringue part of the recipe and it was spectacular. What a beautiful presentaion for a cake! I also used a blow tourch instead of the oven, easier to control browning.

I found this to be challenging and it definitely took a while for the tips of the meringue to brown.  I would probably not make this recipe again.

Very easy recipe (boxed cake, and box of lemon pie filling mix).  I wish it was more lemony though, maybe double the pie filling and double the egg whites to make a fluffier topping.

This was a big hit in my house. I do have to say that I baked this in a 13 x 9 pan and built off that. After it cooled I added the lemon filling and then I topped it with the meringue and finished it in the oven.  After letting it refrigerate several hours we had no problem getting it to come out of the pan in nice square pieces.

We love lemon meringue anything so this was a new twist.  My dad, who lives in another state, even wanted an update when it was done!   I thought the layers were a little too thin so I will use 2 boxes of lemon cake mix next time but it’s all gone and that speaks volumes !!!!

This recipe was a lot of fun and it worked great!  My husband took it to work for his birthday and it was finished within an hour.  I did make my own lemon pie filling though. It was delicious.

I doubled the recipe and made it a 6 layer cake for drama. I also torched my meringue with a brûlée torch.
