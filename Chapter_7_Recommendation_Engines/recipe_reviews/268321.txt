Very simple recipe, but I have to agree with the other review it needs something else to pack a punch. The ribs were tender and best when dipped in the sauce. If I made again I would try adding more ginger and adding corn starch to make more of a glaze after all the cooking is completed.

No changes other than my ribs were bone-in. It was a great recipe. It could have used a little more zing if that's your thing, but the flavor overall is great. I forgot to take a picture, but the presentation was excellent as well!

This was a very good Sunday night dinner. My 7 yo ate it when I wiped off the sauce.  I used Blue Moon beer, added more ginger and garlic plus corn starch at the end.  The cook time was just right.  The meat fell apart perfectly.  To make this a 5 star dish, some spice needs to be added.  Next time I might try adding star anise or Chinese 5 spice (which has star anise & cinnamon in it).  I think that will make this entr√©e fantastic.
