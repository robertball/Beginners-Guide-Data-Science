This recipe is excellent.  I needed a basting sauce so thickened it with 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon cold water.  It thickened to just the right consistency.

This is an excellent sauce. Easy & better than store bought. If you don't have sake use extra mirin.

Very easy and very tastey! The second time I made it I added a pressed clove of garlic and tablespoon of grated ginger to make it my own. It's great the way it is and easy to modify to suit your taste.***I have made this recipe so many times now. It is so quick and full of flavor. It's great for any recipe that calls for teriyaki sauce.

I hate when people rate a recipe when they have changed the recipe even slightly.  Try the recipe first to the letter, then rate it. If you try a recipe and change it, AND dont like it... DONT rate it... This was excellent.  To thicken it I used cornstarch and water.  Go slow though, you dont want it too thick!

I must say, living here in Hawaii, I have never heard of a Teriyaki Sauce without fresh ginger and garlic!  The recipe we use is 1:1 soy sauce and sugar (or splenda if you prefer).  Grate the ginger and garlic to taste (more garlic than ginger) and add a splash of mirin.  Cook until dissolved.  We marinate chicken, beef and even pork in this sauce and it is wonderful.  Sesame seeds are often added as well.

I decided to try this sauce and was  very dissapointed with the taste espcially after seeing the great ratings it received.  Initially I followed the recipe to the letter except i used reduced sodium soy sauce and it was still way too salty!  I ended up doctoring it up by adding quite a bit of water,pineapple orange juice, and sugar to cut the saltiness.  As other reviewers suggested i also added pressed garlic and ginger for flavor.  Thanks but I think i'll keeping looking.

My husband is a diabetic so I made this recipe and subbed 1 T agave nectar ( a diabetic sugar substitute) for the sugar and it came out just fine. Thanks, Kevin

Excellent!  My husband cooked with this sauce...not only did it taste better than anything I tasted in a restaurant but he said it was very easy.  He added corn starch/water mixture to thicken sauce and it was wonderful on steak.

better than anything in the grocery store and a lot more versatile.  a great base to make your own, or simple enough for perfect teriyaki chicken.

Making a marinate at 8:00 in the evening and what? No Teriyaki sauce in the house! Jumped to the AR search and found this wonderful recipe. Believe it or not I had both sake and the mirin in the fridge and had this whipped up in no time! Only change I made was I just zapped it in the microwave for about 20 seconds to warm up the sauce so the sugar would dissolve quicker. Nice flavor plus the price and availability was great! ;-)

No sake but subbed rice wine vinegar and the sauce is excellent.  I've used it as a marinade for chops and a basting sauce for chicken wings.  I quadruple the recipe and keep it in the fridge in a pint jar.  (It won't go bad, promise!) Have used it to season stir fry dishes and even drizzled some onto fried rice. DH is Asian and we both love it.

I didn't have mirin, so I substituted an equal part of sherry. Next time, I think I would add some minced fresh ginger, however. Worked well though with the Amber's Sesame Chicken recipe on this site.

I had cooked a pre-marinated teriyaki pork tenderloin, and they always scream out a desire for a sauce, so I did a quick search and the simplicity of this convinced me. I've had a hard time finding an asian market where I live, but I did manage to find mirin at a local supermarket. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find sake. I simply substituted mirin for the 1/4 cup of sake, substituted honey for sugar, added about 1/4 cup finely chopped scallions, 1 tsp chili garlic sauce, a dash of coriander, ground ginger and pre-made five spice, and about a tsp of corn starch whisked into some reserved soy sauce. While the sauce began to bubble as the starch thickened things, I whisked in about 1/2 Tbsp of toasted sesame seed oil and some orange zest. Once it bubbled for about a minute and a half I removed from the heat and let it sit for another minute. The thickness was perfect, and the taste was absolutely amazing. Once I find some sake locally, I'll be sure to try it with just the four ingredients listed.

I couldn't find my sake so I used all mirin like someone suggested. It tasted great like that. But I also listened to other reviews and added fresh ginger, crushed garlic and dried chili peppers. Very tasty, will make again. Look forward to finding my sake!
Edit: I marinated my cooked meatballs in this and they were a disaster. We ate some because we were hungry, but threw the rest out. Tasted awful. Next time I'll use the sake and not leave the meatballs in the sauce.

Turned out perfect! I made it once just like the recipe states, and then once adding grated ginger and a little crushed garlic. Both were fantastic. I found Mirin Wine at my local HMart store.

Makes a great, light base for doing a quick stir fry, not too sweet and something I think I can tweak as I get more acquainted with the combinations.

Really a great teriyaki sauce. My husband, who was raised Japanese , and is very picky about that kind of thing, loved it. It is a little on the salty side, so I think I'll used low sodium soy sauce next time. I did thicken it with corn starch-great tip, thanks for that one, and I used the sauce to make chicken teriyaki rice bowls. DELICIOUS!

This is a really good, simple base recipe you can play with.  I added approx 1/2 tspn. minced ginger and a clove of pressed garlic to boost the flavour.  I also added 2 Tbspn. fresh crushed pineapple to cut some of the saltiness.

This was great, and much cheaper to make at home than to buy at the store. I had all the ingredients on  hand and thus saved a trip into town for a recipe.

This is straight-forward,  yummy, and easily customizable. I added a teaspoon of minced ginger. You could also add garlic powder or sesame seeds for extra flavor.

Good simple sauce. I chucked in half a tablespoon of soft brown sugar and cooked it down a fair bit to thicken for a dipping sauce. Tasty...

I made the mistake of trying to cook down this sauce in an attempt to thicken it.  It turned out REALLY salty.  I'll try it again as directed but I'll also use low sodium soy sauce and a bit more sugar.

I needed some Teriyaki Sauce at the last minute and this recipe worked out great.  I won't be going back to the bottled stuff anymore.
