This frozen yogurt was delicious! We used 2% Greek yogurt so it would be extra rich and creamy with a nice tang. We didn't have any brandy so we used bourbon instead. It was best right out of the ice cream maker when it was a soft serve consistency. It was so fluffy and creamy! We love making ice cream but this was way easier and a bit healthier ... well at least it was before I mixed a piece of red velvet cake into it, ha! Thanks for this recipe :)

Very easy and very good. Has a tangy taste to it and smooth texture.  Made mine with lowfat vanilla Swiss style yogurt and added a sprinkle of cinnamon also.

I had approximately a cup of pumpkin leftover from another recipe so decided to make this for Thanksgiving dinner.  It got mixed reviews.  I thought it tasted exactly like pumpkin pie.  One person didn't like the sour yogurt taste.  One person thought it was overly spiced.  Others really liked it and asked for the recipe.  I will make this again.  I used regular lowfat vanilla yogurt although I will try with Greek yogurt next time.  I used honey flavored bourbon instead of brandy.  And I used half and half instead of heavy cream.

Why do all the pumpkin ice cream recipes call for canned pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin pie, that already has the spices in it?

I gave it 5 stars. The friends I shared it with, didn't quite like it as much as I did (they didn't care for the fibrous texture). Came out nice and creamy with just enough pumpkin flavor. I did decrease the sugar to 1 cup and substitute granulated sugar for the turbinado (I was out).  Next time I'm going to up the spices a little, and add a couple of drops of orange extract. The one friend who believes he hates frozen yogurt, had no idea it wasn't pumpkin ice cream, and we didn't bother tell him it wasn't.

This was a really yummy treat! I didn't have any heavy cream on hand, so I just used some whole milk and that worked out fine. This tastes a lot like pumpkin pie. Yummy!
