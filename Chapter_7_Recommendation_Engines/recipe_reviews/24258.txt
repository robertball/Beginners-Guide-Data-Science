I read all the other reviews first and after seeing most thought this was somewhat bland, I tried to add additional seasoning to make it a 5, but as  you can see, I thought it was worth less than the 4 stars most others gave it. I used an artisian rye bread and after tossing the bread, along with the onions in the melted butter, transferred it all to a 9x13 and baked it for about 12 minutes. The spices I added to doctor it up a bit were: 1-1 1/2 tsp garlic powder, a pinch of cayenne pepper, a pinch of Durkee Grill Creations Kansas City Style Chicken Seasoning. I also didn't have a full cup of shredded cheddar so I used a mixture of cheddar, swiss, a small block of Velveeta I had left over and some pepper jack (again thinking that would spice things up a bit). It smelled good and looked good, but was just so so at best. Will likely not make again.

I made this for my lunch group at work.  Everyone thought it was very tasty.  The next time I make it I will put more chicken in as I forgot it was there because I couldn't taste it.  Other than that, It's worth trying:)

This was good.  I suggest using a flavored bread - I used Rosemary Olive Bread for the bread cubes.  It gave it an extra flavor boost.  Also, I added onion.

I liked this more than I thought I would. I cut my carrots imto strips, and didn't care for them in the end. Next time, I will definitely shred them as written. Don't be skeptical, try this. It's got everything you need except hot sauce, so get that ready. I used gluten free bread no one was the wiser.  Thank you for the recipe.

My husband and I liked this dish. My 8 year old loved it, while my 11 and 6 year old thought the carrots were "weird" and asked me to leave them out next time...BUT-they all cleaned their plate! I think the carrots add nice texture and color. I had some croutons to get rid of so I used them instead of the bread cubes. I just added a little water to soften them when tossing with butter.

after reading the comments and suggestions I decided to try and make this a little better so I added more chicken,  I also used a few croutons with the bread to add a little more flavor, I added green onion,  some butter beans and spices,  but safe to say I won't make this again.  But on the plus side my 1 year old liked it mainly because it was just a soft mash of mess. :(
