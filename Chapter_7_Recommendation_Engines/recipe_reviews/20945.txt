I had all the ingredients (except the carrots) picked fresh from my garden and waiting for to be used in a new recipe. I cubed and salted the eggplant and then prepared the remaining vegetables. Sauteed everything together low and slow stirring frequently, added salt and red pepper flakes and it was finished. I didn't chill it, just ate some on Multi-Grain Club crackers while still a little warm and it was very delicious. A great us of eggplant.

So tasty!  Surprising how it cooks down to so little, but works great as not only a cold topping for breads but also warm with rice.  A great multipurpose hearty-slash-healthy dish for us vegetarians.

The flavor is great, but it doesn't present so well.  Also, make half a batch for goodness sake!  This would feed an army!

Very tasty. Used orange and yellow peppers since that's what I had on hand and added sliced garlic just because..

I've made this twice now, it's so good and a pretty healthy snack too! Or you could make it a meal and serve it over rice or pasta. Love it, thanks for the delicious recipe  :)

After sauteeing and cooking it down i had to add flavour. So i added one crushed clove of garlic, and some cumin powder and cooked it down some more to meld the flavours. Once off the stove add a bit of olive oil and chill. With my modifications it is much better. I know this changes the recipe into something a little more mediterranean/ indian but it suits my palette better. Try it.

Absolutely delicious! I omit the carrots, since I don't feel they complement the eggplant.  Also reduce oil to 3 Tbsp per eggplant (I usually double the recipe).

Oh my goodness! I was looking for a recipe to use up 1/2 eggplant, 1/2 sweet potato and a red pepper when I came across this recipe.  As you can guess I halved the recipe and substituted shredded sweet potato for the carrots.  Delicious!

Made it exactly as directed, took longer to cook down to the right consistency, maybe 90 minutes. A little bland right off the stove, but delicious and flavorful with all the ingredients present after setting overnight!
Even made it without the red pepper flakes once, still great. I even use it with a thin slice of cheese on a sandwich, I like it that much! Makes a lot though, be ready to have a lot of it (about 8 cups), or make a 1/2 recipe.

Made exactly as stated except used coconut oil as we were out of the other. This is by far the best eggplant recipe I have tried. even better than eggplant parm. I do think it could be made into a stand alone meal with some chickpeas added for protein..keeping it vegan. 5 stars from my 12 yr old son also

Added lemon as overly salty with one teaspoon of salt.   The lemon really pulled the recipe together.

My wife loved it and I thought it was good. But how can something that takes 45 minutes plus 40 minutes plus 1 hour be ready in 2 hours? Is there a magic kitchen like Jack's bean stalk (from "My Cousin, Vinny").

Tasted good but looked unappetizing
