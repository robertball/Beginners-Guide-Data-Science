This was a very tasty dish, even with the few ingredients included. My husband loved it. He rarely tells me anything is good, even though it is, so it was defintely "out of the park" on this one! I added some shredded carrots to mine, and it came out wonderful. I was tempted to add "something else" to it, but left it alone and it turned out great! I do have two words of advice: Drain the fat off of the beef! One should always do this no matter what is being prepared. The fat and grease will get into whatever you are cooking and leave an unpleasant taste and it will come out greasy. Secondly, I highly recommend letting the meat and cabbage filling cool completely before filling the pastry dough. Also, do not unroll the crescent rolls, or dough of your choice, until the moment you are ready to use it. They should both be cold. I found that putting the filling onto the dough while it was still hot/warm began cooking the dough and made it fall apart. Also, a bit of flour on your "assembly area" doesn't hurt either.  I made it with both crescent rolls and buttermilk biscuits, to see if it made a difference. In my opinion, the buttermilk biscuits tasted the best. The crescent rolls kind of overshadowed the meat and cabbage. The biscuits just added a hint of flavor and complemented the meat and cabbage perfectly. I will definitely make this dish again!

use a rolling pin on refridgerator biscuts. works the best, and i've tried crescent rolls and pie crust before w/ this, turned out too sweet or unflavored.  the flaky biscuits work the best for some reason :)

These were great! I made the dough in my bread machine using a slightly sweet roll recipe. For the sausage, I used RB Rice medium. Can't beat RB Rice!! And to make this easier, I used bagged coleslaw. DEFINITELY a time saver. I believe I used quite a bit more than 5 cups, too. Turned out great!!

I made these for a surprise birthday party and they were gobbled up so quickly I wasn't able to try one myself.  I had to beg my husband to let me have a bite of his!  Yum, yum!

I grew up eating these. In my family, we call these "Krautburgers." My mother makes them with large size frozen dinner rolls and serves them with extra butter.  YUM!!!

Good!  I've never had a bierock before but was intrigued by the recipe and am always looking for homemade things for hubby to take to work so he doesn't eat garbage...
The only thing I did different was (like the other reviewer) using frozen dinner rolls.  I just stretched them out with my hands to make big circles and then filled them.  One thing, though - you need more like two tablespoons of filling per circle if you want to end up with 18 (1 1/2 dozen) bierrocks. 
Great recipe and I will make it several times in the future, I'm sure!

This recipe was great.  I did use frozen texas dinner rolls instead of the refridgerator kind.  They were tasty and they have frozen very well.  I take them out the night before and put them in the fridge, then microwave them for about 1.5 min.  Super fast lunch and much more affordable then "hot pockets".

First- I made my own pastry from scratch and it was fantastic and I will not use anything else now. The filling I thought was incredibly bland (I followed the recipe initially and tasted the filling before coming to this conclusion). I wound up adding extra salt, pepper, some garlic, and about 2-3TB of deli mustard. After these fixes, these were outstanding, wonderful pub food delights!

We were looking for something different for lunch, and this sure fit the bill.  These are absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe, and sauteed and refrigerated the filling the night before. I used 85/15 ground beef (rather than lean), and hot italian sausage which added a wonderful flavour without being hot at all. I didn't drain the drippings after sauteeing since the mixture was moist but not runny. I used one 12 oz can of buttermilk biscuits, and rolled each biscuit out to 1/4" thickness. I found the dough easier to work with by keeping the biscuits in the fridge until I was ready to roll them. Cooking time was about 20 minutes and yielded 5 sandwiches.

These turned out nice. Used crescent roll dough and the coleslaw mix with green and purple cabbage and carrots. Only used groung beef and added a bunch of seasoning, garlic, ground mustard, parsely flakes and s/p. Good base recipe for me:)

Loved it! So did my guests :) I did add a dash of vinegar because the filling tasted a bit heavy for my tastes. On top before baking I used Pam cooking spray and sprinkled garlic salt instead of butter. Love love love and will def be making it again.

Not worth the trouble. Took me forever to make these. The filling was ok. Overall the taste was mediocre. I would not make again.

As others have said, had more meat than I was able to stuff into the crescent rolls we used to make this.  Crescent rolls were a great compliment to the meat, but hard to seal before baking.  If I make these again, I'll use a bread packaging that isn't pre-cut so I can better handle wrapping the meat.

Also, we tasted the meat during the simmer, and thought it was a little bland, so we added some lemon juice, vinegar, yellow mustard, carrot slivers (from peeler), chili powder.  It made a noticeable difference to the flavor.  Overall it took us about 2 hours 45 min to prepare, but I had just started dating a girl that wanted to try these, so we had lots of fun while sharing the cooking duties.  The leftovers made a great breakfast!

I did not care for this recipe!!!  I followed the directions, and got way too much meat mixture compared to dough. Thanks for the recipe, but I will not try again.

I feel these were missing something. The filling didn't have much taste when it was hot. Tasted better cold. My husband is German and had never heard of these.  I heard they were polish instead.

We used frozen texas dinner rolls and 2T of filling.  Even making all 24 rolls, we had at least 2C of filling leftover.  These are great straight out of the oven, all crispy and delicious.  But, we didn't like microwaved leftovers as much.  We put a slice of swiss cheese in half of the rolls - haven't tried those yet, but I bet we'll like them.

Very good, I used crescent rolls, which I rolled out kinda thin.  My husband loves these things!  He eats them cold for breakfast.

So good! Made it and it vanished in no time, and My boyfriend and I like how we can eat it on the go in a way .  We can easily bring them to work for lunches (if there are ever any leftovers to bring!)

My family loved these! I made some with bread dough and some with grands biscuits.  The ones made with Grands biscuits were favored.  I added some garlic and worcestershire for a little more flavor the second time I made it.  Good warmed up too!

Never had those so I can't compare it with anything but they came out good.  It was a bit bland side for me and took longer than I expected to roll the dough out and fill the meat. That's been said, I used the fridge flaky rolls so it was easy to prep the dough and now I know what it is, I can tweak the filling to however I like. I think it's a very versatile recipe so I will definitely make my version again. By the way, I made half of filling and used 2 cans of Pillsbury's Grands Buttermilk Biscuits, filled each biscuit with about 2 tbs of meat and it was perfect.

I made this for my family tonight and they were really good! I used canned biscuits  and added grated carrots, grated cheddar cheese and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  I also brushed some melted butter on top and sprinkled on some garlic salt before putting them in the oven.

This is a great starter recipe, however it is a bit bland for my taste, I use bratwurst for the sausage and add 1 large carrot grated well to the mix along with a bit of liquid smoke and worcestrshire, and about a tablespoon of sugar to the meet mix, along with a healthy dose of fresh ground black pepper. My kids eat them faster than I can make them. But all in all a great recipe for learning how to make them.

Yummy! My mom makes what she called cabbage rolls (which I now know are called Beirrocks) for Xmas eve every year. This was far better. The sausage really adds flavor to it, my mom just used ground beef. Also, hers tended to be too much bread compared to fillings, as the dough rose too much. I used homemade dough from the master pizza dough on this site.  It holds together and gives a much smaller amount of bread. very good!

Delicious! I live in Germany (everyone keeps telling me these aren't German though) and I couldn't find the correct type of dough at the supermarket.  What I needed up finding worked well enough though.  I served these at a dinner party and they were a big hit.  I think they might be improved by adding minced garlic.

I make my own roll dough.  Having made it several times I now add whatever spices I feel like I want that night.  I've added caraway; tonight it was 1 tsp dry mustard and 1 tsp crushed coriander; I'll use dill sometime later.  We love them as is, but adding a couple spices make them even better.

These were great!  I was really surprised how well they held together too.  I added some shredded cheese on the dough before I put on the filling, used biscuit dough and cooked for 19 mins at 375.

I loved this recipe. I used the little cheapie bisquits in a can and they worked great. I think the dinner rolls would take away from the flavor of the meat mixture. A little time consuming but you have so many to put in the freezer. I will say, do not microwave your extras and they get tough, put them in the oven. I may add a little dark beer to the mixture next time and make it a little more German and flavorful.
