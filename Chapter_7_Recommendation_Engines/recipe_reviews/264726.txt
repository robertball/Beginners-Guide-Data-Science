This is a really good quick bread! I substituted 1 cup of all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour and used regular almond milk with 2 tsps of vanilla extract. I think this would also be good with the addition of some cinnamon nutmeg and either walnuts or almonds. Really good bread though and not overly sweet. Definitely would make this again! I made mine in a 9x5" loaf pan and it was perfectly done in 60 minutes at 350.
