this is good, a tad bland. it ended up being really thick and not soupy at all. i think next time ill cut the rice in half and add garlic.

It is one of the best, nothing can compare. I give a great big 5 stars to Corwynn Darkholmetars for submitting this recipe.

Good, but it turned out a little bland.. but maybe that's because I had no tarragon in the house.  Added some garlic and celety salt and it helped.  I must get some 'gon so I can do Darkholme's recipe justice.
