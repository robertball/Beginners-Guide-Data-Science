This recipe tasted fabulous.  Made exactly as written (note: this calls for apple cider, like what you would drink, NOT a.c. vinegar).

The taste of the Apple Cider vinager was a bit too much for me.  I think a cooking wine would have been much better.  My hubby liked it, but I didn't hear him rave about it like he has with other recipes.

Made without Swiss cheese and added two medium shallots.  Used 1-1/2 cup hard apple cider and enjoyed remainder with meal.  Aroma while cooking was AWESOME!  Wife and kids loved it! Me too.

This recipe was delicious!  I used white wine instead of apple cider, I doubled the garlic, omitted the garlic salt, and add some caramelized onions that I had leftover.  Fantastic!  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing.  :)
