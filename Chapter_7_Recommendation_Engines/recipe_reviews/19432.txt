What can I say about a pie made out of beans? It was different. A sweet taste with a texture like pumpkin but a little gritty. Unfortunately, the next day the side effects were not worth the trouble.

I don't know if I did something wrong or not, but this was just awful.  It tasted more like a pinto bean pie instead of a dessert.  I was hoping it would be like the Muslim pie my Mom used to by in Downtown Atlanta.  Won't be making it again.

This was a good pie.  It wasn't too sweet, and I substitued half of the sugar with splenda.  I think it was a little dry, though, so perhaps adding a little milk might make it more custard-like.
