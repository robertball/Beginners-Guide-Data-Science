I made two slight changes.  I wanted to use up some Italian cheeses I had on hand so I probably added a little more cheese than was required in the recipe.  The mixture was very soft, so I dropped a cookie scoop of the rice mixture into the flour and gently shaped it and chilled it in the refrigerator to firm.  I then rolled it in the egg and bread crumbs and chilled again.  These came out beautifully.  They were cheesy and delicious.  Thanks Jan for sharing!

Loved this!!  I changed it up a bit. The first batch I made with vegan American shredded in and the second batch I made with mozzarella cheese.  Then I decided to add some cooked ground turkey in the middle of my third batch.  My fianc√© said these were the best things I've ever cooked.  Wasn't sure if that was a compliment or an insult considering how easy and fattening these are. But I must admit, they're great!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!
