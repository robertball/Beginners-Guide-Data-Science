Do I dare say this recipe is foolproof? I made it and it turned out absolutely flawless it must be. The only change to the recipe I made is that since I don’t have the Xanthium gum I did substitute 1 tablespoon of psyllium husk. I am shocked at how incredibly moist the inside of the bread is, the crust has a gorgeous sheen and it slices like butter but doesn’t fall apart. Best of all,  it doesn’t taste like eggs at all which is what I was fearing the most. I will definitely be making this recipe over and over, I’m so grateful for a keto recipes that taste good and I’m pretty sure my kids will eat this.

I added an egg and used chia seed in place of xanthum ( however its spelled) gum.  I LOVE it I now make it about once a week.

I've tried a few low carb bread recipes, this is by far the best. Moist and  holds together. Not normal bread, but it works for lchf.

This is the 3rd time I have made this bread. The first time I used Chis seeds and the last two times I used 1tsp of vanilla. I didn't have Parchment paper the last two times I made it, so I greased the pan with Olive oil. Did not stick and slipped out of the pan. Bottom and sides of bread had a great golden colour. My fiancé loves this and I will continue to make it.

Definitely one of the best keto bread recipes. I've made it a few times and I have added cheese, caraway, black pepper etc you can mix it up! I add psyllium husk instead of the gum. the more you beat, the better the batter. parchment paper is a must!

Well as far as Keto breads go it was not the best I have made, albeit, it was the only one that I have tried in a loaf form. It tasted like straight up eggs with an almond flourish texture. When it came out of the oven it smelled like baked eggs, like an eggy quiche or German pancakes. It does not toast well and adds a funky flavor to everything you eat it with. it is super heavy in calories too. if you are on a 2,600 calorie keto diet plan it may be fine but I am on a reduced plan of about 1700 and each slice is like 280 calories if you make 12 slices. so to make a sandwich it is a third of my daily calorie count before sandwich filling. All in all it has a good form and okayish texture, and the recipe is good as far as directions and ingedients but I didn't like the taste or calorie density of this one.

Used only 4 eggs, 1/4 unsweetened applesauce, 3 Tablespoons water, 3 Tablespoons canola oil and an extra 2 teaspoons baking powder. I realize this is not strict keto bread after my modifications but it’s still low carb and I really really wanted a ‘bread’ I could use for toast and sandwiches that closely resembled real bread. Im happy!

This was really good for keto bread.  I added some cream cheese to it to make it a little lighter and it turned out well.  I only used 6 eggs, to cut down the egg taste, and threw in some fennel seed for a little spice.  I used this for sandwiches and ate it directly as toast.  I'll definitely make it again.  This recipe is just a base for bread.  It can be so easily modified and is quick to make.

I used hazelnut meal flour instead of almond flour. I used 5 eggs and 2 egg whites, a little milled flax seed and 2 tsp baking powder. It is delicious. Great for Keto & Paleo.

We love love this recipe! I’ve made it a few times. It tastes like a mild corn bread to us. Very simple, I follow the recipe exactly every time and it’s always perfect. We like it with our low carb entrees like soup but I have made grilled cheese sandwiches with it as well. It’s not very high though, like regular bread.

This is an easy to make bread. I like the flavor, and it is great on a ketogenic diet. The only thing I will do different next time, is to grease the pan better. I used parchment paper , but the places that weren't covered well stuck.

My husband (Mr. I Need Carbs) declared this a keeper. It’s light and very cake like in texture and I’m looking forward to experimenting with it for more than basic bread. Two caveats: we’re used to almond flour’s texture from a paleo pancake mix and I added an extra egg by mistake. It turned out so well I’ll stick with 8. My eggs are free range from my backyard so I love to put them to good use.

While it looked like potato bread when it was done, it was so dense in flavor, texture, and appearance. It’s got a heavy egg-y taste. There are better tasting keto breads out there requiring less ingredients and eggs than this one.

I probably shouldn't rate this because I just started keto a week ago and this was the first bread-like product I've tried. It definitely looks like bread, and the cooking time was perfect. But it was so eggy. I made a grilled cheese and still couldn't get over the taste & texture. It would probably be good as French toast! Thanks for the recipe, it was worth a try. And from what I've read, all keto-friendly breads are kind of like this. I'll keep searching :)

Finally a Keto bread recipe that actually 'looks' like a loaf of bread.  Very moist, slices nicely, doesn't fall apart.  I can imagine this with possibly made into a cinnamon swirl bread for something different.

This bread helped satisfy my carb cravings.  It's good, especially toasted with peanut butter.  It has a heavy egg taste, which I didn't care for, but overall it was tasty.  I'm going to try it with egg whites instead of whole eggs next time (or maybe 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites).

First try at this.  Turned out much better than I expected.  Not a close textured as I would have expected and had a nice dome that didn't collapse.  I whipped the eggs for about 4 min to get them nice and fluffy which is a bit longer than the recipe called for.  Baked for 40 min instead of 45 as well.  It is very delicate, but doesn't fall apart and tastes delicious!  Will do again.  Might add a bit of cinnamon/vanilla/stevia and see how it goes.

I added 2 ounces of coconot flour for more thickening and 1/4th cup of stevia.
This is the 3rd time I make this and it's the best out there.
Thank you.

I was a little disappointed. I expected something more like bread. This was more like a large soft Chinese almond cookie. I liked it but it would not serve as something to Make a sandwich with. But as a dinner roll it will be great with a little butter. I also found it to be a little greasy so I would cut back on the oil next time. I will definitely make it again at least once a week.

Fabulous recipe, I didn’t use coconut oil used olive oil instead. The mixer really helped to make it moist and rise, also the eggs at room temp. We’d been dying for toast in the morning after three weeks with no bread and today we enjoyed a slice! I highly recommend l!

I stuck to the recipe.  I did use Pam spray instead of parchment paper and it came out beautifully.  I agree with those who said it tastes kind of like a light cornbread.  My granddaughter said it tasted like french toast before syrup.  I would agree with that as well. It is not dry. Slices well.  I can't wait to try it toasted!  I will be making this recipe again.

Very buttery, soft and moist. Does not last very long in the bread box.

pretty easy to make.  came out looking beautiful. I had nuts on top. However, the bread tasted like I was eating scrapped eggs. Super eggy aftertaste. Yuck. Not my kind of bread.  Really greasy too. Disappointing. Try egg whites only and cut the oils in half.

This is saving my keto lifestyle! Hurray for or toast and samachies! It's moist and buttery and has a nice lightly crunchy crust. I add 1/4 cup each sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds for crunch and volume. I plan on using this as a base for other kinds of bread, like blueberry and bannna loaves by adding a mix of stevia and eurthynol to sweeten.

I just started keto, and I don’t think I can go without bread, so I tried this and it is pretty good! So easy!

Loved this. I was craving a sandwich and was afraid this was not going to taste as good as what I was craving. It was spot on, great flavor, moist and I will probably be making it every few days. Thank you!!!

In all honesty, it tasted like what Dawn dish soap smells like. Eating this "bread" makes me miss real bread even more than I already did.

Uhhh...  I am somewhere between 2 and 3 on this one.  I don't love it, but I will probably eat it anyway.

I was hoping to LOVE this recipe.  One of the main comments people made was that it tastes too eggy.  I didn't think I would mind that, but woah, it is SUPER EGGY!  It almost makes me gag a little!  I'm sad, because almond flour is expensive, and it took time and effort to make.

The texture is *amazing*, that I will give it.  If it didn't taste so egg-y it would get five starts from me, easily!

I made this recipe as written, except one egg yolk I left out. This recipe was great. Moist texture and did not fall apart at all. I beat my eggs really well and they were frothy like the directions say. My husband did not like it (too bland) So next time I will add a sugar free extract like almond or vanilla. My only complaint was I only left it on the counter a few days and it quickly went bad. Next time I will store it in the fridge.

This came out perfectly, just as the recipe reads. I’ve tried several bread recipes for a keto diet, and none came close to this! Love it toasted with butter...  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly. The texture was ok but the taste was bland and the eggs were overpowering. The only thing I could do with this bread that would complement the taste, was put eggs and cheese on it.

So from what I see in the pictures, I'm guessing everyone used almond 'meal', not almond flour.  The almond flour I used was listed as 'fine', so my bread looks like a short pound cake, but of course doesn't taste sweet, so back to the drawing board to make it with almond meal and see if that changes things.  The pictures on here look nothing like my end result.
