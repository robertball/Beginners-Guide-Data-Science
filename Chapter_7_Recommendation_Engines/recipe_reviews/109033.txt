This recipe is great for what it is... molasses bread. It tastes like molasses. My kids love molasses and love the bread. Hubby doesn't. It is fast and easy to make and has a nice texture. I made a double recipe and subbed for brown rice flour to make it gluten free.

I made this as cupcakes - baking for 20 minutes. The recipe is good. In terms of adapting for cupcakes the caramel sauce/frosting is very tasty but it's not a good one for cupcakes since it's very drippy.

Good. I recalculated the recipe to 4 servings.That really worked well saves ingredients and makes just enough to sample. The reason for three stars was that I was looking for a recipe that was more like my grandma's sweet bread.

I followed the recipe to a T and it did no go well for me. I thought that 1 hour baking was a little too much so decided to check after only 45 minutes (just as it started to smell like something was burning). The cake was already over baked. The result was super dense (yay!) but dryer than it should have been. The taste is good not too sweet so I think the recipe has potential but the baking time was really off.
