Very good- and easier than I thought (considering that I didn't have any cheesecloth!!!)  I added herbs, garlic  and a little more salt and spread it on German-style "black bread." I cannot wait to embark on more cheese-making adventures!!!
PS
a note for others, if your milk doesn't coagulate well, you have the choice of returning to heat or adding more vinegar- in view of the fact that the extra vinegar will alter the flavor, I went for more heat.  If you save the whey you can make ricotta! (1/4 cup of vinegar for 2 gallons of whey)

I can't say anything about these exact directions...but the recipe itself is great.  I just went to a cheesemaking class and these were the exact ingredients in the cheese we made.  We didn't put the salt in until after the cheese had drained, mixing it into the cheese, not the milk.  We also only went to 180 degrees temp.  The fresh cheese is VERY good.  I suggest mixing in a bit of pepper and herbs for a wonderful, spreadable herbed cheese - great on breads or crackers.

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!  I live in Korea and am not able to get cottage cheese here.  This was sooo easy and yummy.  I plan to use it in lasagna tomorrow.  I do not have a thermometer so I watched for it to just start to boil. Stirred just once during boiling time (which I did on the lowest temp of a gas range).  When it started to boil I shut it off and added the vinegar let it sit for 10 min., stirred again and saw the yellow whey.  Used two knee highs (new), one inside the other drained and squeezed.  Added salt to taste after draining and squeezing(not to milk) and presto!!  Wonderful!!  Thanks!!

A cheese lover at heart, I was so excited when I saw this recipe.  Unfortunately, we don't have any cheesecloth, but I found that an old, clean pair of pantyhose does the trick just as well.  It yielded a ricotta-style cheese that would be good in filled pasta.  Not much flavor, though, so consider doctoring it up to your liking. Mine was done in about 45 minutes.

I used this same recipe and really like it as an introduction to cheese-making. After I drained it I added a little kosher salt and some minced garlic. My 15-month old really loves it! She does a happy dance each time she eats it.

This was pretty neat to try. I have made homemade butter, but never tried homemade cheese. I was uncertain whether the recipe would work, so I used the calculate button and changed it to 6 servings. That equalled 4 cups of milk. However, I only got a dissapointing 1/2 cup of cheese (So, I am assuming the full recipe would yield about 2 cups). I used white vinegar and I saved the milk whey left, because I couldn't really taste the vinegar or salt in it. I can use it in another recipe, I believe. I cooked the milk on medium, so it didn't burn, but still continued to stir it. It took about 15 minutes to get up to temperature. I also let the vinegar sit in the milk for 15 minutes, to see if I could get more of it turn. The taste reminds me a little of fresh mozzarella, while the texture reminds me somewhat of ricotta. It was so much less salty than store bought cheese. I only had 2% milk, and believe I may have yielded a little more with the whole milk. I would like to try this again with 4 cups of whole milk or cream. If I do, I will report back the results. ty

Thanks for the recipe!  Fun to make and delicious.  It's a great feeling to know what is in your food.  Used organic whole milk and apple cider vinegar.  I agree with another reviewer who mentioned the strong taste of the cider vinegar.  Not at noticeable once you add seasonings and herbs though.  Not 100% sure if I did everything right...brought the milk almost to a boil put in the vinegar and it didn't make a lot of curds.  Poured it through the cheesecloth and the liquid still looked very much like milk not whey so I brought it to a slow boil added a little vinegar again and it curdled immediately.  So I made one ball of very creamy and one ball of firmer cheese.  Mixed them together and seasoned...turned out delicious!  I'll be making this again and again!

Awesome! I used white vinegar and the cheese doesn't taste like vinegar at all. My whey seemed milky looking the first time, so I reheated just the whey again to 195, added 1/8 c more vinegar and made about a cup of firmer more set up cheese from what I missed the first time! It even didn't taste like vinegar. The whey came out totally clear and yellowish after that. Thanks so much for posting this great recipe!

Great recipe and so easy.  One thing to be aware of is to look for milk that is not ULTRA pasteurized.  The ULTRA pasteurized will not yield nearly as much cheese as simply pasteurized whole milk.  I have added bits of leftover cream, buttermilk, and the like, to this with equal success. You can also add a drop of rennet - animal or vegetable kinds it does not matter - and it will help the process along.  Especially if   ultra pasteurized milk is your only option.

Really easy to do and tasty! UPDATE: While doing a little cheese making research on the internet, it came to my attention that this is probably closer to 'queso blanco' (acid used is vinegar or lemon juice) than 'queso fresco' (made with rennet).

Great recipe. I was so eager to try it and I only had 1 cup of milk in the house. I am a novice and it turned out great. I ahd to reboil it but I got cheese. I love this and so do my children. Not sure I will buy cheese from the store anymore. I've been making smaller 32 ounce milk batches and getting the hang of it.  It's very very easy.   It's also so versatile.

This was fantastic! I never knew making cheese could be so easy. Used this recipe to replace the ricotta cheese in "Baked Ziti II." Makes about 2 cups of cheese.

YUM, this was great! I did have a slight issue though...I brought my milk up tp temp. (so I thought), removed from heat and added in the white vinegar, as stated. Let it set for 10 minutes, but there were hardly any curds. I allowed it to set 5-10 mins. more, but still very few curds. I sort of started to panic, but figured if it's ruined, it's ruined, so I might as well try heating it again and see if that helps. Well, that did the trick! All of the curds formed and seperated from the whey perfectly. I then added the salt and proceeded w/ draining the cheese...Perfect! I do feel that this needs more salt, but I just added some in after it drained and that was fine. I'm only saying what happened in case anyone else has an issue like that they will know what to do. I think my thermometer may be off and that was the problem, so it was no fault of the recipe. Now I just need to decide how to use up this delicious homemade ricotta!? I will def be making this again...it's just too simple not to! Thanks for sharing. :)

we tried this according to the recipe.  it did not work.  after we determined that it was essentially a waste, we decided to experiment to see if we could get it to turn out. after adding a lot more vinegar than called for, and waiting overnight before straining, it was not a bad bowl of cheese.

Very neat experience! I halved the recipe. From 8 cups of 1% milk I got 1 cup of cheese after squeezing it in the cloth. It is bland but a good base to add whatever flavours or spices. I will be making this again. Thank you.

I had a half-gallon of water buffalo milk (yep, that's right) in the refrigerator that was getting close to its expiration.  I used a thermometer, and guesstimated at the vinegar, since it was about 10 cups of milk.  It curdled right away, and I added garlic salt and this herb mix my son had, and it was pretty good, a little rubbery perhaps(maybe too much vinegar?) Without the added flavors it would be pretty bland, though.  I am saving the liquid whey I drained off and will use it in making bread in place of water.  Whey is very high protein.

I've made this. Very good. But oh my goodness, discard the whey?  Noooooo! SO many things you can use this, you make ricotta with whey. Google how to use left over whey, 100s of uses. There is sweet whey and acid whey. This whey is considered acid since vinegar was used. Chickens LOVE it and so do dogs and cats by the way.

This will be my first Allrecipes review because I just HAD to! This cheese is incredible and SO simple. I'm so happy we can just make our own cheese at home and flavor it any way we want! My 5 and 7 year old learned about cheese making, had a blast making it and LOVED the results! My daughter has been eating it with a spoon all night! We used just your average gallon of whole milk from the store and it worked perfectly. We probably added an extra two tablespoons of vinegar to make sure we got all of the curd. After the cheese was all done we added a generous amount of salt and it was great just like that. For fun I sautéed a bit of garlic (just the jarred kind), and chopped up a sprig of rosemary. Added those to the cheese, mixed it up and it was INCREDIBLE! We can't get enough! So excited to use this and try different herb variations. The ease of this makes it 100% worth it! Thank you so much for this recipe! We will be using it often!

This is a very good recipe but it is not Mexican Queso Fresco. QF requires renet. This is cottage cheese and a good one. Seriously easy to make and well worth the 30 minutes you spend doing so!

Yummy! I use this to make stuffed shells and with lasagna - it was a little messy to drain, but I think the second go-around will be better. Thanks!

Excellent! Easy to make... I needed to add a slight bit more vinegar to make the milk turn. My family liked it so well in my lasagna that I will have to make home made cheese every time.  Super yummy!

Easy. Great way to use past date milk.

Add in herbs if desired. Chives, dill, celery seed...

I used fresh farm milk, salt and vinegar. This brought back memories as I haven't made cottage cheese in 35 years! The outcome was very good, but not as good as I remembered from years ago. I will make this again, but I won't wait 35 years to do it again.

Throw away the whey!  Nevah!  feed it to your dogs or use it in your garden but never throw away... great source of minerals and enzymes - I drink it myself.  The cheese in this recipe is pretty mild so I dress it up with some fresh garlic scapes or chives - sometimes rosemary and thyme and olive oil.  It
's amazing with scrambled eggs or on a tortilla...

Have made several times with no problem. Showed my sister how at Christmas an after I addd the vinegar very little happened.  I know I let the milk get to hot.  Let it cool added more vinegar and presto cheese.  Very forgiving recipe. My sister is hooked on it

Nice easy cheese.  But don't throw away your whey.  You can make ricotta out of it.
My Italian Grandmother used to do this.

I have been using this recipe for several years now. The biggist change I have made to it is to use Lemmon juice instead of vinegar.

This was super easy to make, even though I used coffee filters in place of cheesecloth, and I did half the recipe because I was unsure of how it would turn out. I now see that the flavour came out a bit blah, so next time I will season it with herbs/garlic/etc.

Excellent and simple.  Try chopping fresh herbs and mixing in before hanging to drain!

This worked out great, though I didn't realize how long it would take for the milk to heat.  I will read through reviews to see if a higher, faster heat would have been more efficient?  With a medium heat it still scorched a little on the bottom, but nothing I couldn't remove (I stirred a LOT).  I did not need cheese cloth, using a fine mesh strainer instead.  I added pink salt after the cheese had drained, before forming it.
