Step 2 says, Combine ham bone and 8 cups water in a large saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat until remaining meat falls off the bone, about 2 hours. Remove and discard bone. Use a slotted spoon to transfer meat to a bowl.

So what are you supposed to do with the stock. the instructions doesn't say. Are you supposed to retain it and use it in the soup???

To Tim ~ And those who have had the occasional hard bean problem with the  quick soak method. You mentioned that the beans needed the over night soak because the quick boil and simmer method did't get the beans soft enough and some of them were still a bit hard.  I have had this problem as well before and I realized that I needed to only bring them to a rapid boil for 1 min making sure there is  enough water for the beans to absorb and then some for the soak, you CAN'T add more latter ~  Then remove from heat and cover with a tight  lid to soak for 2 hrs  There should be plenty of water to drain after the soak . When you get to the part where you want to simmer be sure the liquid is bubbling slowly not boiling and then just check for tenderness  every 1/2 hr  until done. and that's it ! Believe me I have had the hard bean issue and cooked them for what seemed like forever and they did not soften so I know how frustrating it can be. I hope my advice helps you and never have  to deal with the occasional hard bean ever again ~

I've also added some bacon drippings to this recipe, very hearty and satisfying on a winter day.

The first time I made this, following the recipe, on the stovetop. This time, I made it in my instant pot. I did the quick soak of the beans stovetop. I cooked a smoked ham shank with water and  Tbl of BTB for 90 minutes, while beans were soaking. I also sautéed the onions and celery stovetop. 
I used the basket insert for the shank, so it’d be easier to remove. When done, I picked the meat off the bone (lots), added it back into the pot with my onions, celery, and rinsed beans. I added a bay leaf, a sprig of thyme from the garden, and 1/2t of celery seeds. Cooked for 30 minutes on high pressure, NPR for 10, added the carrots and cooked another 8.  I let it NPR for 20+. Fabulous.

Wonderful soup.  I have made with dried limas when I have the time.  When pressed for time, canned butter beans are also excellent.  Ham is wonderful.  I have also made with bacon which I cook completely and then freeze so it is available.  You can just chop up frozen pre-cooked bacon and throw it right into the soup pot.  Since celery, carrots and onions last a long time in the fridge/pantry, this is a go to recipe when the grocery supplies are dwindling. 
 Sometimes I add celery seed, thyme leaves and/or bay leaves.  I always add a teaspoon of sugar and a tiny splash of cider vinegar.  I usually use half chicken broth and half water.

I used turkey ham, instead of regular ham, used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Very filling and easy, if you are a Weight Watchers it is very low point value.

It was wonderful, and tasted like how my mom used to make it (can't find that recipe).  It was a big hit with my wife and kids.  Couldn't find a butcher who had a ham bone - so I used ham hocks and retained the water as the base for the soup and I used the center meat in addition to packaged diced ham.  I also added a couple of cooked & crumbled pieces of bacon.  The onions and celery were obliterated in the process (in a good way).  The lima beans really need an overnight soaking.  The boil & simmer method was okay, but some of the beans were a bit hard.  But it was still awesome.

My Southern grandmother made this soup for me growing up. The nostalgia points are high. I don’t have her actual recipe but this one seemed to be the closest. And it tastes spot on. It’s just perfect. I use 2 ham hocks and make my broth in the instant pot then transfer it to the stove for the rest. I’m sure I could do the whole thing in the instant pot but cooking it on the stove is like a big hug. 

This is a simple recipe but since it’s takes about 4 hours I don’t cook it often. It’s such a special treat when I do.
