These came out really cute! I used strawberry marshmallows for the ears instead of regular white, sixlets for eyes and nose (candy coated chocolate pieces), & chocolate jimmies for whiskers. I used vanilla canned frosting tinted pink for the base layer that I piped on. For the face I used whipped white icing which seemed to work nice and appeared very smooth being it was put on with a spoon. I did not use egg whites as the recipe states, the cake mix called for whole eggs. I recommend storing these in the refrigerator, the frosting has a tendency to "slide" off the cupcakes after a few hours sitting out, because it's heavy. I would definitely make these again!

These are so cute!  My 5 and 3 year old worked on them and they looked so nice.  We just used a box mix and store frosting with food coloring. Would definately use for a school bake sale or preschool class treat.

These turned out adorable!  They were simple enough for my 5 and 2 yr olds to help and yet the end result still looks impressive.  The only suggestion I would make is to be careful when cutting the marshmallow, do not cut 5 slices as directed.  I would recommend 4 slices so they are thick enough to stand and not flop.  My kids said they want to make these every Easter.  Thanks for the idea!

Great recipe! Always a fun surprise. My favorite cupcakes to make with bunnies are angel food cupcakes. To save a bit of time with the decorating I use store frosting with a dab of food coloring. I also dip the sliced marshmallows into the the pink frosting instead of bothering with coloring sugar. Looks fantastic!

Easy and fun to make. I used tub icing and added some powdered sugar to thicken it up a bit, then I piped it on the cupcakes using a decorators tip.
