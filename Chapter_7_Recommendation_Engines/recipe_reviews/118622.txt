We didn't have bbq sauce so we used Jack Daniels Steak Sauce and used regular ranch dressing and these came out so good! They were spicy enough without the dressing so I wouldn't bother with the original.
I recommend not charring the peppers completely or else they just fall apart when you seed and stuff them.
