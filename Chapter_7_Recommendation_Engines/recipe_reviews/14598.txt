I made this the other night because we all had a busy day I did not know what to make.  I looked in the freezer and found I had some ground beef so I searched for a recipe and this one sounded interesting.   To my surprise I had all the ingriendients except for the green pepper so i just omitted it and it was great!   Very flavorful and a cinch to make!   Even if you hate to cook you can have a very nice meal in about 30 minutes that yoour family will enjoy!   This is wonderful inthe winter because it is almost considered a stew.  I also served this with fresh homemade corn bread!

For my husband the name is very fitting.  He didn't like it at all.  To me it was more like decent-a-muck.

I didn’t have green peppers so I used celery, onions, garlic, and carrots, chopped fine and sautéed, and then cooked ground beef until no longer pink. Then I added one can of diced no-salt tomatoes, one can Pork n’ Beans (didn’t have Ranch Style Beans), and ½ teaspoon kosher salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. I cut some roasted corn off of one cob and added that, then added the sliced potatoes and cooked until tender. I then added my husband’s secret ingredient, 1 tablespoon ketchup plus 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce.  Then added one tablespoon chopped fresh Marjoram and Basil and served. Very good. Though on thinking back, I would have called it, Ground Beef Stew.

We chose to give a litle Mexican flavor to this dish. I took a package of taco seasoning and added it. We deleted the Worcheshire sauce. Delicioso! My husband & I enjoyed this meal very much. Thank you, Cindy!

We really liked this dish, we did make one modification in that we added a half of a packet of speghetti seasoning and it came out great. VERY filling. We may try to get rid of the beans and put in shell noodles next time. Thanks for the recipe.

We made this recipe tonight, and we were very disappointed with the flavor...there was none!!  And it was also very dry, so we added a can of tomato juice and some more seasonings.  It came out just decent.

This was quick and easy to make. I used RoTel tomatoes to give a more spicy flavor, and omitted the potatoes. Served with garlic bread and a salad, makes a good, quick meal. Thanks Cindy!

This is great comfort food. Reminiscent of the hamburger soup my dad used to make. I added a half packet of fajita seasoning I had and used Rotel tomatoes instead of  plain diced tomatoes as suggested by another reviewer. I will make this again and try some other varieties. Just my personal preference, I would have liked a second can of sliced potatoes. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It is quick and easy and contains items most people keep handy!

My husband is responsible for making dinner on Mondays. His culinary skills are limited so his recipe repetoire consists of only grilled cheese sandwiches, spaghetti or mac and cheese. Being tired of those, I asked him to find something new to try. He chose this recipe. It was easy enough for even a beginning cook to make. But it lacked in flavor. And he used seasoned tomatoes and seasoned beans. It was ok. Nothing special. But since it's something different and easy, he will be making this again, just adding some spices to liven it up.
