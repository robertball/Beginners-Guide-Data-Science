Made as written you will end up with a disaster as I did on my first go around. 1 3/4 cups of sauce is entirely too much sauce unless you plan on adding a binder. I made exactly as written the first time and the mixture was so wet that you couldn't even form patties. I stuck it in the freezer for an hour which allowed me to shape them. I moved fast but as soon as they hit the grill they completely disintegrated through the grates on the grill. Total loss. I was determined to make this work so I went out and bought more ingredients the following night. I started with 1/2 cup of sauce, mixed it up, and went from there. I added a couple more splashes and called it good. They were still very wet and loose so out of caution and not willing to waste more, I added 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs. With all of that being said, these were really good. You don't get as much buffalo flavor in the actual burger  the way I did it but there is plenty of the flavor in the dressing. I'm not sure if there was a step or 2 left out during editing or if it was supposed to be 3/4 cup instead of 1 3/4 cups but as it is written right now this just doesn't work. I highly recommend either using a binder or else using way less sauce.
