very nice bread.  Made 2 loaves that were perfect amount of batter.  I didn't have nuts so added a little more coconut and also added some chopped marachino cherries for color and flavor.  Also added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract.  I really didn't measure the banana and pineapple.  Had some pineapple rings in juice leftover in the fridge so just cut the rings into bite size pieces and added the juice.  Had 2 ripe bananas.  Added 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. each cinnamon and nutmeg.  Added just a hint of flavor and was a nice layering of all flavors from the fruits and spice.  Baked up perfectly and rose like a picture.  Nice to give away.

I especially liked that this did not have to be prepared in a bread maker.  I thought it would be similar to King's Hawaiian bread but this was more like a cake.  It's delicious though!  I left out the coconut and walnuts and halved the recipe for one loaf.

WOW!!!  Ok, I made a few changes.  1 3/4 cup butter, 1 3/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cup banana, 20oz can of crushed pineapple, slightly drained.  I used 1 cup 10grain flour, 1 cup quinoa flour and 2 cups white.  I also added 1tsp coconut extract and 3/4 cup shredded cocunut.  I think the magical trick to making these melt in your mouth is to really cream that butter and sugar like it says too.  That helps these fluff up beautifully even with less butter than called for.  I made 4 minis loaves and 12 large muffins with this recipe.  I am guessing the loaves will freeze well and the muffins will be gone today!  Will make again for sure!

there's no doubt in my mind that this bread was delicious! BUT (there's always a but...) I think I would have prefered to save the trip to the grocery store to get walnuts, coconut, and pineapple and just made plain ol' banana bread because that's what it pretty much was!

This was fabulous!  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and a little allspice for my personal taste and used unsweetened dried coconut (about twice the amount called for because I love coconut).  Got rave reviews from everyone!  Thanks so much!

This was indeed good.  I only had 1/2 cup mashed bananas so I added 1/2 vanilla yogurt to make up the difference.  And it still tasted just like banana bread.  I was hoping for more of a hawaiian (pineapple/coconut) taste.  Maybe more of those or some coconut or pineapple extract.  Very good though.

This bread was very moist and delicious! I will definitely make it again, although I didn't have nuts so I left them out and I think it would have been better with the walnuts in it. I even thought of adding cherries next time. It had a great texture and was very yummy!

Out of sheer "curiosity" and because I happen to have 2 very ripe bananas, I figured this would be a good opportunity to make this. To begin with I noticed that the recipe calls for 4 cups of AP flour which sounded like a lot since the direction did say to lightly grease a 9x5 loaf pan and/or yields two 8x4 inch pans. Turns out I ended up with three 9x5 loaf pans. I used 1 (20 oz) can crushed pineapples thou the recipe calls for a 15 oz can. I don't think there are any cans in this quantity. This recipe was relatively easy and I followed the recipe to a "T". I used all butter instead of maragrine. The  batter has a nice consistency, not too runny or too thick or lumpy. The baking time was approximate, 60 minutes, including the preheated time. I would rate the actual taste of the bread as a 5 stars but considering the recipes' lapse in ingredients and quantity amount called for I gave 4 stars. (4cups of flour for one 9x5 or two 8x4 pans?!) Good thing I happen to have a couple of extra loaf pans. All in all this turned out to be a very tasty, sweet, fruity, light and moist bread with a nice crunch factor from the walnuts. The flavors of pineapples, coconut and bananas were a great combination of flavors. The top of the bread has a nice golden brown color and is slightly crunchy which gives this a nice texture. The bread is simple to make and as delicious as submitter states! Wonderful to give as gifts too!

This bread is good but it is more of a cake than bread.  Super sweet, too sweet.  You could get away with half the sugar.  Has the texture of yellow cake.    Flavor is good overall it just was too cakey and not bread-like enough for me.

I am unable to follow a recipe exactly[constitutional problem...clinical... OCD....whatever] but still I credit it a really good foundation.  I substituted brown sugar for white, used half whole wheat, half white flour and used pecans and sliced almonds instead of walnuts and coconut.  Quite marvelous.  Sometimes canned pineapple is a little bit ...something...not tinny but don't know exactly what so I added a tablespoon of cherry syrup...to offset the possible I don't know what.

Absolutely wonderful.  The flavors mellowed together perfectly and the texture was fabulous.  This is one of the best sweet bread recipes I've had.  I did use some leftover macadamia nuts, instead of walnuts.  Also, I made 1 loaf and 12 muffins, reg. size.  It freezes well.

I make this at least once a month and take to work!  Everyone loves it.  But...it turns out much better if you use three loaf pans...not one like it says...one pan and it bakes out into the oven and the center never gets done!  Three pans baked at 40--45 mins or so ...use the toothpick test.  You will have much more even moistness in each loaf!

This recipe turned out tasty (extremely sweet) and very moist.  Based on the recommendation of other reviewers, I added coconut extract for the bread to taste more Hawaiian.  It still tasted like an ultra sweet banana bread.  I will probably not make this recipe again.  I will stick to a traditional banana bread with fewer ingredients.

It was very sweet and moist, and I'm glad that a bread maker wasn't needed to make this!  I'm also glad that I had the walnuts and coconut, but if I didn't include them, I don't think it would've made that much of a difference.  I accidently didn't cut the recipe in half, but fortunately I had an extra loaf pan and some company over to eat the extra loaf! :)

A good bread, it wasn't quite what I envisioned.  I expected something a little sweeter and more like a banana bread.  But it was good nonetheless and went very quickly!

My family took a trip to Maui a few weeks ago and we found the best banana bread on this planet on the road to Hana. I very quickly realized it had pineapple in it, so I set out to find a similar recipe. This was pretty darn close, but next time I think I’ll add a whole 20oz can of pineapple and maybe add a little cinnamon. I made it exactly as specified and got two loaves out of this recipe. It was a huge hit. Thank you!

We enjoyed your recipe today. Was not as sweet or heavy fruit tasting as we were expecting but still good. I may try adding some marachino cherries next time to see if that pushes it over the edge for us into a 5. As is right now though we like it and will definately make it again.

Very good bread, made 1/2 recipe with 2 bananas, added cinnamon and nutmeg (could have done more) and pecans instead of walnuts, used 1/2 c coconut (1/2 sweetened and 1/2 unsweetened). Used 1/2 c splenda and 1/2 c brown sugar. Baked on 350 for 60 min, was perfectly done.

Recipe is for TWO Loafs. 
I cut it in half for just one loaf. 
I didn't use all the pineapple juice because it seems a bit too loose. Cut out about 1/4 of a cup. 
I also used oil instead of butter or margarine. 
I added cinnamon and nutmeg and 1/2 cup pecans. 
Very easy recipe to put together.

I liked the crushed pineapple in the bread,but we found the coconut didn't add anything to the taste. For my family we prefer my usual banana bread and so I'll just stick with it. Thanks for recipe,I love trying new recipes.

This is a great recipe as is, but is flexible enough to allow you to include or exclude little bits and pieces you may not like or to adjust for family food allergies. For instance, if you don't like nuts, just add an equivalent amount of coconut. I found this recipe to make a lot more than one big loaf pan. I ended up using four 3x6 inch loaf pans and one 8x4 inch pan. You need to adjust cooking times for these sizes. I started checking at about 25 minutes for the small ones and kept resetting the timer 5 minutes at a time until a toothpick came out clean.

Today I was forced by lack of ingredients to change it up a bit and this is what I did and liked it very much. I did not use nuts so I increased the coconut to a full cup. I had a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and used the whole thing. I used butter not margarine (always). And I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of coconut palm sugar. This type of sugar has a lower glycemic index and higher nutrients than white. It's a 1-to-1 conversion and next time I'll use it exclusively. It's a lovely brown color, but drier than standard brown sugar. The breads came out beautiful, rose well, and have a nice brown edge with a very moist center. If my family ate nuts, I'd have put some macadamias in there!

This is my husband's new favorite recipe! I didn't have coconut or walnuts, so I added a little extra banana and some raisins. It turned out to be delicious. Very moist and flavorful.
