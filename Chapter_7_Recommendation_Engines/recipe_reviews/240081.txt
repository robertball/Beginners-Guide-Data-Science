Was looking for an easier frosting than the rich one I have made in the past.  This fit the bill and was great for the 9x13 German Chocolate cake from box mix.  I cooked about 15 min., stirring every 10-20 seconds, to be sure that it wouldn't scorch on the bottom.  Only changes - I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla after I removed it from the heat, stirred in about 1/4 cup extra coconut, to finish off my bag.  I let it cool about 25 min., stirring once in a while, before frosting the cake.  I'm sure I will make it again!

Tastes and spreads more like Carmel candy than frosting...definetly missing something.  Wish I had tasted it prior to spreading it on my beautiful cake.

This stuff is AWESOME.  Like others, I added a little vanilla after removing it from the heat.  I didn't have a candy thermometer so I just just cooked and frequently stirred for 15 minutes.  Absolutely delicious!

Came out perfect. I only let it boil 5-6 minutes and the consistency is just right to frost with. I did use half and half in place of the milk and added a tsp. of vanilla.

I used Half and Half instead of Milk and added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I had add extra half and half as it was too thick  to spread and the butter seem to start to separate.  I would not make this recipes again.

Didnâ€™t make very much frosting; probably should double the recipe to make sure you have enough.

followed the instructions. As soon as I took it off the heat and added the coconut, the butter separated.

I followed the recipe but noticed there was no instruction for the temperature to heat the milk/sugar/butter mixture. I kept it at medium and although it had been boiling about 15 minutes, it still hadn't reached 200 degrees so I turned up the heat to medium high. Once it reached about 220 it started to separate.Anyone have any suggestions?

Delicious!  It seemed a bit runny, so I just added more coconut until it was the right thickness.

Very good and easy!  This was great on a rich buttermilk chocoalte cake that I usually put cinnamon in with a chocolate pecan frosting.  Decided to change it up and it was great.  I used Kari's suggestion about using 1/2 and 1/2 and adding vanilla at the end with the coconut and pecans.  Thanks for this recipe!  I'll be using it again!
