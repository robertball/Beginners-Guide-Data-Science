This recipe is awesome. It was a delight to see it on the sight. I've prepared my nachos like this for years. The only suggestions I might add is to add a bit of milk to the processed cheese sauce in the jar and add salsa and jalapenos to the mix. I top off my nachos with sour cream and green onions. This is definitely an meal for sports night or for a kids party or to use as a party dip. Just good stuff! Note: if you prefer to use fresh or block processed cheese instead of jar cheese you can use mild cheddar/american/provolone mixed, a mexican cheese blend, or block processed cheese like velveeta and mix it with 1 cup of milk and it comes out great.

Absolutely fantastic...easily the best nacho sauce I've ever had! Hubby and I were craving nachos so I made this for dinner, with a bit of scaling down. I used two cans of nacho sauce, one pound of ground beef, one packet of taco seasoning, half of an onion, one can of tomatoes and chilies, and 1/4 tsp of chili powder. I also went ahead and drained the ground beef (there was plenty of grease left in the pan). I used a big pot instead of a slow cooker and it was fine. I didn't add water since we like our dip thick and hearty. It was REALLY good; we had ours in individual soup bowls and used flour tortillas and nacho chips for dipping. We added chopped green onions on top. The only thing missing was sour cream (didn't have any). We had more than enough dip--enough for lunch the next day. Just in case anyone's interested I would say I got enough dip to feed 4 nacho lovers as a main course and 6-8 as a snack. Yummy, yum, YUM!! Thanks Slim!!!!!!!!!!

Instead of the jar cheese I prefer to use velveeta block cheese. It tastes less processed to me

I scaled the recipe WAY down and cooked it all on the stove. I had one can of nacho cheese sauce, about one lb of ground beef, a tablespoon of taco seasoning, half a yellow onion, one tablespoon chili powder, one can diced tomatoes with green chilies, and I didn't use any water. Make sure you drain your tomatoes really good, I didn't and my cheese sauce was a little runny. It didn't look like cheese sauce but it was tasty. I used it for the beef in over the top nachos from this site. Not sure if I would make it again, but it was pretty good.

I added 3 cups of jalape√±os and I use the large can of nacho sauce from a food warehouse chain. It should be a 6 lb can.

This is the best nacho sauce, easy to make and everyone who tries it loves it.  I have made this with both hamburger and sausage.

I followed the measurements given in the review by Irish Carfi since I was making this for only a few people. I cooked the meat and onions and threw everything else in the crockpot on high. WOW. for something so easy it was incredibly tasty one of those can't stop eating nacho cheese sauces.

I liked it pretty well. It was good tasting and looked good.. But my siblings dont really like the idea of onions and stuff, so we left that out. We used Velveeta cheese (half of a Large brick) and just added a fourth a cup of jalapeno 'sauce'. We also added spicy taco sauce and jalapenos on top. I liked it for the most part.. I personally just didn't like the idea of the jar cheese. But like I said, it was pretty awesome!
