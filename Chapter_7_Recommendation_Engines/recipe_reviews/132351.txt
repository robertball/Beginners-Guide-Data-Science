Really good and easy but I think the time is way off.  I only had  2lb tenderloin and had to cook it for the same time as 3lb and it was only med-rare which we like but for some that just wouldn't work.  Adjust cooking time with your sides so they aren't cold by the time the beef is.  Very tasty though!

I always have a beef tenderloin on hand but was looking for something different to do with it.  When I saw this recipe with only three ingredients, I had to try it because if it was good...then I had the easiest recipe of all time in my recipe arsenal! I even tried it out on my husband and two guests (I did use low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter which I would recommend)...and everyone loved it and said they'd give it 4.5 stars.  Since I couldn't do the half star...I'm going 5 because of the simplicity.  Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe.

DELICIOUS!! This will impress your guests! I made a 5 lb tenderloin and doubled the sauce to serve 6 with leftovers. Added a mix of oyster, cremini, and baby bella mushrooms last 15 minutes as suggested by other reviews. Served with potato gratin and green bean bundles from this site. This was a very impressive dish with minimal effort, although the cut of meat is expensive.

As suggested by others, I used 1/2 low sodium soy sauce and 1/2 Tastefully Simple Merlot sauce, and unsalted butter.  I thinly sliced an onion and smashed 3 cloves of garlic.  All of this went on a 6 lb. tenderloin for Christmas dinner.  It took about 1 hour and 10 minutes to reach rare-med. rare stage.  Absolutely delicious!  Added fresh mushrooms around it for the last 20 minutes or so, rolled them in the pan gravy as they cooked.  For gravy, after I removed the roast from the pan to rest, I put the roasting pan over 2 burners, added a can of beef broth and some water/cornstarch. Brought to a boil stirring constantly and cooked down just a bit.  Super delicious!  So glad to know how to cook a tenderloin now.  Thank you for such a super recipe!!!!

I was a little skeptical with so few ingrediants, but it was very easy and turned out quite good. I added fresh mushrooms the last 15 minutes, which I always like with my tenderloin.

I have made this twice.  The second time I used low sodium soy souce which was even better (and I am a salt fan). Very tender and, best of all, easy.

This was a HUGE hit with the twenty guests we had for Christmas dinner this year.  Given the size of our crowd, I knew I wanted to feed everyone well but I didn't want to make a boring old ham so I took a chance and cooked a beef tenderloin for the very first time based solely on this recipe and reviews and I am so glad I did.   I sliced up two huge sweet onions to put on the bottom of my roasting pan.  I placed ten pounds of tenderloin (Costco size pieces) in the pan and topped it with the butter and soy sauce.  I inserted the thermometer and let it go.  About 30 minutes prior to the meat being fully cooked I added about a half pound of sliced mushrooms to the pan.  This was the best beef ever and I might even like it more than the melt-in-your-mouth prime rib I usually make every Christmas.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

Very simple recipe and tasted great.  For those who do not cook tenderloin often, you should let the meat stand at room temperature for 2 hours before putting in the oven.  I cooked a 6 lb tenderloin and cooking time was 1 hour 10 min for med rare (120 degree internal temp), doubled the recipe for this and basted every 20 minutes.  Turned out perfect.

I just made this dish for some very picky eaters and everyone loved it! A lot of them said that it tasted a lot like prime rib. I added some diced red potatoes to the casserole dish and it turned out wonderful! Delicious and easy recipe!!!

Considering this being my first time roasting beef tenderloin, I have to say this recipe turned out pretty good. It does not call for much ingredients, it was simple, but very, very tasty! My husband was impressed, even my 18 month old enjoyed it! Thank you for this simple little recipe!

Great simple recipe! I first learned this from a 4 star chef in L.A., but might I say that his recipe also calls for 1 1/2 tblsp. garlic powder mixed in with 1/2 cup melted butter, 4 to 5 tblsp. chopped onions and 1/2 cup merlot.

Like my little review matters here amongst the hundreds!  That being said I was VERY nervous about this one, with a lot at steak (get it, at steak?) and a house full of picky family members.  I used low sodium soy but still thought it would be off the charts salty.  I would have used unsalted butter but I didn't have it.  I followed exactly save for the addition of some garlic and black pepper.  It was perfect and a huge hit.  With a 70 dollar piece of meat and a crowd with high hopes you're always nervous...this recipe works!  Thanks for sharing!

We made this recipe with unsalted butter and low sodium soy sauce and it was still WAY too salty. Cut back on the soy sauce and replace it with low/no sodium beef broth and reduce the butter by half and I think it might be ok. My husband and I are not the most health conscious eaters, but we both needed to have several glasses of water to rehydrate after dinner. We also though it could use a few herbs to add  layers of flavor. Hope this helps!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. I have made beef tenderloin only twice:  Once for just my husband and once again for his birthday dinner because he requested it.  EVERY woman at the table requested...no....demanded the recipe.  When I told them what it was, they were blown away!  These are woman who can cook!  They couldn't believe the simplicity.  I have a probe built into my oven so it comes out perfectly medium rare every time and so moist and tender it melts in your mouth!!  The easiest recipe ever.  Do use unsalted butter and low sodium soy sauce. GLORIOUS

I make this every year- but brush with a mix of half soy sauce, half olive oil, then place bacon strips over the tenderloin and cook at a high temp  (400-450 degrees) for about 30 min or until roast is about 135 degrees. Let it rest covered with loose foil for about 10-15 min before carving for med rare.

Try this one for cooking the roast.  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  Cook for 30 min. then turn the oven off and let it sit in there for 90 minutes.  Perfect crust and color inside.  Let me know how you liked it.  If you want it more rare let it sit in oven for only 60 min.  Tent roast for 20 min. before slicing.  Enjoy!

I was so nervous about trying such a simple recipe (2 ingredients!) on such an expensive cut of meat, expecially with family coming for a New Year's dinner.  I almost talked myself out of it in order to make it the way the butcher recommended with rosemary & garlic, etc.  Boy was I glad I followed my gut and trusted all the reviews on this website!  It was fabulous!!  I did use the lite soy sauce and unsalted butter and added onions and mushrooms to the bottom of the pan with about 10 minutes to go, which I would HIGHLY recommend - it made for a wonderful au jus.  Only thing I might do differently is generously add some fresh ground pepper.  But don't be afraid of this recipe - it is delicious and so unbelievably easy!

This was amazing for being such a simple recipe!  I never cooked tenderloin before...like others, was simply afraid of ruining an expensive cut of beef!  But our local store had it on sale for 5.99 a pound...so I purchased a 3 pound roast and tried this out.  For four people, I cut the roast down to 2 pounds, and froze the rest.  Took others advice here and let it sit in the marinade for 2 hours at room temp......baked it for 45 minutes...and by the time it rested for 15, it came to just under 140 degrees and perfectly med rare...just like I like it!  Used the low sodium soy and unsalted butter as well, and added a pound of mushrooms to the pan during the last 15 min of roasting.  My family thought it was outstanding.  Will most definately make this again!

I have to admit I was nervous due to the cost, but all the great reviews couldn't be wrong!  I removed the tenderloin at 110 degrees and let it sit for 30 min as suggested by others for med rare.  It was perfect.  I served with asparagus w/cashews and roasted red potatoes from this site and my guests were blown away!  Thanks!

This is the second time I have made this.  I made a few changes.  After pouring on the sauce I sprinkled the roast with garlic powder and fresh ground black pepper.  I cooked it @ 450 degrees for 45 minutes (7 pounds) and reduced it to 375 for the remaining time to internal temp of 150 degrees adding a pound of sliced mushrooms to the pan and coating them with the drippings.
Let roast sit out while I made the gravy by adding 1/3C butter and potato water to drippings, along with a cornstarch cold water mix to thicken slightly.  Roast was med well on the ends and perfect med rare in the middle.  Kept mushrooms in the gravy and served.  Made the $70.00 I spent on the roast worth every bite.

Love this recipe.  Have done a few times now...  Best results when I seasoned roast with pepper and then reduced Soya Sauce to 1/4 c, combined with 1/2 c water.  Added some red wine, too!  Delicious!!!

I made this last night with a 2.5 lb venison tenderloin.  It was SO tender, juicy, and wonderful!  We didn't need knives to cut it once I had sliced it for our plates.  My hubby just loved it.  So easy to make, a definite keeper.

This is amazingly good!!! I made this tonight for dinner out of sheer curiosity, as I couldn't believe that a recipe so simple had such great reviews. It lives up to every single one of them! I took the advice of the other reviewers and used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter. I also cut out half of the soy sauce and replaced it with Merlot. I added a clove of minced garlic and half of a sweet onion, sliced, into the pan around the tenderloin as well. My husband is a very picky eater, and he LOVED this recipe. He went back for seconds and so did I! We can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow! This one is definitely a keeper!

Made this tonight using a 3.6 pound tenderloin. I extended the roasting time to about an hour since my husband doesn't like rare or med-rare meat, but I felt it was overcooked. 10 minutes earlier and it would have been perfect. The sauce was a little salty even having used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter. Next time, I'll cut the soy sauce w/ some red wine or water. But, I'll definitely keep this in the arsenal for an easy entertaining dish. Thanks!

I did not like this tenderloin prepared with the soy sauce.  The soy really takes away the good beef steak taste.

This is so simple it is shocking just how great it tastes.  I made mine in the slow cooker 3.5 hours. The sauce was so good I was just dipping bread in it, just very tasty!!

So simple and so good.  

I made this for dinner last night with an almost 4.5# tenderloin. Cooked at 350 for not quite an hour(140 at it's thickest) and then tented with foil for about about 20-30 min, until we were ready for dinner.  The smaller end was a nice medium for those that liked that and the thicker end gave me the med-rare/rare others wanted.

Everyone loved it!!

I wowed my guests with this super simple recipe. I used a round glass pie pan to cook in so the liquid would be as deep as possible. I let the meat sit at room temperature for an hour before cooking. I took the tenderloin out at 115F and let it sit for 20 minutes before serving as advised by my butcher.  The recipe worked so well I did a pork tenderloin the same way the next night.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I made this for my wife's birthday and it turned out marvelously.  I made a few additions as suggested by other reviewers.  I had a 2.5 lb tenderloin and used low-sodium soy sauce in a 9x13 glass dish.  I added a thinly-sliced medium yellow onion on top of the meat and some cut up red potatoes to the dish.  When the meat was reading 120f internal, I added sliced baby portobello mushrooms on top and baked for another 15 minutes.  I served this with green beans.  It was wonderful.  We all had seconds and are looking forward to leftovers on crusty rolls with provolone and creamy horseradish.  I am definitely keeping this one in my recipe box for company.

I love to cook and eat beef tenderloin. As most others have said with so few ingredients I was sceptical. It was fantastic and so easy, I just added one ingredient, a large glass of Merlot for the cook. Works everytime, thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. I went to my local Kroger's store and they had beef tenderloin on special $6.99 per Lb., not trimed, who cares.

Incredible!!! I've used this recipe a few times. Always a big hit. I used prime rib once as well- great. Very quick to make, really does melt in the mouth. I highly highly recommended enjoying this with cranberry horseradish sauce/dip and loaded mashed potatoes on the side. Really great, wish I could give it 6 stars.

I used a filet mignon tip (about a 3/4 pound "tail" piece) and clarified butter, roasting it at 375.  Husband said it was fabulous. (I don't eat meat but even I was tempted.)  Thanks for a simple but great idea.  I'll use it for filets from now on.

Truly fabulous! I was hesitant to try this because it sounded too good to be true. So I picked a different recipe, but was short on time so I made this simple one. It was excellent & I'm so glad I ran out of time!

This was a huge hit with my family, which includes 4 picky eaters.  It was very easy and I wish I had stuck with the lower end of the time estimates (10 min then 35 min).  I went 10 + 40 min and that left me with a well done roast.  I'm philosophically opposed to well done tenderloin.  But next time I know to cook it only 35 minutes after turning.  And there will be a next time!

I wasnt expecting much to be honest .. but the outcome was great !! ... The meat was tender and juicy ( just be carefull not to overcook it ). I added some small potatoes right from the start, and crimini mushrooms 20 minutes later.

I made some adjustments to the sauce at the end tough:  Remove all the liquid from the baking dish and put it on a saucepan, on low heat , mix 3 tbsp of flour with 1/2cup of water, and quickly mix it into the sauce.... keep stiring for a couple of minutes, once the sauce thickens, add 1cup of sherry and a whole stick of rosemary ..let it simmer for a couple  minutes, remove the rosemary , and its done ! youll have a more rich and thick sauce for the meat

Yes, this was very good.  But because it is so simple, your success will depend on the quality of meat that you buy and the quality of soy sauce.

My cut of beef was rather thick in the middle and it required a whole lot more time than what was indicated.  Before you are ready to add in any onions, mushrooms or cook your veggies, check the meat temp.  

Also, use the best quality of soy sauce you can get.  If you are going to use a popular store brand - go with the reduced sodium.  You'll be glad you did!

A complete hit!  Wish I could make it again today.  Doubled the recipe for a 8lbs whole tenderloing (8lbs before trimming the fat). Used unsalted butter and the lowest salt soy sauce I could find.  The meat was great, but the sauce was mildly salty. Cooked it for 60 minutes and when it came out of the oven the thickest part was 140 degrees. After 15 mins it was about 145, so perfect for us.  Firm, but uniformly pink throughout.  Added 2 trays of sliced mushrooms to the drippings in the last 15 mins. Cut easily with a dinner knife, didn't even need a steak knife.

I was skeptical, but this was very good!  I used low sodium soy sauce and smart balance butter.  I also added sliced mushrooms in the last 15 min.  The sauce is good on mashed potatoes.

I've been making this tenderloin for years minus the butter (and with a low sodium soy) - I tried with the butter and while it was good, the extra fat and calories aren't needed, just as good without so makes it a 2 ingredient recipe.  I have cook for 40 minutes and the ends are medium, the middle is medium rare - which is just perfect in our household.  The tenderloin resting (I tent with aluminum foil) is necessary.

WOW!!! So easy and so yummy!!! I too added sliced mushrooms the last 20 minutes of cooking. I also used low sodium soy sauce. Cooking time much longer than indicated. I made two 1.75lb cuts and after cooking 10 minutes and turning over, I cooked it about an additional 50-60 minutes. Everyone loved it and I gave the recipe to several family members and friends whom also love it!!

Waaaaaaaay too salty for our taste.  I made this for my fiancee's birthday dinner.  She's a steak and potato girl, so I made some cheesy garlic mashed taters, lemon tarragon asparagus and this dish.  Far from fabulous.  After tasting it, I have to say that a little salt and pepper is severely underrated.  Be careful trying this one out on company or for a special occasion before making it for yourself first.

I likeothers thought really??????

I love onions and mushrooms w beef and mounded up about 3 inches in the roasting pan. Some potatoes, then war the 6 pounder on top. Pored the soy/butter on top, then sprinkled some Montreal steak on just because.

I wondered if it would be enough liquid or if the veggies would be dry.

Nope and nope. The meat juices mixed with the rest and everything was great. Whole tenderloin for$32?  Cant beat that with a stick. I will make this again, oh yes, I will. Probably great with a boneless pork loin too (not pork tenderloin)  

Make this with confidence.

I make this every Christmas now. My family demands it! 1. Use low sodium soy and unsalted butter. 2. I add chopped garlic cloves just to give it some more aromatics. 3. Watch the time with a good meat thermometer. You do NOT want over cooked tenderloin. 4. Trim all of the fat off this puppy beforehand. 5. Don't mess with this recipe. It doesn't need it. Honestly. Just don't.

I can't believe this tasted so good and was so easy. I used a 4 lb. bison tenderloin, and it was AMAZING. Sooooooo good. Ahhhh.... I have since used this recipe for venison tenderloin, and it is superb!

This has got to be the best recipe I've found on this site!  I can't wait to have an occasion to cook it again--I cooked this about 3 weeks ago and still think about how tender and flavorful this simple recipe is.  I listened to the reviews saying the salt was a little much so since I didn't have low sodium soy sauce on hand, I subbed about a third of the soy sauce with plain water.  I now have low sodium soy sauce on hand just waiting!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this recipe and was at first skeptical, but it is exactly what the reviews said..fantastic.  The drippings served on the side make a nice sauce to drizzle over the top when you serve it...I too would watch the time however, and cook to 140 and let it cook up a little as it rests.....

WOW made this for New Year's Eve and it was a big hit.  By sticking my oven probe in the thickest part of the filet and setting the internal temp to 140 degrees we got various doneness and please everyone.  With the few pieces that were left I made hot beef sandwiches a couple days later. YUM.  Can't wait to make this again!

This rocks! I didn't have that nice a cut of meat (I used a cheap roast), seared all sides of the meat and put everything in a stoneware roaster with a lid, and baked it until it was medium - pink in the middle- My family ate the whole thing in one setting and went on and on how good it was. A keeper!

We prepared a 6 pound tenderloin (wood-fired grill), so I can not rate the cooking time and temp, but the flavor was excellent! Took the advice of other reviewers and used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter.  I did add in a small amount of liquid browning sauce and black pepper.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a delicious base recipe. Of course following the other reviews, I doctored mine up just a tiny bit. I covered the roast with Monteray steak seasoning, and let sit out at room temp for 2 hours. After mixing the butter & soy sauce, I added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, and a teaspoon of ginger. Cooked for close to an hour, and every 15 minutes i would flip the roast over, and spoon the liquid over the top. Took it out at 130F...and let sit for 20 mins. This roast was to die for.....what a perfect way to ring in the New Year!! Make sure to spoon extra drippings over each serving....awesome!!

As others have said, this recipe is wonderful as written.  It needs nothing else, which is amazing.  I made it with a pork loin, too, and it was just as good: tender & delicious.  I found the regular soy to be way too salty, so now use low sodium soy and unsalted butter.  I skimmed the fat from the pan juices and put the remaining sauce in a small pitcher for everyone to pour over the meat, as desired.

I gave it 3 stars because I do cook this every year at Christmas. We just rub it with salt, fresh ground pepper and fresh garlic. Rub it at least an hour before roasting!!! 15-20 minutes per pound, medium, still pink inside!!!! Delicious cut of meat!!! Our local store had them on sale for $5.99 pound, get the butcher to cut the roast away from the bone and then tied back together!!! Merry Christmas

We LOVE this!!!  We love adding some potatoes into the butter/soy sauce mixture.  I cut in ¼ or 1/8 depending on the size of the potato.  & I have them bake the entire time.  It just enhances the amazing tenderloin.  We do use low sodium soy sauce.

Tried this on Christmas day. Used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter as recommended by other reviewers. Added shallots and mushrooms about 3/4 way thru cooking.  Would recommend seasoning the roast prior to cooking. Very easy but not a favorite.  3 1/2 stars

Ok, this was an extremely simple and delicious recipe.  I added some layers to the flavor: fresh chopped ginger, minced garlic, tbsp Brown sugar, black pepper and paprika and worked that in to the soysauce butter mix. Marinaded this for a day and a half. OMG!! It was spectacular.  The base recipe ingredients were great; but if you want to add other layers (no salt) you should.  Next time I may use low sodium soy sauce.  Will never do my roast any other way.

This is the most perfect Tenderloin recipe.  Be sure and pull it out of the oven 10 degrees before your target temperature.  It still cooks for 10-15 minutes.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner and we loved it! It was the first time that I made a tenderloin, I usually prepare a prime rib roast. I will not be making prime rib again after making this recipe. My daughter has Celiac Disease so I made this with a wheat free soy sauce.  I tied the tenderloin in 2 inch intervals and between the intervals, I wrapped bacon around it. It was absolutely fabulous!

This recipe is wonderful!  I've used it twice - once with a beef tenderloin as suggested and once with just a 5-lb roast.  Both came out amazing.  I rubbed both with fresh minced garlic and added the mushrooms at the end as others suggested.  The roast (since it was a tougher cut than the tenderloin) I baked at 275 (and later 325) for about 5 hours.  Perfect! I shredded the leftovers and served them in the broth/gravy with egg noodles a couple of days later.  Then I served the remaining "hash" from that meal over baked potatoes the next day.  We had three incredible meals from that recipe from one (rather large) chunk of meat.  All three were fantastic.  I've never tasted any more delicious or more tender beef.  A truly amazing (and very simple) recipe!

I used this recipe for a Sirloin Tip Roast, I'm sure it wasn't as tender as a Tenderloin would have been, but it was good and everyone in my family enjoyed it!

This was great. I used extra butter and basted it during the cooking process. I also relied on a meat thermometer to let me know when it was medium-rare. I let it sit for about 1/2 hour after it was done cooking and then sliced it. I will make this again for sure. :)

I sure hate being one of the exceptions here but I didn't care for this.  I used unsalted butter and  low sodium soy and this was nothing but salt.  I should of gone with my intuition on this one.  Couldn't imagine this being good but with all the great ratings I had to try.   All this cut needs is a nice spice rub and I will stick with that in the future.  I was not the only one in my family who did not care for this.

Very simple and great flavor! I decided to use light soy sauce and I also replace half of the soy sauce with red wine (Pinot Noir) and the steak was fantastic. Tender and full of flavor. I will make this again.

Easy to prepare.  Easy ingredients to find.  Good food.  Guests enjoyed it.  Note:  cold soy sauce on hot melted butter will congeal and get lumpy.  Not pretty to pour, but tastes good.

This recipe is AWESOME!  So buttery and yummy.  We only had 1/4 c soy when we made this, so modified by using an additional 1/4c teriyaki and 1/4 c worcestershire sauce.  BRILLIANT!

For many years my dad has cut up deer tenderloins into steaks. One time he left the tenderloin whole, so I tried this recipe for it. If you like venison, or even if you are lukewarm on it, you will LOVE deer tenderloin prepared this way. Obviously you must adjust the cooking time for a much smaller cut of meat, but I have found that ten minutes on each side for your average-sized deer or elk tenderloin gets it medium to medium-well inside. Even our two little girls love this dish and they're not big on venison.

This recipe was fabulous but I would make one change and use low sodium soy sauce the next or mix it with water to lessen the salt.  Taste was fabulous.

This was wonderful. My roast was a little under 2 lbs so I  used a little less butter, 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup red wine. I also sliced 4 large portabella mushrooms and added those 20 minutes before done. After 10 mins and turning the roast over I only cooked for 35 mins longer for med rare.
I tried a cross rib roast. Seared both sides. Added sliced onion and 1/2 cup of  marsala wine to butter, soy mixture. cook at 285, turn after 30 mins. Add whole yukon gold potatoes then cook 4 hours. I added baby carrots 1 hour before done.
NOTE to self, Made this again with 4 very thick fillets. after turning at 10 minutes I need to cook them only 25 minutes vs. 35.

this is a classic example of less is best---I saw all kinds of recipes on line and had some in my cookbooks but first
 of all I didn't have fresh herbs and wasn't going to go to the store as I was already settled in and second, I was tired but had this fantastic tenderloin I needed to cook. I was somewhat skeptical as another reviewer but WOW this is FANTASTIC. This is a keeper!!!! I used unsalted butter same amount, and almost 3/4 cup of mix of red wine (I had a semi sweet I mistakenly bought a while and used that) and soy as I only had a 2# tenderloin.   Green beans, Greek style were a great accompaniment and whole wheat dinner rolls I had been lucky enough to buy fresh earlier this day, Thanks for the recipe! Ideas for leftovers as there were only two of us. (Also, right before serving, I brushed some of the yummy juice on the slices._

This is the best recipe. Only 3 ingredients. It's so impressive. Doctor it up & put on the ritz, or do it as is. This is really FABULOUS Beef Tenderloin.

This meat was delish!  I doubled the soy sauce and butter and had plenty for 10 lbs of meat.  I used the reduced sodium soy sauce and no salt butter as suggested by other reviews and it was perfect.  I also used a clove of minced garlic, 1 T Worchestershire sauce, a stick of butter and 2 lbs of mushrooms, sautéed and used for garnish.  People raved about the meat!!!

Just FYI--I baked the meat for 45 minutes and some for 55 minutes so my guests could have some a little rare and others more well done.  It was perfect.  Enjoy!  I am having this for Christmas for my family.

Used this recipe for Thanksgiving.  We had 6# of beef tenderloin and it turned out perfect.  The time was perfect and I used a meat thermometer just to be sure and it came out beautifully!  This was a very easy meal to prepare for a group of people (we had 10 adults).  I did use low salt soy sauce and salted butter and wouldn't change a thing.  Also, 2# of whole mushrooms the last 15 minutes. Mmmmmm!

Just one word - fabulous! If you want to impress your guests, make this - add mushrooms, like others suggested. Easy to cook.

I have just found my new way to prepare tenderloin!  What an excellent way to watch the Patriots beating the Ravens!  I may add some garlic to this the next time, but it is great just the way it is!!  I didn't find it to salty, I actually a little to mine once it was sliced.  Love the sauce for dipping!  

Thanks for such an easy tasty way to a great tasting tenderloin.

Beef Tenderloin is woefully expensive so I used an eye round. I injected about 1/4 c of soy into the roast and cooked until therm. read 130. Let sit for 5 minutes and it was pretty good. If you prepare this, be prepared for the required 3 lb tenderloin to cost over $50

I was extremely dissapointed with this recipe… I gave it a try for Christmas dinner, and unfortunately it came out flavorless and somewhat dry once it was cut and placed on my plate. I wont be trying this recipe again.

Some friends have tried this and loved it , I enjoyed the taste but not the cut of meat, so i tried it on a fillet and  well  ,,,This recipe will not work with a good fillet of beef , so fillet lovers please try balsamic vinegar ( a good quality one ) it is divine. just remember your cooking time for the amount of fillet , and how you like it ..

Absolutely, hands down, the best roast beef we ever ate! This was so delicious and tender we would give it 10 stars if we could. We did use unsalted butter and low sodium soy sauce and there was still plenty of flavor. Thank you so much thewright6 for sharing this recipe, we are forever in your debt.

This recipe was excellent, though as other posters have commented, a bit too salty. That didn't take away from everyone loving it though. I will use a low sodium soy next time. 
I cooked a 1 pound tenderloin for 50 minutes and that was long enough. it came out medium rare.
I also added minced garlic on top of the beef and basted frequently. I cooked potatoes in the same dish and added mushrooms towards the end. 
Absolutely delicious.

I was skeptical of this recipe because it was so easy, but I must say, it is one of the best ways to prepare beef tenderloin.  I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!  I spiced up the roast prior to pouring the sauce over it with a little garlic powder, onion powder and ground black pepper.  I also roasted mushrooms in the sauce towards the end.  It was wonderful!

I cooked this for my parents on Christmas Eve and for a dinner party for 10 on New Year's Eve.  It was fabulous, a huge hit.  I got one tenderloin at our local meat market and the other at a large shopping center...the meat market tenderloin was much better, more tender and flavorful.  I'd recommend paying the extra price for a fine piece of aged meat....it was to die for!!!

This was absolutely the best! We have made it several times for special occasions or for breakfast with eggs. My mother in law who is the "beef" guru even requested that we cook it for Christmas dinner. Worth every $$ we spent.

Excellent.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  To cut the salt factor indicated by other users, I substituted 1/4 c. Worchestershire for 1/4 c. of soy and added a few big squirts of honey.  Brown sugar would be good too.  My son, chef wannabe, raved about it and was shocked when I told him how easy it was.

I made this for Christmas Dinner, it was flavorful and moist and just fell apart under a fork. I served it with sautéed mushrooms and a bunch of wonderful sides from this website. Will definitely make again when tenderloins go on sale!

My husband raved over this I thought it was pretty good too because you only use three ingredience. I did not think it was too salty but I am sure that depends on your taste. I used beef tenderloin steaks since I was cooking for only two and used the drippings for dipping sauce-very, very good.  Thank You.

We did this in a small pottery bowl with a single cut of steak (5oz).  Cooking time was slightly shorter (~30 min total), and we adjusted down the butter and soy sauce.  It was the best steak I've ever made at home.

This recipe is so easy to make. I buy beef tenderloin all the time. after cleaning the beef I add a bit of salt and pepper to the steak and then pour the soy sauce (low sodium)  and melted butter on top. I bake for a good hour and i turn the tenderloin every 15 min. It comes out really soft and it tastes great. good with mash potatoes and green beans

My husband and son didn't care for this recipe. They didn't think beef tenderloin goes well with soya sauce. I enjoyed it.

By far, the best dish that I make. Recently, I made it using tenderloin steaks instead of a whole tenderloin. I also added 3/4c of red wine. It took about 50 minutes to cook for medium-well. Amazing recipe!

Amazing.  I read the recipe and was sure it was too good to be true.  Boy, was I wrong.  Great Christmas dinner and something I'll prepare again for other special occasions!  Would be great served also with mushrooms, sweet potato side dish, roasted potatoes, rice.  Just a great dish.

i may have had a bad cut of tenderloin roast because this was very chewy. I followed the directions exactly.

Really great meat with some changes.  I used low sodium soy sauce, unsalted butter, and I rolled the beef in steak rub seasoning before cooking.  I took 10 minutes off of the cooking time and put it on the grill for the last 10 minutes.  Delicious!!!

Okay this is truly as fabulous as everyone is saying - HOWEVER - I did use the unsalted butter, and for the "3/4 cup soy sauce", used 3/8 cup lite soy sauce and 3/8 cup cabernet sauvignon. Magnificent!  I basted it every 15 - 20 mins. Did the mushrooms in the sauce while roasting.  Also pulled it out at about 123 degrees, and let it rest under a tent of aluminum for 30 mins. It was a perfect medium rare.  Served with garlic smashed potatoes (YUM!) 
and asparagus.  This is my new fancy company menu!

this steak was so good. I will make this again, but I will follow the reviewers suggestions and use low sodium soy sauce and butter. It was a little salty, also I topped it with bacon prior to cooking but I didn't care for it, as I like crispy bacon.. Still, it was very yummy. Thx for sharing

I agree with the first reviewer..the timing is off. I cooked mine for 45minutes and it wasn't even close to 120 degrees internally. Make sure you add additional time allowance for this one.

Phenomenal! So simple and the taste is divine! I added a splash of wine and baked it until 125 degrees. It was the perfect medium. Next time I'll bake it until 120 degrees because I like medium rare better.

Just made this for my daughter and I today.  I bought a 3 lb. roast at the local butcher and cut it in half.  I used the same cooking time and temp, and it turned out perfect.  I will make the other half tomorrow.  Delicious with a baked potato!

Loved it!!  It was so easy and it was a very fancy dish!  I did use the low sodium soy sauce and glad that I did cause it was still a little salty to me, but my family thought it and most importantly me was amazing! Ehehhhe. I also put in the mushrooms and onions :0)

Great beef!  Simple to make, but still a bit salty even with the low-sodium soya.  But I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was great, quick and easy.  I used margarine instead of butter because my hubby is allergic to dairy products.  We used a 2lb. tenderloin and it took about the same amount of time to cook for medium rare.  Will make again as soon as beef tenderloin goes on sale!

This was fabulous.  Although I like Asian cuisine...I was afraid the soy sauce would be overpowering and it was not in the least.   I did use low-sodium soy and unsalted butter.  I added Yukon golds and carrots to the pan with the beef.  I then reduced the sauce with a bit of corn starch.  It was very good and my very picky husband and 5-year old daughter cleaned their plates.

I have never rated a recipe before but had to say this was fabulous as the recipe title indicates!  Fixed this with half the soy sauce (low salt) and made a Merlot sauce to balance it out. Added some fresh rosemary and oregano and fresh cracked pepper. It really did taste like prime rib - was outstanding! Served with pan juices, merlot sauce and horseradish mayo.

This was fantastic and so easy. My boyfriend cringed when he saw me use soy sauce (I used low sodium and unsalted butter - great suggestion) but almost polished off the whole thing himself! He loved it! Definitely a keeper! Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent!  Definite Do-over!  Made this for 7 people on Christmas Eve.  Elegant and outstanding!  Rave reviews!  Made a 5.75 lb roast. Cut it into 2 pieces so that my guests weren't waiting too long for it to be done.  Definitely use a meat thermometer and unsalted butter and low sodium soy sauce.  Total roast time with convection oven:  50 min.  plus at least 15 min rest time after out of the oven.  Cooked to perfection!  Great leftovers for sandwiches the next 2 days!!

This was very good. Next time I'll probably use reduced sodium soy sauce just so I feel better about it. Although using the regular soy sauce did not make it taste too salty. Quick, easy and delicious, this recipe is a keeper.

Christmas 2015
This has become our standard Christmas meal. We crave the flavor. So easy. I cook it in my toaster oven. I use the meat thermometer to test for doneness. Spectacular! Everyone asks for the recipe.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone RAVED! I selected an organic beef tenderloin (our splurge for the season!) and cooked it to 140 degrees.  Served with a wonderful herbed homemade linguine and salad of pear, walnut and blue cheese.  Wonderful, simple meal!

Delicious and I even overcooked my roast (as I have a new convection oven). Would have rated it higher but for all the butter. Felt guilty but it tasted sublime!

Made this the first time for a Sunday dinner.  We had family stop by unexpectedly that stayed for dinner. I used venison tenderloin, instead of beef and it was wonderful.  My family and dinner guests were still talking about how good this dish was a few days later.  Only advice I would add is to be careful not to overcook. Cook to medium, especially venison.  Could easily dry out.

Excellent!  We used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter.  Added cremini mushrooms during the last 1/2 hour of cooking and it was wonderful.  We did increase the cooking time as I don't like my meat too rare.

It was good, and my guests liked it, but I thought the soy sauce made it a bit too salty.  I probably won't make it again.

I had never cooked beef tenderloin before, and I wanted to try something different for Christmas dinner.  This was awesome!  Only thing I added was some whole mushrooms I threw in the pan in the last few minutes.

First of all, I love this site for this reason. I buy some kind of meat or have a surplus of some kind of produce and an amazing easy recipe pops up. I made this for Christmas and it was amazing, everyone loved it. I made a 3.5 lb and pulled it out when internal temp hit 144 and it was a perfect medium. I also put steamed red potatoes and carrots in for the last 25 min and basted them as well. They were delicious! I actually saw my boyfriend eat carrots (he never does)

Good, easy and simple. It was a little funny when cooking because it smelled so sweet, almost like brown sugar. The flavor was great though, not too salty, or strong at all, just a great enhancement of the beef.   I made a Pancetta wrapped tenderloin earlier in the week and had leftover pieces that I needed to do something with. This was the perfect solution.   The timing was right for me and the flavor was very mild.

I almost burned the kitchen down with this one, but all turned out well!  I used 2 filet mignon steaks, 1/2 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce and the butter. I marinated the filets in the sauce for about 30 mins (I was preparing sides in the meantime).  I removed the filets from the sauce and place them in the broiler (This is where the fire started.  Broiling was a bad idea). I ended up putting the filets back in the sauce and baking them for about 10 more mins to get them to medium well.  The steaks turned out great. The sauce was awesome, but I should've halved the recipe because I only had two filets. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

Sorry, but we did not care for this! My mom makes tenderloin with just a few slices of garlic tucked in here and there and a little salt and pepper, and I much prefer that way. I cooked it for the longest time suggested thinking it would come out medium as the recipe stated, and it was RARE.  I had to put it back in the oven for 20-25 minutes to get it cooked through.

OMG This had to be the best tenderloin I have ever had !  I subtituted low sodium soy sauce & used unsalted butter. I cooked (2) 3 1/2 lb. roasts at the same time, took about 1 1/2 hrs to reach 140', they were so good !!!!

This was amazing.  I made it as is, but added a little black pepper.  I also added whole mushrooms to the pan for the last 20 minutes, then kept them cooking in the liquid while the meat rested.  The meat was perfectly flavored - not too salty (I did use reduced sodium soy sauce).  The mushrooms were a hit too.  Great results with no fuss.

This recipe was so easy and so tasty!! I didn't have quite enough soy sauce, only about a 1/2 cup, so I used worcestershire sauce for the remaining 1/4 cup and it was delicious. It did take quite a bit longer than 45 minutes, but was well worth the wait, just need to plan the sides accordingly.

I was looking for a new flavor to do steaks with. I saw this and thought it sounded interesting. I was hesitant at first because soy sauce is so salty but it was DELICIOUS. Everyone LOVED it. I did change it a little bit because that's what I do with every recipe and it was delicious. I ended up adding about an 1/8 cup of Worcestershire sauce with the soy sauce and I used New york steaks lightly seasoned with Johnnys. It took about 35 minutes to cook and it was a delicious, easy dinner!

This is a great recipe!  The only thing I had to change was to the cooking time.  I had a 4 pound tied beef tenderloin roast and it took about an hour and 20 minutes for mine to come up to 155, which was about medium and perfect for us.  Very easy and very very good.  I put it on my buffet table and the compliments came rolling in!  Thanks!

Awesome! I seasoned the tenderloin with salt and pepper and dotted it with buttter instead of melted butter (to save time; it was a weeknight), then added the soy sauce. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious!! This one's a winner! Thanks!

I tried this recipe with some leftover tenderloin I had--one smaller piece and a somewhat larger piece.  I thought it would be too salty with straight up soy sauce, so I did two parts butter, 1 part soy sauce, 1 part Worcestershire, 1 part steak sauce.  The smaller part did come out a bit salty, but the larger part came out tender, juicy and VERY flavorful!  I did give it a 4 only because I think it would have been too salty had I followed the recipe.  Thanks!

I had my doubts about the simplicity of this recipe, but don't let it fool you...it is fantastic!! My husband and 3 little girls loved it!! I cut the recipe in half since I only had a 1.2 lb tenderloin. So I used 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp. of soy sauce, and 1/4 c of butter. I basted the meat 3 times during the cooking time...5 stars all the way! Next time I'll make a bigger tenderloin for leftovers!!

I have made beef tenderloin many times, and i keep going back to this recipe. I was a little skeptical because it was so easy and few ingredients, but it is fabulous.

I had never cooked tenderloin before this recipe...or anything that my boyfriend found edible! This was so easy and the results were fantastic! I have not stopped hearing about how good it was (which I have to agree).  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Made this for 13 people at Easter (used a 5.5 lb tenderlion) and got rave reviews!  There were plenty of leftovers (we had a ham, too) and the steak sandwiches we made later were divine!

I liked how simple this recipe was, but I should have added some mushrooms to make it a little more exciting. My husband thought it was great, so I give it 4 stars.

Fantastic recipe!  I used low-sodium soy and it still tasted incredible.  Very simple recipe -- I've done this about three times now.  Can't do it too often as it's expensive and quite fatty.  But, when I do, it's a real treat for the whole family.  Highly recommended.

I LOVED this dish. Even my husband, who does not eat much red meat, really liked it. I added sauteed shitake and baby bello mushrooms on top. It was so easy and delish, a definite keeper.

OMG...It was amazing!!  I was SO skeptical with only two ingredients!! I had a 2.2 pound beef tenderloin.  Cooked it about 45 minutes on convection heat at 325 degrees.  Added a pound of fresh sliced mushrooms about 15 minutes before it was done.  I used a meat thermometer to watch the temp of the meat and cooked it to rare...140 degrees.  I let it sit for 15 minutes covered in foil.  Served it with fresh cooked green beans and baked potatoes.  I only had regular soya sauce so I used unsalted butter.  It was melt in your mouth and SO delicious!!

No, it was perfect and my daughter said it wouldn't be any good. She wanted to use a different recipe. But everyone was delighted with the meat,  None was leftover.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious basic recipe and surprisingly quick and easy. But here are a few suggestions that may be helpful: 1), I used only about 1/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce and that was salty enough for us. 2) I reduced the amount of melted butter to about a 1/3 of a cup and added olive oil to make up the difference. 3)  I would suggest browning the meat in an oven-safe skillet first, just to give it a nice color and surface texture. Then, just pop the skillet into the oven once the sauce is added..4) I also used a good sprinkling of cracked black pepper before browning, for an added flavor punch. With these tweaks, it’s a full 5 stars for us.

Ridiculously easy and incredibly good. My family took a bite and absolutely loved it. I made a couple of adjustments. 4lb loin at 375 for about 2 hours. Basted it a few times. Also poured some red wine over it along with soy and butter. It turned out so tender and moist.

I cannot describe how good this recipe is.  The meat is so tender and flavorful.  I make it every Christmas Eve as the cut of meat is very expensive, but it is worth it.  Try it - you will love it.

This is my go-to recipe for any kind of special meal. My kids and my husband adore it and everyone I've made it for raves about it. It's embarrassingly easy. Can't say enough good things. I do have to mess with the cooking time every time I make it, but that doesn't bother me as long as I know ahead of time.

This was fabulous!  I used 1/4 c soy sauce, 1/2 c water, about 3/4 c red wine and 4 T melted butter (plenty!).  My tenderloin was just over 2 1/2 lbs -- in oven at 425 for 10 min, then turned and roasted at 375 for additional 1/2 hr.  With 20 min to go, added crab, garlic and cheese stuffed mushrooms.  Tenderloin was done perfect for our taste--more on the med-rare side.  Will definitely use this recipe a lot!

This is so simple, it is almost unreal.  It did take me longer to get it done but that may have been due to meat had been frozen.  Our new Christmas Eve meal.

I used low sodium soy sauce as well but thought it was very salty. Will try using less next time & garlic like another review. I didn't purchase the trimmed tenderloin and attempted to trim myself. Some tough parts. It would be worth the extra $2.00/# to have the butcher trim it.

Followed recipe, but i also put slivers of garlic in meat.   It was delicious.   Didn't give 5 stars bc I think it could have used a salt and pepper rub for a little more flavor.   I will use this recipe of soy sauce and butter again.   Very good.

I'm a guy that's relatively new to cooking. This recipe was very easy for a novice. I didn't have unsalted butter so i used salted. That combined with low sodium soy sauce was just a tiny fraction more salty than would've been perfect. Next time with the unsalted butter it will be perfect for me. Thanks for the recipe!

Cooked my first beef tenderloin with this recipe.  So easy and the beef was so tender.  I followed some of the recommendations and used low sodium and mixed it with water.  Also, I sliced onions, garlic, and mushrooms around the meet through the whole time.  This is a keeper recipe.  I did watch the time to make sure not to over cook.

I made this with shoulder tender (also called petite tender), which is a similar cut but half the price. It was out of this world! I will be making it again using the low sodium options and adding some minced garlic (the bottled kind most people always have in the fridge) to give it a little something extra. But even as it is written, this recipe was eye-rollingly delicious.

We made slight changes. We lightly browned the meat in a Teflon skillet with no oil. We added 4 cloves of chopped garlic to the baking dish. After the liquids were added, I grabbed the pepper mill and put a generous amount of black pepper on top. It was delicious.  This is now our official beef tenderloin recipe.

OMG!  I had never made beef tenderloin before today.  Like many other reviewers, I was surprised, no, shocked at the price per pound but I thought, hell, we deserve it so I bought a 2 lb tenderloin.  I cooked it exactly as written until it was medium well.  I hadn't told hubby how much this meat was per pound until he started to eat it.  He said it was absolutely the best he had ever eaten so then I told him how much!  We're not rich, but I can tell you, we'll be eating beef tenderloin on a regular basis from now on.  Not sure why some reviewers thought the content of soya and butter was too salty.  We didn't find that to be the case at all!  I didn't use the drippings though which may have made it more salty.  I chose instead, to make an au jus to drizzle over the meat and potatoes.  
Thank you to the Wrights for an excellent recipe!!!!!!  This recipe was absolutely amazing and even better than any beef dish we've had in restaurants!

This was absolutely wonderful.  It is simple and flavorful.  I did double the sauce amounts and substituted 1/2 of the soy sauce with good red wine.  I added mushrooms and onions to the roasting pan.  Impressive and perfect!

Phenomenal.  I followed some suggestions,  used unsalted butter and did half soy half red wine. I also did let it come to room temperature for about an hour before baking. It was unbelievably good.

Delicious and my Christmas guests loved it! I did add merlot to the sauce (and melted it all together in a sauce pan first). I had an 8 lb tenderloin so I doubled the recipe but only did one cup of soy and a half a cup of Merlot. Rubbed the roast with a little pepper and garlic powder. Next time I will use unsalted butter though no one complained it was salty (I think it was just a tad salty). My family members all asked for this to be my new Christmas feast! Thanks :)

This recipe is phenomenal! I used it on venison tenderloin, and did 2 parts butter to 1 part soy in my case, but it was fabulous! So happy to find such a simple awesome recipe!

SALTY!!! I even cut the butter in half like but I was stubborn and didn't cut the soy sauce in half. Big mistake. Believe me I'm addicted to salt and this was way to salty. If you're making it cut the soy sauce and butter in half. And add what you like. I added some onions, mushrooms, and carrots.

This was super simple and DELICIOUS! I did modify it slightly based on others feedback. First I let the loin marinate in a dry rub of garlic powder, white pepper and monterrey steak seasoning for about 3 hours. I let it sit out for an hour and a half at room temp before cooking. Then I switched up the liquid seasoning by substituting half of the low sodium soy sauce with red cooking wine. I also mixed olive oil & red wine on the side for basting (I basted every 10 minutes).I added mushrooms and shallot for the last 15 minutes. 

I cooked it on 350 for 45 minutes and it came out med rare.

The tenderloin was expensive but well worth it. I will be making this again.

Fantastic flavor, but definitely use the low sodium soy sauce. So easy and so good! I always add carrots and mushrooms after I turn the roast over.

My guests were raving over this!!!  Melt in your mouth fabulous!!  Will definitely serve this again.  After recovering from sticker shock,  I listened to the advice of the butcher in Publix.   Read lots of different  recipes, much more complicated than this one, but took his advice.  No rub, no marinade, seared it a little in olive oil and some garlic, then seasoned it with salt and pepper before pouring sauce over it and putting in the oven.  He was spot on.  Anything else would have been overwhelming.  This was perfectly seasoned.  I used some AU Jus I purchased, also made a horse radish sauce, a blue cheese sauce  and then of course, the sauce it was cooked in.  Will not prepare any of the other sauces next time.  Just the sauce it was cooked in.   Mom Mmm Mmm.   So Good.  So so good.

We didn't like the flavor of soy sauce the first time I made this recipe.  However, I made this again replacing the soy sauce with Soy Vay Veri Veri Teriyaki and it turned into an amazing 5 star dinner!

Very simple & turned out butter-knife tender. As others have said, I'd recommend using low sodium soy sauce and/or unsalted butter. An electric meat thermometer is a huge help, too.

This was ok.  The soy sauce masks the flavor of the meat, which is a shame.

I too was skeptical since there are only 2 ingredients in the sauce but this is so tasty that I wish I had made more! I used 1 pound of tenderloin and halved the sauce ingredients. This could not be easier! Serve this for your family and they will think you are a genius!!!

This is truly a fabulous recipe and so very easy!  I will not make comments if I change a recipe out of respect to the one who submits, but in this case it may help others like me...you see I live in Alaska  and our main diet is moose meat!  I was looking for a different way to cook my moose tenderloin and I couldn't find one and as I usually do, I find one to adapt.  My husband LOVED this!   Thank you!

I made this recipe last night. Used a 4 lb. tenderloin, so I added a 1/4 cup extra of butter and soy sauce. This receipe was outrageous. My only recommendation is to pour the soy sauce first. I poured the melted butter first and it it seemed the soy sauce just dripped into the pan because the tenderloin was so slick from the butter. I paired this with roasted asparagus and rosemary oven roasted potatoes. I will definitely make this recipe again. :)

The reviews were spot on - easy and delicious!!  I cooked a 1.20 pd beef tenderloin at 350 degrees for 35 mins. Cooked at medium at this time.  Low sodium soy & unsalted butter.  I used a small glass pie pan and poured in the ingredients over the meat.  The pieces that were covered to the top, those turned out really flavorful!  I probably marinated the meat for 15 mins and the tenderloin had an abundance of flavor.  

Tip - let tenderloin sit at room temperature for at least an hour, after cooking, let it rest for 20 mins.  The juices are sooo good, if you serve with rolls, it will make an awesome au jus sauce!  Thanks for sharing!

Luscious!  But after the first try, I now use only low-sodium soy sauce.  Otherwise it's WAY too salty, and this expensive cut of beef is drowned in salt. As for time, it depends on which end of the tenderloin I am baking (I cut a 6-pound tenderloin from Sam's in half).  If it's the thinner, folded end, then the time is correct.  If the thicker end, it takes an extra 10-15 minutes to reach the right temperature. Do not overcook!  I get rave reviews every Christmas about this dish.

Absolutely fantastic!  We had it this year for Christmas, I'll be using it again and again because it's so easy and so good.  Just make sure you don't overcook it, and let it rest before cutting.

Afte carefully reading most of the reviews, I prepared this entree for a family New Year's dinner using the lower sodium/unsalted butter substitutions and adding sweet onions & mushrooms at the end of the roasting times & it came out perfectly! I do agree that the roasting time is a bit off, though. Added another 15 minutes for medium. Thanks very much.

Expensive and worth every penny; delicious and easy. Basting really kept the the roast moist and tender. We served it with small Yukon potatoes and a lime-based sour cream sauce, and broccoli with lemon juice. A very special meal.

Very quick and easy, but the sauce over powers the taste of the meat.  All I could taste was the soy sauce.  However; the men in the family liked it.

Fabulous, and a keeper! Took longer to cook than stated, but not by too much. Use temperature as your guide. Took advice of others and added chopped mushrooms to liquid near end of cooking time. Delicious. Not as salty as I initially expected it would be. Will be my go-to tenderloin recipe!

Never cooked a whole tenderloin myself and had 12 big eaters at my house on Christmas Eve to feed! This was the easiest recipe I have ever prepared and there were very little leftovers. I purchased a 6 pound loin and cooked it at 375 for 45 minutes.  It came out perfect! Thank you for the recipe!

WE MADE THIS RECIPE FOR XMAS DINNER. EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT THIS BEEF TENDERLOIN. IT JUST MELTED IN YOU MOUTH.  MY WIFE AND I USED A MIXTURE OF SOY SAUCE AND RED WINE. FOR THE BUTTER WE USED KERRY GOLD GARLIC HERB BUTTER. WE PLACED THE BEEF ON TOP OF SLICED ONIONS AND ADDED SLICED MUSHROOMS. WE WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THIS AGAIN.

This came out beautiful and moist.  For a 3lb tenderloin it needs a longer cooking time.  At least an extra 10 - 15 minutes for medium.  Other than that, no changes.

This tenderloin is awesome! I was skeptical at first because it seemed too easy but it turned out great. I did think that the cook time seemed a bit long though. I only cooed it to 125 degrees and then let is rest for 15-20 minutes and it was a beautiful medium to medium rare.

Absolutely fabulous!  I'm sure it will become a holiday  tradition at our house!  If I can do this, anyone can.  It was a bit salty for me, I will probably use low sodium soy sauce next time, although my family didn't complain at all about it.  Also makes great gravy made with a rue, the drippings from the meat and some beef broth. Yum!

It's named correctly! Fabulous flavor and easy to make. Made it for Christmas and the whole family loved it! I used low sodium soy and replaced 1/3 of it with water. Covered the meat with garlic and black pepper. Will definitely make again.

Yummy!  I wasn't sure how this would turn out... it seemed too salty as I was assembling it, but I was very pleased with the end result.  I did use low sodium soy sauce though.  I'll be repeating it whenever I find the meat on sale!

soooooo good!  bought 4.5 lb at Costco for $75 for Christmas 2010...too much for 8 people.  buy less next time. also - use low sodium soy sauce b/c this was a bit too salty.  definitely put the marinade in a gravy bowl so people can add to their plate - very good.

Made this yesterday for Christmas dinner--a bit skeptical because it was so simple but it had so many positive reviews that I decided to try -- it turned out fabulous!  The taste was wonderful.  Everyone loved it.  I followed the directions exactly and the cooking time was right on.  I did take mine out at 110 degrees and let it sit for 30 minutes and it came to med rare. PERFECT AND EASY

Very good!  My son who doesn't usually like meat actually said "this is really tender!"  The soy is not too salty and I used regular since that's all I had.  I wrapped everything in very think foil several times over and cooked on the top rack of our grill, then sliced into partial slices to give two quick turns on grill for a crispness on the outer layer.  Yummy!  I served it with sauteed mushrooms.

Who knew such a simple preparation could be so good!  We are hooked on this recipe, and have found yet another challenge in our quest to cut back on red meat.  Some things are just too good!

Fantastic!  Made this with the only modification of low salt soy since this was what I had.  Not salty at all. I almost didn't make this after seeing all the "improvements" people think they have made to the recipe.  That usually means that the recipe isn' t very good. Will make this again for sure.

This was amazing! Hard to beleive with only a few ingredients.Beef was sooooo tender.I did use low sodium soy sauce and reduced soy sauce to 1/2 cup.When i removed roast from pan I discarded remaining sauce and drippings due to low sodium diet.Didn't need it anyway enough had been left on the roast after basting.Thankyou.

Being on injury has given me the chance to cook for my family and see if this would be a good meal for the fireguys.  this is a FANTASTIC recipe!!  I would change the soy sauce to low sodium and I added 1/8 c. worchestershire. I would also add mushrooms to soak up all the yummy goodness....GO FOR IT!!!!

DELICIOUS!!!  This was the first tenderloin I have ever cooked and it was sooo easy and absolutely delicious!!  The only thing I did different was add a spice rub to the roast from the store I purchased it at!

Amazing, do follow the other reviews regarding low sodium, add some julianned stop light peppers while it's baking, and watch out, it's almost like mini prime rib.

Followed this recipe for Easter dinner hosted for my husband's family.  Tenderloin was melt-in-your-mouth delicious; cut like butter and had an excellent flavor.  Everyone raved about it.  This recipe is so simple ingredient and time wise.  I would use it again and certainly recommend it to anyone.

Absolutely fabulous.  No way to mess this one up as long as you have a thermometer on hand.  We had to cut off the smaller end and then put the thicker end back in for a little longer to cook.  So easy with only three ingrediants.  It's worth making.

Excellent simple recipe. Other than a little cracked pepper, I did nothing differently and it was perfect. A little mushroom gravy, some asparagus and brown rice and my husband was asking what I did wrong that I needed to butter him up so much. I'm not about to tell him I did this because it was the quickest and easiest!

This was very easy and was delicious.  I did overbake it though.  I thought for sure it would take longer than 45 minutes and one of the other reviewers stated that they had to cook their's longer.  So I didn't check the meat's temperature until 1 hour and by that time, it was just about at well done.  I would have preferred it at 150-160 temp. range. But, our guests still enjoyed it very much.

This was my first time making a roast and it was very easy to make. We like to dip slices in the gravy and found it to be too salty. It was very tasty but salty. I even used unsalted butter and light soy sauce. Maybe next time I'll try using half the ingredients. My roast was 2.5Ibs and I had to cook it for 60 minutes to have it medium. Overall, it was very easy, simple and tasty and my husband liked it so I know I'll be making it again. Thanks for sharing.

Amazing!  The second time I made this I substituted teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce, popped it in the oven on timed bake while I picked up the kids from sports practice.  It melts in your mouth!

Just needs some garlic cloves. I mince two and mixed it into the butter and soy sauce before pouring over.

I did exactly as the recipe called for.  I thought it would be too salty and too greasy but it was amazing.  Everyone raved about it.  This is a keeper.  My son-in-law made a special request to have it for his birthday dinner.  Simply awesome!!!

I made this for my first family dinner at my house for my son, his fiancé, and their daughter.  Cooking has not been my strong suit but I have been trying to do more of it lately.  Used this recipe since it seemed simple enough for me to do.  It was fantastic!!!!!  I had the butcher at the grocery store cut the right amount and type of beef I needed.  It may have been expensive, but well worth every penny.  Juicy, melt-in-your-mouth, and great as leftovers every time.  Try this recipe.  You are going to love it!

Family said it was the best tenderloin they ever had!  I also went with the low sodium soy sauce and salt free butter. Also added sweet onion and the mushrooms at the end. This will be on the table at Christmas Eve next year!  The tenderloin was almost 6 lbs from Costco.

Added garlic. Add 2 white or yellow onions at beginning, and a ton of mushrooms with 15 min left. Those were beat part.

I made this last year for Christmas and again this year by request.  This year I did rub it with a garlic pepper combo and did a quick sear of the tenderloin first.  Due to multiple preferences between medium to rare I did leave it in about 15 minutes longer than suggested and it was a perfect medium on the ends and medium rare in the middle.  My husband (rare) enjoyed the flavor and tenderness so much he didn’t mind the medium rare.

absolutely delicious! I have been making this for Christmas for the past 5 years. turns out perfect! I buy a 4lb beef tenderloin. I trim it. I cut it in half. I put into the 13x9 clear casserole dish. I turn it every 15 minutes to coat with marinade. I bake it for 1hr, then I decrease temperature to 325 and bake 15 more minutes. I took it out and let rest on plate , tented loosely with foil, for 15 minutes, cut and serve! (comes out a little more than Medium NOT well done) I bought 2,  4lb tenderloins and did above and baked 2 casserole dishes  side by side as above. It served 12 adults, some with 2nd helpings. I had left overs which easily would have served 4 more. Use salted butter and low sodium soy sauce.

This was my first time to cook a tenderloin, and I was pretty nervous to work with such an expensive cut.  BUT... it was so awesome and soooo easy!!  

I used unsalted butter and low sodium soy, which I defiantly recommend.  I added pearl onions and mushrooms the last 20ish minutes, and that was a fantastic addition!

Wonderful easy recipe.  I had a 3 lb. beef tenderloin which I cooked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes then flipped it over as the recipe calls for.  I took the tenderloin out after 33 minutes instead of the 35-40 minutes and inserted a meat thermometer which read 130 degrees.  We like medium-rare and it was perfect!  The soy sauce, butter and meat juices made a wonderful light sauce to spoon over the meat.  Served with mushrooms cooked in butter and port wine and oven roasted potatoes.  My husband and son loved it!

I agree with many previous comments  about saltiness. Substitute low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter, no worries. Yummy  with red wine, mushrooms, onions and garlic.

This truly was a fabulous recipe!  I have had it several times.  My problem is I have a 6# tenderloin that won't fit into my 15x11 GLASS pan. I cannot find a large enough glass or ceramic pan.  Someone suggested placing  parchment on the bottom of my larger metal pan.  With the acidity involved (soy sauce) I'm wondering if that would work.    Has anyone cooked a large tenderloin in a roasting pan etc.?  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  If anyone can help me with this problem, you can send me an email at: rosseleanor@msn.com  Thank you!

I was surprised how well this tasted with such simple preparation but a quarter pound of butter will make just about anything taste good. I did add garlic to the melted butter, used a 4.5 lb beef tenderloin and low sodium organic soy sauce but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  Poured the soy sauce over the meat first followed by the garlic butter, flipped it after 10 minutes, baked it for 30 more minutes and tented it for a good 20 minutes after pulling it out of the oven.  I didn't get a chance to baste it but it turned out tender and juicy thanks to the tenting. Color was good. Flavor was excellent.

DELICIOUS! Very simple recipe, yet delicious! I find that 15 minutes cook time per each 1 pound of beef tenderloin is perfect. I modified the recipe slightly by replacing half of the soy sauce with red wine (Cabernet) and I always use Bragg Liquid Aminos (a natural alternative to soy soy) in place of soy sauce. I also added button mushrooms around the beef during the last 30 minutes of cooking. If you are new to making a beef tenderloin, I have a few suggestions:  First, ask your butcher to trim it for you (this will save you money by not paying for fat you will discard at home) and save you time. Second, it’s important to remember that the tenderloin will not be completely cooked when you remove it from the oven. It continues to cook during the vital 10-15 minutes of resting. Enjoy!! Beef tenderloin is an expensive cut, but well worth it!

I made this for the first time and it was amazing.  I had a 6 pound loin so I doubled the ingredients but I’m doing it again, I would not double. There was plenty of juice. The flavor was wonderful and I will definitely make this again

We LOVED it! Made 5 lb tenderloin, rubbed kosher salt and softened butter all over prior to cooking. Cooked at 350 for 10, turned over like recipe says, then cooked for 55 minutes more until reached 130 degrees-after resting 10-15 minutes,  was at perfect 135 for medium rare. Made Alton Brown’s horseradish sauce and served with sautéed peppers.

Amazing! Used low sodium soy sauce and unsaled butter. I did add 1/2 merlot and  onion to roasting dish. I also put in sauted mushrooms in at the end.  It was a big hit. Definitely use a meat thermometer. I was surprised how quickly a 7lb tenderloin cooked! I will be making this again. Thanks to all who shared their variatios .

Soooooo easy! Didn't change a thing. It was awesome. Tender, tasty and melted in your mouth. I was tempted to add something but the soy and butter was perfect. Remember to keep basting. Thanks

This really was simple and delicious. I thought the soy sauce would make the gravy overly salty but it did not. I did have to cook the meat about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated and might raise the heat next time. I added diced onions and mushrooms along with some beef brother to the drippings and thickened it with a little cornstarch & water. Will definitely make it again!

This was absolutely delicious!   I bought a 5 lb roast for Christmas-was a bit nervous as it was expensive and I've never done this type of meat before.  I doubled the ingredients and it turned out fantastic.

So simple, yet so wonderful. Seasoned the meat with salt, pepper and a little ranch dressing mix. Cooked two large tenderloins so doubled the butter, but added 3/4 c balsamic with the soy sauce. Cooked to 145 degrees. Tender delicious meat. Will be making this again.

The only tweak I made was to rub some freshly ground pepper and crushed dried rosemary on the roast prior to putting the soy sauce+butter mixture.  This is the easiest method I've seen, and it is utterly delicious!

Jeeze people please understand that if you're using a two pound piece of meat compared to a six pound roast ...of course it's going to be too salty. Think about what you're doing ! That being said this is an excellent recipe. If you're worried about too much salt use a drinking grade red wine for the soy sauce and don't leave out the salted butter.

Excellent flavor and so tender! As others suggested, I halved the soy sauce and used Merlot wine for the other half.  After I added the all the liquid, I topped the roast with fresh ground pepper, 2 cloves chopped garlic, and sliced sweet onion. Everyone loved it!

Made this yesterday and it was delicious.  Ended up having to add some cooking time at the end, due to the thickness of the tenderloin to get it cooked just right- an extra ten to fifteen minutes did the trick.

Very easy to prep and cook, we'll definitely be making this again.

The beef tenderloin was cooked perfectly, but I did not love the sauce. It was way too salty, even with the low-sodium soy sauce.

Ok, Seriously better than fabulous. I had never even tasted beef tenderloin before but there was a sale and my hubby brought home a 2 lb roast. YUM!! I used 1/4 cup soy and 1/2 cup red wine with unsalted butter. Perfect it was like butter..So good he's gone back to buy more today..

I believe this is the first review I've ever left. My husband came home with a beautiful piece of tenderloin, and since I never made it before- I panicked. I found this recipe and read the reviews and figured it was the best option for me to try- and I'm SO glad I did!! I followed the recipe as well as a few comments (I added shiitake mushrooms in the last 15 minutes) and also added fresh thyme from my greenhouse. I used the liquid leftover to make gravy...and oh my goodness...it's all so delectable!! Thank you for a wonderful recipe, fantastic suggestions and for helping me be wife of the year to my husband!

So simple...and absolutely delicious.  I bought two VERY thick Filet Mignon steaks instead of the tenderloin roast.  They came out perfect - I like my meat red on the inside and juicy.  Followed the timing for the cooking, but checked on it a few times just to make sure I didn't overcook it (I didn't).  I'm making it again his weekend for a dinner party.  It reminded me that sometimes simple recipes are the best.

This was so easy and turned out great.  We used our own salt seasoning mix .  We had to cook it a bit longer, but it was a hit.

This was unbelievably good!  I was a bit leary about it because of the lack of ingredients but decided to try it anyway.  I wasn't disappointed.  My whole family loved it.

Came out great.  I did use little less soy sauce but that was use me.  I made 3 whole tenderloins for Christmas Dinner.  I cooked one first rare (covered and let sit) then staggered the next 2 in the same oven.  When you cook more than one together, you have to raise the temperature higher than 350.  You can also cook one at a higher temp if you want.  I generally cook 375-425 depending on the circumstances.  I have even used a convection oven at 400 and worked out fine.

This was so easy and tasted good! I baked at 350 in a convection oven. I did turn it after 10 minutes. It was done after 25 more minutes.

So easy to make!!  I used low sodium soy sauce & unsalted butter.  I also seasoned it with some garlic & black pepper.  It came out delicious with just the right amount of flavor.   All of my guests loved it and I will definitely  make this again.

This was excellent. I used unsalted butter and low sodium soy sauce, and needed to cook it a bit longer, for medium well.  My tenderloin was thicker in the middle than on the ends, so it was more well done on the ends, but had some pink in the middle. I cooked a 4 pounder for about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe. I used low sodium soy sauce and added mushrooms as many reviews suggested. Got raves on all of it. Especially the mushrooms as they deliciously soaked up the butter and soy sauce. Used probe in oven for med-rare in center, ends were closer to medium.

Initially the soy sauce was a turn off.  But all the reviews promised that my Christmas dinner would be delicious. And it was!!!  Actually, I would never have known soy sauce was an ingredient.  Succulent, moist deliciousness.  Highly recommend for an effortless special meal.

This was so easy and the flavour and method were spot on.  I had a 5 lb roast.  Used about 2oz reg soy sauce with the recommended amt butter.  I put abt 3 T. minced garlic in the butter while melting.  Baked it for 10 minutes, turned, basted and added about 3 ozs, reg soy at that time. Total  5oz of reg soy and the 5lb roast was not too salty.  Many thanks!!!

Huge hit with the entire family.  Some said it was the best they’d ever had.  Cooked a 4 1/2 lb and 3 1/2 lb tenderloin next to each other in the same roasting pan.  Doubled the recipe.  Used low sodium soy sauce (and my family are salt addicts!). Put a whole large onion sliced in the bottom.  Near the end, added a box of pre-sliced baby Bella’s and shiitake each.  Super simple to make and outrageously delicious.

Incredibly easy! I did not have enough soy sauce so I used the small amount of soy sauce (2tps) that I had, adding in a little barbecue sauce (1/4cup) and mixed, I then diluted it with a little water since both have a lot of sodium; it was the tastiest!... perfect! mixture.

Seeing that there only three ingredients for this tenderloin recipe I really wasn’t holding out much hope that it was going to be that good… I was right… It wasn’t that good it was absolutely magnificent! I will definitely be making this again

This is a solid recipe but you need to use the low sodium soy sauce as the regular is way too salty.

Used a New York Strip Roast instead of a tenderloin, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. It turned out perfectly and was a huge hit! I was asked to make it again, which I’ll gladly do, since it was so easy!

I was skeptical , just as some others mentioned. However, I’ll have to say that my family rave about this tenderloin. I would not hesitate to serve it for company .  Easy and delicious ! 
I did add garlic powder to the butter as  another reviewer suggested .

This was delicious! I agree with the other reviewers, the recipe was a tad too salty. I used regular soy sauce and unsalted butter.  I felt the salt slightly overwhelmed the taste of the meat. You can always add salt at the end but you can't remove it! Next time I might try using half soy sauce, half Worcestershire sauce, and slightly less butter. My cut of meat was around 2.5 lbs and took around 55 minutes total to cook to rare.

I used a cup of low sodium soy sauce, a cup of red wine, half a stick of melted butter with four cloves of crushed garlic. Cooking time was longer because it was a 5 lb tenderloin. I just cooked to desired temp. Last 10 minutes I added shiitake mushrooms alongside. So easy to prepare and cook. Delicious!

Absolutely Perfect!!! I used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter and added a coating of salt free garlic seasoning (mrs. D's) This is easily the perfect beef roast. don't be intimidated by the price of the meat, there is no waste and no hassle when you serve it.

The butter and soy sauce have a taste which is easier for almost all palates, but feel free to add some more spices if you're looking for a different flavor. Great on its own!

Only thing I added was garlic powder & onion powder directly on the beef and let sit like suggested at room temperature before adding 1/2 c low sodium soy sauce and 1/4 c unsalted butter and baked at 325 degrees for 10 minutes, turned over and baked for just under an hour with thermometer.  Also added 1/2 lb of fresh white mushrooms, the last 20 minutes.  Took out of  oven, did foil tent on top of stove and temp went up 10 degrees.  Delicious, thank you for the great simple recipe.

This was amazing!  Our guests raved over it.  I made a 5 lb tenderloin with double the sauce.  I cooked it for the exact same time as the recipe says for a 3lb, but left it in the oven (turned off) for 10 more min after cooking.  It was perfectly medium rare.  So tender!  We fed 4 adults & have some beautiful leftovers.  I did add the mushrooms as others suggested & it tasted & looked great.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus, & corn on the cob.  Will definitely be making this again.

I used Dales steak seasoning instead of soy sauce and it turned out great.  Dales is basically soy sauce with some added spices.

This was o..m..g.. delishious the only thing I did different because I only had a 500gm piece of meat was adjust the amount of butter and soy.  My oven requires more heat so I adjust the temp after the first 10 mins and gave it an extra 5 mins and omg even the mother in law ate all of it.  It was so tender even cold I will make it this way again

I just made it tonight! AWESOME! I used a low sodium soy sauce and added cut new potatoes to the casserole dish. The sauce is super delicious! And so easy to make. It's a Sunday favorite on a Wednesday night!

Wow. This is so ridiculously easy I almost didn't make it.  Everyone loved it.  Consumed to the last drop by kids and adults. This is a real keeper! Thanks for submitting. Mine took a little longer to cook but it wasn't room temperature to begin with.  Just followed the thermometer until done. Easy breezy.

Even though some said the timing may have been off,  I followed this recipe's cooking times and it was absolutely perfect! I do have a newer oven though and I did use convection at 350 degrees F. I set the timer and it tested at 140 internally as the timer went off. I removed it from the oven and left the thermometer in the roast. It climbed to 156 degrees.  

I only changed the recipe a bit because I didn't have time to buy soy sauce, so zip used Dales's meat seasoning sauce. It is basically soy sauce with a bit of garlic. I also used coarse salt and sprinkled a bit all over the roast both upon putting it in the oven, and turning the roast at the 10 min. interval. That's all I changed, but I do have a hint. Make sure you trim and tie your tenderloin roast appropriately.  It won't cook properly if it's not tied snugly. I used butcher twine and tied every inch using easy "how to" directions on a short YouTube video. I found it very easy. 

I was stunned at how simple this was and how delicious it turned out. This recipe has officially replaced ham at our Easter dinner. Everyone ate  until they were beyond  full.

Great recipe,and yet so simple..
One suggestion though..Before placing Tenderloin
into the oven,I put it in a large skillet and brushed
both sides with virgin olive oil and browned it in the skillet 
on both sides.Then I placed it in a pan and put it in the oven..

My daughter suggested this change and it is fabulous:  instead of 3/4 cup soy sauce use 3 oz. soy sauce plus 3 oz. red wine.  Delicious on sliders with horseradish sauce!

Made this tonight and it was amazing! So easy! I added minced garlic, pepper and onions while I had it marinating on the counter a couple hours before putting in the oven. The last twenty minutes I also added mushrooms. This may replace my rib roast recipe at Christmas due to how easy it was... while it's resting you can get all your sides done. Great recipe!

I only cooked a 1 and 3/4 pound roast, but I cooked it the amount of time stated in the recipe and it was medium rare, tender and super delicious.  I used no salt butter but regular soy sauce.  The meat did not taste salty at all, but the sweet potato chunks that I cooked with it were extremely salty tasting.  I would make this often if the meat was not so expensive.  Well worth it though!!!

I cook A LOT and this was RIDICULOUS!!! I've always said KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) is best & this is no exception.
For a 1.5 lb. roast:
First, I very thinly  sliced one sweet onion & added it to my 9x13" glass baking dish. 
Then, I peppered my roast on both sides and laid it on a rack above the onions (so it wouldn't sit in the liquid) and inserted a remote thermometer (set to go off at 132 degrees).
Then, I whisked 3oz of sodium free soy sauce (& I'm a salt FREAK) + 3 oz of merlot (instead of just soy sauce, as other reviewers suggested) + 1 stick of salted butter (melted in the microwave) and poured it over the tenderloin.
Into the oven for 10 min. (meat started at 67 degrees) then I flipped it and cooked it for another 25 min. or so until the temp reached 132 degrees)  
Then, I took it out and tented with foil, letting it rest (went to 135 degrees/perfectly med-rare).
While it was resting, I strained the au jus and reserved the cooked onions in a bowl.
I added the au jus to a pan with about 6 oz. of beef broth (can) and whisked in about 2 tsp cornstarch/water combo to thicken.   
This was **FANTASTIC**
I had a bit of leftover gravy that I saved  but it made enough for a 3 lb roast.  
Great recipe!!  Simple and amazing.  TRY IT!  :)
I made this for NY Eve along with smoked lobster tails... crazy good sh**!!

what a hit! i've made Christmas beef tenderloin for years with varying results. i'm tired of rubs and complicated recipes. i was looking for easy and delish and have found it! no searing, though it looked and tasted seared. the soy/butter sauce created a tasty, deep brown, somewhat crispy coating. maybe it's my oven, but i had to play with timing,  basting the tenderloin during each check (that's not in the recipe). finally, tenting and resting is key. i rested mine for about 45 min. resulting in an evenly rare, but not too rare, well browned, buttery, in taste and texture, success! a keeper for sure.

Very yummy!  I used low sodium soy sauce and added fresh chopped garlic to the butter mixture.  I had an 8 pound roast so I just kept checking the internal temp. It took about an hour & 15 mins for perfectly cooked medium. Everyone raved about  this roast. Will defiantly be making this again.

Great flavor on the meat. I took an 8# and cut it into 2 equal parts and cooked side by side covered. 350 for 60 min then uncovered andincreased temp to 400 for ~13 minutes longer.  I let it rest covered for 10 min before serving. end was medium and the center medium rare.

I made a beef tenderloin for Christmas for the first time this year for 20 people.  I had an eight pound tenderloin and rubbed fresh garlic all over the roast.  Then added the melted no sodium butter, 1 cup low sodium soy, and followed one reviewers recommendation and added 1 cup cab.  Cooked as recommended, although a little longer due to the bigger tenderloin, but until I had 130 on the thermometer.  It was wonderful, everyone was raving about it!!  Would def make again and give more stars if it allowed!  And very easy for someone and their first try with such an expensive piece of meat!  The trick is the thermometer!

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner using a whole beef tenderloin that had been trimmed and tied by the butcher.  

We like our tenderloin on the rare side but some of our guests like their tenderloin on the more well done side.  I cut the piece into two parts (one thinner part and one thicker part.  I used a meat thermometer in the thicker part. I took it out of the oven when the internal temp reached 125 degrees in the thicker part.  After sitting under foil for 15 minutes, the meat was rare in the thicker part and more well done in the slimmer part.  All guests thoroughly enjoyed their beef entree!

I also made horseradish dressing for the beef.  The combination of the soy and the horseradish was awesome!

very simple and basic - works like a charm every time.  It's nice to let the roast rest after cooking for a few minutes.

This is delicious.  I've made this several times  with the low sodium soy sauce and some Tastefully Simple Bourbon Bayou Sauce.  Very good!

Love love love this recipe.  I have shared it with many of my family members and everyone is saying they will never "grill" a tenderloin again.  I made it the first time just as it is stated.  The second time - just switched up the soy for liquid aminos.  Didn't change the taste one bit.  I have added the mushrooms as others suggested and just love that.  Needed to find a bigger dish to have more mushrooms to go around.

Used the low sodium soy sauce and it was still really salty, but good flavor and family loved it.  Also added the mushrooms and would do it again.

My 1st attempt at beef tenderloin .. it won't be the last ..  it was easy, excellent, impressive!  I used a 2 lb roast cut from a larger one & marinated it in the soy sauce for 2 hrs at room temperature as suggested  by another reviewer.   It then went into a baking dish with the soy sauce & I poured  the melted butter poured over it.  I roasted it 10-15 minutes, turned it over & roasted about 45-50 minutes longer then removed from the oven & tented it for 10-15 minutes before serving.  It turned out to be "medium" (no pink in the meat to please my hubby) & it was awesome but next time I'll do it medium rare the way I prefer  ... either way I'm sure it will be awesome.  I'll be using this recipe again even with cheaper cuts of beef which I'll do in a crockpot to make sure the meat is tender.  I also want to try substituting beef broth for 1/2 of the soy sauce for more of an au jus flavor.   My hubby & I really liked this recipe, we shared out meal with the elderly couple next door, they both loved it as well & they swear it's the best meat they have ever eaten.      THANKS FOR POSTING THIS RECIPE ... I'LL BE USING IT AGAIN & AGAIN.

Really great recipe for company. I made a few modifications mentioned by others: added 1 sweet onion sliced to the bottom of the pan; added 1/2 cup Pinot Noir and added 1 tsp. Garlic powder to the sauce; added sliced mushrooms at the end. Then thickened the gravy with 1/2 cup beef broth and corn starch over a burner. Everyone loved it. Served with scalloped potatoes and green bean bundles. A meal I will make again!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was amazing!  The cut of meat is s little out of my price range for "regular meals," otherwise we would have it once a week!  I served it with brown rice and roasted asparagus.  Home run!

I cooked this for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous. I made it exactly as the recipe said, and everyone loved it.  I made a large piece of tenderloin so I could have leftovers, but by the time seconds and even thirds were eaten, there was nothing left. Added this recipe to my favorites and will definitely make over and over.

I prepared this for Christmas for the first time and it was a HUGE HIT for 10 adults and 2 children!  I made several modifications after reading numerous reviews about the salty taste.   I bought a 7 lb partially trimmed Beef tenderloin roast at Sam's as it was half the price they wanted at the supermarket.  I watched an online tutorial on trimming it and this was quite simple having borrowed my neighbor's very sharp fillet knife.  The trimmed version was around 5 lbs which then sat on the counter for 2 hours prior to baking.   Because one end was half the size of the other end, I tucked the smaller end under and tied it with a noncoated string (I did not have cooking twine) in three places so it would cook more even.   I wanted plenty of gravy and my dinner needed to be Gluten free, so this was my modification:  3/4 C Gluten free soy sauce, 3/4 C Cabernet Sauvignon (or whatever Red you are serving), 1/2 Cup Gluten free Beef Broth & 1 Cup melted unsalted butter (Next time, I will cut the Soy sauce down more & add more wine or beef broth).  I cooked this big one at 375 for about an hour fifteen, checking the thermometer every 10-15 minutes in the middle and the ends of the roast during the last half hour.  Pulled it from the pan when it was at least 140 everywhere (the ends were upper 148-149 degrees) and let it rest 10-15 minutes under foil.  Having never made this, I was VERY NERVOUS about the amount of blood "Juices"  I still saw running from the meat, but I trusted the the

I made this with pork tenderloin which I seared in a cast iron skillet prior to baking.  It was amazing.  Added fresh rosemary to the liquid and deglazed the pan with a bit of red wine before mixing in butter and soy sauce.  Adding mushrooms was perfect the last 10 minutes. Thickened to a gravy after removing meat by whisking in some soy flour and heavy cream.  Perfect!

Prior to purchasing the meat at the butcher, I was unaware that this cut is basically a filet mignon in a roast.  It's pretty hard to screw up such a good cut of meat.  That being said, this recipe, as simple as it is, is soooo good.  I always make it in a larger pan so I can add plenty of mushrooms to the pan which I highly recommend.

This is my go to recipe for guests and it never disappoints. I also add some red wine to the mix. The last time I made it was a 10 lb tenderloin and for Medium (140F or 60C) it took about 1-3/4 hours which I was surprised it wasn't longer.
Everyone absolutely raves about this dish and its worth the money to know it will come out great every time even if you overcook it. I spoon some of the sauce over the slices when serving which makes it nice.

5 stars all the way.  I had 2 pieces of tenderloin weighing a total of about 6 lbs to serve 16 people.  I used a meat thermometer to ensure the right internal temperature as we like it very rare.  For the entire meat I used only 1/3c soy sauce and 1/3c butter which I heated together before pouring over the meat - no problem with separation - it made a smooth sauce for basting and the resulting au jus was unbelievably good.  I turned the meat over only once.
If you want a good side dish, try the Southern Green Beans from this site.  Just excellent.

I'd purchased two 2lb beef tenderloins and used the Ninja Cooking System.  That way, I could sear them first with the stovetop function. After searing, they fit together diagonally and I poured over the soy sauce, cut with water.  I chose to slice the butter along the side of the stick and lay the slices on top of the two roasts. Then, I switched it to the oven function for 30 min.  Good thing I checked it at 20 min. because they were at 142 degrees internal temperature. After resting for 15 min. I had to slice an end off one.  It was tough, but wait.... when I sliced the end off the other roast, it was fantastic. These were purchased at the same store, on the same day. The tough one will become stew meat chunks. If I use the Ninja Cooking System, I'll turn the temperature down to 325 or maybe even 300, during the oven cycle.

My butcher son brought home a tenderloin and I had no idea how to cook it besides cutting it into steaks which seemed such a sorry way to treat this beautiful piece of meat. I tried this recipe last night and got rave reviews as well. Even my 13 year old daughter cleaned her plate.
As recommended by others, I cooked it for 1 hour and it was perfect.

First time making a roasted beef tenderloin and it was a hit! 5 stars to the simple awesomeness of this recipe. While I agree the sauce is salty, the meat is not :) and the sauce can be easily adjusted prior serving in either quantity or taste  to one's liking.. I enjoyed this meat stirring a little Sarabeth's plum cherry marmalade into the soy-butter sauce  - yummy!

Fantastic. Doesn't need full soy or butter. First half 400. Second half 350. Perfect. 35-40 min. 3 pounds at byerlys equals 90 dollars. Fed all family minus Janelle.
3.3 pounds 10 min at 400.  Flip.  Another 20.  Lower to 350 for 20.  Rest 10.  Slice.

This was so easy and tasted wonderful.  I used the low sodium soy sauce.  Next time I would add mushrooms and perhaps red potatoes.

Made this tonight for New Year's Eve. It was amazing! I used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter as many others suggested. It was perfect! I added mushrooms during the last 15 minutes and sweet onion with the original ingredients. We purchased a 6.5lb tenderloin and that fed 5 of us with enough for another dinner. Our sides were twice baked potatoes and corn on the cob. We also had king crab legs. It was a perfect holiday meal.

The gravy made from the pan sauce was way too salty.  I used low sodium soy sauce but it gets concentrated as you cook it so it comes out much more salty than when you started. It gives the meat good flavor, but have a backup plan for other gravy.

Have to say I loved it But big change I would make next time...preheat oven to 450 and roast for 20 minutes.  Turn heat down to 350 and continue cooking until meat thermometer registers the degree of rareness/doneness you prefer.  That way you have a well browned, nicely crusted piece of meat.  Otherwise a fabulously easy, elegant preparation.  I did use low sodium soy and salt free butter.  I also threw a couple of pounds of ready sliced baby portobello mushrooms into the soy remaining in the pan and roasted them while the beef was resting.

This is a great, simple recipe, that always impresses dinner guests.  I typically use a bit of the pan drippings in whatever sauce I make to go with the meat.

Amazing, marinated the tenderloin for a day, with the garlic & soy sauce, added the butter before I put in the oven. Button mushrooms was added in about 10 mins left ,mixed it with the meat juice. Let sit for about 10 mins, almost dropped to the floor when I tasted it, DEF A KEEPER.

So delicious! I was worried it might be too salty as some of the other reviews mentioned; so I added 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup unsalted butter, and 1/3 cup water. I also rubbed the beef with garlic powder, pepper, and thyme.

We loved it! I adjusted the ingredients for a 2 lb tenderloin. I did dilute the soy sauce with water 1:1 and it was perfect/not too salty. My oven took 50 minutes to reach the mentioned temperature. My boyfriend had 4 servings of it and he is super picky with many dislikes.

My first try with beef tenderloin and it was a success!  I doubled the recipe for 12 and it was perfect.  I added mushrooms during the last 15 minutes and they were delicious.  I used low sodium soy sauce and got rave reviews.  Thank you allrecipes.com and your reviewers for giving me the courage to try this very expensive cut of meat for my Easter brunch.

Yeah, this really was fantastic. So easy, so flavorful. Our tweens loved it. Ran out of butter, so I used some of my precious burnt butter with garlic stash, along with the soy sauce, and oh my. Amazing. Thank you thank you for such a simple and totally delicious recipe!!!!

Low sodium soy sauce & 1/2 stick of butter, for a 3 pound roast, with a 1 pound container of sliced mushrooms added, the last 15 minutes of cooking, is Definitely, the way to go! Yummy!!!!!

Like others, I was concerned taking an $80 cut of meat and covering with only soy sauce. However, I trusted the reviewers, used low sodium soy sauce and red wine. It was AMAZING. (still a tad salty) I also roasted small red potatoes with the meat and I took the time to remove all the silver skin from the meat and tie it with butchers string. This will definitely be the go to I wanna impress the guests meal!  **I also used a meat thermometer to ensure the meat was not overcooked!!** go ahead and make this dish you will NOT be disappointed!

I made a 6 lb tenderloin using this recipe for Christmas dinner.  Although I was told it was good, I wasn't impressed.  First, the recipe doesn't say to sear the meat before roasting, so I didn't.  Searing would have drastically improved the taste and presentation.  Also, since I doubled the meat, I doubled the "sauce", but it was so much that my meat was basically boiled in the soy/butter mix.  This just didn't seem right.  I basted every 20 minute but the sauce never thickened.  It never seemed to "stick" to the meat.  I don't think much of the soy flavor made it into the meat.  It was just okay, I won't make this again.

Wonderful and tender!  Everyone raved.  I did have sticker shock over the price of the meat, but it's great to know that if I want to spend the money for something easy and delicious, yet impressive as well, I have this recipe in my arsenal.  I will probably try it with low sodium soy sauce, as others have suggested.  My guests also wanted some sauce on the side, like horseradish.  I had not considered this, and didn't have time to throw something together, so we just offered creamed horseradish and sour cream.  I will definitely try it again, maybe with mushrooms, as other reviewers suggested.

Used Braggs Aminos instead of soy, reduce by 1/2, add red wine to make up difference.  Reduce butter by 1/2. Added Braggs seasoning and pepper. I used a 6lb tenderloin. Watch cook times. I thought I needed a bit more for the 6 lbs but didn't. I ended up having it medium plus as it still cooks when you remove from oven. Be sure to remove at about 120 degrees for medium. Everyone loved it!

This recipe was so simple and turned out great! I have never made a tenderloin before so I was a little intimidated but thankful that I turned to allrecipes.com and found this recipe!

This is incredible!!! It was my first attempt at tenderloin, and I don't think I'll ever make it another way!  I don't cook much but people didn't believe that after serving them this.  I followed the others' suggestions and used low sodium soy sauce.  Yum!!!

Absolutely loved it! I had a 2.71 lb pork tenderloin and used this recipe and cooked it at the suggested 350 but for 2 hours and it was fork tender! My boyfriend informed me he had never had a tenderloin before...I didn't tell him I have made him one before...this was just that WOW!

I made this recipe today for tailgating at South Carolina vs North Carolina football game. I followed the recipe but added 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce.  Everyone absolutely loved. The next time I will cook more.

I have never made this dish and was concerned with the simplicity of this recipe.  I did take the advice of one of the reviews and added (2) teaspoon of minced garlic, ½ cup of finely minced onions and 2/3 cup of Merlot.  I also sprinkled the bottom with black pepper, and then put it into the pan.  I then sprinkled black pepper on top and then poured the mixture in.  UNBELIEVABLE and finger licking good.

This was wonderful.  I plan on making this many more times.  Even though this cut of meat is more expensive it has very little waste and wonderful flavor.  Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce but that's the only adjustment I will make.  I fixed it last night and today I had a wonderful sandwich for lunch.

Great recipe! I pan seared my tenderloin first. Then, sautéed garlic & onion to cook with it...and added sautéed mushrooms the last 15 minutes. Turned out awesome! Was slightly salty even tho I used reduced sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter. Might cut the soy in half & add wine next time. Also had to cook for an hour & a half to get med-rare (3lb @ 350). Will definitely make again...

First time making beef tenderloin.. Followed the recipe as directed and just added 5 cloves of garlic sliced thinly(we eat garlic on EVERYTHING) and added the mushrooms at the end as suggested by others. I added beef broth and cornstarch to make a light gravy. Absolutely the best tasting roast ever..

Very good - like many others I added sliced onions and mushrooms to the sauce - My tenderloin was not quite 3 pounds and I had to cook it well over an hour to make it rare.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I followed the reviews and used low-sodium soy sauce.  I made 2 4-lb. tenderloins for Christmas Eve dinner for about 12 people.  We could not stop eating it!!  I paired it with garlic smashed potatoes and bacon-wrapped green beans.  Great meal!

Fixed this at Christmas and it is now a favorite.  
I will add salted butter next time though. I did add cracked pepper to the top of the roast after I turned it.
The gravy from the meat was amazing!!  Just added sliced mushrooms,water, 1/2 c. wine and cornstarch YUM.

Made this for a special occasion and the tender, flavorful meat was delicious.  I used 1/2 low-sodium soy sauce and 1/2 water.  I put a base layer of thin sliced onions under the tenderloin and sprinkled granulated garlic and pepper on top.  I added the Market Day yukon gold potatoes and mushrooms.  It was easy to make this dish, and we enjoyed the moist tenderloin and vegetables.  Added this to my recipe box; will make again!

This was absolutely amazing even the old folks liked it even though they were skeptical. We did follow the tips that we read about using the sweet onion on the bottom, low sodium soy and unsalted butter.

This recipe is so easy and so very tasty! I used low sodium soy sauce, and checked the internal temp about half way through. Cut back on the cooking time since I was going for med-rare. Served it for my family and extended family Christmas day it was a major hit!  Will be using this recipe again and again.

Had this last night for dinner and it was to die for!  I used 3 rib steaks instead of the beef tenderloin.  The hubby refused to grill the steaks outside as we were having a huge snowstorm (the nerve of that guy!) so I looked for another option for cooking these steaks and came across this recipe.  The only change I made was adding water to the soya sauce to make it less salty.  This is a definite repeat!  Thank you for posting such a simple but delicious recipe!

I agree with the recommendations to use low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter.  Even then, I used half the recommended amount of soy sauce and some merlot (any wine will do!).  I added mushrooms for the last 15 minutes of cooking time and the tenderloin turned out amazing!!  To make gravy, I cooked the drippings with some water and cornstarch (as another reviewer suggested) which made a wonderful gravy but even with the modifications it could have been a little less salty.  Will definitely make this again!

I used low sodium soy sauce the second time and it was less salty.  Cooking time my be a little off depending on the size of your meat.

I had to cook a little longer, about 40 to 45 minutes for 3 1/2 pounds to get a perfect medium rare, but this recipe was excellent and the meal was fantastic!

Excellent. Had 1.8lb roast and turned out perfectly.  Not overpowering & perfect for that cut of meat.

I tried this recipe with a 5lb tenderloin.  I used low salt soya sauce, with slices garlic butter.  I also put the pieces of sliced fresh garlic on the top of the tenderloin.  It turned out so tender and juicy!  Everyone loved it.  Awesome. I added in mushrooms 45 minutes before it finished.  Very nice and easy.

The Beef Tenderloin was fantastic! I decided to make a gravy out of the juice from the baking dish. It was a little salty, so I think I will use a lighter soya sauce, to soften the salt in the gravy'; or add water. Other than that, very easy to make and very good!

I gave this recipe a 4* for ease of prep and  because the meat was melt in your mouth tender... but the gravy was way too salty.  (and I used reduced sodium soy sauce).  
I might use this recipe as a method of preparing the meat and discard the sauce rather than use it.

I really enjoyed this, though the soy sauce and the butter wouldn't mix well. They stayed seperated in the dish so it was hard to use it as a sauce after. I actually used tenderloin steaks instead of the roast. My kids loved it too, but my husband wasn't as fond of it as us. Super easy though! 4 stars!

This dish is amazing and so easy! The meat melts in your mouth! I used low sodium soy sauce and put crimini mushrooms in with the beef. The mushrooms were to die for.

Excellent, and SO easy!  I will definitely make this again the next time I'm in the mood for beef!
UPDATE:  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND using normal soy for this.  I tried it with Lite/Low Sodium the last time and it was not even close to the awesomeness it was the first time I made it.  Back to the original tonight and it was again AWESOME!  So I'm tellin' you, go against your better judgement to use the lite soy...or if you must (because this IS a pretty salty dish) try 1/2 normal and 1/2 low sodium (which I may try next time).

My first time making a beef tenderloin and it was so easy. Everyone loved it. 3 picky children and 3 adults, all loved. The time was a little off as we like our beef a little more rare.

Too salty for my taste, though my husband enjoyed it. I would recommend low sodium soy sauce if you have it. Added mushrooms are a nice touch. but next time I'll try something different.

As other cooks have commented, I was quite hesitant to use this very simple recipe with the concern of ruining 8 pounds of tenderloin. I did not want it to taste like an Asian preparation. I made it last evening for 17 guest for New Years, followed the recipe with no alterations and added a variety of mushrooms. It was FABULOUS! Everyone loved it and will be a repeat for my carnavour friends. Carolyn

This recipe definately uses the KISS method (keep it simple, stupid) of preparation. Very easy to do and the tenderloin comes out spectacular. We let ours rest 30 min. covered with aluminum foil and the beef melted in your mouth. FANTASTIC!!!

It really is fabulous! And so very easy. Think I'll go low sodiuim soy sauce next time. I love the salty taste but the butter and salt combined made me feel a little guilty...like movie popcorn! All in moderation, though; can't afford tenderloin or the movies often enough for it to kill me!

Very simple, very delicious.  But next time I'll use low-sodium soy sauce and I probably won't marinade like I did this time (for an hour).  I added sliced mushrooms to the cooking and it was all yummy.

Very impressive dish.  I have prepared this several times for large and small dinner parties (including my daughter's wedding reception dinner) and everyone raves over how good it is.  I use unsalted butter which seems to level out the salty taste.

I wasn't sure how soy sauce would work out, but this was absolutely delicious!  Used 1/2 cup soy sauce because that's all I had, and it was fine.  Will make this recipe again and again!!

Made this for 13 people for Christmas Eve dinner and making it again tonight for the Superbowl (but only for 4!).  It is awesome!  So simple and delicious.  Also substitute with low sodium soy sauce and cook the mushrooms right in the same pan with the beef...SO YUMMY!!!!  Has become a family favorite for sure!

I agree with other reviewers, use low sodium soy sauce, otherwise it will be too salty.  I only used 1/2 cup soy to reduce the sodium even more.  Fabulous flavor and easy recipe.

Unbelievable....3 ingredients and this kind of flavour? Wouldn't have believed it unless I had tried it. I'll be trying it again and again. Thanks! Top notch!

So delicious!  So easy to make and so tasty you can't go wrong.  The only thing I did was add sliced garlic into slits in the roast.  I used a cross rib roast as well.  cooked to 130 for med. rare and the flavor was so good.  I put the left over juice in little cups and dunked our bites into it it was that good!  Lots of butter, but every now and then, it's a treat!

This beef tenderloin was absolutely fabulous (true to its name).  I (like another reviewer) changed the recipe just slightly by adding mushrooms with 15 minutes left to go on the cook time.  So flavorful and delicious and unbelievably easy.
