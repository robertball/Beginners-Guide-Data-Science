The recipe doesn’t indicate if the tomatoes are supposed to be canned or fresh, so I used a 14-1/2 oz can as well as a few freshly-chopped Campari tomatoes.  Once I started cooking the chicken mixture, I knew that 16 oz of linguine would overwhelm this casserole, so I cut back to about 12 oz, and that still was plenty of pasta (you really do want to taste the chicken-tomato mixture).  I added salt, pepper, and some red pepper flakes to add a little zing.  One word of caution.  The recipe says to cook the chicken-tomato mixture until the liquid has almost evaporated.  Don’t go overboard because the pasta will absorb some of the liquid, and my casserole ended up a little dry.  Honestly, had concerns about cheddar cheese (kept thinking parmesan and mozzarella), but it was good.  Just be prepared to adjust the seasonings to your tastes, and you’ll be fine.  I’m the first reviewer, so none of this is meant to be negative because we did enjoy this dish.

I changed a few things to this recipe and it turned out great! I used only about 12oz of linguine based on other reviews of it turning out bland or dry, and it was a good ratio of pasta to chicken. I also rinsed out the pasta with hot water after draining it to keep it from drying and sticking. I used 2 cups of Rotel diced tomatoes and that worked great for flavor and moisture. For cooking times I did 10 minutes cooking the chicken and misc and 10 minutes after adding the tomatoes and misc. I also added a lot more cheese than was called for including cheddar, Parmesan, and mozzarella all shredded, and sprinkled mostly cheddar and Parmesan on top before baking for 16-18 minutes. It wasn’t dry at all, and it was awesome for leftovers! Served with a fresh garden salad

Oven-Baked Chicken Linguine Haiku: "More like 'pasta bake', as oven's point is just melt. Still, it tasted great." I guess I'm glad that the title was misleading (in that nothing is actually "baked" and the oven's only purpose is to re-heat all the items together w/ melty cheese), b/c I enjoyed the ease of arranging this in the morning and fridging it until putting it in the oven at dinnertime. I broke the linguine into thirds b4 boiling (didn't relish the idea of us twirling noodles whilst stabbing at chicken when it came time to eat, and when I make again, I'll probably use a smaller pasta like penne or rotini) and used a can of Italian-seasoned tomatoes for the 2 c. diced tomatoes called for. We really enjoyed this alot, and will look forward to eating it again.

This was good, but dry.  I think the pasta portion could be cut down quite a bit.  Also, adding parmesan cheese helped.

Made it exactly as called for with one exception: less linguine. Was delicious! My husband even asked me to make it again. Though there are only 3 of us, we often differ in taste preferences. This time we all loved it.

Was very good! Word of advice; pay attention to the portion sizes. My pasta box had twice the amount called for in the recipe and if I hadn't noticed it probably would have turned out bland. Tasted great!

We really enjoyed this. I made it exactly as written, except used rotini instead of linguini, and added a bit of shredded parmesan on top. It was good. I doubled the amount of tomatoes, cause it looked a bit dry for my liking. Even with 2 cans, it needed something else. The next day for leftovers(this makes a LOT) I added some pasta sauce, and it was perfect. Making it again to
