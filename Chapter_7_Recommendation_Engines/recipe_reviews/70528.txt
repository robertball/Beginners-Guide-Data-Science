This recipe really is versatile!  I thought for sure that I was going to ruin the dish because I just used what ingredients I had on hand.  I only used zucchini,onion, garlic, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of broccoli soup, beef broth, Italian herbs, salt, pepper, 13 thighs, and jack cheese.  It was delicious!  The only thing I would do different is to brown the thighs first.  The sauce was wonderful over rice and I could see adding a bit of wine to the sauce next time too!

Simple and easy.  You really can't go wrong with Cream of chicken....  fortunately or unfortunately, it's the same taste always.  What made this recipe nice was the eggplant/squash. I added baby ears of corn which made for a different texture and was very tasty.  Also some chopped red pepper for color. Very enjoyable meal and I would do it again.

Wouldn't you know, the day this recipe came my way, I had all the ingredients...well subbing chicken tenders for thighs, using fresh green beans,broccoli, mushrooms,and onions...and it was sooooo good!  I also had leftover mashed potatoes for the gravy. I did try to thicken the soup mix with a little flour/water and it was still a little runny, but my husband and I loved it! I used cream of mushroom soup. I didn't use all the pepper it called for, and sprinkled the cheese (shredded mix of cheese)on top at the end of baking. Yum!

Very good, very easy.  I did not have eggplant or mushrooms, however I used some cream of musroom soup and I served it with some brown rice.  We all loved it.  I can imagine how much better it will taste with ALL the ingredients!  Can not wait to make it again.

I sometimes crave this recipe.  The chicken is nice and tender and goes well on top of rice.  I add another can of soup though for a thicker consistency.  Good for when you have leftover veggies that you're not sure what to do with.

Excellent recipe!  I didn't use mushrooms and subbed zucchini for the squash, it was delicious!

We served it with angel hair pasta since it was nice and saucy. I will make this one again!

Made this in my slow cooker the first time - really bad idea, ended up with slop!  Second time followed recipe more closely, i did add more vegies.  I added 2 cans of soup (1 chicken, 1 corn) also added water, had no wine so didn't bother.  Next time i will add the 2 soups but no water, mushrooms and zucchini release a lot of liquid so i feel it is not needed. I will add some thyme in the future for a boost, it needed a little something extra. Good over rice.

I did not care for this dish.  I found it to be boring and not very tasty.  The sauce was very runny and it didn't have much flavour.

We liked this recipe a lot.  The best thing about it is tht it is so versitle.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, cream of mushroom souup, broccoli instead of the eggplant, and a combo of mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  It was quick and easy.  Great for a low carb meal.

WOW!  What a great recipe!  I did make changes - I used cream of celery soup instead, and the vegetables were zucchini, mushrooms, and onions.  I added 1/4 t. of cayenne pepper, 1/2 t. granulated garlic, and 1 1/2 t. bouquet garni to the soup/broth sauce.  My husband could not get enough!  I suggest serving this dish with rice.

This was very good and VERY rich!  I did not care for the texture of the chicken thighs in this though.  It made already tender dark meat too tender.  I will definitely make this again, but with breasts.

I actually did my own version with recipe basics.  Browned the chicken first, w/skin on and used carrots, onions and mushrooms on the bottom.  Also added some sherry and it was awesome!!  Sweetest carrots I've ever had and the whole dinner screamed comfort and yummy!!

This was a pretty good recipe...kind of a comfort dish.  I did a couple of things differently... I browned the chicken in a little olive oil first (so that it didn't take so long to cook) then I did exactly what DRUMNWRITE said...I used what I had.  Put in some mushrooms, some onion, a lot of garlic and some zucchinni.  Then to give it a little italian feel, I added some italian seasoning and then topped it off with some parmesean cheese instead of swiss.  Turned out awesome, down home goodness.

I made with the the squash,but as I ate it thought it would be much better with carrots and potatoes, even peas a beans, than squash. Good recipe, just needed better veggies my family likes better.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  The dish remninded me of a spicier version of chicken pot pie, which I have never liked.  However, my husband, who loves pot pie, thought the dish was very good, and ate both his plate and mine.  And as the description says, it is a very easy dish to prepare, so I gave it 3 stars.

This was awesome and easy to make.  The eggplant at the store was too large so I substituted zucchini and used shredded Italian cheese blend.  Can't wait to try the leftovers tonight.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was not a good mix. The thighs were rubbery and the sauce didn't help.

It was good but a bit too liquidy for my taste. I used the recommended vegetables plus some fresh green beans. I like the green beans and the other veggies were good too, but the latter were a bit on the too soft side. I used Dubliner cheese instead of Swiss and was quite a nice flavor. This dish would be better I think with 1 can of cream of chicken soup (vs. 2) and no added chicken broth. (And less eggplant/squash and more green beans)

I thought the dish had good flavor, but for me the eggplant tasted fishy, which I did not like at all.  My husband gave this one the thumbs down, so I guess I won't be making this again.

I've never actually written a review before now, but I felt I had to. After following the recipe exactly, I wound up serving it in soup bowls, because it was so "soupy". The eggplant totally disentigrated and the cheese almost looked curdled. IF anyone decides to make this recipe, I would strongly recommend throwing a cup or so of rice or pasta to soak up some of abundance of liquid.

I must admit that even though I'm not a huge thigh fan (wings.. yummy), I did like this recipe. I only had a few ingredients so it wasn't as hearty as I would have liked. I also felt that it was too soupy for my taste and will try to make the sauce thicker next time.

We really enjoyed this recipe !  I had broccoli on hand so that is what I used for the vegetable.  The swiss cheese is a great touch and gives it wonderful flavor.

The only change I made to this recipe was to use plain soup (no herbs).  We just didn't care for it.  Adult daughter, husband & I all agreed this was not worth preparing again.  Grandkids, who eat most things, wouldn't take a second bite.  Gross waste of good eggplant. Definitely a loser.

Very good, easy to make, but a lot of prep. We used chicken breasts that we coated with seasoned salt. Added another layer of flavor, otherwise the dish would have been rather bland. Great with buttered french bread to sop up the extra juice. Hubby loved it.

Excellent, easy recipe.!!  My husband has very discriminating taste and said this was good enough to serve to company!  My change was to add a package of onion soup mix and water since I did not have chicken broth.!!  I browned the chicken and veggies before baking everything.

This was great!  Since everyone was reviewing it as being so versatile, I actually used frozen mixed veggies, along with the fresh mushrooms, and frozen chopped onions.  I also used "mexican" mixed cheese instead of swiss, and topped it with fried onions.  Everyone liked it...very good.

This is the true definition of Comfort Food! I browned the chicken thighs in the #8 cast iron skillet. Set it aside, then I sautéed the onions, garlic, mushrooms and yellow squash, set it aside, added more Olive Oil to the pan and added three bags of Boil in Bag Brown Rice (un-cooked), covered with the veggies, then the chicken, then poured over the cream chick soup/chicken stock mixture and baked at 350 for 50 mins. In the last 5 mins, I added the cheese and put under the broiler for just a few mins to brown. YUM !!

I really enjoyed this recipe. My husband felt like it needed a little more flavor so he added a dash of Red Hot sauce to his. I think next time I will make a few modifications as other reviews have.

Very good! Didn’t use the eggplant and I let it cook for an additional 30 minutes because I thought that it was too soupy at 45 minutes.

I didn't have chicken broth so I just used water and it still came out very tasty. I also seasoned my veggies as I sauteed them and seasoned the chicken because the recipe doesn't say to do that. I loved it!

This recipe had a good base, but I changed it for what I had in the kitchen. First, I browned the chicken in a pan with butter and olive oil and set aside. Then in the same pan, I sauteed onion, garlic, and a bell pepper I had. When they carmelized I added the zucchini. In the bowl, I put the cream of chicken soup, since I didn't have swiss or broth, I added cream cheese and sour cream, then mixed it all with the vegtables.  I had some rice a roni and made it, and I had frozen cauliflower, so I chopped it in my handichopper and added it to the rice. (my daughter  hates veggies-this works for me) I put the rice in the bottom of the baking pan, topped with the chicken, and poured the veggies and sauce over all.  I used adobo and garlic pepper to taste. It was amazing! I changed it alot but maybe this will give you some ideas! :)

This is a versatile dish.  I used Cream of Chicken & Golden Mushroom soups with only a half can of broth.  This made plenty of sauce to go atop the rice I served with it.  For the veggies, I cut a giant broccoli crown into sections, 2 zucchinis into chunks, chopped a medium onion, 1 stalk of celery & a red pepper.  I think the red pepper was my favorite flavor.  I had sliced Swiss cheese on hand which I placed underneath the skin of the chicken plus cut strips to cover more of the veggies.  My family thought I was so clever putting the cheese inside the chicken (that was their favorite part).  I will definitely make this again and plan to include eggplant.

My version was really good.  I used Pacific Creamy Butternut Squash soup since we can't eat dairy foods. I stir fried a small onion, eggplant, an apple, & zucchini, then browned skinless thighs, all in olive oil & seasoned them with garlic powder, Italian seasoning & Montreal Chicken seasoning.  Topped the veggies with part of a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies.  Poured on some of the soup, then placed the thighs on top and added more soup.  Baked for 45 minutes & served over rice.

Twas delicious!  My aunt was over for dinner and she has celiac's..  This was a perfect dish to serve with her as a guest..  I did have to cook it much longer than stated, so watch for that!!!  Oh, and I would also follow the other suggestions and serve over a bed of rice, white/basmati/saffron/wild - Any would be great...  It is very soupy AND delicious!

I gave this 4 stars because when tweaked, it was delicious.  The first time I made it, it was soupy and spilled over in the oven.  The veggies were mushy and we had to search to find them in all of the soup/sauce.  This time, I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and omitted the chicken broth.  I also sauted only the onion, garlic and mushrooms.  I added more veggies - squash, zucchini,asparagus- and more spices - basil and thyme. It was wonderful this time.  I will make it again for sure.

Such a versatile recipe! I added red peppers to mine, and used dried eggplant (cause that's what I had). I omitted the cream soup and used a cup of low sodium chicken broth instead of the canned. I did not have a squash, so I used a sweet potato/yam. I also added paprika, fresh thyme, cumin powder, and dried rosemary to taste. I browned the chicken with the skin on to begin with; removed the skin and drained the fat out of the pan, reserving a couple of tablespoons; put the chicken back in the pot with the veggies on top and poured in the broth and let simmer for about 45 minutes; took the chicken out and boiled the rest until reduced to a thick sauce. The veggies were a little mushy but LOTS of flavour.
