My Aunt who has since passed away would make these cookies, but she never gave out the recipe.   These were very close to hers.  I used 1/2 cup of orange juice which gave the dough more flavor.  The first time I made them, I used 1/4 of orange juice and the cookies were too bland for us.   Icing - First time I used lemon flavor as the recipe calls for.  Second time I used butter creme or chocolate.   They tasted like mini cupcakes that way.  Which my kids loved.

I did not like this version as much as the traditional Anginettes with a lemon flavoring to them. I suggest a few changes that will absolutly blow you away!YOu can always cut recipe in half if you do not need that many. I suggest: Small Bottle Lemon Flavoring (use can use any flavor but lemon is traditional) 
1tsp vanilla 
¾ cup orange juice 
1 ½ cups oil 
6 eggs 
7 cups Flour 
½ tsp baking soda 
5 tsp baking powder 
2 cups sugar

Thank you for this awesome recipe. These taste very similar to the lemon drop cookies I buy from Italian-American bakeries in my community. I altered the icing recipe to have orange essence, lime juice, and vanilla extract which gave it a lovely little bite. I would make these as a lovely treat for someone anytime of the year. Awesome recipe, and I had fun making them too!

Tryed these out for X-Mas but they didn't turn out so well. I think that instead of the froasting that's used for this, it should have been a butter-sugar-cream frosting instead. This recipe has much potential. I think a few things could have been altered.

Easy to make.  Add nice color to a tin of gift-cookies.  I made the dough balls fairly small to keep them bite size so I had to almost triple the frosting amount.  Next time I will use the juice of a WHOLE orange instead of just half becuse they came out a little on the bland side until they were frosted.

I have made this cookie with my family my whole life. This is a traditional Italian Christmas cookie. It does not need altering as past posters have suggested. This is the way it is supposed to taste, and is perfect. I was going to post my own Anginette recipe on here, but this is pretty much it. They are light, citrus-y, and delicious. It isn't an orange or lemon cookie, that is why it isn't called an orange or lemon cookie. It is essentially a sugar cookie with a hint of other flavors, and I thank you so much for sharing it so I don't have to! :)

I followed the recipe and everyone in the house was happy with the results.  We tend to like desserts that aren't overly sweet, so the subtle taste was good.  I might consider adding orange zest to them next time and maybe double the lemon juice in the glaze.  They are disappearing fast!

I added a bit of lemon and orange zest for color and flavor. I think next time I'll add just a tad more sugar but these made a GREAT cookie cutter dough!

I was very disappointed because they don't really taste of orange at all.  If it weren't for the lemon juice in the icing I think they would be pretty bland!
