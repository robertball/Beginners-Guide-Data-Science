Made this as written (I did add more pesto though) and it was delicious - the leftovers were even better!  This lends itself to customization so I'm making it today using kalamata olives and feta cheese plus I'm adding chicken.  I'd suggest that using very sweet tomatoes is a good idea for flavor balance.

The meal was delicious. I have been trying to increase my fiber.  Instead of ancient grains, are used chickpea pasta. This was a super bowl side dish. It made a touchdown.

Very easy & Awesome for parties. If you dont have mozzarella pearls, you can slice string cheese sideways into little circles. I added orange bell pepper for more color & crunch. Next time I might add small shrimp as well. THX for a great recipe!

Made this at the beginning of summer and got rave reviews but, unfortunately, didn't save it and I have made 3 others from different websites. Thank God I finally found the original- Excellent!

I eliminated the olives, because they are just disgusting..otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Turned out pretty good! Will make it again!

Very easy to make. I used organic pasta and pesto from Costco and. I prefer to lightly saute the tomatoes so its a little bit soft. I added more pesto and suggest that you add according to your taste. Was done in minutes!

Made it as written.  In looking for something simple that my picky eater would like, it was very good! I will be making  this again, but will add a little salt and pepper to taste.
