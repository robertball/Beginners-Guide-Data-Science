Delicious and easy. As others have said, it definitely needs lemon juice and LOTS of kale. I used fresh kale and next time will put in closer to 2 cups.
My husband and teenage son agree that this dish is a "keeper."

I too made this after coming home late from the gym.  Was certainly quick, nutritious, and yummy.  I was worried I didn't use enough couscous or water but it's definitely enough.  My only recommendation to to use more (fresh) kale, it's a wonder food after all, and maybe less butter to lesson the calorie count.  Will keep this one handy for quick dinners.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I followed the cook's note and used frozen kale, but I didn't add the almonds or cheese and it still tasted great. We ate the couscous with parathas. It was a really fast meal to put together.

I loved this! I followed the recipe to a T, except I used plain almonds instead of salted ones. Very flavorful and healthy tasting. Thank you!

I really liked this.  I added a can of diced tomatoes, and I used Israeli Couscous and frozen chopped kale. I was lazy (and my dishwasher is broken), so I used only one pot. I saut√©ed onion and garlic in olive oil, browned the couscous, added water, and when couscous was ready, I threw in the other ingredients.  My 14 yo was the only one who liked it, so I cant add it to my rotation, will save for lunches for me.

Wow, I'm sorry to leave this review.  As the only one in the family willing to eat it, I give it 1 star.  It is so dry, and not that flavorful.  Since I'm eating the leftovers my family won't, I have added vinaigrette, which helps.  But, although it's very healthy, I'd plan on a sauce, or skip it.

I give this high marks for creativity and ease of preparation. It was filling and healthy too . But the taste just didn't hit the high notes for me. I'm not sure what else it needs. (Someone mentioned lemon juice). My family thought it was just ok so I don't think I'll make again.

I really liked this dish.   My four year old even loved it.   I would however add more kale and maybe some lemon juice to the recipe next time.

Delicious and simple meal. I always add in whatever other veggies are around, typically summer squash and zucchini or tomatoes. Throw some balsamic vinegar on it and it is even better!

My family loves this recipe. We usually add a can of garbanzo beans and chunks of goat cheese to the mix. We also never cook the kale. Great healthy quick meat less meal your family will love.

I made the dish as instructed. But I also took the advice of people here and added: about a teaspoon (or two) of lemon juice and another cup of diced kale. Without the lemon juice, the kale was making the dish a bit dry and bitter. Perhaps diced tomatoes would be good to add next time to make less dry, too.

This was very good. I used a 10 ounce box of couscous and 2 cups of vegetarian broth. I doubled the amount of kale and sauteed one onion and 8 ounces of sliced onions with the kale.  This is an easy to prepare recipe and I will definitely make this again after a late afternoon Pilates class.

I am disappointed in this. It was too dry and I could hardly taste anything. It was like eating a salad with no yummy flavor in it.

This was great! I couldn't find whole wheat couscous, so I used regular. The parmesan cheese lent a nice saltiness!

Very dry and tasteless :(I did not add sugar, just because there is already too much sugar in our food.)

Tasty and healthy.  I didn't have any whole wheat couscous, so I subbed red quinoa instead and cooked it in broth.  Everyone liked it!

Great recipe! I agree with the lemon juice suggestion, it needs a little extra flavor. I added sliced green olives and it was perfect!

I came across this recipe trying to use up some ingredients in my kitchen. It was amazing! Will be making this again.
