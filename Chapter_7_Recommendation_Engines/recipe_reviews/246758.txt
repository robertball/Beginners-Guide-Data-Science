Made as written and used Rotel for the diced tomatoes. This turned out great for me on the first day I made it. Unfortunately the cheese didn't melt very good with the leftovers. Not sure what happened? Flavor was still good but I had tiny balls of cheese throughout the soup with the leftovers that refused to melt. Taste will still good just a little odd to look at. Overall I enjoyed this and I will make it again.

I made this with all ground beef mini medley potatoes shredded cheddar cheese and skipped the carrots. It was amazing so hearty and flavorful. The family loved it! Next time I want to add bacon.

Soooo good! I didnâ€™t use sausage, just ground beef. Added chopped bacon, left out tomatoes and carrots. I also throw in some shredded cheddar

Soooo good! Freezes well too. I skipped the sour cream because I didn t have any and I didn t notice it for tomatoes so I botched that. It was similar to a broccoli and cheese soup.

I have made this soup twice following the recipe exactly and it is one of my family's favorite. Great flavor and very hearty.
